The lists under the collections do not include all the short stories in the book, just the ones I recommend.\n\nMary Roberts Rinehart\n\nRinehart's work is very different from the clichés of Rinehart criticism. It has a lot in common with hard-boiled school, in both style and subject. It also is part of the American school of \"scientific\" detection, like Arthur B. Reeve. In fact, all three groups, scientific, hard-boiled and Rinehart show common features. They form an American school that mixes adventure and detection. There is an attempt at realism in the depiction of modern life, with many different classes, corruption high and low, and a great diversity of characters.\n\nRinehart was highly influential on later mystery writers. Please see articles which discuss such writers in detail:\n\nRinehart Followers and the Had I But Known school. Helen Reilly. Theodora Du Bois.\n\nThe article on Victor Kalin discusses his illustrations for Rinehart's books.\n\nDisappearance Mysteries\n\nRinehart wrote many mysteries about people who disappear:\n\n\"The Valley of Oblivion\".\n\nThe Window at the White Cat The Case of Jennie Brice.\n\n\"The Buckled Bag\".\n\nThe Red Lamp. The Door. The Wall.\n\n\"The Dog in the Orchard\".\n\nThe Great Mistake.\n\n\"Episode of the Wandering Knife\".\n\nThe Swimming Pool (Chapters 29, 30).\n\n\"The Splinter\".\n\nSuch disappearance problems are interestingly ambiguous: has the person left voluntarily? Been abducted? Murdered? This is true of both such mysteries written by Rinehart, and by other authors.\n\nRinehart can use disappearance to enable story telling. First someone will disappear. Then clues will be found, later on. Finally their body is discovered, still later. Or perhaps they turn up alive. At each step an investigation takes place. All of this allows detailed storytelling, going through many stages of plot development.\n\nThe Long Gone Woman. A variant on a disappearance puzzle also appears in The Red Lamp and The Great Mistake. This is different from those works' main disappearance mysteries. In these subplots, a woman who vanished from the scene many years ago is sought. No one thinks she has been murdered. People just want her current location, to ask her questions. But no one knows where she now is. Both works come to similar solutions of these subplots, with the woman eventually found in a similar location and similar circumstances.\n\nMysterious Visitors\n\nA Mysterious Visitor: Working Class. In Mary Roberts Rinehart's The Door, Florence Gunther tries and fails to see the heroine (second half of Chapter 7). She is typical of a kind of character that sometimes appears in both Rinehart and her followers: a lower middle class, working class or poor person, who tries and fails to contact the upper class protagonists of the story. The person's purpose or errand is unknown, and becomes one of the story's mysteries.\n\nIn normal circumstances, there would be little social contact between rich and poor people. This makes such attempted visits all the more unusual and dramatic.\n\nI've dubbed this kind of character the \"Mysterious Visitor\".\n\nExamples are found in:\n\nMary Roberts Rinehart's The Door (1930), \"Episode of the Wandering Knife\" (1943) (Chapters 9-11), The Swimming Pool (1952) (start of Chapter 9).\n\nHelen Reilly's The Line-Up (1934). A related character: Pete in The Silver Leopard (1946). Agatha Christie: N or M? (1941) and its \"foreign woman\". Helen McCloy's Who's Calling? (1942). Leslie Ford's The Philadelphia Murder Story (1944), The Woman in Black (1947). And a related character in Scotland Yard Can Wait (1933).\n\nRinehart's \"The Buckled Bag\" (1914) (Chapter 3) has a prototype of the \"mysterious visitor\". A mysterious young man tries to get into a wealthy household, but is turned away at the door by the maid. This incident is just like a \"mysterious visitor\". However, such attempts to visit a household are the only or main things a true mysterious visitor does. By contrast, the young man in \"The Buckled Bag\" plays other roles in the plot as well.\n\nDon Morgan's situation in Rinehart's The Great Mistake (1940) (last part of Chapter 33) has aspects of the \"mysterious visitor\", but is not a pure example.\n\nFreeman Wills Crofts had Mysterious Strangers in some novels. These are based in different approaches than those in Rinehart and her followers:\n\nThe man who leaves the footprints in The Ponson Case (1921).\n\nCoates in Sir John Magill's Last Journey (1930).\n\nA Famous Mystery Cliche\n\nBIG SPOILERS in this section.\n\nThe solution of Mary Roberts Rinehart's The Door (1930) is notable for being one of only a few real-life examples known to me of an allegedly popular mystery clich&eacute. In The Door, \"the butler did it\" - although Rinehart did not use this actual phrase.\n\nLess significantly, Rinehart's short story \"The Butler's Christmas Eve\" (1944) contains two butlers - and one of them is indeed guilty.\n\nOther examples:\n\n\"The Man with Nine Lives\" in Hugh C. Weir's Miss Madelyn Mack, Detective (1914). This example was discovered by Mike Blake.\n\n\"The Strange Case of Mr. Challoner\" in Herbert Jenkins' Malcolm Sage Detective (1921).\n\nOwen Davis' play The Donovan Affair (1926) and its film (1929) directed by Frank Capra. This example was discovered by David Bordwell.\n\nErle Stanley Gardner's \"Cold Clews\" (1931). E.C.R. Lorac's The Case of Colonel Marchand (1933). Robert R. Mill's \"Murder on the Island\" (1933). Damon Runyon's spoof \"What, No Butler?\" (1933). Anthony Gilbert's Death in Fancy Dress (1933). Clyde B. Clason's The Purple Parrot (1937).\n\nThe film London by Night (1937). Scripted by George Oppenheimer, based on a play by Will Scott. Directed by Wilhelm Thiele.\n\nGregory Dean's Murder on Stilts (1939). Donald Bayne Hobart's \"Private Morgue\" (1941).\n\nGardner Fox's \"Case of the Magic Bloodstone\" (Adventure Comics #72, March 1942), a comic book tale featuring Starman.\n\nThe episode Black Fire (1958) of the TV series Maverick, scripted by Marion Hargrove from a story by Howard Browne, directed by Leslie H. Martinson.\n\nThe short story \"They're Trying to Kill Me\" (1959) by Craig Rice.\n\nThe made-for-TV movie Death Among Friends (1975) written by Stanley Ralph Ross, directed by Paul Wendkos.\n\nThe short story \"Mr. Strang Buys a Big H\" (1978) by William Brittain.\n\nThe episode Secret's Safe with Me (2012) of the TV series Castle, written by Terence Paul Winter, directed by John Terlesky.\n\nBoth in 1930 and today, Rinehart was much better known than these other writers (Gardner excepted). This has likely led some to suggest erroneously that Rinehart originated \"The butler did it\" approach. She didn't.\n\nIn an impressive article, Gareth Rees has unearthed many silent films in which the butler is a criminal. Recommended!\n\nThere are also early mysteries where the butler is a suspect, but turns out to be innocent: see Rufus Gillmore's The Alster Case (1914). And the mystery film 11:30 P.M. (Raoul Walsh, 1915). See also Rinehart's short story \"The Inside Story\" (1934), and her novels Miss Pinkerton, The Swimming Pool.\n\nIn The Lesser Antilles Case (1934) (Chapter 4) by Rufus King, joking reference is made to the idea that butlers \"are the lads who pull it in the best cases, nine times out of ten.\" So the idea that \"the butler did it\" was already a subject of humor in 1934. Rufus King's short story \"The Case of the Peculiar Precautions\" (1942) treats its butler as a serious suspect.\n\nCollections of Objects\n\nHeroine Tish collects physical clues, storing them in a drawer in \"The Amazing Adventure of Letitia Carberry\" (1911) (last part of Chapter 7). Decades later policeman Jim Conway will do the same in The Great Mistake (1940) (middle of Chapter 33). Jim Conway's collection of objects is much bigger. See also:\n\nThe objects on the heroine's table in The Bat (last page of the novel). This does not seem to be in the play version.\n\nThe \"old sea chest\" where the heroes store physical clues in The Red Lamp (Chapter titled July 31st).\n\nThe exhibits presented to the Grand Jury in The Door (middle of Chapter 19).\n\nThe clues collected by the police and by criminologist Herbert Dean in The Album (last part of Chapter 27).\n\nThe clues on the Inspector's desk in \"Episode of the Wandering Knife\" (Chapter 15).\n\nThe exhibits of the police chief's desk in \"The Burned Chair\" (start of Chapter 10).\n\nThe Conway assemblage has a surreal quality. It anticipates some of the surreal lists found in the avant-garde book The Atrocity Exhibition (1966-1970) by J. G. Ballard. Ballard's lists often have technical aspects; so do some of the collection in The Great Mistake.\n\nThe objects in The Great Mistake are vivid. They are dramatic pieces of imagery. around which Rinehart has built her tale. The reappearance of these objects in Conway's drawer late in the novel, recapitulates key images from throughout the tale.\n\nEarlier in the same chapter (Chapter 33) the heroine describes Maud Wainwright's fabulous collection of clothes. She also mentions \"a book of sketches, each dress shown in color, with the accessories and jewels to go with it.\" This collection of sketches, itself a series of images, anticipates the Conway collection of objects, key images in The Great Mistake.\n\nUndercover\n\nVarious Good Guys go undercover to do detective work in Rinehart mysteries:\n\nThe Circular Staircase. The Bat. Miss Pinkerton. The Album. The Yellow Room. The Swimming Pool.\n\nSee also undercover men in comic Tish stories:\n\n\"Tish's Spy\".\n\n\"Hijack and the Game\".\n\nMiss Pinkerton's nurse-detective tales show her entering cases in a way analogous to an undercover role. Still, she is always shown working under her own name, and in her own profession as nurse. This is therefore not quite a pure \"undercover\" role.\n\nReporters\n\nReporters in Rinehart tend to be sympathetic, male and mainly young:\n\nThe niece's boyfriend reporter Mr. Howell in The Case of Jennie Brice.\n\nDick Carter in The Door, also the niece's boyfriend.\n\nTwo young reporters disguised as painters, on the roof, in Miss Pinkerton (Chapters 18, 29).\n\nA young reporter does a bit of detective work in The Great Mistake (first part of Chapter 37).\n\nAnother sympathetic reporter Starr will appear in The Yellow Room. His personality is quite different from Dick's.\n\nThere is also the briefly-seen likable young news photographer in The Swimming Pool (first part of Chapter 6).\n\nReporters are not the principal detectives in these tales. But several them do a bit of sound detective work.\n\nDick Carter in The Door (end of Chapter 7) is suddenly assigned to a story by his newspaper. This is similar to two other key groups in Rinehart, police and nurses, who are also assigned cases. And reporters, police and nurses often make discoveries in her tales.\n\nDogs\n\nDogs appear in a number of Rinehart tales:\n\nThe Case of Jennie Brice. The Door.\n\n\"The Dog in the Orchard\".\n\nThe Great Mistake. The Swimming Pool.\n\n\"The Splinter\".\n\nIn some of these tales, the dogs know things or discover things, about the crime. In their own way, they serve as \"detectives\".\n\nGangsters\n\nThere are brief references to gangsters in early 1930's Rinehart mysteries:\n\nA bootlegger has moved in next door to the heroine's mansion in The Door (1930).\n\nGangster shootings are mentioned in a single sentence in \"That Is All\" (1932).\n\nThe heroine's previous case in Miss Pinkerton (1932) (start of Chapter 1) had taken her into the home of a gangster. And when a man mysteriously comes into money, his girlfriend wonders if he has been working as a bootlegger. He hasn't (Chapter 7).\n\nSuch gangster subject matter occurs only briefly and in passing. It does add a bit of sociological realism to these works' depiction of crime. And it shows Rinehart keeping up with the times, adding the new phenomenon of gangsterism to her stories.\n\nWhile the cities in the above tales are not named, they all seem to be more-or-less versions of Rinehart's own city Pittsburgh.\n\nSlick magazines, including Rinehart's main market the Saturday Evening Post, sometimes published gangland tales in this era. Please see my discussion.\n\nLine of Sight\n\nLine of Sight refers to what can be seen (or not seen) from a certain place. The concept plays a role in a number of mysteries:\n\nMary Roberts Rinehart: \"The Confession\" (1917), The Door (1930), Miss Pinkerton (1932), The Album (1933), \"Murder and the South Wind\" (1945).\n\nAgatha Christie: The Murder of Roger Ackroyd (1926). John Stephen Strange: The Clue of the Second Murder (1929), The Strangler Fig (1930). John Rhode: Pinehurst (1930), They Watched by Night (1941). Freeman Wills Crofts: Mystery in the Channel (1931), The Hog's Back Mystery (1933). Baynard Kendrick: Blood on Lake Louisa (1934), The Eleven of Diamonds (1936). Margery Allingham: \"The Border-Line Case\" (1936). Lenore Glen Offord: Skeleton Key (1943). Rex Stout: \"The Rodeo Murder\" (1960). China Miéville: The City & The City (2009).\n\nRelated concepts appear in some Mary Roberts Rinehart tales:\n\nThe hero possibly being watched in his room from a window next door, in the opening of The Man in Lower Ten (1906).\n\nThe periscope in The Case of Jennie Brice (1912).\n\nFrom his hospital room the hero can see into the nurse's room in \"In the Pavilion\" (1912).\n\nThe rooms with long vistas in \"Episode of the Wandering Knife\" (1943).\n\nPaired Houses\n\nThe five houses in The Album are a bit elaborate, but only the left hand three have much significance. The murder house (No. 2) is the most important. The heroine's house next door (No. 3) is architecturally identical, a fact used by Rinehart to produce surrealist echoing effects. When the heroine introduces us to her bedroom, she describes it to us in terms of the parallel room at the murder house. The effect is very eerie, suggesting all sorts of hidden undercurrents in the heroine's life. Other paired houses in Rinehart:\n\nLater, in the novella \"The Burned Chair\", Rinehart will introduce a pair of houses, to somewhat similar effect. All everyday living will take place in one house; all murder and mystery events take place in the similar house across the way. Going from one house to another means traveling from the normal world into the world of mystery.\n\nA somewhat similar architectural pattern is established in The Great Mistake (1940), where sinister events more often happen in a small building on the grounds called the \"playhouse\", rather than in the large central mansion where everybody lives.\n\nThe hero's house and the mysterious empty house next door in The Man in Lower Ten.\n\nThe hospital and the connecting nurses' dormitory in \"The Amazing Adventure of Letitia Carberry\" (Chapter 5).\n\nThe pavilion and the main hospital in \"In the Pavilion\".\n\nThe two houses in remote Brickyard Road in \"The Buckled Bag\" (Chapter 7).\n\nThe two rooms in The Door (Chapter 30).\n\nThe part of the house occupied by the family, and the barely connected part with the servants in Miss Pinkerton.\n\nThe young couple's house and the mother's house in \"The Inside Story\". These are not close by, however.\n\nThe two hotels, each with a suspect's room, in \"The Man Who Hid His Breakfast\".\n\nThe main mansion and the smaller house on its grounds for the young couple in \"Episode of the Wandering Knife\".\n\nThe mansion and the gatehouse cottage on its grounds in The Swimming Pool.\n\nThe Wilson and Raeburn houses next to each other in \"Murder and the South Wind\".\n\nA paradigm breaker: the country house and two small homes on its grounds, the lodge and the boathouse, in The Red Lamp.\n\nThe old and new parts of the house in The Red Lamp are also paired spaces.\n\nThere is a bit of the same effect, in the way the doctor's house is close to the heroine's home in both \"Code 31\" and Haunted Lady.\n\nVertical Architecture\n\nArchitecture has a vertical quality in a number of Rinehart works:\n\nThe Man in Lower Ten. The Circular Staircase.\n\n\"The Amazing Adventure of Letitia Carberry\".\n\n\"The Confession\".\n\nThe Bat. The Red Lamp. The Door. Miss Pinkerton. The Album. The Great Mistake. The Swimming Pool.\n\nPlease see the individual articles on these tales, for a detailed discussion.\n\nSeveral Rinehart works have ladders, all of which help provide a vertical dimension:\n\nThe Man in Lower Ten. The Circular Staircase. The Bat. The Red Lamp. The Door. Miss Pinkerton.\n\nElevators appear in:\n\n\"The Amazing Adventure of Letitia Carberry\".\n\nThe Great Mistake.\n\nUpper Floors\n\nMuch of \"The Inside Story\" takes place on the upper floors of the big house. This is a favorite Rinehart location, showing up in:\n\nThe Circular Staircase.\n\n\"The Amazing Adventure of Letitia Carberry\".\n\nThe Bat. Miss Pinkerton.\n\n\"The Inside Story\".\n\nThe Great Mistake.\n\n\"The Butler's Christmas Eve\".\n\nThe Swimming Pool.\n\nUpper floors are full of emotionally resonant locations: servant's quarters, bedrooms, storage areas, nurseries - places where all of peoples' lives take place.\n\nWater Landscapes\n\nWater landscapes play a role in:\n\nThe opening flood of The Case of Jennie Brice.\n\n\"The Confession\": a briefly seen pasture with brook.\n\nThe Red Lamp, with its boathouse, raised walkway over a salt marsh, bay and creek. The Wall.\n\n\"The Dog in the Orchard\": a simple culvert in the countryside.\n\n\"The Butler's Christmas Eve\".\n\nThe Swimming Pool.\n\n\"Murder and the South Wind\" and \"The Fishing Fool\", set in the Florida Keys,\n\nAnd in such Tish tales as \"Hijack and the Game\" and \"Strange Journey\".\n\nIndoor water areas which strictly speaking are not outdoor landscapes:\n\nThe Great Mistake has an indoor swimming pool as a key locale.\n\n\"Episode of the Wandering Knife\" has a fountain in the hall of the mansion.\n\nThe water landscapes can have a surreal quality.\n\nIn both The Case of Jennie Brice and The Red Lamp:\n\nArchitecture is closely associated with the water, and comes in immediate contact with it.\n\nWater rolls in under the architecture, and later moves out: flood water in The Case of Jennie Brice. tidal water under the boathouse on elevated piles in The Red Lamp (June 24th).\n\nPeople move on the water in boats.\n\nSee also the tiny spring in The Door (Chapter 8).\n\nThe Man in Lower Ten\n\nThe career of Mary Roberts Rinehart (1876-1957) can be broken up into a series of phases. The first was her pulp period (1904-1908), where she wrote her first three mystery novels and a mountain of very short stories. These short stories have never been collected in book form, and are inaccessible today.\n\nThe Man in Lower Ten (1906) and The Circular Staircase (1907) are the earliest works by any American author to be still in print as works of entertainment, not as \"classics\" or \"literature\". These novels, which combine mystery and adventure, show Rinehart's tremendously vivid powers as a storyteller.\n\nRinehart has been much and unfairly criticized for scenes in which her heroines wander alone in strange buildings at night. It is not only her women who do this, however: the male lawyer protagonist of The Man in Lower Ten also explores in the dark in that book's finale. What Rinehart was alive to was the poetic possibilities of the night and the dark. The night is always full of discoveries in Rinehart's work. The Man in Lower Ten is also one of the first novels to mention the subconscious (start of Chapter 23).\n\nSymbolism. The settings of these novels can be read as Freudian symbols as well: the train and steel mills of The Man in Lower Ten seem like male symbols, while the house with its circular staircase at its center symbolizes the female body. The two novels have male and female protagonists, respectively.\n\nIn \"Episode of the Wandering Knife\" phallic symbols used for display by a rich man are turned against him and used to frame him for murder. The phallic symbol train in The Man in Lower Ten encounters problems (Chapter 8).\n\nMale Bonding. The Man in Lower Ten (start of Chapter 12) pays tribute to \"the friendship between two men\". Male bonding will later play a role in The Afterhouse, and such late works as \"Test Blackout\", The Yellow Room, The Swimming Pool.\n\nArchitecture. Both novels include inventive buildings. They represent, at an early date, the interest in architecture that will later be common in Golden Age mystery fiction:\n\nThe adjoining roofs of the two houses, the low wall between them, and the roof-top trap doors in The Man in Lower Ten (Chapter 14).\n\nThe layout of the house's ground floor, with the special position of the card room, hall with circular staircase, and veranda in The Circular Staircase (Chapter 1).\n\nThe Man in Lower Ten includes a floor plan of part of the Pullman railroad car (Chapter 11). Such floor plans will later be popular in the Golden Age to come. In the first book publication (1909) this floor plan is hand drawn; in the 1947 omnibus edition Mary Roberts Rinehart's Mystery Book, this has been replaced by a diagram built up out of regular type. Both diagrams have equivalent content, however.\n\nThe Window at the White Cat\n\nRinehart also wrote a third, less successful novel during this period, The Window at the White Cat (1908). This story deals interestingly with civic corruption, a popular theme of early American mysteries. Stories like this anticipate the hard-boiled school to come. So does Rinehart's realistic style, which does not gloss over life's problems.\n\nThe mystery plot depends on some unfair coincidences. SPOILERS. A subplot looks throughout the novel as if it were closely related to the main mystery puzzle. At the end, the subplot turns out to be entirely unrelated: just a coincidence that happened at the same time.\n\nThe Valley of Oblivion: A short story\n\n\"The Valley of Oblivion\" (1908) is a compactly told short story. It was published the same month, February 1908, as The Window at the White Cat begin serialization in magazines. It was out of print for over 100 years, until Ramesh Chakrapani rediscovered a copy.\n\nLike The Window at the White Cat and The Case of Jennie Brice (1912), \"The Valley of Oblivion\" is a disappearance mystery.\n\n\"The Valley of Oblivion\" does not seem to be a mystery at first. Rather, it seems like a genteel romance tale, about a young woman and her romantic problems. But soon we learn that a character has mysteriously disappeared. This is a genuine mystery situation. However the tale never veers into the typical conventions of detective fiction. There are no police or professional detectives, no explorations of crime, no conventional suspense, danger or violence. Instead, the conventions of romance fiction are adhered to throughout.\n\nSPOILERS. The disappearance is indeed explained at the tale's end. The solution surprised me. Also surprising: it is the heroine who figures out the solution. She thus becomes the \"detective\" character in the tale. By contrast, the young man who loves her is a wonderful person, eager to give her love and support. But he is NOT the one who solves the mystery. There is perhaps a feminist implication, with a woman solving the mystery. This anticipates The Great Mistake, with the heroine's boyfriend being a fine person, but with the heroine doing detective work and the hero not at all.\n\nComic Stories and Tish 1909-1913\n\nRinehart also wrote some Broadway comedies. Seven Days (1909), written with the popular Broadway farceur Avery Hopwood, became a runaway hit. It is still hard to understand how an obscure Pittsburgh housewife could get her plays produced on Broadway, but it is not surprising that the public liked her writing.\n\nRinehart achieved success on Broadway and as a novelist almost simultaneously; for the next 45 years she would remain one of America's most popular authors. The immediate effect on her was a swerve into comic fiction for the next five years (1908-1913). She stopped appearing in the low paying pulps, and started to write for the commercially premier magazines. Much of her fiction during this period was in the form of long short stories. Her first sale to the Saturday Evening Post was \"The Borrowed House\" (1909), a long comic story about the wild adventures of some British suffragettes. Rinehart was a feminist, and marched for women's suffrage during this era.\n\nTish. The next year she created Tish, a middle aged spinster who would be the center of a series of comic long short stories for the next 30 years. Tish and her friends Aggie and Lizzie do all the things largely forbidden to the women of their time, race motor cars, pilot dirigibles, drive ambulances in World War I France, do stunt work in silent pictures and hunt for sharks and grizzly bears. Underneath the delightful comic surface of these tales is a brilliant feminist vision, and the series of five Tish books is a masterpiece of humor.\n\nMost of the finest Tish stories have been collected in an omnibus aptly titled The Best of Tish (1955). In fact, except for \"My Country Tish of Thee -\" (1916), all of the really good Tish stories are in this collection.\n\nNone of the stories in the first Tish collection, The Amazing Adventures of Letitia Carberry, made it into The Best of Tish, and in truth they are not as good as the later Tish tales.\n\nBab. Rinehart also wrote a book of long comic tales about a 17-year-old teenager Bab, Bab: A Sub-Deb (collected 1916). Bab is not quite old enough to be a debutante, so in the jargon of the 1910's, she's a \"sub-deb\". I found the Bab tales leaden, and nowhere as good as the Tish stories, when I read the book decades ago. But it is clear from the Internet that many people enjoy them. They were made into a series of movies, starring a very young Helen Hayes, no less, as Bab.\n\nThe Amazing Adventures of Letitia Carberry\n\nThe first Tish book The Amazing Adventures of Letitia Carberry opens with a untitled long novella. This story is untitled in the collection, Apparently it is the same as a magazine serial, \"The Amazing Adventure of Letitia Carberry\" (1911).\n\nHospital Mystery. It combines three strands of Rinehart's writing: it has a hospital and nursing background, it is a comic tale of Tish, and it also has mystery elements throughout. This mystery plot is atypical of the Tish stories, most of which are not constructed as mysteries.\n\nIt is perhaps noteworthy as an early example of a mystery involving a hospital and nurses, later a favorite setting of the Sarah Keate novels by Rinehart's follower Mignon G. Eberhart, and like them, full of spooky events at night.\n\nMystery Plot. It is an interesting curiosity, but not one of Rinehart's better mystery works, with some unexplained coincidences in the solution.\n\nThe plot has some affinities to Rinehart's novel, The Afterhouse (1913).\n\nBIG SPOILERS. The solution breaks down the line between humans and animals, fusing the two. One can find fusions of the animal and the human in the 1910's films of directors Louis Feuillade and Allan Dwan.\n\nSPOILERS. Tish will sit on a brass candlestick (Chapter 7), anticipating the mother sitting on the knife in \"Episode of the Wandering Knife\" (1943).\n\nMystery Writers. The story has a nice discussion of Conan Doyle's mystery technique (Chapter 4), one of the few homages in Rinehart's work to another mystery author. Later on, there are references to Edgar Allan Poe (Chapter 10).\n\nSee also:\n\nTales by Poe and Doyle are also referred to in The Curve of the Catenary.\n\nPoe's \"The Purloined Letter\" is referred to, although not by name, in \"Episode of the Wandering Knife\" (Chapter 10).\n\nPoe, Doyle and Émile Gaboriau are mentioned in The Man in Lower Ten (start of Chapter 5).\n\nArchitecture: Vertical. The novella benefits from its architectural detail. The opening setting has verticality, with both a staircase, followed by steps going up to a room (Chapter 1). More verticality appears in a room with a pipe part way up a wall, and a mysterious print on the wall (Chapter 4). And a fire-escape and skylight (Chapter 7), and an elevator (Chapters 17, 19). The elevator forms a climax to the story's architectural elements: it has the most complex form. And it moves. Tish rides the moving elevator (Chapter 17), perhaps anticipating later stories where she drives a racecar or pilots a balloon.\n\nProblems. The novella has serious problems. It is constructed as a mixture of horror and humor. The horror is grim, and just no fun to read about. The bad events that engulf likable nurse Ruth Blake are especially depressing (summarized in Chapter 19). Later tales about Tish will be much more comic and upbeat.\n\nA single-sentence description of a black man shows him doing things that are a racist stereotype (Chapter 19). This too is a serious problem.\n\nNurse Fiction\n\nRinehart wrote mysteries and hospital fiction as well in this period.\n\nLove Stories includes four fine stories dealing with nurses and hospital life, reflecting Rinehart's own training as a nurse. \"Jane\" and \"In the Pavilion\" are fairly comic, but most of the other tales are serious looks at nursing. Although most of the tales involve romance, they are not sappy, instead concentrating on the serious side of nursing as a profession.\n\nIn the Pavilion. \"In the Pavilion\" (1912) anticipates later Rinehart works:\n\nIt involves elements of wills and an inheritance of a big sum of money (Chapter 1). It's not a mystery. But this subject matter anticipates later Rinehart mysteries involving this subject: The Door, Miss Pinkerton.\n\nThe good food the nurse has on her supper tray (Chapter 1) anticipates the nurse-heroine's good food in \"The Buckled Bag\".\n\nThe confession the nurse hears from her patient (Chapter 3), anticipates the opening discussion of confessions to nurses in Miss Pinkerton.\n\nSPOILERS. Events in \"In the Pavilion\" (Chapter 4) anticipate the solution of \"The Buckled Bag\".\n\nThe pavilion where the story takes place, and the main hospital, are examples of the paired buildings in Rinehart.\n\n\"In the Pavilion\" was a source for the silent film The Glorious Fool (E. Mason Hopper, 1922), now apparently lost. It featured big star Richard Dix as the hero Billy Grant.\n\nSanctuary. Rinehart would write another nurse short story as late as \"Sanctuary\" (1936). The nurse in \"Sanctuary\" will have character elements recalling Rinehart's nurse-detective Miss Pinkerton.\n\nThe nurse lives in a \"small and dreary room\": presumably all she can afford on her salary as a working woman. This recalls working woman Florence Gunther's poverty-stricken room in The Door. Women were clearly not paid much, even after years of hard work.\n\nAnother nurse regards the heroine as \"queer\". One wonders if there is a gay subtext.\n\nThe Case of Jennie Brice\n\nFlood. Rinehart's mystery novella The Case of Jennie Brice (1912) opens with an imaginative description of a flood in a slum district in Pittsburgh (Chapters 1, 2, first part of 3).\n\nThe flood affects buildings, both inside and out. Rinehart's description of the flood is thus architectural, a favorite Rinehart interest. The flood description combines this with water, another major Rinehart subject.\n\nVictor Kalin did two excellent cover paintings, for two different American paperback editions of The Case of Jennie Brice. Both show the flood. They are atmospheric and architectural.\n\nThe landlady sets up a temporary kitchen on a higher floor, because her real kitchen is flooded. This anticipates scenes in The Yellow Room (Chapter 2), where the heroine and servants try to get the kitchen going again in the house shut-down by wartime and its rationing. Both have resourceful women trying to reestablish a cooking routine, in the midst of very difficult circumstances.\n\nRelated books:\n\nAnother mystery with a flood: Dead Man's Gift (1941) by Zelda Popkin.\n\nA flash flood in the Mohave Desert at the finale of Sally's in the Alley (1943) by Norbert Davis.\n\nWatching ordinary people navigate everywhere by boat, recalls a mainstream book, The Country of the Pointed Firs (1896) by Sarah Orne Jewett. However, Jewett's book deals with islanders, and Rinehart's is about a flood.\n\nFire. Fire, another Rinehart subject, appears with the burned pillow (Chapter 2). However, fire plays a small role in the story, compared to such late works as The Yellow Room and \"The Burned Chair\". All of these are indoor fires of limited scope: they do not damage or destroy whole buildings.\n\nSleuths. The rival sleuths, amateur Mr. Holcombe and newsman Mr. Howell, recall the rivalry between detectives Mr. Barnes and Robert Leroy Mitchel in Rodrigues Ottolengui.\n\nMystery Plot. The Case of Jennie Brice contains an archetypal mystery situation: when a wife in a bickering couple disappears, allegedly gone away on a visit, a neighbor suspects that the husband has actually murdered her. This is the \"Rear Window\" plot, made famous in that 1942 tale by Cornell Woolrich. In The Case of Jennie Brice, the suspicious person is the landlady who runs the boarding house where the couple stays.\n\nSPOILERS. The solution to The Case of Jennie Brice has both comic and tragic aspects. The comic aspects (Chapter 15) recall the comic solution to the disappearance subplot in The Window at the White Cat. However, the solution in The Case of Jennie Brice has spectacular features that go far beyond anything in The Window at the White Cat.\n\nPeriscope. The periscope is a fascinating development (Chapters 7, 8, 10). It anticipates the mirror surveillance device in the movie serial Judex (Louis Feuillade, 1916).\n\nThe periscope is perhaps loosely linked to the way the heroine of The Door can survey her house through \"lines of sight\" (Chapter 1) and a mirror (Chapter 2).\n\nLinks to The Door. Versions of characters in The Case of Jennie Brice will return in The Door (1930) - although they have different names and are not technically the same characters:\n\nThe landlady's relatives play a major role in the story: her young niece, the niece's boyfriend reporter Mr. Howell, and the niece's domineering, wealthy snobbish mother, who wants to break up the romance because Mr. Howell is poor. Versions of these three characters will return in The Door. So will the way the narrator tries to assist the romance, by offering her home as a secret meeting place for the young lovers.\n\nA rooming house, its manager and residents will also appear in The Door.\n\nBlack servants appear in both novels.\n\nA policeman and a district attorney are involved in the case in both books.\n\nBoth books have dogs.\n\nPlot events are shared by the two books:\n\nProblems in identifying a disfigured corpse feature in both The Case of Jennie Brice (start of Chapter 9, end of Chapter 14) and The Door (Chapter 8).\n\nThe Case of Jennie Brice and The Door both have extensive trial scenes in their later chapters.\n\nSociety and Class. The landlady heroine, her boarders and friends are mainly people without much money. They certainly seem poor. However, few of them seem to be typical members of the working class, such as factory workers, dock laborers or office clerks. Instead, they seem to be be more \"white collar people in low-paying professions\": the theatrical people who are the main denizens of her boarding house, a young reporter, a schoolteacher. These are (very) lower middle class, rather than the proletariat.\n\nConsequently, The Case of Jennie Brice does not really build up a portrait of the poor or the working class.\n\nTwo young women eventually make appearances, who are more working class: farm woman Eliza Schaeffer (Chapter 10) and stenographer Alice Murray (Chapter 13). Both are self-employed businesswomen, with very small businesses: Schaeffer sells chicks from her farm to poultry raisers, Murray is a self-employed stenographer who works from home and who takes on small jobs for customers. These are both working class, and proprietors of small businesses. Schaeffer also works as postmistress of her small town. And Timothy Senft has a very small business selling dishes from his shanty-boat (Chapter 8). The landlady herself is a poor woman running a small business, her boarding house.\n\nEllery Queen will later use a similar approach, with \"typical working Americans\" in his tales usually being lower middle class people with small businesses, rather than factory workers.\n\nThe Case of Jennie Brice opens with a brief description of the Pittsburgh \"railroad riots\" of 1877. The words \"strike\", \"labor\" and \"union\" are not mentioned, and no references to unions occur in The Case of Jennie Brice. And although Pittsburgh is a major center of industry, we do not see railroad workers or factory employees in the novel.\n\nI am not trying to condemn The Case of Jennie Brice. I enjoyed reading about these theater people, newsmen and \"poor entrepreneurs without money\" like Schaeffer, Murray and Senft that populate the book. They are a colorful bunch. Perhaps Rinehart thought they were more entertaining than the typical working poor. Still, we do not see steel mill workers, men in railroad yards, office clerks or cleaning ladies scrubbing floors in The Case of Jennie Brice: the actual bulk of the working poor of Pittsburgh.\n\nMuch sympathy is expressed in The Case of Jennie Brice for people from \"good families\" who have declined into poor-paying jobs, such as the landlady and reporter Mr. Howell. Little sympathy is expressed for life-long members of the working class or the poor.\n\nHerbert Spencer. The right-wing philosopher Herbert Spencer is mentioned (end of Chapter 7). However, it is not his views on politics that are cited, but on cause-and-effect.\n\nMr. Holcombe is typical of the self-taught amateur intellectuals who were especially attracted to Herbert Spencer's writings. Spencer was a huge best-seller in the 19th Century. He was perhaps already in decline with the public in 1912.\n\nAn influence from Doyle?. Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes tale \"The Adventure of the Red Circle\" (1911) has some vague similarities to The Case of Jennie Brice (1912):\n\nBoth have a landlady curious about a mystery involving a tenant.\n\nHolmes uses a mirror to study people unseen; a periscope with mirrors is used to watch people in The Case of Jennie Brice.\n\nTo have been influenced by \"The Adventure of the Red Circle\" (1911), Rinehart would have had to have read it in its initial magazine appearance in 1911. This is not too unlikely: the Holmes tales had a huge readership.\n\nThe Afterhouse\n\nThe Afterhouse (1913) is mainly a minor work: one of Rinehart's least interesting books.\n\nMystery Plot. Among the biggest problems of The Afterhouse is the lack of mystery plot ingenuity. The Afterhouse is indeed a murder mystery: there is a killing by an unknown person, then at the book's end we learn whodunit. But there is very little more to the mystery puzzle, with few complicating features.\n\nAnd there is little actual detective work. The Afterhouse lacks a strong detective figure. The hero takes a few simple precautions to protect evidence. But he never figures out much about the mystery.\n\nPerhaps the lack of mystery plot features or detective work is deliberate. The Afterhouse might be designed more to be a suspense novel, rather than primarily a mystery. However, this does not make the book better or more interesting.\n\nMale Bonding. Among the most appealing aspects of The Afterhouse is the friendship between the hero and McWhirter (Chapters 1, 23, 24). This is a friendship between equals: both are the same age, both have just graduated from medical school, both are equally broke-but-industrious young men. Rinehart will return to idealized male bonding between the hero and friends in The Yellow Room.\n\nLeaders?. Unfortunately, this friendship, while showing the virtue of loyalty, has a questionable aspect. The friend idolizes the hero, and thinks the hero should be a leader of men, especially in a military context (Chapter 1). Later, the hero is shown acclaimed by the working class ship-crew as a natural leader, someone they want in charge of them (Chapter 7, middle of Chapter 9). This comes uncomfortably close to the leadership cults developed around sinister dictators like Hitler and Stalin. One also wonders if working class men like the crew \"naturally\" want men from middle class families like the hero bossing them. Especially as they are experienced seamen and he is not. Perhaps this is just propaganda for class hierarchies.\n\nRacism. The Afterhouse is blatantly racist in its treatment of the black butler on-board ship. And dubious and questionable in its portrait of a Jewish lawyer. These are major flaws, that cause me not to recommend it.\n\nThe Papered Door: a short story\n\n\"The Papered Door\" (1914) is a crime thriller short story. It has no mystery plot, being more a \"tale of suspense\" than a \"mystery story\". I didn't like it. There are SPOILERS in this discussion.\n\nUnhappy Marriages. The heroine of \"The Papered Door\" sticks by her criminal husband no matter what. He is thoroughly rotten, but she is mindlessly loyal to him anyway. The tale itself critiques this point of view, with a lawman friend of hers arguing she would be better off without him. Her loyalty makes \"The Papered Door\" a depressing read.\n\n\"The Papered Door\" is an early example in Rinehart of an unhappy marriage, caused by a spouse shackled to a difficult or downright bad partner. Later mainstream tales Rinehart wrote, such as A Light in the Window (1947) and mainstream short stories in Married People, often look at such failed marriages. \"The Papered Door\" shows that Rinehart explored this subject as far back as 1914. \"The Papered Door\" anticipates A Light in the Window in showing the pain a husband's adulteries cause his wife.\n\n\"The Papered Door\" makes a bitter, perhaps feminist claim. It says children, especially girls, are \"born only to suffer\". And that \"Boys grew into men\" and \"Violent, horrible things happened, because they were men.\"\n\nArchitecture. We can have some polite applause for the subplot about the door of the title. This shows Rinehart's interest in architecture. \"The Papered Door\" recalls The Circular Staircase in featuring a hidden room.\n\nThe title \"The Papered Door\" anticipates the title of Rinehart's The Door. But their plots are not close.\n\n\"The Papered Door\" got the cover of Collier's magazine on its first publication. The well-done cover shows the papered door of the title.\n\nFilm Version. \"The Papered Door\" was made into a 1915 silent film. Its star Ruth Stonehouse also made in 1915 a film of The Alster Case (1914) by Rufus Gillmore. Ruth Stonehouse was a prolific actress who also sometimes got to write and direct films.\n\nMiss Pinkerton and Scientific Detection\n\nRinehart would combine her hospital and mystery fiction, in two long short stories. \"The Buckled Bag\" (1914) and \"Locked Doors\" (1914) introduce Hilda Adams, a nurse who does undercover work for the police and who is popularly known as Miss Pinkerton. \"The Buckled Bag\" piles mystery on mystery before the satisfying resolution; it is one of Rinehart's most perfect works. \"Locked Doors\" is not as good, but it contains some powerful imagery and plot ideas.\n\nRinehart's Miss Pinkerton nurse detective has affinities with the scientific detectives of Freeman and Arthur B. Reeve, then at the height of their popularity. Both of these stories deal with medical subjects.\n\n\"The Buckled Bag\" and \"Locked Doors\" were included in a large Rinehart collection in 1925. This made them widely available in book form. One suspects they might have influenced the nurse-detective tales Mignon G. Eberhart wrote starting in the later 1920's. The two tales are also included in an omnibus entitled Miss Pinkerton (1959), the easiest place to find them today. It is in this volume that I read them.\n\nThe Buckled Bag. The heroine's decision to become a detective (Chapter 1) recalls the heroine's famous declaration of loving her adventure, at the end of The Circular Staircase.\n\nSPOILERS. The strange apparition of a hand on the staircase in \"The Buckled Bag\" (near the start of Chapter 3) will return in:\n\nA shooting from a staircase in The Bat.\n\nThe intruder's feet seen on the staircase in The Door (end of Chapter 2).\n\n\"The Buckled Bag\" begins with philosophical reflection. Such an opening passage returns in The Door.\n\n\"The Buckled Bag\" goes on to tell how nurse Hilda Adams met detective Patton, how she got her detective job from him, and her first case. It is thus what comic books would later call an \"origin story\".\n\nThe Curve of the Catenary\n\nRinehart produced a long novella, The Curve of the Catenary (1916), which also is centered on scientific mystery. The ingenious story is one of Rinehart's few excursions into impossible crime, along with Haunted Lady (1942).\n\nSociety. It also has some strong left-wing criticism of social organization, with a depiction of the exploitation of the working class, and their appalling living conditions. This is quite unusual for the normally Republican Rinehart.\n\nThe story looks at the somewhat wild social life of the upper classes, which are beginning to resemble the Jazz Age to come, in the 1920's. In this it resembles the title story of Arthur B. Reeve's The Social Gangster (1915).\n\nLike \"The Sixth Sense\" (1915) in Reeve's collection, Rinehart's story offers a vivid look at the period in which American life was increasing bound up with the war raging in Europe, even though America was still neutral in the conflict.\n\nHidden Situation. Some of Rinehart's scientific mysteries, such as \"Locked Doors\", the late Miss Pinkerton novella \"The Secret\", and The Curve of the Catenary, share a common structural approach. In these, something strange and mysterious is going on - but what? The reader is challenged to figure out some underlying situation that is hidden from view. In these stories, the situation has a scientific basis. There are also non-scientific Rinehart puzzlers, such as The Circular Staircase and The Swimming Pool, which also center around hidden situations, although in these novels, the situations are not science-oriented. In all of these mysteries, the hidden situation is more important than who did the crime, or alibis or clues pointing to some culprit. There are also some hidden situations, less central, but still playing a role in their novel's plot mix, in such works as The Album and The Great Mistake.\n\nThis \"hidden situation\" approach has some consequences. One the one hand, the stories are built around genuine mysteries, with the reader constantly being challenged to figure out the mysterious situation behind the tale's events. On the other hand, it removes Rinehart from the type of mystery story practiced by G. K. Chesterton, Christie, Carr and Queen, in which individual suspects and their ability to commit a crime are paramount. This structural difference between Rinehart and more mainstream authors of detective fiction is at least as significant in defining Rinehart's approach, as are the Had I But Known aspects of Rinehart's writing.\n\nThe hidden situation also enables some unusual treatment of characters not found in other authors. Since many Rinehart books are built around a Big Secret, it is possible to define characters in terms of their relationship to the secret. Did they cause the secret situation? Did they learn about it, and are now trying to cover it up to protect someone? Have they discovered some secret clue to the hidden situation, and are now trying to track down the truth? Characters have all these sorts of secret knowledge of the hidden situation in Rinehart. The narrator soon realizes that the characters are concealing something - but what they are concealing does not come out till the end of the tale, or at least, the second half of the story.\n\nBlackout. The failure of the electrical power grid, plunging the city into blackout, recalls the way the electric company turns out the power after a curfew time in The Circular Staircase. Both situations cause characters to wander around in darkness: a favorite Rinehart situation.\n\nSource. The sole easily available source today of The Curve of the Catenary is a 1939 anthology, The Mystery Book. One suspects that Rinehart might (or might not) have revised this version, from the original magazine appearance (which I have not seen).\n\nMainstream Fiction 1914-1929\n\nAt this point (1914), Rinehart's writing and career drastically changed. Rinehart largely gave up mystery and humorous fiction, and turned to straight novels instead, for most of the next 15 years. Her novels were commercially hugely successful, but critically slammed. While inoffensive morally, critics felt they represented lowbrow popular fiction.\n\nAccording to her biographer Jan Cohn, Rinehart often suffered horribly from depression during these years. Her husband Dr. Stanley Rinehart bitterly resented his wife's commercial success. He seems to have used his medical degree and general intellectual skills as a weapon to demonstrate his mental superiority to his wife, the trashy author of popular fiction, and pushed her to write \"serious literary works\". By contrast, Rinehart had a happy relationship with her three sons. Motherhood is always depicted in glowing terms in Rinehart's fiction, although often shown to be very hard work, while marriage is an unmitigated horror story. Husbands are always shown to be male chauvinist pigs who are cold hearted, philanderers, men intolerant of their wife's career, who have to have their own ways in the smallest details. The best of these mainstream tales are from the 1930's and in the collection Married People. Rinehart also wrote a number of powerful tales about wife beating long before it became a feminist issue in the 1980's.\n\nSight Unseen\n\nRinehart also wrote two fusions of supernatural-psychical research fiction and mystery fiction, \"Sight Unseen\" (1916) and The Red Lamp (1925), which are among the author's lesser works.\n\nAs early as \"The Amazing Adventure of Letitia Carberry\" (1911), Rinehart was talking about spiritualism in her mysteries, but in that story it is just a red herring - no actual supernatural events occur. Spiritualism is treated comically there, but with dead seriousness in \"Sight Unseen\" and The Red Lamp.\n\nSociety. \"Sight Unseen\" opens with a look at the group holding the seance. These are a group of middle-aged friends, who regularly gather to discuss politics, the arts, and anything else they find interesting. They are far from Bohemian: they are a group of upper middle class residents of an upscale, if conventional, neighborhood. Their group, dubbed the Neighborhood Club, resembles today's library book clubs and discussion groups. They are at once more intellectual and more middle class, than some of the Society types common in Rinehart novels. I found Rinehart's account interesting, and wish it extended beyond the opening (Chapter 1). I also wish Rinehart had written about such people more often.\n\nWe learn briefly that one of the members is a doctor, who is concerned with \"the responsibility of the state to the sick poor\" (Chapter 1). This echoes the social consciousness of The Curve of the Catenary. However, \"Sight Unseen\" does not delve as deeply into such matters as The Curve of the Catenary.\n\nThe narrator Horace, a member of Neighborhood Club, is interested in city politics. This recalls The Window at the White Cat.\n\nThe murder victim and the suspects come from a different milieu than the Neighborhood Club. They are younger, looser in morals, go to dances. They recall the a bit the fairly wild pre-Jazz Age types in The Curve of the Catenary.\n\nThe Confession\n\nRinehart did write some mystery and humorous fiction during these years. The crime story novella \"The Confession\" (1917) is a grim but powerful portrait of a woman's guilt, depression and mental breakdown. It is not pleasant reading, but has brilliant atmosphere and mise-en-scène.\n\nLinks to The Circular Staircase. The opening premise of \"The Confession\" recalls that of Rinehart's The Circular Staircase. Both have:\n\nA middle-aged heroine renting a country house for the summer, getting more than she bargained for with a mystery surrounding the house.\n\nMysterious intruders in the house at night.\n\nA woman servant to the heroine who makes a lot of comments.\n\nA playboy male relative of the owners of the house.\n\nMystery Plot. \"The Confession\" is also a mystery, although an unconventional one. The heroine Agnes Blakiston and her maid Maggie do most of the tale's detection.\n\nThere are two explanations to the mysterious events of the early chapters:\n\nThe maid gives an ingenious explanation of the phone calls that later turns out to be incorrect (Chapter 2). It is clever, though.\n\nThe true explanation is revealed when the characters find the document (Chapter 2).\n\nSPOILERS. While Martin Sprague is wrong about most things, he does have one accurate insight. He explains the telephone calls as spying on the heroine by means of the phone (Chapter 2, after finding the document). This is a fairly clever explanation of the phone calls.\n\nSome of the above ideas have technological dimensions. We also get a look at the phone as machinery (Chapter 2). All of this brings \"The Confession\" into the realm of Scientific Detection.\n\nAnticipating The Red Lamp. A document, in this case a letter, is also discovered in a house in The Red Lamp (Chapter entitled June 27th). The letter found in The Red Lamp has sinister information in it, like the document in \"The Confession\".\n\nThroughout the story, the heroine keeps referencing her journal, and giving dates from it for when things happened. This anticipates The Red Lamp, much of which consists of the hero's journal, and the dated entries it contains. The succession of dated events forms a backbone for the story, in both works.\n\nLinks to other Rinehart. The Case of Jennie Brice opens with a brief mention of a basement fruit-closet: a place that people used to store home-canned fruit and similar items. Such a fruit-closet plays a bigger role in \"The Confession\".\n\nLine of Sight. Maggie observes Miss Benton's activities in a mirror, without Miss Benton's realizing she is being watched (near the end of Chapter 1). This is a line of sight: what Maggie can see when she is standing in a certain place. Such lines of sight return in The Door.\n\nArchitecture. As soon as the heroine tells how much she hates the phone calls, she also admits she hates the back hall corner where the phone is located (Chapter 1). This brings that Rinehart favorite, architecture, into the atmosphere around the phone.\n\nThe heroine also says that she dislikes having to go downstairs at night to answer the phone calls. In a simple way, this is an example of the vertical architecture that runs through Rinehart's works.\n\nWater Landscape. Early on, the heroine says she rented the house, in part because she liked a nearby pasture with a brook in it. However, this pasture is never referred to again, and plays no role in the mystery.\n\nTelephone. \"The Confession\" has interesting comments on the telephone, considered as both technology and an institution. As the tale points out, the phone is this country household's only point of contact with the outside world. 1917 was too early for most people to have radio, let alone TV or the Internet. A few wealthy financiers had telegraph lines in the home, and ticker tapes, but most regular Americans did not.\n\nWillie says the phone is the women's only source of \"news,\" too. He must be referring to local news. The women do have access to an evening newspaper, we learn later, which presumably has national and world events.\n\nNerve Specialist. The young \"nerve specialist\" Martin Sprague in \"The Confession\" is close to what we today would call a psychiatrist. His explanations about repressed memories seem distinctly Freudian, although Freud is not explicitly mentioned.\n\nThe nerve specialist's ideas about the mystery are wrong, wrong, wrong. He keeps coming up with explanations that deny anything real is going on, suggesting instead that women are imagining things (middle of Chapter 1, middle of Chapter 2). He keeps saying it is all in the head of various (female) characters. Such shrink characters will pop up later in countless books, movies and TV shows. \"The Confession\" is an example of such a character at an early date.\n\nThere is perhaps a feminist subtext, with a male authority figure constantly denying that women's experiences are real or serious.\n\nSexuality. \"The Confession\" is remarkably explicit when describing the characters' sex lives. It uses polite euphemisms, that get past censors. But it describes what is going on with the characters in unmistakable terms.\n\nElderly Miss Benton is clearly a virgin. She is described early on as \"unspotted\". Later people say she is \"still at heart a girl\".\n\nThe brother is a sexually indulgent roue. He dies of paresis (he is called \"paretic\" in the middle of Chapter 2). While that medical condition has many possible causes today, largely non-sexual, in 1917 it was most associated with men dying of untreated syphilis.\n\nNursing. Miss Benton spends much of her life nursing sick relatives. \"The Confession\" says she should of been having children, instead. This nursing is seen as an activity that exploits Miss Benton, and robs her of a normal life.\n\nRinehart trained as a nurse, and nurses run through her fiction. \"The Confession\" offers a negative look at nursing, especially when it is done by unpaid relatives pressured into the role.\n\nCheap Rent. The house is offered to the heroine at amazingly cheap rent, to lure her into taking it. The reader is far more suspicious of this, than is the guileless heroine. This sort of gambit will recur in later mysteries, often humorous ones:\n\n\"The Adventure of the Cheap Flat\" (1923) by Agatha Christie.\n\nThe April Robin Murders (1958) by Craig Rice.\n\nNostalgia for High Society. \"The Confession\" occasionally reminiscences about the old days, when Miss Benton was a leader of High Society in her town. Such memories of a High Society past will recur in more elaborate forms in The Swimming Pool. In both works they are ambiguous: it is unclear at first whether the old way of life is good or bad.\n\nThe Bat\n\nThe Bat (1917-1920) is a stage adaptation of Rinehart's The Circular Staircase, written in collaboration with Avery Hopwood, the writer of popular Broadway comedies with whom Rinehart had collaborated before. The Bat introduced some new plot complexities into the original novel, especially a master criminal known as The Bat. It also includes plot elements reminiscent of her first Post story, \"The Borrowed House\" (1909). The Bat shows Rinehart at the height of her powers, and in fact is her greatest work. A work of great formal complexity, The Bat is one of the few mystery stage plays to have the dense plotting of a Golden Age detective novel. Moreover, the formal properties of the stage medium are completely interwoven with the mystery plot, to form intricate, beautiful patterns of plot and staging of dazzling complexity.\n\nRinehart and Hopwood's play can be found in the anthology Famous Plays of Crime and Detection (1946), edited by Van H. Cartmell and Bennett Cerf, along with other outstanding plays of its era. (This book also contains good plays by Roi Cooper Megrue, Elmer Rice, George M. Cohan, and John Willard.) In 1926, a novelization of The Bat appeared, apparently written by poet Stephen Vincent Benét with little input from Rinehart. This novel version usually appears in paperback under Rinehart's name, without any mention of Hopwood or Benét. I read this novelized version first, and confess I prefer it to the script of the play itself.\n\nGender. Many sleuths in traditional detective fiction stand outside of the world of heterosexuality. The same is true of those in the novel version of The Bat:\n\nHeroine Cornelia Van Gorder is explicitly a spinster (start of Chapter 2).\n\nThe \"great detective\" Anderson shows no signs of any woman companion. Instead, he wants to avenge a male colleague who was his friend, and who was killed by the Bat (Chapter 1).\n\nEven the Bat himself, is depicted as a criminal without a moll (Chapter 1).\n\nThe Arts. Cornelia has experienced \"the world of art and books\" over her lifetime (start of Chapter 2). This interest in the arts is not something one associates with Rinehart heroines. Only in Rinehart's last novel The Swimming Pool do we have a writer heroine.\n\nThe Bat Tokens. The Bat \"signs\" his crimes, by leaving behind a small piece of bat imagery (Chapter 1). Rinehart and Hopwood were hardly the first writers to use such a gambit. Robert Sampson, in his history of pulp fiction Yesterday's Faces, attributes this approach to Frank L. Packard. Packard's The Adventures of Jimmie Dale (1914-1915) has his gentleman thief leave behind small gray seals to sign his crimes; the thief is known as The Gray Seal to the press. This device clearly spread, as Sampson pointed out, from Packard to other pulp writers.\n\nIn The Adventures of Jimmie Dale one of the hero's secret identities is an underworld character called \"Larry the Bat\". This might be the origin of the name of Rinehart and Hopwood's the Bat.\n\nFilm Versions. Film director Roland West made two versions of the play, a silent film The Bat (1926), and a sound film The Bat Whispers (1930). The link leads to a discussion of West's film techniques.\n\nLater Tish stories\n\nWhile working on The Bat, Rinehart wrote her best Tish story. \"Salvage\" (1919) details the middle aged trio's attempt to rescue Tish's nephew from battle while working as ambulance drivers in World War I France. It has many autobiographical elements; Rinehart was active as a war correspondent for much of the war (1914-1918), and used her occupation to make a similar if less successful attempt to rescue her own son from the fighting. (All three of her sons did survive the war). The brilliant lunacy of this story and its underlying powerful emotionalism mark it as one of her most creative works.\n\nOther Tish stories of the Twenties are memorable, especially \"Tish Plays The Game\" (1921) and \"The Baby Blimp\" (1922), which get the ladies involved in athletics and Hollywood stunt work, respectively. Tish had previously encountered the film industry in \"My Country Tish of Thee -\" (1916), where a crew is filming in Glacier Park at the same time Tish is taking a vacation there. Tish expresses strong reservations about the moral character of 1916 motion pictures, in a way that eerily echoes today's anti-film moralists.\n\n\"Hijack and the Game\" (1925) involves our heroines in bootleg booze smuggling, and is not as good. But the passages dealing with life on the water are surrealistically inventive, like the opening flood sequences of The Case of Jennie Brice (1912).\n\n\"Hijack and the Game\" reflects Rinehart's real life enthusiasm for wilderness vacations. This story recycles to good effect some ideas Rinehart first used in a less successful earlier Tish tale, \"Tish's Spy\" (1915). Both stories:\n\nInvolve the trio with a young, ultra-modern heroine.\n\nShow the middle aged trio and the heroine on vacation in some remote wooded area, in Canada and Maine respectively.\n\nBoth vacation areas involve a lot of water and boating sequences.\n\nGive the heroine a boyfriend who tags along incognito.\n\nInnocently involve the trio in illegal activities.\n\n\"Tish's Spy\" has problems, in that it depicts the trio as a bunch of bumblers; this is not the sort of characterization we want to see of them. By contrast, \"Hijack and the Game\" has a warm, good natured feeling throughout. Its storytelling is also better.\n\nRinehart is inventive contrasting the maiden ladies with the young Flapper; the comparisons are often unexpected. It is a sort of woman's inside point of view on both roles. Both women have different kinds of freedoms. The Flapper can defy Victorian taboos. But the maiden ladies often can ignore conventions of gender, and dress in gender neutral clothes and do as they please, something that the femininity-obsessed Flapper cannot. There are feminist opportunities in both roles, and Rinehart enjoys seeing women take advantage of both.\n\nRinehart published her last Tish stories in 1936-1937. The best is \"Strange Journey\", whose ocean setting once again unleashes a surrealistic streak in Rinehart's imagination.\n\nThe Red Lamp\n\nThe Red Lamp (1925) is a combination of supernatural-psychical research fiction and mystery fiction. This is a combination Rinehart had previously essayed in \"Sight Unseen\" (1916).\n\nThe Red Lamp is an uneven book. Its best feature: Its first half (up through the Chapter titled August 5th) often makes absorbing reading, with good storytelling. It features a Rinehart strength: water landscapes. The well-done landscape sections also are the main parts that advance the mystery plot.\n\nWeaknesses include a mystery solution with many problems, as discussed below.\n\nAnd the relentless promotion of the supernatural is hard to take, for non-believers in the supernatural like myself. The book can seem like a long commercial promoting dubious ideas about the supernatural and psychic phenomena.\n\nShould you read The Red Lamp? Ultimately, I decided not to include the book in the Recommended Works at the start of this article. It has too many liabilities: a boring second half, a dubious solution, and all that promotion of the supernatural. Still, the first half is often interesting.\n\nLandscape. The area around the house and its seashore is an interestingly detailed landscape. So is the bay as a whole. Both areas are examples of a Rinehart specialty: water landscape. Rinehart keeps extending these two landscapes throughout the story, adding more detail (Introduction, the Chapters titled June 22, June 24, June 26, June 28, June 30, July 2nd, July 6th, July 8th, July 11th, July 15th, July 31st, August 1st, August 5th).\n\nOther landscapes, inland and far from the sea, involve various attacks. One includes a culvert (July 14th, 16th). A second landscape has clues (July 22, July 25). Both areas are investigated, after their introduction. This too makes them sites of ongoing development, like the water landscapes.\n\nLandscape sections are also often episodes that advance the mystery-and-crime plot of the book. This makes them doubly interesting. Rinehart would use a similar \"architecture and landscape combined with plotting\" approach in The Swimming Pool.\n\nBy contrast, most of the supernatural or psychic aspects of the novel are NOT closely linked to landscape. This is fine by me. It means that these excellent landscape sections combine two things I admire, landscape and mystery plotting, and are mainly free of something I despise, the supernatural.\n\nArchitecture. Rinehart keeps the architecture simple, concentrating on landscape instead. But the book immediately calls attention to the two most important rooms in the house, the den and library (Introduction). They are different by being older than the rest of the house. And they are the locus of mystery in the house. The old vs new parts of the house are some of the paired spaces that run through Rinehart.\n\nThe Gun Room. The gun room is also an interesting place (Introduction). It is at the end of a series of rooms, like the title staircase in The Circular Staircase. Rinehart seemed to find such series of rooms interesting - and I do too.\n\nThe gun room is mainly seen from outside the house. People enter the house from outdoors, through the gun room window (see the Chapters titled July 27th and August 10th). In effect, this makes the gun room window part of the outdoor landscape, in the broad sense of the term. The same is true of various verandas on the outside of houses, where people sit outdoors.\n\nMystery Plot: Suspects. The Red Lamp is constructed so that there are few, if any, obvious suspects. Suspects only emerge with difficulty throughout the course of the plot. The lack of any apparent suspect is one feature that makes the case difficult to solve. And the cases that are eventually built up against various suspects show some ingenuity - they are far from obvious.\n\nOn can contrast this with the numerous mysteries in which a circle of suspects is known from the start. For example, the book known as Dumb Witness or Poirot Loses A Client (1937) by Agatha Christie. The six suspects are the people who benefit under the wills made by the wealthy victim. Both the reader and detective Hercule Poirot know who these suspects are almost from the start of the story.\n\nMystery Plot: Solution. BIG SPOILERS in this section.\n\nThe cleverest part of the solution is the identity of the criminal. This is well-concealed. The concealment is part of the \"paucity of suspects\" aspect than runs throughout the novel.\n\nOther aspects of the solution are a mess. Motivation is thin. The sheep killings turn out to be something the killer did just to distract and confuse. So they are not explained logically, or given any interesting reason.\n\nAnd Uncle Horace's demise, often investigated as a murder throughout the book, turns out to have been caused by illness instead. This is an anti-climax. So it and the sheep killings, the tale's most dramatic mysteries, turn out to have nothing behind them.\n\nThe Lamp. The red lamp often glows with an eerie red light. This is associated with supernatural elements in the tale. Lights show up in the crime plot, too. Even though I'm not a supernatural fan, lights make interesting imagery. So do their color aspects.\n\nThe effects recall a bit the imagery in William Hope Hodgson.\n\nWhere Is the Story Set?. The Red Lamp is set somewhere on the Eastern seacoast of the United States. Beyond that, it is hard to say. Young Halliday has a job in Boston waiting for him when he graduates from law school (June 30th). This would be most plausible if the tale were set in New England or maybe New York. The very traditional university where the narrator teaches sounds vaguely Ivy League, also consistent with New England / New York / New Jersey.\n\nThere is no regional \"local color\" in The Red Lamp. The characters have standard American names, that could be anywhere in the US.\n\nThe setting is clearly NOT the South. The race of the characters is not specified: meaning, according to the dubious convention of the times, that they are all white.\n\nEducation. Rinehart paints a negative picture of literary education at the hero's university (June 16th). He teaches English literature. The Red Lamp shows him trying to teach this subject to bored, uninterested undergrads. It seems futile. One gets the impression that the students are upper class, sociologically elite young men from the Best Families, who are bored by school.\n\nIn fact, nothing good or productive seems to be coming out of this university. The professors don't seem to do any research, and the students don't seem to learn much. Nor is America as a whole shown doing anything worthwhile. The working class farmers and servants work hard, but seem to have no interests other than promoting superstition. The hero's wife spends her copious free time sewing and taking routine photos. Young Halliday has nothing to look forward to but a low-paying starter job. It's a dismal portrait, far from the Roaring Twenties image we have today of this era.\n\nOne can contrast this view of \"education as pointless in an Ivy-League-ish school\" with Sinclair Lewis' enthusiastic depiction of education in a Midwestern state university in Arrowsmith (1925). Lewis' gung-ho fictional state \"University of Winnemac\" is explicitly contrasted with upper class Harvard, which Lewis depicts as an anemic \"select college for young gentlemen\". As a State school, Winnemac would attract far more lower class students than Harvard or the university in The Red Lamp.\n\nThe undergrads in The Red Lamp are bored even by famous writers like Milton and Coleridge. By contrast the students in Arrowsmith are energetically studying far more obscure subjects like Provencal poetry, Sanskrit and Matthew Arnold. More power to them!\n\nThe Return to Mystery Fiction 1930-1953\n\nThe founding of her sons' publishing house, Farrar and Rinehart, in 1929, and her need to provide commercial books for them to publish; the advent of the Depression in that same year; and the death of her husband in 1932 all conspired to influence Rinehart to write much more mystery fiction during the last 25 years of her career. In my judgment, this was all well and good, even if her work was sometimes uneven.\n\nThe Door\n\nMary Roberts Rinehart's return to the mystery field, is The Door (1930). It has a some good opening writing (Chapters 1, end of 2, 3, 4, 5, second half of 7, 8) and a few later good sections.\n\nProblems. The Wall and The Yellow Room, while imperfect, are considerably better than The Door. They benefit from:\n\nA good setting in a Maine resort community, while The Door is in a generic unnamed \"city of over half a million\" people (middle of Chapter 8) that never comes alive. (This size city is consistent with Pittsburgh, Rinehart's home base.)\n\nInteresting detectives, while policeman Inspector Harrison in The Door is standard issue, without personality.\n\nBetter heroines. Elizabeth Jane Bell in The Door is a bore who never does anything interesting.\n\nAnnoyingly, if most of the victims had simply spoken up, the crimes could have been prevented. They could simply have told what they knew to the police, a lawyer or a clergyman. Rinehart herself points this out (start of Chapter 6).\n\nHoward, Katherine, Wallie and Judy in The Door are a rich dysfunctional family who make me want to flee to the hills every time they show up. At least Howard works for a living, which is more than you can say for any of the other upper class characters in The Door.\n\nThe rest of the article will be about the novel's positive accomplishments.\n\nAmateur Detectives. On the positive side, Judy and Katherine do good work as amateur detectives in various sections: Judy in part of the Florence Gunther investigation (Chapter 11), Katherine throughout the will subplot. Both Judy and Katherine shows persistence in their detective work, in face of discouragement: something the book finds admirable.\n\nArchitecture and Landscape. As is often the case in Rinehart, architecture and landscape are among the best features of The Door.\n\nThe opening gives an interesting look at the architecture of the house (Chapters 1, end of 2, 3, 4). Like The Album to come, the architecture has a 3D quality, with the vertical dimension being stressed, along with the two horizontal ones. See: the well over the lavatory, the staircase. The landscape outside the house also has vertical dimensions, with a ravine located behind the house.\n\nA housemaid's closet opens into the well (Chapter 3). A housemaid's closet will also play a role in The Album. Both closets are in upper floors of the house.\n\nLike The Album and The Wall, the grounds surrounding the house play key roles in the mystery. In The Wall, these surrounding areas are aquatic. In The Door and The Album they are dry land.\n\nThe opening of The Door stresses lines of sight: what one can see in the house from certain points of view. These \"lines of sight\" are closely linked to the architecture. These \"lines of sight\" fascinated me, when I first read The Door as a child.\n\nThe heroine uses the house's speaking tubes to conduct an audio surveillance of the house (last part of Chapter 22). This is like the \"lines of sight\", only dealing with sound rather than vision.\n\nThe sewer entrance (Chapter 5) recalls the culvert in The Red Lamp. Both are dramatic features in outdoor landscapes. Both have large openings that allow people to enter.\n\nThe well in the mansion over the bathroom, the sewer entrance and the speaking tubes can all be seen as female symbols. All are linked to the mansion. By contrast, the hotel architecture in the will subplot doesn't seem to have any female symbolism. (The title staircase in The Circular Staircase also seems like a female symbol.)\n\nThe Will Subplot. Also good is a subplot about a mysterious will (mystery set forth in Chapter 16, architecture and context described in Chapter 20, solved in Chapter 30, with a bit more in Chapter 31). These sections together make up what essentially is a short story, embedded in the larger novel. They take up around 25 pages in a paperback edition of the book.\n\nThere is some ingenuity about the title door in the subplot about the will. It shows Rinehart's architectural orientation as a plot creator. The entire will subplot is firmly based in the architecture of the hotel.\n\nThe Mathematics of Shape. Rinehart uses the word \"hypotenuse\" to describe the triangular lot next to the mansion (near the start of Chapter 4). This recalls another mathematical term in Rinehart: the title of her story The Curve of the Catenary. Both of these geometric terms are used with mathematical accuracy.\n\nDetection. There are some brief episodes of real detection in The Door:\n\nThe letter, and to whom it is addressed (end of Chapter 5).\n\nThe Inspector investigates some footprints (end of Chapter 6).\n\nThe discovery of the second murder, identifying the victim, and reconstructing the crime (Chapter 8).\n\nAn investigation of the victim's room (Chapter 11). This is a standard kind of detective mystery: a search for a hidden object.\n\nAnother look at the finding of the pencil at the book's start (first half of Chapter 22).\n\nSolving the mystery of the will (Chapter 30).\n\nThe Working Class + Detection. The Florence Gunther sections (Chapters: second half of 7, 8, 11) form a portrait of the life of a working woman. This is the other best part of the novel, along with the opening. These sections are filled with mystery and detection. They are also a vivid sociological portrait. Florence Gunther is a legal stenographer, and respected at her job. Yet she is seemingly paid very little, and lives in near poverty in a dreary, if respectable, rooming house. This is a look at the poverty-filled lives of working women.\n\nA parallel look at the hard life of a working woman is in the Eliza Connor sections of The Great Mistake (Chapters: end of 25, 26, start of 34).\n\nFlorence Gunther is an example of a kind of character that runs through Rinehart and her followers: a mysterious person from the lower classes who tries to contact the upper crust protagonist - but who fails. See this article's section on Mysterious Visitors for more details.\n\nReporter. Dick Carter, the young reporter, is a pleasing character. He talks elaborately and humorously, indicating a skill with words linked to his profession (Chapters: second half of 7, 8). He has no money, and is a working man. His most detailed portrait is in the section that also deals with Florence Gunther, an even poorer working woman. This section looks at the lives of working people in 1930.\n\nDick's humorous remark, \"Give me the papers and take the child!\" (near the start of Chapter 11) sounds as if it is a quotation, or a burlesque or parody of a famous quote. However, an Internet search has failed to turn up any source.\n\nDick is a poor but hard-working young man, happily in mutual love with a rich young woman. This couple recall the young lovers in The Red Lamp.\n\nSocial Secretary. Rich middle-aged Society women in Rinehart often employ social secretaries to help them out with their activities and events. These tend to be young women, genteel, and efficient. See: The Door, The Great Mistake, \"Episode of the Wandering Knife\".\n\nSeries Detectives\n\nThe squad car short stories and the Miss Pinkerton novels and novellas were Rinehart's only attempts at series detectives. Otherwise she never reused the same characters from one mystery to the next. This is unusual in the mystery field, where there are strong pressures on authors to use the same detective in all their books. The public usually purchases novels featuring their favorite detective, and the series-sleuth functions commercially as a drawing card in a manner analogous to that of the star in Hollywood movies. Rinehart's immense popularity perhaps freed her from these considerations. Even here, it is significant that Rinehart's use of series peaked in the darkest days of the Depression, when she was feeling the greatest economic pinch.\n\nMiss Pinkerton\n\nDespite these problems some of Rinehart's writings of the 1930's were very good. Miss Pinkerton (1932) revives her nurse detective for a full length novel, her two 1914 appearances both being novellas. The story telling in this novel is vivid, and the ostinato retellings of the basic crime from different perspectives and eyewitnesses build up to an almost hallucinatory intensity.\n\nThe Miss Pinkerton books were shorter than the enormous, over-stuffed non-series mystery novels Rinehart turned out in her later years, and this is all to the good.\n\nFeeding as Moral Support. The opening describes the heroine at home, before she goes out on a case. It emphasizes how sane her home is. Some of the feeding imagery recalls The Case of Jennie Brice:\n\nHer landlady kindly brings Miss Pinkerton hot milk and a cookie. This recalls the landlady in The Case of Jennie Brice bringing tea and crackers to a woman tenant, as a good-will gesture (Chapter 1).\n\nThe heroine feeds her pet bird a sugar cube. In The Case of Jennie Brice, the landlady-heroine feeds a dog a sugar cube. (And no, this might not accord with what science has learned about nutrition since 1932!)\n\nConfession. A woman's written confession plays a role in the mystery plot. This recalls Rinehart's \"The Confession\".\n\nMystery Plot: Finding a Path. SPOILERS. One of the best mystery plot aspects involves finding a way through the locked-up mansion. This is set forth as a puzzle or problem early on (first part of Chapter 4), solved later (Chapter 16). This is ingenious. It anticipates, as a kind of mystery problem, how the killer finds their way through the house in The Album. However the details of the two books' problems and solutions are quite different.\n\nMystery Plot: Searches. Twice, the police fail to do a good job searching a crime scene for clues. Instead, they have to depend on amateur sleuths who come in later and help find things. SPOILERS.:\n\nThe document in the bedroom is found, only after the heroine notices that the bed has been moved out.\n\nThe reporters find a big clue on the roof, that the police had overlooked.\n\nMystery Plot: Who Done It. There are no good clues to the identity of the killer, that are shared with the reader during the novel. This is a weakness in the book's mystery plot. Instead the killer is identified at the end, in part by a new clue found by the reporters.\n\nArchitecture. The architecture of the house is set in forth in detail (early in Chapter 5). Even before this it is described (Chapters 2, 4).\n\nThe distinction between the upper class family's quarters, and the service wing, is sharply marked off in the architecture. The service wing contains rooms where the servants work, and on the floor above that, their sleeping quarters. The service wing connects to the family wing through a single locked and bolted door on the second floor, plus a first floor door. The two wings have separate staircases, a fact much emphasized by the novel's events.\n\nThe two parts of the house recall the architecture in \"The Amazing Adventure of Letitia Carberry\". In that, a hospital was connected by a door to the nurses' dormitory.\n\nIn both works, the two sections recall the paired houses that run through other Rinehart books.\n\nLine of Sight. The butler Hugo is able to watch the mansion's side door to the service wing, from the rear window in the parlor (Chapter 6). This is an example of a \"line of sight\" in Rinehart: what can be seen (or not seen) from where.\n\nThe Vertical Dimension. All three floors of the mansion play a role in the story. So does a ladder reaching up to the second floor roof. Such \"vertical dimension\" often appears in Rinehart.\n\nEconomic Security. Miss Pinkerton more than once talks about newfound money providing \"security\" for three of the characters in their old age. Their fate would otherwise be dire. This recalls that Social Security (1935) would soon be passed, providing for most senior Americans security for the first time in history.\n\nThe Opening: Structure. The first chapter forms a sort of unofficial Prologue to the rest of the book. It has many features that mark it off from the rest of the novel:\n\nIt takes place outside the mansion that will be the book's main locale. Only at the start of Chapter 2 does the heroine enter, first the porch, then the mansion itself.\n\nArchitectural information about the mansion starts right away in Chapter 2. We learn about the hall, then the front room, then the third floor, etc. By contrast there is no architectural information in Chapter 1.\n\nWe meet the detective characters in Chapter 1, and start meeting the suspects in Chapter 2. These suspects begin immediately with the doctor, at the start of Chapter 2.\n\nWe meet the beautiful young romantic heroine in Chapter 1, however. Technically she is a suspect too. But in actuality she becomes championed by Miss Pinkerton. I don't think the reader ever seriously suspects she is the killer.\n\nVan Dine school. Miss Pinkerton shows signs of mild influence from S.S. Van Dine, who was immensely popular and influential in that era.\n\nVan Dine and many of his followers featured \"amateur detectives who work in close collaboration with a friendly policeman\". Miss Pinkerton and Inspector Patton fit the above description. However, Miss Pinkerton works as a nurse, so she is not quite an amateur. And it is never made clear if she is compensated financially by the police.\n\nInspector Patton reconstructs the crime using ballistics (Chapter 3), recalling Van Dine's own such reconstruction in The Benson Murder Case (1926).\n\nThe setting of Miss Pinkerton is a gloomy family mansion in the city, where people keep getting murdered. This recalls Van Dine's The Greene Murder Case (1928).\n\nWhile there are no floor plans in Miss Pinkerton, the architectural layout of the mansion is set forth in precise detail.\n\nVan Dine and several followers had whole teams of named policemen as series characters, assisting the main cop. Miss Pinkerton does too. However, Miss Pinkerton tells us little about these men, who are just briefly mentioned.\n\nVan Dine influence will return in Rinehart's next mystery novel The Album (1933).\n\nComedy and Color. There is a slapstick set-piece, involving a can of pant (Chapter 9). Slapstick will return in Rinehart's The Album. The can of paint incident has some of the few examples of color imagery in Miss Pinkerton.\n\nThe reporters (Chapter 18) also involve comedy and slapstick. And they are wearing paint-covered overalls, linking them to the paint-can imagery.\n\nThe heroine's spilled face powder at first looks like more comedy (Chapter 18). But soon it turns into a possible clue (Chapter 19).\n\nTuxedos. Despite the grim Depression poverty in Miss Pinkerton, two of the men are wearing tuxedos (called \"dinner jackets\" in the novel). One is the powerful man carrying the ladder (Chapter 8). The other is the lawyer. The tuxedos convey both upper class status, and personal virility.\n\nLadders are associated both with this powerful man (Chapter 8) and later with the two young reporters working undercover (Chapter 18). In both cases the ladders serve as phallic symbols.\n\nSecretary. Florence Gunther in The Door was a sympathetic, realistic portrait of a working woman, one who was paid little for all her hard efforts. She was a legal stenographer, and had a grim, poverty-stricken life.\n\nThe lawyer's secretary Florence Lenz in Miss Pinkerton has a similar name: Florence as a first name, a Germanic last name. But otherwise she has little in common with Florence Gunther. Florence Lenz is a cheap gold-digger, who is out to get what she can from her unmarried lawyer boss (Chapter 9). I find this a less interesting character and portrait. It disguises how difficult work was during the Depression.\n\nI could have used more sympathy for the servants too. They are overworked and probably not paid much. But they are mainly treated as suspicious and unpleasant.\n\nChauffeur. The chauffeur Mac is only briefly seen (Chapter 9). He is depicted as physically strong and active: perhaps part of the \"virile chauffeurs\" tradition in mystery fiction. Please see my discussion of Chauffeurs. A chauffeur will have a bigger role in The Album.\n\nMoral Issues. The clean cut hero works for a living: a key to his office is on his key ring (Chapter 14). By contrast, the wastrel victim can't hold a job, and prefers \"loafing\" (Chapter 1). Such a portrait of character affecting jobs might make some sense in an era of full employment. But it is out of touch during the Depression. In the Depression, lots of hard-working Americans found themselves unemployed, through no fault of their own.\n\nSPOILERS. Everyone suspects the heroine has been having pre-marital sex with the victim. Actually, it turns out late in the novel that she had been secretly married to him. This sounds like a ploy to evade the censor. I think readers were intended to see these events as being actually about pre-marital sex. And the marriage license as simply a gimmick. A similar \"marriage license to evade the censors\" approach will later be found in \"Episode of the Wandering Knife\".\n\nPublication Dates. Miss Pinkerton was reportedly serialized in the Saturday Evening Post from January 2, 1932 to February 13, 1932. It was then published in book form. The book was reviewed in the New York Times on February 14, 1932.\n\nThe first film version of Miss Pinkerton was released on July 30, 1932. I briefly discuss this OK film in the article on its director Lloyd Bacon. The film is set in New York City - the Inspector's badge says so - while the book is in an unnamed city that rather resembles PIttsburgh. In film Miss Pinkerton and the Inspector are meeting for the first time, while in the book they have a long term professional relationship.\n\nThe Squad Car short stories\n\nThe little short story \"That Is All\" (1932) deals with a couple of urban policemen who nocturnally patrol by squad car. It shows Rinehart's perennial interests in both night scenes and realism. Both Miss Pinkerton and \"That Is All\" show Rinehart trying to inject some Depression era realism into her work. \"That Is All\" was followed by a sequel with the same characters, \"Code 31\" (1932). The police cars communicate by radio, in both tales. Radio was on the cutting edge of advanced technology in 1932.\n\nThe city in the radio car tales is unnamed, but one suspects it is Rinehart's home base of Pittsburgh:\n\nThere is a Reed Street in \"That Is All\", and a Race Street in \"Code 31\": both names of real-life Pittsburgh roads.\n\nThe city is definitely urban, yet much smaller in size than New York City: both features consistent with Pittsburgh.\n\nThat Is All. \"That Is All\" is a crime story; but it has no elements of mystery, and it does not much resemble most of Rinehart's mystery fiction. Instead, its raucous nocturnal adventures recall the comic chase scenes of some Tish stories, although it has serious elements as well.\n\nThe young man's blue-and-red car recalls the hero's red-and-yellow bath-robe in The Man in Lower Ten (Chapter 2). Both are flamboyant color schemes linked to young men.\n\nCode 31. By contrast, the grimmer toned \"Code 31\" has a murder mystery embedded in it. It also reflects Rinehart's feminist themes. Rinehart's detective keeps giving different interpretations to mysterious events here. First he will suggest that they are caused by one explanation. Then a clue he discovers will contradict this. He will then come up with a deeper, better explanation consistent with his new observation. But soon he will find another clue and come up with another explanation, starting the cycle over again. Each time, he gets closer and closer to the truth. Eventually he gets to the final answer. Rinehart's writing here is very economical. Each explanation takes up just a few sentences, maybe even a single sentence. The detective can come up with numerous explanations in just a single page. The progression of ideas from one interpretation to the next is completely logical, solidly based on clues and deduction. The explanations are quite rich and vivid. They almost seem like alternate realities, in a science fiction story.\n\nBefore the main mystery gets underway in \"Code 31\", there is a subplot mystery about the identity and goals of the man hanging out mysteriously by the service station. This is presented as a brief but complete mystery, with a physical object clue that offers alternate explanations. This subplot comes to an immediate solution.\n\n\"Code 31\" shows the infrastructure that is still open, after the rest of a city shuts down at night: a service station, a drug store, a doctor's.\n\nRinehart tries to include realistic detail about the police as an institution. SPOILERS:\n\nThe new code signals.\n\nThe use of radio, radio-cars and motorcycles to patrol the city.\n\nThe owner of the car repair shop used by the cops.\n\nThe relation between the cops and the gambling den.\n\nThe relations between the police and the detective bureau.\n\nSPOILERS. Both \"Code 31\" and the suspense tale \"Alibi for Isabel\" deal with women threatened by abusive husbands. In both stories, this leads to related crime plot developments.\n\nThese tales deal with would later be seen as a major feminist issue. Rinehart is wholly sympathetic to the women in the tales, and wholly unsympathetic to the men. She differs a bit from modern-day feminism, in that she depicts the abuse as being caused by specific elements, drug addition or shell shock, whereas modern feminists tend to see abuse as caused by male chauvinism. This is perhaps related to a common idea of the era, that abuse was caused or triggered by alcohol or drunkenness. Still, Rinehart's gripping depiction of what she clearly sees as a significant problem should be of interest to current feminists.\n\nThe Inside Story: a short story\n\nAnother policeman hero shows up in \"The Inside Story\" (1934), where he says \"Trouble is my business\", five years before Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe makes a similar claim.\n\n\"The Inside Story\" is an unusual meld of the detective tale and the domestic drama of married life, Rinehart's chief interest in mainstream fiction at the time.\n\n\"The Inside Story\" resembles somewhat Rinehart's earlier masterpiece, \"The Buckled Bag\" (1914). Both take place in a single household with mysterious goings on. Both have a young outsider as detective who is working in the household, but who is not of it: the nurse Miss Pinkerton in \"The Buckled Bag\", the young policeman in \"The Inside Story\". Both detectives are richly characterized. Both are working professionals. Both are of modest social status - this is the young policeman's first big break, and he has not really been asked along to do anything but be an extra cop on the case. Both do a lot of unobtrusive slinking around the huge house where the crimes take place. In both stories, the key to solving the crime is to understand the hidden relationships among the household. Solving the case is tantamount to penetrating all the social mysteries of the house. Both are very purely constructed detective stories, where determined sleuthing continually uncovers more and more details of the mystery, in a step by step, logical manner. Rinehart is good at opening surprising new vistas among her characters' lives. One does not suspect her new revelations, although they are consistent with was has been revealed before, and with hints dropped in the story.\n\n\"The Inside Story\" is full of ideas about class and gender. The young working class policeman finds it much easier to approach the servants in the house, than the young upper class couple who are the chief suspects in the tale. The servants emerge as much more real people in the story. They have far more substance than the nominal hero"
