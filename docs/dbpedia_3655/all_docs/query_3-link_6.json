        "text": "The Dangerous Places\n\nby Louis Golding\n\nfor\n\nANNE and MARK LABOVITCH\n\nwho weave other patterns\n\nChapter I\n\n[I]\n\nIt's close and heavy, the woman said to herself. There's far too many blankets on the bed. It's not blankets. There's dust in my nostrils and in my mouth and in my ears. I can't move. There's dust and rubble all over me.\n\nWho am I? What's my name? What's that rattle like pins on my ear-drum? The stuff's all over my hair. If Brauner shampoos me from now till next Friday, she won't get it out.\n\nBrauner? Who on earth's Brauner? She's my maid. Then who am I? You've lost your papers, have you? Then you might as well call yourself Channah, he said. Who said? Where am I?\n\nBoom! What's that? A gun? That's right! Or it's a bomb, maybe. It must have been a bomb that put me here. I'm alive. It's certainly not heaven, and I don't think it's hell, is it? No, it isn't. It's earth right enough. So I'm still alive. It would take more than a bomb to kill old....\n\n(A name winked like a firefly in the depth of the darkness. She shied away from it as a nose shies away from a sudden whiff of ammonia.)\n\nI was in the Post. That's right. Post Sixteen. The air was stifling with the stench of wounds. Medical supplies were dwindling. The dead were piling up, for it was getting harder to bury them. Prr! Prr! Prr! Yes? That's machine-guns. It's cold! Air's coming in. (She licked her lips. There was the taste of blood under the dust.)\n\n\"Channah,\" said the young doctor in Post Sixteen, \"they've just brought in a little girl in a dead faint. They've dumped her under the slope of the roof at the corner there. See if there's anything you can do.\"\n\nPost Sixteen. In the cellars under the tall grey houses of Kupieçka, in the Warsaw ghetto. I was rolling and unrolling bandages. Then they let me swab the pus away and tie up the wounds. How did I get down here?\n\nHands dragged me down. I was going to tear their eyes out, but the hands pulled me away, down into the cellars and the sewers. There were two Germans in the street in black uniforms. One got hold of an iron spike and stood it upright on the pavement. Another got hold of a baby and lifted it and brought it down on the spike till the point stuck through....\n\nThen it was like an electric bulb exploding, light and darkness at the same time. I knew what a lump of filth I was all the time I was Frau General, Aryan and German, lawfully wedded wife of Willy von Brockenburg, Hitler's man, Goering's man. Pretending all those years I knew nothing of what was going on in the concentration camps and the extermination camps. But I knew all the time, of course. I knew all the time.\n\nJust as I've known since the moment I came to myself down here that I'm Elsie Silver, Elsie Silver, Elsie Silver, the trollop who betrayed the Jews, her people, and England, her country.\n\nHands reached out for me and dragged me down into the cellars. Then the fighting started. I swabbed pus and did up wounds. But I never took myself in. I never thought I'd made up for what I'd done, and what I hadn't done. I was boiling a heap of bandages in a bucket when the young doctor called out to me and sent me to do what I could for a young girl they'd just brought into the Post. So I got up and went forward.\n\nThen the bomb fell, I suppose.\n\nIf I tried hard, I think I could shake off this rubble and get clear. But I'm bone lazy. I've never tried hard at anything. Besides, I don't want to get clear. I'm afraid of the Jews. And the Germans. And Himmler. He's after me. He got Willy, my husband, and he'll get me too. I like it the way it is, this buzzing in my ears. The drowsiness creeping along my veins like luminal. What bad luck, to come up out of it a few minutes, just time enough to remember what a cow I am! Won't be long now. Not unpleasant, not bad at all. And safe, very safe. If only no grit in my hair....\n\nThe sea's like glass all round.... Grey glass. Dark. Can't see through....\n\nThen a faint voice, a girl's voice, came through the grey glassy water, weak as the voice of a young bird fallen out of the nest. Wasser the word was, tiny and far-off and near at hand.\n\n\"No!\" murmured a voice inside her skull. \"I don't want to come back. Let me go. It's good. It's like bees buzzing and droning. No more Himmler. No more Elsie Silver. No more Frau General. No more Channah. All over.\"\n\n\"Channah!\" the young doctor said, a little more sharply than before. But it was a different sort of sound from the sound the girl made. For the girl was a living girl, and the young doctor was dead; she knew for certain he was dead. She was certain that the whole of Post Sixteen had been wiped out, excepting for herself, and, apparently, one small girl, calling for water. \"Didn't you hear, Channah?\" the dead doctor went on. \"That little girl I sent you.... See what she wants.\"\n\nThe buzzing and droning thinned in the ears. Light spread through the grey glassy waters. It was not water now in the nostrils, but air, the hard smell of dust, like snuff. You might stop being Elsie Silver or the Frau General von Brockenburg, for you were those people entirely for your own sweet sake. It was different to stop being Channah. You were Channah for other people's sake.\n\n\"Yes, doctor, at once,\" said Elsie obediently to the voice in her brain. She made to move from under her bedclothes of rubble, but they were far heavier than she had thought. There was no strength in her. The effort almost made the slowed-down heart stop beating. She had succeeded in nothing more than moving her head a centimetre or two. She lay quite motionless for some time, feeling her blood to be as thin as water, and not knowing from what empty reservoir it could draw virtue to thicken again. It was not quite dark. Just enough light filtered into the place for her to see the rubble that covered her, some great slabs of masonry lying askew on her left, and on her right the sloping wall-section that had held death at arm's length from her and her companion. The girl lay in the deeper darkness, still beyond her eye's range. A second time she strained at the neck-tendons, skewing her neck round still further; then at last her eyes came to rest where the girl was. She, too, was almost covered by a bedding of dust and small chunks of lath and plaster, but at least the nose and mouth were free. You could just make out the profile, or thought you could, the delicate forehead, the fine cheek-bones, the delicate chin.\n\nShe tugged at her limbs again with increased urgency. You must get to the girl, not only because the dead doctor had given you charge of her but because she was so small and frail. The guns boomed from time to time. The machine-guns stuttered from far off and close at hand. Then, once again, a sound issued from the lips of the girl, this birdlike noise in its moral weight so much more resolute than the guns, though as sound it had hardly more lineament than the face from which it issued. A moment later, as if there were no other fitting answer in Hitler's Warsaw to the last uttered breath of a trapped child, a smother of dust and plaster came down like a wry rain. While the air was still opaque with it, the inexpugnable determination came to the woman also trapped there that she must find somehow, from somewhere, the strength to free herself, thrust over to the girl, and lift her out of the tomb that was closing around them both. She tore at her nerves as with fingernails in the smooth walls of a crevasse. Somehow the broken and bleeding fingernails found lodgment in the smooth walls. Somehow she lifted herself from the vast inertia which lay on her like lead. She was over at the girl's side, sweeping the dust away from her mouth, tearing the rubble away from her lips.\n\n\"There now, little one, there now,\" she murmured, lifting the supine head to her bosom. \"You're all right now, see.\" She bent her ear down upon the girl's mouth, waited in an agony of suspense, then became aware that a faintest movement of air touched the lobe of her ear.\n\n\"You see, doctor?\" It was the dead young doctor from Post Sixteen she was addressing now. But the doctor's voice was silent. His last thought had been realized. Only his spectacles were glinting in the hole between the straddled wall-blocks. The rest was up to herself.\n\nThere was a little strength again in her fingertips. She got the girl clear, so that the whole frame was exposed. It did not seem there were any bones broken. She got her arms at last round the girl's body and pulled her up from the waist. She was not so small as she had seemed when most of her was invisible under dust. Eleven? Twelve? More? But in Elsie's profoundly enfeebled arms she might have been a mature woman, or a heavy piece of furniture. It felt, as Elsie tugged and pulled and tugged, that the veins in her forehead were standing out like cord; that the shoulder-blades might crack at any moment. Time was itself a heavy piece of furniture, that could be budged, maybe, by a gang of men in shirt-sleeves, with muscles like huge, smooth stones, but not, no, not by a corrupt woman, who had lain about for years on satin bed-sheets, her head resting on down pillows soft as water. Then at last she reached the jagged lumps that lay between them and the obliterated Post, only to find that there was no way out there; they were trapped. She laid the girl down, and scrabbled in the debris below to see if there was any way out under; she sought to climb the desolate rocks. But the intact ceiling that had saved them now held them fast.\n\nSuddenly, with whatever there was in her lungs, she gave tongue.\n\n\"No!\" she protested. \"No! No!\" She had been ready, anxious, to die herself. But the girl must not die. She forgot the inexorable enemies that lay in wait inches beyond the barrier, starvation, disease, the enemy's guns and bombs, the fire-engirdled city, the enemies crouched in all the vast fields that stretched beyond river and hill and wood to the limits of all the horizons. \"Help!\" she cried. \"Help!\" She spoke to the girl again, soothing her. \"Klaninke, little one! Can you hear me?\" There was no reply. She brought her mouth still closer towards the girl's ear. \"Can you hear me?\" She placed her finger under the young chin. Oh, the girl heard. She nodded. She felt the pressure of the chin once and still again on the side of her finger. A tear came into Elsie's eyes, and drew a warm line down to her trembling mouth. The girl was aware of her, of arms protecting her, and, maybe, of a brain scheming for her.\n\nShe had asked for water. \"Are you thirsty?\" Elsie went on. Again the girl nodded. \"Poor little one. There'll be water soon. It will be possible to wait, yes?\" The girl nodded again. She was trying to talk. It was not easy. It would probably not be easy for some time, after the horror of the interment in the bomb ruin, let alone the nameless horrors that must have gone before.\n\n\"Don't talk now. Just nod your head, or shake it. Are you in pain?\" The girl nodded. \"Is it much pain?\" The girl shook her head. \"I'm going to ask your name. If you feel you can talk, and would like to tell it me, say what your name is.\" She listened, her ear close against the child's lips. There was silence for some time, then at last the name came.\n\n\"Mila,\" she whispered. She tried to say something more. \"Der ta....\" But that was too much for the moment. The word was not finished.\n\n\"Mila! What a pretty name! There, don't think of anything more now.\"\n\n[II]\n\n\"Help!\" came a muffled cry from among the rubble that had been Kupieçka Street. \"Help!\" And a young man, dodging mortar-fire, making for cover, heard the desperate sound. In addition to the German arms he had looted, he now carried a message to the next man he met.\n\n\"Hallo, chaver!\" a voice cried. \"Oh, it's you, Feivel! That's a good haul you've made there! Let me have one of those rifles, will you?\"\n\nAnother young man had come up out of some hole in the ground. The face was as black as smoke.\n\n\"Lend us a hand, Shmul!\" the first said urgently. \"There's a woman alive in the ruins of Post Sixteen!\"\n\n\"The poor soul! I'm with you, Feivel!\"\n\nThey picked their way back into Kupieçka, and into the jagged chaos that had been Post Sixteen, till they came up against the lumps of wall behind which the woman called so desperately. The young man called Shmul switched on his torch and thrust his arm through a gap. \"Put your hand out to me! Can you reach?\" He waited for some moments, then a hand rough as a cat's tongue seized his convulsively. \"Wait! I've a drop of brandy here! Take a sip! Give some to your daughter!\" He took a flask from his pocket and thrust it through.\n\nBut the outstretched hand did not move. It remained frozen there. The woman herself was suddenly rigid. Not a sound was on her lips. Some time passed.\n\n\"Do you hear, woman?\" Feivel asked testily. \"There's no time to lose.\"\n\nThen he felt the gritty hand release his own. It fumbled till it found the flask in his other hand. Then the woman spoke. Her words came curiously slow and hushed.\n\n\"For my daughter,\" the woman whispered.\n\nShe had never felt herself so wildly, so gloriously flattered in all her life before. Your daughter, he said, your daughter. Princes and high statesmen had in her time uttered to her the most immoderate compliments. Her pulses had not quickened. There, in the stench and darkness, Elsie Silver blushed hot with joy. She had never wanted a child, and had been careful enough to see she had none. But she had not wanted a child because the concept Elsie Silver, mother, was just too silly, too farcically out of the question. It was against nature, as it is against nature for a homosexual, or a eunuch, to have a child. And yet, accredit either of these with maternity or paternity, though there may be an embarrassed snigger on the lips, in the heart the compliment rocks like a peal of bells.\n\n\"What a fool you are!\" a voice whispered in Elsie Silver's head, while her heart rioted. \"Any slut has a baby, any sow in a sty has ten. Besides, she's got nothing at all to do with me, this little homeless ghost from God knows where. Both of us homeless ghosts from God knows where.\"\n\n\"Don't worry,\" a voice within her countered. \"If any two creatures ever were mother and daughter, it's you and this one.\" She placed the brandy to the girl's lips, a drop or two coursed down the throat. The girl coughed and shivered. She might live, if these men had them out in time.\n\n\"Won't you get on with it?\" Elsie begged them.\n\n\"Give yourself a drop too,\" ordered Shmul. \"Then you can both have a swig of water to wash your mouths.\" She lifted the brandy flask to her lips. The brandy in her throat lit up a thought in her with a rush and a whistle, like a match flame at a gas jet.\n\n\"I'm going to take her away... outside, away from here,\" she explained, as if the idea were to get the girl out of a stuffy cinema. \"Thank you.\" This was for the water. The girl's lips nuzzled the bottle like a lamb at a sheep's udder.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Shmul quietly, \"you'll take her away.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" confirmed Feivel. \"Outside, away from here.\"\n\nThey both thought the idea farcical. At this stage one did not get away from the Warsaw ghetto, and certainly not very far. Shmul wanted to laugh. He had been on the verge of hysteria more than once during the last day or two. It was as if the sole of his foot were sticking out of bed and someone came up now and again to tickle it with a feather. His muscles twitched now, but he did not laugh.\n\nIt was the same with Feivel. He, too, thought the idea of this woman getting herself and her daughter out of the ghetto was chimerical. But there was another thought in his head. How wonderful it would be if the impossible happened and they got away somehow, to England, to America, perhaps even to Palestine! Hadn't Israel's God and the people of Israel always specialized in the impossible? So let us say the miracle happened. Perhaps the two women some day would remember him, and the mitzvah, the holy deed, he had done on their behalf. For to save life is a mitzvah, which has preference over all other mitzvahs. It would be good to think of someone remembering him over there in Eretz Israel, at the foot of Mount Zion, or against Rachel's Tomb, maybe, among the silver olive-groves. His family had been wiped out a year, two years, ago. He had never married. There would never be children to light candles for him, for in a few days, if not sooner, he would be dead.\n\nPerhaps this mother and this girl would light candles for him, Feivel. He looked round, flashing his torch. There was an iron bar sticking out of a heap of rubbish a few feet away. He tugged at it and it came loose.\n\n\"This will be useful, Feivel,\" he said. He tapped a large block by his foot. \"We'll start here, eh?\"\n\nIt was a curious business, sitting there in the darkness, with the girl in her arms, and the two men groaning and grunting as they heaved away, and the mortar shells popping and the siege-guns booming, and now and again a bomb dropping like a lump of a small planet. On the physical plane she knew that it was difficult for any female creature to be so wretched as she was. Despite the gulp of water, her mouth was again as dry as soot. She ached in every limb. Above all, she detested the feeling of grit in her hair, biting on itself like teeth. She had always been one to keep her hair smooth as petals. Even lately, as Channah, down here amid the cellar damps and the sewers, she had kept her hair decent. She felt, she told herself, like hell.\n\nYet, despite all this, she was more happy and serene than she had been in all her life before. The girl lay in her arms, abandoned to her, as completely hers during these minutes, this half-hour, as a new-born child is completely its mother's and lies snuggling against the warmth of her breast. For this half-hour at least, or for a few hours, or for a half-day, she could say she was responsible for the breath of life in the girl exactly in the same degree as the mother could say it of the new-born child, torn from another kind of womb by another kind of doctor. She could tell herself before she died, as she was quite likely to do quite soon, that she had known once, for a brief time, the totally selfless love of motherhood.\n\n\"How does it go, young men?\" she asked many minutes later.\n\n\"It will be well!\" they said.\n\nSo she sat in the darkness, she and the strange daughter in her arms, till the stones at last were rolled away, and the young men took them out, with immense labour, to Post Four, which was still in some sort of going order.\n\n[III]\n\nThe two young men entered the Post, Feivel holding the girl in his arms, Shmul supporting the woman, her head on his shoulder, his arm round her waist. There were still a couple of oil-lamps in the middle of the cellar, and there were a few candles burning in bottles. Shmul found room for the woman on the edge of a blood-soaked mattress. Feivel walked away a foot or two to find a more salubrious place for the girl.\n\n\"Where are you taking her?\" cried Elsie. \"Leave her!\"\n\n\"All right, all right!\" said Feivel. He put her down beside Elsie. He knew what a state of nerves the wretched woman must be in. Another woman turned sharply round from an arm she was dealing with.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" she cried. She was tall, sallow, forbidding.\n\n\"Good God!\" muttered Shmul. \"Frau Cohen-Berger! They've brought her over here!\" It was clear that he did not like Frau Cohen-Berger. He was gone, suddenly. He was good at that, coming and going suddenly, a talent quite a few Germans had had occasion to deplore.\n\nFrau Cohen-Berger turned to her case again. She got busy fixing up a sling for the arm. Then she moved on to another case which looked like being a long job. Feivel strode up to Frau Cohen-Berger.\n\n\"You're in charge here now?\" he asked.\n\n\"I am. Who are you? What do you want?\" She had no time for civilities.\n\n\"I've a flask of brandy here, the real stuff.\" He uncorked it. She sniffed.\n\n\"You've no iodine? Well, thank you. It'll help.\"\n\n\"I could get some iodine too. Can you do with some German field-dressings?\"\n\nShe took them from him reverently, as she might once have taken a rare manuscript, or an ivory.\n\n\"You're a good man. We're out of everything. It's like baling a sinking ship with a thimble.\" She turned round to get on with her work.\n\n\"Listen, doctor,\" he said. \"I want you to help me.\"\n\nShe turned. Her face was hard and distrustful again.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"My wife and child... they're suffering badly from shock. A bomb buried them. Can you do something for them?\" He felt terribly ashamed. He did not like bargaining at a time like this, and he did not like lying at any price.\n\n\"I see,\" she replied. She had never felt herself Jewish. She did not like Jewish ways. She was German, from one of the good Frankfort families. It was just like an Ostjude, an Eastern Jew, to haggle and barter, as if life and death were a saddle or a roll of cloth. Nothing for nothing. \"I'll do my best,\" she said bleakly. \"But you realize, of course, we're all trapped. It'll be over soon.\"\n\nHis ears burned. \"Thank you,\" he said humbly. \"You're a lamed-voonik, a holy one.\" The doctor turned from him impatiently, and he came back to Elsie.\n\n\"How are you feeling now?\" asked Feivel.\n\nElsie smiled wanly, and looked down at the girl, who was supported against the wall now, with her head on her shoulder. Mila's eyes were still closed.\n\n\"I've been trying to get up,\" Elsie said. \"My legs won't carry me. I'd like to wash her a little.\"\n\n\"Mishkosheh,\" he said, gesturing with his flat, outspread hands. \"Don't worry, please. The doctor's coming. I'll see what I can find.\"\n\nThere was half a bucket of fairly clean water in the Post for the use of the doctor and her helpers, but it would be wise to fight shy of that. He found a few inches in a battered petrol tin in the passage outside.\n\n\"Come,\" he said. \"I've got a cloth too.\"\n\nShe smiled at him.\n\n\"You've got other jobs to do. No, I'll manage.\" She took the cloth from him, soaked it in the water, and brought it close to the girl's face.\n\n\"Mila,\" she murmured. \"Are you awake?\" The girl nodded. \"Could you open your eyes?\" The girl opened her eyes. \"I want you to see the face of the man who saved us.\"\n\nThere was a shadow of a smile on Mila's lips.\n\n\"Thank you, chaver,\" her lips went. Then she waited, as if to gather more strength before she spoke again.\n\n\"Leshonoh habo beyerushalayim! Next year in Jerusalem!\"\n\n\"What's that? What's that?\" asked Elsie. She stared from Mila's eyes to Feivel's and back again. It was not German, not Yiddish. It was Hebrew, wasn't it? She had heard Hebrew prayers down in the cellars. Often she had heard the younger folk converse in Hebrew. But the sound, the tune, perhaps the actual words, went back many years before that... to her girlhood in her father's kitchen in Doomington, in Oleander Street.\n\nWhat was the matter with the man? His cheeks were burning. His eyes were all aglow. It seemed to Feivel that in those words, uttered by a girl half dead in a cellar of the Warsaw ghetto, there was something as astonishing as a rose growing out of a dry bone. There was miracle in it, like the burning of the Bush that was not consumed. For the first time he knew with holy certainty that the fighting against stupendous odds, the wounds, and the dying had not been in vain, not even if precisely not one single soul emerged from this gehenna.\n\n\"What did she say, man?\" insisted Elsie, for the girl's eyes were closed again.\n\n\"Next year in Jerusalem!\" breathed Feivel.\n\n\"Oh, I see,\" Elsie muttered. She said nothing for some moments. Then, a little querulously: \"What did I say?\" she asked, as if she and Feivel had been arguing and Feivel had insisted that they would stay here in Warsaw, all of them, and all would die here. Jerusalem? The word shook fitfully across the lens of her mind, like the image of a swaying bough beyond a window. Jerusalem? It was a long way off.\n\n\"Please,\" said Feivel. \"Let me wipe her face with the cloth, then I'll go.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Elsie. She could afford to be generous. There would be a lot more than that to do for Mila. The young man got to it, and swabbed the girl's face, delicately, carefully, as if it were something that had become inexpressibly precious.\n\n\"What's your name?\" asked Elsie. \"We'd like to remember it.\" He would be dead soon, very likely, but she and Mila would be getting away somewhere, somehow, if they only got some strength into their limbs.\n\nHe flashed a smile of extraordinary tenderness at her.\n\n\"Feivel Tumin,\" he said. He was quite young. The mouth was working, as if he would break into tears any moment. Mila opened her eyes, as if she, too, were anxious to imprint his image on her mind.\n\n\"Thank you, comrade,\" she said. \"It feels better now.\"\n\nFeivel rose from his knees and handed the rag over to Elsie. He did not look back.\n\n\"Shalom!\" he called out to them. \"Peace!\"\n\n\"Shalom!\" they said as he disappeared into the passage beyond the cellar.\n\nA moment or two later the doctor was beside them. A bargain was a bargain. She had traded some of the time she could ill afford from the desperate demands of the seriously wounded for a flask of brandy and a handful of field-dressings.\n\n\"Your husband's gone?\" she asked.\n\n\"He had to go,\" replied Elsie. \"He's on patrol.\"\n\nA cursory examination indicated that the woman was suffering mainly from shock, hunger, and weakness, like almost everyone else. She turned her attention to the girl, an odd, peaky-faced little creature she seemed, her face old for her body.\n\n\"How old are you?\" she asked.\n\n\"Fifteen.\"\n\n('Oh, she's fifteen,' Elsie thought. 'She's quite a girl. I thought she wasn't more than eleven or twelve. Not a mere child. Quite a pal.')\n\nThere was a superficial wound on the flesh of the abdomen, and some abrasions above the ribs. She, too, was weak with shock and privation. She needed stimulants, hot-water bottles, blankets, good food. As well ask for the moon. Anyhow, she could spare them both a little of the brandy. There would be a bowl of watery soup in a minute, and a grey potato each. She went on poking away with her hard fingertips. A thin leather belt fastened round the girl's waist had some string suspended from it. She pulled on the string and drew up a small wash-leather bag which had been hanging between the thighs. Yes, of course. It was not the first time she had come across a bag like that.\n\n\"Precious stones?\" she asked Elsie.\n\nElsie nodded. What else could it be?\n\n\"Very well.\" She replaced them, and shrugged her shoulders. Doubtless the mother had her load of jewels too. A fat lot of use they'd be to them, if they were as many and as large as the Shah of Persia's. \"We'll do what we can for you,\" the doctor said, \"and it's not much. Anyhow, you can have some clothes. There's no shortage of those.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" muttered Elsie. Even the clothes of dead women would be preferable to garments that felt more like gravel than cloth.\n\n* * * * *\n\nFive hours, ten hours passed, and Mila did not awaken. There were moments when a sudden wild fear took possession of the older woman: the girl had stopped breathing, she was dead. But no. The breath still hovered above the lips like the odour above fruit. A trace of colour was coming back into the cheeks.\n\nShe herself was sleepy too. She needed desperately the refreshment of an hour or two's sleep. But she fought hard against it. Anything might happen to Mila while her vigilance was relaxed. She might die, or someone might spirit her away.\n\nBut fatigue claimed her. She slept. Then she awoke. She looked round and saw that Mila was still sleeping.\n\n\"I must get her out somehow. To-morrow, if possible,\" Elsie muttered. \"She's not very strong yet, but time's getting short. They're blasting the place to powder. I must get her out.\" She looked round as if she expected to see a cavernous opening appear in the sweating walls.\n\n\"What did you say?\" asked the woman by her side. The doctor had put Elsie with her earlier on, washing and sterilizing bandages, then rolling them ready for use again. The woman had come from Galicia with her husband and two children, in a draft of Jews who had been told, like some millions of others by the time the tally was complete, that they were to go to a labour camp in the East. But something had happened on the way, and she had been separated from the draft. Elsie had heard the story a dozen times, her companion's mind was like a nipped gramophone record perpetually stuttering over its fracture.\n\n\"Did you say something?\" the woman asked again, turning her head lethargically. Without waiting for a reply, she returned mechanically to her work. \"It was terrible in that truck,\" she went on. \"We were packed so close, no one could move a finger. Avrom was carrying the baby. In the middle of the night the train stopped and the S.S. came with whips to drive us out.\" She looked round as if she expected the S.S. might come into the cellar any moment with their whips. \"It was so dark, and people were crying, and over the noise of the soldiers I heard Avrom. 'Rochel!' he was calling. 'Rochel!'...\"\n\nElsie no longer listened. The woman's voice was a thread in a tapestry of noises, the moan of the wounded, the sleepy buzz of conversation which sometimes sharpened into petulance, the clink of utensils, the voices of children crying with pain or hunger.\n\nIt was the third day in the cellar, but that was an arbitrary measurement of time. Every hour, every minute, every second was weighted with lethargy, so that while the battle, of which reports came through spasmodically, transpired in time, the atmosphere within thickened from layer to layer in a sort of cotton-wool eternity. Above was a city grown fabulous and remote, with a sky and stars for its roof and a wayward and unpredictable weather of disaster for its climate. In contrast, the cellar had the reassurance of a fixed cosmogony. It was larger and more rambling than the cellar which had housed Post Sixteen. One bay was screened off with hessian and served as an operating theatre, another, containing a large rusted boiler, was occupied by serious casualties, one or two lucky ones on camp-beds, but most lying on palliasses or the flagstones. The walls dripped, the air was fetid, reeking of sweat, dirty dressings, and urine. It was like a railway waiting-room crammed with travellers for whom there were no trains and no destination. They would move no further than they were, some having arrived at a stoical resignation which was the nadir of despair, some bitter or querulous, some filled with the hallucination of glory, their eyes shining with feverish happiness. There were also others who crawled out again to continue the fight with one arm or one leg--in any event, to die fighting. Elsie Silver did not see herself as a Boadicea brandishing a spear. But she felt that even she, the least combatant of females, might well have gone up to the fighting in some sudden fit of wild boredom, hurling a stone, perhaps, as it was not likely any more lethal weapon would be assigned to her.\n\nBut she was not alone now. The time had gone when the order of the universe was shaped by the appetite or whim of Elsie Silver. There was Mila to think of. She thought of nothing else from moment to moment under the sweating roof. It was ridiculous to love this small girl so. Why? What claim on her love had she? The questions were as ridiculous as any possible answer. It was all making her head ache. Her eyes were heavy with sleep. The bandages they had given her to unravel slipped from her fingers. She closed her eyes, and was soon sleeping again. Then once more she awoke. She turned at once to Mila. The girl had a bowl of soup beside her to which she was helping herself quite happily. Elsie smiled with pleasure. Mila smiled back. They brought a bowl of soup over to her too. She ate greedily.\n\n\"Good, yes?\" she asked Mila. Mila nodded. She sighed, and lay back, half-dozing. Then, it may have been ten minutes later, or half an hour later, she felt the touch of a hand on her own. The touch was very light, so as not to awaken her if she slept. She opened her eyes. The girl's eyes were not far from her own, staring into them curiously.\n\n\"Who are you, please?\" the girl asked.\n\n\"My name is Channah. Are you feeling better now?\"\n\n\"Channah? Yes, Channah, I am feeling better.\"\n\n\"Where are you from, Mila?\" The girl turned her head away. Elsie reached for her hand and stroked it gently. \"Say nothing. Only when you wish to. Rest now, you are very tired.\"\n\nThe girl turned her head again.\n\n\"We were from Ploçk,\" she whispered. That was the last she said for half an hour or more. Then at last she spoke again. \"She was very beautiful. You are not so beautiful, but you are kind.\" She was obviously speaking of her mother, and her mother obviously was dead.\n\n\"I want to look after you, because she isn't here,\" breathed Elsie. \"Is there--were you with anyone else?\"\n\nMila's voice in answer was almost inaudible.\n\n\"My father... we heard that a friend from Ploçk was in the Post, a doctor. And we were finding our way. Then he cried out loudly. It was--it was his heart again.... He fell down....\"\n\n\"Mila, Mila, you must not speak of it, only when you are strong again.\"\n\n\"I will be strong soon. I am not strong now.\"\n\n\"Quiet. You must rest. Put your head on my shoulder again. There, there.\" She felt the girl's fingers tighten round her own.\n\nSo Mila had been down here in the labyrinth with her father. And he had had an attack of angina, probably, which had finished him off.\n\nElsie waited a little time till she felt the grief in the girl's heart was a little less turbulent. Then she spoke.\n\n\"If they were here, would they want you to stay here--for ever?\" The girl opened her eyes wide. \"Would they?\" Elsie insisted gently.\n\n\"No, they would not want me to die here. He did not want to die here, nor my mother either. But we shall all die here, of course.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Elsie. Her voice was quite harsh. \"I am going to try and get you out. You must help me, Mila. You must be good.\"\n\nThe girl's mind tried to get to grips with the thought. It was not necessary to die here. It had not been ordained by God for people to die here. It was being said that it might be possible for people to get out of here... away from cellars, and people dying, and the smell of blood and bandages.\n\n\"I will be good, Channah,\" murmured Mila. \"I will try and help. How do we get out, Channah?\"\n\nHow? That was only one question. Whither would they go? To do what? For the time being it was enough to answer the first question. How?\n\n\"I want to think now, Mila,\" she said. \"I want to think what can be done.\" She took in hand the grubby bandages in her lap and started to straighten them out and roll them. The woman from Galicia was talking. She had been talking the whole time. It was like water dripping from a bad tap.\n\nHow to get out? She was no fool, and she knew that getting out was going to be inconceivably difficult, particularly now, when the ghetto was not merely sealed off but was being systematically pounded into rubble. Well, if they would be killed, they would be killed, but when you survive a direct hit, you feel from then on that bombs and shells may be for other people, but not for you.\n\nShe had got in, and somehow she would get out. She had been down here some two weeks, as far as she could make out. During that time she had been pretty prostrate, yet, despite herself, she had heard and seen things; she had learned a great deal. She knew, for instance, that quite a number of young men and women had been steadily coming in and going out for months and months. Some of them had taken children out and carried them off to safety somewhere. But for the most part they had been smuggling in arms and supplies and money, and had then gone out for more. The traffic had not wholly ceased even during these recent days of the culminating onslaught.\n\nBut these people were connected with some organization or other, the Jewish Youth Fighters, the Polish or Russian underground movements, and with these the widow of General von Brockenburg had less than no contact. Was there anyone at all to whom she could address herself? Post Sixteen had gone, and with it the few acquaintances she had made in the ghetto. Then an answer suggested itself simply and at once. The answer was her one-time lover, Oskar von Straupitz-Kalmin, whom she had loved to distraction years ago in Berlin, and had chanced to meet again in Warsaw when she had come here to be with her husband during his last hours. It was he who, through the agency of a certain Wolff, a master-baker, had arranged for her disappearance underground in the ghetto. That was to be for a few days only, until the hounds of Himmler had stopped baying for her blood. But the Battle had broken out, and she had stayed down in the labyrinths for longer than that; she had hoped she would die down here.\n\nIt was Oskar von Straupitz-Kalmin who had got her down here. It was he who must get her out again, and with her the girl she had rescued under the pulverized pavements. But she realized at once that the job of contacting Oskar, if he still survived, was, in fact, exactly the job of getting out. If he survived, always assuming he still survived, he was beyond the circle of roaring fire that hemmed in the ghetto. He might as well be a thousand miles away as one mile.\n\nThen the secondary figure of the agent, Wolff, superimposed itself upon that of Oskar, Wolff in his ubiquitous bowler hat and greeny-grey suit dusted with flour. Oskar had delegated her to Wolff; Wolff had provided false papers for her; it was to his own house in the ghetto Wolff had brought her, and from that house she had fled raving into the cellars. She had seen Wolff only once again, some five days later. He had called her aside and offered to take her out of the ghetto by a secret route. He thought it only fair he should try to restore to Oskar the woman friend he had confided to his charge. But Elsie had said she did not want to go; she saw no reason why she should not stay on and die there, in the ghetto cellars.\n\nBut, anyhow, where was Wolff now? He had seemed a curious sort of fellow, occupied with other more secret jobs than baking bread. He might be dead. He might have left the place by his own secret route. But the chances were that, sooner or later, if he survived, he would find his way to this intact cellar. Then it occurred to her that there was one person, down there, in Post Four, who might conceivably help her, and that was Frau Cohen-Berger, the doctor-in-charge, who (she was certain) played a part in the Battle quite apart from her medical duties. Out of the corner of her eye Elsie noticed the curtains that screened the operating bay drawn apart. The doctor came out kneading her tired hands, and walked towards the far end of the cellar where the cook kept a cauldron of thin soup on the boil. Elsie got up from the heap of thread-bare bandages which she was rolling with the help of the woman from Galicia. The woman was telling her tale again. She went on telling her tale without realizing that Elsie was not beside her.\n\n\"Excuse me, doctor,\" Elsie started, pulling at her sleeve.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the doctor abruptly. Her eyes were grey and uncompromising. You might as well appeal to a lump of granite, they seemed to say. Things have gone too far for pity. Everyone must prepare to die with as much dignity as he can muster.\n\n\"There's something I want to ask you,\" Elsie began. But the woman stopped her.\n\n\"You want to know if there's any chance of getting out of the ghetto?\"\n\nElsie was conscious of a flare of resentment.\n\n\"Why do you say that?\" she objected. \"As a matter of fact, I was going to suggest....\" She tried to think out some technical matter she might bring up. But you could not deceive those level grey eyes.\n\n\"Quite right,\" Elsie muttered. \"I was.\"\n\n\"Don't worry,\" the doctor said, a shade more kindly. \"I'm asked that twenty times a day. Even the toughest ones have their moments. You're thinking of your daughter, of course.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You must try and face up to it. There isn't a hope of surviving.\" She looked round. She didn't want to be overheard. It was a simple and obvious statement of fact, but it sounded a little harsh put into plain words. \"Think of it from the girl's point of view. Supposing it wasn't impossible, and you got her out. You don't want me to go on, do you?\"\n\n\"We all know what it's like out there.\"\n\n\"At the best you'd just prolong her sufferings. For every Jew who survives, not merely in Warsaw but in Poland, God will have to enact a separate miracle. And there are no miracles.\"\n\n\"I'm prepared to take a chance,\" muttered Elsie.\n\nThe doctor turned away.\n\n\"I'm sorry. You know how it is. I must see what food's left. There's practically nothing coming in.\"\n\n\"Please,\" demanded Elsie. She tugged at her sleeve again. She looked very forbidding.\n\n\"What's happened to Wolff, the master-baker?\" Elsie whispered urgently.\n\nThe doctor's lips tightened, as if to keep back some cutting answer. Then she thrust off without a word. Elsie returned to her mattress.\n\n\"Well, what happened?\" a voice demanded eagerly. It was the woman from Galicia. \"Did she let you have something? They say a whole sausage was brought in to-day. Sometimes I've begged her on my knees for a crust, but she wouldn't drop you even a crumb. She's just as bad as the Germans. Avrom was carrying the baby when we went off. Then, in the middle of the night, the train stopped....\"\n\n* * * * *\n\nIt was some two hours later that Elsie saw Wolff. He had materialized so suddenly that for an instant she thought he was an hallucination. He was standing with a group by the hessian curtain in front of the operating-couch. His old-fashioned bowler hat was on his head, with such an architectural quality of permanence that it was the bowler hat rather than the flesh-and-blood man that made her realize he was substance, not shadow. The bowler hat had already survived tall churches, spacious warehouses, great blocks of flats. The man himself would probably die, but some day the bowler hat would turn up again, only slightly dinted, in a hollow among the mounded rubble of the Warsaw ghetto, rimmed round with purple willow-weed. The greeny-grey suit had no superficial hoar-frost of flour; the greyness was from the dust of former bakings deeply impregnated into the fabric. In the short while since she had seen him his face had changed a good deal. His plump face was thinner, with a pinched look about the mouth. The clothes hung loosely on his frame. But when he saw who this woman was who strode towards him so urgently he smiled warmly as at an old friend.\n\n\"How are you, Fräulein? So you happened to be out of the way. Congratulations.\" He hesitated a moment and smiled sadly. \"If congratulations are in order.\"\n\n\"Herr Wolff, I want to speak to you.\"\n\nHe inclined his head courteously, and gestured with his hand as if the entire cellar was his private office and it was at her service.\n\n\"By all means, Fräulein,\" he murmured. He walked away with her a few paces, till they were out of earshot. She turned to him abruptly.\n\n\"Last time we met you asked me if I wanted to get out of here. I didn't want to go then, but I do now. I've taken charge of that young girl there. She's Polish, from Ploçk. You see her? She's alone in the world. I want to know what are the chances of getting her out.\"\n\nHe looked at her sadly.\n\n\"Fräulein, I was asked by your friend to do what I could for you. It's all different now. I'm afraid....\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\nHe said nothing. He shook his head.\n\n\"There's no hope?\"\n\n\"Hope's just a word, and a word that means nothing any more. You're asking the impossible. Things are getting more desperate every hour and the only route into the city is reserved for the few supplies we're still receiving, at immense risk to the people concerned.\" He looked at her as if to beg her not to press him further.\n\n\"Apart from this route you've mentioned--is there absolutely nothing else?\"\n\n\"Nothing, Fräulein.\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\nHe shifted his glance from her face but did not answer. Suddenly he turned on his heel and was gone. Elsie stood for some moments, dazed and incredulous, as if she had to convince herself that he had not been an apparition after all. Why had he been forced to turn his eyes from her? Was it because he was ashamed he could do nothing for her? Or was he ashamed because he could and would not? Did he feel that he was letting Oskar down, Oskar the one-time Junker aristocrat, who still possessed so preposterous a charm that even a Jew enmeshed in the Warsaw ghetto could not gainsay it?\n\nAnd what news, if any, had he of Oskar? He might at least have spared time to answer that, however null the rest of his tale was. She shook her head miserably and shuffled back to her place against the wall. It was some half-hour later that, on raising her eyes from the job that had been assigned her, she saw the bowler hat move through the semi-darkness towards the exit from the cellar. She was not certain that it was not a product of her own despondent imagination until she saw the bowler hat enter once more and leave by the opposite exit. This time she was aware of a slight movement in Wolff's left hand. The hand raised itself from the wrist, the five fingers erect. She understood. Five minutes later she rose and went out after him. She came across him in a recess at the end of the passage.\n\n\"Go on if anyone comes,\" he whispered. \"There's something I didn't tell you. There might be a way.\"\n\n\"You can trust me,\" she murmured. He stared at her hard. \"I believe I can,\" he decided. \"Listen. The time's up. The fact is\"--there was an almost imperceptible hesitation--\"I've been tidying up.\" He poked his head out from the recess and looked right and left.\n\nShe nodded. She understood. He proposed to make a getaway on his own. Well, who could blame who, for anything?\n\n\"If you can make it, it will cost money. I've got some zloty for you.\"\n\n\"That's all right,\" she assured him. \"We've got one or two pieces of....\"\n\n\"Yes, of course,\" he interrupted her. Then he was silent for some moments. \"You know it will be hard enough on your own. Having someone with you makes it ten times more difficult.\"\n\nIt was as if a lump of ice was pressed up against her heart's flesh. \"She's the reason I'm trying to go,\" she said quietly.\n\n\"Very well.\" He shrugged his shoulders. \"What's your idea? What do you hope to do?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I want to take her away.\"\n\n\"You don't talk Polish, do you?\" he asked suddenly.\n\n\"No. Just the few words I've picked up down here.\"\n\nHe slapped his thigh.\n\n\"You can't get away; not out of the town, I mean. Don't you see that?\"\n\n\"I don't see.\"\n\n\"I mean, it doesn't matter what false papers are made out for you, you daren't move more than a few yards if you don't talk Polish. Don't you see?\" His voice sounded quite fretful. \"You might go on for days, then one day you're stopped every five yards. Papers are not enough.\" Despair began to creep along her veins. Her eyelids twitched. \"No.\" He shook his head decisively. \"We could get you beyond the Wall. You could go to earth somewhere in Warsaw, though it's much harder for two than for one, as I've told you. And that's all. You'd probably have to separate, and wait in a cellar or a bricked-up room with a concealed door till it's all over. There are other people around the place doing exactly the same thing.\"\n\n\"Other people have got away from Warsaw,\" she muttered. \"We'll do it.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. But they were young and as hard as nails. People who could live in a cowshed for days and days. Or lie under a culvert, chewing grass. And they'd be alone. And they'd talk the language.\"\n\nThen an idea tapped like a hammer against her forehead.\n\n\"The language? Of course I talk the language.\"\n\n\"But you just said....\" he stammered.\n\n\"The Herrensprache, Herr Wolff. I talk the language of the supermen. Listen.\" The ideas were flooding through her brain, almost too quickly for her tongue to keep pace with them. \"You can arrange to get us out of the ghetto, you say? Well and good. Into some place on the other side of the Wall? Fine. Well, it's not enough. I've got to get away, for reasons of my own, away from Warsaw. It may be all right for some people to stay in here. Not for me; not for us. I shall be a Volksdeutsche. Do you understand? You can get papers for a Volksdeutsche as for anybody else?\"\n\n\"I suppose so. If they're false, they're false.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll show them how to be a Volksdeutsche. I'll make the Germans themselves feel below standard. I've had experience, Herr Wolff. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"I understand.\" He understood why Oskar von Straupitz-Kalmin set such store by her. She was certainly a woman of quality.\n\n\"Quick. Let's work out some story, here and now.\" She was feverish with inspiration. \"I'm volksdeutsche, from some town not far from the German frontier. No. I'm not merely volksdeutsche. I'm deutsche. It was my husband who was volksdeutsche. My husband had a factory, a textile factory. Like my own father, in fact, Herr Wolff, for your private ear. Tell me a small manufacturing town near the frontier, will you? Quick.\"\n\n\"Bielsko,\" said Wolff.\n\n\"Very well, Bielsko. My husband had to spend most of his time in Bielsko, where the business was. I loathed the place and the people. I lived most of my life in Germany, even after I got married. In Hamburg, say, or Berlin. That's the sort of papers they'll have to make up for me. You get it?\"\n\n\"Yes, but....\"\n\nShe would not allow herself to be interrupted. \"Then there's Mila.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he added grimly. \"She's in Warsaw, after all, not in Bielsko.\"\n\nProblems stood up against her no more than a match-stalk in a flooding gutter.\n\n\"Mila? She's my niece, my husband's niece, that is to say. Her mother and father were killed in Warsaw recently, somewhere in the outskirts. They thought they were fairly safe. The child's in a bad state. So I've come up to Warsaw to take charge of her and give her a holiday somewhere. Have you any idea where? Somewhere up in the mountains.\"\n\n\"Mountains? The only mountains are south, of course.\"\n\n\"South? That's perfect. That's on the way, isn't it?\"\n\n\"On the way where?\"\n\n\"To Hungary, the Balkans, the sea.\"\n\n\"The sea,\" he repeated. \"The sea.\" His voice was remote and impersonal as the sea itself. Silence fell between them. The light died slowly out of her eyes. The blood slackened in her pulses.\n\n\"My dear Fräulein,\" Wolff murmured at length. \"You are jumping. Like an antelope.\" He sighed and shook his head. \"It is a long way to the south. It is a long way even to Warsaw. Now please listen to me for a few moments. I don't wish to discourage you. What for? You can build up in your own mind whatever story you like, for yourself and the girl. But papers are papers. They are not stories. They are just to show, in case somebody asks for them. If they are satisfied, and they give them back straight away, well and good. If they are not satisfied, and the papers are looked into--it is no good at all. The only thing I can say is they will be the best papers that can be found.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course.\" She felt deflated. She must keep her imagination in hand. She must not jump... like an antelope.\n\n\"The papers may be made specially for you,\" Wolff was saying. \"Or they may find real papers of two people who are dead. The girl speaks good German, yes?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"It is perhaps simpler you should be mother and daughter. We will see.\"\n\n\"Yes. Mother and daughter,\" Elsie whispered. The words were like bubbles in wine.\n\n\"It is a strange thing with papers,\" he went on. \"The only thing is courage. Well, enough of words now.\" He came out of the recess where they had been speaking. \"I must have some time to work things out. Let me ask once more. You truly want to go?\"\n\nShe repeated his words. \"The only thing is courage. Isn't that so?\"\n\n\"Fine. We'll meet here; five minutes after the young student goes off duty. That's about three hours after midnight.\" The bowler hat rolled on, as if there was no man beneath.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe hours went by. Down there it was always the same, the same dark twilight, mistily punctuated by lamplight and candlelight; the reverberation of gunfire, the coming and going, the muttering and moaning, the sudden sharp spurt of temper. When was daytime? When was night? Somehow the human creature knows, it is one of those things we retain knowledge of almost to the end.\n\nFrau Doktor Cohen-Berger suspended her enormously protracted spell of duty. The young student took over from her. He, too, at length took himself to his palliasse. If there was a dead hour in the Post it was now, with even Death a little more torpid than he had been. It was life obscurely striving to maintain itself till the unseen dawn broke, to receive through the ruin of wall and floor a last little wallet of light and air to carry beyond the threshold.\n\n\"It's three o'clock now,\" Elsie told herself. The girl was asleep beside her. She touched her gently on the shoulder. \"Mila, come.\" It was not easy to wake her. \"Mila, come.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\" The girl awoke startled.\n\n\"We're going out.\" Elsie rose from the mattress. They had each been given a coat, but she thought it better to leave the two coats behind. It would look as if they were slipping out for a moment. Besides, they would certainly have to acquire some fresh clothing when they got beyond the Wall.\n\nMila rose. She understood. There may already have been a fair amount in her young life of rising and slipping away quietly.\n\nWolff was waiting for them in the recess, as arranged. \"For the present, keep your distance,\" he whispered. \"Here's a torch for you. If you're challenged, say you can't rest. You're trying to find your husband.\"\n\n\"Fine. Go forward. Remember the child's still weak,\" returned Elsie. Then she bent down and whispered into Mila's ear: \"You understand, Mila? We're now going to try to get out.\" Mila pressed her hand. \"If it gets too much for you, we'll rest. See?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" murmured Mila.\n\nThey set out. They moved for some time from passage to cellar, from cellar to tunnel. The journey was on several levels, up and down sloping ramps and flights of stone stairs, through trap-doors and lifted gratings. Once or twice, when they had penetrated deep down, and thick blankets of earth and masonry insulated them, they were plunged into a frightening silence. Sometimes the insulating layers were so thin that they could clearly hear the clatter of the Battle. The catacomb world was by no means unoccupied. Men and women with invisible faces overtook them or came towards them on errands, public or private. Once Wolff's torch picked out two men some distance ahead of them, who suddenly ducked and hid as if they too were engaged in some secret occupation for which they wished no witnesses; perhaps, with no Wolff to aid them, they were searching for the end of the thread which might lead them out of the labyrinth. Their nerve, maybe, had failed; the will to die can snap, no less than the will to live. Or perhaps they had some urgent message to deliver, which they must keep hidden even from their leader. Like rats they scuttled, and were invisible.\n\nWolff took his time. He was aware that the two females he was conducting were not sturdy farm-girls. He stopped frequently.\n\n\"Are you all right? And the girl, too?\"\n\n\"It's a bit longer than I thought,\" Elsie murmured. \"When do we get into the sewers?\"\n\n\"Oh no. We don't get into the sewers this way, that's why it takes longer. There's only one sewer exit now, and they might be on to it any time. A part of the route has caved in. We've got to come above ground; a narrow passage that bears down upon Krochmalna Street. You remember it?\"\n\n\"No, I've not been here long.\"\n\n\"Of course not. Our boys overlook the passage from one side, the Germans from the other.\" He stopped and looked at the girl. \"We're liable to be fired on from both sides if they see anything moving. But it's dark. It ought to be all right, if we take it carefully. Can the child make it?\"\n\n\"I'm not a child,\" asserted Mila quite vigorously. \"I'm fifteen.\" Her whole being was freshening up in the excitement of the adventure. \"I'll make it, if you will.\"\n\n\"We know we're not embarking on a school picnic,\" said Elsie severely. Wolff grimaced and moved on. The way led, as before, across cellars, through trap-doors, up ladders; then suddenly, as they emerged from a coal-chute, air struck clean in their nostrils.\n\n\"Wait,\" whispered Wolff. He stuck his head out cautiously, looked upward, and left and right. \"It's all right. Move slowly. Don't make a sound.\" There was a sudden pop-pop of mortar-fire. \"That's all right,\" he assured them. \"It's not for us. Are you all right, both of you?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" cried Mila.\n\n\"Of course we're all right,\" said Elsie, with less enthusiasm but with dignity. They thrust out on all fours.\n\nAt my time of life, thought Elsie. But of course it isn't really happening.\n\nSuddenly the whole sky lit up as if a furnace door were swung open, then shut again.\n\n\"Down!\" said Wolff.\n\nThey threw themselves down and lay flat as lizards. Wolff removed his bowler hat and set it down before him, as if it were a fourth member of the party.\n\n\"There, on the right! Do you see it?\" he whispered. \"The Wall! We're not far now!\" The ghetto Wall swung, squat and dark, just above eye-level beyond a canyon sliced from the street buildings by a bomb. He spoke of it as if it were any wall that might shut off any recreation park. It had become a casual object in the landscape of his movements.\n\nThe Wall, thought Elsie. Yes, the Wall. Higher than mountains. Higher than the mountains where the Tibetan monasteries are. Not too high for Elsie with her blood up, she told herself with the ghost of a smile.\n\n\"Now!\" ordered Wolff.\n\nThey scuttled forward again, crouched immobile once or twice again. At last they reached a hole in the left-hand wall hemmed round by a close of rubble. It must have been the egress from a sewer once, for the way was down an iron ladder encrusted with hard filth. A connecting passage led straight into a large cellar.\n\n\"We'll stop here,\" said Wolff. \"It's fairly dry in this corner.\" He shone his torch to show them where he meant. \"I want you to sit down. There are a few things I must say to you. It's fairly safe here. Nobody from the ghetto is likely to stumble upon us, and the Germans still don't know about this way out,\" He shone his torch on his watch. \"We've made good time,\" he stated. \"I've started things moving since we spoke earlier on. In half an hour or so Sem will be here. He's all right. He's a Pole, from Warsaw. But he's all right. He'll take you to Marta, the old woman, and get your papers for you. Understand?\"\n\nShe understood. She had not had any training in conspiracy, but she learned fast. If Wolff was a person of some importance in this obscure clandestine world, there must be a buffer between himself and the next contact to which they might be assigned.\n\n\"I'll be leaving you after I've had a few words with Sem. After that it will be up to you. Had this happened when I first suggested it, I could have handed you over to your friend. Now....\" he shrugged his shoulders. \"It's different now.\"\n\n\"Will you tell me,\" she asked him. \"Is he alive or dead?\" Even as she spoke she knew what the answer was, and she knew that the answer caused no pang in her heart.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Wolff said shortly. For him, too, it was not a subject to dawdle over. \"I'm not asking who you are. I've never asked anyone, of course, and no one told me.\" He turned to the girl. \"And you, Mila. Have you understood all we've said?\"\n\n\"Everything, thank you.\"\n\nHe held up his torch to her face, so that he could scrutinize it more carefully than he had been able to till now.\n\n\"An expert would know you're both Jewish,\" he observed. \"With the girl he need not be an expert.\"\n\nElsie reached her arm round Mila's shoulders, and pressed her close.\n\n\"You are not right, I think.\"\n\n\"If it's better for Channah to go alone,\" said Mila, \"let her go alone.\"\n\n\"Please,\" exclaimed Elsie urgently. \"You're upsetting the child! Let the matter be.\"\n\n\"When setting out on an adventure like this we must face all the facts. Listen!\" he cried suddenly. \"That's Sem! He's coming! Quiet!\" Elsie and Mila turned their heads sharply and heard the sound of stealthy feet approaching. Then a voice came, tense and low.\n\n\"Sem!\" the voice announced.\n\n\"Lob!\" returned Wolff. Doubtless Wolff had almost as many names as there were people he had dealings with. \"It's me! They're both here!\" He was speaking Polish. \"Come through!\"\n\nA young man came through from the passage beyond the cellar. With one hand Wolff flashed the torch on him. In the other hand he held a pistol with which he covered him. It was Sem right enough. He replaced the pistol where it belonged.\n\n\"I will explain to him,\" Wolff announced. \"His German is not good, but you'll be able to understand each other. And you'll be able to help out, won't you, Mila?\"\n\n\"I think so.\"\n\nHerr Wolff and Sem talked for some minutes. Then the older man handed over a bundle of zloty. There was a movement from Elsie.\n\n\"Please, no!\" Wolff insisted. \"Whatever you have you will need. You have a long way to go. Well, I'll be leaving you now. So, junges Mädchen\"--he turned to Mila--\"good luck to you!\" Mila made the ghost of a curtsy in the darkness. She was a well-bred child.\n\n\"Thank you very much,\" said Mila, a trifle primly.\n\n\"As for you, Fräulein--it seems fitting, doesn't it? I brought you in here. I take you out again.\" He paused a moment and shone his torch up against the clammy ceiling. \"We're in Warsaw now,\" he said, \"at Panska. The Wall was above our heads just back there.\"\n\nElsie reached impulsively for his hands. \"No,\" he said. \"Don't thank me yet. You never know. They may have got wise to the old woman. Besides----\" he hesitated.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"You've not got very far, have you?\" He answered the question himself. \"Further than a great many others, anyway. In any case, it's not me you've got to thank,\" he added gravely. \"You must thank your friend. It may be he won't be in a position to do you any more kindnesses. Good-bye, Fräulein.\" They shook hands. \"I've still got one or two things to clear up. And you, Mila. Good-bye to you both. You'll see them through, Sem. Good luck.\" He took off his bowler hat, replaced it, and moved towards the ghetto again, the whistling bombs, the hurtling shells.\n\n\"Come,\" requested Sem. \"This way.\"\n\nThey followed. There was a descending ramp, another steel ladder, another passage, another cellar.\n\n\"We're almost there,\" said Sem. He pushed aside a clutter of old boxes, buckets, baskets, draining-boards. A tunnel gaped beyond. They entered and crawled along for some ten or twelve yards till they reached another clutter of boxes and baskets, also duly pushed aside. \"We're there,\" Sem announced. They entered a small blind cellar, quite dark except for a faint hint of light low down in the wall ahead. He moved some boxes out of the jumble in the corners. \"Please to sit,\" he said, then took up a length of rusted metal piping that lay against the wall. He lifted it and banged hard against the ceiling, twice, three times. Then he waited for some time, and banged again, twice, three times. Then, at last, after an equal interval, the response came twice, three times.\n\n\"Good,\" Sem said. \"She's in. Not to hurry. We wait till she thinks it's all right.\"\n\nTwenty, thirty minutes passed. Then they heard the sound of someone descending into the adjoining cellar-room. Feet flapped across the floor. Then some heavy piece of furniture was shoved aside. Chinks of light appeared round a trap-door on ground level.\n\n\"The Arc de Triomphe,\" murmured Elsie.\n\n\"Hopingly, not the Brandenburger Tor,\" Sem brought out.\n\n\"Or maybe David's Gate in Jerusalem,\" Mila piped up with startling shrillness.\n\nOh dear, oh dear, Elsie said to herself. A grown-up young woman, with clear ideas about things.\n\nThe trap-door was lifted out of a groove. A dim grey light drizzled through, a dim sour smell.\n\n\"All right,\" a woman's voice complained. \"Don't hang about all day.\" She spoke Polish. A grizzled old head appeared. Wisps of grey hair hung from it like the tatters of a floor-cloth. \"What have you got there?\"\n\n\"A woman and a girl,\" Sem replied. He crawled through, to receive them.\n\n\"Now you, little one,\" said Elsie.\n\nThen suddenly the girl threw both arms round her, and hugged her as if she would never let her go. The frail body was trembling convulsively.\n\n\"Mila, Mila, what is it?\"\n\nShe seemed to have relapsed into the condition of numb terror which had possessed her during the first night and day after the rescue.\n\n\"I don't want to come! I don't want to come!\" she sobbed.\n\n\"All right, sweet one, all right.\" Elsie patted her head. \"It will be all right soon. I, too, am very tired. It has not been an easy journey.\"\n\nThe girl's frightened, Elsie realized, terrified out of her wits, here on the threshold of the huge, hostile, outside world. She has memories of German soldiers beating people with their rifle-butts and kicking them with big nailed boots. There in the ghetto it was wretched, but it had become familiar. People starved, people were killed, but they died among friends: and they had pride in what they were despite their sufferings. It was her father's graveyard, but the child had for a time heard the word Jew uttered with pride and dignity. In the world beyond it was an obscenity and a death-word.\n\n\"Aren't they coming?\" scolded the old woman. \"Do they think I've got nothing else to do?\" She poked her head through again. \"If you want to go back, you're welcome to!\"\n\n\"Mila,\" whispered Elsie. \"Listen, Mila, please. You said your folk would like you to try and get away. Well? Wouldn't they, Mila? Wouldn't they?\"\n\nMila lifted her head. \"I'm sorry, Channah. I'll be good.\" She got down on her knees and went through. Elsie followed.\n\nThey found themselves in a cellar-room just below pavement level. Daylight filtered through a narrow length of thick panes brown with dirt. There was enough light to see that the place was used for washing, obviously on a professional scale. It was evident that when Marta was engaged in her more public calling, a clothes-horse and mangle were drawn against the trap-door that led into the underground ghetto world.\n\n\"How much?\" she was asking Sem. \"I can't risk my skin for nothing. If they catch me....\" She made a gesture as of a knife being drawn across her throat. Elsie understood hardly one word she said, but got the meaning.\n\n\"You know very well, you old crow,\" said Sem. He was quite small, with a curious shock of hair starting upright from his skull, like a cock's comb. He might be a mechanic or a truck-driver.\n\n\"If you haven't got enough,\" Elsie murmured fearfully, \"we could help out.\"\n\n\"It's good she not know you have something more,\" advised Sem. \"Perhaps she find it difficult resisting temptation. Not look frightened, now. If she do any bad thing, she know--bang!\" He placed his forefinger at his head to show the sort of thing that would happen to her. \"Is a fixed price,\" he continued, chiding the old woman comically with his forefinger. \"But she feel she is a good woman for business if we have an argument.\" He took the wad of money from his breast-pocket and peeled off the due amount. The old woman stuck forth a skinny claw with a cry of pleasure, then went off to count up the notes on the flap of the mangle, like a dog going off to crack a bone at his leisure. \"Please to listen, Fräulein,\" Sem continued. \"Soon I go. I get papers like Lob say, for you and girl. He also say you not want to stay in Warsaw.\"\n\n\"No, no. We must get away.\"\n\n\"But where? Is Germans everywhere. Town is more safe than country.\"\n\n\"We want to go to a port somewhere, the sea.\"\n\nHe looked doubtful. \"You mean Gdynia? Dantzig?\"\n\n\"We are going on a ship to Palestine!\" Mila broke in urgently.\n\nSem looked at her compassionately, but said nothing. It was clear he thought Palestine as inaccessible as the moon.\n\n\"Whatever happens, we won't stay in Warsaw,\" insisted Elsie. \"We'll go south. We'll be on our way. What's the next big town south?\"\n\n\"Cracow.\"\n\n\"I was in Cracow,\" said Mila, \"a few times, before... before those people came.\"\n\n\"You see,\" said Elsie, as if that established some point or other. \"So let it be Cracow.\"\n\n\"Let it be Cracow,\" Sem repeated. \"You can hide in Cracow, like you hide in Warsaw. Then, maybe, something will happen.\" It was clear that he did not think it in the least likely that anything propitious would happen. \"But wherever you are and you are out in street, you must hold head like this.\" He lifted his head to show the demeanour they must adopt. \"If not\"--he shrugged his shoulders--\"is nothing no good.\"\n\n\"We will do our best,\" she told him, smiling. But her heart was knocking as she remembered it knocking in the rarefied air on the high top of a Bavarian mountain. \"Won't we, Mila?\" The girl nodded looking from one to the other.\n\n\"I come back in five days, six days,\" said Sem. \"Till then you must be here, not move anywhere.\" He looked round. It was not an endearing place, but it was less distressing in most ways than the place they had just come from. \"The old woman will bring you lady clothing, für Dame, and for girl, also.\" He turned to the old woman, who had some time ago finished counting the money and found a place for it under her skirts. \"I go. No monkey-business now. If anything goes wrong, the Big One will have you cut up into little pieces. Understand?\"\n\n\"That's all right,\" she grinned. She patted the place under the skirts where the money was. So long as it was made worth her while, nothing would go wrong.\n\n\"Good-bye, Fräulein,\" said Sem, \"and you, young one. I come back when all is ready.\" He inclined his head towards each in turn, then stooped to lift up a bundle under the wooden stairway. It was a bag of plumber's tools. Presumably he was a plumber who had come to attend to the taps or something. He climbed into the upper room. They heard his feet over their heads. A door slammed.\n\n\"Hi you!\" the old woman exclaimed, turning to her guests. \"Jew-women! Push that back along here, will you?\" She indicated the heavy mangle.\n\n\"She wants us to push this machine back,\" translated Mila. She went over to it.\n\n\"Don't you dare touch it, Mila!\" commanded Elsie. \"Come on, you!\" She turned to the old woman. \"Come on! Give me a hand!\" She had, after all, been the wife of a great soldier. The woman chewed her own lips as if they were some sort of sticky toffee. Then she shrugged her shoulders, and came up to the machine. Between them the two women got it back where it belonged.\n\n\"Now something to eat and drink,\" Elsie commanded, gesturing with her fingers at her mouth. The girl looked from one woman to the other with bright eyes.\n\n\"Shall I tell her what?\" she asked.\n\n\"She understands!\" said Elsie.\n\nShe understood right enough. Mumbling and bumbling away, she was already flopping in her loose slippers up the wooden stairway.\n\n\"Oh, my God!\" Elsie cried suddenly, and clutched her heart.\n\n\"What's the matter, Channah? What's the matter?\" Terror had jumped into Mila's eyes.\n\n\"Nothing, nothing at all!\" said Elsie quietly. \"I'm sorry I frightened you. Nothing's wrong here.\" She tapped at her heart. It was better to reassure the girl on that score straight away.\n\n\"What was it then?\"\n\n\"Oh, I was just thinking.\"\n\nChannah did not wish to say any more. Mila turned to see if there was anything she could do to make the place a bit more comfortable. Elsie stood a moment or two thinking. Her thoughts were that she had been till a few moments ago, a dim denizen of the Warsaw ghetto, Channah who had been doomed to die, if not from the bomb that had nearly dispatched her, then from one of the twenty deaths that lie waiting for a rat in a closed cellar.\n\nAnd now, a few moments later, she was not merely Channah, she was already something a little more. Already she had jolted the teeth of this Polish harpy. Already she had shown that Elsie Silver was not dead yet, not wholly dead.\n\nBut her heart had turned over not because she was merely excited, she was frightened too. God knows what a devastatingly weak hand she had! Had she already overplayed it at the very outset of a game which would need not only infinite resource but infinite self-control? What was to prevent old Marta walking straight out and coming straight back with a Gestapo patrol? Well, what? You could go on turning the thing round and round in your head till the question creaked inside your skull, like one of those wooden rattles that demented enthusiasts nourish at football games.\n\n\"See we have something hot!\" Elsie suddenly called up the staircase. \"Tell her, Mila, what I said!\" ordered Elsie imperiously.\n\n\"See we have something hot!\" translated Mila.\n\n\"Yes, pani, soon! At once!\" wheezed the old woman.\n\nElsie smiled. It didn't matter how weak the cards were. You must bluff your way through the card-game that was to be played from now on, on a table-top that might cover lands and seas, or might be no bigger than this same rickety table in this same small room.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThere was a tap in the cellar, and a bucket to carry water over to the copper. There were some thin gritty fragments of washing-soap around. They washed and dried themselves on somebody else's towels. They even had the end of a comb between them. They washed and combed their hair, and felt better. Soon the old woman was down with two chunks of bread and a basin of some dark hot liquid which was probably soup, though it may have been an ersatz coffee. She kept her distance from Elsie, and the wrinkled mouth remained pursed in a frozen 'O', as if she felt that her client had some tie-up with a devil; for though the woman was a Jewess, she talked and held herself as if she were a Christian, a German for that matter. The small one seemed to have claws too.\n\n\"You can sleep if you want to, after you eat,\" declared Marta. \"I don't suppose I'll have much time for washing. If anybody knocks, don't worry. It may be somebody with a basket of clothes, though usually I pick up the stuff myself. Anyhow, don't open the door, whoever it is. Stay down here.\"\n\nMila translated. They thanked her. She went off upstairs again. They ate; then they lay down. They had soft things under them and over them, and something to raise their heads.\n\n\"If we can sleep, Mila, well and good,\" murmured Elsie. \"If not, we must just lie down and let time go by. Are you sleepy, Mila?\"\n\nThe girl was silent for some moments. Then: \"Please, Channah, will you tell me?\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, Mila?\"\n\n\"Where do you come from, Channah?\"\n\nShe had known, of course, that questions must come. She knew that with this child there must be no duplicity; Mila must sooner or later know the exact truth, though she would be shocked by it, as any Jew, anywhere in the world, must be shocked by it.\n\n\"I want you to know everything, Mila,\" she said.\n\n\"You were not born in Germany, were you? You aren't like the other Jews from Germany.\"\n\n\"I was born in England, Mila, but I am not English now. I am German, I married a famous German, and you will have to know his name.\"\n\n\"But you're Jewish, Channah?\"\n\n\"I am Jewish. But I have been a bad Jew. I forgot everything. I could have done something, perhaps a good deal. But I did nothing. Only once, there was an old Jew from England, and he came to Germany, and I helped him to get away again. That was all I did. I have been bad.\"\n\n\"You did not do anything to help them--the Germans, I mean? You didn't help them in their wickedness? No, you did not, Channah. I am sure you did not.\"\n\n\"No, I did nothing to help them.\"\n\n\"But you helped us, Channah, down in the cellars of the ghetto. I saw with my own eyes.\"\n\n\"It is a strange story, Mila. I think you're tired now, and you ought to sleep. I'll tell you the whole story, Mila, whenever you ask me. Go to sleep now, Mila.\"\n\n\"Good night, Channah.\"\n\n\"Good night, Mila.\"\n\nBut they did not sleep. Soon the girl spoke again.\n\n\"Channah!\"\n\n\"Yes, Mila?\"\n\n\"Do you think it will be possible?\"\n\n\"To get away, Mila? I don't know. It will be good to try. You are young yet.\"\n\n\"You are not old, Channah.\"\n\n\"We shall have to be clever. We shall have to bluff our way.\" She paused. \"We won't shuffle along, Mila, as if apologizing for something. We must walk with our heads in the air, like that young Pole said.\"\n\n\"Yes, Channah. It isn't we that should feel ashamed. It's them.\" Again there was a brief silence; then once more Mila was speaking. \"Where will we try to get to, Channah?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Anywhere. You should try to sleep, Mila. To a port somewhere, to the quayside. We will get on to a ship.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"I don't know, Mila. I don't know. It depends on where the ship goes to.\"\n\n\"But surely you'd like to go to Eretz Israel? Where else can a Jew go to?\"\n\n\"Why not, if the ship went there?\"\n\n\"But if the ship did not go there, one would have to take another ship.\"\n\n\"Yes, Mila. You're shivering. Come closer. Are you warmer now?\"\n\n\"Why would you not like to go to Eretz Israel?\"\n\n\"I'm getting sleepy, Mila. We will talk again. Some day, perhaps, on a ship, with the sky sharp and blue overhead, and a white road of water behind us.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, Channah,\" the girl said drowsily. \"And there will be seagulls. I have never seen seagulls.\"\n\n\"And porpoises,\" whispered Elsie. \"Good night, little one. It is morning, but we will say good night.\"\n\nThey were very tired and were asleep soon. The German barrage had a fresh lease of life within a half-hour. The house shook over their heads like a rickety truck on a rough road, but it did not awaken them.\n\nChapter II\n\n[I]\n\nIn the air above Marta's house, and in the tormented acres beyond the adjacent Wall, the Battle raged. That was the warp and woof of the fabric of things. It would have been more horrific if, suddenly, the shells had stopped screaming and the bombs thundering, for it would have meant total wilderness had been achieved, total death.\n\nTwice a day the old woman brought their food down to her lodgers. Apart from that she made the pretence that there was no other furniture in her cellar than her washing equipment. Each day she would go out with a basket of clean linen, and come back with the dirty linen. It was strange how those confined odours of soiled clothes, bad soap, and thickening water became more nauseating than the odours of wounds and urine had been in the underground labyrinths of the ghetto. But so it was. Doubtless it was largely a subjective thing. The old woman's clientele included some detachments of German personnel, and the closeness to the soiled vests and underpants of the enemy had an intimate horror that their actual presence might not have provoked.\n\nBut despite the tumult without, and the strain of waiting within, in these odours hardly to be borne, the nights had a strange sweetness outside all previous experience. The woman and the girl were as close to each other as they had been when trapped in the cellar; but physical pain, at least, was gone. Mila talked. Suddenly the girl was possessed of the need to get her story uttered, exhumed out of the dark places of her heart. And Elsie listened, rapt. Though the whole picture of Mila's background did not build itself up during the next few days, a good deal of it was fairly clear by the time they went forth on the next stage of their journey. Certain terms of reference in Mila's world were outside Elsie's experience. It was only later that she saw them all in some sort of perspective, the town Mila was born in, her parents, the young friends here in Warsaw who had been so profound an influence upon her.\n\nMila had been born some fifteen years ago in the small town of Ploçk, a few hours away north-westward on the Vistula. Her father, David Cossor, had come from a family at once prosperous and pious, the leading Jews in their community, importers of fine goods from Czechoslovakia, Bohemian glass, china, wrought iron. The business had taken him regularly to Prague, where he met Mimi, a creature angelic in her beauty, as she emerged from her daughter's spell-bound recollection of her. After Mila was born, the small family regularly spent several months in Prague, both to escape the bleak Polish winter and for the sake of its cosmopolitan culture. During these years David became a devoted 'cultural Zionist', as they termed it, a follower of the principles of Achad Ha'am, who envisaged the Jewish Homeland as a large-scale Hebrew University, a torch of civilization lifted high over the desert wastes of the Near East, a beacon to all mankind, as in the centuries gone by. Both in Ploçk and Prague, David Cossor had been punctilious about Mila's education, secular and Jewish. When the Germans fell on Poland like a thunderbolt, the Cossors, like many small-town Jews, fled to Warsaw, thinking there was more chance of safety there. Either something would happen to arrest the German advance, or they would be well placed for escape towards the southeast. It was not to be foreseen that the Germans and Russians would crack Poland in two, and that on one side of the line the Jews would be at once trapped like animals in cages. David Cossor had been reading the signs more accurately than many, for he had been for some time converting his possessions into jewels, as Jews had bitterly learned how to do for many generations. When he arrived in Warsaw, he lived in comfort for a little time in an apartment in the Jewish quarter, which only began to be so disastrously overcrowded when the Germans put their Jew schemes into operation late in 1940, as they occupied one country after another and siphoned off the Jewish communities into the ghettos they progressively walled-up and sealed off. At the same time the expropriation began, and the circumstances of people like the Cossors were sorely reduced. First, David got through his stock of currency, then he started selling up the jewels, though he always managed to maintain a reserve of diamonds for whatever desperate emergency might lie ahead. Further, he demanded that this reserve should be divided up and concealed on their three persons, for it was well known that with the flash of an axe the members of a family could be separated from each other, and for ever. Meanwhile, both food and housing conditions deteriorated dreadfully. The conditions were not such that a creature as delicate as Mimi Cossor could exist in them, and late in 1941 she died. Mila had adored her mother, with her delicacy and fragile grace, but also she loved her father, and probably came closer to him, now in the time of his bereavement, than she had hitherto. She did what she could to make up for her mother's loss, and thus brought out in herself certain qualities of resource and courage of which she was already to show evidence in the few days following Elsie's discovery of her, stricken numb though she was by a later calamity.\n\nWhile his wife was alive in the ghetto, David Cossor had not been very active in the community. He had been on several committees, and had lectured on art and philosophy to students old and young, in whom a fantastic devotion to the activities of mind and soul developed, the more insistently the trains hooted at the sidings, and the red glare of the ovens winked and flickered from the skies over Treblinka and Ausschwitz. During this period Cossor had devoted most of his energies to the task of maintaining the physical and moral fibre of his wife and daughter. After Mimi's death he felt the necessity for manual labour to take his mind off his grief, and enrolled in the sanitary department, in good company, for a number of men distinguished in the arts and sciences were his colleagues. During this period Mila attended a ghetto school, fervidly Zionist in its outlook. Teachers and pupils filled their days and nights with the mystic dream of Zion, while, at the same time, as enlisted chalutzim, or pioneers, they studied the practical problems of colonization with the zeal of emigrants who might be receiving their permits and travel-warrants in a week or a month.\n\nWhen the ghetto rising broke out towards the end of April, David Cossor and his daughter at once descended into the cellars, to do whatever might be asked of them. Cossor did not survive long. He had tried to hide his heart ailment even from himself, and then it destroyed him on the threshold of Post Sixteen, on the day the bomb fell leaving no survivors there, excepting Mila his daughter, and Elsie Silver, of whom neither would have survived if the other had not been by her side.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe days in the washing-cellar were not uneventful. On the third morning, there was a sound beyond the trap-door hidden by the mangle. After the due formalities a man emerged. He took no more notice of these two females already there than if they, too, were bundles of washing. His days and nights in the Warsaw ghetto were at an end. He disappeared. An hour later Sem arrived to take their passport photographs, his equipment hidden in his plumber's bag of tools. He seemed rather pleased with himself. There had been a useful haul of forms from the official printing-works in Cracow. The next day Wolff turned up. He acknowledged the presence of Elsie and Mila with the flicker of an eyelid. Then he disappeared at once. It could be deduced from various directions that the long agony of the Warsaw ghetto was almost over.\n\nNext day another thing happened. This was a screwed-up piece of newspaper that fell out of a washing-basket that old Marta was emptying on to the floor.\n\n\"A newspaper!\" Elsie said to herself. \"Of course! There is an outside world!\" She unscrewed the piece of print. Marta went on separating the linen. Mila was polishing the shoes with a piece of sacking, though they would undoubtedly be getting other shoes soon. Der Krakauer Zeitung, Elsie read at the head of the sheet of paper. She read the date, too. May the third, 1943, the day the bomb had fallen. The newspaper was four days old now. Cracow. That was an interesting omen. The profusion of swastikas showed exactly the sort of paper it was. Then her heart started beating furiously. It seemed to her that that happened even before her eye consciously registered the man's name. The man's name was Heinrich Himmler.\n\nAt the head of the page there was a respectful paragraph regarding the celebrity's movements. Herr Reichskomissar Himmler had officially pronounced himself well satisfied with the results of his inspection of conditions in Warsaw, the seat of the Gouvernement Général. He was on his way to the secret Headquarters of the Führer himself, to deliver his report in person. He had left Warsaw yesterday, that is to say, some four days before Elsie's reading of the news item.\n\n\"That's terrific!\" she proclaimed, in English. The old woman looked round dubiously, then looked away again. Mila looked up startled, perhaps even a shade frightened.\n\n\"Please, Channah!\" she murmured under her breath.\n\nElsie blushed.\n\n\"Yes, of course, I know. Stupid of me. I'll be more careful in future.\"\n\n\"Good news?\" asked Mila.\n\n\"A gentleman I know has left town. His friends will still be around, but it makes everything easier somehow.\"\n\n\"Mazel tov!\" breathed Mila. \"Good luck!\" There was no harm in talking Hebrew. The old woman did not know one of them was English, but she must know they were both Jews right enough.\n\nElsie turned suddenly to Marta.\n\n\"When are you bringing us our clothes, old woman?\" Her voice was firm and resonant as a schoolmistress. Marta turned her bleary eyes towards Mila.\n\n\"What did she say?\" she quavered, her hand behind her ear. Mila translated. \"Tell the Madame to-night or to-morrow!\"\n\n\"Mila,\" requested Elsie. \"Tell her that won't do. Tell her to leave her washing alone and go out at once and get our outfits for us!\" Mila did as she was bid. The old woman was obviously raising objections. She was busy. She hadn't orders. What about the money? \"Tell her we'll look after her!\" Elsie exclaimed. She herself went up to the old woman, and turned her shoulders round. \"Do you hear, mother of light and sweetness, you'll be all right.\" She repeated the words, always in German: \"You'll be all right.\" She made the universal money gesture, the rubbing of the thumb over the fingertips. \"Understand?\" She clapped the old woman on the back. She chucked her under the chin. The old woman's sooty resistance crumbled. She arched and bridled like a pleased kitten.\n\n\"At once?\" she wanted to know.\n\n\"At once!\"\n\nMarta tittered, stooped down for the empty basket, then went off up the stairs, the soles of her boots flapping. She was back some hours later, grinning all over. This was a cup of conspiracy with cream on top. The lady must be no mere Jewish woman, like those wretched creatures you used to see until recently shuffling under the Wall, hollow-eyed, the yellow star on their arms and on their backs. Perhaps she was just political, perhaps even only criminal, nothing more serious than that.\n\nThe old woman removed a top layer of soiled linen, and there the stuff was: shoes, stockings, underclothes, a girl's felt hat, a modest hat for a grown-up, two outdoor outfits, a coat and skirt for the woman, a coat, dress, and jumper for the girl. There were two hand-bags, too, even some handkerchiefs, and a few articles for the toilet.\n\n\"The stuff doesn't look at all bad,\" murmured Elsie. \"There've been so many people around,\" she said to herself, \"who haven't any use for it any more.\" She picked up the coat and skirt. The style and material were good. The label was that of the Galeries Lafayette in Lyons. \"Lyons!\" she breathed. \"Ah well, Lyons!\" She shrugged her shoulders. One had learned a lot in three weeks of Warsaw. One had, for instance, bandaged a woman who had plaited a gold chain inside the leather handle of a cheap hand-bag. Another woman had sewn some jewels behind the buttons of her coat, covering them over with a little padding and lining. Elsie examined the buttons of the two coats. Her own were hollow, and could take a fair share of the jewels she now carried in the bag suspended from her waist. Mila's buttons could be adapted quite easily, too. \"Altogether more convenient!\" she murmured. \"So long as we always remember to change buttons if ever we change coats!\"\n\nThen she reached for the underclothes. \"What are they like?\" she mused. But suddenly her fingertips recoiled. \"That's all right! That's fine!\" she said aloud. Mila opened her eyes.\n\n\"I've got to be a German woman of good class, my dear, till we get away. And to be it, I must feel it. You, too, must feel Polish, a well-bred little Polish girl.\"\n\n\"Yes, Channah, of course.\"\n\n\"So we must get these things washed at once,\" decided Elsie. \"That's one luxury we can allow ourselves in this guest-house. Tell her, Mila!\" Mila told the old woman. The old woman nodded. It looked as if the old woman would stand on her head, if Elsie told her to stand on her head. \"In the meantime, we must see how this stuff fits,\" decided Elsie. \"We'll try it on.\"\n\nMila nodded. She looked at her own things. They were too simple to go wrong. But the lining had come away from Elsie's coat, a pocket was ripped, the skirt was too long, there were several bits and pieces that made it just not quite right, perhaps added by a later hand since it had been acquired from Lyons.\n\n\"It's not right!\" said Elsie. The suspicion of a tear was in her eye. She felt more helpless and frustrated than she had felt with a mile or two of the ghetto Wall around her, for then she felt nothing at all. \"I can't be a big-shot in this thing.\"\n\n\"I can make it right,\" said Mila. \"She will give me a needle and cotton.\"\n\nFor the next hour or two, Marta washed the underclothes, Mila worked away smartly with the needle and cotton, thimble and scissors. As soon as Marta had gone upstairs with her money, Mila set to work stowing away their jewels inside and behind the coat-buttons. She made a very neat job of it.\n\n\"You're wonderful,\" said Elsie. \"Where did you learn it?\"\n\n\"My mother had golden fingers,\" breathed Mila.\n\n* * * * *\n\nSem came once more, about eight o'clock on the morning of the seventh and last day in the washing-cellar. As ever, he had his bag of plumber's tools with him. Beneath the tools, he carried the documents, inside a grubby envelope wrapped up with a sheaf of spanners and pliers in a dirty length of cloth. Elsie and Mila were wearing their new outfits. A slight deference of hand to heart indicated his awareness of their improved appearances. The Polish manners they talk of, thought Elsie, are not confined to lieutenant-colonels. He handed the papers over. They were made out in the names of Lydia Radbruch, of Frankfort, and Maria, her daughter, unimpeachably Aryan, doubtless, as far as the records went back.\n\n\"From now on you're Maria,\" said Elsie. \"Understand, Maria?\"\n\n\"Yes, mama, I understand. Some day I'll be Mila again....\"\n\n\"Of course, my child.\"\n\nThere was obviously something more Mila wanted to say. Elsie waited.\n\n\"But whatever I call you,\" muttered Mila, \"you'll always be the second mama.\" She had her eyes on the ground. She did not say easily things she felt deeply.\n\n\"Yes,\" whispered Elsie. She wanted to say more than that; she wanted to say that no words anyone had ever said to her had made her feel happier and prouder. But she was tongue-tied. She turned at length to Sem. \"Have you worked out the train?\" she asked.\n\n\"Train to Cracow is ten o'clock,\" he said. \"You go straight to railway station, yes? Better that German ladies should not take tram, and taxis is only four in all Warsaw.\" He ticked them off on his fingers, with a smile--one, two, three, four. \"Better you take ricksha. In Cracow I have address for you, nice people, will look after you good.\"\n\n\"You mean we go into hiding again? But why? We're Germans, aren't we? We've got our papers! Why can't we go to a hotel till we work out the next stage of the journey?\"\n\nHe looked at her curiously, and rather pitifully. The woman had some naïve ideas.\n\n\"Even with real papers, they take people away in a moment, like this\"--he snapped his fingers--\"if they want to take away. It is danger everywhere, but is most dangerous in hotel. You give papers to porter, porter take papers to police. And finish. Understand?\"\n\n\"Yes, I understand.\" She felt like a lump of wood. \"You have an address, then, in Cracow?\"\n\n\"Listen.\" He put his hand to his mouth, and looked up the stairway, as if to make sure old Marta was not eavesdropping. \"The address is St. Philipp Street, seven,\" he whispered, \"by St. Florian's Church. Say again.\" She repeated the words. \"St. Philipp Street, seven.\" \"On ground floor. Door on right. Wait.\" He thought a moment. \"You not speak Polish, pani?\"\n\n\"I speak Polish,\" said Mila.\n\nHe turned to her. \"Whoever comes to the door,\" he said in Polish, \"you ask if Mr. Antek Rangowski lives there. If he comes, he is a man with spectacles and a black beard with a point, like this. Then you say: 'I have come in answer to advertisement to buy a fur coat.' He will then ask you inside. You go in after him. Repeat all that, prosze pani.\" She repeated the instructions. \"Excellent,\" he said. He turned to Elsie again. \"The girl will explain,\" he said. \"Is better you go now. And me\"--he smiled--\"I stay here to look at taps. Old woman!\" he called up the stairs. \"Make ready now!\"\n\n\"It is ready!\" the old woman called down the stairs. \"They're not going to be all day, are they?\" She was getting impatient.\n\n\"Good-bye, Sem! And thank you!\" Elsie said.\n\n\"Dowidzenia, panu!\" said Mila. \"Good-bye!\"\n\nThey shook hands. \"Good-bye! Good fortune!\" said Sem. He turned and belaboured a tap with a hammer. If nothing was wrong with the tap now, there would be quite soon. Elsie and Mila climbed the stairs and entered Marta's ground-floor for the first time. It was not dark, yet the things in the room were in a sort of dark haze, the unmade bed along the wall, the table, the chair, the plaster Madonna in a corner, the smudged bride and bridegroom in a frame. Their vision was directed to the window and the door and the things that might lie beyond them.\n\n\"Wait!\" said the old woman. She picked up a basin of dirty water, went up to the window, opened it, and looked sharply left and right. Then she flung the water into the street. Then she turned again. \"Now go!\" Then the old crone's voice softened. \"The Mother of God go with you!\"\n\n\"Good-bye!\" they both said, went out along the front passage and for one moment stood framed in the threshold, hesitating, as one might hesitate on a beach before venturing a foot into the incalculable sea. Then Elsie banged the door behind her. They turned their heads sharp left, as by agreement, for on their right, not many yards away, was the Wall, the Wall of the ghetto, that dark and brilliant and timeless place. On their left stretched the city, which was like a gigantic time-bomb that might blow up in their faces if they made one false move.\n\nThey intended to walk warily.\n\nThe street was Luçka. The battle seemed to be holding its breath before a final horrific assault. But perhaps you could not call it a battle when only one side had the steel and fire, the other having not much more than their fingernails. There were not many people about. Apart from going to their jobs and coming back from them, and manoeuvring on the daily scrounge for food on the furtive black-market corners, it was safer even for the 'Aryan' Pole to stay indoors. The Germans shot first and asked questions afterwards, and both police and soldiers were free with rifle-butts and hob-nailed boots.\n\nA few doors away there was a couple of children on a doorstep, solemnly snipping away at a piece of cloth; beyond, a lanky woman wheeled a barrow cluttered with valueless oddments, and two old men stared up listlessly following the reconnoitrings of a plane in the middle sky. Luçka led into Wronia. There was more movement there. A tank waddled along the street like a hippopotamus that had emerged from a marsh and had gone out adventuring. A few blocks north an armoured car up against the pavement disgorged a crew of soldiers in grey-green. Now and again the siege guns boomed, like metal doors slamming. Nearer at hand machine-guns rattled. It was curious how slight a protection the coat from Lyons felt against all those things. The legs were hollow, Elsie realized with dismay, like cardboard cylinders. If something heavy suddenly pushed you in front or behind, the legs would give at the knee-joints. She looked sideways down at the girl. The head was up in the air. There was a flush in the pale cheeks. Her own words came back to her. \"We won't shuffle along, Mila, as if we're apologizing for something.\" Her chin thrust up. She squared her shoulders. After all, as the Jewish wife of General von Brockenburg, she had had some training in coolness and courage.\n\nThe way was sharp left into Wronia. From round the corner of Panska an S.S. man appeared and approached them. His face was familiar, those eyes, that chin. Where had she met him before? The answer came to her at once. She had met him all over Germany, in the days when the word 'Nazi' and the thing 'Nazi' was on no one's tongue among all those turbulent millions, excepting for the tongues of a few beer-garden louts. She had loved that chin and those eyes, and for their sake had elected to stay on in Germany, forswearing all else. They had belonged to her lover and her husband. Then, one day, looking out from Herr Wolff's window into a street in the Warsaw ghetto, she had seen an S.S. man with those same features....\n\nAt that moment the S.S. man reached them. Mila was not in his path, but he took a half side-step to send her flying against the wall. The blood roared in Elsie's tem"
