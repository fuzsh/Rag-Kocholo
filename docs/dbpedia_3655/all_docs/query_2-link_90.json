        "text": "Introduction\n\nEdmund Gardner was undoubtedly among the last of a long line of adventurous men from the Island of Nantucket, off the Massachusetts coast, who for more than a hundred years nosed their slow but sturdy ships into many of the far parts of the globe in the dangerous search for whales. As these ships grew larger, more and more of the Nantucket fleet moved to nearby New Bedford on the \"continent,\" as the Islanders called it, and among the last active captains to move was Edmund Gardner. Few other whalemen could have had more exciting adventures than he. Fortunately for posterity, Captain Gardner lived a long life, within a month of ninety-one years, and as he was getting old he took to writing down in his Journal a story of his adventures, his thoughts and his philosophy. For nearly a century this Journal has been treasured by his comparatively few descendants and read with great interest by them and a very few others.\n\nWhen John Huston's \"Moby Dick,\" a remarkable moving picture, following extraordinarily closely Herman Melville's great story of the crazed Ahab and the white whale, had its premiere showing at three theaters in New Bedford in June 1956, there was considerable discussion among people who were not familiar with whaling, which had vanished from the local scene for fifty years or so, as to whether a whaleship could actually be sunk by a whale, and whether such close hand to hand encounters between man and monster as were depicted actually occurred. At that time it seemed to me that the Journal of my great great grandfather should be printed, as he was one of the few whose ship was actually sunk by a whale, and as he was also one of very few, if any others there were, to be actually crushed in a whale's jaws and to survive to tell the tale.\n\nThe sinking of Captain Gardner's ship \"Union\" in 1807 was not as dramatic as the sinking of the \"Essex\" in 1820 and of the \"Ann Alexander\" in 1851, as these two ships were sunk in battles with whales, much as Melville tells of the sinking of the \"Pequod\" by Moby Dick. The \"Union\" might have been a merchant ship for all the whale knew. She and he merely collided in the night. The \"Union\" was stove in and she promptly sank, in mid-ocean. A similar fate met the \"Kathleen\" in 1902. The youthful skipper of the \"Union\" had to bring his crew to land, over seven hundred miles\n\n2 CAPTAIN EDMUND GARDNER, HIS JOURNAL.\n\nof stormy ocean in open boats, under many hardships, and he did so successfully. He was only 22 at the time. Melville says in chapter 44 of \"Moby Dick\" as to this event, after telling graphically of the sinking of the \"Essex,\"\n\n\"Secondly: The ship `Union' of Nantucket was in the year 1807 totally lost off the Azores by a similar onset, but the authentic particulars of this encounter I have never chanced to encounter, though from whale-hunters I have now and then heard casual allusions to it.\"\n\nIt was partly this remark of Melville's that made me feel more people should be given a chance to read of the \"Union.\" This chapter 44 tells of other sinkings too. The others I have mentioned were subsequent to the writing of \"Moby Dick.\"\n\nIn speaking of Melville, it seems to me unfortunate that when he uses the name Gardner for a Nantucket whaling captain (not as master of the real ship \"Union\" but as master of the mythical \"Rachel\") he spells the name Gardiner. Though Melville had never been in Nantucket, he had sailed from, and stayed considerably in, New Bedford, and should have known that the Gardiners came from Maine or Long Island, and not from Nantucket.\n\nBy the time the second tragedy occurred a little over eight years later Captain Gardner knew much of the world well. When so terribly injured off the coast of Peru, he knew not only what port he should make but of a doctor, living in the hills above the port, who was destined to save his life. This was certainly fortunate for his descendants, for a third tragedy, just after his return home from this adventure, was the loss of his only three living children, all young boys, by death from whooping cough. Those of his children who survived were all born after his return from Peru.\n\nAnother item of interest in his adventurous, though comparatively short, career on the sea was his being one of the first two whaling captains to bring his ship into what he called the Sandwich, and we now call the Hawaiian, Islands. The other captain, Folger, and he were keeping their ships the \"Balaena\" and the \"Equator\" hunting together when this event occurred.\n\nEdmund Gardner was still quite young, 42 years old, when he decided to quit the sea. His last voyage was not in pursuit of whales, but was a trading venture to the north of Europe, ending in a very stormy voyage which landed him in New Bedford on New Year's Day 1826. Thereafter he gave up the sea.\n\nIt was on September 7, 1826 that he moved his family to New Bedford, occupying a house on Second Street that he had bought\n\nCAPTAIN EDMUND GARDNER, HIS JOURNAL. 3\n\nin May from George Bliss on land which had belonged to William Rotch, necessitating a deed from William Rotch to Edmund Gardner. In the spring of 1857 he moved to his last house, on the north-west corner of Walnut and Sixth Streets. This house is still standing. As can be seen from the Journal, his activities in New Bedford were many, ship owner, proprietor of a cooperage shop, candle manufacturer, speculator in oil, and bank director among them.\n\nNothing further out of the ordinary occurred except for his breaking his leg during the construction of the Fort (now known as Fort Rodman, formerly Fort Taber) on the end of Clark's Point in New Bedford, on November 3, 1864, five days before his eightieth birthday. although this injury troubled him for the rest of his long life, he surmounted it with great courage, as he did all his other vicissitudes.\n\nCaptain Gardner had very little schooling but he overcame this handicap extremely well with the sole exception of his spelling. He used an entirely phonetic system, and did not always spell the same word the same way. There has been quite a controversy in the family about this spelling. My great grandmother, Lydia Hussey Gardner Spooner, copied the first section of the original Journal and parts of the second in longhand and corrected the spelling. She felt that the spelling reflected on her father and wanted the original destroyed. Luckily she did not have her wish, particularly as she edited the Journal in places, putting in small bits of information which were undoubtedly correct but which her father had neglected to mention. Many of Captain Gardner's grandchildren and their children felt the spelling should be preserved in any reproduction, and some still so feel. With this in view, at least two independent typed copies were made, one of the two duplicated many times. These are supposed to preserve the original spelling, but they do not. Miss Ruth Allen, a great granddaughter of Captain Gardner, who owns the original and one of the typed copies, tells me her version does not always agree with the version that I and many of the descendants have. And after careful comparison with the original, I know that our typed version is very inaccurate, sometimes spelling words wrong when Grandfather Gardner, by some great luck, had them right. It has been argued that as he taught school for a while his spelling must have been correct for his day. This is just not so. His phraseology is usually reasonably good, probably because of much reading of the Bible, and he undoubtedly spoke good English. But he certainly did not know how to spell, and partly because it is much more expensive to print and\n\nThe Journal\n\nEdmund Gardner. Having for a long time had it on his mind to leave something that his friends and connections might look upon after his leaving this transitory state, where and what his engagements were, commencing with the nineteenth Century.\n\nI was born and brought up on the Island of Nantucket. Born the 8th of 11th Mo 1784. My Parents were Thomas & Anna Gardner, my ancestors were some of the first settlers of the Island. My Great Grandfather was the first Male white born on the Island, his name was John Swain1, he married the daughter of Peter Folger, her name was Experience Folger. Thus 'twill be shown that my connections were with the first settlers of the Island.\n\nMy Father followed the Sea until the revolution took place separating this Country from Great Britain. After the peace of 1783 he went to sea no more. All my Father's family were born previous to Peace taking place except myself, I being the youngest of ten children. My Father followed farming which we all contributed to in all ways we could to help to provide for our necessities. Two of my elder Brothers followed the sea, and on my arriving at the age of sixteen commenced myself. In 1800, 10 mo 22 was my first attempt in Sloop Dove, Reuben Long Master, was absent seven months, was unsuccessful, returned without any remuneration for services. Our destination on sailing was for the Cape Verde Islands and Coast of Guinea but changed after cruising a month or more for Bahamas, where we arrived after a month's passage and having been some months at sea. 'Twas our Captain's intention to go into a harbor for water, wood and refreshments, where we remained several days accomplishing all our expectations. The name of the place we entered was Marshes Harbor, some ten miles or more from the reefs that surround the Keys of the Bahama Islands. The harbor was thribily land locked, like a basin, 'twas a deep indentation into the Island of Abaca.\n\nWhere were some of the remains of houses formerly occupied by freebooters, I was into several of them, and some of gardens still\n\n6 CAPTAIN EDMUND GARDNER, HIS JOURNAL.\n\nproduce fruit, our water was replenish'd from one of their wells. During our stay at this place, (where we found one man and a boy) the man possessed the information of what would poison the fish. He procured the bark from the root of a tree called dogwood, dried the same and pulverized it, it looked much like light colored snuff. I went in the boat for the purpose of poisoning the fish in the hole (as 'twas called). The entrance was just wide enough for the boat to enter, 'twas three hundred yards in diameter nearly round, with mangrove trees around the shores. The snuff was strewn on the face of the water, in a little time the fish would spring out of the water and fall on the face of the water, apparently dead, we picked them up till we had as many as we wanted, some fine large ones, those that were left on water, after a time came to from their magnetic state, with little effort put themselves in a swimming position went off unharmed. 'Twas a new way of catching fish to me.\n\nWhile at this locality heard several anecdotes in regard to the time this part of the World was little known or frequented, except by Pirates. Harbour Island was well known to my Captain, where was a favorite resort for those freebooters. At which place was an old Lady who kept house of entertainment, she told my Captain that they had never had such good times since they had thirteen black flags flying, \"'twas heavenly times.\" Had the weather very rugged for several weeks saw little prospect and in the month of May directed our course homeward, where we arrived the latter part of that month.\n\nSome little time after my return engaged myself for a sailor to Ship Union, Capt. Grafton Gardner for a Whaling Voyage to the coast of Patagonia, performed the Voyage in eleven months, had taken 1500 barrels Whale oil, 'twas a successful adventure.\n\nThe ship was refitted, and I engaged myself to go in the same ship with the same Captain as an officer for the Coast of Patagonia, had much rugged weather and took but small quantity of oil, when the rugged season advanced, left for the West Coast of Africa, where we arrived in the 6th Mo. 1803. While on the South and West of Africa was in the dominions of Hottentots, saw many of them, had some communication with them. In the later part of one day saw some of the natives on the shore not far from the ships, there were several ships in Walwich ( Walvis) Bay at the time, a boat was sent from each ship. The boat from our Ship I was in, I had never seen any of this singular people before. I looked at them, talked with them (by signs), the number of them were three, an old man, one old and one young females. They talked incessantly, nothing could\n\nCAPTAIN EDMUND GARDNER, HIS JOURNAL. 7\n\nwe understand, after a little time, someone made a noise like the lowing of cattle, when the young woman repeated the sound, and then laid her head on her hand shutting her eyes imitating sleep, then pointing and following the sun 'till down, then going through the sleeping sign, and when the sun arose the third day, the Bullocks, Sheep, and Goats would be there. True to the signs they came, with quite a number of them to drive and care for the stock. Nearly all, or quite all, was purchased by the different Ships in the Bay. They wanted nothing in exchange for the stock but Backasaw and Tentabar, which meant Tobacco and Iron, which was of more value to them than anything offered. The females had bracelets on their arms of iron and brass, some of them must have been young when they had them put on as 'twould have been difficult to get them over their hands.\n\nThere was one thing peculiar to them, that was the many dogs. I several times counted them and the persons with them, and on an average 'twas twenty dogs to each person. Their manners were singular for seldom or ever do they walk, if the distance is not more than ten feet, they run. When approaching strangers, as soon as they can be heard, call out \"tinghoigh\" and continue calling till quite close when they stick their spear in the ground, call \"or' tinghoigh\" and always seem glad to see strangers.\n\nThis singular people have peculiar propensity for filth, they have little clothing, a skin around their loins, the covering for the remainder of the body is made up with filth and greasy substances to close the pores of the skin, they seem to suffer from cold nights. There's another thing peculiar to them, the manner of their sitting, their uniform practice is to sit, or bend down on their feet, through the whole night around a little fire, for fuel is scarce with them. At the time Ships are taking Whales and fresh carcasses drive on shore, they prefer those that have become stale and putrid to fresh ones. Having put my finger on one of their arms which had been well basted with their waterproof the stench was so great that after twice washing my hands with soap, found 'twas not possible to eradicate the stench by washing, had recourse to smoking with a strong smoke. Their color was not African, but a shade or two darker than the Indian, hair curly with many beads wrought into their hair. The Beef they brought to market was fresh in comparison with our long salted provisions, but 'twas not well fleshed neither was it sweet as new Beef generally is, the mutton was better but not equal to Southdown. They must have had scanty pasture. Nothing is to be seen of the surrounding Country but sand hills, the only\n\n8 CAPTAIN EDMUND GARDNER, HIS JOURNAL.\n\ngreen thing near is at the Gardens (so-called) north of the usual anchorage where Samp is to be obtained. By soaking in fresh water, 'tis made pickles of, in place of something better. The natives all have spears neatly wrought from Iron, which would seem impossible to have been wrought cold without some peculiar process.\n\nAfter the season for whaling on the African Coast, left for the Island of St. Helena where we arrived after a short passage, found a large fleet of ships assembled here. For war had taken place between England & France. A convoy was being made up for a homeward passage.\n\nFive Dutch East India Ships came to this Island for refreshments and water, when they were taken possession of by the Officers of English East India Company, who were in possession of the Island at that time. Those ships were dismantled, sails unbent, rudders unhung, waiting for accounts from home Government of war between that Country and Holland, for as yet there was no war. But should there be, they would be good prizes to the East India Company. Such was the feeling of honor and honesty of that rich company. There were more than one hundred and fifty sail of ships seeking supplies at this little Island. Twenty-seven of them were Whaling Ships. During our stay several ships arrived and some passed the Island. On one day in particular, five ships or vessels were in sight from the Island. When two Vessels are in sight, twas an alarm, three, was a general alarm, when every citizen had to repair to his station and post, for all citizens were soldiers on the Island. All places of business were closed, there was great excitement. On the following day two ships arrived, reporting, two of the ships were French, but no Vessel pursued them.\n\nA short time after this exciting time we left for the Brazilian Coast, directed our course for the Island of St. Catherine's for provisions, vegetables and fruits, where they were in abundance. The principal articles of food for the inhabitants was Farinha de Pau which translated would be flour of wood. Tis their principal article for food for the inhabitants. A small quantity of farena and a few oranges will make a satisfactory repast for the inhabitants of this Country. The weather is mild, they want but little clothing to protect them from the weather, and live without much exertion. The oranges are of a superior quality and abundant. Don Alloc in his embassy to China, stopped at this place, the oranges were so fine he thought them equal or superior to any he found in China. They served much towards the support of the Brazilians at the time I was there, in 1803. And continues to be, although many changes have\n\nCAPTAIN EDMUND GARDNER, HIS JOURNAL. 9\n\ntaken place since I was first in this place. In 1815 was there after a mast for the ship Winslow. Again in 1819 for a bowsprit for ship Balmna. I saw many changes in the time that had elapsed since I was first there. Then coffee was raised in small quantities, but having no open trade with any foreign Country there was little encouragement to raise it, for their trade was through Portugal, their Mother Country. Coffee was selling for six cents per pound, half the price 'twas then bringing at Java. Since free trade has been opened to all Nations, the ports of Brazil have been frequented much. More particularly, Rio Janeiro, Bahia, Pernambuco, and intermediate ports.\n\nIn 1825 I visited three ports in Brazil in all of them were Ships trading, from all parts of Europe and America. Shall refer to my last visiting that Country at a future time.\n\nIn 1804 I engaged myself to Ship Union Silas Swain Master in the capacity of second officer performed the Voyage in twenty-one months bringing a full cargo 1500 Barrels. Arrived in 4 Mo 1806. Some few weeks after my arrival was called on to fill the office of first officer of a Ship then fitting, soon upon it my former Captain called on me wishing me to go again with him as first officer in the same ship. I engaged to go with him in the same Ship as first officer, and sailed in 1806, in the 8th Mo. Performed the Voyage in ten months arrived in 7 Mo 1807. Having been steadily going seven years, and six years in the same Ship, had come to the conclusion to remain at home for a year. I was in my twenty-third year and thought to carry out the law of the old testament, when a young man united his destiny with a young woman, he was exempt from war for one year. I had thought of remaining a like time. Being about uniting my destiny with Susan Hussey, which was accomplished on the 25th of 8 Mo 1807. I had no expectation of the owners of the ship Union would tender to me the Command of that Ship, as an experienced Capt. held himself in readiness to take charge of the Ship. On going to the office of the agent of said ship, with my former Captain, who informed me on the way, he should not go again in the ship, should give up going for the present. The agent then tendered to me the command of the ship Union, which was quite unexpected to me. I told him I wanted time to consider the subject fully, I would decide in a few days, on the third day informed the agent I had concluded to take charge of the ship. I then commenced shipping my Officers and ships company, several of the former crew went in the ship with me. Everything was-hurried up, being late for the Coast of Patagonia, and finally sailed the\n\n10 CAPTAIN EDMUND GARDNER, HIS JOURNAL.\n\n19th of the 9 Month 1807. Nothing particular transpired until the 26 Inst. when a severe gale from the westward commenced, we scud under short canvas three days, at noon of the third day the wind moderated so that we spread more sail, the sea was high and running after us, at about ten o'clock the wind having veered more free. I told my second officer to put another compass into the binnacle, he went down got the compass was just coming from the gangway when the ship struck something heavily, the officer came near being thrown into the after hatchway, he catching by combings.\n\nI immediately went and looked over the stern of the ship where I saw and heard a large Whale spout twice. Sail was immediately taken in, for all hands were brought on deck by the concussion. The ship was brought to with the starboard bow to windward, hoping the wound would be out of water or partly so at least. The pumps were set to work one company hoisting up casks to get down to the wound. In the meantime I went into the fore peak where shooks were stowed, removed some of them got down to the place broken, which was three feet wide and four feet long at which place the water had flowed so as to wash over the wound or broken part. Twas ten feet from the stern, and six below the wales. I readily perceived 'twould be useless to attempt to save the ship from filling with water. I had one man with me with a lantern. The outside plank, two timbers and ceiling planks were stove in. I sat down where I then was, and calmly made up my mind what was next to be done. Came to the conclusion to do all that could be done with the blessing of God to preserve the ship's company. I then went on deck told my first officer to quit hoisting and come with me to the cabin. I there informed him 'twas impossible to save the Ship, for she would go down, let us do what we would. I then said to the Mate 'twould be useless to be frightened but pursue a straightforward course to save the ship's company and ourselves.\n\nI then directed him to head up a small cask of bread and have it ready to go into the boat, and that I would prepare a small cask of water to go into the other, both were put into boats before lowering. 'Twas very rugged got one boat down five (one officer) men in the same to keep her clear of the Ship, with a line fast to the ship. I then lowered the second boat, with four men including an officer. Keeping five men, the mate and myself onboard to get another boat from where 'twas stowed, got that one out when we all left the ship. I had previously told the ship's company to take all the fireworks they had and all the tholepins. Had a Compass in each boat, a quadrant, lantern, and everything that could be useful to us, except\n\nCAPTAIN EDMUND GARDNER, HIS JOURNAL. 11\n\nspyglass and trumpet, but as it proved neither would have helped us. The ship's main royal made a sail for each boat. We left the ship at midnight in two hours after the accident, laying by with a warp fast to the ship. Had concluded to remain by the ship till morning, at 1 A. M. the ship rolled and turned oer, as she went over heard the dog cry, which was the first time I had thought of him, should have taken him with me had I thought of him, he having been with me in the ship on a previous Voyage. When the things began to wash from the ship, we left, for fear of their breaking our boats. We kept before the wind 'till morning then made sails for our boats, and directed our course for the Azores or Western Islands, that being in full view before me from the time I had made up my mind to leave the ship.\n\nThe time we left was 1st of 10 Mo 1807 last 38.40 longitude 41.52. On that day saw a schooner far to windward under double reefed sails but blowing heavy could not get to her. Finding it difficult to keep together with three boats, came to the conclusion to let one boat go, taking eight persons in each boat. I then directed each man to put on what clothes they wanted or needed, then clear the boat of all surplus clothing, for they absorbed much water causing too much weight for the boat, we were continually wet after leaving the ship, the water washing on us. The wind the following night veered to the Southwest blowing heavily had to lay by through the night, it rained powerfully the lightning ran down in streams around us, and a more dismal night was never experienced by any of us and 'tis doubtful if any of the survivors have seen a more dismal night since. In the midst of all this terrific scene, the boat in which I was in shipped a sea, filling the boat half full of water, each man with a bucket threw out the water 'till free, when no more of any consequence came in. But through a long dark and dismal night, none could build on longer time of life than five or ten minutes. Our trust was on Divine Providence to bear us up and protect us from harm. Never was it more fully brought to my view than at this time, \"they that go down to the sea, and do business on the great waters, these see the wonders of the Lord in the mighty deep.\"\n\nIt was fully impressed on my mind from the beginning that we should be favored to reach those Islands. At the time I left the ship, were more than a degree south of Flores, directed my course between Corvo and Flores, to be enabled to make a free wind to one of them should we be favored to make them as expected. Had an observation daily. Our daily allowance of water was three quarts, divided between sixteen at noon of each day after determining the\n\n12 CAPTAIN EDMUND GARDNER, HIS JOURNAL.\n\nLatitude, also one cake of bread to each man for the same time. I soon found they could eat no more bread without they had more water. Some of them begged for more water, which I promised when the Land should be in sight.\n\nOn the 8th of 10 Mo 1807 the wind came from the N.N.East, 'twas thick and dark with squalls, it was really a dark day, our water nearly exhausted, night approaching, my boat leaking so that one man was bailing water from the boat continually. All but the man throwing the water from the boat and myself was laying down. I saw him who was bailing earnestly looking, the sail intervened prevented my seeing what he did. I asked him what he saw, his reply was \"I don't know, 'twas something black.\" \" I then looked under the sail and saw the Land a more pleasant sight was never seen. I had awakened my company and told them the land was in sight. I then made a signal for the Mate to come down, he being to windward, when got within hearing I asked him if he saw the land, but he had not seen it. Immediately several of the men called to know if they could have more water. I gave to them three quarts the same as had been daily served to them at Noon, 'twas now 4 P. M. I then told them they should have more when we got into the land. On first seeing the land, 'twas thirty miles distant, bearing from East by South, to South East. The wind breezed on strong with thick weather and rain, had seen nothing for two hours, when the lights broke out suddenly on shore, near the seaside. I then made a division of the last of our water.\n\nWe lay by and rested from nine in evening till midnight, then began rowing from the Southwest part of the Island of Flores, by the south, the shore was inaccessible perpendicular rock for some hundreds of feet in height. I knew of no landing place short of St. Cruise on the Northeast part of the Island. (We passed a landing place on the Southeast part of the Island not known to me before 'twas daylight). On coming to the landing at the principal place of the Island, the Inhabitants came with produce of the Island to market, supposing our ship was nearby behind the land. A Gentleman by name William Greaves was there on the landing, he was interpreter for me, he informed the Inhabitants at the landing of our situation when our boats were taken to a place where they could be taken up from the water to a place of safety.\n\nBy Greaves, I was introduced to our Vice-Consul for the U. S. whose name was John Mercelenra Mesquito Permentall and by him was furnished with everything necessary for myself, Officers and ship's company. After landing I cautioned all my ship's company\n\nCAPTAIN EDMUND GARDNER, HIS JOURNAL. 13\n\nto be careful not to indulge too freely in their thirsty state to injure themselves, but take little and often, 'till their thirst abated. I made it a point to drink once in half an hour. I watched the time, what I drank was about equal to three wine glasses full, 'twas two days before my thirst was fully allayed. One of my ship's company indulged too freely and came near being a serious affair with him.\n\nWe got on shore at 9 A. M. After dining I lay myself down \"tired nature sweet restorer balmy sleep\" and slept about five hours. During the time I was in my boat, slept little, many nights did not sleep, but in the day slept more. Such was my anxiety and that of my company to find relief by some ship or vessel, that they saw many in the night, after calling to me, \"here's a ship\" they could see her plainly, when I came to look and could see nothing, they could hardly be made to believe 'twas all imagination and would then be quite disappointed. I bad a Lascar sailor with me, the same had been in the ship on a previous voyage, talked broken, sometimes hardly intelligibly. I had a young man with me who previously had tried his hand at making money, by taking six and a quarter cent pieces and manufacturing them into twelve and a half cents, passing them for the same.\n\nAmongst Sailors,\" anything that's disreputable is learned as if it were by magic, and treasured up. While in boats, the Lascar said to the young man \"Well Green boy, what think now making ninepence out of fourpenny happenna.\" The Lascar thought 'twas time to make up accounts.\n\nI remained at Flores six weeks, there being no opportunity of leaving the Island. While there some persons from Portugal came there to pack beef. A Gentleman connected with the enterprise desired the use of one of my boats, with a crew to row, to go to the Island of Corvo, they were gone two or three days, and returned seventh day (Saturday). The Gentleman rewarded them bountifuIly. On the following morning, when I was dressing, a message came to me from the Governor for me to come and take care of my men. When I walked to the square in front of the Governor's House, the first thing I saw was one of my men walking with a musket in front of the house. On inquiry found my men being rewarded for pulling the boat to Corvo had purchased some stimulant, after partaking of it freely, went to the Governor's, knocked down the sentry, took from him his gun, and were keeping guard in his place. I soon made arrangements for them to disband, and all things were amicably settled. Sailors will act themselves when they have an opportunity.\n\n14 CAPTAIN EDMUND GARDNER, HIS JOURNAL.\n\nI left Flores in a Portuguese Vessel for Fayal, with my Mate, one other officer and five men. Greaves being a fellow passenger, after a passage of twenty-four hours landed at Port Pin, a bay formed by a peninsula forming one side of the harbor of Fayal. Port Pin is a good harbor except for westerly winds, (which blow directly). On landing was met by our Consul John B. Dabney of Boston, he being Consul general for the Azores. He furnishing with what was necessary. I took up my sojourn with Greaves who had been English Consul in company with Parkin for many years, 'till a short time before my arrival there. A young man whose name was Curry by some influential friends in England had been appointed Consul. This created a hardness between them. My having been there several weeks made acquaintance with the principal residents.\n\nOne day a ship was coming into the bay which proved to be a Frigate which attracted the attention of all who assembled near the landing. Parkin came to me before the boat had landed, and desired me to inform Curry of his (Parkin's) appointment to supersede him as Consul for the Islands, he wished him to know it before the boat landed. I informed him I did not like to be the bearer of ill tidings. neither did I wish to see anything unpleasant between them. I then asked Parkin if he had received his credentials, he informed me he had, I then desired him to show them to me, he handed them to me, I read them, by that time the boat was nearby. I walked up to Curry, took him by the arm, saying to him I was sorry to be the bearer of ill tidings, but must inform him of his being superseded as consul by Parkin. He was much confused and excited, saying at the same time \"do you know it for a certainty.\" I answered to him I did for I had seen his appointment. Curry consented to stand with me and not interfere.\n\nParkin had told me if he Curry attempted to interfere with the officers of the Frigate, he would throw him into the water. I felt much gratified to be able to prevent a quarrel on the landing. I remained a month or more at Fayal, had an opportunity of seeing and knowing all the local news and what was passing, but at Islands they are dependent for all their news by shipping, all Islanders are hungry for news. Several ships of war called and some English privateers.\n\nI had been at Fayal a month or more when the Brig Joanna arrived from Madeira bound to Terceira to load fruit for New York. Having wine and citron sufficient for ballast. I joined the Brig (nominally) as Master, to go to Terceira where we had to wait four or five weeks to have our fruit packed, two thousand boxes of or-\n\nCAPTAIN EDMUND GARDNER, HIS JOURNAL. 15\n\nanges and lemons. In the orchard where our fruit was packed was a sage tree, which was quite new to me. I think 'twas ten feet in height or more branched out proportionately. I asked permission to take some of it, which was granted by the owner of the premises, and from this tree got all we wanted for our passage to New York. The diameter of the trunk was from five to six inches, 'twas continually growing and in bloom, there being no frost to check its growth.\n\nWhen I left the Island cabbages were beginning to head, the date of leaving was 27th of 1st Mo 1808. The owner of the Brig Joanna was William S. Shaw, the former Captain was with him. Shaw had purchased the Brig intending to act as Master himself, but finding me at Fayal desired me to have the vessel put under my charge (nominally). The Captain was an Englishman and could not hold the papers of an American Vessel. My Mate and second Mate and five men joined the Brig as a part of the company. Left Terceira at above date, had a fine run up to the Banks in five days, then took the wind from the westward was twenty-four days to New York, where we arrived on the 10 of the 3 Mo 1808. I took lodgings for a few days at Paul Delano's. I then with my officers and men took passage to New Bedford in Ship Aldebaran which had recently arrived, the long Embargo was on, and no business for ships. We left New York for New Bedford, where we arrived in sixteen hours, a stranger to all persons in the place. Took lodgings at Gerrishes, a tavern near the Commercial Wharf, that now is.\n\nI remained in this place five days, in which time made several acquaintances, amongst them was David Coffin, then in command of the Ship Maria, subsequently I engaged to sail with him in the Maria as his first officer for the Pacific Ocean on a Whaling Voyage, the ship was then twenty-six years old, and is the oldest ship belonging to the U.S. at the time I am writing, eighty years old, and now performing a Voyage to the Pacific.\n\nWas absent on the voyage twenty-one months had taken a full cargo of sperm oil 1200 Barrels. The late Samuel Rodman was owner of the Maria, had been owned in the family from the time she was launched. The above vessel was set up for a privateer in the Revolutionary War but finished after peace by William Rotch, Sr., and fitted for a Whaler.\n\nI had come to the conclusion on my passage home to go no more Whaling unless I could have the command. I named to my Captain if I could not have the command I would go no more Whaling, thinking I could do some other business. The owner of the Maria was desirous of my going in that Ship, would increase my pay, but\n\n16 CAPTAIN EDMUND GARDNER, HIS JOURNAL.\n\nmy Captain having learned my views on our way home, felt a delicacy in calling on me to fill the same office. I had stated to my Captain on the homeward passage that I would go as soon with him as anyone were I going in the capacity of first officer, but would not go with him if they would give me the same share he had himself. I had endeavored to serve him faithfully, and I now wished to carry out my own views and whims.\n\nI had come to the conclusion to wait \"the movement of the waters.\" Some short time after my arrival home the Ship Winslow arrived, the commander did not wish to go again, Samuel Rodman tendered me the Command of that ship. I agreed to go for him and sailed on the 4th of 8 Mo 1810 for the Pacific Ocean, had a long passage out, when near the Western Islands took one sperm Whale making 2100 Gallons oil, proceeded to Cape Verde Islands and from thence shipped the same to New Bedford.\n\nPursued my way to the Pacific and arrived on the coast of Chile after a passage of 140 days. I went into the Island of St. Mary's for a few days, having been buffeted with hard weather passing Cape Horn. As we drew to the North had weather more mild, got into the harbor in safety where I found Ship Lady Adams of Nantucket, Elisha Folger Master, who sailed some weeks after me, had a shorter passage than myself. While at this place, traveled much about the Island. On a point of land that was sandy found many eggs larger than the common fowl eggs. The birds having just begun laying, found one and two in a nest. They were all fresh and new, obtained near two barrels. Being on shore one day, saw my ship's company all concentrating themselves, I went to see what attracted them, found they had made the discovery of many plots of strawberries, the ground was quite red with them, and finer I never saw, my sailors had plenty for picking, which was a great indulgence for them. After laying several days, took on board some water, left in company with the above mentioned Ship for the coast of Peru, had favorable winds for several days 'till we were in twenty degrees of south Latitude when discovering sperm whales went in pursuit of them, took two, one to each ship. When I left the Island of St. Mary's in company with Lady Adams 'twas mutually agreed between Folger and myself to keep together so long as both parties were agreed. Having begun our whaling continued with good success, in three months from leaving Chile arrived at the Galapagos Islands, had taken 800 Barrels of Sperm oil to each ship. I was five months out, with no oil on board, when ten months had a thousand barrels. When one year from home had 1100 barrels, had been to\n\nCAPTAIN EDMUND GARDNER, HIS JOURNAL. 17\n\nno inhabited land. I then went to Paita for recruits of vegetables, fruit and other anti-scorbutics. After refitting our ship, went to Tumbes for wood and water, no water is to be had at Paita nearer than nine miles, the expense would be about one dollar a barrel, at Tumbes 'twas obtained without expense. After procuring all we wanted, left to complete our Cargo. In four months and a half took 450 Barrels and arrived home.\n\nOn 28 of 9 Mo 1811 The Ship Lady Adams had a full cargo, and left me wanting two hundred barrels, had rugged weather for some days, took two whales, boiled out the oil, saw nothing for several days, then took three. That was all we wanted. I told my Mate we must get three to make fifty barrels, got three, took them to the ship and when boiled out, had more than a hundred. On the 24th of 10 Mo 1811 spread our sails to the breeze and in ninety-seven days was safely anchored in Newport, R. I. harbor, having been absent less than eighteen months, and obtained 1400 Barrels sperm oil, Officers and ship's company numbered sixteen. Arrived five months before war was declared by the U.S. in 1812. I had heard nothing from home later than one month after I sailed, therefore was very anxious to learn the political state of our Country. When I arrived up to Cape Horn and directed my course to the Eastward met an English ship from London. The weather was moderate, I had a boat lowered and went on board the Ship, when I got on board (after the Captain had given me his hand) my feeling very anxious I said to him, \"Is there any war?\" His reply was astounding to me, \"Walk into my cabin and I will tell you sir,\" I walked in feeling I was captured, he soon informed me there was no war when he sailed, \"but I would have you. take care, for I have been five years in a French prison.\" I made a short tarry the weather looked threatening. I got to my ship and by the time my boat was up, the wind came on furiously from the W.S.W. Having reduced our sails, sailed rapidly on our way. Had a favorable passage, although we came mid-winter, 'twas a very severe winter but had a fine time in. I could get no pilot, took a fisherman from his boat, he knew where dangers lay, and that was all I wanted of him. I got safely at anchor at 6 o'clock p. m. 29th of 1st Mo 1812. The next morning I wrote Samuel Rodman informing him of my arrival. He that morning heard from a letter from David Coffin of my being in the Pacific with a 1000 Barrels and just twelve hours later received mine announcing my arrival, 'twas the first and last account from me.\n\nThe winter had been very severe, and much shipwreck. The sloop of War Nautilus arrived at Newport with loss of foremast and bow-\n\n18 CAPTAIN EDMUND GARDNER, HIS JOURNAL.\n\nsprit. By what I learned from the Naval officers, I was strongly in the belief we should have war with England unless we retraced our steps, for the stand our Government had taken, it would be difficult to avoid a war. Having been absent one year and a half, heard nothing from home for nearly all that time, was not prepared to judge anything myself relative to the proceedings of our Government, having been in an excluded part of the Globe for news. Five months after my arrival war was declared by our Government against Great Britain, much to the annoyance of seafaring men, 'twas like taking the farmer's farm, for the sailors' occupation was gone.\n\nDuring three and a half years I remained at my native place, could do little. Our coast and harbors were blockaded, and we, at Nantucket, lay at the mercy of our friends and enemies. There being no military preparation, not a soldier or a gun on the Island. There were forty-six Whaling ships belonging to the Island, twenty-three were captured, those that escaped capture made fine Voyages, some were captured in sight of the Island. I lived in a very humble way, farming some, but found my means for living gradually being less, therefor came to the conclusion to leave the Island as soon as spring opened. 'Twas now the early part of 1815. Before the ice left our harbor and shores, a boat landed on the west end of the Island, bringing the news that Peace was concluded at Ghent, which was a cheering sound for Nantucket, as well as for the whole Country.\n\nMy ship (the Winslow) had been repaired during the war and laid up. Consequently was quite in a state of forwardness when peace was ratified. I sailed in the 7th Mo 1815 having the officers who had been with me previous to the war, all in the same capacity. We proceeded on three days with brisk breeze when to my surprise found the foremast badly sprung, in consequence of its decayed state. I immediately hove the ship to and commenced fishing the mast. In two hours had secured it in such a manner as to be warrantable to proceed to Brazil.\n\nDirected my course for the Island of St. Catherine's where we arrived in safety. Immediately stripped the mast, fixed our purchase for taking out the mast, after getting it out and on deck, found 'twas worthless, more than one-half entirely decayed, could pick it to pieces with my fingers. I then had it sawed and cut up for wood. It was several days before I was certain of getting a suitable spar to make another. Having agreed with a Government officer to cut the stick and bring the same to the beach\n\nCAPTAIN EDMUND GARDNER, HIS JOURNAL. 19\n\nfor a stipulated sum. But they made slow progress in consequence of unfavorable weather and from the many holidays. I had made an arrangement with a Brazilian carpenter to make the mast, he having the dimensions for so doing.\n\nIn the morning after a very rainy day I went to the shore to the officer's house, found him at home with his uniform on, seeing him quite at ease, I accosted him in somewhat decided manner why they were not getting my mast down. The officer (Sabin for that was his name) spoke a little English, I could speak a little Portuguese, both of us being somewhat excited made little progress in understanding each other. He insisting on. \"the mast in the beach\" which I did not believe, thinking there must be some mistake. Two days before there was much distance for it to come, and it had rained all the time 'till that morning. I then told Sabin I would go and see the mast, 'twas some little distance from his house. When I got where it was, (and now a fair morning) I said to Sabin, where is the Carpenter, his reply was \"Carpener no make\" Sabin knowing little English and my knowing less Portuguese, we could not fully understand each other. I sent the officer who was with me to the ship with a message to the first officer to bring all the tools that would make a chip, all the saws, and grindstone. Leaving on shipboard one officer, cook and steward, bringing all others on shore.\n\nI now assumed the command as master Carpenter, lined out the spar and every man at work on it. Soon after commencing the Carpenter came to know why I had discharged him. Then came the truth of the story. The officer Sabin and Carpenter had disagreed. I then told the Carpenter if he wished to be employed to come on, I would give him day wages, I was now boss myself. He came on, all my ship's company was doing something for in fifteen hours' labor 'twas a mast, finished and lowered into the step. During the time my mate was rigging and fitting the ship for sea, I was preparing all necessary stores for the Voyage.\n\nWhen I sailed from the U. States, all West India produce was at a high price. I purchased all we needed for the Voyage for less than half the cost in the States when I sailed. When the ship was ready I had all things in forwardness. Two days were used in procuring vegetables, fruit and other necessaries. I had been detained thirty-five days in this place. I sailed and had favorable winds and weather up to Staten Island, after leaving this land had continued westerly gales, could show little sail, most of the time under closed reefs and staysails. In seventeen days gained the length of the Island (thirty miles) then stood wide to the\n\n20 CAPTAIN EDMUND GARDNER, HIS JOURNAL.\n\nsouth, the wind coming to the S. West, tacked ship and went clown by the Tierra del Fuego and Chilean coasts. I saw several ships on the Chilean coast intending to cruise there. But 'twas my intention to proceed to Coast of Peru, where we soon arrived, being now on far famed Pacific. Had taken more than two hundred barrels of sperm oil in about two months after leaving St. Catherine's, was doing finely. On 21st of 2 Mo 1816, it was a beautiful day, with smooth sea when we saw many whales, went in pursuit of them, my boatsteerers had missed throwing their harpoons five times, when they ought not to have missed. I went into the head of my boat, rowed to my Mate telling him to go into the head of his, then went after others that had not been disturbed, 'twas still weather, were paddling after them, when I got near to one lay down my paddle, took harpoon in hand threw into the whale, took my other harpoon in hand, but have no recollection of what I did with it. I recollect of seeing the Whale's teeth but further I know nothing, 'till getting up from the bottom of the boat. Found I was much hurt and wounded, when I came to my senses after being stunned, called one of the boat's company to cut off the line and take me to the ship. I was bleeding copiously when taken on board, my shoes were quite full of blood. When on board, found one tooth had entered my head breaking in my skull, another had pierced my hand, another had entered the upper part of my right arm, the fourth had entered my right shoulder, from the shoulder to the elbow of the right arm was badly fractured, My shoulder was broken down an inch or more (where it now is), my jaw and five teeth were broken, tongue cut through, my left hand was pierced with a tooth and much broken and very painful. 'Twas favorable I retained my senses, my hand was very painful, many of the bones were broken in the hand.\n\nThe ship's course was directed for Paita when the land was sighted, 'twas thought to be Paita head, but the anxiety of my officers prevented their getting the Latitude, bad they done so, they would have discovered their error. After getting the ship at anchor, they could not tell where they were. I had them put clothes around me and get me on deck. When I had looked around, saw where we were, I was taken down again. We were in Sechura Bay, the headland looking much like the headland of Paita. I took a scale and projected the courses and distances from where we then were to the port of Paita, the distances on each of the several courses. I directed them to be particular and make the exact distances on each course.\n\nCAPTAIN EDMUND GARDNER, HIS JOURNAL. 21\n\nOn the following morning found ourselves on the fairway into the harbor of Paita and soon into anchor. Found there the ship Maria, Micajah Swain, Master, that ship belonging to my owner, he lay still in port 'till I had left for Piura. When Capt. Swain came on board my ship to see me, it was the first time I had any weakness relative to my situation, seeing him in health and me lying on the cabin floor prostrated, it made me feel my weakness. I said to Capt. Swain I was quite unmanned as I could not refrain from tears, so weak was I and unable to help myself. On my first being wounded, my head being so much bruised, I was apprehensive should I fall asleep 'twas doubtful if I awoke again. I therefore cautioned my officers not to let me sleep. After a few hours had elapsed my caution was useless for my extreme suffering prevented all possibility of sleeping.\n\nMy second officer was an ingenious man. I directed him to make splints for my arm and how they should be made. My first officer prepared bandages. When all things were in readiness had some of the sailors called down to aid in setting the arm. My second officer extended the arm. I encouraged him by telling him not to be afraid to pull, that all the bones might come into their proper places. I then told my first officer to press the bones into their places. He did so and I have as straight an arm as any man. 'Twas six days from the time I was hurt to arriving at Paita, which is four hundred miles and fifty North of Lima. From the loss of blood I was very weak, they had to fan me forty-eight hours continually. I often fainted quite away. Since, I have had a fan put into all medicine chests where I have had the direction.\n\nSoon after anchoring had the Doctor from a Spanish King's Ship. He examined my wounds as I lay on my cabin floor. I talked with him through a linguist. He pronounced my wounds bad, my left hand must be cut off, my head was bad, (did not propose cutting that off) but recommended my having the Chaplain to come and confess me. He evidently thought there was little chance of my recovery. When I learned from the linguist what was the Doctor's advice, I directed my Mate to go ashore and request the Commandant to write to Piura to an old Doctor residing there, to send it express, and let nothing prevent his coming to me. I had made up my mind to have nothing done by the first Doctor.\n\nIt was somewhat remarkable my having knowledge of the old Doctor at Piura. When I was mate of ship, I made the acquaintance of Christopher Almy, Mate of Ship Danube of this place. After I saw\n\n22 CAPTAIN EDMUND GARDNER, HIS JOURNAL.\n\nhim he had his leg broken by a Whale, was carried to Paita and put under the care of the old Doctor. The ship went off and left him quite destitute.\n\nOn a subsequent Voyage I went into Paita, while there, I wrote Almy I was there, if he was in want of anything, I could supply him as far forth as in me lay. He answered my letter saying \"the Doctor my father as I call him (he was Christened Christopher Almy Ortiz taking the Doctor's name) has gone into the country and my situation will not admit of my giving six dollars for a horse, or I would come and see you\" then saying \"if you have some camphor and rum to dissolve the same, would like to have it to bathe my wounds, to be left with my friend at Paita.\"\n\nThis was hi the 8th Mo. 1811 I accomplished my Voyage returning home 1st Mo 1812. On my arrival I found a friend of AImy's from the Country, sent the letter I had from the son, with my endorsement to his parents.\n\nAfter thirty-six hours the Doctor from Piura came onboard my ship to see me. After asking me some questions relative to my bowels being open, said I must be taken ashore. My mate had procured a house, but when the Doctor saw it, he objected saying he wanted me near his lodgings. He had a niece living in the town, she gave up her best room to me. I had someone from the ship to stay with me. I remained ashore, the Doctor attending me. I told him if he thought it best to take my hand off, \"to off with it,\" for I had full confidence in him.\n\nHe was sixty-nine years old, educated in Spain and had much practice since. He insisted at all times he could save the hand, and he did. He remained with me six days, when I made preparation for my journey, had my cot suspended between two mules, one before me, the other behind, my cot swinging between them, 'twas a very easy way of traveling. The Doctor attended me on the way, with a hundred mules in the caravan, had an awning over my cot, the sun being powerfully hot at the time of starting at 3 P.M. (the most traveling being done in the night, it being so much better for the beasts). The distance was a little short of fifty miles, and in that distance there was not one green spot to be seen. There were some trees two feet in diameter which were dead. There had been no rain for twelve years. The sand had blown into all the romantic forms of snowbanks. We traveled 'till nine o'clock, when halted gave provender to the mules, rested for two or three hours, when we again started, arriving in early morning. 'Twas just coming light as we approached the town, something looked strange of a light appearance when first I saw it, could not devise what it could be, but on a nearer view, found\n\nCAPTAIN EDMUND GARDNER, HIS JOURNAL. 23\n\n'twas females beating the seeds from cotton. During the day 'tis too warm to do much, the cotton was laid on the sand and the seeds beaten out with two sticks. 'Twas said each morning more than a thousand were thus employed. The heat of the day was intense, many days in the early part of my being there, my thermometer ranged at 110Â° in the shade in my window where the sun never came.\n\nBefore leaving Paita a number of ships and vessels came into port in the evening, causing great consternation to the inhabitants, the Country was in a revolutionary state, the vessels were supposed to be enemies, and such a scene I had never witnessed, that of children crying, mothers running with one child in arms, leading another or two, the barking of dogs, squealing of pigs, with all the din of the inhabitants of a town expecting to be sacked. I was at my house, could not move if the town was fired into. I therefor waited the event. Soon persons began to enter my house with trunks of valuables, desiring me to claim them as my own. About ten o'clock 'twas ascertained the ships that had arrived were commanded by friendly persons, 'twas a confused time all night. Next day I told the Governor had one hour longer elapsed before learning whose ships they were, I should have been Governor.\n\nThere was such a scene as I had never witnessed before. On a subsequent voyage was in this same port of Paita, when Lord Cochrain arrived with several ships and vessels for the purpose of plundering the place. There were six Whaling Ships in port, three American and three English. Cochrain's fleet came in the morning. After anchoring, their ships put springs on their cables, bringing their guns to bear on the town, commenced firing into the town, my ship lay in an exposed situation between the castle and the war ships. I commenced to get my ship underway, one of the English ships was underway when a shot was fired from the commodore s ship bringing him to. I then thought 'twould be useless for me to attempt leaving and dropped my anchor. 'Twas not a comfortable situation to be between two fires or cannonading. In a short time after landing their men, the flag was hauled down at the Castle, when the men headed by their officers entered the town for plunder. I was told his Lordship was at the head of the plundering expedition. We all lay still 'till the following morning, finding 'twas useless laying there longer got my ship underway, with a determination of going to sea if not stopped by the plunderers. I took up my anchors, set little sail 'till passed the flagship, then spread my sails and went out. All the captains of the other five Whalers remained onboard his Lordship's flagship, when near noon this plunderer came on deck, when they all had liberty to withdraw without much satisfaction. I jeered those\n\n24 CAPTAIN EDMUND GARDNER, HIS JOURNAL.\n\nCaptains afterwards for their attendance on his Lordship. I had not an exalted opinion of Aristocracy for in this case 'twas the strong triumphing over the weak. There were some small things for so high sounding a name as His Lordship, for while he was on shore sending on board his ship his ill-gotten plunder, I was on board of his ship and saw what came, among which was a female's wardrobe, which I recognized, the owner of which had done much for me in my wounded state. I could but feel sorry for her. She had come into town from Piura to remove her household affairs to that place, finding me there stopped one day to take some things I had for the Doctor's family, in doing which she lost all her clothing and many other useful articles of household affairs, stolen by Lord Cochrain. The bandits with him were mostly English but all had assumed the name of Patriots.1\n\nAt a later period of the Voyage in attempting to enter the port of Callao was prevented doing so by the fleet of Cochrain. Foster was in command of the blockading squadron. I boarded the Independantia, Foster's flagship, found he had his wife onboard, she was the sister of Cochrain. After communicating with the American Frigate Macedonian, found I could get nothing from the shore, Captain Downs informed me 'twas useless to try, he would have aided me had there been any prospect of obtaining what I wanted, vegetables, fruit and water. I then went to Tumbes where I obtained all and everything I wanted at a fair reasonable rate, much to the refreshment of self and ship's company.\n\nAfter my little digression I resume my narrative. On arriving at the town of Piura just as the sun was rising, many persons had assembled to see the stranger and wounded man, the street was one dense column. The Doctor had sent to his daughter to prepare a place near his own residence, which she had, directly in front of his office. I had two rooms in front, one for sitting room, the other lodging. I had many things sent me by citizens in the way of fruit and flowers. It was some days before I was sufficiently rested to be able to walk around the town. When I had gained some strength went to all parts of the town, found it much shaken from earthquakes that occurred a year and a half before my being there. Many of the houses and all the churches (nine in number) were badly broken. One was less injured than the others, in consequence of the Padre (or Priest) never ceasing to ring the bell, such was their belief (at least they said so). 'Twas seldom I was without fruit of some kind. The little children would come with a particular flower with a stick stuck through them with another transversely forming a cross. They were fragrant so that my home was always perfumed by flowers. Two little boys\n\nCAPTAIN EDMUND GARDNER, HIS JOURNAL. 25\n\ncame often to see me. I was much pleased to have them come and I always gave them fruit or something to induce them to come again, if without, gave them sugar. If they were missing, their mother knew where to find them. The early part of my being there 'twas very warm but it gradually grew cooler, so dry was it, that there was no moisture in the earth, but the air was very pure, hence the name of the town Piura.\n\nThe streets were narrow, making it always shady. For the first month or more, I never saw the thermometer lower than 84Â°. Few persons were seen in the streets after ten o'clock in the morning 'till after four in the afternoon, at which time the breeze would draw up the valley of the river from Sechura Bay which brings up the sea breeze, which was quite invigorating. I usually went to the River before the sun had risen over the Cordilleras when 'twas comfortably cool. Sometimes prolonging my walk, I was out later than 'twas my intention and found the sand so heated by the sun as to make it uncomfortable for my feet and often sought the shade.\n\nI had been at Piura nearly six weeks before I heard an English word spoken (except in my own family). One morning going to the River, I met a man in a singular costume for that Country. His appearance induced me to salute him by bidding him good morning. He responded readily by replying \"good morning sir.\" 'Twas quite a treat to me to hear my native language spoken. I made inquiry where he had learned the English language, and he informed me he had been in England, a prisoner five years. His profession was that of a Comedian. He was to perform the coming evening and gave me an invitation to be present, for which I thanked him but should not be able to attend on account of my health. And another important point 'twould have been trying to the Doctor for me to have attended any such exhibition for I believe him to have been a truly Religious man.\n\nI had been at Piura some six weeks, which was the time the Doctor had thought 'twould take for the bone of my right arm to knit strong enough to set the shoulder. I had up to that time had both arms in slings around my neck, being entirely helpless and had my food put into my mouth. The Doctor decided that my arm was well set and had done nothing for it, but apply different splints. I had gained slowly but steadily, my strength was somewhat improved. I found I could get my hand to my head to feed myself and could write, not supposing I should ever be able to do much more, told the Doctor my shoulder had partially knitted, would now have to be broken up, I came to the conclusion to have no more breaking, and so informed the Doctor. My head was quite healed up, my jaw was much better,\n\n26 CAPTAIN EDMUND GARDNER, HIS JOURNAL.\n\nmy hand was still painful. One of the bones that was broken, one end of the same rose up, the other end being confined held it stationary and made it very painful. I called the attention of the Doctor, telling him he must cut it out. He declined at first, but after several sleepless nights, I importuned him more urgently, when he cut some in the morning, and at night some more. The following morning he took the bone out, from which time I was free from pain. The suppuration of my hand had, unperceived by me, run nearly all the flesh from my arm. On attempting to lean my elbow on the table, I perceived it hurt me. On examining my arm, I found there was little beside skin and bone left, and it is still smaller than the other.\n\nAfter being in Piura a month, I was at a resort near the Hospital, where many assembled in the afternoon to meet the refreshing breeze drawing up the river. A caravan that had just arrived from Paita were going to water their beasts, one of the men called to me \"Capitan to Fragata es en Paita.\" Not regarding him, he repeated his call. I then called him to me, asking him how he knew my ship was at Faith. (Had of necessity to speak Spanish, no other language being spoken.) The muleteer informed me my ship was in Paita, had taken five whales, had lost one big one. I then asked him how he knew all this. He informed me \"Mudo oblace tutear.\" My mate had enjoined it on all the ship's company not to inform me what they had done. I had one man who was a mute, the mate never thought to caution him. 'Twas from him the Spaniard was informed. I was fifty miles in the Country, learned through a deaf and dumb man my ship was in Port, had been successful. I had directed my Mate to return to port after one month, by that time 'twould be decided whether I should recover, in case I did not 'twould be necessary to take the boy whom I carried with me.\n\nThree days before the ship arrived directed a letter to my first officer at Paita, directing him not to bring the ship to anchor but go off for two months more. After the bone was taken from my hand, it improved rapidly. Before the two months had passed, I was much better and concluded to go down to Paita. I joined a caravan, started in the afternoon and arrived the following morning and had been three days there when the ship came in. I found the Spaniards of South America the most benevolent people I had been acquainted with, many of them tendered to me all the assistance 'twas in their power. Many of the females picked and prepared lint for dressing my wounds. Many little delicacies of fruit and flowers were sent me. During my stay in the Country, I witnessed the entire change of the water in the river, from being quite a stream diminished that much of the bed of the river\n\nCAPTAIN EDMUND GARDNER, HIS JOURNAL. 27\n\nwas dry for many weeks. I often traveled miles on the bed of the river, 'twas hard smooth sand. I crossed the river to a Village on the other side. While there I saw a whirlwind coming towards me, 'twas not large when first I saw it but increased in size and strength 'till I was alarmed. Its course was direct for me, taking up everything in its way. In my weak state, I felt 'twould be impossible for me to stand up. I got to a small tree, set myself down on the ground with my arm around the tree, holding my hat with the other hand. I think I should have suffered had it reached me, for large limbs of trees were in its vortex, which had been twisted and broken from the dry trunk of the lifeless trees, when it passed me 'twas two hundred feet in diameter or more and five or six hundred feet in height, making an awful appearance and rush of wind. It passed not more than two hundred feet from me, and I was thankful for the escape. After being in Piura five or six weeks, it rained in the Mountains when water came down the river in the afternoon, by the next morning 'twas three feet deep. When the sound came that the river was coming, some four thousand of the citizens went up to meet it, making it a holy day which was the eighth in succession. The following day floating craft came down with the current.\n\nI had been more than two months in the Country and my health and strength had improved. The place I was at contained nine thousand inhabitants, with nine Churches, many of them much injured as were many of the dwellings by earthquakes. The Doctor informed me the River had never been dry until after those shocks, which cleft the bed of the River, when the water settled immediately down, and had occasionally been dry since. When the water came from the mountains, the citizens repaired to the River to bathe, so cold was the water, their teeth would rattle with cold, but 'twas esteemed beneficial to health.\n\nThere was no other order of Christians but Catholics, many of them very zealous and Church-going people. The Doctor attended Church daily at two o'clock in the morning, was very devout and I believed him a good man. The principal spiritual adviser came often to see me and was desirous of my embracing the Catholic belief. He came not long before I left to pour his benediction on me and to enjoin it strictly on me never to go after another whale. He said to me if he could talk my language he could convince me of my error and could not bear for me to leave them in my heretical state. The Padre Gupualyan (for that was what he was called) I believed to be sincere in his zeal and regard he had for me.\n\nIt caused much pain to lift my hands above my head, therefor\n\n28 CAPTAIN EDMUND GARDNER, HIS JOURNAL.\n\nhad my clothes fitted with strings to put them around me and tie. My outside covering was a sheet with a place open in the middle to put my head through, it then hung loosely around me making a Poncho not unlike those worn by the South Americans. Some of their Ponchos were expensive and beautiful. Having previously made arrangement to join a Caravan, started in the afternoon (I rode a mule), on a very warm and clear sunny day. I had a thin coat, turned down my cuffs, but such was, the power of the sun that my hands were blistered. I had been unable to wear much clothing 'till a short time before leaving. The first time was what they called Easter, 'twas in the third month. For three days they were dressed in cast-off clothing, slouched hats and shoes, at the expiration of that time (in commemoration of our Saviour laying in the tomb) on the third day Judas was stretched across one of the principal streets in effigy, stuffed with combustibles. When the explosion took place, it caused exceeding joy and merriment. On the following morning, everyone came out in their best attire and all were jubilant. I, among the rest, dressed myself for the occasion in my best, which was pleasing to the citizens. I had made the acquaintance of a Gentleman and be came to my house to walk with me. He seemed acquainted with everyone and introduced me to many of the townspeople, which made it more pleasant for me afterwards. The son of a Governor of an interior province had recently been married and came to Piura to make their bridal tour. I was introduced to them at the house where they were stopping. The sister of the bride desired to know of my friend if I spoke Spanish. He answered in the negative, and then the inquiry was made if I comprehended their conversation, and they were told no. The company soon began to make some comment on me. After a time I made answer to one of their remarks, when the shout was deafening from all the company. The females bore down hard on my friend for his deception. Whenever I met any of the company afterwards, they were sure to mention the affair.\n\nI had improved much and was desirous of getting on board my Ship. I had been at Paita three days when my ship came in. It had taken fifty barrels of oil in the last cruise. After a few days, I got all things that were necessary and left, went to the Galapagos Islands. After making some little stay at those Islands, I directed my course for mainland. When near and in the vicinity of Isle of Plate, saw many whales and took two hundred barrels in a short time. My water being nearly expended, I directed my course for Tumbes, where we replenished all our stores that were then needed.\n\nCAPTAIN EDMUND GARDNER, HIS JOURNAL. 29\n\nOn leaving went up near the Lobos Islands and found the fishing ground very cheering, took nearly all we wanted to complete the cargo, then directed my course for Paita to procure fresh supplies and to fit the ship for passing the Cape and making our passage home. I found myself much debilitated, and the idea of passing Cape Horn bore with weight on my mind. As we approached the southern clime, my strength improved and the fears of bad weather off the Cape were quite dispelled. Our course was rapid towards home, had a pleasant passage, more so than any before, was a few days more than three months from Paita to New Bedford, where we arrived in safety, having been absent twenty-three months and procured a full cargo of sperm oil, 1450 barrels, and returned my whole ship's company in health. On the early part of the voyage, for some misdemeanor, had to punish one of my men, from which time he behaved himself like a man. Soon after my arrival, I met the above named man. He then asked me to give him a recommendation, saying \"I hope you will say nothing of what took place on the voyage for you served me just right.\" He was decidedly one of the best men I had with me. I told him the day previous to punishing him (for some offense) for the next offense I would punish him. His reply was \"we are not to be punished on board of this ship.\" The next day he tried it and on the same day I punished him. Having all hands called, I then addressed him by telling him the laws of his Country were open for him if I had not done him justice, he could have it on his return, having all his shipmates for evidence in the case. I believe he ever considered me his friend as he often came to see me. Thus ended my last voyage in Ship Winslow in 6 Mo 1817.\n\nHaving made some remarks of going to the Galapagos Islands, which are celebrated for some things, there's a peculiar kind of turtle which live on the land. They are called terrapin. They are really land turtle and they don't go near water unless 'tis to drink. In the rainy season, they take water into a reservoir nature has prepared for them, to be sufficient for six months. They are a singular animal, they masticate nothing, bite and swallow in the form 'tis bitten off. They are fitted for their situation and condition. They drink through the nose, and when a little fresh water has been caught in the cavity of a rock, they set their nose on the end and draw all the water from the rock. The reservoir or bags that contain their water in the dry season becomes fat, not unlike the leaf of the hog, but different from it in another respect. The fat which is yellow and sweet as new butter will not shorten pastry any more than salt water. I have often tried it\n\n30 CAPTAIN EDMUND GARDNER, HIS JOURNAL.\n\nwithout any favorable result. There's one thing more I consider remarkable, that their blood should be cold. When first I visited those Islands (some short time before going there) I made inquiry whether their blood was hot or cold, but no one could inform me. I noted it down. A few days we spoke with a ship from those Islands and they gave us a few terrapin. When the cook dressed them, I stood by and found 'twas different from my expectation. The blood was cold and was uniform with the temperature. When the temperature is cool, then their blood vibrates more sluggishly. In one case, I had one put down below when passing Cape Horn. On some occasion had to go down where the terrapin was and they found him dead and they asked should it be thrown overboard. The word got to me and I said no and ordered him taken into the cabin where there was a fire. His feet were stretched out, his neck its full length from the shell and his eyes closed. After remaining before the fire more than an hour, the first appearance of life was his opening his eyes and after some little time had elapsed drew up one foot, then the other, and before the day had passed, he was traveling around the cabin. He probably would never have moved again had he not been warmed or thawed out. As we drew up into cool weather, the blood thickened and ceased to vibrate. When we arrived into a more genial clime, he became active as is usual for them to be. They go slowly but determinedly and never cease trying to go where they want to. I had one that tried three days to get upon the water, but when it would get part of the way up, the lurch of the ship would make it slide down to the lee side of the deck, then it would turn and walk up and go through the same effort as before. It would lie still through the night and commence again in the morning. On the third day, he succeeded, which seemed to satisfy him. After looking around, he was taken down, but he never wanted or tried to get up again. The time they will endure without victuals or drink is astonishing. I had one on ship board more than a year without having anything, unless he drank water when it rained. They become very poor in flesh after six months and the meat loses its sweetness. The account I have thus noted would seem fabulous were there not many living witnesses who would corroborate this my statement.\n\nI was born and educated a friend or Quaker, consequently opposed to war from my youth up, in all its parts for many years, and still am in the way it's been carried on since 1861 between brethren, to the distress and suffering of thousands and still likely to continue.\n\nI do think we might learn wisdom from the poor terrapin. They\n\nCAPTAIN EDMUND GARDNER, HIS JOURNAL. 31\n\nfight, as does every specie of animals, and worse than animals the human race that's endowed with rational faculties, and Christian professors, seeking to destroy each other in deadly combat. There's one kind of fighting I must advocate, which we may learn from the terrapin, which is the only good way of fighting I have yet known. They meet for battle with beginning to raise their heads, each raising his head, stretching up his neck, standing on one forefoot to enable him to get his head a little higher. Whichever gets his head the highest is conqueror, the vanquished lowers his head, turns off, and neither of them touches the other. Thus ends the battle, which is the only good way of fighting. Some of them are large and strong. I attempted at one time to drive a large one to my boat. He went moderately for a quarter of a mile, when be did not choose to go any further. I then sat down on him, my friend who was with me did also, and after a time he started with both of us sitting on him. Our united weight was not less than three hundred pounds. Such as this was too heavy to carry to the boat. I have known them to have been killed weighing hundred pounds to the quarter. They are excellent food and have never known a person to die from being fed on the meat of terrapin. Their eggs before the shell has been formed, often taken from them when dressed, and put into an oven pan, when full two-thirds of the bulk of the eggs would be fat. No lard could be finer for frying fish, and I have heard of its being salted and being used in preference to rancid butter for bread.\n\nThe cotton plant or tree grows spontaneously on those Islands, doubtless might be cultivated and made productive. The leaves make very good tea and have known a ship's company to be fully restored from the scurvy by drinking the tea made from the leaves of the plant. So much attached were they to it, they preferred it to new tea on its way from China. I have one thing more to say relative to the terrapin. Their natures are all alike at the different Islands, but they differ in their appearance at each Island. A person acquainted with those Islands would readily know from which Island terrapins were taken from. The liver of those from Charles Island is delicious, more so than others.\n\nHaving returned in an invalid state, few days passed without ill feelings caused by my weak state. It seemed doubtful to me if I should ever be able to do much more. I, however, came to the conclusion to try and do something for the support of my little family. I had three children, the eldest six years, the second four, the third and youngest near two. Soon after my return, they were all attacked with whooping cough. Two of them sunk under their malady, one recovered but had not gained his strength when the fever set in, which\n\n32 CAPTAIN EDMUND GARDNER, HIS JOURNAL.\n\nterminated his existence. We buried all three of them in less than three months, leaving our house desolate. 'Twas a severe dispensation but could do nothing ourselves but put our trust in divine Providence, where our whole support and strength lay.\n\nI commenced a school for young men to instruct them in mathematics and navigation and had a pleasant company of young men. There were twenty-five of them, subsequently all of them commanded ships but one, and he probably would have had he been strictly a temperate man. I also kept an evening school at my house for younger persons and in different branches. The emolument was small but had no other resource. I continued through the winter hoping something might appear favorable for me.\n\nAfter the spring opened, I received a letter from one of the owners of the Ship Winslow, which was the last ship I had sailed, tendering me the command of a ship that was being built in New Bedford. My health was slim, but after mature reflection I answered the letter received, accepting the command of said Ship. Through the summer, I made preparation to sail in the fall. I joined the ship some six weeks before sailing and had everything fitted and prepared to my entire satisfaction, and sailed 12th of 11 Mo. 1818. We had a rugged uncomfortable time off this coast, had been about two weeks out when we discovered the bowsprit badly sprung. I secured it and went on our way with a determination to go into Brazil to procure another. I arrived in fifty days at the Island of St. Catherine's, where I procured a suitable stick, bought the tree standing, cut the roots and felled the tree. By so doing, I got the whole length without any risk of its being shaken. When it was down ready for transporting, I had all my Ship's company to assist and we hauled it three miles by tackles. Part of the way we had one tackle on the back of another. We got it down, made and put in, and sailed in ten days.\n\nOn my arrival at St. Cruise had to go in my boat fourteen miles to the principal town by water, but landing on the north side of the peninsula called on the Captain of the Port and walked to the town, half a mile distance, saving three miles rowing. On my way over to the Office of the Chief Judge, I informed the Captain of the Port it was my desire to enter and clear my Ship at the same time, which would supersede the necessity of my having to come again to the town. The Captain informed me it could not be done. I queried with him why it could not be done. His answer was it never had been done. I then asked him if he would state to the Judge what I wanted in the same way I had stated it to him (the Capt. of the Port spoke English fluently and assured me he would make my statement in Portuguese to the Judge). On his doing so, the Judge's immedi-\n\nCAPTAIN EDMUND GARDNER, HIS JOURNAL. 33\n\nate reply was \"it cannot be done\" I wanted nothing but a stick for my bowsprint. I then informed him it was common occurrence in my Country, and after quite a demur, the Judge came to the conclusion to do all I wanted him to. When we had left the office, the Captain of the Port said \"this is the first vessel that ever entered and cleared at a Brazilian Port at the same time.\" The following day after my entry and clearance I commenced preparing the bowsprit. It was hard wood, called in that country oilier. It was something like the teak of the East Indies, hard crossgrained wood and heavy, would sink readily as a stone. I made all possible despatch and sailed for the Pacific. We had the usual westerly gales to contend with in passing Cape Horn. On arriving on the Coast of Chile and Peru, I had unfavorable accounts of the Ships that had been cruising in those localities. I proceeded down the coast, finding nothing encouraging, came to the decision of going into the North Pacific. Before leaving went into Paita to get some supplies. While there, Lord Cochrain came with a fleet of Patriotic Ships firing on the town and then plundering the same. Finding we could get nothing from the shore concluded to leave, his Lordship prevented our landing after he had taken possession of the place. I then steered off towards the Galapagos Islands and before getting there took one hundred and fifty barrels of sperm oil. After leaving these Islands directed my course for the Coast of California in company with Ships Equator, Folger and Triton, Wood. We sailed to the North as far as San Francisco, found rugged weather and nothing prosperous. We steered down the coast and took some oil. The two ships in company concluded to go into anchor at Ceros Island. Having a lame knee, it was less care for me to remain out. I had one man complaining with scurvy and fearing I might have more had made up my mind to go to the Sandwich Islands. I had prepared my ship with all light sails when I met the Equator. I informed him of my intention. He thought it was too late to go off there and get in time on the West Coast of Mexico. I informed Folger what my determination was. So little did I expect him to accompany me that I wrote my letters for him to forward to the United States if an opportunity presented. He took my letters and then said \"if I conclude to go in company with you, I will stand on, if not, shall tack in for the land.\" I gave orders in the morning to put the ship on a W.S.W. course putting on all sail. In a short time after the morning, I discovered he was following. We made the best of our way to the Sandwich Islands where we arrived in six-\n\n34 CAPTAIN EDMUND GARDNER, HIS JOURNAL.\n\nteen days, had a pleasant passage to the Islands and arrived at Hawaii 19th 9 Mo 1819.\n\nI received a letter from G. D. Gillman of those Islands desiring me to give him a statement of my first visiting those Islands. I accordingly wrote him the following date:\n\nCAPTAIN EDMUND GARDNER, HIS JOURNAL. 35\n\nOn leaving Maui I discharged my Kanakas and these with the desertion of one man left me three 'short of my complement of the ship's company. I took two natives from Maui, one from Oahu and one from Onehow (Niihau). The names I gave them were Henry Harmony, George Germaine, John Jovel and Sam How. I finished recruiting at Niihau, where we took as many potatoes and yams as we needed. I bought twenty barrels of yams and the same quantity of potatoes of George Tamoree at Attowai. I took my order from\n\n36 CAPTAIN EDMUND GARDNER, HIS JOURNAL.\n\nhim to receive them from Niihau. My order was in the shape of a Kanaka which by the way was the only kind of an order that could have been delivered, for on arriving at the west side of the Island found the surf too high to land, but sent my boat to take my order near the shore and despatched it through the surf and presented it. The articles were all collected and another day when it was smooth my boats landed and took off all we wanted. Three iron hoops would load my boat with potatoes and yams, having the hoops cut in pieces for change. One hundred pounds of iron hoops procured more vegetables than $160. had at the other Islands, so many ships having resorted there for supplies. On my first visiting those Islands two hundred pounds of hoops purchased all I wanted, but the natives had learned the value of money since my first visit to those Islands in 1819. Previous to this date no Whaling ship had ever been at any of those Islands.\n\nI left Niihau 6th of 4 Mo 1822 for japan and was absent from the Islands five months, having taken 1500 barrels which completed my cargo, 2150 barrels of sperm oil.\n\nI had a fine passage to the United States, in twelve months had taken fifteen hundred barrels and made my passage home. On my arrival found business of all kinds depressed and sperm oil was never at so low a figure. The settlement of the voyage was made up, figured on 37c per gallon the lowest rate of any cargo that ever came to this country. I drew my share for myself and for my interest in the ship (having a small interest in said ship) and stored my oil for a higher price. After remaining at home four months took the command of the Ship South America of Nantucket. Having sailed from New Bedford from 1808 to 1823. I still held my part of Ship Bal, na that was now freighting from New York.\n\nI sailed from Edgartown in Ship South America 21st of 8 Mo. 1823 for the Coast of Patagonia. Soon after sailing, I found the ship made too much water and after having a strong fair wind, I found the rate of leaking had doubled. I then directed to have the ship pumped morning and evening and went on our way and stopped at the Island of Pico, where we obtained a bountiful supply of vegetables and fruit at a very favorable rate, four barrels of whale oil paying for all our supplies. Being late for the season, we drove on as fast as possible, arriving on the whaling ground in two and a half months and had 270 barrels of oil 60 of which was sperm. We fished on till about the middle of 2 Mo. 1824. The whales then left the ground where we were cruising, about thirteen hundred miles from the Coast of Patagonia. I had all sail put on with the\n\nCAPTAIN EDMUND GARDNER, HIS JOURNAL. 37\n\nintention of going on with the Coast, but found my ship continued to increase the leak. In taking the last 800 lbs. it had leaked seven hundred strokes of the pump per hour. On the morning of the 24th, finding the leak increased, after I had had my breakfast, I laid it before my officers, if they were not satisfied, I would carry them in on the Coast and stay till they were all satisfied. My own mind was fully made up but wished my officers to be fully satisfied. I had not asked their counsel before. They were fully united, all of one mind, and that was for me to do what I thought best. I then directed for the studding sail booms to be put up and all things prepared for making a passage. In eighteen days we were at Bahia (San Salvador) where we were detained thirty-five days. After discharging cargo in part, I heeled my ship, stripped off some of the sheathing, found some of seams open and had calkers and carpenters come with their companies. After making some examination, the boss carpenter and boss calker conferred together and said (they not knowing I understood) \"We will do nothing unless he will discharge his ship entirely and we shall have a good job.\" They could both speak English fluently and did not know I understood Portuguese. One of them stated they could do nothing for me unless they went through thoroughly. I then asked them if they would do what I wanted and stop when I told them to. They then said they could not answer to the underwriters. I then asked them if they would do what I wanted them to and nothing more and they said no. I then told them the sooner they took their men on shore the better, and that I would do what needed to be done myself. This brought about a parley. One said to the other (in his native tongue) \"He will have nothing done.\" They then concluded as they were there with their men to do what I wanted them to. I asked them what they had to do with underwriters and who called them to the ship. I then told them I would have nothing done different from my direction and remained on the stage all the time they were at work. Having done all I wanted them to, I called for their bill for labor, which amounted to one hundred thirteen dollars. Had they pursued their course, the expense would not have been less than from six to eight thousand dollars. I left this place 6th of 4 Mo 1824 for the United States. I had stopped much of the leak, so I was satisfied to proceed. I was expecting to leave the next day when to my surprise I was informed by the Consul a communication from my ship's company had been received protesting against the ship's seaworthiness (no officer with them was under any obligation to have a survey). I told the Consul it was my wish for him\n\n38 CAPTAIN EDMUND GARDNER, HIS JOURNAL.\n\nto appoint a survey even if there was no legal necessity. He accordingly did so and they remained on board an hour to ascertain the amount of leak per hour.\n\nNine of my men had refused to do any more duty until the ship should be thoroughly repaired. When I left the ship, I instructed my first officer not to give liberty for any to leave the ship but not to stop them from going, but see they took nothing but what belonged to them. I also told him to send the boat for me at 6 o'clock in the morning, sending me a list of those on board. By the Mate's list, I found nine had left. A ship had been sold and her men were transferred to me by the Consul, making my full complement. Several of the deserters applied to me to join the ship again. I told them they had deserted the ship once, 'twas not worthwhile to join the ship for if I had occasion to go to another port, they might desert again. Therefor I thought it better for them to look out for themselves and not desert twice in one voyage. I had thirty-seven days' passage from Bahia to Edgartown, where we arrived on the 12th of 5 Mo. 1824.\n\nI took passage in the Packet to Nantucket, somewhat surprising my owners for they were desirous of my spending the whole season on the Coast of Patagonia. While on the fishing ground, I had an opportunity of writing by a homeward bound ship. I had never mentioned my ship's leaking (my intention had been to remain on the Coast of Patagonia until the sixth month), but when I was writing the Agent mentioned, \"I shall not stay late on Coast, particularly should my ship prove more dropsicaI.\" I thought it would put them on their guard, but I did not want to alarm them. The evening I anchored in Tarpolin Cove, the pump was going one third of the time. The previous day I had carried sail with a brisk breeze, which increased the leak fifty per cent from what it had been on the passage. I had been absent eight months and a half and had taken 1500 barrels and a small quantity of bone. Oil was eighteen cents per gallon and bone six cents per pound. These prices were not remunerating, I therefor made up my mind to go no more whaling and accordingly have been no more in this business.\n\nI remained at home until the last of the year when I sailed in Ship Phebe Ann of New Bedford on a trading voyage to Brazil. Our first port was Pernambuco, where we arrived in one month and a half. The cargo was an assorted one, consisting of oil, salt, dry goods (domestics), fish, wine, hams, and cheese. On my arrival, I found the market was fully supplied and a heavy, dull market for my cargo. I disposed of what I could and then went to Bahia,\n\nCAPTAIN EDMUND GARDNER, HIS JOURNAL. 39\n\nwhere the market was well supplied, sold another portion of the cargo, and as there was no sale for the balance, I made up my mind to leave for Rio Janeiro, where I arrived after a short passage. I found the market fully supplied there too, but after a time sold all my cargo except the salt, which I found would bring nothing more than the ballast I should have to buy. I therefor kept the salt in and invested my funds in hides, horns and coffee.\n\nI will now give a description of the harbors of each of the ports before mentioned. Pernambuco looks more like art than nature, for the recife 1 which protects the shipping is something like five or six miles in length, nearly level with the sea, at spring tides it flows over making it rugged for the shipping two or three hours, but after the tide ebbs off, it is like lying in a dock all still and quiet. It was a very healthy place when I was there. Fruits and vegetables of tropical growth were fine and in great quantities. They also have excellent fish from the banks not far distant. There's an inner harbor where vessels are taken to repair, quite like going into a basin. The depth that can be carried over the bar is not over thirteen feet. My ship drew that depth and on crossing the bar stopped for a short time, having all the between decks cargo on board the ship heeled easily on one side, floated and went over the bar, where there was water enough. All ships and vessels were moored to the recite.\n\nDuring my stay at this place, there were many holidays and among them was Carnival, on which much preparation was being made, balls of wax filled with water of various colors were prepared for weeks before. On that celebrated day no business was done. It was a common thing on persons meeting to throw wax balls containing water into each other's faces. Some were on verandas with syringes holding more than a quart, pouring the contents on the passersby. On that day, I was dressed for the occasion in an entire black suit (no business could be done this day). I walked up the principal street of the City, several females were in a veranda and as I approached where they were, I heard one of them say \"no 'twill not do for he is a priest,\" (or rather a padre), so I passed on. The next who came was drenched, but I escaped, being taken for a spiritual guide. During the holidays, Ray and Bryant, who did my business, invited all who were consigned to them to spend the day at their country seat, about three miles from the City. It was late before we finished dining and I remained through the night for in\n\n40 CAPTAIN EDMUND GARDNER, HIS JOURNAL.\n\nthat country I would not travel nights. In early morning I made up a party to ride to the beautiful little village of Babareba, where we arrived just as the sun was rising. A gorge through the mountains made a pass for us when the town opened to us, the sun showing full on all the buildings, an open square in front of a spacious church, which was white, surrounded with everlasting verdure and with orange trees well stocked with fruit.

Many had their horses in waiting while others rode in a sedan carried by two negroes. The way to the upper City was very steep up a zigzag road making many angles in getting to the top of the hill. Once you arrived at the upper City, it was beautiful, a fine breeze making it comfortably cool. There you had in view a splendid City extending over a large space, no part being compact.\n\nOn such public demonstration while I was there, the City was illuminated.
