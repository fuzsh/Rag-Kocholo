        "meta_description": "A list of 2,888 films compiled on Letterboxd, including Abbott and Costello Go to Mars (1953), Abduction (1975), Abie's Irish Rose (1946), The Abominable Dr. Phibes (1971) and About Face (1942). About this list: As I've become more enthralled by cinema over the years, I have cherished reading all I possibly could about my favourite hobby. A fine resource I have discovered has been 'The Motion Picture Guide' which, in 1985, came out for films 1927-1983, then they put out annual guides till about 1999. I wish they kept on making them up to the present! This list is one of 12. There are 11, ranging by half-star increments from zero to five stars, and, inexplicably for one year, they refused to give an objectifiable rating for the films, then returned to doing so the following year. I fervently wish that when they did so, they retroactively, at least as a footnote, and to be complete, gave a star-rating for the year they had comparatively neglected. This list of 'one-star' rated films represents 'poor' films, and would be comparable to the 2/10 score on IMDb. One-star films that were listed in 'The Motion Picture Guide' that WEREN'T on Letterboxd were: --Acquitted (Frank R. Strayer, 1929) --Pasaporte al infierno (aka 'Action Stations' or 'Hi-Jack'; Cecil H. Williamson, 1956) --Adventure Ltd.

        "text": "As I've become more enthralled by cinema over the years, I have cherished reading all I possibly could about my favourite hobby. A fine resource I have discovered has been 'The Motion Picture Guide' which, in 1985, came out for films 1927-1983, then they put out annual guides till about 1999. I wish they kept on making them up to the present!\n\nThis list is one of 12. There are 11, ranging by half-star increments from zero to five stars, and, inexplicably for one year, they refused to give an objectifiable rating for the films, then returned to doing so the following year. I fervently wish that when they did so, they retroactively, at least as a footnote, and to be complete, gave a star-rating for the year they had comparatively neglected.\n\nThis list of 'one-star' rated films represents 'poor' films, and would be comparable to the 2/10 score on IMDb.
