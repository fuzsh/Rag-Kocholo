Tape one. Let me start by opening the vacant birth and your family background where you're born. Yes.\n\nEdward Williams 0:34\n\nWell, my name, as you say it's Edward Williams. But that's not my full name. My full name is Edward Aneurin Williams,\n\nwhich is the result of a certain part of me and being of Welsh origin.\n\nThat I've been to an ad in Williams's, it's been two of Nigerians in Parliament, and no one is great in Ireland getting good health during my lifetime. And the other was my grandfather was an IBM should have been a liberal MP for the Constitution of Durham until about 96, was the first person to use the term League of Nations in 1917, I think, to describe the kind of organisation which would be needed after the war said nothing like that ever happened again. One part of man, one of my great, great, great grandfather's was an extraordinary Welsh character called Edward Williams, but he acquired about it neighbours got organic\n\nfood who half researched and half invented a good deal of Welsh history. I won't say anything more about him.\n\nI was born in 1921. And my father was a veterinarian Williams was, was a journalist. At that time, he's a man of extraordinary wide interests and talents. He'd been collecting folk songs as young man, when he wrote NyQuil only for short, what had he been also secretary of the folks on rescue, for example, a short while published a couple of volumes of both poems, one of which was anthologized a good deal during the war was in the wardrobe, and the auction item to do a bit for a bit, I think, and then the king's commission, and married my mother James wall. My mother, my mother was an American from Colorado isn't American, Colorado, she's still alive. still playing her keyboard inventing songs and things. And I think probably most of my greatest part of my musical influences came from originally from her she played the piano, I would have been shut down and lots of\n\nvarious bits of Debussy in Japan, particularly as a child, and\n\nI also was given an induction into music. He had played me a lot of us to pay for our own pleasure, a lot of music, Mozart on the gramophone and Schubert. He's things like that, Paul reps, there's none. Anyhow, that I suppose started me off. And I was sent to boarding school committee, which was thought to be obligatory in those days for children with the middle class. I went well, I went to first the first school I went to Valley Nafisa de se francais in in London. And that was the very school first school I went to get my first musical performance. See my book saw that our gap so moving on, I burst into tears Did you have a prosperous House about five or six. Then I went to a little boys Day School in Chelsea, where my parents lived. When I was sent abroad, to a boarding school in in broad strokes for four or five years. And then when it was called Hilda shimmer house I went to see the I'll get to the school but I was in the process for other reasons. We just got to see if that place is still there. I had a reasonably good voice. So from the time from about I don't know I suppose. 1997 88 onwards. 3728 years of age. I went I went towards what it was like seven or eight. And from that time onwards until I left university, I suppose I sang in a Church of England service every day of my life, apart from Hong Kong. So I had to give, I'm an education, we're involved in getting sort of the repertoire of the\n\nEnglish Anglican church music from the 16th century onwards in those days. And I then went on to rugby with my father, and\n\nfive years down the road. I swore I wouldn't say Maya Angelou, etc. Because I've seen it. I didn't have a particularly bad time or anything like that. But it was a I really, I suppose I need to emotional deprivation, it definitely shows up that you're deprived of the people who love you and who love them that I find that very difficult, although I can have a very unpleasant time like that. And the compensation was music. They had a very, very good music department. The head which Michael Caine stops was, am I speaking too loud? I'm not loud enough. Is that right? Yes, okay. A man called Ken Stubbs, who was ultimately, who was at that time the uncle by marriage of two quite well known young, duo pianists. Nadia and Geraldine Pepe nodine Pepin was the mother of my wife, Judas, although that didn't have many years later. In fact, the Bedouins games of rugby to give a concert in Johnson is all Marvels programme which they played, observed beautifully. I remember the programme no one can hear at least I can come here to my memory. Anyhow. Rugby gave me the chance of one extremely sympathetic young visit now to read was much older than me. who encouraged me to listen to a lot of contemporary music kind of passion then for devious and Warlock and Walton ballrooms his Fourth Symphony. Now I'm not quite sure the day to date, it certainly made a deep impression on me the time that might have been after I left school, I'm not quite sure.\n\nUnknown Speaker 7:38\n\nAnyhow,\n\nEdward Williams 7:40\n\nI was, I was able to, to do a lot of scenes, making an ipv6 was not pretty well, the piano and the Caridad to the tube and the double bass and bass housings. But and I decided at the end of my school career, I think I must have finished in 1939. Yes, it must be my last term must have been 1939. Sorry, the year 1999 40. I must have left school\n\nwent into the Navy in September the 19th 1941. That's right. So on. I left University in February natural the end of March 1941. I must have gone to university for terms at the end of 1949 39. waste time. Yes, that's right. I can I can work that out. Anyhow, I went to Cambridge to Trinity College, Cambridge. My father, again. I decided by this time that I wanted to have some kind of musical career I'd gotten some conducting rugby I'm lucky enough to be able to sort of start an orchestra and acting classes and that sort of thing. And and I decided that I wanted to go into to music in some kind, professional, professional way, for which I must say I had really well, I've it's certainly no training I really had very and I'd never have got into college, at least not not at the standard they are now then. My father offered my father You see, my father had a fairly hefty private infamous result of history where an earlier Edward Williams had got a job in a massive digital steelworks of the guest family and had done very well and become a manager of that and then they'd asked to do their managers do works in Ironworks in Middlesbrough. And he then set up on his own And he made helicopter money. This was my great grandfather, Edward Williams. And his sons were then all set up obviously, lots of money and and jobs. And so my my grandfather known Williams The one who went to Parliament, he never went into business at all he, he got qualified as a barrister, but never practised and devoted himself to politics and various other cooperative movement he was he was the editor of the Cooperative Bank, Bernard Williams. For some time, he very ardent supporter of the cooperative movement, he translated a number of books about cooperation and so on, wrote a book about competition and self publishing for men cities, I think, anyhow, I've got a copy. And cooperation was one of his songs, nothing was the the Garden City movement, he was very much concerned with the setting up of one of what he called Letchworth gardens, and so on. But so he left his son and daughter very well off, unfortunately, he died in the head, or actually, fortunately to happen. in financial terms of magic Vinci, unfortunately, he died in 1937, something like that. Just when the slump had hit everything, including people's private fortunes, and when he died, my father had to pay death duties on what he'd been earning before he died his income before he died on an income which was reduced very little because of the two, although these are comparative terms that I say, however, my father hadn't been forced to earn his living. And he took a job. Again, this is a comparative thing to the job, got a job on the times. And for the rest of his life, worked on till he died. He worked on the times, getting all sorts of jobs, he's pretty close on time, he goes warmer than the Arctic is where he's museums correspondent, fourth leaders in all sorts of interesting jobs in the paper. Anyhow, that's really a preparation for saying that my father had a very good, very trusting view of the arts as a profession for anybody. He himself knew that he hadn't managed to make a great deal of money when he was in. And in fact, when I met the first job I got with neuro development when we completely took me on after the war. I got paid five pounds a week. And my father said, which was on which I drove a car and paid the rent for a flat in Chelsea, for God's sake. You know, I mean, it wasn't, it must have been quite worth having. I was design much notice. But my father said, That's more than you'd ever do in his life. So obviously, he was paid less than that on the times he was expected to if you worked on the times, in those days, you were expected to have some kind of a private detective as well. So anyhow.\n\nSo he was determined that I shouldn't have an artistically I would that be well provided with something else, he wanted me to be able to have some kind of fishing. So we made a bug in the device. If I read some, somebody can give me a degree of no income, not not easy, then he might pay for Maggie's good education after that. So I, in fact, in modern languages, read French and Spanish, Cambridge, but I mean, this was the four terms of the war. And in fact, I knew I was going to go up into the Navy and attend a single lecture in my I went one two tutorials which interested me with, with the person who taught me French in Rome, I can't remember now. Because it was an interesting subject. And one, two things on the Spanish literature and one is on German literature. But I did nothing I will, right. All my time was spent playing music and beauty in the theatre and doing the jolly things that weren't acting at work. So the war of a node that bargain and I had been very interested in films, which had been really one of the things although music was the principal here, and I'd also been very interested in films, I can remember producing Midsummer Night's Dream and my prep school when I was 11, or 12, as well. And I can remember pretending to make films with a waste of a wastepaper box, perched out with a huge great camera, you know, and making my mates behave as though they were on a film session. So I'm curious thing to do. So I must have had a passion for film as well. Although I didn't have a camera and I didn't. We just have marvellous film shows at that. At that, prep school, Saturday nights, as well as the great old flattery projectors, you know, and we'd see I'd add to the inkwell and Mickey Mouse and all sorts of things I'm talking about, yes, I suppose 1928 to 1934, something like that. So that was part of my view. The other. The other thing that I think had quite profound effect on me was that my mother used often, or seems to me often in the holidays, take me to the Regent Street poly cinema, where I remember seeing the flat he films, you know, I remember seeing a film called caribou about and the Polynesian Island film of that name. I can't remember why No, no, no, that's right. And various things like that. And I suppose that must have affected me, all the articles had other film tastes as well, for data entry directors, and all those lovely things which you had, anyhow, I got, I become a member of the Cambridge University, Film Society, which sexually which was that was a great friend of mine called Peter Bryce, who subsequently became the editor of the trailer unit. And we were friends and stayed friends for a very long time. So he lives. He used to live not far from me here in Gloucestershire saw him till he died two years ago. Anyhow, so I used to do a lot to film shows of the Film Society, I remember seeing a lot of documentaries. And one day, he said to me, knowing that I was going to go down again to Jim, listen, I think Mira, Mathis needs an assistant, why don't you apply? And so I did. And he gave me the job, he gave me the job, not because I was qualified to do it, which I certainly wasn't. But although I had done some conducting, but getting the job because because all the young men who might have done that job being an assistant for him, were aware of the war. So, I mean, I was really extremely lucky to get that job. One of the things I go on talking to john Taylor, seven or eight years ago, talking about all this sort of thing, that at that time, and I suppose substance for quite some considerable time before that documentary film\n\nhad got a very high status in the in, in Intel intellectual surgery, is that the right word? I mean, there was a good deal of radical shake about it, everybody was on the left and document his films with one of these is an example of the the flowerings of of those kinds of attitudes, the idea that somehow or other we could represent to represent real life could be represented honestly. And clearly. And that would help us to make a better way, and what you know, sort of views which I'm sure, you know, but and this is sort of this to a certain extent, I don't mean that everybody in films that time is bound to be on the left, but but you know, there's certain sort of political attitude involved in wanting to be in films at all, or anyone can be in documentaries. And I think I must very much have shared\n\nUnknown Speaker 18:19\n\nthat. So anyhow, you would seem presumably, I speak poorly of some of the examples. Oh, yes.\n\nEdward Williams 18:31\n\nThat's right. And Cambridge, of course, because the four times I was actually at Cambridge, we had regular showings a few times to Ember films, which would include, you know, foreign in British documentaries, and of course, also feature films. I had started my film education. I didn't know very much about it before that. But anyhow. So I went to see him here and continue that part of the story. Not to be 9014. There's no question of, you know, sorry. It wasn't it was 1941. I'm sorry about your discussions in one's head. But 1941 it certainly was because I went to the Navy in September, and I must have, I only worked in the office six months. So I must have left Cambridge at the end of the spring term, and gone to work from your own March. Anyhow, I went to see him Yes. And I was able to sat down a bit with the Cambridge. And so he, he said, Well, you start to go wherever you like, Well, next Monday, come come to Denham studios. We've got a recording on there, and you can stop. So I arrived. And it's I have to say that I could very much involved in music. So I knew quite a lot of music. I go through a lot of concerts and I had great passions in life, particularly for the English composers for Williams, Welton. Also for Bartok, because I get So you can imagine my I didn't want to say any absolutely delight, which I discovered when I got into this great big studio that the composer was on Riggins. The film was fortnight's parallel, which was identified tool that the director produces was micropile, who's the edge of the world? I knew very well, because I'd seen it made a powerful impression on me four years earlier. And the thought that I was actually in the same room as only in front is actually having supposed to be doing some being paid to be there. I mean, he was the editor. That's right. And in fact, my first pretty young camera, yes, I didn't get obviously come across him. But one of the first jobs after recording session is now had to go and sit with David lean in the cutting room, in order to give him advice he wanted you That's to say you could cut from here to here, musically. And that would work if you're doing I don't remember what you were asking me. But then I sat watching him doing it, you know? I'm just telling you, what you perhaps I should say, as a presenter this, I suddenly get struck every now and then when I'm telling people, things like this. You want to how much am I making this up? I'm quite good at making up perhaps everybody's good. I said in practically making up. Or rather adding two stories. So they are just a little bit funnier than they really were in the first place. I've got quite an amusing story, which I'm about to tell you on. The cruise arrives in Cumberland taking put coming to anchor just before the Queen Mary or the Queen Elizabeth, the client, that I leave it, I think I probably added to that, too. It's absolutely exaggerated. However, the story I'm gonna tell you knows arriving at this session, you know, a young man of 19. Never having conducted an orchestra before in his life and professionals never have gotten anything without having seen the score beforehand. In the presence of I suppose. The Well, one of the two or three people I admired most in the world that's on Williams. That's right. For region, and it was a sort of installing time delegated to conducting. Yeah, so I'll cover that in just a tick. No, no, I was just gonna say something about VW First of all, because you told me this and I put it down and told other people is I hope it's true. But I'm almost certain did tell me this weird said that VW had been very lucky to do anything at all when the world started. We're talking about now. Alright, Danny will be done entity. I'll go back to really tell me the story. And I think it's true. I think I remember this being driven I got to tell me that VW when the war started, had been very humbly of the belief that he shouldn't that music was very much second place to growing food and, you know, writing about the war effort, you know, I'm behaving as a patriotic citizen. So you've stopped writing because you can\n\nconfine himself to cultivating carrots or this is no story anyhow, in his garden and doc Anya documented and mirrored persuaded to be done seem strange, that he that he could make a contribution to the war effort, which wasn't just going as it he wrote music for this job. He had quite a strong, anti Nazi, patriotic flavour element in the Scripture, Oprah's about a crew of German sub mariners landing in Canada, being wrecked or somehow finding themselves in Canada and having to get across in the fortnight parallel to America in order not to be made a business of walks at that time, because Americans were not allied with with us. Anyhow, that's the story of how VW came to be there. And they're doing this particular film. And I imagined that my job was to hold me as coach and to say, yes or no, somebody have a glass of water, it might be. And so after we had played through the title music two or three times, he suddenly said, Edward Said, yes. And I went up to find out what he wanted. And he said, just run this through for me while you while I go into sniffing the box. Well, I've never been frightened in all my life. I mean, he was a huge orchestra at lunch, the orchestra led by Oh, George Stratton. Not so video witnesses but they all were seem to be gentlemen old enough to be my grandfather me sitting there since rich dad you know and the thought of even standing up contracts advice to understate conductive essentially. So Pailin sweating, I waved my way through this piece, you know, with another tricky five for about two hours to get through and got through to the end, right. And my story is I getting husbandry data. I'm making this up. Now I'm not but there was a certain amount of sympathetic tapping from orchestral musicians who I subsequently discovered were far from. Far from difficult people if they didn't think you were being autocratic or haughty about things, since I had no potentials at that time and have many potentials now. I found myself with getting on very well with orchestra musicians have a certain amount of sympathetic, capitalistic saying, right? He didn't do too bad because I can see I was terrified out of my life. Enough, George Stratton said to me, the leaders have dwelled on my boy, he will follow this very well. So I knew I wasn't gonna be a great from that place. Anyhow, you have any visual points you have to hit because presumably, I wasn't recording into picture wasn't rehearsing computer. No, no, I wasn't this. No, I'm sure I wasn't. Well, that was unfortunate. It's parallels. inches. Okay. I've said already by David lean. And I can remember, I suppose my first introduction to the film catalogue was being sent by Muir to sit in the catacombs. Well, David lean laid these tracks. The idea being that if he'd come had to make some kind of cut in the music, I should be able to advise him whether it actually worked musically. As the key of the two joins, we're going to work together. I can't remember who actually did anything then or not. But I spent what I think of now as being six amazingly interesting and happy months working for me. I think it's probably worth saying a bit about me or no, was a young Scot. I mean, he must have been barely in his 30s when I first met him in 1940, if he was that he had been taken on by coda originally in the mid 1930s, to conduct Arthur polices music, for things to come from things to come. The story that I remember whether or not he said that God of being that kind of man that wants to get to the top chat for the first glass artists for everything he did, and obviously had employed bliss, who was the sort of principal or one of the most important English youngish English composers of that time, with a reputation as a as a bit of the avant garde and so on. And he tried to get the best known conductor of the day to do it. Now come, Sergeant, and Sergeant had said he wouldn't do it because jobs were pre disrupted what needs to be an in case the sergeant probably didn't say that. But he had a young student at the academy or the college, college, I think,\n\nwho we thought very well often who he suggests My job is up on Matheson who did the job and had great success out and by the time I came to work for him in 1941, he had a large practice as musical director for films. He worked every conceivable kind of film, though, when I first met him at this time, it is six months in 941. He had offices in 34, Soho square in the same house, that number is basically the same room as a large room in which all throughout an ambassador right, worked on. There was a sort of documentary newsletter that was that the name of the of the publication and he has some publication, which some central kind of documentary publication, and from which, Arthur belt and Brasil right and i think probably advanced as well there. I don't remember him being that the time work doing that consultancies with various ads with the various show media sets. It might be shallow women, they were working for us that effectively was still Central, that subset that actually forms entertainers. And my Cambridge friend Lionel Cole was also working guys as he was working as assistant one of them. So we of course, saw each other being the same sort of age and Bo was working, doing music for various films and a lot of documentaries. I seem to remember the one I remember most clearly. And again, I hope I've got this right because I came back five years later to work from you. But I think this was from this Dimas a film called The People's land, which is a film about the National Trust, which Ron Williams also wrote to me before. And I can remember, although I may be misplacing this, but I think I remember so misplacing it in time. I certainly remember Williams going down to the basement theatre at Green Park, where there was little white nightclub pianos decorated with the room and playing some of the score. Now, what I remember is that VW was actually frightful, excipient list, every t seemed to have large stubby fingers, which went crashing down at the keyboard, and you couldn't read distinguish any particular any particular notes, so to speak, okay. However, it was still an impressive and marvellous thing to have observed and seen. One or two other things from that time. It's interesting to reflect now, or having lived through the last 10 or 12 years just to reflect on the situation of the Union. aact at the zoo. At that time, the first thing I can remember being said to me the very first thing I read maybe no, maybe not quite as early in my career, so But pretty soon after I started working from your I still, don't you dare touch anything. As you touch a single thing, that's not your job, the whole studio correct. So I learned early that the Union had enormous power in that situation. just mentioned, slightly comical results out of this, I suppose. But for three, four weeks after I'd been working from your after my first session with him at Denham, and for 14 nights parallel. We had another session at Denham. And I knew that that I knew what the session and I can't remember the name of the film is a film for Herbert Wilcox, the well known British producing creative industry in Park Lane, I should think so No, no. Yes. Well, then he proceeded with this was what he was making them anyhow. And my job, I knew I knew everything about my job, right? Then I knew all the things I had to do, and I knew what everything was, and I was absolutely full of it, you know. And so I arrived at the studio early, my job was always just get to the studio early and see that there were enough stands for the orchestra. And you know, do all this sort of make sure that it was all right when it returned up. And sure enough, the word enough stands. And I'd been warned, don't you dare touch anything stands is props job. And if you want more stand you as props, don't go and get yourself, you know. So those anybody has to do and then start to the man came in and walked down the aisle, and I said, Oh, hello, props. Can we have some old standards, please. And I thought he looked a bit surprised. However, he went out without saying very much. About 10 minutes later, he came back in with mirror, or rather, came back in after your drive. And when he did come in, we said hello, a bit nice. It was the producer who was basically working. So\n\nRodney Giesler 33:18\n\nmaybe it was a flu or something.\n\nEdward Williams 33:22\n\nIt might have been his ice cartridge. And I can't remember who wrote the music for the record? Yes. Well, as far as denim and sort of films are concerned, and various other studios to older I can't remember many other studios, then First of all, I can remember learning from your about the money ethics of his job, he had very strong feelings about what he was doing, and the way it ought to go. he regarded himself as a consultant, but he called a consultant now, which is basically what he was, and he wouldn't handle any money. Previous musical directors had been fairly notorious for taking the money, and then taking a cut from everybody. So you take a cut from musicians you take those, some of people who were musical directors apparently did this and you're very much disapproved to this and said, No, what I do is to advise producers and directors on who I think would do the music for their film property, now as a result of his own kind of character. And I suppose he's experienced what had happened to him the the author, place and code and all that Muirhead. By the time I knew him got a very had had had a mission to to make sure that every film had music by first class we should compose it could be you know, he he thought this was something he could the audiences should have that that every British film should have. First Class music I first class British composers. And he said about doing this and of course, he was very much welcomed in documentary. Where Of course, they very much agreed with this, this view. And we were always trying to get contemporary composers and writers to collaborate with each other for documentary of all for all those sorts of reasons. So that was one of the the money ethics, part of it was his determination that he should not pay the orchestra, all he should do would be to advise he get paid for advising, you get paid for conducting the session, but the film company would be responsible for paying the musicians. So there was never any any sort of possibility of cuts being taken and that kind of thing. So as early as I can remember, in that business, the musicians had to be paid in cash at the session, no nonsense about checks or anything, because film is a good name for not turning up with the money the right time. So the somebody had to go in the film company had to provide an accountant with all the earlier books at a table and all these stashes of money. And at the end of it, the players would come up and each get paid in cash. And that happened that went on happening for a long time. into the 40s and 50s. And 60s, I think before people were prepared to trust, what 80s and 80s high 80s Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes. Well, I mean, many film companies didn't last very long. And, you know, you could understand musicians feeds, I didn't hold this against him at all. But yes, that's, I think you crept into the festival here as well. No, I was going to say that I just finally, just to finish up with talking about as it were my six months then, two or three other things have died. I acquired a great admiration for composers I'd never heard of before except in connection with films. There were two or three of them that john Greenwood who wrote the music for the for the film love on the dole, I think is underrated. No, Walter great. No, that's I'm making that up. Sorry. That's wrong. But anyhow, john Greenwood is a composer whose name I personally hadn't heard of very much in any other connection, except as a film composer. He wrote lovely music and very much admired. You're employed him a lot. What you're recommending for him, you know, to his producers a lot. Another one whom I liked very much his brand easedale was still alive, and someone who might be worth talking to, because he ended up with power press. That's right. And he wrote the red shoes, for example. So in my mind, I think I met basil right at that time, probably I certainly met Elton, who was living itself or partly to being a technical service grad that time as well. And the other person, the other person who may apparently he was it was both called Richard dad and saw\n\nwho subsequently became very famous. Maybe we had already by that time for writing a piece called the Warsaw conjecture, I think he must have written it later, after I first meet him. He was a compute composer of light music. I'd heard a score of his first film about Alster documentary adults too before I when I was an undergraduate liked it very much. Very nice, interesting Tommy music. And somehow or other, we got I know what he was, he was extremely nervous man. Like many composers get when their music is about to be played, particularly the recording session. You wonder what on earth you're going to have done, you know, have you written written all the wrong notes in order because you're going to sound actually fractals on? So I remember him saying, Do come talk to me with this because I'm actually terrified. And we subsequently became great friends. He was he, he had a lot of young friends and people he depended a lot on other musicians to help him and a lot of my musician, contemporaries had worked for him. I never thought myself really was technically capable. And after two scores, I'm yours because he did not do my own. So I never did that. That time, but he was very friendly and I got extremely drawn to him and liked him very much. And he was a very Museum, nice person that he worked with a lot with Joyce Grenfell. He enjoys Grenfell wrote songs together and review music and that kind of thing. And so, throughout the war, actually, I was in touch with them and I saw Joyce when she came out to capitol in my shape she was there. Anyhow, that's jumping the gun to say that I went my six months was up, as I'd known was happening. I was called up into the Navy in September 1941, and went off to a training ship, which was actually a bucklins camp in North Wales, and spent five years in the Navy and all over the world really. And when I came out of the Navy in the 4647, when it was five years later, yes. Mira very kindly took me back on again, I think felt that he had to certain as much as most people felt most employers felt after the war, that they had a certain duty to take on people who've been away to war. I really, I think we are probably realised then that I wasn't really what needed to be used to him, I really hadn't got a lot of the kind of skills that he needed, particularly now. I mean, when I came back to him in 46, he had become the czar of English film music. He was the musical director of films for the rank Empire, which really amounted to practically every studio except eating that there was. He had offices at Denham studios again. He employed two or three or four assistants, my great friend, Marcus, Dawn's and john Hollingsworth, and with the other people, dusty buck from Pinewood came to be his sort of admitted administrative head to run the sort of music department. A friend of my sister's friends D'Andrea is one of my sisters Jane my sister from who've been at Stanford University and become a great friend of a girl called Sheila King students. I suppose I must have introduced her to me or generate me or took her on as in a capacity which became an entirely new union category. She then Sheila became a music continuity girl there never been anything like that before but her job was to sit in this sessions with a stopwatch and say how long each take was were you finished last year you know yesterday, all the all the things that continuity already does for for the camera for on the set or in shooting. She did for formula and she in fact, it's it got her own category in the Union. So it was a large department I worked a lot with john Hollingsworth doing various documentaries and perhaps not the cop jobs. However, I do want to say something about our bright, two quite crucial things. One of them is the general thing about as I sometimes say to people, one of my universities, one of our universities was the first ship I served in, which was a old glide paddle steamer called the Queen Empress, which was crewed almost entirely by retired. No, by London farming, who were on we were doing the five years on the reserve in the Navy. And they were seem to be like elderly gentlemen, they were in their 40s and 50s. They were and they treated me like some strange sort of\n\ncreature, unknown to science, but they taught me how to behave taught me how you behave to your mates. What's decent behaviour between, you know, between mess mates, and all the sort of things that a young man needs to learn. And they taught me that. The second bit of my university was the corridor was at dinner when I came back. It's extraordinary mixture of trades and people and actors of coders of denim were absolutely astonishing. You walked up and down at lunchtime or anytime they were crowded with people dressed in the costumes of every conceivable age. You know, you'd have Roman soldiers and 18th century lords and this extraordinary kind of mixture of people all eating together in the canteen and\n\nEdward Williams 0:09\n\nSo yes the current levels of denim packed with people dressed in every conceivable kind of costume and we all met in the canteen for lunch and all the various elements and everybody as far as I can remember it in the canteen My impression is that no star however prominent with rubber all the stars however come it actually ate in the canteen and there was a sort of there was a sort of obligation for the most junior camera by to call the most senior night of the stage by his Christian name You know, I'm in the capital I called Lawrence but he wasn't around so they've launched the alarie because it's somehow that was the ethos of film. I may be exaggerating but it seemed to me that that's what happened out having come from rather conventional background as other almost distressed define such small young people calling such distinguished people, their customers but that seemed to be the the way it went.All in the lunchtime conversation.\n\nI don't my course we all had agile we all have particular friends my great friend, Peter Price, I mean, friend at work, in a sense first, I knew but Dawkins actually suggested to me his blessing I got the job with me in the first place. He by now was running the editing attenuated trailers department, where they they centralise that business and all the all the trailers are all the films they work the Rankin part was making were made in the trailer unit. We had the soundstage, of course, and then we had offices, I would be sent out every day I had a car, and now this car, which I drove, which I kept up on a salary of five grand a week, and a flat. And I would drive with john Haynesworth or with me or whoever it might be, to all one of the studios where we might be working. Sometimes I had to go on my own to to the studio, I remember going to the Gainsborough studios to shepherds, Bush to supervise a very nice pianist whose name I forgotten teaching somebody some star. It might have been the famous one about a piano concerto is James pacing and enjoy it. Well. No, yes, I never did. She wasn't the star was she paid him his goals and targets or didn't wasn't put somebody somewhere? rather nice. Okay. Russian pianist was was deputy to teach us how to play a nice list of constellations, which I remember having to be there and we were the junior staff like myself, we're expected to be at any on any stage where something musical is going on and where the director might need a musical. Some kind of musical hand is Lincoln. Pinewood Gaines, we're at Shepherds Bush. We seem to have a finger in every almost every student in England. Of course, Ealing was not in words Empire, but his brother doc Matheson was assistant to the great musical director of healing. There's no mitochondrial. Any\n\nRodney Giesler 3:28\n\njoy, right?\n\nEdward Williams 3:30\n\nThat's right. But there was a very, very distinguished and much admired musician who was in charge of music in general, and whom I heard a great deal about although I do actually know very well, well, perhaps it'll come back later. Anyhow, that was, as I say, a very interesting bit of my education. But perhaps the most important thing that happened to me was very soon after I got my defect, I think of it as the very first thing. first job I didn't know when I got back after the war. I had to go with your two denim to see the rough cut or fine cut of my neck. The film which I carry heated made with James Mason and Robert Beatty, and those other people, a film about the an IRA gunman.\n\nUnknown Speaker 4:34\n\nWounded\n\nEdward Williams 4:36\n\nbeing sought by the police, round in case dragged the police but slowly and painfully rounds round round the docks Belfast by the police is the most extraordinary thing happening coloured my view of of films and musical films. Hereafter it's, I remember, we walked into the place with Carl Reed was there and composer was there, I think the component the composer was going to write was, will evolve. I think perhaps will evolve in wasn't there the first time, I think probably it was just me, and greed and presumably the editor on Sunday. So we sat there watching this film, and I was absolutely stunned. I've I had never seen anything so powerful and realistic in my life. It was the kind of realism that one hadn't expected from the cinema. Now, what I saw then, was a film which had nothing on it, except, of course, the dialogue and the effects laundry effect, the sirens, river Hooters. And I thought it was absolutely marvellous. And when we finished watching those long pause, and you said, Well, I don't know, I probably haven't made blended Our job was at that time, one of the first jobs that he's going to do is to try and help the director to decide where the music is going to go, shortly how it hears me there, what kind of moves we have this, and all those sort of things that have been decided, you know, very well. So as I said, at the end of this viewing of the film, we sat in silence, and I said, I really don't know what to do about this, I think I'd like to see it again. So two days later, we came back another week. And I don't want to go on too much about this. I can't remember how many times he saw it productive. It was more than twice that we saw before. We were able to well, not obviously I had no part of this, but perform your and Carol Reed and presumably the composer that I don't remember, that could decide which sections would have music in between.\n\nUnknown Speaker 7:10\n\nNow\n\nEdward Williams 7:14\n\nthere were two factors in this, which I think very interesting. First of all, it seemed to me that the effect of the of the of the effect of the effects of the natural effects of the of the of the sounds of the police cars, and who does all those things, was so powerful, that gives such a sense of realism, that I think we all felt unconsciously that music would actually remove the reality from turning into some kind of Algerian drama, rather than someone who's absolutely immediately, you know, like a, like a television producer, which is what it was, you know. And although I mean, not to say that, you it's interesting that it seemed to me very realistic, I did, in fact, know that he didn't know it had been shot largely on the stage, but he did live in being shot on vacation as it were. But he didn't seem very, very realistic in that time. So there is this difficulty about trying to about whether we should have any music at all, or rather where we're going to put it or whether the other interesting thing about us is, I discovered you're told me after the first time that actually the music had already been used, that when when had actually written up this piece is beautiful to add, he had written it, and it had been played on the set all the time that that film is shot. So that Mason, when he had moved had moved, as he learned about that he moved in time for music, but the music was as you were dictating the atmosphere and living all the time. And in a sense, I came to think, but I wonder if the music hasn't actually done its job already. You know, before, before we ever got to the stage where you're done. I thought after four days, the most beautiful tune in the music is beautifully scored as you'd expect from that great night in the morning. But somehow, I just wondered whether whether the music hadn't already done its work and looks like the music was really, in a sense spoiled the film. I don't expose that it's really true. But what I\n\nUnknown Speaker 9:33\n\nmean I was telling you the impact of\n\nUnknown Speaker 9:38\n\nthe music\n\nUnknown Speaker 9:39\n\nis one of the overriding\n\nUnknown Speaker 9:42\n\nnews and yet\n\nUnknown Speaker 9:43\n\nseeing it freely. Whenever I like to. It's straight. It's extraordinary. How\n\nEdward Williams 9:49\n\nlittle music there isn't easy to see as a key. Yes,\n\nUnknown Speaker 9:52\n\nsee? Yes.\n\nEdward Williams 9:55\n\nWell, that's really for that reason. Did you did you know about the music being played before Never too fast. Yeah, but perhaps you didn't it wasn't even aware of it.\n\nThis would have been because they wouldn't notice it if it's going on but she wouldn't I don't know. This particular scene\n\nUnknown Speaker 10:13\n\nI'll keep the thing is interesting is I'm reminded of a carol read signature in a film. It's the same in the third Matthews as a child. Oh, yes. Yes. I remember the child with that man. When he's Yes. Joseph cotton is finding out about the accident. The child's listening to the argument going on. And same thing with Robert Beatty is looking for Johnny McQueen. The little girl with a single red estate. Yes, yes. He's trying to get this information. Yes, she's seen it. She works all the other hand investor.\n\nUnknown Speaker 10:47\n\nYeah.\n\nUnknown Speaker 10:52\n\nWell, crazy. Oh, Robert uses pink. Yes. Yes, that's right. But you will switch between show and father Tom?\n\nUnknown Speaker 10:59\n\nYeah, yes.\n\nUnknown Speaker 11:00\n\nYes. Only they're linking it's a bit like access from an exhibition when you got one picture? Yes. And it's the same thing when joining McQueen's on the movies starting off in one house, he stacks on to the next house. Yes, the scenes in the actual houses\n\nEdward Williams 11:18\n\nwill not stand the essential. Well, that was really interesting. Anyhow, this left me with a with a quite profound feeling about music. What I thought then and still to a certain extent thing is that in many ways, music for films, music in films is or is powerful, it almost indirect inverse ratio to to humanities, the less use of affinities, you know, innocence. And I then the rest of my time with Mia. I find myself arguing this quite a bit. No, I think I have only what I wouldn't have one fault to find with me or adapt was his willingness to copy everything with me. So I don't know. I mean, I think there was a great feeling that we get some musical we'd better work to get you to know after all Africa, but I don't I shouldn't say that he\n\nUnknown Speaker 12:15\n\nwas doing it\n\nEdward Williams 12:16\n\nin order to get that kind of money. But you know, there was there's a sense in which the payment musician and we want some nice music in here. It sounds nice. We can and I thought this was his only weakness in the sense many forms in which was much too much music, and are many of the jobs which I would run with the john things with. I would when I got sort of bit bolder and prepared to stick my neck out with my seniors would often suggest that I couldn't remember a particular film. Johnny's was caught rather share it with me about we went to see a film isn't the answer, Nemo for the crown jewel unit, john Taylor, I think was then head of that unit. And it was a film about the treatment of young offenders who come out on it. And one of the cases was called, or the, the young man was in trouble because he had some difficult home circumstances or something like that. But he was played by the man who plays the cookie minder, what's he called? George George Ko, hatch. Anyhow, a lot of this took place in prison, you know, we saw that it's obviously young man in his cell, and also things like that. And john and i were there to advise john Hollingsworth about where what sort of music we should have, how much and so on, and I came out of it. It's not very often due to films. Feeling we don't want to Oh, it's all there, you know, exciting and where music is only going to distract from from from the thing and they said, Listen, john said to me after this call, you can't get on as we are living here. You can't tell him all don't want him who's equally we should be on the dough. So anyhow, that was that was my video, it was one of the things I felt strongly about in music. Although, of course, when I came to do it myself, I often find myself putting in much too much. Anyhow, that was,\n\nUnknown Speaker 14:16\n\nwas apropos. I hesitate to mention this too. I have had a number of films where they are over orchestrated, and we have dropped sections and issues. I've always got my editor delay effects. Yes, but you could either move them together, or drop one or the other. If we run it and see the sequence went far better.\n\nEdward Williams 14:41\n\nAbsolute.\n\nUnknown Speaker 14:42\n\nproposing something he was paying for it.\n\nEdward Williams 14:44\n\nYes. Yes, that's right. Just\n\nUnknown Speaker 14:47\n\nrepeat things when you're on the final.\n\nEdward Williams 14:51\n\nNo, that's quite true. And to NDTV it's quite a difficult judgement or certainly was in those days very much more difficult judgement that is to make now I mean, since you didn't really see on here, everything together until when you got to the dub, I mean, you could run it on the on an on a detail or something was separate tracks, but quite difficult to get a real impression of what things gonna feel like and you actually got to the dub and, and so that seems really quite difficult. I agree.\n\nUnknown Speaker 15:22\n\nI think also the other factor if I can ship in, I view here was that one of my, I would sit down with a composer and I would go as far as I could in describing music with words, and the effects I wanted to achieve. Yes, but I never knew what he was going to come up with. One in one. Yes, yes, that's right. And sometimes it was it was disastrous, and it wasn't what I wanted to for other times. Of course, it was something totally unpredictable. On which you could fill, yes, you know, it was a new theme. And you often structured the soundtrack in different ways. Because we're with synthesisers. Now you can find out first,\n\nEdward Williams 16:07\n\nbut that's right.\n\nUnknown Speaker 16:08\n\nYes. So to hear one on one with the orchestra, of course, this is really\n\nEdward Williams 16:12\n\nwell, that's right. Yes. And I just mentioned to you that you are not the only one who's doing that because the composer's doing at the same time and less well, I'm speak for myself only, I should say, in this case, but I mean, I've never been to a session yet at which a the first half an hour I was acutely painful, not because this is where I got it wrong, but because the orchestra hadn't got themselves into my idea, nobody could feel exactly how to go. So you've spent the first 20 minutes listening. I speaking right now spend the first 20 minutes with you. Oh, God, did I really write that? Hi frightful. What am I gonna save the videos? So we're sitting there cold faced, hoping nobody was looking, you know, and then slowly I by talking to the conductor and saying that I wanted to be a bit more human, and suddenly it would start to become what I had imagined it or close to what I imagined. And you think, Oh, god, that's all right. But don't Mr. producers, things have gone to my page with this, or have I got to pay for this, you know,\n\nUnknown Speaker 17:10\n\nand indeed screen readers meeting\n\nEdward Williams 17:13\n\nfor the first class, right? That's right. That's right, right.\n\nUnknown Speaker 17:18\n\nYes, yes. Apart from the fact that I was finding a three hour session, you just get one. Take\n\nEdward Williams 17:24\n\naction. Yes, that's right. That's when that comes rather good cue for me just to say just a bit more about community. I very much feel that somebody ought to write a study of VR because he was an important and very important figure in the English film as he came in. He was that was what he brought it back would have happened in any way in some kind of way. But, but he was responsible for seeing that. Great. Many good composers were asked to collaborate in a multimedia form. The newest I mean, the new multimedia form versus since opera to be of use, which employed composers. So he, he, he had this mission to get good composing. I can remember when a young composer called Bernard Stevens won a prize offered by some of the one of the popular magazines, multimedia Express was something for I'm talking about late 40s. Oh, no. Yes. No. Yes, late 40s. For a symphony and Bernstein was one this well, he was immediately we all got in touch with him and said, Would you like to do a film and so he did. And the sad band went on to do good many films. The same happened to to the Scottish composer, Cedric Thorpe, Davey, who also won some kind of a prestigious prize, it may be in the same one and a subsequent here, and we are also employed. And then there was my great friend, Eleanor stone about talking about pathetic, who also I think as a result of winning, one of the ISC icsm prizes, was also started his own film career by invitation from you and me serving now I remember I know. Go well that any seven course was the evening and then decides that he was not in the rank Empire and he was in Grand camper. But Doc, curious now for meals brother, Doc Matheson who worked as an assistant to NCLB, who also employed Alan Ross on a great deal as a composer. So there was this thing about getting lots of composing lots of good composers and good music into too Contemporary British films have those questions those days. And don't forget to do not only of course, there's the musical director for rank but his assistants were dealing with the output of the crime Film Unit. And various documentary companies and so on. He did they did a lot of of music directing, so to speak. The other thing such as the little things about guy's talents, he he had a really great gift for doing sessions in session making these concessions is quite different from from from a concert.\n\nUnknown Speaker 20:45\n\nYes.\n\nEdward Williams 20:47\n\nThe other thing that I forgot to mention is Miro is great gift for conducting recording sessions. recording sessions are quite different from other kinds of music making quite different from concerts, anything else like that. They have their own requirements and their own tensions. In a concert rehearsing for a concert, you can get away with a lot of mistakes, simply by the vitality, and the the truth to the music of the performance. And the audience will put up with all sorts of mistakes if they are carried by performance by the conviction of performance in recordings. Although some people argue, I heard that the managing director of of well known term of grumpy record, manufacturer grantha records are being exactly that, that his company had decided they would go for good performances and help with the mistakes rather than what most recording companies go into, which is perfection, even if it means cut after cut after cut, half cut and splicing tape is on, which is after all possible. Anyhow. That was much less easy. When we first started doing this when I was 15 years ago, was what we're talking about.\n\nUnknown Speaker 22:18\n\nAnd we\n\nEdward Williams 22:20\n\nhad a great technique, it was absolutely marvellous, he managed to get the timing right time very important, as you were just saying, Rodney, that the the the way that it happens the way that you start slowly getting a reveal comfortable in their seats, and so on, we all had one or two quite simple rules. You know, we've tried to get something recorded before tea for the tea break, but not too much. Because it always played better. After the tea break, everybody was made better off to keep it hidden beforehand, he often wouldn't be the type of music first would leave that until everybody played themselves interview, choose something quite simple. He will always play through the whole thing. First of all, every piece, everybody had some idea what was coming up and again, they played themselves in and so on. He had enormous theatrical gift for doing it so that the producer sitting at the back of the hall in the hall whilst the recording studio was biting his nails by the last 10 minutes, because there were three more minutes to get in the bag. And there was only four more minutes to do it. And we would do it without the mistake. I realised everybody could do it without mistake that last three minutes of that has to be absolutely amazing. I mean, you would said half an hour for the unsession you said he'll never do it, he'll never do it. Because producers were going quite because used to say you know, every minute of the session cost 200 pounds or 1000 or whatever might be I mean, you just have a huge figure. But the time is very, very expensive. You have a large number of very skilled people all together in an expensive setup. No it was very, very expensive. But he was brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. And like everybody else your I think would like to have been something else as well he would like to have been a well known and successful concert conductor films had then and died the steel has to certain extent a slightly is slightly less of an artistic reputation then Symphony concerts you know if you were busy, if you were a film composer, it wasn't quite the same thing as being a composer, you know, and so on. And to be a film music director wasn't really quite the same. So grand is being a conductor of you know, of concerts. Of course, we are always in a position of great patronage. He could choose orchestra and he worked. He worked a great deal with the Philharmonia in those days I think we probably had we worked mainly with in the great days of mirrors, musical director of the whole rank empire in front of all British films at one time, apart from eating. He used to work a lot with the Philharmonia. You also used to work a lot with the lso and What subsequently became the London Symphony, I think another another professional London orchestra, which included many of the best names in. In OCA amongst orchestral players, people like young Goossens, and then his brain and it's rather all over the brain, and all sorts of people whose names I perhaps mentioned in a minute or two. So he had, he, he, he was able to bestow a great deal of patronage. And as a sort of quid pro quo. He used to get asked to conduct concerts, by the orchestras, because they knew he wanted to get concerts. And although he probably wasn't a great draw as a conductor, and in fact, I used to think I could understand why perhaps he wasn't thought of as a great conductor of concerts. And that's because the technique which he had for doing sessions was actually no good in concerts, sessions you had that say half an hour equals now musical 20 minutes he was maybe you haven't seen before, which you had to get absolutely right, in the course of three hours, three hour session, and that's an that's a technique, orange zone. In a symphony concert, you've got an hour and a half music, and you've probably got three hours of rehearsal, and you've got to run through the pieces, which everybody knows, have played hundreds of times and just make sure all the bits go right and the and I think that perhaps NEOs technique for doing that wasn't anything like as good as his technique for conducting a session you know, just to get back sessions meet getting the music right was of course only half the job. Once you play through the music and got some idea of the musical difficulty thing sorted out a few notes for the players and the composer who was of course there\n\nthen started to record each of the separate pieces and these of course you do call to picture the orchestra was seated behind a large screen if I take typical studio like the Denon one large screen high up on the wall behind the players who are on stages and the conductor is therefore facing the screen the recording box adenomas at right at the back and some seats in the body of the hall for directors and producers and hangers on in general who you know could listen to what was going on and once the music could be once you started to read to to record each of the individual pieces then of course you have to start looking at the picture and hear a whole new set of difficulties came in because even if the composer had got it absolutely right it may not have been always easy to manage the horn God coming just as the door opened and all the points which the composer had met perhaps made in the score is not at all an easy job to conducted in such a way that it actually sounds like music and doesn't sound like a wonderful thing that beats time You know? So you've got to I mean, it's a great gift Do you got a great gift to knife no monitor WMC brilliant It was one of the markers was another john Hines was there No, they were all of the brilliant and I'm sure there are others. I can attest to Marcus actually.\n\nUnknown Speaker 28:28\n\nHowever carefully you spot these things. Yes. You know, there was one particular sync point absolutely vital that the orchestra is coming in too soon. Yes. And after about the fourth taking I said Marcus, just drag we got away with it. Yes. You guys started very Draggy. Yes. Slow down. Extended one.\n\nEdward Williams 28:50\n\nYes. I've got got that make sense? Yes. Absolutely. Absolutely. And the ability which mirrors that which Marcus certainly had in Danville certainly had of just being able to make a quick alterations of ours, just use it, I will. Alright, but our number five we are just when we play that's two beats and then you know, and or play that 234 miles, something like that will make all the decision make the whole thing fit in that. And you've there you've got if you're running a session, you've got to manage your your orchestra to start because you've got to manage your producer who's sitting there or director sitting there ready to complain bitterly? Not not right. You've got the editor who's if everybody else is happy, the editor certainly won't be able to say oh, well I can't video that and then you've got the record is to has to be supervised to see that the music that the result on the recording is what you want. And really, you've got the composer who's sitting there shivering a in case it's his mistakes, make it sound so awful, and be in any case, it doesn't sound like what he wanted or doesn't happen. All right. So there are a number of people out there only to really to complain bitterly about what's happening. And the money being spent at a huge rate is Time flies back there. It was brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. And the number of sessions which I've been at which 10, of which 10 minutes before the end, you could be absolutely certain was gonna get done in time would have to be another session. It'd be immensely expensive. Oh, man. And just as the clock went up 60 minutes. I mean, three hours. Ray, we've done it. Brilliant.\n\nUnknown Speaker 30:31\n\nBut I think what you were saying about his entrepreneurial talents, is very valid. I mean, I was only listening to a Walters first the other day, which I think was written in 1935 36. That's right. Yes. Brilliant recordings by Rachael on the Birmingham. Yes. And there you have the the charge of the French cavalry\n\nEdward Williams 30:54\n\ncoming up. Yes. Yes. Yes, that's right. Yes. Not\n\nUnknown Speaker 30:57\n\nyesterday's office. No, no, no, nothing exciting ideas. Yes. And of course, I although I think it was only serving was involved in sculpting the Antarctic.\n\nEdward Williams 31:05\n\nIt was usage on Symphony or\n\nUnknown Speaker 31:07\n\nAntarctica.\n\nEdward Williams 31:10\n\nThat's right. Yes. Yes.\n\nI mean, there was\n\na tremendous amount of good music has sort of come out of that thing. I mean, the one that I'd like to most dimension perhaps is Bill Irwin, who is really a, an extremely distinguished British composer not not yet getting anything like his do is go to Marvis complex a really, really good composer. I mean,\n\nUnknown Speaker 31:36\n\nis written\n\nEdward Williams 31:39\n\na huge amount of beautiful music on his own. Right. Not that I've heard a lot of it because a lot of it's lovely to just beginning to be recorded. No, but there is. And he had a he had an amazing gift.\n\nUnknown Speaker 31:51\n\nIt's almost a symbiotic relationship.\n\nUnknown Speaker 31:53\n\nYes, yes. I\n\nUnknown Speaker 31:55\n\nmean, I, I don't know what you feel like it now. But I think there's a tremendous symbiotic relationship between Michael Noma and Peter Greenaway stuff. Yes, you may hate it. No, I\n\nEdward Williams 32:03\n\nhave. To me, yes, that works together here. I find Well, I to be perfectly honest, the first film piece of his that I heard was the piano. And I thought it was brilliant. I was really brilliant. I thought it was a, it was a marvellous balance between being his own music quite diff definitely his own music and yet could quite possibly have been written in, you know, the mid 19th century, I thought was really extraordinary. A good act, any aggression, he was Well, not really\n\nUnknown Speaker 32:43\n\ntalking about other people who need assistance\n\nEdward Williams 32:50\n\nand I suppose the one that comes to mind Most of all, simply because it shows the kind of organisation which ultimately finds himself heading was taking on a young man then called john hunky, who's now a very well known as a as a lecturer who wrote a standard book on film music. And who know lectures widely on on railways and other subjects, which which particularly interest here, but mere took him on, as far as I remember, as in charge of sort of general publicity for for the music department, because he'd obviously written articles about various composers working in films and that kind of thing. And obviously, it was felt that we did enough work to justify even you know, that, that kind of taking on that kind of work as well. And john worked in the in our main offices in Indiana.\n\nUnknown Speaker 33:56\n\nBecause he was a great sound expert as well.\n\nEdward Williams 33:58\n\nNot necessarily music once he I forgotten that is he Yes, he\n\nUnknown Speaker 34:01\n\nwas a sound technician, I believe on 100 patients.\n\nUnknown Speaker 34:04\n\nOh, was he? I\n\nEdward Williams 34:05\n\ndidn't know that. How interesting. I did. Yes, I\n\nUnknown Speaker 34:08\n\nwent to one of these BFA summer film school. Yes. Yes. And that's where I got to know him and we played this standard clip, you know, the\n\nUnknown Speaker 34:20\n\nYes, yes.\n\nEdward Williams 34:23\n\nYes, yes. Yeah.\n\nUnknown Speaker 34:25\n\nBut building it up.\n\nEdward Williams 34:28\n\nSo how interesting is that, you know, yeah. How I wish I know that. We used to live quite close to each other and we both my parents used to queue and he'd lift also queue I think, and I used to see him occasionally that way. Anyhow, I digress. Well, not. I seem to have talked about most of the things I thought I ought to talk about. The other thing that I think that's worth mentioning I have talked about me and his his great skill of doing recordings for films. But I think I would also just mention the other thing so which he really must take a good deal of credit. I don't know whether his idea but I suspect it might have been to commission Benjamin Britten to write the, the instruments of the orchestra. It's called now I think the child's guide, because the instruments, the Oxford young persons guide, when I think we had had that idea, and it was commissioned and and had been recorded, before I went back to him that said before 1946, before I got back to the nine foot six theory, but me always in great demand for doing that at concerts, so and he liked the projects introduce us to like, connecting your expertise. So he used to do conduct in concert on Saturday mornings. And other times he used to conduct concerts, which had one or two film pieces, perhaps a Walton piece, and, you know, the child's guide and literature and a symphony or something like that. And it was, it was a good draw, and orchestras, like doing it, and it was good for your got his concept. Got some constant giving in and the officers of course, confirmed their relationship with him in a sense, you know, and that was good. And that leads me on to say that, of course, the one of the things which I wish I could convey better than I think I probably can is the very nice atmosphere, despite the stress of, of recording and, of course, have left out perhaps the most single greatest cause of stress, which come in recordings, which is that once you have got the notes, right, the thing being played in synced to the film, right? To record is happy and all recordings unity working, then the horn, or the oboe, or somebody starts to make those tiny mistakes, which mean, you got to stop doing it again. So you'll find yourself going on to take 13 take 14 take 2627 you know, because by the time we got there, everybody's making mistakes. No, it's also nervous, you know, particularly, of course, wretched horn players and trumpeters who are so exposed that you know that there's any stress everywhere bound to make mistakes. So I mean, it was a really hair raising process. But of course, going through all that together, does lead to great sort of camaraderie and pleasure. And I think of my times, either spent, as it were, as the tea party with with with muira, one of the others, or Goodman, I myself started writing musical films and the pleasure one gets out of relationships. Rather brutal things which occasionally happen. I mean, I suspect it's apocryphal and I don't suppose it really happened. But jack Thurston the famous granite is famous for having been asked by some conducted assertion was who tried this way, jack, he said, I tried Taiwan's jack. He is famous for having said try anything once except insist in folk dancing. Maybe that's impossible. And I can remember something else, which I wish is typical of the sort of session humour, if you like. One of the London Symphony Orchestra was run as mostly as Augustus were those days back committee and then the chairman of the committee was Gordon Walker, the principal flute, man in his 60s, and perhaps towards the end of his great, marvellous, interesting man, and his son Eddie was second flute and took over the gems with Yorkshire, I think after COVID anyhow, it was Gordon's birthday, one day, he renews his birthday. And Bill when they've got on his birth into a session with music by belonging to a building, who himself was a flute player, had actually been an orchestral flute.\n\nHe wrote a special I'm sure you remember, that drama that we used to call session sections, m one, m two, and you could buy the real number. So reel three, first music would be three m one and real five m 10, ordered by D. So you had a number for the real number, letter M and then the number of the section of the thing. So Bill, all when wrote a seven m five a real read wasn't in the form at all. It was an absolutely horrific piece of flute, virtuoso music really making every conceivable demand thing and this was inserted in the middle of the First Fleet. partner. So at this point in the session, I said, seven m 13. a, you know, and everybody rustle their papers because the joke, you know, but because they lifted up their instruments, I think, and we said Don't you know, and God woke up he didn't he played it right through this. Nobody else made a sound good right so absolutely no perfect for begin to say you've got a great cheer for that. Well, I think that's probably brings me on to the to the point at which finally Mia very kindly gave me the well deserved sack. I think he said good I you know, I'm saying you're not much good to me, you I think you better get some music education really. And I suppose if life had been what it is supposed to be or ought to be or something, I could then should then have gone through college and had a sort of five years musical education I was then what we'll do is bozos 26, or 27.\n\nAnd he said, Well, what if Why don't you get three lessons in composition? And we'll give you some lessons. Because obviously, I knew blogging very well as a friend and and I admired him very much. So I asked him if he'd give me some lessons, I have to just mention that I had, I suppose given below in some of the worst moments he'd ever had in his life. I'm sure Ronnie, I'd have to tell you, but the score and parts are the score of a feature film where we talk about what to nine and a half music projects, how many reels 10 reels or something Yes, 10 reels, but eight to nine cues per reel, you know, score of that size. So the score of a feature represented what two months work I should think. And with some powerful this size, and I had an open topped Elvis which I drove about in I'm getting ready to fall down and I put build score, parts of the score isn't healthy in the back of my car in order to drive from denim to London, where we're going to do it often London denim again, remember when I got there wasn't there? Naturally, I mean, everybody knew that and it was most awful thing to ever happen to me because imagine having to do all that all over again two months work, you know, what would you luckily somebody picked it up and returned it to us. But I didn't I thought would be very kind to to forgive me for that.\n\nEdward Williams 0:02\n\nWe do talk about\n\nRodney Giesler 0:07\n\nEdward Williams reel 2\n\nEdward Williams 0:14\n\nafter that dreadful story back below wins score wg he could have forgiven me for that. David, soon after this cough said to me very kindly and not in the least not least in anger said, I really don't think you might choose to run through the it said that. But I mean, he made the perfect bed, as I knew very well, I wasn't actually can go and do all sorts of things which, which I really wish he could do with I could not compare the piano, you know, and it was he needed people who had all those musical skills with them. And I really was the least effective all those people. So he said, Well, why don't you go and get some musical education, my goodness and competition. And in fact, I arranged to have tourists because I love being admired immensely is not only good enough, just to you and also about himself in the right plant, he also translated French poetry. Very beautiful book of translations, and poetry. I'm looking man good guns. And he gave me two competition lessons, which consisted of him\n\nUnknown Speaker 1:35\n\nsitting\n\nEdward Williams 1:36\n\nbeside me on the counter and Israel in the right category. I'm playing the Beatles now isn't saying, This is not beautiful? Oh, it's not beautiful.\n\nAnd he was dead, right? It was the best grinders on this list. And shortly after that, an old friend who has a PhD in history before LAN OCO, who by this time worked for Shell for me, asked me to write some music for a film that he is making in a series called how the aeroplane flies. And the one that you want me to drag this for was a couple of his decisions, it was, as part one or two or three, and part three, I say, but I can't really remember. But three thrust, how the aeroplane flies, Part Three thrust. And so I was launched onto a career of writing music, or films. I didn't have to do this before. Before the war, I didn't even need a visit as a, as a schoolboy and, and undergraduate, I hadn't written much during the war. And I hadn't written much when I came back and work from here, but it was always really the thing, I suppose I wanted to do most of all. And here, I was asked to do. So luckily, that was thought to be reasonably successful. And then I got another job and didn't my father's gratification, I find myself able to earn a modest living doing that ever since. So I thought now, perhaps I might just talk a little bit about the whole background to my life, which was, of course, partly films, but it was also a documentary film segment. And the whole way in which my life worked, and where I lived. I'd never until I was 20. To 45, I left the Navy in 1946. I had never, except for I suppose the six months where I worked from your before actually being a free agent. I'd always either been at boarding schools or had been in the highly celibate Navy. And I mean, I was just ready to guard the time and have a good time, as they say, and of course, arrived back in London. 946 was absolutely. There was a vital and marvellous life going on. And for the next 15 years, I enjoyed it all more. I mean, it's 25 bucks, you know, I got as much as I wanted and had a marvellous time as well as working. First was worth describing the documentary, surroundings. I lived for most of that time. Although I suppose the first year that I worked from New I lived in Chelsea, but after that, I lived in Soho. I had a house and Dean Street, which I shared with an architect friend, and just around the corner from the Highlander, which was well known as a documentary pub. Expect to go in there and see George Lv and then Bessie bond and you know, the people who they knew well, Frank Sainsbury, john Taylor, all sorts of people in there, the dog and duck, which I used to go into a lot of time with my great friend, the film director. Micro law. Then there was the, the the winebar, and the Mandrake, and the gargoyle, and aerials, or the colony, Rome and the French BB and the Swiss BB, and you know, there was a, then there were all the Charlotte street partners. And then there were all the pubs under the DVC, which, you know, lunchtime, you'd expect to go and talk to such friends as you can find in the BBC, pubs in factories. And the French club, I'll be drawn, again, my person and I should have mentioned before another part of my education, from the time I got back after the war, was those marvellous shows that Oh, indrawn did it the scholar put on at the Scala on Sundays, once a month, I think probably in the winter season of The New London Film Society, where again, I saw, you know, all the films that I hadn't seen them before. And we're always here for interesting shorts. And when one large main feature, you know that some film that ought to be in everybody's background or thought at that day or every day. And that was a tremendous tension, a tremendous sort of idea. And I think once or twice, I helped organise, by arranging some music, on gramophone records, or something for silent films and that kind of thing. And, of course, I had a huge number of acquaintances and friends in the arts, who were milling around Soho, and in films and so on.\n\nThere were the various I mean, people overlapped a great deal. For example, john Taylor mcjrotc, alongside Donald Taylor, who used to run a company called strand films. I mean, whom I knew very well, and I didn't think I ever worked for him, but I knew very well not only because I would meet him in film occasions, but because we would see each other as a nightclub midnight, Donald seems do all these words sitting at the table in you know, the actual, you know, one of those cases, or one of those nightclubs, there would be Donald with two or three people in shirtsleeves. putting together some huge project or you know, and this was true of lots of people may I there was a very intense artistic life, which of course, including films going on. I had relate and I had one thread I knew about Green Park, where demand work for me became one of my brothers in law Ralph keen, was working making films he was working with Laurie Lee on physical sacrifices in Ireland and making various other films which I future my future I think john Dylan Thomas was certainly working down with my brother in law on on various films. JOHN Morton was working with john Multimap is working as a scriptwriter that we all used to see each other daily in the French pub in the street and occasionally have lunch that nice restaurant isn't on the first floor to the finished product when it was in it's that kind of heyday before Louis the waiter won the pools restaurant down because they couldn't find anybody else to do the waiting Augusto government shutdown anyhow. So that was that was really exciting and interesting. And at the same time, there were a large number of documentary companies making films. There was also of course, shell, who were the my friend Lando kills employers for this film. And shell worked on the principle that they would they had a consultant, who in this case, I think at that time was Arthur Elton to produce their film saw them from outside and they themselves had a unit, which, whose members they employed. But working to Elton and I wrote the music for that film. My friend Michael law, then quite soon after that asked me to write a musical on that he'd made called What a life made by Richard massingham. A company now it's under was it what the company was called? Because the company owned by Richard massingham, a very enjoyable film comic. Who is the son one of the sons I think of hw massino was the guardian. But Richard was most amusing and he was a doctor, of course, he was actually and wrote to me and made the film. Tell me if it hurts about dentistry in 31st comedy, I think, well, like it made this film for the interests of this set. COI or mo I can't recall the central office information or the Ministry of Information, which was just after all 47 48 million This was and it was to try and joke people out of being so miserable. Everybody's very gloomy rationing was still going on and everything seemed absolutely awful. And people were getting around in a sort of mist of gloom in the car I thought they could do it being cheered up. Then my macro made a very enjoyable film called, what a life ending up with some miserable, miserable comic, Richard masterman escape throwing yourself off South NPR and even though it's no good, because because the water wasn't deep enough to lead in a puddle, that sort of any height caused a sensation because one of the London papers took it up and said, how do they spend our money on this nonsense, you know, and so the tackler cinematic showed it so Mikey was telling me now that they've showed it with a poster outside is this film with 6000 pounds of your own money. So that was right. And that went on, I did a lot of work for for Shell, from then onwards. I mean, they had a stable of directors did lots of very interesting things. I was allowed to do all sorts of mild experiments which are included just you know, to me. I started doing improvised music to films is improvised interesting improvisation in a particular\n\nstyle. It was a jazz, West Indian music style, because I knew a whole lot with the new musicians. And I can remember being confronted with some great air display showing off warplanes flying around the sky, they always used to Michelle always used to make a review every year of the fan ratio. And really, there's not much you can do about that this guy. So we thought we'd have a good but improvising score, it worked beautifully. For the musicians looked at the screen and they've played whatever came into their heads. And then they did it again. And by the time they don't third time, we found that by just sort of sinking the film up to a few seconds ahead of what they had actually played it out you know getting into work. And I also did a sync score for my friend Sarah rockers film called New detergents, I think which was a film about the whole business of the history of soap and washing and the development of the new detergents from from oil derivatives.\n\nUnknown Speaker 12:45\n\nAdjust or ongoing Mason's media media\n\nEdward Williams 12:50\n\njust for us to know I don't know I did a hell of a lot for to build a lot of I don't think I Oh, yes, I\n\nUnknown Speaker 12:56\n\nthink I did that.\n\nEdward Williams 13:04\n\nI depressed. I mean, I did do. I did do some adjust school for him for whatever. But God knows that I don't honestly can't remember. I did. It was what it may have been. I'm multimedia. It's so familiar. But then I won't be familiar with the title. In any case. I did a whole lot of of music for Mason's history of motor racing, and love the history of the motorcar, which again, two feet outside the museum for using my mother in law. Jody Pepin, who is 1/3 of piano duties to piano players, Julian Jody may begin to play the music.\n\nUnknown Speaker 13:50\n\nSchool, that lovely little journey into spring.\n\nEdward Williams 13:53\n\nThat's right. Yes. Well, that was the that was another departure. I can't remember what what the first film I did for them was public transport commission was another of my principal implies an immense amount of commissions from them. I think I think I did $27 to them or something like that. I got John's headshots list here of all those songs\n\nUnknown Speaker 14:13\n\nthat Phil really thought\n\nEdward Williams 14:15\n\nwas burdened by Steve Nash. Like that's right. Yes.\n\nUnknown Speaker 14:19\n\nHave you?\n\nEdward Williams 14:20\n\nOh, that's lovely. Yes, that's right. That's funny. You have got a good memory for that.\n\nUnknown Speaker 14:30\n\nYes.\n\nEdward Williams 14:31\n\nCan you Yes.\n\nUnknown Speaker 14:33\n\nThe five of the modal nouns\n\nEdward Williams 14:35\n\nthat Yes. That's that.\n\nUnknown Speaker 14:37\n\nTerrific.\n\nEdward Williams 14:39\n\nWell, that was that that was very, not to read is the right word. It was\n\nUnknown Speaker 14:45\n\nroughly divided.\n\nEdward Williams 14:48\n\nhad married my sister who I talked to a few years before I think. And so I got to know him. I got David any case because you I had all sorts of other connections with you. Like he had been at Ralph and being a gallery, he had worked as an art dealer for Freddie Mac them air galleries. He knew a lot about painting. He was a great friend of Matthew Smith whom for some reason I also knew at that time and I also had some connection with Augustus john and because at that time I was married to one of Augustus John's daughters. And so we had all sorts of connections outside film. I got to know bunny Greg both on the seasons and I suppose he must have had enough confidence in me to to suggest to add grants to transfer commission you guys should immediately shop and you know, he got here to be as director This is great credit turnout for the book so to speak for trained all those rules is that we got on very well together and, and but I think I was always a little bit uncomfortable practising here as mine is good. It's it's I'd worked for him and he knew what how incompetent I was. You didn't know I'd come to work. So I always actually said he said, okay, working with Marcus Marcus Dodds was my great friend. And in fact, he and I had sung together in the same vocal group at rugby. And he was a couple of years years old, as I say, he was a bass and I was the treble, you know. And we had seen matches as sort of a visit to Cambridge, where he sang on the kingsguard I think the Trinity. And but then, after the war, he came and he really conducted practically everything for me, I didn't do it, I dedicated myself but after that journey, it's been Marcus did everything. And he, as soon as it was lovely ended, I can never get tired of seeing it. I don't mean just the music's marvellous. But, but it's mostly that's that beautiful commentary and a beautiful way in which the whole thing is thought about. One of the other things which I am thinking about this interview, I've made some notes about things to be commented on. And one of them is the way that the way that's gone now, I recently, as I said, might record television, and it's very difficult to get them to take the idea of words and music having any thought about relationships. I mean, they just smack it on without the warfare. But that's absolutely right. And people through my admiration, that it's very difficult to get them to, to put the work into that which we used to put into in those places, and which paid off. And, as you say, Johnny, and spring has got to really, you know, dread the shows as the the way the words and the music and the effects and all those things work together. And\n\nUnknown Speaker 17:44\n\nyou're talking about putting the work into it from a musical point of view. I'm thinking about the work needed to put into an edited sequence of a film. explain something? Yes.\n\nUnknown Speaker 17:55\n\nYes. Yesterday's.\n\nUnknown Speaker 17:56\n\nYou haven't got the time. You have a presenter? Yes. Yes, machine. Yes. In the old days, we would spend the morning with the machines. This is a slow job. It takes ages the widgets from that's also saying, This is our latest machine. Very clever, and it makes cloth much quicker. Yes, big deal.\n\nUnknown Speaker 18:22\n\nYou're quite right.\n\nUnknown Speaker 18:24\n\nAnyone can squirt a video camera now? Yes, yes. And the buyers? pocket? Yes.\n\nEdward Williams 18:29\n\nThat's quite run the whole thing.\n\nUnknown Speaker 18:31\n\nAnd then it's forgotten about all the time. The chairman shows it to the shareholders meeting. And it is crap. Yes. Whereas we're still talking about j at a spring channel more often. Yes, yes. Yes. And I believe it's still in the lending library. Is it? Yes, yes. For as long as the rails got a lot. Yes. Yes. Certainly at the National Film Archive.\n\nEdward Williams 18:52\n\nYeah. Anyway, what it was an interesting see that I did, I'm sure you went to it, because you got to it because it was different. I was. I didn't know.\n\nUnknown Speaker 19:05\n\nBut I never actually worked directly with him.\n\nEdward Williams 19:06\n\nWell, that wasn't his birthday. But somebody put together a celebration of his 80th birthday. At the National Film Theatre on campus, I think, shed love for these films. But Edgar made a beautiful speech, saying they were talking about the mid 80s, late 60s. I don't it wasn't it wasn't all that long ago. He made love these beats saying, Well, I suppose one day, the idea of public service will come back again. And we should all be able to think about what I mean. The transport commission for me the whole idea that transfers\n\nthe whole idea behind nationalising all those things, doesn't matter whether it was successful, you will redo it or do it better or you know, I'm not saying these have to be kept because because they were a good idea to start with. But nonetheless, it was based on an idea about public service which keeps people so just a bit outside. So that is I didn't work for money. Of course, I worked for money, but I also that nice feeling that one was doing something quite interesting, too useful for the public as well for people. And that's, of course, what Edgar brought to that. That's your niche. And it was, it was really marvellous place to work. They got got Grissom? Yeah, it still. Absolutely.\n\nUnknown Speaker 20:24\n\nI mean, there were these giants in the 30s and 20s. Yeah. That mess the development of the media at that time with that philosophy? Absolutely. Yes.\n\nEdward Williams 20:39\n\nIt's perhaps worth saying that most of many documentary filmmakers were motivated by the idea that by trying to tell the truth, the imaginative truth about things was a good way of being useful to society and people like head grants did Arthur Elson back? That's right, and of course, and the other people who stood they basically, were highly motivated in this way. And in fact, the whole idea of public service. Of course, they had, they had motives in the sense they wanted to give the the organisation they work for a good name. And I'm not saying it was all whiter than white. But on the whole, a good deal of public good was done by this means shell, for example,\n\nthought it their business I think to make the thing that was best for them was to make interesting\n\nfilms, but interesting subjects, which never ever mentioned, shell petrol or any of those things, it only said at the end that it was a shell film. And he'd got people together to look at these films or discuss the issues in them and people. This was good for their name, but it was also good for society as a whole. And of course, it was also true about the transport commission. Of course, the film we've just started talking about a journey into spring was made because, of course to sell railway tickets, bus tickets, in the sense people wanted to inform people that at the end of the railway line not far away the end of the bus line there were actually interesting. That was an interesting Natural History clouds birds greeters to,\n\nto see and and it is part of public education in a sense. This year is the one we're talking about. I mean, the journey to spring\n\nwas the first of a series of films, which I think they were for the transport commission but he did under produced bed grounds the one called between the tides, which I'll talk about a little bit later, one about winter, I think no one about Scotland. That's right. But Scottish natural history in the last one, which my brother in law Ralph keen started but died before it got started shooting and john Taylor finished or shot and finished was The film called Wild Wings about the Peter Scott Slimbridge. Peter Scott of the Slimbridge wildfowl trust which actually won an Oscar, I'm proud to say not for the film. That Betty Katie has got it. That's right. Yes, that's right. I had actually done a film before I think journey into spring for that I'd done done several films I think before genuine does bring genuine spring was nice to me because I said, my brother, you know, made it and obviously I was anxious to please Him. He was good he older than I wasn't and and had made a number of very fine films, Cypress is an island and and beads and various other quite well known documentaries. And obviously, I was anxious to, to do a Brad so to speak. And it was, as I said, the first time it's conducted by my old boss, Neil Matheson. So obviously, I was anxious that he, he should think well of me. And all together. It is very exciting. And that was good. I'd already done one or two films. I think before that for cars for question. One I remember Best of all, was the film called train time or not, is one of the things I remember this was a film called train time with john Sherman made, which was a film, a survey of 24 hours of train planning really, how you get all the good strengths in the right place and the person is going on the right line, all the sorts of things that go behind running a successful train service, dreadful thing to think about, nowadays. sad, sad to think about, but anyhow, I thought that's the Mamba suit myself. I really loved it. I loved making the music for it. And I've got a copy of it, which I look at every now and I do I think perhaps later than that to dr. john Krish, on a film called The elephant, we'll never forget about the last tram, which we use some a nice Victorian musical. I suppose it was a good musical song. sitting on top of a tram, I think it was called, with Archie, How did he know the players theatre theatre seed, and that through lots of fun and interesting things to do with that, and I really greatly enjoyed working for\n\nUnknown Speaker 25:28\n\nit got that unit.\n\nUnknown Speaker 25:34\n\nOne thing I think you were mentioning in these indirect sponsorship, if you like, the product of so that the story was told, that implied that the sponsor made these products. I think it paid off in terms of audience exposure to them, because by and large, what always audiences are uncommitted. And if you just thrown petrol pumps at them, and petrol prices, and everything else, they would have switched off, because you're telling a story about how oil is formed and how it comes out of the ground. And there's a certain adventure that you are immediately engaging interests from an otherwise uncommitted audience. Yes. So is the film had a much better chance of doing its job? Yes. And I know what I went on to make films of similar calibre when I calculated with foreign sponsors, big industrial companies in Germany a whole lot. I would show a short film. And I think it was the Elson formula. The war times. You mentioned the sponsors name of the track. You are seeing evaluate the effect. Yes, yes.\n\nUnknown Speaker 26:46\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nUnknown Speaker 26:46\n\nAnd so I think the first film I made was an after debate for them. Very high budget of 40,000 pounds to help mentioned the sponsors name one. Credit, I believe in it, and it was a very successful,\n\nEdward Williams 26:59\n\nyes. Yeah. So I'm sure you're right. I mean, I can be immensely impressed by the subjects that shell were prepared to take on. Sara doing a film about Indian dancing and the idea of chair bulges in in High Wycombe, and all sorts of interesting subjects, which they thought it was worthwhile making an interesting film about. And then, of course, they made motoring subjects as well. I did the whole series of films about motor racing for Bill Mason. I don't remember. Endless fanfares for somebody winning a race. I mean, I read really almost ran out of my equipment for making the noise. But it was they were fun to do. And then, of course, those companies and those people got taken on to do things for United Nations like like Michael Clark's film,\n\nUnknown Speaker 27:52\n\nfeast or famine.\n\nEdward Williams 27:53\n\nIt's not feast, or famine, food or food or famine. That's right, which is I must say, I felt very honoured to be able to do a film trying to talk about the problems of growing food for to feed people of the world. And also doing for them off the shelves on the shelves, all species that say a film about your hearts. Yeah. All sorts of interesting subjects again, with the idea of of joining the public's attention to interesting subjects without necessarily banging away at at Shell's own product, so to speak. Perhaps just mentioned as one other subject which transport commission were involved within which which I enjoyed very much. They made at least two probably more films on the subject of waterways, which of course resorts or commission were responsible as well as everything other form of transport. And as a result of which I had a very enjoyable trip on the canal with rod Baxter and I suppose Kate Baxter and certainly Katie Marshall, who is the editor of that those films and I managed to track down an old chap who retired from I'd heard it I heard about him, somewhere on the on the grand union. Somebody said, Oh, this is Chuck, you're good to hear him. He's got a lot of canal songs. And I did track him down to a flat in Ealing where he'd retired. And he had got a repertoire of songs. Most of them are musical called musical songs, which are particularly interesting at that time, but he had got to up to the splendid canal songs. One of them a ballad called on grindlays Bank, I think, which was about a murder which had taken place on Bradley's bank On a pickfords fly boat. And at that time pickfords actually ran fly boats, fast boats carrying whatever it was, you know, packages won't go up and down the canals is a very good song and I used it. And another song he sang as the basis of the music for a film called I think the waterways of Britain it might have been called or it might have been called, they're good but it's I can't now remember because there were two of them, one of you tried to scrape some eventually for the other, which I used a lot of this, I used these two songs particularly and that that person is going to later my own interest in focusing. My father is I think I mentioned before he had an interest in football as you can. And I find myself very much interested in it. And educated in it by Bert Lloyd Lloyd direct focus on scholar who was one of the Inspire as of the first song revival of the 50s and 60s, and who was kind enough to collaborate with me on several occasions in over music fulfilment seem to require that kind of thing. Another interesting thing that I think Mike must, I must mention is that some of the ones I had started writing music for films and obviously, I've worked for anybody who could teach me writing i'd disagree in principle with something that the film itself who was saying. And I find myself writing quite a lot of films to shell music, for example, the history of the helicopters, air rock is really about that and remembering that great pleasure and all sorts of other films made by various directors beated nondual. Bill Mason's remembering the love of motor racing films of yo"
