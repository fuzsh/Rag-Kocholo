        "text": "A property management brand describing itself as a 'soft developer,' focused on 20-minute neighborhoods in livable cities, is taking a major step to empower a key soft asset ‚Äî its employees. Based in Setoda, Hiroshima, Staple Co., Ltd. recently announced the launch of Staple People's CO-OP, a hotel company owned, planned, managed and operated by its staff. All employees who have worked for Staple People's CO-OP for several years will be invited to become shareholders and participate in the company's management and profits. Another aim is to create a fluid organizational structure without stark divisions between departments, encouraging staff members to move between development, planning and operations. As Kanako Watanabe, General Manager of Staple's Hotel K5, explains: \"I believe that the hotels that will be needed in the future are those pursuing value rather than profit, with teams that can create movements rather than smash hits.\" With plans to run hotels across Japan, Staple People's CO-OP is kicking off in Okayama City, where it has taken over management of A-and-A, an existing boutique property.

One of things I love about this part of the world is people‚Äôs capacity to be pragmatic and to ignore Western convention. At face level, traffic in Ho Chi Minh City is as crazy as in any city you‚Äôve ever been - a reported 45 scooters for every car (we‚Äôve all seen the photos) - but here‚Äôs the thing: traffic ‚Äòflows‚Äô arguably better than in any other Developing World city. The Vietnamese, via a combination of common sense and affordability, have decided that it‚Äôs more efficient to get around on two wheels than on four. And because almost everyone is travelling on the same two wheels, a city‚Äôs arteries become fluid. The Vietnamese have zigged, when the rest of the world was zagging: two wheels, not four. So too with Parking. Who says that a vehicle must be parked on the street or in a designated parking lot? Why can‚Äôt it be parked in your front room - off the street - when the day is over and everyone‚Äôs asleep?? This is the same thinking that KERB is bringing to parking across the world. ‚ÄúLegacy systems work, so why would we change?‚Äù is a specious assumption. Everything KERB does, and every product feature we are building will challenge the ‚Äòstatus quo‚Äô of parking. The 20th Century saw the most important technological advances humans have ever lived through. But that period is over. We‚Äôre a quarter of the way through the 21st Century, yet the physical parking barriers and tin boxes and printed tickets remain. It‚Äôs time to re-think parking - just like the Vietnamese have done. We‚Äôre here to help you re-imagine your car park(s). More data, less friction. Higher customer satisfaction, for a lot less cost.

(*video got cutoff and I was too lazy to re-record) 1. Seasonality is no longer a thing in much of Europe. Airports and cities were packed. It was like August in October. 2. More people have returned to the office in parts of Europe vs North America. Trams in Prague were packed and startups are having trouble finding office space. 3. Smaller boutique properties in EU are overly reliant on Booking.com, more than other OTAs like Expedia and Airbnb. This from a couple conversations with property owners. It makes sense given Booking‚Äôs EU roots and provides perspective on why EU is pushing back on eTraveli acquisition.\n\nThis morning, while running, I remembered a tool I would use on trips to China: Counting the steps. My run was hilly and I was calculating how many up and down hills I had before I finished (7). After each hill, I would track how many I had left until finally I was down to 1. 15 years ago, I did the same thing but in a much different environment. At that time, I had the opportunity to go back and forth to China constantly for about a year. Often traveling alone, and always being an overpacker (one day, really, one day I will get a grip in this space), I needed to get to LAX, to Hong Kong airport, and finally to the Shangri-La Hotel in Shenzhen. From there a factory representative would pick me up and take me to Dongguan. And then a week (or several) later, do the same trip in reverse (plus a short stay in Hong Kong!). As I recall, the trip from the airport to Shenzhen to Dongguan took hours and there were different modes of transportation required at different points. After a 15 hour flight, this additional travel felt daunting. SO! When starting out on my travel, I would break down the entire trip into 'steps' (13 if memory serves). The steps were deliberately small, specific milestones of the trip after which a new segment would begin. Throughout my journey, I was only focused on completing the immediate 'step'. Somewhere around the middle, I would add into my focus looking back at steps accomplished for further motivation. Inevitably, the final step of the trip would come and I could finally relax. This step counting stuff is hugely helpful. A tried and true technique for tackling large, long-term or highly stressful projects. Step by step-- you do get to where you want to go. And I had completely forgot about using it on long journeys as well until this run! #ProjectManagement #Operations #Production #NewProductDevelopment #GoalSetting Thoughts?"
