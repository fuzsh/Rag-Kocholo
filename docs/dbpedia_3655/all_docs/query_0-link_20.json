ALICOATE Secretary and Business Manager 71 WEST FORTY-FOURTH STREET NEW YORK, N. Y. 6411 HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD HOLLYWOOD, CAL. The Year Book T T EREAFTER will be issued on Jan- uary 1 of each year. Previously this volume was issued in September, because the booking of pictures was con- strued as the beginning of the year in this industry. But inasmuch as records of all kinds, including Government statistics, are recorded as from January 1 of each year, subsequent issues will be prepared on this basis. In the effort to bridge the gap from September to January, the present issue contains statistical data to October 1, 1921. Play Goldwyn ! RUPERT HUCHES Goldwyn Pictures have been the choice of discriminat- ing exhibitors. In the season which ended in September, 1921, Gold- wyn had achieved many outstanding successes — \"MadameX,\" ''Earth- bound,\" \"The Branding Iron,\" \"North Wind's Malice,\" \"HoldYour Horses,\" \"Scratch My Back.\" This season we have \"The Old Nest,\" \"Dangerous Curve Ahead\" \"The Man from Lost River,\" \"Pov- erty of Riches,'' \"Doub- ling For Romeo,\" and many others. Goldwyn 's standard of pro- ductions is high, Gold- wyn's box office triumphs are many.

OUT of ten productions made by Marshall Neilan in the past three years, nine have been tre- mendous box-office successes. In direct competition with the greatest aggregations of producing brains that money can command, Mr. Neilan, with limited financing and studio facilities, has hit the bull's eye nine times out of a possible ten. Through this remarkable ability to deliver to exhibit- ors (not legitimate theatres) pictures that so con- sistently show a large profit on their books, he has achieved the good will of theatre owners throughout the country to a degree duplicated by few, if any, other producers today. \"Dinty,\" \"The River's End,\" \"Go and Get It,\" \"Bob Hampton of Placer\" and other Neilan pictures that have broken records in all first run cities, are still eagerly booked by exhibitors in the smaller commun- ities. \"Bits of Life\" and \"Penrod\" are the two latest exam- ples that forcefully drive home the unusual consist- ency of the tremendous box-office power of this product.

High Quality and Thoroughness Are the Requisites for Making Perfect Pictures. The Robert Brunton Studios have an equipment and organiza- tion and a service that enable them -to guarantee to producers that type of picture. When Rudyard Kipling consented to the screening of his East Indian classics, he first thought India was the only place they could be produced — but Paul Brunet, conversant with the high quality of production at this plant, convinced the noted author that the Brunton Studios could reproduce East Indian atmo- sphere— accurate in every way. Here is Mr. Kipling's estimate of scenes of his story, \"Without Benefit of Clergy,\" screened at the Brunton Studios: \"THEY ARE SUPERB AND MORE CORRECT IN IMPRESSION OF DETAIL THAN I COULD HAVE IMAGINED.\" Two other notable and successful pictures of the year are Mary Pickiord's \"Little Lord Fauntleroy\" and Douglas Fairbanks' \"Three Musketeers\" — both produced with the aid of Brunton Service. Other famous producers and stars who have taken advantage of the un- equalled rental facilities of this plant during the past year are: B. B. Hampton Productions, Dial Film Company, J. L. Frothingham, Pathe, Buster Keaton, Emerson-Loos, Peck's Bad Boy Company, David Butler, Syd Franklin, Cosmopolitan Pictures, Ruth Roland. Charles Hutch- ison, R. A. Walsh. Louis Selznick Companies.

The master hand of a most efficient director is seen through- out the production.\" New York Dramatic Mirror. \"This is a production which again proves emphatically that a real di- rector can make a very entertaining production by injecting human touches and good close studies at the proper points.

The business depression, the result of the re- turn to normal conditions following the war pe- riod, finally hit this industry. And with this came a blow from which even the strongest of organ- izations recovered only after serious financial stress. This applied to every branch of the in- dustry. This was particularly true with exhibitors whose expansion had been so rapid and whose finances were spread so thin that it was with grave diffi- culty that some of them weathered the storm. In addition to this, general business conditions re- sulted in depression in various sections which at times reduced business to 40 and 50 per cent of normal, and it caused many houses to shut down completely from the early part of the summer until almost the beginning of this new season. With the advent of the new season, although business responded in some sections, it became ap- parent almost from the start that ordinary rou- tine made program pictures were scheduled to a disappointing gross. This because so many large, important, or spectacular productions were offered in the early part of the season that to feed the demands with unusual pictures became almost an impossibility. The much discussed \"fewer and better pictures\" failed again to\" materialize to an extent at least sufficient to justify. So much so has this been proven at this very early period of the new season that many exhibitors were planning the inauguration of unusual moves with ■which to attract their failing public. As a result, a number of stars not actually working made personal appearances and are scheduled to make more in an effort to bring back a cheerful box office condition. Victor Herbert and other well known composers and artists were also pressed into service in the desire to attain the same result. One of the outstanding developments of the year was the arrival in this country of several notable foreign productions. Of these \"Passion,\" \"Deception,\" \"Judgment\" and \"Theodora\" were the most conspicuous. There came also a flood of foreign made productions, the great percentage of which were utterly unfit to interest an American audience. At times it looked as though the \"for- eign invasion\" might prove important, but this rapidly faded away. In connection with the for- eign situation, it is of interest to note that Fa- mous Players extended its activities to make pro- ductions in England, Germany and France. In Germany, Adolph Zukor formed a strong organ- ization, taking away from the TJ. F. A. a number of its most important officials and directors, in- cluding Pola Negri and Ernst Lubitsch. Albert A. Kaufman was given charge of the German pro- ductions. Samuel Goldwyn engineered an inter- esting deal with Italian producers and Carl Laemmle of Universal made an extended trip for the purpose of investigating whether or not Uni- versal should go into the production field, espe- cially in Germany. As a result of this, it is quite likely that several productions will be made by Universal abroad. William Fox is also active in the foreign field and will make productions in Italy and England during the current year. It would take a prophet and a seer as well to anticipate the happenings of the coming year in the motion picture industry. It is a fact that pro- duction costs have been greatly reduced since this time a year ago. It is also a fact that more business-like methods are to be found in practi- cally every important organization. But at this writing general conditions are far from what they should be, so far as the exhibition field is con- cerned. A number of important exchange men and exhibitors are inclined to the view that before busi- ness resumes the healthy condition of 1916-1919, that lower admissions must come. . As an offset, there are a number who believe that this cannot be done because of overhead costs and incidentally argue that reduced admissions in themselves will not be sufficient. An authority in the trade pointed out to the writer that it was his belief that ths public had been fed upon too many big and im- portant pictures to ever allow them to be satis- fied with the average run of production and in that manner the public had been spoiled ; spoiled at least for the average picture entertainment which the usual company makes. He strengthened h argument by discussing the huge sum taken in the box office by the large and important pictures such as \"Way Down East,\" \"Over the Hill,\" et The tightening of finance, both East and Wes had its effect in a measure upon independent pr ductions. There were consequently less importan productions placed on the market than was to hav been expected from the indications of a year ago. Many important changes occurred in vario organizations during the year, most notable which was the control of Pathe Exchange secured by Paul Brunet and his associates. The control of this company had hitherto been held by the French parent organization. \"Al\" Lichtman re- signed as director of sales of Famous Players and was succeeded by Sidney R. Kent. Later he be- came general manager and director of sales of Associated Producers, and when that corporation merged with Associated First National Pictures, he remained in charge of the sales of Associated product. Felix Feist resigned as sales manager of Gold- wyn and was succeeded by A. S. Aronson. Feist joined the Joseph M. Schenck organization and was placed in entire charge of sales. F. B. War- ren, upon leaving Associated Producers, subse- quently formed the F. B. Warren Corporation, a distributing organization of which F. C. (\"Wid\") Gunning is treasurer and active head. Upon thi occasion Wid retired completely from this publi Cation. _ Arthur S. Friend resigned from Famous Player to become interested in several independent pro ducing organizations, and Charles R. Rogers, upon leaving Select, became sales manager of Robert son-Cole. George B. Van Cleve became gener manager and subsequently resigned that post wit Cosmopolitan. Arthur S. Kane added to his activi- ties by reorganizing Associated Exhibitors and tak- ing an mportant place in that organization. Th~ Stoll Film Company of England started a distrib- uting organization in the United States and sub- sequently closed it. The year was also marked by the first produc- tions of Hugo Ballin and by the appearance of Rudyard Kipling's work on the screen, \"Without Benefit of Clergy.\" Charlie Chaplin established a new high cash record of obtaining $800,000 from Associated First National for \"The Kid.\" \"Pas- sion,\" shown at the Capitol, established the high record of $100,000 during the first two weeks of its showing. Kessel and Baumann, partners for many years in various enterprises, came to a parting of the ways, and New York State was afflicted with a. Board of Censors. The year also marked the un- timely end of George Loane Tucker, producer of \"The Miracle Man.\" He died in June, to th~ regret of every lover of good pictures. The lab- oratory men in and around New York finally- straightened out their difficulties with George East- man of the Eastman Kodak Company and Jules E. Brulatour, and while there was talk of the- National Booking Company being revived, noth ing definite happened. Richard A. Rowland re- signed from the presidency of Metro, to becom effective around January 1st. The proposed Mo- tion Picture Day, suggested by Charles C. Petti- john, resulted in nothing. One of the memorabP events of the year, especially Wi New York, wa the holding of the first film golf tournament in the history of the industry, under the auspices o WID'S DAILY. And to make life cheerful, Sen- ator Myers of Montana filed a bill seeking an in vestigation of this industry because of its activi in politics. 68 The Days of '49 in California Moving Picture History Edward Muybridge Makes World's First Moving Pictures and Projects Them On a Screen Edward Muybridge, of California, was the first cinematographer to project moving pictures, his own, on a screen from revolving glass plates. That was in 1877. The world's first moving pictures for screen exhibitions were made in California by Mr. Muybridge in 1872. , After Muybridge showed the way, C. Francis Jenkins, of Washington, D. C, on June 6, 1894, gave the world's first projection of moving pictures from celluloid film on the wall of a jewelry store in Richmond, Indiana. On March 5, 1896, Thomas A. Edison agreed to manufacture the Jenkins machine with improvements made by Thomas Armat under the name of the Edison Vitascope. Muybridge, of California, invented the projection machine, Jenkins perfected it, and Thomas Edison first \"manufactured it in large numbers with added improvements of his own. Not only is California the center of the world's moving picture industry, the state where two-thirds of the world's pictures are made, but it was in California that the first moving pictures, made in California, were thrown upon a screen by a projection machine. The first moving pictures to be thrown upon a screen were made in the summer of 1877, on the Sacramento race track, in the presence of Governor Leland Stanford, by Edward Muybridge, an Englishman, living in California, and employed by the United States Government Geodetic Survey service. The pictures, which showed a white horse running against a specially constructed black fence as a background, were made by a battery of 24 cameras, placed in' a row, the shutters of which were operated by threads placed across the track at intervals and snapped by the horse as it galloped. The projection machine which threw these moving pictures on a screen was also invented, by Edward Muybridge. The world's first projection of moving pictures on a screen also took place in California, in a studio, the world's first moving picture studio, built by Governor Leland Stanford for Mr. Muybridge. This studio stood, until a few years ago, on the site of Governor Stanford's race- course at Palo Alto. California, where now stands Leland Stanford University. Previous to Edward Muybridge's invention of the \"Zoopraxoscope,\" which threw pictures on a screen by means of an oxy-acetylene light set up with a condensing lens, there were no projection machines. Muybridge's projection machine consisted of a large glass disk with reproductions of photographs set along its margin. Each photo- graph showed a slight progression in movement. Moving photographic prints had been shown, to one person at a time, in a stereo- scope or \"peep hole machine\" in 1860 by Dr. Lellers of Philadelphia, but it was Muybridge who first showed moving pictures to an audience of more than one person. Muybridge's first audience consisted of more than a hundred wealthy Californians: racing men who were invited to the world's moving picture premiere by Governor Leland Stanford. Before he showed his first moving pictures to the world's first moving picture audience, Muybridge obviated the blurring of his pictures when they were rapidly revolved before the lens by placing before the picture disc another metal disc. When the two discs were revolved in opposite directions, apertures in the metal disc coinciding with the glass disc's pictures completely gave the idea of motion by reason of the persistence of vision. Muybridge of California was the inventor of the modern projection machine. It remained for others to substitute a strip of film for the revolving glass disc and to per- fect Muybridge's primitive shutter. Several years later, \"the grandfather of moving pictures,\" on February 27, 1886, took his now perfected Zoopraxoscope to Thomas Edison, the inventor of the phonograph, and asked him if the Zoopraxoscope and the phonograph could not be synchronized so as to give the world its first \"talking pictures.\" Even in 1893, at the World's Fair in Chicago, Muybridge carried off the honors. Muybridge was able to project his pictures on a screen in Zoopraxical Hall. The best others could do was an improved \"Peep-Hole Machine\" which showed moving pictures on celluloid film, but which, nevertheless, could be seen by only one person at a time. It cannot be contested that Muybridge of California was the first maker of moving pictures to throw them upon a screen. Until Muybridge came only one person at a time could view the stereoscopic peep shows. Muybridge gave the world's first screen exhibi- tion to a number of persons. 69 SHELDON LEWIS Who returns to the screen as \"Jacques in D. W. Griffith's \"The Two Orphans 70 Muybridge's moving pictures and projection machine were awarded honors in France in 1881 when they were shown to a large group of foreign scientists in the laboratory of Dr. E. J. Marey. Upon Muybridge's return to America he was given a studio 120 feet in length by the University of Pennsylvania on what is now Hamilton Walk of the University of Pennsylvania campus. Muybridge also took the first instantaneous photographs in history. Many of them were made, to the astonishment of the world's photographers at that time, at an exposure of one six-thousandths part of a second. Even today there are few shutters which can equal the speed of the Muybridge shutter of 1882. Here are some of the earliest moving pictures made by Muybridge in California: \"Leland Stanford Athletes in Action.\" \"The Movements of the Raccoon.\" \"The Movements of the Baboon.\" \"The Ostrich Farms of California.\" \"The Movements of the Sloth.\" \"How a Hog's Back Wrinkles.\" \"The Beating of a Dog's Heart.\" In making \"The Beating of a Dog's Heart,\" Mr. Muybridge's camera was placed close to the chest of the animal, which had been anestheticized and cut open by Dr. Ed- ward Reichert. Muybridge was the first cinematographer to throw scientific pictures on a screen. To the Chicago World's Fair in 1893 Muybridge brought 20,000 original photographs on revolving glass plates and before tens of thousands of people during that summer projected his moving pictures of animal movements. Before special audiences of scientific men he showed views of persons afflicted with locomotor ataxia, lateral sclerosis and kindred diseases. Soon afterward Muybridge of California, then an octogenarian, died. He gave up more than twenty years of his life to advancing the science of moving pictures. He was the first man to make instantaneous photographs, the first to project moving pictures on a screen so that the idea of continuity of motion might be conveyed to the observer. True, the motion was crude, jerky and spasmodic — but so were moving pic- tures even as late as 1906. Muybridge began his work to prove to Governor Stanford that a racing horse going at a certain rate of speed was at successive points in his stride clear of support from the ground, but he finished by giving the world its first moving pictures on a screen. T. S. Tally, First Los Angeles Exhibitor Thomas S. Tally, the present owner of Tally's Broadway Theater, Los Angeles, was the first Los Angeles exhibitor. Early in April, 1897, eleven years before Col. Selig established the first producing studio in Los Angeles, and a few years after the death of Mr. Muybridge, Mr. Tally exhibited the first moving picture seen on the Pacific Coast. The picture was a 300-foot release, \"The Black Diamond Express.\" Mr. Tally exhib- ited it himself with an Edison Vitascope on a screen in the rear of his phonograph parlor which was then located at 311 South Spring Street. The projection was made through a tunnel of wood and black canvas which occupied the center of Mr. Tally's phonograph shop, which Mr. Tally did not wish to darken during the \"screening\" for fear that prospective talking machine purchasers might be frightened away. The picture was viewed from the rear of the shop, which had been made over into an auditorium with chairs for 300 people. \"In the Sultan's Power\" First Moving Picture Made in California The first moving picture scenes for a photo-drama to be filmed in California were made by Col. William N. Selig, of Chicago, who sent a company from the Windy City to Los Angeles early in 1908 to film the water scenes of \"The Count of Monte Cristo.\" The interiors of this picture were made in Chicago. The first moving picture to be filmed in its entirety in California was \"In the Sultan's Power,\" and this picture, too, was made by Col. Selig. Hobart Bosworth played the lead- ing role and Stella Adams, Frank Montgomery and Tom Santschi took important parts. Frank Boggs directed. Director Boggs, who some months later was killed by a Japanese religious fanatic, was accompanied west by James L. McGee, who is still with the Selig Company; by James Crosby, manager of the company; Harry Todd, for many subsequent years with Essanay; Gene Ward and Mrs. Boggs, who was known professionally as May Hosmer. \"In the Sultan's Power\" was made in the first Los Angeles studio, an old mansion at Eighth and Olive Streets. In the \"back yard\" of the old house interior sets were put up. No artificial light was employed, all interiors being filmed with sunlight. New York Motion Picture Company The New York Motion Picture Corp. was the next company to send a unit to the coast. This company reached Los Angeles the day after Thanksgiving, 1909. 71 TOD BROWNING'S MONEYMAKERS NO WOMAN KNOWS OUTSIDE THE LAW VIRGIN OF STAMBOUL PrOVen StlCCeSSeS Universal - Jewel Releases 72 The company was under the direction of Charles K. French. Fred Balshofer was Mr. French's cameraman. The company had produced eighteen single reel Bison brand pictures in New York before coming west and had been organized by Charles O. Bau- mann, Adam Kessel and Mr. French in New York in April, 1909. The original Los Angeles Bison Company consisted of Art Acord, James Youngdeer, \"Princess\" Red Wing, Barney Sherry, Charles Avery, Jule Darrell, Evelyn Graham, Bill Gibbons, Fred Balshofer, Buster Edmonds, Phyllis Daniels, Marien Sayres, Madeline West, William Daniels, Margaret Favor, Edna Maison, Jess McGraw, George Gebhardt, Jack Conway, Howard Davies, Charles Inslee, E. H. Allen, Milt Brown, Frank Mont- gomery and Messrs. Smyth, Edmonds, Hartigan and Stanley. The first Bison pictures were made in Edendale on the site of the Keystone studio, a block away from the Edendale studio of the Selig company. The studio consisted only of a horse corral and a stage. The Biso ncompany made only western pictures. For the same ground that the Sennett organization occupies today Mr. French paid $40 a month rent. His stage occupied a space 18x18 feet. Some of the early produc- tions were made for as low as $112 a picture. Mr. French, who was general manager, director, secretary and treasurer of the organization, was limited to $300 on a picture, and in no case was this sum exceeded. The actors and actresses in stock, such as Sherry, Youngdeer and a few others, re- ceived $35 a week. Extras got $5 a day. Cowboys were paid $3 a day. Under normal conditions the old Bison company turned out a one-reel picture in two days and sometimes finished a picture between sun-up and sun-down. From November, 1909, to July 17, 1910, the Bison company, under Mr. French's direction, completed 185 pictures, or approximately one picture every day and a half. Biograph Company Third Pacific Coast Arrival The third company to come to Los Angeles was the Biograph unit, which arrived in January, 1910, and remained thirteen weeks. Biograph erected a studio at Pico and Georgia Streets. Offices, developing and printing quarters were at Washington Street and Grand Avenue when the company first arrived. The first picture made was \"Ramona,\" which because of the California locale of the story required a visit to the Pacific Southland. \"Ramona\" was the most expensive pic- ture put out by any manufacturer up to that time. The original Los Angeles Biograph company consisted of General Manager Ham- mer, D. W. Griffith, Mack Sennett, Arthur Johnson, Owen Moore, Mary Pickford, Flor- ence Lawrence, Marjory Favor and Lee Dougherty. D. W. Griffith was the director. Essanay Comes to Coast in October, 1910 Next to arrive in California was the Essanay company of ten players which left Chicago on August 15, 1910, under the leadership of Gilbert M. Anderson. The com- pany stopped over at Golden, Colorado, sixteen miles from Denver, but late in October pulled up stakes and went to Los Gatos, California. At Los Gatos they encountered five weeks steady rain. Not a foot of film was exposed. When the forty-day flood finished the Essanay people got to work, and spent a busy nine weeks at Los Gatos making up for lost time. The Essanay company finally quit Los Gatos for their real \"farthest west\" at Red- lands, Santa Monica, on the Pacific Ocean. Santa Monica's first picture was Essanay's \"Tag Day.\" In this picture Augustus Carney, Arthur Macklin, Harry Todd, Fred Church, G. M. Anderson, and William Russell (since deceased) played the leading roles. Thereafter the Essanay company moved to San Rafael, to Lakeside, near San Diego, to Hollywood and again to Niles. Kalem Comes West On December 11, 1910, Kenean Buell brought a Kalem company to Los Angeles which previously had been working in Florida. A studio was opened in Verdugo Canyon, Glendale. Late in 1911, P. C. Hartigan opened a Kalem studio at Santa Monica. This was afterward abandoned. In September, 1913, Carlyle Blackwell opened the Kalem studio in Fleming Street, Hollywood. Nestor Opens First Hollywood Studio David Horsley's Nestor Company, it is generally agreed, was the first to open a studio in Hollywood. Mr. Horsley, in October, 1911, rented buildings for studio purposes at the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Gower Streets. Later Mr. Horsley brought to Hollywood the Thomas Ricketts company, produc- ing dramas; the Milton Fahrney company, producing westerns; and the Al E. Christie company, producing comedies. On May 20, 1912, the Nestor company was merged with Universal. Vitagraph Treks Coastward Right on the heels of the Nestor company came the Vitagraph unit. The Vitagraph players left Brooklyn October 23, 1911. A stop-over of two weeks was made at 73 Charles M. Sea^ Director- General PINE TREE PICTURES, Inc. Director of Charles M. Seay Productions Stories by JAMES OLIVER CURWOOD Next Release: \"Hearts of the Northland\" 74 Colorado Springs and at the Grand Canyon. Los Angeles was reached on November 23, 1911. The Vitagraph company consisted of Rollin S. Strugeon, director; Charles Bennett, Anne Schaefer, Tom Fortune, Robert J. Thornby, Helen Case, Tom Powers, Mr. and Mrs. Fred Burns, Robert Burns, Walter Straddling, cameraman; and Alfred Ziegler, assistant cameraman. Mr. and Mrs. William T. Rock, who had been on the coast for some time, wel- comed the Vitagraph players and brought them to the studio which they had engaged on Ocean Avenue, Santa Monica. Universal Makes its Western Debut Universal may be said to have established itself on the coast when it took over the Nestor studio on May 20, 1912. On July 12, the Universal purchased the property across the street from the Nestor acreage. This was later the home of the L-Ko comedy company. In August, 1912, William H. Swanson, then treasurer of Universal, leased 1.299 acres, now known as \"the back ranch\" at the end of San Fernando Valley, adjoining Griffith Park. In August, 1914, Universal gave up this property and moved to the present site of Universal City. Preparations for this move began in May, 1913, and on March 15, 1915, Universal City was formally opened. Early in 1915 the Universal again bought back the \"back ranch\" which it still holds. Other Companies Flock to Hollywood In September, 1912, Mack Sennett and a small company, including Mabel Nor- mand and Ford Sterling, which had been organized on July 4, 1912, came to Los Angeles. The Sennett company took over the studio which had been used by the original Bison company. Famous Players began work in Los Angeles in 1912, when Edwin S. Porter brought a company to the coast to produce \"Tess of the Storm Country,\" in which Mary Pickford was starred. The Lasky company, later merged with Famous Players, started work in Los Angeles early in 1914. At about the same time David W. Griffith brought Reliance-Majestic company west. James Youngdeer made pictures for Pathe in 1912; Thauhouser opened a plant late in the same year; Lubin sent a company west under Capt. Wilbert Melville in 1913, and the Balboa and Albuquerque companies also commenced operations about the same time. In the latter part of 1913 Bosworth, Inc., commenced making pictures. When the Great War broke out the pioneer days had passed. The studios were well established. System had replaced haphazard methods of production. The days of crude sets and cruder acting were gone. Photography and direction had improved marvelously. The Los Angeles studios were \"all set\" to win the world's markets. At the present day there are 49 studios in and around Los Angeles, and about 175 producing units are at work. Los Angeles \"houses\" about 20,000 picture people. In 1920, the studio payrolls amounted to about $40,000,000. About $20,000,000 was spent, most of it in Los Angeles, for studio equipment and supplies. The total investment in studios runs into the hundreds of millions of dollars.
