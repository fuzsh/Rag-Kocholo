        "text": "From Tom Mix’s entry into motion pictures in 1910 for the Selig Company and his quick rise to starring roles, then into feature-length in 1918 for the rest of the silent era, he was never off the silver screen. Movie audiences and fans could always count on the fact that there’d be a new Tom Mix film coming soon.\n\nMention Tom Mix to anyone today, and there’s an instant reaction of recognition, even from folks who aren’t avid TCM-watchers or attendees of cine-conventions. They know the name. Maybe it’s because of the radio show he lent his name to that ran from 1933-1943. His name and legend as a movie cowboy are known to many.\n\nEven if they’ve never seen one of his films. Which is pretty likely to be the case.\n\nFrom 1918-1929, Tom Mix (born Thomas Hezekiah Mix) starred in and released a whopping 6-to-9 feature-length western action-adventure films a year. A total of 83 films. His popularity in the mid-‘teens was strong enough for an independent producer to cobble together a handful of Mix’s earlier Selig one-reelers and create new features out of them.\n\nDuring the first year of the pandemic when I was looking for another silent film or films to release on my Undercrank Productions label, I discovered that the Library of Congress had a 35mm preservation negative of Sky High (1922). This title had been added to the National Film Registry list in 1998. I’d seen the film, years ago, as well as The Great K&A Train Robbery, and the recently restored (by MoMA) Outlaws of Red River.\n\nThe number of silent westerns released by the better-known home-video outfits (Kino, Image, Criterion, Flicker Alley) can be counted on one hand. None of these are Tom Mix silents. Boutique/budget label Grapevine Video released five Mix silents many years ago, as well as two of the compilation features. And so, my decision was made to add a Tom Mix feature to the catalog of silent films that ought to be better-known that I’ve released over the last 9 years.\n\nI was unfamiliar with Tom Mix’s overall career and, in particular, his filmography. And so, I dug in. What I found, as they say in click-bait ads, will astound you.\n\nBelow is a list of Tom Mix starring features made from 1918 through 1929, and a note as to whether the film survives or not. I compiled this using IMDb, the American Silent Film Survival Database, and through a colleague consulting the FIAF (International Federation of Film Archives) silent film database. Corrections and revisions are welcome; if you work at an archive (perhaps the Národní filmový archiv in Prague) and want to look into the completeness of any of the Tom Mix films in your collections, I’d be happy to update this page.\n\nUndercrank Productions is currently restoring both Sky High (1922) and The Big Diamond Robbery (1929) for home-video. The films will be seen in new 2K digital restorations from 35mm elements preserved by the Library of Congress and Lobster Films . These films will be released on Blu-ray and DVD at the end of 2022, or in early 2023.\n\nTom Mix Filmography\n\n1918\n\nCupid’s Roundup – Jan 13, 1918 – 5r – LOST\n\nSix-Shooter Andy – Feb 24, 1918 – 5r – LOST\n\nWestern Blood – Apr 14, 1918 – 5r – LOST\n\nAce High – Jun 9, 1918 – 5r – survives (completeness unconfirmed)\n\nMr. Logan, U.S.A. – Sept 8, 1918 – 5r – LOST\n\nFame and Fortune – Oct 20, 1918 – 5r – LOST\n\n1919\n\nTreat ‘Em Rough – Jan 5, 1919 – 5r – only 2 reels extant\n\nHell-Roarin’ Reform – Feb 16, 1919 – 5r – LOST\n\nFighting for Gold – Mar 30, 1919 – 5r – survives incomplete\n\nThe Coming of the Law – May 11, 1919 – 5r – only 1 reel extant\n\nThe Wilderness Trail – July 6, 1919 – 5r – LOST\n\nRough-Riding Romance – Aug 24, 1919 – 5r – fragments extant\n\nThe Speed Maniac – Oct 19, 1919 – 5r – LOST\n\nThe Feud – Dec 7, 1919 – 5r – LOST\n\n1920\n\nThe Cyclone – Jan 25, 1920 – 5r – LOST\n\nThe Daredevil – Mar 7, 1920 – 5r – LOST\n\nDesert Love – Apr 20, 1920 – 5r – LOST\n\nThe Terror – May 29, 1920 – 5r – LOST\n\n3 Gold Coins – Jul 4, 1920 – 5r – LOST\n\nThe Untamed – Aug 29, 1920 – 5r – survives (completeness unconfirmed)\n\nThe Texan – Oct 31, `1920 – 5r – survives (completeness unconfirmed)\n\nPrairie Trails – Dec 26, 1920 – LOST\n\n1921\n\nThe Road Demon – Feb 20, 1921 – 5r – LOST\n\nHands Off! – Apr 3, 1921 – 5r – LOST\n\nA Ridin’ Romeo – May 22, 1921 – 5r – LOST\n\nThe Big Town Round-up – Jun 26, 1921 – 5r – survives (completeness unconfirmed)\n\nAfter Your Own Heart – Aug 7, 1921 – 5r – LOST\n\nThe Night Horsemen – Sep 18, 1921 – 5r – survives (completeness unconfirmed)\n\nThe Rough Diamond – Oct 30, 1921 – 5r – LOST\n\nTrailin’ – Dec 11, 1921 – 5r – survives\n\n1922\n\nSky High – Jan 15, 1922 – 5r – survives\n\nChasing the Moon – Feb 26, 1922 – 5r – LOST\n\nUp and Going – 5r – Apr 2, 1922 – LOST\n\nThe Fighting Streak – 5r – May 15, 1922 – survives (completeness unconfirmed)\n\nFor Big Stakes – 5r – Jun 18, 1922 – survives (completeness unconfirmed)\n\nJust Tony – 5r – Aug 20, 1922 – survives\n\nDo and Dare – 5r – Oct 1, 1922 – LOST\n\nArabia – 5r – Nov 5, 1922 – LOST\n\nCatch My Smoke – 5r – Dec 3, 1922 – LOST\n\n1923\n\nRomance Land – 5r – Feb 11, 1923 – survives (completeness unconfirmed)\n\nThree Jumps Ahead – 5r – Mar 25, 1923 – LOST\n\nStepping Fast – 5r – May 13, 1923 – LOST\n\nSoft Boiled – 8r – Aug 26, 1923 – survives (completeness unconfirmed)\n\nThe Lone Star Ranger – 6r – Sept 9, 1923 – LOST\n\nMile-a-Minute Romeo – 6r – Oct 28, 1923 – LOST\n\nNorth of Hudson Bay – 5r – Nov 18, 1923 – survives\n\nEyes of the Forest – 5r – survives incomplete\n\n1924\n\nLadies to Board – 6r – Feb 3, 1924 – LOST\n\nThe Trouble Shooter – 6r – May 4, 1924 – survives\n\nThe Heart Buster – 5r – Jul 6, 1924 – LOST\n\nThe Last of the Duanes – 7r – Aug 24, 1924 – LOST\n\nOh, You Tony! – 7r – Sept 21, 1924 – survives\n\nTeeth – 7r – Nov 2, 1924 – survives\n\nThe Deadwood Coach – 7r – Dec 7, 1924 – LOST\n\n1925\n\nDick Turpin – 7r – Feb 1, 1925 – survives\n\nRiders of the Purple Sage – 6r – Mar 15, 1925 – survives\n\nThe Rainbow Trail – 6r – May 24, 1925 – survives\n\nThe Lucky Horseshoe – 5r – Aug 29, 1925 – survives\n\nThe Everlasting Whisper – 6r – Oct 11, 1925 – LOST\n\nThe Best Bad Man – 5r – Dec 12, 1925 – survives\n\n1926\n\nThe Yankee Señor – 5r – Jan 10, 1926 – survives (completeness unconfirmed)\n\nMy Own Pal – 6r – Feb 28, 1926 – LOST\n\nTony Runs Wild – 6r – Apr 18, 1926 – survives (completeness unconfirmed)\n\nHard Boiled – 6r – Jun 6, 1926 – survives (completeness unconfirmed)\n\nNo Man’s Gold – 6r – Aug 26, 1926 – survives (completeness unconfirmed)\n\nThe Great K&A Train Robbery – 5r – Oct 17, 1926 – survives\n\nThe Canyon of Light – 6r – Dec 5, 1926 – LOST\n\n1927\n\nThe Last Trail – 6r – Jan 23, 1927 – survives (completeness unconfirmed)\n\nThe Broncho Twister – Mar 13, 1927 – LOST\n\nOutlaws of Red River – May 8, 1927 – survives\n\nThe Circus Ace – 5r – Jun 26, 1927 – survives (completeness unconfirmed)\n\nTumbling River – 5r – Aug 21, 1927 – LOST\n\nSilver Valley – 5r – Oct 2, 1927 – LOST\n\nThe Arizona Wildcat – 5r – Nov 20, 1927 – LOST\n\n1928\n\nDaredevil’s Reward – 6r – Jan 15, 1928 – LOST\n\nHorseman of the Plains – 5r – Mar 11, 1928 – survives (completeness unconfirmed)\n\nHello Cheyenne! – 6r – May 13, 1928 – LOST\n\nPainted Post – 5r – Jul 1, 1928 – survives (completeness unconfirmed)\n\nKing Cowboy – 7r – Aug 9, 1928 – LOST\n\nSon of the Golden West – 6r – Oct 1, 1928 – survives incomplete\n\n1929"
