        "text": "More than 80 films featuring the Prince of Darkness, Dracula. This is the preeminent list of films based on the character and many of them I have never seen.\n\nI have added as many links as I could so that you can either watch the films online on Amazon Prime Video or if they are available as Blu-Ray or DVD. Of course, some of these are unavailable in all areas and may require subscriptions to other streaming services other than Amazon Prime.\n\nPlease consider using these links because they help support my blog.\n\nDracula Movies of the 1920s\n\nThe Death of Dracula – 1921 – A Hungarian film version of Dracula, The Death of Dracula was the first adaptation of Bram Stoker’s novel.\n\nNosferatu, A Symphony of Terror – 1922 – This was an unofficial film version of Stoker’s novel, so they changed the name of the character to Count Orlok.\n\nDracula Movies of the 1930s\n\nDracula—1931 – Directed by Tod Browning and starring Bela Lugosi as the count.\n\nDracula – 1931 – A Spanish version of the Tod Browning film with a different cast that was filmed on the same sets.\n\nMark of the Vampire–1935 – This wasn’t really a sequel to Universal’s Dracula, but it might as well have been. Bela Lugosi stars as Count Mora in this film from MGM which was also directed by Tod Browning.\n\nDracula’s Daughter – 1936 – This really was a sequel to the 1931 Dracula, and it features Gloria Holden as the titular Dracula’s daughter.\n\nDracula Movies of the 1940s\n\nSon of Dracula – 1943 – This one starred Lon Chaney Jr. as Dracula, and it’s set in the American South.\n\nThe Return of the Vampire – 1944 – Bela Lugosi plays Armand Tesla, but he might as well have everyone call him Dracula, because he’s essentially the same character.\n\nHouse of Frankenstein – 1944 – This was the first movie to feature Wolfman, Dracula, and Frankenstein all in the same film. John Carradine portrays Dracula in this one.\n\nHouse of Dracula – 1945 – A direct sequel to House of Frankenstein, again featuring the big three – Wolfman, Dracula, and Frankenstein.\n\nAbbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein– 1948 – Bela Lugosi reprises his role as Count Dracula for this silly B-grade comedy.\n\nDracula Movies of the 1950s\n\nDracula Istanbul’da – 1953 – A Turkish movie production of Dracula.\n\nThe Blood of Dracula – 1957 – After the success of I Was a Teenage Werewolf, producer Herman Cohen tried to duplicate that success with an “I was a teenage Dracula” movie.\n\nHorror of Dracula – 1958 – The first of the Hammer Studios Dracula films, starring Christopher Lee as Dracula and Peter Cushing as Van Helsing.\n\nThe Return of Dracula – 1958 – A B-movie version of Dracula that’s well thought of. Francis Lederer plays the Count.\n\nDracula Movies of the 1960s\n\nBrides of Dracula – 1960 – The 2nd Hammer Dracula movie, but this one doesn’t have Christopher Lee. (But it does feature Peter Cushing as Van Helsing again.)\n\nDracula, Prince of Darkness – 1966 – Features Christopher Lee’s return as Count Dracula, and Peter Cushing again portrays Van Helsing.\n\nBilly the Kid vs. Dracula— 1966 – An Old West Dracula storyline where the Count battles Billy the Kid. John Carradine reprises his role as the Count.\n\nThe Fearless Vampire Killers– 1967 – This is another of those “not-really-a-Dracula” movies, this one directed by Roman Polanski. It’s a spoof of the Hammer Dracula movies, and the vampire has a different name, but come on. We all know he’s Dracula.\n\nDracula Has Risen From the Grave – 1968 – The 3rd film to feature Christopher Lee as Dracula.\n\nBlood of Dracula’s Castle – 1969 – Count Dracula has a wife in this one, and their butler is played by John Carradine, who had portrayed Dracula himself several times.\n\nJonathan – 1969 – A German retelling of the Dracula story\n\nDracula Movies of the 1970s\n\nTaste the Blood of Dracula – 1970 – More Christopher Lee Dracula goodness from Hammer. But this time without Peter Cushing\n\nScars of Dracula – 1970 – Another Christopher Lee Dracula film from Hammer, again without Peter Cushing.\n\nCountess Dracula – 1970 – This is another Hammer film, but it’s unrelated to the other Hammer Dracula films.\n\nJess Franco’s Count Dracula— 1973 – Stars Christopher Lee as Dracula, but it’s completely unrelated to the Hammer Dracula movies. This is one of the most faithful adaptations of the novel available.\n\nVampyros Lesbos – 1970 – Count Dracula isn’t in the movie, but one of his descendants is. This is Jess Franco’s follow-up to Count Dracula.\n\nDracula vs. Frankenstein – 1971 – A really low-budget B-movie set in California. You do get to see Dracula battle Frankenstein though.\n\nDracula A.D. 1972 – 1972 – Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing, together again, this time retelling the Dracula story in a modern setting.\n\nDracula’s Great Love – 1972 – Paul Naschy as Dracula in this Spanish-language film. The plot has no resemblance to the original novel.\n\nBlacula–– 1972 – A “blaxploitation” retelling of the vampire classic.\n\nMore Dracula Movies of the 1960s and 1970s\n\nDracula Has Risen from the Grave–1969\n\nCountess Dracula–1972\n\nScream, Blacula, Scream! – 1973 – A sequel to 1972′s Blacula\n\nThe Satanic Rites of Dracula – 1973 – Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing appear together again as Dracula and Van Helsing.\n\nThe 7 Brothers Meet Dracula – 1973 – This was the last of the Hammer Dracula movies. This one features Peter Cushing again, but this time without Christopher Lee.\n\nLake of Dracula–1973\n\nBlood For Dracula – 1974 – An incredibly over-the-top version of Dracula produced by Andy Warhol. Udo Kier’s performance will leave you speechless, but not necessarily in a good way.\n\nAndy Warhol’s Young Dracula–1974\n\nDan Curtis’ Dracula– 1974 – Stars Jack Palance as Dracula. (He was the inspiration for the Marvel Comics version of the character, so great minds must think alike.)\n\nOld Dracula–1975\n\nEvil of Dracula–1975–A Japanese take on Dracula\n\nDracula, Father, and Son – 1976 – A French spoof of Dracula movies starring Christopher Lee. A comedy.\n\nCount Dracula – 1977 – This is a BBC miniseries, with 150 minutes of Dracula goodness. In spite of its low budget, it’s remarkably faithful to the original novel.\n\nZoltan, Hound of Dracula – 1978 – Dracula’s dog is the villain in this one, and the main character is a psychiatrist.\n\nDracula – 1979 – Frank Langella portrays another version of Dracula, this time as an extraordinarily sexual and attractive predator. Also stars Lawrence Olivier and Donald Pleasance. (This was another Universal Dracula movie, although it’s not related to the earlier films.)\n\nLove at First Bite – 1979 – George Hamilton plays Dracula in this comedy spoof of other Dracula films. The disco scene is great.\n\nNosferatu the Vampyre – 1979 – A Werner Herzog remake of the 1922 Nosferatu, A Symphony of Terror, starring Klaus Kinski as Count Orlock.\n\nDracula Movies of the 1980s\n\nDoctor Dracula–1980\n\nElvira’s Movie Macabre: Count Dracula’s Great Love–1981\n\nMonster Squad – 1987 – A cheesy, fun kids’ movie with some genuinely scary moments (for the kids at least). Duncan Regehr makes a great Dracula.\n\nDracula Movies of the 1990s\n\nBram Stoker’s Dracula – 1992 – A lavish production starring Gary Oldman as Dracula. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola.\n\nEd Wood – 1994 – Not really a Dracula movie, but Bela Lugosi is a prominent character in the film, and the performances are terrific. Martin Landau won a Best Supporting Actor award for his portrayal of Lugosi.\n\nDracula, Dead and Loving It – 1995 – Stars Leslie Nielsen as Dracula. Obviously a spoof/parody.\n\nDracula Movies of the 2000s\n\nDark Prince: The True Story of Dracula–2000\n\nDracula 2000 – A Wes Craven-produced update of the original Dracula novel. Christopher Plummer is excellent as Van Helsing, and Jeri Ryan is terrifically hot. Gerard Butler makes a pretty cool Dracula too.\n\nShadow of the Vampire – 2000 – Not really a Dracula movie, but a fictional retelling of the making of Nosferatu. The premise is that Max Schreck really was a vampire.\n\nDracula, Pages from a Virgin’s Diary – 2002 – Guy Maddin’s ballet version of Dracula. Incredible.\n\nDracula’s Kiss–2002\n\nDracula II – 2003 – A sequel to Wes Craven’s Dracula 2000.\n\nDracula 3, Legacy – 2004 – The third in the series of Dracula movies that Wes Craven produced. Rutger Hauer plays Dracula in this one.\n\nBlade: Trinity – 2004 – Dracula is called “Drake” throughout the movie, but he’s a pretty important character. (Albeit not the main character. Wesley Snipes’ Blade is still the star of the show.)\n\nDracula 3000 – 2004 – Basically Dracula in space. Stars Erika Eleniak.\n\nLust for Dracula–2004\n\nVan Helsing – 2004 – The unmistakable appeal of having the Wolfman, Dracula, and Frankenstein appear together is exploited again in this action movie starring Hugh Jackman as Van Helsing. Another Universal film.\n\nBatman vs Dracula–2005 – A full-length animated movie pitting the Dark Knight against the original creature of the night.\n\nDracula–2007\n\nBram Stoker’s Dracula’s Guest–2008\n\nCount Dracula’s Great Love–2008\n\nElvira’s Movie Macabre: The Satanic Rites of Dracula\n\nDracula Movies of the 2010s\n\nDracula Reborn–2012\n\nDear Dracula–2012–Animated\n\nDracula, Lord of the Damned–2012\n\nArgento’s Dracula–2013\n\nDracula–The True Story of Vampires–2013\n\nDracula the Dark Prince–2013\n\nDracula: Untold–2014\n\nWaiting for Dracula–2016\n\nDracula: The Legend Lives–2016\n\nTrial of Dracula–2017\n\nThe Many Faces of Dracula–2017\n\nDracula in Love–2018\n\nDracula Movies of the 2020s\n\nDracula’s Daughter–2020\n\nVlad the Impaler — 2020\n\nBram Stoker’s Van Helsing–2021\n\nVillage of the Vampire — 2021\n\nDracula: Season 1–2021\n\nDracula on Holiday–2021\n\nDracula: The Original Living Vampire–2022\n\nThe Curse of Dracula–2022\n\nVampir — 2022\n\nRenfield — 2023\n\nThe Last Voyage of the Demeter — 2023\n\nSo what do you think?
