RELEASE DATE: September 25, 1921. MOVIE TITLE: The Idle Class. STUDIO: Charles Chaplin Productions. PLOT: The conflict here is between Charlie the wealthy and alcoholic husband and Charlie the Tramp: the idle rich and the idle poor. In the opening scene wealthy Edna descends from a Pullman car while the Tramp crawls out from under another one. At a fancy masquerade ball Edna's husband (Charlie) appears as a knight whose visor is stuck closed. The Tramp shows up, running from the law, and is mistaken for the husband. Edna finds the new ''husband'' more to her liking than the real one. When true identities are revealed, a fight breaks out and the Tramp is ejected. PICTURED: Charlie Chaplin as tramp and husband.
