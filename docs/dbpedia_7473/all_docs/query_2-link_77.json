        "text": "Despite the absence of physical closeness, ethologists also form strong relationships with the lynxes as they watch their lives through video. This affords a different kind of intimate encounter, a glimpse into the lives of lynxes when no humans are around. “You can look at their eyes and their expressions, and how they talk to each other, and how they bond with each other,” one ethologist explained. “My relationship with them—that’s not what I value. It’s their relationship with each other. What I truly enjoy is that they have a life like I have mine.”\n\nThis relationship comes with its own discomforts. Although the keepers are responsible for providing rabbits and cleaning up after feedings, the ethologists are required to watch each rabbit get eaten. They dutifully record how the cubs play with their prey, sometimes for hours, before they kill the rabbit. While they recognize this is an important stage in the behavioral development of the lynx, it is painful to witness. An ethologist told me she learned to mute the rabbits’ screams so they don’t affect her work. When I asked her what it sounded like, she replied, “Anguish.”\n\nThe keepers face their own challenges. When I asked about the most emotionally difficult parts of their work, each responded with the same answer. In certain circumstances, keepers must personally kill rabbits for the lynx. Each keeper developed their own ways of coping—finding ways to make the process quicker for the rabbit, praying, or trying to think of the rabbit as food instead of as an animal. For people who have dedicated their lives to saving animals, this responsibility can be heartbreaking. “I felt like I was giving up on some of my principles,” one keeper said.\n\nTHE CHALLENGES OF WORKING IN CONSERVATION\n\nIn addition to dealing with ethical dilemmas, conservationists contend with long hours, low pay, difficulty taking time off, and mental exhaustion. Their jobs are incredibly demanding, both physically and emotionally. Their work is critical to society, but also critically underfunded and underpaid, often leading to poor mental health. One study found that more than a quarter of conservation professionals experienced moderate to severe psychological distress.\n\nSome lynx conservationists shared that they stayed in their field partly due to a lack of opportunities elsewhere. “I really enjoy the work I do, but I wish I was paid more. I wish I had better conditions,” one ethologist said. “Sometimes it’s upsetting. … What if I’m funneling too much into these specific skill sets?”\n\nThey also contend with the lack of control that comes with wildlife conservation. While conservation still draws on colonial ideas of dominating nature, in the breeding center’s constantly evolving and collaborative dance between human and lynx, the lynxes take the lead. Biologists can pair up lynxes in a way that preserves genetic diversity, but the lynxes are the ones who decide if they will mate. A keeper can offer an abandoned newborn to another mother, but it is the animal who decides if she will accept the cub.\n\n“We get frustrated because you cannot control everything,” one conservationist said. “You also learn that you are not a big part. Your part is very small, but it doesn’t mean that it’s not important.”\n\nBeyond the careful management at the breeding center, there are no guarantees of success following release. Some lynxes have drowned in wells, died in traffic accidents, or been poisoned with tampered meat. Other lynxes never stop running, like Lithium, who traveled more than 1,000 kilometers from southern Portugal to Barcelona.\n\nBut some survive, thrive, and multiply. And this has made all the difference.\n\nTHE REWARDS OF LYNX CONSERVATION\n\nDespite the challenges, conservationists feel strongly about the importance of their work. One ethologist who held the same role for more than 10 years said, “Your work here is really repetitive. But every day, I’m learning something. And that makes me feel that I have to do more so that [the lynxes] can be truly respected and valued.”\n\nConservationists also focus on stories of hope. In one case, two cubs who were raised together both became mothers. In another instance, a lynx adopted an abandoned cub. “I think it was the best moment in all these years, when she took the cub, licking it as if it was her own,” one ethologist said."
