        "text": "Film Year production was to begin Director Screenwriter Producer Cast Notes References Brasil 1500 (U.S. title: Gonçalo) 1997–1999 Michael Cimino Fábio Fonseca, David Newman Ilya Salkind, Jane Chaplin, Cláudio Kahns Antonio Banderas, Paul Scofield This Brazilian-American co-production, budgeted at $35 million, intended to portray the events of April 21, 1500 in Santa Cruz de Cabrália, the landing of Pedro Álvares Cabral's flagship in Brazil. Written by Fábio Fonseca, with revisions by David Newman, filming was initially set for early 1998, and then again in early 1999, for a planned release in 2000 coinciding with the 500th anniversary of the discovery of Brazil. The film was to be told through the eyes of a fictional character, (similarly to Titanic), Gonçalo, a Portuguese sailor from Cabral's fleet. Antonio Banderas considered to star, with a supporting cast composed largely of Brazilian natives. Locations included Porto Seguro, Portugal, and studios in Los Angeles. Director Michael Cimino claimed that an exact replica of Cabral's flagship had been constructed for the production. [2][3] Blest Souls 1987 Michael Cimino Eoghan Harris, Robert Bolt, Michael Cimino Barry Spikings, Michael Cimino, Joann Carelli Gabriel Byrne, Sean Bean, Tilda Swinton Michael Cimino planned to make a film about 1920s Irish leader Michael Collins, going as far as going to County Kerry, Ireland to scout locations. The script was written by Eoghan Harris, but it was really a complete revision and rewriting of the script by Robert Bolt that Cimino worked from. Columbia Studios was eager to do it, but since Coca-Cola called the shots at the time, they refused to give Cimino funding. It was canceled by 1987, and a rival script at Warner Bros. eventually was made by Neil Jordan. [4][5][6] A Cold Case 2004 Mark Romanek John Sayles, Eric Roth (from the Philip Gourevitch novel of the same name) Tom Hanks, Gary Goetzman Tom Hanks, Robert De Niro Mark Romanek's dream project was an adaptation of the procedural novel A Cold Case starring Tom Hanks as chief investigator Andy Rosenzweig. Robert De Niro also signed on for a role. The film was in the late stages of pre-production when it was suddenly pulled due to life rights issues with the novel. Subsequent revivals of the film would too be halted due to Hanks' commitment with other roles at the time. \"I hope to make it someday and in a way,\" said Romanek. \"It's a part for Tom Hanks that might be a lot more affecting when he's older.\" [7][8][9] The Dancer 1970 Tony Richardson Edward Albee Harry Saltzman Rudolf Nureyev as Nijinsky, Claude Jade as Romola and Paul Scofield as Diaghilev Producer Harry Saltzman canceled the project during pre-production several weeks before shooting was to begin. Saltzman claimed Albee's script was amateurish. Tony Richardson believes Saltzman used this as a pretext to avoid making the film. According to Richardson, Saltzman had overextended himself and did not have the funds to make the film. Saltzman eventually made the film in 1980 as Nijinsky, directed by Herbert Ross. The Double 1996 Roman Polanski Jeremy Leven (from the Fyodor Dostoevsky novel of the same name) Lili Fini Zanuck, Todd Black John Travolta, Isabelle Adjani, John Goodman, Jean Reno Travolta reportedly stormed out of rehearsals thereby shutting down pre-production. Shooting to have begun in May 1996. Travolta was being paid US$17M. Robert Richardon was signed to photograph the film and Pierre Guffroy design the sets.

The project was abandoned in 1976. The attempt was the basis of the 2013 documentary Jodorowsky's Dune. [12] The First Day (Russian: Первый День Pervyj Dyen) 1979 Andrei Tarkovsky Based on a script by Andrei Konchalovsky Goskino USSR Natalya Bondarchuk and Anatoli Papanov The film was set in 18th-century Russia during the reign of Tsar Peter the Great. As the film was critical of the USSR's state atheism, Tarkovsky submitted a different script to Goskino USSR than the one he actually filmed, with several extra scenes criticizing state atheism. After shooting about half of the film, this was discovered by censors and the project was halted by Goskino. Infuriated, Tarkovsky reportedly destroyed most of the footage he had shot. [13] Flamingos Forever Mid-to-late 1980s John Waters John Waters John Waters for New Line Cinema Divine, Mary Vivian Pearce, Edith Massey, Mink Stole, Jean Hill The unfilmed sequel to Pink Flamingos would have taken place 15 years after the events of the first movie. Troma Entertainment offered to finance the film at $600,000. However, the film was cancelled because Divine wanted to focus on more serious, male roles and Edith Massey died in 1984. Waters did not feel comfortable with Troma's post-editing facilities. The original screenplay can be found in his 1988 book \"Trash Trio\". [14] Flora Plum 1999–2005 Jodie Foster Steven Rogers Jodie Foster, Barry Mendel Claire Danes, Russell Crowe (left project), Ewan McGregor Foster planned to direct the romance film set among 1930s circus performers, and the start of filming was delayed after Crowe sustained a shoulder injury and left the project. McGregor replaced Crowe, but the project was abandoned in 2005. [15][16] The Freak 1966–1975 Charlie Chaplin Victoria Chaplin The Freak was a dramatic comedy from Charles Chaplin. The story revolved around a young South American girl who unexpectedly sprouts a pair of wings. She is kidnapped and taken to London, where her captors cash in by passing her off as an angel. Later she escapes, only to be arrested because of her appearance. She is further dehumanized by standing trial to determine if she is human at all. Chaplin began work in and around 1969 with his daughter Victoria in mind for the lead role. However, Victoria's abrupt marriage and his advanced age proved roadblocks, and the film was never made. Frenzy (a.k.a. Kaleidoscope) c. 1967 Alfred Hitchcock Benn Levy Alfred Hitchcock Considerable test footage was shot. Not to be confused with Hitchcock's 1972 film Frenzy. Gambit 2014–2019 Various Josh Zetumer Lauren Shuler Donner Channing Tatum Preproduction on a film based on the Marvel Comics character Gambit began in 2014 with Tatum in the lead.

Cotrona, Megan Gale, Adam Brody, Common, Santiago Cabrera, Jay Baruchel Miller began preproduction on the live-action adaptation of the animated series Justice League Unlimited in 2007. The cast included Armie Hammer (Batman), D.J. Cotrona (Superman), Megan Gale (Wonder Woman), Adam Brody (The Flash), Common (Green Lantern), Santiago Cabrera (Aquaman), and Jay Baruchel (Maxwell Lord) who had begun training for the film. Filming was scheduled to begin in February 2008 but was postponed due to script and budget issues, the 2007–08 WGA strike, and Warner Bros. deciding against having another film version of Batman with The Dark Knight in post-production. [18] The Lawbreakers 1979 or 1980 David Lean Robert Bolt (based on Richard Hough's novel Captain Bligh and Mr. Christian) Phil Kellogg, Bernard Williams Christopher Reeve, Anthony Hopkins, Hugh Grant David Lean and Robert Bolt began working on a script in October 1977, planning to adapt the source novel into two films; The Lawbreakers and The Long Arm. In November 1977, Dino De Laurentiis announced he would finance the project, and in December Paramount Pictures signed on to distribute. The intention was to shoot the film in Tahiti, where De Laurentiis had a large facility built. Producer Bernard Williams budgeted The Lawbreakers alone at $40 million, and De Laurentiis decided he could not afford to proceed. The first film's script was finished in November 1978, but Bolt later suffered from a heart attack followed by a stroke, leaving the second incomplete. Lean was ultimately forced to abandon the project after overseeing casting and the construction of the Bounty replica which cost $4 million. De Laurentiis did not want to lose the millions he had already invested, so he looked for a new director. Christopher Reeve stayed on as Fletcher Christian through the change in director, but he later dropped out at the last minute and was replaced by Mel Gibson. The film was release as one film The Bounty, in 1984. [19][20][21][22] The Long Arm Leningrad: The 900 Days Late 1980s Sergio Leone Based on Harrison Salisbury's non-fiction The 900 Days: The Siege Of Leningrad Sergio Leone Robert De Niro After Once Upon a Time in America Sergio Leone spent the remainder of his life preparing to produce and direct an epic war film set during the Siege of Leningrad with Robert De Niro playing an American journalist inside the city. Having raised $100 million in funding and discussed location filming with the Soviet government, Leone died of a heart attack before production could begin in earnest. [23] The Many Faces of Jesus 1973–1978 Jens Jørgen Thorsen Jens Jørgen Thorsen Various, including David Grant A pornographic film depicting Jesus engaged in sex acts with men and women. The premise caused controversy in every country where production was attempted. The effort was condemned by both Pope Paul VI and Queen Elizabeth II. After failing to secure funding in multiple countries, bans on production in at least two, and a personal ban from entering the United Kingdom, Thorsen abandoned the effort. The saga led to the gay Jesus film hoax. Thorsen later produced The Return [da], a non-pornographic film about Jesus. [24][25][26] The Micronauts 1975–1978 Don Sharp, Richard Loncraine and others John Gay, Gordon Williams and others Harry Saltzman Gregory Peck, Lee Remick, James Mason, Honor Blackman, Stacy Keach Adaptation of novel Cold War in a Country Garden. Some test and special effects footage was shot. Principal photography did not begin. No scenes with the leads were shot. Midnight Rider 2013–2014 Randall Miller Randall Miller, Jody Savin Randall Miller, Jody Savin William Hurt Based on the life of musician Gregg Allman, the film was cancelled after camera assistant Sarah Jones was killed and seven others injured by a train while the production was filming a camera test on an active railroad trestle bridge. [27] Napoleon 1968–1969 Stanley Kubrick Stanley Kubrick Jack Nicholson Kubrick's film about Napoleon was well into preproduction and ready to begin filming in 1969 when MGM cancelled the project. Numerous reasons have been cited for the abandonment of the project, including its projected cost and a change of ownership at MGM. [28][29] Nostromo 1991 David Lean David Lean, Maggie Unsworth (from the Joseph Conrad novel of the same name) Serge Silberman Georges Corraface, Marlon Brando, Paul Scofield, Peter O'Toole, Isabella Rossellini, Christopher Lambert, Dennis Quaid During the last years of his life, David Lean was in pre-production of a film version of Joseph Conrad's Nostromo. Steven Spielberg was initially attached to produce the project, with the backing of Warner Bros., but after several rewrites and disagreements on the script, he left the project and was replaced by Serge Silberman. Several writers circled the project, including Christopher Hampton and Robert Bolt, but their work was abandoned. In the end, Lean decided to write the film himself with the assistance of Maggie Unsworth (wife of cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth). Originally Lean considered filming in Mexico but later decided to film in London and Madrid. Nostromo had a total budget of $46 million and was six weeks away from filming at the time of Lean's death. It has been rumored that fellow film director John Boorman would take over, but the production collapsed. [30] Oil and Vinegar Late 1980s Howard Deutch John Hughes Molly Ringwald, Matthew Broderick After he finished writing the script for Pretty in Pink, Hughes wrote the script of a film titled Oil and Vinegar, which was to star Matthew Broderick and Molly Ringwald as a couple who \"spend a day in a motel room, swapping stories on life and love\". According to Broderick, \"It was very intimate: it was just the two of them, basically, is my memory, often in a car. It was a very typical romantic comedy about two very different people who fell in love, but it was very inventive in its smallness.\" The film was to have been released by Universal Pictures, but Hughes objected when the studio asked for rewrites. Therefore, the creative differences between Hughes and Universal, along with Broderick and Ringwald's scheduling conflicts, are credited for why the film was never made. [31][32][33][34] On the Road 1979–1995 Francis Ford Coppola Francis Ford Coppola, Roman Coppola (based on the Jack Kerouac novel of the same name Ethan Hawke, Brad Pitt Francis Ford Coppola bought the screen rights to On the Road in 1979. Over the years, he hired several screenwriters to adapt the book into a film, including Michael Herr and Barry Gifford, only for Coppola to write his own draft with his son, Roman. In 1995, Coppola planned to shoot on black-and-white 16 mm film and held auditions with poet Allen Ginsberg in attendance but the project fell through. [35][36] Paradise Road 1986 Peter Bogdanovich David Scott Milton, Peter Bogdanovich (from the novel of the same name) Peter Bogdanovich Frank Sinatra, James Stewart, Lee Marvin, Charles Aznavour, Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis, Sophia Loren, John Ritter In the late '80s, Peter Bogdanovich almost led an all-star cast for a comedy-drama set in Las Vegas called Paradise Road about degenerate gamblers who lose their casino in a poker game. However, the film was not made, due to the meddling of Sinatra's lawyers, as claimed by Bogdanovich. [37][38][39][40] Perfect Strangers 1975 Michael Cimino Michael Cimino David V. Picker Roy Scheider, Romy Schneider, Oskar Werner In 1975, Perfect Strangers entered the early stages of pre-production at Paramount Pictures with a cast composed of Roy Scheider, Romy Schneider and Oskar Werner, and Michael Cimino aboard to helm the film based on his original screenplay. The project was described as a political love story that bore \"some resemblance to Casablanca, involving the romantic relationship of three people.\" Due to various political and internal difficulties at the studio, the film was not made. [41][42] Pinkville 2007–2010 Oliver Stone Mikko Alanne Bruce Willis, Channing Tatum, Woody Harrelson, Michael Peña, Cam Gigandet, Xzibit In August 2007, it was announced that Oliver Stone was going to make Pinkville, a dramatization about the My Lai massacre. The film was to have starred Bruce Willis, Channing Tatum and Woody Harrelson in the lead roles. However, on November that same year, the project was postponed by its distributor, United Artists, in the wake of the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike. In January 2008, it was announced that the project was officially cancelled. It was later reported in December 2010 that Stone had spoken with Shia LaBeouf about considering to revive Pinkville with the latter starring. [43][44][45][46] The Prometheus Crisis/Meltdown 1973–1997 John Dahl (1994) John Carpenter from the novel by Frank M. Robinson and Thomas N. Scortia Peter Bart and Max Palevsky (1970s) Dolph Lundgren (1994)\n\nCasper Van Dien (1997)\n\nOriginally planned as a disaster film about a meltdown at a newly built nuclear power station based on a novel by two of the authors responsible for The Towering Inferno for release by Paramount. John Carpenter's script, retitled Meltdown, was a straight horror film he described as \"kind of Halloween in a nuclear power plant.\" Carpenter's script came close to production in 1994 with Dolph Lundgren starring, and again in 1997 with Casper Van Dien, but fell through both times. [47][48][49][50] Ronnie Rocket 1977–1987 David Lynch David Lynch Stuart Cornfeld Dexter Fletcher (1980)\n\nMichael J. Anderson (1987) After releasing 1977's Eraserhead, David Lynch began work on the screenplay for Ronnie Rocket, also subtitled The Absurd Mystery of the Strange Forces of Existence. Lynch described the film as being \"about electricity and a three-foot guy with red hair\". He and his agent Marty Michaelson initially attempted to find financial backing for the project, but the studio they met with never got back in touch. Later, Lynch met film producer Stuart Cornfeld who was interested in producing Ronnie Rocket, but when the two realized the project was unlikely to find sufficient financing, Lynch asked to see some other scripts to work from for his next film instead. Lynch would return again to Ronnie Rocket after each of his films, intending it, at different stages, as the follow-up not only to Eraserhead or The Elephant Man but also Dune and Blue Velvet. Brad Dourif, Dennis Hopper, Jack Nance, Isabella Rossellini, Harry Dean Stanton, and Dean Stockwell have also been considered for roles in the film at various times. Lynch visited Northern England to scout a filming location, but found that the industrial cities he had hoped to use had become too modernized to fit his intended vision. The project suffered setbacks because of the bankruptcy of several potential backers. [51][52][53] Sea Trial 1981–1983 William Friedkin Based on Frank De Felitta's novel William Friedkin, Peter Guber, Jon Peters Michael Nouri, Laura Branigan Principal photography was announced to begin in the summer of 1983, though Fox ultimately cancelled the production. [54][55] The Short Night 1979 or 1980 Alfred Hitchcock David Freeman from Ronald Kirkbride's novel Alfred Hitchcock for Universal Studios Project cancelled due to Hitchcock's advanced years and ill-health. Silver & Black 2017–2018 Gina Prince-Bythewood Lindsey Beer, Geneva Robertson-Dworet Amy Pascal, Matt Tolmach Based on the Marvel characters Silver Sable and Black Cat. Filming was delayed indefinitely before the planned start of production in March 2018 because Prince-Bythewood was not happy with the script. The film was cancelled in August 2018. [56] The Streets of Laredo 1972 Peter Bogdanovich Larry McMurtry, Peter Bogdanovich Peter Bogdanovich John Wayne, James Stewart, Henry Fonda, Ryan O'Neal, Cybill Shepherd, Ben Johnson, Cloris Leachman, Ellen Burstyn, The Clancy Brothers After directing What's Up, Doc?, Peter Bogdanovich landed a three-picture deal at Warner Bros., the first of which was to be Western called The Streets of Laredo, set just after the Civil War. Bogdanovich envisioned the film as a \"summation of the Western\", assembling an all-star cast of iconic Western stars which included primarily John Wayne, James Stewart and Henry Fonda. Fonda accepted the role, as did Stewart, though reluctantly. Wayne, however, declined (under the urgence of director John Ford who was on his death bed at the time), believing the film to be too much of a coda to Westerns. Since the film was keyed off of those three actors, Bogdanovich decided not to move forward with it. McMurtry later bought the rights back and adapted their script into a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel which he called Lonesome Dove. [57][58] Superman Lives 1996–1998 Tim Burton Kevin Smith, Wesley Strick, Dan Gilroy Jon Peters Nicolas Cage A film based on DC Comics superhero Superman was developed by Warner Bros. for two years, with Burton directing. Smith, Strick and Gilroy wrote scripts; Cage was hired to play Superman. Filming was scheduled to begin in early 1998 but was repeatedly pushed back. The studio had spent $30 million on the film by the time it was cancelled in 1998. The attempt was the basis of the documentary The Death of \"Superman Lives\": What Happened? [59] Time Between Trains 2004 Todd Field Scott Smith, Todd Field (based on Gene Smith's non-fiction American Gothic) Todd Field, William Horberg, Sydney Pollack, Anthony Minghella Time Between Trains was a Civil War-era biopic of the famed stage actor Edwin Booth, brother of Lincoln assassin John Wilkes Booth. The project had found its roots in American Gothic, a book by Gene Smith about the Booth family, optioned by DreamWorks Pictures for Field, with Scott Smith tapped to write the script. Field claimed he spent months doing his own research in the Theater Collection at Harvard's Pusey Library and was ultimately unwilling to compromise on the historical detail required to depict five major cities over a 50-year span, which would have put the budget in the $50 million to $80 million range. DreamWorks halted the project after executive Michael De Luca left the company. [60][61][62] The Trap 2014–2017 Harmony Korine Harmony Korine Charles-Marie Anthonioz Idris Elba, Benicio del Toro, Robert Pattinson, Al Pacino, James Franco, Gucci Mane Jamie Foxx was initially cast to star, but was replaced by Idris Elba. Benicio del Toro landed a role in Star Wars: The Last Jedi, which also delayed the production. Four weeks before shooting began, the financiers pulled out. [63][64][65][66] Warhead (a.k.a. James Bond of the Secret Service) 1976–1979[67] Len Deighton, Sean Connery, Kevin McClory Kevin McClory for Paramount Pictures Sean Connery (reportedly being paid US$5M)[68] Financing and legal troubles doomed the project. McClory eventually licensed his rights to Jack Schwartzman who made Never Say Never Again, which has an entirely different screenplay. McClory continued his attempts to produce versions of Warhead into the 2000s. [69][70] Winchell 1987 or 1988 Bob Fosse Michael Herr Robert Benton Robert De Niro Fosse started to work on the biographical film based on the American newspaper gossip columnist Walter Winchell with Robert De Niro starring as Winchell. Before he could even start the picture, Fosse passed away. [71] The Works 1979–1986 Lance Williams Lance Williams Alexander Schure An animated feature about robots, it would have been the world's first computer animated movie had it been made. But because of technical limitations in computer power and tools back in the 70s and early 80s, the movie never went into actual production. [72] The Yellow Jersey 1973–1986 Michael Cimino (1975–1984)\n\nJerry Schatzberg (1986) Colin Welland, Carl Foreman, Lawrence Konner Gary Mehlman, Carl Foreman Dustin Hoffman (1983–1986)\n\nChristopher Lambert (1986) The rights to Ralph Hurne's novel The Yellow Jersey were optioned in 1973 by producer Gary Mehlman, who then made a development deal with Columbia Pictures. The novel, set during the Tour de France, followed an aging professional cyclist who nearly wins the race. By 1975, Mehlman broad aboard Michael Cimino to direct the film. Over the next several years, the film generated expenses of nearly $2 million, and was in development with four studios and several independent production companies. Shooting during the Tour was initially scheduled for 1980, even though the film had no star. In 1983, when Dustin Hoffman indicated an interest in starring in it, production was imminent for 1984. However, Hoffman fired Cimino due to his uncompromising way of working. Hoffman too left the project, unsatisfied with the other replacements. Jerry Schatzberg was then brought aboard to direct, but no other actors accepted the lead role.

The film was to be shot in Rome and Nice.[81] Another media report claims that the story was about \"a famous actor\" who \"fakes a grave illness\" to collect insurance money.[82] An article claims that \"insurance swindle thriller\" stalled due to a lack of funds.[83] Terence Young claimed that he could have finished the film if he could have gotten the three stars together for one more week. [84] 1975 Bogart Slept Here Mike Nichols Neil Simon Howard W.
