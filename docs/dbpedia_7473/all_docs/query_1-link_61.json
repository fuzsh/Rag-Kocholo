        "text": "The Story That “Hillbilly Elegy” Doesn’t Tell\n\nLike many memoirs, J. D. Vance’s book misses a few details, some of which complicate the story upon which he has based much of his politics.\n\nThe Warped World of the U.K. Rioters\n\nThe United Kingdom has become more multicultural, but a wave of anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant violence raises the possibility that it is also becoming more racist.\n\nThe Russian Prisoner Who Didn’t Want to Be Freed\n\nThe opposition figure Ilya Yashin was part of the exchange that led to the release of Evan Gershkovich. Now, in Germany, he dreams of returning to his cell in Russia.\n\nElon Musk’s Surging Political Activism\n\nThe X C.E.O. has been using his platform to sound off on topics including Venezuela’s election, Trump’s campaign, and racial violence in the U.K.\n\nLetter from Biden’s Washington\n\nKamala Harris’s Best Campaign Surrogate Is Donald Trump\n\nThe ex-President’s tired old show is a great advertisement for his new rival.\n\nOpen Questions\n\nAre We Living in the Age of Info-Determinism?\n\nIncreasingly, our networks seem to be steering our history in ways we don’t like and can’t control.\n\nInfinite Scroll\n\nPopping the Bubble of Noise-Cancelling Headphones\n\nA new Japanese-designed device promises to “unmute the world,” as if it were no longer possible to do so simply by uncovering your ears.\n\nThe Sporting Scene\n\nTim Walz and the Lessons of High-School Football\n\nThe Vice-Presidential nominee was the defensive coördinator for a team that won the state title. His players say that he taught them more about togetherness than tactics.\n\nThe Current Cinema\n\nWith “Close Your Eyes,” a Legendary Filmmaker Makes a Stunning Return\n\nIn his first feature in more than two decades, the Spanish director Víctor Erice tells a story haunted by the ghosts of cinema past.\n\nUnder Review\n\nA Frank Account of an Unequal Art-World Friendship\n\nOrlando Whitfield’s memoir of his fifteen-year friendship with the disgraced art dealer Inigo Philbrick gives a momentous relationship its due, with unusual directness.\n\nPhoto Booth\n\nThe Ghosts of the Cuban National Ballet\n\nDiana Markosian’s images of a once great institution have an aura of decay and pose a question about what motivates the dancers who remain.\n\nCritics at Large\n\nCharli XCX, Chappell Roan, and the Unstable Hierarchy of Pop\n\nThis summer’s releases have breathed new life into the genre—and underscored the challenges of staying relevant in a cutthroat music landscape.\n\nCultural Comment\n\nIn “The Texas Chain Saw Massacre,” Feeding Your Family Comes First\n\nFifty years on, the film reads like sociology: assembly lines make the working class deranged, technology makes them irrelevant, and unemployment makes them hungry.\n\nBooks\n\nIs the End of Marriage the Beginning of Self-Knowledge?\n\nIn “Liars,” Sarah Manguso presents divorce as a way for women to reassert an essential identity that’s been effaced by coercive social scripts.\n\n“The Door Between Us”\n\nAgain, I pressed my ear against the wall, but I heard nothing. Why couldn’t I have said something to her?\n\n“The Penthouse”\n\nWe were lying on their bed. We were trying to be still and not ruin anything else. Soon we might even fall into sleep, our least disruptive state of being.\n\n“Lucy’s Boyfriend”\n\nYou could be involved in other people’s wanting, whether you knew it or not.\n\n“The Boy at War and at Home”\n\nHis toy cars are out of gas, creating chaos at the checkpoint, but the plastic horses can still get through.\n\n“Damages”\n\nTug too hard on a little footsy, and you wind up with a footsy in hand and a baby in tears.\n\n“A Children’s Story”\n\n“I want a happy ending,” the mother says, folding up the story and setting it on her nightstand. “You don’t know how to write happy.”\n\nPersonal History\n\nDead Man Laughing\n\nJokes run through a family.\n\nBooks\n\nCharlie Chaplin and the Business of Living\n\nChaplin’s epochal fame has tended to obscure the influences and instincts that infused his art with childlike purity.\n\nDept. of Humor\n\nIn Search of the World’s Funniest Joke\n\nThe semi-serious science of why we laugh.\n\nThe Air\n\nHow “Saturday Night Live” Breaks the Mold\n\nNBC’s new sketch show is in opposition to the rituals of mass-entertainment television.\n\nWhat Tweens Get from Sephora\n\nKids are mimicking the semi-professionals they see on their phones, imbibing ideas about beauty rooted in deep desires and capitulations.\n\nTwo Paths for Jewish Politics\n\nIn America, Jews pioneered a way of life that didn’t rely on the whims of the powerful. Now it’s under threat.\n\nHow a Rare Disorder Makes People See Monsters\n\nA mysterious neurological condition makes faces look grotesque—and sheds new light on the inner workings of the brain.\n\nHow Christian Fundamentalism Was Born Again\n\nNearly a century ago, a single trial seemed to shatter the movement’s place in America. It’s returned in a new form—but for old reasons."
