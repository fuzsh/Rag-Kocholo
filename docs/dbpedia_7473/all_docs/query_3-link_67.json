        "text": "Oppenheimer director Christopher Nolan has explained why some of the sequences were shot in black-and-white.\n\nThe biopic, Nolan’s follow-up to Tenet, will follow J Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) as he partakes in the Manhattan Project, with the stacked cast also including Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Robert Downey Jr and Matt Damon.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press, the director, who also helmed The Dark Knight trilogy and Inception, explained that the choice to film certain segments in black-and-white was due to the various plot strands in the film.\n\nRelated: Matt Damon says Cillian Murphy is \"phenomenal\" in Oppenheimer\n\n“I knew that I had two timelines that we were running in the film,” he said. “One is in colour, and that’s Oppenheimer’s subjective experience. That’s the bulk of the film. Then the other is a black and white timeline. It’s a more objective view of his story from a different character’s point of view.\n\n“We shot a lot of our hair and makeup tests using black and white. And then we would go to the IMAX film projector at CityWalk and project it there,” he added. “I’ve just never seen anything like it. To see such a massive black and white film image? It’s just a wonderful thing.”\n\nMurphy recently teased details about the film ahead of its release in July, proclaiming that audiences would be surprised by Nolan’s direction in the film.\n\nRelated: Peaky Blinders star Cillian Murphy lands next lead movie role\n\n“The question will be how Chris presents it. I think people will be very surprised and wowed by what he does. Anything I say will just seem a bit lame as compared to seeing this in an IMAX theatre,” he said.\n\n“I’m really proud of the movie and I’m really proud of what Chris has achieved,” he added. “This was, for sure, a special one, certainly because of the history with me and Chris. We were not walking around the set high fiving, but it did feel special.”"
