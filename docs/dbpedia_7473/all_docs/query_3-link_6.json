        "text": "Hi All -\n\nA frequent question here goes something like this, \"I accidentally exposed TMAX\n\n400 at 200 and I want to know the right development time to pull it\".\n\nFirst, no knock on the guys that asked the question. It's not unreasonable.\n\nBut it exposes an underlying fallacy, namely that exposing a film at a speed\n\nless than whats on the box is an error, and needs to be fixed.\n\nFirst, the whole notion of film speed is kind of loose to begin with. TMAX 400,\n\nHP5 and Tri-X all say 400 on the box, but they are NOT the same speed.\n\nSecond, WHAT you're shooting makes a difference. On a flat day with no shadows,\n\nyou could probably expose Tri-X at 800 without too much trouble. If you have a\n\nblack cat in the coal bin next to a white sheet in full sunlight, you might have\n\nto be more careful!\n\nThird, if you use the \"speed point\" definition for exposure index (Zone I = film\n\nbase + 0.1), most films are best exposed at about one stop less than what's on\n\nthe box. For instance, when I use a spot meter, I usually place the darkest\n\nthing I care about on Zone III. In full sunlight this setting is frequently\n\nequal to a one-stop overexposure. That is, I'll exposure Tri-X at f16 at 1/250.\n\nThe exceptions usually lean to even more exposure. If averaging meters get\n\nfooled, it's usually in the direction of underexposure.\n\nLast (and most important), most modern B&W emulsions have a very large tolerance\n\nfor overexposure. I think color neg films do, too. Slides are a different\n\nanimal altogether. Older emulsions used to run out of headroom a lot more\n\nquickly, and you had to pay attention to fitting the brightness of the scene to\n\nthe range of the film (via expanding and contracting).\n\nI'll let someone else talk about ISO and EI being different things, and the\n\neffects of various developers.\n\nThe bad thing about underdevelopment (pulling) is that you've decreased the\n\noverall contrast of the scene. It might look fine....but you may well end up\n\nprinting with a higher contrast paper or filter, effectively putting back what\n\nyou took away.\n\nTry this....get a roll of your favorite 400 speed film. Set the camera on 100,\n\nwalk outside on a nice bright day and shoot the roll. Whoa, a two-stop\n\noverexposure! Surely I'll get in trouble for this! Process as normal (no\n\npulling!). Make some prints, and let us know how they look. I'm not advocating\n\nshooting Tri-X at 100, but it will set you mind at ease when it comes to need to\n\n\"pull\". The camera will not self-destruct, I promise.\n\nOf course, you may end up with a greater brightness range than your paper can\n\nhandle, but that's where burning, dodging and paper grades come into play. Or,\n\nyou can just print the shadows to black. Better to have it on the negative,\n\nthough!\n\nGood light!\n\n\"Second, WHAT you're shooting makes a difference. On a flat day with no shadows, you could probably expose Tri-X at 800 without too much trouble. If you have a black cat in the coal bin next to a white sheet in full sunlight, you might have to be more careful!\"\n\nAcually, according to my experience, there should be no difference in EV on a day with flat light and full sunshine if you take an incident meter reading in the shadow in both cases and expose the film accoeding to that. Of course, development would have to be different. The reason why most people rate their film lower in contrasty than in flat lighting is because they use a light meter that probably takes an average reflected reading, hence the shadows will be well below the average on a sunny day, while not that far from the average on an overcast day.\n\nTry an incident meter, and you'll see what I mean. Actually I think an incident meter is a better tool for black and white photography than a spot meter (at least for 35mm and MF film, I don't know anything about working with sheet film).\n\nI think Kevin's point is one about modern film's overexposure latitude, and it's one that bears repeating, so I thank you, Kevin. Regarding optimum exposure and development, there remains some differences of opinion.\n\nThe old adage, \"expose for the shadows, develop for the highlights\", might resonably be restated as \"expose for the highlight development\". The statement in its original form seems to treat the exposure and development as separate entities, but in fact, they are inextricably linked, and development determines exposure. In a very low contrast scene with a brightness range of a stop or so, there are no discernable shadows, or highlights, so if we follow the old adage, how do we procede? If we want the scene to print with good separation of values, we must increase development, and reduce exposure accordingly. In the instance of a very high contrast scene, development must be reduced to maintain printable highlight densities, and as a result, exposure must be increased so that the shadow values will be adequately developed within the reduced development time. In all cases, the negative must be scaled to the printing paper. VC papers offer a continuous range of contrast, unlike the stepped grades of graded papers, but local contrast changes with paper contrast, whether graded or VC, so the exposure scale of the paper should be chosen carefully, and the negative scaled to it.\n\nBack to Kevin's point. If we use for our example an average scene, and assume an accidental overexposure of 2 stops, what do we gain by reducing development? Since the shadows are 2 stops more dense than normal, normal development will result in reduced contrast, and reduced development will only exacerbate the problem. Some of the contrast can be recovered by chosing a harder paper, but local contrast could be harsh, especially for a portrait. More than normal development will restore some of the lost contrast, but at the expense of added density and the grain that comes with it. In my own opinion, the best course is to recover as much contrast as possible through a combination of normal development and a harder paper, instead of relying on one or the other to do all of the recovery work, and utilizing all of one's printing skills to extract the best possible print from a less than optimum negative.\n\nJay"
