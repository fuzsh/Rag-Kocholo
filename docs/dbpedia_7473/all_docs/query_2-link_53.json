You can also change the focus subject manually.\n\nIn Photos, open a video you recorded in Cinematic mode, then tap Edit.\n\nWhite dots under the frame viewer indicate where Camera automatically changed the focus while recording. Yellow dots indicate where the focus was manually changed.\n\nPlay the video, or slide the white vertical bar in the frame viewer, to the point where you want to change the focus.\n\nTap the new subject, outlined in yellow, on the screen to change the focus; double tap to set automatic focus tracking on the subject.\n\nA yellow dot appears under the frame viewer to indicate the focus was changed.\n\nNote: You can also touch and hold the screen to lock the focus at a specific distance from the camera.\n\nRepeat the steps above to change focus points throughout the video.\n\nTo remove a manual focus change, tap the yellow dot under the frame viewer, then tap .\n\nTap Done to save your changes.\n\nTap to toggle between Camera’s automatic focus tracking and your manually selected focus points.\n\nAfter you save your changes, you can revert a Cinematic mode video to the original if you don’t like your edits. Open the video, tap Edit, then tap Revert.\n\nYou can use AirDrop to transfer Cinematic mode videos—with depth and focus metadata—from your iPhone to your Mac to edit in other apps.\n\nNote: To edit Cinematic mode videos recorded on an iPhone with iOS 16 or later, make sure your Mac is using macOS 13 or later.\n\nIn Photos, open the Cinematic mode video, then tap .\n\nTap Options at the top of the screen, turn on All Photos Data, then tap Done.\n\nTap AirDrop, then tap the device you want to share with (make sure the device you’re sharing with has AirDrop turned on).\n\nFor information about editing Cinematic mode videos on your Mac using Photos, see Edit a Cinematic mode video in Photos on Mac.\n\nFor information about editing Cinematic mode videos on your Mac using Final Cut Pro, iMovie, or Motion, see the Apple Support article Edit Cinematic mode video in Final Cut Pro, iMovie, and Motion on Mac."
