Dr. Charles Hutton, one of Newfoundland and Labrador's best-known forensic pathologists, has died after a second bout of cancer. He was 83.

Hutton passed away Monday.

Hutton had been a pediatric pathologist in St. John's for many years until he switched careers in his 50s to become a forensic pathologist.

He had a high and sometimes controversial profile for the testimony he gave at many trials.

During his career, he also campaigned for new legislation for a medical examiner's office, and an overhaul of what the government admitted were archaic laws.

"The medical examiner is basically an ombudsman for the dead - to speak up on their behalf, and basically just get as close to the truth as possible," Hutton said in a 1996 interview.

Hutton earned admirers in the court system, but also sparked several controversies. For instance, Ronald Dalton — one of the three main cases in the Lamer inquiry on problems in the criminal justice system — blamed Hutton for a guilty conviction in his first trial. Dalton was found not guilty in a second trial in 2000.

Although he retired at 65 from his post as chief forensic pathologist, Hutton continued to work as a consultant, including for the office used to manage.

Son Charlie Hutton said in a Facebook post that his father had continued to work until just five weeks ago.

"He was surrounded by family. Dad was an amazing man who loved life and family to the fullest. He loved to entertain," he wrote.

"He will be missed and remembered by many."
