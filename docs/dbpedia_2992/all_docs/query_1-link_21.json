        "text": "This month’s blog comes from Dr Adam Bridgen, Leverhulme Trust Early Career Fellow, Durham University, and our 2023 Brotherton Fellow.\n\nBritish working-class poets were not just passive witnesses of the dramatic transformations in social and economic life that took place during the early part of the Industrial Revolution, between 1770-1850. In fact, many working-class writers responded in remarkably early and often prescient ways to the changes that industrialisation meant for both the nature of their work and the environments they lived in. Delving into Special Collections’ extensive holdings of working-class poetry — particularly from the Leeds, Sheffield, and Yorkshire area — has been instrumental in developing this understanding.\n\nThe poets I consulted offered a variety of critical responses to industrialisation. On the one hand this might take the form of protest about the use of child labour, such as in the Hunslet toll-keeper John Yewdall’s account of the malformed children he saw pass on their way to and from work. Alternatively, it could assume the beatification of the natural world as a restorative contrast to the dark and suffocating factory. Some took a more portentous approach to steam-powered manufacturing, such as the ‘Cloverdale Bard’ Henry Constantine: in On Talent, a poem ostensibly celebrating the ‘giant strides’ of human progress, he asks readers to ‘Behold machinery with its myriad spells / Working destruction’, noting ‘Steam has the precedence bellowing o’er the earth’. Such poems reflect the challenge authors faced in a positive light on the times, though some were able to heroise Britain’s industrial might in specific locations, such as in the Airedale poet and wool sorter John Nicholson in his Low-Moor Iron-Works, pictured below.\n\nYet in The Factory Child (1831) Nicholson subsequently protests the impact of factory conditions on children’s bodies: ‘Hated by steam, their constitutions lost, / Then turn’d out shivering to the winter’s frost?’ (p. 44). Indeed, the extremes that poorly-clothed workers were exposed once out of the factory prompted an ironic departure from the more mainstream Romantic depiction of natural beauty, such as in Sheffield-born Mary Hutton’s On Reading a Beautiful Poem, Called “The Snow,” by Charles Swain, Esq.\n\nOne of my favourite discoveries is a poem by William Todd — a Yorkshire farm labourer not previously known to scholars, whose Cottage Lays was acquired by Special Collections just days before my visit. His flagship poem, Heaven’s Boon And Earth’s Bliss; A Poem on the Sabbath, draws an interesting link between intensive industrial production and environmental rupture. Defending Sundays from the encroachment of factory work — as a day of rest more than ever vital for man’s survival — Todd’s dramatisation of a steam train coming over ‘yonder bridge’ is dramatised into an apocalyptic sign of the times:\n\n’Tis man, frail mortal man, that’s leap’d his bounds,\n\nAnd broke the quiet of this holy day.\n\nHe’s yonder coming on his flying wheels;\n\nHe’s here! He’s gone! He’s fled, far, far, away.\n\nWhat makes him fly with such rapidity?\n\nIs some vast continent struck into flames?\n\nAnd has he gone to tell the direful news\n\nTo the remotest bounds of this, our world?\n\nThese lines shed an interesting light on the role we might imagine religion had in radical politics as well as the emergence of environmental sensitivities. Todd writes — one assumes with irony — that the only conceivable cause of such ‘rapidity’ could be to tell news of ‘some vast content struck into flames’, which reads rather prophetically in light of the atmospheric effects of carbon-fuelled technologies. Echoing Constantine’s sense of steam’s ‘precedence […] o’er the earth’, did Todd dimly view what was on the horizon?"
