        "text": "THE architect Charles William Hutton, who died aged 90, was born in\n\nAnnan, Dumfriesshire. His father was a ship-building engineer and Hutton\n\nspent his early years in Sheffield, then in Glasgow, where he attended\n\nBellahouston Academy.\n\nHis early talent for art was encouraged at Bellahouston and he\n\nsubsequently became apprenticed to a Bolton architect and successfully\n\ngained a scholarship to study architecture at the Liverpool School under\n\nProfessor Charles Reilly.\n\nThe emphasis in the school was on the classicising tendency of the\n\nEcole des Beaux Arts, an influence which is evident in his war memorial\n\nat Rawmarsh, Yorkshire, which was built in 1926. However, this work also\n\npresaged a more progressive tendency which would find its expression in\n\nhis subsequent London works.\n\nFrom 1929 to 1936 he was chief assistant to Doctor Charles Holden.\n\nHolden, steeped in the English Arts and Crafts tradition, was also\n\nheavily influenced by his visits to Holland, Germany, and Scandinavia\n\nwhich brought a clarity and power of expression, evident in the large\n\nnumber of underground stations which the practice created for the\n\nPiccadilly Line and elsewhere.\n\nPerhaps the best-known of these is Arnos Grove Station, a composition\n\nof brick, reinforced concrete, and metal windows, in the form of a drum\n\nupon a block, which powerfully exhibits the influence of Gunnar Asplund,\n\nthe most important Swedish architect of the twentieth century.\n\nWhile he was heavily involved in the creation of underground stations,\n\nHutton's most notable work from this period with Holden is the\n\nspectacular Senate House at London University.\n\nDuring the late 1930s Charles Hutton returned to Liverpool to teach in\n\nthe Architectural School and he also taught in what is among the most\n\ninternationally known of architecture schools, the Architectural\n\nAssociation of London.\n\nThe level of respect in which Hutton was held is indicated by his\n\nsubsequent position as deputy to Sir William Holford (later Lord\n\nHolford). He worked with Holford to create munitions factories in Kirby,\n\nWalsall, and Wolverhampton. Just before the end of the War, Hutton\n\nopened his own practice in Welwyn Garden City.\n\nHis subsequent practice created the Murphy Radio Factory at Welwyn,\n\nthe Oxford University Field Station, and a number of notable industrial\n\nand school buildings. In all of these, Hutton's translation of\n\ntraditional idioms and building techniques into carefully balanced and\n\nmore contemporary forms is apparent, his eye for detail always to the\n\nfore.\n\nIn his late years, Hutton spent a great deal of time at the Art\n\nWorkers' Guild which he had joined in 1951. He was made Master in 1968,\n\nand worked for a further 20 years as the guild's honorary architect."
