        "text": "Manuscript catalogs of Dr. Charles Hutton's books, each volume in a single hand, arranged in alphabetical order and including information on place and date of publication, size, and number of volumes. The first volume contains books from his general library and includes a large number of volumes on scientific subjects, on algebra, geometry, physics, mathematics, navigation, and astronomy as well as biographies of scientific philosophers. The library also contains literary works such as Beggar's Opera and Polly, with the music; Congreve's works; and La Fontaine's works; travel diaries and narratives including those of Cook's yoyages; a biography of Benjamin Franklin and collection of his works; and works on military history. At the end of the manuscript is a tally in pencil showing totals of 2193 articles and 3315 volumes. The second volume contains only mathematical and scientific works in Hutton's library, which also appear in the first volume"
