I did feel like you were\n\ntalking to children, but it’s early days for your show, and this\n\nwill change over time.\n\nThere was a show here in Australia many years ago, called “The\n\nCuriosity Show”, basically it was a group of scientists that educated\n\npeople by conducting experiments and explaining scientific\n\nprinciples, but still having fun. The way they presented would be\n\nvery effective with your show.\n\nHere’s an example :- The Curiosity Show: How A Thermos Works - YouTube\n\nI liked your show. Loved the bloopers.\n\nRegards Charles\n\nJust wanted to let everyone know the next episode is available.\n\nhttp://www.2dezineart.com/2dezineartTV\n\nI want to thank everyone for their support. And if you click on the\n\nword comments below the video you can leave your comments and\n\nsuggestions…\n\nGary F. Martin Ph.D.\n\nBad Frog Creative"
