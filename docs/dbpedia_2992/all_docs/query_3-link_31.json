        "text": "This biography of the Stuart Restoration King Charles II was recommended by the author of another book I was reading for research. He said it was the best biography on this king that he had found. That was enough of an endorsement for me.\n\nMr. Hutton was a reader in History at the University of Bristol at the time of publication (1989). This was ten years after Lady Antonia Fraser’s magnificent biography of Charles II was published. Hutton’s book is completely different from Fraser’s although he gives her great praise for her work. The difference is, Hutton relies entirely on primary sources to tell the story consisting mostly of letters.\n\nThis volume is an in-depth examination of the politics of the reign of Charles II, including Scotland and Wales. While he covers the life of the king, it explains more about the men who surrounded him and helped him rule his three kingdoms. If you are looking for personal details, Fraser’s book would be more relevant. Hutton is looking for who surrounded the king, who gave him advice, and how did Charles make decisions. The lives of the councilors can sometimes be as fascinating as that of the king.\n\nThis is not an easy read. At times it was a little dry and some of the politics could be confusing. It helps to have a working knowledge and background on the era. But I found Hutton’s insight into the personalities of the king, queen, Charles’ mistresses and the men who surrounded him to be very absorbing.\n\nThe final chapter supplies the author’s conclusions upon the virtues, vices and achievements of Charles II. He states he realized early on he was dealing with a legendary figure. In constructing his view of Charles, he tried to use only what was said about him by his contemporaries and weed out the material that was apocryphal. Hutton has done a remarkable job. I now have an improved understanding of this king and his reign."
