After his service in World War II and subsequent graduation from Pitt, Charles married the love of his life, Muriel Louise Thompson and moved to Illinois.   Dr & Mrs Hutton eventually moved to Atlanta, Ga, where he was Director of Audiology and Speech Pathology at the VA Medical Center in Decatur until his retirement.  Dr. and Mrs. Hutton were long-time members of Decatur Presbyterian Church, where they formed many strong and treasured friendships.
