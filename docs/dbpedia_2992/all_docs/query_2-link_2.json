        "text": "When he died in the spring of 1823, Charles Hutton had become a national celebrity. His death was reported in all the London newspapers – and many provincial ones. He was the subject of lengthy printed eulogies, both in the capital and in his home town, Newcastle upon Tyne.\n\nThe Gentleman’s Magazine called him: ‘One of the most efficient promoters of mathematical knowledge in any age or country.’ Sir Humphry Davy wrote: ‘One of the most able mathematicians of his country and his age’ and the Literary Chronicle described him as, ‘a great man … dear to science, whose memory will long be revered’.\n\nFriends and colleagues lined up to say how much he had achieved and how his work would never be forgotten. Today, it is. So who was Charles Hutton?"
