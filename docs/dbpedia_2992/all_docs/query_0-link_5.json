        "text": "Village in Scottish Borders, Scotland\n\nHuman settlement in Scotland\n\nHutton is a small village in the Scottish Borders region of Scotland. Historically part of Berwickshire, it is a traditional, country village surrounded by farmland.\n\nHutton lies one mile west of Paxton and two miles west of the border with Northumberland. Its closest market towns are Duns and Berwick-upon-Tweed.\n\nThe village hall was recently redeveloped and is used for social events. Hutton Primary School was closed in June 2005 after numbers fell to 15 pupils, on the basis of cost. The village, however, thrives, with a local church, park and friendly traditional atmosphere.\n\nThe Church at Hutton was dedicated by David de Bernham who was the Bishop of St Andrews on 6 April 1243. In 1652 seating was installed within the Parish Church, it is thought that it was the original church that had the seats installed. Before the seating was installed members of the congregation brought their own seats. Between the years of 1655 and 1660 Hutton Old Parish Church underwent repairs which included the addition of a gallery on the west side of the church and the roof being re-thatched.\n\nIn 1765 a new church was built to replace Hutton Old Parish Church. The new Church had seating for 400 people. The church had an earthen floor, un-plastered walls no ceiling and a thatched roof. A paved floor was laid in 1791 along with the plastering of the walls and ceiling. This church was demolished in 1834. At this time the church was said to be in a state of disrepair bordering on ruinous.\n\nThe present Church, built in 1835 by Ignatius Bonomi, is an impressive Romanesque Revival edifice inspired by Norham Church (where Bonomi also worked).\n\nThe bell bears the following inscription:\n\nSOLI . DEO . GLORIA . IOHANNES . BURGERHUYS . ME . FECIT . 1661 .\n\nChurchyard - rather overgrown and atmospheric, with mainly 18th- and 19th-century memorials.\n\nNoteworthy:\n\nJames Frisken, 1712, a full-length portrait surrounded by angels' heads and memento mori\n\nJohn Burn, 1733, a full-length portrait with open book\n\nHutton Hall (castle) Burial Vault, north-west of the church, thought to be 17th-century\n\nThe former manse, Antrim House, sits north-west of the church (John Lessels 1876).\n\nConstance, Lady Burrell financed the erection of a new parish church hall in 1931.\n\nWhen the false warning of Napoleon's invasion in 1804 was sent out from the beacon station at Hume Castle, the volunteers from the district made Hutton their rallying-point, and spent a night under arms in the old church.\n\nIn more recent history it became popular with Polish soldiers after they were posted to nearby Winfield camp in World War II. After demobilization some continued to live in the village.\n\nTraditional:\n\nHutton for old wives,\n\nBroadmeadows for swine,\n\nPaxton for drucken wives\n\nAnd salmon sae fine.\n\nCrossrig for lint and woo'\n\nSpittal for kale,\n\nSunwick for cakes and cheese\n\nAnd lasses for sale.\n\nJohn Blair (1849-1934), Scottish landscape artist, was born there.\n\nAndrew Forman (1465-1521), Archbishop of St Andrews.\n\nShipping magnate and philanthropist Sir William Burrell owned nearby Hutton Castle, and died there in 1958.\n\nDudley Marjoribanks, 1st Baron Tweedmouth bought Hutton Hall estate in 1876.\n\nThe famous Wojtek (soldier bear) was stationed in Hutton during World War II.\n\nSir William and Constance, Lady Burrell attended the church.\n\nHutton Castle\n\nPaxton House\n\nJames Hutton\n\nLost Houses of Scotland, by Marcus Biney, John Harris, & Emma Winnington, for SAVE Britain's Heritage, London, July 1980, ISBN 0-905978-05-6\n\nBorders and Berwick by Charles Alexander Strang, The Rutland Press, 1994, ISBN 1-873190-10-7\n\nThe Buildings of Scotland - Borders, by Kitty Cruft, John Dunbar and Richard Fawcett, Yale University Press, 2006, ISBN 0-300-10702-1\n\nThe Scottish Nation - Or the Surnames, Families, Literature, Honours and Biographical History of The People of Scotland,\n\nBy William Anderson 1863"
