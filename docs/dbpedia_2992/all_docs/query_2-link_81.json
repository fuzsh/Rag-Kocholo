        "text": "QuestionAnswer Darwin noticed that many organisms seemed well suited to Surviving in the environment they inhabited On the Galapagos islands, Charles Darwin observed Somewhat similar species, with traits that suited their particular environments The species of finches that Charles Darwin found on the Galapagos Islands displayed different structural adaptations. One of the adaptations that Darwin noted was the Birds different shaped beaks Based on the adaptations Charles Darwin observed in finches and tortoises in the Galapagos he wondered if species living on different islands had once been memebers of the same species Darwin began to formulate his concept of evolution by natural selection after Observations of many species and their geographical location James Hutton's and Charles Lyell's work suggests that Earth is many millions of years old In the 1800's Charles Lyell emphasized that past geological events must be explained in terms of processes observable today James Hutton's and Charles Lyell's work was important to Darwin because these scientists Suggested that Earth was old enough for evolution to have occured Jean Baptiste Lamarck proposed that organisms Have an innate tendency toward complexity and perfection Which is a major concept included in Lamarck's theory of evolution? Body structure can change according to the actions of the organisms Lamarck's theory of evolution includes the concept that new organs in a species appear as a result of The actions of organisms as they use or fail to use body structures The idea that only famine, disease, and war could prevent the endless growth of human populations was presented by Thomas Malthus Darwin realized that the economist Malthus's theory of population control could be generalized to any population of organisms In 1859 Charles Darwin published his revolutionary scientific ideas in a work titled on the origin of species Darwin was prompted to publish his theory of evolution by an essay by Wallace on evolution Why might Darwin have hesitated to publish his concept of evolution by natural selection? He was disturbed by his findings, which challenged fundamental scientific beliefs Charles Darwin's observation that finches of different species on the Galapagos Islands have many similar physical characteristics supports the hypothesis that these finches Descended from a common ancestor According to Darwin's theory of natural selection, individuals who survive are the ones best adapted for their environment. Their survival is due to the possession of inherited adaptations that maximize fitness When farmers select animals or plants to use for breeding, they look for natural variations that are present in a species when a farmer breeds only his or her best livestock, the process involved is artificial selection Which statement about the members of a population that live long enough to reproduce is consistent with the theory of natural selection? They are the ones that are best adapted to survive in their environment Charles Darwin called the ability of an organism to survive and reproduce in its specififc environment fitness According to Darwins theory of natural selection, the individuals that tend to survive are those that have variations best suited to the environment Which of the following phrases best describes the results of natural selection? Changes in the inherited characteristics of a population over time An adaptation is an inherited characteristic that can be Physical or behavioral Modern sea star larvae resemble some primitive vertebrate larvae. This similarity may suggest that primitive vertebrates Share a common ancestor with sea stars Darwin's concept of evolution was NOT influenced by knowledge about the structure of DNA People of Charles Darwin's time understood that fossils were preserved remains of ancient organisms The number and location of bones of many fossil vertebrates are similar to those in living vertebrates. Most biologists would probably explain this fact on the basis of A common ancestor Charles Darwin viewed the fossil record as A detailed record of evolution The hypothesis that species change over time by natural selection was proposed by Charles Darwin Darwins theory of evolution suggests that Species change over time Which phrase best defines evolution by natural selection? A process of change in species over time James Hutton and Charles Lyell held similar views about Earth's age. Both thought that Earth was _______ of years old Millions The geologist ________ proposed that past changes in Earth must be explained in terms of events and processes observable today Lyell According to Lamarck, evolution resulted from the inheritance of ____________ traits aquired According to_______'s theory of the inheritance of acquired traits, the long legs of certain shore birds could be acquired by frequent wading in water and then passed on to offspring Lamarck Charles Darwin observed that instead of being perfect and unchanging, individuals in a species show ___________ variation Charles Darwin concluded that, in similar environments around the world, ____________________ could produce similar structures in unrelated species natural selection Certain animal structures that have different functions in different species and develop from the same embryonic tissues are called____________ structures. Homolygous According to Darwins theory of evolution, _________ change over time Species Differences in turtle bodies? Differs depending on island they live on"
