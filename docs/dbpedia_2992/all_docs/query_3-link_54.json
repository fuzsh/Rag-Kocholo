Mr Ivison, a clergyman of the English Church; and on Mr Ivison's removal to a curacy in the county of Durham, Mr Hutton succeeded him in his school at Jesmond. In fact Hutton did work for a short time at Old Long Benton colliery between the time Mr Ivison left the school and when Hutton succeeded him. He was so successful in this school in Jesmond that he soon moved to larger premises in the neighbourhood. At this stage Hutton began studying mathematics at evening classes at Mr James' school in Newcastle. In 1760 Hutton opened the Mathematical School in Newcastle but he also taught at the main secondary school in the city. He was fortunate to have a number of private pupils from the local land owning families who helped further his career. Riddle tells us that [7]:- ... his manners, as well as his talents, rendered him acceptable as a private teacher in the families of the higher classes.Charles Hutton (14 August 1737  27 January 1823) Hutton was born in Newcastle, the youngest son of an overviewer (supervisor) of a coal mine. When he was seven, Hutton was involved in a street-brawl and severely dislocated his left elbow. He hid this injury from his parents and by the time they learned of it, it was too late to treat it properly, so the injury became permanent. Since Hutton was unable to join his older brothers in the mine, he was sent to school to learn to read. After several years the teacher left and Hutton replaced him, thus beginning a habit of teaching by day and learning by night. In 1760, Hutton opened his own school in Newcastle. This became a success and he became known as an excellent teacher. His patron, Shafto, suggested that he should move to London and apply for a vacancy at the Royal Military Academy in Woolich. The position was to be filled by competitive examination. Bishop Horsley, the editor of Newtons works, and Nevel Maskelyn, the Astronomer Royal, examined the eleven candidates. Half were judged satisfactory for the post, but Hutton stood out, so he obtained this professorship in 1773. He remained at Woolich for 34 years.\n\nStudent Questions on Chapter 1\n\nPlace your practice question for Chapter 1 in this exam. You can write a multiple choice, matching, or essay question.

Previously he had begun a small periodical, Miscellane Mathematica, which extended only to thirteen numbers; subse quently he published in five volumes The Diarian Miscellany i which contained large extracts from the Diary. He resigne his professorship in 1807, and died on the 27th of January 1823 See John Bruce, Charles Hutton (Newcastle, 1823). It was not merely the earth to which Hutton directed his attention. He had long studied the changes of the atmosphere. The same volume in which his Theory of the Earth appeared contained also a Theory of Rain, which was read to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1784. He contended that the amount of moisture which the air can retain in solution increases witl~ augmentation of temperature, and, therefore, that on thf mixture of two masses of air of different temperatures a portior of the moisture must be condensed and appear in visible form He investigated the available data regarding rainfall and climati in different regions of the globe, and came to the conclusior that the rainfall is everywhere reaulated by the humidity of thi air on the one hand, and the causes which promote mixtures of different aerial currents in the higher atmosphere on the other.Plan du site Index des notules\n\nNotule bibliographique\n\nHutton, Charles, A Mathematical and Philosophical Dictionary , 4 vol., Thoemmes, octobre 2000.

Its origins can be precisely dated to a meeting on Thursday 4 December in that year in Robertson's Tavern in Milne's Close off the: Lawnmarket of eleven members of a class in mineralogy. These even Edinburgh citizens whose names are all recorded, resolved to start a society for'discussion an d Mutual Instruction, to meet in the Mr Rose's house, 2 Drummond Street, every Monday evening at half past eight'. Alexander Rose (1781-1860), a wood turner and mineral dealer, conducted classes in mineralogy in Edinburgh under the auspices of Queen's College, a teaching association existing in the city at that time. Later, as the Society developed, it came to occupy rooms first at 5 St Andrew Square and then in the Synod Hall in Castle Terrace (Butcher, 1991) before the present arrangements came into being in the 1960s. In contrast to the prominence enjoyed by Charles Lyell, in both his life and death, James Hutton fell into some obscurity on his death in Edinburgh in 1797. Of course, John Playfair (1748-1819) promoted Hutton's life and work after Hutton's death, but in a sense he did Hutton a disservice in that later authors, including Lyell, relied on Playfair's account of Hutton and did not read the original texts for themselves. Dennis Dean (1992, p. 229) has made the interesting observation that 'the Edinburgh Geological Society .... was so obviously Huttonian that it effectively superseded the almost moribund Wernerian Society.' However, the Wernerian Natural History Society, founded in Edinburgh by Robert Jameson (1774-1854) in 1808, catered for a different membership to that of the Edinburgh Geological Society in its early years.\n\nElton Engineering Books\n\nHUTTON, Charles Tracts on mathematical and philosophical subjects; comprising, among numerous important articles, the theory of bridges, with several plans of recent improvement.

The second part was in the Department of Mathematical Sciences. Below you will find information about the books that were on display in the department. Most of these books were chosen because they bear on undergraduate mathematics, but there are a few old treasures that have been included for their own sake. Some of these books were chosen because these copies have interesting characteristics, some of which are noted in annotations. When handling these books please use extreme care.
