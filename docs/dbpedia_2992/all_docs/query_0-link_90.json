Three of his brothers were executed by the English in 1306 and 1307. His sister Isabel married Eric II Magnusson, King of Norway and his brother, Edward, became King of Ireland in 1316.[4]\n\nAs a child he was tutored to speak, read, and write in French and to have a working knowledge of Latin.[6] The significant effect that a love of books and history had on Robert's life cannot be overstated: Barbour recounted how Bruce read aloud to his band of supporters while they were on the run in 1306 and recited from memory twelfth century tales of Charlemagne, and the exploits of Hannibal.[7] A (later) parliamentary briefing document dated c.1364 mentioned that Robert \"used continually to read, or have read in his presence, the histories of ancient kings and princes....both in wartime and in peacetime, and from these he derived information about aspects of his own rule.\"[8]\n\nThe Bruce brothers followed the traditional practice in Carrick of being fostered to allied Gaelic kindred to complete their education in knightly arts such as jousting, hunting, leadership skills, and even courtly behavior.[9] There are indications that Robert's maternal grandfather, Earl Neil, had married a daughter of the Ó Néill kings of Tyrone,[10] and his family was also connected to the noble houses of de Burgh in Ulster and the de Clares of Thomand.[11] Although it is not known precisely which family Robert fostered with, it was likely to have been with one of these families or, as was the case with his brother Edward, with a family connection in Ireland itself.[9] Barbour does mention \"an unnamed foster brother\" who accompanied him on his run through Carrick in 1307-8.[12] It is notable that one of Robert's first actions, after becoming king of Scots, was to seek military assistance in Ireland.[13] In a letter (still preserved) to \"all the kings of Ireland, the prelates and clergy, and all the inhabitants of Ireland\" he talked about sharing the same ancestry, and \"being linked to the Irish by a common language and customs.\"[14]\n\nKing of Scots\n\nBoth Robert and his father remained loyal to Edward I, the English king, until at least 1297.[15][16] In the summer of that year he joined the revolt against the English occupation of Scotland, and for the next four years became one of the leaders of the rebel cause.[15] By August 1299, he and his arch-rival, John Comyn of Badenoch (who was a staunch supporter of King John Baliol), had been appointed co-guardians of the Kingdom of Scotland.[1][17] The following year, however, the tension between Bruce and Comyn reached a boiling point and during one particularly contentious meeting they had to be physically pulled apart and restrained by James the Steward and other nobles who were present.[2][15]\n\nThe period from 1302-1304 saw Bruce no longer acting as a guardian of the kingdom and once again pledging fealty to Edward I, perhaps in an effort to stabilize family relationships between Carrick and Ulster.[15] In return for renewing his homage to Edward, the king pardoned Bruce and his men, promised to protect his landed inheritance both in England and in Scotland, and also promised to support his legal pursuit of 'the right of' his family (i.e. their unnamed claim to the Scottish throne).[18] During this time Bruce married (as his second wife) Elizabeth, daugher of Richard de Burgh, the Red Earl of Ulster.[15] He also attended the English parliament and served as sheriff of Lanark.[15] In September 1305, the English parliament passed an ordinance appointing a commission consisting of Bruce, the bishops of St Andrews and Glasgow, and John Comyn of Badenoch to assist an English lieutenant in administering the government of Scotland.[15] This plan was never carried out.\n\nOn 10 February 1306, Bruce met Comyn of Badenoch at the Franciscan church at Dumfries, and once again the two quarrelled violently.[19] Comyn was fatally stabbed,[20] resulting in the large and politically powerful Comyn family becoming from that moment onward Bruce's mortal enemies.[15] Bruce moved immediately to consolidate power by seizing the castles of Dumfries, Dalwinton, Tibbers and Ayr, then securing five of the fortresses which commanded the Firth of Clyde and were strategically necessary to be able to receive supplies from Ireland.[21] Word was quickly spread throughout the countryside that he would be coronated at Scone by the end of the following month.[15]\n\nOn 27 March 1306, in the presence of the bishops of St Andrews, Glasgow, and Moray, and the earls of Lennox, Atholl, and Errol,[16] Robert I was formally crowned at Scone.[1][20][22]\n\nSignificant Accomplishments of his Reign\n\nRobert I's reign lasted just over twenty-three years,[2] almost all of those years spent at war with England as Scotland struggled for independence. The details of the many battles lost and won during this time have been recounted at length by numerous historians and will not be further elaborated here. Robert the Bruce became reknown, first and foremost, for his brilliant military leadership which eventually freed his people and led to Scotland's independence.[23][24] He was recognized both for his personal style of leadership, usually on the front lines of every battle, and his willingness to take unexpected risks, often making shrewd strategic decisions that led his men (against all odds) to victory.[15][24] His long struggle culminated on 17 March 1328 when the Treaty of Edinburgh was signed, and England for the first time recognized Scotland as a free realm.[15]\n\nHis reign was characterized by a radical realignment of the lordships throughout Scotland: he both rewarded his most loyal supporters with large grants of land and titles, and also attempted to bring about a reconciliation with some of his opponents by giving them an opportunity to recover some of the lands they had lost.[25] It proved difficult, however, to satisfy everyone and in 1320 there was a plot (the Soules Conspiracy) to restore the fortunes of several families whose lands had been redistributed, and place William de Soules on the throne.[26][27] On August 4th a Black Parliament was held at Scone to hear charges of treason against these conspirators.[27]\n\nA key goal was to oversee the restoration of the Scottish government, initiating extensive rebuilding projects both to restore economic hubs (such as Berwick and Aberdeen) and also to restore important monastic communities (such as Scone, Dunfermline, Holyrood, and Melrose).[28] To accomplish this, he drew together large groups consisting of nobles, rural freeholders, burgh leaders, craftsmen, secular and clerical leaders, and jurists to assist in formulating plans and devising a means of funding these projects.[29] This attempt to restore the kingdom by gaining a consensus among its people was a reflection of the Bruce's ability, often seen during battle, to think outside of the box. It was a revolutionary approach. His rule has subsequently been described as \"an astute mixture of authoritarian action with timely assurances, concessions, and genuine governmental consultation.\"[30] It is no wonder why so many of his people loved him, or why he became a national hero.\n\nMarriage to Isabella Mar\n\nRobert married (first) about 1295 to Isabella of Mar, daughter of Sir Donald of Mar, 10th Earl of Mar[3][31][1] and his wife, Helen.[32] A close alliance with the earldom of Mar was an important political move for the Bruces, Isabella's brother Gartrait of Mar had previously married one of Robert's sisters, Christian, and that marriage had already produced an heir.[33] Robert and Isabella had one daughter:\n\nMarjory Bruce (or Marjorie);[34] b. c 1296; [35] m. 2 Mar 1315 Sir Walter Stewart (aka Walter the high steward)[36][37] d. 2 March 1315/6.[38][1]\n\nIsabella died in 1296, presumably giving birth to their daughter.[35]\n\nMarriage to Elizabeth de Burgh\n\nRobert married (second) in 1302 to Elizabeth de Burgh,[32] daughter of Sir Richard de Burgh,[39][1] 3rd Earl of Ulster, lord of Connaught, and his wife, Margaret.[3][32] There were four children from this marriage:\n\nDavid II, King of Scots;[1][40] b. 5 March 1324; m(1) 17 July 1328 Joan of the Tower, daughter of Edward II ;[41] m(2) 20 Feb 1364 Margaret de Drummond;[42] d. 22 February 1371[43]\n\nJohn Bruce, b. 5 Mar 1324 (twin brother to David II);[44] d. in childhood,[1] buried at the Priory at Restennet in Forfarshire, Scotland.\n\nMargaret Bruce; b. c1315;[45] m. William de Moray, 5th earl of Sutherland;[46][47]d. aft. 30 March 1346.[46][48]\n\nMaud Bruce (aka Matilda); m. bef. 1345 Thomas de Isaac;[49] d. 20 July 1353.[38][1]\n\nElizabeth died at Cullen, Aberdeenshire on 26 October 1327 and was buried at Dunfermline, Fife.[50][51][52]\n\n______________\n\nRobert had at least two sons and three daughters by an unknown mistress or mistresses:[15][53]\n\nRobert Bruce, Knt., of Liddesdale; d. 12 Aug 1332 at Battle of Dupplin[53][38][1]\n\nNeil Bruce (aka Nigel) of Carrick; d. 17 Oct 1346 at Battle of Durham[54][38][1]\n\nMargaret Bruce; m. Robert Glen; d. aft 29 February 1363/4.[55][38][1]\n\nElizabeth Bruce; m. bef 1364 Sir Walter Oliphant[56][38][1]\n\nChristian Bruce of Carrick;[1] had a pension in 1328 and 1329. [57][38]\n\nDeath and Burial\n\nRobert I, King of Scots, died at Cardross, Dunbartonshire 7 June 1329,[50][58][59] and was buried in the middle of the choir before the high altar [in] the abbey church of Dunfermline, Fife.\"[60][1] (see Research Notes)\n\nBy a letter dated 11 May 1329, the king directed that his heart be buried in the monastery of Melrose, and on his deathbed in June 1329 he made his lieutenant and friend, Sir James Douglas, swear that he would carry the [king's] heart \"against the enemies of the name of Christ\".[60][61] Sir James kept his promise, taking Robert's heart to the Holy Land, but only reached Granada in Spain, where he was killed in August 1330.[15] The King's heart was returned from Spain by Sir William Keith and was buried at the monastery of Melrose.[38][62]\n\nInscribed around the top of his tomb at Dunfermline (and later preserved in the margins of the manuscript of the Scotichronicon[63]) was engraved the following epitaph:\n\nHere lies the invincible blessed King Robert. Whoever reads about his feats will repeat the many battles he fought. By his integrity he guided to liberty the kingdom of the Scots. May he now live in Heaven.[64]\n\nRobert I was succeeded by his young son, David II. [42] Robert's grandson, Robert II, who succeeded David, was the first king of the Stewart house of English and Scottish royalty.[15]\n\nResearch Notes\n\nBirthplace of Robert de Brus:\n\nRobert the Bruce's birthplace has been traditionally given as Turnberry, the sea-castle belonging to the ancient earldom of Carrick in southern Ayrshire.[65][15] However, no early historians (including works such as Patrick Gordon's Famous Historie of the Renown'd and Valiant Prince Robert sirnamed the Bruce, (1613), John Harvey's The Life of Robert Bruce, (Edinburgh, 1727), and the nineteenth century historians Lord Hailes, Patrick Tytler, and Walter Scott) appear to have named a specific birthplace for him.[66] The first time that Turnberry was cited as the Bruce's birth place was in the late Victorian period, in A.F. Murison's King Robert the Bruce (Edinburgh, 1899).[66] More recently, historians have rediscovered a fourteenth century English chronicle written by Geoffrey 'the Baker' of Swinbroke, who was connected to the de Bohun earls of Hereford, which states that Robert was born in the former English Royal manor of Writtle in Essex.[67] Writtle had been in the possession of the Bruce family since shortly after 1237,[68] and its importance to Robert was signified by the fact that it was the only English land which he demanded be restored to him in peace talks in November 1324.[69]\n\nWalter of Odistown erroneously listed as son of Robert I:\n\nSir James Dunbar Paul, the Lord Lyon, notes that Walter of Odistown was inserted by error as a son of Robert I in Sir Archibald Dunbar's Scottish Kings,[38] \"owing to [Dunbar's copying] a mistake in the preface to the Exchequer Rolls.[70] He was not a son of King Robert I.[1]\n\nCause of death:\n\nLater historians, based primarily on what was believed to be the exhumation of Robert the Bruce's skeleton in 1819, hypothesized that Bruce had suffered from leprosy.[71] The report issued originally by Sir Henry Jardine, the King's Remembrancer, which advanced this conclusion has since been criticized by more recent scholars for a number of reasons: 1) It has not been proved beyond a doubt that the grave exhumed belonged to Robert the Bruce. Fordun mentioned Bruce's tomb being before the high altar, but Bower noted that, because it blocked the performance of the liturgy, it was later moved to the aisle before the choir and buried next to his wife, the Queen Elizabeth.[72][73] It is just as logical to conclude that the grave which was exhumed belonged to the king who had raised the house to abbatical status and built the choir, King David I.[74] 2) Many royals and aristocrats during that period engaged in the tradition of separate heart burial,[75] so that is not sufficient alone to identify the body as Robert the Bruce.[73] 3) The metal plate found near the grave which was inscribed Robertus Scotorum Rex was discovered (half a century later) to be a forgery done by a young artist and one of his friends, who was an Edinburgh printer.[76]\n\nThe noted historian and scientist Karl Pearson has criticized early writers who suggested that Bruce \"contracted leprosy during the hard life of his earlier struggles\" and pointed out that leprosy is not contracted by \"living a hard life,\" but by being in contact with lepers.[77] He suggested that Bruce was more likely to have suffered from sporadic syphilis, which during that period may have easily been confused with leprosy.[77] The eminent historian Michael Penman noted that although leprosy, \"the unclean sickness\", was greatly feared and loathed it was significant that none of the Bruce's worst enemies ever referred to him as a leper.[78] What is known is that the Bruce held parliaments, travelled extensively throughout the kingdom, and fathered a large number of children apparently without exhibiting any symptoms of being a leper.[79] It is not possible to determine precisely what caused the Bruce's death at the age of fifty-four. Recent scholarship suggests it may have been either sporadic syphilis or extra-pulmonary tuberculosis. The latter can be asymptomatic for years, and can cause weight loss, fever, a chronic cough, and scrofula (swelling masses around the neck).[79] Stevens-17832 00:53, 5 January 2023 (UTC)\n\nSources\n\n↑ 1.00 1.01 1.02 1.03 1.04 1.05 1.06 1.07 1.08 1.09 1.10 1.11 1.12 1.13 1.14 1.15 Paul, Sir James Balfour.
