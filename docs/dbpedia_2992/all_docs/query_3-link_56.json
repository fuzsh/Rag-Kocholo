        "text": "Steven Poole reviews Gunpowder & Geometry by Benjamin Wardhaugh\n\nIn the 19th century, mathematics became known as “the queen of the sciences”, and it remains the most respectably hardcore intellectual discipline, one that undergirds advances in science, technology, and increasingly medicine. If you have great maths chops you can change the world – or run a hedge fund.\n\nThe man who promoted the subject to royalty, Carl Friedrich Gauss, might have been biased since he was himself a mathematician. But there was a time before him when many, at least in Britain, considered maths to be merely a bean-counting poor relation of natural philosophy. And that culture began to change only thanks to the efforts of one remarkable man, who began his working life as a Newcastle pit-boy.\n\nSo, at least, runs the argument of Benjamin Wardhaugh’s absorbing biography. Charles Hutton was born in 1737, and spent some time as a boy opening trapdoors in the mines. He showed great intellectual capacity at school, but found himself back working in the pit at the age of 18, until a reprieve appeared in the form of a post as country schoolmaster. From then on, he determined to refashion himself as not just a teacher, but a teacher of teachers.\n\nHis first book, The Schoolmasters Guide, or a Complete System of Practical Arithmetic, was published in 1764, followed by his 1770 Treatise on Mensuration both in Theory and Practice (or “measuring”, in geometry and applied fields such as surveying).\n\nIn 1772 he added to these a monograph on The Principles of Bridges, despite an apparent near-total lack of acquaintance with the principles. Even so, decades later he was consulted by the Corporation of London on the construction of London Bridge, such was his renown, his name by then a byword in Britain for mathematical expertise.\n\nThis Hutton achieved through a programme of relentless work and self-betterment. In his early teaching days, he picked up several European languages, and bombarded The Ladies’ Diary – which, in one of those curios of history, was actually an annual compendium of mathematics problems – with elegant solutions, while his books (apart from the one on bridges) enjoyed admiring notices and sold respectably.\n\nThen, down in London one day, he heard from a friend that the post of professor of mathematics at the Royal Military Academy in Woolwich was becoming vacant. “Plenty of people wanted it,” Wardhaugh writes of the job with characteristic irony, “and quite probably some of them knew some mathematics.” Hutton prevailed, and he was on his way.\n\nThe duties at the military academy included dealing with unruly cadets (some of whom, we learn, “indulged a tendency to riot”), but while the other professors there exhibited an alarming tendency to skive off, Hutton set about a programme of useful research. He fired cannons at pendulums; later, he mounted cannons on pendulums themselves and fired them at other pendulums.\n\nFor a long time he sought a definitive theory of how air resistance affected the flight of cannonballs, but it proved elusive. He did draw up, however, useful rules of thumb in his manuals. Wardhaugh credits him with transforming the British military into a more scientific entity than it had hitherto been, and in particular with overhauling the Royal Artillery into a fearsome force in the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nIn the meantime, the former miner had in 1774 been elected a fellow of the Royal Society, which leads to the driest passages in this otherwise colourful book, as the reader becomes gradually stupefied by accounts of long-gone office politics. (In brief: the society’s then-president, Joseph Banks, did not think much of mathematics or indeed mathematicians.)\n\nLuckily it is not long before we are back to firing big guns down the Thames to measure the lateral wandering of the shot. (Wardhaugh does not tell us whether such exercises resulted in the accidental sinking of boats, but experiments back then were free of such health-and-safety niggles.)\n\nWhat is Hutton’s legacy? He is credited with making the first informed estimate of the mass of the Earth – using data gathered on an expedition to Scotland to measure the gravitational attraction of a mountain – but he left no major mark on the field of mathematics itself. Instead, as this book argues persuasively, he changed a whole culture: by simple dint of his genial celebrity as well as a europhile passion for developments in France and elsewhere, he helped to elevate mathematics to a rank equal with the other sciences.\n\nIt is impossible not to warm to such a man in Wardhaugh’s wryly sympathetic telling, even with the revelation of some of his more outrageous peccadilloes – for example, he began to put it about that he was related to Isaac Newton. In his retirement years, Hutton was struck by family bereavements, but still pressed on with projects.\n\nAs Wardhaugh writes, he “protested more and more strongly that his only desire was to be of use to his country… but it is difficult not to detect, in some of his activities, at least the supplementary desire to build monuments to Charles Hutton”. By the end of this spirited and elegantly erudite book, you don’t begrudge him that desire one bit."
