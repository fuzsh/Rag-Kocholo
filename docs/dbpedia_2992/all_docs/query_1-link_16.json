        "text": "One of the biggest stereotypes being challenged today can be summed up as “Girls don’t play guitar.”\n\nToday, women in American popular music (which includes everything from pop to hip-hop) are largely confined to the singer-songwriter lane. Looking back at our musical history canon, it would seem like it was always that way. The great female stars of jazz, swing, and blues were all singers — at least the ones we hear about.\n\nYou could replace the word “guitar” and say, “Girls don’t play the drums…or piano…or trumpet…” and the message is the same.\n\nOnly, it wasn’t actually that way. There were great female composers, bandleaders, and instrumentalists in the ’20s, ’30s, and ’40s. After the Second World War, they were largely erased from the mainstream music industry and from official histories. This wasn’t an accident — partly, it was driven by the same forces that sent Rosie the Riveter back home from her factory job once the menfolk returned from the War.\n\nBut it goes further back than that. Even in their heyday, these musicians were treated differently from men. They were not offered recording contracts as readily as male artists and were not offered positions leading the house bands at major venues, even when they were wildly popular on tour. This means that they left behind less material to mine. Even worse, some of the work of women bandleaders featuring male musicians was later re-released under the names of those men.\n\nPerhaps the most important reason women musicians were rendered invisible is that most of the writing about music was being done by men, whether it was newspaper columnists writing contemporaneous reviews or authors of book-length histories of the era. Most of these writers seem to have reflexively discounted women musicians.\n\nThe only known mention of Ina Ray Hutton by the New York Times is a brief, insulting obituary, even though she had once led bands composed of some of the best male musicians of the time. According to the Times’ own research, Valaida Snow was only mentioned once in their pages until their belated obituary, published in 2020(!)\n\nMuch of what we know about the female musicians of the pre-war era comes not from official archives but from private collections of old 78s and movie reel footage, as well as tapes of some of the very first commercial television broadcasts.\n\nOne woman, Rosetta Reitz, founded a record label in 1979 specifically to unearth and re-release the music of women bandleaders from the first half of the 20th century and put out over a dozen such collections. Some of the best reporting comes from Britain, where there has long been a fascination with legacy American music (the British Invasion of the 1960s was catalyzed by their love of American blues and rock).\n\nWomen, of course, did re-emerge as musicians in the late 1960s, just as rock was taking off commercially. I’ve long been a fan of the great rocker chicks of the 1970s and early 1980s (Joan Jett? Chrissie Hynde? Patti Smith? To name just a few.) These women have always been treated as a sidelight, as imitations of male rockers, even though some of them were as innovative and rule-breaking as any of the guys.\n\nRock was, and is, tacitly viewed as a male, mostly white genre of music (with a handful of black stars like Chuck Berry, Little Richard, and Jimi Hendrix). So imagine my surprise when, a few years ago, I discovered that the person who most deserves to be considered the inventor of rock and roll was not only Black, but a woman!\n\nFor this “virtual album,” I chose clips featuring women who were not primarily singers but bandleaders, instrumentalists, and composers. Many of them also sang, and some danced, but the key point is that they were not confined to those roles.\n\nUnfortunately, the all-female bands usually bore names chosen by male promoters (e.g., “the Melodears”), which directly winked at their gender. There is a lot in a name, and I can’t help thinking that those names had something to do with why modern archivists long dismissed them as curiosities.\n\nAs you play these, watch and listen for riffs and motifs that would become staples of rock and roll — in some of the songs, you will not be able to help hearing a foretaste of Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, and just about everyone who ever sang “Rock me, Baby.”\n\n…..\n\nThe Ingenues: “Band Beautiful” (1928) Most of the women in this band are multi-instrumentalists, playing everything from banjos to trumpets and harps.\n\n……\n\nBlanche Calloway was the older sister of Cab Calloway and, for a time, was the bigger star. She taught him a lot of his chops, and they often performed together. Calloway was the first female headliner with male sidemen and the first to lead an all-male jazz band, the Joy Boys.\n\nHer early sidemen included Louis Armstrong and Richard M. Jones (who later became Armstrong’s producer). The Joy Boys included future bandleaders Ben Webster, Cozy Cole, Benny Moten, and Chick Webb. She wrote all of the material, but some of her work with these men was later re-released under their names.\n\n“I’m Gettin’ Myself Ready for You” (1931)\n\n“I Need Lovin’” (1931; this is a 1934 re-recording of her biggest hit)\n\n“Growlin’ Dan” c. 1935\n\n“I’ve Got What it Takes” (1931; Gloriously bawdy lyrics for that or any time)\n\nThe International Sweethearts of Rhythm (“the Sweethearts”) were founded in 1938 at a Mississippi boarding school for orphaned girls, initially to channel them into something positive and teach them valuable skills.\n\nIn 1941 the band went independent, and Anna Mae Winburn took over the role of bandleader, where she remained until they disbanded in 1949. Winburn had previously led jazz ensembles that included men, one of whom was the legendary Charlie Christian. They would go on to perform with some of the biggest male acts of the time, including Dizzy Gillespie. When people wanted to compliment the Sweethearts, they said, “they play like men.”\n\nThe Sweethearts were not only integrated but multiracial — the band included Asian, Latina, and Native American members. In a bizarre reversal of roles, the white members of the band had to try to pass as mulatto for the band to avoid being arrested for breaking segregation laws.\n\nHotel restrictions meant they often lived out of their bus while touring. While many male musicians thought highly of them, the media world and label powerbrokers did not treat them as seriously as they deserved. This limited their recording opportunities, leaving us with, unfortunately, little material.\n\n“I Left My Man!” The lead melody could well have been the inspiration, directly or indirectly, for many later blues and rock songs, including John Mayall’s “Dust my Blues”, Cream’s version of the old Robert Johnson classic “Crossroads”, and even Led Zeppelin’s “Rock and Roll”.\n\n“Jump Children” Starting at exactly 1:00 of this clip, there is a sequence that is, for all intents and purposes, full-blown rock and roll (including the lyrics “My baby rocks me…”), only missing the electric guitar.\n\n“How ‘Bout that Jive” featuring Tiny Davis, known as the female Louis Armstrong\n\nI hear foreshadowings of “Johnny B. Goode.” I wish the entire trumpet solo had been preserved."
