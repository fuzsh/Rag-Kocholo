        "text": "South Sudan is simultaneously drowning and drying as the climate crisis tightens its grip. An unprecedented flooding crisis has swallowed large swathes of the country while other parts are grappling with devastating drought.\n\nMore than 7 million people are food insecure, and 1.65 million children are malnourished.\n\nAt the same time, more than 500,000 people fleeing the Sudan conflict crossed into South Sudan in 2023. Of these, 83 percent were South Sudanese returning to a country hosting over 360,000 refugees and 2 million internally displaced persons, with limited livelihood opportunities.\n\nThe multiplying shocks have made it impossible for smallholder farmers in many areas to grow enough food. Additionally, with a heavy reliance on imports, many people across South Sudan are unable to afford basic food items and must rely on humanitarian assistance.\n\nWhile much of WFP's activities are focused on keeping people alive, we are also working with conflict and climate-affected communities to implement long-term solutions to reduce hunger."
