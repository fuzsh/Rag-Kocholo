        "text": "Middle East and North Africa: More than 45 Armed Conflicts\n\nThis is, in numbers, the most affected region: more than 45 armed conflicts are currently taking place throughout the Middle East and North Africa in the following territories: Cyprus, Egypt, Iraq, Israel, Libya, Morocco, Palestine, Syria, Turkey, Yemen and Western Sahara.\n\nThe majority are non-international (NIACs), involving a multitude of armed non-state actors and foreign interventions by Western powers, Russia, and neighbouring countries – except for the NIACs taking place in Egypt and Turkey.\n\n‘Syria is the most affected country in the region. Several multiple and overlapping NIACs are taking place in the country – involving numerous armed groups who fight against the government and against each other –, along with two military occupations and three international armed conflicts’ explains Dr Chiara Redealli, Research Fellow at the Geneva Academy.\n\n© Mahmoud Sulaiman, Unplash\n\nAfrica: More than 35 Armed Conflicts\n\nAfrica comes second in the number of armed conflicts per region with more than 35 non-international armed conflicts (NIACs) taking place in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic (CAR), the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Mali, Mozambique, Nigeria, Senegal, Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan. Several armed groups – fighting against government forces and/or against each other’s – are involved in these conflicts.\n\nWestern powers and/or neighbouring countries are intervening in the NIACs that take place in Burkina Faso, Mali, Mozambique, Nigeria, and Somalia.\n\n‘CAR is on the top of the list with several NIACs involving multiple armed groups. The Government is involved in NIACs against a wide array of rebel groups, including the anti-Balaka and the ex-Séléka. There are also parallel non-international armed conflicts due to the infighting between various armed groups’ underlines Dr Redealli.\n\n© UN Photo/Stuart Price\n\nBurkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic (CAR), the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Mali, Mozambique, Nigeria, Senegal, Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan.

These are happening in Afghanistan, India, Myanmar, Pakistan and The Philippines.\n\nTwo international armed conflicts – between respectively India and Pakistan, and between India and China – are also taking place in the region.\n\n‘Pakistan and the Philippines are on the top of the list with six NIACs for each country. In Pakistan, governmental forces are fighting various armed groups acting throughout the territory, particularly Taliban-affiliated groups in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and independence fighters in Balochistan. In the Philippines, most NIACs are taking place in the Mindanao region where government forces are fighting against several armed groups, including the Moro National Liberation Front, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters, the Maute Group and the Abu Sayyaf Group’ explains Dr Chiara Redealli.\n\n© ICRC\n\nEurope: Seven Armed Conflicts\n\nThe following military occupations constitute the majority of armed conflicts that are taking place in Europe, four out of seven conflicts: Russia is currently occupying Crimea (Ukraine), Transdniestria (Moldova), as well as South Ossetia and Abkhazia (Georgia), while Armenia is occupying parts of Nagorno Karabakh (Azerbaijan). Europe is also the theatre of an international armed conflict (IAC) between Ukraine and Russia, and of two non-international armed conflicts (NIACs) in Ukraine opposing governmental forces with the self-proclaimed ‘People’s Republics’ of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine.\n\n‘Russia’s invasion of Ukraine did not change our classification of the armed conflicts in the region. Indeed, according to IHL criteria, there have been an IAC between Russia and Ukraine and two NIACs in Ukraine since 2014. What has changed, since February 2022, is the intensity of the violence and its impact on the civilian population. This means, according to our analysis, that war crimes could already have taken place before March 2022’ explains Dr Chiara Redealli.\n\n© UNDP Ukraine/Oleksandr Ratushniak\n\nRussia is currently occupying Crimea (Ukraine), Transdniestria (Moldova), as well as South Ossetia and Abkhazia (Georgia), while Armenia is occupying parts of Nagorno Karabakh (Azerbaijan).
