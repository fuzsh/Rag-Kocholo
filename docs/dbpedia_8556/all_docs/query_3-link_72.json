        "text": "JUBA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- South Sudan said Thursday it will conduct its first-ever population survey (PES) in efforts to update figures on its population size.\n\nThe world's youngest nation still relies on the 2008 housing and population census undertaken before winning independence from Sudan in 2011.\n\nJames Wani Igga, Vice President for Economic Cluster, said the survey will help the government undertake population census in 2022, in addition to helping government and donors in planning activities.\n\n\"The population estimation survey will provide coordination across government actors, donors, private sector and universities in collection, processing and utilization of data to support national development efforts,\" Wani said in Juba during the launch.\n\nThe survey, estimated to cost 1.7 million U.S. dollars, will be conducted between April to May by 647 trained enumerators and supervisors.\n\nIsaiah Chol, chairperson of National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said the survey will help the government to plan for the upcoming population and housing censuses.\n\n\"With the implementation of the revitalized peace agreement, internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees are returning to their communities providing another dimension to the country's profile,\" said Chol.\n\nThe 2008 housing and population census put South Sudan's population at 8.26 million people, consisting of 4.29 million males and 3.97 million females.\n\nChol disclosed that the internal and external displacement, particularly during the periods of outbreak of conflicts in 2013 and 2016 substantially changed the population distribution dynamics in the country.\n\nAlain Noudehou, deputy special representative of the UN secretary-general in South Sudan, said the population survey is expected to come up with an accurate count of the population of South Sudan.\n\n\"It is expected to come up with an accurate count of population of South Sudan and generate a wealth of information, including age and sex, where they are and what their living conditions are,\" said Noudehou.\n\nIt will also provide information on other key socio-economic indicators like literacy and education, migration, economic activity, disability, agriculture and livelihoods.\n\n\"The survey is a very important exercise that will ultimately benefit the South Sudanese people because the information that will be gathered is critical for good governance, policy formulation, development planning, risk reduction, crisis response, social welfare programs and business market analysis,\" said Noudehou.
