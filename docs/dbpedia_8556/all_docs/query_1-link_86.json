        "text": "South Sudan remains one of the least peaceful countries in the world, according to the 2023 Global Peace Index. South Sudan experienced a 1% deterioration of its overall score in the 2023 report, owing to deteriorations in the “ongoing conflict” and “militarization” domains.\n\nSouth Sudan’s latest peace agreement, the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of Conflict in South Sudan (R-ARCSS), was signed in 2018. The agreement led to a fragile truce and resulted in the formation of the Transitional Government of National Unity in February 2020.\n\nIt is widely expected that the first general national elections will be held in South Sudan in December 2024, followed by the conclusion of the transitional arrangements set out and agreed to in the R-ARCSS.\n\nIn September 2022, a UN human rights team said incidents of rape had become so common in South Sudan that many women no longer report repeated sexual attacks. Rape victims lack access to medical and trauma care.\n\nCommunity leaders and other individuals involved in peacebuilding work in South Sudan were interviewed by The New Humanitarian and called for long-term initiatives that build positive ties between communities that have been divided by a civil war that cleaved groups along ethnic lines.\n\nSouth Sudan continues to be one of the most dangerous places for aid workers. On Nov. 6, 2023, a South Sudanese national aid worker was killed while on a field trip to respond to a suspected measles outbreak in the Greater Pibor Administrative Area.\n\nIn January 2024, 52 people, including women and children, were killed in the Abyei region, a disputed region between Sudan and South Sudan.\n\nExacerbating the humanitarian situation in South Sudan is the fighting that erupted in neighboring Sudan in mid-April between the Sudanese Armed Forces and Rapid Support Forces. As of June 20, 2024, more than 720,000 people had crossed into South Sudan from Sudan due to the conflict, with over 560,000 being South Sudanese.\n\nConsecutive years of record-breaking rains and floods covered two-thirds of the country as of late 2022 and left people without food or land to cultivate. The devastating flooding damaged shelters and schools, destroyed crops and household goods, reduced access to safe water and hindered humanitarian access.\n\nThe recovery process from these floods will take years. Dr. Liz Stephens, professor in climate risks and resilience at the University of Reading, said, “It will certainly take years for the floods from 2021 to recede, because the land is disconnected from the main river, so floodwaters have to evaporate rather than drain away.”\n\nDecember to February are typically the driest months for South Sudan when the rivers subside and the Sudd wetlands air out. For more details on South Sudan’s seasonality, refer to the image below.\n\nThe effects of the flooding are severe and broad. In 2021, the flooding destroyed 161,055 acres (65,177 hectares) of agricultural land and killed 795,558 livestock. In 2022, flooding affected over 900,000 people, displacing 140,000 people across 29 counties.\n\nAnother major flood event is likely to occur during the second half of 2024, threatening to worsen an already severe humanitarian crisis. In their food security outlook released in June 2024, FEWS NET said they are projecting a risk of Famine (IPC Phase 5) in South Sudan from June onward, “particularly in north-central Unity and other low-lying and flood-prone counties in the Sudd wetland area and river basins.”\n\nCritical drivers of displacement in South Sudan are conflict, persistent poverty, food insecurity and flooding. As of the end of December 2023, there were two million IDPs in South Sudan, and more than 2.27 million South Sudanese are refugees in neighboring countries as of June 30, 2024.\n\nOf the five neighboring countries hosting South Sudanese refugees, Uganda hosts the most at nearly 42%. Most refugees are situated in remote and economically underserved areas. Host communities are often in an unstable socioeconomic situation themselves, and new refugees’ arrival could further exacerbate hardship.\n\nMany displaced people have been forced to relocate multiple times to seek better living conditions or flee violence, particularly as those South Sudanese who fled northward into Sudan have again been displaced by violence and conflict there. Women, girls and people with disabilities are at risk of sexual violence, both inside displacement sites and when collecting fuel or food in surrounding areas.\n\nA macroeconomic crisis, linked to a decade of conflict, is a driver of South Sudan’s humanitarian crisis and contributes to displacement. The 2023 Global Report on Food Crises highlighted other drivers of the crisis, including very high staple food prices that are a result of insufficient domestic food supplies; low foreign currency reserves and the weak national currency; high fuel prices; and reduced imports from neighboring Uganda. These factors result in limited access to livelihoods, lack of agricultural opportunities and continued insecurity, which forces people to flee their homes in search of safety and food assistance.\n\nAccording to South Sudan’s 2023 Regional Refugee Response Plan (RRRP), “Some of the vulnerabilities and risk stem from exposure to endemic violence and the impact of climate chocks in the country of origin and others are magnified by prolonged displacement in situations where the needs outstrip the available resources for assistance, compounded by environments not conducive to self-reliance.”\n\nThe refugee crisis is a children’s crisis; children between the ages of 0-17 make up over 50% of the population, according to the 2023 RRRP. Refugee children face particular risks, including child labor, abduction and exposure to being trafficked.\n\nSouth Sudan remains among the most food-insecure countries globally. FEWS NET projects that 8-9 million people, or 65-70% of the population, will require food aid at the peak of the lean season (July-September).\n\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) is a common scale for classifying the severity and magnitude of food insecurity and acute malnutrition. The scale includes five phases, with Phase 1 meaning there is no or minimal acute food insecurity and Phase 5 meaning famine has been reached.\n\nIn their food security outlook released in June 2024, FEWS NET said, “Years of conflict and flooding have decimated livelihoods and eroded coping capacity, and multiple shocks are converging as the lean season approaches, including an ongoing economic crisis, high returnee burden, anticipated violence in advance of planned elections in December, and severe flooding projected to be worse than the 2020 and 2022 floods in extent and livelihoods impact.”\n\nEmergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes are expected to expand to 41 counties in June to September 2024 with some households in Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5).\n\nSouth Sudan’s health system is among the poorest in the world. There is a severe shortage of trained health professionals. There are growing demands for basic health care services, and flooding threatens the already fragile health system in the country.\n\nThe 2024 South Sudan HNRP says 6.3 million people need health services and assistance. In 2024, the health cluster will focus on providing “quality basic primary health care services and prevent health risks while strengthening the health care system.”\n\nAt-risk populations, including women, children, older people and persons with disabilities, have limited access to health care and face heightened risks of illness and mortality.\n\nThe arrival of thousands of people in South Sudan fleeing the conflict in neighboring Sudan strains the health system further and stretches humanitarian resources. The NGO Médecins Sans Frontières said in October 2023, “Many people, especially children, are arriving at the border with alarming health conditions, suffering from deadly diseases like measles or malnutrition that require immediate medical care.”\n\nYears of conflict and the impact of COVID-19 have resulted in trauma and mental health conditions for a large proportion of the country’s population. Despite mental health and psychosocial concerns, access to mental health and psychosocial support remains lacking and is urgently needed along with life-skills education."
