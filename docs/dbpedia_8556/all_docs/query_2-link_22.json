        "text": "Introduction\n\nBackground\n\nLong referred to as Nubia, modern-day Sudan was the site of the Kingdom of Kerma (ca. 2500-1500 B.C.) until it was absorbed into the New Kingdom of Egypt. By the 11th century B.C., the Kingdom of Kush gained independence from Egypt; it lasted in various forms until the middle of the 4th century A.D. After the fall of Kush, the Nubians formed three Christian kingdoms of Nobatia, Makuria, and Alodia, with the latter two enduring until around 1500. Between the 14th and 15th centuries, Arab nomads settled much of Sudan, leading to extensive Islamization between the 16th and 19th centuries. Following Egyptian occupation early in the 19th century, an agreement in 1899 set up a joint British-Egyptian government in Sudan, but it was effectively a British colony.\n\nMilitary regimes favoring Islamic-oriented governments have dominated national politics since Sudan gained independence from Anglo-Egyptian co-rule in 1956. During most of the second half of the 20th century, Sudan was embroiled in two prolonged civil wars rooted in northern domination of the largely non-Muslim, non-Arab southern portion of the country. The first civil war ended in 1972, but another broke out in 1983. Peace talks gained momentum in 2002-04, and the final North/South Comprehensive Peace Agreement in 2005 granted the southern rebels autonomy for six years, followed by a referendum on independence for Southern Sudan. South Sudan became independent in 2011, but Sudan and South Sudan have yet to fully implement security and economic agreements to normalize relations between the two countries. Sudan has also faced conflict in Darfur, Southern Kordofan, and Blue Nile starting in 2003.\n\nIn 2019, after months of nationwide protests, the 30-year reign of President Omar Hassan Ahmad al-BASHIR ended when the military forced him out. Economist and former international civil servant Abdalla HAMDOUK al-Kinani was selected to serve as the prime minister of a transitional government as the country prepared for elections in 2022. In late 2021, however, the Sudanese military ousted HAMDOUK and his government and replaced civilian members of the Sovereign Council (Sudanâs collective Head of State) with individuals selected by the military. HAMDOUK was briefly reinstated but resigned in January 2022. General Abd-al-Fatah al-BURHAN Abd-al-Rahman, the Chair of Sudanâs Sovereign Council and Commander-in-Chief of the Sudanese Armed Forces, currently serves as de facto head of state and government. He presides over a Sovereign Council consisting of military leaders, former armed opposition group representatives, and military-appointed civilians. A cabinet of acting ministers handles day-to-day administration.Â\n\nTip\n\nVisit the Definitions and Notes page to view a description of each topic.\n\nDefinitions and Notes\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nnorth-eastern Africa, bordering the Red Sea, between Egypt and Eritrea\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n15 00 N, 30 00 E\n\nMap references\n\nAfrica\n\nArea\n\ntotal : 1,861,484 sq km\n\nland: 1,731,671 sq km\n\nwater: 129,813 sq km\n\ncomparison ranking : total 17\n\nArea - comparative\n\nslightly less than one-fifth the size of the US\n\nArea comparison map :\n\nLand boundaries\n\ntotal: 6,819 km\n\nborder countries (7): Central African Republic 174 km; Chad 1,403 km; Egypt 1,276 km; Eritrea 682 km; Ethiopia 744 km; Libya 382 km; South Sudan 2,158 km\n\nnote: Sudan-South Sudan boundary represents 1 January 1956 alignment; final alignment pending negotiations and demarcation; final sovereignty status of Abyei region pending negotiations between Sudan and South Sudan\n\nCoastline\n\n853 km\n\nMaritime claims\n\nterritorial sea: 12 nm\n\ncontiguous zone: 18 nm\n\ncontinental shelf: 200-m depth or to the depth of exploitation\n\nClimate\n\nhot and dry; arid desert; rainy season varies by region (April to November)\n\nTerrain\n\ngenerally flat, featureless plain; desert dominates the north\n\nElevation\n\nhighest point: Jabal Marrah 3,042 m\n\nlowest point: Red Sea 0 m\n\nmean elevation: 568 m\n\nNatural resources\n\npetroleum; small reserves of iron ore, copper, chromium ore, zinc, tungsten, mica, silver, gold; hydropower\n\nLand use\n\nagricultural land: 100% (2018 est.)\n\narable land: 15.7% (2018 est.)\n\npermanent crops: 0.2% (2018 est.)\n\npermanent pasture: 84.2% (2018 est.)\n\nforest: 0% (2018 est.)\n\nother: 0% (2018 est.)\n\nIrrigated land\n\n15,666 sq km (2020)\n\nMajor rivers (by length in km)\n\nAn NÄ«l (Nile) (shared with Rwanda [s], Tanzania, Uganda, South Sudan, and Egypt [m]) - 6,650 km; Blue Nile river mouth (shared with Ethiopia [s]) - 1,600 km\n\nnote â [s] after country name indicates river source; [m] after country name indicates river mouth\n\nMajor watersheds (area sq km)\n\nAtlantic Ocean drainage: (Mediterranean Sea) Nile (3,254,853 sq km)\n\nInternal (endorheic basin) drainage: Lake Chad (2,497,738 sq km)\n\nMajor aquifers\n\nNubian Aquifer System, Sudd Basin (Umm Ruwaba Aquifer)\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nwith the exception of a ribbon of settlement that corresponds to the banks of the Nile, northern Sudan, which extends into the dry Sahara, is sparsely populated; more abundant vegetation and broader access to water increases population distribution in the south extending habitable range along nearly the entire border with South Sudan; sizeable areas of population are found around Khartoum, southeast between the Blue and White Nile Rivers, and throughout South Darfur as shown on this population distribution map\n\nNatural hazards\n\ndust storms and periodic persistent droughts\n\nGeography - note\n\nthe Nile is Sudan's primary water source; its major tributaries, the White Nile and the Blue Nile, meet at Khartoum to form the River Nile, which flows northward through Egypt to the Mediterranean Sea\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPopulation\n\ntotal: 50,467,278\n\nmale: 25,335,092\n\nfemale: 25,132,186 (2024 est.)\n\ncomparison rankings : female 31; male 29; total 29\n\nNationality\n\nnoun: Sudanese (singular and plural)\n\nadjective: Sudanese\n\nEthnic groups\n\nSudanese Arab (approximately 70%), Fur, Beja, Nuba, Ingessana, Uduk, Fallata, Masalit, Dajo, Gimir, Tunjur, Berti; there are over 500 ethnic groups\n\nLanguages\n\nArabic (official), English (official), Nubian, Ta Bedawie, Fur\n\nmajor-language sample(s):\n\nÙØªØ§Ø¨ Ø­ÙØ§Ø¦Ù Ø§ÙØ¹Ø§ÙÙ Ø Ø§ÙÙ ØµØ¯Ø± Ø§ÙØ°Ù ÙØ§ ÙÙ ÙÙ Ø§ÙØ§Ø³ØªØºÙØ§Ø¡ Ø¹ÙÙ ÙÙÙ Ø¹ÙÙÙ Ø§Øª Ø§ÙØ£Ø³Ø§Ø³ÙØ© (Arabic)\n\nThe World Factbook, the indispensable source for basic information.

Â Among the factors that led to the reduction in fertility are family planning, improvement in womenâs education and participation in the labor force outside the home, and migration and urbanization.Â\n\nThe continued slow decline in fertility accompanied by a drop in mortality and increased life expectancy has produced an age structure where approximately 55% of the population was of working age (15-64) as of 2020.Â This share will grow as the sizable youth population becomes working age.Â As Sudanâs working age population increasingly outnumbers the youth and elderly populations (the dependent populations), the country will approach the possibility of a demographic dividend.Â The window of opportunity for potential economic growth depends not only on a favorable age structure but also on having a trained and educated workforce, job creation (particularly in the formal market), and investment in health, as well as generating savings to invest in schooling and care for the elderly.Â As of 2018, Sudanâs literacy rate was just over 60%, and even lower among women.Â Improvements in school enrollment, student-teacher ratio, infrastructure, funding, and educational quality could help the country to realize a demographic dividend.\n\nAge structure\n\n0-14 years: 40.1% (male 10,278,453/female 9,949,343)\n\n15-64 years: 56.7% (male 14,211,514/female 14,390,486)\n\n65 years and over: 3.2% (2024 est.)

this means it can be spread more easily to people who are unvaccinated against polio and who come in contact with the stool or respiratory secretions, such as from a sneeze, of an âinfectedâ person who received oral polio vaccine; the CDC recommends that before any international travel, anyone unvaccinated, incompletely vaccinated, or with an unknown polio vaccination status should complete the routine polio vaccine series; before travel to any high-risk destination, the CDC recommends that adults who previously completed the full, routine polio vaccine series receive a single, lifetime booster dose of polio vaccine\n\nObesity - adult prevalence rate\n\n6.6% (2014)\n\ncomparison ranking : 165\n\nAlcohol consumption per capita\n\ntotal: 1.93 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)\n\nbeer: 0 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)\n\nwine: 0 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)\n\nspirits: 0.29 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)\n\nother alcohols: 1.63 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)\n\ncomparison ranking : total 131\n\nChildren under the age of 5 years underweight\n\n33% (2014)\n\ncomparison ranking : 3\n\nCurrently married women (ages 15-49)\n\n61.4% (2023 est.)\n\nEducation expenditures\n\nNA\n\nLiteracy\n\ndefinition: age 15 and over can read and write\n\ntotal population: 60.7%\n\nmale: 65.4%\n\nfemale: 56.1% (2018)\n\nSchool life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)\n\ntotal: 8 years\n\nmale: 8 years\n\nfemale: 7 years (2015)\n\nEnvironment\n\nEnvironment - current issues\n\nwater pollution;

although Sudan has about four times the population of South Sudan, the latter benefits from its control of the majority of known oil reserves; the Sudanese economy has been affected by hyperinflation in recent years, partly the result of the loss of oil revenue but also due to domestic volatility and social unrest; the difficult economic conditions have meant that for several years telcos have reported revenue under hyper inflationary reporting standards; pressure on revenue has made it difficult for operators to invest in infrastructure upgrades, and so provide improved services to customers; despite this, the number of mobile subscribers increased 7% in 2021, year-on-year; this level of growth is expected to have been maintained in 2022, though could slow from 2023; the countryâs poor fixed-line infrastructure has helped the development of mobile broadband services; after fighting started in April 2023, much of the telecommunications infrastructure was damaged (2023)\n\ndomestic: teledensity fixed-line is 1 per 100 and mobile-cellular is 74 telephones per 100 persons (2022)\n\ninternational: country code - 249; landing points for the EASSy, FALCONÂ and SAS-1,-2, fiber-optic submarine cable systems linking Africa, the Middle East, Indian Ocean Islands and Asia; satellite earth stations - 1 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean) (2019)\n\nBroadcast media\n\nFollowing the establishment of Sudanâs transitional government in August 2019, government-owned broadcasters became increasingly independent from government and military control. Following the October 2021 military takeover, additional restrictions were imposed on these government-owned broadcasters, which now practice a heightened degree of self-censorship but still operate more independently than in the pre-2019 environment.

Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Border Guards\n\nMinistry of Interior: security police, special forces police, traffic police, Central Reserve Police (2023)\n\nnote 1: the RSF is a semi-autonomous paramilitary force formed in 2013 to fight armed rebel groups in Sudan, with Mohammed Hamdan DAGALO (aka Hemeti) as its commander; it was initially placed under the National Intelligence and Security Service, then came under the direct command of former president Omar al-BASHIR, who boosted the RSF as his own personal security force; as a result, the RSF was better funded and equipped than the regular armed forces; the RSF has since recruited from all parts of Sudan beyond its original Darfuri Arab groups but remains under the personal patronage and control of DAGALO; the RSF has participated in combat operations in Yemen and in counterinsurgency operations in Darfur, South Kordofan, and the Blue Nile State; it has also been active along the borders with Libya and the Central African Republic and has been used to respond to anti-regime demonstrations; the RSF has been accused of committing human rights abuses against civilians and is reportedly involved in business enterprises, such as gold mining\n\nnote 2: the Central Reserve Police (aka Abu Tira) is a combat-trained paramilitary force that has been used against demonstrators and sanctioned by the US for human rights abuses\n\nMilitary expenditures\n\n1% of GDP (2021 est.)\n\n1% of GDP (2020 est.)\n\n2.4% of GDP (2019 est.)\n\n2% of GDP (2018 est.)\n\n3.6% of GDP (2017 est.)\n\nnote: many defense expenditures are probably off-budget\n\ncomparison ranking : 132\n\nMilitary and security service personnel strengths\n\nestimates vary widely; up to 200,000 SAF personnel; the strength of the RSF ranges from a low of about 30,000 to as many as 100,000 fighters; up to 80,000 Central Reserve Police (2023)\n\nMilitary equipment inventories and acquisitions\n\nthe SAF's inventory includes a mix of Chinese, Russian, Soviet-era, and domestically produced weapons systems; in recent years, China and Russia have been the leading arms providers; Sudan has one of the largest defense industries in Africa, which includes state-owned companies with military involvement; it mostly manufactures weapons systems under license from China, Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine (2023)\n\nMilitary service age and obligation\n\n18-33 years of age for compulsory or voluntary military service for men and women; 12-24 month service obligation (2023)\n\nnote: implementation of conscription is reportedly uneven\n\nMilitary - note\n\nthe primary responsibilities of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) are internal security, border control, and countering potential external threats from its neighbors; SAF operations have traditionally been supported by militia and paramilitary forces, particularly the Rapid Support Forces (RSF); in the Spring of 2023, heavy fighting broke out between the SAF and the RSF amid disputes over an internationally-backed plan for a transition towards civilian rule, particularly around the capital Khartoum and the western region of Darfur; fighting continued into 2024 with reports of ethnic cleansing, food insecurity, heavy civilian casualties, and millions of internally displaced persons\n\nthe Sudanese military has been a dominant force in the ruling of the country since its independence in 1956; in addition, the military has a large role in the country's economy, reportedly controlling over 200 commercial companies, including businesses involved in gold mining, rubber production, agriculture, and meat exports\n\nthe UN Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA) has operated in the disputed Abyei region along the border between Sudan and South Sudan since 2011; UNISFA's mission includes ensuring security, protecting civilians, strengthening the capacity of the Abyei Police Service, de-mining, monitoring/verifying the redeployment of armed forces from the area, and facilitating the flow of humanitarian aid; as of 2024, UNISFA had approximately 3,200 personnel assigned\n\nthe October 2020 peace agreement provided for the establishment of a Joint Security Keeping Forces (JSKF) comprised of 12,000 personnel tasked with securing the Darfur region in the place of the UN African Union Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID), a joint African Union-UN peacekeeping force that operated in the war-torn region between 2007 and the end of its mandate in December 2020; in June 2021, Sudan's transitional government announced it would increase the size of this force to 20,000 and expand its mission scope to include the capital and other parts of the country suffering from violence; the force would include the SAF, RSF, police, intelligence, and representatives from armed groups involved in peace negotiations; in September 2022, the first 2,000 members of the JSKF completed training; the status of the JSKF since the start of the civil war is unclear (2024)\n\nTerrorism\n\nTerrorist group(s)\n\nTerrorist group(s): Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham (ISIS); al-Qaâida; Harakat Sawaâd Misr\n\nnote: details about the history, aims, leadership, organization, areas of operation, tactics, targets, weapons, size, and sources of support of the group(s) appear(s) in the Terrorism reference guide\n\nTransnational Issues\n\nRefugees and internally displaced persons\n\nrefugees (country of origin): 696,246 (South Sudan) (refugees and asylum seekers), 137,402 (Eritrea) (refugees and asylum seekers), 93,477 (Syria) (refugees and asylum seekers), 72,334 (Ethiopia) (refugees and asylum seekers), 18,279 (Central African Republic) (2023)\n\nIDPs: 6.5 million (armed conflict between rival factions of the military government of Sudan since 15 April 2023) (2024); note - includes some non-Sudanese nationals\n\nTrafficking in persons\n\ntier rating: Tier 3 â Sudan does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so;
