        "text": "Sudan’s total land area is 1,861,484 square kilometers and the country is bordered by the Central African Republic, Chad, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Libya, South Sudan and the Red Sea. The dominant geographic feature of Sudan is the Nile River, which flows 3000 kilometers from Uganda in the south to Egypt in the north (USDOS 2012).\n\nSudan is generally flat, with some mountains found in the Darfur region in the west, the Red Sea hills in the north-east, the Jebel Marra plateau in the west and the Nuba Mountains in the south. Desert and semi-desert conditions exist across roughly 60-70% of the country’s land. The majority of Sudan is classified as arid land, and more than one-third of the country is classified as desert. Most desert regions of Sudan are undeveloped and support low-intensity pastoralism and isolated oasis communities. The exception is the Nile riverine strip. The significant agricultural activity it supports has been enhanced by irrigation schemes (UNEP 2012a; UNEP 2007).\n\nThe region north of Khartoum consists of desert and the Nile Valley. The central and southern regions of the country consist largely of the Sahel belt and the humid savannah where most of the country’s rain-fed and irrigated agriculture is practiced. Prior to the independence of South Sudan, 57% of the unified country was comprised of agricultural land, with irrigated land constituting 1% of Sudan’s total cultivated land and supplying over half of the country’s agricultural production. Post secession, it is estimated that less than 13% of Sudan’s land is cultivated (UNEP 2012a; World Bank 2009; UNEP 2007).\n\nSudan’s population of 34 million is approximately 60% rural. Urbanization is on the rise, however, as a result of insecurity in rural areas and the perception of greater opportunities in urban centers. The population is highly diverse; the northern region is populated mostly by Arabized African Muslims while the population in the south, along the border region with South Sudan, comprises primarily black African animists and Christians. The majority of residents of the western region of Darfur are black Muslims. Approximately 70% of Sudan’s population are Sudanese Arab (including Shaigiyya, Ja’alin, Misseriya, Kababish and Rizegat), and the remainder consist of Fur, Zaghawa, Massalit, Beja, Nuba and Dinka Ngok. Within these broad groups are dozens of ethnic and tribal groups (World Bank 2011b; UNEP 2012a; CIA 2012; USDOS 2012; UNEP 2007; FAO 2005).\n\nIn 2011, Sudan had an estimated GDP of US $51 billion. Agriculture accounted for 31% of GDP, and industry and services 24% and 44%, respectively. The oil sector, which is included in the industrial sector, has accounted for approximately 15% of nominal GDP in recent years. Agricultural land continues to be an important resource, while oil production and revenues are expected to drop significantly as a result of South Sudan’s independence, since 75% of the known reserves are found in South Sudan. The development of the oil sector led to a sharp rise in foreign investment during the interim governance period of the CPA and boosted the development of the industrial sector. It is unclear what impact the independence of South Sudan and renewed conflict in the border oil producing regions will have on foreign investment in Sudan going forward (IMF 2012a; IMF 2012b; World Bank 2012; USEIA 2012; World Bank 2011a; USDOS 2012).\n\nWhen Sudan was a unified country, 28% of its land area was forested, with an annual rate of deforestation of 0.8%. The majority of Sudan’s forests were found in what is now South Sudan. Rangelands covered roughly 117 million hectares spread over most of the formerly combined country’s ecological zones. As a result of secession, Sudan lost 75% of its forest resources and the deforestation rate jumped to 2.2% (UNEP 2012b; World Bank 2010; USDOS 2012; UNEP 2007; FAO 2005).\n\nThe five western states that make up the Darfur region have been under environmental pressure for decades. Much of the population in the semi-arid region has relied on herding and subsistence agriculture for survival. The region is experiencing significant environmental change – rainfall in some areas of the country has been steadily decreasing over the last 40 years, and the Sahara desert is advancing about a mile a year, eliminating grazing land and water holes. Forest ecosystems throughout Sudan have been degraded due to fire, uncontrolled grazing, overcutting and encroachment by agriculture. Drought and increasing pressure on land due to the expansion of commercial farming have restricted rangelands, and overgrazing is a growing problem. Almost all livestock is managed by semi-nomadic and nomadic groups. Environmental degradation and competition for limited natural resources have contributed to conflict in the region (UNEP 2012a; Bruce 1998; IRIN 2008; UNEP 2007).\n\nLAND DISTRIBUTION\n\nThe population of Sudan is primarily located in the urban areas, along the Nile River, and in areas of industrial and mechanized agricultural development. The desert and semi-desert areas of the region, primarily in the north and west, support isolated communities and low-intensity pastoralism. With the exception of the Nile River strip and the Red Sea coastal plain, the desert regions of Sudan are relatively undeveloped. Along the Nile River, well-irrigated farms raise cash crops (UNEP 2007).\n\nKhartoum, the capital, has an estimated 5–7 million residents, including a UN-estimated 1–1.2 million IDPs from southern conflict zones and from drought areas in the east and west. Most residences are single story buildings, constructed on plots of 300–500 square meters. Large unauthorized settlements are growing on the outskirts of Khartoum and Sudan’s other cities and towns. The settlements are characterized by lack of planning, inadequate water and sewage services, and the prevalence of disease. Khartoum hosts an estimated 96 different informal settlements, housing 2–3 million people. Since independence, four master plans for the city have been created, but they have been only partially implemented, and a fifth effort is ongoing (UNHCR 2012; IDMC 2011; Pantuliano et al. 2011; UNEP 2007; Rahhal and Abdel Salam 2006).\n\nThe semi-arid Sahel belt crosses the country’s central region. Most agricultural production in Sudan is located in the Sahel and southward. In the central area, most of the natural vegetation has been cleared and replaced with flat, open agricultural fields. Both rainfed and irrigated agriculture are practiced in the region, and large areas are devoted to mechanized farming enterprises (UNEP 2007).\n\nAs of January 2012, Sudan had an estimated 2.4 million IDPs, primarily displaced from homes and land in the southern and western (Darfur) regions and living in both rural and urban areas in the north and IDP camps. In addition to the IDPs, as of 2012, there were 500,000 Sudanese refugees, most of whom are living in neighboring countries. IDPs and refugees have begun to return to their land and residences or are settling on land provided for them by traditional authorities and local governments. Since the signing of the CPA in 2005, an estimated 2 million IDPs have returned to the Abyei, South Kordofan and Blue Nile regions. The returning population is primarily practicing subsistence agriculture, competing for land with nomadic tribes. In other cases, some IDPs are choosing to remain in IDP settlements, putting pressure on natural resources and services in areas often ill-suited for large permanent settlements (UNHCR 2012; UNMIS 2011; UNEP 2007; de Geoffroy 2007).\n\nLEGAL FRAMEWORK\n\nSudan’s current interim constitution was installed in 2005 following the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. The Interim National Constitution (INC) does not directly address land rights and ownership of natural resources, but it does sanction the establishment of a National Land Commission to direct the development of land policy, the adjudication of land disputes and the development of policies for the recognition of customary land rights. State Land Commissions are also called for in Blue Nile, Southern Kordofan and Darfur States to exercise the powers of the National Land Commission at the state level. To date, the Government of Sudan has not taken steps to form the National Land Commission or State Land Commissions in South Kordofan and Blue Nile. The Darfur Land Commission was established in 2007. Sudan is now in the process of drafting a new constitution to replace the Interim National Constitution (UNEP 2012a; Pantuliano 2007; Nucci 2004; Alden Wiley 2010; Sudan Tribune 2012).\n\nThe legal framework governing land in Sudan is a complex mix of statutory law and customary law that have evolved over time, with little to no coordination between the two. The formal laws governing land include colonial era laws and a handful of post-independence statutes relating to the registration of land and its impact on land rights, and the legal framework regarding land access. The Land Resettlement and Registration Act (1925) (LRRA) is the primary reference for details on land settlement and the registration of rights. The LRRA also consolidated government ownership over land by establishing that all unoccupied land is presumed to be state land. The Unregistered Land Act (1970) served to nationalize all unregistered land in the country. The Act provided that all land that had not been registered at the time of the Act’s passage was state land. The state retained land ownership and could grant leasehold interests to individuals and entities, in effect allocating land for commercial development without regard for customary rights (UNEP 2012a; Rahhal and Abdel Salam 2006; Alden Wily 2008; De Wit 2001).\n\nThe Civil Transaction Act (1984) repealed the Unregistered Land Act, but retained the principle of state ownership of land. The Act provides the framework for transactions in land, including leases and easements, transfer and inheritance of rights, and conditions for obtaining usufruct rights. The Act affirms the government’s authority to administer rights over land and provides that registered usufruct rights to land are equal to registered ownership rights to land. The 1984 law also introduces Sharia law into the formal legal framework and includes a requirement that the government provide compensation when it appropriates land (UNEP 2012a; Rahhal and Abdel Salam 2006; Alden Wily 2008; De Wit 2001; Bruce 1998).\n\nThe Local Government Act (1998) identifies land management and administration responsibilities of local authorities. The Act was adopted in effort to fill the void that was left by the Government’s elimination of Native Administration in the 1970s. The Act confers on local authorities responsibility over (1) establishment and function of local land management committees; (2) development of local laws regulating land management; (3) involvement of customary authorities in land management; and (4) accountability mechanisms for land management (UNEP 2012a; Rahhal and Abdel Salam 2006; De Wit 2001).\n\nTENURE TYPES\n\nFormal law provides that all unregistered land (90% of the country’s land) is owned by the government. Individuals and entities can obtain leasehold interests of various durations and terms. Islamic law recognizes individual freehold interests in land, and land that was registered as of 1970 is considered privately owned (UNEP 2012a; Nucci 2004; Alden Wily 2008; Bruce 1998; Rahhal and Abdel Salam 2006).\n\nCustomary land tenure systems exist throughout Sudan and govern the practices of pastoralists in the north, the semi-feudal systems that developed on land close to the Nile, and the practices of southern and western tribes. Customary law varies throughout the country, but tends to share the following general characteristics: land is considered to belong to the people; land is not formally registered; land remains with the tribe or clan and cannot usually be sold to outsiders; most land rights are use rights, and land is considered retained by a household until abandoned (and in some circumstances even if abandoned); and rights to land and its natural resources may overlap. Most groups distinguish between land used for grazing and hunting and land used for farming and residences, and different rules apply to the various land categories. Local leaders determine who has rights to land and other natural resources and who must seek permission for use of land (Rahhal and Abdel Salam 2006; De Wit 2001; De Wit 2004).\n\nSECURING LAND PROPERTY RIGHTS\n\nIn Sudan, land use and access rights derive from both customary institutions and formal statutory law. Formal law, including Islamic law, governs land access and tenure security. Land can be obtained through inheritance or by land sales and leasing. Land sales and leases can be registered, and registered land is considered the most secure. Islamic law recognizes the principle of shufa’a, which allows a neighbor or co-inheritor of land a right of first refusal when the right-holder transfers the land. The recognition and use of formal law is predominant in urban areas and towns (UNEP 2012a; Nucci 2004; Bruce 1998; Rahhal and Abdel Salam 2006; De Wit 2004).\n\nIn many rural areas throughout the country, customary institutions manage land use and allocation. Community members have a right to access land for use as their residence and for farming. Traditional leaders have the authority to allocate land to members of the community. In areas with available land, those in need of land may clear and use unoccupied land. In more densely populated areas, land is most commonly obtained by inheritance. If someone leaves an area, the traditional leaders usually reallocate the land. Customary systems in Sudan are diverse and vary significantly across the country. Although prevalent throughout the country, customary rights are not formally recognized by the state (De Wit 2004; Bruce 1998).\n\nIn urban areas, formal and informal leases of state-owned land are the most common tenure systems. The terms of leases vary and are often undisclosed to tenants. Plots offered under formal leases are rare and expensive, and most urban and peri-urban residents live in informal settlements with limited or no services. The government has used the demand for housing to forcefully evict occupants and demolish informal settlements. The sites are then allocated (leased) by the government to investors for new residential construction (De Wit 2004; Rahhal and Abdel Salam 2006; de Geoffroy 2007).\n\nHistorically, land tenure insecurity has resulted from the imposition of formal law that does not recognize individual rights to unregistered land. State authorities have considered unregistered land to be state land and thus available for the state to transfer to private commercial interests, the military, land speculators and elites without regard for customary rights. Although the CPA required the development of laws to incorporate customary laws and practices, local heritage and international trends and practices, the Sudanese government continues to issue new long-term leases over community lands to commercial interests and well-connected individuals without consulting local populations or obtaining their consent. Many of these new large commercial leases have involved prime farmland and have been made to international investors from the Gulf States, South Korea and Egypt. As a result of the rapid privatization and commercialization of lands by the government, especially in the border regions, customary land tenure systems are gradually breaking down (Alden Wiley 2010, Large and El-Basha 2010; Pantuliano 2007; Rahhal and Abdel Salam 2006).\n\nIn urban areas in the border regions, military personnel have taken advantage of their positions to occupy residences or construct buildings on land that owners left vacant when they fled the violence. The military personnel have been unwilling to vacate the land upon the return of the owner, or have claimed ownership rights and sold the plots to others. In Darfur, various groups have taken advantage of the years of conflict and the unsettled nature of land rights. In western and southwestern areas, lands that non-Arab sedentary groups, like the Masalit and Fur, occupied before the conflict, have been taken or are being used by nomadic Arab groups such as the Mahariya and Missiriya (Nucci 2004; De Wit 2004; Alden Wily 2008; Pantuliano 2007).\n\nINTRA-HOUSEHOLD RIGHTS TO LAND AND GENDER DIFFERENCES\n\nWomen’s land rights are highly insecure in Sudan. Many community members obtain land through customary land allocations, and the land is commonly granted to male family members. A woman’s rights to the land are derived not as a result of her status as a member of the community, but as a result of her relationship with her husband, father, brother or other male relative. Women rarely have direct rights to land, and when a household is disrupted by death or divorce and the woman’s relationship with the male landholder terminates, she may be unable to retain her access to land. Male family members may sell or transfer the family land without the woman’s consent or simply deny her rights to use the land (De Wit 2004).\n\nIn much of Sudan, Shari’a law governs property rights in the event of marriage, divorce and death. Shari’a law recognizes women’s rights to hold property, but according to local custom land rights tend to be retained by male family members. Daughters are entitled to inherit a share of land from their fathers, but the share is usually half that received by sons, and daughters customarily relinquish their shares to their brothers in order to keep family land intact and in exchange for support by the brothers, if necessary (De Wit 2004; Bruce 1998).\n\nWomen face special obstacles when trying to access land after divorce or death of a husband. In both cases it is common for male relatives to sell family land without consent or even notice to the woman. In order for widows to claim inherited leasehold rights from the government they must obtain a death certificate, which is difficult to procure. This requirement is particularly challenging for the estimated 45–50% of women-headed households found in the IDP and refugee communities. In rural areas where customary law prevails women’s access to land is often hindered because they have only indirect rights to land under most customary tenure systems (De Wit 2004; Pantuliano 2007).\n\nLAND ADMINISTRATION AND INSTITUTIONS\n\nThe reform of land administration institutions was a key component of the CPA. The CPA required the establishment of a National Land Commission and State Land Commissions (for South Kordofan, Blue Nile and Darfur) responsible for: establishing land policy within their respective jurisdictions; enforcing land law; resolving land disputes; assessing compensation for land acquisitions; studying and recording land-use practices in areas where natural resource development occurs; conducting hearings; and formulating their own rules of procedure. Land Commissions have yet to be established at the National level and in South Kordofan and Blue Nile States, and as a result, land administration practices and institutions in much of Sudan remain substantially as they were prior to the CPA. The Darfur Land Commission was established in 2007 as part of the Darfur Regional Authority. Since its founding, the DLC has engaged in projects related to collection of customary laws and practices and land use and natural resource mapping (UNEP 2012a; Alden Wiley 2010; Ottaway and El-Sadany 2012).\n\nMost government land administration functions in Sudan have been devolved from the federal government to the state level. To the extent that the federal government remains involved, it is largely responsible for setting standards and providing training and guidance to the state authorities. However, in many federal ministries, the precise allocation of responsibilities and authority remains unclear (UNEP 2012a; De Wit 2001).\n\nAt the state level, there are three primary institutions responsible for general land administration, surveying and the judiciary. The Government Land Disposition and Committee, responsible for allocating land, is comprised of individuals from other state level Ministries. The Survey Department performs physical planning and surveying of urban plots, and is housed within the State Ministry of Engineering Affairs. Within each state there is also a Land Registration Office that is part of the Civil Court and is responsible for maintaining a state land registry. These institutions’ capabilities vary significantly from state to state, but all lack necessary training and resources (De Wit 2001).\n\nIt is at the locality (mahalia) level where customary authorities intersect with formal government institutions. Each mahalia supports a Land Conflict Resolution Committee that is responsible for resolving land disputes. Customary authorities typically play a prominent role on these committees. Disputes that cannot be resolved by the committee may be taken to Civil Court (De Wit 2001).\n\nA variety of customary institutions continue to function to some degree in much of Sudan’s rural areas. In some areas, traditional leaders continue to allocate land, and many such leaders maintain some record of land occupancy and transfers. The Native Administration is a form of a clan and tribal administration that administers the affairs of the tribal groups according to their norms and traditions. Historically, Native Administrations were responsible for local issues affecting their communities, such as agricultural land-use practices, access to pastures and water and land, and natural resource conflict resolution. In the early 1970s the GoS attempted to abolish Native Administrations and replace them with local government offices, but the Native Administrations had substantial social legitimacy and survived in many areas. In 1986, the GoS adopted the Native Administration Act, which reinstated the Native Administration system, albeit with much reduced powers for the traditional leaders. More recently, reformers question the role of these traditional authorities, arguing that the system should be restructured in order to promote greater accountability, eliminate corruption and protect the legal status of women and other vulnerable groups and communities (Bruce 1998; Pantuliano 2007; Mohammed 2007; Rahhal and Abdel Salam 2006).\n\nLAND MARKETS AND INVESTMENTS\n\nUnder the Civil Transaction Act of 1984, land transactions must be registered. In Khartoum, land registration requires six procedures and nine days, and costs 3.1% of property value. Only a very small percentage (10% or less) of land in Sudan is surveyed and registered. Urban cadastral information is largely nonexistent or in disarray. Most land transactions are informal and not registered (World Bank 2012; De Wit 2004; Nucci 2004).\n\nGovernment leasing of land to private investors, often large-scale enterprises, has become common in Sudan. Since 2007, it is estimated that the GoS has commercially leased out approximately 3.9 million hectares. This figure is in addition to the roughly 12.5 million hectares of land commercially leased out by the government prior to 2005. Approximately 78% of these post-2007 leases went to domestic investors, but many of these are backed by foreign banks or agencies. In Blue Nile state, government officials have acknowledged recording 62 commercial leases, most of which are for 10000 feddan (10380 acres) or more. Common characteristics of commercial leases throughout Sudan include lack of public notification, contradictory lease terms and conditions resulting in different rules for different applicants, and lack of coordination between the national and state governments (Alden Wiley 2010).\n\nCOMPULSORY ACQUISITION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS BY GOVERNMENT\n\nUnder the 2005 Interim National Constitution, private property cannot be expropriated except in accordance with law and for the public interest. Prompt and fair compensation must be paid. The Land Acquisition Act (1930) is consistent with the constitutional provisions. The Acquisition Act authorizes the state to take private property in the public interest, under terms consistent with the Seventh Constitutional Decree (1993) and the Civil Transactions Act (1994) (UNHCR 2005).\n\nSince independence, the Sudanese government has expropriated land without due process or payment of compensation. The GoS has relied on formal law – the Unregistered Land Act of 1970 and the Civil Transaction Act of 1984 – to designate all unregistered land as state land. The Unregistered Land Act further legitimizes expropriation by expressly authorizing government eviction of occupants on unregistered lands, through the use of reasonable force if necessary. This legal dispossession of unregistered lands, which account for 90% of all lands, appears to be the most common form of expropriation in Sudan. Land seizures have been common in the states of South Kordofan and Blue Nile, and in the eastern region. The state has seized land and leased it out to private entities for development of large mechanized farming operations. The government has used gunships and helicopters to clear people from villages to secure land for the development of oil fields. The forcible displacement of people, especially from South Kordofan, caused many to join the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM) insurgency. Even after signing the CPA, the GoS continues to lease large tracts of land to private entities for development without consultation with (and to the detriment of) local populations (Rahhal and Abdel Salam 2006; Pantuliano 2007; De Wit 2004; Nucci 2004; Alden Wily 2008; Alden Wiley 2010).\n\nKhartoum hosts an estimated 96 different informal settlements, housing 2–3 million people. After several failed efforts to manage settlement growth, Khartoum’s government resorted to demolition as a primary method of urban planning. Since 2004, the government has demolished seven IDP camps, bulldozing settlements with little warning and displacing more than 665,000 residents, none of whom (have) received compensation. Twice that number of camps have been destroyed since 1990. In several cases, the government forced residents of informal settlement camps into remote desert locations that lack services and livelihood options. For example, in 2008–2009, the government demolished and relocated an estimated 10000 people from the Mayo neighborhood in Khartoum. Some of these families were re-allocated plots within the redesigned community of Mayo, but more than two-thirds were relocated to remote areas (Pantuliano et al. 2011; UNEP 2007; Rahhal and Abdel Salam 2006; de Geoffroy 2007).\n\nLAND DISPUTES AND CONFLICTS\n\nIn 2005, the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM) and the Government of Sudan signed a Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) ending the civil war. The CPA called for a 6-year interim period for peace building, during which the Khartoum-based government and the southern-based SPLM would share power and wealth, including oil revenues. The CPA culminated with a referendum in January 2011, under which the population of southern Sudan voted overwhelmingly to secede from Sudan. Neither the signing of the CPA in 2005 nor the secession of South Sudan in 2011 has brought lasting peace to Sudan. Conflict over resources, especially oil and land, border demarcation, self-determination, and government expropriation of land continue to result in violence between Sudan and its neighbors (primarily South Sudan) and within the country (Ottaway and El-Sadany 2012; CEIP 2011).\n\nConflict in the Border Regions. The Abyei region and the states of South Kordofan and Blue Nile make up what is often referred to as the Transitional or Three Areas of Sudan. Abyei (a county and former district of South Kordofan), South Kordofan state and Blue Nile state lie on the border area between Sudan and South Sudan. These states are officially demarcated as part of Sudan, but have historical, ethnic and tribal ties to South Sudan. The Three Areas are marked by culturally diverse populations, a wealth of natural resources (including oil, agricultural land and water) and longstanding, complex conflicts around political, economic, religious, cultural and social identity issues (Ottaway and El-Sadany 2012; CEIP 2011).\n\nThe CPA acknowledged that these regions were disproportionately affected by the civil war, and that many of their residents sympathized with the SPLM. As a result, the CPA provided different pathways for each of these regions to define its future relationship with the GoS. Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile were granted a degree of autonomy and an alternative governance structure that allowed for greater local governance and revenue sharing, and the establishment of State Land Commissions to settle land disputes. The CPA also stipulated that popular consultations be held in each state following the national and local elections to ascertain the views of the people on the provisions of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement relevant to their states (Ottaway and El-Sadany 2012; CEIP 2011).\n\nIn South Kordofan, allegations of fraud around the May 2011 state elections led to violent conflict when Sudanese forces entered the state to disarm rebel groups. Adding to the resentment of the local population is the fact that the popular consultations called for under the CPA have not proceeded, nor has the state land commission been formed. Violence also continues in Blue Nile where Sudanese forces have clashed with the SPLM, causing Sudanese President Bashir to declare a state of emergency and remove the governor. It is estimated that the renewed fighting in these two regions in 2011 displaced 200,000 people in South Kordofan and 66000 in Blue Nile (Ottaway and El-Sadany 2012; IDMC 2011).\n\nThe CPA describes Abyei as a bridge between the north and the south. The population of the area consists of Ngok, Dinka and Arab Misseriya pastoralists who have traditionally moved their cattle back and forth across what is now the South Sudan border. At one time Abyei was an oil rich region, but boundary revisions by the Abyei Boundary Commission transferred the oil rich town of Heglig to South Kordofan state in 2009. The CPA granted Abyei autonomy during the interim period that the CPA was in effect (July 2005–July 2011) and stipulated that a referendum be held to determine whether Abyei would remain with Sudan or join South Sudan. Scheduled for January 2011, the referendum has been postponed indefinitely after disputes between the GoS and GoSS over who has the right to vote in the referendum. Ignoring the provisions of the CPA, GoS forces took control of the main town in Abyei in May 2011 and dissolved the local government. The United Nations has responded by inserting over 4000 UN troops into the region to oversee the withdrawal of both GoS and GoSS armies. The UN estimates that approximately 110,000 people were displaced as a result of the May 2011 fighting in Abyei (Ottaway and El-Sadany 2012; IDMC 2011; CEIP 2011).\n\nConflicts over Oil. Oil has long been at the center of conflict between the GoS and the SPLM ruling party in South Sudan. The secession of South Sudan resulted in the loss of approximately 75% of Sudan’s oil and upwards of 70% of government revenue. During the interim period from 2005 to 2011, oil revenues were essentially shared equally between the GoS and the GoSS. After independence, South Sudan stopped sharing oil revenues with Sudan, resulting in a loss of approximately US $1.7 billion per year to the GoS. In retaliation, and in an attempt to make up this lost revenue, the GoS threatened to charge exorbitant fees for the use of the pipeline necessary to transfer the oil from the fields in the south to the Port of Sudan and global markets. The dispute over oil revenues and transit fees continued to escalate throughout 2011 until South Sudan halted all oil production in February 2012. In September 2012, the GoS and the GoSS announced an agreement to create a 10-mile demilitarized zone along the contested border areas and to resume production and transit of up to 350,000 barrels of oil a day but the agreement has yet to be implemented as of March 2013(Ottaway and El-Sadany 2012; WSJ 2012).\n\nDarfur. In Darfur, conflict began over political control of the region and access to land and natural resources. Disputes between pastoralists and sedentary farmers had occurred in the past, but the traditional leaders – sheikhs, omdas and nazirs – mediated the disputes. In the 1970s, the traditional authority of the sheikhs and nazirs was replaced by local government councils. In the decades that followed, drought, famine and diminishing natural resources put pressure on cooperative agreements among diverse groups. Local government was ineffective at resolving disputes, and groups became polarized. In 2003, government forces attempted to take control of the region. In addition to its own official troops, the government sponsored a brutal militia, the janjaweed, who burned villages, killed, raped and maimed people and destroyed or stole crops and livestock. In an 8-year period, between 200,000 to 400,000 people died, and 2.5 million were displaced (Egemi 2006; UNEP 2007; Adams et al. 2006).\n\nPeace agreements signed by the government and the primary rebel groups in 2006 and 2010 have not been effective and violence continues. The Darfur Peace Agreement of 2006 called for the establishment of a Land Commission to resolve land issues in the region, including the arbitration of disputes over rights to land. The Commission was formed in 2007 and has been active in establishing a structural framework for its work, collection and codification of customary law, and mapping of land and natural resource uses. Because the Commission does not have an executive role, and the ability to enforce decisions, it has not been effective in resolving conflicts between sedentary groups and pastoralists. The Darfur Pastoral Routes Demarcation Committee (DPRDC) is another entity that was created to resolve disputes between pastoralist s and sedentary groups. The results of the work of DPRRDC have been challenged by sedentary farmers, and also by traditional leaders who have historically managed natural resources and handled conflicts over use of the resources, but who have been marginalized by the conflict and new leaders (UNEP 2012a; Egemi 2006).\n\nEastern Sudan. Government allocation of large tracts of land for commercial agricultural schemes has led to resentment by local pastoralists who have lost access to lands that they have traditionally occupied. Loss of land and water rights by pastoralists has generated a great deal of conflict (Ottaway and El-Sadany 2012; Pantuliano 2007).\n\nReturning IDPs and Refugees. The steady return of refugees and IDPs in Sudan is expected to exacerbate existing conflicts over land-use and place demands on local institutions that lack capacity to manage the numbers of people needing resettlement assistance. The UNHCR estimates that at least 2.2 million people remained internally displaced in Sudan at the end of 2011. Areas that have been identified as particularly prone to conflict include South Kordofan (Nuba Mountains), Blue Nile, Abyei, Darfur, Eastern Sudan and Khartoum (USAID 2005; ARD 2009b; Pantuliano 2007; UNHCR 2012).\n\nPastoralists and Grazing. Conflicts over control of grazing land and natural resources continue between different resource users in all areas of the country. In the Three Areas, clashes have intensified in recent years. The major conflicts in the area are: (1) between farmers and pastoralists; (2) within agro-pastoralists communities, as relatively powerful groups expand land areas at the expense of others; (3) between farmers and groups exploiting natural resources such as timber, palm trees and gum arabic; and (4) between returnees and laborers or sharecroppers on mechanized farms. The decades of war, combat experience and military training and access to modern weapons have increased the deadliness of local conflict (Pantuliano 2007; IRIN 2008).\n\nThe systems of land ownership and control have not been able to accommodate the competing demands of pastoral nomads and sedentary farmers. As grazing land and water sources have diminished, pastoral groups have sought secure access to land and other natural resources. The conflict between pastoralists and farmers led to a leadership vacuum in many rural areas that was exploited by nomadic, landless rebel groups that grew in strength. Government efforts to subdue the rebels included using the janjaweed, a government-sponsored militia that used brutal and extreme methods (Lweytzkyj 2009; Parmar 2007; Pantuliano 2007; Egemi 2006).\n\nDispute Resolution. Under the terms of the CPA, the Land Commissions are charged with arbitrating land disputes. However, only one of the four Land Commissions has been established to date, leaving dispute resolution to existing institutions in most of the country. Even in Darfur where the Commission has been established, dispute resolution is hindered by the Commission’s lack of authority to enforce implementation of decisions. At the local level, the Land Conflict Resolution Committees are, at least in theory, responsible for resolving land disputes. Customary authorities often participate in these committees, which are the local access points to the formal judicial system at the state and central level (UNEP 2012a; Alden Wiley 2010; De Wit 2001).\n\nCustomary institutions have historically been used to resolve local land disputes. Local chiefs or sultans commonly resolve minor disputes. Matters can be taken to the Native Administration or to customary courts, in which traditional leaders such as sultans, omdas and sheikhs serve as judges. The customary courts enforce customary law to the extent that it is not inconsistent with statutory and Shari’a law. Customary courts can refer cases to the formal court system (Parmar 2007; Nucci 2004; Pantuliano 2007; Mohammed 2007).\n\nDONOR INTERVENTIONS AND INVESTMENTS\n\nIn 2012, USAID and UNEP supported a study tour to Kenya and Tanzania to help Darfur leaders learn about tenure and management arrangements which support local livelihoods on an environmentally sustainable basis, and which contribute to peaceful relations over resources. The study tour visit was in the form of a Learning Route, which is a continuous process of training in the field, organized thematically around successful experiences, case studies and good practice. At the request of the participating Darfuri institutions, a series of seminars were held in the 5 Darfur States to share the lessons learned from the study tour with a wider audience (including government and non-government institutions, among them government ministries, native administration, civil society, academic institutions, UN agencies, and NGOs). This had a substantial multiplier effect in terms of the number of beneficiaries who have benefitted from the study tour learning (Semunegus 2013).\n\nThe Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) was created in 2005 to provide a vehicle for donors to pool resources and coordinate support for overall recovery and development needs in Sudan during the lifetime of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (2005–2011). The funds are used on a range of recovery and longer-term development activities, including health, education, infrastructure and public sector reform. Donors include the Netherlands, Norway, United Kingdom, European Commission, Sweden, Germany, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Iceland, Greece, Canada, Spain, Egypt and the World Bank. The trust funds are administered by the World Bank, working together with United Nations partners, donors, civil society and the respective governments (World Bank 2011c).\n\nSupported by the United Nations Development Programme, the Darfur Community Peace and Stability Fund (DCPSF II) is anticipated to operate until 2015. The community-level conflict resolution and prevention services it provides aim to assist communities by: resolving conflicts over livelihood assets; creating income-generating opportunities; and securing access to natural resources. The fund also supports projects in Darfuri communities that promote peace and economic growth. The fund is supported by contributions from six donors, including USAID (UNDP 2012b).\n\nSustainable Food Security through Community-Based Livelihoods Development is a project supported by the Food and Agriculture Programme of the United Nations (FAO) and implemented by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO). The project aims to bring about sustainable improvements in food security for 12000 households in Southern Kordofan. Started in 2011 and slated to run through 2015, the project focuses on: building community capacity to mitigate conflict and guide local development; increasing agricultural production at the household level; and increasing employment in off-farm livelihoods (FAO 2012a).\n\nIn 2010, USAID signed a US $950,000 agreement with the GoS reestablishing the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) across Sudan. The systems network will provide information to predict and manage threats to food security. The partnership marks the resumption of a program that had been closed in Sudan’s northern states since 1992 (USAID 2010).\n\nFrom 2006 to 2009, USAID’s Sudan Customary Land and Tenure Program (CLTP) provided technical assistance and material support for the implementation of the CPA with respect to the strengthening of customary land tenure in the Blue Nile and South Kordofan states. The project provided assistance to governments of the two states to prepare draft legislation to develop and amend the relevant laws to incorporate customary laws and practices, local heritage and international trends and practices and to implement any new laws regulating property rights and approved by the legislature. The CLTP also aimed to protect and formalize customary land and resource rights through the demarcation, mapping and registration of community lands, with the goals of resolving conflict, strengthening tenure security and improving participatory land-use management (USAID/REDSO 2006; Adams and Palmer 2007; ARD 2008; ARD 2009a; FAO 2008; UNEP 2007).\n\nIn 2004, to help address the root causes of tensions between farmers and pastoralists in North Kordofan, Upper Nile and Sobat Basin, the Netherlands, CIDA and UNDP launched the 4-year Reduction of Resource-Based Conflicts project. The project’s specific objectives were to: promote institutional and legal reform in natural resource management to improve productivity and reduce conflict; strengthen capacity of government and civil society to manage natural resources and mitigate conflict; design and promote measures to reduce and better manage risk in pastoral livelihood systems; promote a culture of peace; and develop and promote clearer strategies for pastoral and agro-pastoral livelihood development (UNDP 2012a).\n\nThe FAO previously worked in Darfur on the creation of the Land Commission and development of a land policy. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees worked on reintegrating internally displaced persons and building governance capacity. The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) collaborated with both the FAO and UNHCR to conduct studies of land and property issues related to IDPs. INTERSOS, a nonprofit humanitarian organization, has monitored and mapped secondary land occupation (FAO 2008; Adams and Palmer 2007; Pantuliano 2007).\n\nIn urban areas, UNDP has provided the government with technical support for urban policy development and planning under its Urban Management Programme, which ended in 2009. UN-Habitat and USAID have: supported assessments of land, spatial planning and housing; supported review of legal frameworks governing land rights; and conducted capacity building programs related to urban planning. UN-Habitat has been implementing a project in Darfur to support the resettlement of IDPs, focusing primarily on issues of land tenure and developing alternatives to wood-based housing construction (Pantuliano 2007; UNEP 2007; UN-Habitat 2012b)."
