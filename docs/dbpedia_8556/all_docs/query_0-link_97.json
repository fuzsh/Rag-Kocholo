        "text": "WATER FOR ALL\n\nAs I mentioned on the \"Education for All\" page of this website, there is no shortage of challenges and problems that humans must tackle and arrest before they realize Heaven on Earth for the living. I broadly have categorized them as biological, sociological, and international challenges. There is a growing consensus among scientists that one of the most immediate and urgent challenges facing humankind is the availability of clean, fresh, drinkable water for all inhabitants of Earth.\n\nThis web browser does not support HTML5 videos. Try updating your browser or using the latest Firefox, Chrome, Safari, or Edge web browser.\n\nWatch (NASA | Earth's Water Cycle)\n\nWith about three-fourths or 75% of the Earth's surface covered with water; and with abundant oceans, seas, rivers, lakes, bays, streams, brooks, creeks, and ponds on Earth, some ask, \"How possibly could there be a water crisis or an impending shortage of water on Earth?\" The following videos provide an overview of the water challenge:\n\nWatch (UN: Water: The Drop of Life)\n\nWatch (FAO's Water Scarcity)\n\nWatch (CSBTV20's Water: Who Needs It?)\n\nWatch (NASA / USGS | Landsat: A Space Age Water Gauge)\n\nWatch (Where is Water? - The Water Rooms #2)\n\nAnother component of the scarce freshwater problem is this: There is competition among competing parties to use the available freshwater in society. The main competitors are households, businesses, and governments. Within the business sector, it has been noted that the farming or agriculture industry is the biggest user of freshwater. As more freshwater in a society is allocated to farming, then less becomes available for households and other kinds of businesses to use. The table and images below present a more visual overview of the future freshwater challenge.\n\nTotal Renewable Water Resources (TRWR)\n\nClick gray column headers to sort data in table.

Africa 20,000,000,000 15,603,000 1,282\n\nDATA SOURCE FOR TABLE:\n\nAQUASTAT Main Database | Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)\n\nNote: 1 cubic meter = 1,000 liters and is equivalent to 33,814 USA fluid ounces or 264 USA liquid gallons. It is recommended that each human drink at least 8 glasses of water a day, which is equivalent to 64 ounces, 2 quarts or close to 2 liters of water a day.\n\nAlthough it is not obvious without sorting the above table, based on available data as of 2014, it shows that in a total sense, Brazil, Russia, the USA, Canada, and China, respectively, possess the largest stocks of freshwater. However, on a per person basis, Iceland, Guyana, Suriname, Congo (Brazzaville), and Paupa New Guinea, respectively, possess the largest stocks of freshwater. This total versus per-person availability of freshwater dichotomy suggests that a society's population is an important determinant of freshwater availability. The availability of technology to harness a society's freshwater resources is an important determinant of freshwater use. Ultimately, society decides how fresh water resources are allocated. In some societies, the free market forces of supply, demand, and prices are the chief drivers of freshwater allocation. In other societies, central government officials mainly determine how the society's stock of freshwater is to be allocated. Sometimes a combination of free markets and government subsidies determine how a society's freshwater resources are allocated.\n\nAs the above videos and table illustrate, the answer to the aforementioned question [that is, with about three-fourths or 75% of the Earth's surface covered with water; and with abundant oceans, seas, rivers, lakes, bays, streams, brooks, creeks, and ponds on Earth, how possibly could there be a water crisis or an impending shortage of water on Earth?] is simple. While water is plentiful on Earth, most of the Earth's water is not drinkable or usable by humans in its present form. Moreover, fresh, drinkable water is not equally distributed or equally accessible across Earth. Many bodies of the Earth's water contain salt, undesirable minerals, and other pollutants. Humans would become sick if they drank this untreated water. This unusable water must be treated before it is safe and clean for humans to drink, or before it is fit for growing crops and producing other kinds of products that humans desire. Using current human technology, it is expensive and, in some instances, it is detrimental to the environment to transform large quantities of water into a form that is safe and fit for humans to use. The following videos illustrate contemporary human approaches to desalinate and purify water:\n\nWatch (CSBTV20's Water From Water - Desalination)\n\nWatch (CSBTV20's Ground Water: Banking on the Future of Water Resources)\n\nWatch (CSBTV20's Water From Water - Recycling)\n\nWatch (Faces of \"Soak up the Rain\")\n\nFor the most part, the technology and knowledge exist to tackle the world's water crisis. The obstacles seem to be threefold. On the one hand, there appears to be a shortage of money and human will power to spread this water knowledge and technology around the world. On the other hand, the required technology, knowledge, and expertise primarily tend to be concentrated in the so-called West where they appear to be needed the least urgently. Finally, there are political and cultural barriers to change in some developing countries.\n\nOne development strategy, the they-come-to-us strategy, has been to invite students from developing countries to study in Western colleges and universities. The goal is to provide these students with the knowledge and skills they need to tackle problems such as the water crisis. A drawback to the they-come-to-us strategy has been too few students get the opportunity to study abroad, and some of them tend to remain in the West after completing their studies. Another drawback to the they-come-to-us strategy is that, upon returning home, these students often lack the financial resources and infrastructure needed to apply their newly acquired knowledge and skills on a broad scale.\n\nAnother approach, the we-go-to-them development strategy, has been for church, charitable, non-governmental, and governmental organizations to go to developing countries to share their knowledge and technology. While I am certain that every little bit of assistance helps and is greatly appreciated by the host developing countries, a drawback to the we-go-to-them strategy has been the fact that the assistance usually is not nearly on the scale required to make a significant dent in the problem. Another drawback to the we-go-to-them strategy is this: It is not an integrated, comprehensive, or holistic strategy.\n\nEven if a holistic strategy existed, in some developing countries, sometimes there are other (mainly cultural and political) barriers to overcome. Due to historical and customary preferences for, and preoccupation with, things such as tribalism, animism, spiritualism, sorcery, superstitions, and so forth, sometimes there is intensive resistance to external attempts to change the status quo, say, by bringing a scientific educational curricula into remote villages or, say, by advocating for a more prominent role for women in society. These new ways of doing things often upset established thinking, beliefs, customs, and practices. These new ways of doing things sometimes lead to conflict. The dilemma is this: Without things such as education, organizational and administrative structure, and private property rights, the citizens of developing countries would not be able to maintain their newly constructed water infrastructure. With the passage of time, due to a lack of maintenance or upkeep, the water infrastructure would fall into disrepair and would become dysfunctional. The development attempt would have been futile or a waste of time, effort, and resources. When people own property outright, generally speaking, they seem to exhibit a more sustained commitment to taking good care of the things they own.\n\nKnowing that a water crisis looms over the horizon, it is a signal to students and to businesses that lots of opportunities exist in the field of water development. Some college students might wish to consider studying various methodologies for arresting the world's impending water crisis. This group of students most likely will find good jobs in the water industry. They most likely will earn decent salaries. Businesses might wish to consider supplying the market with innovative water solutions to help alleviate the coming water crisis. Businesses can make money, for instance, by selling their unique solutions to central governments or by achieving greater productive efficiencies when integrating these solutions into their own production processes. IBM Corporation and Procter & Gamble are two such private-sector businesses that appear to be innovative pacesetters in the water crisis arena. There are many lesser known private-sector water innovators, too, such as AquaLocate and Brumby Pumps.\n\nWatch (The Role of Business in Tomorrow's Society)\n\nWatch (\"We Have to Live within the Carrying Capacity of the Earth\")\n\nWatch (Visions of a Sustainable World)\n\nThe following link offers a different perspective on the water crisis.\n\nClick Here to View Another Perspective on the Water Crisis\n\nAdditional Links for the Water Crisis:\n\nTheWaterChannel\n\nThe World's Water\n\nFreshwater Ecoregions of the World\n\nWBCSD - World Business Council for Sustainable Development\n\nRio+20\n\nDimensions of need - Water: A finite resource | FAO\n\nFAO Water, Development and Management Unit\n\nHome | World Bank - Water\n\nIBM Global Innovation Outlook (GIO) - Water and the Oceans\n\nIBM Water Management - United States\n\nArchitecture and Vision - 085 | WarkaWater2 | 2014\n\nGlobal Development And Environment Institute | Water: Economics and Policy | Tufts University\n\nMission and Vision | 2030 Water Resources Group\n\nWhere is Earth's water? |USGS Water-Science School\n\nWater Topics | Environmental Topics | US EPA\n\nFresh Water Resources Around the World | Earth Web Site\n\nWater.org - Water Charity For Safe Water & Sanitation\n\nHomepage | WaterAid Australia\n\nElliot For Water - The search engine that donates water\n\nFLATTER THIS SITE:\n\nSEARCH THIS SITE:\n\nIntellectual Property Disclosures: All videos and songs (as well as many of the images) referenced or spotlighted throughout this website are the legal and intellectual properties of others.
