        "text": "Conflict and insecurity continue to be significant drivers of people's needs in South Sudan. Sub-national and intercommunal violence, crime, and impunity resulted in widespread displacement and hindered access to vital services. The people of South Sudan, especially women and children, experience a severe protection crisis. Levels of violence, exploitation, and abuse are notably high, including conflict-related sexual violence, gender-based violence (GBV), and growing child protection concerns. The 2.2 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) represent the world's fourth most neglected displacement crisis. Concurrently, South Sudan grapples with Africa's largest refugee crisis, with over 2.2 million South Sudanese refugees hosted in neighbouring countries.\n\nWith the onset of the Sudan crisis in April 2023 and a combination of violence and the cessation of food distribution in parts of Ethiopia, thousands of people returned to South Sudan, many of whom are highly vulnerable and arriving in critically underdeveloped areas. More than half a million Sudanese refugees and returnees from South Sudan have registered in South Sudan since the start of the Sudan crisis last April. South Sudan, already in the throes of a worsening humanitarian situation, is seeing its ability to respond become further overstretched.\n\nSouth Sudan also faces severe climate vulnerabilities, ranking as the second most vulnerable country globally to natural hazards according to the 2024 INFORM Risk Index.\n\nPeople’s food security situation has deteriorated due to multiple shocks, including flooding, ongoing conflict, displacement, and a high cost of living. As per the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) of October 2023, approximately 7.1 million individuals of South Sudan's total population of 12.4 million are projected to face crisis-level or more severe acute food insecurity during the lean season from April to July 2024.\n\nMalnutrition rates remain high among children and women in South Sudan – over 2.5 million children and women are at risk of acute malnutrition in 2024,\n\nIn 2024, US$1.8 billion will be needed to reach 6 million of the most vulnerable people. Ramping up timely funding is critical to support the new arrivals from Sudan, in addition to other surging humanitarian needs across the country. Just half of the US$2 billion required was received last year – the lowest level of funding in five years.\n\nWhile the primary objective remains the delivery of life-saving assistance and protection, humanitarian partners are embarking on collaborative efforts with development and peace partners to promote a unified strategy that enhances community resilience in the face of diverse shocks while ensuring lasting solutions for crisis-affected people.\n\nSouth Sudan\n\nNews and Press Release\n\nMs. Edem Wosornu, Director of Operations and Advocacy, OCHA, on behalf of Acting Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Ms. Joyce Msuya - Briefing to the Security Council on South Sudan, 14 August 2024\n\nNew York, 14 August 2024 As delivered Mr. President, members of the Security Council, Thank you for the opportunity to update you on the humanitarian situation in South Sudan, and as raised by SRSG...\n\nSouth Sudan\n\nInfographic\n\nSouth Sudan: Humanitarian Access Snapshot (June 2024)\n\nThe operating environment for humanitarian organizations continued to be difficult in June, with 51 incidents reported affecting humanitarian access.
