The natural increase is expected to be positive, as the number of births will exceed the number of deaths by 330,893. If external migration will remain on the previous year level, the population will be increased by 201,748 due to the migration reasons. It means that the number of people who move into South Sudan (to which they are not native) in order to settle there as permanent residents (immigrants) will prevail over the number of people who leave the country to settle permanently in another country (emigrants).\n\nPopulation change rates in 2024\n\nAccording to our estimations, daily change rates of South Sudan population in 2024 will be the following:\n\n1,334 live births average per day (55.59 in an hour)\n\n428 deaths average per day (17.81 in an hour)\n\n553 immigrants average per day (23.03 in an hour)\n\nThe population of South Sudan will be increasing by 1,459 persons daily in 2024.\n\nDemographics of South Sudan 2023\n\nAs of 1 January 2024, the population of South Sudan was estimated to be 13,058,117 people. This is an increase of 4.08 % (511,766 people) compared to population of 12,546,351 the year before. In 2023 the natural increase was positive, as the number of births exceeded the number of deaths by 317,925. Due to external migration, the population increased by 193,841. The sex ratio of the total population was 1.015 (1,015 males per 1,000 females) which is lower than global sex ratio. The global sex ratio in the world was approximately 1,016 males to 1,000 females as of 2023.\n\nBelow are the key figures for South Sudan population in 2023:\n\n467,853 live births\n\n149,929 deaths\n\nNatural increase: 317,925 people\n\nNet migration: 193,841 people\n\n6,579,109 males as of 31 December 2023\n\n6,479,008 females as of 31 December 2023\n\nGrowth Rate 1952 - 2024\n\nSouth Sudan population density\n\nSouth Sudan population density is 21.1 people per square kilometer (54.6/mi2) as of August 2024. Density of population is calculated as permanently settled population of South Sudan divided by total area of the country. Total area is the sum of land and water areas within international boundaries and coastlines of South Sudan. The total area of South Sudan is 619,745 km2 (239,285 mi2) according to the United Nations Statistics Division .\n\nReligion in South Sudan\n\nReligion Number of followers Percentage of\n\ntotal population Christianity8,104,06760.5 %Folk or traditional religions4,407,00532.9 %Islam817,1046.1 %Religiously Unaffiliated66,9760.5 %\n\nSource: Pew Research Center. The Global Religious Landscape .\n\nNumber of followers estimated by Countrymeters (Monday, August 19 2024).\n\nSouth Sudan age structure\n\nAs of the beginning of 2024 according to our estimates South Sudan had the following population age distribution:\n\n45.9 51.5 2.6\n\n- percentage of population under 15 - percentage of population between 15 and 64 years old - percentage of population 65+\n\nIn absolute figures (estimate):\n\n5,999,682 young people under 15 years old ( 3,063,043 males / 2,936,640 females)\n\n6,720,752 persons between 15 and 64 years old ( 3,378,657 males / 3,342,094 females)\n\n337,683 persons above 64 years old ( 156,175 males / 181,508 females)\n\nWe prepared a simplified model of the population distribution pyramid which is broken down into 3 main age groups. The groups are the same as we used above: population under 15, between 15 and 64 and population which is over 65 year old.\n\n65+\n\n15-64\n\n0-14\n\nmale female\n\nNote: The pyramid provided is not corresponding to data given above because the age groups have different number of years.\n\nAs we can see the South Sudan population pyramid has an expanding type. This type of pyramid is common for developing countries with high birth and death rates. Relatively short life expectancy, as well as low level of education and poor health care are also describe such kind of population age distribution model.\n\nSource: The estimation data for section \"South Sudan age structure\" is based on the latest demographic and social statistics by United Nations Statistics Division .\n\nAge dependency ratio\n\nDependency ratio of population is a ratio of people who are generally not in the labor force (the dependents) to workforce of a country (the productive part of population). The dependent part includes the population under 15 years old and people aged 65 and over. The productive part of population accordingly consists of population between 15 and 64 years.\n\nThis ratio shows the pressure on productive population produced by the dependent part of population.\n\nThe total dependency ratio of population in South Sudan is 94.3 %.\n\nAs we can see the dependent part of population is comparable to the working part. It means that each working person in South Sudan must provide goods for himself and cover expenditure on one child or aged person additionally. The value of 94.3 % shows that the pressure on productive population in South Sudan is very high.\n\nChild dependency ratio\n\nChild dependency ratio is a ratio of people below working age (under 15) to workforce of a country.\n\nChild dependency ratio in South Sudan is 89.3 %.\n\nAged dependency ratio\n\nAged dependency ratio is a ratio of people above working age (65+) to workforce of a country.\n\nAged dependency ratio in South Sudan is 5 %.\n\nSource: The estimation data for section \"South Sudan age dependency ratio\" is based on the latest demographic and social statistics by United Nations Statistics Division .\n\nLife expectancy\n\nLife expectancy at birth is one of the most important demographic indicator. It shows the number of years a newborn infant would live assuming that birth and death rates will remain at the same level during the whole lifetime.\n\nTotal life expectancy (both sexes) at birth for South Sudan is 55.1 years.\n\nThis is below the average life expectancy at birth of the global population which is about 71 years (according to Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations).\n\nMale life expectancy at birth is 54.1 years.\n\nFemale life expectancy at birth is 56 years.\n\nLiteracy of population\n\nAccording to our estimates 2,258,139 persons or 31.99% of adult population (aged 15 years and above) in South Sudan are able to read and write. Accordingly about 4,800,295 adults are illiterate.\n\nLiteracy rate for adult male population is 38.62% (1,365,294 persons). 2,169,538 are illiterate.\n\nLiteracy rate for adult female population is 25.34% (892,846 persons). 2,630,756 are illiterate.\n\nYouth literacy rates are 46.89% and 41.74% for males and females accordingly. The overall youth literacy rate is 44.33%. Youth literacy rate definition covers the population between the ages of 15 to 24 years.\n\nSource: The estimation data for section \"South Sudan population literacy\" is based on the latest data published by UNESCO Institute for Statistics (retrieved March 13, 2016) .\n\nSouth Sudan population history\n\nYearPopulationGrowth Rate 19512,492,017N/A %19522,513,4520.86 %19532,539,1821.02 %19542,568,8521.17 %19552,602,2601.30 %19562,639,1141.42 %19572,679,3591.52 %19582,722,6451.62 %19592,768,8411.70 %19602,817,7181.77 %19612,869,3811.83 %19622,923,5531.89 %19632,980,2891.94 %19643,039,5641.99 %19653,101,7062.04 %19663,166,5242.09 %19673,234,1542.14 %19683,304,6062.18 %19693,378,3082.23 %19703,455,1142.27 %19713,535,2902.32 %19723,618,9032.37 %19733,706,4782.42 %19743,797,8202.46 %19753,893,2542.51 %19763,991,9762.54 %19774,093,5942.55 %19784,199,2652.58 %19794,312,8862.71 %19804,437,5152.89 %19814,575,1323.10 %19824,723,5853.24 %19834,876,9263.25 %19845,025,2083.04 %19855,159,1242.66 %19865,274,8992.24 %19875,374,3641.89 %19885,452,7271.46 %19895,498,5430.84 %19905,502,0230.06 %19915,456,102-0.83 %19925,362,501-1.72 %19935,245,088-2.19 %19945,148,236-1.85 %19955,114,755-0.65 %19965,170,2881.09 %19975,317,5692.85 %19985,537,8224.14 %19995,799,0274.72 %20006,067,3654.63 %20016,324,6144.24 %20026,568,9963.86 %20036,812,9623.71 %20047,075,2683.85 %20057,375,9684.25 %20067,723,1964.71 %20078,112,9515.05 %20088,527,1905.11 %20098,941,2614.86 %20109,326,8204.31 %20119,670,8583.69 %20129,972,9453.12 %201310,235,3312.63 %201410,455,7772.15 %201510,635,9301.72 %201610,774,4081.30 %201710,871,9690.91 %201810,943,6170.66 %201911,019,3730.69 %202011,128,2810.99 %202111,582,2044.08 %202212,054,6424.08 %202312,546,3514.08 %202413,058,1174.08 %\n\nThe data is given as of 1st of January of an year."
