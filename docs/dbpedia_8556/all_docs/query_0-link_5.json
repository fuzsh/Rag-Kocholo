        "text": "This policy paper is written in response to the negative impacts of climate change. The paper takes the case of Climate Change and Human Security in South Sudan. This paper asserts that indeed climate change is being experienced in South Sudan and its negative impact on Human Security is now a reality. The paper focuses on the whole of South Sudan. In order to provide a framework for narrowing some of the gaps that exacerbates the negative impacts of climate change as the case may be to human security. The paper will be informed by some literatures from other countries facing similar challenges. In addition the link between climate change, human security and conflict will also be highlighted as evidence suggest that in recent years, climatic changes compounded by the legacy of a civil war spanning three decades have resulted in a dramatic increase in both the frequency and the intensity of the violence associated with cattle raiding among pastoralists in South Sudan.\n\nClimate change (CC) is the present reality of the planet earth. It brought several negative effects. Among them 'conflict' is being considered as one. Though there is enough debate on CC as a direct causal effect on conflict. But the evidences that are occurring as the direct manifestation of CC cannot be ignored either. Forced migration due to extreme weather conditions is one of those parameters. It is taking the shape of a global security risk by contributing and igniting civil wars and conflicts in several regions. This study will focus on the case of Darfur, Sudan. The continuous civil war stricken region poses a serious threat to the region and lapse of severe human rights. The role of the international community and the national government will be covered as well. The study will debate as to how far the link between CC and conflict is valid and true.\n\nOnce it was an environmental issue, then an energy problem, now climate change is being recast as a security threat. So far, the debate has focused on creating a security ‘hook’, illustrated by anecdote, to invest climate negotiations with a greater sense of urgency. Political momentum behind the idea of climate change as a security threat has progressed quickly, even reaching the United Nations Security Council. This article reviews the linkages between climate change and security in Africa and analyses the role of climate change adaptation policies in future conflict prevention. Africa, with its history of ethnic, resource and interstate conflict, is seen by many as particularly vulnerable to this new type of security threat, despite being the continent least responsible for global greenhouse gas emissions. Projected climatic changes for Africa suggest a future of increasingly scarce water, collapsing agricultural yields, encroaching desert and damaged coastal infrastructure. Such impacts, should they occur, would undermine the ‘carrying capacity’ of large parts of Africa, causing destabilizing population movements and raising tensions over dwindling strategic resources. In such cases, climate change could be a factor that tips fragile states into socio-economic and political collapse.Climate change is only one of many security, environmental and developmental challenges facing Africa. Its impacts will be magnified or moderated by underlying conditions of governance, poverty and resource management, as well as the nature of climate change impacts at local and regional levels. Adaptation policies and programmes, if implemented quickly and at multiple scales, could help avert climate change and other environmental stresses becoming triggers for conflict. But, adaptation must take into account existing social, political and economic tensions and avoid exacerbating them.\n\nHow has climate change affected the dynamics of conflicts in Africa? Existing exploration demonstrates that climate change can build the danger of conflicts or essentially adjust the elements of existing conflicts. This article addresses the issue in regard to the primary efficient audit of both quantitative and qualitative methods. We assess the degree the literature gives coherent clarifications that distinguish important systems, actors, and results. The article discusses contribution of climate change to violence in African citing different examples and specific situations where climatic factors impacts lead to conflict. The effect of environmental change is progressively explained as one of the most genuine security threats in future and a far more prominent risk to the world's stability than terrorism. For a few, current clashes for instance in Darfur may be partly because of climatical change. It is contended that environmental change incorporates the danger of reshaping the landscape, worsening sustenance, water and vitality shortages and adding to destabilization, unregulated populace developments and tension. Regardless of whether natural changes actuate expanded challenge between users of scarce resources. Drawing on recent instances on conflicts between pastoralist communities in eastern Africa, the move from expanded challenge over resources to open conflict relies on existing adapting limits of social orders and the strategies, establishments and procedures that characterize access to resources.\n\nThe issue of climate change and the social risks associated with it has continued to take a centre stage in every development discourse around the world. The Niger Delta region of Nigeria is known to be more disproportionately affected by the problem of climate change in the country with diverse manifestations such as rise in sea level leading to massive flooding, coastal erosion, and desertification among others. This adverse climate scenario dovetail with other social problems to exacerbate the security challenges of the region. As a result, this paper examines the issue of climate change risks and human security challenges in the Niger Delta region especially its implication for policy makers. To achieve this aim, the paper relies on robust content analysis of secondary information in addition to observational techniques for its data. The paper argues that risks associated with climate change would pose more threat to human security in the Niger Delta region than illicit social activities such as youth restiveness and militia movements in the long run if not checked through conscious policy formulation and implementation. In the light of the foregoing submission, the paper recommends among others that climate change and or environmental policies should be put in place and strictly enforced in order to reduce or completely address the associated human security challenges such as emerging conflicts over fishing and farming grounds among others. INTRODUCTION Globally, climate change and the numerous social risks associated with it remain at the apex of every development agenda. This is because, climate change has been linked to increasing rate of environmental disasters such as drought, desertification, rise in sea level and flooding across the world (IPCC, 2007) with adverse consequences for other sectors of human social existence. Hence, there is a growing recognition that climate change related environmental disasters can undermine human security by igniting local and regional violent conflicts mostly through shrinking of natural resource holdings across the world. Salehyan (2008) as well as Brown and Crawford (2008) have argued that climate change can cause conflicts and pose human security challenges by creating adverse conditions that undermine basic human needs and can reduce governmental capacity to provide social welfare services. Similarly, Brancati (2007) and Keefer (2009) pointed out that climate change can cause resource scarcity, which may trigger competition and a reduction of governments' capacity to provide for people's needs."
