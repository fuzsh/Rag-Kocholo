        "text": "Humanitarian needs keep increasing as donor funding continues to decline\n\nSince March 2024, humanitarian needs in South Sudan have begun to rise higher than projected, largely due to the protracted conflict in Sudan. This has compounded the existing challenges facing South Sudan, including insecurity, violence, displacement, hunger, and severe flooding. It’s also disrupted international trade, and has led to an influx of both refugees and returnees. In January and February 2024 alone, an average of 1,500 to 2,000 individuals crossed into South Sudan every day, bringing the estimated total number of arrivals since April 2023 to over 660,000.\n\nAn estimated 9 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance in 2024. The latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis estimates that 7.1 million people — roughly 56% of the population — will face acute food insecurity during this year’s lean season (April to July).\n\nSouth Sudan also faces a challenge this December with the country’s first-ever elections. However, this is likely to trigger tensions and localised disruptions, while ongoing issues surrounding the conflict in Sudan and poor macroeconomic conditions could divert government attention away from the election, as well as critical national, state, and border security challenges."
