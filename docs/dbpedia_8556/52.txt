Publication Summary

On Thursday, April 6, 2023, South Sudan’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), in collaboration with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and other agencies, released what it calls Population Estimation Survey results (PES), putting the population at 12.45 million. Looking back 13 years, one must come to term with the realization that South Sudan’s population has supposedly grown by nearly 4% (3.9) annually, higher than it did in prior decades. The new estimates are in stark contrast with South Sudan’s 2008 census counts which stood at 8.26 million, informing the 2010 regional and national elections. These estimates have so far generated heated debates in various quarters, with many outright contesting them for a host of good reasons.

This Review, therefore, analyzes the scientific, political, and policy implications of the PES’s results.
