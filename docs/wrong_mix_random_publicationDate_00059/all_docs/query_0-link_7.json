Planck was best known for his pioneering work in quantum physics. When he graduated secondary school at age 17, one of his advisors told him not to go into physics since “In this field, almost everything is already discovered, and all that remains is to fill a few holes.” Despite the warning, Planck continued with the field and eventually got a doctorate in theoretical physics. Planck’s work in entropy, the theory that all atomic movement is random, proved to be influential in his future endeavors. Planck first gained fame in 1894 when he solved the black body problem. German physicist Gustav Kirchhoff put it this way: “how does the intensity of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a black body (a perfect absorber, also known as a cavity radiator) depend on the frequency of the radiation (i.e., the color of the light) and the temperature of the body?” After a few years of testing, Planck came up with his Planck postulate, which stated that the energy from a black body equals a constant h (now known as the Planck constant, which is around 6.626 x 10^-34 joules-seconds) times the frequency of the wave. This theory would lay the foundation to modern understandings of quantum mechanics. By 1918, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work. Planck remained a leader and well-known teacher in physics until his death. #rip #maxplanck #physics #quantum\".",
