This ambition took me to an honors degree in physics from the University of Sydney in Australia and later to a PhD in astronomy. Afterward, I joined Sydney Observatory, initially as one of four astronomers, and later, after the Observatory became part of a large museum, as Curator of Astronomy. During my 30 years working full-time at Sydney Observatory, I became intrigued by the history of astronomy. A manifestation of that interest was the 2011 book Transit of Venus: 1631 to the Present and, more recently, my book, listed below.\n\nNick's book list on spectacles in nature total eclipses of the Sun\n\nWhy did Nick love this book?\n\nThis satirical novel, with a total eclipse of the Sun at its heart, was one of the most loved books of my childhood.

When he wakes up he finds himself in Britain in 528 — where he is immediately captured, hauled back to Camelot to be exhibited before the knights of King Arthur's Round Table, and sentenced to death. Things are not looking good.\n\nBut Hank is a quick-witted and enterprising fellow, and in the process of saving his life he turns himself into a celebrity of the highest magnitude. His Yankee ingenuity and knowledge of the world…\n\nPreview\n\nEclipse\n\nBy Duncan Steel,\n\nFrom my list on spectacles in nature total eclipses of the Sun.\n\nBy Nick Lomb Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nFascination by the night sky as a young child led to an ambition to become an astronomer.

A manifestation of that interest was the 2011 book Transit of Venus: 1631 to the Present and, more recently, my book, listed below.\n\nNick's book list on spectacles in nature total eclipses of the Sun\n\nWhy did Nick love this book?\n\nI like how easily understandable this book is with its short sections and informative diagrams. Historical eclipses are described; these include the famous story of how, in 1504, Christopher Columbus supposedly used a total eclipse of the Moon to frighten Jamaican natives into supplying him and his crew with food.\n\nMy favorite section, though, is the book’s appendix, which gives simple explanations of important but complex phenomena, such as the precession of the equinoxes, the different types of months, and how often eclipses repeat. The best part is that the calculations in the appendix can be followed using just a basic calculator.\n\nBy Duncan Steel,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Eclipse as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIn August 1999, for the first time in more than 70 years, the northern hemisphere will experience a total eclipse of the sun. This book is an engaging, accessible and authoritative account of this phenomenon and how it has affected humanity from the beginning of time. Author is Adelaide-based director of Spaceguard Australia.\n\nPreview\n\nEmpire and the Sun\n\nBy Alex Soojung-Kim Pang,\n\nFrom my list on spectacles in nature total eclipses of the Sun.\n\nBy Nick Lomb Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nFascination by the night sky as a young child led to an ambition to become an astronomer. This ambition took me to an honors degree in physics from the University of Sydney in Australia and later to a PhD in astronomy.

The book looks at expeditions to study total eclipses of the Sun organised by the major British scientific groups.\n\nHowever, instead of focusing on their instruments and what observations they made, the author considers how the expeditions were planned and how the infrastructure of the British Empire was essential to the expeditions.\n\nRelevant infrastructure included steamships and railroads that enabled astronomers to reach their destinations and telegraph lines to establish the correct time and relay their results.\n\nBy Alex Soojung-Kim Pang,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Empire and the Sun as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nAstronomy was a popular and important part of Victorian science, and British astronomers carried telescopes and spectroscopes to remote areas of India, the Great Plains of North America, and islands in the Caribbean and Pacific to watch the sun eclipsed by the moon. Examining the rich interplay between science, culture, and British imperial society in the late nineteenth century, this book shows how the organization and conduct of scientific fieldwork was structured by contemporary politics and culture, and how rapid and profound changes in the organization of science, advances in photography, and new printing technology remade the character of scientific…\n\nPreview\n\nSecrets of the Sun\n\nBy Ronald G. Giovanelli,\n\nFrom my list on spectacles in nature total eclipses of the Sun.\n\nBy Nick Lomb Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nFascination by the night sky as a young child led to an ambition to become an astronomer. This ambition took me to an honors degree in physics from the University of Sydney in Australia and later to a PhD in astronomy. Afterward, I joined Sydney Observatory, initially as one of four astronomers, and later, after the Observatory became part of a large museum, as Curator of Astronomy. During my 30 years working full-time at Sydney Observatory, I became intrigued by the history of astronomy. A manifestation of that interest was the 2011 book Transit of Venus: 1631 to the Present and, more recently, my book, listed below.\n\nNick's book list on spectacles in nature total eclipses of the Sun\n\nWhy did Nick love this book?\n\nI like this book, since it gives the basic science of the Sun and its atmosphere. Although written for the interested layman, it can be a little technical, and there have been many developments since the book was published in 1984. Still, it is readable, and the underlying physics of the Sun has not changed since that time.\n\nMy favorite chapter, as it relates to eclipses, is the one on the Sun’s outer atmosphere, the corona, which only becomes visible during the few minutes of totality. The author explains that almost all of the corona's light is scattered light, by electrons close to the Sun and dust further out. He also discusses the corona’s surprisingly high temperature of a million or so degrees Celsius.\n\nBy Ronald G. Giovanelli,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Secrets of the Sun as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nDiscusses the structure and rotation of the sun, sunspots, magnetic fields, sunspot cycles, the corona, and solar flares\n\nPreview\n\nTime and Chance\n\nBy David Z. Albert,\n\nFrom my list on the biggest questions.\n\nBy Steven E. Landsburg Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nAs far back as I can remember, I’ve spent a lot of time worrying about things like why there is something instead of nothing, why we can remember the past but not the future, and how consciousness arises. Although I’m a professor of economics, I take such things seriously enough to have published some papers in philosophy journals, and even a whole book about philosophy called The Big Questions. These are some of the books that sharpened my thinking, inspired me to think more deeply, and convinced me that good writing can render deep ideas both accessible and fun.\n\nSteven's book list on the biggest questions\n\nWhy did Steven love this book?\n\nI vividly remember reading this book some years ago. You probably don’t remember it at all, even if you’re going to take my advice and read it tomorrow. That’s pretty odd when you think about. Why should we remember the past but not the future?\n\nIt does no good to echo platitudes like “the future hasn’t happened yet”. You could as well say “the past is already over”, which is equally true and equally irrelevant. The laws of physics tie the past to the present and the future to the present in exactly the same way. Any process that can run one direction in time can run in the other. So if the past can leave imprints on our memory, why can’t the future?\n\nDavid Albert wants to make you appreciate the question, and then he wants to tell you the answer. Albert is that rarest of birds: A philosopher…\n\nBy David Z. Albert,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Time and Chance as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThis book is an attempt to get to the bottom of an acute and perennial tension between our best scientific pictures of the fundamental physical structure of the world and our everyday empirical experience of it. The trouble is about the direction of time. The situation (very briefly) is that it is a consequence of almost every one of those fundamental scientific pictures--and that it is at the same time radically at odds with our common sense--that whatever can happen can just as naturally happen backwards.\n\nAlbert provides an unprecedentedly clear, lively, and systematic new account--in the context of a…\n\nPreview\n\nTaking the Quantum Leap\n\nBy Fred A. Wolf,\n\nFrom my list on spirituality, consciousness and nature of reality.\n\nBy Tracy J Holroyd Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI am a writer and lecturer who is irresistibly drawn to the spiritual and paranormal, but whose academic qualifications are in maths and science. So, I have struggled to find my niche in life: a belief in God and Spirit, a passion for the ‘paranormal,’ and an attraction to the scientific – subjects whose advocates attack one another without compunction. Then, I watched the film What the Bleep Do We Know? and found the communion of spirit and science that had eluded me for so long. Thus, I have a new passion: quantum physics, consciousness, and the creation of reality – which means, for me, the Universe is truly full of magic.\n\nTracy's book list on spirituality, consciousness and nature of reality\n\nWhy did Tracy love this book?\n\nI was so impressed by What the Bleep… that I wanted to learn more, so turned to one of its contributors: theoretical physicist, Fred Alan Wolf. In Taking the Quantum Leap, the quirky Dr. Wolf waltzed me through the history of physics, until I arrived (breathless with anticipation!) at the biggie: the ‘new science’ of the 20th century; the science that practically threw the scientific community into turmoil. Dr. Wolf not only linked this plethora of knowledge to consciousness, but also equipped me, as a layperson, with the mental tools required to indulge in some deep scientific, philosophical, and spiritual discourse. Without a doubt, casually throwing his subject into conversation leaves me looking very impressive intellectually. Only problem: no one invites me to parties anymore….\n\nBy Fred A. Wolf,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Taking the Quantum Leap as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThis book entertainingly traces the history of physics from the observations of the earlyGreeks through the discoveries of Galileo and Newton to the dazzling theories of such scientists as Planck, Einstein, Bohr, and Bohm. This humanized view of science opens up the mind-stretching visions of how quantum mechanics, God, human thought, and will are related, and provides profound implications for our understanding of the nature of reality and our relationship to the cosmos.\n\nPreview\n\nThe Variational Principles of Mechanics\n\nBy Cornelius Lanczos,\n\nFrom my list on titles for physics graduate students.\n\nBy Andrew Zangwill Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI am a physics professor with a passion for teaching. When I was a graduate student, I took required courses in classical mechanics, classical electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, and statistical mechanics. Some of the textbooks assigned by my professors were good; some were not so good. In every case, it was extremely helpful to read what other authors had to say about these foundational subjects. Four of the five books I recommend below are my personal favorites among these serious physics books. My fifth book choice is less serious and does not teach physics, but it will improve your graduate student experience nonetheless.\n\nAndrew's book list on titles for physics graduate students\n\nWhy did Andrew love this book?\n\nI love this book! Of course, it teaches the mathematics of the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian approaches to classical mechanics. But its real uniqueness lies in how the author explains the basic concepts of the subject with a constant emphasis on intuitive physics. It was only after reading Lanczos that I finally understood what variational calculations were really about. Ditto for virtual work, non-holonomic constraints, Liouville’s theorem and Hamilton-Jacobi theory. I barely noticed that I was learning about the history and philosophy of classical mechanics at the same time.\n\nBy Cornelius Lanczos,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Variational Principles of Mechanics as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nAnalytical mechanics is, of course, a topic of perennial interest and usefulness in physics and engineering, a discipline that boasts not only many practical applications, but much inherent mathematical beauty. Unlike many standard textbooks on advanced mechanics, however, this present text eschews a primarily technical and formalistic treatment in favor of a fundamental, historical, philosophical approach. As the author remarks, there is a tremendous treasure of philosophical meaning\" behind the great theories of Euler and Lagrange, Hamilton, Jacobi, and other mathematical thinkers.\n\nWell-written, authoritative, and scholarly, this classic treatise begins with an introduction to the variational principles of mechanics including…\n\nPreview\n\nQuantum Non-Locality and Relativity\n\nBy Tim Maudlin,\n\nFrom my list on nonlocality, teleportation, and other quantum marvels.\n\nBy Nicolas Gisin Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI am totally fascinated by the quest of how Nature does it. In particular, I love the fact that humans managed to enters the strange world of atoms and photons by just using their brute intellectual force and imagination. This world obeys precise rules, but very different ones from those we get used to since childhood. For example, the laws that govern the microscopic world allow for indeterminacy and randomness. Moreover, some random events may manifest themselves at several locations at once, leading to the phenomenon of quantum non-locality. I am very fortunate that I could spend all my professional time on such fascinating conceptual questions, combined with highly timely new technologies.\n\nNicolas' book list on nonlocality, teleportation, and other quantum marvels\n\nWhy did Nicolas love this book?\n\nThis is a wonderful and highly convincing analysis of quantum non-locality, written by one of the top expert philosophers of science. Personally, I learned a lot from this book, which clearly influenced me and helped me to become an expert in the field. The book goes deep into explaining why we live in a world full of non-local correlations and what that means. It analyses in depth the tension between quantum non-locality and relativity. Moreover, it contains several original ideas, like, e.g., how many bits of communication are needed to simulate quantum non-locality. It is still today a very timely book.\n\nBy Tim Maudlin,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Quantum Non-Locality and Relativity as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nModern physics was born from two great revolutions: relativity and quantum theory. Relativity imposed a locality constraint on physical theories: since nothing can go faster than light, very distant events cannot influence one another. Only in the last few decades has it become clear that quantum theory violates this constraint. The work of J. S. Bell has demonstrated that no local theory can return the predictions of quantum theory. Thus it would seem that the central pillars of modern physics are contradictory. Quantum Non-Locality and Relativity examines the nature and possible resolution of this conflict. Beginning with accurate but non-technical…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Quantum Dissidents\n\nBy Olival Freire Junior,\n\nWhy did Nicolas love this book?\n\nThis book tells the fascinating story of the people and events behind the turbulent changes in attitudes to quantum theory in the second half of the 20th century. Science is sometimes quite abstract. But it is made by very concrete persons whose characters shape the various scientific communities.\n\nBy Olival Freire Junior,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Quantum Dissidents as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThis book tells the fascinating story of the people and events behind the turbulent changes in attitudes to quantum theory in the second half of the 20th century. The huge success of quantum mechanics as a predictive theory has been accompanied, from the very beginning, by doubts and controversy about its foundations and interpretation. This book looks in detail at how research on foundations evolved after WWII, when it was revived, until the mid 1990s, when most of this research merged into the technological promise of quantum information. It is the story of the quantum dissidents, the scientists who brought…\n\nPreview\n\nThirty Years That Shook Physics\n\nBy George Gamow,\n\nWhy did Eric love this book?\n\nGamow, one of the greatest popularizers of science and a leading nuclear researcher, clearly describes for non-scientific audiences the drama of the early evolution of quantum theory.\n\nFor those who think, based on current popularization, that quantum mechanics is akin to mysticism, this book shows how the quantum debates evolved in real life. Gamow, unlike current popularizers, does not assume that the debates have been resolved in favor of some nonsensical obscurantism.\n\nBy George Gamow,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Thirty Years That Shook Physics as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n\"Dr. Gamow, physicist and gifted writer, has sketched an intriguing portrait of the scientists and clashing ideas that made the quantum revolution.\" — Christian Science Monitor\n\nIn 1900, German physicist Max Planck postulated that light, or radiant energy, can exist only in the form of discrete packages or quanta. This profound insight, along with Einstein's equally momentous theories of relativity, completely revolutionized man's view of matter, energy, and the nature of physics itself.\n\nIn this lucid layman's introduction to quantum theory, an eminent physicist and noted popularizer of science traces the development of quantum theory from the turn of the…\n\nPreview"
