Two pages of ads in the back and page [1] is blank. Original green pictorial cloth, gilt, with floral endpapers (copies are also found with geometric patterned end papers; no priority). Mere trace of rubbing at spine tips, but a near fine copy. In recent scholarship this landmark time-travel science fiction work has been proposed as Mark Twain's \"other masterpiece\" because of its frame narrative structure and its disturbing social themes. Housed in a custom-made collector's slipcase."
