The document provides a synopsis and themes of Mark Twain's novel \"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\". The synopsis outlines the plot where a man from 19th century Connecticut is transported to 6th century England during the time of King Arthur. He attempts to modernize society using his knowledge of science and technology. However, he faces opposition from the existing power structures. A major theme is the clash between science and the prevalent superstitions of the medieval period. The man uses science to appear magical and elevate his own status, rather than truly educating people.",
