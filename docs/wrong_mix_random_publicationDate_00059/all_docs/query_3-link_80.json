Somewhere in the series there is a tower with a mad woman in it who scribbles onto a wall. There is also a siege of the castle where the boy devises a strategy where they build a second wall in the courtyard and they let the assailants through but close the gate and then slaughter them all.\n\nI read the book when I was a child more than ten years ago and it came to mind recently."
