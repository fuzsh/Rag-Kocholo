        "text": "Dear Kelsey,\n\nYour decision to set aside A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur‚Äôs Court has quite possibly been the most controversial decision of our blog. I‚Äôve had several people implore me to ‚Äúmake Kelsey finish Connecticut Yankee!‚Äù and list all the reasons they love it. To which I agree, emphatically, and proceed to once more revise my post on Why I Think Connecticut Yankee Is Funny And That Kelsey Should Read It.\n\nBut the thing is, although I do think Connecticut Yankee is funny and I most definitely agree that Kelsey should read it, I don‚Äôt really have that much to say on the subject. Explaining humor is a funny business. (eh? Get it?) One of the hardest assignments in my entire academic career was an essay prompt for Art Leo‚Äôs Comedy class: Explain a Joke.\n\nHumor is, of course, subjective, and explaining why I think something is funny is not only a tedious and usually humorless endeavor, but it takes all the fun out of the joke, still might not convince the other person that it‚Äôs funny, and also sort of condescends to the person you‚Äôre explaining to. Oh, you see, it‚Äôs ironic‚Ä¶you do know what irony is‚Ä¶don‚Äôt you?\n\nNo, thank you.\n\nSince we so are so often unable to explain humor, we seem to instead turn to describing it. I could tell you that the book is ‚Äúuproarious; laugh-out-loud funny,‚Äù but that could refer just as easily to Mark Twain as to Mystery Science Theater 3000 or Twilight: Breaking Dawn.\n\nBut, since this was the kind of book that made me interrupt other people in order to share the latest clever thing Twain wrote, I will share two quick lines. These aren‚Äôt even the funniest ones in the book, they just happen to be the two I wrote down when I remembered I was supposed to be taking notes. So without further ado:\n\nHank Morgan on reliable narration: The masters of the castle were three stupendous brothers, each with four arms and one eye‚Äîthe eye in the center of the forehead, and as big as a fruit. Sort of fruit was not mentioned; their usual slovenliness in statistics.\n\nHank Morgan on early advertising: There were no stoves yet, and so there could be nothing serious about stove-polish. All that the agent needed to do was to deftly and by degrees prepare the public for the great change, and have them established in predilections toward neatness against the time when the stove should appear upon the stage.\n\nSo, Kelsey, that‚Äôs all the coercion you‚Äôll have to suffer from me. I‚Äôm going to talk about one more thing, but others, please feel free to add your favorite line or persuasion attempts in the comments below.\n\nI think a lot of books work very hard to evoke a particular mood or feeling, making the reader ‚Äúlost in a book.‚Äù There are exceptions, of course, and novels that have some shocking twist where everything after is different (Looking for Alaska, perhaps, is a good example), but in a lot of ways, I think we come to expect a consistent tone.\n\nConnecticut Yankee chucks all of that out the window.\n\nHank Morgan is man with many contradictory beliefs and opinions (and, let‚Äôs be real, absolutely ridiculous ones as well), which leads to a narrative that can swing wildly between comedy and pathos. I could never quite tell whether a scene would end with absurdism, tragedy, poignancy, or a punchline until it became abundantly clear that oh, no, now we‚Äôre crying not laughing.\n\nOne of the unexpected side effects to everyone telling me how much they loved the book was how unprepared I was for these shifts. I had heard so much about the hilarity and clever wittiness that, for most of the book, I saw only what I expected to see. There are many instances of Hank‚Äôs cruelty and callousness that I simply overlooked because the rest of the scenes were so funny. I would react strongly to a chilling anecdote and then a few minutes later get distracted by the burlesque.\n\nWhen there was no humorous denouement to distract me from the bleak conclusion, I was deeply shocked. My advisor‚Äîno joke‚Äîreceived an email from her distraught post-grad begging for an explanation because I had no way to interpret what I‚Äôd just read. (And may I interject for a moment to say I have (had?? I think not.) the Best. Advisor. Ever. )\n\nBut while I‚Äôve finally found a lens through which the narrative makes sense again*, I‚Äôm finding myself more and more curious about how everyone else accounts for these moments. Are you overlooking Hank‚Äôs paradoxical nature? Was I simply unprepared because of the hype? Or are you simply finding your own explanation to make sense of it all? ‚Ä¶because if so, what is it??\n\nI‚Äôm pretty sure this last section isn‚Äôt going to win you over, but I also know that if you do pick it back up, you don‚Äôt have my advisor‚Äôs email address. So I‚Äôll finish my discussion on our first Classic Work of Literature by saying that all the cool kids like Connecticut Yankee üòâ\n\nLove,\n\nP.S. Not caving to peer pressure is also cool. As are bow ties.\n\nP.P.S. Today, it seems, is Mark Twain‚Äôs 127th birthday. Yeah‚Ä¶I totally planned that.\n\n*if I had to come up with a thesis, I‚Äôd probably argue that Hank‚Äôs downfall was initiated by adopting the behaviors he swears to stamp out. Though he scorns the ‚Äúsuperstitions‚Äù of the Camelot locals (especially in regards to Merlin), he still depends on it for his successes. Also, I‚Äôd argue that readers probably shouldn‚Äôt ignore half the book.\n\nDear Kelsey,\n\nAs you know (because I mention it all the time), something I‚Äôve been really looking forward to is discussing our Book Club books more than once. And don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre off the hook because you quit reading‚ÄîI fully expect you to pick this book up again someday. But now that we‚Äôre starting a few novels that will take longer to finish, I‚Äôm excited to talk about our books as we‚Äôre reading, not just when we‚Äôre finished and it‚Äôs time to post. Or when we give up. I think it‚Äôs pretty typical to take a certain position when you finish something‚Äîeven if it‚Äôs as simple as ‚Äúlike it‚Äù or ‚Äúloathe it‚Äù‚Äîand part of what makes me so excited about midway-posts is that it will be challenging and delightful to discuss the process of reading the books and to watch as our opinions shift and develop.\n\nWith that in mind, I‚Äôve decided to talk about Mark Twain‚Äôs A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur‚Äôs Court before I‚Äôve really even started the book. As you might expect, I already have a lot to say.\n\nI‚Äôve been interested in reading Connecticut Yankee ever since I dropped a class in which it was read and watched all my friends laughing their heads off and absolutely loving it (Ryan‚Äôs comment on your post indicates this nicely). I was insanely jealous‚Äînot in the least because they were all reading these Beautiful, Authoritative, Mark Twain Library editions that matched my Beautiful, Authoritative, Mark Twain Library edition of Huck Finn.\n\nThough I became briefly obsessed with buying said Mark Twain Library edition when we decided to read it for Book Club, the reissued (read: non-matching) cover and non-negligible price tag sent me to the public library, where I checked out a version illustrated by Caldecott medalist Trina Schart Hyman.\n\nAs you can see from the covers, the two editions seem to offer very different approaches to Twain‚Äôs story. Tagged with words like Definitive, Authoritative, and Original Manuscript, the MTL edition is very much offering a scholarly, critical approach, whereas Hyman‚Äôs storybook illustrations make the book far less intimidating. As you noted, however, Twain‚Äôs original manuscript is also illustrated, by a man named Dan Beard, and to exercise my Visual Rhetoric skillz (Visual Rhetoric, by the way, was the class I took instead of the one with Mark Twain), I thought I‚Äôd compare the two versions.\n\nTo my mind the illustrations are better than the book‚Äìwhich is a good deal for me to say, I reckon.\n\n‚ÄìMark Twain on A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur‚Äôs Court\n\nAs you can see, these illustrations (Hyman above, Beard below) depict a very similar scene: a knight rides off toward Camelot, a castle high on a distant hill. But there‚Äôs a small distinction that I thought became more and more pronounced as I compared the two versions.\n\nBy incorporating the first letter of ‚ÄúCamelot‚Äù into the picture, the original illustration becomes necessary to understanding the text. It‚Äôs a subtle move, but Beard‚Äôs image distances itself from pure decoration because we must ‚Äúread‚Äù the image in order to understand the words. In contrast (and you can also see this in some of the following pictures), Hyman‚Äôs illustrations are confined to the same size and placement in every chapter, essentially a decorative border.\n\nWhen she provides additional illustrations (such as this beautiful watercolor), they are set off alone on a single page, whereas Beard‚Äôs interrupts, bisects, and twines around Twain‚Äôs story.\n\nI don‚Äôt really want to offer an argument about the superiority or appropriateness of the different illustrators; I know I tend to err on the side of the traditionalist (Twilight Inspired Covers Rant, anyone?), but I also think they serve different purposes and very different audiences. Whether this is a good thing is, I think, a discussion for another time. And I don‚Äôt say that because I have a definite opinion and I‚Äôm trying to be coy‚ÄîI really do think there are a lot of sides to the issue and I‚Äôm not sure which one I‚Äôm on yet.\n\nBut back to Beard and Hyman. At the risk of overanalyzing, I would suggest they‚Äôre offering different arguments on the nature of illustrated text. Beard‚Äôs illustrations cannot be ignored‚Äîthey interrupt and demand to be read‚Äîif only by containing some of the text within them. Hyman‚Äôs act more as a supplement: safely confined to definitive borders, they can be observed or ignored at will.\n\nWhatever approach you prefer (and perhaps you should try a version like Hyman‚Äôs, the different style of art and formatting might feel less ‚Äúassigned‚Äù), I think they offer pretty different reading experiences. I have actually put a MTL edition on hold, now, because I was curious about my own reaction to the different artists.\n\nThis post is getting quite long now, but I also wanted to draw attention to the matter of interpretation. As these two Merlins demonstrate, the depiction of certain characters can certainly influence your perception of them. Beard‚Äôs take is on the top with Hyman‚Äôs below, and I think there‚Äôs a significant difference in the realism and power each one seems to command.\n\nFinally: a quote. As Mark Twain wrote to his publisher, ‚ÄúTell Beard to obey his own inspiration, & when he sees a picture in his mind, put that picture on paper, be it humorous or be it serious. I want his genius to be wholly unhampered, I shan‚Äôt have any fear as to the result.‚Äù\n\nWhether or not this sets aside the issue of literary merit, I think it‚Äôs lovely.\n\nTo appropriate another quote from Mark Twain: sorry this post is so long, I didn‚Äôt have time to make it shorter.\n\nLove,\n\nP.S. I have so many books languishing around that I‚Äôve convinced myself I‚Äôm still reading because I don‚Äôt want to admit to giving up on them. I wonder if you feel like you‚Äôre ‚Äúquitting‚Äù books more than you used to because we now have to account for them. Before book club, you could set something aside and it was never a huge deal, but now you have to think of reasons and excuses and even Make A Final Decision about continuing on or quitting entirely.\n\nP.P.S. Apparently, my closing quote is also attributed to Marie Curie, George Bernard Shaw, Oscar Wilde, Voltaire, and other clever people. Nobody, in a quick google search, seems to know the correct origins."
