        "text": "Historical perspective\n\nIt was barely 14 days after the announcement of the discovery of Roentgen rays that Friedrich Otto Walkhoff took the first dental radiograph. He took an ordinary photographic glass plate, wrapped it in a rubber dam, held it in his mouth between his teeth and tongue and then lay on the floor for a 25 min exposure. Walkhoff said that those 25 min of exposure were a torture to him.1 However, the exact nature of this torture has not been described. Later, in 1896, Walkhoff succeeded in making extra-oral pictures with an exposure time of 30 min. He noticed a loss of hair on the side of the head of some of the patients he irradiated,2 but as there was no mention of blisters on the skin it is assumed that the absorbed dose was less than 300 rads.\n\nIn 1896, Otto Walkhoff and Fritz Giesel established the first dental roentgenological laboratory in the world. For many years the laboratory provided practitioners with images of the jaw and head. Fritz Giesel later died in 1927 of metastatic carcinoma caused by heavy radiation exposure to his hands.3\n\nIn February 1896 a child who had been accidentally shot in the head was brought to the laboratory at Vanderbilt University (Tennessee, USA). Before attempting to locate the bullet in the child, Professor Daniel and Dr Dudley decided to undertake an experiment. Dr Dudley, with his characteristic devotion to science, lent himself to this experiment. A plate holder containing the sensitive plate was tied to one side of Dudley's head and the tube attached to the opposite side of the head. The tube was placed 0.5 inches away from Dudley's hair and activated for 1 h. After 21 days all the hair fell out from the space under discharge, which was approximately 2 inches in diameter.4\n\nOn 12 August 1896, Electrical Review reported that Dr HD Hawks, a graduate of the 1896 class of Columbia College, gave a demonstration with a powerful X-ray unit in the vicinity of New York.5 After 4 days, he was compelled to stop work. He noticed a drying of the skin, which he ignored. The hand began to swell and gave the appearance of a deep skin burn. After 2 weeks the skin came off the hand, the knuckles become very sore, fingernail growth stopped and the hair on the skin exposed to X-rays fell out. His eyes were bloodshot and his vision became considerably impaired. His chest was also burnt. Mr Hawks' physician treated this as a case of dermatitis. Hawks tried protecting his hands with petroleum jelly, then gloves and finally by covering it with tin foil. Within 6 weeks Hawks was partially recovered and was making light of his injuries. Electrical Review concluded by asking to hear from any of its readers who had had similar experiences.\n\nGA Frei of Frei and Co., a Boston manufacturer of X-ray tubes, replied the next day: Mr K, an employee of the company, complained of peculiar itching and burning in his left hand and thought it was due to poisoning with chemicals. Mr K used to regularly attend to testing of tubes during and after the exhausting process at the rooms. The same phenomenon also appeared on Frei's hand. The letter concluded by stating that further developments would be carefully monitored.5\n\nA distressing case was reported in September 1896. William Levy had been shot in the head by an escaping bank robber 10 years previously. The bullet entered his skull just above the left ear and presumably proceeded towards the back of the head. Having heard about X-rays, he decided he wanted the bullet localized and extracted. Levy approached Professor Jones of the Physical Laboratory, University of Minnesota. Professor Jones, who was familiar with Daniel and Dudley's experiments, warned Levy against the exposure, but Levy was undeterred and an exposure was made on 8 July 1896. Exposures were made with the tube over his forehead, in front of his open mouth and behind his right ear. Levy sat through the exposures from 8 o'clock in the morning until 10 o'clock at night. Within 24 h his entire head was blistered, within a few days his head was an angry sore and his lips were badly swollen, cracked and bleeding. His right ear had doubled in size and the hair on his right side had entirely fallen out. Professor Jones concluded that the one feature that was satisfactory to the patient was that a good picture of the bullet was obtained, showing it to be about an inch beneath the skull under the occipital protuberance.6\n\nDr Stickney reported a case in December 1896 of a woman who complained of abdominal pain. A radiograph of the patient, Mrs Q, was taken in the abdominal region. The focus of X-rays was over the liver. 3 exposures were made of 20 min, 30 min and 35 min. Two days later she developed burns over the region. The condition worsened until the surface sloughed.7\n\nThe above cases of Hawks, Dudley and Stickney all reported skin blisters and it could therefore be assumed that the absorbed dose of the victims was at least 1500 rads. Serious damage from the rays was also reported from the Edison Laboratory. Elihu Thomson of General Electric cited two Edison cases in a letter dated 1 December 1896 to Dr EA Codman of Boston. Thomson referred to these cases as serious because they took place over the hands and arms of the victims and they had to stop working with X-rays altogether. The story goes that one of them was told by his physician that if he continued to work with X-rays it would be necessary to amputate his hands. The worker threatened with amputation was probably Clarence Dally, Thomson Edison's glassblower.\n\nClarence Dally was likely to have had an absorbed dose of approximately 3000 rads to necessitate amputation. It needs to be noted that not everyone had the same experience. Dr Williams reported in 1897 that in approximately 250 patients, who he examined with X-rays, he had not seen any harmful effects.8\n\nProfessor Stine of Armour Institute of Technology reported that a patient who was exposed for 2 h for 2 successive days with the plate a few inches from the skin developed itching and irritation. A few days later the skin swelled and became inflamed, and the area immediately surrounding the exposure was tanned and dry. In time the skin peeled off and resembled bad sunburn. Professor Stine, however, concluded that the effect was due to ultraviolet rays and not X-rays.9\n\nDr EA Codman, in 1902, conscientiously reviewed all papers on X-ray injuries. Of the 88 X-ray injuries published, 55 had occurred in 1896, 12 in 1897, 6 in 1898, 9 in 1899, 3 in 1900 and 1 in 1901. The decline could be due to the fact that X-ray injuries were no longer in the news and therefore went unreported unless they exhibited unusual features.10\n\nClarence Dally (1865–1904) is thought to be the first to die as result of X-ray exposure. He died of metastatic carcinoma at only 39 years old.\n\nThe next death to be reported was that of Elizabeth F Ascheim (1859–1905) of San Francisco. Deaths reported thereafter included those of Wolfram C Fuchs (1865–1907), who opened the X-ray laboratory in Chicago in 1896 and made the first X-ray film of a brain tumour in 1899, and Dr William Carl Egelhoff (1872–1907). Among the victims who suffered the most was Dr Walter James Dodd (1869–1916). He was operated on 32 times and died of metastatic carcinoma of the lung on 18 December 1916.11\n\nThe deaths of tube manufacturers have included Rome Vernon Wagner (1869–1908), his brother Thurman Lester Wagner (1876–1912), Burton Eugene Baker (1871–1913), Henry Green (1860–1914), John Bawer (unknown year of birth–1908) and Robert H Machlett (1872–1926).12\n\nThe case of C. Edmund Kells is well known. Kells developed a radiogenic neoplasm in 1922 and endured increasing discomfort and excruciating pain. Kells did not listen to the warning given by William Rollins regarding radiation hazards. He had undergone 42 operations and several amputations (some have reported 100). On 7 May 1928 Kells triggered a 0.32 calibre bullet into his brain.3\n\nDr Perry Brown, an eminent Boston radiologist, published his collection of biological essays “American martyrs to science through Roentgen rays” in 1936. He reported the deaths of Mihran Kasabian of Philadelphia (1870–1910), Eugene Caldwell of New York (1870–1918), Herbert Robert of St Louis (1852–1922), Fredrick H Baetjer of Baltimore (1874–1933) and a number of others whose lives deserve to be remembered. However, his own story was missing; Dr Brown died of X-ray induced cancer in 1950.11\n\nDr Cannon began using X-rays in 1896 when he was a medical student. In 1931 he developed itching of skin and fresh red papular lesions on his back, chest, thighs, knees and elbows. Dr Cannon suggested that repeated biopsies be made so that it would provide more information on this poorly understood condition. He developed several lesions all over the body, many of which continuously recurred.\n\nIn April 1944, a recurrent basal cell carcinoma of the nostril was excised. In 1945 he passed the 14th anniversary of the onset of mycosis fungoidosis — an amazingly long survival. On 1 October 1945 he died of recurrent pulmonary infection.6\n\nIt would be generous to accept Dr Grubbe's account precisely as he wrote it, for he truly was an X-ray martyr. Dr Grubbe suffered at least 83 surgical operations to relieve his discomfort and to stop the progress of gangrene from his left hand to his arm, elbow and finally shoulder. Grubbe's face was grossly disfigured with cancer. He became sterile. His marriage was left childless, a misfortune he attributed to the X-rays. He lived in agony for many years, yet he continued to work with the rays.\n\nIn his autobiography he maintained “my courage is my work. I treat patients who suffer more or are encumbered more than me, and so I go on. By helping others I help myself”. He went on to predict “I will die from the effects of early uncontrolled exposures to X-rays. And like many of the early pioneers, I too, will die a victim of natural science, a martyr to the X-rays.”"
