        "text": "Jim Otto would always talk about the good old days of the NFL, when players like himself would put their bodies on the line and not worry about penalties or the consequences.\n\nActually, there was no one like Otto. He had 29 knee surgeries and over 75 all told as the result of the way the center played the game and became the face of a tough, win-at-all-costs Raiders organization. Otto was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1980, having played for the Raiders his entire career.\n\nOtto, born Jan. 5, 1938, died Sunday at the age of 86, the Raiders announced.\n\n“You would break your hand, spit on it, rub it on your pants and go back out and play some more,” Otto once said.\n\nThe undersized 6-foot-2, 255-pound Otto never missed a game in 15 years and made the Pro Bowl 12 times. He was a 10-time All-Pro and was the center on the all-time AFL team.\n\n“I watched him bleed,” linebacker Phil Villapiano said in a 2022 interview. “I mean, every f—ing game. Whatever helmet he had on certainly didn’t work, because it would come down and smash on top of his nose. He’d be bleeding every single game. And players on the other team would be like, ‘What the f— is with this guy?!’\n\n“I couldn’t believe how much of a beating he took. Jim Otto just out-toughed everybody.”\n\nThe only starting center the Raiders had from 1960 through 1974, Otto would use a muscle relaxant before games so he could bend over and hike the ball. In his autobiography, “The Pain of Glory,” Otto wrote of playing through over 30 concussions and often walking off the field cross-eyed after games.\n\nHis lower right leg had to be amputated in 2007.\n\nOtto equated his career to that of a “gladiator who goes until he can’t go anymore” on the 2013 PBS Frontline special on the NFL’s concussion crisis. One hit by the Green Bay Packers’ Ray Nitschke in 1972 caused him to lose sight in his left eye for six months.\n\n“He broke my helmet,” Otto told the show. “He broke my face mask, which broke my nose and set it over here. Broke my cheekbone, and my zygomatic arch bone here, and detached the retina in my left eye. … It was really bad. It all swelled up, and I couldn’t see, but I kept playing.\n\n“I never went out of the game.”\n\nThe Wausau, Wisc., native played college ball at the University of Miami. The NFL passed on him and the AFL’s Raiders gave him a chance. He put on 20 pounds his rookie year and went on to start in 210 straight regular-season games and lead by example. Oakland won seven divisional championships from 1967 through 1974.\n\n“If I missed a tackle, I would rather come off the field and have John Madden berate me than look into Jim Otto’s eyes,” Villapiano said. “Jim Otto demanded perfection from everybody all the time. That’s what I loved about him so much.”\n\nWhile Raiders owner Al Davis is famed for saying “Just win, baby,” Otto would always say, “You show me a good loser, and I will show you a loser.”\n\nWhen Davis joined the Raiders after previously being an assistant coach with the Chargers, he told Otto how much of a lift it gave the Chargers when Otto left the game with an injury. Otto nodded and made sure it never happened again.\n\nOtto said Davis’ words stuck with him.\n\n“I didn’t want to disappoint him, the fans, my family or my teammates,” Otto said in his autobiography. “I was the captain for 13 years and I guess I was a leader.”\n\nDavis presented Otto at his Hall of Fame induction.\n\n“He was the most honored offense lineman in the history of professional football,” Davis said at his induction. “But statistics are just a measure of accomplishment, not really the measure of a man. If it is true that great men inspire in others the will to be great, that alone qualifies Jim to be a great man. He had courage in spite of his first injuries. His loyalty, devotion and dedication still carry on in Oakland and reached the rewards of victory.”\n\nOtto said he would have played football for a pat on the back, a bottle of Budweiser and a sandwich after the game.\n\n“I think about the injuries and I think about all the things I’ve gone through in my life,” Otto told reporters in 2016. “I’m very happy that I’m here. I’m very happy I did what I did.\n\n“That’s what I wanted to do as a little boy in Wausau. I wanted to be a football player like Elroy ‘Crazylegs’ Hirsch, and that’s what I went out to be.\n\n“There were times right now that I’m sore. It gets you thinking you know, did I do right, did I do wrong? Where did I go wrong? And you know, you say a prayer and it all comes back to me: Jim, you did what you wanted to do.”\n\nOtto hit opponents before they could hit him, and never stayed down when they did get him. Late teammate Gene Upshaw told reporters that Otto would always tell him to just help him up and he would be fine.\n\n“Be the best that you can be,” Otto wrote in his book. “I love the Raiders and cherished my time there. It was my favorite part of life.”\n\nRequired reading\n\nNFL 100: At No. 97, Jim Otto led the Raiders with his sweat, tears and a lot of blood\n\n(Photo: Rich Graessle / PPI / Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)"
