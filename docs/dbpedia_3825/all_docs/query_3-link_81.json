        "text": "Kant&#39;s conception of mathematics as constructible in pure intuition is based on his arguments in the Transcendental Aesthetic on behalf of the intuitive nature of space and time. It is here shown that Kant&#39;s conclusion is completely unfounded, since one can reproduce those arguments on the basis both of the concept of a continuous manifold in Riemann&#39;s sense and of that of an extensive whole in\n\nbe the ambiguity or “Janus-faced ” character of Kant’s notion of “intuition” as developed in the Critique of Pure Reason (Sellars, 1966, p. 2). Appealing first to the formal distinction between intuitions and concepts, he notes that in Kant’s taxonomy it is the generality of concepts “whether sortal or attributive, a priori or empirical ” that distinguishes them from intuitions, since “Kant thinks of intuitions as representations of individuals ” (ibid., p. 3). But this way of drawing the distinction, Sellars notes, opens up the possibility of thinking of intuitions, nevertheless, as types of concepts—that is, as “conceptual representations of individuals rather than conceptual representations of attributes or kinds ” (ibid.). Not all conceptual ways of capturing an individual can be thought of as intuitional: the phrase “the individual which is perfectly round”, for example, doesn’t capture what is for Kant the other defining feature of intuitions, their immediacy (Sellars, 1966, p...\n\nBoth parties in the active philosophical debate concerning the conceptual character of perception trace their roots back to Kant's account of sensible intuition in the Critique of Pure Reason. This striking fact can be attributed to Kant's tendency both to assert and to deny the involvement of our conceptual capacities in sensible intuition. He appears to waver between these two positions in different passages, and can thus seem thoroughly confused on this issue. But this is not, in fact, the case, for, as I will argue, the appearance of contradiction in his account stems from the failure of some commentators to pay sufficient attention to Kant's developmental approach to philosophy. Although he begins by asserting the independence of intuition, Kant proceeds from this nonconceptualist starting point to reveal a deeper connection between intuitions and concepts. On this reading, Kant's seemingly conflicting claims are actually the result of a careful and deliberate strategy for gradually convincing his readers of the conceptual nature of perception.\n\nWith Anil Gomes. Recent debates in the interpretation of Kant's theoretical philosophy have focused on the nature of Kantian intuition and, in particular, on the question of whether intuitions depend for their existence on the existence of their objects. In this paper we show how opposing answers to this question determine different accounts of the nature of Kantian cognition and we suggest that progress can be made on determining the nature of intuition by considering the implications different views have for the nature of cognition."
