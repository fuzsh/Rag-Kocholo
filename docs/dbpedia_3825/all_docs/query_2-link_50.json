        "text": "Previous research on toponymy analyses the roots and meanings of place names. However, the advent of the Critical Toponymy Theory has added a new dimension to the study of toponymy, particularly, focusing on the politics of naming. Theorists have looked at how place naming and renaming is a common strategy used by rulers to achieve legitimacy for their social , political, and national objectives. New governments, who assume power through means such decolonisation or the removal of despotic regimes or being elected, then change the name of existing places to reflect the incoming order. This piece reflects on various examples worldwide and illustrates that toponymic renaming, in some cases known as \"toponymic cleansing\", has been and continues to be used by modern governments. Notwithstanding, the individual socio political experiences of various countries also shape the extent to which toponyms are modified, ultimately showing that place names intersect with politics, society, language, geography, history, landscaping, and culture of a locality.\n\nPrevious research on toponymy analyses the roots and meanings of place names.

This thesis contributes to this field by examining the names, naming, and renaming of former German Democratic Republic (GDR) streets, squares, and parks in East Berlin between 1990 and 2010. Political aspirations to influence Germany&#39;s national memory and identity have been overtly present in the alteration of East Berlin&#39;s memorial landscape. Contrasting narratives in the cityscape emerged as each political party –Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), and the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD)– assumed authority in the process of naming and renaming. While the political parties had overt control in the process, these debates over commemorative names was also taken up by and affected the lives of ordinary citizens. This thesis applies Owen Dwyer and Derek Alderman&#39;s holistic approach to reading Mitte and Prenzl...\n\nAvailable at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3169184 This policy brief discusses the contemporary practice of mass street re-naming as a matter of constitutional debate related to the subsidiarity of government, democratic participation, political pluralism, minority rights, and freedom of speech. It offers general policy recommendations and legal suggestions for best practices to address the aforementioned concerns. The first part provides a brief overview of mass street re-naming as a phenomenon occurring across Europe today. In the second part, it scrutinizes a recent Polish law on street de-communization, which took effect in 2017. The section presents an overview of the mechanisms adopted with the Law, and the rationale behind the legislation. Furthermore, the policy brief discusses controversies, which have arisen from the implementation of the 2017 Polish Law. In the third part, based on the research of the authors in the area of memory laws, the brief offers ten policy recommendations. The fourth part provides of a summary of good practices for mitigating any negative effects of laws requiring a mass re-naming of streets; followed by a conclusion in the final, fifth part.\n\nThe article presents one of the manifestations of the socio-communicative function of urba-nonymy, namely the symbolic role of renaming in the context of foreign policy. The purpose of this article is to establish and describe the signs of foreign policy démarches or similar symbolic acts in renaming (changes in urbanonymy, renominations). To achieve this goal, the author does the lexical-semantic analysis of the concept ‘démarche’ using the induction and deduction methods; the features of démarche were found in certain types of urban renaming of the new period, recorded in the mass media. Finally, with the help of the induction and generalization methods, seven basic criteria for the presence of démarche features in renaming acts are formulated. Materials of the research were presented at the International Scientific- Practical Conference «Language. Society. Journalism» (Kyiv, November 02, 2018). Key words: toponymy, urbanonymy, renaming, demarche"
