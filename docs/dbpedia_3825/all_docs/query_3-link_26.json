        "text": "Hölder’s philosophy of geometry might appear to be the most problematic part of his epistemology. He maintains that geometry depends on experience also after Poincaré’s fundamental criticism of Helmholtz. Nevertheless, I think that Hölder’s view is worth discussing, for two reasons. Firstly, the related methodological considerations were crucial for the development of his epistemology. Secondly, Poincaré uses the opposition between Kantianism and empiricism to argue for his geometrical conventionalism. Nevertheless, Hölder shows that an alternative strategy is not excluded: he profits from Kantian objections in order to develop a consistent empiricism. At the same time, especially in Die mathematische Methode [Hölder 1924], he vindicates the Kantian view that mathematics is synthetic. In this paper, I will consider Hölder’s defence of the deductive method in geometry in Anschauung und Denken in der Geometrie [Hölder 1900] in connection with his approach to the theory of quantity [Hölder 1901]. Moreover, I will discuss his connection with Kant. My suggestion is that Hölder’s methodological considerations enable him to foreshadow a relativized conception of the a priori.\n\nInternational audienceThe question of the applicability of mathematics is an epistemological issue that was explicitly raised by Kant, and which has played different roles in the works of neo-Kantian philosophers, before becoming an essential issue in early analytic philosophy. This paper will first distinguish three main issues that are related to the application of mathematics: (1) indispensability arguments that are aimed at justifying mathematics itself; (2) philosophical justifications of the successful application of mathematics to scientific theories; and (3) discussions on the application of real numbers to the measurement of physical magnitudes. A refinement of this tripartition is suggested and supported by a historical investigation of the differences between Kant&#39;s position on the problem, several neo-Kantian perspectives (Helmholtz and Cassirer in particular, but also Otto Hölder), early analytic philosophy (Frege), and late 19th century mathematicians (Grassmann, D...\n\nThe philosophy of mathematics has been accused of paying insufficient attention to mathematical practice: one way to cope with the problem, the one followed in this paper on extensive magnitudes, is to combine the ‘history of idea’' and the ‘philosophy of models’ in a logical and epistemological perspective. The history of ideas allows the reconstruction of the theory of extensive magnitudes as a theory of ordered algebraic structures; the philosophy of models allows an investigation of the way epistemology might affect relevant mathematical notions. The article takes two historical examples as a starting point for the investigation of the role of numerical models in the construction of a system of non-Archimedean magnitudes. A brief exposition of the theories developed by Giuseppe Veronese and by Rodolfo Bettazzi at the end of the 19th century throws new light on the role played by magnitudes and numbers in the development of the concept of a non-Archimedean order. Different ways of introducing non-Archimedean models are compared and the influence of epistemological models is evaluated. Particular attention is devoted to the comparison between the models that oriented Veronese's and Bettazzi's works and the mathematical theories they developed, but also to the analysis of the way epistemological beliefs affect the concepts of continuity and measurement.\n\nThe question of the applicability of mathematics is an epistemological issue that was explicitly raised by Kant, and which has played different roles in the works of neo-Kantian philosophers, before becoming an essential issue in early analytic philosophy.

Finally, the debate on the cogency of an application constraint in the definition of real numbers is discussed in relation to a contemporary debate in neo-logicism (Hale, Wright and some criticism by Batitksy), in order to suggest a comparison not only\n\nThe question of the applicability of mathematics is an epistemological issue that was explicitly raised by Kant, and which has played different roles in the works of neo-Kantian philosophers, before becoming an essential issue in early analytic philosophy.
