        "text": "Karlsruhe (Baden), January 27, 1940\n\nHaydnplatz 6\n\nDear Mr. Warburg,\n\nI wrote to you on December 10th. If you have not received my letter from that time, I will attach a copy here.\n\nIn the meantime, it has become increasingly likely that we will be asked by the Stuttgart consulate to submit our affidavits this year. We are informing you of this today, especially since the mail is sometimes extremely slow and the validity of your affidavit has expired. To present them to the consulate, we need affidavits that are not older than one year.\n\nWe would be very grateful if you would issue a new confirmation of sponsorship for us at the beginning of April with the necessary accompanying documents – all in duplicate. Please send us one copy each at intervals of one week by airmail. We are choosing early April for their issuance (and ask you not to complete the affidavit beforehand), because it is possible that we will not visit the consulate until early next year.\n\nI am reiterating our information:\n\nDr. Viktor Homburger, born October 2, 1888, in Karlsruhe and residing at Haydnplatz 6.\n\nMarianne H. nee Bredig, born on November 1, 1903, in Heidelberg.\n\nAt the moment in Stuttgart, there are extremely strict requirements for the affidavits and the completion of the accompanying documents. Hence, I would ask you to pay particular attention to this, especially since there are often months-long delays if any information is missing. Given the intensified scrutiny of the consulate, it is rather uncertain if your affidavit, which you kindly completed for us, will meet the requirements. An affidavit is available to us through my brother-in-law’s sponsorship (the brother of my wife), but probably only because it is issued by a close relative. However, it is not a financial reinforcement because my brother-in-law has only been over there for two years. Moreover, he is expecting his and my wife’s elderly father this month, who will immigrate there on a “nonquota visa,” and whom my brother-in-law must completely care for. Therefore, to avoid objections and very time-consuming inquiries when submitting our documents, we would be very grateful if you could possibly obtain another affidavit for us, perhaps with the kind help of your uncle.\n\nWe have asked our father to convey our warmest regards to you but believe that it will take some time for him to recover from the stress and turmoil of his relocation and to adjust to his new environment. Perhaps you have already spoken to my brother-in-law. In any case, I would like to give you his address here (Dr. Max Bredig, c/o Vanadium Corporation of America, Graybar Bldg., 420 Lexington Ave. N.Y.C).\n\nI am extremely sorry that I must trouble you again. However, you will understand that we must organize everything as quickly as possible to facilitate our departure, which has unfortunately become unattainable in the past month."
