        "text": "1945\n\nFoundation\n\nHaving just returned from the war, Otto Johannes Müller founds a small business with a great deal of optimism. Working out of a laundry room, he produces the first brushes and comes up with the MÜHLE logo.\n\n1949\n\nSetback\n\nThe company founder specialises in MÜHLE shaving brushes and acquires its first export customers abroad. A fire destroys the company headquarters, but Otto Johannes Müller soldiers on bravely.\n\n1965\n\nNew generation\n\nAfter the untimely death of his father, Hans-Jürgen Müller takes over the company with 40 employees. MÜHLE now exports its products to 36 countries.\n\n1972\n\nExpropriation\n\nThe great wave of expropriation by the GDR leadership also affects MÜHLE. Under pressure from the state, Hans-Jürgen Müller sells his company, which becomes a “state-owned enterprise”.\n\n1987\n\nFarewell\n\nAs part of VEB Flamingo-Bürsten Schönheide, MÜHLE now produces brushes for the GDR. Hans-Jürgen Müller leaves the company and sets up shop as a freelance brush maker.\n\n1990\n\nNew beginning\n\nWith the fall of the Berlin Wall, Hans-Jürgen Müller takes back ownership of the expropriated family business. From now on, it operates under the name Hans-Jürgen Müller KG, which retains the MÜHLE logo.\n\n1995\n\nMÜHLE’s 50th anniversary\n\nIn the early years after reunification, MÜHLE struggles to survive from day to day. Bit by bit, the company acquires new customers and re-hires former employees.\n\n2006\n\nUpswing\n\nIn the period after the turn of the millennium, the product range is expanded to comprise a high-quality full range for wet shaving. The MÜHLE brand comes to the fore.\n\n2008\n\nThird generation\n\nThe sons Christian and Andreas Müller take over management from their father. Despite the economic crisis, the company turnover grows and the vertical range of manufacture is further increased.\n\n2014\n\nBerlin\n\nThe company is now celebrating shaving culture from the Ore Mountains in the metropolis of Berlin – with the first MÜHLE store complete with barber shop in the Hackesche Höfe.\n\n2017\n\nDesign Award\n\nIn cooperation with the Berlin designer Mark Braun, the product series HEXAGON is created and receives two awards – the Red Dot Award and the German Design Award.\n\n2020\n\nMÜHLE’s 75th anniversary\n\nFrom a small brush manufacturer to a global brand with classic status, MÜHLE celebrates its 75th anniversary and continues to focus on shaving culture made in the Ore Mountains. Fittingly, a treatment space is now also being opened at the MÜHLE Store London.\n\n2021\n\nCOMPANION\n\nMÜHLE is breaking new ground with the COMPANION: our first unisex model with a patented razor head is being launched. Gone are the days when only men reached for the safety razor. Developed for people who are looking for a unisex product that no longer makes any differences - except, of course, in terms of sustainability and zero waste."
