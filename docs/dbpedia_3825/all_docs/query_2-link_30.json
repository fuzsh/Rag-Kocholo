Occupying the vacuum created by the demise of the Unity of Science movement, it was the culminating event, on an international scale, of a long process of reorganization of communities of the philosophy of science and of logic that took place in the fifteen years following World War II—a process that involved many competing interests and personalities.

        "text": "After the Unity of Science Movement\n\n2Emigration, death, politics, and philosophical conflict account for the failure of the Unity of Science movement to maintain its position at the core of the international organization in logic and philosophy of science. The leading igures who were still alive had long since dispersed, mostly to America, as part of the general intellectual and cultural flight from Nazism in Germany and Austria in the 1930s. In the United States, an effort was made to continue the movement through the ifth International Unity of Science Congress at Harvard in 1939 and the sixth, in Chicago, two years later. That meeting, held three months before the United States entered the war against Germany, Italy, and Japan, proved to be the last. Quine's joking characterization of the Harvard congress as “the Vienna Circle in international exile, with some accretions” applied to the Chicago conference, too.\n\n4In addition to the personal losses, the movement in exile in the United States was absorbed in a less programmatic and more diffuse development of the philosophy of science, partly due to critiques of its basic tenets—most trenchantly by Quine—and partly due to new influences. In particular, it had to relate to an American philosophical tradition of empirical philosophy stemming from the pragmatism of Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, and John Dewey that originated in the latter days of the nineteenth century. Though this school of thought also granted empirical science a privileged position in the unfolding of human knowledge, it did not make as sharp a distinction as the logical positivists had done between “meaningful”, directly veriiable statements and “meaningless”, metaphysical statements. Another difference was that the pragmatists did not give the new developments in mathematical logic a central position. The leading postwar representative of the American tradition in the philosophy of science was Dewey's student Ernest Nagel, the John Dewey Professor of Philosophy at Columbia University.\n\nOrganizational Jockeying\n\n8Gonseth's society was included under the philosophical branch of UNESCO, but Gonseth wanted desperately to be allied with the scientific branch; toward this end, in the early 1950s he courted the ASL to join forces in order to take advantage of the logic group's recognized strength and prestige. Tarski's Dutch colleague Evert Beth belonged both to the logic association and to Gonseth's group and was thus a natural go-between. The problem was that he, Tarski, and others in the association were put off by Gonseth's authoritarian way of conducting matters and by his lack of logical rigor. For that reason, Tarski and Beth discouraged the proposed alliance. Gonseth then tried to get his organization into the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) on its own, but—as a result of behind-the-scenes maneuvering by Father Bochenski on behalf of the ASL—that too was quashed. However, the ICSU made a counterproposal: entry would be approved if Gonseth's International Union for the Philosophy of Science would join with the International Union for the History of Science, which was already under its aegis. The historians of science were not at all happy with this proposal; but the decision had already been made higher up, and they were told that they would not continue to receive support from ICSU unless their union joined with the philosophers of science in this way. At the same time, power was wrested from Gonseth as president of his own organization. In 1953 a putsch by Beth and his friends took place: the Dutch logician Arend Heyting was made president; the position of vice-president was taken over by Tarski's friend, the philosopher of physics Jean-Louis Destouches; and Evert Beth assumed the role of secretary.\n\nTarski vs. Gonseth re Methodology\n\n9In 1953, Gonseth gave a lecture at the Colloque International de Logique in Brussels. Tarski attacked him head-on during the discussion period, brutally dismissing his ideas:\n\n7 [Tarski 1986a, Vol. 4, p. 715-716].\n\nI must admit that I do not see, in the exposition of Professor Gonseth, one single problem which could be treated and settled by rational methods. When I hear, for instance, that there is an essential difference between mathematics and the natural sciences, my first tendency is to resist this opinion ... whether it concerns the origin of the disciplines involved, or the methods of inquiry applied in them, or perhaps the methods of organizing and establishing the results obtained; also under what conditions the differences can be called essential. Finally, I arrive at the conclusion that as long as these points are not clarified, no serious discussion of the problem is possible. [emphasis in original]\n\n10In response to another participant in the same discussion, Tarski went on to remark:\n\n8 Ibid.\n\nIt would be more than desirable to have concrete examples of scientific theories (from the realm of the natural sciences) organized into deductive systems. Without such examples there is always the danger that the methodological investigation of these theories will, so to speak, hang in the air. Unfortunately, very few examples are known which would meet the standards of the present-day conception of deductive method and would be ripe for methodological investigations; I can refer, however, to some recent attempts in this direction—to the work of J. H. Woodger in the foundations of biology and of J. C. C. McKinsey and his group in the foundations of physics. The development of metamathe-matics, that is, the methodology of mathematics, would hardly have been possible if various branches of mathematics had not previously been organized into deductive systems.\n\n11In other words, a precondition for the methodological study of the sciences would, in Tarski's view, be their presentation as axiomatic deductive systems, and the paradigm for that was the axiomatization of various parts of mathematics and its study by the methods of metamathematics. All of this was directly opposed to Gonseth's anti-foundational, open view of science.\n\nA Marriage of Convenience\n\n14Following the directive of the International Council of Scientific Unions, in 1955 the international societies of the historians of science and of the philosophers of science joined to create a new entity, the International Union for the History and Philosophy of Science (IUHPS) under the ICSU umbrella. The parties to this marriage of convenience took care to demarcate themselves, respectively, as the Division of History of Science and the Division of Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of Science (DLMPS) within the new union. With the removal of Gonseth, the Association for Symbolic Logic had joined the IUPS the year before and was now represented with significant voting power in the new division for logic and methodology. At the same time, it managed to retain its place under the International Mathematical Union, thus enjoying the best of both worlds.\n\n15Between the years 1955 and 1960, the presidential position of the new DLMPS rotated between Alfred Tarski; Jean Piveteau, a paleontologist from the Sorbonne in Paris; Robert Feys, a Belgian philosopher of logic; and Arnold Schmidt, a German logician. Tarski's friends Jean-Louis Destouches and Evert Beth were appointed secretary and treasurer/ adjoint secretary, respectively. Still, Gonseth was not totally out of the picture; over Tarski's objection, Gonseth's backers saw to it that he was given the title of “Honorary President”. In 1960 the terms of officers were lengthened to four years each, with Stephen Kleene becoming president for 1960-1963, Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz vice-president, Patrick Suppes secretary-general, and the Dutch mathematician Hans Freudenthal treasurer and adjoint secretary, putting Tarski's people firmly in the saddle. To start things off with a big bang, a major congress was proposed for Stanford in 1960.\n\nThe 1960 Congress\n\n16A grand idea in breadth and depth, the congress planned for Stanford in 1960 was almost derailed. Patrick Suppes, secretary-general designate of the division and the leading philosopher of science at Stanford, was the point man. In 1959, late in the planning stages, he told Tarski that he was having difficulty raising funds and was under pressure from the National Research Council and the National Science Foundation to abandon the idea of a separate international congress of the division and instead join the historians of science in their efforts to organize an international congress at a later date in the United States but not necessarily at Stanford.\n\n17Outraged at the proposal, Tarski wrote Suppes:\n\n12 Tarski letter to Patrick Suppes, October 1959; Tarski Archives.\n\nMy reaction to the idea of holding an international congress jointly with the historians of science is decidedly negative . . . A congress for the whole IUHPS [International Union for the History and Philosophy of Science] would be a gathering of people with very few common scientific interests uniting for some administrative, and not scientific, reasons. In particular, logicians would be engulfed in a sea of men who have entirely different approaches in their research and who apply entirely different methods, and I do not see what logicians could gain by participating in such a congress.\n\n18Tarski wanted to stick with the Stanford plans for territorial reasons, too. “The work of our group in the San Francisco Bay Area [will give] a guarantee of a high scientific level for the proposed congress ... [and] if we join the historians of science in their efforts, the common congress will be held somewhere in the East.” (Long gone was Tarski's feeling that the West Coast was intellectually inferior.)\n\n19Tarski prevailed in his opposition to a joint meeting, and the National Science Foundation, along with the American Council Learned Societies, was persuaded at the last minute to help fund the 1960 congress at Stanford. Ironically, in the end, no financial support for this or succeeding meetings of the division was obtained from UNESCO, but its titular support gave the organization the desired international status.\n\n22The list of speakers and disciplines generated palpable excitement; new personal contacts were made and new interdisciplinary sparks generated. These were enhanced by the many dinners and parties that were arranged informally as well as by several group excursions that were organized for the weekend.\n\n“This country is so beautiful”\n\n24After 1960, the LMPS congresses continued to meet every four years, with an occasional exception. They were held in Jerusalem, Amsterdam, Bucharest, London (Ontario), Hanover, Salzburg, Moscow, Uppsala, Florence, and Cracow. In August 2003, the first congress of the twenty-first century took place in Oviedo, Spain. Tarski's stamp on the organization and its meetings is indelible, and even during his lifetime he was gratified with the success of his vision."
