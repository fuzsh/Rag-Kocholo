(1991).\n\nAccording to Gray, the source is James Pierpont's quotation from a footnote into Otto Hölder's Die mathematische Methode, 1924, page 556.\n\nGray translate it as :\n\nPoincaré at the International Mathematical Congress of 1908 in Rome said that one would later look back on set theory [Mengenlehere] as a disease one has overcome.\n\nRegarding Poincaré point of view against Cantorism, see :"
