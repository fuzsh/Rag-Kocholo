OTTO includes basic functions for spectra handling, interactive arithmetic with variables and arrays (formula interpreter), as well as numerous graphic functions. In combination with the general functions more complex dedicated routines (physical routines) are available, e.g. to prepare the measured data or to transform them. There are several program versions including different physical routines. The most important feature of OTTO is a very variable fitting routine (least square fit). A large number of fitting functions is available. Additional functions may be supplied by the user. All operations may be executed also in procedures (command files). The procedure processor is capable of a set of control instructions (jumps, loops, if's). Thus extended procedures may be written in the OTTO command-language. OTTO is written in FORTRAN and was impelemented at VAX computers. (orig.)

Based on the concept of the total decontamination about 1100 ts of contaminated and decontaminated components have been dismantled and removed from board ship. 260 ts of contaminated components packed in 10 ft containers and 400-liter drums and the 480 ts RPV unit are stored at the GKSS site for post investigations. A total mass of about 370 ts has been decontaminated by mechanical and chemical procedures below the required radiological limits. The nuclear status of OTTO HAHN has been removed by the competent licensing authority in June 1982 so that the vessel is now offered for sale for conventionel operations. 8 references, 11 figures\n\nDecline of Hesperia ottoe (Lepidoptera: Hesperiidae in Northern Tallgrass Prairie Preserves\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAnn B.

From humble beginnings, the family became prominent in the world for their contributions to all aspects of society. The son of a German mother and a Jewish (converted father, Otto H. Warburg became a major contributor to medical science in the field of cancer research. Considered for Nobel Prize more than once, he finally received it in 1931 for his discovery of the nature and mode of action of the cellular respiratory enzyme. Warburgâs personality was controversial: he was intolerant of opposing scientific views yet tolerant toward Nazi abuses. Accused of collaboration under the Nazi regime, Otto H. Warburg was nevertheless readmitted to the global scientific community after World War II. His contribution to cancer research remains influential to this day and has been superseded by discoveries that have built upon his work.\n\nPower Peaking Effect of OTTO Fuel Scheme Pebble Bed Reactor\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSetiadipura, T.; Suwoto; Zuhair; Bakhri, S.; Sunaryo, G. R.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nPebble Bed Reactor (PBR) type of Hight Temperature Gas-cooled Reactor (HTGR) is a very interesting nuclear reactor design to fulfill the growing electricity and heat demand with a superior passive safety features. Effort to introduce the PBR design to the market can be strengthen by simplifying its system with the Once-through-then-out (OTTO) cycle PBR in which the pebble fuel only pass the core once. Important challenge in the OTTO fuel scheme is the power peaking effect which limit the maximum nominal power or burnup of the design. Parametric survey is perform in this study to investigate the contribution of different design parameters to power peaking effect of OTTO cycle PBR. PEBBED code is utilized in this study to perform the equilibrium PBR core analysis for different design parameter and fuel scheme. The parameters include its core diameter, height-per-diameter (H/D), power density, and core nominal power. Results of this study show that diameter and H/D effectsare stronger compare to the power density and nominal core power. Results of this study might become an importance guidance for design optimization of OTTO fuel scheme PBR.\n\nOtto von Habsburg : III maailmasÃµda on lÃ¤bi / Otto von Habsburg ; interv.

Otto the Auto is a website offering engaging, interactive activities. We evaluated Otto among a sample of sixty-nine 4- and 5-year-old children, who participated in a randomized parallel group design study. Following baseline evaluation, children engaged with either Otto or a control website for 2 weeks and then were re-evaluated. Children who used Otto failed to show increases in transportation safety knowledge or behavior compared to the control group, although there was a dosage effect whereby children who engaged in the website more with parents gained safer behavior patterns. We conclude Otto may have some efficacy when engaged by children with their parents, but continued efforts to develop and refine engaging, effective, theory-driven strategies to teach children transportation safety, including via internet, should be pursued.\n\nNS OTTO HAHN - the first German nuclear ship\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\n1981-01-01\n\nThe NS OTTO HAHN is the first and only European nuclear propelled cargo and research vessel. She entered service in 1968 and was operated for 11 years without any technical failure. The essential experience and know-how about the nuclear propulsion unit is available now. Therefore the ship was decommissioned in 1979. Until the end of 1981 all activated and contaminated components will be removed and decontaminated. The ship can then be released for conventional utilization. In this book the NS OTTO HAHN is described in detail and the experiences of operation as well as research and development activities are reported.

The internal irreversibility of the cycle is included in the factors of internal irreversibility degree. The quantum degeneracy effect on the performance of the cycle is investigated based on quantum statistical mechanics and thermodynamics. Variations of the maximum work output ratio R W and the efficiency ratio y with temperature ratio Ï are examined, which reveal the influence of the quantum degeneracy of the working substance on the performance of a Bose Otto cycle. It is shown that the results obtained herein are valid under both classical and quantum ideal gas conditions\n\nPreliminary thermodynamic study of regenerative Otto based cycles with zero NOx emissions operating with adiabatic and polytropic expansion\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGarcia, Ramon Ferreiro; Carril, Jose Carbia; Romero Gomez, Javier; Romero Gomez, Manuel\n\n2016-01-01\n\nHighlights: â¢ Efficient polytropic expansion based Otto cycle. â¢ Thermal efficiency is due to the inherent regeneration. â¢ Low temperature combustion with zero NOx emissions. - Abstract: The aim of the paper is to demonstrate that a regenerative Otto cycle with adiabatic or polytropic expansion can achieve improved performance over traditional Otto engines, even exceeding the Carnot factor. Thus, the work deals with a novel regenerative Otto based internal combustion engine which differs from the conventional Otto thermal cycles in that the process of heat conversion into mechanical work is performed obeying a polytropic path function instead of the conventional adiabatic expansion without regeneration. Design characteristics concern the fact that combustion at constant volume is carried out undergoing large air excess so that the top combustion temperature is significantly lower than in conventional Otto cycles and consequently NOx emissions are neglected. Furthermore, during the polytropic expansion based path function, heat is absorbed by being submitted to a controlled heat flow rate, to achieve the desired polytropic expansion. The analysis of the regenerative Otto based on polytropic expansion is presented and results are compared with a regenerative Otto based on the adiabatic expansion and CF. The results show that a relevant advantage of the proposed regenerative Otto with polytropic expansion over the regenerative Otto cycle with adiabatic expansion involves performance enhancement within a wide range of combustion pressures, temperatures and regeneration capacities. Thus, thermal efficiency and specific work as function of the top combustion pressure ranges are of 71.95â58.43% and 143.5â173.6 kJ/kg respectively, when combustion pressures vary between 105 kPa and 200 kPa and CF is 60.8% (lower than the thermal efficiency).

The general expressions of the work output and efficiency of the cycle are calculated based on the finite system thermodynamic theory, in which the quantum boundary effect of gas particles as working substance and the mechanical Casimir effect of gas system are considered. It is found that, for a micro-/nanoscaled Otto cycle devices, the work output W and efficiency Î· of the cycle can be expressed as the functions of the temperature ratio Ï of the two heat reservoirs, the volume ratio r V and the surface area ratio r A of the two isochoric processes, the dimensionless thermal wavelength Î» and other parameters of cycle, while for a macroscaled Otto cycle devices, the work output W 0 and efficiency Î· 0 of the cycle are independent of the surface area ratio r A and the dimensionless thermal wavelength Î». Further, the influence of boundary of cycle on the performance characteristics of the micro-/nanoscaled Otto cycle are analyzed in detail by introducing the output ratio W/W 0 and efficiency ratio Î·/Î· 0 . The results present the general performance characteristics of a micro-/nanoscaled Otto cycle and may serve as the basis for the design of a realistic Otto cycle device in micro-/nanoscale.\n\nPreliminary neutronic design of high burnup OTTO cycle pebble bed reactor\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSetiadipura, T.; Zuhair; Irwanto, D.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe pebble bed type High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactor (HTGR) is among the interesting nuclear reactor designs in terms of safety and flexibility for co-generation applications.

One of the important challenges of the OTTO cycle PBR design, and nuclear reactor design in general, is improving the nuclear fuel utilization which is shown by attaining a higher burnup value. This study performed a preliminary neutronic design study of a 200 MWt OTTO cycle PBR with high burnup while fulfilling the safety criteria of the PBR design.The safety criteria of the design was represented by the per-fuel-pebble maximum power generation of 4.5 kW/pebble. The maximum burnup value was also limited by the tested maximum burnup value which maintained the integrity of the pebble fuel. Parametric surveys were performed to obtain the optimized parameters used in this study, which are the fuel enrichment, per-pebble heavy metal (HM) loading, and the average axial speed of the fuel. An optimum design with burnup value of 131.1 MWd/Kg-HM was achieved in this study which is much higher compare to the burnup of the reference design HTR-MODUL and a previously proposed OTTO-cycle PBR design.

Considering the aim of syntactic-stylistic analysis in this paper, the examples were divided according to their syntactic functions identifying and interpreting syntactic structures that change word order, and simultaneously point out stylistic marking of the parcellated structure. The most frequent structures are the ones with parcellated positions of adjuncts. Adverbs and constructions with prepositions and case are comparably found in these syntactic positions. Moreover, the most frequent are adjuncts for the parcellation of syntactic position, then intonational and positional emphasis of apposition, and finally the parcellation of elements such as object, subject and an attributive. In conclusion, this procedure of making syntactic units independent, their frequency and superiority to the other stylistic procedures, contribute to the style of this novel, and point out parcellation as a dominant stylistic characteristic of this novel.\n\nLiivimaa orientalisti Otto Friedrich Richteri Ãµpiaastad / Indrek JÃ¼rjo\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nJÃ¼rjo, Indrek, 1956-2009\n\n2006-01-01\n\nRichteri koduÃµpetajaks oli kuulus Venemaa ajaloolane ja Tartu Ã¼likooli kauaaegne rektor Gustav Ewers.

(GL)\n\nOtto Hahn achievement and responsibility\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nHoffmann, Klaus\n\n2001-01-01\n\nOtto Hahn (1879-1968) was awarded the 1944 Nobel Prize for Chemistry for his work on atomic fission: his work in Berlin in the 1930s and 1940s with Lise Meitner and Fritz Strassmann led to the discovery that uranium nuclei bombarded by neutrons undergo spontaneous fission, releasing enormous energies. This work, conveyed to England and the US by scientific refugees from Nazi Germany, led to the instigation of the Manhattan Project and the development of the Atomic Bomb. Reviled by many after the war as one of the people responsible for the carnage at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Hahn had already begun to reflect on the social responsibility of scientists for their fundamental discoveries and the subsequent applications of the knowledge they create. Already during the war, Hahn had protested Nazi restrictions on Universities and researchers, and after the War, he became actively involved in efforts to restrict the spread of nuclear weapons.

His cosmology was embedded in theology and can be interpreted as a refutation of Descartes' worldview. He used Nicolaus Cusanus' theory of quantities in order to characterize space. The notion of space has to be distinguished from that of world or heaven. Forces play a crucial role in this respect described by Athanasius Kircher in his \"Celestial Journey\". Guericke read this work very diligently. In spite of some obvious similarities between Guericke's and Newton's scientific aims and methods there are crucial differences between the scientific convictions and results of these scholars.\n\nThe 50th anniversary of the N.S.

The purpose for this work has been to do measurements of the flow in the cylinder but also measurements of the cylinder pressure have been performed. The flow measurements are made with the method Laser Doppler Velocimetry, LDV. The reason why these measurements are made at all are the pump losses that implies a lower efficiency for the Otto engine at part load. In this work two alternative ways that highly reduces the pump losses are examined. These are early inlet valve closing and late inlet valve closing. To further increase the efficiency at part load an increased compression ratio has been used together with the different valve strategies. With these two ways of operation, at a part load of about 4 - 5 IMEP{sub net}, increases of about 20% of the net indicated efficiency has been obtained. Additionally this report contains a chapter about the possible use of a variable valve actuation or timing system, VVA or VVT. Many conditions for the Otto cycle can be improved by the use of a variable valve actuation and in this chapter it is dealt with the most important ones.\n\nPerformance of a cycle Otto engine using biogas; Desempenho de um motor ciclo Otto utilizando biogas como combustivel\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nSouza, Juliano de [Universidade Estadual do Oeste do Parana (UNIOESTE), Cascavel, PR (Brazil).

The prerequisite for a modular reactor unit of maximum power output, subject to observing passive safety characteristics is a sufficiently flat axial neutron flux profile. This is achieved by introducing B 4 C coated particles of pre-calculated size and packing density within the fuel spheres. In accordance with AVR operating practise the temperature profile is radially equalised by introducing a 2-zone core loading. Adding pure graphite spheres loosely into the centre column area of the core effectively reduced the maximum power in the middle. Increasing the reactor diameter is enabled by the introduction of noses. A 3-D geometric modeller developed in cylindrical co-ordinates enables a given flow description of the pebbles adjacent to the nose boundaries and in the vicinity of the shut down/control rods. After translation of the geometric data the neutronic behaviour of the reactor is followed in 3-D by the CITATION code. This study is aimed towards achieving an optimal core layout with a LEU (Low Enriched Uranium) fuel cycle. Physical properties of the OTTO-PAP, 150 MWt reference design is reported, while computations performed observe results obtained by the reference HTR-MODUL design.

POME is mainly discharged from the sterilization unit of palm oil processing into crude palm oil. This study utilized biogas produced from liquid waste palm oil for use as fuel in the Otto engine generator 4 - stroke, type STARKE GFH1900LX with a peak power of 1.3 kW, 1.0 kW average power, bore 55 mm, stroke 40 mm, Vd 95 Ã 10-6 m3, Vc 10 Ã 10-6 m3, compression ratio of 10.5 : 1, and the number of cylinders = 1. The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of Otto engine generator fueled with biogas that generated from POME, then comparing its performance fueled by gasoline. The performance included power, torque, specific fuel consumption, thermal efficiency, and the air-fuel ratio. Experiment was conducted by using a variation of the lamp load of 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 W. The results revealed that the use of biogas as fuel decreased in power, torque, brake thermal efficiency, and air fuel ratio (AFR), while there is an increasing of value specific fuel consumption (SFC).\n\nNew technology on Otto engines for reducing the exhaust emission toxicity\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMikarovska, Vesna; Stojanovski, Vasko\n\n2003-01-01\n\nThe exhaust emission from the Otto engines with internal combustion contains a lot of toxicant components for human being as well as for the surrounding. There are a lot of possibilities to realize the engine work with minimum emission of toxicant components. However, all solutions could not be racial, especially if the engine should work with minimum fuel consumption. The engineers look for the solutions where the reducing of the exhaust emission toxicity could be done with the total fuel utilization in the engine's cylinder, without additionally combustion in catalytic or thermal reactors. The paper describes the new technologies for detail investigation of the combustion processes and optimization of all influence parameters on exhaust gases emission.

The results obtained show a increase in the volumetric efficiency of the engine with natural gas direct injection when compared with natural gas injection applied in the inlet manifold, upstream of the throttle butterfly. In the conversion to natural gas direct injection, the technical characteristics were not changed. A kit for natural gas direct injection, with electronic management was located on the cylinder head of the test engine. Maintaining the pressure constant in the natural gas fuel line, using a reduction valve, the mass of fuel injected into the cylinder was regulated, varying the opening time of the solenoid valve fuel injector. Engine performance data is compared, emphasizing the factors that contribute to this increase in relative volumetric efficiency. Modifications are made to maximize the power of the engine with natural gas direct injection.

Our work demonstrates that the threshold of optical bistability can be markedly reduced (three orders of magnitude) by covering the nonlinear substrate with multilayer graphene sheets, due to strong local field enhancement with the excitation of surface plasmons. We present the influences of the Fermi energy of graphene, the incident angle, the thickness of air gap and the relaxation time of graphene on the hysteresis phenomenon and give a way to optimize the surface plasmon resonance, which will enable us to further lower the minimal power requirements for realizing optical bistability due to the strong interaction of light with graphene sheets. These results are promising for realization of terahertz optical switches, optical modulators and logical devices.

L.; Guo, D. Y.; Wu, S. L.; Yi, X. X.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nA quantum Otto heat engine is studied with multilevel identical particles trapped in one-dimensional box potential as working substance. The symmetrical wave function for Bosons and the anti-symmetrical wave function for Fermions are considered. In two-particle case, we focus on the ratios of W^i (i=B,F) to W_s, where W^B and W^F are the work done by two Bosons and Fermions, respectively, and W_s is the work output of a single particle under the same conditions. Due to the symmetrical of the wave functions, the ratios are not equal to 2. Three different regimes, low-temperature regime, high-temperature regime, and intermediate-temperature regime, are analyzed, and the effects of energy level number and the differences between the two baths are calculated. In the multiparticle case, we calculate the ratios of W^i_M/M to W_s, where W^i_M/M can be seen as the average work done by a single particle in multiparticle heat engine. For other working substances whose energy spectrum has the form of E_nË n^2, the results are similar. For the case E_nË n, two different conclusions are obtained.\n\nExperiences during the exchange of fuel elements of the NS OTTO HAHN\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nScharge, J.; Manthey, H.J.; Schafstall, H.G.\n\n1977-01-01\n\nIn the fall of 1972, the nuclear ship OTTO HAHN was taken out of service in order to exchange the fuel elements and to take care of necessary modifications. Up to this time, she travelled a total distance of 241 588 nautical miles on 79 trips. The reactor plant was in service for approximately 25 230 h. The fuel elements reached a burn-up of 570 days. The guaranteed burn-up was exceeded by 14%. At sea the reactor was available 99.7% during operation. Operational data proved the design of the reactor plant to be very conservative. The fuel elements were never damaged. This successful operation of the FDR-reactor and its first core demonstrated that a reactor of this type is suitable for shipboard use. (orig.)

These are conceptually linked by the fundamental importance of person-environment mergence and separation. Rank's theory of emotions highlights anxiety as the affect of separation, and guilt as the feeling that binds the individual to others. His personality theory distinguishes between the partialist, who responds to life fear with identification, and the totalist, who responds to death fear with projection. His cultural psychology contrasts primal collectivism with contemporary individualism, which orients the person toward individual immortality striving. Individualism has produced problematic self-consciousness and neuroticism, in the face of which Rank struggled to find a new psychology.\n\nPreliminary neutronic study on Pu-based OTTO cycle pebble bed reactor\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nSetiadipura, Topan; Zuhair [National Nuclear Energy Agency of Indonesia (BATAN), Selatan (Indonesia).

An optimized design of simple PBR might give a symbiotic solution of providing a safe energy source, effective fuel utilization shown by a higher burnup value, and incineration of Pu stockpiles. This study perform a preliminary neutronic design study of a 200 MWt Once Through Then Out (OTTO) cycle PBR with Pu-based fuel. The safety criteria of the design were represented by the per-fuel-pebble maximum power generation of 4.5 kW/pebble. In this preliminary phase, the parametric survey is limited to the heavy metal (HM) loading per pebble and the average axial speed of the fuel. An optimum high burnup of 419.7 MWd/kg-HM was achieved in this study. This optimum design uses a HM loading of 2.5 g/pebble with average axial fuel velocity 0.5 cm/day.\n\nOtto Rank, the Rankian circle in Philadelphia, and the origins of Carl Rogers' person-centered psychotherapy.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\ndeCarvalho, R J\n\n1999-05-01\n\nOtto Rank's will therapy helped shape the ideas and techniques of relationship therapy developed by the Philadelphia social workers Jessie Taft, Virginia Robinson, and Frederick Allen in the 1930s. Rank's work and these ideas and techniques in turn strongly influenced the formulation of Carl Rogers' person-centered psychotherapy. This article compares and contrasts will, relationship, and person-centered approaches to psychotherapy and discusses the social factors--primarily the professional conflicts between a male-dominated psychiatry and female social workers over the independent practice of psychotherapy--that were crucial in the dissemination of Rank's psychological thought and the early popularity of Rogers.\n\nEffects of heat loss as percentage of fuel's energy, friction and variable specific heats of working fluid on performance of air standard Otto cycle\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLin, J.-C.; Hou, S.-S.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThe objective of this study is to analyze the effects of heat loss characterized by a percentage of the fuel's energy, friction and variable specific heats of working fluid on the performance of an air standard Otto cycle with a restriction of maximum cycle temperature. A more realistic and precise relationship between the fuel's chemical energy and the heat leakage that is based on a pair of inequalities is derived through the resulting temperature. The variations in power output and thermal efficiency with compression ratio, and the relations between the power output and the thermal efficiency of the cycle are presented. The results show that the power output as well as the efficiency where maximum power output occurs will increase with increase of the maximum cycle temperature. The temperature dependent specific heats of the working fluid have a significant influence on the performance. The power output and the working range of the cycle increase with the increase of specific heats of the working fluid, while the efficiency decreases with the increase of specific heats of the working fluid. The friction loss has a negative effect on the performance. Therefore, the power output and efficiency of the cycle decrease with increasing friction loss. It is noteworthy that the effects of heat loss characterized by a percentage of the fuel's energy, friction and variable specific heats of the working fluid on the performance of an Otto cycle engine are significant and should be considered in practical cycle analysis. The results obtained in the present study are of importance to provide good guidance for performance evaluation and improvement of practical Otto engines\n\nGeological and environmental observations in the Sunchales Creek and Tonco River , Don Otto uranium mine, Salta Province\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGorustovich, S.; Guidi, F.; BÃ¡rbaro, N.; Nievas, H.; Tomellini, G.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nResults of geological and environmental observations made by professionals of the ComisiÃ³n Nacional de EnergÃ­a AtÃ³mica (CNEA) down streams Don Otto uranium mine on the Sunchales creek, from Los Guanacos strait down to the Tonco river mouth, and from river mouth down to narrow pass named Salto Grande, are presented in this report. La Yesera, Las Curtiembres and Los Blanquitos Formations of the Pirgua Subgroup, and Lecho and Yacoraite Formations of the Balbuena Subgroup crops out in that area (Salta Group, Cretaceous- Middle Eocene). Water stream analyses have given uranium contents between 890 Î¼g/L and 1,100 Î¼g/L, and uranium in stream sediments between 4 Î¼g/g and 14 Î¼g/g; radimetric anomalias up to 1,500 c/s in discoloured facies of the Las Curtiembres Formation, and 2,000 c/s in dark pelitic sediments of the Yacoraite Formation. A new zone with uranium traces in Curtiembres Formation belonging to the Pirgua Subgroup has been identified in the AlemanÃ­a cretaceous basin, which is stratigraphically similar to Cajoncillo, Las Abritas and El Fraile deposits. Those traces in addition to the other ones localized in the upper third of the Yacoraite Formation would have been originated by the geochemical uranium anomalies in waters and stream sediments by uranium leaching of rocks. The geochemical uranium anomalies in water and sediments are not a consequence of the antropic activity of the uranium mining carried out in Don Otto mine (1961-1982).

The paper presents the spectrum of diagnostic methods differing in terms of the level of structuralizing and the form in which they are applied. The first one constructed, the Structural Interview, due to the high requirements within psychoanalytical knowledge and clinical abilities for the individuals who apply it, initiated the development of subsequent methods. They include: the Structured Interview of Personality Organization (STIPO, inventory methods, and a clinician-rated instrument referred to as the Personality Organization Diagnostic Form (PODF. Within the scope of inventory methods, two principal tools for which Polish adaptations have been developed are presented, namely: the Inventory of Personality Organization of Kernberg and collaborators, and the Borderline Personality Inventory of Leichsenring. The existence of a broad spectrum of assessment methods of the personality structure makes it possible to take advantage of the conception of Kernberg in the realms of clinical diagnosis, scientific research, and recently also forensic psychology.\n\nAngle-dependent quantum Otto heat engine based on coherent dipole-dipole coupling\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSu, Shan-He; Luo, Xiao-Qing; Chen, Jin-Can; Sun, Chang-Pu\n\n2016-08-01\n\nElectromagnetic interactions between molecules or within a molecule have been widely observed in biological systems and exhibit broad application for molecular structural studies. Quantum delocalization of molecular dipole moments has inspired researchers to explore new avenues to utilize this physical effect for energy harvesting devices. Herein, we propose a simple model of the angle-dependent quantum Otto heat engine which seeks to facilitate the conversion of heat to work. Unlike previous studies, the adiabatic processes are accomplished by varying only the directions of the magnetic field. We show that the heat engine continues to generate power when the angle relative to the vector r joining the centres of coupled dipoles departs from the magic angle Î¸m where the static coupling vanishes. A significant improvement in the device performance has to be attributed to the presence of the quantum delocalized levels associated with the coherent dipole-dipole coupling. These results obtained may provide a promising model for the biomimetic design and fabrication of quantum energy generators.\n\nÃloha aÂ vÃ½znam Otto von Bismarcka vÂ mezinÃ¡rodnÃ­ch vztazÃ­ch\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nBucifalovÃ¡, KarolÃ­na\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIn this bachelors thesis is analyzed aÂ personality of Otto von Bismarck and his role and importance in international relations.

The major purpose of this study was to examine whether there were the same kind of throttle losses in this engine as in a Diesel engine (Volvo TD 100). One reason for throttling is that HCCI causes very cold exhaust gases. The Diesel engine has a larger cylinder volume (1.6 compared to 0.5 litre), working at low engine speed (1000 rpm) and only two valves with comparably small area. The smaller Volvo 850 engine has four valves and was in this examination working at up to 3500 rpm. To make the engine run by HCCI following modifications were made. The compression was set to 20:1 by changing the piston. To affect the ignition an electrical heater was installed near the air inlet. Mixing iso-octane (ON 100) and N-heptane (ON 0) set the octane number. A couple of camshafts with different cam-profiles were used to achieve the right valve opening duration depending on which kind of combustion that was studied. There could then also be a comparison between Otto and HCCI combustion both working with wide-open throttle. To obtain comparable indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) the engine was working with late (LIVC) or early inlet valve closing (EIVC) at SI combustion. Measurements were taken involving in-cylinder pressure, temperature, speed, fuel-consumption, emissions etc. Regarding emissions there were special consideration taken to hydrocarbon and NO{sub x}, which are known to be extremely high respectively low with HCCI combustion. Important questions that should be answered were: * How does higher engine speed affect the combustion ?, * How does the engine size affect emissions ?, * How much is the valve area affecting gas exchange losses ?, and * How high is the efficiency with HCCI compared with Otto (LIVC/EIVC) ?.

The existence of the \"Frank-Starling law\" testifies to this. Two of his seminal publications have been translated into English previously, introducing Frank's research on the dynamics of the heart and the arterial pulse to a wider audience. It is likely that there are a host of other comparable achievements and publications of Frank that are still unknown to the international scientific (cardiological and physiological) community. However, their influence can still be felt and seen in modern cardiology and cardio-physiology, such as in the development of modern interactive simulating and teaching programs. We have translated and commented on ten of these papers, which can be read in parallel with the German originals. These publications show a wealth of theoretical assumptions and projections regarding the importance of the sarcomere, the development of models of contraction, thermo-dynamical considerations for muscular activity, differences between cardiac and skeletal muscles, problems related to methodology and measurement, and the first pressure-volume diagram (published 120â¯years ago). These topics were envisioned by Frank long before they became a focus of subsequent modern research. Nowadays, frequent measurements of pressure-volume relationships are made in research using the pressure-volume conductance catheter technique. In commenting Frank's scientific topics, we try to show how interconnected his thinking was, and thus how it enabled him to cover such a wide range of subjects. Copyright Â© 2018 The Authors.

After analyzing the letters that the Professor exchanged with his closest collaborators and reviewing the works he published during this period, it is clear that anxiety was a crucial element among the topics in dispute. His reflections linked to the signal anxiety concept allowed Freud to refute Rank's thesis that defined birth trauma as the paradigmatic key to understanding neurosis, and, in turn, was a way of confirming the validity of the concepts of Oedipus complex, repression and castration in the conceptualization of anxiety. The reasons for the modifications of anxiety theory in the mid-1920s cannot be reduced, as Freud would affirm officially in his work of 1926, to the detection of internal contradictions in his theory or to the desire to establish a metapsychological version of the problem, for they gain their essential impulse from the debate with Rank.

Algunos artistas sintieron especialmente la repercusiÃ³n moral y la convulsiÃ³n causadas por la guerra mecanizada en la que un nÃºmero cada vez mayor de soldados morÃ­an en el frente, a la vez que se producÃ­an masacres en zonas de la retaguardia. El pintor expresionista alemÃ¡n Otto Dix recogiÃ³ en sus dibujos, hechos en primera lÃ­nea de combate, la dureza de los enfrentamientos y de la vida de los combatientes en las trincheras del frente occidental y reflejÃ³ en grabados y pinturas posteriores a la Gran Guerra las penalidades y los horrores sufridas por aquellos. Sus obras son, ademÃ¡s de testimonios de las atrocidades de los combates, condena y denuncia de todas las guerras. En el aÃ±o 1937 el espaÃ±ol Pablo Picasso pintÃ³ el mural Guernica, cuyo tÃ­tulo alude al bombardeo de la localidad vasca del mismo nombre, ocurrido poco tiempo antes de que su autor lo comenzase. Ya desde su creaciÃ³n, el cuadro se convirtiÃ³ en una de las obras artÃ­sticas principales del pasado siglo y en icono de la lucha por la paz. Ambos artistas emplearon lenguajes vanguardistas para crear formas nuevas, alejadas de las maneras tradicionales de representar la guerra en la cultura occidental. Dix se sirviÃ³ del expresionismo para mostrar en sus composiciones escenas verosÃ­miles de una dureza difÃ­cil de soportar para quienes las contemplan. Picasso se apoyÃ³ sobre todo en el cubismo y el surrealismo para aludir a los efectos de la guerra moderna sobre la poblaciÃ³n indefensa.Countries involved in The Great War experienced dramatic changes in every aspect of their day to day life. Some artists were especially sensitive towards the moral convulsion caused by a mechanized war where an"
