        "text": "During one of the first performances on the 2016 GRAMMY Awards, country artists Sam Hunt and Carrie Underwood sang Hunt’s hit, “Take Your Time.” As I was passively listening, I started to think to myself, ‘Wait a minute, why do I know these lyrics?’ Then it hit me, ‘That’s Adrian Marcel’s song!’ I thought Hunt was covering Marcel’s original song and I started to get upset; but after a quick google search, I found out that the song indeed belonged to Sam Hunt. I calmed down then LOL but I had been totally oblivious to the fact that Marcel’s cover was even a cover because I don’t follow country music like I used to. Realizing that this country song was covered by an R&B artist made me wonder how often that’s done today.\n\nRhapsody.com touched on this very topic when explaining their playlist, “R&B Covers Country.” The website called the practice of R&B acts covering country songs “a phenomenon that used to happen all the time through the mid-’70s or so, but for some reason has grown rarer and rarer ever since…Where singers like Al Green, Solomon Burke, Bobby Womack and Millie Jackson once upon a time regularly included country standards in their repertoires (sometimes recording entire albums of them, such as Womack’s 1976 BW Does C&W), it might be impossible to find even isolated equivalents in catalogs of, say, R. Kelly or Brian McKnight or Jill Scott.”\n\nThat’s an interesting point. The majority of the time, we hear R&B artists cover classic R&B which is great i.e., R. Kelly has covered Sam Cooke’s catalog during some of his live shows and does justice to the legend’s music. Now could the “Pied-Piper of R&B” sound just as good covering some country music? Absolutely! True, none of today’s R&B artists need to cover a country song with some soul flavor for higher career achievement or just for the heck of it, but we know they could definitely be successful if they chose to go that route. Rhapsody.com added, “Whitney Houston’s take on Dolly Parton’s “I Will Always Love You” obviously went stratospheric in 1992, and two years later All-4-One had almost as much luck with John Michael Montgomery’s “I Swear.”\n\nInitially, it might sound a little weird to hear an R&B artist do a cover (or an “interpretation”, as Will Downing would say) of a country song, but country songs are known for telling great stories and R&B vocalists have a special way of expressing their pleasure and pain that tug at the heartstrings. That link makes the genres more like brother and sister as opposed to distant cousins. As a matter of fact, during the recording of the 1994 album, “Rhythm, Country and Blues” – which featured duets with R&B and country artists – country legend Reba McEntire made this comment :“I’ve always said that if you can get the emotion, the deep-down gutsy feeling of R&B, and the very relatable lyrics from country, you’ve got a monster song.” I couldn’t agree more! There was a time in my childhood when I primarily listened to country music and thus gained an affinity for artists such as Trisha Yearwood, Shania Twain, The Rascal Flatts, and Blake Shelton. I still have several favorites from that period and a few from nowadays, and it would be awesome to hear some of those great stories covered in an R&B style by the likes of Mary J. Blige, Monica, Mint Condition and Anthony Hamilton, just to name a few.\n\n“I’ve always said that if you can get the emotion, the deep-down gutsy feeling of R&B, and the very relatable lyrics from country, you’ve got a monster song.” – Reba McEntire\n\nIn my tiny estimation, doing an “interpretation” of a song in another genre is equivalent to singing a song in a person’s mother tongue, in a style that will touch the heart of the listener. So the average R&B fan who may have never listened to Dolly Parton is guaranteed to love at least one of her songs – “I Will Always Love You” – because of how Whitney Houston interpreted it. And the average R&B fan who may have never listened to John Michael Montgomery probably likes at least two of his songs – “I Swear” and “I Can Love You Like That” – because of how All-4-One interpreted them. Though the lyrics of the aforementioned songs didn’t change when interpreted in the R&B “language”, the production and style of singing underwent a “soul treatment”, thus resonating more with an urban audience.\n\nWhile obviously still a rarity, here’s a list of a few examples within recent years of R&B acts covering country songs, which predate Adrian Marcel’s take on Sam Hunt’s “Take Your Time.” See how many you’ve heard of –>\n\nOn her 2004 debut album, “Free Yourself,” Fantasia interprets “You Were Always On My Mind”, a song that was originally recorded by Gwen McCrae and Brenda Lee but popularized by Willie Nelson in 1982.\n\nJoe interprets “Before He Cheats” by Carrie Underwood, singing it from the male perspective and calling it “Before I Cheat.” Rather than for an album, Joe covers this song for Yahoo! Music’s series, “Cover Art”, circa 2006.\n\nGladys Knight did her own rendition of Lee Ann Womack’s “I Hope You Dance” for the 2008 Tyler Perry movie, “The Family That Preys.”\n\nBoyz II Men interpret “Amazed” by Lonestar for their 2009 cover album, “Love.” According to one report, Shawn Stockman said that B2M was offered the song first but turned it down.\n\nTamia interprets “Is It Over Yet” by Wynonna Judd on her 2012 album, “Beautiful Surprise.” (Interestingly, Tamia loves country music and she covered her own song, “Still”, in a country style for the same album. It’s a really neat track!)\n\n2016 Honorable Mention: Rapper Nelly – who has collaborated with country artists Tim McGraw and Florida Georgia Line during his career – released a cover of Thomas Rhett’s “Die a Happy Man” in February 2016.\n\n2017 addition: KeKe Wyatt, a powerhouse vocalist and die-hard lover of country music, puts her smooth spin on Chris Stapleton’s cover of “Tennessee Whiskey” for her 2017 album, “Keke Covers.” This is on constant rotation in my house. 🙂\n\n—\n\nSo, what do you think of those “interpretations”? Clearly, R&B vocalists today have no problem making a country song their own and sounding good while doing it, just as their musical predecessors did back in the day. It may not be done as often now as it was then, but I’m all for hearing more of it. What say you?\n\nThere’s nothing as classy and cool as a group of soul men who can dance as well as they can sing; no I’m not talking about displaying the acrobatic talent of a Chris Brown or the MJ-esque moves of Ne-Yo, but the choreography presented by a vocal group that’s marked by precision and poise. Choreography that corresponds to the narrator’s lyrics brings the story to life, adding splashes of color to the canvas that is the stage. (You can sense that I love dancing, right?)\n\nThat said, it’s not that entertaining or show-stopping when a group of singing men blend their voices without any accompanying steps, unless, of course, the song can stand alone with a dramatic/reflective plot or melody i.e. Four Tops’ “I Believe in You and Me”, The Temptations’ “Just My Imagination” and Boyz II Men’s “Mama.” In my opinion, just enough appropriate, well-chosen moves and grooves can make a performance more interesting and keep the audience’s attention throughout the showcase. (Long gone are the days when black artists who formed doo-wop groups didn’t put much emphasis on moving their feet, but focused more on harmonizing their vocal “oohs” and “ahhs.”)\n\nNow, when it comes to fine-tuned choreography amongst soul groups, The Temptations are viewed as the cream of the crop; I have no desire to dispute this assertion because, in their heyday (especially with the “classic five” lineup), Motown’s quintessential male vocal group were bad to the bone. No matter who was leading a particular song, it was guaranteed that the other four members would not only harmonize but slide, step, spin and snap in unison, making for one dynamite showcase of entertainment.\n\nI mean, they had their own “Temptations Walk” that they sprinkled in every so often during a set and, whenever they concluded a performance, they didn’t simply bow to salute the crowd. Instead, each gentleman clutched his fist in a downward motion, stepped his right foot out then slid it back to meet the left and bowed with and open hand as their right foot crossed their left which remained stationary. You can’t beat that!\n\nWhile The “Classic Five” Temptations are regarded as the best of the best because of their popularity and musical longevity, there are sooo many other groups from the golden soul era whose choreography was just as synchronized and enjoyable to watch as their harmonies were to hear. I’ve compiled a small list of some groups that can easily get overlooked in this discussion. Check out the videos below and rate which group you think has the best choreography!\n\nFirst up is a group who got their started in my birthplace, Washington, DC. The Unifics may be regarded as a one or two-hit wonder but they made a name for themselves as the ultimate showmen. As a matter of fact, they were considered by some as “the act that no one wanted to follow.” One could argue that their routines were over the top, but their stage presence was captivating nonetheless. Watch them work the stage, calling out for justice on their 1968 #1 hit, “Court of Love.” (Check out the white gloves too!)\n\n2. Detroit group, The Dramatics (formerly known as The Dynamics), knew how to sing about the ups and downs of love and life in classics like “In the Rain” and “Whatcha See is Whatcha Get” (while their frontman was William Howard.) Their down-to-earth harmonies didn’t lose it edge after Howard’s departure. Keeping in line with their previous songs’ themes, the new-look Dramatics also tackled the perils of loneliness in a soulful styling. In “Me, Myself and I”, L.J. Reynolds (middle) and Lenny Mayes (far right) alternate on lead vocals, describing the lot of a person who, when alone, ‘throws away his masquerade’ and ‘lets his tears go on parade.’ It’s a sad tale, indeed, but The Dramatics illustrate it in stellar fashion with dynamic footwork. See their performance on “Soul Train.”\n\n3. In 2010, Dr. Gru’s minions got a little bit of “Boogie Fever” in the first “Despicable Me” movie; that was all possible because The Sylvers brought us that disco hit more than 30 years before in 1976. The Sylvers – like many groups in the 70s – consisted of musically inclined siblings who were ready to take over the world. A pairing with Jackson 5 producer, Freddie Perren, gave them that opportunity, leading to the release of their biggest hits which are synonymous with the “bubble-gum” sound. But the family was too talented to be boxed into that style and become “unsung”; they had not only a great stage presence but also an outstanding songwriter in older brother Leon (who went on to write for The Whispers, Shalamar, etc.) Now, take a look at the group in their prime, getting down with the get down on “The Midnight Special.” (In this clip, you’ll see Edmund, James, Ricky, Leon, Pat, Angie, Charmaine and Foster.)\n\n4. After an unsuccessful string of singles, Christopher James/Ollan Bell reformed his group, The Natural Four, in 1972 with three new members. James was looking for a fresh start, and he and his guys got it when they signed with soul man, Curtis Mayfield. Two years later, in 1974, The Natural Four finally hit the charts with “Can This Be Real”, featuring new member, Delmos, on lead. Unfortunately, the group never had similar success with any follow-up single, which is surprising because they were under Mayfield’s tutilage, but, you can see the guys groove so smooth to the tune that helped them leave their mark in Soul/R&B history.\n\n5. If someone were to mention “sugar pie” and “R&B music” in the same sentence, the first song you’d probably think of is “Sugar Pie Honey Bunch (I Can’t Help Myself”) by The Four Tops. That would be understandable because that song is the Tops’ signature tune. But, The Joneses, originally from Pittsburgh, PA, hit the charts in 1974 with a sweet song of devotion called “Sugar Pie Guy.” The track is notable for its beginning scatted bass lines, courtesy of lead vocalist, Harold Taylor; but the guys got on the good foot too when they performed their sugary musical treat on “Soul Train.”\n\nAlright! Now, that you’ve seen all five videos, rate which one you think is best! I already have my pick 🙂\n\nI cling to the fact that I’m an 80’s baby, even though I was introduced to the world in the last month of the last year of the decade. So, musically speaking, I was really “born into the 90’s” (like R. Kelly’s debut album), and I thus have a special fondness for the R&B of that era.\n\nAside from the nostalgia factor, the music was actually good and the singers really sang. R&B fans were given timeless music by solo artists like Brian McKnight, Monica, Babyface, and Mary J. Blige, in addition to groups such as Boyz II Men, SWV, Dru Hill and En Vogue. We fell in love with gems created during that time period including Whitney Houston’s powerful rendition of “I Will Always You” (1992), Montell Jordan’s instant party starter, “This is How We Do It” (1995), Kenny Lattimore’s wedding staple, “For You” (1997), and Deborah Cox’s soul-stirring “Nobody’s Supposed to Be Here” (1998).\n\nSadly, though, the last decade (the mid 2000’s to now in 2014) has hardly produced R&B classics of that magnitude. There have been more than enough catchy radio hits but not enough songs that will stand the test of time. To that end, several artists have weighed in on “the state of R&B” conversation in recent years, most of whom say there’s been a tremendous change in the music, namely, digression instead of progression.\n\nFor instance, the style has become diluted because nobody’s really singing from the soul now. Rappers are singing (thanks to auto-tune) and singers are rapping, or at least trying to. Also, artists who had started out strictly urban i.e. Ne-Yo have concentrated their efforts on pleasing the pop crowd and are just now coming back to their R&B fan base. That said, I believe there are many differences in R&B music from the 90’s/early 2000’s to the latter 2000’s to 2014 but I’ll discuss one – quality of content.\n\nNowadays, mainstream music that’s branded as “R&B” is more vulgar and lacks lyrical depth. Speaking of vulgarity, it used to be that only Hip-Hop/Rap albums had the label, “Parental Advisory: Explicit Content”; but now R&B artists need the same thing because their singles are just as dirty. Yes, R&B will forever be inextricably linked to Hip-Hop/Rap because of how the two genres feed off of each other naturally in music, but there’s hardly a distinction between the two styles anymore.\n\nJust think about the fixation with the ‘f-bomb’ in today’s R&B lyrics, i.e., the original/explicit titles of Cee-Lo’s “Forget You” (2010) and Chris Brown & Nicki Minaj’s “Love More” (2013), as well as the unedited chorus of Miguel and Mariah Carey’s duet, “#Beautiful” (2013). In addition, today’s “R&B” songs refer to women as “hoes” and b*****s, as if they’re solely objects of men’s sexual gratification. In 90’s/early 2000’s R&B, though, women were spoken of with more respect.\n\nWhile the decade obviously had its fair share of raunchy tracks, women were caressed with love and adoration in the average R&B song. In Jodeci’s “Forever My Lady” (1991), for example, K-Ci takes the lead in praising the love of his life who’s also the mother of his newborn child, calling her a “lady”, not a garden tool or a female dog. That celebratory regard for women is sorely lacking right now, having been largely replaced with a flippant and condescending disregard for them.\n\nSwitching gears to lyrical depth, let’s compare two songs based on a woman’s conversation with her boyfriend. In Brandy’s “Almost Doesn’t Count” (1999), she sings, “You can’t get to heaven half off the ground. Everybody knows, almost doesn’t count.” That’s depth. A life lesson is beautifully woven inside a tale of heartbreak. Though specifically referencing a romantic relationship, anyone can take this advice in life: If you want to achieve your goals, almost doesn’t count; you have to put your all into an endeavor to get what you want out of it.\n\nOn the other hand, in Mila J’s 2014 single, “Smoke, Drink or Break-Up”, she tells her boyfriend, “Either we gon’ smoke, drink or break up ‘cause the only time we don’t fight is if we drunk or we high (oh my).” Oh my, is right! There’s absolutely no depth in those lyrics whatsoever, and look at what type of behavior is being promoted to avoid a break-up – smoking and drinking. Moreover, if a relationship is only stable when both parties don’t have full control of their mental faculties, there’s a serious issue! With content like that making up the R&B of today, there’s no wonder that Bobby V (an artist who got his start in the 90’s group, Mista) said in an interview with rollingout.com, “R&B is in a weird place.” It definitely is!\n\nJust with that little bit of analysis, it’s obvious that “the soul is gone” in today’s brand of R&B. Part of the reason is because, as I’ve heard it said lately, the lines between pop, hip-hop/rap and R&B have become blurred. Furthermore, the usage of foul/derogatory language is indicative of, not only a lack of creativity in writing, but also the respect for what the essence of R&B is. Our beloved genre, which is rooted in storytelling about the struggles and victories in life and love, is in critical danger of losing artists who are willing to put out music that adheres to its true nature. There are some who aim to keep R&B/Soul music alive, including Noel Gourdin, Leela James, Anthony Hamilton and Ledisi, but the majority of popular R&B singers fail in this department today.\n\nThis is why modern songs that have classic soul qualities strike a special chord within us — tunes like Raphael Saadiq’s “Love That Girl” (2008), R. Kelly’s “When a Woman Loves” (2010), Beyonce’s “Love on Top” (2011), Melanie Fiona’s “Wrong Side of a Love Song” (2012), Chris Brown’s “Fine China” (2013), and Tank’s “You’re My Star” (2014). Each composition personifies “feel good” music because it actually makes you feel good. Rather than brim with vulgarity or mediocrity, the lyrics come from the heart and the melodies breathe soul. That’s what R&B is all about, and that’s what true fans yearn for.\n\nI can say with surety, then, that as sure as my last name is Samuels, the 90’s/early 2000’s was the last period of time that brought that kind of music on a consistent basis. If I had to sum up my comparison of R&B today and back in the day, what better way to do so than in the words of a song? For that, I quote Atlanta-based singer/songwriter/producer, Jaye Berry, aka “Jahah”, who said in his 2014 single, “Soul Music”, “What happened to the music and the songs that take you higher? Now everything they play just sounds the same (lately) and the artists don’t inspire.” I strongly encourage you to listen to “Soul Music” in its entirety (You can watch the video below). If you have become numb to it, you’ll quickly be reminded of just how much heart and soul R&B music has been missing lately!"
