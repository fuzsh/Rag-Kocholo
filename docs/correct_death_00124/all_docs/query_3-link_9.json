The band are playing the Georgia Dome, and it is one of the few times on this tour that the band plays on the U2360 stage inside. The show gets a number of poor reviews from concert attendees from how loud and muffled the sound is indoors. Muse joins U2 tonight as the opening act.\n\n“Stuck in a Moment” moves earlier in the set, and “Until the End of the World” reappears in the set after skipping the last three shows. “Unknown Caller” is still missing from the set list since the September 24 show in East Rutherford. Otherwise the show has settled into a routine, and there are no huge surprises. The band give a very solid performance.\n\nSnippets tonight include “Blackbird” during “Beautiful Day” and “Stand By Me” at the end of “I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For”. “Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)” pops up in multiple locations during “I’ll Go Crazy”. Bono remembers the last minute addition of “People Get Ready” in Raleigh at the request of a fan, and includes it in “Sunday Bloody Sunday” again this evening. “You’ll Never Walk Alone” appears in “Walk On”, and “Amazing Grace” and “All You Need is Love” appear in “Where the Streets Have No Name”. Bono also includes the extended “Hear Us Coming” verse in “One” this evening.\n\nIn his diary for U2.com, Willie Williams shares, “It was a good show too with a very lively crowd – the building even sounded good given that it has a roof, which creates an acoustic nightmare. Some of the R.E.M. folks came along which was wonderful. These included Bill Berry, former drummer, now retired, and someone I’ve not seen in many years.” Brooke Shields is also spotted in the house tonight.\n\nA review of the show in Spinner.com shares: “The band’s current tour of the country’s biggest venues, then, attempts to reconcile the Band with the Idea by making each bigger than a fan ever thought possible. Just as the stage setup is breathtakingly gigantic and elaborate, so too does U2 attempt to recreate each song in an emotional space that is both individual for each fan, but shared throughout the whole crowd. And they almost pull it off, too. In front of a near sell-out crowd in Atlanta’s Georgia Dome (capacity: 71,250) to deafening applause, Bono, the Edge, Larry Mullen Jr. and Adam Clayton ran through a two-hour-plus set heavy with hits from U2’s most recent three albums while literally running all over the stage, a multi-layered circle adorned with a towering structure that looks like the claw in an 25-cent arcade game. There are few words that could do the stage justice — overwhelming, incredible and, to cop a phrase from tour openers Muse, supermassive all seem to sell it short.”\n\nRelated News\n\n2009-04-07 U2 360 Tour Presented by Blackberry: Fastest Sell Out & Largest Concert Attendance in Rose Bowl Hist (Live Nation Publicity)\n\nOfficially Released Tracks\n\n< PREVIOUS SHOW | NEXT SHOW >"
