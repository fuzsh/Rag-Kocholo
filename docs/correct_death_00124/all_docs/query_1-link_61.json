        "text": "DATE August 28, 2001 ACCOUNT NUMBER N/A\n\nTIME 12:00 Noon-1:00 PM AUDIENCE N/A\n\nNETWORK NPR\n\nPROGRAM Fresh Air\n\nInterview: Jerry Butler talks about his autobiography: \"Only the\n\nStrong Survive: Memoirs of a Soul Survivor\"\n\nTERRY GROSS, host:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross.\n\nIt's Soul Music Week on FRESH AIR. Today through Labor Day we're featuring\n\ninterviews with soul singers, songwriters, session musicians and producers.\n\nIn\n\n1957 singers Jerry Butler and Curtis Mayfield teamed up in Chicago to form\n\nthe\n\nvocal group The Impressions. The group's first hit was the 1958 recording\n\n\"For Your Precious Love,\" featuring Butler singing lead. The following year\n\nButler left the group to start a solo career, going on to have such hits as\n\n\"He Will Break Your Heart,\" \"Moon River,\" \"Make It Easy On Yourself,\"\n\n\"Western\n\nUnion Man\" and \"Only The Strong Survive.\" Curtis Mayfield went on to become\n\na\n\nstar singer, songwriter and producer. We'll hear an interview from the\n\narchive of the late Curtis Mayfield later in the show.\n\nI spoke with Jerry Butler last year after the publication of his memoir,\n\n\"Only\n\nthe Strong Survive.\" He was born in rural Mississippi in 1939. Three years\n\nlater, he moved with his family to Chicago, where he still lives. In fact,\n\nhe's now in politics, serving his fourth term on the Cook County Board of\n\nCommissioners.\n\nLet's start with some music.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nBackup Singers: I remember.\n\nMr. JERRY BUTLER (Singer; Author, \"Only The Strong Survive: Memoirs of a\n\nSoul Survivor\"): I remember my first love affair.\n\nBackup Singers: I remember.\n\nMr. BUTLER: Somehow or another, the whole darned thing went wrong.\n\nBackup Singers: I remember.\n\nMr. BUTLER: And my mama had some great advice, so I thought I'd put it in\n\nthe words of this song.\n\nBackup Singers: I remember.\n\nMr. BUTLER: I can still hear her saying, `Boy...'\n\nBackup Singers: Boy. Boy.\n\nMr. BUTLER: `...oh, I see you sitting up there all alone crying your eyes\n\nout 'cause the woman that you love is gone. Oh, there's going to be,\n\nthere's\n\ngoing to be a whole lot of trouble in your life.'\n\nBackup Singers: A whole lot of trouble.\n\nMr. BUTLER: `Oh, so listen to me. Get up off your knees 'cause only the\n\nstrong survive.' That's what she said. She said only the strong survive.\n\nOnly the strong survive. Yeah, you got to be strong.\n\nBackup Singers: Oh.\n\nMr. BUTLER: You better hold on.\n\nBackup Singers: Hold on.\n\nMr. BUTLER: Don't do...\n\nBackup Singers: Go. Go. Go.\n\nGROSS: Jerry Butler, welcome to FRESH AIR.\n\nMr. BUTLER: Thank you, Terry.\n\nGROSS: Tell us the story behind this song.\n\nMr. BUTLER: Actually, this song--the lyrics were actual conversation that I\n\nhad with my mother when I was about 16 years old. I was in love with an\n\nolder\n\nwoman, if you can believe that, and naturally, she said, `This is a kid.\n\nI've\n\ngot to move on with my life and do some other things.' And so she just kind\n\nof dropped me like a hot potato. So I went and told Mama, `Hey, look, this\n\nis\n\nthe end of the world.' She said, `Boy, let me tell you this, that you have\n\nnot seen half of the beautiful, lovely women in this world. And for you to\n\nbe\n\ngoing through these kinds of changes this early in your life is absolutely\n\nridiculous. Get out of here. You'll get over it.' And \"Only The Strong\n\nSurvive\" was really created out of that conversation. Kenny Gamble and Leon\n\nHuff were the co-writers on it. But the introduction that was recited was\n\nreally from that conversation with my mother.\n\nGROSS: Now you first sang gospel music. You were part of a group called\n\nthe\n\nNorthern Jubilee Singers(ph), and Curtis Mayfield was in that group too.\n\nAnd,\n\nof course, you also sang together in The Impressions. How did you first\n\nmeet?\n\nMr. BUTLER: Curtis' grandmother, the Reverend Annabelle Mayfield(ph), was\n\nthe pastor of this little congregation called the Traveling Soul\n\nSpiritualist\n\nChurch. And Curtis' older cousins had this little group called the Northern\n\nJubilee Singers. I wound up at this church one afternoon with a friend of\n\nmine, a fellow by the name of Terry Williams(ph), because we just had\n\nsinging\n\nin common and loved to do it. He said, `I want you to meet these people and\n\nget to know them and maybe you will decide to get involved with the group.'\n\nIn fact, I did.\n\nWe used to kick Curtis to the side, because he was probably nine years old.\n\nHe was the little guy. You know, I was 13. I was an old man. And so we\n\nkind\n\nof kept shoving him to the back, shoving him to the back, until he learned\n\nhow\n\nto play the guitar. And then he kind of just took over because he was the\n\nreal musician out of the group.\n\nGROSS: Had your voice changed yet?\n\nMr. BUTLER: As a matter of fact, it had. My voice went into the baritone\n\nregister when I was about 13, and it has never come up again.\n\nGROSS: What about Curtis Mayfield's? His couldn't have. He was only nine.\n\nHow did he sound?\n\nMr. BUTLER: Well, you know, Curtis was just the opposite. Curtis always\n\nkind of sounded like a little girl, you know. (Singing in little voice) Got\n\nto keep on pushing. Can't stop now. Move up a little higher.\n\nSo he always had that kind of thing going. And I think, over time, he\n\neffectively, as Smokey has done, used it to the point that it became really\n\nkind of his natural sound.\n\nGROSS: Now did you and Curtis Mayfield leave gospel music for rhythm and\n\nblues at about the same time?\n\nMr. BUTLER: You know, we were never big and famous, as was Sam Cooke or Lou\n\nRawls with the Pilgrim Travelers, and Sam Cooke with The Soul Stirrers. We\n\nwere basically a local group of kids attached to this one particular church.\n\nAnd even though on occasion we might wind up in the company of those great\n\nstars, we were never really known outside of the city of Chicago. And so\n\nwhen\n\nwe started singing rhythm and blues, nobody was really affected by it, but\n\nmaybe the people who belonged to the church and us.\n\nWhen Sam left, that was an uproar throughout the whole country in most of\n\nthe\n\nchurches, because here was this gospel icon that had gone from singing the\n\nsacred music to singing the secular music. And so there was a lot of, you\n\nknow, gnashing of teeth and carrying on about that.\n\nBut Curtis and I, we've really made the--and I would like to say we made an\n\nextension rather than a transition. Because even in Curtis' music\n\nthroughout\n\nthe civil rights movement or what have you, you can still hear the strains\n\nof\n\nthe gospel. And he really wrote kind of inspirational songs, as opposed to\n\nwhat I call `hope to die' love songs, which are the kind of things that I\n\nwas\n\nwriting.\n\nGROSS: What's an example of a `hope to die' love song?\n\nMr. BUTLER: (Singing) Your precious love means more to me than any love\n\ncould ever be. Whereas, he was writing: (Singing) Got to keep on pushing.\n\nCan't stop now. Move up a little higher. You see the difference in that?\n\nGROSS: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nWell, I think it's time to hear your first hit, \"For Your Precious Love,\"\n\nwhich was recorded in 1958 when you were with The Impressions. And you say\n\nthat this was--that the lyric was originally a poem that you wrote when you\n\nwere in high school?\n\nMr. BUTLER: Yes. A poem called \"They Say(ph),\" as a matter of fact, as you\n\nwill hear it in the lyric.\n\nGROSS: And was it changed at all for the lyric, or is it exactly the same?\n\nMr. BUTLER: The only thing that was changed is the title: \"For Your\n\nPrecious Love.\"\n\nGROSS: OK. This is 1958. Jerry Butler and The Impressions.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nJERRY BUTLER and THE IMPRESSIONS: (Singing) Your precious love means more\n\nto\n\nme than any love could ever be. Oh, when I wanted you, I was so lonely and\n\nso\n\nblue. So that's what love will do. And, darling I was so surprised, oh,\n\nwhen\n\nI first realized that you were fooling me. And, darling, they say that our\n\nlove won't grow, but I just want to tell them that they don't know. For\n\nlove...\n\nGROSS: My guest is soul singer Jerry Butler. that's his 1958 hit with The\n\nImpressions, \"For Your Precious Love.\" And he has a new memoir called \"Only\n\nthe Strong Survive.\"\n\nNow you recorded \"For Your Precious Love\" in your first recording session\n\nfor\n\nVee-Jay and you also recorded that day \"Sweet Was The Wine.\" Which was\n\nsupposed to be the A side?\n\nMr. BUTLER: Actually, we thought--when I say `we'--I thought and most of\n\nthe\n\npeople who were in the room when \"For Your Precious Love\" was recorded, felt\n\nthat \"For Your Precious Love\" was a hit. But because it was such a ballad\n\nand\n\nso slow and so spiritual in feeling, the record company wanted to go with\n\nthe\n\nother side, which was more up tempo and danceable and supposedly more what\n\nteen-agers were all about. But \"For Your Precious Love\" won out. And it\n\nwas\n\njust one of those songs that teen-agers, as well as older people, enjoyed,\n\nand\n\nit became the A side.\n\nGROSS: Were there any squabbles about who would get to sing lead on your\n\nfirst recordings?\n\nMr. BUTLER: You know, it kind of came with the song. For instance, if\n\nCurtis wrote the song, Curtis sang the lead. If I wrote the song, I sang\n\nthe\n\nlead.\n\nThere was a squabble after \"For Your Precious Love\" was released because\n\nVivian Carter, who owned Vee-Jay Records and was the V in Vee-Jay Records, I\n\nshould say, was also a disc jockey in Gary, Indiana. And she decided,\n\nhaving\n\nhad an experience with a group called The Spaniels where she wanted to take\n\nthe lead singer and give him a career of his own, but he was so interwoven\n\nwith the fabric of The Spaniels that she was afraid she would destroy the\n\nwhole thing, made a promise to herself that the next time someone came\n\nthrough\n\nthat door that had a unique sound and had a unique voice in it, that she was\n\ngoing to build that unique voice along with the group. So that in later\n\nyears\n\nif there was a breakup or if she decided to move one of the parts toward\n\nanother career, she could take one act and make two.\n\nThe Impressions happened to be that act. And Jerry Butler happened to be\n\nthat\n\nvoice. And so when the recording was released, it was released as Jerry\n\nButler and The Impressions, and the group never recovered from it. We\n\nargued\n\nand fought about the billing from that day until the day I left, which was\n\nabout seven months, eight months later.\n\nGROSS: Did that have to do with your leaving?\n\nMr. BUTLER: Yes.\n\nGROSS: Explain more about that.\n\nMr. BUTLER: Well, here we were, five young guys, walked into a recording\n\nstudio as The Impressions, walked out as Jerry Butler and The Impressions.\n\nThe other four guys were wondering, `Well, what did Jerry do to get top\n\nbilling? How did all of a sudden it start to look as though we're working\n\nfor\n\nhim, as opposed to him being just part of the group?'\n\nWhen we got to the Apollo Theater in New York, they had Jerry Butler in\n\ngreat\n\nbig letters, The Impressions in small letters. By the time we get to Miami,\n\nFlorida, there's just Jerry Butler on the marquee; no Impressions at all.\n\nAnd\n\nin each one of those places, the other guys refused to perform because their\n\nfeelings were hurt. Their pride was hurt. They just could never understand\n\nit. And no matter how much I told them that I hadn't done anything, that\n\nthis\n\nwas a decision that had been made by the record company, they just never\n\nbought it.\n\nGROSS: Did you realize yourself at the time how talented a singer and\n\nsongwriter Curtis Mayfield was?\n\nMr. BUTLER: No. You know, Curtis was, when we first started, writing fairy\n\ntales, you know, \"Minstrel And Queen,\" \"Gypsy Woman,\" those kinds of little\n\nsongs. And they were cute, but they, to me, did not show any out-of-sight\n\nkind of talent.\n\nAbout 1963, two or three, somewhere in there, he started to write the songs\n\nthat, to me, were really Curtis Mayfield. He had matured to the point where\n\nhe was writing \"We're a Winner,\" \"Keep On Pushing,\" say, \"It's All Right,\"\n\n\"I'm So Proud of You.\"\n\nAnd then in the late '60s, he starts to do movie scores, \"Superfly\"...\n\nGROSS: Mm-hmm.\n\nMr. BUTLER: ...and \"Let's Do It Again,\" and \"Claudine,\" and that was when,\n\nyou know, my head started spinning around. And I said, `You know, this guy,\n\nwho I've treated as a younger brother most of his life, and as a kid brother\n\nat that, is really a genius.'\n\nGROSS: You wanted him to work as your backup guitarist when you went solo.\n\nMr. BUTLER: Yeah. Actually, what happened was when the group broke up, I\n\ngot my share of whatever was left and started out on a solo career. I was\n\nperforming in Washington, DC, and my guitarist, who denies to this day that\n\nhe\n\ndid it--a fine guitarist by the name of Philip Upchurch--just quit. And he\n\nsaid, `I'm leaving. I've got a better gig. And I'm out of here.'\n\nI was in a lurch. I didn't know what to do. I needed a musician to help me\n\nget through these performances. And so I called on my friend Curtis and he\n\nresponded. He said, `You know, all I can play are the songs that I've\n\nwritten\n\nor the songs that we wrote together. And, yeah, I'll do that.' And so he\n\nflew out to Washington and we started to work together. And out of that, we\n\ndeveloped some songwriting skills between the two of us, and we started a\n\npublishing company called Curtom Music, which he later sold to Warner\n\nBrothers\n\nMusic for a whole lot of money.\n\nGROSS: Now you say in your memoir that when you were a, quote, \"lightweight\n\ncelebrity,\" before you became very famous, that you still lived in the\n\nhousing\n\nprojects in Cabrini Green in Chicago.\n\nMr. BUTLER: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: And you say you used to be able to ignore the pee in the elevators\n\nand\n\nthe stairs, the wine bottles and junkies. You'd been surrounded by that\n\nkind\n\nof filth most of your life. But then it became too much to bear. What\n\nchanged that made that filth too much to bear?\n\nMr. BUTLER: Well, you know, you become oftentimes a product of your\n\nenvironment. Once you have something else to compare it to, then it's\n\ndifficult. You know, it's like, `How are you going to keep them down on the\n\nfarm after they've seen Paris?'\n\nGROSS: Mm-hmm.\n\nMr. BUTLER: You know? Suddenly, we were moving around. We were being\n\ntreated as celebrities. We were eating in restaurants. We were going and\n\nliving in hotels where the rooms were spic-and-span and the beds were made\n\nup\n\nperfectly, and there was no smell of urine around. And suddenly we realized\n\nthat it was within our reach to get out, to be part of a bigger and better\n\nworld.\n\nAnd what I'm hoping that the book will do, and as I go around talking to a\n\nlot\n\nof young people who are still living in those kinds of conditions, that you\n\ncan get out. You have to work. You have to compete. But you can get out.\n\nGROSS: My guest is soul singer Jerry Butler. More after a break. This is\n\nFRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nGROSS: It's Soul Music Week on FRESH AIR. Let's get back to our interview\n\nwith singer Jerry Butler.\n\nLet me get to another hit you had, \"Moon River,\" which is the Henry Mancini\n\nsong, the title song from the movie of the same name. This is a much\n\nmore--I\n\nmean, Andy Williams also had a hit of this and his hit was a very, like,\n\nmiddle-of-the-road kind of recording. Did you consider this a different\n\ndirection for you musically?\n\nMr. BUTLER: Well, allow me to make one small correction in your statement,\n\nfirst of all.\n\nGROSS: Yeah.\n\nMr. BUTLER: The movie was entitled \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\"...\n\nGROSS: Of course. Right, yes.\n\nMr. BUTLER: ...and not \"Moon River.\"\n\nGROSS: Yes.\n\nMr. BUTLER: But the song was sang in the movie by Audrey Hepburn, sitting\n\non\n\nthe window sill with an acoustical guitar. Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer\n\nwere the writers, and they wanted to get as many people to record this song\n\nas\n\npossible because they were sure that it was going to at least be nominated,\n\nif\n\nnot win, the Academy Award. Nobody wanted to record the song. First of\n\nall,\n\nit was a waltz. Second of all, it was \"Moon River.\" `Well, where's Moon\n\nRiver and what is that all about?' Calvin Carter, who is the brother of\n\nVivian Carter who owned Vee-Jay Records and was the A&R man for the company,\n\nsaid, `Jerry, this is going to be an important song for your career. Sing\n\nthis song.'\n\nCurtis and I took the song and we hated it in three-quarter time, so we put\n\nit\n\nin four-four time. Well, when we got to the studio singing it in four, it\n\nwas\n\nabout four minutes, 15 seconds long, which was far too long for air play in\n\nthat period of time. And so we had to speed it up. When we were speeding\n\nup\n\nthe tempo, we got into a slight cha-cha, bossa nova kind of rhythm and that\n\ngave it a different edge. So we added a guitar to give it the\n\ncountry-western\n\nflavor and a harmonica. And then we just draped all these violins and\n\nstrings\n\naround it to give it New York sophistication because that's really what the\n\nwhole deal was about, was that there was this pretty young girl who was from\n\nsome rural area who had come to the big city. And she was dealing with this\n\nconcept of a Moon River, wider than a mile. She was going to cross it in\n\nstyle. She was going to be somebody. She was going to do all these\n\nwonderful\n\nthings.\n\nAnd so we had the first vocal recording of \"Moon River.\" Mancini and Mercer\n\nbelieved that I should have sang it on the Academy Awards show. The problem\n\nwas that CBS, which was the company that Columbia Records was owned by, was\n\nalso planning to give Andy Williams a television show, and they needed a\n\ntheme\n\nsong for his show. And he had recorded this \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" album,\n\nand \"Moon River\" was going to be that song. \"Moon River\" got the Academy\n\nAward. Andy Williams sang it, and it became the theme song for his show.\n\nGROSS: Do you feel kind of cheated by that?\n\nMr. BUTLER: Oh--you know, I think when it first happened, I did. But if I\n\nhad sang \"Moon River\" on the Academy Awards show, my life probably would\n\nhave\n\nbeen a lot different than the life I've had, which has been pretty good.\n\nGROSS: OK. Let's hear 1961, Jerry Butler's recording of \"Moon River.\"\n\n(Soundbite from \"Moon River\")\n\nMr. BUTLER: (Singing) Moon River, wider than a mile. I'm crossing you in\n\nstyle someday. Dream maker, you old heartbreaker, wherever you're going,\n\nI'm\n\ngoing your way. Two drifters...\n\nGROSS: Our interview with Jerry Butler was recorded last year after the\n\npublication of his autobiography, \"Only the Strong Survive.\" We'll hear\n\nfrom\n\nCurtis Mayfield in the second half of the show. I'm Terry Gross and this is\n\nFRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite from song)\n\nMr. BUTLER: (Singing) People get ready there's a train a'comin'. You don't\n\nneed no baggage, you just get on board. All you need is faith through\n\nthe...\n\n(Credits)\n\nGROSS: Coming up, as Soul Music Week continues, we listen back to a 1993\n\ninterview with the late Curtis Mayfield, whose many hits included \"Keep On\n\nPushing,\" \"We're a Winner\" and \"Superfly.\" Also we continue our interview\n\nwith Jerry Butler, and Ed Ward profiles Sam Cooke.\n\n(Soundbite from song)\n\nMr. CURTIS MAYFIELD: (Singing) The darkest of night with the moon shinin'\n\nbright. There's a set goin' strong, lot of things goin' on. The man of\n\nthe\n\nhour has an air of great power. The dudes have envied him for so long. Oh,\n\nsuperfly. You're gonna make your fortune by and by. But if you lose, don't\n\nask no questions why. The only game you know is doin' fly. Ah, ha, ha.\n\nHard to understand, but a helluva man. This god of the slum had a mind,\n\nwasn't dumb. But a weakness was shown 'cause his hustle was wrong. His\n\nmind\n\nwas his own, but the man lived alone. Ooh, superfly. You're gonna make\n\nyour\n\nfortune by and by. But if you lose, don't ask no questions why. The only\n\ngame you know is doin' fly.\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. It's Soul Music Week on FRESH\n\nAIR. Let's get back to our interview with singer Jerry Butler. He\n\nco-founded\n\nThe Impressions with Curtis Mayfield in 1957, and sang lead on their hit\n\n\"For\n\nYour Precious Love.\" Then Butler went solo, recording such hits as \"He Will\n\nBreak Your Heart,\" \"Moon River,\" \"Western Union Man\" and \"Only The Strong\n\nSurvive.\" In 1962, he had a hit recording of the Burt Bacharach-Hal David\n\nsong \"Make It Easy On Yourself.\" I asked Butler how he got to work with\n\nBacharach.\n\nMr. BUTLER: Burt had recorded \"Make It Easy On Yourself\" as a--I guess, a\n\ndemonstration record with Dionne Warwick, who was really his voice. And\n\nthey\n\ntook this record to Scepter Records. Florence Greenberg, at that time, was\n\nthe president, the owner of the company. She fell in love with Dionne's\n\nvoice, but she didn't like \"Make It Easy On Yourself.\" And so Burt was kind\n\nof stuck with this big production on this song and no place to go with it.\n\nHe used it as a demonstration record and sent it to Calvin Carter out here\n\nin\n\nChicago. And Calvin said, `Jerry, this is a good song. We ought to record\n\nthis song.' And I said, `OK. Who are we going to get to arrange it?' He\n\nsaid, `I like the way this guy arranged this song. And so we're going to\n\nuse\n\nhim.' And we went back to New York and hired Burt to do the arrangement.\n\nAnd\n\nthat's how \"Make It Easy On Yourself\" came about.\n\nGROSS: Did you learn anything musically from working with Bacharach, or\n\nlearning about singing this particular song? Did he give you any advice\n\nabout\n\nthis particular song?\n\nMr. BUTLER: You know, Burt and I were kind of at odds. Burt was a very\n\nstrict musician in the sense that--and especially with his songs because\n\nmost\n\nof these songs were new, had never been heard before and he wanted to make\n\nsure that the melody was precise and that the rhythm was precise. That's\n\nwhy\n\nI said he used Dionne the way he used her because Dionne was like an\n\ninstrument for Burt. (Singing) `Do you know the way to San Jose?\n\nDot-dot-dot-dot-dot-dot,' you know. It was very structured. She could have\n\nbeen a trumpet.\n\nGROSS: I know exactly what you mean.\n\nMr. BUTLER: OK. I had a tendency to lay back. (Singing) `Oh, breaking up\n\nis so very hard to do. But yeah--do-dee-da-da'--because I wanted people to\n\nhear my phrasing. Burt wanted people to hear his song. And so we argued a\n\nlot about it. `Well, you came in late.' And I said, `But that's where I\n\nfelt\n\nit.' `Well, it doesn't fit.'\n\nGROSS: So--but you kind of won on that one, don't you think?\n\nMr. BUTLER: Well, you know, I kind of had a lot going in my favor. I was,\n\nquote, unquote, \"the star.\" He was a fledging arranger just getting\n\nstarted.\n\nAnd the record company was paying the bill. And so--which meant eventually\n\nI\n\nwas going to pay the bill because they were going to charge all of this\n\nstuff\n\nback to me.\n\nGROSS: Right.\n\nMr. BUTLER: But we did, in fact, work as well as we could together and\n\nbecame good friends. But I never had another hit with any of his songs,\n\nwhereas Dionne had several.\n\nGROSS: Did you feel like you did what you wanted to do with \"Make It Easy\n\nOn\n\nYourself\"?\n\nMr. BUTLER: Oh, yeah.\n\nGROSS: OK.\n\nMr. BUTLER: Yeah, yeah. As a matter of fact after I recorded it, it became\n\nwhat was known in the industry as a `turntable hit.' It got lots of air\n\nplay,\n\nand we sold maybe a quarter of a million, half-million records or so.\n\nLater,\n\na group from England called The Walker Brothers re-recorded it pretty much\n\nthe\n\nsame way that I'd done it. And then to show how what goes around comes\n\naround, in the early '70s, Dionne re-records the song that I had learned\n\nfrom\n\nher demonstration record and had a big hit with it herself.\n\nGROSS: It's been so much fun to talk with you. I want to thank you so\n\nmuch.\n\nMr. BUTLER: Thank you.\n\nGROSS: Jerry Butler recorded last year after the publication of his memoir\n\n\"Only The Strong Survive.\" Let's hear his recording, \"Make It Easy On\n\nYourself.\"\n\n(Soundbite from \"Make It Easy On Yourself\")\n\nMr. BUTLER: (Singing) Oh, breaking up is so very hard to do.

And make it easy on yourself.\n\nMake it easy on yourself 'cause breaking up is so very hard to do. And if\n\nthe...\n\nGROSS: Coming up, a 1993 interview with Jerry Butler's friend and\n\ncollaborator, the late Curtis Mayfield as our Soul Music Week continues.\n\nThis\n\nis FRESH AIR.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nInterview: Curtis Mayfield talks about his singing, songwriting\n\nand producing career\n\nTERRY GROSS, host:\n\nLike many great soul singers, Curtis Mayfield started off singing gospel\n\nmusic. He later came to define the Chicago soul sound through his singing,\n\nsongwriting and producing. In the '60s with his group, The Impressions, he\n\nhad such hits as \"Gypsy Woman,\" \"People Get Ready,\" \"I'm So Proud,\" \"We're a\n\nWinner,\" and \"It's All Right.\" In the '70s, he did the soundtrack for\n\n\"Superfly.\" In 1990, he wrote some of the music for the sequel, \"The Return\n\nof Superfly.\" Later that year, he was the victim of a freak stage accident.\n\nMayfield was performing at an outdoor concert before an audience of about\n\n10,000 in Brooklyn, New York, when a lighting scaffold was blown over by a\n\ngust of wind and fell on him, breaking his neck, leaving him paralyzed from\n\nthe neck down. His health continued to deteriorate and he died in late\n\n1999.\n\nI spoke with Curtis Mayfield in 1993. When he was growing up, his\n\ngrandmother\n\nhad a church, the Traveling Soul Spiritualist Church. I asked him if he\n\nheard her preach a lot.\n\nI know that when you were growing up, your grandmother had a church, the\n\nTraveling Soul Spiritualist Church. Did you hear her preach a lot?\n\nMr. CURTIS MAYFIELD (Singer, Songwriter): Oh, yes. Reverend A.B. Mayfield,\n\nAnna-Belle Mayfield. And, of course, I heard her preach a lot and I\n\nprobably,\n\neven in my sleep, subconsciously observed a whole lot of her sermons. And I\n\nbelieve through herself and my mother, who was quite fond of all types of\n\nmusic and poems and things of that sort, she used to read to me a lot of the\n\nold Paul Laurence Dunbar writings and lyrics, and I was quite acquainted\n\nwith\n\nthe limericks and Dr. Seuss of the old years, you know.\n\nAnd, of course, I identified with her teaching me a few things on the piano\n\nas\n\na youngster. So through these two ladies, I believe over the years, I've\n\ncarried out not only my ambitions but theirs as well.\n\nGROSS: Now did you sing in her church?\n\nMr. MAYFIELD: Yes, I did. As I became older, around seven, eight years\n\nold,\n\nI became acquainted with my cousins who was a part of the church and they\n\nstarted a group known as the Northern Jubilees. And I believe this is what\n\nsort of laid out my fundamentals as to harmonies because I can recall years\n\nago playing and my watching this black and white speciality record which was\n\n78 RPM then and listening to such artists as Sam Cooke and the Soul\n\nStirrers,\n\nthe Five Blind Boys and, of course, you'd have to wind up this Victrola that\n\nwe had and insert needles every so many records, you know, to keep it going\n\nproperly. And this is how I got started, I believe, with my harmonies.\n\nGROSS: What part did you sing in a group?\n\nMr. MAYFIELD: I was always a tenor.\n\nGROSS: When you started playing guitar, started writing songs, were they\n\nsecular songs or gospel songs?\n\nMr. MAYFIELD: They were what I would think pop songs, you know. While I\n\nhave\n\nwritten a few gospel songs, what would be looked upon as gospel, I call them\n\nmore inspirational. Such songs as \"People Get Ready\" and \"Keep On Pushing.\"\n\n\"Keep On Pushing\" actually was written as a gospel song. However, I found\n\nthat all I need to do is change one lyric or one word and it was pop for us.\n\nGROSS: The word was God that you would change?\n\nMr. MAYFIELD: That's right. Instead of God gave me my strength, I said,\n\n`I've got my strength. And it don't make sense not to keep on pushing.'\n\nGROSS: Why don't we play The Impressions, \"People Get Ready\"? And maybe\n\nbefore we hear it, you can tell us about how you wrote the song, when you\n\nwrote it, what was going through your mind then.\n\nMr. MAYFIELD: Well, I can't really recall when I wrote this particular\n\nsong,\n\nbut this is a perfect example of what I believe has laid in my subconscious\n\nas\n\nto the preachers of my grandmother and most ministers when they reflect from\n\nthe Bible. You know, `People get ready, there's a train a'comin'. There's\n\nno\n\nhiding place. You don't need no baggage, you just get on board.'\n\nGROSS: Why don't we hear it? This is Curtis Mayfield and The Impressions.\n\n(Soundbite of \"People Get Ready\")\n\nTHE IMPRESSIONS: (Singing) People get ready, there's a train a'comin'. You\n\ndon't need no baggage, you just get on board. All you need is faith to hear\n\nthe diesels hummin'. Don't need no ticket, you just thank the Lord. So\n\npeople get ready for the train to Jordan, picking up passengers coast to\n\ncoast. Faith is the key, open the doors and board them. There's hope for\n\nall\n\namong those loved the most.\n\nGROSS: Curtis Mayfield is joining us from his home in Georgia.\n\nYou became the lead singer of The Impressions after Terry Butler left and\n\nthe\n\nfirst hit that you had with you as lead singer was \"Gypsy Woman.\" This was,\n\nI\n\nthink, 1961. See, you wrote the song, you sang lead. It's a great record.\n\nIt's funny, the lyric is about something that I'm sure you had absolutely no\n\nfirst-hand knowledge of. You know, a Gypsy woman who, you know, all through\n\nthe caravan, she was dancing with all the men. I mean, did you know any\n\nGypsy\n\nwomen when you wrote this?\n\nMr. MAYFIELD: No. And you're absolutely--that's absolutely true about--I\n\nsaw\n\nlots of Western movies.\n\nGROSS: Oh, right. I'm sure I saw the same ones.\n\nMr. MAYFIELD: Yes. And it's funny, 20, 25 years later, I'm in Germany and\n\nI'm performing in concert and I'm hearing people, you know, calling for\n\n\"Gypsy\n\nWoman,\" which was in the repertoire but I hadn't come to it yet. And after\n\nthe show, I had an interview such as what we're doing now and the\n\ninterviewer\n\nspoke in terms of there being lots of Gypsies in the place, which was out of\n\nthe ordinary. Gypsies never came to concerts. And, of course, they asked\n\nme\n\nabout it and I had no idea other than maybe the song. They liked the song.\n\nWell, after the interview, across the street, I'd been invited to a\n\nrestaurant\n\nwhere there was about 50 to 75 Gypsies, all the men sitting in a circle and\n\ntheir women in the middle. And when I walked in the place, they gave me a\n\nstanding ovation, great applause. And one of the gentlemen came up to shake\n\nmy hand and he said, `Curtis, we've been waiting for you for 20 years.'\n\nGROSS: You said before that singing in the gospel group helped you\n\nunderstand\n\nharmonies and that you used some of those harmonies with The Impressions.\n\nLet\n\nme play a record that I just particularly love the harmonies on and this is\n\n\"I'm So Proud.\" It's really such a beautiful ballad. How would you work\n\nout\n\nthe harmonies for one of the records? Maybe you could talk specifically\n\nabout\n\nworking out the harmonies on this one.\n\nMr. MAYFIELD: Well, a song like \"I'm So Proud,\" it just--there was nothing\n\nto work out. As soon as I would say `prettier than all the world,' through\n\nmy\n\nmelody would automatically come the harmonies of Fred and Sam. There was\n\nnothing to work out. It was easy as apple pie.\n\nGROSS: Let's hear \"I'm So Proud.\"\n\n(Soundbite of \"I'm So Proud\")\n\nTHE IMPRESSIONS: (Singing) Prettier than all the world. And I'm so proud,\n\nI'm so proud, I'm so proud of you. You're only one fellow's girl, and I'm\n\nso\n\nproud, I'm so proud, I'm so proud of you. I'm so proud of being loved by\n\nyou.\n\nAnd it would hurt, hurt to know if you ever were untrue. Sweeter than the\n\ntaste of a cherry so sweet. And I'm so proud, girl, I'm so proud, I'm so\n\nproud of you. Compliments to you from all the people we meet. Yes, and I'm\n\nso proud. I'm so proud. Believe me, I love you, too. I'm so proud of\n\nbeing\n\nloved by you.\n\nGROSS: Curtis Mayfield is my guest.\n\nLet me skip ahead to \"Superfly,\" the songs that you wrote for the film of\n\nthat\n\nname. It's really such a great score, you know, such a great set of songs.\n\nHow did you get the assignment to write the songs for the movie?\n\nMr. MAYFIELD: Well, a gentleman by the name of Philip Fenty in New York\n\ncame\n\nto the Lincoln Center where I was appearing. Between shows, I met him and\n\nSig\n\nShore who was to become the producer. Philip wrote the screenplay and they\n\nwere very hot about--especially Philip who was from 125th Street in New York\n\nCity. He wanted me to write the music for \"Superfly.\"\n\nGROSS: Let me ask you about one of the songs I particularly like from\n\n\"Superfly\" and that's \"Freddie's Dead\" which, I think, became one of the\n\nmost\n\npopular songs from the movie. I mean, one of the really good things about\n\nit\n\nis the way this song tells a whole story. Do you want to talk about writing\n\nit?\n\nMr. MAYFIELD: Well, most of my lyrics in song, if you listen closely, will\n\nnot only give you a lyrical balance but also give you a visual balance and I\n\nthink that's probably what was appreciated through \"Freddie's Dead\" is that\n\nyou could also see it visually and it spoke of a young man who was a decent\n\nguy overall, but was dealing with the wrong crowd, in with the wrong crowd.\n\nAnd his doings were, you know, of the lowest caliber, dealing with drugs.\n\nAnd\n\nhis old lady wasn't helping him any either.\n\n(Soundbite of \"Freddie's Dead\")\n\nMr. MAYFIELD: (Singing) Freddie's dead, that's what I said. Let the man\n\nread the plan, said it singing home. But his home was a rope and he should\n\nhave known. It's hard to understand there was love in this man. I'm sure\n\nall\n\nwould agree that his misery was his woman and friends. Now Freddie's dead.\n\nThat's what I said.\n\nGROSS: Our interview with Curtis Mayfield was recorded in 1993, six years\n\nbefore his death.\n\nComing up, rock historian Ed Ward profiles Sam Cooke as our Soul Music Week\n\ncontinues. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nProfile: Gospel and soul singer Sam Cooke & The Soul Stirrers\n\nTERRY GROSS, host:\n\nAt least three of the singers we're hearing from on Soul Music Week, Curtis\n\nMayfield, Aretha Franklin and Bobby Womack credits Sam Cooke with having\n\ninspired them to cross over from gospel to pop. Rock historian Ed Ward has\n\na\n\nprofile of Cooke during his early career before records like \"You Send Me\"\n\nand\n\n\"Wonderful World.\" Ed goes back to Cooke's own gospel groups, which\n\ncontinued\n\nto influence Cooke from his first hit to his last.\n\n(Soundbite from song)\n\nMr. SAM COOKE: (Singing) I was born by the river in a little tent. Oh, and\n\njust like a river I've been running ever since. It's been a long, a long\n\ntime\n\ncoming, but I know a change gonna come. Oh, yes it will.\n\nED WARD:\n\nI don't know how many times I've picked up a soul singer's biography and\n\nread\n\nthat their career started in church. The black church has always been where\n\nthe soul in soul singing comes from, yet it's not always easy to show that\n\nfact clearly. But in the case of Sam Cooke, the man who very nearly\n\ninvented\n\nsoul music, we can hear it happen.\n\nThe story starts with The Soul Stirrers.\n\n(Soundbite from \"His Eye Is On the Sparrow\")\n\nSOUL STIRRERS: (Singing) Why should I feel discouraged? Why should the\n\nshadows fall? Why should my heart feel lonely, Lord, and long for my\n\nheavenly\n\nhome? For Jesus is my portion. A constant friend is he. His eye is on, on\n\nthe sparrow and I know he watches me. Oh, Lord, I sing...\n\nWARD: The Soul Stirrers were one of America's top gospel groups, founded in\n\nthe '30s around the incomparable singer R.H. Harris, whom we heard singing\n\n\"His Eye Is On the Sparrow.\" But in 1950, Harris decided to retire and The\n\nSoul Stirrers, who were still headliners, searched for a replacement. They\n\nfound him in Sam Cooke, a minister's son from Chicago, who was only 16 years\n\nold, but was already a veteran of the gospel scene after singing for a\n\ncouple\n\nof years with another top group, the Highway QCs. He had the looks. He had\n\nthe experience and, as they found out the first time they went into the\n\nstudio\n\nwith him, he had the voice.\n\n(Soundbite from song)\n\nSOUL STIRRERS: (Singing) Oh, the bear will be gentle. You know the wolf\n\ngonna be so tame. The mighty lion, he will lie down with a lamb. Oh, yes.\n\nI\n\nknow the hosts from the wild will be led by a little child, and I'll be\n\nchanged from this creature that I am. Oh, there'll be peace in the valley\n\nfor\n\nme.\n\nWARD: Don't discount the value of looks either. Gospel music is still show\n\nbusiness and yet it's the kind the young tend not to go see. Suddenly the\n\nold\n\nmen in The Soul Stirrers found they were getting young girls in the front\n\nrows\n\nand that the frenzy was wilder than usual.\n\n(Soundbite from \"Nearer To Thee\")\n\nSOUL STIRRERS: (Singing) Sometimes I like to be in company, and then again\n\nI,\n\nI like to steal off all alone. A song is the only thing, Father, that will\n\nconsole me, Lord, when I know trouble, trouble's about to come. I can fall\n\ndown on my knees and call God late at night, and I know, Lord, he'll make\n\nmy,\n\nhe'll make my burdens all right. If I tell him, Lord, I've got a desire\n\n(unintelligible). I'll tell him, Lord, I'll be all right if I can get\n\nnearer\n\nto thee, nearer to thee. Through all my trials, you'll help me, Lord, if I\n\ncan get nearer. I want to get a little bit nearer, nearer Lord. Lord, oh,\n\nLord, I, I want to be...\n\nWARD: Even on this fairly primitive live recording \"Nearer To Thee\" made in\n\nLos Angeles in the mid-'50s, you can get an inkling of the excitement Sam\n\nCooke generated; a palpably sexual reaction similar to, but different, from\n\nthe normal gospel fans' reaction. And those of you who are familiar with\n\nSam's later work will recognize where he got \"Bring It On Home To Me.\"\n\nBy 1956 Sam Cooke was 21 years old and feeling the urge to move on. He\n\nsecretly recorded a pop song, \"Loveable,\" and released it under the name\n\nDale\n\nCooke. The reaction was strong enough that he handed The Soul Stirrers his\n\nresignation and never looked back. The gospel world was scandalized and a\n\nrumor circulated that Sam Cooke had sold his soul to the devil. If he had,\n\nthe devil had gotten himself a bargain. Sam Cooke had more soul than most\n\npeople. Although he tried to reconcile with the gospel world and get it to\n\naccept what he'd done, he was an outcast among them and remained that way\n\nuntil the night in 1961 when he was shot to death in a still unexplained\n\nincident in a motel.\n\nToday, Sam Cooke's pop recordings still stand as milestones, but anybody who\n\nloves his singing really owes it to themselves to look into the place where\n\nit started, with The Soul Stirrers.\n\nGROSS: Our rock historian, Ed Ward, lives in Berlin.\n\n(Credits)\n\nGROSS: I'm Terry Gross.\n\n(Soundbite from song)\n\nMr. COOKE: (Singing) If you ever change your mind about leaving, leaving me\n\nbehind, baby, bring it to me. Bring your sweet loving; bring it on home to\n\nme.\n\n(Credits)\n\n(Soundbite from song)\n\nUnidentified Man: (Singing) Oh, help me! Yeah. I'm a midnight mover.\n\nGROSS: On the next FRESH AIR, Soul Music Week continues with singers Bobby\n\nWomack and Barry White. I'm Terry Gross.
