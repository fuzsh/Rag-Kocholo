        "text": "Curtis Mayfield\n\nJune 3, 1942 – December 26, 1999\n\nCurtis Mayfield was a pioneering soul and funk musician who became a voice for Civil Rights during the ’60s. Mayfield was still in high school when he began playing in local bands. After dropping out, he joined the Impressions, a band he would soon front and become the main songwriter for. The band would become popular during the late ’60s thanks to Mayfield-penned songs like “People Get Ready,” “Keep On Pushing,” and “We’re a Winner.” Anthemic songs like these came at a time when African-Americans were looking for a voice, and artists like Mayfield, James Brown and Sly Stone provided it. After going solo, Mayfield released his most popular album, the soundtrack to Superfly. With hit songs like “Pusherman,” “Freddie’s Dead,” and “Superfly,” the album is considered one of the most influential in African-American history. It was also one of the earliest soul concept albums. Mayfield stayed active throughout the ’80s, but in August of 1990, he was struck by falling lighting gear while backstage at a concert. The accident left him paralyzed from the neck down. Amazingly, he was able to create one last album – writing the songs, directing the musicians and crew from a bed, and painfully recording the vocals while flat on his back. The album was 1997’s New World Order. On December 26, 1999, Curtis Mayfield, age 57, passed away following a decade of poor health and complications from the accident."
