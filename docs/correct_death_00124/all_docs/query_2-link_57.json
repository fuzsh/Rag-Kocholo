        "text": "Curtis Mayfield died on December 26, 1999. With The Impressions and his solo work, he established himself as one of the most influential artists in the history of socially conscious music.\n\n“New World Order” is the title track from his final studio album, which was released in 1996. Due to the effects of paralysis, Mayfield recorded the vocals while lying on his back and he had to sing one line at a time. This didn’t diminish the soulfulness of his vocals. The Mayfield composed lyrics highlight the harsh realities of being black in America (Another victim born out here in the hood / And based on statistics it really ain’t all good”). This reality is balanced with a sense of optimism which harkens back to his 1965 classic with The Impressions, “People Get Ready”. It is also a call to action (“Let us teach the children freedom’s never been free”). Even while he was in the process of dying, Mayfield still maintained his consciousness. This song and the album it was off of, was one last opportunity to inspire. His music continues to be relevant."
