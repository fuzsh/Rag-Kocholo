        "text": "About\n\nAfter a chance meeting with Sire Records’ legendary Seymour Stein at a music conference in Australia, where American born Ben Fields had been living and working in a café, the aspiring singer and songwriter took a leap of faith. Stein had offered Fields his business card and told him to look him up if he was ever in NYC. Well, that was enough for Fields. He packed up his girlfriend, their dog, furniture and lives and moved to NYC. Fields showed up at Stein’s office with a 12-track album and the rest is history. Fields was signed to Sire in November 2012 and is currently putting the finishing touches on his debut full length, Extraordinary Light, which is slated to come out in early 2014.\n\nBen Fields is bringing a style of introspective songwriting pioneered by artists like Nick Drake and Van Morrison back into the mainstream. A stylistic homogeny of Harry Nilsson, The Beatles, Curtis Mayfield, and Lowell George gives his most recent album Extraordinary Light a sound that defined an era.\n\nFor his debut, Fields works with some of the finest including producer JC Hopkins [Norah Jones, Madeline Peyroux, Martha Wainwright], guest vocalist Jolie Holland and Warren Smith [Janis Joplin, Van Morrison, Miles Davis]. Fields sets the tone of Extraordinary Light with 'Swede' - A John Lennon Songwriting Award winner.\n\nWhat’s clear from listening is that Fields has done his 'woodshedding:' His songs breathe, his voice is very much his own, and his album is respectful of the music he has listened to and played throughout his life. In his own words 'I believe craftsmanship is far from dead. And though I do not craft shoes, or bookcases... I do craft something that I believe will not fall to pieces in weeks, or months, or years. I craft songs to last a lifetime. These songs are born of my desire to reflect and share my ever changing understanding of the truth.'\""
