        "text": "Soul legend Curtis Mayfield — who electrified pop music with such hits as “Superfly” and “People Get Ready” — died yesterday at 57.\n\nMayfield — credited for injecting a social conscience into black music at the height of the civil-rights movement — had been paralyzed since 1990, when a lighting tower fell on him at a Brooklyn concert.\n\nHe died at North Fulton Regional Hospital in Atlanta, which refused to release information about the cause of death. But Mayfield had been ill since the accident.\n\n“I lost my husband, the father of our children, my best friend and my soulmate,” his widow, Altheida, said.\n\n“Thank God his music and his legacy will live far beyond today.”\n\nMayfield is one of the few people inducted twice into the Rock ‘n’ Roll Hall of Fame — once in 1991, with his ’60s gospel-soul group, the Impressions, and again in 1999, for his solo career.\n\nBorn in Chicago on June 3, 1942, Mayfield began singing at the age of 7, taught himself to play guitar and began composing music.\n\nIn 1956, he joined church choir member Jerry Butler, brothers Arthur and Richard Brooks, and Sam Gooden in a new group, The Roosters.\n\nTwo years later, The Roosters were renamed The Impressions and recorded “For Your Precious Love,” which shot to No. 11 on the pop charts.\n\nA string of hits followed, including “It’s Alright,” “Gypsy Woman” and “We’re a Winner.”\n\nMayfield went solo in 1971. and a year later composed and recorded the soundtrack of the hit “Superfly,” about a stylishly dressed Harlem drug lord trying to go straight.\n\nAmong its hits were the title song, “Freddy’s Dead” and “Pusherman.”\n\nHe also was behind the hit soundtracks to “Claudine” (1974), with Gladys Knight & The Pips, and “Let’s Do It Again” (1975) with the Staple Singers.\n\nHe produced two Aretha Franklin albums, “Sparkle,” 1976, and “Almighty Fire,” 1978.\n\nMayfield’s critically acclaimed solo albums including “Back to the World,” 1973, “Sweet Exorcist,” 1974, “Got to Find a Way,” 1974 and “There’s No Place Like America Today,” 1975.\n\nHis career was cut short in August 1990, when a lighting rig collapsed on him as he performed in East Flatbush, damaging his spine and leaving him a quadriplegic.\n\nDespite the injury, he went on to record new material.\n\nHis work has been sampled by rap and hip-hop artists including Coolio, Dr. Dre, Snoop Doggy Dogg and R. Kelly.\n\nIn addition to his wife, Mayfield is survived by his mother; 10 children; two sisters; a brother; and seven grandchildren."
