        "text": "William DeVaughn vs. Curtis Mayfield\n\n—\n\nWilliam DeVaughn\n\n1947-\n\nWashington, DC, US\n\nFunk/Soul/R&B\n\nWilliam DeVaughn is best known for his single “Be Thankful for What You Got” (1974). The album he released that year sold nearly two million copies and reached #1 on the US Billboard R&B chart and #4 on the Billboard Hot 100. Other than that, he has since released only two albums. I really can’t find much on him other than that it seems he was super involved in his religion (Jehovah’s witness) and just lost interest in the music industry.\n\n—\n\nCurtis Mayfield\n\n1942-1999\n\nChicago, Il, US\n\nFunk/Soul/R&B\n\nCurtis Mayfield recorded over thirty albums in his many years as a writer, singer, guitarist, and general kickass musician. His lyrics are often politically and socially motivated and he was a pioneer in introducing social consciousness into black music, dating back to his days with the impressions, and continuing into his solo career. He has won numerous awards in his lifetime, including inductions into the Grammy Hall of Fame, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and the Songwriter’s Hall of Fame. In 1990, he was paralyzed from the neck down after stage lighting fell on him at a concert in New York. He could no longer play guitar but continued to write music and sing until his death. In 1998, his leg was amputated due to diabetes, and he died the next year from complications from the same disease.\n\n—\n\nStylistically, I don’t believe it’s a stretch to say that William DeVaughn’s entire first album, also named “Be Thankful for What You Got”, is similar to a lot of Curtis’ work, perhaps and bit less funky, and a bit more, I dunno, gospel-ly. In fact, the internet is lousy with people confusing “Be Thankful for What You Got” for a Curtis song. I think it’s important to give credit to DeVaughn. His style is funky, soulful, and smooth. While it may not be groundbreaking stuff, his songs tend to get stuck in your head (in a good way). You can find “Be Thankful for What You Got” pretty cheap at most record shops these days and it is definitely worth a listen.\n\nCurtis’ style, however, is unimpeachable. He clearly has the better legacy of the two, considering that I don’t think anyone mistakes “pusherman” or “superfly” for William DeVaughn songs. He pushes the boundaries of soul, seamlessly blending in funk, r&b, rock, psychedelia, and a positive message of love and equality. I own several of his albums, both solo and impressions, and there isn’t a single one I don’t love. He is an incredible songwriter, and one of my all-time favorites.\n\nBegin Battle!\n\nWho wins? Which is soul singer suits you best?"
