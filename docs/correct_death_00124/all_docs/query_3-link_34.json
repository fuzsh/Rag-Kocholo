Vocal groups harmonizing about yearning for, or losing, eternal love defined the early 1960s, and singer-songwriters with acoustic guitars and a broader lyrical vision closed the decade. Some records’ muscular brass sections propelled dancers; slower ballads highlighted intricate string arrangements. Even the blunt word “funk” signified, and combined, everything from small African percussion to interstellar explorations. R&B star Jerry Butler took in large pieces of it all. When he used his music to become an agent for wider changes, he did so in the city that always surrounded him. Almost sixty years after Butler and his early group the Impressions signed their first recording contract on Michigan Avenue’s “Record Row,” his career outside singing was just as significant as his hits. He organized a songwriters’ workshop that created a repertoire for artists who followed him. Then, after largely stepping away from concert stages and studios in the 1970s, he went on to become a successful entrepreneur and politician. Butler was elected to the Cook County Board of Commissioners in 1986 and served there for three decades, so he could have been justifiably proud when we talked on an Independence Day afternoon in 2016 as he neared retirement from public office. But hubris has never been his style. Instead, Butler’s conversational voice merely hinted at his onstage baritone; quick-witted asides poked at a more serious tone. He also credited much of his accomplishment to his community. “I’m always prejudiced when I talk about Chicago because I think it’s such a great city,” Butler said. “Most of what’s done in this city is prompted by politics, and most of black politics is supported by music. And so the music and politics kind of walk hand in hand down Michigan Avenue.”\n\n2 / Introduction\n\nMove On Up: Chicago Soul Music and Black Cultural Power details these meetings of music and hope for social progress. Mass movements and localized efforts for dynamic change helped create R&B in Chicago. Here too, musicians acted as change agents. Still, compared with other cities, surprisingly little literature describes how musical and social forces combined in this metropolitan area during the 1960s and 1970s. As a teenager I read Sweet Soul Music, Peter Guralnick’s 1986 intermingling of southern R&B and the civil rights movement, and wondered how such reporting would describe the urban North’s culture and its struggles. But since the late 1990s considerable work has focused on developments in soul music from such hubs as Memphis and Detroit. Suzanne E. Smith’s Dancing in the Street: Motown and the Cultural Politics of Detroit and Charles L. Hughes’s Country Soul: Making Music and Making Race in the American South are examples from two historians. Chicago has not been as fully investigated as these southern and midwestern counterparts, despite its large size, voluminous output, and intense political exchanges. That comparative lack of attention has been true even for local institutions. While I was growing up in Evanston, just north of Chicago, local artists’ contributions were never part of my schools’ curricula in the 1970s and 1980s (although a terrific soul singer, Patti Drew, lived just a few blocks from my classrooms). These musicians had numerous traditions to draw from, such as gospel and blues, yet they had the confidence to declare their musical independence, recasting time-honored music to make it their own. A sense of autonomy also fortified the songs that came out of these neighborhoods through the heroic black educators, record companies, and performance spaces that African American Chicagoans owned and managed. The results helped shape canonical black American music through recordings that convey a full stylistic range. Musicians also intersected with Chicago activists, whether political or commercial. All of this occurred as African American media in the city evolved with advances in radio, television, film, and other industries. Black advertising firms in the city enlisted R&B studio players to promote a heritage along with marketing household products. The politics that Butler referred to include, yet are not limited to, elections and other forms of civic governance. His friend Curtis Mayfield wrote lyrics that came loaded with polemical discourse and lend this book its title. But actions are as important as words. Musicians learning to become entrepreneurs or banding with like-minded collaborators can be as consequential as inspirational verses. Big changes can be sparked just from trying to work, or even dance, across neighborhood boundaries. Move On Up focuses on the period from the time Butler’s group first re-\n\nIntroduction / 3\n\ncorded in the late 1950s until he entered another kind of public service in the early 1980s. These twenty-five years in Chicago proved vital. A generation born at the tail end of the African American Great Migration created its art while contending with segregation, integration, and deindustrialization. Music ran alongside civil rights activism, and some performers contributed to that crusade. Like their contemporaries in the civil rights movement, these musicians displayed ample courage to cope with daunting oppositional force even when just getting together to perform or compose. In that way their artistry resembled the work of activists as they also took it upon themselves to make things better even in the worst of times.1 The contributions of the city’s musicians to such national currents as the late 1960s counterculture and black arts movement also created enduring artworks that deserve more attention, as do the stories behind their conception. As these campaigns turned toward commerce and achieving elective office during the 1970s and 1980s, musicians remained linked with these tides. Black music in Chicago continued to evolve during the later 1980s and throughout the 1990s and 2000s, but I chose not to cover those years here because those eras deserve separate books. Although I discuss the beginning of the house scene and its ties to a previous generation of music makers, a comprehensive study of that genre requires a deep dive into its changing aesthetics and narratives— such as internationally celebrated DJs, rapid technological advances, LGBTQ performance spaces, and municipal licensing laws. Presenting the recent development of hip-hop and drill music in Chicago would involve analyzing the controversial lyrics as well as detailing at length celebrated personages and recent changes within the public schools. I mention a few current musicians in the final chapter because of the way they speak about enduring soul culture and demonstrate it through their work. That a couple of them are just starting their careers provides hope for the future. My methodology stemmed from my work as a journalist, which meant speaking with as many participants as I could. So I included interviews with a range of people who made it all happen; my concentration is on artists, but entrepreneurs, fans, media figures, activists, and one original Soul Train dancer also provided valuable observations. A few became famous early in their careers, and many others were connected with people who emerged much later. At the same time, I wanted to focus on the Chicago area rather than attempt overly broad comparisons or contrasts with other cities. Some of these interviews stemmed from my contributions to magazines and newspapers (DownBeat, the Chicago Tribune). Along with enabling access, these assignments spurred my determination to undertake this larger endeavor.\n\n4 / Introduction\n\nEach encounter reaffirmed my conviction that the music and the circumstances surrounding it told a bigger story than could be presented through a series of articles. I cannot say for sure if I had this project in mind when I visited Terry Callier in 1997, but I do know that he caused many people he met to think deeply. Some speakers contradict each other, while others voice confirmations. All quotations in Move On Up are from author-conducted conversations unless otherwise noted. Popular and academic media brought up additional insights, which sometimes ran counter to, and at other times agreed with, the book’s primary witnesses. These include newspaper archives (such as the Chicago Defender and Chicago Tribune) as well as national magazines with a focus on African American topics (Ebony and Sepia) and a host of music journals. Musicologists, historians, sociologists, and political scientists occasionally corroborated these testimonies and reports, and sometimes they argued against them. My idea was to balance journalistic approaches with academic techniques and discourses to tell a story that should have more than one dimension. I used a similarly inclusive method in my previous book, which looked at the creation of Aretha Franklin’s Amazing Grace album and discussed its influence. Recent cultural histories of Chicago also helped guide my framework. Chief among them has been George Lewis’s 2008 study of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians, A Power Stronger Than Itself. While I could never claim any kind of insider status— such as Lewis has achieved within the AACM— his presentation of the voices of participants, along with his assessment of the media and scholarship, is a paradigm. Discussing popular R&B artists requires different prose style and terminology than does writing about experimental jazz musicians, but in Chicago the two genres actually cohered, a point Lewis highlights. I also model my approach on the work of historian Sheldon Cohen, whose writings about colonial-era Americans who are worthy, albeit lesser known, shine a brighter light on that time than the standard Great Man view of national progress (he is also my dad). This demonstrates another reason for focusing on the voices represented in this book: all the artists made often stellar albums and singles that deserve wider attention, in homes and on dance floors. Mostly the chapters are arranged chronologically, but like a classic 1960s R&B dance groove, the narrative calls for some stepping backward and sideways in time. I’ll leave it to readers to decide if I share Jerry Butler’s geographic prejudice about our city’s status. My intention is for Move On Up to jump-start conversation.\n\nONE\n\nHallways and Airwaves: Changing Neighborhoods and Emerging Media Inspire New Music Sometime in early 1958, five singers and their manager navigated a stretch of Chicago’s South Michigan Avenue known as Record Row. Confident, persistent, and with nothing to lose, they hoped that one of the equally undaunted companies lining the street would change their fortunes.1 Had they traveled the entire mile and a half of the street, they would have ambled from Roosevelt Road on the north to East Twenty-Fifth Street on the south.2 Collectively known as the Impressions, these vocalists, in their late teens and early twenties, were from the Cabrini-Green public housing project on the North Side. Curtis Mayfield was not yet sixteen. Decades later, he recalled snow up to their necks that Saturday morning. But it proved little hindrance as he carried his guitar and amplifier down the street.3 Eddie Thomas, the group’s manager, came from the South Side. He was about ten years older, and his education in the music business combined street smarts with improvisation. They recalled that their first stop was a company called King, but its roster was full. Then they called on Chess Records— same response. Next they approached a record company named Vee-Jay on the other side of the street. “We went over there, and I introduced myself to Calvin Carter, who was the A&R director at the time,” Thomas recalled. “I told him I’d like to bring my group over. So we set up a date to bring them in. And we went back over to Vee-Jay Records; a cold winter night too. Snow on the ground. And we did a couple songs and he said, ‘Man, your group is sounding good.’ And I said to Curtis, ‘Go and do “For Your Precious Love.”’ We did one take. Where’s the contract? OK, they signed us up.” As Jerry Butler remembered it, their interests were to be heard and not to be cheated. Almost fifty years later he recalled, “We just wanted to see if\n\n6 / Chapter One\n\nsomeone would listen to our songs without a [hidden] tape recorder going in the drawer.”4 This sequence of events and its aftermath— a hit song, international fame for the group, and solo careers for Butler and Mayfield— plays out like the kind of life-defining moment confirmed through collective memories. Legends do tend to conflict with other published narratives,5 but several singers, instrumentalists, and producers who grew up in Chicago at that time experienced similar moments. Some of these artists and producers worked on or near Record Row, others worked throughout the city. Many of them lived through the circumstances that led to the recording of such songs as the Impressions’ “For Your Precious Love.” Major social shifts ran underneath that tune’s four chords, Mayfield’s lyrical guitar lead, and the group’s incantatory harmonies. Those harmonies convey understated power. No big vocal leaps or instrumental flourishes were needed to make “For Your Precious Love” a departure from the doo-wop that came before it. While only a few people were on hand for the recording, a community generated the circumstances for this song to be created— and for a larger audience to hear it. Not only had the Great Migration from the South dramatically boosted the black population of this midwestern city, but the Impressions’ generation forged an identity through music. Diverse circumstances strengthened Chicago-area teen culture during the 1950s and 1960s.6 Songs frequently arose within the hallways of public housing projects or schools, places full of teens with plenty of ideas, and varying religious denominations informed young singers’ vocal training and inflections. The process of recording “For Your Precious Love” also reflected bigger changes. This single was cut for an African American– owned company, Vee-Jay, that was a landmark operation but not the only one of its kind. Emerging radio personalities provided airtime for records like these and spoke the same dialect as their listeners. These media voices would promote new economic resources and political advances as eagerly as they broadcast R&B hits. The real financial beneficiaries of these developments would always be questioned— these were commercial enterprises, not social missions. But whether or not everyone acted in harmony, and even if a burgeoning movement did not yet have a name, this record announced a push forward.7 On the eve of the civil rights movement in the 1950s, many Chicagoans had a great deal to push against. Schools in African American communities faced overcrowding and other entrenched difficulties. Barriers to equal employment were visible throughout the city; Butler remembers walking\n\nHallways and Airwaves / 7\n\ndowntown and seeing signs that barred blacks from applying even for dishwashing jobs. His memoir describes the racism he encountered as a student at Washburne Technical High School, a vocational institution near CabriniGreen.8 He knew that the program could take him only so far, since whitedominated unions ran apprentice programs specifically to keep blacks out of skilled trades.9 Butler, like other black musicians from his generation, remained steadfast. Black musicians who came of age in Chicago from the 1950s through the 1970s usually were either part of or not far removed from the mass movement of hundreds of thousands of African Americans who left the South for the Midwest’s largest city. As journalist Isabel Wilkerson noted in The Warmth of Other Suns, the Illinois Central Railroad “carried so many southern blacks north that Chicago would go from 1.8 percent black at the start of the twentieth century to one-third black by the time the flow of people finally began to slow in 1970.”10 By the 1950s, moreover, these new Chicagoans would “arrive with higher levels of education than earlier waves of migrants and thus greater employment potential than both the blacks they left behind and the blacks they joined.”11 They also tended to have more education than the city’s white immigrant arrivals.12 Parents sought to pass this advantage on to their offspring, although they faced institutional barriers within a school system that was 90 percent segregated by 1957 (and remained so sixty years later, when the city’s public school students were 47 percent Latino, 37 percent African American, and 10 percent white).13 As the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) reported, “In cost and quality of instruction, school time, districting and choice of sites, the Chicago Board of Education maintains in practice what amounts to a racially discriminatory policy.”14 The fight against discrimination became as internal as it was organizational. Leon Forrest, who grew up on the South Side in the 1940s and 1950s, argued that his family and neighbors took on structural disadvantages through survival strategies and mutual support systems. In his essay collection Relocations of the Spirit he wrote, “More than anything else we believed that the individual had to find something within himself, some talent, moxie, intelligence, magical nerve, swiftly developed skill, education, knack, trade, or underground craft and energize it with the hustler’s drive.”15 Indeed, these are qualities that most musicians have needed. But black artists in Chicago who developed these attributes could also rely on some reinforcement. While Forrest illustrates how such performers had to build such quali-\n\n8 / Chapter One\n\nties from within, some institutional support also existed for the kind of education he mentioned, and many times that came down to committed faculty. Families of young musicians in Chicago sought out the high schools in African American neighborhoods that had solid music programs and teachers who were more than adept. Saxophonist Willie Henderson and trombonist Willie Woods still credit the discipline they learned from band teacher Louis Whitworth at Wendell Phillips High School in Bronzeville. Captain Walter Dyett, who taught at Wendell Phillips and DuSable high schools from 1935 into the 1960s, became one of the most admired teachers. A graduate of VanderCook College of Music with a master’s degree from Chicago Musical College, Dyett’s students included Nat King Cole, saxophonists Johnny Griffin and Von Freeman (also an arranger at Vee-Jay), and many other jazz heroes. Dyett also taught future R&B musicians like violinist-turned-guitarist Bo Diddley and Morris Jennings, later a Chess Records session drummer.16 Many of these artists have commented on their teacher’s musical expertise, tough methods, and warm heart. His professional background and a supportive community embodied the qualities that later scholars of education would describe as essential.17 Another drummer, Marshall Thompson, who would switch to singing, added that Dyett’s pedagogy might seem unorthodox to some: “Capt. Walter Dyett started me off,” Thompson said. “He was one of the greatest musicians in the world. He’d throw that stick at you if you played the wrong note. He’d throw that stick right at your face. It was amazing, we had a thirty-piece orchestra and he could tell who was playing wrong.” Budding musicians also honed their skills through higher education. Between 1941 and 1964, the proportion of blacks who completed college rose from less than 2 percent to greater than 5 percent.18 As part of this trend, in 1950s Chicago more college and postgraduate educational opportunities became available to African Americans. Roosevelt University was founded in 1945 as faculty left the city’s YMCA College to protest that institution’s quotas on black and Jewish students.19 By September 1954, Roosevelt could boast of a fall enrollment of 3,500 students in its schools of arts, sciences, commerce, and music.20 This was part of a local wave of 90,000 college students, including 11,600 in the city’s three junior colleges.21 Alabama-born James Mack was one such student. His classical music education included bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Roosevelt in the 1950s. During the next decade he would mentor a host of future R&B stars at Crane Junior College before becoming in demand as an arranger.22 Another arranger, Charles Stepney, attended Wilson Junior College and Roosevelt. In the late 1960s he would apply experimental compositional theories to R&B, blues, and rock.23\n\nHallways and Airwaves / 9\n\nReligious Foundations Reflect Multiple Sources Migrants and their children also heard or participated in older traditions, from blues to singing in the many churches on the West and South Sides. Curtis Mayfield and Jerry Butler had abundant experience with church music (Mayfield also expressed his admiration for blues musicians).24 Mayfield was born in Chicago in 1942, and a few months later Butler, at age three, arrived from Mississippi with his mother and father.25 As teens, both performed in Mayfield’s grandmother’s Traveling Soul Spiritualist Church. But while soul music is rooted in gospel, a common depiction of “the black church” as a single entity is misleading. The influence of Sanctified and Baptist shouts and rhythms on gospel and R&B has been described frequently, including in my previous book.26 But denominations in black Chicago represented a cosmopolitan mixture, as did the music that resulted from this diversity. These churches and their differences reflecting class, theology, and missions had expanded since the beginning of the Great Migration.27 Eugene Dixon, who would become known as Gene Chandler, sang in a Baptist choir. Marshall Thompson said that the Chi-Lites used Catholic liturgical singing as their model. The Flamingos, who formed on the South Side in 1952, belonged to the Church of God and Saints of Christ, which incorporated Jewish theological and musical influences in its services, and the group retained these minor-key refrains in its R&B ballads. Maybe these cries also reverberate in the eerily beautiful a cappella opening of the group’s “Golden Teardrops.”28 Dells singer Chuck Barksdale imitated the bass voices he heard in his church, but he also insisted that his group’s vibrant harmonies derived from a denominational cross-pollination. “I was raised Methodist, I became a Muslim,” Barksdale said. “Mickey McGill was a Seventh-Day Adventist, Marvin Junior was a Jehovah’s Witness, and Johnny Carter was Hebrew. So we had five different situations going on, but we never had an argument about our religions. Everything that God puts together is going to be right. Mathematics is exact.”29 Other musical influences from churches were not so straightforward. In north suburban Evanston, Patti Drew grew up singing in Mount Carmel Baptist and Bethel African Methodist Episcopal congregations. In the 1960s her jazz-inflected delivery shone on such hits as “Tell Him” and “Working on a Groovy Thing.” Drew claimed that since her style did not come unadulterated from a purely Baptist or Sanctified Gospel tradition of ecstatic spirituality, her work was not easy to market as hard soul. She said her approach also derived from the “very plain, very straight” style of her main childhood church, but she also said she admired jazz stylist Nancy Wilson.\n\n10 / Chapter One\n\nReligious roots involved more than just singing or transforming the rhythms and phrasings of a traditional repertoire. Churches back then, and today, provided either a rudimentary musical education or a gateway to alternative music schooling. This offered a rich reservoir from which African American youths could claim more music as their own. As a child, Barbara Acklin sang in the New Zion Baptist Church choir and studied classical music there too, although she later mentioned preferring “soulful pop.”30 Singer-songwriter Lowrell Simon’s experience in church furthered his education: his hearing another performer in the church prompted him to ask his grandmother, a housekeeper, to pay for voice lessons.\n\nNeighborhood Bonds and Collisions Even as young people, some migrants brought southern traditions with them, which became enhanced with urban sounds. Mississippi-born McKinley Mitchell sang gospel before he relocated to Chicago in 1958 and wrote “The Town That I Live In,” which a Record Row company, One-derful, released in 1962.31 His elongated vocal lines and call-and-response delivery reflected his gospel background, yet the accompaniment from a horn section featuring saxophonist-arranger Willie Henderson and jazz trumpeter King Kolax represented different musical strains that also thrived in Chicago. The song’s lyrics— which depict loneliness and dislocation— could have derived from migration and resonated among Latino immigrants in Southern California.32 For the generation that grew up in and around Chicago, the South and its attitudes often seemed not far away. Singer Eddie Perrell attended the city’s McCosh Elementary School with Emmett Till, whose 1955 murder in Mississippi helped instigate the civil rights movement. Within Chicago, white resistance to African American migration and relocation took many forms. Lorraine Hansberry’s classic 1959 play A Raisin in the Sun drew on her family’s thwarted attempts to move into a white neighborhood in the 1930s. In Englewood on the South Side, crowds of angry whites vented their anger in 1949 when they only suspected a black family was moving into a home at Fifty-Sixth and Peoria.33 White mobs continued to use arson and other acts of terrorism in trying to block integration of other South Side neighborhoods such as Park Manor.34 Unscrupulous land speculators bought properties cheaply from white owners and sold them to black purchasers at inflated prices.35 In 1948 the United States Supreme Court struck down the practice of white property owners’ using restrictive covenants to prevent blacks from buying homes: Tovey v. Levy centered on the purchase of a residential\n\nHallways and Airwaves / 11\n\nbuilding in Englewood.36 But judicial fiat could not halt ongoing housing discrimination or white flight. As 50,000 whites left that neighborhood, its black population rose from 11 percent to 70 percent over the 1950s.37 Yet some African American artists who grew up in Englewood convey benign reflections. Speaking with them evoked not nostalgia, but a candid account of how they made connections within this time and place. Saxophonist Roscoe Mitchell said that at Englewood High School he was mentored on his instrument by the slightly older Don Myrick, years before they made their names in jazz and R&B.38 Another singer, Jackie Ross, moved to Chicago with her mother, a gospel radio disc jockey in St. Louis, on the advice of family friend Sam Cooke. For her, Englewood was a step up from worse poverty, and white flight appeared not so burdensome. After a disastrous stay in the South Side’s Washington Park area, the two of them rented an Englewood apartment from a Jewish family that vacated but left furniture behind. Still, Ross envisioned marriage as offering no relief from financial struggles when she wrote the witty “Hard Times,” which she recorded in 1962 for Cooke’s SAR label. Gene Chandler recalled that prejudice in and around Englewood was visible then, but it seemed more a vestige than an inhibiting force. He had other concerns. When I went to Englewood, it was majority white. I was twelve years old. It was probably ’52. My family decided to go to Englewood, and that’s what we did. We had racial problems, yeah. I remember there was a club there about a block from me, and they put up signs, “For Members Only” to try to keep the black people out. Well, of course, I wasn’t going into lounges anyway at that time. And it was soon changing; I think they ended up leaving the neighborhood or whatever the case might have been. So the usual racial conflicts were going on, and that was it. So I came through that. I came through the gangs because I was one of the gangs. We called ourselves the Latin Lovers. Because we didn’t go out there to fight. We just enjoyed being around each other. But there were times we had to fight somebody just to let them know that we weren’t punks.\n\nForming such bonds crossed neighborhoods and genders. As a teen in north suburban Evanston, Patti Drew said she was part of an all-girl gang called the Latin Ladies.39 These were not outliers. British music historian Brian Ward compared the cohesion within black American vocal groups to that of street gangs as social institutions that often shared membership in the 1950s.40 But neither Chandler’s nor Drew’s affiliations back then were much more than small, informal clubs.\n\n12 / Chapter One\n\nYoung performers also responded to a range of social situations just outside Chicago. In Evanston, Drew liked a combination of informal venues: along with the churches, she sang with the Evanston Township High School glee club and, at the behest of her gang, performed at Big Herm’s fast food shack.41 Arranger Johnny Pate grew up in Chicago Heights, thirty-one miles straight south of the city, during the 1930s and 1940s. He offhandedly described it as “sort of a segregated town, divided into sections. There wasn’t a lot of discrimination; we all went to school together.” The Dells (formed in 1952 as the El-Rays) started singing as teenagers in south suburban Harvey. For them, perceived class differences more than racial prejudice could have prevented their career from happening.42 Their families did not encourage singing as a career move. Artists pass through strata that their neighbors cannot penetrate, which was as true in the late 1950s as it is today. No whites-only signs were displayed in theaters, and artists were often able to work around the existing system of divided musicians’ unions.43 But their determination to succeed should not be taken as evidence that perseverance is the surest path to overcoming serious obstacles, as current pop psychology attests.44 Many young people who experienced segregation did not see themselves as victims, despite the legal and unlawful forces that disenfranchised them. Musical excellence as a means of transcendence was just one response.45\n\nSounds of Public Housing Chicago public housing increased in scale during the 1950s. The creation and legacy of the housing projects remain contentious, since crime, decay, and other social ills became their typically described characteristics. Also, historians have noted that political and other pressures prevented these public homes from being built in white areas, including a white-led race riot at Trumbull Homes in the South Deering neighborhood in 1953. 46 From 1954 through 1966, 99.4 percent of the Chicago Housing Authority’s 10,256 family units— all but 63— were in largely black neighborhoods.47 At the same time, CHA leaders constantly found themselves facing an indifferent, if not hostile, city council that resisted attempts to request more federal funding.48 Nonetheless, at least during the first years of the CHA expansion, former CHA residents contend that the complexes “created a strong sense of community,” as social welfare policy professor J. S. Fuerst noted.49 In terms of artistic output the most famous example of these projects was the Frances Cabrini Homes, which became Cabrini-Green. The original row houses were built in 1942 on seventy acres just southwest of the major\n\nHallways and Airwaves / 13\n\nthree-way intersection of North and Clybourn Avenues and Halsted Street, somewhat close to downtown. Planned as a model for an integrated neighborhood of working-class families, the site was built in a largely Italian enclave.50 About the time the Impressions walked down Record Row, larger high-rise buildings were constructed in their neighborhood, which had become predominantly African American.51 Along with Butler and Mayfield, Cabrini-Green was home to an incredible concentration of future singers, including Otis Leavill, Major Lance, Terry Callier, and Larry Wade. Butler recounts in his memoirs that he did not really notice its “filth and dirt” before touring nationally with the Impressions.52 In a 2016 conversation he mentioned that while he was living in Cabrini, he and the people around him had other concerns: “Everyone sees their conditions differently,” Butler said. “I didn’t realize that I was poor because everybody in the neighborhood was poor. So you didn’t think about how poor you were, you just thought about, ‘What am I going to do to succeed?’ That was where we came from.” After Mayfield spent his childhood moving across the city with his mother and four siblings as they struggled against poverty, he said settling in Cabrini-Green “seemed like the greatest place in the world.”53 Fuerst describes how CHA-sponsored events at that time fostered a sense of community through activities geared toward young people.54 He added that initially the CHA also had leaders who seemed concerned about the tenants’ general welfare.55 The idea of public housing as a means to encourage the kind of life that could make creating music possible came from the top down as well as from the aspiring singers. And as journalist Ben Austen described in High-Risers, his book about Cabrini-Green, the residents often took it upon themselves to organize events in the community and to look out for each other’s well-being, as Butler’s former neighbor, Delores Wilson, did.56 But these reflections were not limited to this well-documented project: vocalist Bobby Hutton had warm memories of growing up in the Far South Side’s Altgeld Gardens at that time, as did singer Maurice Jackson, whose family moved there when he was two years old. Jackson even recalled that in the 1950s it was “a paradise for black people.” In contrast to the South Side and Cabrini Green, the West Side had long been comparatively bereft of organized recreation or social activities. That part of town had no equivalent of such venues as Bronzeville’s 3,000-seat Regal Theater at Forty-Seventh Street and South Parkway. Sociologist Allan Spear wrote in 1967 that as far back as 1908 “this neighborhood had lagged behind the South Side in institutional development.”57 Singer Mitty Collier, now a pastor, believes the differences between the South Side and West Side have continued. Her recollection also hints at class distinctions: “They were\n\n14 / Chapter One\n\nmore glamorous on the South Side than on the West Side,” Collier said. “Even now, I go over there to preach and even the people in church on the West Side is more southern atmosphere, country. Like when we’d play the chitlin’ circuit and all the clubs were back off the road, off the highway, in the back with trees. The people who come to those clubs are like people on the West Side. When you got to the better upscale clubs, they were like people on the South Side.” But aspiring performers on the West Side also used what they had to their benefit. Schools were one example, even with the system’s inherent and ongoing inequalities. Bassist Bernard Reed learned how to read music during a Marshall High School summer program and looked up to the neighborhood’s drum and bugle corps. In the mid-1950s future label executive Emmett Garner enjoyed singing competitions at Marshall, which guitarist Phil Upchurch attended too. Singer Marvin Smith, who also grew up on the West Side and attended Crane Tech High School, voiced similar sentiments: “I loved high school,” Smith said. “When I went to school, there were a lot of singers around. We would sing in the corridors where you get the echo. Then when you sing in a vocal group, or just some guys getting together, you’re going to attract a crowd. Once you attract a crowd, the pretty girls are coming around. Just like the basketball players and hockey players— we were stars around school.” Other entrepreneurs and institutions assisted young people on the West Side well into the next decades, sometimes unintentionally. Singersongwriter Gavin Christopher said the blues bar Silvio’s provided him with an alternative to the jazz vocal albums his uncle preferred during the mid1950s. At about five years old, nowhere near old enough to go out drinking, he remembered listening to Sunnyland Slim and Koko Taylor outside the club during recess at his school.\n\nEmerging Voices Recharge Radio Radio connected the city and became an electronic forum throughout Chicagoland. Records cost money, and 1950s television, for those who owned sets, showed scant representation of African Americans.58 Nearly every home had a radio, and the Federal Communications Commission allowed smaller stations to boom after World War II, with 200 to 1,000-watt stations going up fivefold from 1946 to 1951.59 Nationwide, the number of stations in the country airing black programming went from twenty-four in 1946 to nearly six hundred by 1955.60 In Chicago, black voices had been on the air decades earlier. In 1929 Jack L. Cooper became a DJ on station WSBC.\n\nHallways and Airwaves / 15\n\nHe went on to start the first African American daily news broadcast, which amassed national advertising.61 And Cooper’s ambitions extended outside the broadcast booth. He advocated for such causes as exhorting Dean’s Milk to hire more black truck drivers.62 An upcoming generation of black radio personalities used their voices in the studio to signify change. Above all, they brought a speaking style that mirrored their local audience. Al Benson became the prime example. Previously known as Rev. Arthur Leaner, Benson played a mix of new jazz, blues, and R&B in the early 1950s, as his nephews George and Ernie Leaner helped him pick records from their Groove Record Shop in Bronzeville. On station WGES the Mississippi native spoke in what was recognized as a black American dialect, with its southern inflections.63 Cooper, by contrast, spoke with more proper enunciation. The change carried cultural currency. Norman Spaulding’s history of black radio in Chicago notes “the intermixture of Benson’s southern style with the northern middle-class style that evolved into a Black urban language.”64 While Benson’s dialect attracted northern listeners, these audiences’ musical preferences were changing, and local media started to go along with them. WBEE host Gregg Harris wrote in a Chicago Defender column on April 1, 1958, that he would ignore idiom boundaries and simply play “good music.” He declared, “If you want to call it rock and roll, jazz, blues, ‘pop’ or whatever, that’s your business. To me, it will be music and it will be good; it will also faithfully reflect what you indicate you want (by your letters and purchases) to hear.”65 The station also engaged in political and consumer activism, including airing a lengthy interview with a Chicago Urban League official, and it conducted surveys on the buying power of South Side consumers.66 Benson also hosted talent contests throughout the city, and clubs and high schools ran smaller versions. These events served as relatively egalitarian spaces for young performers, many of whom had more talent than connections. But Benson’s competitions at the Regal Theater were the biggest. Mitty Collier entered a Benson-run event in 1959 as an eighteen-year-old college student from Alabama with a stunning contralto voice. As Collier related, Benson’s ideals and business acumen were not mutually exclusive. After she won the talent show and received its prize of opening for Etta James and B. B King, in 1960 the DJ introduced her to a Chess Records talent scout. After numerous strong efforts, her hit singles followed three years later.67 Most likely a few underhanded favors were also exchanged between radio heavyweights and record companies. Later Benson would reveal to federal\n\n16 / Chapter One\n\ninvestigators that in 1960 he had been receiving roughly $1,000 a month from record companies.68 Yet the money Benson accepted was just a part of his overall operation, according to one of his younger followers, WGES DJ Moses “Lucky” Cordell, who also arrived in Chicago from Mississippi. As Cordell told documentary maker Michael McAlpin, Benson had a true power to persuade on a higher commercial level: “Up to the point of his demise in broadcasting Al Benson called his own shots,” Cordell said to McAlpin. “If you were going to reach the black community in Chicago, you had to come through Al Benson. . . . He talked to Coca-Cola and people of that size like they were children.”69 For some struggling young singers, such clout was not so endearing. Vocalist Millard Edwards from the Sheppards and the Esquires considered Benson a bully for his enforced favoritism. Chuck Barksdale of the Dells just called him a crook. Still, it would have been difficult for a completely honest person to exist in that field— underhanded dealings in the music industry arose long before the first radio transmission.70 Although both black and white radio programmers and employees received illicit payments for airplay, sometimes it was a matter of survival. As Billboard stated, “Black DJs often lived in squalor, earning as little as $30 a week in the ’50s when payola wasn’t illegal. It seemed as natural to pay DJs to play the records as it was to pay artists to record them.”71 Benson’s aggressive entrepreneurship crossed over into personal and unconventional political advocacy, which did not always profit him. In February 1956 (on George Washington’s birthday), the DJ hired a plane to drop copies of the US Constitution on the Mississippi state capitol. Benson said he sought to penetrate “the Ironic Curtain of racial hatred and prejudice against Negroes in one of the forty-eight sovereign states of America.”72 He also integrated the Chez Paree nightclub, a 650-seat downtown venue that presented such postwar popular entertainers as Tony Bennett and Sammy Davis Jr. Benson and a group staged a sit-in and refused to leave until African American patrons were treated with respect.73 Not long afterward, another crucial event at the Chez Paree unfolded not in its show room, but in its outdoor parking lot. Eddie Thomas had a job parking cars there about the time Benson staged his demonstration. Born in 1931, Thomas had been accepted into West Point, but his stepfather, blues pianist “Big Maceo” Merriweather, suffered a stroke in 1946, and Thomas had to take on a series of jobs to support his mother.74 “One evening in August I was parking cars and five kids from Cabrini-Green came over there,” Thomas said. “They were looking for the manager, and since I was the only black person there parking cars at night, they came to me directly. And they\n\nHallways and Airwaves / 17\n\nsaid, ‘Can you help us? We want to see the manager and be on the show with Sammy Davis Jr.’ I said, ‘I can’t get to him right now because he’s very busy, can you come back tomorrow?’ I hoped they wouldn’t come back [smiles], and bang, there they were the next night.” That group, the Medallionaires, rehearsed in Cabrini-Green’s Seward Park recreation center. This field house offers fine acoustic qualities, specifically the way isolated vocals echoed through its gymnasiums and practice rooms, even sixty years later.75 Thomas did become their manager, but when he saw them perform at a talent show, he noticed another Cabrini-Green– based group that beat them: the Roosters, who also practiced at Seward. Along with Jerry Butler and Curtis Mayfield, Tennessee-born singers Arthur and Richard Brooks made up the ensemble. Not lacking in aplomb, Thomas took them to the jazz club Mister Kelly’s on North Rush Street in the posh Gold Coast neighborhood, where they could try out their music in front of a contrastive audience— even though the venue was just a short drive away from Cabrini. Thomas also suggested a name change to reflect their urbane aspirations: “I ended up managing the Roosters, and I said, ‘You guys got a beautiful sound, you won the contest, but you should change your name. When I met you, I was very impressed with your sound, so why not change your name to the Impressions?’ Everybody was doing doo-wops, but they had something like a musical choir in the background.” That choral intoning was intentional. The Impressions’ harmonies on “For Your Precious Love” remained close to the gospel quartet tradition, but true spirit came from inside them. The song’s basic elements do not deviate much from contemporary tunes that would have been part of the late 1950s radio playlists and jukeboxes: played in the key of C, it slowly descends and ascends among four chords (C, A-minor, F, and G). This chord progression (I– vi– IV– V) would commonly be called “ice cream changes” by more seasoned musicians as a slam on its seeming simplicity. But what made the song so distinctive was the way it was delivered. Butler’s baritone avoided obvious highs and lows while conveying deep, quiet persuasion. Nor did the melody lose anything by not having an obvious hook (say, a middle eight in a thirty-two-bar form). As author Leon Forrest’s bartender-playwright Joubert Jones narrates in his 1992 novel Divine Days (set in Chicago in 1966), “For Your Precious Love” can be pinpointed as the “first urban Soul song. . . . Slick, sleek too, ultra smooth, celebratory, sincere and foxy. Ice.”76 Butler agreed that “For Your Precious Love” stood apart from the uptempo tunes of the time, and that may have come from his method. He wrote the words at age sixteen as a kind of tone poem, with Arthur and Richard Brooks adding contributions to the melody. “I don’t think I wrote a lot\n\n18 / Chapter One\n\nof poems, but I wrote a few,” Butler said. “I was always interested in poetry. My mother always pushed poetry as a way of getting you to do something in public, and to recite poetry was that thing. And out of that, songwriting developed. That was our intent, to write something different [from other doowop songs]. When you listen to it, you hear that it was a poem— probably an ode would be the correct category.” Actually big enough to sound beyond any category, the song sat in the group’s pocket as the Impressions hit Record Row.\n\nNew Record Labels Capture Youthful Sounds Vee-Jay released “For Your Precious Love” in June 1958, and it ascended to number seven on the Billboard R&B chart and number eleven on the pop listing.77 Competition proved equally intense locally and nationally as small Chicago record companies found growing audiences. These businesses also drew on a young talent pool for staff, such as Vee-Jay’s recruiting ace teenage guitarist Phil Upchurch.78 Although Vee-Jay and Chess were rivals, their emergence (Vee-Jay in 1953, Chess in 1950) arose from similar forces. Chicago’s record industry dates back to the 1920s, with Paramount, Brunswick, Okeh, Decca, and Victor issuing jazz and blues artists.79 Independent companies filled a pent-up demand for new music after World War II, and they were quicker than major labels.80 Mercury, which went into business in 1945, ran its own pressing plants.81 In this environment Leonard and Phil Chess (Poland-born Jews who immigrated to Chicago as children) and the African American married couple Vivian Carter and Jimmy Bracken who started Vee-Jay were not outsiders. During the 1950s, the stretch of Michigan Avenue that had been home to car dealerships became the epicenter of the city’s record industry. In the late 1950s, Chess moved to 2120 South Michigan Avenue, and Vee-Jay sat nearby at 2129. Vivian Carter had come to know the street well, since she won an Al Benson talent contest and in 1948 hosted a radio show as a prize.82 After working in a millinery shop, during the early 1950s she went back to pursue a career in radio in northwest Indiana.83 When she and Bracken established Vivian’s Record Shop in Gary, they befriended Ewart Abner, who ran a record company. Abner told musicologist Portia Maultsby that he gave the couple the idea of starting their own company and offered to help them, bringing his earlier experience in establishing a label called Chance with Art Sheridan.84 A few years later, Sheridan helped back Vee-Jay.85 Another assist came from a pawnbroker who loaned Vivian and Jimmy $500.86 Still, Butler recalled Abner as the real energy fueling these efforts. He described him as\n\nHallways and Airwaves / 19\n\n“one of the smartest guys who ever went into the record business. He came to the record business with the attitude ‘I want to be big.’ And he did that by recording all types of music.” While the Vee-Jay founders relied on that small network of supporters, they continued to fight inequities. The company struggled to establish its voice in an industry that saw whites in charge of not just the record companies, but also banks, credit agencies, and other firms that make business possible.87 Vee-Jay’s existence encouraged others, according to singer Shirley Wahls, who recorded for the company with the gospel group the Argo Singers. She remembered Vee-Jay as essentially the only significant black business of any kind that she encountered at that time, aside from small retail stores. Nevertheless, these companies were not in the business merely to document and present great art or to build communities. They knowingly entered a system that depended on capital, and resources were not usually dispensed altruistically. Hints abound that Vee-Jay took part in this deviousness. For instance, company executive Calvin Carter’s name appears before that of singer-songwriter James Hudson as the cowriter on the Spaniels’ 1954 hit “Goodnight, Sweetheart, Goodnight.” How much of the song, if any, Carter wrote remains anybody’s guess. Since producers, managers, and radio personalities typically found ways to add their names to compositions as coauthors, Vee-Jay management was engaging in a standard practice. DJ Herb Kent uses harsher words to describe Vee-Jay’s business moves in his 2009 memoir, yet he provides no details about the company’s malfeasance.88 Creative bookkeeping likely was in force at Vee-Jay when Butler, Mayfield, and the rest of the Impressions visited its office, even if there was indeed no tape recorder hidden in a drawer. There’s just no way to put a definitive amount on how much any record company unfairly appropriated from artists. “They probably took advantage of us because we didn’t know any better,” Butler said. “And they didn’t feel that they were hurting us because they were giving us an opportunity to be what we wanted to be. So it was fair exchange.” New technology also shaped those records during the late 1950s, especially at Chicago’s Universal Recording Corporation on the Near North Side. Most of Vee-Jay’s tracks were recorded at Universal, as were thousands of others from companies across the city. Engineer Bruce Swedien, who began at Universal in 1957, discusses these changes in his 2009 memoir, Make Mine Music. Swedien notes that when they began in the studios he and his contemporaries improved the clarity of musical instruments through such ideas as acoustic separation screens. Engineers experimented with placing\n\n20 / Chapter One\n\nmicrophones. The idea was to create a singular recorded sound rather than to duplicate a concert performance. A few engineers, including Swedien, looked into stereo recording that was more sophisticated than just reproducing what emanated from two speakers.89 This was at a time when business media projected a boom in sales of high-fidelity recordings and major companies based in New York also investigated stereo for classical LPs.90 In October 1958 the Chicago Tribune reported, “Industry optimists, anticipating a new billion dollar market, predict that sales of stereo recording equipment, only 100,000 units in 1956, will reach the 725,000 rate by 1960. This would mean a dollar volume of some 300 million dollars.”91 Even so, stereo recording for R&B records in Chicago remained a few years away. As Butler remembered the recording of “For Your Precious Love,” the configuration was simple: the Impressions’ four voices, with accompaniment solely from Mayfield’s guitar, bassist Quinn Wilson, pianist Horace Palm, and drummer Al Duncan. No sweeping orchestrations sweeten the sound. Those recent advances in studio innovation may have contributed to the sharpness of the instrumental section. An unadorned lineup was not uncommon for Vee-Jay sessions. Abner told Maultsby that gospel and blues groups came into the studio with their identifiable sound intact, so he and Calvin Carter would leave them to their work.92 The results supported them. That independence afforded to artists would continue in part because more African Americans in Chicago started their own music firms and obtained executive positions in larger operations. But the key is a sense of mutualism throughout these communities. Vee-Jay, and the Impressions’ record for the company, embodied these essential connections, drawn from such institutions as schools, churches, and radio stations. Musical tastes were evolving, with a new generation growing up at the end of the Great Migration, but the passed-down traditions— jazz, blues, gospel— continued to inform younger artists in the years to come. A big national change in R&B had emerged before all of this occurred. Artists’ and small companies’ hopes of receiving money for public airplay of their works became more attainable with the launch in 1940 of music publisher Broadcast Music, Incorporated (BMI). With BMI, songwriters in previously marginalized idioms such as R&B found a firm likely to be more amenable than the older American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP).93 At that time BMI promised a more equitable fee structure for its members who were played on the radio, as opposed to ASCAP’s paying more to better-known artists.94 Curtis Mayfield and Jerry Butler would become affiliated with BMI.95 This shift may have informed an article about a nationwide trend that received some attention in Chicago. As Hilda See\n\nHallways and Airwaves / 21\n\nwrote in the March 12, 1955, edition of the Chicago Defender, African Americans were achieving wider popularity as composers. She expressed concern about “ofays [whites] who are moving into the field.”96 See did not mention the rise of BMI, although she seemed to be alluding to it with her contention that black songwriters no longer had to be concerned about the dominance of songs from more exclusive Broadway and Hollywood hit factories. But with the wider popularity of traditionally black R&B, See concluded by warning about the potential encroachment of “white writers moving in on a field that began with the Sepians [blacks].”97 Maybe the future Impressions read See’s article. It’s anybody’s guess if her concerns entered the consciousness of black youths like Mayfield and Butler. These young men were just beginning to respond.\n\nT WO\n\nI’m a-Telling You: Artists and Entrepreneurs Step Up in a New Decade Eugene Dixon harmonized beginning in his teen years, singing in Baptist church choirs and then at Englewood High School, where he and Eddie Perrell rehearsed in the hallways with the Gay Tones. Then he joined a group calling themselves the Dukays. They began recording after he left to serve in the US Airborne Rangers. The singer rejoined them after his discharge in 1960, and they cut their mentor Bernice Williams’s “The Girl’s a Devil” on the small Nat label. One day in 1961 Dixon and the Dukays ran through a warmup vocal exercise. Soon enough, this repetition would become recognized around the planet. “I wrote ‘Duke of Earl’ in one of our rehearsals,” said Dixon, famously known as Gene Chandler. “I didn’t write it, I just sort of thought of it. We were actually opening up our throats: do-do-do-do. And so we began to clown around and put harmony to it. I began to put lyrics to it. I know nothing about what was going on in England, but I know I had seen movies in there with dukes and there were earls. There’s no such thing as a duke of earl. There’s an earl of something, a duke of something. I realized all these things later. So they allowed me to continue to put the words to it. My mother came out of the room. She said, ‘When did you all put that together?’ I said, ‘Just now.’ She said, ‘That sounds good.’” By early April 1962, Dixon had taken on the name Gene Chandler, and “Duke of Earl” on Vee-Jay hit the million-sales mark while he was headlining a concert at the Regal.1 Decades later, “Duke of Earl” has lost none of its charm: in the same key and basic chord progressions as “For Your Precious Love,” its infectious melody and confident delivery set a strong direction for soul music. Chandler uses his voice like a saxophonist, his apparent ease never undercutting the song’s inherent drama. With his tenor soaring above a baritone vocal ostinato background, Chandler’s instrumental\n\nI’m a-Telling You / 23\n\nprowess matched the assured attitude he projected. Reformulating British heraldry and proclaiming himself the Duke “nothing can stop,” he fashioned a romantic entreaty that becomes a boast no less than a promise that “no one can hurt you.” “We’ll walk through my dukedom and a paradise we will share,” Chandler sings, pausing momentarily after “dukedom” to emphasize this new word and elongating “share” to suggest no doubt. The song had an impact not unlike that of Muhammad Ali’s bold self-assertions (Chandler and Ali, in fact, were acquaintances). Chandler wore a tuxedo, top hat, and aristocratic monocle in promotional pictures and onstage. He personified this character of the Duke and had fun with it, too. This single by a black artist on a black-owned Chicago record label ruled the pop charts on its own terms. That process of turning a vocal exercise into a hit song depended on collaboration, spontaneity, and confidence. These qualities have informed more than just this tune. Experienced musicians worked in studios with self-taught young performers as the city’s jazz legacy pervaded some of these artists’ records. This spirit also reflected the business side of Chicago’s R&B scene throughout the early to mid-1960s. After “Duke of Earl,” start-up companies looked to capture such success. Some achieved it immediately, others did not. But the energy that fueled this musical hotbed resonates through the wealth of recordings from that era. Emerging media, primarily AM radio station WVON, with its mix of music and social advocacy, expanded the reach of these sounds but also delivered contemporary activists’ messages. The political stakes had also increased, and Chicago’s black artists responded to these changes. Some became directly involved in the growing civil rights movement, others brought out a sense of consciousness through their lyrics. Musicians also fought for their own union’s integration and the better-paying jobs they hoped would result. Even such cheerful musical gatherings as teen dances and record hops came loaded with significance. Movements and fashions became signifiers of identity in a city that frequently made these teens seem invisible. These young black Chicagoans’ steps and styles would affect the world. Chandler’s artistic independence symbolized this movement. He became intertwined with two of the city’s premier record producers, Carl Davis— a former assistant to Al Benson— and Bill “Bunky” Sheppard, who would rise to prominence during the 1960s.2 “Duke of Earl” was recorded initially by Chandler’s group, the Dukays. Member Earl Edwards (the Earl in the title) contributed to the composition along with Bernice Williams.3 Davis approached Vee-Jay with the master of the song, and the label wanted to release it but could not do so as a Dukays record, since the group was signed with\n\n24 / Chapter Two\n\na rival distributor. That’s when Eugene Dixon became Gene Chandler— naming himself after actor Jeff Chandler— and the company issued it under his name alone.4 No one knew how the “Duke of Earl” single would fare. The Dukays held a place for Chandler to return. The song’s rapid ascent under Chandler’s name meant he did not return to the group. By 1960, Abner had formed a partnership with distributors across the country and had firm ideas on how to reach white-oriented radio stations and record buyers. Vee-Jay had built up thirty-two distribution points that Abner said covered “maybe 200 to 300 cities.”5 That network of distributors, independent promotion representatives, and radio station DJs often came down to what Abner called personal relationships. More than twenty years after the release of “Duke of Earl,” he reflected that, on a social level, young music fans clamored for at least one step toward integration. “You know, white kids knowing the black kids’ slang, whether they get it from playing in the playground, or whether they get it from being in school together, you follow me?,” Abner said to Portia Maultsby. “Anyway, they would pick up on the black music. They would call a white station and say, ‘You aren’t playing so-and-so and so.’ And the white station would say, ‘What are you talking about? I don’t have that record.’ ‘Well, you ought to get it.’ Okay, and the white stations are always wanting to compete and be first in their marketplace, those who are daring and smart and innovative are going to get the record and they’ll listen to it.” To be sure, white attempts to adapt, or imitate, black styles in America stretched back more than a hundred years before the rise of Vee-Jay and has continued for decades afterward.6 But a few combined factors make Abner’s observation distinctive. Here an African American– owned music business set itself up to profit from this trend. Also, he describes this company’s using mass media to help shape the identity— as well as the buying power— of large numbers of teenagers (or preadolescents) as opposed to adults. Considering that this audience would have been at a more impressionable age than earlier generations’ cultural consumers, these records would conceivably have made a bigger impact on mass consciousness. Detroit’s Motown— which released its debut single in January 1959— would follow Vee-Jay’s blueprint with phenomenal results.7 Chandler said he was too young to follow Abner’s strategies and philosophy at the time “Duke of Earl” was released. But he admired how Abner pursued a crossover market and traveled to radio stations and record distributors across North America to do it. Using Chicago as an example, Chandler mentions the powerful AM pop station WLS. To approach such a station could be challenging for black artists. “Abner went out and hired\n\nI’m a-Telling You / 25\n\nsome white promotion men to go to stations like WLS and around the country,” Chandler said. “But you had to sell so many records. I think at that time 200,000 from black radio. Then you go to the pop stations and say, ‘Okay. We’ve done 200,000 blah-blah-blah.’ Because at that time, the black radio stations couldn’t even really be heard north of downtown.” Jerry Butler’s break from the Impressions occurred in circumstances similar to his friend Chandler’s experiences. Vee-Jay maneuvered the singer away from the group, putting his name on top when “For Your Precious Love” was released. The company’s stated reasons were commercial: casting individuals as stars made them easier to promote than groups. Butler objected to this placement, as of course did Mayfield, along with the other singers— Samuel Gooden and the brothers Richard and Arthur Brooks.8 The Impressions continued recording and touring for about a year and a half until Butler decided to strike out on his own. By early 1960 the group, dropped from Vee-Jay, went on a hiatus. Butler hired Mayfield as his guitarist. Mayfield had begun writing songs, and four of their composing collaborations appeared on Butler’s 1961 album Aware of Love. According to Butler, Caribbean-influenced pop like Harry Belafonte’s became a key musical inspiration.9 That album also contains the Mayfield and Butler-written “I’m a-Telling You,” which described the tribulations of low-wage employment. It would be Mayfield’s first noteworthy message song. Their friends across Chicago would have connected with the lyrics. A series of recessions between 1957 and 1962 were substantially hard on black workers, since factories had been leaving cities at a faster rate. And while the unemployment rate in Chicago’s Cook and nearby DuPage Counties rose from 2.7 to 6.7 percent from 1957 to 1958, for African Americans it rose from 8.1 to 20.1 percent.10 All this would have added pressure on blacks who were able to obtain factory jobs, such as singer Tyrone Davis, who in the early 1960s was working in a West Side steel foundry and performing on weekends, While race is not overtly mentioned in “I’m a-Telling You,” the a- in its title, signifying a specific dialect, strongly implies a black perspective, as did Butler’s baritone. Nonetheless, the song received airplay among the pop offerings at WLS, according to the station’s “Silver Dollar Survey” list, with at least five weeks of broadcast on the station as of September 16, 1961.11 Mayfield’s melody may have mattered more to that audience than his downcast lyrics. Ironically, the cover of the Aware of Love LP is a photo of a smiling white couple, with a focus on the woman’s blonde ponytail. Such happy white pairs appeared on the cover of a few Vee-Jay albums released that year, including singer Dee Clark’s Hold On . . . It’s Dee Clark. For a black-owned\n\n26 / Chapter Two\n\ncompany whose president Ewart Abner served on the board of the Chicago Urban League, the situation seemed paradoxical, though also typical of the times.12 Financial goals and pop radio airplay trumped realism, since that packaging was an attempt to hide black identities and market to a crossover audience. As Butler explained: “That was in the day when folks said, ‘You’re going to hurt your sales if you put black faces in the record shops.’ Especially the big stores like Marshall Field’s. So some smart executive at the record company decided, ‘We won’t put black faces on the cover of the album. We’ll just make it young white kids singing and the music inside will do the rest.’” But during the early and mid-1960s, Vee-Jay had also treated black music as an international term, a forward-thinking move that has not received the attention given its pop acts. The company was among the first American labels to issue a Jamaican ska album (Mango Jones and Orchestra, The Ska, 1964).13 The year before, Vee-Jay released Africa Calling, an album by the Dungills from the South Side Morgan Park neighborhood, a family orchestra that had performed and taught cross-continental music since the 1940s.14 Still, the emphasis stayed local, with such R&B artists as Betty Everett. A former child Baptist gospel singer from Mississippi, Everett moved to Chicago in 1954 at age fifteen and racked up a handful of hits with VeeJay. One standout, “The Shoop Shoop Song (It’s in His Kiss),” recorded in November 1963, became a top seller and remains a paragon of that era’s girl-group harmonies, even with her name alone as the artist. Her fans in England were equally enthusiastic when she visited in early 1965 to promote the assertive kiss-off “Getting Mighty Crowded.”15 “Betty Everett had a natural tear in her voice,” said Butler, who became her duet partner in the early 1960s. “I used to make a joke that she was the black Dolly Parton. She just had a natural thing in her voice that’s hard to duplicate.” Vee-Jay was also one of the few black-owned companies to release records by prominent white artists such as the Four Seasons. In January 1963 the Beatles became part of the Vee-Jay portfolio after the band’s British label, EMI, received rejections from other American firms for US distribution.16 With Beatlemania sweeping the country the following year, EMI’s American imprint Capitol sued the Chicago company to release the band’s records. Although Vee-Jay lost control of the Beatles after court battles in 1964, more devastating wounds were self-inflicted. For example, management relocated to Los Angeles that year, then turned around and came back to Chicago in 1965.17 During these expensive moves, the federal government placed liens on its products at pressing and plating plants because of unpaid bills.18 Abner’s gambling addiction was also a factor in the company’s\n\nI’m a-Telling You / 27\n\n1966 bankruptcy; he joked thirty years later that he integrated the Las Vegas craps tables.19 This habit did not prevent him from ascending to Motown’s presidency in 1973.20 All of this reaffirms not just the ongoing connections between Chicago and Detroit, but also the accuracy of Butler’s and Chandler’s characterization of Abner’s acumen.\n\nMayfield Rises through New Ventures and Collaborations About 1960, Curtis Mayfield became his own executive. With Eddie Thomas, he formed Curtom Publishing, named after themselves (Curt and Tom). Precedents existed for young African American artists’ controlling their music, notably former Chicagoan Sam Cooke, who began releasing singles on his SAR Records in Los Angeles in 1960.21 But Cooke was a star when he established his own company; Mayfield was in his teens, and Thomas had yet to turn thirty. “The first time I visited Washington, I went to the Library of Congress and asked someone to give me whatever information pertained to music and copyrights,” Mayfield later told journalist Agnes R. Smith. “All I had in my assets column were those little songs I was writing then.”22 Thomas added that they were both improvising. “We were going to the school of hard knocks ourselves, and we were learning,” he said. “We were also learning that the publishing was very important to participate in, in regards to getting some returns. We knew that if we had a piece of our own label, we’d have a little more slice of the pie than just being artists on somebody else’s label.” The Impressions had also reconvened, and after tireless roadwork and Thomas’s promotional efforts, Mayfield’s evocative, flamenco-influenced “Gypsy Woman” became a hit single in September 1961 for the ABCParamount label, reaching number twenty pop and number two R&B.23 The record also served as an early sample of his particular style of guitar playing. The Chicago pop radio station, WLS, was slow to pick up on it. Instead, Thomas managed to build up the approach among friendly DJs in Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York. Shortly afterward, Richard and Arthur Brooks left, but the group thrived with Mayfield, Samuel Gooden continuing as bass voice, and Fred Cash as tenor. Other Chicago artists and executives soon shared national attention. The same October 16, 1961, issue of Billboard that noted that the Impressions’ “Gypsy Woman” was a hit in Philadelphia included an article about the rise of Granville White, the national field promotion manager for Columbia Records.24 In Chicago, big band veteran Riley Hampton had established himself as the main arranger for R&B sessions. Among others, he produced\n\n28 / Chapter Two\n\nJackie Ross, who had a hit in 1964 with “Selfish One” on Chess. The song frames Ross’s quietly expressive voice with an assemblage of strings, brass, and handclaps for punctuation. Ross remembers that Hampton’s charts inspired her to think about studying score writing. But Hampton was not the only vital arranger at this time. Jazz bassist Johnny Pate became his main rival. Pate had played bass in clubs in Chicago and in New York since his discharge from the army at the end of World War II. He also arranged for singers such as Joe Williams, who performed at the Club DeLisa on the South Side. The GI Bill funded Pate’s musical studies at the Midwestern Conservatory downtown. His trio recorded and worked regularly at venues like the upscale London House. With a family to support, Pate started to emphasize arranging, since that job paid better than performing. His compositions also appeared on such albums as saxophonist James Moody’s Last Train from Overbrook in 1958. Carl Davis approached Pate about arranging for him, and while Hampton may have been chagrined about sharing jobs, he was not in a position to block this move. Soon Mayfield asked Pate to work on his own recordings and on compositions he had written for other artists. One of the first was “Monkey Time,” released by Okeh in 1963, a dance tune featuring twenty-two-yearold former boxer Major Lance. The Impressions served as backup vocalists, amplifying and engaging in call-and-response with the leader and other singers while the horns suffused the multilayered sound with emphatic fills. Possibly, Pate’s expertise in the bass clef solidified its pronounced trombone part. Carl Davis, who started working for the Columbia imprint Okeh in the middle of 1962, was the producer.25 Here Davis announced that he would build a “Chicago sound” based on Mayfield’s writing and coproduction. They would sign new, locally based, acts rather than luring established singers from other companies.26 Pate’s brawny and percussive horn lines blended with the joy of Mayfield’s composing to become the template. Although Pate had enjoyed being his own boss as an artist and playing jazz, he came to believe he could add his technique and improvisational experience to pop. “Naturally, I’m a jazz bass player, and jazz is where my heart is,” Pate said. ABC-Paramount decided to hire me. Once I did the first date for the Impressions, they said, “We never sold Impressions albums like [we] sold these.” I was really producing. They said, “We want to hire you as an in house arranger, but we want you as an exclusive.” So I agreed, would get a salary and benefits. I was doing the R&B dates, and I would have them bring me a rough tape of the basic tune— a rough structure, which Curtis would do. I would build the\n\nI’m a-Telling You / 29 arrangement around that. There wasn’t a whole lot of head dictating. How do you go in there? You’ve got a three-hour session and dictate? It didn’t quite work that way. I would take whatever they had and try to do an arrangement. A lot of that, I would change keys to keep it from getting monotonous.\n\nFor Pate, working with Mayfield posed another challenge. Mayfield tuned his guitar in F-sharp, an approach that came about while he was growing up self-taught and had his strings correspond to the black keys on his mother’s piano.27 Pate’s experiences in jazz jam sessions and conservatory training proved to be the ideal musical complement to Mayfield’s autodidact background. When I learned to write, I learned according to intervals. In other words, a major scale is a simple thing. If you do it on the piano, you do a whole step, a whole step, a half step, a whole step, a whole step, a whole step, and another half step. OK, that’s a major scale. Now, if you know where the fifth is in the key of C and you’re using the interval system, you’ll know where the fifth is in the key of B-flat. Or you’ll know where the seventh is going to be. That’s the way I write. The voicings that I use when I’m writing, after all these years, I don’t use too many voicings. So if I know that much about it, I can continue to write no matter how it sounds. Curtis Mayfield did not tune the guitar the conventional way. I don’t know what system it was, but most of the tunes he wrote were written in the key of G-flat or F-sharp or B-natural. These are keys that the average musician doesn’t want to have to deal with because there are too many sharps and flats. But this is the way Curtis tuned his guitar. That’s how he wrote, and that’s how he sang. When I started working with him, I had no problem because I was dealing with the interval system, so an F-sharp could be no different than a C. F-sharp is the root and then there is no problem at all, you know where C-sharp is naturally going to be the fifth. You do it interval-wise. I’ve never had any problems with any singers if they want to do it in some odd key. Real musicians have no problems with strange keys.\n\nMayfield concurred when he spoke to journalist Sue Cassidy Clark in 1968. “Well, usually through most of my own original things have basic ideas and thoughts in terms of little interludes that I hear some of the instruments doing,” Mayfield said to Clark. “Therefore I dictate these things to Mr. Johnny Pate. And he with his own way of bringing things about, comes up with beautiful things, there’s a great collaboration there.”28 “People Get Ready” remains a highlight of the Mayfield-Pate synergy. Recorded in January 1965, the song reached number three on the national\n\n30 / Chapter Two\n\nR&B charts, number fourteen pop, and reflected the songwriter’s spiritual emphasis in vivid colors.29 Its image of a train leaving for a higher place would have had special resonance for migrants and their children who had come up to Chicago from the South. The lyrics’ relevance to the churchinspired civil rights movement has frequently been discussed.30 But along with these words, the melody, paradoxically both languid and momentous, and the sweeping orchestration’s emphasis on strings would offer inspiration to contrasting groups of local activists. In August of that year, five hundred advocates for open housing in the high-end North Shore suburbs sang a version with their own verses advocating integration as they marched through Winnetka, historically exclusive Kenilworth, Wilmette, and Evanston.31 About four years later, supporters of jailed West Side– based Illinois Black Panther Party chairman Fred Hampton sang their version of the tune at a rally. Their lyrics demanded Hampton’s freedom and urged listeners to prepare for a revolution.32\n\nShared Goals, Different Methods in the Civil Rights Era Even though Mayfield’s songs helped energize the civil rights movement, Chicago R&B artists were rarely featured performers at the large rallies in the city during the early and mid-1960s.33 Mitty Collier, for instance, remembered singing at the movement’s programs in Birmingham, Alabama, but not in the North— even though she lived on the South Side and recorded for Chess. Nobody recalled why these artists with local ties and youth appeal had not been included at the campaign’s major events within this city. Historian Brian Ward suggests that, on a national level, civil rights organizations had class biases and strategic complications that hindered them from coming up with a plan to feature soul stars as morale boosters.34 While friction existed among Martin Luther King’s Southern Christian Leadership Conference, Chicago ministers, and regional politicians, none of these disputes had a direct influence on young singers and musicians. Some of these musicians did aid the freedom movement behind the scenes. Butler donated funds for the August 28, 1963, March on Washington. Others chose divergent paths. For Chuck Barksdale that included advocating for black pride and self-discipline as a member in the Nation of Islam and selling copies of the Muhammad Speaks newspaper on the South Side with Muhammad Ali. Gene Chandler, who knew King, believed his own temperament prevented him from taking a visible role in any of the marches. Considering that he was just a few years away from his teenage gang, this may not have been surprising.\n\nI’m a-Telling You / 31\n\n“I was one of those guys who didn’t feel like I could take any licks, any punishment,” Chandler said. “I would fight back. I was not nonviolent. So I remember we were going to march somewhere. Not here, somewhere else. And I told Martin, I said, ‘Martin, I’m not sure whether I’ll be able to take somebody spitting on me or hitting me with something from the sidelines.’ He said, ‘Well, Gene, I want you to be up front with us. But it’s best that you get back to the middle or somewhere else because it’s got to be nonviolent. You cannot retaliate.’ And so that was the extent of my involvement. I couldn’t march up front.” The movement also informed a music industry labor struggle as Chicago artists pushed to integrate the two American Federation of Musicians (AFM) unions. Since the 1930s, members of the black Local 208 had advocated merging with the larger white Local 10.35 Those calls increased beginning in the 1940s and into the early 1960s. Throughout those years, financial stakes had become greater. In 1962 the Chicago Tribune reported that this city had become a “center or a hotbed of freelance composers of singing commercials.”36 Six downtown agencies dominated that field. The AFM controlled who got those remunerative advertising jobs, and its racial bias was clear.37 AFM member Pate contested the status quo. “[Local 10 was] one of the richest local unions in America.” Pate recalled. “When I got out of the service in 1946, it was very seldom that you saw a black player on a jingle date. I wasn’t one who was afraid to make a fuss, so I did a little screaming. Sometimes I would be the only black in the studio.” But Pate stood apart from some older black musicians like Captain Walter Dyett, who feared that integration would be counterproductive to building enduring black institutions such as fraternal societies.38 These veterans maintained that self-sufficiency among African American artists remained key. Younger activists like flutist and educator James Mack disagreed and emphasized the benefits that would come with integration. Mack alluded to the Emancipation Proclamation centennial in 1963 in pamphlets rallying union members to the cause.39 His view carried the day: on January 11, 1966, the AFM at last decreed that “every member of Local 10 and Local 208 shall enjoy and be entitled to equal rights, privileges and benefits in the merged union.”40 The launch of radio station WVON on April 1, 1963, inaugurated another confluence of music and community engagement with call letters standing for “Voice of the Negro.” The idea for such an outlet with those same call letters went back at least to the late 1940s. Two ministers had initially proposed the black-owned operation about 1948, but they wound up squabbling viciously with each other.41 Leonard and Phil Chess bought a station\n\n32 / Chapter Two\n\nat 1450 on the AM dial from L&P Broadcasting, which had run foreignlanguage programming. The new endeavor opened its offices and studios at 3350 South Kedzie Avenue, and some of its initial on-air hosts included Al Benson, E. Rodney Jones, Pervis Spann, and Bernadine C. Washington, who served as a fashion consultant and commentator. Benson remained at the station for less than a month, saying he wanted to refocus on his ministry, but his presence at the company’s inception furnished a link to his earlier broadcast work and activism. On WVON music, commerce, and politics intermingled. Its playlists of black artists constituted an end run around the dominant pop stations. The Chicago Defender greeted WVON’s launch with an article stating, “A new 24-hour-a-day radio station— with an eye on the lucrative Negro market and its emphasis on music, news around the clock and an aggressive public service program— makes its debut in Chicago.”42 WVON quickly succeeded, so much so that Jones felt confident enough to cut self-mocking promo spots, including one with Nat King Cole claiming he’d never heard of the station (to which Billboard responded, “Our guess is he will”).43 Within four months the Defender reported that WVON was beating its rival WYNR in the C. E. Hooper ratings for radio by a count of 17.1 to 14.9 in the morning and 27.2 to 20.9 in the afternoon. The newspaper commended young DJ Herb Kent’s pop and nostalgic “favorites of yester-year” format along with Spann’s “colorful” language, which echoed Benson’s initial appeal.44 By March 1964, Billboard marveled that WVON had moved from sixth to second place in the city’s music ratings— all while the black-oriented station had only 1,000 watts of broadcast power versus first-place WLS’s 50,000 watts.45 Ingenuity boosted its signal: although its Federal Communications Commission Class Four frequency was the lowest wattage the agency would grant, some unlicensed engineers amplified its range by an unspecified amount. These included Bill “Butterball” Crane, a technician-DJ, and teenager Larry Langford, who somehow eluded authorities’ detection.46 The dichotomy between black on-air voices and white ownership did rankle some people. In Nadine Cohodas’s book about Chess, Spinning Blues into Gold, she writes that program director E. Rodney Jones believed the top executives knew little about the South and West Sides.47 On the other hand, Cohodas also submits that Leonard Chess felt that white upper management made the station more appealing to bigger advertisers.48 Still, within Chicago in the early and mid-1960s there was no mention of protest against WVON’s upper management in such black media outlets as the Chicago Defender. Forty years later Spann expressed discontent not so much with the\n\nI’m a-Telling You / 33\n\nChess brothers as with racist southern congressmen who he said pressured the Federal Communications Commission into not allowing black ownership of radio stations.49 Also, at the time of its inception, few could have imagined the station’s long-term influence. On the street, money continued to change hands in exchange for radio airplay, just as it always had, no matter what the station format. Exact amounts varied, as one source mentioned during an interview.50 Another Chicago-based singer asserted that he could use the system to his advantage across the country, although he added that not everyone was so fortunate.51 “They call it payola, but it was pretty hip,” the singer said. “But then again, it was friendship. Who are you friends with? Well, the program director is a good friend of mine, and I could ask him for a favor. In Chicago it was E. Rodney Jones, in Detroit it was Al Perkins, in Philadelphia it was Georgie Woods. So what I could do is, beginning on Tuesday so they could program my records on Friday, I would hit in all these major cities. There were guys going broke because they couldn’t afford to keep up.” While the WVON staff and ownership’s profit motives were front and center, the station also engaged the community in ways that were not purely commercial. The Chicago Urban League’s Sherwood Ross hosted a weekly spot called “Current” to discuss racial issues.52 In May 1963 the station donated $2,000 to the Southern Christian Leadership Conference to help assist black demonstrators who were arrested in Birmingham, Alabama.53 WVON’s efforts to help the movement also became physically exhaustive: in December the station conducted a lengthy radiothon intended to add twenty thousand new members to the rolls of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Martin Luther King publicly acknowledged that WVON raised money for the 1964 Mississippi Freedom Summer.54 That the station remained linked with the movement in the South reaffirmed the connections forged during the Great Migration. Not everyone appreciated these efforts. For example, James Allen wrote to the Chicago Defender railing against the “vulgar” playlists on WVON and WYNR: “In a successful union of the theory and practice the owners of these obnoxious stations have managed to corner the market of radio listeners by giving them a steady, heavy diet of militant pro-integrationist propaganda— as if the civil rights issue was simple and existed in a vacuum and a similar dose of the cheap, crude music which sells best to Negroes.”55 Allen’s race is unknown (although few readers of the Defender were not African American); but, either way, it serves as a reminder that activist fervor remained far from universal.\n\n34 / Chapter Two\n\nModern Operators Guide Musical Changes Notwithstanding its specious politics, Allen’s complaint regarding changing musical values points to shifts that actually had occurred. A growing generation of African Americans kept developing music that they could call their own, that was not just a continuation of their parents’ preferences. Radio airwaves also soared over physical and language barriers.56 Syl Johnson epitomized the transition from blues to R&B. Johnson, who was born in Mississippi in 1936, moved to Chicago with his family at age fourteen.57 Within a couple of years he was playing guitar and harmonica for such South Side bluesmen as James “Shakey Jake” Harris. Yet he departed from the familiar twelve-bar and sixteen-bar blues progressions in April 1959 when he recorded “Teardrops” at Universal Recording. The song, which Johnson wrote with Howard Scott, is a pop ballad; King Records tacked on a light chorus, maybe to distract from the lead singer’s southern inflections. Overall, it’s the sound of a twenty-three-year-old Chicagoan transitioning in style and claiming his own legacy. “That was blues all right— but say you’re Mr. [Henry] Ford,” Johnson said, Ford Motors’ son comes along, makes the Navigator with power windows, power doors. So I’m extending what the older people did. And it came with rhythm; that’s why they named it rhythm and blues. We dealt with the beat, different changes. Blues was I, IV, back to I [progressions]. When we could know how to read notes and make chords, we discovered that we could hear gospel; gospel had other chords in it. So we blended gospel and some jazz chords in there, and I know I kept the blues in my sound. I just didn’t play the simple I, IV, V, the simple changes. And the people love it. ‘Teardrops’ is not blues, that’s calypso, cha-cha with a funky beat. That’s the way I wanted to do it when I started playing, and that was in 1959 when I made my first record. I was hearing it all in my soul, heart, and mind.\n\nFor a few years Johnson drifted among independent record companies, including Cincinnati-based King’s Federal imprint, which also had an office on Chicago’s Record Row. He was far from alone. This was a heady time for small-scale music entrepreneurs in Chicago, whose owners, Robert Pruter observes, “usually got into the business as a sideline to their main enterprises— insurance, coal, construction, whatever.”58 Pruter counts at least twenty-two R&B labels from this period spread across the city and suburbs. That “whatever” turned out to be considerably broad. Early in the 1960s, a raconteur named Arrow Brown devised Bandit Records: by the end\n\nI’m a-Telling You / 35\n\nof the decade it had apparently become financed through the illicit earnings of women who lived with him in a Bronzeville graystone.59 Whether or not these ventures were profitable, their results sometimes endured in unexpected ways, such as in the bidding wars of collectors.60 Individual talents and the odd cheerfulness of, say, Bandit’s youthful Majestic Arrows group did not require huge recording budgets. Chicago also had a number of wholesale stores and independent truckers that became known as one-stops. These benefited small-scale R&B operations that needed an alternative to major distributors and retailers who were not eager to extend lines of credit to start-ups. When record seller and future songwriter Jack Daniels got out of the navy in 1959, he helped his brotherin-law Willie J. Barney set up his own kind of distributor, Barney’s One-Stop. Soon they expanded to three locations, along with a wholesaler with record racks in his truck. This kind of underground economy burgeoned outside the notice of the Billboard chart compilers. “The term ‘one-stop’ came from the fact that a lot of small record stores, you buy wholesale records from the distributors down on Record Row,” Daniels said. “All State, United, Liberty, MS, Garmisa, all sold or distributed certain artists, records by certain artists, certain labels. And you would have to go by each one of them and pick up your list of records that you needed to sell. They could come by Barney’s and get everything at the One-Stop. That’s how, that’s why they became one-stops. You could get it all right there.” This kind of cottage industry refuted an editorial in the June 1961 issue of Ebony claiming that African Americans had not become sufficiently entrepreneurial. Ironically, the magazine’s office at Johnson Publications, 1820 South Michigan Avenue, was practically next door to the heart of Record Row. The article, headlined “The Need to Produce,” argued that while there had been a slew of black doctors, scientists, and labor leaders, “the Negro is mad at himself for not making the commercial grade.”61 After acknowledging that African Americans were regularly denied access to capital from lending institutions and excluded from business organizations, the article argues for collective action and asks government organizations for government agencies. Its unnamed author concludes, “Surely, a people that can convert its consumer power into a weapon so potent that it desegregates lunch counters in Dixie can develop its producing power regardless of economic detours.”62 But plucky music entrepreneurs also knew that they presented a risky investment by the very nature of their business, so why approach traditional lines of capital in the first place? Conceivably, at that time class differences also separated the aspirations of Ebony editorial writers from many of the underground characters who tend to thrive in the music industry.\n\n36 / Chapter Two\n\nFor some of these tiny operations, low overhead shaped the sound of their products throughout the 1960s. One of these was Down to Earth Records, which Walter Gardner owned with his trumpeter brother Burgess Gardner. One of its singles, General Crook’s “Gimme Some (Parts I and II)” from 1970, is a stripped-down guitar-driven funk track that the singer came up with spontaneously late one night while returning home after visiting a girlfriend. The small-scale operation meant that a recording could be made almost instantly. “We had such a good relationship because there was nobody in between us,” Crook said. “You know, I would write the tune, call Burgess up and go out to his house. And we’d put it together and go in the studio and record it.” Syl Johnson recorded a few tracks at One-derful, which became one of the most notable black-owned record companies to emerge in Chicago in the early 1960s. Ernie and George Leaner entered the business by starting at the Groove Record Store in the 1940s. They moved into distribution when they formed United in March 1950. In 1962 the Leaners positioned themselves vertically by setting up the One-derful company on Record Row, about one block south of Johnson Publications. Their connection to their uncle, media giant Al Benson, helped. Like Vee-Jay, the Leaners’ operation encouraged flexibility. They could respond quickly to what was happening in popular music, as they did early on with the high-energy dance hit by the Five Du-Tones, “Shake a Tail Feather.” The Leaners also owned imprints that specialized in R&B (Midas), blues (M-Pac!), dance music (Mar-V-Lus), early funk (Toddlin’ Town), and gospel (Halo). Singer Otis Clay, who recorded “I Don’t Know What to Do” for One-derful, said the company allowed its artists to just be themselves. That song, for instance, encapsulated his roots in driving rural gospel yet recast it all in pleading to a more earthly companion. “One-derful had its own studio,” Clay said. “You had that opportunity to write songs; we were putting them together.
