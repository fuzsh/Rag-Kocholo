        "text": "Curtis Mayfield\n\n“Our purpose is to educate as well as to entertain.“\n\nName: Curtis Mayfield\n\nBorn: June 3, 1942\n\nDied: December 26, 1999 (age 57)\n\nFrom: Chicago, Illinois\n\nOccupation: Musician\n\nAwards: Soul Train Music Award (1997), Rhythm and Blues Foundation Pioneer Award (1991), Grammy Legend Award (1995), Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award (1995), Grammy Hall of Fame (1998)\n\nFun Fact: Mayfield’s most popular project was his soundtrack for the movie “Superfly”. This soundtrack dealt with the glorification of pimps and drug dealers, and how they shouldn’t be praised in the media. He went on to record many other soundtracks for other movies.\n\nCurtis Mayfield was an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, and record producer, as well as one of the most influential musicians behind soul and politically conscious African-American music. His first group, The Impressions, gained their fame during the Civil Rights Movements of the 50s and 60s. Many of those songs dealt with social injustices and the black pride movement. As a solo artist, Mayfield gained success in his soundtrack to the movie “Superfly”. The soundtrack was noted for its socially conscious themes, mostly addressing problems surrounding inner city minorities such as crime, poverty and drug abuse.\n\nHandout\n\nTo download the Handout:\n\nClick on the image\n\nRight-click and select Save Image As…\n\nPrint\n\nWrite a description on the line and decorate.\n\nCut out and use for a selfie to share on our social media page.\n\nDownload a card and envelope template and write about an idea this leader inspires.\n\nCheck out more resources and ways to celebrate MLK can be found on these links as well as our official Day of Service opportunity to volunteer.\n\nThis ASI Special event is an ongoing volunteer-led project made by people like you, using multiple educational sources regularly being revised and updated.
