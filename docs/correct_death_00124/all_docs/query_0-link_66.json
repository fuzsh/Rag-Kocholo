        "text": "April 12, 1932 - November 30, 1996\n\nTiny Tim, known for his quirky ukulele rendition of \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips,\" died after suffering a heart attack onstage at the age of 64.\n\nBorn in Manhattan as Herbert Butros Khaury, he exhibited an early interest in music, spending much of his free time exploring the sheet music archives at the New York City Public Library. At age 11, he began playing the violin, and later the mandolin and ukulele, which became his signature instrument. He started performing at dance club amateur nights under different names, such as Texarkana Tex, Judas K. Foxglove, Vernon Castle, and Emmett Swink. To stand out from the crowd of performers he wore wild clothing and, after seeing an old poster of a long-haired Rudolph Valentino, grew his own hair out to shoulder length and wore pasty white facial makeup.\n\nIn 1963, he landed his first paying gig at Page 3, a gay and lesbian club in Greenwich Village, playing 6 hours a night, 6 nights a week, for $96 per month. He performed for the next two years as \"Dary Dover\", and after that, \"Sir Timothy Timms\". After being booked to follow a \"midget\" act, his manager, George King, billed the 6'1\" Khaury using the ironic stage name \"Tiny Tim\". The name stuck.\n\nHis first of many television appearances was on Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In, a popular American television comedy-variety show. The singer entered carrying a shopping bag, pulled his Martin soprano ukulele from it, and sang a medley of \"A Tisket A Tasket\" and \"On The Good Ship Lollipop.\" He reappeared and sang a third song, his signature \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips.\"\n\nIn 1968, his first album God Bless Tiny Tim was released. It contained an orchestrated version of \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips,\" a popular song first published in 1929. Tiny Tim's recording of the song became a hit after being released as a single. This was followed by 1969's For All My Little Friends, a collection of children's songs that was nominated for a Grammy Award.\n\nHe married Vicki Budinger (\"Miss Vicki\") on Johnny CarsonÂ’s Tonight Show on December 17, 1969, before an audience of 40 million viewers. They had a daughter, Tulip Victoria, before they divorced.\n\nAfter his career highlights in the late 1960s, Tiny Tim's television appearances dwindled, and his popularity began to wane. He continued to play concerts around the United States, making several lucrative appearances in Las Vegas. When his recording contract ended with Reprise, he founded his own record label and humorously named it Vic Tim Records, as a pun on the combination of his wife's name with that of his own.\n\nHe performed with the American alternative rock band Camper Van Beethoven in 1986.\n\nOn September 28, 1996, Tiny suffered a heart attack just as he began singing at a ukulele festival at the Montague Grange Hall in Montague, Massachusetts. Doctors advised that he quit performing, but he ignored the advice.\n\nOn November 30, 1996, he was playing at a gala benefit hosted by the Women's Club of Minneapolis. He had let his third wife (\"Miss Sue\") know before the show that he was not feeling well, but did not want to disappoint the fans. While performing his last number of the evening, he suffered another heart attack on stage in the middle of a rendition of his hit, \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\". His wife was helping him back to their table when he collapsed, and never regained consciousness. His remains are entombed in a mausoleum in Lakewood Cemetery in Minneapolis.\n\n11/02/199633Eva Cassidyfolk singerCancerBowie, Maryland 10/17/199630Chris AclandLush, drummerSuicide (hanging)Burneside, England 09/13/199625Tupac ShakurrapperMurderedLas Vegas, Nevada"
