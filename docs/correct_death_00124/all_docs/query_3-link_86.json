Inspired by iconic tunes like ‘Are You Man Enough?’ from The Four Tops and the theme to ‘Shaft,’ the single weaves the historical richness of the Muscle Shoals sound with Bonneville’s contemporary creative flair. Jeff Hayashi, Bonneville guitarist and co-songwriter, describes “The Chase” as “a soundtrack to the most thrilling car chase you never saw on screen.” This track is not just a nod to the past but a vibrant reimagining of it, designed to transport listeners right into the heart of a 1970s film chase scene.

The GRAMMY®, ACM, and CMA-winning group Shenandoah have achieved their first No. 1 in three decades with the captivating rendition of “Two Dozen Roses,” featuring the reigning CMA Entertainer of the Year, Luke Combs. Released by FAME Records / 8 Track Entertainment, this dynamic collaboration has already surpassed one million streams, leading the iTunes All Genre and Country charts. Stream and download here: https://music.apple.com/us/album/two-dozen-roses/1704896186.\n\nShenandoah’s frontman Marty Raybon adds a contemporary spin to the classic while still delivering the signature sound that shaped ’80s and ’90s country music. Raybon’s passion blends seamlessly with Combs’ voice, creating a bridge between two eras of country greatness. As a testament to the song’s enduring appeal, Luke Combs has been treating his fans to this classic, originally released by Shenandoah in 1989 as the fourth single from their album “The Road Not Taken.” It became their third number-one hit in both the United States and Canada.\n\nFAME Recording Studios takes immense pride in having been the studio where “Two Dozen Roses” was first recorded, and today, where its reimagined version was brought to life. FAME’s doors have long been a home to Shenandoah’s founding members, Marty Raybon and Mike McGuire. The GRAMMY® winning engineer, Noah Gordon, who oversaw the production of this historic track, chose to revisit the original ambiance of FAME, preserving and elevating its timeless essence.\n\n“FAME Recording Studios isn’t just a place; it’s a living, breathing testament to music history. We’re honored to once again be the canvas upon which Shenandoah paints their musical legacy, and with the unparalleled expertise of Noah Gordon, ‘Two Dozen Roses’ has been reborn with the soul and spirit that only FAME can offer,” said Rodney Hall, Co-Owner and President of FAME Publishing/FAME Records/FAME Recording Studios. “From Marty Raybon to Mike McGuire, our legacy is intertwined with theirs, and this reimagined track further cements our shared journey in music.”\n\nBillboard’s Jessica Nicholson aptly described the collaboration, stating, “As collaborations and interpolations of classic hits increase in the country music genre, an iconic ’90s country group and one of country music’s current biggest stars are teaming up to refresh a ’90s country classic.”\n\nFollowing closely on the heels of Shenandoah’s acclaimed 2020 album, “Every Road,” which showcased a multitude of country stars, this new No. 1 further seals their legacy in country music. As FAME Recording Studios moves forward, we are committed to being the torchbearers of authentic music, continually weaving the past’s rich tapestry with the vibrant threads of the present.\n\nFAME Recording Studios extends heartfelt congratulations to Shenandoah, Luke Combs, and all the creatives behind “Two Dozen Roses.” As we celebrate this No. 1, we are reminded that, at FAME, legacies are not just remembered; they are continually reborn.\n\nABOUT FAME:\n\nFAME Music was established in 1959 in Florence, Ala., and moved to Muscle Shoals, Ala., in 1961, where it became the indisputable heartbeat of the iconic Muscle Shoals Sound.

The mood of the song shifts from a sense of longing to a celebration of love found. Lead vocalist Wes McGee describes the track as “definitely one of the more funky ‘bop your head’ tracks, something you’d want to listen to on a road trip to Vegas.” The song was conceived ‘on a whim’ during a session at FAME, according to band member Jeff Hayashi, who drew inspiration from non-standard open tuning popularized by Jimmy Page to create its unique musical texture.\n\nTo do justice to the emotional and musical complexity of the track, FAME employed the cutting-edge ribbon microphones from Royer Labs. GRAMMY®-recognized producer, Starita drew upon his long standing relationship with Royer Labs and FAME to spearhead this collaboration. “When he called us about an all-Royer recording of Bonneville at FAME Studios, we were all in,” says John Jennings, VP of Sales & Marketing at Royer Labs. Starita shares, “One thing I love about working with Bonneville is that they’re not afraid to access new tools to achieve their vision. For us to record this song with all ribbon microphones is not usually done. With that many ribbon mics live in a room, I would typically expect to have a mess given that ribbons pick up sound from the front and back of the mic.” FAME’s engineer, Wes Sheffield, also noted that the microphones were a game-changer in capturing the rich and authentic sound that Muscle Shoals is renowned for. “When we pulled up the faders, the sound was so natural and full-bodied; it was as if you were right there in the room with each instrument, experiencing the legendary atmosphere of FAME firsthand,” Sheffield said.\n\nAs FAME Recording Studios celebrates its 60th anniversary, its impact on the world of music is undeniable. Established in Florence, Alabama in 1959 and moved to Muscle Shoals in 1961, FAME has been a crucial part of the careers of iconic artists such as Aretha Franklin, Wilson Pickett, Alicia Keys, Jason Isbell, and Etta James. Over the years, FAME has also been involved in the recording and/or publishing of records that have sold more than 400 million copies globally.\n\nThe partnership with Royer Labs comes at a pivotal moment, adding another layer to FAME’s storied history and resonating perfectly with Bonneville’s adventurous spirit and respect for musical heritage. The collaboration also exemplifies Bonneville’s ongoing relationship with\n\nMississippi-born producer Starita, who is well-known for his genre-blending approach to music production.\n\nThe single “Undercover Woman” promises to be a milestone in capturing the essence of the Muscle Shoals sound, while also showcasing the artistic dynamism of Bonneville. The song will be available across all digital service providers on October 4th, 2023. For a complete list of Bonneville’s upcoming performances and other events, please visit bonnevilleofficial.com.

Co-written and co-produced by Moore and Jaren Johnston (The Cadillac Three), the thirteen track collection is emotionally raw and thick with epiphany. Moore’s DAMN LOVE WORLD TOUR will kick off in Bloomsbury, Aus. on 3/11. Moore is slated to headline shows in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, The U.K. and Europe, many of which are already sold-out in advance. Known as “one of country’s more thoughtful artists” (Billboard), Moore has toured the world earning acclaim and a rabid fanbase as an all-in performer in each setting, consistently selling out headlining shows internationally with huge followings in The U.S, The U.K, Europe, Australia and Canada. Praised by Noisey as “an uncompromising, genre-defying artist firing on all cylinders” Moore has blazed his own trail, with “a bit more Southern rock than traditional country… to be a Kip Moore fan suddenly became a marker of your having a certain refinement in your country-music taste” (Chicago Tribune). Moore first splashed into the mainstream with the double-PLATINUM “Somethin’ ‘Bout a Truck” in 2012, then followed up with three more best selling No. Ones (“Hey Pretty Girl,” “Beer Money” and “More Girls Like You”), a trio of ambitious, critically-praised albums and two gritty EPs that landed Moore on multiple “Best Of” lists. Moore garnered resounding acclaim for his fourth studio album, WILD WORLD. The set, co-written and co-produced by Moore, was spotlighted by critics as “especially vital; occasionally, even rare,” (Esquire).

Isbell believes his Alabaman heritage greatly impacted his development as a musician saying, “I definitely don’t feel like I would be the musician that I am, or the type of songwriter, had I not come from that particular place.”\n\nHe put his heart and soul into playing music and performed at the Grand Ole Opry at the tender age of 16, Just five years later, he received a publishing deal with Rodney & Mark Hall as the first new writer of their recently acquired FAME Publishing company, beginning a fifteen year relationship that includes recording and writing as a member of The Drive-By Truckers on their albums Decorations Day, Dirty South, Blessing and a Curse as well as his solo albums Sirens of the Ditch, Jason Isbell & the 400 Unit, Here We Rest, and Southeastern. Jason has also produced at FAME on the Blind Boys of Alabama track “Christmas in Dixie,” as well as a duet with John Paul White on “Old Flame”. Both of which were included on a tribute to the country supergroup Alabama. Jason and John Paul White were featured on a track with Candi Staton for the album Muscle Shoals-Small Town Big Sound”. The track would go on to be one of legendary producer Rick Hall’s final final productions. Isbell has said that working at FAME Studios meant everything to him, that it was a gateway towards the music that he wanted to play.\n\nThe name of his GRAMMY® winning band The 400 Unit is also deeply rooted in his time in Alabama. The 400 Unit is the name of a mental treatment facility in Florence, Alabama. As Isbell tells it, “About once a week they would drive downtown and take, I guess, the six or eight healthiest people in the facility and let ’em go downtown. Give ’em all like $15 apiece to go get some lunch. You’d immediately recognize who it was and why they were there; they all had nametags on, saying kinda strange stuff to everybody. And trying to get a sandwich at the same time,” adding, “When I started thinking about a band, and how we get to a new town and everybody gets $15 and gets out of the van, goes out and tries to get a sandwich, it kinda reminded me of that.” Both bassist Jimbo Hart and drummer Chad Gamble are Shoals area natives and have done a lot of studio session work at FAME outside of the 400 Unit over the last 20 years.\n\nIn addition to his four GRAMMY®s, Isbell has won nine Americana Music Honors and Awards and was the Country Music Hall-of-Fame Artist in Residence for 2017. He has also seen success across multiple genres as his album Something More Than Free debuted at number 1 on Billboard Magazine’s rock, folk and country record charts. Something More Than Free, Southeastern, and The Nashville Sound (with The 400 Unit) have sold nearly 150,000 copies each, with Southeastern being his most recently recorded album at Fame Studios. For The Nashville Sound (with The 400 Unit), Isbell garnered four peak chart positions in the United States and eight top-40 peak chart positions in Australia, Canada, Denmark, New Zealand, Norway, Scotland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.\n\nIsbell is married to fellow Americana superstar Amanda Shires, co-founder of the Highwomen, and the two share a daughter together. He is an avid player and collector of guitars. He believes a special guitar “…is one that fulfills its purpose in design,” and discussed some of his vintage guitars with Guitar World in 2020. He currently owns roughly 50 to 60 guitars including a ’53 Les Paul gold top, a ’59 ‘burst dubbed “Red Eye” that once belonged to Lynyrd Skynyrd’s Ed King, a ’65 Tele, a ’60 Strat, a ’61 ES-335, a Gretsch White Falcon given to him by John Prine, a mid-50s Martin D-18, and more in his collection.\n\nOutside of his musical career, Isbell has also seen success in acting with his first role being in 2016 providing the voice for pastor Kyle Nubbins in the animated television series Squidbillies. In 2021, Isbell earned his biggest role in the upcoming Martin Scorsese film Killers of the Flower Moon.\n\nIn 2019, Jason along with his manager, Traci Thomas gave the Shoals some love and launched their music festival, Shoalsfest. The festival has hosted thousands of fans to shows with artists like Sheryl Crow, Mavis Staples, Candi Staton, Drive By Truckers, Amanda Shires and Lucinda Williams and is one of the premier events in the Shoals musical calendar..\n\nA loving husband, father, and other-worldly musician, Jason Isbell has achieved global success on a level that we at FAME knew was possible. Jason will always have a special place in our hearts as a member of the FAME Gang and we’re excited to see him continue to make genre-defining and genre-expanding music in the future.\n\nFor Immediate Release\n\n8 TRACK ENTERTAINMENT OPENS DOORS IN MUSCLE SHOALS\n\nANNOUNCES INAUGURAL PARTNERSHIP WITH HISTORIC FAME RECORDING STUDIOS\n\nFOR FUTURE MUSIC PROJECTS INCLUDING THE\n\n“60th ANNIVERSARY OF FAME AND THE MUSCLE SHOALS SOUND” ALBUM\n\nSIGNS GRAMMY® AWARD-WINNING GROUP SHENANDOAH TO\n\n8 TRACK RECORDS\n\nMuscle Shoals, AL (April 12, 2022)….Newly formed global entertainment company 8 Track Entertainment has entered into an inaugural partnership with historic Fame Recording Studios for future music projects, reveals the signing of Grammy® award-winning country stars Shenandoah and plans to release the “60th Anniversary Of FAME And The Muscle Shoals Sound” album.

In addition, 8 Track and FAME have numerous co-ventures planned for the future including music publishing, TV/Film, touring/live events and music programs for community schools. We will be intentionally working with outside studios as the bigger movement is about Muscle Shoals and Alabama…not only FAME.”\n\n“We are very excited to partner with 8 Track Entertainment on this next chapter in Muscle Shoals music’s historic legacy. Our music is currently on fire with the Shoals represented on almost every major award show over the last few years,” commented Rodney Hall, Co-Owner and President of FAME Publishing/FAME Records/FAME Recording Studios. “We look forward to working with the entire Shoals music scene to bring opportunity to artists, producers, engineers, studios, songwriters, musicians as well as all the other music related businesses.”\n\nThe partnership’s first project, “60th Anniversary Of FAME And The Muscle Shoals Sound,” between the newly revamped storied FAME Records and legendary producer, Keith Stegall’s Dreamlined Entertainment, is currently in production and is set for release later this year.
