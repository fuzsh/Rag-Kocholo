        "text": "Curtis Lee Mayfield (June 3, 1942 — December 26, 1999) was an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, and record producer, and one of the most influential musicians behind soul and politically conscious African American music. Dubbed the “Gentle Genius,” he first achieved success and recognition with the group, The Impressions. It seems he made quite an impression himself.\n\nIn December 1971, after 10 years of writing and recording hits such as “Keep on Pushing,” “People Get Ready,” and “We’re a Winner,” Curtis Mayfield was pushing it up. He was approached backstage after a solo concert at New York’s Philharmonic Hall by a film producer who invited him to write and record the soundtrack for a “blaxploitation” feature film called Super Fly. The soundtrack was noted for its socially conscious themes, mostly addressing problems of crime, poverty, and drug abuse. The album was ranked at no. 72 on Rolling Stone’s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\n\nTragically, Mayfield was paralyzed from the neck down after lighting equipment fell on him during a live performance at Wingate Field in Flatbush, Brooklyn, New York, on August 13, 1990. Despite this, he continued his career as a recording artist, releasing his final album New World Order in 1996."
