        "text": "Chart-topping BRIT and Ivor Novello-nominated singer-songwriter Tom Grennan has selected his Ryder Cup: Range Sessions tracks including hits from Eminem, Take That and Wham!\n\nThe keen golfer, whose 'What Ifs & Maybes' album drops on the 16th June 2023 and includes his latest single 'How Does It Feel', also compares the similarities in golf and music, how he prepares for live shows and what's next for the UK artist.\n\nYou can listen to Grennan's playlist by clicking here.\n\nPre-gig motivation song?\n\nLose Yourself by Eminem.\n\nYou’re a golfer and you’ve just won the Ryder Cup, what’s the first song you put on in the team room?\n\nIt has to be Elton John’s I’m Still Standing.\n\nFirst artist you saw live?\n\nIt was actually Take That with my Mum.\n\nJust as the professionals prepare for the Ryder Cup, what do you do to prepare for your live shows?\n\nI prepare for shows in the gym and by doing vocal exercises. I believe preparing just as an athlete would, by looking after myself, is the key when doing this music thing. There’s a lot of travelling and shows so I must be on it and ready to go.\n\nYou can play golf with three professional golfers, who's in that dream four-ball?\n\nShane Lowry, Tiger Woods and Matt Fitzpatrick.\n\nA song that means something to you and why?\n\nIt has to be Ray Charles’ Georgia On My Mind. It makes me think of my Grandad’s house and him playing old records when I was a kid.\n\nRoad trip song?\n\nLast Last by Burna Boy\n\nGuilty Pleasure?\n\nWham's Club Tropicana.\n\nTell us a bit about the Range Sessions playlist you've chosen?\n\nThe playlist I’ve chosen is full of motivational bangers and tunes to get you in the mood for summer.\n\nCan you tell us a bit about your new album?\n\n‘What Ifs & Maybes’ is all about spontaneity and taking risks. It’s fun, colourful and exciting!\n\nWhen will you next be touring?\n\nI’ll next be touring at the end of the year but at the moment I’m focused on summer festivals."
