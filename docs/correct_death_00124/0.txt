Singer and songwriter Curtis Mayfield died yesterday at the North Fulton Regional Hospital in Roswell, Ga. An onstage accident in 1990 left Mayfield paralyzed from the neck down, a condition that caused his health to deteriorate in recent years. Doctors amputated his right leg last year because of diabetes brought on by the injury.
