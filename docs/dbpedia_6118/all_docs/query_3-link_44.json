        "text": "Last year, Atari resurrected its classic Atari 2600 home console with the all-new Atari 2600+, which features modernized touches like HDMI output and USB ports while maintaining the original's look and functionality. The refreshed retro console has been out for less than a year, but just got its first discount over at Amazon. You can grab it for just $115 (was $130).\n\nAt first glance, the Atari 2600+ looks almost identical to the original machine that first launched in the US back in 1977. Everything from the wood panel faceplate and chunky metal switches to the simple wired joystick and retro font is authentically recreated. But thanks to built-in HDMI and widescreen support, you can plug the Atari 2600+ into modern TVs and monitors.\n\nThe Atari 2600+ can play original Atari 2600 and 7800 games, and ships with a special 10-in-1 cartridge featuring some of the system's most popular titles, including:\n\nYar's Revenge\n\nMissile Command\n\nAdventure\n\nCombat\n\nDodge 'Em\n\nHaunted House\n\nMaze Craze\n\nRealsports Volleyball\n\nSurround\n\nVideo Pinball"
