        "text": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWill current owners of Atari 50 be able to access the Expanded Edition content?\n\nYes, Atari has confirmed that current owners of Atari 50 will be offered the Expanded Edition content as paid DLC when it launches on 25th October.\n\nHow much will the Atari 50 Expanded Edition DLC cost?\n\nAtari hasn't announced a price for the DLC at the time of writing.\n\nRetail copies of Atari 50 Expanded Edition will cost $39.99, but this will also include the base game.\n\nWill modern Atari games be added to Atari 50?\n\nHighly unlikely. Atari as it's known today is responsible for several games on Switch and other platforms, and it also owns companies such as Digital Eclipse and Nightdive Studios. Atari 50 is, first and foremost, an interactive history of the company from its inception to the release and subsequent failure of the Atari Jaguar in the '90s.\n\nCertain Atari 2600 games, however, could be potential candidates. Atari released a 'demake' of the platform title Mr. Run and Jump for the newly-released Atari 2600+ (also playable on the original console, of course), so we could imagine that one making its way to Atari 50 at some point. Modern homebrew titles, such as the Ready Player One-inspired 'The Stacks', could also make the jump.\n\nWill E.T. release on Atari 50?\n\nE.T. is widely known for being, to put it lightly, disastrous. It was, according to some, so bad that many had directly linked the title to the video game crash of 1983. A significant number of copies, along with other 2600 titles, were buried in a landfill after Atari had failed to shift them commercially. In this humble writer's opinion, mind you, it's not quite as horrific as some would make out."
