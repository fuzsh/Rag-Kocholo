        "meta_description": "\"Have you played Atari today?\" Ah, good old 2600 â€” originally called the Video Computer System, or VCS, but widely know simply as \"the Atari\". Folks, this is the definition of classic gaming. It's impressive to see how far some developers have pushed a machine with a measly 128 bytes of RAM ...",

        "text": "Box art Title Genre Description Adventure Action Adventure One of the earliest action-adventure games, Adventure is a rather abrupt little adventure game that is often considered the predecessor to games like Zelda. The replay value is almost zero, once you've played all three maps and found the magic pebble to get to the Easter Egg, but you should play it at least once. \"Somebody get this freakin' duck away from me!\"\n\nplay it now\n\nAsteroids Shoot 'em Up If you haven't heard of Asteroids, clearly you've been living under a rock for the last fourty years. Move your ship around, shoot the Asteroids for as long as you can. Simple and addicting. Obviously not the same as the arcade original, which had vector graphics, this port used colored sprites (because the 2600 couldn't do vector), which makes it a bit more cheerful I think.\n\nplay it now\n\nAtlantis Defense Basically like Missile Command but with some added depth for good measure. Three guns to take out the invaders! Since you're protecting Atlantis, I always figured you're shooting down humans, which would be ironic and awesome.\n\nplay it now\n\nBeamrider Shoot 'em up This is a typical \"shoot aliens coming from above\" game, but you see it from a tilted perspective, which was not usual at the time. Even though it's a port from the far more powerful Intellivision, it's still reasonably close. Truly one of the best-looking games for the system.\n\nplay it now\n\nBerzerk Arcade/Combat Robots, maze, blaster and you. It's self explanatory.\n\nplay it now\n\nCentipede Shoot 'em Up Hide behind mushrooms, shoot mushrooms, shoot bugs, next level. Great fun.\n\nplay it now\n\nChopper Command Defense/Shoot 'em Up Oh shit is dis sum Chopper Command? This game stands as one of the best 'Defender' games on the Atari because YOU'RE FLYIN' CAP'N! Seriously dickloads of fun, it added some much needed speed to a dulling genre. Also one of the first games with HUD-map. Hoo-rah!\n\nplay it now\n\nCombat Shooter One of the launch titles for the 2600, it still stands as a great multiplayer game. Combat has been remade and remade again (even though technically it itself is a remake of the Arcade game Tanks), none of them beat how much fun the multiplayer was and the sheer amount of content for an early 2600 game this cart packs.\n\nplay it now\n\nDemon Attack Shoot 'em Up Fun Atari 2600 shooter that was pretty popular in its heyday. Also notorious due to a lawsuit: Atari thought it was a ripoff of Phoenix.\n\nplay it now\n\nDig Dug Arcade All the gameplay is perfectly intact, one of the better ports and Atari games even as it's one of the few games to even have music too!\n\nplay it now\n\nDonkey Kong Arcade / Platformer Now, obviously, this is not the best port of the original Donkey Kong by any means. If you want an arcade perfect port, look no further than the one of the various NES releases. However, it's a almost a rule to own Donkey Kong if you have an Atari 2600. Why? I'm not sure. But it is. Still fun after all these years, but if you want extreme-authenticity, you're looking at the wrong edition.\n\nNote: Also released on Colecovision with the same must own status.\n\nplay it now\n\nE.T The Extra-Terrestrial Top-down Adventure THE WORST VIDEO GAME EVER!!!!\n\n...except not really. E.T. has quite a bad reputation, being misblamed as the single cause of the Great Video Game Crash; while it did make matters worse, it could not wreak so much havoc alone. In all fairness, there were much worse games for the 2600 that rarely get mentioned.\n\nAs for the game itself, this is an interesting top-down adventure where you must search for phone parts to call your spaceship to get back home, all while avoiding those pesky FBI agents. At the time, it was very unique and innovative. But, to have it in stores by Christmas, Atari gave their developer little over a month to design and program it, while the usual development cycle was about six months. So, it ended up with a number of infuriating design issues. But there is now a fan-made hack that fixes most of them and makes E.T. a far more enjoyable game.\n\nplay it now: original version / fixed version\n\nEnduro Racing A very solid racing game by Activision. Enduro itself stands for endurance race, so the point is to pass a certain number of cars each day to progress. There are some neat ideas to create challenge, such as fog. Probably the best racing game on the 2600. A classic.\n\nplay it now\n\nFast Food Arcade Weird-ass fucking game, an arcade-ish title where the object is to eat as much fucking food for you as possible. You control a pair of lips, and you literally just try to eat fast food as it flies by you (fast)! The only thing you don't wanna eat are the purple pickles, they're bad. Something great for wasting a bit of time. Every time you 'level up' the screen scrolls \"You're getting fatter!\" which is just fucking hilarious. The rate of the food flying at you then speeds up (or did you slow down because you're fat?).\n\nplay it now\n\nFrogger Arcade You should help a little frog to cross a street, while cars trying to smack you, and then a river, with dangerous obstacles. Note that, while the cartridge version is decent, the Supercharger port is far more faithful to the arcade.\n\nplay it now\n\nFrostbite Platformer Activision was the king of the Atari 2600, and made better games than Atari did. In this game you have to jump over ice blocks collect stuff and try not to die, pretty basic. You can use up the ice blocks you earn to change the current.\n\nplay it now\n\nHaunted House Survival Horror Quite possibly the first survival horror title, Haunted House plays a lot like Adventure in concept. While not really scary by any means, it's still a solid little title especially if you're looking for another title that plays like Adventure.\n\nplay it now\n\nH.E.R.O. Platformer It is the Helicopter Emergency Rescue Operation! You play with a badass equipped with a mini-helicopter on his backpack, who must descend on a dangerous cave to rescue miners trapped within.\n\nplay it now\n\nJawbreaker Maze Out of all the Pac-Man clones, Jawbreaker is one of the most interesting ones: the maze itself is in constant motion. The pacing of the game is pretty damn fast, and the graphics are very well done.\n\nplay it now\n\nJoust Arcade Just like the Arcade game, but in within Atari limits!\n\nplay it now\n\nJr. Pac-Man Maze The only home port of the game, and it's really good! The graphics and sound are great for an Atari game. Has more content than Ms. Pac-Man and is more fast paced.\n\nplay it now\n\nJungle Hunt Platformer A damn good arcade port. You are an explorer in Africa, and cannibals are about to turn your wife into dinner! Oh, man, this shit would never fly today. But anyway, this game has a lot of variety for a 2600 title; you swing on vines, swim in a river full of crocodiles, dodge an avalanche, and finally overcome the savages to save the lady. The graphics are great, with well-animated sprites and some cool parallax scrolling effects.\n\nplay it now\n\nKangaroo Platformer A Donkey Kong like game by Atari, not as good as the Atari 5200 version but still fun and worth a buy if you don't have the stronger systems.\n\nplay it now\n\nKaboom! Puzzle Some crazy jack-hole is dropping bombs everywhere! Using the paddle controller, douse the flames on the bombs before they explode! Multiplayer is endless fun, and allows for some serious friend-trolling. Quite possibly, the world's first counter-terrorist simulation.\n\nplay it now\n\nKeystone Kapers Platformer A criminal has escaped from prison and is hiding in a mall. As a policeman, it is your duty to chase him down and bring him to justice!\n\nplay it now\n\nMario Bros. Arcade Obviously not the best port, but it still has must own status for Atari fans.\n\nplay it now\n\nMillipede Shoot 'em Up Centipede but with bombs, so it's arguably better.\n\nplay it now\n\nMissile Command Defense Plenty of missiles were launched towards the city you've sworn to protect, be a man and shoot those fuckers down!\n\nThe arcade Missile Command was designed for a track ball; if you can get your hands on a 2600 \"trak-ball\", it greatly improves the game.\n\nplay it now\n\nMontezuma's Revenge Platformer The best platformer for the system, or any other system of the era. Makes Pitfall look woefully primitive.\n\nplay it now\n\nPengo Maze / Puzzle Classic Sega arcade game where you have to break blocks in a strategic manner. Very fun, though it's on much stronger systems.\n\nplay it now\n\nPitfall Platformer It's Pitfall, one of the original platformer / explore adventures. What more do you need to know? It's probably the most loved Atari 2600 game of all time, though there are much better games. However, still one of the best.\n\nplay it now\n\nPitfall II: Lost Caverns Platformer It's Pitfall, only way more complex now: instead of exploring the jungle, you hunt for treasure in carverns that go many screens deep. One of the most advanced 2600 games, thanks to a special chip built into the cartridge.\n\nplay it now\n\nPlanet Patrol Shoot 'em up A little-know horizontal shmup with good gameplay and some rather unusual features. This game has a day and night cycle, and by night you can't see anything, except when your own shots light the sky. Also, unlike most of this genre, it scrolls to the left rather than right.\n\nplay it now\n\nPlaque Attack Shoot 'em Up/ Dental Hygiene Simulator Another Activision gem. This one-screen shmup has you play as a tube of tooth-paste defending what appears to be a British person's mouth against the evil damage of not-to-scale junk food. Fast-paced action and an ammo limit (your tube of Colgate doesn't last forever does it?) makes this a fun but nonetheless strategic shooter absolute bliss. Highly recommended.\n\nplay it now\n\nPressure Cooker Simulation A game where you have to make hamburgers according to the chart at the bottom of the screen. It starts out pretty easy, but soon the game turns evil and shafts you on ingredients and speed. It's also pretty addictive, and it's from Activision, so what the fuck are you waiting for?\n\nplay it now\n\nQ*Bert Puzzle Better than your sloppy NES port I tell ya what, the controls are great since it's joystick.\n\nplay it now\n\nQ*Bert's Qubes Puzzle Only on this and the Coleco, this is the inferior but still great version. Hop on blocks and collect stuff like in regular Q*Bert but the blocks reset. (An actual cart is quite expensive!)\n\nplay it now\n\nRiver Raid Shoot 'em Up A vertical scrolling shooter. While it lacked the variety of stages of Vanguard, most 2600 fans tend to remember it more fondly, probably because it was a much more accessible and easy to pick up title. Usually makes then top ten list of 2600 games. A solid title. On the Shumps evolutionary ladder, this game is homo erectus to Raiden's Homo sapiens (and Touhou's homo weeaboo).\n\nplay it now\n\nSolaris Rail Shoter The best looking game on the Atari 2600, pew pew shoot the aliens and asteroids and stuff! You have to refuel and try to save stranded people along the way while navigating through space to find planet solaris. Lots of depth for a 2600 game!\n\nPlay it now!\n\nVideo Olympics / Pong Sports Pong\n\nIt's fuckin' Pong. There's really nothing else you need to know. There was so many Pong clones on the Atari 2600 that it became a nuisance and even constitutes its own category. Pong itself though, just good old, official Pong, is always fun. This version is well known for its AI. You can look up the exact algorithm on Google; suffice it to say that it was so good that modern Pong remakes still use it.\n\nplay it now\n\nYar's Revenge Arcade/Defense Yar's Revenge is easily one of the best Atari 2600 games ever made. Which is hilarious considering it was made by the same guy who made the abysmal E.T. game. This game is hard. And amazing. The gameplay has a lot of depth and yet is really simple; it simply cannot be described here. It's in your best interest to look up this game! They're doing a modern remake of this, as a rail-shooter with a smexy chick in power armor.\n\nplay it now"
