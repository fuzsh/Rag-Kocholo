        "text": "Basic Math 2600 Haunted Houses: On the second floor of the tutorial level Graves Academy, after collecting the first piece of the urn, keep moving to the right when you come to the lift to the third floor. You'll find a question mark saying this is a dead end, but you'll also see the word TEST on the wall to the left. Stand on the mat in front of this room's door and you will be teleported into the classroom itself. Locate the test and submit it to the desk at the back of the classroom to unlock Basic Math for the Atari 2600. You'll be reminded to pick up the urn piece on your way out. Combat Two 2600 Quadratank: Set up a Capture the Flag match on Map 2, the brown terrain. Collect 5 long-range powerups for your tank. Shoot and steer a rocket to trace a circle around the Atari logo at the center of the playfield. You can set the Weapons to Rockets & Lasers to begin with a rocket launcher."
