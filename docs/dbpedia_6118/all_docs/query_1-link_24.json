        "text": "In the game Double Dragon, the player takes on the role of a martial arts fighter whose girlfriend has been kidnapped by the Black Warriors gang. The playerâ€™s twin brother joins in as the two brothers set out to rescue the girl.\n\nThe game is a side-scrolling beat â€™em up, and the player must fight their way through hordes of enemies using punches, kicks, and other martial arts moves. The Black Warriors gang members are armed with weapons such as knives, whips, bats, boulders, and dynamite, making the fights more challenging.\n\nThe game includes several levels, each with its own set of enemies and obstacles. At the end of each level, the player faces a boss character, including the Uzi-toting boss who doesnâ€™t believe in happy endings."
