        "text": "The Atari 2600+ is a blast from the past that’s sure to resonate with older games that grew up with the classic console.\n\nFirst released in 1977, the Atari 2600 was the most popular home console of its era, and it’s still beloved by many. The Atari 2600+ is essentially the same console many know and love, but it’s been updated to work on modern displays while also supporting your existing library of Atari 2600 and 7200 game cartridges.\n\nIf the Atari 2600+ has pulled on your nostalgic heartstrings, here’s everything you need to know about the updated classic console.\n\nAtari 2600+ price\n\nWant to know the Atari 2600+ price? The revamped classic console costs $129.99 and includes the CX40+ Joystick and a 10-in-1 game cartridge that features some of Atari’s most famous games like Yars’ Revenge and Missile Command.\n\nBuy it now from Atari\n\nAtari 2600+ pre-order date\n\nYou can pre-order the Atari 2600+ right now from Atari’s website. Pre-orders will be considered final 30 days after you’ve placed your order, so bear that in mind if you do put the cash down for the Atari 2600+.\n\nAtari 2600+ release date\n\nThe Atari 2600+ began shipping in November 2023. It’s now available from most international retailers, which means you can grab the console if you’re located outside the US. Shipping usually takes up to 24 hours after your payment has been processed, but this doesn’t include weekends or holidays and purchases made after 11am PST will not be shipped out until the next business day.\n\nAtari 2600+ features\n\nThe Atari 2600+ is essentially an updated and modernized version of the iconic Atari 2600 that was first released in 1977. It plays both original Atari 2600 and 7800 game cartridges, and can easily connect to modern TVs thanks to its HDMI output.\n\nThe console also supports widescreen mode and has an enlarged cartridge sot to reduce sticking. The Atari logo also lights up when it’s in use, which is a nice touch, and the system comes with a CX40+ Joystick that’s been lovingly recreated to the same specifications as the original.\n\nAtari 2600+ games\n\nIf you don’t have an existing library of Atari games to play, don’t worry. The Atari 2600+ comes with a 10-in-1 game cartridge which includes the following titles:\n\nAdventure\n\nCombat\n\nDodge ‘Em\n\nHaunted House\n\nMaze Craze\n\nMissile Command\n\nRealSports\n\nVolleyball Surround\n\nVideo Pinball\n\nYars’ Revenge\n\nThe console will also be able to play digital titles, including a reimaging of the Atari classic Haunted House and original games like Days of Doom.\n\nAtari 2600+ specs\n\nThe Atari 2600+ features a Rockship 3128 SOC microprocessor with 256MB DDR3 RAM and 256MB eMMC fixed internal storage. The console also comes with a wired CX40+ Joystick with DB9 connector. The console weighs 1lb and 9oz and is 10.63” x 7.09” x 2.76”.\n\nWhat’s more, the Atari 2600+ is compatible with most 2600 and 7800 cartridges. Check out the compatibility list for more. Just bear in mind that the console doesn’t come with a USB-C power adapter so you’ll have to pick one up separately.\n\nAtari 2600+ vs Atari VCS\n\nThe Atari 2600+ differs greatly from the Atari VCS. The Atari VCS is a modern gaming console that blends the best of consoles and PC into one package. You can use apps, stream video from Netflix, and even turn the VCS into a machine for PC hobbyists and DIY hardware enthusiasts. In terms of games, you can play Atari classics and modern games and access a huge retro library from Antsrream Arcade. The Atari VCS also costs $299.99 instead of $129.99.\n\nAtari 2600+ restock alerts\n\nCan’t find the Atari 2600+ in stock or want to be alerted when more stock goes live? Follow Matt Swider on X (previously known as Twitter) for restock alerts and turn on notifications so you don’t miss out.\n\nSimply click on the bell icon on Matt’s profile to receive notifications so you don’t miss out on any Atari 2600+ restock alerts.\n\nCan I buy the Atari 2600+ outside the US?\n\nUnfortunately, the Atari 2600+ is only available in the US for now. International retailers will be announced in the future, so stay tuned for more if you’d like to pick up the console but don’t live in the United States.\n\nShould you buy the Atari 2600+?\n\nIf you’re on the fence about buying the Atari 2600+, Atari CEO Wade Rosen spoke to CNN and outlined why he thinks it will be a success.\n\n“I think the 2600+ has legs because there’ll be new content, new games coming out but also additional ways to play these games to make them accessible to larger communities,” Rosen told CNN. “Do I think these things are going to replace modern consoles? Absolutely not. There’s like no way that would happen, nor would they need to. They’re radically different things.”"
