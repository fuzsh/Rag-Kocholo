        "text": "The updated Atari 2600+ is out now and still available to order, along with a handful of accessories and games.\n\nAtari might not be making new consoles these, but now you can relive the glory days by ordering the Atari 2600+, which is out now. This modern reimagining of the iconic 2600 plays official 2600 carts (and 7800 carts) and offers plenty of cool features to bring retro games to your screen in 2023. A few other accessories and brand-new games are available for order, all of which has launched as of today, November 17, alongside the Atari 2600+--here’s a look at everything up for grabs.\n\nAtari 2600+\n\n$130\n\nThe new Atari 2600+ looks a lot like the old Atari 2600. But while it might boast an old-school design, it’s decidedly modern. This includes support for wide screen mode, HDMI input, and a 10-in-1 cartridge loaded with the following games:\n\nAdventure\n\nCombat\n\nDodge ‘Em\n\nHaunted House\n\nMaze Craze\n\nMissile Command\n\nRealsports Volleyball\n\nSurround\n\nVideo Pinball\n\nYars’ Revenge\n\nCX40+ Joystick\n\n$25\n\nWhile your Atari 2600+ includes a single CX40+ Joystick, you can pick up a second one for $25. This is about as close to the original as you’ll get, featuring not just a large red fire button and rubberized joystick, but also a wired DB9 connector. That means it works with both the new 2600+ and the old 2600 (if you still happen to have one lying around the house). As of this writing, it's sold out at Amazon but can still be ordered through Atari's store.\n\nCX30+ Paddle Controller Bundle\n\n$40\n\nLike the CX40+, the CX30+ Paddle is a reimagined version of the old paddle controller. This replica includes not just the paddle controller, but also a four-game bundle:\n\nBreakout\n\nCanyon Bomber\n\nNight Driver\n\nVideo Olympics\n\nNew Atari 2600 Games\n\n$30\n\nNot sold on the 10 games included with the Atari 2600+ console? Then be sure to check out Mr. Run and Jump 2600 and Berzerk: Enhanced, both of which are available for $30. Mr. Run and Jump is a brand-new platformer that just recently released for modern consoles and PC, so this \"demake\" is pretty neat.\n\nJon Bitner on Google+\n\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly?
