        "text": "introducing atari 2600+\n\nAttention all retro enthusiasts! Atari has come out with a new video game console: the Atari 2600+. Honoring the legacy of the Atari 2600 (see a LEGO replica of the legendary console, here), this reimagined model preserves the original specifications while shrinking the size to 80% of its predecessor. The compact remaster allows users to enjoy their beloved old cartridges—all conveniently loaded up onto a single, unified system. The global launch date for the gaming system is set for November 17, 2023.\n\nthe remastered console, Atari 2600+ | images courtesy of Atari\n\nrevamped atari console for an enhanced experience\n\nPresenting an upgraded iteration of the Atari 2600, the new console introduces a more compact size. ‘The original 2600 design was beautiful but came with a very large footprint,’ shares Atari (find more here). ‘At 80% of original size, we believe the 2600+ is able to retain the iconic look of the original, while also making it easier to fit into modern living spaces.’ The console features several improvements, including the ability to play both Atari 2600 and 7800 game cartridges, facilitated by an HDMI output that ensures easy connectivity. The addition of a widescreen mode enhances the gaming experience, while an enlarged cartridge socket effectively reduces instances of cartridges sticking. A finishing touch, the logo on the console lights up during gameplay.\n\nThe package includes a CX40+ Joystick, recreated to match the original specifications, along with a 10-in-1 game cartridge showcasing a selection of game developer’s famous titles, such as Adventure®, Combat®, Dodge ‘Em™, Haunted House®, Maze Craze™, Missile Command®, RealSports® Volleyball, Surround™, Video Pinball™, and Yars’ Revenge®. The featured joystick and paddle controllers come equipped with DB9 connectors, ensuring compatibility with the original Atari hardware. This thoughtful integration allows users to enjoy both their old equipment and new console, embracing the best of both worlds.\n\nthe package includes a CX40+ joystick, recreated to match the original specifications\n\nthe compact video game console allows users to enjoy their beloved Atari 2600 and 7800 cartridges\n\na closer look at the Atari 2600+\n\nthe console comes with a 10-in-1 game cartridge showcasing a selection of game developer’s famous titles\n\nthe cartridge includes games like Adventure®, Combat®, Dodge ‘Em™, and many more\n\nproject info:"
