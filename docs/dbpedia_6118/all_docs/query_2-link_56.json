        "text": "2600 Games with Issues\n\nAlthough the Atari 7800 was designed to be backwards compatible with all Atari 2600 games, in actuality there are some 2600 games which will not boot or function properly on certain revisions of the 7800 hardware. Earlier consoles from the initial 1984 run and shipped during 1986 (consoles with an expansion port) seem to have the least issues, with later consoles having more problems. Listed below are some of the 2600 games which are known to have compatibility problems on later versions of the 7800.\n\nAll Tigervision games are incompatible with all 7800s due to the dust cover posts poking out too far, preventing the game PCB from actually making contact with the cartridge port\n\nArcadia Supercharger add-on games\n\nRobot Tank\n\nSpace Shuttle\n\nThe Activision Decathlon\n\nMany of these incompatibilities can be fixed by removing a capacitor which forms part of a timing circuit, which was added to the system's motherboard during 1987. Removing this capacitor may also break compatibility with a few other 2600 games, namely Dark Chambers and Kung-Fu Master. Both of these games in particular have (arguably superior) ports on the 7800 however.\n\nPAL Games with Issues on NTSC 7800\n\nNote that the BIOS on NTSC 7800 consoles must be replaced with a different one that does not perform the encryption check, otherwise no PAL games will even boot. This issue does not apply to flash carts such as the Concerto as they clear the encryption check.\n\nAlso note that most PAL games will have the screen shifted down as they were reprogrammed to take advantage of the extra resolution PAL offers over NTSC. Some games that function correctly may also have slightly different colors due to the NTSC and PAL MARIA graphics chips having different color palettes.\n\nThese games were tested on a 1984-built NTSC 7800 using a Concerto flash cart.\n\nGame Title Issue Severity Ace of Aces Rapidly flickering title screen, major graphical glitching during gameplay Unplayable Alien Brigade Resets every few seconds on title screen Unplayable Ballblazer Major graphical glitching, runs too slow Severe Barnyard Blaster (No further testing performed due to lack of light gun) ? Baseball Entire screen flickers Severe Basketbrawl No sound on title screen, plays too slow, major graphical glitching during gameplay Severe Centipede Plays too slow Moderate Choplifter Plays too slow, flickering colors during gameplay Severe Commando Crashes to black screen after title screen Unplayable Crack'ed Flickering colors during gameplay Moderate Crossbow No issues other than the screen being shifted down Minor Dark Chambers Graphical glitching when scrolling vertically Moderate Desert Falcon Plays too slow, major graphical glitching Severe Dig Dug Sound is too fast, gameplay is too slow, top half of screen flickers Moderate Donkey Kong No issues other than the screen being shifted down Minor Donkey Kong Junior No issues other than the screen being shifted down Minor Double Dragon Boots to black screen Unplayable F-18 Hornet Boots to vertical colored bars and droning sound Unplayable Fatal Run Sound is too fast, flashing colors and major graphical corruption Severe Fight Night Flickering colors, crashes when gameplay begins Unplayable Food Fight Flickering graphical glitching, plays too slow Moderate Galaga No issues other than the screen being shifted down Minor Hat Trick No issues N/A Ikari Warriors Flickering graphical corruption, plays far too slow Severe Impossible Mission Flickering colors, crashes to black screen when entering a room Unplayable Jinks Sound samples on title screen are just random noise, major graphical corruption Severe Joust Crashes immediately, only displays copyright info on title screen Unplayable Karateka Boots to black screen Unplayable Kung-Fu Master Crashes to screen with corrupted graphics after title screen Unplayable Mario Bros. No issues other than the screen being shifted down Minor Mat Mania Challenge Corrupted title screen, droning sound during gameplay Moderate Mean 18 Ultimate Golf Graphical corruption when anything moves, glitched sound Moderate Meltdown Sound is too fast (No further testing done due to lack of light gun) ? Midnight Mutants No issues other than the screen being shifted down Minor Motor Psycho Boots to black screen Unplayable Ms. Pac-Man Screen is extremely jumpy, plays too slow Severe Ninja Golf Severe graphical corruption during gameplay Severe, almost unplayable One-on-One Basketball Flickering colors on game selection screen Minor Planet Smashers No issues other than the screen being shifted down Minor Pole Position II Flickering background, plays too slow Minor Scrapyard Dog Crashes when gameplay begins Unplayable Sentinel Corrupted graphics, flickering background (could not test further due to lack of light gun) ? Super Huey UH-IX No issues other than the screen being shifted down Minor Super Skateboardin' Flickering background, plays too slow Moderate Title Match Pro Wrestling No sound Moderate Tomcat: The F-14 Fighter Simulator Flickering background, corrupted graphics on carrier, crashes when plane takes off Unplayable Tower Toppler Boots to black screen Unplayable Xenophobe Crashes at title screen Unplayable Xevious Graphical glitching at top of screen, uneven frame rate Moderate\n\nNTSC Games with Issues on PAL 7800\n\nAll NTSC games have some graphical glitches on the botttom of the screen due to the higher resolution of the PAL MARIA. Some games that function correctly may also have slightly different colors due to the NTSC and PAL MARIA graphics chips having different color palettes.\n\nThese games were tested on a 1991-built PAL 7800 using a RetroHQ 7800GD flash cart."
