        "text": "For the Sega Game Gear game, see Double Dragon (Game Gear).\n\nn/a\n\nDouble Dragon (ダブルドラゴン) is a beat-'em-up by Technos released for the arcades in 1987. It is considered a spiritual sequel to Technos's previous hit Renegade. The original arcade game was a blockbuster success and established a number of conventions that would define the beat-'em-up genre, serving as a precursor to later games in the genre such as Final Fight and Streets of Rage. The game was ported to several consoles and home computers since its original arcade release, including to Sega consoles twice: the first time was for the Master System by Sega themselves in 1988, and later for the Genesis in 1992 by Accolade.\n\nStory\n\nNear the end of the 20th century, violence ruled the streets of New York City after the nuclear war and people began forming gangs to survive. On the outskirts of the city lived twin brothers named Jimmy and Billy Lee. The brothers used to run a martial arts school in the centre of the city which was burned down to ashes five years ago as a result of the nuclear war. Despite this, the brothers did not neglect their training for even a day.\n\nThe younger brother, Billy, was romantically involved with a female instructor named Marian, but Jimmy was secretly in love with her as well. One day, Marian was abducted by the Black Warriors, a savage street gang led by a man named Willy Mackey. The gang gradually grew in size after the nuclear war and they are now dominant organization of the city.\n\nThe Lee brothers set out to confront the Black Warriors and rescue Marian.\n\nGameplay\n\nMaster System version\n\nDouble Dragon is a belt-scrolling beat-'em-up, meaning that the ground is depicted from a titled perspective that allows movement sideways as well as vertically (in and out of the plane). The game can be played by up to two players simultaneously, with the first player controlling Billy Lee (who wears a blue outfit) and the second player controlling his twin brother Jimmy (in red). The objective of the game is to defeat every enemy from one area to the next until reaching the end of the stage and defeating a boss. The second player can join the game at any point (except during the last stage) by pressing on the control pad.\n\nThe brothers can move in any direction using the D-Pad. They punch with and kick with . Using the same attack repeatedly performs a combo that ends by knocking the opponent down. They can do an elbow smash that hits enemies behind them by holding the D-Pad in the opposite direction that they are facing while pressing . They can headbutt opponents with or . They can grab downed opponents and knee smash them with or throw them with . The characters can perform a flying jump kick by pressing + while moving with the D-Pad. Or they can perform a leaping reverse kick (a jumping kick in the opposite direction that they are facing) by pressing + when standing in place. These jump kicks are sometimes necessary to jump onto platforms in some stages.\n\nIn addition to their hand-to-hand techniques, the brothers can equip numerous weapons, which are found on the ground or dropped by enemies when they are knocked down. Weapons can be picked up with when standing over them and used with (replacing the punch). Weapons include whips and bats, which are swung at opponents and give the characters increased reach, and knives and dynamite, which are thrown at enemies. The characters can also pick up and throw large objects such as drums or rocks.\n\nThe brothers have health meters consisting of five segments and lose a segment whenever they take damage from an opponent. They lose a life if they take damage without any health remaining but revive in place after a moment if the player has extra lives remaining. There are also some basic platforming sections in which characters can lose a life if they fall off the stage. Each player starts the game with three lives, and players also start the final stage with three lives regardless of how many they had before. Players earn an extra life for every 30,000 points collected. The game ends if the player runs out of lives. The player has a limited amount of time to press to continue the game (resetting the score) after running out of lives. The game has unlimited continues, except for the last stage, which cannot be continued.\n\nStages\n\nThe Slums Map: 1️⃣ The Factory District Map: 1️⃣ The Park Map: 1️⃣ The Black Warriors Headquarters Map: 1️⃣\n\nMega Drive version\n\nThe game is a belt-scrolling beat-'em-up played as one or both of the Lee brothers. It can be started as a two-player game, or another player can join during gameplay by pressing START .\n\nThe brothers move sideways with and as well as towards or away from the background with and . They jump with . Stages sometimes contain platforming sections (such as jumping over gaps). Some stages contain ladders or fences in the background that can be climbed with and .\n\nThe brothers punch with and kick with . The basic attacks consists of a left-right punch combo and a kick. After a couple of punches or a single kick, the enemy is stunned. During this period, the player can follow it up with an uppercut, a roundhouse kick, or a head grab (depending on the enemy type). During a head grab, the player can repeatedly kick an enemy with their knees with or throw him to the other side with . Some enemies can also be grabbed from behind during two-player mode, allowing the other player to attack them. Characters can elbow smash foes behind them with + . They can perform a jump kick by jumping with and pressing if facing left or if facing right. They can perform a jump kick by jumping with and pressing if facing left or if facing right. Or they can perform a leaping reverse kick by jumping with and pressing if facing left or if facing right. They can headbutt opponents with or .\n\nThere are also several types of weapons that are either found on the ground in certain areas or by disarming an armed enemy. Characters can pick up a weapon with when standing near it and use the weapon with (replacing punch). Certain large objects can also be kicked to the ground with .\n\nThe brothers have health meters consisting of five segments and lose a segment whenever they take damage from an opponent. They lose a life if they take damage without any health remaining, fall off the stage, or run out of time but revive in place after a moment if the player has extra lives remaining. The timer starts over if the players get a time over. Players earn an extra life for every 30,000 points collected. The game ends if the player runs out of lives, but it can be continued if the players have credits remaining. Players have separate lives but share credits. The players can decide the number of starting lives and credits (2, 4, or 6) in the options before starting the game.\n\nStages\n\nThe City Slum The Industrial Area The Forest The Hideout of the Shadow Boss\n\nVersions\n\nMaster System version\n\nThe Master System version is a downscaled adaptation of the arcade game similar to the NES version released before it. While the character designs are pretty similar to the NES version, the Master System version retains the two-player co-op mode and features level designs much closer to the arcade game (albeit without the vertical scrolling and climbable ladders and fences in some areas). Because the arcade version used a three button setup (with a dedicated jump button), the input method of certain moves such as the flying jump kick, backward spin kick and elbow strike were changed to better accommodate the Master System's two button controls. The consecutive attacks (the uppercut and roundhouse kick) and the hair grab are also performed a bit differently. The Master System only displays up to three enemies and a single weapon on-screen at once. Stages are not timed in this version.\n\nMega Drive version\n\nIn contrast, the Mega Drive version is a relatively straight port of the arcade with slight differences in graphics and sound. Most notably the backgrounds graphics are different, some of the character sprites (specifically Marian and Linda) are not 100% accurate, and the head-swapped boss characters (the mohawked version of Abobo at the end of Missions 1 and 3, and the Lee brother lookalike at the end of Mission 2) are replaced with plain palette swaps. While the arcade game presents itself as one continuous stage without interruption, the Mega Drive version, like other ports of the game, blackens the screen between stages.\n\nLocalised names\n\nAlso known as Language Localised Name English Translation English Double Dragon Double Dragon English (US) Double Dragon Double Dragon Japanese ダブルドラゴン-双截龍 Double Dragon Portuguese (Brazil) Double Dragon Korean 더블드래곤 Double Dragon\n\nProduction credits\n\nMaster System version\n\nSource:\n\nDeveloper mentions\n\nMega Drive version\n\nSource:\n\nUS manual[11]\n\nMagazine articles\n\nMain article: Double Dragon/Magazine articles.\n\nPromotional material\n\nES advert (1990)\n\nES advert (1991)\n\nPrint advert in Excalibur (CZ) #12 (1992-09-01)\n\nPhysical scans\n\nMaster System version\n\n75 Based on\n\n14 reviews\n\nDouble Dragon\n\nMega Drive version\n\n57 Based on\n\n22 reviews\n\nDouble Dragon\n\nTechnical information\n\nMain article: Double Dragon/Technical information.\n\nReferences\n\nDouble Dragon\n\nMain page | Comparisons | Maps | Hidden content | Magazine articles | Reception | Region coding | Technical information | Bootlegs\n\nNo results"
