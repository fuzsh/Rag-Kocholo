        "text": "The Atari 2600 was the first ultra successful home video game console. It is the console that started gaming for many people. During its life-cycle the Atari 2600 had thousands of games released. Some of them were good and some were horrible. Most are ridiculously cheap but a few 2600 games have become rare collectibles. The list below is the most rare and expensive Atari 2600 games.\n\nClick to see Prices For All Atari 2600 Games\n\nMost Valuable Atari 2600 Games\n\nAir Raid\n\nUsed Price: $13,900 | CIB Price: $33,400 | See Current Prices\n\nAir Raid is the only known game released by Men-A-Vision and has a very distinctive cartridge design with a blue 'T' shaped handle. In the game you must protect a city from invading alien ships. You try to destroy them before they destroy the city.\n\nAir Raid is believed to be the rarest of the commercially released games for the Atari 2600. The cartridge by itself usually sells for $3,000. Only two copies are known to exist with the original box. One of them sold for $31,600 in April 2010 and the other for $14,000 in 2012. There is only one known complete version with the manual too.\n\nRed Sea Crossing\n\nUsed Price: $13,800 | CIB Price: $NA | See Current Prices\n\nRed Sea Crossing wasn't even known in the Atari community until 2007 when it was found at a garage sale. It is a Christian game and was only sold via phone order. The only known ad for the game was in Christianity Today.\n\nRed Sea Crossing is the most expensive Atari 2600 game when it is cartridge only, by about $10,000. Air Raid sells for more when it comes with a box.\n\nBirthday Mania\n\nUsed Price: $6,500 | CIB Price: $NA | See Current Prices\n\nPersonal Games created Birthday Mania as a custom birthday gift for Atari owners. The buyer would custom order the game with the recipient's name on the title screen and a space on the label to write their name.\n\nThe concept never gained traction. Because the items had to be special ordered and were not mass-produced, the game is very rare. Only two copies are known to exist. This game has never been sold publicly so the price is an estimate but the highest known offer to buy was $6,500.\n\nGamma-Attack\n\nUsed Price: $6,000 | CIB Price: $NA | See Current Prices\n\nGamma Attack was the only game released by Gammation. It's rarity rivals that of Air Raid with only two known copies in existence. You control a Gamma ship and must destroy enemies as they enter your planet.\n\nThe game has never sold at a public auction so the exact price is hard to know. The price listed is based upon offers that one of the owner's claims he has received. It is a very reasonable estimate considering the game's rarity.\n\nKarate [Ultravision]\n\nUsed Price: $2,000 | See Current Prices\n\nKarate for Atari 2600 was released by two companies, Froggo and Ultravision. The Froggo version is quite common and sells for hardly anything. The Ultravision version is very rare and sells for top dollar.\n\nUltravision has two versions of Karate, a T-shape cartridge (pictured to the left) and a standard shaped cartridge. Both have the same artwork on the front and sell for roughly the same amount.\n\nPepsi Invaders\n\nUsed Price: $800 | CIB Price: $NA | See Current Prices\n\nPepsi Invaders was a custom designed game for Coca-Cola. They took the Space Invaders game concept and changed the aliens to letters spelling \"Pepsi\". The game was given to executives at a sales convention in 1983.\n\nOnly 125 were originally produced. Based upon the number of sales for this game it is assumed that the vast majority were destroyed by the recipients.\n\nMangia\n\nUsed Price: $700 | CIB Price: $1,500 | See Current Prices\n\nMangia was developed by Spectravision and like most Spectravision games it was only available via mail order. The mail order distribution method made all their games much harder to find than ones available at retail stores. Mangia is the rarest of their games.\n\nIn Mangia you control a boy who eats pasta until his stomach explodes. To avoid dying you throw pasta to a dog or cat, but must avoid your mom seeing you waste food.\n\nEli's Ladder\n\nUsed Price: $650 | CIB Price: $NA | See Current Prices\n\nEli's Ladder is an educational game for the Atari 2600. You count and do addition and subtraction games and drills. The game was released by SimAge.\n\nThe game was originally packaged with a wall chart and motivational stickers to help motivate kids to learn and play. These are even more difficult to find than the game.\n\nLochjaw\n\nUsed Price: $600 | CIB Price: $NA | See Current Prices\n\nThe game Shark Attack was originally released with the name Lochjaw. Apollo decided to change the name after they were sued for infringing on the copyrights for Jaws the movie. Because the game was only released for a limited time with this name and cover art it is very hard to find today.\n\nThe game play is almost the exact same as Shark Attack. You try to collect diamonds in each level before a sharks eats you and before he eats too many of the diamonds too.\n\nGauntlet\n\nUsed Price: $600 | CIB Price: $NA | See Current Prices\n\nGauntlet is another mail-order only game for the Atari 2600. This one was released by Answer Software. It has nothing in common with the dungeon crawling game with the same name. In this game you must prove your manhood to an ancient Indian tribe by running through their gauntlet of obstacles.\n\nThe game was originally sold in a foam case with no box so this game is never found with a \"box\" like most games.\n\nAtlantis II\n\nUsed Price: $510 | CIB Price: $5,000 | See Current Prices\n\nAtlantis II is a special edition of the original Atlantis that was only given to a few gamers as part of a contest. The developers held a national contest to crown the best Atlantis player. Numerous people reached the maximum score in the game so in order to crown a champion they mailed entries with the maximum score a new version of Atlantis that is much faster.\n\nThe exterior of both Atlantis games looks the exact same. The easiest way to tell the difference is by looking at the font on the high score.
