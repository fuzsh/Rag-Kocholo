        "text": "Since none of those early systems featured any custom designed CPU, generic development systems / In Circuit Emulators can provide all luxury needed.\n\nGI, first of those offered, beside cross-assembler support, their GIC1600 development system as shown on p.88 ff of the May 1975 catalogue.\n\nMOS did the same. Already before the first 65xx chips were available\n\ncross-assembler on time sharing systems was made available.\n\nSoon after (1977) the MDT-650 (Microcomputer Development Terminal for 650x) was available (*1)\n\nFollowed by the KIM-1\n\nLater that year a set of brown boxes were produced (*2), eventually the most professional of all MOS/Commodore provided 650x development tools (*3)\n\nFollowed in 1978 by the MDS 650 (Microcomputer Development System for 650x) which was a modified PET 2001 32N with a 2040 floppy drive.\n\nFor the Z80 Intel development systems could be used at first, followed by Zilogs Blue and White MCZ boxes, commonly known as Zilog Z80 Development System, according to their front plate.\n\nMost of those hardware based system had, one way or another, ICE like capabilities supporting partial or full cycle exact execution trace and complex traps/breakpoints, like the Real-Time Debug Module for Zilog's MCZ:\n\n(Taken from the April(?) 1976 Product Specification brochure)\n\nOften full ICE probes were available to trace and inspect the target system. For the MCZ this would have been the In-Circuit Emulation Board:\n\nSystems from other manufacturers (GI, Intel, MOS, Motorola) could be fitted with similar boards.\n\nOf course all of those were professional systems usually way past 5k USD. Rather out of reach for hobbyists or real garage startups.\n\nThen again, by 1978 a multitude of (native and non native) systems could be used for either CPU, as all needed was an assembler (could be written over a weekend) and a PROM burner to get started. When ROM production was about, adding a paper tape punch would be handy.\n\nAlso, paper based development was always the base stage before touching any IDE, no matter how capable. It was simply faster to look at paper and think a bit than running a compile/execute cycle.\n\n*1 - Used at Commodore to develop the PET\n\n*2 - I got a set in storage, but really no idea what it was called.\n\n*3 - Rockwell might have had some real nice development/ICE systems as well, although I do not have any documentation for them."
