The game is a spiritual and technological successor to Technos’ earlier beat ’em up, Nekketsu Koha Kunio-kun (released outside of Japan by Taito as Renegade), but introduced several additions such as two-player cooperative gameplay and the ability to arm oneself with an enemy’s weapon after disarming them. Double Dragon is considered to be one of the first successful examples of the genre, resulting in the creation of two arcade sequels and several spinoffs, as well as inspiring other companies in creating their own beat ’em ups. The player takes control of martial artist Billy Lee, or his twin brother Jimmy (also known as Hammer and Spike in the supplementary materials for the American arcade release), as they fight their way into the turf of the Black Warriors gang in order to rescue their common love interest Marian.\n\nVideo Game Emulation\n\n(Download and play on your computer)\n\nColecoVision Emulator for Windows\n\nGames: Tapper, Football, Jungle Hunt, Baseball, Galaxian, Zaxxon, Star Trek, Super Donkey Kong Jr, Popeye, Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr, Time Pilot, Frogger, Fury, Burger Time, Centipede, Qbert, CosmoFighter, plus many more…\n\nNintendo Emulator (NES) for Windows\n\nGames: Adventure Island, Commando, Bad Dudes, Baseball, Bill and Teds Adventure, BurgerTime Castlevania, Commando, Dig Dug, Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr, Elevator Action, Frankenstein, FunHouse, Galaga, Gauntlet, Jurassic Park, Mario Brothers, Millipede, Ms. PacMan, Pipe Dream, Popeye, Qbert, Super Mario Brothers & Duck Hunt, Tetris, Ultima4, WWF, plus many more…"
