        "text": "The Atari 2600+ launched last fall, offering a modern take on the retro console. While it's compatible with hundreds of old Atari 2600 cartridges, the unit is built with tons of quality-of-life upgrades--including HDMI output, USB power, and support for a wide range of resolutions. The system wasn't forgotten after rolling into 2024, with a slew of new games and accessories arriving later this spring on May 24.\n\nPreorders are now open for all the new arrivals. Ninja Golf and Food Fight are the only games in the lineup, but both cartridges are supported by the new Atari 2600+ and the original Atari console. Each is listed for $30 and they look to be faithful recreations of the originals.\n\nAside from the two games, a new CX78+ Gamepad is up for grabs, giving you another way to control the action beyond the traditional joystick. You'll also find a CX30+ Paddle Pack and an Accessory Extension Cable available for preorder.\n\nAtari 2600+ Preorders\n\nNinja Golf USC -- $30\n\nFood Fight USC -- $30\n\nCX78+ Gamepad USA -- $25\n\nCX30+ Paddle Pack USC -- $25\n\nAccessory Extension Cable (4ft) -- $10\n\nIf you're not sold on any of the upcoming items, there are plenty of existing games and accessories for the Atari 2600+ console. One of the most enticing options is the 4-in-1 Game Cartridge with Paddle Pack, as it's just $40 and includes the following games:\n\nBreakout\n\nCanyon Bomber\n\nNight Driver\n\nVideo Olympics\n\nOn top of those games, the bundle comes with a set of Twin Paddle Controllers. That makes it an incredible value, especially when compared to standalone games that cost $30."
