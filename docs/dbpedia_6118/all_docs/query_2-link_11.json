        "text": "My Arcade’s intriguing Atari Gamestation Pro features 201 games, including 138 Atari arcade and console games, and 63 Piko Interactive games for a variety of platforms. At around $79.99 – $130.00 or so (depending on the retailer), it’s not a bad deal as it includes two wireless joysticks with multiple buttons and a paddle control. Unfortunately, it’s a paddle, not a spinner, so it’s not supported in games that require a free-spinning dial like arcade Tempest. For games like that, you’ll need to use the inferior joystick control. Similarly, many of the Piko Interactive games are NES-, SNES-, and Genesis-era console titles that really scream out for a gamepad, rather than joystick, configuration. Fortunately, it seems some third party controllers are compatible.\n\nThere are a few surprises in the game list, including one Activision game, Boxing, and a title with a secondary license, Road Runner, both for the Atari 2600. Overall, it’s a nice mix of titles, but I can guarantee a few games that require other types of controls (including the aforementioned spinner and gamepad) like the trackball-based arcade versions of Missile Command and Centipede, just to name two, will be miserable experiences.\n\nAnd yes, apparently, you can use the microSD card slot to add your own games.\n\nHere’s the game list:\n\nAtari 2600 VCS (82 titles):\n\n3D Tic-Tac-Toe\n\nAdventure\n\nAdventure II\n\nAir-Sea Battle\n\nAquaventure\n\nAsteroids\n\nAtari Video Cube\n\nBasic Math\n\nBasketball\n\nBowling\n\nBoxing (Activision)\n\nBreakout\n\nCanyon Bomber\n\nCentipede\n\nChampionship Soccer\n\nCircus Atari\n\nCombat\n\nCombat Two\n\nCrystal Castles\n\nDark Chambers\n\nDemons to Diamonds\n\nDesert Falcon\n\nDodge ‘Em\n\nDouble Dunk\n\nDrag Race\n\nFast Eddie\n\nFatal Run\n\nFlag Capture\n\nFootball\n\nFrog Pond\n\nGolf\n\nGravitar\n\nHangman\n\nHaunted House\n\nHome Run\n\nHuman Cannonball\n\nIndy 500\n\nMaze Craze\n\nMillipede\n\nMiniature Golf\n\nMissile Command\n\nMotoRodeo\n\nNight Driver\n\nOff the Wall\n\nOutlaw\n\nPong (Video Olympics)\n\nQuadrun\n\nRadar Lock\n\nRealsports Baseball\n\nRealsports Basketball\n\nRealsports Boxing\n\nRealsports Football\n\nRealsports Soccer\n\nRealsports Tennis\n\nRealsports Volleyball\n\nRoad Runner\n\nSaboteur\n\nSave Mary\n\nSecret Quest\n\nSky Diver\n\nSlot Racers\n\nSolaris\n\nSpace Raid\n\nSpace War\n\nSprint Master\n\nSteeplechase\n\nStreet Racer\n\nStunt Cycle\n\nSubmarine Commander\n\nSuper Baseball\n\nSuper Breakout\n\nSuper Football\n\nSurround\n\nSwordquest: Earthworld\n\nSwordquest: Fireworld\n\nSwordquest: Waterworld\n\nTempest\n\nVideo Checkers\n\nVideo Pinball\n\nWarlords\n\nWizard\n\nYars’ Revenge\n\nAtari 5200 SuperSystem (7):\n\nCentipede\n\nFrisky Tom\n\nMeebzork\n\nMillipede\n\nMissile Command\n\nRealsports Baseball\n\nRealsports Basketball\n\nAtari 7800 ProSystem (10):\n\nAlien Brigade\n\nAsteroids\n\nBasketbrawl\n\nCentipede\n\nDark Chambers\n\nDesert Falcon\n\nFood Fight\n\nMotorpsycho\n\nRealsports Baseball\n\nScrapyard Dog\n\nAtari Arcade (39):\n\nAlpha One\n\nAsteroids\n\nAsteroids Deluxe\n\nAtari Baseball\n\nAtari Football\n\nAtari Soccer\n\nAvalanche\n\nBasketball\n\nCanyon Bomber\n\nCentipede\n\nCloud 9\n\nCrystal Castles\n\nDominos\n\nDrag Race\n\nFire Truck\n\nFood Fight\n\nGravitar\n\nI, Robot\n\nLiberator\n\nLunar Battle\n\nLunar Lander\n\nMajor Havoc\n\nMillipede\n\nMissile Command\n\nMonte Carlo\n\nNight Driver\n\nPool Shark\n\nQuantum\n\nRed Baron\n\nRunaway\n\nSky Diver\n\nSky Raider\n\nSpace Duel\n\nSuper Breakout\n\nSuper Bug\n\nTempest\n\nTournament Table\n\nUltra Tank\n\nWarlords\n\nBonus (Piko Interactive arcade- and 8- and 16-bit-era titles) (63):\n\n8 Eyes (8-bit)\n\nBad Street Brawler (8-bit)\n\nBeast Ball (16-bit)\n\nBrave Battle Saga (16-bit)\n\nBurglar X (arcade)\n\nCanon: Legend of the New Gods (16-bit)\n\nCheese Chase (arcade)\n\nDash Galaxy in the Alien Asylum (8-bit)\n\nDiver Boy (arcade)\n\nEliminator Boat Duel (8-bit)\n\nEscape from Atlantis (8-bit)\n\nExploding Fist (8-bit)\n\nFancy World (arcade)\n\nFree Fall (8-bit)\n\nGalaxy Gunners (arcade)\n\nGorodki (8-bit)\n\nJim Power: The Lost Dimension in 3D (16-bit)\n\nLan Master (8-bit)\n\nLawn Mower\n\nLittle Lancelot (8-bit)\n\nLucky Boom (arcade)\n\nManiac Square (arcade)\n\nMega 3D Noah’s Ark (16-bit)\n\nMermaids of Atlantis (8-bit)\n\nMetal Mech (8-bit)\n\nMighty Warriors\n\nMotor City Patrol (8-bit)\n\nNightshade: Part I: The Claws of Sutekh (8-bit)\n\nNoah’s Ark (8-bit)\n\nPing Pong Masters 93 (arcade)\n\nPOW 2 (8-bit)\n\nPower Punch II (8-bit)\n\nPyramids of Ra (8-bit, version 1)\n\nPyramids of Ra (8-bit, version 2)\n\nRadical Rex (16-bit)\n\nSnakky (8-bit)\n\nSnow Board Championship (arcade)\n\nStanley: The Search for Dr. Livingston (8-bit)\n\nSteel Force (arcade)\n\nStreet Racer (16-bit)\n\nSumo Slam (16-bit)\n\nSuper Hunchback (8-bit)\n\nSwitchblade (16-bit)\n\nSword of Sodan (16-bit)\n\nTarget: Renegade (8-bit)\n\nThe Fidgetts (8-bit)\n\nThe Gadget Twins (16-bit)\n\nThe Humans (8-bit)\n\nThe Humans (16-bit)\n\nThe Immortal (8-bit)\n\nThe Immortal (16-bit)\n\nThe Mutant Virus (8-bit)\n\nThunderbolt (8-bit)\n\nThunderbolt II (16-bit)\n\nTinhead (16-bit)\n\nTop Racer 2 (16-bit)\n\nTreasure Master (8-bit)\n\nViking Child (8-bit)\n\nWater Margin (16-bit)\n\nWorld Rally (arcade)\n\nWorld Trophy Soccer (16-bit)\n\nZany Golf (16-bit)\n\nZooming Secretary (8-bit)"
