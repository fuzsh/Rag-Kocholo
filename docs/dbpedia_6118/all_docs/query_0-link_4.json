        "text": "I personally love the late-80s/early-90s titles. I tend to be intrigued by 'late' releases on any console, but my fondness for the 2600, coupled with the very fact that a 1977 system was still seeing new product even as the 16-bit era had dawned, well, I'm just endlessly fascinated by the whole thing. Sure, some of the games are probably more interesting in a demake, \"hey, this shouldn't exist!\" kinda way, but others are impressive, fun, genuinely good games; not only welcome additions to the 2600 library as a whole but they also, perhaps surprisingly, do a good job of at least scratching the surface of then-current gameplay styles. (That's to say, River Raid II technically fits better in the late-80s gaming scene than River Raid does, even if, I feel, it can't begin to touch the original in the fun department.)\n\nA few thoughts:\n\n- Xenophobe is a top 10 favorite of mine for the 2600. Not only do I just find it a lot of fun, but the lower-grade visuals and sound actually, to me, make it feel like a more desolate and desperate situation than the bright, comical look of the coin-op and other home ports. It's too bad the simultaneous two-player gameplay had to be chopped (despite what the back of the box implies, it's two-players alternating only), but that only adds to the isolated feel of the proceedings.\n\n- Not that there are a ton of them anyway, but Ikari Warriors gets my vote for best top-down run n' gun on the console, and that's coming from someone who easily prefers Commando between the two in pretty much any other circumstance. Just a real fun arcade conversion that's better than it has any right to be, IMO. (2600 Ikari Warriors may very well find it's way into my personal top 10 on the console, as well.)\n\nOh, and regarding those two aforementioned titles, thanks to the Venezuela find, what were once pretty rare games in the NTSC format are now easily obtainable new & sealed!\n\n- I like that Atari took the time to put out some new, improved sports games. Okay, sure, Super Baseball is just a modified Realsports Baseball (neither are very good, but luckily Absolute's Pete Rose Baseball, while certainly not perfect, at least better attempted to get with the times), but Super Football was an unbelievably advanced then-new product for the console. That vantage point, those scaling players/goalposts/etc.; just incredible! I consider it easily the best football game on the 2600, and one that's infinitely superior to the embarrassment that was Touchdown Football on the 7800, as well. (I also like the black background, which to me suggests a night game on a cold fall/winter night - evocative!)\n\nAnd then there's Double Dunk, which, unless you count the variations in Video Olympics, is only the second basketball game to grace the 2600 - some 11 years after the first! (Unless I'm forgetting another one? The unreleased Realsports Basketball doesn't count IMO, so...?) While I don't think it tops the 1978 Basketball in the pure fun department (there's something to be said for that straight-ahead, one-on-one simplicity), Double Dunk certainly isn't bad, but what's more impressive to me is that it manages to attain something of an actual attitude; those funky beats, the break dancing characters, the blacktop setting, the between-game lingo (\"Jammin'!\"), the gritty 'streetball' vibe of the whole thing, it all manages to capture a feel of the late-80s/early-90s in a way that you simply wouldn't expect of a 2600 game.\n\nAlso, props to Realsports Boxing. I would guess that most people prefer Activision's earlier Boxing, and while I can definitely understand that, I do think Atari's entry is plenty worthwhile. Okay, yeah, RSB is pretty button-mashy, I know. But nevertheless, I think it's fast and furious and fun, and that roaring crowd in the darkened arena evokes the aura of the sport in a way that Activision's game, to me, just doesn't - even if the Activision game is technically better from a pure gameplay standpoint. (Also, it's interesting that RSB was the only new title in the Realsports line to carry over from Atari Inc. to Atari Corp. I wonder why they decided to have one more entry in the line instead of just giving it a new, more eye-catching name not unlike their other updated sports games?)\n\n- Speaking of Activision, the post-crash Activision tends to get a lot more flack than the pre-crash Activision. It's no secret as to why, but the shift in direction to mostly coin-op ports (divisive ones at that!) provides for, I feel, some really fascinating stuff. Kung-Fu Master is a lot of fun, and while the one-button limitation takes some getting used to, I don't know why the game seems to get lumped in with the other two, more notorious ports, which I'll get to momentarily. To me, KFM on the 2600 compares surprisingly well to the NES version!\n\nRampage: now truth be told, I don't much care for any version of Rampage; it's alright for a few levels, but it gets repetitive fast, and the admittedly-mega-cool concept isn't enough to carry the game the whole way (IMO). Still, if there's a version of it I'd consider my favorite, it would be the 2600 port - mainly because of the whole demake feeling I mentioned at the start of this post. Rampage shouldn't exist on the 2600 - but it does! Like 2600 Kung-Fu Master, I'm a little confused by comments tearing into it, stating it's one of the worst on the console, etc. etc. etc. Sure, it's pretty ugly, but like KFM, it plays okay, considering you've only got a single button to work with. Unless I'm just totally forgetting something, all the major aspects of the coin-op are represented. It's just that the flaws inherent to the original game are, erm, present in the 2600 version, too.\n\nAnnnnnnnd then there's Double Dragon for the 2600. Talk about a divisive game! Some folks (understandably) despise it, while others can see the positives in what was, to say the least, an ill-advised decision to port the game to the 2600. I'm in the latter group; I don't think anyone, myself included, would say it's a flawless game or a definitive port. BUT, I don't think it's the total train wreck it's often claimed to be, either. Graphically and musically it's very good, even terrific, for the 2600. It attempted to port all four missions from the arcade over (they're lacking the interactivity and personality of the coin-op, but hey, at least they're there). And it even managed, with a bit of a cheat, to get the simultaneous two-player action in - which actually puts it one up on the NES version! For those reasons alone, I think 2600 DD is automatically disqualified from the usual \"one of the absolute worst on the console\" lists it sometimes finds itself on; it's hardly on the same plane as ugly, unplayable tripe like Karate. (And yes, I know someone will shout \"but it IS unplayable!\" I don't think so, though there's definitely a learning curve - and a little spamming of moves and enemy AI - involved in progressing. There have been discussions dedicated to all that before however, so I'll refrain from a full dissertation on the subject. I will say though that had they simply lowered the difficulty and not attempted to map so many moves to a single button & joystick combo, I think current popular viewpoints on the game would be a LOT different nowadays.)\n\nIn the interest of full-disclosure, I'm a Double Dragon fanatic. I tend to snap up as many entries in the franchise as I can, so I can be a bit softer on the 2600 version. Like Rampage, it's got the whole demake, \"they actually MADE this?!\" thing going for it - only taken to the nth degree. Nobody should have expected a hot beat-'em-up that was tearing up the arcades and other home consoles to make any sort of appearance on the severely under powered 2600 - but it did and that alone makes the game utterly fascinating. Your mileage may vary, but frankly, I think that fascination transcends the actual gameplay of the cart itself. Love it or hate it, Double Dragon on the 2600 is undeniably a curio!\n\nAnd finally, there's Ghostbusters II. I was a Ghostbusters kid, so anything from that era is going to strike a chord with me. A game (one from the incredibly late date of 1992, no less!) that was never released in the U.S., based on one of the cinematic cornerstones of my youth? Want! NEED! It may be sorta ugly and somewhat lacking in the gameplay department (at least as far as the first stage goes; stage two, if you can get to it, looks and, IIRC, plays quite a bit better), but I didn't and don't care; I *love* the very fact that there's a Ghostbusters II on the 2600. I'm not sure what the value of it is nowadays, but it doesn't matter; I consider my boxed copy one of the hallmarks of my 2600 collection.\n\n(While we're at it, with it hailing from 1985, I'm not sure if you can consider Activision's first Ghostbusters on the 2600 in the same category as these other late games - though '85 certainly was a particularly 'lost' year in the 2600's lifespan - but boy am I sucker for it. I love that original Activision game on pretty much any platform, but the fact that, like so many other games in this discussion, they managed to fit such an 'involved' title into a 2600 cart, well, I think it's impressive. I don't even mind - too much - that it requires you to make in-game use of switches on the console itself, which is usually an \"aw c'mon!\" thing with me.)\n\nSo anyway, just a few thoughts of mine; YMMV, of course. Fun topic, at any rate!"
