        "text": "Post by alphex on\n\nI suppose I'm the resident fan of that series here? There's been two Technos appreciation threads, but not a general Double Dragon thread (just some chit-chat for the 25th anniversary), and the series also has no article (which is understandable I guess, as there's a ton of ports and games in it).\n\nSo I guess a general thread about the series could be pretty cool. I'll try to give some opinions, since I suppose providing a detailed starting post is a good idea if you want some replies (if all else fails, you can still use this thread to disagree with my take on the series).\n\nFirst off, what's funny for me regarding the series is my fondness of it. For some reason, I really like these games, but what I associate them with is not exactly present in ANY of its installments. I think the first part I had played was part 2 on the NES, although on an emulator, in the late 90s on a PC in school with a buddy. And granted, level 2 of that game takes place at night. But in general, the whole \"80s action in the city at night\"-trope was never too present in the games. Still, what I somehow associate Double Dragon with is best summarized by the box art of the first part on the Game Boy:\n\nNot exactly a setting too dominant in the games. But no matter how often I play the series, that association won't shake. It DOES feel appropriate, for some reason. Maybe it's also down to the gameplay and the music?\n\nSecond, I have a really hard time naming my favorite part of the series, which kinda sucks, since they all have their own weaknesses. The ones I REALLY enjoyed were 2 on the NES, Return of on the SNES, and Advance. 2 is a great game for the console it's on and its time, but the platforming and hardware limitations (for example, regarding the number of enemies on screen) hurt it somewhat. River City Ransom is just more fun I guess, especially since I like my brawlers frantic and fun. Return is incomplete and slow, but the counter and atmosphere are awesome. It just felt pretty epic all around. Stage 2 of this one is set at night as well, and in an airport with tons of shiny lights nonetheless! And Advance - the two player mode doesn't seem to offer an option to turn friendly fire off. Combined with the low resolution of the GBA, that makes for a rather reserved experience, which I find a bit counterintuitive for the genre. Otherwise, I guess most on here know that it is a fantastic game and probably the most complete classic-ish entry in the series.\n\nTo me, Double Dragon and its atmosphere (or at least what I associate with it) are something I hold dear. It just feels extremely late 80s in my opinion, also exemplified by the fact just HOW badly the series fared afterwards. (Since DOS gaming from that era is also what I most associate with the 80s, it's quite a shame just how shitty the PC ports are. At least the Amiga port of 2 seems to be pretty good.) It's kind of a \"the best of both worlds\" (meaning Japan and the US - I wasn't around in the '80s, so for me, that decade is defined by the media of that era I grew up with): It doesn't have ninjas, but it has the whole martial arts angle, it's got the typical Anime-setting of that time (SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THE APOCALYPSE; even semi-cyberpunkish!), and it's set in a big crime ridden city! Streets Of Rage might be more about the big city at night, but its music makes it less about big heroism. Just look at the logo of part 2! That font is so super 80s, as is the title. To me, it's a rather innocent reminder of a simpler time (I grew up when stuff like that was on reruns and those games were already classics, as I was born in '87), even if one clad in a tale of renegade revenge for murder.\n\nDouble Dragon 1, to me, is barely playable in its arcade version. The constant slowdown is just bullshit. (As far as I know, the recently released trilogy fixes this, which also can be done by overclocking the arcade emulation in MAME. Videos I've seen of this in action seem rather hectic, though.) The NES version lacks cooperative multiplayer, which is equally inexcusable for the genre. I do like the Game Boy port quite a bit, since to me, that system is great for short bursts of playthroughs, and I wouldn't have a friend around for coop play for that either. Plus I actually enjoy the 2D segments quite a bit, since they shake up the formula. All versions have great music.\n\nDouble Dragon 2 - the NES version is fantastic, as already stated. That one also has some purely 2D sections, which serve to provide a nice change, but sadly also some platforming unfit for the engine. The arcade version AGAIN suffers from slowdown, but I think one stage has a purple sky - I love that, as it's somewhere between overstylized and surreal. The Game Boy version has subway levels (which I like, because The Warriors), but isn't a true Double Dragon game, but a reskinned Kunio-Kun one. It shows. Quite repetetive as well. Haven't played the PCE version, but it looks quite fantastic.\n\nDouble Dragon 3 seems quite fun on the NES, if it weren't for the idiocy of you only having ONE LIFE. The arcade version is not fun at all. The PC port is pretty good, though - in terms of conversion. It's not a good game, though.\n\nReturn Of Double Dragon - both the US and Japanese version are incomplete, but the Eastern release less so. A fun, albeit slow game. I think it got shat upon pretty badly when it was first released, which is quite a shame. Great music, too. I wish there was a hack that made the pace faster and added back some of the dropped features (environmental hazards, for one).\n\nDouble Dragon 5 - sucks. There's two hit re-dizzy combos in the game. The programmers had no idea about how to design a versus fighter, and it shows. The character design, based on the series or not, is also awful.\n\nBattletoads & Double Dragon is not exactly a Double Dragon game, as there's not a lot of weapons and it was obviously designed by Rare, but it IS fun. The continue system and difficulty after stage 2 (!) are severe bummers, though - a shame about the great music and charming art direction.\n\nDouble Dragon Neo-Geo is a LOT better than its reputation. Fun game, with some pretty cool juggle combos. Not one of the best versus fighters, and not what Double Dragon does best, but it is very fun.\n\nDouble Dragon Advance is easily the best of the series in single player, although it feels a little stiff. The Battletoads crossover, for example, had a much looser, more frantic quality to its gameplay. But then again, that had its share of problems as well. The quasi-port for the Zeeboo seems a lot more fluid, but I don't own that system and don't think it's emulated yet.\n\nI have, in fact, not played Neon yet, or any of the fan games. If there's a great one out that's on the level of Streets Of Rage remake, I'd love to know. I only ever found a ton of half-finished ones that seemed rather hectic in gameplay.\n\nSo, what is your take on the series? What are your favourite parts? Do you think the genre is stupid? Were you always more of a fan of Final Fight? Would you like a new game that doesn't re-tell the original once again? Either way, let's hear it\n\n(All images taken from the Double Dragon Dojo)\n\nPost by alphex on\n\nThanks for all the kind words!\n\nWill say this: Double Dragon Neon was amazing. Got it free on PSN, and gave it a try. I played it for a couple days straight =3. The new dodge system along with a slightly better juggle/combo system really went a long way. If anything, Neon is worth it for the OST... which resides on my mp3 player now >>\n\nThe soundtrack is actually free on the composer's bandcamp site: virt.bandcamp.com/album/double-dragon-neon\n\nAnd yes, it IS awesome. I don't have any system the game will run on, otherwise I would've long given it a shot.\n\nDouble Dragon Advance is what I feel the games should've been from the beginning gameplay-wise. As they are, they're difficult for me to really get into.\n\nIf only it felt a tad less stiff and had a higher resolution, it would be perfect. Which is why IMO, the Double Dragon game that simply clicks and has it all come together is yet to be released. I just hope it will be. (I've had people disagree with me on that before on here, but to me, Streets Of Rage only ever had its ultimately installment released as a fangame.)\n\nHaving had a Genesis, I did pick up the Battletoads crossover, and enjoyed that a lot. Even though everything about it is much more Battletoads(but at least there aren't any crazy obstacle course stages)\n\nAnd thank God for that! I never knew who actually preferred the memorization-heavy racer levels over actual brawler-gameplay? Especially Battlemaniacs was a prime offender as far as that was concerned, as it was yet another retelling of the first game (what's it with that genre and constant throwbacks to the first game?) and only had one or two levels which actually focused on the beat 'em up aspect!\n\nI'll always have a soft spot for the PC version of Double Dragon 3\n\nIt's easily the best of the three PC ports; it's just too bad that it is the one of the worst of the first three games.\n\nDD2 for the Game Boy was actually the first DD game I actually owned myself, and I dug it quite a bit! I can actually remember that I bought it when I was over in Vienna, visiting my then-girlfriend, and having a hard time understanding the guy who was selling it (thick Viennese dialect). I never completed it to this day, though - I always die in the last level, at the boss rush.\n\n@jasonx said:\n\nBelt scrollers in general feel like something that's ripe for a comeback these days.\n\nI hope you're right. They do take quite a bit of skills as far as the animation department is concerned, since simple stick figure pixelling won't cut it for that genre.\n\nOh, I guess it should be noted that the movie sucked, LOL. I did like the Stevie B. \"When I Dream of You\" scene though. Classic mid '90s stuff there. But that was pretty much the only good thing about that terrible movie. I'll never forgive them for what they did to Abobo! Speaking of Abobo, he's one of my all time favorite bad guys.\n\nI recently tried to rewatch that on Youtube and turned it off during the first fight scene when Billy (Jimmy?) was doing the whole noogy noogy thing to his opponent. Cringe-worthy stuff, especially since I remember the movie only getting worse afterwards.\n\nThey should have given Return Of Double Dragon 2 additional months of development and a Genesis port rather than sinking cash into this shithole.\n\nAnd at the risk of catching some flack, I actually kinda like Double Dragon V in the most guilty pleasure sort of ways. It's not a good game by any stretch, but I still find it to be oddly kind of fun in its own weird way. There's probably not a worse looking 24 meg game on the system, though, heh.\n\nIt feels so super stiff, and the animation is so bad, and the voice samples (I WIN!) are so... it DOES feel like a cheesy 90s cartoon in video game form. It tries super hard to be super cool, but, you know how that usually ends up. But of course you're free to like and enjoy it - it certainly is quite a document of its era and context.\n\nI remember reading about a control hack for the MD ver. of DD1, and I think there's a recent color hack for that version as well. Might be of interest.\n\nI'll check it out. Technically, the MD versions of 1 & 2 could be the best, but they both have their own glarring flaws (control for #1, AI for #2 I believe), so a control hack could be very cool.\n\nLike I said above, I kinda hope for a GREAT fangame or hack that builds upon an existing game and just fixes its flaws. But still, the license still seems to go around, so maybe we'll actually see a definite official release. I just hope it has a stage with purple skies in it."
