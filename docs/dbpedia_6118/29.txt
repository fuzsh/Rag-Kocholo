Double Dragon is a beat them up created by Technos Japan and released in 1987 by Taito. Originally released as an arcade game, versions were also made for home computers and consoles, including Amiga, NES, Atari ST, DOS, Atari 2600, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum.

The player controls brothers Billy and Jimmy Lee, who set out to use their training in the martial art of Sou-Setsu-Ken to rescue Billyâ€™s girlfriend Marian after the notorious Black Warriors gang kidnaps her.

Despite some initial difficulties in porting the game to home platforms (with the programmers of the Commodore 64 version even apologizing for compromises they made to include the much-loved two-player mode), players loved the entertaining gameplay, a wide range of martial arts moves, and the colorful and detailed graphics.

One year later, the game was followed by Double Dragon II: The Revenge, an even more significant success, and Double Dragon 3: The Rosetta Stone. In 1991 Marvel produced a six-issue series of comic books based on the video game. And in 1994, a live-action movie adaption of Double Dragon was released, starring Scott Wolf and Alyssa Milano. The Double Dragon series remains very popular, with new releases in the series scheduled for January 2017.
