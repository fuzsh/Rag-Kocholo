If you have the need to server Web sites and need or want to use IIS this is a good fit (well was a good fit) because it didn’t require the CALs that normal versions of Windows server did. You did pay a slight premium for this up front, but saved you quite a bit on the back end. Otherwise it was like any other Windows Server, fairly stable and performs as expected.

Never really saw much point in this although I did use it when learning web development. It was handy for testing out my asp code in a “live” environment. But could just as easily have used any other windows with iis.
