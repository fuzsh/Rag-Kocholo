Hi Guys,

Anyone know when either Windows 2003 SP2 or the deferment tool will be released through BigFix? I know it’s only been out a couple of days, but it was a bit of surprise to find out it had already been released. Just want to make sure it doesn’t go to any untested environments.

Edit : Couple of links about it…
