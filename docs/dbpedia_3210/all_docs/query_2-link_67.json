Therefore I would have to say VS 2010.\n\nHere's a more complete answer on VS 2013 that was posted a long time ago.. Can VS 2013 be installed on Server 2003 R2\n\nYou can develop your app in another platform. You don't need to run visual studio on server side. 2003 R2 support framework 4.0 but not support 4.5. So you can develop WCF or another applications."
