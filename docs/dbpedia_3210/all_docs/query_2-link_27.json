The newer versions do not install on these machines. what can we do to get logmein to work on these machines?\n\nyes we know the pc's are old.\n\nThank you. I believe this is happening because we no longer allow connections using TLS 1.0 and 1.1 as they are no longer considered secure.\n\nIf you have Internet Explorer 11 installed on these servers you should be able to open its Settings and enable TLS 1.2\n\nAfter consulting with Support, TLS 1.2 (or 1.3) may not be possible on Server 2003, an upgrade to Windows Server 2008 R2 may be required.\n\nGlenn is a member of the GoTo Community Care Team.\n\nWas your question answered? Please mark it as an Accepted Solution.\n\nWas a post helpful or informative? Give it a Kudo!.\n\nDo you want a new feature added? Make sure you Kudo (vote) for the Idea\n\nFree user and admin training\n\nThis is disappointing. Can't we have an old version that we can use?\n\nOur Windows 2003 R2 server is old software but is a VM as its only use is a basic FTP service and running some old legacy automated command line-based tasks. It is not worth the upgrade to Server 2008 with its more limited functions and tighter security on this particular partition.\n\nWe only need to access this remotely on a few occasions per year.\n\nPut the onus on the end user and allow them to install potentially insecure software.\n\nMy GoTo subscription has become useless. It looks like it's back to VMWARE via VPN"
