        "text": "On July 14, 2015, Microsoft will end extended support for Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2003 R2. Mainstream support finished in July 2010 and it has been in “extended support” since then. Organisations that fail to migrate from Windows Server 2003/R2 before this date will not be compliant with existing business standards and possibly expose themselves to vulnerabilities. While many business owners and IT departments are well aware of this fact, globally there are still nearly a million servers currently running live applications on the Windows Server 2003 platform. Now is the ideal time to ask yourself even if your Windows 2003 server is stable at this time, do you want to risk running your business applications on a server that will not be supported after 14th July 2015?\n\nWhat \"end of life\" means?\n\nNo Updates - 37 critical updates were released in 2013 for Windows Server 2003/R2 under Extended Support. No updates will be developed or released after end of life.\n\nNo Compliance - Lack of compliance with various standards has risks, these may include several regulatory and industry standards for which compliance can no longer be achieved. For example, lack of compliance with the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards might mean companies such as Visa and MasterCard will no longer do business with you.\n\nNo Safe Haven - Both virtual and physical instances of Windows Server 2003 are vulnerable and would not pass a compliance audit. Staying put will cost more in the end as maintenance costs for ageing hardware will also increase and many applications will also not be supported by the vendor.\n\nThere may be a number of reasons why you have not yet upgraded your systems such as the perceived challenges of upgrading applications, the presence of custom and legacy applications, budget and resource constraints. Now is the time to act, you must start planning your migration.\n\nA last minute migration could be problematic, the last minute approach to upgrades often results in problems, errors, inconsistencies with security, stability or functionality. These types of issues with your applications require immediate re-mediation and most often programmatic revisions which can impact on business productivity and result in further costs.\n\nFortunately, migrating to a supported server operating system can mitigate these risks and deliver valuable benefits and efficiencies. Windows Server 2003 is the last 32 bit server software released by Microsoft (although Windows Server 2008 did allow a 32 bit version) Windows Server 2008 and 2012 are 64 bit systems. With the cost of Memory falling in price and disk capacities growing at a faster level than ever before, you are able to replace the equipment purchased to run Windows Server 2003 for a similar (or lower) price than you paid years ago but with enormous growth in capacity and performance.\n\nSo what are your options?\n\nStay Put. Assuming your business actually relies on applications running on Windows 2003 server then this option is only practical if you have already started replacing all your applications and servers with a new architecture from the ground up. If you are planning a move then the risk of unsupported servers/applications is offset by the benefit of focusing all your efforts on the new system.\n\nUpgrade the server operating system. It’s highly likely the physical server itself is several years old (or more) and the risk of a physical component in the server failing increases with age, therefore you’re solving one problem but leaving the legacy hardware problem for a later date. It is also difficult to guarantee that you won’t encounter any significant application errors upon the server upgrade and as this is likely to be a production server then you need to be prepared for a services outage of 48 hours (or more).\n\nMigrate and upgrade. In almost every case this is the best, most logical and cost effective option. This option will ensure you receive security updates and vulnerability/stability patches for your operating system as well as vendor support from Microsoft if required. By replacing your hardware at the same time you will have the peace of mind that a component replacement can be sourced and installed within a defined SLA set by the manufacturer."
