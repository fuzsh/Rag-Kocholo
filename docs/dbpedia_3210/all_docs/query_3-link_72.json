The Database Server (Postgres) doesn't start and when I try to start it manually it shows the following error:\n\n\"Could not start the 3CX PhoneSystem Database Server service on Local Computer.\n\nError 5: Access is denied.\"\n\nThen I cannot access the configuration thru: http://localhost:5481/status.php. Can someone help me?\n\nThanks,\n\nHenrique Carvalho\n\nWhat does it show in the event logs when the services start?\n\nAlso check the firewall - turn it off to start with and see if that helps.\n\nJust to confirm you meant SP2 not RC2 correct? RC2 is beta \"release candidate\" software.\n\nI'm running no problems on 2003 SP2. Installed and runs perfect with no hicups at all.\n\nCheck the top 2 areas and let us know."
