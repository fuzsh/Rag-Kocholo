For some Hyper-V servers, we even went from 4 to 7 virtual machines—a 75 percent increase!”\n\n- David Feng, IT Director, Sporton International\n\nWindows Server 2008 R2 Hyper-V introduces a new feature, called Dynamic Memory, in the Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 Beta releases. It allows customers to achieve increased density when they’re consolidating physical servers into a virtual realm, providing them with predictable performance and linear scalability. With Dynamic Memory, IT administrators are able to pool available memory on a physical host and then dynamically dole that memory out to virtual machines running on the host, based on current workload needs.\n\nFor a technical overview of the new Dynamic Memory feature, download the Dynamic Memory Technical Overview whitepaper.\n\nRemoteFX Overview\n\n“We save 70 to 80 hours each month by delivering classes remotely using RemoteFX in Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1. At our billing rate of $250 an hour, that’s more than $200,000 a year.”\n\n– Rand Morimoto, President, Convergent Computing"
