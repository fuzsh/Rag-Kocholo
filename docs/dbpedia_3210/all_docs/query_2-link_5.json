My first post (yay).\n\nI want to re-install a server that we used to use for web filtering because all of the network settings have been changed and software installed, registry edited, etc that has been sitting around for a while doing nothing.\n\nI contacted Microsoft and they basically told me to go to a third party website because WS2003 (I guess they just take your money and once a certain period of time has passed, you can’t have the product you paid for any more), and I found this website.\n\nThere are other posts similar to this and there were some Microsoft download links but they lead to an evaluation copy that I discovered while installing\n\nDoes anyone know where to download a legal copy of Windows Server 2003 SP2 64-bit Standard edition? Or if you could send an image to me I would appreciate that a lot.\n\nThanks and have a good day,\n\n-Lewis\n\n@Microsoft\n\nCan’t have it and aren’t paying to keep providing you a copy are totally different things. You are absolutely allowed to have and use it forever. But they are not just providing a download service of it forever, that’s totally different. The product is WAY past the stated end of life when it was purchased. This isn’t a surprise or anything. Whoever deployed that nearly a decade and a half ago knew that they would not be able to continue to download it today and knew that they had to keep copies of it safe and secure to keep using it. I understand your frustration, but the tone here is a bit over the top. Microsoft has done nothing wrong and insulting them for providing it when they had no requirement to do so for many years and not long, long past when they had warned that they would not do so anymore is not okay. There is no one to blame for it not being kept at your site except for your firm. I doubt you were involved, this is an ancient problem. But don’t take it out on an innocent vendor, be made at the IT people before you and the managers who decided to not update, not follow industry and vendor guidance, not properly support the ecosystem that they chose to run and then not bother to store their backups properly given their other decisions. The sense of entitlement here really comes through."
