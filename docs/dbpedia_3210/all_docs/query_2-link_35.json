If platform support was added in an update release, the minimum update version is noted next to the check mark in the table.\n\nDeep Security Manager supports the use of older agent versions, but we do encourage customers to upgrade agents regularly. New agent releases provide additional security features and protection, higher quality, performance improvements, and updates to stay in sync with releases from each platform vendor. Each agent has an end-of-life date. For details, see Deep Security LTS life cycle dates and Deep Security FR life cycle dates.\n\nThe Deep Security Agent can be installed and is fully supported on various cloud, virtual, or physical environments, provided the operating system and kernel are supported.\n\nNot all Deep Security features are available on all platforms. See Supported features by platform.\n\nDeep Security Agent Platform Deep Security Agent Version 11.0 10.1, 10.2, or 10.3\n\nFeature release 10.0 9.6 9.0 8.0 SP2\n\nPatch 2 Windows 2000 (See Note 3) â U17 â Windows XP (32 and 64-bit) (See Note 3) â â Windows Server 2003 SP1 (32 and 64-bit) (See Note 3) â Windows Server 2003 SP2 (32 and 64-bit) (See Note 3) â Windows Server 2003 R2 SP2 (32 and 64-bit) (See Note 3) â â Windows 7 (32 and 64-bit) (See Note 3) â â¢ â â Windows Server 2008 (32 and 64-bit) (See Note 2 and Note 3) â â¢ â â Windows Server 2008 R2 (64-bit) (See Note 2 and Note 3) â â¢ â â Windows 8 (32 and 64-bit) â â¢ â â Windows 8.1 (32 and 64-bit) â â¢ â â Windows 10 (32 and 64-bit) (See Note 1) â â¢ â â Windows Server 2012 (64-bit)(See Note 2) â â¢ â â Windows Server 2012 R2 (64-bit)(See Note 2) â â¢ â â Windows Server 2016 (LTSC, version 1607) (64-bit) â â¢ â â Windows Server Core (SAC, version 1709) (64-bit) (See Note 1) â â U14 Windows Server 2019 (LTSC, version 1809) (64-bit) â U4 â U16 Windows Server 2019 (LTSC, version 1903) (64-bit) â U17 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (32 and 64-bit) â â Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 (32 and 64-bit) â â¢ â â Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (64-bit) â â¢ â â Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 (64-bit) â U12 Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (64-bit) â Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (64-bit) â Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (64-bit) â â Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (64-bit) â â¢ â â Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (64-bit)\n\nâ U2\n\nUbuntu 20.04 LTS (64-bit) (See Note 4) â U22 CentOS 5 (32 and 64-bit) â â CentOS 6 (32 and 64-bit) â â¢ â â CentOS 7 (64-bit) â â¢ â â CentOS 8 (64-bit) â U17 Debian 6 (64-bit) â Debian 7 (64-bit) â â â Debian 8 (64-bit) â â¢ â U1 Debian 9 (64-bit) â Debian 10 (64-bit) (See Note 4) â U16 Amazon Linux (64-bit) â â¢ â â Amazon Linux 2 (64-bit) (See Note 4) â â U8 Oracle Linux 5 (32 and 64-bit) â Oracle Linux 6 (32 and 64-bit) â â¢ â â Oracle Linux 7 (64-bit) â â¢ â â Oracle Linux 8 (64-bit) â U16 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 (32 and 64-bit) â â¢ â â SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 (64-bit) â â¢ â â SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 (64-bit) (See Note 4) â U13 CloudLinux 5 (32 and 64-bit) â CloudLinux 6 (32-bit) â â CloudLinux 6 (64-bit) â U6 â â CloudLinux 7 (64-bit) â â¢ â â CloudLinux 8 (64-bit) â U22 Solaris 10 Updates 4-6 (64-bit, SPARC or x86) â U6 â Solaris 10 Updates 7-10 (64-bit, SPARC or x86) â U6 â Solaris 10 Update 11 (64-bit, SPARC or x86) â U6 â â Solaris 11.0 (1111)-11.1 (64-bit, SPARC or x86) â U6 â Solaris 11.2-11.3 (64-bit, SPARC or x86) â U6 â â Solaris 11.4 (64-bit, SPARC or x86) â U7\n\nâ¢ Support for the 10.1, 10.2, and 10.3 feature releases ends six months after the release of Deep Security 11.0. For details, see Feature releases.\n\nIf platform support was added in an update release, the minimum update version is noted next to the check mark in the table. Example: â U1.\n\nNote 1: Microsoft releases regular, semi-annual releases for Microsoft Windows 10 and Windows Server Core. For details about which specific releases are supported, see Deep Security Support for Windows 10 and Deep Security Support for Windows Server Core.\n\nNote 2: Deep Security Agent is supported with both Full/Desktop Experience and Server Core installations of Windows Server 2012 and later. For Windows Server 2008 and 2008 R2, only Full installations are supported.\n\nIf Deep Security Manager 11.0 is managing 8.0 or 9.0 agents, go to Administration > System Settings > Updates, and then select Allow supported 8.0 and 9.0 Agents to be updated.\n\nNote 3: Microsoft has changed their signing policy to use only SHA-2. For information on compatibility and required Microsoft security updates, see:\n\nUpdated guidance for use of Trend Micro Deep Security to protect Windows 2003, Windows XP, and Windows 2000 based systems\n\nNew versions of Trend Micro Deep Security agents for Windows will only be signed with SHA-2 (also available in Japanese)\n\nAlso, Windows XP is supported only with Deep Security Agent 10.0 Update 25 or earlier and it will not be supported with future updates. Windows 2003 is supported with Deep Security Agent 10.0 Update 25 or earlier. It is not supported with Updates 26, 27, and 28, but support will be reintroduced in Deep Security Agent 10.0 Update 29. For more information, see Deep Security Agent version 10 update 26 cannot be used for installation or upgrade on Windows XP/2003.\n\nNote 4: Deep Security 11 does not have kernel support packages for the following kernel versions:\n\nAmazon Linux 2: 5.10.29 and later kernels\n\nUbuntu 20: 5.11.0 and later kernels\n\nDebian 10: 5.9.0 and later kernels\n\nSUSE 15: 5.3.18 and later kernels\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade to Deep Security 20 for best protection.\n\nDocker support\n\nYou can use Deep Security 10.0 or later to protect Docker hosts and containers running on Linux distributions. Windows is not supported.\n\nWith each Deep Security long-term support (LTS) release, Deep Security supports all Docker Enterprise Edition (EE) versions that have not reached end-of-life. (See Announcing Docker Enterprise Edition.) We do not officially support Docker Edge releases, but strive to test against Docker Edge releases to the best of our ability.\n\nSupport for new stable Docker releases is introduced with each release of Deep Security. We recommend that you refrain from upgrading to the latest stable release of Docker until Trend Micro documents the support statements for the latest Deep Security release.\n\nDeep Security Agent version Docker Docker CE Docker EE v1.12 v1.13 17.03 17.09 17.12 18.03 18.06 18.09 17.06 18.03 18.06 18.09 19.03 20.10 10.0 â â 11.0 â â â â â â â â â\n\nDeep Security support for Docker releases includes any sub-versions of those releases. For example, Deep Security 11.0 supports Docker 17.09-ce including its sub-versions: 17.09.0-ce and 17.09.1-ce.\n\nBefore deploying Deep Security into your target environment, you should ensure that Docker supports your target environment and platform configuration.\n\nSystemd support\n\nSome versions of the Deep Security Agent for Linux support systemd. See the table below for details.\n\nDeep Security Agent Platform Deep Security Agent 11.0 Amazon Linux (64-bit) Amazon Linux 2 (64-bit) CloudLinux 6 (64-bit) CloudLinux 7 (64-bit) Debian 8 (64-bit) Debian 9 (64-bit) Debian 10 (64-bit) âU14 Oracle Linux 6 (32- and 64-bit) Oracle Linux 7 (64-bit) âU13 Oracle Linux 8 (64-bit) âU14 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 (32- and 64-bit) Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (64-bit) âU13 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 (64-bit) âU12 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 (32- and 64-bit) SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 (64-bit) SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 (64-bit) âU13 Ubuntu 16 (64-bit) Ubuntu 18 (64-bit)\n\nIf systemd support was added in an update release, the minimum update version is noted next to the check mark in the table. Example: â U1.\n\nSecure Boot support\n\nSome versions of the Deep Security Agent support the Secure Boot feature. See the table below for details. For details on configuring the agent for Secure Boot, see Linux Secure Boot support for agents.\n\nSecure Boot is not available for AWS instances and Azure VMs.\n\nIf you are protecting VMware virtual machines, Secure Boot is available for VMware vSphere 6.5 or newer."
