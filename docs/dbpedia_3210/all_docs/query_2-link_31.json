        "text": "After a nine-month testing cycle, Microsoft finally released Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2 last night. The 32-bit, 64-bit, and Itanium editions of the update have been made available, and they can be applied to several systems including every version of Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2003 R2 and Windows Storage Server R2, Windows Unified Data Storage Server 2003 SP1, Windows Small Business Server 2003 R2, and Windows XP Professional x64.\n\nThe update includes several fixes plus a handful of new features such as Windows Deployment Services, the Windows Server 2003 Scalable Networking Pack, a tool for testing hotfixes, XmlLite, support for Wi-Fi Protected Access 2, the revamped Microsoft Management Console 3, and firewall per port authentication.\n\nAlthough the update is certainly appreciated, some have complained that Microsoft sprung this update on system administrators. Susan Bradley, who runs the SBS Diva Blog, asked why Microsoft failed to provide upfront notice that the service pack was going to appear on Windows Server Update Services, or WSUS.\n\nMicrosoft? You gave us admins a heads up before XP sp2 was Microsoft updated out to our boxes...why can't you give us a heads up on this? The MSRC blog says \"no patches\" ...and yes I understand that they don't consider a Service Pack a \"Security patch\" but anything that you vaguely hint to on that Advance notice day should be discussed fully on your blog. Right now even the Microsoft Update blog isn't blogging that SP2 is out.\n\nMicrosoft... you TELL us that's coming out before you shoot it out on Microsoft update will you?\n\nIf you would like to temporarily keep Windows Server SP2 off your boxes, Microsoft has released a toolkit which will block the delivery of the software through Automatic Updates and Windows Update.\n\nFor those that wish to download the service pack, it can be obtained through the Microsoft Download Center.\n\nWindows Server 2003 SP2 (x86)\n\nWindows Server 2003 SP2 (x64)\n\nWindows Server 2003 SP2 (Itanium)"
