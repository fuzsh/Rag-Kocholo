I know it’s only been out a couple of days, but it was a bit of surprise to find out it had already been released. Just want to make sure it doesn’t go to any untested environments.\n\nEdit : Couple of links about it…\n\nhttp://technet2.microsoft.com/WindowsServer/en/library/cda7d603-fdd6-4a48-b045-89adac6e519e1033.mspx?mfr=true\n\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=95ac1610-c232-4644-b828-c55eec605d55&DisplayLang=en\n\nCheers,"
