We did this already on one server that was 2003 R2 using DFS replication and it worked great!\n\nI know DFS didn’t come out until 2003 R2 was released. I’ve seen where people have “upgraded” Server 2003 SP1 or SP2 to 2003 R2 but wanted to make sure this was a valid upgrade path.\n\nDoes it just involve using disk 2 of 2003 R2 and running setup? Does this require a reboot of my server?\n\n2003 did support the pre-cursor to DFS replication, which uses FRS. There are gotchas to watch out for if you’re replicating over a WAN (the FRS replication is a full-file or nothing kind of replication) but as long as it’s in the LAN, you should be able to make it fairly painless.\n\nWill it affect anything on my server? This is a major file server.\n\nI plan on doing this upgrade this coming weekend. What I had read was Server 2003 R2 came with 2 discs; the first one installed Server 2003 with SP1 or 2 and the second disc was for the features that came with R2.\n\nI’ve done this upgrade several times, never had an issue. As with any major change make sure you have at backup prior just in case something goes haywire. You are correct the first disc installed server 2003 sp1 or 2 and the second disc contains R2. I’m assuming you have the media and the correct product key for r2? Is this server solely a file server or does it have other roles?\n\nGot this done late last night and it went well!! This did NOT require a reboot but I did a reboot anyway and had to call Microsoft for an activation code as none of the keys I had worked for automatic activation.\n\nThanks everyone for the help!! I highly recommend this if you are looking to migrate your file servers from 2003 to 2012(R2) and you want to take advantage of DFS."
