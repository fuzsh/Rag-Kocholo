        "text": "Starting July 15, 2015, Microsoft will end support for Windows Server 2003/R2 after 5 years of Extended Support.\n\nThis means that Microsoft will no longer develop or release any updates after ending support. To put this in perspective—37 critical updates were released in 2013 for Windows Server 2003/R2 under extended support. Imagine what impact zero updates will have on your infrastructure.\n\nMoreover, maintenance costs for aging hardware will likely increase, and you will have to deal with added costs for intrusion detection systems, more advanced firewalls, and network segmentation—all simply to isolate 2003 servers.\n\nMigrating from Windows Server 2003 is not an option — it is a necessity. Why?\n\nYou need the right compute for the right operating system\n\nNew infrastructure efficiencies enable you to innovate, adapt and unleash new business value.\n\nMitigate your risk with a modern infrastructure\n\nDo not wait. The risk inherent in running legacy infrastructure and unsupported, unsecure, and non-compliant software is too great to ignore.\n\nLeverage experience and expertize you can trust\n\nThe success of your migration depends largely on disciplined migration execution and post-migration support.\n\nYou can count on Q'NET INTERNATIONAL to help you plan, design, implement, manage and support your migration.\n\nWith, HP and Microsoft, Q’NET INTERNATIONAL provides the foundation you need to migrate with confidence.\n\nMore information:\n\nTechnical implications and how to deal with Windows Server 2003 end of life- video\n\nWindows Server 2003 is going end of life and what that means to you- video"
