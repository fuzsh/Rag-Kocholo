SharePoint Embedded containers are an abstract concept, conceptually a document library containing files and folders. Only the consuming application will have knowledge of a storage container and its’ content. Containers are isoldated from other content such as SharePoint and OneDrive. SharePoint Embedded mandates a 1:1 relationship between owning application and container type. Only approved container APIs can access a container and its associated content, with the exception of certain compliance, auditing, and Entra tooling.\n\nBuild Better Content Centric Apps with SharePoint Embedded\n\nSharePoint Embedded\n\nContent is no longer a commodity, it is currency. Data is an invaluable asset for businesses. In 2006, Clive Humby - a British mathematician - coined the phrase “data is the new oil” about the availability of both resources: neither oil nor data is valuable in its raw state; rather, value is derived when it is gathered rapidly, completely, accurately and is connected to other relevant data - and this holds true 17 years later, content is the lifeblood of your organization.\n\nThe new SharePoint Embedded Visual Code extension\n\nSharePoint Embedded\n\nWhat’s SharePoint Embedded? SharePoint Embedded is a headless platform that you can use to build and manage content-centric applications using the rich platform services of Microsoft 365. SharePoint Embedded lets you build apps and services integrating the advanced security and compliance features of Microsoft 365 (such as sensitivity, eDiscovery, retention, etc). Think of SharePoint Embedded as a container built on the Graph API that you can extend to your own apps.\n\nKick off the new year with an offer from SharePoint Premium...\n\nSharePoint Premium SharePoint SharePoint Syntex Microsoft Syntex\n\nSharePoint Premium is the next evolution of Microsoft Syntex with an emphasis on advanced content management in Microsoft 365. Read the announcement at https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/sharepoint-premium-blog/introducing-sharepoint-premium-the-future-of-ai-powered-content/ba-p/3981076. SharePoint Premium enriches, organizes, and secures content to improve Copilot experiences through services like document tagging to extract metadata from images and documents, manage and secure SharePoint sites and libraries, and protect and archive information across Microsoft 365, and more. To help you get started with pay-as-you-services as part of SharePoint Premium, a new promotional offer will be available on January 1st, 2024 that provides monthly free capacity for select SharePoint Premium services including:\n\nA quick trip around taxonomy tagging\n\nSharePoint Premium Microsoft Syntex Taxonomy Tagging Keyphrase Extraction\n\nTaxonomy Tagging What is it? Taxonomy Tagging is one of the earlier content tagging features of SharePoint Syntex (alongside image tagging), later becoming Microsoft Syntex when it transitioned to the PAYG billing model and allows you to automatically tag documents in SharePoint libraries with terms configured in the term store. Terms are stored in a managed metadata column (also known as a taxonomy column) on the item, making the documents easier to search, sort, filter, and manage.\n\nUnderstanding classifiers in Microsoft Syntex and Microsoft Purview\n\nMicrosoft Syntex Purview Information Governance\n\nEvery day, we use Outlook, Teams, SharePoint, and OneDrive to exchange important and/or sensitive information which can include financial reports and data, contracts, product information, sales reports and projections, competitive analysis, patent information, customer and employee information, etc. It’s easy to see that content is the lifeblood of an organization. BYOD (bring your own device) and remote work mean people can access their e-mail, chats, and files from just about anywhere, on any device, transforming these devices into repositories of information - and frequently it’s sensitive information that can be easily shared within and in some cases, outside of the organization.\n\nWhat's new in Microsoft Syntex\n\nMicrosoft Syntex Licensing\n\nNew in Microsoft Syntex Changes to the SharePoint Syntex (per user license) On July 1st, 2023 the SharePoint Syntex license will be retired and shift to a pay-as-you-go model with Microsoft Syntex. Microsoft Syntex is the evolution of SharePoint Syntex, which takes many of the best capabilities from SharePoint Syntex, introduces new capabilties, and puts them into a single pay-as-you-go model. PAYG is a new way to pay for Microsoft Syntex using an Azure subscription which allows you to get started without a license commmitment or upfront pricing which provides more value and greater flexibility.\n\nFile Request with Sharepoint\n\nSharePoint File Request\n\nExternal File Request is now available in Microsoft 365 for SharePoint document libraries, while OneDrive has provided this capability for a few years (see https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-onedrive-blog/onedrive-roadmap-roundup-november-2019/ba-p/1054066), this expansion now supports an easy and secure means to request files from anywhere, to include where there is not a Microsoft 365 entitlement (I.e. individuals who are not licensed for Microsoft 365). What’s a File Request? File requests can orignate by a variety of means, for example, file requests can originate through a workflow tied to a business process or a simple hyperlink.\n\nA primer on SharePoint Advanced Management\n\nSharePoint Advanced Management Purview E5\n\nAbout SharePoint Advanced Management Microsoft Syntex - SharePoint Advanced Management is a Microsoft 365 add-on that provides a suite of features that help: Manage and govern SharePoint and OneDrive Enhance Microsoft 365 secure collaboration capabilities Comparing compliance options in Microsoft 365 SharePoint Advanced Management and Microsoft 365 compliance capabilities both provide comprehensive compliance and data governance solutions to help manage risk, protect and govern sensitive data, and respond to regulatory requirements; however, differ in scope and intended audience.\n\nSetting up a Service Worker with Hugo\n\nHugo Service Worker\n\nStatic sites are fast, we all generally agree to that, but they could be faster… One way we can achieve this is through a good service worker led caching strategy, for example, pre-fetching resources that the user is likely to need in the near future, such as the next few pictures in a photo album. In this post we’ll walk through how to build out a basic service worker for a Hugo website (which is largely similar to the use of service workers in any other context).\n\nIndex and query time merging unpacked\n\nMicrosoft Search Microsoft Graph connectors Federation\n\nThe amount of information we create has grown exponentially, and more often is distributed across multiple locations, making finding the right information, at the right time, increasingly difficult. One solution to this challenge is to merge your on-premises information with your information in Microsoft 365, but occasionally business requirements, corporate and/or regulatory compliance, or other constraints may limit the ability to merge or store data in the cloud. In this post we’ll cover two examples, index-time and query-time merging.\n\nSearch notes, changes to the conversations vertical\n\nSearch Notes Microsoft Search Verticals Conversations Messages\n\nUpdates to the Conversations vertical in SharePoint, Office.com, and Microsoft Bing. Starting March 2022, there will be several upcoming changes to the ‘Conversations’ vertical in Microsoft Search. In March 2022, Conversations, as it exists, will be renamed to ‘Messages’ in Microsoft Bing (in April for Office.com) – providing results for Outlook and Teams conversations and later in July for SharePoint. Yammer conversations will be contained within the new Yammer vertical in Microsoft Bing, Office.\n\nSearch notes, custom verticals and refiners\n\nSearch Notes Microsoft Search Verticals Refiners Filters\n\nThis week we shipped custom verticals and refiners on SharePoint content worldwide. Search verticals only show results of a certain type or from certain content. Examples are Files or News. By default, Microsoft Search shows the verticals All, People, Files, Sites, and News. You can add search verticals that are relevant to your organization that represent content indexed with one or more Microsoft Graph … keep reading. Vertical and filter customization on SharePoint content allows a Microsoft Search administrator to edit out-of-the-box search verticals, such as Files, Sites, News, etc.\n\nInstalling Kali on Apple silicon with Parallels\n\nKali Linux Parallels Apple MacBook M1 macOS\n\nI wrote this post primarily as a future point of reference for getting started with Kali Linux on Apple’s silicon (with Parallels). Kali Linux is an open-source, Debian-based Linux distribution geared towards various information security tasks, such as Penetration Testing, Security Research, Computer Forensics and Reverse Engineering. You can learn more about Kali at https://kali.org. Assuming you have Parallels 16+ you can either use the free systems installer with Parallels to install Kali or optionally, for more control over Kali’s configuration and a bare bones installation, you can install Kali from an image.\n\nResetting git credentials with Atom\n\nGithub git Atom 403\n\nNOTE TO SELF Reset Atom’s personal access token Atom authenticationt to Github is through a personal access token. Personal access tokens (PATs) are an alternative to using passwords for authentication to GitHub when using the GitHub API or the command line. To reset your personal access token open the Command Pallet from Packages | Command Pallet | Toggle. Enter Github: Logout. Remove git stored credentials on the device Open Terminal and enter:\n\nSearch notes, new apis\n\nSearch Notes Microsoft Search Microsoft Graph APIs SDK\n\nNew APIs (preview) are available for Microsoft Search. These new APIs include Bookmarks and QnA. If you’re unfamiliar with Bookmarks and QnA, you can get caught up here: Answers in Microsoft Search Bookmark answers versus authoratative pages bookmark resource type A bookmark is an administrative answer in Microsoft Search results for common search queries in an organization. A bookmark has many properties which allow administrators to make common resources more accessible in their organization.\n\nSearch notes, verticals\n\nSearch Notes Microsoft Search Search\n\nSTUB Verticals A search vertical only shows results of a certain type or from certain content. Examples are Files or News. By default, Microsoft Search shows the verticals All, People, Files, Sites, and News. You can add search verticals that are relevant to your organization that represent content indexed with one or more Microsoft Graph connectors. Microsoft Graph connectors The ‘All’ vertical contains high value entities to include, but not limited to:\n\nBookmark Recommendations in Microsoft Search\n\nBookmarks Answers Microsoft Search\n\nBookmark Recommendations Bookmark Answers in Microsoft Search provide the flexibility for you to curate and promote curated resources on top of ranked results to help guide users to authoritative resources. Bookmark Answers are designed to help employee’s way find the organization and quickly identify the best and most relevant resource curated by you or your organization such as authoritative sites or documents to satisfy the searchers’ intent. Examples of Bookmark Answers can include sites, documents, or even files such as the Human Resources site, policy document, or more.\n\nAcronym Answers in Microsoft Search\n\nAnswers Acronyms Microsoft Search\n\nWhat are Answers in Microsoft Search? An Answer is a highly relevant and high confidence result that satisfies a user intent expressed as a query/question in search, presenting the most relevant information needed to get a job done and help users to faster task completion. An Answer is a way to address user intent. When searching, the user typically types in characters and keywords to express an intent. Recognizing the keywords that are triggers for specific intents is important, but it is even more important that the content that is shown in search satisfies the user intent.\n\nDemystifying Topic Answers\n\nMicrosoft Search Answers Topics\n\nSince the announcement of Microsoft Viva on February 4, 2021, I’ve come across a lot of questions and conversations surrounding Topics, specifically Topic Answers, and what a Topic Answer is… In the past I’ve posted quite a bit on Answers and their relationship to Microsoft Search, whether File Answers, Acronyms Answers, or something else - see https://wbaer.net/2020/10/making-the-most-of-answers-in-microsoft-search/. To put simply, a Topic Answer, is just one of the many forms of “Answers” generated by Microsoft Search.\n\nInstalling mkcert on Apple Silicon using brew\n\nSSL Go Apple Silicon Development\n\nOn occassion you’ll want or need to run your local development environment/site with HTTPS. For example, if your production site uses HTTPS, you may want your local development site to behave like an HTTPS site. I for one, like to aggressively diagnose any issues early in the development process before committing changes to production. Simply put, if you would like to use HTTPS with your local development site and access https://localhost or https://somedomain.\n\nAzure Machine Learning and Apple Silicon 101\n\nApple Silicon AzureML Python\n\nGetting Started This will be the first part of multi-part series on setting up an Azure Machine Learning environment on Apple Silicon. In this series we’ll evaluate webmentions using Python and Jupyter. I purposely chose this arrangement as it’s something I’ve been working on over the past several weeks here on this site. At each part of this series, I’ll explain what we’re doing, why we’re doing it, and what we hope to accomplish.\n\nTaking forward back\n\nOff Topic\n\nWow! It’s amazing to look back and realize it’s been exactly 19 years since I first registered this domain. Way back then, Opera and Netscape Navigator were the browsers of choice and many of us were still listening to the beautiful hum of our modems - animated GIFs were the equivalent of styrofoam cups…unavoidable, and Windows XP was just a few months old…perhaps most surprisingly Nickleback was leading the Billboard 100 with “How you remind me”.\n\nNow serving webmentions\n\nWebmentions Hugo Go Indie\n\nOver the course of the past several weeks as I’ve made the transition from dynamic (WordPress) to static (Hugo), I’ve been looking at ways I could not only decentralize social, but also build that overarching objective into the fabric of this site. Here enters webmention, a W3C recommendation as of January 2017. So what exactly is webmention? Well, as defined by the W3C, webmention is a simple way to notify any URL when you mention it on your site.\n\nGetting started with Lunr.js and Hugo\n\nLunrjs Hugo Go\n\nUPDATED 4/22/2022 A few months ago I posted on using Algolia Search with Hugo. As mentioned in that post, I currently use Lunr to serve the purposes of search on this site and am finally getting around to posting how to pull together the two. Lunr, unlike other search services, has no external dependencies and works either within the browser or on the server with node.js - at its core it’s a small, full-text search library for use in the browser.\n\nTransitioning from Authoratative Web Pages to Answers in SharePoint Online\n\nMicrosoft Search SharePoint Answers\n\nAs Authoratative Pages are scheduled to be deprecated in SharePoint Online, now is the time to start thinking about how to deliver similar functionality with Microsoft Search. For background, authoritative pages are those that link to the most relevant information as decided by the search administrator, specified as a URL. SharePoint search uses this list to calculate the rank of every page in the index. For example, if an administrator wanted to rank the companies HR site above ranked results, an authoratative page could be configured for https://contoso.\n\nSimple build automation with Visual Studio Code and Hugo\n\nHugo Go Visual Studio Code VSCode\n\nOver the past month or so I’ve been working more and more with Hugo as I rebuild and consolidate my old dynamic sites see https://wbaer.net/2020/12/going-static/. At the onset I had initially elected Nova App as my preferred editor of choice, but most recently have started using Visual Studio Code. With Nova I had a shell script I would run in Terminal (macOS) when developing my site, but now that I’m using Visual Studio Code I decided to use tasks.\n\nChanges to Microsoft Search in SharePoint Online (Updated 01/11/21)\n\nMicrosoft Search FQL KQL Search\n\nLast month we shared changes we’re making to Microsoft Search in SharePoint Online as we continue our journey of bringing Microsoft Search to your favorite Microsoft 365 productivity apps and services. As a result of this announcement, we’ve seen questions as to whether FQL (FAST Query Language) is being deprecated as a result of these changes. The simple answer is no, FAST Query Language is not being deprecated; however, there are some features of FAST Query Language that are being deprecated:\n\nGetting Started with Hugo and Algolia Search\n\nHugo Go Algolia\n\nThis is more or less a continuation of my previous article on moving to Hugo from Wordpress. When it comes to search and static site generators such as Hugo, there are a seemingly unlimited number of options available to you - one of most popular I researched was Lunr, and while I temporarily opted to leverage Algolia to support search on this site, I ultimately decided upon Lunr. That said, while Lunr supports my needs right now, I’m hoping someone will find some benefit out of how to use Algolia with Hugo (easily).\n\nGoing Static\n\nOpen Source Static Hugo Go lunr GitHub Utterances\n\nYou’ve probably noticed some changes around here over the last couple of days. After 15 years of maintaining my blog and 20 of maintaining this domain I’ve decided to consolidate the two - my “splash” page at wbaer.net and blog at blog.wbaer.net. For the last 15 years I’ve maintained my “technical” blog on TechNet or more recently (with the sunsetting of TechNet blogs a while ago) on Wordpress.com. Wordpress.com at the time was more or less the proverbial “path of least resistance\" since TechNet had transitioned from Telligent to WordPress several years ago - making the migration options an easy decision.\n\nImproving search relevance in Microsoft Teams\n\nMicrosoft Search Microsoft Teams Relevance Search\n\nAs we continue to ease into working remotely, search has evolved beyond its traditional perception of providing simple utilitarian value, to now serving as a proxy to person-person interactions, quick hallway conversations, and unstructured meetings – effectively search has become the “digital water cooler” for many businesses. The ability to find information in context has become increasingly important, not only because we’re more distributed, but so is information; however, you need to be able to not only discover information in context but have the assurance that the results are the most relevant to you and your task.\n\nWhat’s new with Answers in Microsoft Search\n\nAcronyms Answers Bookmarks Microsoft Search\n\nNEW FEATURE: Bookmark Recommendations (FEATURE ID: 68864) Bookmark Answers in Microsoft Search provide the flexibility for you to curate and promote curated resources on top of ranked results to help guide users to authoritative resources. Bookmark Answers are designed to help employee’s way find the organization and quickly identify the best and most relevant resource curated by you or your organization such as authoritative sites or documents to satisfy the searchers’ intent.\n\nMicrosoft Search 101\n\nMicrosoft Search Overview\n\nWhat is Microsoft Search? Microsoft Search is the evolution of search at Microsoft. Microsoft Search transforms the way people in an organization find the information they need—no matter where they are in their cloud journey. Either integrated with Microsoft 365 or as a standalone solution, Microsoft Search is a secure, easily managed, enterprise search experience that works across Microsoft 365 applications and services to deliver more relevant search results and increase productivity.\n\nShould I stay or should I go...Bookmarks vs Promoted Results\n\nAnswers Bookmarks Microsoft Search Promoted Results Query Rules\n\nWhat’s a promoted result? In brief, Promoted Results are a component of query results that allow you to promote a search result to appear above ranked results. For example, for the query “sick leave”, a query rule could specify a particular result, such as a link to a site that has a statement of company policy regarding time off work or otherwise, the promoted result link. What’s a Bookmark? Bookmarks are one of many Answers in Microsoft Search.\n\nHindsight is 360\n\nMicrosoft Life\n\nHindsight is 2020, or for me, 360. I’m humbled to be writing this post, having joined Microsoft a few short weeks before the XBOX 360 was released, just shy of 15 years ago. As a humble kid from Germany who joined Microsoft by way of Colorado - it has been an amazing journey. That journey has been amazing, challenging, and rewarding. I had a dream of becoming of a veterinarian…and in the early 1990’s that is what I had majored in - and by a strange turn of events, I ended up realizing my true passion while accidentally working at Apple (to make ends meet) in the early to mid-1990’s working as a storage engineer on the Apple Power Macintosh 7 series.\n\nMaking the most of Answers in Microsoft Search\n\nMicrosoft Search\n\nWhat are Answers in Microsoft Search? An Answer is a highly relevant and high confidence result that satisfies a user intent expressed as a query/question in search, presenting the most relevant information needed to get a job done and help users to faster task completion. An Answer is a way to address user intent. When searching, the user typically types in characters and keywords to express an intent. Recognizing the keywords that are triggers for specific intents is important, but it is even more important that the content that is shown in search satisfies the user intent.\n\nA primer in machine reading comprehension\n\nAI Microsoft Search MRC Semantic Search\n\nIf you’ve been following the various news and announcements from Microsoft on Microsoft Search at events like Build and Microsoft Ignite, you’ve probably come across a demo or two on Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC). For example, a search for “Can I bring my dog to work?” in Microsoft Search in Bing. Let’s explore what MRC is… In brief, MRC is the ability to read and understand unstructured text and then answer questions about it or effectively algorithms that can learn to answer questions about new documents with limited amounts of training data, incorporate common sense, and leverage external knowledge about the world.\n\n4 simple tips to being more productive in 2020 with AI and Cortana in Microsoft 365\n\nAI Microsoft 365 Productivity\n\nTime is our most valuable resource and with the rapid pace of work and ever expanding amount of information we need to process, it’s often hard to find time to manage our work.

Office 365 Data Loss Prevention Block Access prevents the potential for overexposure of sensitive information by allowing a Tenant administrator to configure Data Loss Prevention Policies limiting how and with whom sensitive information can be shared. For example, if a document is determined to contain sensitive information, for example U.S. Financial Data, a DLP policy can prevent that information from being shared externally or with guests while providing real-time policy information to the user attempting to initiate the share.\n\nSecurity at the Site-Collection Level in SharePoint Online\n\nAdministration Conditional Access Security &amp; Compliance Security and Compliance SharePoint\n\nBalancing security and usability are core to ensuring people can collaborate effectively without interrupting the necessary flow of information across organizations. With SharePoint Online we’ve been at work developing security and sharing controls that are scoped at the site collection level. This allows Tenant administrators to configure more restrictive controls at the site collection level, than those that are configured at the Tenant level providing a balance between the need to protect corporate information and the requirement to collaborate effectively across and outside of the corporate boundary.\n\nAccessibility in SharePoint Online\n\nAccessibility SharePoint\n\nThere are no limits to what people can achieve when technology reflects the diversity of everyone who uses it. We believe in what people make possible - at Microsoft, our mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. Across SharePoint and OneDrive our most important work is making our technology accessible to people of all abilities. Over the past several months we’ve been working towards this vision with improvements across how and where people collaborate ensuring our experiences both create and support opportunities for everyone.\n\nSite-Scoped Limited Access Policies in SharePoint Online\n\nAdministration Conditional Access Security &amp; Compliance Security and Compliance SharePoint\n\nIn March 2017 we introduced device-based policies for SharePoint and OneDrive, that enable administrators to configure Tenant-level policies. Device-based policies for SharePoint and OneDrive help administrators ensure corporate data is not leaked onto unmanaged devices such as non-domain joined or non-compliant devices by limiting access to the content to the browser, preventing files from being taken offline or synchronized with OneDrive.

In SharePoint 2013 the List View Threshold is set to 5,000 or 20,000 for users and auditors respectively. Typically a users’ initial experience with List View Threshold is when it has been exceeded, the resultant error: The number of items in this list exceeds the list view threshold, which is 5000 items” as documented at https://support.\n\nFast Site Collection Creation in SharePoint Server 2016 IT Preview\n\nFast Site Collection Creation SharePoint SharePoint Server 2016\n\nFast Site Collection Creation is a new capability in SharePoint Server 2016 IT Preview that improves Site Collection creation performance by reducing Feature activation overhead. Similar to the approach associated with MinRole Site Collections that support Fast Site Collection Creation are Feature-optimized. Fast Site Collection Creation is a mechanism designed to improve provision performance of Site Collections through instrumenting a copy operation using SPSite.Copy at the Content Database level. The primary vehicle in addressing this scenario is the enablement of a Site Master or master copy of the Site Collection for an enabled Template that provides the source Site Collection when a request is made for creating a new Site Collection.\n\nSensitive Information Types in SharePoint Server 2016 IT Preview\n\nEdiscovery SharePoint SharePoint Server 2016\n\nOne of the key improvements to eDiscovery in SharePoint Server 2016 IT Preview is the introduction on Sensitive Information Types to eDiscovery. In SharePoint Server 2016 IT Preview Data Loss Prevention is now built into Enterprise Search. It allows you to search for sensitive content in your existing eDiscovery Center, keeping content in place and enabling you to search in real time. SharePoint Server 2016 IT Preview provides a wide range of sensitive information types from different industry segments and geographies, such as credit card numbers, Social Security numbers (SSNs), bank account numbers, and other types, many of which you may already be using to search for sensitive content in email.\n\nSimplifying Hybrid Configuration with the new Hybrid Scenario Picker\n\nHybrid Hybrid and Coexistence SharePoint Server 2013\n\nThis month we continued to invest in simplifying the Office 365 and SharePoint 2013 hybrid experience with the new hybrid scenario picker available in the Office 365 Administration Center. Overview The hybrid scenario picker is designed to help customers get up and running quickly with in-market and future hybrid scenarios by providing quick access to hybrid scenarios such as OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Sites in addition to programmatically configuring hybrid prerequisites to include Server-to-Server (S2s) and OAuth connections.\n\nWhat’s new in SharePoint Server 2016 Installation and Deployment\n\nMicrosoft Ignite SharePoint SharePoint Server 2016\n\nAt Microsoft Ignite in Chicago, IL we disclosed the initial infrastructure investments we’re making in SharePoint Server 2016.

A recent #CollabTalk topic was that of the changing role of SharePoint IT…as the cloud becomes mainstream, this conversation will inevitably thrive as a broader topic that transcends SharePoint. And while change may be to exist, opportunity continues to rise – the cloud has given way to capabilities previous impossible behind the firewall, from predictive analytics to machine learning, to infinite storage, and on-demand access to content and conversations.\n\nSharePoint and Read-Only Domain Controllers (RODC)\n\nAD DS Administration RODC SharePoint SharePoint Server 2013\n\nThe question of read-only domain controllers (RODC) and SharePoint comes up frequently in conversation and on forums, whether not supported, and what potential issues can be expected if implemented with SharePoint. This article will help address some of these questions. FAQ Q: Can I use a read-only domain controller (RODC) with SharePoint 2013? A: Yes; however, there are limitations and constraints with certain operations (see below). An implementation of RODC with SharePoint should assume a writable replication partner.\n\nDocument Property Promotion and Demotion Overview and Considerations\n\nAdministration IT Pro Resources SharePoint SharePoint Server 2013\n\nOverview Document Property Promotion and Demotion is a Feature in versions of SharePoint designed to synchronize specific metadata across documents and its parent List columns and/or fields. Property promotion refers to the process of extracting values from properties of a document and writing those values to corresponding columns on the list or document library where the document is stored. Property demotion is the same process in reverse. Values are read from list columns and written to document properties.\n\nULS Viewer and SharePoint 2010\n\nAdministration SharePoint SharePoint Server 2010 ULS Viewer\n\nSo you downloaded the ULS Viewer and fired up on your SharePoint 2010 environment only to see something like this? -— System.TypeInitializationException: The type initializer for ‘UlsGump.AboutForm’ threw an exception. —> System.TypeLoadException: Could not load type ‘System.Reflection.CustomAttributeExtensions’ from assembly ‘mscorlib, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089’. at UlsGump.AboutForm..cctor() — End of inner exception stack trace — at UlsGump.MainForm.MainForm_Load(Object sender, EventArgs e) at System.Windows.Forms.Form.OnLoad(EventArgs e) at System.Windows.Forms.Control.CreateControl(Boolean fIgnoreVisible) at System.Windows.Forms.Control.CreateControl() at System.Windows.Forms.Control.WmShowWindow(Message& m) at System.\n\nImplementing Azure Blob Storage (ABS) with SQL Server 2014 and SharePoint 2013 [Updated]\n\nAdministration Hybrid and Coexistence SharePoint SharePoint Server 2013 Windows Azure\n\nOverview NOTE (8/26/2014) With any solution that externalizes the unstructured content with SharePoint you need to understand the limitations and optimal use of those solutions as documented at http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff628583(v=office.15).aspx to include related latency and performance requirements. With any application organizations face consistent key challenges such as high efficiency and business value, complex configuration, and low total cost of ownership. Extending applications to the cloud in hybrid scenarios addresses many of these challenges, whether distributing SharePoint content across on-premises and Office 365 while leveraging search as a service (hybrid search) or externalizing data, extending it to the cloud with Remote Blob Storage or related technologies.\n\nULS Viewing Like a Boss (ULS Viewer is now available)\n\nAdministration SharePoint SharePoint Server 2010 SharePoint Server 2013 ULS Viewer Unified Logging Service\n\nI’m excited to announce we’ve published a new and improved version of the ULS Viewer. About the Unified Logging Service The Unified Logging Service (ULS) is the primary logging mechanism in SharePoint to make it easier to develop applications, expose in-depth information for debugging, and vehicle to isolate problems or threshold issues when they are encountered. ULS writes events to the Trace Log and stores them in the file system.\n\nManaging Sites Pages in SharePoint Server 2013 w/ OneDrive for Business Redirection in Service Pack 1\n\nAdministration SharePoint\n\nOverview Service Pack 1 introduced new functionality that allows IT administrators to selectively redirect their users OneDrive for Business libraries to Office 365. In addition to OneDrive for Business redirection, Service Pack 1 also allows for the redirection of users Sites pages to SharePoint Online. When redirecting the Sites pages, when a user selects Sites on the navigation bar in SharePoint Server 2013 they are redirected to SharePoint Online. Since there is no affinity between content followed across SharePoint Server 2013 and SharePoint Online, users are presented only with local (SharePoint Online) content followed.\n\nOneDrive for Business Managed Deployment\n\nIT Pro Resources OneDrive for Business\n\nOverview OneDrive for Business is cloud storage for business similar to the personal experience provided by OneDrive. It’s the place where employees can store, sync, and share their files across multiple devices with ease and security. Built through the evolution of personal sites, OneDrive for Business provides the ability for an organization to provide their users enterprise grade data mobility across devices and screens and includes both a synchronization client for offline availability and simple upload experience and a Web UX to manage content through the rich capabilities of SharePoint.\n\nQuick Starting Demos and Windows PowerShell\n\nAdministration Code Samples Events Hyper-V Windows Powershell\n\nPreparing virtual machines for demonstrations can be a tedious process, compounding this is when virtual machines need to be started or shut down in a specific order. For example, starting database servers prior to starting web servers, or starting the preferred active node before the passive node. Starting those machines; however, is only a portion of the process, in most cases you will want them to be “available” before starting a subsequent machine.\n\nYammer Redirection in SharePoint Server 2013 Service Pack 1\n\nAdministration Code Samples Hybrid Service Pack 1 SharePoint SharePoint Server 2013 Yammer\n\nIn previous articles I discussed redirecting OneDrive for Business to Office 365 in SharePoint Server 2013 Service Pack 1. In addition to new functionality that allows IT administrators to redirect OneDrive for Business and Sites pages to Office 365, Service Pack 1 also allows IT administrators to activate Yammer as the default social experience for SharePoint Server 2013. When activated, the Newsfeed link in the navigation bar is replaced with a Yammer link that directs users to the organizations’ Yammer network.\n\nSharePoint 2013 and Office 365 Hybrid\n\nHybrid Hybrid and Coexistence SharePoint SharePoint Online SharePoint Server 2013\n\nThe French philosopher, Henry Bergson, once said “to exist is to change, to change is to mature, to mature is to go on creating oneself endlessly.” While the Nobel Prize winner wasn’t talking about the software and services world, the thought is extremely applicable to technology- from development to administration to use. The adoption of, and change to, cloud computing is maturing at a rapid rate…but the move needs to be thoughtful.\n\nCode Samples, Simple Translation using CSOM, REST, and Machine Translation Services\n\nCode Samples Machine Translation Services OneDrive for Business SharePoint SharePoint Server 2013\n\nMachine Translation Services is a powerful Shared Service Application in SharePoint Server 2013 that provides automation synchronous and asynchronous translation of documents, folders, and sites. The code samples in this post provide simple examples of synchronous document translation using the Client Side Object Model in managed (C#) applications and Windows PowerShell in addition to accessing Machine Translation Services via REST. CSOM The Client Side Object Model (CSOM) provides a rich alternative to earlier Web Services in providing an object-oriented system for interoperating with SharePoint data from a remote (client) machine.\n\nFile and Folder Considerations with OneDrive for Business [UPDATED 12/10/2014]\n\nAdministration Code Samples OneDrive for Business SharePoint Server 2013\n\nUpdated 8/12/2014 – Removed & as an illegal character. & character is now supported with OneDrive for Business sync client and Web UX.

Over the course of configuring these environments I found it to be easier to programmatically configure the more complex aspect (outbound infrastructure) and hopefully will be able to share the solution soon… The solution I put together is a Windows Form (makes it easy to redistribute and iterate upon), simplifies the configuration and scripting of outbound infrastructure (example below).\n\nOne-Way Outbound Hybrid Search Step-by-Step and OneDrive for Business\n\nHybrid Hybrid and Coexistence Office 365 OneDrive for Business SharePoint SharePoint Server 2013\n\nRecently we introduced a number of new coexistence scenarios in Service Pack 1 including redirection of OneDrive for Business and Yammer. Redirection of OneDrive for Business enables IT to provision cloud storage for users OneDrive for Business document libraries; however, in a hybrid scenario the content in that storage should be discoverable both on-premises and online. The most common configuration to support OneDrive for Business redirection is an outbound search topology where users can return results from both on-premises and online within the on-premises search portal.\n\nOneDrive for Business Redirection to Office 365 Overview\n\nHybrid IT Pro Resources Office 365 OneDrive for Business SharePoint SharePoint Server 2013\n\nAt the 2014 SharePoint Conference we announced the new OneDrive for Business SKU in addition to changes in Service Pack 1 functionality that enable IT administrators to selectively redirect their users to OneDrive for Business in Office 365 from SharePoint Server 2013. Planning The initial prerequisite steps to implementing OneDrive for Business redirection to Office 365 in Service Pack 1 is choosing the most effective identity management/federation options to suit your business needs.\n\nSQL Server 2014 and SharePoint Server 2013\n\nAdministration IT Pro Resources SharePoint SQL Server 2014\n\n3/21/2014 is the first full day of Spring, and the first full day of SQL Server 2014 RTM. Undoubtedly the question will be asked when will SharePoint Server 2013 support SQL Server 2014. While it remains early, SharePoint Server 2013 will support SQL Server 2014 with the April Cumulative Update. Resources SQL Server 2014 Home [http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/products/sql-server/] What’s new in SQL Server 2014 [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb500435(v=sql.120).aspx] Comments: March 2020 CU for SharePoint 2013 product family is available for download – Stefan Goßner - Mar 2, 2020\n\nQuick Starting Demos with Windows PowerShell\n\nAdministration Code Samples Events IT Pro Resources Virtualization Windows Powershell\n\nPreparing virtual machines for demonstrations can be a tedious process, compounding this is when virtual machines need to be started or shut down in a specific order. For example, starting database servers prior to starting web servers, or starting the preferred active node before the passive node. Starting those machines; however, is only a portion of the process, in most cases you will want them to be “available” before starting a subsequent machine.\n\nSharePoint Server 2013 Trial in Windows Azure [Updated]\n\nSharePoint SharePoint Server 2013 Trial Windows Azure\n\nAn updated SharePoint Server 2013 Trial image is available in the Windows Azure Platform Gallery.

The process itself differs little from the former, but worth documenting. Step 1 Suspend the Search Service On the Start menu, click All Programs. Click Microsoft SharePoint 2013 Products. Click SharePoint 2013 Management Shell. In the SharePoint 2013 Management Shell, enter the following Windows PowerShell statement to suspend the search service: $SearchService = Get-SPEnterpriseSearchServiceApplication Suspend-SPEnterpriseSearchServiceApplication -Identity $SearchService\n\nStill haven’t registered for SharePoint Conference 2014?\n\nHybrid SharePoint Conference SharePoint Conference 2014\n\nIf NLB, UPA, MMS, MDS, DEC, AAM, FIM, AAG, RBS, ALM, ECT, KPI, WIF, ACE, ACL, BDC, ULS, OWA, ECS, LOB, SID, SPN, SSO, UDF, DAV, SQL mean anything to you you’ll want to be at SPC.
