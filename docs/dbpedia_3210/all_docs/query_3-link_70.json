        "text": ".\n\nMicrosoft has had about 400,000 downloads of SP2 for 2003 so far, and they are starting to get a number of reports from customers running ISA server.\n\nHere are the specifics from a MS Blog on the subject:\n\n1. If you run ISA Server 2004 Enterprise Edition with or without the ISA Server SP2, you must install ADAM SP1 on the ISA Server Configuration Storage Server prior to installing the Windows Server 2003 SP2. ADAM SP1 can be downloaded from here. If you install Windows Server 2003 SP2 without first installing the ADAM SP1, ISA Server will not start after the installation, and you will have to uninstall Windows Server 2003 SP2. Further information is available in the Windows Server 2003 SP2 release notes, from here.\n\n2. If you run ISA Server 2000, 2004 or 2006 Standard or Enterprise editions on a multi-core / multi-processor 32-bit computer, and the CPU is heavily utilized, you might experience performance degradation in certain deployment scenarios after installing Windows Server 2003 SP2. The issue stems from a change in interrupt handling introduced in SP2. To correct the issue you must download and run the Interrupt Affinity Tool (intfiltr) available in Windows Server 2003 resource kit. You can read about installation and usage of intfiltr.exe from here.\n\n3. If your network adaptors (NICs) support receive-side scaling (RSS), then in certain NAT scenarios ISA Server 2000, 2004 or 2006 Standard or Enterprise editions might not transfer packets from one NIC to the other after installation of Windows Server 2003 SP2. To correct the issue you must disable RSS support ­­- follow the instructions from here.\n\nWe are still testing SP2 here, and have not found any issues…but it would be a good idea to test on non-production servers before deploying SP2 on your network."
