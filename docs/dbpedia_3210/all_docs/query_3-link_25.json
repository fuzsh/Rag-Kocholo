        "text": "Windows Server 2003 (sometimes referred to as Win2K3) is a server operating system produced by Microsoft, released on April 24, 2003. An updated version, Windows Server 2003 R2, was released to manufacturing on December 6, 2005. Its successor, Windows Server 2008, was released on February 4, 2008. It is based on Windows XP, basically becoming an enhanced version of XP. According to Microsoft, Windows Server 2003 is more scalable and delivers better performance than its predecessor, Windows 2000.\n\nRating: 3 out of 5 stars\n\nIf you have the need to server Web sites and need or want to use IIS this is a good fit (well was a good fit) because it didn’t require the CALs that normal versions of Windows server did. You did pay a slight premium for this up front, but saved you quite a bit on the back end. Otherwise it was like any other Windows Server, fairly stable and performs as expected.\n\nOverall Rating\n\n3 out of 5 stars\n\nWeb server, also known as the way to get a cheap server OS license for non-file/DC roles.\n\nOverall Rating\n\n3 out of 5 stars\n\nNever really saw much point in this although I did use it when learning web development. It was handy for testing out my asp code in a “live” environment. But could just as easily have used any other windows with iis.\n\nOverall Rating\n\n3 out of 5 stars"
