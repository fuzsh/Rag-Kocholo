        "text": "Jack Safrit\n\nPresident and CEO\n\nAfter spending over twelve years in private education, Jack entered the technology industry in 1987, founding Ribbons Inc. – a supplier of computer supplies. Later, after changing the name to RU Computing Inc., the company began to expand its offerings to include computer software, hardware, and services sales.\n\nIn 1996, the company officially became Axxys Technologies, Inc. – a name Jack felt better reflected the range of IT services and products provided to businesses across the region. He worked hard to create a strong, engaged, and vibrant company culture, and his efforts paid dividends; that same year, Axxys was named one of the Dallas 100 – a list of the top 100 fastest growing small businesses in the Dallas/Ft. Worth Metroplex. In 1999, Axxys acquired Netsource LLC – a local network integrator – and continued its steady growth.\n\nJack’s experiences include the creation and leadership of several businesses prior to and during his tenure at Axxys Technologies. He holds a BA degree from Southern Methodist University and started his technology career by serving as both Director of Scheduling and Director of Financial Aid at St. Mark’s School of Texas – a nationally known private college preparatory school.\n\nHis other experiences include the formation and presidency of a national educational placement and consultant firm. Axxys Technologies has distinguished itself as a premier Managed Services provider and network integrator. Jack’s leadership has taken Axxys Technologies from a small, single-person operation to a secure, mid-sized business. Because of his business development background, he is fully aware of the problems and concerns of small-to-medium sized companies. It is from his experience gained with Axxys Technologies and other businesses that the core focus of Axxys Technologies was formed.\n\nJack is currently active in Ingram Micro’s Trust X Alliance and a past representative on Cisco’s Small Business Council. Each of these groups, along with Axxys clients, lend a hand in helping him to shape the focus, vision, and direction of Axxys Technologies.\n\nTo this day, Jack’s favorite aspect of his workday is still his relationships with the people – speaking with his employees and their families, conversing with clients and vendors, and spending time trying to get to know them just a little better each day. His ultimate goal is to become a mentor and consultant to the next leadership team of Axxys Technologies, which he believes will be led by the simple fulfillment of innovative ideas.\n\nBlake Britton\n\nVice President\n\nBlake Britton entered the technology industry in 1995. His current duties at Axxys include leadership of the sales division and joint responsibility for developing and directing the vision of Axxys as a premier Managed Services and Information Security Provider.\n\nPrior to joining Axxys, Blake served as Director of Receiving at Tom Thumb/Randalls Food Markets, Inc.\n\nIn that capacity he was charged with developing IT standards around vendor relationships and corporate receiving policies. Blake also contributed to Tom Thumb/Randalls Food Markets’ development of the Direct Store Delivery System. With that responsibility, Blake was charged with implementing QA of the software and working with over 100 end users.\n\nTo continue his passion for using technology, Blake joined Axxys in 1999 to begin a new career consulting with businesses to develop and implement industry leading IT strategies. In his role at Axxys, Blake has been instrumental in helping to develop the Managed Services program, collaboration offerings, as well as the Axxys cloud offerings. Blake holds several industry sales certifications from Cisco, Microsoft, and VMware. Blake has a passion for technology and how it can enable businesses to accomplish great things. Blake has been married to his wife Michelle since 1999. They have three daughters: Bryanna, Madison, and Haley. He enjoys spending time with his family, visiting his daughters in college, playing cards, the outdoors, fly fishing, and attending live sporting events. In addition, he is an active member at First Christian Church McKinney where he is an elder in the church and has served in several leadership roles within the congregation.\n\nBlake has a BS, Business Administration & Management from University of Phoenix."
