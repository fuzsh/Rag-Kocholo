        "text": "Developer: n-Space\n\nPublisher: THQ\n\nPlatform: PlayStation\n\nReleased in US: October 31, 1998\n\nReleased in EU: November 1998\n\nThis game has unused areas.\n\nThis game has a hidden developer message.\n\nThis game has unused graphics.\n\nThis game has unused cinematics.\n\nThis game has unused music.\n\nThis game has unused sounds.\n\nThis game has a development article\n\nThe first Rugrats game. The Rugrats are on a quest to find Reptar (particularly Tommy's Reptar puzzle). You find pieces from random places by playing minigames.\n\nSub-Page\n\nDevelopment Info\n\nUnused Graphics\n\nE3 Demo Leftover\n\nE3SCR512.BS contains a leftover screen from the E3 demo version. It seems to be from a fairly early build, as the game is just called \"Rugrats 3D Adventure\" at this point.\n\nEarly Company Logos\n\nThe game has animated logos for n-Space, THQ, and Nickelodeon. These still image logos differ from the final designs. Interestingly, the Nickelodeon logo was recycled and used for the second PlayStation game, Studio Tour.\n\nUnused Music\n\nINTRO.SEP\n\nDATA\\SOUND\\SEPS\\INTRO.SEQ is a peculiar sequence that does not sound like something from Rugrats, and may be leftover from something else. It also has a duplicate called INTRO.OLD.\n\nBRAZIL.SEP\n\nBRAZIL.SEP contains two unused music sequences. Neither of these have the proper instrument data, so will be presented in their raw MIDI form.\n\nA four and a half minute long samba song based on Aquarela do Brasil.\n\nA short rendition of Stayin' Alive by The Bee Gees.\n\nRUGRATS.SEP\n\nAn unknown jazzy tune.\n\nAnother unknown jazzy tune.\n\nA rendition of Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 by Franz Liszt.\n\nAn unknown janky tune.\n\nCIRCUS.SEP\n\nAn unused tune intended for Circus Angelicus.\n\nTRIUMPH.SEP\n\nAn unfinished victory tune.\n\nUnused Voices\n\nTake 593\n\nIn DATA\\SOUND\\XA\\DB08.ISF is where all of the game's speech is. In this take, you can hear Cheryl Chase read the take number 593 at the beginning. This does not play in-game.\n\nUnused Areas\n\nThe Return of Mr. Friend\n\nAn unused level is in the game's coding, which is a sequel to The Mysterious Mr. Friend. Upon defeating Mr. Friend, he falls apart and disappears, but no cutscene plays, so you're stuck until you quit to the main menu. There are also two unused items in here; a daytime version of Tommy's Airplane, which you can see a dark version of in \"Let There Be Light\", and a push-ball-popper toy. Both items can be held and carried like normal items.\n\nBe Bad\n\nAn unused level titled \"Be Bad\" is in the game's coding (level ID 19). However, if you try to load it, the game crashes. The level ID takes place between \"Egg Hunt\" and \"No More Cookies\", both of which were minigames, which implies \"Be Bad\" was also going to be a minigame stage, versus a full level.\n\nIce Cream Mountain\n\nAnother unused level is titled \"Ice Cream Mountain\", and crashes upon loading. The final game has a separate level titled \"Ice Cream Mountain Hole One\" for the actual mini-golf minigame, so it's unknown if the original Ice Cream Mountain was going to be a full adventure stage. The unused version has a level ID that's in the same area as other adventure stages, as opposed to the minigames.\n\nUnused Videos\n\nIn DATA/OPEN are duplicates of each video, ending with a B. They are all of a black and grey rectangle that last for 7 seconds.\n\nDeveloper Messages\n\nIn one of the level folders (DB19) is a file titled \"Q.DAT\". Below are the contents.\n\n\"Bob put your teeth back in, I can't understand you!\" - DJ \"Why Stacy, You're a married Woman!\" \"So, like that means anything.....\" - Keith & Stacy \"I once had an 8:30 to 4:30 job...\" - Bob \"Why aren't the feathers working?\" \"Just sit on it, Bob.\" - DJ & Bob \"Well, everything's ok except the lobsters keep burying themselves\" \"That's normal anthropod behavior, leave it in!\" - Keith & Tim \"Is Chuckie supposed to be break dancing like that?\" - Kathleen \"I'm not blaming you, just your species\" - Keith talking to one of the Artists \"Have your bags been in your possesion all morning?\" \"Unfortunately, Yes.\" - Dan coming back from E3 \"Haven't we already done a game that stinks?\" - Scott talking about adding fragrence technology \"Do it for the children.\" - Bob \"Rugrats Racing, Rugrats Bowling, Rugrats Football; damn Look out EX Sports!\" \"No Bob, if I were trying to trick you, I'd do something much simpler\" - Woz \"Hey Scott?

I'm only working a half day today\" - Bob \"Your lips say 'No' but your scent says 'Yes'\" - Scott \"I'm serious, this time. \" - Dave \"Scott, you didn't just say beret & cool in the same sentance did you?\" - Keith \"It's not the size of the pencil, it's the size of the pen.\" - Scott \"Are we really sure about this 3d concept\" - Unknown (2 months from ship date) \"Show us puck monkeys what we need to do here\" - Bob \"What do you have to do to become a producer?\" \"Fail at everything you've ever attempt\" - Brad & Scott \"Everyone seems so defensive today\" \"You shut up!\" - Keith & Jason \"Hey Woz, why's there a puzzle piece stuck to Tommy's butt?\" \"Is this a trick question?\" - Bob & Woz \"If it involves me dressing up like Chuckie -- The answer is NO!\" - Kathleen \"Keith, if you ever get married, don't show your wife how to use ICX\" - Scott \"Dave, you're a sad little man.\" - Bob \"Bob, what universe do you live in?\" - Woz \"That's not that 3 week old pizza that was sitting by the dumpster is it?\" \"I wouldn't care....\" - Jason & Dan \"I've wasted money on stupider things, I'll go!\" - Scott \"The other thing I'd be interested in adding just before October 1st is.....\" - Bob \"Boz is looking at it with Wob.\" - Keith \"Would you like a drink with your order? -- I'm practicing...\" - Bob \"Brad, you drive like a drunk 90 year old.\" - Dave \"AAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!\" - Kathleen \"So why is mine so much slower than yours?\" \"Genetics.\" - Scott & Keith \"I like the fat one --- I like the big huge fat one.\" - DJ \"I just spent about 15 mins trying to figure out what the g'head program is.\" - Bob \"Just slap me around a little bit....\" \"Be careful what you wish for, Bob.\" - Bob & Keith \"Oh Mamma!\" - Fred \"It's my mom Bob, she says to leave me alone.\" - Kathleen \"Repitition is the mother of skill.\" \"WHAT!!??!\" - Bob & Everyone \"Gene, Shove it in your soundcard!\" - John \"I'm getting excited, where's my helmet!?\" - Jym \"Hey Bob, I fixed your wife.. I was in Darla, I took it out.\" - Scott \"So basically last week, he rewrote the entire sound code from the hardware up, What did you do for me?\" - Erick to Gene \"Keith, your posture is horrid...\" -- Chris Otto \"That isn't horrid, it's a quarter-Spencer with a twist.\" -- Erick \"Good Luck to VV, they're going to need it.\" -- John\n\nOddities\n\nThe music for the last section of \"Toy Palace\" is named MRFRIEND, indicating the track may have been originally intended for that level."
