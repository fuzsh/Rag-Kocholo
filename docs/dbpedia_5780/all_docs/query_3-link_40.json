        "text": "OK, try to remain calm, '90s and early 2000s babies, because a beloved childhood cartoon is returning to our screens: Rugrats.\n\nOn Monday, Variety reported that Nickelodeon and Paramount Pictures would be relaunching Rugrats as both a TV series and a movie, and the original creators (Arlene Klasky, Gábor Csupó and Paul Germain) are on also on board to executive produce. The TV series already has a 26-episode order. And yes, the plan is to bring back the original rugrats we know and love — including Tommy, Chuckie, Angelica, Phil, Lil, and Susie — for both formats, and there are also plans to introduce some brand new characters, too.\n\nIn a statement attached to the announcement of the Rugrats revival, Paramount Pictures president Brian Robbins remarked that \"now feels like the ideal time to reintroduce this iconic cast of characters to a whole new generation of young fans. Kids who grew up with Tommy Pickles and the Rugrats crew will now be able to share that experience with their own children.\"\n\nThere's no word yet on any plans regarding the plot for the TV series and movie, but fans are already getting excited (and making wish lists for what they want to see). Many have expressed a desire for the show to look like the original hand-animation, rather than a modernized aesthetic. While others have pointed out a timeline wrinkle, since technically the rugrat children were \"All Grown Up!\" in the spinoff that aired from 2003-2008. \"I love the Rugrats but we’ve already seen them grow up to be teenagers... now they’re going to be babies again?\" one user mentioned.\n\nSarah Levy, COO of Viacom Media Networks, told Variety, \"Rugrats is hands-down one of the most celebrated cartoons in TV history, and we are thrilled for a whole new audience to meet these iconic characters in brand-new adventures. What was true in 1991 when the original show premiered is still true today: kids are fascinated with the world of babies. We can’t wait for today’s kids to meet Tommy, Chuckie, and pals.\"\n\nThe movie is slated for Nov. 13, 2020, according to Variety; no release date for the TV series has been announced yet."
