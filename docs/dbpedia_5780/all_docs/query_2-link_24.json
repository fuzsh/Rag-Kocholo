        "text": "Aventuras en Pañales -- In Spanish\n\nLeft: Sample entries for Rugrats from the Long Island (top) and San Antonio (center & bottom) editions of TV Guide. The ones on top and center are for the Spanish version on Telemundo (in this case, WNJU ch.47 (top) and KVDA ch.60 (center)); the one on the bottom is for the original Nickelodeon version. \"Dibujos Animados\" is Spanish for a cartoon, or, literally translated, \"animated drawings\".\n\nSome editions of TV Guide lists the Spanish version by its original English name, while other editions, and many newspaper TV listings, list the show by its Spanish name -- Aventuras en Pañales.\n\n(Listings are ©1998 & 2000 by TV Guide, Inc.)\n\nAventuras en Pañales (Adventures In Diapers), the Spanish version of Rugrats, is seen daily throughout Latin America on Nickelodeon (Latin American service only), as well as many local networks (in Mexico, XHGC Canal 5 televises Rugrats; in the US, it's on Telemundo).\n\nThe following are names used for the characters in the Spanish version:\n\nEnglish Name: Spanish Name: Chuckie Finster Carlitos Baldoza Chazz Finster Carlos Baldoza (?) Stu Hugo Drew Julio Dean (from Angelica's In Love) Nikki Phil Phili / Fily Lil Lili / Lily Angelica Angélica Spike Firulais Howard Ulises Fluffy Pelusa Charlotte Carlota Didi Diddy Grandpa Abuelo Dr. Lipschitz Dr. Aquilino Dummi Bears Los Ositos Bobos Mr. Mucklehoney (from ...Baby In My Soup) Sr. Carabote Randy Carmichael Lucho Lucy Carmichael Luci Alisa Alicia Edwin Eduardo Buster Pato Paul Gatsby (from Dummi Bear Dinner Disaster) Pablo Sticky (from The Last Babysitter) Pegote Billy \"Strike\" Maxwell (from King Ten Pin) Pepe Chuzas Hector (from The Shot) Héctor The Dog Broomer (from The Dog Broomer) La estaquita de perros Ilsa (from The Dog Broomer) Lisa Clarice (From The Case Of The Missing Rugrat) Clara Ben (from Let Them Eat Cake) Alfonso / Poncho (for his friends) Elaine (from Let Them Eat Cake) Elena Satchmo (from The Legend Of Satchmo) Sasafrás Milton (Tommy's \"baby brother\"'s name from The Stork) Donato Miltonia (Angelica's \"baby sister\"'s name from The Stork) Donata Mr. Friend (from The Mysterious Mr. Friend) Señor Mambo Mr. Fiend (from The Mysterious Mr. Friend) Señor Sambo Rhonda Rags (Lil's doll from The Mysterious Mr. Friend) Altagracia The Golden Wombat (Grandpa's trophy from Naked Tommy) El Marsupial de Oro Barnaby Jones (the subject of Angelica's story in Under Chuckie's Bed) Tino Rufino Melville (from I Remember Melville) Nicanor Megan (from Cradle Attraction) Magos Dylan / Dil (from The Rugrats Movie) Dilan\n\nAs for the voices, they don't sound the same as the original, though one exception may be the Spanish voice of Chuckie (Marina Huerta), which sounds just like Christine Cavanaugh's original Chuckie voice. Also, as in the English version, the Rugrats in the Spanish version are also voiced entirely by women. Here's who played the characters in the Spanish version:\n\nCharacter: Spanish Voice: English Voice: Tommy Laura Torres E.G. Daily Chuckie Marina Huerta Christine Cavanaugh Didi Monica Manjarrez Melanie Chartoff Angelica Patricia Acevedo Cheryl Chase Phil Rosy Aguirre Kath Soucie Lil Monica Estrada (last few episodes of original 65 voiced by Rosy Aguirre; Monica returns for the new shows) Kath Soucie Susie Rocío Garcel Cree Summer Grandpa Alejandro Villeli David Doyle (1991-1998); Joe Alaskey (1998-)\n\nSide Note: In yet another connection between Rugrats and The Simpsons, Marina Huerta (Chuckie) is also the voice of Bart Simpson in the Spanish version of The Simpsons; likewise, Laura Torres (Tommy) plays Martin on Spanish Simpsons, as well as Patricia Avevedo, who's Lisa Simpson. All of the voices in the Spanish Rugrats are also voices on the Spanish Simpsons, to some capacity.\n\nAs for the titles of the episode, some of these are the same as the English version, though there may be different titles for the Spanish version (click here). In all cases, the original English title is often displayed while an announcer reads what it says in Spanish; same goes for other text elements in the show (signs, headlines, captions, etc.); this is commonplace for most foreign, non-Spanish shows seen on Mexican television.\n\nEvidentally, the dubbing of programs and movies from a foreign language to Spanish is a tough chore, but, in all animation the world over, it has to be done right. According to an interview published in Simpsons Comics (Spanish version), Laura Torres says that to do the dubbing, you have to concentrate on your voice in order to sound clearly.\n\nIn that same interview, another Rugrats/Simpsons voice (name unknown for now) is also a Rugrats fan; she was pictured wearing a Rugrats sweatshirt.\n\nFinally, an interesting point regarding Naked Tommy: this episode was seen on ZAZ, a children's cable channel on DirecTV & on Multivision's cable systems in Mexico (when ZAZ carried Rugrats before Canal 5), but was never seen on Canal 5. Original suspicions indicate that there was too much nudity in that episode. However, through the summer of 1997, Rugrats was seen on Canal 5 at 6:30PM, right after Dragon Ball, which featured more nude scenes than Rugrats; this time around, though, Rugrats and Dragon Ball Z are divided by 2 hours. (Note: Keep in mind that Dragon Ball (and other Japanese imports) are more edited for violence, nudity and innuendo in the US and Canada than versions for other countries.)\n\nThe Rugrats Comic Strip -- In Spanish\n\nSome Latin American papers are now carrying the Rugrats comic strip in Spanish. To see an example, click here.\n\nSpanish Rugrats Books\n\nSpanish versions of selected Rugrats are now available in Latin America.
