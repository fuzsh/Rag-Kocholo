        "text": "The popular 1990s US TV shows Frasier and Rugrats are both set to be rebooted for the new Paramount+ platform.\n\nFrasier starred Kelsey Grammer as a pedantic psychiatrist with his own radio show.\n\nRugrats will go from being a cartoon to a CG animation, featuring the voices of most of the original cast.\n\nGrammer confirmed his show's revival saying: \"I gleefully anticipate sharing the next chapter in the continuing journey of Dr Frasier Crane.\"\n\nThere has been no confirmation if other members of the original cast will also return.\n\nThe news was announced by ViacomCBS on Wednesday as it prepares to launch the platform, which follows in the footsteps of the likes of Disney+, in the US next month.\n\nThere is as yet no date for a UK release for the new streaming service, although popular shows could be bought up and sold on outside the US.\n\n'A call from fans'\n\nFrasier remains one of the US's most successful TV sitcoms.\n\nIt ran for 11 seasons - between 1993 and 2004 - and won 37 Emmy Awards, including five for best comedy series.\n\n\"There has long been a call from fans for its return, and that call is now answered,\" David Stapf, president of CBS Studios, said.\n\nNo date has been given for when audiences might expect to be able to watch it.\n\nDr Frasier Crane first appeared in another hit TV show, Cheers, and the spin-off series charted his return to his hometown of Seattle to care for his cranky father, played by John Mahoney who died in 2018.\n\nThe show also followed Frasier's relationships with his brother Niles, played by David Hyde Pierce, English housekeeper Daphne Moon (Jane Leeves), and Frasier's producer Roz Doyle, played by Peri Gilpin.\n\nIn January, it was announced that another hit show from the 1990s, Sex and the City, would also be returning.\n\nMeanwhile, the Nickelodeon children's cartoon Rugrats will be re-animated, quite literally, for the new platform.\n\nThe show, which ran for nine seasons, focuses on the lives of a group of toddlers. It spawned a 1998 movie, and a sequel two years later that saw the American babies head to Paris.\n\nThe TV series bagged four Daytime Emmy Awards and six Kids' Choice Awards during a 13-year run; and even has its own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nThe original characters, Tommy, Chuckie - voiced by Bart Simpson star Nancy Cartwright after Christine Cavanaugh retired in 2002 - Angelica, Susie and twins Phil and Lil will appear in the updated style later this year.\n\n\"Rugrats is one of the most iconic cartoons recognised by fans around the globe, and this original version is one we are taking great care and pride in creating for a brand new audience,\" said Ramsey Naito, president of Nickelodeon Animation.\n\n'Streaming wars'\n\nTV critic and Must Watch podcaster Scott Bryan thinks the new animated Rugrats are \"quite scary\" to be honest.\n\nHowever he told the BBC he understands why the new platform, which incorporates the pre-existing site CBS Access, would use such nostalgia as a jumping off point.\n\n\"I would say that we're having two different types of streaming wars at the moment,\" he said.\n\n\"There's the streaming war with new content - spending hundreds and hundreds of millions of pounds for the new shows to get people to subscribe to your service. But at the same time, there's a streaming bidding war for all of these shows that are amazingly successful because people now re-watch them time and time again, or get into them for the very first time.\"\n\nAllow Twitter content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .
