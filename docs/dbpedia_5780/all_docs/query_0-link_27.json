        "text": "Welcome to WatchMojo, and today we’re counting down our picks for the Top 10 Worst Things Angelica Pickles Has Done. For this list, we’ll be looking at the worst misdeeds carried out by Angelica throughout the “Rugrats” franchise. Plot points will be discussed, so beware of potential spoilers! What do you think was the worst thing Angelica ever did? Let us know in the comments.\n\n#10: Attempting to Take the Babies’ Halloween Candy\n\n“Curse of the Werewuff”\n\nWhen Angelica wants something from Tommy and his friends, she often uses fear to manipulate them into helping her. Since she’s older than they are, the babies tend to trust her because they assume she’s more knowledgeable. Well, it’s either that or they’re afraid of what will happen if they question her. In this episode, Angelica tries to convince them that they’re in danger of transforming into whatever they’re dressed as for Halloween. She then claims she could prevent this from happening if they hand over their treats. Sure, she later admits she made it up, but with this threat, Angelica shows that she’s shameless enough to literally take candy from a baby.\n\n#9: Stealing Chuckie’s Glasses\n\n“Chuckie Loses His Glasses”\n\nChuckie is the most fearful of the babies, so of course Angelica absolutely loves toying with him. During a game of hide and seek, she forces him to remove his glasses, and then purposefully steals them when he’s not looking. This puts Chuckie through undue stress and trauma, as he struggles trying to search for them in the rain, understandably getting frustrated with his inability to see. Not only is Angelica’s treatment of Chuckie sadistic, it’s also actually dangerous. Leaving the two-year-old unattended and unable to see could have easily gotten him hurt, or worse.\n\n#8: Faking a Leg Injury\n\n“Angelica Breaks a Leg”\n\nIn addition to manipulating the babies, Angelica also likes to manipulate the grownups. In a bid for attention, she pretends to break her leg, getting her uncle Stu and aunt Didi to tend to her every need while they’re looking after her. Laid up, she makes excessive demands, like asking for chocolate pudding in the middle of the night. For Stu, taking care of Angelica and satisfying her demands takes its toll on him. However, at the end of the episode, Angelica has to help take care of her mom Charlotte, who’s leg is broken for real. Hopefully, that teaches her a lesson about taking advantage of others.\n\n#7: Breaking Mr. Fluffles\n\n“The Trial”\n\nMr. Fluffles is a clown-shaped lamp that Tommy really loves. When it’s found broken, Angelica suggests that they hold a trial to find the responsible party. That may sound like a good idea, but of course, she’s the one who broke it, and isn’t planning on taking the fall. So she forces her way into the role of prosecutor and tries to pin the crime on the other babies. So basically, not only does Angelica hurt Tommy by wrecking something that he loves, she then tries to wreck his friendships, too. Even when she ultimately does confess, there’s no remorse in her voice!\n\n#6: Using Humiliating Pictures for Her Website\n\n“Fools Rush In”\n\nThis entry covers an episode from “All Grown Up!,” a follow-up to “Rugrats” that depicts all the characters as teens and preteens. In it, Angelica isn’t quite the little terror she was at three years old. But don’t get us wrong, she’s still herself, and definitely isn’t above doing questionable things for selfish purposes. Case in point, in this episode, she decides to post humiliating photos of others on her website to boost traffic. One of the people she targets is her cousin Tommy. This is a stunning violation of privacy, especially when you consider how permanent something put online can be. So even after all these years, Angelica remains capable of being, well, the worst.\n\n#5: Scaring Chuckie Over a Watermelon Seed\n\n“The Inside Story”\n\nAfter Chuckie accidentally swallows a watermelon seed, he’s worried he’s made a fatal mistake. Angelica does nothing to ease his mind, scaring him with the urban legend that says swallowing the fruit’s seed will cause it to grow and explode. Even though she seemingly believes it, it’s a horrible thing to make a child worry about, especially someone as anxious as Chuckie. But she gets even more devious. Indeed, she convinces the babies they should go inside Chuckie to neutralize the seed before it goes kaboom. In reality though, she wants to make it grow. Thankfully, this evil plan only plays out in a dream (or should we say nightmare) sequence, but still!\n\n#4: Arranging for Chas to Marry Coco LaBouche\n\n“Rugrats in Paris: The Movie” (2000)\n\nThe 2000 “Rugrats” movie sees Angelica helping Coco LaBouche in her attempt to marry Chas in exchange for some favors, including getting her own parade float. The problem is Coco has a cold heart and is mean to children, so she’s not exactly a good fit to be Chas’ wife or Chuckie’s mom. But naturally, that doesn’t bother Angelica because all she cares about is what’s in it for her. It should be noted, however, that this is one of the few times where the character actually redeems herself. She feels bad about selling out Chuckie and his dad, and ultimately sets things right.\n\n#3: Lying to Tommy About Family Reunions\n\n“Family Reunion”\n\nOne sadistic hobby of Angelica’s is to fill the babies with anxiety over normal, harmless things. At a family reunion in Iowa, she tells Tommy that these events are designed for adults to take children from their parents and raise them in their homes. Think like a kid exchange of sorts. Tommy believes Angelica, especially when he misinterprets a grownup showing him affection as wanting to take him. Though Angelica originally doesn’t believe her own lie, she starts to be convinced. It just goes to show you the dangers of being dishonest, and how deception can catch up with you.\n\n#2: Stealing the Planet Atomizer\n\n“Visitors from Outer Space”\n\nAfter hearing his grandpa bring up a news story about extraterrestrials, Tommy has a strange dream. In it, he and the gang, including Angelica, find themselves aboard an alien spaceship. One of the aliens, who resembles Stu, shows off the planet atomizer he invented, explaining that it has the power to blow up, well, planets. Angelica gets her hands on the atomizer, and as you might expect, she’s reckless with it. Later, she’s seen obliterating planets with it, casually laughing at the destruction she’s leaving in her wake. We would’ve ranked this higher if it hadn't been a dream. It's so nefarious, though, that we had to include it.\n\nBefore we unveil our top pick, here are a few honorable mentions.\n\nStealing Chas’ Folk Dance CD, “Chuckie’s Wonderful Life”\n\nWhen Chuckie Thinks He Lost the CD, He Doubts His Self-Worth\n\nTelling Chuckie He’s Becoming a Rhinoceros, “Rhinoceritis”\n\nLeave Chuckie Alone!\n\nFaking Her Doll’s Ransom for Candy, “Ransom of Cynthia”\n\nAngelica Takes Advantage of the Babies’ Goodwill\n\nThrowing Tommy’s Ball Over the Fence, \"Barbecue Story\"\n\nTrying to Retrieve the Toy Puts the Gang in Danger\n\nTrying to Take Chuckie’s Teeth, “Tooth or Dare”\n\nWe Only Have One Word: Yikes!\n\n#1: Pitting Tommy Against His Friends\n\n“Tommy and the Secret Club”\n\nIn this episode, Angelica forms a secret club and holds a contest to make one of the babies a member – no more, no less. She chooses Tommy, and we find out that being part of her exclusive club isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. She’s very controlling of him, making him do everything she says, and ensuring he doesn’t talk to his other friends. This puts a strain on his bonds with Chuckie, Phil, and Lil. The way Angelica treats Tommy here illustrates how truly horrific she can be. What could be worse than messing with the babies’ adorable friendship?!"
