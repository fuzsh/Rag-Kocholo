This channel is packaged with cable systems in mind, as many satellite companies already offer both feeds of the regular Nick.\n\nNicktoons TV (The Channel)\n\n(Digital Cable)\n\nSee schedule for times, as they fluctuate from week-to-week\n\nEstablished on May 1, 2002 and based on the popular weekend block of Nicktoons, Nicktoons TV is a round-the-clock channel, featuring most, if not all, of the Nicktoons library, plus animation produced for the regional Nick channels worldwide, among other special programming and projects.\n\nUS Military Bases Overseas\n\nColor: NTSC, System \"M\" (525-lines)\n\n(Logos © American Forces Radio & Television Service.)\n\nAmerican Forces Radio & Television Service\n\n(formerly Armed Forces Radio & Television Service)\n\nSee schedule for times, as they fluctuate from week-to-week\n\nA service of the US Department of Defense and based at March Air Reserve Base near Riverside, CA (some sources may give Hollywood as its headquarters), AFRTS is a broadcaster that provides radio & TV programming to service people and their families stationed outside the continental US, usually far away from the signals of the US radio & TV networks. AFRTS is, more or less, a \"Reader's Digest\" of the airwaves -- presenting the best programming from PBS, all commercial networks, leading syndicators and the most popular cable channels (including Nickelodeon, which has a few programs on AFRTS's channels), along with some original AFRTS programming, and places them on 3 TV channels: AFN -- American Forces Network (general news, sports and entertainment), AFN Spectrum (more of the same, but mainly from cable and premium channels), AFN News, and AFN Sports (both self-explanetory). What's especially unique about these channels is that there's no paid advertising -- the commercial breaks feature only programming promos, interstitials (mini-features) and public service announcements, all related to military life for personnel and their families.\n\nRugrats is seen on AFN and Spectrum, with the AFN shows rotating with other Nicktoons. These episodes are not the same ones seen the same day back stateside on Nick. In some cases, some new episodes are seen on the AFN channels before they are seen back in the US on Nick.\n\nSome military bases, especially those in Japan, Puerto Rico and Guatanamo Bay, may also offer the US version of Nick. Also, they can watch Rugrats on the local version of Nick or the local channel that carries them.\n\nCanada:\n\n(all times Eastern (GMT - 5; PT - 3), unless specified)\n\nColor: NTSC, System \"M\" (525-lines)\n\nSeen on 3 networks; unless specified, all channels are available nationwide on ExpressVu and Star Choice satellite, and regionally on cable. On the gray market, ExpressVu is available in the continental US, northern Mexico & the northern Caribbean; as for Star Choice, YTV is also available in Alaska, Hawaii, all of Mexico and northern Central America, while VRAK.TV is available only in Canada and the northern US (until 2003, at least).\n\nYTV is the Canadian version of Nick; it presents much of the material now seen on Nick, along with other programming for all ages. Viacom does NOT own YTV; if it did, it can only own up to 20% of it, as per Canadian law. This law encourages Canadian broadcasters to set up their own cable networks. Also, this law bans most competition of cable formats, which is why YTV is available on Canadian cable systems and not Nick, as well as the reason YTV is the ONLY English-language kids network on Canadian cable.\n\nYTV also publishes Whoa! Magazine, a quarterly that features news and information about YTV favorites. Whoa! is sold at newsstands throughout Canada for C$3.00, as well as by subscription (6 issues for C$12.95 in Canada, US$12.95 in US). For details, click here.\n\nThe commercial break structure for Rugrats and other Nicktoons are different than on Nick -- on YTV, there are 3 breaks during the program -- one after the opening credits, one between stories, and another before the closing credits. In contrast, there's only one break on Nick (commercials before or after the program does not count). However, the first and second commercial breaks are rather short -- no more than a couple of minutes per break, at most. This is due to CRTC regulations that limit commercials to 12 minutes per hour; any leftover time must be used for promos, PSAs, featurettes, anything that's not paid for by a commercial sponsor.\n\nYTV is owned by Corus Entertainment (a spinoff of Shaw Communications' broadcasting and specialty channel services), which also operates Treehouse TV (for pre-schoolers) and the Canadian version of CMT, Country Music Television (country music videos & programming, under license by CBS), among other channels.\n\nAvailable on ExpressVu & Star Choice, as well as analog cable in Quebec, New Brunswick and the Ottawa area, and nationwide on Rogers Digital Choice TV and Shaw Digital cable systems, among others.\n\nTitle: Les Razmoket (Name based on \"raser la moquette\", meaning \"to rase, or crawl on, the carpet\". Les Razmoket means \"The Carpet Crawlers\", or, more precisely, \"Rugrats\".)\n\n(Left: Logo for Les Razmoket, from Gigiseb's Razmoket site; ® & © Viacom.)\n\n(Right: Canadian bi-lingual Rugrats logo, used on some Rugrats merchandise in Canada; ® & © Viacom.)\n\nVRAK.TV, a children's channel for Francophones, is generally on the air daily from 6AM ET to 10PM ET, and features Children's fare in French. VRAK.TV's schedule features programming like Hey Arnold (Hé Arnold), CatDog (Michat Michien), Inspector Gadget (Inspecteur Gadget) and Reboot (Megabogues).\n\nAll episodes of Les Razmoket on VRAK.TV are closed-captioned in French, and feature title cards and credits in French. What's interesting is that the fonts used in the titles and credits use a French comic strip-type font, rather than the child's writing font used in the English version (older episodes used generic block lettering, and no credits). Also, the translation is probably done in the SECAM color format in France (using \"blanks\" provided by Nickelodeon), then converted to NTSC and shipped to Canada, where VRAK.TV captions it before broadcasting. The voices in the French version sound more adult than the original English version.\n\nVRAK.TV is owned by Astral Media, one of Canada's leading entertainment companies; other Astral cable channels include Canal Vie, Canal D, Historia, Canal Z, Series +, Indigo Pay-Per-View, TMN and Family Channel (not related to the Fox Family Channel). This channel got its start in 1988 as Canal Famille, with broadcast hours generally from 6AM ET to 7PM or 8PM ET. On January 2, 2001, the channel was renamed VRAK.TV, with its hours expanded to 10PM ET.\n\nLeft: The Astral Media building, home of VRAK.TV and other fine Francophone channels. The building is located on W. Ste-Catherine Street in downtown Montreal, between Chomedey and Fort Streets, near the Atwater and Guy Metro (subway) stations. A vocational college and a Blockbuster Video are in the same building.\n\n(Photo taken April 2001 by the webmaster, Steve Mindykowski, while vacationing in the Montreal area.)\n\n(Left: From Mundonick.Com; © 2002 Viacom.

Also available on the gray market in Puerto Rico and the continental US.\n\n(all times Central Time (GMT - 6, ET - 1, PT + 2); times listed are for the Mexican feed)\n\nWeekdays at 11AM, 6PM & 2AM\n\nWeekends at 10:30AM, 6PM & 2AM\n\nAlso seen during Mezcla Nicktoons:\n\nWeekdays, 7AM to 8AM, 3PM to 5PM, & 11PM to 1AM\n\nWeekends, 8:30AM to 10AM, 3PM to 5PM, & 11PM to 1AM\n\nTitle: Aventuras en Pañales (\"Adventures In Diapers\")\n\nA Latin American version of Nick is on the air 24 hours a day in Latin America, covering Mexico, Central America, and South America. The service is in NTSC and PAL (525 (\"M\") & 625-line (\"N\") versions) and feature English, Spanish and Portuguese soundtracks (cable viewers only get only one soundtrack, mainly in the language of their country). There are 3 feeds of the Latin American Nick: one for Mexico, Central America & northern South America, one for Brasil and one for Argentina and southern South America, so times may vary. Satellite viewers in Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean, as well as cable viewers in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and parts of the Caribbean, can also watch Rugrats on the US version of Nick; in addition, Canadian broadcasts of Rugrats on YTV are available nationwide (and in northern Central America) on Star Choice and in Northwestern Mexico on ExpressVu.\n\nSome local networks and stations may also televise Rugrats. In Mexico, it's seen on:\n\n(Televisa & Canal 5 logos © Televisa)\n\nTelevisa XHGC Canal 5\n\n(Available over-the-air and on the Sky Mexico satellite service. Also available on the gray market in Puerto Rico and the continental US.)\n\nWeekdays at 6PM\n\nCanal 5, which features mainly children's and family programming during the day and action shows & movies at night, is one of 4 over-the-air networks operated by Latin American media conglomerate, Televisa. Many Americans may also know that Televisa is the leading supplier of programming to Univision, America's leading Spanish-language network (Televisa is a majority owner). In another interesting note, Televisa also owns 3 Fox affiliates on the Mexican side of the US / Mexico border, broadcasting for the US market (San Diego, CA and Laredo & Brownsville, TX).\n\nRugrats have been part of the Televisa family since the mid-1990s. But recently, on 7/12/1999, Canal 5 started a new 2-hour Nickelodeon block, called Ultra Tunnel 5 Nickelodeon, weeknights 6PM to 8PM. This block currently features Real Monsters at 6PM, an hour of Rugrats at 6:30PM (classics at 6:30PM, newer shows at 7PM), and Hey Arnold at 7:30PM. Future block programs will include Angry Beavers, Ren & Stimpy (another Televisa veteran), Pete & Pete, Clarissa & Allen Strange. This block is designed to present Nick shows to families that don't have Nick. Mexico is the first country in the world to offer both a Nick block and a Nick channel; in all other countries, it's either a block or a channel.\n\nAlso in the same deal, Canal 5 has picked up Blue's Clues & Animorphs, though these will be seen at other times of the day -- Animorphs probably on weekends; Blue's Clues weekday mornings (it's unclear whether they'll use the US Steve Burns version, or produce a local version, as some networks are doing).\n\nThe trouble with the Rugrats episodes on the Latin American Nick is that these episodes are repeated at a greater frequency than the US Nick or YTV. According to Carolina Hernandez T., some episodes such as Chuckie's Duckling and No Naps were televised 5 times in a 2 week period. Normally, on the US Nick, reruns of episodes produced before 1999 are seen once per month, with the 1999 shows once every 2 to 3 months. On YTV, where it's restricted to once a day weekdays, it's once every 15 to 19 weeks.\n\nDubbing for the Spanish version of Rugrats is produced by Audiomaster 3000, a Televisa subsidiary.\n\n(Left: Audiomaster 3000 logo; ® & © Televisa.)\n\nFor more information on Pañales, click here.\n\nSpecial thanks to Carolina Hernandez T.\n\nGreat Britain & Ireland: (all times GMT (ET + 5; PT + 8))\n\nColor: PAL, System \"I\" (625-lines)\n\nSeen on up to 6 networks:\n\n(Nick banner from Nick UK; ©2002 Viacom.)\n\nNickelodeon (satellite / cable)\n\nAvailable on Sky satellite, as well as nationwide cable in Britain & Ireland.\n\nSee schedule for times, as they fluctuate from week-to-week\n\n(all different episodes)\n\nNick Replay\n\nAvailable to Sky Digital satellite viewers.\n\nAll shows 1 hour later than the main channel.\n\nNick UK has the same variety of programming as the US version, plus some children's programming from the BBC.

The BBC was the first network in the world to have regularly-scheduled television service, in 1936, which lasted until 1939, when World War II forced the BBC to suspend television service. It resumed after the war, in 1945. \"The Beeb\" has produced various programs that are familiar to American audiences, including \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\", \"Dr. Who\", \"Blake's 7\", \"Red Dwarf\", \"Blackadder\", \"Absolutely Fabulous\" and, most important of all, various miniseries seen on \"Masterpiece Theatre\" and \"Mystery!\" (Both are PBS anthology series presented by WGBH -- Boston, featuring mini-series from the BBC, ITV companies, and other sources). Back in Britain, the BBC also shows BBC-produced shows exclusive to Britain or Europe, including \"Blue Peter\" and \"Top Of The Pops\", as well as imported American programming like \"Star Trek\", \"Party Of Five\", \"The Simpsons\" and, of course, \"Rugrats\".\n\nOn BBC2 in Scotland, Rugrats have also been telecasted in Gaelic, as part of BBC Scotland's Gaelic-language children's program, Dè-a-nis?

Does anyone know? Let me know about it.)\n\nNickelodeon entered South Korea on 3/1/2003, when it started broadcasting 24 hours a day on the SkyLife satellite service. All programs on Nick are seen in English, with Korean subtitles.\n\nA 6-hour Nickelodeon block is also seen daily on the JEI23TV channel in Korea, dubbed in Korean (I don't know of this is a network or an independent station). Rugrats was also originally seen in Korea on the EBS network.\n\nThe Korean version of Rugrats is called \"Ya! Rageuraech\", which is Korean for \"Oh! Rugrats\". The word \"Rageuraech\" is pronounced \"Rugrats\" -- in the Korean alphabet, the letter representing \"eu\" is silent. As for why they decided to precede the name with an \"Oh!\" is anyone's guess.\n\nRugrats episodes in English, without Korean subtitles, can be seen occasionally on AFN, available in areas close to US military bases.\n\nOf course, Rugrats may be considered to be a locally-produced program in South Korea, as much of the animation for Rugrats is produced there.\n\n(Special thanks to Juny Park and Andrew Hollingbury)\n\nIsrael (all times Tel Aviv time (GMT + 2, ET + 7, PT + 10))\n\nColor: PAL, Systems \"B\" & \"G\" (625 lines)\n\nNickelodeon\n\n(Times currently not available.

It is unknown if the shows will be dubbed and/or subtitled in Hebrew and/or Arabic. Also included on the Nick Israel schedule are Angry Beavers (Atsbonim), Ginger, CatDog, Rocket Power, SpongeBob, Thornberrys, Arnold and the Nick version of Ren & Stimpy, along with The Amanda Show, All That and Kenan & Kel.\n\nRugrats was first seen in Israel on Channel 2, when it is ptrogrammed by Keshet Broadcasting, Saturdays during the Stagadam children's block, from 8AM to 11AM. On that channel, Rugrats also joined Arnold and Beavers in that block. It left Keshet sometime in 2000 or 2001.\n\n(Special thanks to Ety Hadar)\n\nElsewhere\n\nApart from the above countries, is Rugrats playing in your country? If it is, please let me know so it can be included on this web site. Please include channel, local time, length (including commercials, if any), and the name of the show in the local language and what it means in English (if other than Rugrats). Also, if possible, let me know of the episode titles in the local language, and their literal English meaning. Finally, there is word that the opening credits (listing the writer, music, and director's credits) are removed from the foreign versions of Rugrats. It's common practice in foreign syndication, but I do not get it, since Australia, Canada, and the UK speak English, too.\n\nAny corrections? Additions? Let me know."
