        "text": "Episodes for 2003\n\nHere are the new episodes that will be featured on Rugrats during 2003. Of course, many of these episodes that feature Taffy were first seen in the US on Nick in the fall of 2002.\n\nAlso, in 2003, Rugrats will become the second-longest-running animated series on television, as a total of 171 episodes (half-hours) would already have been broadcast by the end of the year, surpassing The Flintstones' 166 shows. The Simpsons, of course, remain in first place, with over 300 shows.\n\n(Please note that the episodes listed here will not necessarily air in this order, especially in the US on Nick.)\n\nThe Rugrats go to a circus when it comes to town, courtesy of their fathers, who have gotten them tickets and backstage passes. But of course, we already know about Chuckie's fear of clowns. Angelica successfully tricks Chuckie into believing that he was a clown, due to his red hair. But, after eating a cherry snow cone, being given clown shoes by his dad, and accidentally bumping into makeup powder, he actually believes that he is a clown. However, his fears ended up becoming much more serious when he finds out that he's on centerstage -- with clowns -- in front of a live audience. Meanwhile, Angelica tries her hand at being an acrobat, a trapeze artist and a ribbon dancer, much to the ire of the real performers.\n\nNote:\n\nThe name of the acrobatic team, The Flying Gallendas, is a knockoff of the world-famous Flying Wallendas.\n\n(03-01B) [N160B] The Baby Rewards\n\nWorld TV Premiere Date: 1/28/2003 after Clown Around on Nick Australia\n\nNorth American TV Premiere Date: 1/30/2003 after Clown Around on Nick US\n\nInspired by an awards show that they watch on TV, the Rugrats put on an awards show of their own, just so they can feel \"specially special\" with their own awards -- \"toys on a plate\". But there's one problem -- which Rugrat will get which \"reward\"? Meanwhile, Stu, despite Drew's reluctance, builds a \"Stove Top Hot Washer\" on Drew's stove, resulting in the usual disasterous results.\n\nNotes:\n\n1. On the nameless awards show that Angelica and the Rugrats were watching, \"Cynthia P.I.\" (which we were introduced to in Early Retirement) won two awards, both for unknown categories.\n\n2. As for the awards in the Rugrats' own ceremony, here's who won what:\n\n\"Bestest Brother\" -- Stu (the Rugrats had his measuring tool he needed to build is washer, which he got back while buttering up Drew)\n\n\"Bestest Hair\" -- Fluffy (the Rugrats had her food dish, shich she got back after being coaxed by Angelica)\n\n\"Bestest Friend\" -- Angelica (which Susie called after finding out that Angelica did give Susie her toy back after all)\n\n\"Bestest Foot\" -- Phil (a grown-up's shoe was all that's left, after Stu's \"disaster\" interrupted the ceremony)\n\n169 (03-02A) [N167A] Baby Sale\n\nWorld TV Premiere Date: 2/26/2003 at 7:55AM on France 3 (\"Les Soldes\")\n\nAustralian TV Premiere Date: 3/18/2003 at 5PM Sydney time on Nick Australia\n\nBritish TV Premiere Date: 5/29/2003 at 3:30PM on Nicktoons TV\n\nUS TV Premiere Date: 9/20/2003 at 8:30AM on Nick\n\n(Info not available.)\n\n(03-02B) [N167B] Steve\n\nWorld TV Premiere Date: 2/26/2003 after \"Baby Sale\" on France 3 (\"Gilles\")\n\nAustralian TV Premiere Date: 3/18/2003 after \"Baby Sale\" on Nick Australia\n\nBritish TV Premiere Date: 5/29/2003 after \"Baby Sale\" on Nicktoons TV\n\nUS TV Premiere Date: 9/20/2003 after \"Baby Sale\" on Nick\n\n(Info not available.)\n\n170 (03-03A) [N168A] The Bravliest Baby\n\nWorld TV Premiere Date: 2/27/2003 at 8:15AM on France 3 (\"L'Escalade\")\n\nAustralian TV Premiere Date: 3/11/2003 at 5PM Sydney time on Nick Australia\n\nBritish TV Premiere Date: 5/30/2003 at 3PM on Nicktoons TV\n\nNorth American TV Premiere Date: 6/8/2003 at 8AM ET on YTV in Canada\n\nAt the local playground, monkey bars and a slide doubled as \"Mount Neverrest\", on the Rugrats' latest adventure. However, Tommy lost his grip and fell. While Angelica's Cynthiamobile broke his fall, he escaped uninjured, but there's one problem -- he became a fraidy cat. This led to Angelica's own test of bravery, which will determine who's the new bravest Rugrat -- or at least, see if Tommy can get his bravery back.\n\n(03-03B) [N168B] Gimme An \"A\"\n\nWorld TV Premiere Date: 2/27/2003 after \"The Bravliest Baby\" on France 3 (\"L'Exp√©rience\")\n\nAustralian TV Premiere Date: 3/11/2003 after \"The Bravliest Baby\" on Nick Australia\n\nBritish TV Premiere Date: 5/29/2003 after \"The Bravliest Baby\" on Nicktoons TV\n\nNorth American TV Premiere Date: 6/8/2003 after \"The Bravliest Baby\" on YTV in Canada\n\nAs part of her science experiment for her Child Psychology degree, Didt takes Tommy and the Rugrats to Kinyuka College, where she tries to find a way to make the Rugrats go to sleep faster, using a wind-up toy that plays lullabies. But when tests didn't work as expected, Didi tells Betty that she'll cry if she doesn't get an \"A\". This promoted the Rugrats to search the college campus for that elusive \"A\".\n\nNotes:\n\n1. This isn't the first time Tommy was used for a class assignment -- in Little Dude, Didi used Tommy to show her students how to change a diaper.\n\n2. In the US, an \"A\" is the best mark you can get for a class or test. Below \"A\", there's \"B\", then \"C\", then \"D\", with the worst mark being \"F\" (some schools use \"E\" to denote failure)."
