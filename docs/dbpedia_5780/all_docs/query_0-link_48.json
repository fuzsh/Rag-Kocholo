        "text": "Emerging data suggests that the impact of electronic media exposure on young children's cognitive and psychosocial development varies, depending upon whether the programme content is in the foreground or background. Programming that is designed for young children (child-directed), comprehensible to the child and watched by the child is referred to as “foreground” programming (1). Programming that is not produced for children (not child-directed), not comprehensible and not watched by the child is referred to as “background”. While foreground exposure is adversely associated with attention, cognition and language outcomes (2-6), background exposure interferes with parent–child interactions (7-10) and the quantity and quality of play (11-12).\n\nGiven the different impacts of foreground and background media exposure on child development outcomes, it would be useful to understand the circumstances in which children do or do not watch programming to which they are exposed. Prior studies have suggested that the child's age, whether the content of the programme is intended for a child and whether it has been chosen by the parents play a role in determining general exposure and, in particular, predict whether the child watches the programme (13-17). Limitations of prior studies have included: i) lack of a well-defined differentiation between foreground and background media exposure and ii) the use of cross-sectional study designs, in which change over time could not be assessed.\n\nIn addition, previous studies have focused primarily on patterns of media exposure in middle-income and high-income children, so we don't know whether similar factors influence patterns of media exposure in low-income populations who may be at greatest risk for adverse developmental consequences. The need to develop a better understanding of foreground and background media was recently highlighted in a study that documented that the greatest amount of background exposure occured among children under the age of two years from low-income families (18).\n\nThe gap in knowledge regarding what children watch and don't watch has complicated efforts to determine degree of exposure as well as the impact of foreground and background media exposure. We therefore sought to address this gap by studying patterns of exposure in a low-income sample of children who were followed longitudinally. We had two hypotheses. The first was that children would be more likely to watch programming as they got older and when the programming was specifically aimed at them. The second was that younger children were likely to watch a greater proportion of media that were not intended for them.\n\nResults\n\nDescriptive Data\n\nFrom 1 November 2005 to 31 October 2008, we enrolled 675 mother-newborn dyads. Of these, 527 (78 %) completed one or more media diaries and were included in in this study. Descriptive data are shown in . The majority of mothers were Spanish speaking, not born in the USA and living with a partner. Mother-child dyads who dropped out of the study before the child was two-years-old were more likely to have had mothers who were younger (p=0.02), English speaking (p<.001), born in the USA (p<.001) and have graduated high school (p=.003).\n\nTable 1\n\nMOTHERMean (SD) age, yrs27.8 (5.4)High school Graduate223(42.3%)Married or living with partner447 (84.9%)Non-US Born459 (87.1%)Spanish Language422 (80.1%)CHILDFemale268 (50.9%)First born213 (40.4%)\n\nMedia programmes\n\nThe majority of media programmes were television shows. Across all ages, less than one per cent of programmes were video games. A limited number were movies, amounting to less than five per cent for children under two-years-old and around 15% for those over the age of two. Programmes were more likely to be watched by children as they got older ( ). For example, 36-month-old children watched 90.8 % of programming to which they were exposed, compared to six-month-old infants who watched 65.5 % of programming (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) 2.01 [95 %CI 1.42-3.10]). Similarly, young child-oriented programmes were more likely to be watched (educational 93.5 %; non educational 93.3 %), than programmes intended for adults (54.4 %; young child educational vs. adult AOR 3.46 [95 % CI 2.50-4.78]; young child non–educational vs. adult AOR 4.26 [95 %CI 2.48-7.31] respectively). Programmes were more likely to be watched if the programme was turned on for the child than if it was not (AOR 12.79 [95 %CI 9.58-17.07]). In addition, within the subset of programmes that were reportedly watched sometimes or mostly, 78% of programmes watched by younger children were “sometimes” watched, compared to 64% for older children (p<.001).\n\nTable 2\n\n# programs watched/ total programs (% watched)OR (95% CI)AOR (95% CI)†Child age6 months‡715/1091 (65.5%)--14 months748/1007 (74.3%)1.53 (1.27-1.85)1.61(1.29-2.02)24 months823/960 (85.7%)3.08 (2.47-3.85)2.21 (1.70-2.87)36 months465/512 (90.8%)5.22 (3.73-7.30)2.01 (1.42-3.10)Media ContentYoung-child directed (educational)1191/1274 (93.5%)14.13 (10.70-18.67)3.46 (2.50-4.78)Young-child directed (non-educational)251/269 (93.3%)10.75 (6.77-17.06)4.26 (2.48-7.31)Older Child/Teen168/200 (84.0%)4.01 (2.76-5.83)2.26 (1.43-3.56)Unknown531/714 (74.4%)2.39 (1.95-2.92)1.49 (1.18-1.89)Adult‡599/1101(54.4%)--Program turned by parent on for the childYes1969/2043 (96.4%)23.66 (18.13-30.89)12.79 (9.58-17.07)No‡782/1527 (51.2%)--\n\nWe then looked at the relationship between child age and whether the child watched the programme for each category of media content and by whether the programme was turned on for the child ( ). We found that older children (two-years-old or greater) were more likely to watch programming across all media content categories (all p<0.01) and to watch programming that was not turned on for the child (p<.001) compared to younger children (less than two-years-old). In the sub-group analyses, children who watched more adult-directed programmes as younger children also did so when they were older (p<0.001). However, age was not a predictor of whether children watched programmes that were turned on for them, with more than 90% of such programmes being watched by the child regardless of age (p=0.12). Interestingly, the majority of the programmes that children watched that were turned on for them, were also age-appropriate (less than two-years-old: 585 of 896 programmes or 65.3 %; two years and older: 730 of 1043 programmes or 69.9 %). Limiting analyses to the 298 children who had one or more assessments at both the younger and older ages led to similar patterns of association.\n\nTable 3\n\n# (%) watched of programs exposedAge\n\n(mos)Total\n\nnumber\n\nof\n\nchildrenTotal\n\nnumber\n\nof\n\nprogramsBy media content*By whether program\n\nwas turned on by\n\nparent for the childYoung Child-\n\nEducationalYoung\n\nChild-Non\n\nEducationalOlder\n\nChild/\n\nTeenUnknownAdultYesNo64071091237/280 (84.6%)71/84 (84.5%)34/51 (66.7%)144 /216 (66.7%)229/460 (49.8%)455/489 (93.0%)260/602 (43.2%)< 2yrs143241007326/344 (94.8%)50/53 (94.3%)33/42 (78.6%)166/230 (72.2%)169/333 (50.8%)464/472 (98.3%)284/535 (53.1%)24358960398/412 (96.6%)78/80 (97.5%)55/58 (94.8%)132/161 (82.0%)154/243 (63.4%)641/660 (97.1%)182/300 (60.7%)≥ 2yrs36296512230/238 (96.6%)52/52 (100%)46/49 (93.9%)89/107 (83.2%)47/65 (72.3%)409/422 (96.9%)56/90 (62.2%)p-value†3570p<.001p=.006p<.001‡p<.001p<.001p=.12p<.001\n\nshow the proportion of media represented by programmes intended for the child (young child-directed and/or turned on for the child by the parent) in relation to child age. The analysis of programmes that had been watched ( ), showed a higher proportion of programmes that had been intended for the child, because the content was young child-directed or had been turned on by the parent. For children aged two years and older the figure was 57% of programmes and for children under this age the figure was 40% (p<.001 [AOR: 1.97; 95 %CI 1.68-2.30). A greater proportion of programmes that were neither young-child directed or turned on for the child by the parent were watched by children who were less than two-years-old (30.4%) than children who were over the age of two (16.4%; AOR = 2.19, 95 %CI 1.82-2.65). In contrast, when it came to programmes that had not been watched ( ), most programmes showed no evidence of being intended for the child regardless of age and they were watched in similar proportions by younger and older children (83.4 % vs. 81.2 %, [AOR=1.15; 95 %CI 0.74-1.77]).\n\nDiscussion\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to assess factors associated with whether children actually watch the programmes they are exposed to in their homes. Regarding our first hypothesis, programmes were more likely to be watched by children as they got older or if the programme showed evidence of being intended for the child (either with young child-directed content or with having been turned on for the child). Furthermore, as children became older, programmes were more likely to be watched across all content categories, even if they were not turned on for them. However, programmes that had been turned on for the child were frequently watched regardless of age, with the majority of programmes turned on for the child watched by both younger and older children. Regarding our second hypothesis, we found that programmes intended for the child made up a greater proportion of programmes watched by older children compared to younger children. In particular, for younger children, nearly one-third of programmes watched were not intended for the child (not young child-directed and not turned on for the child). In contrast, programmes that had not been watched were predominantly not intended for the child regardless of age.\n\nA large body of prior work has sought to better understand foreground and background media in the context of patterns of exposure by content, attention to programming by content and parental motivations in turning on programmes for the child. Regarding patterns of exposure, both early longitudinal studies and more recent cross-sectional studies have shown that exposure to different types of content change as children age beyond infancy, with the relative proportion of child-directed content increasing and the relative proportion of adult-directed content decreasing (13,15,27).\n\nRegarding attention to programming, experimental studies have found reduced attention to adult-directed programmes across the preschool period (28) and that repeated exposure, together with adult interactions, promoted attention to infant directed content (14). Finally, population-representative surveys have identified reasons that parents turn on programmes for their children, including perceived educational value, potential use as a “babysitter” to allow them to get chores done and to help the child stay quiet (15,29). Our study adds to this work by longitudinally assessing characteristics associated with whether the child watched programmes to which they had actually been exposed in the home.\n\nOur results show that there is a substantial amount of programming that was not intended for the child, but was nevertheless watched. This is important given the ubiquitous presence of television, with one-third of young children living in households in which a television is on most or all of the time (29). Young children are therefore exposed to a steady stream of media by parents that investigators may view as in the background due to adult-directed content (4,13) but nonetheless may be watched. This is concerning as adult-directed programming in older school-age children has been associated with sleep disturbances (30).\n\nFindings from this study therefore suggest the potential need to reconsider definitions of foreground and background media in very young children (1,7). In particular, the present definition of foreground media may not sufficiently account for all programming watched by children in their homes, while the present definition of background media may overestimate programming not watched by the child. While programme content and who the programme is turned on for were important predictors of what the child watched, the definition of foreground and background cannot be solely based on these criteria. Refining these definitions would be important for clinical, research and policy efforts in order to better understand consequences of media exposure and develop interventions to reduce exposure.\n\nThe primary limitation of this study relates to our determination of whether the child watched or did not watch each programme. Watching was considered present based on maternal report of “sometimes” or “often”, utilising a previously validated media exposure instrument (21, 22). However, this measure is still subject to bias, as it is based solely on maternal reports. Future study including direct observation of the child in the home would be needed to address this issue. In addition, we studied maternal intention for the programme to be watched by the child in relation to young child content that had been turned on for the child. Qualitative study would be needed to understand underlying parent decision-making processes regarding which programmes are or are not turned on for the child. We also focused on the total number of programmes and not on the duration of programmes. It may be that young children were watching more programmes that may reflect less overall time. Future analyses will look at change over time in duration of programmes watched. Another limitation of utilising reported data is that it is possible that repeated watching of episodes of the same programme could have been reported as a single programme viewing. Additionally, this data pre-dates tablet and smart phone use and it would be interesting to reassess in future study what impact these changes have had. Finally, our results are applicable to low- income, primarily Spanish-speaking families and may not be applicable to other populations.\n\nResults from this study are important and have implications for researchers, policy makers and clinicians. For researchers, findings suggest that specific details about watching need to be obtained in order to accurately distinguish between foreground and background media exposure. As they develop recommendations and guidelines, policy makers should recognise that media exposure in infants and toddlers extends well beyond young child content programming and programmes turned on for the child. Finally, clinicians should advise parents to limit all exposure of young children to media, including background media that is not intended for the child."
