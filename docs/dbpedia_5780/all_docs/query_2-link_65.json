        "text": "Rugrats Go Wild (originally titled The Rugrats Meet the Wild Thornberrys) is a 2003 American animated crossover adventure film based on the Nickelodeon animated television series Rugrats and The Wild Thornberrys.\n\nIt is the final installment of both the Rugrats and The Wild Thornberrys film series and the sequel to both the films Rugrats in Paris: The Movie and The Wild Thornberrys Movie.\n\nThe film takes place after the ninth season of Rugrats and the fifth season of The Wild Thornberrys. Christine Cavanaugh, the original voice of Chuckie Finster, was replaced by Nancy Cartwright.\n\nThe film was produced by Nickelodeon Movies and Klasky Csupoand released in theaters on June 13, 2003, by Paramount Pictures. Rugrats Go Wild grossed $55.4 million worldwide and received unfavorable reviews from critics.\n\nThe film used \"Odorama\", which allowed people to smell odors and aromas from the film using scratch and sniff cards (reminiscent of 1960s Smell-O-Vision).\n\nThe film serves as a series finale for both Rugrats and The Wild Thornberrys.\n\nPlot\n\nThe Rugrats go on an imaginary safari with Tommy impersonating Nigel Thornberry, who is his role model and spoofs his nature show; the babies and their families are about to go on vacation on the Lipschitz cruise ship. When the families arrive at the dock, they miss the Lipschitz cruise. Tommy's father, Stu, has rented a ramshackle boat which he reveals to be their real mode of transportation, and their real vacation behind their backs. The families are angered that Stu did not consult them on his plans, and soon the boat is flipped over by a rogue wave during a tropical storm. Everyone is forced to abandon the ship and board a life raft as the ship sinks. Everyone blames Stu for causing all of this and lose hope of being saved.\n\nThe next morning, they arrive on a small, seemingly uninhabited island in the South China Sea. The adults make Betty the leader after Didi forbids Stu from volunteering, much to his chagrin. On the opposite side of the island is the famous globe-trotting family, the Thornberrys out to film a clouded leopard. Tommy, Chuckie, and the rest of the kids, except for Angelica, set off to find Nigel, for they suspect he is somewhere on the island. Along the way, Chuckie gets lost and runs into the Thornberry's son Donnie, who steals Chuckie's clothes, forcing Chuckie to wear Donnie's shorts.\n\nMeanwhile, Eliza Thornberry is exploring the jungle with Darwin, her chimpanzee companion, and runs into Spike, the Pickles' dog. Since Eliza can talk to animals, Spike is heard speaking; he informs her that his babies are lost somewhere on the island. Under the impression that Spike means he is looking for puppies, Eliza and a reluctant Darwin agree to help him find them. Following a close encounter with Siri, an angry clouded leopard whom Spike believes to be just a regular domestic cat, they learn that he meant human babies.\n\nSimultaneously, Eliza's father, Nigel, finds the lost babies. He heads in their direction but ends up tumbling down a hill and suffers amnesia after a coconut falls on his head, which reverts him to his three year-old self. They encounter Siri, but Donnie fends her off; Chuckie finds him and they get back their clothes. After escaping from Siri on a high-speed pram, the gang lands in a crater. Angelica runs into Debbie Thornberry, and takes off with Debbie in the Thornberry's all-purpose mobile communication vehicle (commvee). In order to get back faster, Angelica steals the Thornberry's bathysphere, accidentally sinking the commvee in her attempt to pilot it, but manages to find and retrieve the babies and Nigel.\n\nMeanwhile, Stu, who has managed to create a working coconut radio, and the other parents run into Donnie. After chasing him down the beach, they run into Marianne Thornberry, the mother of Eliza and Debbie and the wife of Nigel. Stu's coconut radio picks up the babies, Angelica having accidentally turned on the bathysphere's radio. Angelica and Susie, while fighting for control, have crashed the bathysphere at the bottom of the ocean. Nigel hits his head in the crash and reverts back to his normal self. Stu comes up with a successful plan to raise the commvee, and Marianne then uses the automatic-retrieval system to rescue Nigel and the babies just as the air runs out.\n\nThe babies and Nigel are reunited with their respective families, with Stu being thanked and forgiven, and everyone gets on board the Lipschitz cruise. The Thornberrys join them, too, deciding that they should take a vacation, much to Debbie's delight, and Spike vows never to lose his babies again.\n\nQualities That Didn’t Go Wild:\n\nDespite the concept of a crossover between two Klasky Csupo cartoons/Nicktoons sounding pretty good on paper, it feels like it belongs to a TV-special rather than a theatrical movie.\n\nThe premise is predictable; the Rugrats get stranded on an island and they need to find a way to be rescued, with help from the Wild Thornberrys.\n\nWhat's not helping is that this movie and season 8 sped up the decline of Rugrats.\n\nThe flanderization of the Rugrats characters got sped up here:\n\nTommy himself became a wimp and the only way for him to be brave is by being with Nigel Thornberry, even though it's already established that he's the bravest Rugrat.\n\nChuckie became a side character after Donnie impersonated him and stole his clothes.\n\nPhil and Lil became even more gross and their subplot was forgotten.\n\nAngelica until she met Debbie became rudder to the babies and her singing voice got high pitched.\n\nKimi became a background character who barley serves anything to the story.\n\nThe Rugrats adults (except for Stu and Lou) are at their absolute worst in this movie, as they're careless, oblivious, and neglectful flanderization has gone too far this time, since they blame Stu for everything that goes wrong (when the only bad thing he did was scam everyone into thinking they were going on the Lipschitz Cruise), treat him like a punching bag, and their incompetence on watching their kids have been cranked up to 11 when they put all responsibly on Stu.\n\nDuring its theatrical release the movie was presented with \"Odorama\"; to summarize, \"scratch-and-sniff\" cards were given to movie-goers, and whenever an icon pops up on the screen with an item inside of it (i.e. a smelly shoe) the aforementioned movie-goers were instructed to sniff a scratch-and-sniff card with the corresponding image. At first this sounds interesting on paper, but it is not only pointless, but also disgusting.\n\nOveruse of immature comedy, especially in scenes which contain toilet humor, specifically Angelica being revealed to have pooped herself, Dil licks Phil's feet (which is.....with out a dought, one of the single grossest moments in the whole movie) and blows snot bubbles.\n\nSeveral scenes are very inappropriate for a PG-rated movie, such as:\n\nCharlotte Pickles ripping off her dress only to reveal she is wearing shorts and a saxophone theme playing after that during the sinking scene.\n\nAngelica getting her face covered in bird poop.\n\nFour of the babies removing their diapers in the boat and exposing their butts.\n\nWhile the animation is good, some of the CGI effects aren't all that great, especially the giant wave effect (although they are an improvement over the CGI vehicles in Hey Arnold! The Movie).\n\nSome parts of logic that doesn’t make sense.\n\nDebbie Thornberry uses gum to fix the Commvee, despite the fact that in reality, gum cannot stay that sticky (a fact even Stu admitted to Debbie in the scene referenced), especially in underwater.\n\nNigel is still alive after falling off a cliff, if this would have happened in real life, he could’ve died from falling off from that high.\n\nEven though the voice acting is great, Bruce Willis' performance as Spike is kinda annoying at times.\n\nThe scene with the giant wall of water is a blatant rip-off of the wave scene from The Perfect Storm.\n\nToo many pop-culture references that feel pointless and dull:\n\nStu building a coconut radio similar to Gilligan's Island.\n\nChaz's line \"We're going to need a bigger boat\", referencing Jaws.\n\nCynthia posing as the Liberty statue in sand from Planet of the Apes.\n\nAngelica has an extremely cringe-worthy singing voice and annoying song, which are both really annoying to sit through. She even butchers \"Should I Stay or Should I Go?\" by The Clash by singing over it in the Commvee with Debbie.\n\nAdding further insult is that lead vocalist and guitar player Joe Strummer died in 2002, a year before the movie's release.\n\nMost of the songs, while are decent (except for \"Island Princess\"), don't fit in with the plot and mostly come out of nowhere just to add filler and increase the running time.\n\nA lot of mean spirited moments, such as the grown ups treating Stu like a punching bag.\n\nNigel only suffers from amnesia instead of dying when he falls off a cliff, which is nonsensical.\n\nThe main antagonist Siri the Clouded Leopard, while decent, doesn't receive much screen time in the movie.\n\nThis movie lacked the emotional depth the previous two had:\n\nThe first movie had the babies lost in the woods while trying to accept a new member of the group.\n\nThe second movie, Rugrats in Paris, had Chuckie yearning for a new mom after losing his.\n\nThe Wild Thornberry's Movie had Eliza going through dangers to save her animal friends, and family.\n\nThis movie on the other hand was treated more like a mere cash grab with more emphasis on comedy.\n\nQualities That Did Go Wild:\n\nThe idea of putting two Klasky Csupo shows together in one theatrical movie is a pretty novel concept for its time, especially since shared universe movies weren't jump-started until 2008's Iron Man and more particularly 2012's The Avengers.\n\nPretty good animation, which is a nice step-up for the Rugrats franchise, despite the CGI effects not being that great and not aging well.\n\nSpike, an obviously mute character, gets a chance to speak (his voice is provided by Bruce Willis, who, prior to Rugrats Go Wild, was famous for his role as John McClane from the Die Hard franchise) and there's a good reason for it. Since this is a crossover with The Wild Thornberrys, a show known for having animals talk through magic.\n\nGood voice acting for the most part, having the entire cast from the movie's respective shows returning. Bruce Willis was a decent choice to voice Spike.\n\nSome great songs like \"Lizard Love\", performed by Aerosmith, or \"The Big Bad Cat\".\n\nIn fact, with the exception of \"Island Princess\", all of the other songs are pretty decent.\n\nThe Wild Thornberrys characters are still pretty likeable, including Siri the Leopard (despite having less screen time). Most of the Rugrats characters are still likable too, such as Tommy, Chuckie, Phil, Lil (despite the former four's flanderization still being present), Susie, Spike (who has a decent speaking voice), Fluffy, Lou & Stu (the only likable and non-flanderized Rugrats adults), Kimi and Dil (the latter two, who are surprisingly not flanderized like they usually are). Angelica is still tolerable in this film (despite her flanderization, and is not annoying for the most part, which is surprising, since she’s normally annoying most of the time). She actually helped save the Rugrats and Nigel Thornberry from the cave near the end of the movie.\n\nSusie Carmichael has a bigger role in this movie than she did in the previous two movies who only appeared in small roles as this time she tags along with the babies and Angelica on the adventure.\n\nThe ending is good as the Pickles family and the Thornberrys have fun at the Lipschitz Cruise together.\n\n“As long as the queen doesn’t sing, I’m happy.”\n\nReception\n\nRugrats Go Wild was released on June 13, 2003 and received poor reviews from critics. On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 39% based on 89 reviews, with an average rating of 5.02/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \"The Rugrats franchise has gone from fresh to formulaic.\"\n\nMetacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 38 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".\n\nAudiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A–\" on an A+ to F scale. It has also been considered to be one of the worst Nickelodeon movies of all time."
