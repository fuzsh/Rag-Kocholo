        "text": "published on 2019-05-14T06:47:26Z\n\nSo I noticed people have been looking for the original English vocaloid track everywhere, so I decided to help out. Lyrics: I think the world is so wonderful (The world is wonderful) And we only have one chance to be here So tell me why you're hurting yourself I guess I just do not understand (What's the meaning of life?) Everything I've been told I believe And yet people that I love just leave Is something bothering you a lot? (Bothering you a lot?) I think I'm old enough to understand So there's no reason to hide from me I know you said that you're not lying (And well maybe that's true) So I'll push away any doubt I have Because I know you will tell the truth (Right, Cynthia?) Welcome to my perfect world, according to Angelica It's my turn to run the show Next to Cynthia With Tommy, Chuckie, Phil and Lil, I'll never feel alone So we can play games all day long, While the earth is spinning Round and round and round and round and round and While the earth is spinning Welcome to my wonderland with new adventures everywhere As long everything's the same, I will be okay With Spike, grandpa, and baby Dil, The world will be alright, They just have to listen to me and do what I tell them, Why why why why why why? Why won't they listen? Why why why why why why? Why won't they listen? Everyone's whispering about me (What are they talking about?) Do you think I did something wrong again? Well I promise you, it wasn't me Why does everyone think that I'm blind? (I can see perfectly fine) The truth is that I've ignored the bad things I guess it's too late to do that now... Where did you go? When I needed you? (When I needed you) I'm left all alone and I need to start it over now Can't you hear me scream? I can't hold it in. (Not anymore) Who am I again? A princess? or psychopath? Welcome to my Paradise, that's slowly crumbling away, Now I've chosen to open my eyes, Will you go away? It's getting hard for me to breathe, My tears choke me to death, Maybe I should have never been brought to this earth at all, Dying, dying, dying, dying, dying, dying, Never brought here at all, Welcome to my broken heart, according to a little girl, Will this nightmare ever end? Will I be set free? The pain is eating me alive, It's so hard to admit, But there's no point in talking at all, if no-one hears me Screaming, crying, hurting, dying, suffering, wishing I could just rewind it, Backwards, backwards, backwards, backwards, backwards, backwards Now that it's rewinded Laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing, Now, my world is perfect. Now, my world is perfect. Now, my world is perfect. Now, my world is perfect. Now, my world is perfect.\n\nGenre\n\nVocaloid"
