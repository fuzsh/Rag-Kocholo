        "text": "\"Rugrats is hands-down one of the most celebrated cartoons in TV history, and we are thrilled for a whole new audience to meet these iconic characters in brand-new adventures,\" said Sarah Levy, Viacom Media Networks COO and Nickelodeon Interim President.\n\nA scene from 'Rugrats'' old episode (Screengrab from YouTube)\n\n''Rugrats' is hands-down one of the most celebrated cartoons in TV history, and we are thrilled for a whole new audience to meet these iconic characters in brand new adventures,' Viacom chief operating officer and interim Nickelodeon head Sarah Levy said.\n\n\"Rugrats\" was one of the first big original cartoon hits for the young Nickelodeon Animation Studio.\n\nThe Rugrats appear to be babies in nap pies who have the wit and wisdom of the middle-aged while the Thornberrys are a family who go into the wild looking for unusual animals.\n\nWhen their boat is hit by a huge tidal wave, the vacationing Rugrats and their parents get stranded on a deserted island.\n\n\"Rugrats Game Boy and Game Boy Color game sales exceed 1.5 million units in the U.S.\n\nRUGRATS owes its huge success to the fact that little kids are fascinated by other kids.\n\nThe studio is releasing \"Rugrats in Paris: The Movie\" on both VHS And DVD on March 27.\n\nLos Angeles' AREA project team designed the new headquarters for Klasky Csupo, the animation studio of Rugrats' fame.\n\nTeaming the fun of Nickelodeon's Rugrats characters with Warburtons classic Blackpool Milk Roll, Warburtons have developed Rugrats Soft White Sliced Bread, a unique and healthy product with bright, innovative packaging guaranteed to stand off-shelf.\n\nI'VE never been body-searched at a children's show before - but I was as I went to see Rugrats last week."
