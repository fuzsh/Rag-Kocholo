        "text": "All Emmied Up -- Not\n\nThe All Growed Up pilot was nominated for \"Outstanding Children's Program\" in the 2002 Creative Arts Emmy Awards, which were presented on Saturday, 9/14/2002. But unfortunately, they lost. For details, click here.\n\n\"To Be Continued\" -- as \"All Grown Up\"\n\nThe All Growed Up special was not only the highest rated Rugrats episode ever, it was also the highest-rated program ever on Nickelodeon, just enough to make it cable's # 1 show for the week ending 7/22/2001. And because of these ratings, you can count on the return of the tweenage Rugrats.\n\nA TV series about the tweenagers will go on the air in late 2003 -- 13 episodes have been ordered (production commenced in September 2002), and their first season will begin in 2003. However, the series will now have a gramatically-correct name -- \"All Grown Up\".\n\nFor details on the All Grown Up series, click here.\n\nAs for the special that started it all -- here are the complete details of that accomplishment, from Variety:\n\nThe Adventure Continues On A Windows PC\n\nOn 10/16/2001, a PC game based on the All Growed Up special (or a \"three-part episode airing this fall\" according to the game's producers, THQ) will be released. The computer game, for at least Windows 98 and Me, wil have Mr. Spooky's time machine turn the Rugrats into tweenagers. For more details, see my game page.\n\nThe Tweens Visit The Great White North\n\nAfter the tweenage Rugrats wowed fans throughout the US, there's nowhere else to go but up -- north, that is. About a month after the video release in the US & Canada, All Growed Up had its Canadian television debut on YTV, Rugrats' English broadcaster in Canada. YTV premiered the episode on Labour Day, Monday 9/3/2001 at 12 Noon ET.\n\nFor French-speaking viewers, \"Les Razmoket, Dix Ans Après\" made their French appearance in 2 parts on VRAK.TV -- 12/1/2001 & 12/8/2001.\n\nHere's What The Pre-Teen Rugrats Look Like\n\nAt left is the box to the upcoming All Growed Up (US) video, featuring all the Rugrats as pre-teens. At right is the cover of the \"All Growed Up\" book, with the look at the other Rugrats, 10 years older (unfortunately, Susie, Dil & Kimi aren't on the cover, though they're featured in the story.):\n\n(Both ©2001 Viacom. Video box from Amazon.Com; special thanks to Jessie G.)\n\nIn Britain and, later, Australia, the video will be known as \"Older And Bolder\"; the reason being is that there is already a Rugrats video on the market in those countries that is named \"All Growed Up\". The contents of \"Older And Bolder\" is the same as the US \"All Growed Up\"\n\nvideo. Also, the episode itself will still be called \"All Growed Up\" in the British version.\n\nHere is another \"then and now\" pose of the regular and tweenage Rugrats, minus Phil & Lil.\n\n(Left: from a British Rugrats magazine, courtesy of Dean Hall; Right: from the August 2001 Nick Magazine; both ©2001 Viacom.)\n\nPushing The Tweenage Rugrats Around\n\n(and unsuccessfully trying to keep them a secret)\n\nAre the Tweenage Rugrats the Future \"Rugrats\"?\n\n(Left: An interesting picture, a la Oprah & Ann-Margaret -- toddler Rugrats' heads on the tweenage Rugrats' bodies, based on pictures in the August 2001 Nickelodeon Magazine. © 2001 Viacom.)\n\nIn Nick's press releases for the Rugrats' 10th anniversary, it mentioned that the All Growed Up special will be a \"one time only\" special, where the Rugrats appear as tweens for one episode only.\n\nOr not.\n\nAccording to Tvinsite.com, Nickelodeon executives at the Television Critics Association tour in July 2001 mentioned that All Growed Up is actually one of three spinoff concepts proposed by Nick to keep the successful Rugrats franchise rolling. And if ratings for the All Growed Up special are any indication, look forward not only to a new series, but also to a new merchandising line based on the show. And on 7/21/2001, the loyal Rugrats fans, and the Nielsen families, have spoken. Beacuse of the ratings, it's very likely that Nick will make the tweenage Rugrats a regular part of Nick.\n\nSo much for \"one time only\".\n\nAfter all, the concept of seeing our popular charcaters at an older or younger age isn't original -- we shouldn't forget the teenage Pebbles & Bamm-Bamm (CBS, 1971-76) or, going the opposite direction, Muppet Babies (CBS, 1984-92), The Flintstone Kids (ABC, 1986-90) or A Pup Named Scooby Doo (ABC, 1988-93) -- Pebbles & Bamm-Bamm dealt with teenage versions of the popular babies from The Flintstones, while the others feature younger versions of the popular characters.\n\nAlso being proposed is another series where Angelica and Susie attend preschool. This special, to be entitled Pre-School Daze, will serve as the pilot for this proposed series.\n\nAnd the third proposed spinoff is a series featuring Susie and the Carmichael family, who will move from Anytown, California to Atlanta, Georgia in the new series. This new series, tenatively called The Carmichaels, would've been to Rugrats as The Jeffersons was to All In The Family (no, Randy won't be opening up a dry-cleaning establishment). Of course, that proposed concept wasn't new -- it was first proposed for the 1999-2000 television season, but with Nick and Klasky-Csupo deciding to concentrate on all the original-aged Rugrats, all together, that concept was shelved. A Rugrats Kwanzaa had served as a pilot for this new series, but with Pre-School Daze likely to go to series, and the original Rugrats staying in production, it would be against logic for the family to move to Atlanta.\n\nAs for what will happen to the original series when the spinoffs air? Nick plans to keep the original Rugrats series going, alongside the spinoffs. In the TV industry, anything can happen.\n\nRoll The Closing Credits\n\nFor details on some of the people that have brought this special to millions of American homes, click here."
