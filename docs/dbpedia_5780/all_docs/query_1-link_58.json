        "text": "Baby\n\nAn immature childish person. It wears diapers and whines a lot, much like old folks. Babies are considered cute by most people.\n\nBink Video\n\nA proprietary video codec (.bik/bk2 extension) developed by RAD Game Tools and used in a very large number of video games.\n\nBoard Game\n\nA board game is a game played on a mostly-static surface using markers or chits to indicate player progress. Many video game board games are based on tabletop games (Catan, Monopoly), but some, like Mario Party and Culdcept, are original designs that use board game design as a starting point.\n\nCartoon Character\n\nCartoon characters are personas from cartoons, which are animated moving sequences that are usually drawn but can be computer animated and can come from television, movies, anime or even the web. They can be humans, animals, or even things usually not thought of as living.\n\nCollectible\n\nCollectibles are items such as coins, rings, gems, packages etc. that can be gathered, usually for some kind of reward, or sometimes to simply beat a level. Often (almost too often) the source of earning achievements and trophies on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.\n\nColor Cartridges\n\nCartridges are typically one specific color for a particular console. But, on occasion, a game is released with a different color either for a limited edition, special occasion, or for marketing.\n\nCrawling\n\nCrawling is a form of locomotion in which a person lies down and uses the hands and knees to move around, or by dragging the body along the ground.\n\nCrossover\n\nA crossover occurs when a character from one franchise makes a special appearance in a game from an unrelated franchise. Some games are specifically designed to be crossovers that bring together characters from two or more franchises.\n\nDigging\n\nDigging is a strategic mechanic of many games. Digging allows the ability to unearth valuables and strategize pathways.\n\nDog\n\nA dog is an animal, of which there are estimated to be 400 million of in the world. Said to be man's best friend, they naturally appear in many video games.\n\nDouble Entendre in Game Names\n\nGames whose titles are meant to be taken more than one way.\n\nDouble Jump\n\nA double jump is the ability to jump while already in mid-air to get some extra lift. In reality, double jumps are not possible and violate fundamental laws of physics.\n\nFashion\n\nSometimes looking good is just as important as killing. From dress-up barbies games, to Dante's ever present stylish coat, fashion has its place in games.\n\nFood-Themed Stage\n\nA type of stage themed around, or made entirely out of, food - often confectionery.\n\nGames Based on Movies\n\nWhenever there's a new Pixar, superhero or Harry Potter movie they have to make one of these.\n\nGreatest Hits\n\nGreatest hits is a general term for re-releases of games which have sold a certain number of copies, as part of a program managed by the console manufacturer.\n\nHide-and-Seek\n\nA game in which the \"seeker\" covers his/her eyes while the other players try to find a good hiding spot. It is then up to the seeker to find the hiding players.\n\nHub World\n\nA hub is the central location from which a player can venture out into different areas of a game. It is often used as a clever way of masking loading between levels or worlds.\n\nKaiju\n\nKaiju is the Japanese term for monster or strange beasts, commonly associated with giant monsters such as Godzilla. Kaiju appear as enemies in games, but just as often they are controlled by the player."
