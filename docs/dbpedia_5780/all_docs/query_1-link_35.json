The animators at Hollywood-based Klasky Csupo used Alias|Wavefront's Maya to build the 3D models, then used Animo Inkworks' renderer and In a departure from the traditionally animated Rugrats television series, the film introduces two new characters, Reptar (shown here) and Robo-snail, which were created using 3D computer graphics. To seamlessly blend the 3D models into the 2D movie scenes"
