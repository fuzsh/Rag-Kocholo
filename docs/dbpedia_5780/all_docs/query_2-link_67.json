I’m excited to start working on these, because if I’m being honest, TV animation was actually a more integral part of my childhood than films were – going to the cinema was an occasional treat, but cartoons were something I could enjoy daily. I’ve been planning to explore the world of television animation from the beginning, but with so many films to get through I had to wait for the right time. I still have many more old favourites from the theatres to cover yet, but I felt it was about time to tackle my first show – and what better one to start with than Rugrats?\n\nRugrats debuted on the Nickelodeon channel in the late summer of 1991, close to thirty years ago now (scary, isn’t it?), and helped to redefine the world of children’s entertainment along with its fellow Nicktoons. It has long been one of my favourites, still holding a place in my personal top ten animated shows of all time, and I was the perfect age to enjoy its full run from beginning to end. I’m getting ahead of myself, though, because to understand where Rugrats came from, we must first look at the people and the environment that created it.\n\nIn 1982, a small animation start-up was founded in the spare room of a Los Angeles apartment by a young Hungarian-American couple, Arlene Klasky and Gábor Csupó, along with their nephew Attila. Their goal, shared by several others at the time, was to try to bring new life to the stagnant world of TV animation; by the 1980s, it had become the refuge of toy companies pumping out cheap shows designed only to sell merchandise to kids, with quality taking a back seat to profits. Animation was in the middle of a dark age, but Klasky Csupo sought to change that.\n\nAround the spring of 1988, the couple met another budding creator called Paul Germain, who was then working with them on some segments for The Tracy Ullman Show that would eventually become The Simpsons. All three of them were new parents at the time, so naturally they soon got to swapping stories about their shared experiences raising babies – and from these talks, the idea for Rugrats was born. Germain later described the situation thus; “Being disillusioned by the film business, I decided to move on and was going to be a teacher. But when Gábor found out I was leaving Gracie Films, he asked me if I would like to do development for him. I took the job and started coming up with ideas for shows.”\n\nRugrats was to be the first of these shows, with the development of the first season occupying the team into the start of the 1990s. Much of the inspiration for the stories and characters came from Germain and Klasky; the former named the protagonist after his son, Tom Germain, while the latter brought a lot of ideas to the table from her experiences with her then fifteen-month-old son Brandon.\n\nAs things progressed, Klasky inserted more and more of her personal life into Tommy’s backstory, giving him an interfaith heritage like her own and even the same Russian roots. In addition to the inspiration provided by their own kids, Germain also drew upon childhood memories of his baby brother, who he used to suspect was secretly “cognisant” and was walking and talking whenever people left the room.\n\nThe art style of the show was made deliberately rough and given a more “Eastern European” flavour to make it stand out from its generic competition of the time, while the term “rugrat” was borrowed from Naval culture, where the word was an affectionate nickname for children crawling on the rug. Tommy in his original incarnation was more like a real baby, driven by curiosity and boldly exploring whatever he could get his little hands on, with Chuckie being created later to provide a contrast as the more cautious baby. Angelica, meanwhile, was Germain’s idea, being inspired by a female bully from his own childhood (they felt a girl bully would make a refreshing change); she would later gain her own foil in the character of Susie.\n\nThe whole thing was quite a gamble – after all, on paper there were some obvious problems with the concept, namely the issue of how little a real baby is actually capable of. Would anybody really want to tune in to watch a group of infants crawling around on the floor and crying? Thankfully, the show was in talented hands, gradually acquiring a devoted fanbase thanks to its off-the-wall charm, quirky art style and relatable characters. By the middle of the decade it was a bonafide hit, developing such a strong presence that it came to be seen as one of the defining shows of the 1990s in the west. Not bad for a series with such humble beginnings – but how did it happen? Let’s bust this playpen open and find out.\n\nProduction History\n\nRugrats can trace its birth back to 1990, the year Klasky Csupo nervously submitted their pilot episode to Nickelodeon for review. The six-and-a-half minute short, which was inspired by the antics of Klasky and Csupó’s kids as well as the Beatles, was directed by Peter Chung, who also created the famous opening title sequence and would shortly make a name for himself with the MTV series Æon Flux (1991-1995).\n\nTitled Tommy Pickles and the Great White Thing, it features much rougher animation and some truly bizarre cinematography at times, with characters like Chuckie and Angelica having not even been invented yet, but it was enough to get the series off the ground. Nickelodeon tested it with an audience of children (who loved it) and producer Vanessa Coffey was particularly fond of the idea, so with that the show went into production alongside the other two original Nicktoons. (Serious respect for Ms. Coffey by the way; her part in making Nick great in the nineties should not be underestimated).\n\nThe other two shows which Rugrats would be debuting alongside were Doug and The Ren & Stimpy Show, all three of which premiered together on August 11th, 1991 (Rugrats was the middle offering, making it the second official Nicktoon in history). Both other shows would find success of their own in time, although not without controversy; Doug ended a comfortable run on Nickelodeon in 1994, only to be picked up and retooled by Disney in 1996 so they could milk it for another three years. Ren & Stimpy, meanwhile, was always known for its gross-out shock value and caused quite a ruckus before wrapping production in 1995, but its reputation has been tarnished more recently by #MeToo revelations about its creator, John Kricfalusi (which I’m not going into here).\n\nIt has to be said that production on Rugrats was not all plain sailing, either. The show was initially commissioned for three seasons which ran from 1991 to 1994, but during the making of those seasons, a divide arose between Arlene Klasky and Paul Germain’s writing team. One of the key issues seems to have been with the character of Angelica, who Klasky couldn’t stand – it seems that, as a mother, she found her awful actions too much to take and fought to put a stop to her baby-torturing. Speaking to the New Yorker, she once said, “I think she’s a bully. I never liked Angelica,” and it’s said that she never fully approved of Angelica’s character development.\n\nAngelica’s vindictiveness varied in severity depending on who was winning in this artistic tug-of-war at the time an episode was produced, with even voice actress Cheryl Chase sometimes struggling to play the terrible tyke mean enough. One writer, Steve Viksen, helped her out by suggesting that she picture Angelica as the Rugrats version of J. R. Ewing, the notoriously psychopathic oil baron from Dallas (1978-1991), but Klasky continued to have reservations about the character’s viciousness.\n\nA season one episode called The Trial proved to be a particular sticking point as Klasky now believed the babies were starting to act too old for their age, but the writers continued to resist her efforts to portray them more realistically (and I have to say, I think I’m with them on that – imagine how boring realistic babies would have been). Her husband, Csupó, would often act as the mediator in these battles between Klasky and the writers (though the latter group often “won”) and creative producer Chuck Swenson also played a major role in helping to “discipline” Klasky and Germain when their arguments were getting out of hand, keeping the show running smoothly. The stresses and strains certainly seem to have taken a toll, with Klasky and Csupó even getting a divorce in 1995, although the split was amicable enough that they were able to continue working together.\n\nIt’s been suggested by both members of the creative team and fans that Klasky was subtly satirised within the show itself, most notably in the character of Didi, who is known for being overprotective and by-the-book when it comes to her children. This seems to have been the crux of the matter – by becoming too attached to the characters, Klasky was acting too much like a mother and not enough like a writer, so determined to keep them out of trouble that she was inhibiting the dramatic stakes. Something would have to give.\n\nIn 1993, with the original 65-episode order completed, production wound down and the series was expected to conclude there. A special centred around the Jewish holiday of Passover was held back for release until 1995, with a second special focusing on Chanukah following in 1996; they would be the only two new episodes released in those years. However, what nobody had reckoned on was the sudden surge in the popularity of the series once it went into syndication – Nickelodeon found that re-runs of the show had extremely strong ratings, so they loaded their schedule with Rugrats and quickly made it a staple of every nineties kid’s childhood in the process.\n\nIn 1996 alone, Rugrats episodes apparently aired 655 times over the course of the year in various different time slots, with the saturation making it one of the year’s most-watched shows. It became clear that the fanbase would soon need new episodes to fuel their passion for Rugrats, but that would be easier said than done. In 1994, as production on the original seasons came to an end, the tensions between the staff finally came to a head and Germain left Klasky Csupo, along with most of the other writers – this even evolved into a legal dispute, with Klasky and Csupó themselves forbidden to discuss the reasons for the writers’ departure.\n\nProduction would resume on a fourth season in 1996, but by then Germain was off working on new projects like Recess, never to return. With the personal issues between Klasky and other former writers unresolved, the show went ahead with a new team, which has been frequently used by fans as the main argument to explain the perceived drop in quality of the show’s later seasons. Klasky, for her part, seemed to prefer the new arrangement, especially the changes it brought to Angelica; with the bullying toned down and personality softened, Klasky finally warmed up to the character she had once despised.\n\nWith all this behind-the-scenes drama, it’s worth taking a moment to stop and consider the bigger picture of just how much work was involved in producing a single episode. The animation was done in collaboration with the Korean studio Sunwoo Entertainment and its various subsidiaries; for the earlier seasons that meant Anivision while for the later ones it was Grimsaem, but all of these “satellite” studios would eventually be re-absorbed into Sunwoo again by the spring of 2000.\n\nIt could take up to a year of advance preparation to make an episode; first, the story had to be written and approved by Nick, with storyboarding and voice recording to follow once the plot was in place. This was followed by pre-eliminating animation and the overseas production of the main animation at Sunwoo, which then had to be shipped back over to America for editing and polishing. Even then, Klasky Csupo still had to send these “master tapes” to Nick for final approval – it sounds exhausting, certainly not the best atmosphere for all this bickering between staff members.\n\nPresumably, the process was made somewhat easier by the introduction of digital animation towards the show’s final seasons, but with 172 episodes and numerous films and specials spread across more than a decade of production, the artists must have gotten pretty burnt out at times. In its day, Rugrats broke records with its longevity, remaining Nickelodeon’s longest-running Nicktoon until as recently as 2012, when SpongeBob SquarePants surpassed it with the episode Squiditis / Demolition Doofus. I’ve talked before about whether such longevity is a good thing, but at least Rugrats got its ending eventually, even if it was overdue; that’s more than can be said for SpongeBob.\n\nSoundtrack\n\nBefore we move on, I mustn’t forget to spend a moment on the show’s distinctive soundtrack. Gábor Csupó was a fan of Mark Mothersbaugh’s music before the show began, specifically his 1988 album Muzik for Insomniaks. At that time, Mothersbaugh was best known as part of the New Wave cult band Devo from the 1970s, but recently he’d been branching out into other ventures such as his new music production company Mutato Muzika.\n\nMothersbaugh had already found some success on television with his work on Pee-Wee’s Playhouse (1986-1990) and Csupó was keen to involve him in Rugrats. His music brought a fresh and unusual atmosphere to the show which helped enormously in giving it lasting appeal; I’m sure you all remember the distinctive “bah-bah” vocalisations and wacky percussion as clearly as I do. He remained on the team from beginning to end and served as composer on all three of the films, allowing the series to retain its unique sound for its entire run.\n\nCharacter Overview\n\nRugrats featured a huge ensemble cast revolving around three different families and their friends, with still more being added in later seasons, so I’ll try hard not to let this section get out of control!\n\nYear-old Thomas Malcolm Pickles – or Tommy – was the lead baby of the show, voiced by E. G. Daily. Apparently, during one recording session she went into labour with a baby of her own but insisted on finishing the session before heading to the hospital. Now that’s dedication!\n\nAs a character, Tommy evolved a bit over the nine-season run of the show. In earlier episodes, he was somewhat closer to a real baby, defined mainly by his curiosity – he was always exploring and trying new things, usually with wonderfully disastrous results. I remember as a kid, Tommy used to irritate me to no end (probably because I was more like Chuckie and didn’t like seeing him destroying everything), but now I’m older I find his antics hilarious. Early Tommy was impulsive (like his father) and had a tendency to rush into dangerous situations, but he always had Chuckie watching his back. He was also known for his strong sense of justice, which often put him at odds with Angelica – he could be fooled by her schemes along with the others, but would always challenge her when he realised she wasn’t being fair.\n\nAs time went by, Tommy’s character was “toned down”, the selfish, “pushy” behaviour he displayed to Chuckie in early seasons was dropped and their brotherly friendship was emphasised. His recklessness was also scaled back and he would sometimes relinquish his position of leadership to Kimi, who functioned as a sort of second Tommy. Essentially, he was subject to a certain amount of Flanderization, with his rougher edges removed to leave him as a blander (but arguably more likeable) baby by the show’s end.\n\nTommy’s right-hand baby was two-year-old Charles Crandall Norbert Finster, Jr. (yeesh, what a mouthful), far better known as Chuckie. His design was based on show composer Mark Mothersbaugh, and he was initially voiced by the late Christine Cavanaugh (RIP) before her retirement in 2001, at which point she was replaced with Nancy Cartwright of The Simpsons.\n\nChuckie was Tommy’s opposite in many ways, neurotic and timid to counter Tommy’s bold, adventurous spirit. Once again, there were some changes made over time; the early Chuckie came across as more of a stick-in-the-mud who just didn’t know how to cut loose, but as seasons passed his many phobias were brought into sharper focus, making it clearer why he was so reluctant to join his friends on their adventures. As the oldest of the babies, Chuckie was the stereotypical “goody two-shoes”, a neat and orderly kid who preferred not to get in any trouble, but this would sometimes hold him back from enjoying himself.\n\nLuckily, he had Tommy and the gang to bring him out of his shell, and he would usually end up having a good time with whatever crazy plan they were running with once he allowed himself to be dragged along. The nice thing about Chuckie was that he had courage where it counted; if his friends needed him, he’d be there without a second thought, all fears forgotten. In later seasons, this loyalty was expanded into genuine brotherly love for his new sister Kimi, making him one of the few core cast members who wasn’t Flanderized too badly by the end of the series.\n\nI always sympathised with Chuckie as a kid – probably because I saw a lot of myself in him – and used to resent the way Tommy would force him into dangerous escapades, but now I’m older, I realise how much good Tommy was doing him in the long run by pushing him out into the world.\n\nTommy’s crew was rounded out by the eighteen-month-old DeVille twins, Phillip Richard Bill and Lillian Marie Jill – or Phil and Lil. These two were never quite as well-developed as Tommy and Chuckie and had less obvious personalities; the main joke in early seasons was the very fact that they were twins, which was predictably exploited for comedy from time to time as they would “swap” identities or clash over their similarities. They were best known for their love of entomophagy, which saw them eating insects and earthworms whenever they got peckish, and were generally the dirtiest of the babies.\n\nPhil was distinguished from Lil primarily by his dry, sarcastic nature, which could be played up more or less depending on the writer. Lil, by contrast, was more emotional and dramatic, but it has to be admitted that there wasn’t much more to her than that – she was the token girl until Susie and Kimi began to feature more, but then they are only babies so I suppose they’re not going to have very complex personalities. Both twins were usually more willing to go along with Tommy’s schemes than Chuckie, but they were also less loyal than him and would sometimes even side with Angelica when it suited them. Despite that, they remained good friends with the others to the end, with some of their less savoury tendencies gradually disappearing in later seasons.\n\nAs for me, I was always rather indifferent towards them. They weren’t distinctive enough for me to love or hate them, but were simply there, as much a part of the show as the Pickles’ house. While they did have their moments, there were many more interesting characters to be found elsewhere.\n\nNow we come to little miss Angelica Charlotte Pickles, one of the show’s main antagonists and arguably its most popular character. This is the girl so evil that voice actress Cheryl Chase struggled to play her nastily enough, a three-year-old terror who had all the grown-ups wrapped around her little finger and could get almost anything she wanted with a simper and a smile.\n\nMuch of Angelica’s “power” stemmed from her ability to interpret the world of the adults for the babies, with her age giving her a unique position as she could understand their “baby talk” as well as the adults’ speech. Of course, being a toddler herself she would sometimes get things wrong, but more often she would deliberately manipulate the babies by encouraging misunderstandings or exaggerating events until they were scared out of their wits. She was cruel and two-faced, presenting a butter-wouldn’t-melt façade to the adults while bullying the kids behind their backs, which was one of the main reasons Arlene Klasky couldn’t stand her. This bullying was toned down in the later seasons after the departure of the original crop of writers, with Klasky subsequently warming up to her.\n\nDespite Angelica’s often despicable actions, she was much more than just a one-note bully. The writers frequently offered “explanations” for her behaviour in their depiction of her home life, where Angelica is shown to be a spoilt only child whose parents supply her with endless amounts of material stuff to make up for their absence. While she probably doesn’t even know it, this has left her rather vulnerable and lonely, a side of her which only rarely comes to the surface but is all the more poignant when it does. Although she tormented the babies, she also stood up for them on several occasions in the face of even bigger bullies and seemed almost to view them as her friends. Her bedraggled Cynthia doll was a kind of “companion cube” who also sometimes served as a “friend” in the absence of any others, which is quite sad when you think about it.\n\nIf I’m being totally honest, I was a spoilt only child myself back then, so I could relate to Angelica more than I was perhaps supposed to. True, I got to spend more time with my parents than she did, but I certainly had moments in my childhood that I’m not proud of, so used to getting my own way that I could be downright rotten to kids who wouldn’t do what I wanted. (Although I certainly wouldn’t have tortured babies like she does!) We can only hope that she grew out of such behaviour in time, as I did.\n\nBefore we get to the other kids, let’s spend a moment on the Pickles adults. Louis Kalhern Pickles, or Grandpa Lou, was one of the most memorable, a crotchety old codger who was always being left to watch the kids despite his narcoleptic tendency to fall asleep while doing so. He was Stu’s father, a widower who presumably moved in with the family for company after his late wife, Trixie, passed away. (It may also have been to offer live-in child support).\n\nLou, like many of older generations, is less cautious and fussy than his son and daughter-in-law, more interested in teaching or entertaining the kids than how many fresh diapers he’s packed for the day. He wasn’t afraid to give them more freedom and often sparked their imagination with his stories, but of course, the flip side of this is that they were always wandering into danger because he kept falling asleep on the job. With him as a supervisor, it’s a wonder the babies were never killed! (Tommy was kidnapped at least once, for what it’s worth – “Dear Ronald Thump…”).\n\nAlso like many other old people, Lou had that habit of rambling on about the “old days,” telling endless stories about his youth in which the recurring gag involved him having to walk “fif-TEEN miles” to get anywhere. Interestingly, he’s shown to recall events as far back as 1906 on at least one occasion (Chuckie Gets Skunked), but that might have been an anomaly as it clashes with all other evidence to his age. Elsewhere, his recollections, actions and physical design suggest he’s meant to be nearer his seventies than his late eighties, with his “official” birthdate given as 1915. (Perhaps he meant to say 1916 rather than 1906 that time?)\n\nHowever old he’s meant to be, I always enjoyed Lou the most out of the adult characters, which I guess was the idea. He was also Tommy’s favourite, as he’s the most in-synch with the babies and spent more time with them than the working parents were able to, giving them a stronger dynamic than many of the other adults shared with the babies. I loved his devil-may-care attitude (he was such a drama queen, always moving out on a whim whenever problems arose at home) and the way he would just wander off when the main events weren’t interesting to him (At the Movies, Family Reunion). Grandpa Lou was a cool old man who reminded me of my own granddad, and for me, he’s up there with Grandpa Phil from Hey Arnold! as one of the best of the nineties.\n\nStuart Louis Pickles and Diane Kropotkin Kerpackter-Pickles (good grief), better known as Stu and Didi, were Tommy’s and later Dil’s parents, a pair of total opposites who often struggled to cope as they juggled their careers with their first baby. Stu was a freelance toymaker whose wild inventions often got the better of him, with many of his projects becoming victims of their own complexity – Didi, meanwhile, was a part-time teacher who greatly valued education and later went back to college, using her vast knowledge of child psychology (for better or worse) to parent Tommy.\n\nStu was always the wilder and more impulsive one of the two, with an active imagination that occasionally produced amazing creations for the benefit of Tommy and his pals (like the Reptar wagon) but more often than not just caused havoc. Didi, who was more studious and uptight, sometimes disapproved of her husband’s carelessness and Stu would get frustrated with her obsessive manner, but they did make a good team despite their different perspectives. Didi, notably, was said to be a caricature of Arlene Klasky, with a tendency towards helicopter-parenting and her overreliance on her many psychology books, but the parodic nature of the character never felt malicious (at least to me).\n\nThe one thing everybody likes to comment on nowadays is how neglectful – or at least, easily distracted – Stu and Didi were, but in the context of the show they seemed to be doing their best with their boys. No-one could deny they love Tommy and Dil, and I enjoy them more now as an adult than I did as a kid; indeed, all of the parents take on a new dimension as you get older, and you find yourself discovering a whole new layer of comedy in them that was utterly lost on you as a child.\n\nRounding out the Pickles clan was the mid-series addition of Tommy’s baby brother, Dylan Prescott Pickles, known as Dil. Hm… what to say about him? Introduced in the first film, Dil seems to have been created largely as a plot device to add to Tommy’s character arc, giving him a new sense of responsibility as an older brother and allowing him to become a kind of oracle, imparting wisdom to the new-born tot as they learn about the world together. Dil’s presence is also a likely in-universe explanation for the curbing of Tommy’s reckless, dangerous side from the earlier seasons.\n\nDil was a generally unwelcome addition in the eyes of most fans, because he functioned too much like an actual baby and thus had extremely limited roles in the episodes he featured in. Entire stories became bogged down by the older babies having to drag him around like a sack of spuds, and because he was too young to understand the concept of sharing, his greed would often get the others into trouble when he accidentally destroyed the things he hoarded. Sometimes, he would simply become a MacGuffin, being snatched or lost and forcing the babies to go looking for him.\n\nI’m with the fans on this one – I never cared for Dil and felt that he just detracted from the whole atmosphere of the show with his inability to fully participate in anything. I suspect he may have been one of Klasky’s additions, as he’s in line with that more “realistic” take on babies that she seemed to favour and was notably only brought in after the original writing team were gone. He didn’t exactly destroy the show, but he was definitely a factor in its decline in popularity.\n\nWe come now to the rest of Chuckie’s family, the Finsters, beginning with his father Charles Norbert (or Chas). In the earlier seasons, Chas was presented as the stereotypical “dork” of the nineties – a nerdy, hypochondriacal man with little social life, strange hobbies and an even worse habit of helicopter parenting than Didi. He could be gullible and easily led and was shown to be rather fickle, susceptible to the influence of money after winning a small fortune in one episode. It’s even implied in Chuckie’s Wonderful Life that his son is the only thing keeping him sane, with an alternate future depicting him as a disturbing lunatic talking to hand-puppets. All things considered, I get the impression that the old writers didn’t really like Chas much.\n\nLuckily, his portrayal improved as the show progressed, especially once his backstory was fleshed out a bit. He’s later revealed to be a widower, having lost his late wife Melinda to an illness shortly after Chuckie’s birth. Chas is depicted more sympathetically in later seasons, with less emphasis on his insecurities and more focus on his role as a single father to Chuckie; his neuroses were also played up a bit, showing us clearly where Chuckie gets it from. He and Chuckie share a beautiful bond and when his boy needs him, he’ll do whatever it takes – a trait present even in his earlier appearances, where he’d face down security guards and bodily throw grown men out of vehicles to get to Chuckie.\n\nChas was a character who grew on me over time, especially as the show began to focus more on his first, tentative forays back into the world of dating and then his eventual marriage to his second wife, Kira. He’s shown to be a good friend and a nice man who deserves happiness, so it’s satisfying to see him part of a happy family (and with his own business, too) by the end of the show. The tale of a grieving single father overcoming his fears for the sake of his son is so much more poignant when you watch the show back as an adult.\n\nChas’s happy family includes these two, Kira and Kimiko Watanabe-Finster (the latter of whom is usually just called Kimi). These were some of the last major cast members to be introduced, first appearing in the second film and becoming regulars from the seventh season onwards. After meeting in Paris, Chas and Kira married back in California and later formally adopted each other’s children, securing their bonds as a new family for good.\n\nKira was a pleasant addition, if not a very memorable one; she was a gentle and loving mother as well as Chas’s business partner at their coffee shop in the last few seasons, but other than that she was similar to Dil in the sense that she functioned mainly as a part of another character’s arc – Dil gave Tommy a baby brother, and Kira gave Chuckie a new mummy. While she loved Chuckie from the start, however, it’s interesting that the writers didn’t shy away from depicting the difficulties of adjusting to a new family realistically, especially given that this was an interracial family, still unusual in animation at that time. Kira sometimes made mistakes before she’d fully gotten to know Chuckie, but she always corrected herself once she understood what he needed and remained sweet and respectful of his wishes, exactly the kind of mother such a neurotic child needed.\n\nAs for Kimi, she quickly became a new core member of the babies’ gang, but since she was a lot like Tommy with her free spirit and adventurous outlook, it did start to feel like she’d replaced him by the last few seasons. It didn’t help that by then, Tommy himself had lost a lot of the rougher edges to his personality – he began to feel like just another baby in the crowd, rather than the bold leader he’d once been. Kimi was fine and all, don’t get me wrong; she was a perfect foil for Chuckie, cheerful when he was gloomy and spunky when he was hesitant, and she also seemed to have a strange, innocent affinity for Angelica. It’s just that her role in the group was never clearly defined, so she ended up basically hijacking Tommy’s and leaving him with little to do in the last few seasons.\n\nMuch like Phil and Lil, I was never really that interested in Kimi. By the time she was introduced, I was already starting to outgrow the show somewhat, although I did watch it right through to the end. If anyone was curious, it’s later revealed in the spin-off show All Grown Up that Kimi’s birth father is named Hiro, and that she has a stepfamily on his side in the form of his new wife and daughter, Wanda and Kiki.\n\nAngelica’s parents were Stu’s brother and sister-in-law, Andrew “Drew” Pickles and his wife, Charlotte. They were depicted as a typical nineties “yuppie” couple with her a confident, high-earning businesswoman mother and him a pen-pushing, nerdy doormat of a father. Both were very career-focused, which explains why they only ever had the one daughter and why they spoiled her so much.\n\nDrew was the main culprit for this, showering his “princess” with stuff to appease her because he didn’t have the time to properly parent her; it was a behaviour that Angelica had already learned to use to her advantage even at the tender age of three, knowing just the act to keep Drew right where she wanted him. He was shown to genuinely love his daughter, but like many parents of only children (mine included), he made the mistake of expressing that love by shielding his daughter from every tiny hardship life has to offer, leaving her with an overinflated sense of her own importance and no understanding of self-sufficiency. He’s also shown to have a rather petty brotherly rivalry with Stu and the two were always bickering whenever they were together for too long; Stu seemed to resent his brother’s “sell-out” lifestyle as an executive, but Drew was likely jealous that his nephew had turned out so much better than his own daughter.\n\nCharlotte, for her part, wasn’t even introduced until the second season and was initially rather detached from the main group of parents, rarely spending much time with them as she was always preoccupied with business matters. That was also what kept her from her daughter; we saw in one episode that she was still on the phone giving orders moments after Angelica’s birth! Still, she did care for her daughter too, expressing it mainly by encouraging what she sees as Angelica’s “self-esteem” – yet while it was great that she wanted her to be a strong independent woman someday, she really wasn’t going the right way about creating one at all. Eventually, Charlotte did warm up to the other adults and was a regular participant in their activities by the later seasons, but she never lost her thirst for power in the corporate world.\n\nIt’s probably not a good thing, but these two were always my favourites out of the parents as a kid, perhaps because they were so ridiculous that I just found them hysterical. I’ll always love the episode The Baby Vanishes and the way it perfectly skewered Drew by forcing him to acknowledge what a spoilt little brat Angelica really was, it’s just hilarious. There was just something that tickled me about seeing this grown man wrapped around his toddler’s little finger, and Charlotte was a riot in her own way with her devious manipulations in the business world, always busy destroying other companies no matter what other activity she’s supposed to be involved in at the time.\n\nTo finish off the main cast, we have Elizabeth “Betty” DeVille and her husband Howard, the parents of Phil and Lil. These two, particularly Betty, have become my new favourites of the parents now I’m older, partly because of how ahead-of-its-time their dynamic is. Howard is rather bland and forgettable, easily the least interesting of the parents; his most notable characteristics are a kind of quirky absent-mindedness, but he’s rarely the focus of an episode so he’s never explored in much depth. He was a stay-at-home father, but he and Betty still seemed to share most of the workload of raising the twins together.\n\nBetty, however, was always one of the coolest parents in the group, portrayed as a kind of uber-feminist who regularly turns her hand to all manner of traditionally “masculine” jobs like DIY, plumbing and welding, to name just a few. While her husband was very quiet and mild-mannered, Betty was a street-smart, boisterous tomboy who often served as the voice of reason among the adults (most of whom are either absent, absent-minded or fixated on rules in books). Her way of parenting was more natural than Didi’s, as she would just do what felt right and trusted her instincts as a mother rather than the words of some cockamamie child psychologist. She’s so forthright and funny with her blunt manner of speaking – actually, now that I think about it, she reminds me a lot of my own mother, so perhaps that’s why I always liked her.\n\nIt’s also worth nothing here how progressive the writers’ depiction of mothers in this show was, considering this was the early nineties. Charlotte, Betty and even Didi were all depicted as “wearing the pants” in their relationships, outspoken and totally confident in themselves, with the former two holding “masculine” jobs and leaving much of the caregiving work to their husbands. Didi, arguably the most traditionally feminine of the trio, was still a force to be reckoned with at times and would often put her foot down when Stu’s haphazard lifestyle put the family at risk. It’s great to see such strong role models for girls from such an unexpected source; perhaps the writers couldn’t face depicting the babies’ mothers in the usual tired homemaking roles and challenged the stereotypes to make them more interesting. If so, it certainly worked.\n\nAmong the recurring characters, some of the most notable include the Carmichaels, a family who moved in across the street from the Pickles in season two and became their friends. Their youngest daughter, Susanna Yvonne (Susie) was the most well-developed of them, acting as Angelica’s foil in numerous episodes with her better attitude and behaviour.\n\nWhere Angelica was an example of how not to parent a child, Susie’s parents seemed to have gotten a lot right; Susie was polite, friendly and self-confident, becoming good friends with the babies and standing up for them whenever Angelica’s bullying threatened to overwhelm them. She was also shown to be very intelligent, speaking at least two languages at three years old and understanding the basics of etiquette and reproduction. However, while she was generally warm and friendly, she did also have a very competitive nature which Angelica sometimes brought out in her, as well as a tendency to “jump the gun” by being too quick to make assumptions about a situation.\n\nI liked Susie more in the earlier seasons, where she felt like a more fully realised character with flaws and different sides to her. In the middle seasons she began to feel too much like a Mary Sue, but by the latest ones she had almost disappeared entirely (although she did get a bigger part in the third film than either of the previous two).\n\nSusie’s parents were Randy and Lucy, each of whom also possessed a great deal of talent in different areas. It’s easy to see where Susie – and her brother Edwin – got their intelligence from! Randy, for his part, was the writer of a popular in-universe animated show who secretly hated being recognised by fans of his work and seemed even to resent the show’s success a bit (I wonder if that was an in-joke from the writers of this animated show). Lucy, meanwhile, was an absolute wonder, an accomplished and multi-talented prodigy with experience in gourmet cooking, lamp making, piloting aircraft and performing surgery, among other things – you wonder where she found the time! Both Stu and Didi were rather awestruck upon first meeting them, but sadly the parents’ relationships were never explored much beyond a few early episodes.\n\nAlisa top left, Buster bottom left, Edwin right\n\nSusie also had three elder siblings, starting with Alisa, the oldest. Alisa was presented as a typical teenager with a strong social life, who sometimes chafed under the responsibility of having to help care for her younger siblings. However, she proved to her parents that they could rely on her and seemed to grow more comfortable with her “authority” in time. Then there was Buster, a sporty jock of a lad with a bit of a mischievous side who enjoyed playing pranks on the rest of the family (sometimes getting himself in trouble in the process). Finally, just above Susie in age, came Edwin, the intellectual of the group; with a mother like Lucy Carmichael, he’s got just the right sort of nurturing environment for his intellect to thrive.\n\nTommy’s maternal grandparents also cropped up from time to time, although they were never present as often as Grandpa Lou since they lived in their own home. Boris Kropotkin and Minka Kerpackter were based on Arlene Klasky’s own Eastern European great-aunts and uncles, as she deemed the inclusion of Jewish themes in the show “essential”. Klasky was particularly set on depicting an interfaith family like her own, with Stu a Christian and Didi a Jew, as “it was important to show that difference between family.”\n\nJudging from comments made by the characters, Boris and Minka seem to have emigrated to America from a village somewhere near Smolensk in Russia, and they are depicted as Ashkenazi Jews. Melanie Chartoff, the voice of Didi and a Jew herself, was asked by her agent to try out for the additional role of Minka. Initially, she felt the character was too cliched, noting, “Although the show had been created by Jews, this script had clearly not been written by them,” so she did some research into her own family memorabilia to create a personality for Minka that she felt would match her voice.\n\nWhile these two did get some flak from the general public for being stereotypical, they were generally regarded as welcome additions to the cast, especially at a time when openly Jewish characters were so rarely featured on TV (Jerry Seinfeld was the most notable example at the time). Both of them are very set in their ways until their grandchildren start to loosen them up, with the couple frequently complaining that America doesn’t compare to “the old country”. Boris tended to be the more stubborn and argumentative of the two but did love spending time with his grandkids; Minka may have been milder, but she soon put Boris in his place when he was getting too cranky. For what it’s worth, these were my mother’s favourite characters on the show! (And we’re not even Jewish).\n\nThe Pickles clan also included the family dog, Spike, a “Siberian tiger hound” (not a real breed, unfortunately) who served as a loyal companion to Tommy and occasionally offered a means of transport for the babies both before and after they got their Reptar wagon. Like most of the other supporting characters, Spike was better used in the earlier seasons where he seemed to share a closer bond with Tommy – as time went on and the cast swelled, the new writing team seem to have had less use for him. I suppose he did get a moment to, erm, “shine” in Rugrats Go Wild, though.\n\nHis most notable story arc from the later seasons involved him pairing up with Fifi, a stray poodle from Paris that the Finster family adopts and brings back with them. Somehow. (Seriously, how in the world did they get her through immigration? I know it was pre-9/11 but come on…) I don’t remember much about Fifi since she was added so late, but she and Spike did somehow conceive a couple of puppies (Spiffy and Pepper) despite being owned by different families.\n\nOther significant members of the supporting cast included Tommy’s Aunt Miriam (actually his “great-aunt once removed”, according to Angelica), who was always a riot whenever she was around with her boisterous, plain-speaking manner. Miriam is revealed to have had the same dynamic with Lou in their childhood that Angelica now has with Tommy, but they do manage to reconcile their differences… after seventy-six years!\n\nThen there’s Louise “Lulu” Jonston, a sweet but rather befuddled older woman whom Lou meets just before the second film, Rugrats in Paris. It turns out the two of them met once before, long ago as youngsters, and they quickly develop a romance that blossoms into marriage, making Lulu Tommy’s step-grandma. Lulu was distinguished by her outgoing and active personality, which was sometimes hampered by her clumsiness and forgetfulness – but she always meant well.\n\nJonathan on the left, Lipschitz on the right, both making the same gesture\n\nAmong the professionals the characters interact with, we find Jonathan Kraskell, the rather prissy and put-upon assistant to Charlotte who was terrified of Angelica and was always angling for a promotion from his hardnosed boss. Apparently, he came back later in the spin-off series after a corporate restructuring put him above Charlotte and fired her! And of course, who could forget Dr. Werner Lipschitz (yes, his surname contains a pun), the pompous German child psychologist whom Didi puts so much faith in. The gang actually met him in person a couple of times and realised that he’s not all he’s cracked up to be, but Tommy and Chuckie soon put him through his paces and gave him some valuable new experience for future books.\n\nLarry and Steve are worth a mention, although neither are seen beyond the fourth season at the latest. These two clowns were a couple of low-paid teenage employees who cropped up as a sort of running gag throughout the first season or two, always in different uniforms depending on where the gang happened to encounter them. Like most minimum wagers, they were rather bitter and frustrated with their jobs and were always bickering, each trying to pass responsibility to the other to get out of clearing up the mess (which was usually down to the babies).\n\nTo wrap up the section, we also have Fluffy, Angelica’s eerie doppelgänger of a cat who frequently made trouble for the babies and Spike, although she was also shown to get along with them occasionally if they weren’t too rough with her. Her development paralleled that of her mistress, because as the seasons passed, her viciousness was toned down and she wound up as more of an apathetic pampered pet than the more vindictive furball she was in the beginning.\n\nStory Overview\n\nAs a slice of life show, Rugrats never really had an overarching story arc, which made it easy to dip in and out of the show at random. (Don’t worry, once we get to series like Gravity Falls this section will be much meatier!) Over the seasons, we simply follow the babies on their little adventures, many of which resulted from misunderstandings of something they’d heard the adults say – or something Angelica had deliberately “explained” to cause trouble. There’s often a moral lesson at the end of the episode, particularly in later seasons, with Angelica alternately dodging karma or being duly punished depending on the writer. Given the simplicity of the show’s set-up, it’s remarkable how entertaining it still is even after almost three decades – thanks to their witty writing, the first three seasons have held up especially well.\n\nOf course, the babies do hit several developmental milestones over the course of the show – Chuckie is potty-trained, says his first word and gains a new mother and sister, while Tommy is weaned, celebrates his first birthday and gets a new brother, just to name a few examples – but there was a bit of an issue with consistency. This probably resulted from the show running for so much longer than expected, but watching it back as an adult, you can’t help laughing at the fact that these babies never seem to age. The amount they seem to cram into just one “year” is incredible, taking multiple holidays abroad, watching the seasons change repeatedly, even gaining new siblings and all without heading any further into childhood! Heck, they even celebrate two Christmases at the same ages, just so Kimi and Dil can be included. The spin-off show did finally age them up, but for the duration of the main show you just have to ignore the logic of time.\n\nSimilarly, you also have to stretch your suspension of disbelief a bit to ignore how horrendously neglectful these parents are, a recurring observation with this show that is only somewhat justified by the “rule of drama”. Now that the original audience for Rugrats have grown up, we’ve all been horrified to see Tommy nearly mauled by a bulldog, tumbling from the top of a baseball stadium, being kidnapped by armed thugs, almost dying in a mail chute at a post office and dangling off light fixtures at a supermarket – and that’s just in the first season!\n\nThe trouble was that the babies needed enough freedom from their parents to be able to carry out the plot, but because they were so young this wound up making the parents look totally irresponsible. Any real babies would have been dead long before kindergarten in their situation… but thank goodness, it’s just a show. To be fair, most shows with child protagonists have to relax parental supervision a little for the sake of the story – and after all, it was the nineties!\n\nEpisode Breakdown\n\nHere’s a selection of some of the most significant episodes from the show’s run, shown in order of production with their release date (episodes often air out of production order):\n\nPilot episode, 1990 – Tommy Pickles and The Great White Thing\n\nSeason 1\n\nAugust 11th, 1991: Tommy’s First Birthday – First episode, which introduced most of the cast\n\nAugust 25th, 1991: At the Movies / Slumber Party – first appearance of Reptar\n\nJanuary 5th, 1992: Candy Bar Creep Show / Monster in the Garage – Halloween special\n\nMarch 29th, 1992: Touchdown Tommy / The Trial – the latter segment was notoriously controversial among the writing staff\n\nSeason 2\n\nOctober 25th, 1992: Family Reunion / Grandpa’s Date – both segments provide a bit of backstory on the Pickles family\n\nNovember 8th, 1992: Reptar on Ice / Family Feud – the former segment is notable for being one of fans’ favourite episodes, as voted for on Nick.com\n\nDecember 6th, 1992: The Santa Experience – the first Christmas special (and the debut of Charlotte)\n\nJanuary 10th, 1993: Meet the Carmichaels / The Box – the Carmichael family are introduced\n\nApril 11th, 1993: Game Show Didi / Toys in the Attic – the former segment guest starred Alex Trebek and Charles Nelson Reilly\n\nSeason 3\n\nOctober 24th, 1993: Circus Angelicus / The Stork – the first mention of Tommy possibly getting a new baby brother\n\nNovember 7th, 1993: When Wishes Come True / Angelica Breaks a Leg – the latter segment has become famous as the source of “Stu making chocolate pudding at 4AM” memes\n\nJanuary 9th, 1994: Under Chuckie’s Bed / Chuckie is Rich – Pat Sajak guest stars in the latter segment\n\nFebruary 13th, 1994: Mommy’s Little Assets / Chuckie’s Wonderful Life – both popular segments, but the latter is notable for exploring Chuckie’s character in an It’s a Wonderful Life (1946) parody\n\nMay 15th, 1994: I Remember Melville / No More Cookies – two challenging segments which deal with the adult issues of death/grief and addiction, respectively\n\nApril 13th, 1995: Passover – the first of the beloved Jewish holiday specials\n\nSeason 4\n\nDecember 4th, 1996: Chanukah – the second Jewish holiday special\n\nMay 6th, 1997: Mother’s Day – a poignant and touching episode in which Chuckie learns more about his late mother, Melinda\n\nJuly 8th, 1997: Vacation – a popular special in which the gang take a trip to Las Vegas (yes, babies included!)\n\nSeptember 27th, 1997: Dust Bunnies / Educating Angelica – Angelica begins preschool\n\nNovember 10th, 1997: The Turkey Who Came to Dinner – a Thanksgiving special\n\nSeason 5\n\nAugust 19th, 1998: Grandpa’s Bad Bug / Lady Luck – the last episode to feature David Doyle in the role of Grandpa Lou, due to his death in 1997\n\nAugust 18th, 1998: The Word of the Day / Jonathan Babysits – the former segment is another notorious source of meme-fodder, due to Angelica learning a “bad word”\n\nSeptember 21st, 1998: The Family Tree – Chuckie learns more about his family, and Didi announces her pregnancy with Dil (this episode led into The Rugrats Movie)\n\nSeason 6\n\nJanuary 18th, 1999: Chuckie’s Duckling / A Dog’s Life – this episode marks the debut of Dil\n\nMarch 27th, 1999: Ghost Story / Chuckie’s Complaint – the former segment is another Halloween special, featuring characters from fellow Nicktoon show, Aaahh!!!

While I agree with the general consensus that the first three seasons were the best, I have my favourite episodes from the middle seasons too, with only the last two or three starting to lose my interest as they became a bit stale and sugar-coated. The main problem was that the writing team seemed to run out of ideas towards the end, so they began to rehash earlier episodes, relied overly on the kids’ fantasies or devolved into lazy film parodies, but I suppose there’s only so much you can do with babies – even when they’re as indestructible as these!\n\nThe first season of the show was wild, experimental and endearingly “ugly”, as the team had yet to find their feet with their new creation and were breaking ground alongside the other two Nicktoons. The episodes at this point tended to focus mainly on Tommy wandering off and causing mayhem, with the babies getting into some of their most truly dangerous scrapes of the whole series. Among my favourites were At the Movies / Slumber Party, Beauty Contest / Baseball, Ruthless Tommy / Moose Country, and Real or Robots? / Special Delivery, with the latter standing out for the borderline-disturbing imagery in both segments (including a freaking corpse at the bottom of the mail chute).\n\nGoing into season two, there was a noticeable upgrade in animation quality, with the character designs being smoothed out and the action becoming more fluid. Many episodes in this season had “grander” storylines with more emotional weight and adventurous settings. The writing, however, only got better, with some truly fantastic episodes coming out in this time – and this also happens to be the season I was born during! I always loved Toy Palace / Sand Ho, which created two distinct and charming atmospheres and is probably my single favourite episode of the show. However, this season also contained gems like Angelica’s in Love / Ice Cream Mountain, No Bones About It / Beach Blanket Babies, Aunt Miriam / The Inside Story (another excellent one), A Visit From Lipschitz / What the Big People Do, and Down the Drain / Let Them Eat Cake.\n\nSeason three brought with it more of that appealing quality which made the show famous in its hiatus, maintaining a similar level of writing and animation as the one before it. The Legend of Satchmo is a major highlight here; I never went camping as a kid, but this episode gave me a good idea of what it would be like to hear a chilling ghost story all alone in the dark of the woods – and I’ll never stop laughing at, “Satchmo – the trumpet player?” “No, the monster.” Aside from that, we also have The Baby Vanishes (a riot to watch when you’re older), The Last Babysitter, Give & Take / The Gold Rush, Home Movies / The Mysterious Mr. Friend, Cuffed! / The Blizzard (another favourite), The Alien / Mr. Clean, Angelica’s Worst Nightmare, Kid TV / The Sky is Falling and, of course, Passover. (“DON’T CLOSE THE- *bang* …door.”)\n\nAfter the hiatus in the mid-nineties, the show returned in 1996 with a fresher, brighter art-style and a new writing team, but contrary to what many fans claim, things didn’t immediately go to pot. There are still some high-calibre episodes that came out of the fourth season, such as The Carwash / Heat Wave, Send in the Clouds / In the Naval and Angelica Orders Out, the last of which I remember laughing hysterically over for ages. Some of the specials I mentioned above, like Mother’s Day and Vacation, are also among the show’s most famous episodes. It might have been “toned down” a bit, but this was still a worthy season – the only really notable change was in Angelica’s character, which had become much less violent and cruel.\n\nSeason five offered more of this new Rugrats, with some of my top episodes being Piggy’s Pizza Palace, Where’s Grandpa?, Sleep Trouble and Journey to the Centre of the Basement (I was a fan of that one long before I’d read any Jules Verne). Then, however, we came to season six, which marked the point at which some fans felt the show began to miss the mark.\n\nThe sixth season was the one which introduced Dil, and the little tyke now cropped up in every episode as a new “member” of the gang – except he couldn’t walk, talk or do anything the other babies could, which somewhat limited their activities. There were still some fun, imaginative episodes like Submarine, I Do, The Art Museum, The Jungle, Pedal Pusher, Cooking with Susie, Doctor Susie and my favourite of the season, Discover America, but as a kid I definitely felt the drop in the level of drama.\n\nPersonally, though, it was the seventh season which lost me. Following on from the second film, Kimi was now added to the ever-swelling gang, and while I’m not blaming her character directly for the “seasonal rot” that ensued, her presence certainly did nothing to help matters. These last three seasons definitely felt lacklustre, with only Angelicon, My Fair Babies and Home Sweet Home standing out in my memory as being particularly fun.\n\nThen season eight arrived, and by this point the cracks were really starting to show. Despite the celebration of the show’s tenth anniversary by Nickelodeon with the genuinely great special All Growed Up, the writers were clearly running out of steam and struggling to come up with anything new for the babies to do. Murmur on the Ornery Express and Okey-Dokey Jones and the Ring of the Sunbeams were alright (for film parodies, anyway), but I wouldn’t call either of them favourites.\n\nFinally, with season nine, the show came to the end of its record-breaking run with more of a whimper than a bang. The writers were actively trying to attract a new demographic with hip, young, “cool” characters like Taffy, a teenage babysitter who had been introduced at the end of the last season, but the writing was on the wall. Outside of the second Christmas special, the only other episode I remember liking at all was Hurricane Alice, but given how late in my childhood this season aired, it’s not surprising that I had almost abandoned the show by this point.\n\nThe ninth season concluded with little fanfare in the summer of 2004, with the final episode airing over a year after the previous one for some reason. Then, the thirteen-year-old Rugrats laid down with a sigh of relief and passed the baton to SpongeBob SquarePants… which is still carrying it fifteen years later, like some undead abomination leaking dollars out of its cold, empty eye sockets. Poor Nickelodeon.\n\nLegacy –\n\nThere’s no underestimating the might of Rugrats in the nineties. Until it was surpassed by SpongeBob and Fairly OddParents, it was easily Nick’s longest-running and most popular show, retaining the network’s top ratings from 1995 to 2001 and spawning a spin-off, multiple specials and three theatrical films that are still among the top thirty highest-grossing animated film franchises of all time. The Rugrats Movie alone was the first non-Disney animated film to gross over $100 million in the USA, remaining the highest-grossing film to be based on a TV series until The Simpsons Movie arrived nine years later.\n\nThe show’s inclusion and celebration of Jewish characters earned it high praise from religious groups, with the Passover and Chanukah specials attracting some of the highest ratings of the show’s entire run. Melanie Chartoff, the voice of Didi and Minka, received numerous letters from fans who were delighted to see their religion portrayed so positively, although funnily enough her own mother disliked Boris and Minka, claiming they felt anti-Semitic.\n\nActually, Mrs. Chartoff wasn’t alone in that – there was a minor controversy in 1998 when a comic based on the series came under fire for its character design of Boris, with the Anti-Defamation League and The Washington Post criticizing it for “resembling Nazi-era depictions of Jews.” Some, such as former Nickelodeon president Albie Hecht (himself a Jew) felt the accusations were baseless and absurd, but the acting president at the time, Herb Scannell, still dutifully apologised.\n\nApart from that, however, people couldn’t get enough Rugrats. The great Spielberg himself stated in 1995 that it was among the best children’s programming of its day, describing it as “sort of a TV Peanuts of our time” – even while he was producing several competing animated series over at Warner Bros., such as Animaniacs. The show was given a live show, numerous videogame tie-ins and at least three comic strips / magazines, the most recent of which began in 2017. In 2001, Rugrats even got its own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame to celebrate its decennial, and for many years it also had its own float in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade! Nickelodeon handled it better than their other two debut Nicktoons, both of which came to far less auspicious ends as Doug was snatched up by Disney and Ren and Stimpy was eaten up in a creative rights dispute.\n\nPart of its appeal lay in its international reach; Rugrats was shown in over 76 different countries and was dubbed into dozens of languages, with a diverse range of stars including Alexa Vega, Daryl Sabara, Amanda Bynes, Aaron Carter, Ray Romano, Nivea and Bow Wow endorsing it. All nine seasons were eventually released on DVD and are available for streaming on Hulu (having been removed from Netflix a couple of years ago), but perhaps the most interesting news for fans came last year with the announcement that Nick have picked up a revival of the series, which will be executive produced by Klasky Csupo along with Paul Germain. Apparently, Paramount have also greenlit a live-action / CGI hybrid feature film which will follow in 2021, but I’m not going to get my hopes up just yet.\n\nThe hitch in all this is Germain, who was the prime creative voice of the show in its earlier days before his departure. He has stated, “A lot of the direction that they took the show in after I left in 1993 – the second 65 episodes and then the All Grown Up! series – I thought those episodes were poor. I thought they lost the spirit of it. I think the way to go {for a reboot} would be to take it back to where it was. I don’t know if we could really do that, but that’s what I would like to see. I think it’s possible.” Well, I’m game to find out if he is, although the news that the new show will also likely be in live-action / CGI bothers me a bit… I’m all for updating the art style, but what is it with Hollywood actively trying to destroy the legacy of traditional animation at the moment? Still, if this gets even a few modern kids into the old show, then I guess it’s worth it… right?\n\nWhat a ride this one was! I adore Rugrats and I’ve greatly enjoyed researching for this review; it stirred up all kinds of warm nostalgic memories. In time, I plan to get around to doing some individual episode reviews so we can explore each show’s highlights in more detail, but that won’t be a for a while yet since I still have plenty of films to keep me busy for the moment. Episode reviews may eventually take the place of my book reviews as my “shorter” offerings, once I’ve covered some more shows and once I’ve run out of books. I will also definitely be reviewing all three Rugrats films some time next year, which is why I haven’t talked about them too much here.\n\nThe next review will be of The Secret of NIMH (which I wish I’d seen as a kid, it’s glorious) and I’m aiming to get it up for the 25th at the latest, but you’ll have to bear with me if I don’t make the deadline; it’s the summer holidays for the schoolkids and the museum I work it is overrun, so it’s going to be a very hectic month! Until next time, take care and staaay animated!\n\nReferences\n\nI consulted my own books to research for this review, as well as some standard web sources:\n\nNot Just Cartoons: Nicktoons!
