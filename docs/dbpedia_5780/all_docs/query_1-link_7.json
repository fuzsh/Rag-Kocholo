It has been described as a reboot of the original TV series of the same name that ran from 1991 to 2004. The series premiered on May 27, 2021, on Paramount+; it is the second Nickelodeon-based series created for the streaming service. As with previous incarnations of the franchise, the series was produced by Klasky Csupo and Nickelodeon Animation Studio.[1][2]\n\nOn March 28, 2024, the series was removed from Paramount+ as part of a \"strategic decision to focus on content with mass global appeal.\"[4] Premieres had already moved to the Nicktoons channel on March 14, 2024.\n\nPremise\n\n[edit]\n\nApart from the setting update of the 2020s from the 1990s, the rebooted Rugrats remains the same as the original series, as it still focuses on the experiences of a courageous, adventurous one-year-old baby named Tommy Pickles and his group of playmates and other infants and toddlers.\n\nVoice cast\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: List of Rugrats characters\n\nThe surviving voice actors of the titular \"Rugrats\" reprise their roles from the original series, though the adult roles from the original series have been recast, including Betty DeVille who was originally voiced by the returning Kath Soucie.[5]\n\nChildren\n\n[edit]\n\nE.

In May 2020, it was announced that the revival series was delayed until 2021.[16]\n\nIn late February 2021, it was announced that the reboot would premiere on Paramount+ in late spring 2021.[1][2] A sneak peek was also uploaded to social media platforms. In March, an all-new cast for the parents were revealed.[5]\n\nThe reboot premiered on Paramount+ on May 27, 2021 and began airing on Nickelodeon on August 20, 2021.[17][18] A second batch of episodes was released on October 7, 2021.[17] Regular Nickelodeon airings began on February 25, 2022.[19]\n\nOn September 21, 2021, the series was renewed for a 13-episode second season.[20] The series has a holiday episode that was released on December 2, 2021.[21]\n\nOn July 21, 2022, it was announced that an additional 13 episodes had been ordered for season two, and that the series was renewed for a 13-episode third season.[22]\n\nOn March 16, 2023, it was announced that season two would premiere on April 14, 2023.[23]\n\nComparisons with original series\n\n[edit]\n\nAs a continuity reboot, the 2021 series has differences to the original 1991 series, some of which was done to accommodate the 30-year difference between the two. The character Betty DeVille was originally portrayed as a strong feminist woman with a \"weak\" husband in Howard. She is now portrayed as a lesbian, and Howard is absent.[24] Her voice actress, Natalie Morales, stated about the change that \"anyone who watched the original show may have had an inkling Betty was a member of the alphabet mafia.\"[25]\n\nSusie and the Carmichael family are already established as neighbors (as opposed to the 1991 series, when they debuted during its second season). Susie is also now two years old instead of three and is no longer able to talk to the adults.[26] Charlotte Pickles also is present from the beginning; in the 1991 series, she did not appear until the second season, being an unseen character up until then. Kimi Watanabe is now three and a half years old, and has already moved with her mother Kira from Paris to the United States by the time she meets the cast.[27] Kira and Chas meet in \"Lucky Smudge\", when it is revealed she won piano lessons he submitted for a raffle at a fair.[28]\n\nFluffy, the cat already long belonging to Drew, Charlotte, and Angelica by the time of its first appearances in the original series, is adopted in \"Fluffy Moves In\" during this series.[29]\n\nEpisodes\n\n[edit]\n\nSeries overview\n\n[edit]\n\nSeason 1 (2021–22)\n\n[edit]\n\nNo.\n\noverallNo. in\n\nseasonTitle [17][30]Written byStoryboard byOriginal release date [17][30]Nickelodeon air date [17][30]Prod.\n\ncode [17]U.S. linear viewers\n\n(millions)11\"Second Time Around\"Kate Boutilier & Eryk CasemiroDave Stone, Casey Burke Leonard (director)May 27, 2021 ( )August 20, 20211010.42[31]102\n\nWhen Tommy encourages Chuckie to be more adventurous, Chuckie accidentally swallows a worm.\n\n22\"Lady De-Clutter\"Alec SchwimmerDave Stone (also director)May 27, 2021 ( )March 11, 20221030.33[32]\"New Puppy\"Lauren ShellTim Prendergast, Dave Stone (director)March 18, 20220.39[33] 33\"Tail of the Dogbot\"Allan NeuwirthTim Prendergast, Dave Stone (director)May 27, 2021 ( )March 4, 20221040.36[34]\"Jonathan for a Day\"Lauren ShellJackie Bae, Dave Stone (director) 44\"One Big Happy Family\"Story by : Alec Schwimmer\n\nWritten by : Jenny JaffeJackie Bae, Dave Stone (director)May 27, 2021 ( )February 25, 20221050.41[35]\"The Last Balloon\"Sam ClarkeRachel Tamura, Dave Stone (director) 55\"March for Peas\"Robin J.
