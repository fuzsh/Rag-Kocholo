Variety reports that Nickelodeon had ordered 26 episodes of Rugrats, an animated series that garnered six Emmy nominees from 1990 to 2006.\n\n\"Rugrats\" followed the adventures of babies Tommy Pickles, Chucky Finster, Phil and Lil DeVille, Angelica Pickles and Susie Carmichael. The show's creators, Arlene Klasky, Gábor Csupó and Paul Germain will all be back to run the show.\n\nIn addition, Paramount announced it will release a live-action movie with CGI characters based on the movie. The new movie would be the fourth movie to be released in the franchise.\n\nThough no premiere date for the show or film was released, Variety reports that additional news on the new Rugrats properties will be announced in the coming months.\n\nEO\n\nAlex Hider is a writer for the E.W.
