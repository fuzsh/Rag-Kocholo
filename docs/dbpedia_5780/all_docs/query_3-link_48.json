This film marks the first appearance of Kimi Watanabe and her mother, Kira. The film also marks the only appearance of two legitimate human villains in the Rugrats franchise, Coco LaBouche, a cruel and tyrannical woman who dislikes children, including babies, and her accomplice, Jean-Claude. The events of the film take place before the seventh season of Rugrats.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on November 17, 2000, almost two years after the release of The Rugrats Movie in 1998. Rugrats in Paris: The Movie was received to generally positive reviews from critics and fans alike and grossed over $103 million worldwide against a production budget of $30 million.\n\nPlot\n\nAt the wedding reception of Lou Pickles and his new wife Lulu, a mother-child dance during the reception saddens Chuckie Finster and his father Chas as Chuckie's mother died of a terminal illness shortly after Chuckie was born.\n\nTommy Pickles' father Stu is summoned to EuroReptarland, a Japanese amusement park in Paris, France, to fix a malfunctioning Reptar robot supposed to star in a stage show. Due to Stu being called in the wee hours of the morning thanks to the time difference, he mistakenly brings his wife DiDi, his dog Spike, his sons Dil and Tommy, and Chuckie, Phil, Lil, Angelica, and their parents along to Paris to take a vacation at the park.\n\nUpon the Rugrats' arrival at EuroReptarland, Angelica overhears a phone conversation between the park's greedy, child-hating head Coco LaBouche, and the president of the Reptar franchise, Mr. Yamaguchi. Coco wants to succeed Yamaguchi when he retires, but Yamaguchi says his successor must love children. Coco therefore lies, and says she is engaged to a man with a child. She later discovers Angelica overheard; to save herself, Angelica reveals that Chas is looking for a second wife, prompting a delighted Coco to pounce on the idea. Angelica also blackmails Coco into promising her a parade float in exchange for her silence.\n\nCoco strikes up a relationship with Chas, but her attempts to bond with a suspicious Chuckie fail. The adults and babies meet Coco's overworked but kind-hearted assistant Kira Watanabe and her daughter Kimi, who hail from Japan but are now living in France. Kira reluctantly helps LaBouche to win Chas' affections. Meanwhile, Spike gets lost in the streets of Paris and falls in love with a stray poodle named Fifi.\n\nKira tells the babies the origins of Reptar, explaining he was a feared monster until a princess revealed his gentler side to make the frightened humans like him. Chuckie decides the princess should be his new mother, and he and his friends attempt to reach an animatronic replica of the princess in a structure built above the park, but they are stopped by Coco's ninja security guards.\n\nAt the show's premiere, Angelica informs Coco of Chuckie's wish. Coco sneaks backstage and takes the spotlight disguised as the princess, luring Chuckie into her arms and taking his teddy bear. Chuckie is horrified when he discovers the truth, but Chas is ecstatic, thinking she would make an excellent mother, and instantly decides to marry her.\n\nFearing the unruly babies will ruin her plans, Coco has her accomplice Jean Claude kidnap them and Angelica and lock them in the warehouse where the show's robots are kept. Kira protests and threatens to tell Chas, but Coco throws her out of her limo, leaving her to hurry to the wedding via bicycle. Chuckie apologizes for his quest for a real mother getting them into trouble, lamenting his loss. Angelica, feeling guilty, reveals Coco's plan, and Chuckie rallies the children to use the Reptar Robot to hurry to Notre Dame to stop the wedding. Jean Claude follows, piloting Reptar's nemesis Robosnail, and the two robots fight on a bridge until Chuckie knocks Jean Claude into the Seine River.\n\nChuckie crashes the wedding screaming \"No!\" (his first word in grown-up language), and Jean Claude arrives and inadvertently reveals the kidnapping, prompting Chas to call off the wedding in disgust. Angelica, angry at Coco's betrayal, exposes Coco's plan to Yamaguchi, who dismisses Coco. Angelica also rips the seat of the wedding dress; Coco storms out of the church defeated and humiliated, while Spike chases Jean Claude away.\n\nKira arrives at the church, returns Chuckieâ€™s teddy bear to him and apologizes to Chas for what Coco did to him and Chuckie. However, Chas admits that he was being blinded by the romance in Paris, and apologizes to Chuckie. He and Kira begin to fall in love after discovering a shared liking of the same poet.\n\nChas and Kira eventually get married after returning to the United States, while Fifi is adopted by the Finster family. As the new family take the first dance together, they are interrupted when the whole dance floor erupts into an all out food fight instigated by the babies.\n\nCast\n\nMain article: List of Rugrats characters\n\nMain\n\nSupporting\n\nGuest stars\n\nSoundtrack\n\nSoundtrack Source Rating Allmusic\n\nA soundtrack for the film, titled Rugrats in Paris: The Movie: Music From the Motion Picture was released on November 7, 2000 on Maverick Records.
