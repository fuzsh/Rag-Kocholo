        "text": "This is a review of the first two episodes of the Rugrats reboot, titled \"Second Time Around\" and \"Lady De-Clutter\" / \"New Puppy.\" There are currently five episodes available to watch on the Paramount+ streaming service.\n\nThirty years ago, after they first debuted in diapers, Rugrats is back with a reboot that plunks its plucky pint-sized protagonists into big, imaginative adventures. The original Nickelodeon cartoon series included nine seasons, three movies, and a pair of short-lived spinoffs. Now, Paramount+ is giving Tommy and the gang a fresh start with a few modern tweaks.\n\nThe most eye-catching change from the original series is that Rugrats has gone from a hand-drawn aesthetic to 3-D computer animation. It basically looks like the old characters were inflated like balloons. The hard lines of the design are all softened, much like the new SpongeBob SquarePants spinoff Kamp Koral: SpongeBob’s Under Years. Maybe this change is meant to cater to kids who watch a plethora of cuddly CG cartoon shows like Miraculous Lady Bug, Vampirina, and Puppy Dog Pals. Perhaps the classic look was deemed too old-fashioned. Regardless, this design choice makes Rugrats look like an imitator instead of an innovator.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThe Nickelodeon cartoons of the ‘90s were plentiful but unique, offering wild and weird realms for kids to explore with wacky and often unapologetically ugly characters. The fact that parents thought the characters looked strange was part of the fun. This reboot’s plump CG approach softens the oddness of the original designs, which was always part of Rugrats' appeal. Creators Arlene Klasky, Gabor Csupo, and Paul Germain never made these babies all that cute. They made them wobbly-mouthed little weirdos with bad hair, who were gleefully gross. While the love of mud pies and diaper humor remains, this Klasky Csupo reboot has lost the edge in its animation translation.\n\nThis new version of Rugrats kicks off with a super-sized episode. Clocking in at nearly 44 minutes, “Second Time Around” thrusts fans right into the untamed imaginations of its toddler heroes with a prolonged Jurassic Park parody. “They said it was imposterable,” Tommy Pickles says in awe, delivering the first signature malapropism as he looks upon a towering dinosaur. The sequence is fun, recasting quivering Chuckie Finster as Dr. Ian Malcolm in his memorable “must go faster” moment, while the growling Angelica Pickles is their ferocious T-Rex. However, it might have popped more if this exact same bit wasn’t employed last year for the premiere episode of the Animaniacs reboot. Sure, Jurassic Park was a huge, influential hit, but lots of great movies came out in the ‘90s. There must be some alternative parody that might have achieved a similar level of nostalgia and excitement to this reboot.\n\nThankfully, once the plot kicks in, Rugrats finds more solid footing. Having accidentally eaten a worm—well, part of a worm—neurotic Chuckie Finster is convinced he’ll transform into a worm-boy. Determined to rescue him from this wriggling doom, his best friend Tommy Pickles, twins Phil and Lil DeVille, and next-door neighbor Susie Carmichael set out on a quest for a magical MacGuffin. Meanwhile, the bullying Angelica causes chaos for Grandpa Lou by haphazardly swiping right on a senior citizen dating app called “Silver Beagles.”\n\nThe premiere episode promises longtime fans that this is the Rugrats you know and love. Tommy will play the hero. Antagonist Angelica will sneer and make trouble. Chuckle will tremor while Phil and Lil make mud pies, and the slightly older Susie will be a brave voice of reason…well, child logic, anyway. As such, the stories will seamlessly slide from the possible to the “imposterable.” Thus unfurls a trippy neon-colored vision of what Chuckie worm-boy life will be like. Action sequences offer a kiddie car racing recklessly through the bustling lawns of their suburban wonderland. Then, the youngsters scale a massive statue before crashing a concert stage, all unharmed. It’s the kind of playful mayhem that’s sure to appeal to kids and may well delight grown-ups who grew up watching this show.\n\nMore “mature” content is offered through the parents’ plotlines. In the first two episodes offered to critics ahead of release, the Pickles parents and friends reminiscence over a college-rock band, dabble in sibling rivalry, fall in literal puppy love, and battle the house-cleaning can-do of a Marie Kondo type, Lady De-Clutter. These bits are all the B-plots, setting up the confounding scenarios that inspire the titular kiddos into silly schemes, like framing a puppy as a bad dog to make good boy Spike look better. Though sidelined, the parent plotlines lightly lampoon the absurdity of adulting, a theme that might be freshly appreciated by the generation who were raised relating to the Pickles’ kids.\n\nWhile the form and the function are familiar, Rugrats makes mindful changes to the cast of characters. First off, Susie Carmichael is on the scene from the start. She even appears in the opening credits chaos, which re-enacts the original with some flashy revisions. While the kids play, Chuckie rides a Roomba instead of an old-school vacuum, and Grandpa Lou practices yoga instead of snoring on a recliner. Yep, this second time around, Grandpa is a tie-dye-wearing, ponytail-swinging holdover hippie, voiced by beloved character actor Michael McKean.\n\nAnother minor change is the elimination of Howard Deville, the father of Phil and Lil. The sheepish character doesn’t appear in any of the preview episodes and is not listed in press materials. Betty DeVille is a single mom in this version. And—as she casually mentions an ex-girlfriend—she’s queer, officially turning an LGBTQIA+ fan theory into Rugrats canon.\n\nBeyond that, the grown-ups are familiar, even though all the adult characters have been recast. You might not notice the swaps, as some are imitating those formers voices, including Tommy Dewey and Ashley Rae Spillers as Stu and Didi Pickles. Still, comedy nerds may relish picking out the voices of McKean, Nailed It!’s Nicole Byer, Arrested Development’s Tony Hale, and Veep’s Timothy Simons and Anna Chlumsky (who are cheekily teamed as Angelica’s parents, the smug Drew and the workaholic Charlotte).\n\nAs for the Rugrats, E.G. Daily, Cheryl Chase, Nancy Cartwright, Cree Summer, and Kath Soucie have all return to reprise their roles as Tommy, Angelica, Chuckie, Susie, Phil, and Lil respectively. To their credit, none of the bunch have lost a step in all these years away. Their performances are spirited as you’d expect. These are the quirky calamitous kiddos you remember--even if they look different."
