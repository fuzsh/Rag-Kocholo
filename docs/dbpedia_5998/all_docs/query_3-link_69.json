        "text": "If you've ever wondered about the secret world of espionage, a new reality TV show can help fill the blanks.\n\nLater this month, Bravo presents \"Spy Games.\"\n\nCharnel Wright, a veteran broadcast journalist, will compete on the reality competition. Wright formerly worked for WKMG News 6, FLORIDA TODAY's news partner, which covers Orlando, Central Florida and Brevard County.\n\nSail away: 'Below Deck' star Kate Chastain of Melbourne to host fan cruise\n\n'Survivor' finale: Did Palm Bay lifeguard Janet Carbin make it? (SPOILER ALERT)\n\nAccording to her bio on Bravo's website, the 43-year-old public relations specialist of Orlando spent 16 years as a broadcast news reporter, and \"her work as a journalist earned her the nickname 'Dr. Death' because she was known for always going in for the kill during her interviews.\" She apparently used her investigative journalism skills in \"Spy Games,\" too.\n\nInspired by the once-secret World War II government program known as \"Station S,\" in which civilians were assessed and trained to be spies, 10 contestants live together, tasked with gathering intel on their fellow players in this ultimate spy fantasy, a news release states.\n\nModel and martial artist Mia Kang hosts the competition, with real-life intelligence experts coming up with challenges and assessing the contestants’ performances.\n\nThe \"assessors\" in \"Spy Games\" will observe contestants around the clock, train them in spy craft and judge their progress. They are:\n\n• Evy Poumpouras, former special agent for the U.S. Secret Service\n\n• Douglas Laux, former undercover CIA officer\n\n• Erroll Southers, former FBI special agent\n\nThe winner will take home $100,000.\n\nIn the premiere episode, which airs at 10 p.m. Jan. 20, the contestants will need to find allies among a group of strangers in a black-tie gala.\n\nWright cites her journalism background — television anchor, reporter, producer, editor, writer, and videographer — on her website. She listed on-air experience at local and national outlets like ESPN, CBS Local6/WKMG-TV (Orlando), FOX affiliates WBRC-TV/Fox6 (Birmingham, Alabama), and WXXA-TV/Fox 23 (Albany, New York). She currently anchors and reports for Orlando’s News 96.5-FM, formerly Newstalk WDBO, according to charnelwright.com.\n\nOther contestants on \"Spy Games\" include:\n\n• Colin Hutzler of New York City\n\n• Nika Nour of Washington, D.C.\n\n• Christina Randall of Pensacola\n\n• Dr. Mitch Abrams of New Jersey\n\n• Saif Kareem of Jacksonville\n\n• Jessica Studnicky of Los Angeles\n\n• Chelsey Mori of Berkeley, California\n\n• Brock Thompson of Los Angeles\n\n• George Jackson of Long Beach, California\n\nFor a sneak peek of the reality TV competition, visit bravotv.com/spy-games."
