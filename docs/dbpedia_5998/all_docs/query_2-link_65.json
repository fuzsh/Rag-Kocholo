        "text": "dave mcdaniel (2023)\n\nWESH-TV ORLANDO\n\nreporter\n\nWATCH: The Legacy of Dave McDaniel\n\nDave McDaniel has done EVERY job a newsroom has to offer.\n\nHe started his broadcast career in radio, in 1979. In 1988, he joined WESH-TV and has been a force in the newsroom ever since.\n\nSince then, he has covered every hurricane that’s come close to Florida, counting more than 100 storms under his raincoat.\n\nFrom the Vampire Murders to George Zimmerman; Shuttle Columbia to Pulse, Dave has been on the scene of every major story in Central Florida – and can tell you an inside story about each news event.\n\n“He’s the hardest working man in news,” Photojournalist Gordon Portell said. “Forty years later, that hasn’t changed.”\n\nPortell recalls fondly a story from January 1985: “I was at my first television job at KCRG TV in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. As I sat in the quiet newsroom on a Saturday morning, my third day, in storms a huge man rumbling down the hall and across the newsroom like a madman. The reporter across from me yells \"Hello Dave.\" \"Who is that?\" I ask. \"That's Dave\" she says \"the moose, the news moose\". \"He's the assignment editor, anchor, other reporter and the producer\" she says.”\n\nAfter moving from Iowa to Orlando in 1988, Dave has been an advocate for his community. Hosting Christmas parades, and Veterans’ Day breakfast and other events in need of a leader.\n\nGo to Sanford and everyone knows “the news guy”.\n\nWESH 2 Anchor Jim Payne describes Dave McDaniel as “…one awesome journalist, a tireless worker, and definitely one of the guys you want on your team.”\n\n“Dave knows everyone. And everyone knows Dave. That’s because Dave worked his beats just about every day in person. When big stories broke, Dave knew exactly who to call and was usually on the phone before we would ask. He could generate vital information quickly and accurately because he laid a firm foundation of trust with newsmakers. Didn’t matter whether the story reflected positively or negatively on them, they know they can trust Dave,” Payne said. “Dave has won all kinds of awards over the years. Just try to get him to talk about them. He’d rather talk about the story he covered that day, the motorcycle ride he and his wife went on over the weekend, the latest NASCAR race, or where we should be meeting up for a cold drink. Dave is Old School, Midwest, Handshake, Easy Smile, a man of his word. He is clearly worthy of this honor and recognition.”\n\njoan murray (2023)\n\nwfor-TV miami\n\nreporter\n\nWATCH: The Legacy of Joan Murray\n\nJoan Murray is a force to be reckoned with in the broadcasting industry, especially in South Florida. She’s an Emmy award-winning journalist with a sharp focus on covering national breaking news events across West Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale, and Miami over the last 30 years.\n\nHowever, her career started long before that in upstate Pennsylvania. The Philadelphia native made her mark in the broadcasting industry right away, winning the Associated Press and National Press Club awards for her feature and consumer reporting. Murray also reported in Raleigh, North Carolina before making her milestone move to South Florida. She started reporting for WPBF in 1995 and spent many years on the morning shift, making the long drive from Broward to Palm Beach County every day before dawn. However, it was her next career move to Miami that has become the most pivotal point of her career.\n\nMurray joined CBS Miami (WFOR) in August 2001 shortly before the 9/11 attacks. She was among the first to report the South Florida connection to the terrorists. Most recently, Murray covered the Parkland sentencing trial to determine the fate of the confessed school shooter who killed 14 students and three staff members at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018. She was one of only five journalists selected to tour the 1200 building on campus where the massacre happened. Murray was permitted to walk the hallways and classrooms where the shooter gunned down the victims - a crime scene that remained untouched since the mass shooting took place four years prior.\n\nMurray’s relentless dedication to excellence in the journalism industry extends far beyond her daily reports at CBS Miami. She’s quick to spark heartfelt conversations with other reporters and photographers in the field. Her charm and charisma is the foundation that creates strong and lasting connections with others within a matter of minutes. Murray is a passionate mentor to many and goes out of her way to encourage budding journalists to join her station.\n\nEvery now and then, Murray gets a break from the news grind and enjoys spending quality time with her family. That's when she's exploring the world outside of South Florida, traveling internationally with her husband and son.\n\namanda dukes (2023)\n\nWESH-TV ORLANDO\n\nreporter\n\nWATCH: The Legacy of Amanda Dukes\n\nAmanda Dukes, known for most of her career as Amanda Ober, has been at WESH 2 for 25 years.\n\nHired as a co-host for the lifestyle show Discover Orlando, Amanda dazzled the City Beautiful with her warmth and ability to hold her own in any situation...including an interview she never knew would become famous: poolside with Dawn Brancheau and Tillikum at Sea World long before Black Fish. While Discover Orlando didn't last...Amanda's career here was just getting started.\n\nMost notably, Amanda covered the Casey Anthony trial, the wildfires that engulfed Florida in 1998, and the countless deadly hurricanes that battered our coastlines and flooded our communities. She routinely traversed the state, covering politics, including the controversial Presidential election of 2000 when it came down to our votes here in Florida.\n\n“For decades, Amanda Dukes has been the calming, reassuring voice on which WESH 2 viewers have depended. Her carefully chosen words, her confidence and knowledge have helped guide Central Florida through some of the community’s darkest days, and brightest hours,” WESH 2 Anchor Michelle Imperator said. “I’ve worked with Amanda for nearly 10 years. In that time, I’ve watched and admired her as she covered every story with ease. Amanda has literally weathered countless hurricanes, traveling coast to coast showing viewers the conditions battering our communities. Amanda has educated voters through difficult election cycles, covered major criminal trials, a worldwide pandemic and her personal favorite, news that just makes you feel good.\n\n“In a business dominated by heavy headlines, Amanda truly is an uplifting presence, not just on air, but in our newsroom. If you were to ask anyone who has met Amanda Dukes, they would likely describe her as a woman of unwavering faith,” Imperator said.\n\nColleagues say Amanda has left a lasting legacy, not only in the WESH newsroom, but well beyond.\n\n“She has dependably served viewers daily in the Central Florida community for 25 years. Whether on the campaign trail holding politicians accountable, digging into investigative stories, or covering live breaking news, Amanda does it best,” WESH 2 Anchor Meredith McDonough said.\n\nAmanda is a devoted wife, grandmother, and lover of life! When she’s not chasing news stories, she’s in our community helping others! She has severed as a board member for The Christian Service Center, Samaritan Village, J4 Leaders, and Summit Church. She volunteers her time to host countless events for various organizations like Grace Medical Home, House of Hope Orlando, Inside Out Jail Ministries Samaritan Village, Lifework Leadership and Lighthouse of Central Florida.\n\nadrian maucier (2023)\n\nacv network - america te ve miami\n\ndirector, editing/post production\n\nWATCH: The Legacy of Adrian Mauceri\n\nAdrian Mauceri is one of the most dedicated professionals found in any newsroom in Florida.\n\nDirector of Editing and Post Production for America CV Networks – America TeVe, Adrian has earned plenty of recognition in his 30+ year career.\n\nAdrian has worked on a variety of projects, many of which have earned awards from Florida Association of Broadcast Journalists, Suncoast Emmys, and others.\n\nSince his beginnings in his native Argentina, Adrian fell in love with the industry at the age of 17.\n\nEarly in his career, Adrian work for more than a decade editing novellas for worldwide markets. He also worked for 8 years in the world of sports, including various projects for ESPN Argentina. In his early years, he was eager to work and learn, and became involved in projects with a variety of groups, including RAI, Telefe, Ronda Studios, and other news and mini-series projects.\n\nIn May 2000, with the dream of continuing his career in the United States, Adrian moved to Miami.\n\nRecruited by America TeVe, Adrian was eager to showcase his skills, now leading many production aspects as a director overseeing post production and editing operations.\n\nAdrian helps oversees more than 16 productions and 5 live daily news programs.\n\nWith a tremendous workload and constant pressure, his passion for editing has never wavered.\n\nColleagues call Adrian an ultimate professional, always willing to go the extra mile.\n\nCLAIRE METZ (2022)\n\nWESH-TV ORLANDO\n\nreporter\n\nWATCH: The Legacy of Claire Metz\n\nAs of 2022, Claire Metz is WESH 2’s longest-serving on-air employees.\n\nShe started her WESH career in 1981, in production. Blessed with the gift of gab, it didn’t take long for News-types to see Claire’s potential. She made her on-air debut in Orlando for another station (WCPX, now WKMG), but it took less than a year for Claire to come home to WESH 2.\n\nWorking first as a reporter, Claire covered every story the 1980’s had to offer: brush fires, Shuttle launches, and of course, Central Florida’s nude beaches. They were big news back then.\n\nClaire was eventually named anchor of WESH’s Sunrise program and would go on to wake up Central Florida for many years to come. In between anchoring, Claire would cover one of the biggest stories of her career: The capture, prosecution, and death of serial killer Aileen Wuornos.\n\nDuring the trial, Wuornos would blow Claire kisses and call out to her.\n\nClaire interviewed Wuornos on death row and was present for her execution in 2002.\n\nAs strange as it is to have the approving eye of a serial killer, it goes to show you that everyone loves Claire. In 2005, Claire turned off the 2 a.m. alarm clock and became WESH’s Volusia County Bureau Chief. Some call her the Mayor, some call her the Queen.\n\nShe is recognized in every corner of Volusia County and far beyond as well.\n\n“In my nearly four decades in news, I’ve never known a more dedicated journalist, or one who cares more about the people in her community,” WESH Photojournalist Hutch Breneman, a longtime Metz colleague said. “Who else makes beat calls, requests reports and files stories while they’re on vacation? Who else gets a call from a source, and runs out to breaking news with her iPhone in the middle of the night, in her pajamas? Then again, who else covers a hurricane in high heels?”\n\nMIKE VASILINDA (2022)\n\nCAPITOL NEWS SERVICE (STATEWIDE)\n\nPOLITICAL reporter\n\nWATCH: The Legacy of Mike Vasilinda\n\nFor nearly 50 years, Mike Vasilinda has been THE voice when it comes to covering Florida politics.\n\nThe start of the 2022 legislative session, which is the 124th session since Florida became a state in 1845, marks the 49th legislative session Mike has covered, which is 39.51% of all regular sessions since statehood. The high percentage is due to the fact that prior to 1968, the Florida legislature only met every other year.\n\nHe's covered 10 governors and every major event that’s happened in Florida in the past half century.\n\nFrom the Ted Bundy case, to the Challenger explosion, major hurricanes, 2000 election, Parkland school shootings, and so much more.\n\nMike Vasilinda received a Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Political Television Journalism in 2005 for his enterprising coverage of the controversial “Felons List” during the 2004 election cycle.\n\nMike Vasilinda began his career covering Florida Politics while still a student at Florida State University. In January 1974, he founded what is today Florida Public Radio’s Capitol Report, a thirty minute weekly wrap up of legislative news. Soon thereafter, Ray Wise hired Mike to do freelance radio reporting.\n\nMike is the longest continuously-serving member of the Capitol Press Corps, although Bill Cottrell was here in 1969, left, and returned.\n\nIn 1975, Capitol News Service was founded. Back then news was shot on 16mm film and had to be shipped to Tampa, Miami, and Orlando on a noon flight to allow for processing in time for the evening news. Jacksonville’s film was shipped via a Greyhound Bus.\n\nMike purchased video equipment in 1978 and switched from receiving 20 dollars for each story that was used to receiving a monthly retainer. Satellite delivery arrived in 1982. 1983 Mike purchased a Sony BetaCam, the 3rd such unit in Florida. The camera remained the industry workhorse into the 21st century. Today, Capitol News shoots all digital P2 High-Definition cameras, Sony HDV, and the Sony F900 Cinealta. Today, Capitol News Service provides high-definition live shots via the LTN network and can field multiple crews and provides daily coverage to clients via a secure FTP site.\n\nPARIS JANOS (2022)\n\nwJHG-tv PANAMA CITY beach\n\nanchor | reporter\n\nWATCH: The Legacy of Paris Janos\n\nParis Janos retired from WJHG NBC 7 in 2021 after 43 years.\n\nIn that time, he’s done a bit of everything. He started his career at WJHG as the art director, back when weather graphics were painted. His personality was so big, he ended up in front of the camera and for most of his time at the station, he was the morning show’s live reporter. Everyone in the community knows Paris. He’s been helping people wake up in the mornings for decades. As the morning reporter, he could be seen swimming with dolphins, riding in the beach mosquito helicopter, or covering breaking news.\n\nParis represents everything a journalist should strive to be. During his 43 years at WJGH, Paris built many relationships with people in the community. While known for his bubbly and funny personality during live shots, Paris was a trusted journalist. People trust Paris.\n\nWhen he covered breaking news, he did it in a way that informed the public without sensationalizing a situation and causing panic. Behind the scenes, in the newsroom, he was always making people laugh. He was able to teach young reporters how to be confident. Outside of work, he owned a martial arts studio. Each year he would hold a self-defense class for reporters so they would know what to do if they were ever in a bad situation.\n\nParis is also very active in the community, volunteering with different organizations, raising money, and hosting events.\n\ntania rogers (2021)\n\nwptv-tv west palm beach\n\nanchor | reporter\n\nBefore joining WPTV in 1994, Tania Rogers spent a portion of her broadcasting career in radio at WRMB.\n\nShe has been an eyewitness to the changing landscape of Palm Beach County over the course of several decades. She joined WPTV in West Palm Beach in 1994.\n\nHer commitment to community as a reporter and anchor is unmatched in the market.\n\nTania co-anchors NewsChannel 5's weekend newscasts at 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. along with the 10 p.m. broadcast on WFLX.\n\nIn addition to her weekend duties, Tania also reports during the week with a purpose-driven passion to cover what she calls \"people stories\".\n\nOf times, Tania will be in the field solo - managing the shooting, writing, and editing duties as a multimedia journalist under tight deadlines.\n\nEven though her list of responsibilities may be long, she will never hesitate to help other journalists at the station. Especially those who are new to WPTV.\n\nFurthermore, if there's a need to fill-in on the anchor desk during the week, she will always make it happen. Even if she spent the first part of her day as an 'MMJ'.\n\nTania's list of volunteer work is extensive and includes a list of countless organizations including The Children's Place and Hospice of Palm Beach County and the Urban League of Palm Beach County.\n\nAccording to Tania, what surprises people the most about her is when they learn her parents are Hispanic. As a young girl, she spent two years living in Panama and speaks Spanish fluently. Being bilingual is another way for Tania to connect with even more communities in our fast-growing region. Over the last year, she's also been spotted anchoring WPTV's 'En Espanol' newscast!\n\nWhen she's not at work, she's at home spending time with her two daughters, husband, and family dog. Tania is also a very active member of her church, especially during the holidays as the chairperson of the Annual Women's Christmas Dessert party, which brings women from across Palm Beach County together.\n\nart myers (2021)\n\nwctv-tv tallahassee\n\nanchor\n\nTo know Art Myers is to love him. He's adored by the community and our newsroom. I'm in constant amazement that, after more than 40-years in the news business, he never comes across jaded. Seriously, the man always has a smile and a joke for you and for working in a newsroom, is one of the calmest people under pressure.\n\nAlso, he's done the morning show for 37-YEARS! I anchored the morning show for about seven at my last station and can't imagine spending almost four decades getting up at 2 a.m. But he loves it. His longest co-anchor of 15 years, Anna Johnson, says it best, \"I love Art, our staff loves Art, management loves Art, but more importantly, our viewers love Art. Viewers do not like change, especially early in the morning. So, they always knew Art would be there to give them the latest news information going on in our community. It takes a special person to each day, put a smile on your face early in the morning and make the viewers feel like he is talking just to them. That is Art Myers. Art loves God, his wife, his WCTV family and his community.\"\n\nArt Myers is so deserving of the FABJ Legacy Award because he IS the bedrock of WCTV's legacy. Art has announced to the newsroom he's retiring in December of 2021. We are so happy for his next chapter, and so he can sleep in!\n\nHowever, we also know that leaves giant shoes that can never truly be filled. To me, that's what a legacy is all about. When someone truly becomes engrained in the fabric of your station. He has a servants heart and doesn't seek out the spotlight. That's why I would love for you to consider him for this award and help us, at WCTV, give him the send-off he deserves for his contributions to us and the Big Bend/South Georgia community."
