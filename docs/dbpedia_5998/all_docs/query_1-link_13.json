        "text": "Ever feel lost in a new role? ü§ù Our mentorship program, WKMG Connections, is a guide to our newcomers - having a seasoned mentor can make all the difference. They offer invaluable advice, support, and a helping hand when you need it most. üí° Let's eliminate the feeling of being adrift and set our teammates up for success, like Destiny Santana who was partnered with Ginger Gadsden. Here is what Destiny had to say about her experience: \"When I was hired full time at News 6, I could have easily felt lost within such a large company because I was new to the industry and the market. However, having Ginger as a mentor has made me feel seen and safe. We hit it off from the beginning and I didn‚Äôt realize we had so many things in common. She is always positive, uplifting, and constantly provides me with feedback to help me learn and grow as a photojournalist. I feel blessed to have had this opportunity with her. As she likes to say, her mentorship doesn't end after the 6-month mark; instead, I didn‚Äôt just gain a mentor but a friend!\" #Mentorship #News6 #GettingResults #Connections\n\nLet us sow seeds of equity for the women of tomorrow. Our actions today, like the female pioneers who shattered glass ceilings and faced incomprehensible challenges before us, can shape the lives of the girls who will rise. By mentoring and nurturing the next generation, let us light the path for a future where equity shines. At WKMG News 6, female leaders like Miia Ollesh, Research Director, are at the forefront of this commitment. #WomensEqualityDay #TrueEquality #EqualityWithoutThought #EqualPay #News6 #GettingResults #WomenLeadership #FemaleLeaders\n\nWKMG News 6‚Äôs Regional Director of Finance, Laura Genette, reminds us that while we celebrate our achievements today, our work towards fairness and equality is far from over. Let‚Äôs continue to push for a world where everyone, regardless of their sex or gender, has an equal opportunity to succeed. Our inclusive workplace culture, where everyone‚Äôs contributions are valued, is evidence to the growth mindset of leaders like Laura. As members of society, we have a responsibility to promote equality and to inspire the next generation of women leaders. #WomensEqualityDay #TrueEquality #EqualityWithoutThought #EqualPay #News6 #GettingResults #WomenLeadership #FemaleLeaders"
