        "text": "A witness says she had just loaded a washing machine at Classic Landry in Ocala when she heard a loud noise and smelled gas before the explosion. She was among those who were injured.\n\nA massive explosion at a central Florida laundromat sent debris flying out into the street and injured four people.\n\nThe explosion at Classic Laundromat in Ocala happened just after 6 p.m. Tuesday, Ocala Fire Rescue said in a news release.\n\nCrews and first responders arrived on scene to find \"smoke and flames coming from the area of the laundromat.\" Video taken from a security camera across the street shows debris exploding into the laundromat parking lot and destroying the facility.\n\nWhile medics assessed patients and took two of the four injured to a hospital, firefighters got the flames under control and searched for any other people who may have been inside.\n\nCause of explosion under investigation\n\nThe cause of the explosion is not yet known, and Ocala Fire Rescue said the matter is under investigation by the State Fire Marshals office and Ocala Fire Rescue Inspectors. Ocala Fire Rescue did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for an update on investigations Thursday.\n\nThe fire department said the laundromat and seven adjacent shops were deemed to be unfit for regular operations by inspectors.\n\nWitness recounts explosion\n\nMarilyn Vega Ortiz told the Star Banner, part of the USA TODAY NETWORK, that she had just loaded a washing machine at the laundromat when she heard a loud noise and smelled gas.\n\nHoping it wasn't a gas leak, Ortiz opened the front door to let some air in and walked to a liquor store in the same strip mall, where she spoke with an employee and told them about the gas. He also smelled gas.\n\nOrtiz, a regular patron of the laundromat, then called and texted the laundromat's owners and alerted them of the situation.\n\nHer clothes had finished washing by then and just as she put them into a dryer and started the machine, the explosion happened, hitting her with debris.\n\nOrtiz's adult daughter, India Delgado, was also inside the laundromat with her boyfriend at the time of the explosion. Though they helped Ortiz, they were also injured and had to be taken to a local hospital for treatment.\n\nDelgado told WKMG-TV that her boyfriend had a broken leg and some burns. There was no immediate information about the other injuries.\n\nSaman Shafiq is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.
