Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display WKMG-TV's virtual channel as 6.1.\n\nChannel Programming 6.1 WKMG-DT 6.2 LATV\n\n[edit] History[]\n\nThe station first took to the air on July 1, 1954; as WDBO-TV, which stood for \"Daytona Beach Orlando\", But locals would call it \"Way Down By Orlando.\" It is the sixth-oldest station in Florida, and the oldest in Central Florida. It was originally owned by the Orlando Broadcasting Company along with WDBO radio (AM 580 and FM 92.3, now WWKA).\n\nAs the only station in the market at its inception, it originally carried programming from all four networks of the time — CBS, NBC, ABC and DuMont. DuMont would shut down most network operations in 1955, but honor network commitments until 1956; at that point, DuMont disappeared from the schedule. It lost NBC when Daytona Beach's WESH expanded its signal to cover all of Central Florida in 1957, and ABC when WLOF-TV (now WFTV) signed on in 1958.\n\nOrlando Broadcasting merged with Cherry Broadcasting in 1957. In 1963, WDBO-AM-FM-TV were sold to The Outlet Company.\n\nIn 1982, WDBO AM-FM was sold to Katz Broadcasting, as Outlet decided to begin exiting radio. Outlet was nearly bought out by Columbia Pictures around the same time. In advance of this, channel 6 prematurely changed its call letters to WCPX-TV, which stood for \"W Columbia PiX\" (shorthand for \"Pictures\"). While the deal fell through, channel 6 kept the WCPX calls for 16 years.\n\nOutlet pared down its holdings after a buyout in 1986, selling off many stations. At that point, WCPX was sold to First Media, Inc.\n\nIn the early 1990s WCPX decided to move the CBS program Picket Fences from Friday evening to 11:35 pm on Saturday so that it could air Star Trek: The Next Generation on Friday evenings. WCPX also pre-empted some CBS sports programs as well. In 1994, WCPX hired a new general manager, Brooke Spectorsky, from WUAB in Cleveland. (Spectorsky is now general manager of WKYC-TV in Cleveland.) Under Spectorsky, WCPX put Picket Fences back at its normal time.\n\nIn 1995, WCPX was one of the first CBS affiliates to air Guiding Light at 10 a.m. instead of 3 p.m., which was the normal time to air it. Under this arrangement, the program would air on a one day delay. However, CBS soon discovered that several of its O&O's were doing the same thing. CBS then decided to provide two (eventually three) same day feeds of Guiding Light to its stations (one at 9 a.m., 10 a.m., and 3 p.m.). WKMG aired Guiding Light at 9 a.m. up until September 18, 2009. It currently airs Let's Make a Deal at 9 a.m.\n\n[2][3]WKMG-TV logo from 1998In 1997, First Media merged with Meredith Corporation, which already owned Fox affiliate WOFL. At the time, duopolies were not allowed, and Meredith decided to keep WOFL (which has since been sold to Fox). In mid-1997, Meredith swapped WCPX to Post-Newsweek Stations in exchange for Hartford, Connecticut's WFSB (which at the time was Post-Newsweek's flagship). On January 30, 1998, the station changed its callsign to WKMG in honor of longtime Washington Post publisher, Katharine M. Graham. As of recently, WKMG is the last \"Big Six\" affiliate in Orlando that is not part of any television duopoly (Fox/Newscorp's WOFL/WRBW, Cox's WFTV/WRDQ and Hearst-Argyle's WESH/WKCF).\n\nWKMG's audio signal formerly available on 87.7 FM-radio ceased on June 12, 2009 with the national analog turn-off date.\n\n[edit] News operation[]\n\nFrom the late 1980s until 2001, the station was almost always in last place in the ratings. At the same time, WESH and WFTV battled for first place in the Orlando market, and basically continued to do so into the early 2000s; however, in the past few years, WFTV has become the dominant station (though channel 6 claimed first place at 11 p.m. in the May 2006 ratings period). Management changes had a number of GMs on the treadmill with Mike Schweitzer, Kathleen Keefe, Jeff Sales and Henry Maldonado all taking a turn at the top. News and Sales Departments had similar turnover with at least 5 News Directors taking the chair between 2000 and 2008. Sales Managers included Connie Albino for a short tenure before being replaced by Tom Calato. Internet Broadcasting Systems provided the Internet site named \"myCFnow.com\" by Sales; it then switched to \"local6.com\", and is currently known as \"clickorlando.com\". Currently, despite the strength of CBS prime-time programming, WKMG has been trading second and third place with WESH in the evening newscast ratings except at 11 pm, where until recently it waged a spirited battle with WFTV for first. From late 2007 until March 2009, WKMG's 11 pm newscast was in second place behind WFTV. Continuing its ratings slide, the May 2009 sweeps found WKMG's newscasts finishing in third place in all time slots, behind WFTV and WESH. In fact, despite being number one in prime time WKMG's late night newscast has failed to hold on to its lead-in audience for the most part. The siphoning off in news audience share appears to have held in the November 2009 sweeps period, when WKMG remained in a distant third place weekday evenings while its morning and late night newscasts improved slightly although still in a distant second place.\n\nThe main news anchors at WKMG currently are Mike Garofalo and Lauren Rowe; they anchor the 6 and 11pm newscast. Rowe moved to help co-anchor the morning news with Erick Weber before returning to nights, joining Garafalo for the 11pm news. Reporter Laura Diaz now anchors The Morning News with Erick Weber. Before May 1, 2009, former news anchor Jacqueline London anchored the 4pm, 5pm, 6pm, and 11pm newscasts with Garofalo and solo anchored the 5:30pm newscast.\n\nIn 2008, WKMG-TV began broadcasting its news in SD 16:9 widescreen format. WKMG is currently the only major station in the Orlando market which has yet to upgrade its newscasts to full high definition.\n\nAs of Monday, May 1, 2009, the 4:00, 5:00 and 5:30 newscasts were axed, thus shaking up the afternoon/early evening schedule. Extra airs at 4:00; Inside Edition still holds the 4:30 half hour, and now has an additional airing at 7:30; and Dr. Phil moved to 5:00 (following the leads of Post-Newsweek sister station WPLG and cross-state rival WTSP). Local 6 News at 6:00 expanded to an hour - creating the market's first and only full hour of news at 6:00 (titled \"The 6:00 News\") and pushed the CBS Evening News to 7:00.\n\n[edit] Controversy[]\n\nIn April 2010 News Director Steve Hyvonen called for a \"Newsroom Summit,\" and required his employees to vote for 3 employees who would be considered \"Battery Drainers.\" Nomination of management was exempted from the vote.[1]\n\n[edit] Personalities[]\n\n[edit] News Anchors[]\n\nMike Garofalo - The 6:00 News and Local 6 News at 11pm (Sunday- Thursday)\n\nLauren Rowe - The 6:00 News and Local 6 News at 11pm (Monday- Friday)\n\nErick Weber - The Morning News (5am-7am) and Local 6 News at Noon\n\nLaura Diaz - The Morning News (5am-7am) and reporter\n\nErik von Ancken - Saturday 6:30pm & 11pm and reporter Monday-Wednesday at 11pm\n\n[edit] Meteorologists[]\n\nTom Sorrells - Meteorologist seen on The 6:00 News and Local 6 news at 11- Chief Meteorologist (AMS-CBM/NWA)\n\nTroy Bridges - Morning and Noon Meteorologist(AMS)\n\nElizabeth Hart - Weekends\n\nJulie Broughton - temporary fill-in meteorologist (NWA)\n\n[edit] Sportscasters[]\n\nDavid Pingalore (on-air stage name: Ping) - sports director - The 6:00 News & Local 6 News at 11\n\nTodd Romero - Weekends 6:30pm and 11pm and sports reporter\n\n[edit] Reporters[]\n\nMike DeForest - weekdays, The 6:00 News\n\nJR Stone - weekdays, The Morning News\n\nLouis Bolden - weekdays, The 6:00 News\n\nJessica D'Onofrio - weeknights, Sunday-Thursday 11pm\n\nJessica Sanchez - weekday traffic, The Morning News\n\nChris Trenkmann - weekdays, The 6:00 News\n\nNicole Pesecky - \"The\" 6:00 News\n\n[edit] Local 6 Problem Solvers[]\n\nSteven Cooper - consumer reports\n\nMike Holfeld - investigative reports\n\nTony Pipitone - investigative reports\n\n[edit] Notable alumni[]\n\nJacqueline London\n\nDonald Forbes\n\nTarik Minor - Now at WJXT\n\nScott Rates- Now at WFTV\n\nRamin Khalili\n\nBob Frier- Now at WOFL-TV\n\nTodd Jurkowski - Currently Press Secretary for Rep.
