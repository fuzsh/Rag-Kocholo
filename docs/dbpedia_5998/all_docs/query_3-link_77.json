        "text": "The Super Bowl has long been an American spectacle. Every second of the game itself is scrutinized, and for good reason. After all, the Lombardi Trophy is what NFL teams play for all season. Even beyond the game, every movement is closely watched, down to the halftime show and pregame ceremonies.\n\nSUPER BOWL 58 HQ: Live 49ers vs. Chiefs updates | Taylor Swift tracker | Halftime show\n\nNo network owns the permanent rights to the Super Bowl. The big game is split between three -- and soon four -- different networks on a rotating basis, giving different broadcasters a chance to call America's premier sporting event.\n\nThe network that gets to host the Super Bowl doesn't just broadcast a football game. It also has the performances, commercials, and extended pregame coverage that draw in millions of additional viewers.\n\nHere are the details about the Super Bowl 58 broadcast and how you can watch it.\n\nMORE: Watch Super Bowl 58 live with Paramount+\n\nWho is broadcasting the Super Bowl in 2024?\n\nCBS is broadcasting Super Bowl 58 on Feb. 11, 2024, taking its turn in a rotation of three networks that will soon become four. NBC, CBS, and Fox alternate Super Bowl broadcasts, and ABC will join the rotation with Super Bowl 61 in February 2027.\n\nSuper Bowl 58 can also be streamed live on Paramount+.\n\nCBS revealed some of its Super Bowl 58 broadcast plans on Feb. 2, giving insight into what the production will look like. CBS will have 165 cameras on hand, including \"doink cameras\" embedded in each goalpost. One more addition will be the \"Red Cat cam,\" which offers an aerial view of the field from Allegiant Stadium's catwalks. The camera could give fans at home a clearer view of goal-line plays.\n\nThe network will have nearly 1,000 personnel in Las Vegas for the big game and is planning to have cameras all over the city for extended coverage of the scenes before and during the Super Bowl.\n\nDespite being such a hot commodity, Super Bowl broadcasting rights are actually set all the way through the 2033 season. Fox is set to broadcast Super Bowl 59, while NBC will take its turn with Super Bowl 60 ahead of its 2026 Summer Olympics coverage.\n\nBelow is the list of Super Bowls that have been broadcast with the rotation set by the current TV agreement.\n\nSuper Bowl Broadcast network NFL season Super Bowl 58 (49ers vs. Chiefs) CBS 2023 Super Bowl 57 (Chiefs vs. Eagles) Fox 2022 Super Bowl 56 (Rams vs. Bengals) NBC 2021 Super Bowl 55 (Buccaneers vs. Chiefs) CBS 2020 Super Bowl 54 (49ers vs. Chiefs) Fox 2019 Super Bowl 53 (Rams vs. Patriots) CBS 2018 Super Bowl 52 (Eagles vs. Patriots) NBC 2017 Super Bowl 51 (Falcons vs. Patriots) Fox 2016 Super Bowl 50 (Panthers vs. Broncos) CBS 2015 Super Bowl 49 (Seahawks vs. Patriots) NBC 2014 Super Bowl 48 (Seahawks vs. Broncos) Fox 2013 Super Bowl 47 (49ers vs. Ravens) CBS 2012 Super Bowl 46 (Giants vs. Patriots) NBC 2011 Super Bowl 45 (Packers vs. Steelers) Fox 2010 Super Bowl 44 (Saints vs. Colts) CBS 2009 Super Bowl 43 (Cardinals vs. Steelers) NBC 2008 Super Bowl 42 (Giants vs. Patriots) Fox 2007 Super Bowl 41 (Bears vs. Colts) CBS 2006\n\nHow much does it cost to broadcast the Super Bowl?\n\nThe NFL does not sell the rights to broadcast the Super Bowl individually, so the cost is covered under what each of the networks pay for general NFL broadcasting rights.\n\nCBS, Fox, and NBC all pay an excess of $2 billion to broadcast the NFL under the league's new broadcast deal. Fox ($2.2 billion) is the biggest spender, NBC ($2 billion) spends the least and CBS ($2.1 billion) ranks right in the middle. These numbers are more than double what each side paid under the previous deal. The current deal was agreed upon in 2021.\n\nAdditionally, Amazon Prime pays $1 billion just for the \"Thursday Night Football\" window alone.\n\nAll of these agreements mean the NFL is making billions of dollars from its television partners, but the hefty price these networks pay (aside from Amazon Prime) comes with the benefit of being part of the coveted Super Bowl rotation.\n\nMORE: Complete guide to Super Bowl 58\n\nSuper Bowl announcers: Jim Nantz and Tony Romo\n\nLast year's Super Bowl broadcast threw some viewers for a loop, as two first-timers, Kevin Burkhardt and Greg Olsen, were in the Fox booth. That won't be the case this year.\n\nPlay-by-play broadcaster Jim Nantz will be on the call from Las Vegas alongside color commentator Tony Romo, marking Nantz's seventh Super Bowl in the CBS booth and Romo's third.\n\nNantz served as CBS' pregame host and leader of the trophy presentation for Super Bowls at the end of the 2000 and '03 seasons, but he first got the opportunity to call the big game in February of '07 at Super Bowl 41. Since then, Nantz has called classics, including the Saints' victory over the Colts and the Ravens' \"Blackout Bowl\" win over the 49ers.\n\nMORE: Where is Jim Nantz from?\n\nRomo joined the CBS booth after his retirement in 2017, instantly becoming Nantz's partner on the network's top broadcast team. This will be his third Super Bowl, though it will notably be Romo's first that doesn't end in Tom Brady winning. Romo was in the booth for Super Bowls 53 and 55, the first of which was Brady's final championship with the Patriots and the latter of which was the quarterback's lone title with the Buccaneers.\n\nNantz and Romo have called one Super Bowl featuring Patrick Mahomes: a loss to Brady and the Buccaneers three years ago. They will have the opportunity again as the Chiefs face the 49ers for the second time in five years.\n\nOnly six different play-by-play broadcasters have called the Super Bowl since the start of the century: Nantz, Burkhardt, Al Michaels, Joe Buck, Greg Gumbel, and Pat Summerall. Mike Tirico is expected to join the ranks when NBC hosts Super Bowl 60.\n\nSuper Bowl sideline reporters: Tracy Wolfson and Evan Washburn\n\nTracy Wolfson and Evan Washburn will serve as CBS' sideline reporters for Super Bowl 58.\n\nWolfson has worked with the network's No. 1 crew, led by Jim Nantz, since the 2014 season. This will be her fifth Super Bowl as a sideline reporter, a stretch that began with Super Bowl 47 between the Ravens and 49ers.\n\nWashburn works with CBS' No. 2 crew, led by Ian Eagle, but networks traditionally switch to two sideline reporters for the Super Bowl to ensure they have both teams covered well. This will be Washburn's fourth Super Bowl for CBS, with his first being the Broncos' Super Bowl 50 win over Carolina.\n\nOne of Wolfson and Washburn will be assigned to the Chiefs, while the other will be assigned to the 49ers.\n\nWhat channel is the Super Bowl on?\n\nSuper Bowl 58 will be broadcast nationally on CBS.\n\nBelow are the top 25 TV markets in the United States and the local Fox affiliate for each."
