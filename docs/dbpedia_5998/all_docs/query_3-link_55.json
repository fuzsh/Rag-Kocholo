        "text": "Danny Treanor IS a frequent Space Coast Daily Special Correspondent\n\nORLANDO, FLORIDA – Danny Treanor, one of Central Florida’s most well-known TV personalities, announced his retirement from WKMG Channel 6, effective Wednesday.\n\nTreanor, who started his career on the radio, previously spent 10 years with Central Florida News 13, and from 1978 to 1996, he was one of Florida’s most popular weathermen on the Orlando ABC affiliate, WFTV Channel 9 for almost 20 years.\n\n“In 1978, I came to Central Florida to talk to you about the weather,” said Treanor to his many fans and admirers.\n\n“Since that time, you’ve allowed me to come into your home many, many times. I just wanted to thank you for the last 41 years.”\n\nTreanor said it’s better to walk out than be wheeled out. It’s better to be seen than to be viewed.\n\n“I want to be able to do things while I’m still capable,” Treanor, 74, said Friday to the Orlando Sentinel.\n\n“I love working because I so defined myself by my work. Sometimes I have a fear of not working. I’m going to have to find other things. I don’t think I’ll be sampling the other TV world anymore.”\n\nTreanor plans to travel in his retirement but said there’s a possibility he would be doing hurricane coverage or filling in during Christmas at WKMG TV.\n\nAs a frequent Space Coast Daily Special Correspondent for the past six years, don’t be surprised to see Treanor bringing his talents to the Space Coast conducting Red Carpet interviews at the Space Coast Sports Hall of Fame induction and Central Florida Humanitarian Gala, in addition to doing weather-related content.\n\nABOVE VIDEO: 1983 Opening video of WFTV’s evening news, with Danny Treanor."
