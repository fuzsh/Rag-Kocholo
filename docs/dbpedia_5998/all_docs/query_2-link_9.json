        "text": "I won't watch any other news station. The news crews, Anchors all get along so well, the humorous and genuine personalities all go so well together. Tom Sorrels got me to watch the weather, the other weatherman I had watched in the past had the personalities of a dark dreary boring day. Tom, now he had me laughing interested in his explanations of what is actually happening. The Anchor desk always has fun and it entertains us in between the news. As you can see I could go on forever. Ginger and I both wear our heart on our sleeves and I'm tearing up as she tells the story as she tears up. I â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸ News on 6!!!\n\nI am so happy this is available now. Since I moved to the Tampa Bay area over a year ago, I have missed my local news stations in Orlando, my beloved home for 19 years. Our town is actually in between both Tampa and Orlando, but considered part of the Tampa Bay Area. Orlando news is relevant to me and my spouse as we travel to Orlando frequently. Seeing all of the familiar faces from the morning, noon, and evening news programs is great too.\n\nI have had this app for a long time since News 6 is the best news in Orlandoâ¦HOWEVER, the alert system has been broken for years at this point and they will not bother fixing it. I only have âBreaking Newsâ alerts on and have turned off all other categories, yet I am receiving constant notifications throughout the day about mundane news. I am finally leaving this review because itâs 2AM and I have gotten about 20 alerts in the last 30 minutes about a rocket launch. I donât care!!! This isnât breaking news and itâs the middle of the night. Please fix this!"
