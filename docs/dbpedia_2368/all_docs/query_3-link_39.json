        "text": "Chicago is the greatest city in the world, and while this might be a biased statement on my behalf, I think that people wouldn’t disagree too often even if they’re not from here. As far as the music scene goes, I love how so many household names have come up in the same proverbial class as one another, and even after achieving insane feats throughout their careers, they seem to always find a way to come back together and continue to make unbelievable music.\n\nMost recently, this happened on a debut single by Hoofy Baby entitled “Tell Me Lies” which features legends like Mick Jenkins, Jean Deaux, and Qari. Hoofy is someone I wasn’t familiar with prior, but it turns out that he is the executive producer at MadeUp Records, so it’s safe to say that the instrumental he created for this one is an absolute home run. Jean handles the hook by sharing a somewhat menacing yet mischievous flow that just glides so smoothly over the beat without too much force or intensity, letting her flow handle the bulk of the dynamism.\n\nMick takes the baton for the second verse, getting much more candid and blatant with his delivery so that way any and all of the lyrics he spits are easily ingested and understood because some of the topics he speaks on definitely shouldn’t get misconstrued. Finally, Qari finishes things off with a total change of pace, using a delivery that is as rapid as it is masterful and swift, making yet another example out of the fact that he’s able to go toe-to-toe with the best and not break a sweat. “Tell Me Lies” shows three Chicago emcees at their best, which is why I couldn’t resist sharing it with you all, especially after expressing my admiration for the Windy City hip-hop scene so many times in the past."
