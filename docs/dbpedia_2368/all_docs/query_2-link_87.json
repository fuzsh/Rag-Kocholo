        "text": "Allen Ginsberg, Jacques Levy, Emmylou Harris, Scarlet Rivera, Rubin ‘Hurricane’ Carter, Joseph ‘Crazy Joe’ Gallo, New York City, a gypsy vibe, New York City – an amazing cast and heady backdrop, setting the scene for some mid-seventies musical magic – Bob Dylan’s brilliant ‘Desire’ album!\n\nSo, how did it come to pass that Bob Dylan, probably the greatest songwriter/wordsmith of a generation, came to work with a co-writer just after completing one of his finest works at the peak of his powers?\n\nFilm director Jacques Levy was interviewed for ‘The Prism Archive’ in May 2004, four months before he passed away:\n\nLevy says his second meeting with Dylan was ‘complete serendipity’, recalling that Bob was walking past his house on LaGuardia Place in Manhattan on his way to ‘The Other End’, a bar in Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, where Levy ‘often hung out’. Levy spoke to Dylan and they both went to ‘The Other End’, ‘hung out’ and had a drink…According to Levy, “the two of us connected”, he invited Bob back to his place and they wrote that night – “I think it was ‘Isis’”, says Levy…\n\n”Well it was partly the chemistry and partly…He’d heard the lyrics that I’d written for McGuinn. (Roger McGuinn of The Byrds) He’d heard ‘Chestnut Mare’, which is the most famous of the songs…and I think he liked the idea that I could tell a story…” Levy says that Dylan doesn’t usually tell stories in his songs.\n\nBob Dylan and Jacques Levy – songwriters extraordinaire…\n\n”He said he liked the stuff I’d written for McGuinn and said…those magic words…’I’d like you to write some stuff for me’…Well, first of all, it put me a little nervous and I said to him ‘Well, you know I write the lyrics, I don’t write the music…And he said, ‘Yeah, I know’. Our styles are obviously different…and I love his style, but I wasn’t about to copy it. I said ‘Are you in New York for a while and he said ‘Yes’. So ‘Why don’t we get together tomorrow and we’ll see what we can do?” He said ‘Fine’…”\n\n”I wasn’t a hundred percent sure he’d come over…I thought it might be just one of those passing things that happen when you meet somebody…but, sure enough, he showed up, when he said he was going to show, and he brought his guitar with him and he said he’d just come back from..I think it was Spain, or the South of France, I’m not sure where…where he’d been for the summer and he’d been involved with some gypsies and so on and he said he’d written a couple of songs, so he played me what he’d written, because he wanted to give me some sense of the mood and I was very glad that he did because it had a lot to do with what we did afterwards. He’d written ‘One More Cup Of Coffee’ and he had part of the song ‘Sara’ written…not the whole song…So he sang those couple of songs to me and we got to work. He didn’t have a tune for anything and I didn’t have any words – There was nothing prepared…He would play a coupla chords and I might come up with a coupla words or a phrase or whatever and we just kept going back and forth that way.”\n\n“He’s not an egotistical guy at all and he loved the idea that I didn’t know some of his stuff…”\n\nDylan described his take on the partnership in an interview with Bill Flanagan in 1985:\n\n”Co-writer. That was probably an album where I didn’t have anything and I wasn’t even thinking about making a record. I think I ran into Jacques downtown and we went off and just wrote some songs.”\n\nLevy and Dylan decided that they needed to get out of New York to concentrate on the writing, so decamped to ‘Lilypond Lane’, Dylan’s house in The Hamptons (namechecked in the song ‘Sara’), spending three weeks to a month up there. The pair co-wrote seven out of the nine songs on the album.\n\nDylan’s poetic sleeve notes\n\nIan Bell, rightly points out the flaws in Allen Ginsberg’s stream-of-consciousness sleeve ramblings, sounding very much like an homage to the Dylan-deity with scant and only grudging regard for Jacques Levy’s significant songwriting contribution:\n\n”Ginsberg, contributing stray thoughts in fervid sleeve-note jottings, would not linger long over the question of authorship, or whether such a thing mattered. In the poet’s ecstatic prose, these were ‘Dylan’s Redemption Songs! If he can do it we can do it. America can do it.’ Levy had a 35 per cent copyright share, by contract, in those seven featured works, but the appraiser from the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics found only ‘the culmination of Poetry-music as dreamt of in the ‘50s and early 60s…poet alone at microphone reciting-singing surreal history love text ending in giant “Yeah!” when minstrel gives his heart away& says he wants to stay. Dylan will stay here with us!…Precisely because Ginsberg knew all about Levy, however, he was obliged at length to concede that ‘Half-month was spent solitary on Long Island with theatrist Jacques Levy working on song facts phrases and rhymes, sharing information seriousness.’ The seer, jotting down notes, did not explain how Dylan could have spent his time both ‘solitary’ and in intense collaboration.”\n\nIn the 2004 Prism interview, Levy expressed amazement at the power Dylan had in his relationship with Columbia records:\n\n”He makes a phone call…and he’s calling CBS. He says ‘get ready – We’re gonna come in in a couple of weeks – We got a new album…”\n\nLevy tells the story of the spontaneous involvement of Scarlet Rivera, to affect the whole sound of the record:\n\n”Putting together the band was sort of interesting…We had a drummer and we had a bass player…and Bob was going to play guitar of course and harp -harmonica. We were driving along one day, along Houston Street and he saw ahead of us, this quite extraordinary-looking young lady with this long black hair, carrying a violin case – it was Scarlet – and he pulls up alongside her in the car, rolls down the window, says ‘Hi’, she looks in and says ‘Hi’ and he said ‘Do you play that?’ and she says ‘Yes’ and he said ‘Would you like to play that with me?’ and she said ‘Yes’, you know and, sure enough, she came up to the studio, and she played the hell out of it, sorta gypsy violin…She was quite an extraordinary young lady. So now we had the basis of a band. There were no arrangements, no nothing…It was improvisational…”\n\nIan Bell quotes Rivera speaking to ‘People’ magazine in ‘Time Out Of Mind’ and, as is the case with most of the stories surrounding this ‘mystical’ album, a different kind of truth emerges!\n\n”Then this car somes up and cuts me off. Some ugly green car. The guy driving asked me if I really knew how to play the violin. Actually he had this woman next to him ask me. He asked her to ask me for my phone number, but I told her to tell him that I didn’t give out my number to somebody stopping me on the street.”\n\nLevy gives his take on how Emmylou Harris became part of the band for the album:\n\n”He said something to me about ‘Do we need another singer?’ and I said I thought it’d be a good idea so called up Emmylou Harris, and she came into New York, or she was in New York I don’t know which, and she recorded for Columbia also, and she came, and she was just fabulous.\n\nAndrew Vaughan interviewed Emmylou Harris interview for Gibson on 7th September 2010 and sheds some light on Emmylou’s involvement:\n\nAndrew Vaughan: “When you got a call to work with Bob Dylan on Desire, I read that he didn’t actually know who you were. Is that true?”\n\nEmmylou Harris: “There was a fellow at Columbia that was a fan, who was like an executive producer, and I think Dylan told him “I need a girl singer.” Don DeVito was his name and I got a call that Dylan wants you to sing, but that wasn’t true because he just wanted a girl singer. I mean we basically shook hands and started recording. I didn’t know the songs, the lyrics were in front of me, and the band would start playing and he would kind of poke me when he wanted me to jump in. Somehow I watched his mouth with one eye and the lyrics with the other. You couldn’t fix anything. What happened in a moment was on the record.”\n\nAndrew Vaughan: “I guess he was happy with it.”\n\nEmmylou Harris: “Yeah, I guess so. He didn’t take me off the record. Well, he couldn’t have because everything blended into everything else.”\n\nAndrew Vaughan: “Well that’s still a good story to tell all these years later. That was a great record, I think. To be on any of his records …”\n\nEmmylou Harris: “Actually there was so much fire; it was wonderful. How great that he is still out there on a bus just making great music. It’s amazing.”\n\n‘Desire’ was recorded over only six days in 1975 in Columbia Studios, New York City: July 14th, 28th, 29th, 30th, 31st and October 24th (the later date principally to re-record ‘Hurricane’, for reasons we will come on to). The album was released on January 16th 1976.\n\nAccording to Dylan completist Clinton Heylin, the sessions on 28th and 29th July were chaotic in terms of direction and recording methods. Neil Hubbard, guitarist with English ‘pub-rock’ band Kokomo describes the scene:\n\n”There were five guitarists including me and Eric Clapton…and there was no one in overall control – no producer or anything.”\n\nHeylin says of the sessions that “For most of the musicians it was a traumatic introduction to Dylan’s working methods. Using anywhere up to six guitars (three acoustics, Dylan’s included, two electrics – Eric Clapton or Hugh McCracken trading lead – and Erik Frandsen on slide), before mixing a mandolin, accordion, harmonica, trumpet, organ, tamnourine, violin and harmony vocals, in-house producer Don Devito was obliged to ‘stack’ the organ, violin and ‘percussion’ on one of the sixteen recording tracks available (a disastrous decision that precluded remixing Scarlet’s often off-key violin.”\n\nHeylin also says that “Dylan’s choice of musicians and instrumentation seemed at times as haphazard as the recording process. Aside from assorted members of English pub-rock combo Kokomo, who chipped in on most songs, Eric Clapton contributed to six of the seven cuts attempted on the twenty-eighth. On the other hand, Clapton’s regular backing singer Yvonne Elliman went largely unused, and slide guitarist Erik Frandsen’s only real moment came on a subdued paean to baseball hero ‘Catfish’ Hunter (of the four ‘Desire’ outtakes ‘given air’ since the album’s release, ‘Catfish’, the only one from the big band sessions, hardly represents how this band might have sounded).”\n\n’Hurricane’\n\nJacques Levy recalls the roots of ‘Hurricane’ and the night he first started writing with Dylan, in a 2004 interview:\n\n”He asked me, very early on, whether I had any interest in ‘Hurricane’ Carter. As it turned out, I knew all about ‘Hurricane’s’ story…again, serendipity is following this whole story…It made it very easy for us to communicate…He said he wanted to write a song about it, he was going to go and visit him. He’d read his book, or at least parts of it…’The Sixteenth Round’…We didn’t do it that night but it was part of the conversation.”\n\nThe front cover of Rubin ‘Hurricane’ Carter’s book\n\nThe story that is told in the song are mostly to be found in the chapter ‘The Fifteenth Round – American Justice Jersey Style’ in Rubin Carter’s book. All the characters are there in the detail of the case – Arthur Dexter Bradley, Alfred Bello, Mrs. Patricia Graham (‘Patti’) Valentine…along with the locations in Paterson, New Jersey.\n\nCarter tells about his names in the book, important to the background and anger felt by and for the main character in the song – a victim of miscarriage of justice:\n\n”Rubin, my Christian name, comes from the Book of Genesis, Chapter 29, verse 32 of the Holy Scriptures…”\n\n”Hurricane is the professional name that I acquired later on in life. It provides an accurate description of the destructive forces that rage within my soul.”\n\n”Carter is the slave name that was given to my forefathers who worked in the cotton fields of Alabama and Georgia, and was passed on to me…”\n\nDylan and Levy quoted on the back of ‘The 16th Round’\n\nThe signature of ‘The Hurricane’\n\nJacques Levy describes the background to the recording of ‘Hurricane’:\n\n“We did a version of ‘Hurricane’ with her (Emmylou Harris), but it didn’t get on the final album because there were some mistakes on it, factual mistakes, and they were picked up – it turned out that I was saying some things in the lyrics that were not quite accurate so they asked us to change them…” Levy re-wrote the relevant parts: “Then the question was what to do about recording it, well, Ronnie Blakely had come into town and Bob went into a studio with her and the band and they re-recorded the song ‘Hurricane’…one take…Boom! and it’s on the album just the way it is.”\n\nThe original studio recording is slower and more laid-back than the version that made it on to the LP. It is absolutely sublime and Emmylou Harris’ backing vocals are beautiful – In some ways a shame that it had to be re-recorded, but, on the other hand, the album version is also fantastic and rages, Dylan spitting out the words in protest. We are fortunate to be have both these gems!\n\nthe ‘Hurricane’ single\n\n’Isis’\n\nLevy talks about how Dylan enjoyed the humour in the lyrics and some of his ‘crazy rhymes’ e.g. rhyming ‘outrageous’ with ‘contagious’ in ‘Isis’…”When he died I was hopin’ that it wasn’t contagious” – surely one of the funniest lines in any Dylan song!\n\nHumour in a tale of a wild-west scenario, searching for treasure, attempted tomb-raiding and maybe even murder?\n\n”I picked up his body and I dragged him inside\n\nThrew him down in the hole and I put back the cover\n\nI said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied\n\nThen I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her”\n\nThe piano-driven story is told brilliantly by Dylan, delivering the fantastical lyrical imagery, a fine vocal with much feeling over the strong beat and backdrop.\n\n‘Mozambique’\n\nClinton Heylin describes ‘Mozambique’ as ‘ghastly’, perhaps a little too unkind. The track provides some light relief in the middle of Side One, following as it does the serious political ‘Hurricane’, historical fictional tale ‘Isis’ and preceding the dark heavy chant of ‘One More Cup Of Coffee’ and slow religious offering of ‘Oh Sister’. The beat nods to calypso, providing a relaxed backdrop for the happiness of the song, Dylan and Levy mischeviously rhyming ‘Mozambique’ with ‘cheek to cheek’ and then ‘week or two’…\n\nThe bridge reveals an image of idyllic love in paradise:\n\n”Lying next to her by the ocean\n\nReaching out and touching her hand\n\nWhispering your secret emotion\n\nMagic in a magical land”\n\n’One More Cup Of Coffee’\n\nPossibly the best track on the album and one of the two written solely by Dylan, the song in the key of A minor is a Hebraic-style chant, Emmylou Harris backing Dylan’s soaring vocals over three beautiful verses and the repeated chorus:\n\n”Your breath is sweet\n\nYour eyes are like two jewels in the sky\n\nYour back is straight, your hair is smooth\n\nOn the pillow where you lie\n\nBut I don’t sense affection\n\nNo gratitude or love\n\nYour loyalty is not to me\n\nBut to the stars above”\n\nLevy recalls: ”… I thought ‘One More Cup Of Coffee’ was just fantastic! I can only recommend you that, some day, if you’re very lucky, that you’ll get a chance to be sitting three feet away from him when he sits and plays it – It’s quite an extraordinary experience. He knew I was in the theatre, so he was really singing it out and it was just wonderful!…and very interesting, dark mysterious song so…the kind of moodiness of the song was terrific and very interesting to me.”\n\n’Oh Sister’\n\nBob Dylan and Emmylou Harris harmonise on this slow, hymn-like offering – religious dogma or spiritual folk-song?\n\n”Oh, Sister, am I not a brother to you\n\nAnd one deserving of affection?\n\nAnd is our purpose not the same on this earth?\n\nTo love and follow\n\nHis direction”\n\nJoseph ‘Crazy Joe’ Gallo\n\n’Joey’\n\nJacques Levy’s choice of subject and not an easy listen, at times a bit dirge-like, but worth persevering…’Joey’ was (as Wikipedia records) “Joseph Gallo (April 7, 1929 – April 7, 1972), also known as “Crazy Joe” and “Joe the Blond”, was a celebrated New York City gangster for the Profaci crime family, later known as the Colombo crime family. Gallo initiated one of the bloodiest mob conflicts since the Castellammarese War of 1930-1931, and was murdered as a result of it.”\n\nAn accordion complements the Italian-American story over the subdued tempo…For all the weight of the song’s subject, Levy and Dylan manage to inject some black humour in the lyrics:\n\n”The police department hounded him\n\nThey called him Mr. Smith\n\nThey got him on conspiracy\n\nThey were never sure who with\n\n”What time is it?” said the judge\n\nTo Joey when they met\n\n”Five to ten,” says Joey\n\nThe judge says, “That’s exactly what you get!”\n\n’Romance In Durango’\n\nHoward Souness, in ‘Down The Highway’, reports that ’Romance In Durango’ was “prompted by a postcard from Mexico showing chili peppers drying on a roof; the words ‘Hot Chili Peppers in the Sun’ written on the front. The subject matter came from Bob’s experiences making ‘Pat Garrett & Billy The Kid’. “It (became) a kind of cowboy story,” says Levy. “A guy on the run and a girl…like an old Western.”\n\nThis song may be set near the city of Durango in southwestern Colorado, close to the border with New Mexico in the United States, or perhaps a fictional destination in a Spanish-speaking desert area. In any case, the latin rhythm and the use of Castellano in some of the recurring lines for the ‘hook’ provides the desired romantic atmosphere:\n\n”No llores, mi querida (Don’t cry, my darling)\n\nDios nos vigila (God watches over us)\n\nSoon the horse will take us to Durango\n\nAgarrame, mi vida (Hold me, my life)\n\nSoon the desert will be gone\n\nSoon we will be dancing the fandango”\n\nOnly Dylan can deliver the feeling of the vocal in these four great evocative lines:\n\n”Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people\n\nHoofbeats like castanets on stone\n\nAt night I dream of bells in the village steeple\n\nThen I see the bloody face of Ramon”\n\n’Black Diamond Bay’\n\nThe playful storytelling by Levy and Dylan, the cast of characters and the length of the song recall ‘Lily, Rosemary and The Jack Of Hearts’ from ‘Blood On The Tracks’. In ‘Down The Highway’, Howard Souness reports that “’Black Diamond Bay’ grew from their love of the stories of Jospeph Conrad. At the end of the song it was revealed that the narrator had been watching the story on the evening news. “There is a certain Brechtian notion about that,” explains Levy, “Instead of being inside the story, as you think you are all along, all of a sudden you step out and look at it as an observer.”\n\nIt is an exotic song, relatively light in its outlook, with a Caribbean feel, invoking some of the imagery of Central America, Conrad novels (as Souness describes above) and perhaps reminiscent of the writings of Hunter S. Thompson, particularly ‘The Rum Diary’.\n\n’Sara’\n\nWritten for his then-wife Sara, Dylan apparently sang this heart-wrenching ballad to her in the studio after a temporary reconciliation, baring his soul – You must have been able to hear a pin drop…Clinton Heylin’s ‘Behind Closed Doors’ quotes Sloman’s description in ‘On The Road With Bob Dylan’:\n\n”Dylan suddenly turned to his wife and said ‘This is for you’. And broke into the compelling song he had written for her that summer in The Hamptons. No one had heard it before, but Stoner and Scarlet and Wyeth picked up the tempo, Scarlet playing some exquisite fills, underlining the melancholy of the lyrics. They ran through it in one take.”\n\nHeylin pours some cold water on this, pointing out that the version of the song used was in fact the fifth take, but it still presents a strong and credible image for Dylan’s raw expression.\n\nThe Empress tarot card features on the back cover, representing, according to the ‘Psychic Revelation’ website, “an archetype of feminine power; she is watery, hard to fathom, mysterious, fertile, and sexual. She augurs a need for us to be in touch with our feminine side, to listen to our intuition, and to give priority to our emotions an passions. She can signify coming abundance.“\n\nWas this Dylan’s beautiful and ‘mystical’ wife Sara?\n\nThe last verse is poignant and oozes with desperate love and beauty:\n\n”Now the beach is deserted\n\nExcept for some kelp\n\nAnd a piece of an old ship\n\nThat lies on the shore\n\nYou always responded\n\nWhen I needed your help\n\nYou gimme a map\n\nAnd a key to your door”\n\n‘Desire’ became the precursor and catalyst for the spontaneous, ramshackle ‘Rolling Thunder’ revue, a tour which involved many musicians, the spirit of romany, mystical music and the re-working of recent songs from ‘Blood On The Tracks’ and ‘Desire’, as well as those from Dylan’s well-stocked back catalogue. The excellent, gutsy, ‘Street Legal’ album was the poet’s next focus for studio recording and thereafter Dylan would go through his infamous ‘born-again’ Christian phase, straddling the end of the 70s and the start of the 80s…\n\n‘Desire’ – tracklisting:\n\nSide One\n\nHurricane\n\nIsis\n\nMozambique\n\nOne More Cup Of Coffee\n\nOh Sister\n\nSide Two\n\nJoey\n\nRomance In Durango\n\nBlack Diamond Bay\n\nSara\n\nReferences and quotes:\n\nBell, Ian (2013). ‘Time Out Of Mind – The Lives Of Bob Dylan’.
