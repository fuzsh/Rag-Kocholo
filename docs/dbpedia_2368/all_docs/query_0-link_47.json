        "text": "Harmony singing runs deep in American folk culture, primarily as something to do but also as something to listen to, to be moved by.\n\nAnd within the realm of commercial American popular music, no singers have been more deeply devoted to the practice, privately and publicly, than Dolly Parton, Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt. Now, at long last, they have formalized their mutual affection (both personal and musical) and released a record of country-and-western trios entitled ''Trio'' (Warner Bros. 25491, all three formats). It's a connoisseur's delight, and with luck, it should be a huge popular success as well.\n\nThis record is actually a second effort, and a good deal has happened to these women's individual careers and to the course of country music in between attempts.\n\nWhen they started out separately in the late 1960's, Ms. Parton was a pure, Nashville-based country songwriter and singer, with a gift she still retains for delicate ornamentation of the vocal line. Ms. Harris sang country-folk in the Washington area and later in Los Angeles. And Ms. Ronstadt, who hails from Tucson, helped pioneer Los Angeles country-rock along with the Byrds, Buffalo Springfield and the Eagles (who emerged from one of her backup bands).\n\nAs they pursued their solo careers, they also served happily as backup singers for other artists or employed younger singers, usually women, to work with them. In particular, they sang on one another's records and made music together privately for the pure pleasure of it.\n\nAs a recorded trio, Ms. Ronstadt and Ms. Parton appeared along with Neil Young behind Ms. Harris in a Christmas song ''Light of the Stable'' in 1975. Three years later, the three women finally got together in Los Angeles to record a trio album.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
