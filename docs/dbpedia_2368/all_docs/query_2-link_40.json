        "text": "Actress – LXXXVIII CD/2xLP+MP3/3xLP+MP3 (Ninja Tune)\n\nWorking with elements of techno, electro, R&B and concrète, electronic luminary Darren Cunningham aka Actress has patented a sound that’s instantly recognizable, impossible to emulate and responsible for some of the most beloved electronic albums of recent times. Many have placed on numerous publications' end-of-year lists including Pitchfork's \"100 Best Albums of the Decade So Far\", The Guardian, Bandcamp, Bleep, FACT, Resident Advisor, Vinyl Factory, Dummy, The Wire and more as well as charting in the UK, US and Europe. LXXXVIII incorporates the game of chess both thematically and artistically, as seen in the track titles corresponding to moves on a chess board and with Actress noting that “different tracks elicited different responses & determined the move they proposed back to me.” “Brings a deeply twisted nostalgia to the techno and house of decades past” - The New York Times. “Conveying an elegance and beauty that only Actress can\" - DJ Mag. A deluxe clear triple vinyl pressing and a limited-edition blue double vinyl pressing are available.]\n\nbar italia – The Twits CD/LP (Matador)\n\nThe Twits finds bar italia’s economical yet evocative songcraft taking raucous, mystic, unkempt, occasionally sinister, and wholly committed turns. Songs like “my little tony”, with its in-the-red riff and excitable hooks, the cathartic four-on-the-floor of ‘world’s greatest emoter’ and the festival tent psychedelia of “Hi-fiver” need little in the way of exposition – these are exhilarating rock songs, if wayward and strange.\n\nThe Beatles – Now And Then 7”/12” LP (Capitol)\n\nThe Beatles' double-A-side single for \"Now And Then\" and \"Love Me Do\" pairs the last Beatles song with the band's first UK single. Powerful musical bookends to The Beatles' recorded canon, both songs are also featured in the expanded 2023 Editions for 1962-1966 (The Red Album) and 1967-1970 (The Blue Album). \"Now And Then\" is the last Beatles song, written and demoed by John Lennon in the mid/late ‘70s. With John's voice now pristine in the mix, \"Now And Then\" features elements from the 1995 sessions including George Harrison's guitar parts, and vocal and instrumental parts recorded by Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr in 2022, along with a new arrangement for strings. Produced by Paul and Giles Martin, \"Now And Then\" is the last song recorded by all four Beatles, a powerful and fitting finale for the band's timeless recordings. The song that started it all, \"Love Me Do\" was The Beatles' first UK single in 1962. For the first time, the iconic song has been de-mixed using machine aided learning and remixed in true stereo. [Multiple colorways of the 7” version are available (clear and light blue, respectively) including an indie store exclusive blue & white marbled pressing. [Universal holds onto their status as worst major label distributor by not getting us our Beatles singles for today. They should be here next week. If you preordered with us, thank you for your patience. We have the 12” if you want that one.]\n\nBlues Traveler – Traveler’s Soul 2xLP (Roundhill)\n\nRecently released on CD – now available on indie store exclusive vinyl. Grammy Award-winning band Blues Traveler is back with their 15th full-length album, Traveler's Soul. This album, like 2021's Traveler's Blues - a blues covers album that earned the band a Grammy nomination - is a covers album paying tribute to R&B and soul classics with featured artists such as Pat Monahan from Train, Valerie June, Alisan Porter, Daisha McBride, and many more. First single \"Fool Ffor You,\" originally popularized by Curtis Mayfield's The Impressions back in 1968, has a wailing harmonica that gives way to an understated guitar riff and a heavenly piano melody. This ebb-and-flow underlines a smoldering vocal performance from John Popper backed by a rapturous choir.\n\nJimmy Buffett – Equal Strain On All Parts CD/LP (Sun)\n\nSinger-songwriter Jimmy Buffett regaled audiences for over five decades with songs about the faces and places from his lifelong journey along the road less traveled. Equal Strain On All Parts is the last chapter; a playful and heartfelt gift to his dedicated fans. Inspired by his grandfather’s description of a good nap (oh, the irony), Buffet’s final album features some well-known friends, including Paul McCartney, Emmylou Harris, Angelique Kidjo, and the Preservation Hall Jazz Band. The single “Bubbles Up” was written by our pal Will Kimbrough! Woo hoo! [Two limited-edition color vinyl pressings are available: ‘electric blue’ and indie store exclusive swirl blue in a gatefold sleeve w/ poster.]\n\nCurrent Joys – Love + Pop CD/LP/Cassette (Secretly Candadian)\n\nLove + Pop is a snapshot of a moment in not-so-far-away time; something fast, loud, moody and a little dangerous. It is, in some ways, classic Current Joys: full of wild ambition, sneaky hooks, and songs that move from concept to completion with prolific speed. But Love + Pop also explodes myriad expectations with aggressive, deconstructed production, house music influence, and a guest appearance from Lil Yachty. It is not so much a twist as it is a unique multiverse identity for Current Joys, as Nick Rattigan's set out to \"capture this sonic moment and harken back to the way I first released music.\" [Limited-edition neon green vinyl.]\n\nMicky Dolenz - Dolenz sings R.E.M. EP LP (7A Records)\n\nYep you read that right. The last remaining Monkee with the ageless voice tackles 4 classic R.E.M. songs and delights. The members of R.E.M. wholeheartedly endorse this endeavor in case you were wondering. Michael Stipe: “This is the pinnacle of WOW for me. I love the Monkees and I love Micky Dolenz.”\n\nWilliam Eggleston – 512 CD/LP (Secretly Canadian)\n\nWilliam Eggleston is a famed photographer and musician credited for iconic album covers such as Spoon's Transference and Jimmy Eat World's Bleed American. 512 was inspired and recorded at the Parkview Apartments in Memphis, Tennessee where Eggleston lived for almost ten years. The apartment was full of art and inspiration: cameras, naturally, but also high-end stereo tube amplifiers and objects that you'd rush towards money in hand at your local flea market. But also, a gigantic nine-foot Bosendorfer grand piano and a massive grand vintage JBL theater speaker console. His home was overwhelmed by music. [Limited-edition clear vinyl.]\n\nFuming Mouth – Last Day Of Sun CD/LP (Nuclear Blast)\n\nA fiery, resurrected rage barrels its way out of hell's erupting chasms with blistering fury; Fuming Mouth has returned. Lead singer, guitarist, and founder Mark Whelan emerges triumphant after a life-threatening battle with Acute Myeloid Leukemia, rekindling the inferno of their music with Fuming Mouth's second full-length album, Last Day Of Sun. [Limited-edition smoke color vinyl.]\n\nJim Gaffigan – Dark Pale CD/2xLP (Comedy Dynamics)\n\nNew release from the acclaimed stand-up comedian.\n\nHiromi – Silver Lining Suite 2xLP (Telarc)\n\nHiromi's latest album, Silver Lining Suite, pairs her virtuosic and emotive piano with a string quartet assembled by violinist Tatsuo Nishie, concertmaster of the New Japan Philharmonic. Devised for a series of livestream concerts at the Blue Note Tokyo during the COVID-19 pandemic, the results blur the lines between classical music and jazz, crafting a vibrant hybrid possessed of the fervent, rock-inspired energy and cinematic beauty that Hiromi has always instilled in her music.\n\nHotline TNT – Cartwheel CD/LP (Third Man)\n\nWill Anderson believes in true love—as both concept and catalyst, aspiration and inspiration. During his 34 years, the Hotline TNT founder and architect has found such love perhaps half-a-dozen times. Each instance has prompted some enormous swing of commitment, like a cross-country move or simply being honest about his budding attraction. It is a hopeful and vulnerable way to exist, a way to ensure maximum bruising during the fall of the breakup. And so far for Anderson, that is how it has always ended, whether the air has slowly seeped out of some once-full balloon or whether it has simply popped, those expanded feelings expelled in an instant. This tension is the brain, blood, and beating heart of Cartwheel, Hotline TNT’s second LP and an endlessly romantic testament to reaching for something that slips forever out of grasp. The byproduct of Anderson’s decades-long quest to pin down the surging sound long in his head, Hotline TNT has come to notice in the last four years through loose association with a feverish surge of shoegaze revivalism. [Indie store exclusive clear w/ yellow splatter vinyl.]\n\nIan Sweet – Sucker CD/LP+MP3 (Polyvinyl)\n\nOn Ian Sweet's new full-length album, Sucker, creative mastermind Jilian Medford delivers the strongest and most personal batch of songs she's ever written - brimming with despair, vulnerability, and remorse. \"I'm a sucker for the pain and the heartbreak,\" she sings on standout \"Sucker,\" which features woozy synth lines and droney guitar work that touches on themes of uncertainty. Recorded at The Outlier Inn, nestled in New York state's southern Catskill mountains, and mixed by Al Carlson (St. Vincent, Weyes Blood, Jessica Pratt), the album showcases Medford's ability to craft beautiful pop songs that tug at your heartstrings while at the same time, busting wide open with layers of lush synths and overblown guitars. [Limited-edition red vinyl.]\n\nill peach – THIS IS NOT AN EXIT CD/LP (Hardly Art)\n\nill peach’s “weirdo stuff” comes to fruition on first full-length THIS IS NOT AN EXIT: a collection of anthemic songs built out of bright pop and gritty experimental elements (Morrissey names the sculptural use of distortion on the final albums by Low as an inspiration), punctuated with hooky choruses ready to be screamed along to in the safety of your own bedroom or with a bunch of friends at one of ill peach’s intense live shows. If ill peach first blossomed in New York, it took quarantine in Los Angeles for the project to ripen. The end of the world turned out to be what ill peach needed to get real with themselves. “It helped us creatively to zone in and removed us from the [industry] side of things to where we could just be like this is our new identity, let's jump with both feet.” Ultimately, THIS IS NOT AN EXIT is a record about healing, a process often spoken about in New Age-y terms but one that in reality can be confusing and, yes, weird. But it is the beautiful strangeness of being alive that ill peach capture so well [Limited-edition neon orange vinyl.]\n\nIn The Pines – Painting By Numbers LP (Soul Step)\n\nTranslucent orange vinyl. In the Pines, for fans of Ty Segall, King Tuff, and King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard. In The Pines’ biggest strength is musically how they keep you on your toes. In the Pines continues to evolve with every record showcasing the depth in talent that this band has.\n\nInsomnium – Songs Of The Dusk CDEP (Century Media)\n\nMusic, essentially, is a weapon to destroy the walls we built around us - and Finnish metal melancholists Insomnium are amongst its strongest wielders. Their ninth masterpiece, Anno 1696, released in early 2023 led us deep into the dark and troublesome past of Northern Europe, a time of witches, of superstition, of bloodlust and frenzy. And of werewolves. In November, Insomnium continue the epic story of Anno 1696 on their addendum-like EP Songs Of The Dusk, featuring 22 minutes of music and three more journeys into a dark and foggy past. [Vinyl due 11/10.]\n\nJockstrap & Taylor Skye – I<3UQTINVU LP (Rough Trade)\n\nLondon-based duo Jockstrap release I<3UQTINVU, a fully remixed version of their Mercury Prize shortlisted 2022 album I Love You Jennifer B by the band’s Taylor Skye. I<3UQTINVU is the brainchild of Skye, who was making multiple versions of the album’s original tracklisting to stay inspired during the writing of I Love You Jennifer B. The guest features on the remix record range from Ersatz, who inspired Skye to make music many years ago to Ian Starr who he only connected with online a few months ago. [Indie store exclusive red vinyl.]\n\nRoe Kapara – I Hope Hell Isn’t Real LP (Epitaph)\n\nUltra clear w/ opaque orange and green heavy splatter vinyl. Just as Roe Kapara is willing to expose vulnerable parts of himself in his songs, he's quick to shine the mirror outward to address the creeping dread of modern life: consumerism, corporate greed, climate change, the general feelings of the younger generation in 21st-century America. Combining these two sides of his musical personality - deeply relatable yet unafraid to stand up and ask life's big questions - into pop songs makes for a musical journey that's a little off-kilter, sure, but all the better and more interesting in the end.\n\nKevin Abstract – Blanket CD (RCA)\n\nKevin Abstract was formerly part of the Brockhampton collective. Blanket is the artist’s third full-length, following his 2016 debut, American Boyfriend: A Suburban Love Story, and 2019’s Arizona Baby. Compared to his sound in past musical projects, Blanket sees Abstract embrace his rock influences. For the album, he worked closely with fellow Brockhampton producer Romil Hemnani, as well as instrumentalist Jonah Abraham. “I wanted to make, like, a Sunny Day Real Estate, Nirvana, Modest Mouse type of record,” he said “But I wanted it to hit like a rap album.”\n\nMaeta – When I Hear Your Name 2xLP (Roc Nation)\n\nRed vinyl. When I Hear Your Name features songs written by SZA, Kehlani, Ty Dolla $ign, Demi Lovato and Lucky Daye with production by KAYTRANADA. VIBE calls Maeta \"The Rising Phenom.\" New Wave says she’s “R&B’s latest powerhouse\" and Rolling Stone included “Sexual Love” on their ‘Songs You Need To Know.’\n\nTkay Maidza – Sweet Justice CD/LP (4AD)\n\nTkay Maidza, the first female rapper signed to 4AD, releases her highly anticipated new album, Sweet Justice. The follow-up to her 2016 self-titled debut, includes the recent Flume-produced earth-shuddering single “Silent Assassin”. “I’m never choosing compliance,” a defiant Maidza utters on “Ring-A-Ling”; a warning from the Zimbabwean-born, Australian-raised, Los Angeles-based rapper, singer and producer and a mantra for Sweet Justice. Produced by Two Fresh, Tkay says of “Ring-A-Ling”, “I wanted to make an empowering song that tells others that my biggest focus are my goals.” The result of a dark night of the soul - and ensuing epiphany - that led to a series of professional and personal reckonings, Sweet Justice isn’t a revenge album, but it does stem from a profound sense of karma. In a traditional sense, it’s a breakup record: about Tkay splitting off from her self-doubt and warped sense of self; the toxic figures that populated the last chapter of her life; and the idea that she should stick to any one lane.\n\nMathame – Memo 2xLP (Astralwerks)\n\nSilver vinyl. Memo takes listeners on a journey into the last three years of the Mathame experience, serving as a log of the duo’s memories and emotions since the album’s inception. Through the combination of Mathame’s emotive soundscapes and atmospheric Audio Visual (AV) show, the duo craft ecstatic moments and trancelike experiences on the dancefloor, expressing their own relatable life encounters and consequently evoking personal reminiscence in their audience.\n\nSen Morimoto – Diagnosis CD/LP (City Slang/Sooper)\n\nChicago-based multi-instrumentalist Sen Morimoto’s third album Diagnosis sees him flip the script. After releasing two albums – 2018 debut Cannonball! and a 2021 self-titled follow-up – via his own Sooper Records, the artist signed to City Slang to co-release his third album alongside Sooper, and it came at a time of fundamental change. With mental health discourse and artists’ trauma teetering between serving as positive forms of expression and becoming dangerous, exploitative selling points, the true and just recipient of your ire should be the systems themselves. Through writing introspectively on past albums, Morimoto set the groundwork to write Diagnosis from a different perspective. A chameleonic figure at the album’s core, he can rip out a sax solo, dive deep into intimate singer-songwriter territory and lead massive, roaring alt-pop songs with equal aplomb. Morimoto describes his musical reference points for the album as “equal parts Funkadelic and Dinosaur Jr.” [A limited-edition neon yellow vinyl pressing is available for special order.]\n\nMegan Moroney – Lucky 2xLP (Columbia)\n\nReleased in May on CD – now available on translucent green vinyl. Lucky is the debut album from rising Nashville star, Megan Moroney. The album landed on Rolling Stone’s “The Best Albums of 2023 So Far” list, shot to the Top 10 on Billboard's Top Country Albums chart, and drew raves from the likes of HITS, who stated that “Not since Taylor Swift has a young woman told the truth so cleverly and completely.” Now available on vinyl, this deluxe version of Lucky features three additional tracks with guest appearances by Kameron Marlowe & Mackenzie an etched D-side.\n\nVan Morrison – Accentuate The Positive 2xLP (Virgin)\n\nVan Morrison unveils his 45th studio album, Accentuate The Positive. This electrifying homage to rock 'n' roll is launched alongside its first single, a new take on the Johnny Kidd classic “Shakin' All Over”. Like this year's acclaimed Moving On Skiffle, Accentuate The Positive sees Van Morrison returning to one of his childhood passions: this time rock 'n' roll. Growing up in Belfast shortly after World War II, he was immensely inspired by the heady sounds of 20th century blues and rock 'n' roll. Listening to artists such as Fats Domino, Chuck Berry and The Everly Brothers, it wasn't long until Van was intuitively reinterpreting these sounds with his own band in local hometown venues. Several decades later, Van Morrison now revisits the genre by reimagining some of his personal favorites and infusing those timeless songs with an energy that constantly challenges and expands upon its traditions. [Indie store exclusive blue vinyl.]\n\nOff World – 3 LP (Constellation)\n\nOff World presents the final album in its trilogy of surreal and spacious leftfield electronics. \"A stellar project headed by Sandro Perri, one of the most singular producers in contemporary music\" (Boomkat), this third volume is another distinctive collection of tracks constructed from semi-improvised ensemble recordings made over the past decade with a varied cast of co-conspirators. Drew Brown, Matthew Cooper, Susumu Mukai and Andrew Zukerman join Perri again on a variety of synths and machines, along with violinist Jesse Zubot (Tanya Tagaq, Fond Of Tigers). Perri also continues to add organ and piano to the mix, while 3 notably features first-time Off World contributors Nicole Rampersaud on trumpet and Martin Arnold on guitar, both mainstays of Toronto’s vibrant improv and out-music scenes.\n\nPecos & The Rooftops – Pecos & The Rooftops LP (WB)\n\nRecently released on CD – now available on vinyl. Pecos & The Rooftops kick off a new sonic era with a self-titled major-label debut album, marking their heaviest hitter to date. Produced by Andrew Bayliss (Jelly Roll, Austin Snell) and recorded at The Boneyard Studios, it's a fatter, bolder evolution of their sound - higher voltage and making full use of world-class resources. The band's debut lights a fresh fuse, as Pecos and the band stadium-size their rock prowess, with glacially thick distortion and overdriven solos leading afterburner anthems and grungy ballads alike. All throughout, the shadowy depth of Pecos' diesel-powered vocal roars on, battling inner demons and drowning toxic sorrows in equal measure.\n\nCaroline Polachek – Desire, I Want To Turn Into You CD/LP/Cassette (Caroline Polachek, LLC)\n\nDesire, I Want To Turn Into You is the fourth studio album by singer-songwriter and producer Caroline Polachek, and second under her given name. It's been over 1,143 days since Caroline Polachek's breakout solo album Pang was released. A word-of-mouth classic, cemented by star-making live turns... to say we've been eager for its sequel is something of an understatement. Desire, I Want To Turn Into You contains incendiary new single “Welcome To My Island”. The world has caught up with the hyper-pop maximalism since Pang and is forever changed. 2023 already belongs to Caroline Polachek. [Two color vinyl pressings are available – an indie store exclusive ‘tiger’s eye’ version and limited-edition copper.]\n\nSaul – This Is It… The End Of Everything 2xLP (Spinefarm)\n\nRecently released on CD – now available on clear vinyl. The Iowa hard rock quartet continues to bring audiences together with a one-two punch of pummeling metallic grooves and towering melodies.\n\nSemisonic – Little Bit Of Sun CD/LP (Pleasuresonic)\n\nLittle Bit Of Sun is the fourth full-length studio album by Semisonic and the band's first full-length album in 22 years. Includes \"Grow Your Own\", \"The Rope\", and \"Out Of The Dirt\".\n\nSkyzoo – All The Brilliant Things LP (Mello Music)\n\nFeaturing BJ The Chicago Kid, Raheem Devaughn, Karriem Riggins, & Al Skratch, Skyzoo's latest album All The Brilliant Things is a masterful work of art that showcases the Brooklyn rapper's lyrical prowess and storytelling ability. The album is a 14-track journey that delves into Skyzoo's personal life experiences, reflecting on his upbringing, love life, and the everyday struggles faced by Black people in America. All The Brilliant Things is a testament to Skyzoo's growth as an artist and his ability to create timeless music that resonates with listeners. His lyrics are poignant and thought-provoking, tackling themes of love, loss, and perseverance. [Limited-edition pink ‘pastel skies’ vinyl.]\n\nSmashing Times – This Sporting Life LP (Kscope)\n\nWhen you call your band Smashing Times you can't help instantly getting the flavor of the Television Personalties and Dan Treacy but on their second album, the band deliver that and so much more. This really is a fusion of psychedelic, twee and freakbeat that will make your heart skip and your head smile. The guitars shimmer, strum, and jangle whilst the vocals float effortlessly on top of the efficient rhythm section. Every song is a bundle of energy with hooks that come both instantly and after multiple plays.\n\nSpiritual Cramp – Spiritual Cramp LP (Blue Grape Music)\n\nSan Francisco punks Spiritual Cramp release their long-awaited self-titled debut LP. Produced by Michael Bingham and Michael Fenton of the band, the album includes additional production from Carlos de la Garza (Paramore, M83, The Linda Linda's, Cherry Glazerr, etc.), who also mixed the album. [Indie store exclusive red/white vinyl.]\n\nMarnie Stern – The Comeback Kid LP(Joyful Noise)\n\nVisionary guitarist Marnie Stern bursts in like a shower of stardust on The Comeback Kid. \"This record is about reassuring yourself that happiness is not about what kind of things you have or how many things you have or what you don't have-it's about all the good things you do.\"\n\nThe Struts – Pretty Vicious CD/LP (Big Machine)\n\nThe Struts erupted onto the music scene with their behemoth anthem, \"Could've Been Me\", introducing the world to their timeless rock sound. With their acclaimed debut Everybody Wants, the British rockers cemented their reputation as a must-see act bringing their energetic tracks alive on stage with larger-than-life performances. Their new album, Pretty Vicious, embodies that raw, raucous nature of their live shows, fusing their arena-size energy into their most honest and exciting songs to date. [Limited-edition violet vinyl.]\n\nLol Tolhurst x Budgie x Jacknife Lee – Los Angeles LP (PIAS)\n\nThe three-way Los Angeles collaboration was born out of a curiosity which just wouldn't die. Made up of two of the most illustrious and inventive drummers of the post-punk era, The Cure's Lol Tolhurst, and Budgie from Siouxsie & The Banshees and The Creatures, along with stellar producer and multi-instrumentalist Garret 'Jacknife' Lee, this unlikely alt-supergroup have spent the last four years spiriting up one of the most extraordinary albums to appear in 2023. Perusing the tracklist, with its guest credits for, amongst others, LCD Soundsystem's James Murphy, Bobby Gillespie, Civil Rights avant-gardist Lonnie Holley, Starcrawler wildchild Arrow de Wilde and The Edge from U2, you may rightly wonder just what the 13-track long-player holds in store.\n\nEmily Wolfe – The Blowback LP (Crows Feet)\n\nThis 10-track album is entirely produced by Emily herself, adding an even more personal element to the record. \"Producing The Blowback is one of the most thrilling experiences I've ever had; I'd learned so much from past producers like Michael Shuman (Queens Of The Stone Age), and I was ready. For me, this whole chapter is about owning your spirit.\" Inspired by Hole, Veruca Salt, Nirvana, and Alanis Morissette, Wolfe envisaged a specific sound for what would become The Blowback, opting to self-produce the new album to realize it fully.\n\nJaime Wyatt – Feel Good CD/LP (New West)\n\n“I’m still learning how to experience joy, how to be free, how to be comfortable in my own skin,” says Jaime Wyatt. “A lot of us grow up feeling like we must hide who we are just to be accepted, but that comes from a place of fear and judgment. I wrote these songs as a way of letting go of all that, as permission to feel good.” Feel Good, Wyatt’s extraordinary new album, is more than just a permission slip, though: it’s an invitation. Recorded with Black Pumas’ Adrian Quesada, the record is bold and ecstatic, built on tight, intoxicating grooves that belie the songs’ substantial emotional stakes. Wyatt’s writing is raw and intuitive here, tapping into the deep recesses of her subconscious as she reckons with grief and growth, and her delivery is visceral to match, cutting straight to the bone with equal parts sensitivity and swagger. Taken as a whole, the collection stands as a radical act of creative liberation from an artist already known for pushing limits, a genre-defying work of healing and self-love that tips its cap to everything from Al Green and Otis Redding to Waylon Jennings and Bobbie Gentry in its relentless pursuit of peace and pleasure. [Indie store exclusive bubblegum pink vinyl.]\n\nYouth Fountain – Together In Lonesome CD/LP (Pure Noise)\n\nSince forming Youth Fountain in 2017, the Vancouver BC-based Tyler Zanon has been a prolific writer, ascending on the shoulders of a cutting, introspective sound Kerrang hailed as “so raw and young that one can't help but wonder if [Youth Fountain] were peers of Taking Back Sunday and Saves The Day back in the early 2000s.” As he revisited lyric notebooks and hard drives from Youth Fountain early days and previous bands, Zanon amassed a collection of demos he brought to producer Anton DeLost (State Champs, Mayday Parade). Together, the pair worked to transform them into Together In Lonesome standouts – like the skate-punk pit-starting “Clarity”, angular “A Few Notes For Orpheus”, and skyscraping “Twin Flame” – while crafting songs like “Identical Days” and first single “Fallen Short”, the anthemic encapsulation of Youth Fountain’s unbridled, nostalgic blend of emo, pop-punk, and alternative rock, from the ground up. [Indie store exclusive swamp green vinyl.]\n\nThe Allman Brothers Band – Bear’s Sonic Journals: Fillmore East, February 1970 2xLP (Allman Brothers Band)\n\nDouble orange color vinyl pressing in gatefold jacket. Fillmore East, February 1970 is a live album by the rock group The Allman Brothers Band. It was recorded by Owsley Stanley at the Fillmore East in Manhattan on February 11, 13, and 14, 1970.\n\nBelle & Sebastian – The Boy With The Arab Strap [Reissue/1998] LP (Matator)\n\nBelle & Sebastian's beloved third album The Boy With The Arab Strap returns on limited blue vinyl and blue tint cover this autumn to celebrate the LPs 25th anniversary.\n\nBlack Rebel Motorcycle Club – Live At Levitation LP (Reverberation Appreciation Society)\n\nLimited gold nugget color vinyl pressing. The first Austin Psych Fest was held in March 2008, and expanded to the three-day Levitation event the following year. The event quickly developed into an international destination for psychedelic rock fans, with lineups spanning the fringes of indie rock, from up-and-comers to vintage legends, and capped off with headline performances from co-founders The Black Angels, along with Tame Impala, The Flaming Lips, The Brian Jonestown Massacre, Thee Oh Sees (in various forms) and many more.\n\nCharles M. Bogert – Sounds Of North American Frogs [Reissue/1958] LP (Smithsonian Folkways)\n\nThis classic of both biological fieldwork and natural sound recordings, compiled and narrated by renowned herpetologist Charles M. Bogert, was originally released by Folkways in 1958, and presents sounds of 57 species of frogs and toads (remastered from the original tapes) that were recorded in swamps, lakes, woods, creeks, and roadside ditches all over North America. Listen to the bewitching tones of the Pig Frog, Dwarf Mexican Treefrog, Little Green Toad, Southwestern Woodhouse's Toad, Great Basin Spadefoot, and other unsung heroes of the bog creek.

Did you know there are horses on the cover of Earth 2: Special Low Frequency Version? There are at least three in the right-hand corner, gathered inexplicably near a white canvas tent, a human possibly perched among its folds. As widescreen and vast as the cover may seem, those little details-the horses, the possible human, the faint wisp of white clouds-give it depth and wonder, something to which the imagination can return. Did you know that the music on Earth 2 - repressed now for its 30th anniversary, back in its original artwork, and accompanied by a riveting set of remixes that demonstrate the reach of what Dylan Carlson long ago called \"ambient metal\"-works much the same way? The surface is massive and obvious, the meatpaw riffs of Carlson and bassist Dave Harwell pounding and swiping and pawing at the speakers, a true bludgeon in three-dimensional sound. Listen, though, for the details in the corners, for the finesse beneath the force, and Earth 2 reveals new levels of depth and wonder.\n\nExplosions In The Sky – Those Who Tell The Truth Shall Die, Those Who Tell The Truth Shall Live Forever [Reissue/2001] LP (Temporary Residence)\n\nExplosions In The Sky – The Earth Is Not A Cold Dead Place [Reissue/2003] 2xLP (Temporary Residence)\n\nTwo new vinyl colors: purple and red (respectively).

This new sense of hope is the defining characteristic of this record, and ultimately the journey that their music takes us on. Immeasurably more dramatic and dynamic than their last album, The Earth Is Not A Cold Dead Place takes its shape not in the unexpected cacophony that had become the band's trademark, but in the infinitely deeper caverns of the human soul.\n\nNeal Francis – Francis Comes Alive 2xLP (ATO)\n\nRoyal grape color vinyl.

In the history of their expansive discography, Lucero has evolved and embraced everything from southern rock to Stax-inspired Memphis soul, whilst simultaneously maintaining their distinctive sonic foundations.

A student of Karlheinz Stockhausen, Krzysztof Penderecki and Gottfried Michael Koenig, McGuire moved to Cologne, Germany in 1970, where he become associated with the world-leading Studio for Electronic Music at Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR) in Cologne. Like Stockhausen, McGuire found his musical imagination both constrained and inspired by the technology that was available to him. Whereas the \"Pulse Music\" pieces had employed steady streams of pulses, with Vanishing Points McGuire employed pulse layers that accelerate or decelerate against one another, vastly increasing the resulting rhythmic complexity. McGuire's exploration of music technology continued in A Cappella (1990-1997), written for his wife, the soprano Beth Griffith, known for her recording of Morton Feldman's Three Voices made in 1983.
