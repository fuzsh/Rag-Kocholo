        "text": "Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt, and Emmylou Harris have three careers unparalleled in music history. Together they have sold over 200 million albums worldwide and performed for decades in front of countless fans around the globe. It’s no surprise that when their three voices united to release their debut collaboration, the results were remarkable. The threesome released two albums together, Trio (1987) and Trio II(1999), which have combined to sell more than five million copies worldwide and win three Grammy® Awards.\n\nBoth of these classic albums have been newly remastered for a three-CD collection packed with rare and unreleased music. Produced by Harris, THE COMPLETE TRIO COLLECTION will be available on September 9 for a list price of $29.98.\n\nOn the same date, a single-disc set will also be available entitled MY DEAR COMPANION: SELECTIONS FROM THE TRIO COLLECTION, featuring a mix of songs taken from the three-disc set, as will FARTHER ALONG, a double-LP set of all the bonus material from THE COMPLETE TRIO COLLECTION. Trio II will also be released on vinyl for the first time.\n\nEven though Parton, Ronstadt, and Harris began recording together in the 1970s, a full album proved elusive. When the stars aligned and the friends were finally able to record a full album, a powerhouse sound of country and Americana was born. The results were remarkable. Trio arrived in 1987; sold more than four million copies; won two Grammy Awards; and topped the country album chart for five consecutive weeks. Among the standout tracks are “To Know Him Is to Love Him,” “Wildflowers,” and “Farther Along.”\n\nIt would be more than a decade before the group released a follow-up, but when Trio II arrived in 1999 it did not disappoint. The album won a Grammy Award and peaked in the Top Five of the country album chart. It sold more than one million copies worldwide on the strength of tracks like “Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?” the Carter family’s “Lover’s Return” and a cover of Neil Young’s “After The Gold Rush.”\n\nThe bonus disc is loaded with 20 songs, including alternate takes of album tracks like “I’ve Had Enough,” “Making Plans” and “My Dear Companion.” Also featured are 11 completely unreleased recordings from the trio spanning both album sessions including “Waltz Across Texas Tonight,” “Pleasant As May,” “Are You Tired of Me,” and the gospel standard “Softly And Tenderly.” Among the unreleased material is also an alternate version of “Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?” featuring Parton on lead vocals and a stunning acapella version of “Calling All My Children Home.”\n\nTHE COMPLETE TRIO COLLECTION\n\nTrack Listing\n\nDisc One – Trio I\n\n“The Pain of Loving You”\n\n“Making Plans”\n\n“To Know Him Is To Love Him”\n\n“Hobo’s Meditation”\n\n“Wildflowers”\n\n“Telling Me Lies”\n\n“My Dear Companion”\n\n“Those Memories of You”\n\n“I’ve Had Enough”\n\n“Rosewood Casket”\n\n“Farther Along”\n\nDisc Two – Trio II\n\n“Lover’s Return”\n\n“High Sierra”\n\n“Do I Ever Cross Your Mind”\n\n“After the Gold Rush”\n\n“The Blue Train”\n\n“I Feel the Blues Movin’ In”\n\n“You’ll Never Be The Sun”\n\n“He Rode All The Way To Texas”\n\n“Feels Like Home”\n\n“When We’re Gone, Long Gone”\n\nDisc Three – Bonus Material\n\n“Wildflowers” (Alternate Take unreleased 1986)\n\n“Waltz Across Texas Tonight” (Unreleased 1994)\n\n“Lover’s Return” (Alternate Mix – Unreleased)\n\n“Softly and Tenderly” (Unreleased 1994)\n\n“Pleasant As May” (Unreleased 1986)\n\n“My Dear Companion” (Alternate Take 1986)\n\n“My Blue Tears” (Unreleased 1998)\n\n“Making Plans” (Alternate Take 1986)\n\n“I’ve Had Enough” (Alternate Mix 1986)\n\n“Grey Funnel Line” (Unreleased 1986)\n\n“You Don’t Knock” (Unreleased 1986)\n\n“Where Will The Words Come From” (Unreleased 1985)\n\n“Do I Ever Cross Your Mind” (Dolly Lead – Alternate Take 1994)\n\n“Are You Tired of Me” (Unreleased 1986)\n\n“Even Cowgirls Get The Blues”\n\n“Mr. Sandman”\n\n“Handful Of Dust” (Unreleased 1993)\n\n“Calling My Children Home” (Unreleased Acapella Version 1986)\n\n“White Snow” (Unreleased 1986)\n\n“Farther Along” (Alternate Mix 1986)\n\nMY DEAR COMPANION: SELECTIONS FROM THE TRIO COLLECTION\n\nTrack Listing\n\n“The Pain Of Loving You”\n\n“My Dear Companion”\n\n“To Know Him Is To Love Him”\n\n“Telling Me Lies”\n\n“Farther Along”\n\n“ Lover’s Return”\n\n“After The Gold Rush”\n\n“The Blue Train”\n\n“You’ll Never Be The Sun”\n\n“When We’re Gone, Long Gone”\n\n“Waltz Across Texas Tonight” (Unreleased 1994)\n\n“Do I Ever Cross Your Mind” (Dolly Lead – Alternate Take 1994)\n\n“Wildflowers” (Alternate Take 1986)\n\n“Calling My Children Home” (Unreleased Acapella Version 1986)\n\nLOS ANGELES, CA (March 14, 2016) – websterpr"
