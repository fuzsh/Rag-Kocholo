        "text": "View Author\n\n1\n\nIt's hard to understand how Car Wheels On A Gravel Road could be recommended at all, let alone make it onto a list like 1001 albums. The music is generic modern country, not distinguished by creative songwriting, kickass soloists, or anything else, unless you count the Cajun lilt on a few tunes. Maybe the blandness of the music is meant to highlight the stellar pipes of Lucina Williams? Nope. Her voice is as homely and dull as dishwater. But surely the lyrics are superior? Well, not really. Lucina Williams frontloads her best tunes; the first several songs demonstrate a keen grasp of quotidian life and a sure sense of place, but by the end of the album, the lyrics are so generic they could have been written by a computer program. The best compliment I can give Car Wheels On A Gravel Road is that it isn't actively unpleasant--just boring. Is this the best modern country has to offer? I sure hope not.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n2\n\n“Car Wheels on a Gravel Road” by Lucinda Williams (2006) Never heard of this album or this artist. I took a different approach with this one: I read the Wikipedia article on the album and the one on Lucinda Williams, plus I checked out the lyrics, all before starting to listen. I was expecting something nice. I was disappointed. In the first couple of songs, the vocal quality is worse than not good—it’s uninteresting. Later in the album she does some vocal stylings in the upper parts of her range which are good, which reveals that her usual lazy, out-of-tune style is affected, not natural. It’s off putting to me. It lacks authenticity. Her voice is much better when she’s forced to blend with another singer—another indication that drunk-sounding style (as on “Drunken Angel”) is a put on. Also, she intentionally varies the degree of her southern accent. She really pours it on in the song “Concrete and Barbed Wire”. Creepy. In “Greenville“ her vocals are better, because, I think, in this case she’s forced to blend with Emmy Lou Harris. As in “Heartbreaker” by Ryan Adams (reviewed a few days back), here’s Emmy Lou again, putting in a mediocre backup performance. Williams and Harris don’t blend, but at least Williams appears to try. Standard chord structures and rhythms with good backing instrumentals and recording quality, but her contribution to the music is limited to guitar—not much to showcase. The songwriting is what she’s known for, and she does have some talent here, painting poetic pictures of southern lower middle class ambiance. But there’s nothing here that has power. Only pity. This recording won the Grammy for Best Contemporary Folk Album of 1998. Hmmm. 2/5\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\ncall it country or call it a comeback, it's a god damn masterpiece. love letter to dive bars, breakup letter to pain. fav track: 2 kool 2 be 4-gotten\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n4\n\nHad no idea who this artist was (possibly a result of my overall lack of country music knowledge) but she's left an immediate impression on me. Just a country gal with a lot of soul. It's lonely, longing, but not depressing. It's a sort of familiar loneliness that you can appreciate and drift away with. The album never dwells on one feeling for too long though, as it picks up and slows down in nice peaks and valleys. Some songs lean further in a country rock direction than simple folk. This variation is welcomed and makes the music all the more enjoyable.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n4\n\nNever been all that much of a Country guy but when it comes to the travails of love and lust there is material like this that deftly trumps any rock and roll dicks out bombast... \"I take off my watch and my earrings My bracelets and everything Lie on my back and moan at the ceiling Oh my baby\" No content warning on that, damn.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nMy rating for today is not based as much on the music or lyrics (which I did enjoy) as it is on the experience that this album gave to me today. My familiarity with Lucinda Williams comes from a friend including a selection of her tunes on some mixed tapes. Although that friend died a little over a year ago, she definitely accompanied me on my walk today as I listened to the album. She even made a point to give me a nod through a passer-by...The person asked me what time it was so that I could tell them the time and then mumble, \"If you want to know the time, buy a watch.\"\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n4\n\nI really like her voice and style, it reminds me of a feminine version of the guy from the Eels for some reason. Great songs throughout. I just wish it didn’t get so samey, but that’s the nature of the genre sometimes.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n1\n\nThoroughly boring and forgettable. Sounds like royalty free music composed for the SUV commercials that run after an episode of Pioneer Woman. The fact that this is Rolling Stone Magazine's 98th best album of all time shows what a complete disgrace that magazine is. Some albums get onto these sorts of lists not because the MUSIC is good or impressive, but because of their cultural context. Like wow a country woman lazily singing about “Broken down shacks, engine parts”, this album must be so heckin culturally significant!!! As if that's what makes a good album I like old folksy country music quite a bit, from the 1970s and earlier. But modern country utterly disgusts me. The way she pronounces \"Pierce the skin and the blood runs through\" in the first song makes me vomit.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nBeautiful - it doesn't sound like she's copying an older band but still is remaining true to country roots while sounding modern and fresh.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nI’m shocked how much I liked this, not at all my typical style but it’s just so good.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nWhatever else you might think of the genre, there’s no denying that this is a finely crafted, beautifully assembled collection of songs. The production is excellent and the arrangements are terrific. Williams has a knack for evocative images and storytelling.

Lydbildet tar meg rett til Nashvilles skitne underside, med triste små barer og kjærester i fengsel. Tekstene har så klart litt av de vanlige country-klisjeene, men føles dypere, skarpere og mer inderlig enn det meste man hører i sjangeren. Og vokalen til Williams passer perfekt, fra savnet på Drunken Angel, til rebelsk \"twang\" på Joy. Låtene spenner fra klassiske country-ballader (Jackson 💕) til bluesrock, og jeg koser meg hele veien. Liker spesielt godt Joy, Drunken Angel, car wheels...\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nEetswa\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nGreat country album, a benchmark for the genre.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nA good album, reminds me of Tori Amos (or is it the other way round) a bit, or even a female Steve Forbert maybe?

As soon as I heard her lyrics refer to the \"Drunken Angel\" as a \"derelict in duck tape shoes\", it easily became my favourite album I bought in years and one of my ATF country albums. She was loaded with angst at the time she wrote this and poured her soul into it. The subsequent albums she made (that I've heard) haven't come close to this gem. I guess she became happier. Good for her.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nAll good songs, and even a couple hits\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nJust oozes authenticity. This is perhaps a bit less raggedly confessional or emotionally raw as some of her other records, which might cost a bit of power, but it also avoids the risk of sloppy sentimentality (which has been a bit of a occupational hazard for Lu) and gives a sense of control and mastery of every song. This is musicmaking at a very high level, well conceived, extremely well executed, and not overdone or showy. Every song works, and the first five are uniformly strong. The songwriting is terrific, the playing expertly professional. She's a true artist it's hard to believe there's only one of her records on this esteemed list.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nSong after song I thought Oh, this is a good one!\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\n\"Car Wheels on a Gravel Road\" is the fifth studio album from American singer-songwriter Lucinda Williams. The style of music is a mixture of country, pop, blues and folk and really one the albums that began and popularized the Americana/alt country genre. Yeah, when you begin a genre that's a pretty big thing and this album is worthy of that. There are guest appearances by Steve Earle and Emmylou Harris and were multiple producers in Earle, Roy Brittan, Ray Kennedy and Lucinda herself. A good description of the album are themes of heartbreak, love and losing formers lovers and friends with imagery of traveling through/in cities in the US South. The album won the 1998 Grammy for Best Contemporary Folk Album and Village Voice voted it the best 1998 album. Well deserved. A twangy guitar and Lucinda's exhausted voice begins \"Right in Time.\" A great melody and pretty much a perfect sounding pop song. About her losing someone that you thought was perfect for you and, then, ummm, about enjoying yourself thinking about him. Lucinda adds some urgency in her voice to \"Drunken Angels.\" Boy, the layered guitar production is great on this album. A more rock song. The song is about musician Blaze Foley who was shot by his friend's son in a drunken fight. The guitars give \"Can't Let Go\" a jamming, grinding feel. Great slide guitar and guitar solo. A guy left her and she can't forget about him. \"Still I Long for Your Kiss\" has a country-rock vibe. Some more great layered guitars and solos. Another song about not wanting to let someone go. Lucinda gives a rap singing style to \"Joy\" with bluesy guitars and a slide guitar. She traveling from town to town and about a former lover. The album concludes with the soulful/gospel-esque ballad \"Jackson.\" She's traveling from Lafayette to Baton Rouge to Jackson trying to convince herself she won't miss her boyfriend. The album sounded absolutely great not aging since 1998. The production is fantastic and the album just moves along. Multiple styles heard but really in its own category.

Sometimes she overdoes it but this is extraordinary well balanced with the raw power channeled powerfully and beautifully. Plus it's extraordinarily well crafted and executed -- a fully worthy Grammy winner for sure. Several pure classics here and not a dog in the bunch. Great writing (alternatingly poetic, short storyesque and journalistic), mastery of the mid-tempo, and authenticity that puts most other artists (in this genre or adjacents) utterly to shame. That the music business (i.e., record cos) didn’t know what to do with her illustrates just how clueless and soulless it is. That only one of her records is in this esteemed list suggests the same of the editors.

I bought this CD when it first came out and I didn't really like it. Looking back, I'm not sure why that was. But listening to it today (over 25 years later) I find this album fits my musical tastes. At the time this would have been considered Alternative Country, but today we'd call it Americana. Which is a genre I love. This album is amazing and I may need to start incorporating more Lucinda Williams into my listening during the day. Hey voice fits these songs and I now completely understand the hype surrounding this album when it came out. I just want ready at 25 but at 51, I get it! Lucinda is an American treasure! 5/5\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nOne of my favorite singer-songwriter albums. Nothing but great songs and memorable melodies front to back. The first six songs in particular are fantastic. “Joy” is such a good rocker! That chorus is a head-banging, get the crowd chanting anthem. It’s got a great rough and sloppy guitar solo too!\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nI've often said in my reviews that I'm not too much into country or country-rock, but it seems *Car Wheels On The Gravel Road* is one of the (stellar) exceptions to this rule of thumb, which proves the reputation of this record is well-deserved (at least for me). Maybe it's because of the overall \"sound\" of the album, very much indebted to nineties alt-rock as well, or because of William's voice--rough around the edges in ways that I usually love, and reminding me of other \"alternative\" artists such as Lisa Germano. Or maybe it's just because of the great songs and instrumentations--catchy on the surface, but also displaying some interesting textures for the genre once in a while--accordion and/or quite noisy electric guitar riffs played by expert musicians around Lucinda. And the lyrics are so damn evocative: you really feel like you're sharing the routines of distraught young or middle-aged women living in the deep south, stuck in old houses with a quaint charm sprouting out of fields in the sticks, going from boyfriends / husbands doing time in jail to other deadbeat alcoholic boyfriends met in seedy dive bars, or visiting piss-poor friends and their families in the neighboorhood. \"Leaning against the railing of a Lake Charles bridge / Overlooking the river, leaning over the edge / He asked me; \"Would you jump into the water with me?\" / I told him: \"No way baby, it's your own death, you see\". Those lines ending \" 2 Kool 2 Be 4-Gotten\" are just one example of how evocative those lyrics can be. There's not a single dud in this LP, at least if you take it as a panorama of all that country-rock has to offer when it's aptly written and performed. Sure, you have some unavoidable musical and lyrical clichés here and there, but the latter are always served with some tasty gravy on the side. Some isolated diners found on the road can sometimes serve you meals as memorable as the ones of fancy restaurants, as \"simple\" as those meals can look on the menu. Because *all* those songs have something valuable to bring to the table, and the dynamics of the tracklisting, the way those cuts displaying so many different moods are following each other, create one of those records that are always a \"joy\" to return to. The lively jam of the penultimate song bearing that name is one of the highlights of the album by the way, and so is the simple-yet-heartfelt acoustic ballad \"Jackson\" closing the proceedings. And speaking of highlights, opener \"Right In Time\", the title-track, \" 2 Kool 2 Be 4-Gotten\", along with that other acoustic ballad \"Concrete And Barbed Wire\" and that killer cover of Randy Weeks' \"Can't Let Go\" are not to be missed as well. So I'm delighted to add Lucinda Williams to my list of \"exceptions\" when it comes to country and country-rock (Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, The Flying Burrito Brothers, along with some strings of songs by Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton or Marty Robbins). And I'm ready to leave a huge tip on the table. 5 stars then. Number of albums left to review: 291 Number of albums from the list I find relevant enough to be mandatory listens: 313 Albums from the list I *might* include in mine later on: 171 Albums from the list I won't include in mine (many other records are more important to me): 230\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\n5/5.

It still has the twang and topical focus of country, but it does so in a way that transcends genre cliches. Honestly, it’s a great entry point into country, and I’m shocked I didn’t come to it sooner. There isn’t a bad song on this album, and to my own surprise, it is quickly becoming a newfound favorite.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\n**Album Review: \"Car Wheels on a Gravel Road\" by Lucinda Williams** *Release Date:* June 30, 1998 *Label:* Mercury Records *Genre:* Americana, Country Rock \"Car Wheels on a Gravel Road\" is Lucinda Williams' fifth studio album, and it stands as a seminal work in the Americana and country rock genres.
