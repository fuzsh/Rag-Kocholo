        "text": "March 7, 2012\n\nToday’s song is Telling Me Lies by Linda Thompson and covered by the Trio. After divorce from husband Richard in 1982, Linda began the gradual work of assembling her first solo album. She wrote many of the tracks with Betsy Cook whom she had met through Gerry Rafferty when he was exchanging album work with Richard and Linda in the late 70s. Although many (including Linda herself) bemoan the heavy 80s production values, One Clear Moment is a strong album with many great songs. One of the true standouts is Telling Me Lies. Although it’s tempting to read it as autobiography (and perhaps a counterpoint to Richard’s She Twists the Knife Again from Across A Crowded Room, his album of the same year), it is a very universal song that fits easily into her catalog.\n\nYou told me you needed my company\n\nAnd I believed in your flattering ways\n\nTold me you needed me forever\n\nNearly gave you the rest of my days\n\nShould’ve seen you for what you are\n\nShould never have come back for more\n\nShould’ve locked up all my silver\n\nBrought the key back to your door\n\nI cover my ears I close my eyes\n\nStill hear your voice and it’s telling me lies\n\nTelling me lies"
