Brittany’s style is rooted in the folk and Americana music she has loved all her life, and in one way or another, every song she sings is a love song.\n\nDuring the past few years, Brittany’s performances have ventured farther and farther from home — opening for Three Dog Night’s sold out show at the City Winery in New York City, playing the legendary Bluebird Cafe in Nashville, performing at the Kerrville Folk Festival in Texas, taking on her first international tour on Vancouver Island, British Columbia… to name a few adventures!\n\nBrittany has released five, full-length albums — all recorded in Nashville: Whispered Stories, Leavin’ Home, Wander With Me, All The Love, and Wintertide…\n\nEarly 2020, after learning of and then dealing with the loss of her performance schedule for the rest of that year, Brittany turned her focus to creating her first-ever Christmas Album.

Lucky Star features Williams’ roots driven compositions alongside songs by the aforementioned Texas legend Hyatt, a woman known as the “Empress of the Blues” and another from the original soul sister, known as “the Godmother of rock and roll.”\n\nBrooks Williams hails from Statesboro, Georgia, the town made famous by country-blues legend Blind Willie McTell.

Thirteen songs deep and recorded in North America and Frankfurt, Germany, the Rising Tide sessions were mentored by Grammy-nominated internationally renowned bluegrass star Claire Lynch, whose incredible band served as support on the album, along with a few other notable musicians.\n\nEngineered by Nicolas Tjelios (Basia Bulat, Jenny Whiteley, Ken Whiteley,) the intriguing and topical self-penned songs reflect “life and connections,” Taivi says, ranging from taking stock (“Red Moon Rise”) and ecology (“The Clearwater”) to romance (“When I’m With You, a duet with Nova Scotian Ryan Roberts) and rumination (“One More Dance.”)\n\n“I feel lucky to have a body of work like Rising Tide out there,” says Taivi. “From the inspiration for the songs through the production, it has drawn from – and brought together – beautiful influences in my life. It’s a continuing journey – and I’m looking forward to where the next step is going to take me.” Keep an eye peeled for Taivi as she brings Rising Tide to stages – a fresh wave of excellent music that will leave you pining for more.\n\nLearn More\n\nLeah Kaufman\n\nIn the 1990’s, Seattle singer-songwriter Leah Kaufman released three recordings with popular acoustic quintet ‘The Wailing Strangers’, and her own solo debut CD, ‘Five Fingers’. Performing in festivals and venues throughout the Northwest, her songs garnered songwriting awards and accolades from the South Florida Songwriting Competition, Intermountain Acoustic Music Association, Mid-Atlantic Songwriting Competition and the Austin Songwriting Competition.\n\nNow, in 2017, relocated to Raleigh, North Carolina, Leah’s re-emerging with a new collection of songs that demonstrate resilience and a deeper commitment to writing, singing and performing. Her songwriting takes a love for old-time music’s drive and melodic simplicity and marries it with the evocative lyricism of contemporary songwriting. The result: songs with melodies that stick like glue and lyrics that tell stories you love hearing. An accomplished finger-style guitar player as well as fine flat-picker, whether her songs slide into bluegrass, swing or blues, the common core of exquisite lyrics, fine guitar work and a clear strong voice holds true.\n\nHer latest album, “On To Something Fine”, pulses with rhythm and vibrant musicianship, acoustic music that steps into Americana, bluegrass, contemporary singer-songwriter, even a touch of country-swing and folk-rock. From the sweetness of a lullaby to a driving honky-tonk dance tune, each song starts with the backbone of articulate guitar playing and then layers on an ear-catching voice that pulls you in to each song’s unique story.\n\nLearn More\n\nBill Booth\n\nWith “Some Distant Shore,” Bill Booth illustrates the depth of his character, with a hearty mix of acoustic rock, Americana and Celtic-inspired folk. The roots-rock artist who has been described as “a Mark Knopfler with fiddle and accordion,” has also been likened to J.J. Cale, Tom Pacheco, Springsteen, and Tony Joe White.\n\nOn “Some Distant Shore”, he returns to some of the folk roots of his native New England, with it’s long history of Irish, English and Scottish immigration, to create an album which draws its musical and lyrical inspiration from the traditions of the British Isles as well as areas of North America where there is a stronger Celtic influence.\n\nAn expatriated American who has been based in Oslo since entering the Norwegian music scene performing on the fiddle with rock legend Åge Alexandersen, he has released five critically well-received solo albums of self-penned songs, and composed for and performed on dozens of releases by other established artists.Bill Booth appears regularly either with his own band or as a solo acoustic performer (guitar and fiddle) at festivals and concert arenas as well as folk clubs and venues in Scandinavia and other parts of Europe and the United States.\n\nLearn More\n\nBrooks Williams\n\nIn celebration of his November 2016 UK Tour, Inside The Blues, with Guy Davis, Brooks Williams has released an album of some of his favourite blues songs. Recorded “old school” with just voice and guitar (acoustic, resonator and cigar box), live in the studio, using vintage mics and a creaky chair, Brooks’ Blues is a fitting homage to the music that has inspired this Statesboro, Georgia native since, well, the day he was born. Williams says: “I’m pretty sure my mother and father weren’t thinking anything about the blues when I was born in Statesboro, Georgia. And they certainly wouldn’t have known anything about Blind Willie McTell’s song, Statesboro Blues, which put Statesboro on the blues map forever. Little did they know what a legacy they were handing me.”\n\nBrooks’ Blues represents Williams’ unique relationship with the blues, a relationship based not only on a ‘feel’ for the music, and a technical prowess with the music, but also an intimate knowledge of the place from which this music has sprung. His soulful arrangements are fresh and re-visioned, but they are also as familiar as a front-porch conversation.\n\n“Blues great Willie Dixon once said, “The blues is the roots, the rest are the fruits.” I’ve built a 25-plus CD career based on the fruits,” says Williams. “Now’s the time for the roots.”\n\n#8 ALBUM AT FOLK RADIO – JANUARY 2017\n\n#10 ARTIST AT FOLK RADIO – JANUARY 2017\n\nLearn More\n\nDavid Mallett\n\nWith the release of Celebration, David Mallett’s 17th collection of original music, he continues to build on his reputation as a consummate American songwriter. The album is already drawing praise for Mallett’s sophisticated, poetic — almost literate — approach to his music, leading one critic to proclaim “somebody’s got to make this man the musical poet laureate of… America.”\n\nFor over four decades, Maine-based David Mallett has remained a quintessential modern troubadour, performing thousands of shows, from backwoods grange halls to Wolf Trap, A Prairie Home Companion and The Newport Folk Festival. His songs have been sung in concert halls, festivals and folk clubs around the world by himself and many of the world’s most iconic singers, including Emmylou Harris, Alison Krauss and Pete Seeger.\n\n#7 ALBUM AT FOLK RADIO – SEPTEMBER 2016\n\n#7 SONG AT FOLK RADIO – “CELEBRATION” – SEPTEMBER 2016\n\n#7 ARTIST AT FOLK RADIO – SEPTEMBER 2016\n\nLearn More\n\nThe Sommers Rosenthal Family Band\n\nThe Sommers Rosenthal Family Band is one of the most exciting and diversely talented family bands on the scene today.

Their new CD, Grain by Grain, demonstrates an ever progressive richness in songwriting and performance. From the opening title song through its closing track — “Across the Morning” — it is an exemplar of what modern Americana can and should be. “ – Nick Noble, WICN\n\n#16 ALBUM AT FOLK RADIO – APRIL 2016\n\nLearn More\n\nTim May & Steve Smith\n\nIntroducing the Tim May & Steve Smith duo. Tim (guitar, vocals) met Steve (mandolin, vocals) while on staff at Camp Bluegrass in Levelland, Texas and quickly discovered many common musical threads for exploration, honoring tradition and improvisation. Their new CD/EP reflects upon the acoustic music force the duo has become. Their shows include tight vocal harmonies, dazzling guitar, mandolin, octave mandolin and twin mandolin works throughout a broad range of styles, and include many original vocal and instrumental works.\n\nTim May (Nashville, TN) is most familiar to folk radio DJs and listeners as part of the duo Carpenter & May, which had a #1 album in 2010. He’s toured with Patty Loveless, John Cowan and Eddie Rabbitt. Tim was the solo guitarist on Charlie Daniels’ recording of I’ll Fly Away, which was nominated for a Grammy in 2005, the same year he was session leader on the critically acclaimed Moody Bluegrass album (he later played on Moody Bluegrass II as well). The Nashville Scene selected Tim in the Best Instrumentalist category in their 2012 Reader’s Choice Poll. PK Thompson Guitars, Collings Mandolins, Shubb Capos, Elixir Strings, Hoffee Cases, Benedetto Guitars , L.R. Baggs Pickups & Pre-amps and Breedlove Guitars all have presented professional endorsements to Tim, a serious nod to his talents.\n\nSteve Smith (Las Cruces, NM) is not only known as one of the United States’ top mandolin players but also as an outstanding educator. Along with his work with the Roots/Bluegrass group The Hard Road Trio, Steve has been on faculty at camps ranging from Steve Kaufman’s Acoustic Camp to the Puget Sound Guitar Workshop.

His music has been heard on countless radio stations across the US and on the Discovery Channel, The History Channel and even the Weather Channel.\n\nDownload One-Sheet\n\nGene & Gayla Mills\n\nGene and Gayla Mills play acoustic Americana—modern folk tinged with bluegrass and country, featuring Gene’s award-winning original songs. They offer “some of the best organic music you could hope to come across—killer stuff” (Chris Spector, Midwest Record). “One of the best (and also one of the best-kept secrets) in the central Virginia music scene,” the duo features “impressive lead guitar, solid bass fiddle, and smooth harmonies.” Gene’s songs tell rich, concrete stories of memorable characters, from miners and farmers to lovers and soldiers.\n\nTheir CD If Stones Could Talk reached #11 on the Folk DJ chart and #5 on the Roots Music Folk Chart for four months.\n\nIn their second duo record, Walk on Solid Ground, Gene and Gayla Mills once again appeal to the head and heart with original songs exploring the breadth and nuance of life. In Gene’s story songs, some characters overcome weakness, loss, or a broken heart, while others embrace the beauty and brevity of experience. Some songs continue the folk tradition of protesting threats from moneyed interests. Others poke fun at the opposite sex, embrace flirtation, or express the intensity of love.\n\nThe duo’s eclectic mix of traditional folk, bluegrass, country, and Americana centers on the sounds of Gene’s acoustic guitar, Gayla’s upright bass, and their supple harmony singing, enhanced by guest musicians on dobro, mandolin, and drums.\n\n#10 ALBUM AT FOLK RADIO – APRIL 2015\n\nDownload One-Sheet\n\nEliza Lynn\n\nWhen Eliza Lynn tosses her long red hair back and steps up to the microphone to sing, a world of music comes pouring out. Foothills folk, backwoods hollers, playful pop, lilting Texas Swing and deep country blues; over the course of her young-but-well-traveled life, the St. Louis based singer/songwriter has absorbed it all. With a career bolstered by community support through album pre-sales and individual and business sponsorship, Lynn has taken the idea of community participation in her musical career to a new level.\n\nEliza’s new release, Goodbye Nashville, was recorded on the Isle of Mull one year ago with musicians from the Perthshire Amber festival: Gordon MacLean, Sorren MacLean, Hannah Fisher and Danny Grant. Eliza says, “With Gordon co-producing, engineering, and generally holding the space for magic to happen, Goodbye Nashville came into being. These four musicians have many hours, many years, logged playing together, so to step into their midst – into such exceptional, intuitive musicianship – was a true delight for me. And I couldn’t have known then how these tracks would carry me through the next year of grief and lamentation.”\n\nBuilt on a sturdy Appalachian foundation and soaked in the blues, Lynn’s evocative singing voice, which has drawn comparisons to everyone from Bonnie Raitt to Peggy Lee, is the driving force and centerpiece of her albums and live shows. Whether she’s wailing away on clawhammer banjo or gently displaying her Piedmont blues chops, every song provides brilliant musical proof that Eliza Lynn is an artist whose time has come.\n\nDownload One-Sheet\n\nSteve Kahn\n\nSteve Kahn is an award winning singer/songwriter.

All three albums have been produced in Davis, CA by Dave Nachmanoff, a singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist who tours internationally both on his own and as the opening act and guitarist for Al Stewart.

Laura Hall (writer, vocals, guitar, accordion, ukulele) is best known for her piano work on “Whose Line is it Anyway”, and came up in the acoustic music scene in Chicago, playing in bands with Michael Smith, Buddy Mondlock and Tim Grimm. Kelly Macleod (writer, vocals, guitar) cut her teeth on the road after being discovered by Eddie Van Halen while singing at a local bar in Shreveport, La. Eddie brought her band, Private Life, on a world tour with him, and produced their two albums. Rick Hall (bass, harmonica, vocals) has been seen on countless television shows, films and commercials. He loves to write and tell stories about growing up on a farm in Central Illinois. Rick turned one of his stories into a short film, SLICE OF PIE, which he shot in his hometown. He cast Kelly in her debut acting role, and Laura created the score. Out of that collaborative process, The Sweet Potatoes was born.\n\nFaith, Good Neighbors and a Telephone is produced by Nashville favorite, Phil Swann. The band is joined in the studio by guests that include David Carpenter (Billy Ray Cyrus, Julian Lennon) and Laura Hall’s bandmate from her “day job” as the pianist on “Whose Line is it Anyway”, Linda Taylor (Maia Sharp, Crystal Bowersox). Although they’re all old hands at performing, this is the new music from their hearts. These are the songs that really tell their stories, loaded with back porch harmonies and a touch of twang.\n\n#15 ALBUM AT FOLK RADIO – JULY 2014\n\n#9 SONG AT FOLK RADIO – JUNE 2014\n\nDownload One-Sheet\n\nThomas Snow\n\nMaine based pianist Thomas Snow releases his new CD “Friends” with the help of celebrated singer-songwriter Jonathan Edwards (”Sunshine” and “Shanty”) and a crew of top-notch musicians. Until now, Snow has been primarily known as a jazz musician who has performed with countless jazz luminaries. With “Friends”, Thomas re-discovers timeless, classic songs from the American folk canon and breathes new energy into these long-loved songs. Beautifully performed, his treatment of this repertoire is exciting, genuine and heartfelt.\n\nThomas Snow has played with Harry Allen, Jeff Coffin, Dave Holland, Ken Peplowski, Larry Coryell, Phil Wilson, and Herb Pomeroy. In the pop world, Thomas has also played and recorded with many artists including The Motor Booty Affair, bluesman Troy Turner, and celebrated singer/songwriter Gene McDaniels.\n\nIn addition to appearing on dozens of recordings, he has released three CDs of his own. Thomas has degrees from Berklee College of Music (B.A., 1991) and the New England Conservatory of Music (M.M., 2005). Aside from his performing and writing career, Thomas is a Lecturer in Music at Bates College and records and tours frequently with Jonathan Edwards.\n\n“Friends” is a distinct departure from his previous three, jazz-influenced offerings. This is Thomas’ long-awaited folk/Americana CD featuring his remarkable piano playing together with the incomparable voice of award-winning singer-songwriter Jonathan Edwards. Thomas has creatively set this collection of standard repertoire into new and fresh settings.\n\nAri & Mia\n\nAri & Mia, Boston’s Americana sister act, reference the traditions of Southern and Northeastern fiddle music and the early American songbook to create a realm where their own compositions cross paths with older traditions. Their stylish and sophisticated music honors the sounds of Appalachian cottages, rural dance floors, and urban concert halls. Combine this with their innovative approach to song and tune-writing and the result is a fresh and contemporary sound.\n\nAri & Mia “blend a traditional rootsy grounding with a clear background of classical training. Their own works are soothing and fresh, tasteful and accomplished. This duo is taking the classical study of a conservatory program and bringing it alive in folk touring circles,” says SingOut! Magazine. Both sisters studied at Boston’s New England Conservatory in its cutting edge Contemporary Improvisation department.\n\nTheir album, Unruly Heart, ranked high on the national folk radio charts for 2011 and Mia’s song “Across the Water,” won the 2010 John Lennon Songwriting Contest in the folk category. Their brand new album, Land on Shore, was released in May 2013.\n\n#19 ALBUM AT FOLK RADIO – JUNE 2013\n\nBuffy Ford Stewart\n\nHer name is Buffy Ford-Stewart, the widow of The Kingston Trio original group member John Stewart. He called her Angel Rain. For John Stewart, who died in San Diego in 2008, she was the muse for one of the great American singer-songwriters of the last 50 years. Without her, he may never have written the body of work ranging from “Daydream Believer,” “Mother Country,” and “California Bloodlines” to the latter day “Jasmine.” As one of the founders of Americana music, she inspired John’s lyrical, authentic, poetic, and visionary body of work. She was his all-time woman, the one who believed in him, the keeper of the flame lit by the treasury of songs authored by poet, artist, writer, dreamer, storyteller, and magic man.\n\nToday, she follows a road of her own, a highway she once traveled with John. But, she does not walk it alone. A legion of John Stewart fans or Bloodliners, her close friends and family walk with her. She is a cancer survivor who has walked the borderline between life and death. She is still a daydream believer, still a homecoming queen, still the girl swept away by the lonesome troubadour of her youth.\n\nAfter many hit albums, Buffy is back with more powerful vocals than ever before in her newest CD, Same Old Heart. She rides high in her rhythm and gives astonishing takes on classics. This album speaks volumes with the tone of her career. She weaves magic into every song, and leaves you with a great feeling after hearing each take that she demands.\n\nDownload One-Sheet\n\nHey Mavis\n\nThe music of Hey Mavis can only be described as “Appalachian Americana”. With banjo, fiddle, upright bass, guitar, kick drum and harmonica, the quartet effortlessly moves from a softly orchestrated lullaby to a raw and raucous love song. “The songs feel soulful, they have dirt and substance,” says Hey Mavis founder Laurie Michelle Caner. “There is a sense of being grounded and close to the earth, and we try to breathe life into everything we do.”\n\nAfter their most recent summer tour out west, during which Hey Mavis achieved notoriety as a finalist in the highly acclaimed Telluride Bluegrass Festival Band Contest, Laurie (banjo/vocals/songwriting) and Ed Caner (fiddle/viola) started working with Cleveland songwriter/guitarist/vocalist Brent Kirby and seasoned upright bassist, Bryan Thomas.\n\nSet to an instrumentation and impression of timeless Appalachian backwoods, the songs on Honey Man represent tales constructed around passing imagery of emotions and situations, such as relationships, the joy and labor of raising a child, hurting and heartbreak. The songs on Honey Man seem to lead us on a journey through the complex emotions of adult life, where one can only end up where they began, in a place where the simplicity of love always wins.\n\nHoney Man is produced by the legendary Don Dixon (REM, Red Clay Ramblers, Smithereens), who also produced their first CD, Red Wine. Red Wine immediately climbed the international Folk DJ-L radio charts, peaking at #5 for overall artist while the songs “Red Light” and “Red Wine” peaked at #5 and #9. The CD finished the year at #12 in Folk Alley’s “Top CD’s of 2010”.\n\nDownload One-Sheet\n\nMaria Gillard\n\nMaria Gillard is a talented singer, songwriter, and educator from the Finger Lakes Region of New York State.

It is her journey of creating studio versions of some songs that were written through a confusing period of transformation, grief and recovery. We mend ourselves little by little through love, faith, forgiveness and letting go. Peace is within our reach at all times.

The highest of songwriting standards combined with the extraordinary voice of singer Jenny Schaub has earned them a solid reputation amongst critics around the globe.

They are based in the sister cities of Carrboro and Chapel Hill, deep in the heart of the North Carolina Piedmont. Their music features layered vocal harmonies intertwined with a mix of flatpicking and finger-styled guitars, mandolin, dobro, harmonica, and bass. They perform original tunes that span the spectrum from love to war to caffeine. Their influences are as diverse as Gram Parsons, Donald Fagen, Gillian Welch, John Lennon, Tim and Mollie O’Brien, and John and Michelle Phillips.\n\nThe eclectic mix of songs that comprises Caffeinated Heart is rooted in the contemporary singer-songwriter tradition, but fortified with a healthy dose of rock-and-roll and tempered with a sweet dusting of bluegrass. In this, their debut album, the Carrborators ponder the challenges of the twenty-first century, with thoughtful lyrics that are intensified by the carefully-crafted harmonic structure of the music. The result is pure acoustic Americana, served with a shot of caffeine (the original fuel additive).\n\nCaffeinated Heart also includes guest appearances by fiddler Bobby Britt (Town Mountain, Big Fat Gap), banjoist Chandler Holt (Chatham County Line), guitarist Will McFarlane (Bonnie Raitt, The Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section), drummer Mitch Easter (Sneakers, Let’s Active), and percussionist Colin Cannell (Skylark, the Donnybrook Lads). The album was recorded in Chapel Hill by Chris Stamey (the dBs, the Chris Stamey Band).\n\nDownload One-Sheet\n\nThe Barefoot Movement\n\nThe Barefoot Movement is a trio of immensely talented musicians from North Carolina and Tennessee whose music successfully melds Americana influences with the invigoration of acoustic modern rock and jazz. Their sound simultaneously captures the rustic beauty of old Southern front porch Bluegrass improvisation while being immediately accessible to the modern era.\n\nThe group was initially formed when Noah Wall, singer and fiddler, and Tommy Norris, mandolin player, attended high school together in their home county of Granville, NC and began setting Noah’s lyrics to Tommy’s chords. Though the band was threatened when the two members left to attend colleges in different states, it was while Noah was a student of the Bluegrass, Old-Time, and Country Music Program at Eastern Tennessee State University that she met Quentin Acres, when both were chosen to perform for the Old-Time Pride Band. The three soon united to form The Barefoot Movement. The name evolved from Noah’s tendency to remove her shoes during shows, a testament to the relaxed atmosphere and down-home stylings of the group.\n\nThis evolution of sound can be heard in their latest record “Footwork,” a polished opus showcasing the group’s maturation and talent. Noah’s voice is subtly piercing while displaying a remarkable range, from the toe-tapping, barn-raising Calico Jack to the melodic, nostalgic Tobacco Road. Barefoot Movement’s newest album is nothing short of addictive. Embedded in each track are compelling visual evocations, complex tonal twists, and a downright good time.\n\n#7 ALBUM AT FOLK RADIO – OCTOBER 2011\n\nDownload One-Sheet\n\nMoody Bluegrass Two…Much Love\n\nLegendary Nashville songwriter Roger Miller once wrote about what happens “When Two Worlds Collide,” but even though, at first glance, the progressive British rock of the Moody Blues and the all-star bluegrass lineup paying tribute to that music may seem worlds apart, the harmonious results, Moody Bluegrass Two…Much Love, prove they’re really parallel universes.\n\nFollowing 2004’s critically and commercially acclaimed tribute to the legendary Moody Blues, the GRAMMY nominated Moody Bluegrass, along with the highly successful Moody Bluegrass Live, Nashville’s finest have come together again to honor the Moody Blues. Producer David Harvey returns for this second volume, which perfectly blends the brilliant songwriting of the Moody Blues with the bluegrass sounds of mandolins, banjos and even clogging. The record spans the entire Moody Blues catalogue, and includes fan favorites such as “Tuesday Afternoon” and “I Know You’re Out There.” Moody Bluegrass Two…Much Love translates the Moody Blues’ original songs seamlessly, and much like the first bluegrass tribute, the beauty of the original Moody Blues music shines. There are stellar performances from Vince Gill, Ricky Skaggs, Carl Jackson, Tim O’Brien, Peter Rowan, Sam Bush, Larry Cordle, Jon Randall, the late Harley Allen, and more. They are surrounded by the best-of-the-best musicians, engineers and vocalists.\n\nFor the first time in over 30 years, all five Moody Blues members perform on the same album; Justin Hayward, John Lodge and Graeme Edge are joined by retired members Ray Thomas and Mike Pinder. With Moody Bluegrass Two…Much Love, the worlds of bluegrass and progressive rock don’t collide, they combine, finding common ground in perfect harmony.\n\nDownload One-Sheet\n\nGene & Gayla Mills\n\nGene and Gayla Mills play acoustic Americana–folk tinged with bluegrass, country, and more. “One of the best (and also one of the best-kept secrets) in the central Virginia music scene,” the duo features “impressive lead guitar, solid bass fiddle, and smooth harmonies.” Gene’s songs tell rich, concrete stories of memorable characters, from miners and farmers to lovers and soldiers.\n\nIn their new release, “If Stones Could Talk”, Gene portrays recent events, from a vet’s account of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq in Forgetting to the pain a woman faces in the recession after two years of unemployment in Twelve Days. Their acoustic Americana sound varies from a folk feel on Great Divide and Talking to a Stone, to a bluegrass treatment on Milk and Honey and River, Railway, Road and a traditional country sound on Thriving and Everyday Things. Two instrumentals, flat-picked Bright Blue Eyes and finger-picked Dying Fire with spare bass accompaniment, add further depth. Talking to a Stone has already won two first place songwriting awards, and Gene’s first CD, “Waiting for Rain”, garnered national airplay and more than a dozen songwriting awards.\n\nThe duo are joined on various tracks by Bill Evans (banjo), Ivan Rosenberg (dobro), Barry Lawson (mandolin), and Jim Skelding (fiddle). Add a professional sound by famed engineer Bill McElroy, and Gene and Gayla have an alt country Americana sound both contemporary and timeless.\n\n#11 ALBUM AT FOLK RADIO – AUGUST 2011\n\n#9 SONG AT FOLK RADIO – AUGUST 2011\n\nDownload One-Sheet\n\nDowntown Ramblers\n\nMeet the Downtown Ramblers. They call themselves a “nordic urban bluegrass” band, a mixed expression that indicates the music they play, where they’re from and what they love. Their music is based on traditional bluegrass with influences from all kinds of music, including Swedish folk music, pop, and jazz. It all started in 2005, when lead singer Emelie Junsten asked Pär Öjerot if he wanted to play some country music with her. Within a few weeks Martin Blomberg and Oskar Reuter were invited to join the band. After a few lineup changes, bass player Kalle Annerhult joined and the Downtown Ramblers took the form that remains the same to this very day.\n\nIn the early days of the Downtown Ramblers, they played covers, but their focus gradually changed and they decided to dedicate the band to bluegrass only. By that time, Oskar, the mandolin player, also started to write songs for the band. In the fall of 2007, the Downtown Ramblers won the Swedish Bluegrass Championships, and the following summer they performed at almost every major country and bluegrass festival in Sweden. They released their first CD in late 2008.\n\nTheir follow-up CD, “On the Other Side of the City”, has just been released, featuring thoughtful lyrics, beautiful harmonies and tasty licks. Grammy award winner Tim O’Brien sings and plays fiddle on “Be My Baby Still”, and Crooked Still fiddler Brittany Haas joins in on three tracks. This is a band on the rise, worldwide. Just consider: in 2009, they were voted the #1 European Bluegrass Band at the European World of Bluegrass Festival. This gave the band the opportunity to present their music to an American audience for the first, but certainly not last time at the IBMA’s World of Bluegrass in 2010 (Nashville, TN).\n\n#4 ALBUM AT FOLK RADIO – AUGUST 2011\n\n#1 SONG AT FOLK RADIO – AUGUST 2011\n\n#7 ARTIST AT FOLK RADIO – AUGUST 2011\n\nDownload One-Sheet\n\nellen cherry\n\nellen cherry is a singer, songwriter, musician, designer, artist, producer, recording engineer, and human.

His music has been covered and recorded by a variety of notable musicians such as Gregory Alan Isakov, Brandi Carlile, Victoria Williams, 3 Penny Acre and many countless others. Along with being a regional finalist in the Kerrville Songwriting Competition, his song “If I Go, I’m Goin” was in season four of Showtime’s television series “Californication”.

He performs often throughout the Southwest and is currently touring to support his new album “Disappear” .\n\nJ. Wagner’s fourth album “Disappear” is a collection of eleven songs that takes you down the desert highway, pass the sage brush and the fields of grain, and then lets you whisk like smoke and speed off with the hills behind you. Wagner has a keen interest in the human condition and his lyrics take a curious glance at both the individual who loves, who feels alone, and the culture we all inhabit. “Disappear” is a lyrical-based album that moves like desert wind, so much so, you can practically smell the cacti and creosote on the rain.\n\n#12 ALBUM AT FOLK RADIO – FEBRUARY 2011\n\n#14 ARTIST AT FOLK RADIO – FEBRUARY 2011\n\nDownload One-Sheet\n\nShaun Cromwell\n\nA singer/writer of eclectic roots-inspired songs, Shaun Cromwell uses his guitar, banjo, and voice to weave tales of intrigue and epics of sorrow.

Armed with a storyteller’s eye and a restless independent spirit, Stine delivers his latest album, ‘I Wasn’t Built for a Life Like This’.\n\nHis deeply personal music has been described by Honest Tune Magazine as, “somewhere between the renegade cowboy-poetry of Townes Van Zandt and the sweet rough and tumble sound of Neil Young’s Harvest. The power in his music comes not from overwhelming volume or violent guitars, but from simple strums and carefully measured words that together carry an army of unmatched strength.”\n\n‘I Wasn’t Built for a Life Like This’, Stine’s 5th full-length album, is a collection of ten-unflinchingly direct songs in which Stine continues to tell the story of his exploration in what he calls, “an evolving and eroding America. “ The New Yorker calls this direct approach, “appropriately train-like, steady and powerful.” His timeless style of songwriting evokes images of a classic generation of outlaw- Country songwriters like Kris Kristofferson, Steve Earle, and Willie Nelson.

For this session, the microphones were set up, we gathered around them and played each song, and then we picked the take that sounded the best. We’ve tried as much as possible to leave it at that,” says the duo from Charlottesville, Virginia. “The songs in this collection encompass so much of what we love about traditional southern mountain music- the earthy singing, the haunting guitar melody, the message the song delivers.

With this album, they sought to expand their sound with broader instrumentation and a strong focus on the three-part vocal blend they developed with Noah’s wife, Kailyn Wright. The duo finds its niche somewhere between Nickel Creek, Iron & Wine, The Tin Hat Trio and Lunasa; their deep understanding of traditional folk music is easily recognized even as their creative original material continues to explore new musical horizons.\n\n#7 ALBUM AT FOLK RADIO – SEPTEMBER 2010\n\n#16 ARTIST AT FOLK RADIO – SEPTEMBER 2010\n\nSTILL ON CHART AS OF JANUARY 2011\n\nDownload One-Sheet\n\nHey Mavis\n\nLegendary producer Don Dixon (REM, Red Clay Ramblers, Smithereens) “discovered” Hey Mavis after they were featured on a 2009 Christmas compilation. Four months later, Dixon produced their debut CD, Red Wine.\n\nHey Mavis crosses the genres of Americana, Texas Two-step, Bluegrass, Folk, and Art Rock, with a unique blend of sweet vocal harmonies, banjo, upright bass, and over-the-top fiddle and viola solos. In their songwriting, the trio finds the fine threads within stories of all types–from the fantastic to everyday–and weaves them into musical journeys.\n\nHey Mavis is Laurie Michelle Caner (lead songwriter, vocals, and banjo), Sarah Benn (songwriter, vocals, and bass), and Eddie Caner (viola profunda, fiddle and vocals). Laurie and Sarah both have extensive experience as members of the all-women vocal harmony group The Rhondas. Ed has toured and performed all over the globe as sideman and soloist with over 25 major artists, including Smokey Robinson, Page and Plant, Luciano Pavarotti, Natalie Cole, and more.\n\n#5 ALBUM AT FOLK RADIO – SEPTEMBER 2010\n\n#5 SONG AT FOLK RADIO – SEPTEMBER 2010\n\n#8 ARTIST AT FOLK RADIO – SEPTEMBER 2010\n\nDownload One-Sheet\n\n3 Penny Acre\n\n3 Penny Acre is a musical collaboration between three up and coming songwriters: Bayard Blain, Bernice Hembree, and Bryan Hembree. Fans and critics have quickly identified their unique, Ozark-inspired sound as distinct, yet universally appealing. Listeners in all corners have begun to appreciate their attention to lyrics, harmony, and carefully crafted acoustic arrangements steeped in roots music traditions but with a focus on fresh, new songs.\n\nShortly after forming as a band, 3 Penny Acre won the 2008 Walnut Valley Festival (Winfield, Kansas) NewSongs competition. The exposure the win brought 3 Penny Acre helped to solidify their path as emerging artists. In the 18 months that followed, they toured extensively throughout the nation, were invited as an official showcase artist to the 2009 and 2010 International Folk Alliance Conference, and released a debut album that was selected as one of the Top 40 albums of 2009 by Norm Mast and Al Kniola of The Back Porch 88.1 WVPE (Indiana) and won “Album of the Year” at the Northwest Arkansas Music Awards.\n\nTheir sophomore effort “Highway 71” is an album of 10 songs documenting the people and places of middle America. 3 Penny Acre, whose name comes from the cost of the Louisiana Purchase, is a fitting name for a band whose members were all raised inside its borders. The album paints a portrait of their homeland two-hundred years on. The songs are beautiful and longing, yet at times anti-nostalgic, resisting the temptation to “gold wash” the tough history of the people and places they portray.\n\n#3 ALBUM AT FOLK RADIO AT FOLK RADIO – JULY AND AUGUST 2010\n\n#1 SONG AT FOLK RADIO – JULY AND AUGUST 2010\n\n#3 ARTIST AT FOLK RADIO – JULY 2010; #6 in AUGUST 2010\n\n#10 SONG, #36 ALBUM OF 2010 AT FOLK RADIO ON 2010 YEAR END CHART\n\nSTILL ON CHART AS OF JANUARY 2011\n\nLainie Marsh\n\nLainie Marsh studied music at Boston’s Berklee College and subsequently plied the singing and songwriting trades in Los Angeles before coming to Nashville in 1989. With her band, The Cool Miners, she has performed on The Mountain Stage and as a featured artist at both the Nashville Entertainment Extravaganza and Tin Pan South music showcases.\n\nHer songs have been recorded by Emmylou Harris and Cerys Matthews, as well as featured on National Public Radio. Her 2009 CD recording, The Hills Will Cradle Thee, on the independent Bait & Tackle Records label, features a stellar cast of musicians, including Ketch Secor of The Old Crow Medicine Show, pedal steel virtuoso Bucky Baxter, and Kent Goodson, longtime keyboard player with George Jones.\n\nThis is brave record, down home and exotic at once, from an Appalachian artist not worried about getting the Appalachian thing right. The Hills Will Cradle Thee surpasses hackneyed narratives of the coal mining experience to achieve a unique chronicle of one mountaineer’s odyssey through what lies yonder, delivered up with a maverick vocal style.\n\n#15 ALBUM AT FOLK RADIO – MARCH 2010\n\n#5 SONG AT FOLK RADIO – MARCH 2010\n\nDownload One-Sheet\n\nThe Honey Dewdrops\n\nLaura Wortman and Kagey Parrish are The Honey Dewdrops: a nationally touring and award winning husband and wife duet who perform fresh, original songs focusing on vocal harmonies and tight instrumentation. If the Sun Will Shine, their debut record, was recorded live and mixed in a 1920’s barn. The record is meant to pay homage to their live performances – full of the same energy and emotion The Honey Dewdrops bring to the stage.\n\nThe album is a collection of songs that The Honey Dewdrops have written over the past two years and it features material that comes straight from the heart. There are eleven original tunes – some of which are award winners, and a few of the songs got Laura and Kagey plane tickets to St. Paul, Minnesota where they won first place on A Prairie Home Companion’s “People in their Twenties Talent Show” in March 2008.\n\nThey just opened for Eddie from Ohio in January 2010 at a sold-out show at The Birchmere; in February, they will open for the David Wax Museum at Club Passim. Additionally, the Dewdrops were selected as finalists in the 2009 Mountain Stage NewSong competition and recently took 2nd place in the Eddie’s Attic Open-Mic Shootout Finals in Decatur, Georgia.\n\nThis is a record capturing “something haunting, melancholic and all-together charming” (Jeff Royer, Fly Magazine).\n\n#2 ALBUM AT FOLK RADIO – FEBRUARY AND MARCH 2010\n\n#1 SONG AT FOLK RADIO – FEBRUARY 2010; #2 SONG IN MARCH 2010\n\n#3 ARTIST AT FOLK RADIO – FEBRUARY 2010; #4 ARTIST IN MARCH 2010\n\nAl Stewart\n\nWith the release of Uncorked, Al Stewart (“Year of the Cat” and “Time Passages”) and musical partner Dave Nachmanoff take a trip through Stewart’s musical back pages, both in terms of the musical catalogue (they did have nearly 20 albums’ worth of songs to pick from), and in terms of performance style. After all, Al made his bones in the massively fertile folk scene that was London in the late ’60s, and he numbers among his contemporaries the likes of guitar wizards Bert Jansch and John Renbourn, singer-songwriters Roy (“Hats Off To”) Harper and Richard Thompson, and a former flatmate named Paul Simon, who went on to some celebrity upon returning to America.\n\nRecorded live during a springtime East Coast swing, Uncorked is the first live acoustic disc Al’s done since 1992’s Rhymes In Rooms, and both he and Nachmanoff made a conscious decision not to replicate any of the tracks from that disc, even if it meant leaving off such standards as “On the Border” and the two aforementioned Top 40 hits. As a consequence, it sounds like the duo isn’t merely playing well (fact is, Al’s guitar work is actually even better now than it was back in the day, thanks to the acoustic touring configuration that brings his musical contributions more to the fore), it sounds like they’re having fun."
