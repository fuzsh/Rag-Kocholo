The revered folk musician has an effortless talent for spinning lyrics that quietly cut deep, and crafting melodies that seamlessly ride the plot twists and turns. Wilcox handily exemplifies the power of lyrical and musical catharsis.\n\nPick any song from Wilcox’s new acoustic album, My Good Friends, and you will find yourself instantly immersed. Sometimes you’ll see yourself in the lyrics, other times you’ll marvel at the four-minute mini-movie. My Good Friends is a stripped-down, acoustic collection of ten songs, a fan-requested creative respite for Wilcox as he also continues to work on a full band album coming in 2024.\n\nOf special note on the new recording is “Jolt,” with its jittery rhythm playing perfect backdrop to lyrics about today’s obsession with online fear mongering and internet disinformation. The title track is a folk-blues number about living a life filled with close calls and surviving them all. Then there’s a trio of story songs – “Dead Man’s Phone,” “This Is How It Ends,” and “Lost Man” – that are as cinematic as they are charismatic. Wilcox says those last three songs “create a whole movie in my imagination.”\n\nIn fact, the way Wilcox feels about every tune on My Good Friends proves this is indeed a fan-requested labor of love. “I am grateful for the community that sustains me – my good friends,” he says. “These are the kind of friends that get you through difficult times. The kind of friends that you go to for a fresh perspective when the future looks grim. These songs grew out of conversations with friends, and they hold ideas that I like to have around.”\n\nSuch dedication to honoring personal and heartfelt music has been the backbone of David Wilcox’s entire career. The Ohio native with the warm baritone found his artistic muse in North Carolina during the mid-1980s. In 1987, he released his debut album, The Nightshift Watchman, which led to winning the prestigious Kerrville Folk Festival in 1988. That translated to a four-album stint with A&M Records starting with 1989’s How Did You Find Me Here, which sold 100,000 copies by word of mouth. Thirty-plus years and twenty-plus albums later, Wilcox won top honors in the 23rd annual USA Songwriting Competition in 2018 for his effervescent “We Make the Way by Walking” from his last album release, The View From the Edge. Wilcox has deservedly earned praise over the years in The New York Times, The Boston Globe, The Los Angeles Times, and Rolling Stone, to name a few. He also has a dedicated and vocal core of fans who regularly write to thank him for his work and the impact his songs have had on their lives.\n\nToday, Wilcox is still earning his admirers with storytelling that cuts deep into the soul and observes the human condition from both the nerve center and the outside looking in. That kind of storytelling is certain to become a good friend.\n\nPlease note: All ticket sales are final.

Her songs serve as postcards from an artist brave enough to take the road less traveled. Reardon dove head first into music at the young age of 15, and has spent much of the past decade writing, recording and performing music around the world.\n\nRaised in a coastal Massachusetts town north of Boston, Reardon spent three years based in Nashville and much of the past six years carrying her songs and stories all over the globe — including a six-month artist-in-residency stay in Dachau, Germany — gathering experiences, inspiration and soulful connections. Her ever-deepening music carries a lyrical and melodic weight beyond her years, being described as “brilliantly moving folk/pop with a lyrical depth and soul” and “a melancholy little masterpiece.” No Depression writes “Reardon is truly a treasure.”\n\nHer latest release, Changes, is the continuation of a journey that began with Reardon’s 2022 release In the Good Light. Both projects were recorded in Barcelona with Catalan collaborators Pau Figueres (producer and one of Spain’s premiere instrumentalists) and Aniol Bestit Collellimir (recording engineer). The title track on Changes features an original, bilingual duet with Catalan sensation Judit Neddermann, with whom Reardon formed a deep musical bond during her time in Barcelona and who appears on the EP courtesy of Universal Music Spain.\n\n“The journey to making In the Good Light taught me that soul family exists in the most unexpected places,” says Reardon. “Changes feels very much like it’s sister project — the two EPs mirror and complete each other in a way that I couldn’t have anticipated without all the life that happened in between them.”\n\nFor Reardon, this new collection of songs represents a sense of grounding and coming home to herself after a period of intense self-discovery. “I’ve just absorbed so much, so fast” she says, \"new experiences in both life and music, exposure to different cultures and ways of being, new friendships, new joy and new pain. All while coming into my own as a woman during a particularly complicated time on earth.”\n\nReardon’s songs have found a home on Spotify Editorial Playlists like Fresh Folk, Folk Pop, Morning Coffee and Today’s Singer/Songwriters, as well as Apple Music’s Acoustic Chill and New in Singer/Songwriter. She totes over 5.5 million streams on Apple Music alone and has shared the stage with renowned artists including Lori McKenna, Rodney Crowell and Anaïs Mitchell, among others.\n\nPlease note: All ticket sales are final.

Others chronicle their times. It’s a rare artist who can do both, telling their own story through songs that also encapsulate the essence of people and places who have helped define their era overall. Woody Guthrie, Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen all come to mind. Yet few songwriters can relate their own life to the life experienced by others who find that common bond — the exhilaration of the open road, the celebration of heroes, the coming of age, the hope for redemption, the sharing of love, intimate, passionate and enduring — the way that Ellis Paul does.\n\nSmart. Literate. Poetic. Singular. Storyteller. Folksinger. Yes, but Ellis Paul is far more. How much more? An incredible 30-year career. 15 Boston Music Awards. 20 albums. Newport Folk Festival. Carnegie Hall. Hundreds of venues from Alaska to Miami, Paris, and London. Dozens of compilations, commercials, documentaries, TV shows, and blockbuster movie soundtracks. He is one of the finest singer/songwriters of his generation — for many, the face of contemporary folk music — and probably no artist on the acoustic music scene is better loved by fans, or more respected by his contemporaries than Ellis Paul.\n\nPlease note: All ticket sales are final.

Back in 2012 he had a mission: play rock and roll holiday songs for the children he was delivering the toys to. So he called his old friend Jon Svetkey and asked if he could put a band together. Jon made a few calls and a yearly tradition was born. The band includes Tom and Jon, Everett Pendleton on guitar, Heather Quay & Lyn O'Conor-Ferguson on vocals, Rob Laurens on keyboards, Jason Redi on bass, Jeff Isen on percussion, trombone, harmonica and more!\n\nAll donations from the concert will go to the Maher Family Toy Drive and will help families spending their holidays at Children's.

I have had this reaction once in the last 10 years and that was\n\nthe first time I heard Patty Griffin.\" - former Rolling Stone music editor and Springsteen biographer, Dave Marsh\n\nOriginally born in Germany and transplanted to the US as a young teen, Antje Duvekot began\n\nto hone her observational skills through a lens of biculturalism when she picked up a guitar\n\nduring that move. Some years later, the confessional folk of Dar Williams and Ani DiFranco\n\ngave her license to share her observations, no matter how personal, in her first emerging\n\nsongs. She has never let go of that tenet of vulnerability.\n\n\"Duvekot has gotten hotter, faster than any local songwriter in recent memory. Her songs feel\n\nat once fresh faced and firmly rooted, driven by the whispery sensuality of her voice. She\n\nbelieves in the redemptive power of the shared secret; and is utterly unafraid to mine the\n\ndarkest corners of her life for songs that turn fear into resilience and isolation into community.”\n\n- The Boston Globe\n\n\"When I first heard Antje I knew I was witnessing something very special. She creates an entire,\n\ndetailed world in verse, and takes you there with beautiful and understated melody. Her songs\n\nare stunning paintings of color and shade and always generate the heat and light that real art\n\nshould. In an unpoetic and 'in your face' world, she is lyrical and subtle.” - Neil Dorfsman,\n\nproducer of Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen and Sting\n\nAntje’s four studio albums, including her latest, “Toward The Thunder”, were produced by\n\nSeamus Egan of SOLAS, Richard Shindell, and Scott Petito, respectively, and feature support\n\nfrom Anais Mitchell, John Gorka, Lucy Kaplansky, Sean Mullins, Liz Longley, Mark Erelli, and\n\nKris Delmhorst, among others.\n\n\"What a blessing to have worked with someone as talented as Antje. With a voice like hers,\n\nand songs as good as these, a producer just tries to get out of the way, to do no harm, and to\n\nlet the artist speak for herself.\" - Richard Shindell\n\nAntje has extensive touring experience. She is a compelling live performer and has been invited\n\nto play top festivals, such as the Newport Folk Festival, Mountain Stage, Philadelphia, and\n\nKerrville Festivals and others. Internationally, she's headlined the Celtic Connections Festival in\n\nScotland and the Tonder Festival in Denmark. Antje has won some of the top songwriting\n\nawards, including the Grand Prize in the John Lennon Songwriting Competition and the \"Best\n\nNew Folk Award\" at Kerrville. In one of the nation's top music markets, she won the Boston\n\nMusic Award for \"Outstanding Folk Act\". She has appeared on various NPR programs. In 2007,\n\nThe Bank of America featured Antje's song \"Merry Go Round\" in a national TV advertising\n\ncampaign seen by millions, including a Super Bowl audience. In 2010, Antje played the\n\nTEDMED conference in San Diego (among the unveiling of Ozzie Osbourne's genome).\n\nAccording to CNN: \"Then, this morning, the tone of the conference turned from intellectual to\n\ndeeply emotional when Antje Duvekot got up with her guitar and sang about her grandmother’s\n\ndescent into Alzheimer's disease. Twitter revealed that I wasn't the only one who was holding\n\nback tears - Duvekot's song was all too relatable for those of us who have watched loved ones\n\nslip away. 'And Anna tries to form a thought / But at the end she's forgotten where she started\n\nfrom / There's something she would like to say / But the words in her head seem to have got\n\naway' she sang”.\n\nIn addition to music, Antje also works as an animator (having created music videos for Toad\n\nThe Wet Sprocket, Dar Williams, Eliza Gilkyson, Martyn Joseph, Eliot Bronson and Lori\n\nMcKenna) and she leads a yearly fan volunteer trip to Guatemala. She also occasionally serves\n\nas Music Ambassador on humanitarian projects run by Let Yourself Trust, the non-profit\n\norganization of fellow singer-songwriter Martyn Joseph.\n\nPlease note: All ticket sales are final.

Catie Curtis pulls the walls down.” - Mary Chapin Carpenter, Grammy Award winning singer/songwriter.\n\nFor over 25 years, Catie toured full-time in the US and Europe, releasing 14 recordings and selling over 250,000 CDs (not to mention streaming and downloads). She has recorded for major (EMI Guardian) and independent (Rykodisc, Vanguard and Compass) labels, collaborating with some of the finest musicians and producers in the country.

Her songs have been featured in films and tv shows, and she performed several times at the White House during the Obama administration. She’s intensely grateful for those years and honored to know that her music has been an integral part of so many people's lives.\n\nIn 2017, Catie left the road and began training to become a therapist. She is now in private practice as an LMFT with an office in Newton, MA. She seeks a balance between her work as a therapist and an artist. “I still need and want to create music. Writing is still how I make sense of my life and the world around me. I still love getting out to play shows and connect with people.” Fortunately, it’s important to her fans, too. With financial support from fans (through Patreon) Catie has written dozens of songs over the past couple of years, eleven of which appear on her new album The Raft.\n\nBUY TICKETS HERE\n\nABOUT HANNEKE CASSEL\n\nEffervescent and engaging, Boston-based fiddler Hanneke Cassel is a performer, teacher and composer whose career spans over two decades. Her style fuses influences from the Isle of Skye and Cape Breton Island with Americana grooves and musical innovations, creating a cutting-edge acoustic sound that retains the integrity and spirit of the Scottish tradition. Hanneke’s music is a blend of the contemporary and traditional, described by the Boston Globe as “exuberant and rhythmic, somehow wild and innocent, delivered with captivating melodic clarity and an irresistible playfulness.”\n\nA native of Port Orford, Oregon, Hanneke started out as a Texas-style fiddler and went on to win the 1997 U.S. National Scottish Fiddle Championship, which awarded her the opportunity to study with Alasdair Fraser and introduced her to fiddle camps and the folk community -- both of which continue to play an integral role in her life. Hanneke teaches regularly at Fraser’s Valley of the Moon and Sierra Fiddle Camps, the Mike Block String Camp (run by her husband, acclaimed cellist Mike Block), Harald Haugaard’s International Fiddle School, and the West Denmark Fiddle School. She has served as a guest instructor in the American Roots department at Berklee College of Music, where she received her Bachelor’s of Music in Violin Performance.\n\nHanneke is a sought-after performer who has graced stages across North America, Europe, Australia, India, and China. She has been featured at Celtic Connections (Glasgow, Scotland), KVMR Celtic Fest (Grass Valley, USA), Milwaukee Irish Fest (Milwaukee, USA), Celtic Colours (Cape Breton, Canada), WGBH Christmas Celtic Sojourn (Boston, USA) and the National Celtic Festival (Port Arlington, Australia).

Jenna Moynihan is regarded as one of the best in the new generation of fiddle players. Versatile and inventive, her fiddling style draws strongly from the Scottish tradition, but is in no way bound by it. A graduate of Berklee College of Music, Jenna performs as part of a duo with cutting edge harpist Mairi Chaimbeul and is the regular fiddler for the Seamus Egan Project. Newfoundland-born guitarist Keith Murphy began absorbing his native musical languages – folksongs, ballads and dance music – from an early age. A proficient multi-instrumentalist, he has long applied considerable energy to the rhythmic side of music, becoming a valued band member and highly sought-after sideman on guitar, mandolin and foot percussion. Together, the Hanneke Cassel Band creates a cutting-edge acoustic sound that retains the integrity and spirit of the Scottish tradition.\n\nPlease note: All ticket sales are final. No refunds."
