        "text": "Johnny Cash calls Marty Stuart's new country concept album, The Pilgrim, \". . .a fabulous journey.\" Actor/hillbilly personality Billy Bob Thornton calls it \". . .perfect. I can't quit playing it. I wish critics weren't allowed to listen to it.\" Old Billy Bob certainly won't get his wish, but I can't disagree with him or Johnny Cash. On his 12th album in 21 years, Marty Stuart reaches the creative career height that usually occurs to only the most talented and legendary of musicians in rock music. No country artist has put out a record this good in years.\n\nIn the impressive press kit sent along with the album, Marty tells the story and inspiration behind The Pilgrim. It's about a cross-eyed man named Norman whom Stuart knew growing up. Norman lost his beauty queen wife to a home wrecking man they all called The Pilgrim. Norman's despair led to a self-inflicted gun shot wound to the head and then a hole in the ground. The Pilgrim was run out of town and made his life on the rails, which eventually brought him back to the arms of Rita, the woman he loved.\n\nStuart saw more than just a heartbreaking tale of love and jealousy in that story, and he was inspired to craft a sort of country opera, replete with characters, intermission and an all-star cast. In the end, Stuart's The Pilgrim evolved to include a tribute to country legend Bill Monroe, a dear friend and mentor of his. Over the course of three years, Stuart penned and recorded The Pilgrim from one end of the country to the other. The end result is a collection of full-length songs, snippets that pays homage to the roots of country, and shines a beacon down the rails as to where country is headed.\n\nA slow moving choo-choo train churns along for 25 seconds in the opening \"Intro\" to lead into \"Sometimes The Pleasure's Worth The Pain,\" a rollicking, twangy guitar song that reminds me of why I've long thought of Marty Stuart as one of the coolest country musicians in the world. This guy sings from the gut and from the heart, without copping the modern country-nasal-droning and falling into the tired cliches of tight jeans, black western hats and half-assed dedication to the origins of country.\n\nI wish \"The Pilgrim Act I\" was longer than the short 54 seconds of stark beauty that it is. Emmylou Harris' piercing, soaring vocal, and the lullaby orchestral backing, sets up the concept of the album and flows right into \"Harlan County.\" Ralph Stanley of The Clinch Mountain Boys adds a touch of down home bluegrass flavor along with a crying fiddle. The sweet vintage voice of Pam Tillis sounds perfect alongside Stuart's voice in \"Reasons,\" inspired by Norman's guilt-riddled suicide note. It ends on the bitter lines \"I didn't know that she was married/ That part she didn't tell/ Forget this town/ Ain't hanging round/ Love can go to hell.\"\n\n\"Red, Red Wine And Cheatin' Songs\" skips in like the perfect \"cry in your beer\" love-gone-wrong song. Smooth vocal harmony and a two-stepping beat sounds just like somebody would sound if they had just found out that the one they love is married. I can almost smell the greasy food frying and taste the cigarette smoke in the air in \"Truckstop.\" George Jones lends his uniquely sad Southern voice with Emmylou Harris playing the part of the angelic truckstop waitress consoling road weary George. Perhaps the prettiest song on The Pilgrim is \"Hobo's Prayer,\" which features Stuart's deep soothing voice singing about life \"under bridges, beneath trestles in the boxcars of dead trains. . .trading sorrows for tomorrows/ That's the hobo's prayer.\"\n\nWritten in Maui, \"The Observations Of A Crow\" sounds like it was inspired in the back alleys and bar rooms of Nashville. Stuart's mysterious words, guitar picking and somber singing style is just the authentic touch needed in country music as it line dances into the next millennium. The first \"Intermission\" flies by like an old fashioned Southern foot-stomping hoe down, only to be caught by the beautiful mandolin strains of \"The Greatest Love Of All Time,\" with hurting lyrics like \"And it's sad but true, that girl me and you/ Had the greatest love of all time.\"\n\nWith its hard driving beat and semi-rock riffs, \"Draggin' Around These Chains Of Love\" is exactly the reason why I've always liked Marty Stuart. I've never bought a single album or seen him in concert, but every time I saw him on The Nashville Network, I'd stop and listen. He has a unique ability to appeal to a wide cross section of music fans similar to the way Willie Nelson and Neil Young can. I thought I liked him because of his massive collection of rare and historic guitars, but it was always the music that kept me taking notice when he happened along.\n\nStuart's incredible song writing talent comes through even stronger on the brief \"The Pilgrim Act II\" and \"Redemption,\" but it is the touching tribute to Bill Monroe in \"Act III\" of The Pilgrim that is the stellar moment that brings the whole album together. As if giving Monroe a grand poetic send off to the grandness of Heaven, Stuart sings \"As I stand before that valley wide/ It will lead me to the other side. . .I might be tired and weary, but I am strong/ Cause pilgrims walk, but not alone.\" Johnny Cash - The Man in Black - makes his cameo appearance in \"Outro,\" with a booming, dead serious reading of \"Sir Galahad\" by Alfred Lord Tennyson, only to fade out to a faint train whistle and ending on the romping instrumental \"Mr. John Henry, Steel Driving Man.\"\n\nThe Pilgrim is required listening from the first song to the last. Taken individually, each song would seem out of place on a modern country album, but as one cohesive album, The Pilgrim is a wistful throwback to country's past and a promising glimpse of Marty Stuart's staying power and influence. [4-1/2 Stars]\n\nBy Carl Cunningham\n\nTheir love affair was intense, sizzling with romance and passion. She wore no ring. He did not know she was married until a horrible tragedy shocked him into the realization. It left him empty and depressed so he took up the life of a hobo, heading west on a long, booze-fueled pilgrimage that he planned to end by leaping into the Pacific Ocean. Finally, he found himself at the ocean's edge, facing the ultimate decision.\n\nThat's the basic story line of The Pilgrim, the gritty and ambitious new CD from country singer/songwriter/guitarist Marty Stuart. \"Thought provoking\" is not a term that applies to many of the songs being released out of Nashville these days. In a time when few country artists are willing to take risks beyond singing about trucks and beer, Stuart's new effort is a real standout.\n\nStuart dares to be different in this 20-song concept album, which features some first-rate guest appearances by Emmylou Harris, George Jones, Johnny Cash, Pam Tillis and Ralph Stanley.\n\nStuart said in a press statement that the project started with \"The Pilgrim,\" a song about the journey of life he wrote shortly after the death of his friend and mentor, bluegrass legend Bill Monroe, in 1996. \"For a year and a half, it was the only song I had to show for this project,\" Stuart said. \"As it turns out, I wrote the last song first and had to work my way backwards from there. 'The Pilgrim' started out as a song, then it grew up and became a story.\"\n\nThe songs tell the story of a man who, in Stuart's words, \"is thoroughly on the lam, running wide-open drunk , totally lost and one breath away from letting the devil have his soul.\" The journey takes him to cruddy bars, diners, rail cars, hobo camps and, ultimately, to redemption.\n\nI like every song on it, but the standouts include the acoustic guitar number \"Hobo's Prayer,\" the edgy \"Goin' Nowhere Fast,\" and \"Truck Stop,\" featuring Jones and Harris. Stanley and his Clinch Mountain Boys pour heartache into \"Harlan County,\" which recounts the events leading up to the tragedy that inspires the pilgrim's journey.\n\nSome might compare this effort to Red Headed Stranger, the all-time classic from Willie Nelson, another fictional journey, released in the early 1970s. Stuart would probably appreciate the comparison, although this work sounds very fresh and new.\n\nOne of the best features of the disc is Stuart's virtuoso work on guitar and mandolin. The man who traveled for years as part of Cash's road band knows and respects the art of country guitar picking. He's a collector of historic guitars and the instruments used in making this album include guitars formerly played by Cash, Hank Williams, Monroe and the late Byrds member Clarence White. One of the guitars used here was played by Wayne Moss on Roy Orbison's classic \"Pretty Woman.\"\n\nAs I prepare to move on to other challenges after a very enjoyable 15 years as Gusto's country music reviewer, it's reviews like this that I will really miss writing. Stuart hasn't made much of a commercial ripple in recent years. This time, he's rolling the dice, daring to be different and I hope The Pilgrim is a huge success for him. Rating: 5 Stars\n\nBy Dan Herbeck\n\nMaybe it's just coincidence, maybe it's a pre-millennial omen, but 1999 has now witnessed the release of two \"albums-that-tell-a-story\" in the world of country music that stand out not only as among the best recordings of the year, but of the last decade.\n\nTom Russell's epic The Man From God Knows Where has been garnering well-deserved praise from all corners of the folk and country worlds since its release earlier in the year, but then Russell has long been known as a consummate singer and storyteller. Marty Stuart may be more widely known for his years as a Nashville stalwart, but The Pilgrim is every bit as powerfully written and performed.\n\nWhen Stuart's career is looked back on many years into the next century (and at age 40, he presumably has more than a few miles left in the tank), The Pilgrim will be regarded as a milestone -- not only in his own career, but in the country music business as a whole. It's simply a phenomenal musical statement.\n\nBased on what Stuart tells us is a true story from his childhood in Mississippi, The Pilgrim recounts the tragedy, fall from grace, and redemption of a man who falls in love with the right woman at the wrong time, but to anyone familiar with Stuart's career, there's a lot of metaphor that reflects his own life as well.\n\nIt's been a quarter-century and more now since the barely teenage Stuart climbed aboard Lester Flatt's bus to become a professional musician, and he's lived the whole country music spectrum, from bluegrass to rockabilly, in the years since. The Pilgrim tells that story, too, and it took three years to bring the record to completion, spurred by the passing of another mentor and father-figure, the late Bill Monroe. The track count reaches 20, but in reality, it's one single cut that flows seamlessly from one part of the story to the next, echoing high-lonesome bluegrass one moment, honky-tonk roadhouses and passing trains the next.\n\nWritten almost entirely by Stuart, his showpiece songs (\"Reasons,\" \"The Observations of a Crow,\" \"Hobo's Prayer,\" to name a few) are bridged by shorter interludes featuring a sterling guest cast: Johnny Cash, Ralph Stanley, George Jones, Earl Scruggs, Pam Tillis, Josh Graves, and Emmylou Harris (whose own \"story\" album, 1985's The Ballad of Sally Rose was itself a classic of the genre).\n\nA great many Nashville careers have fallen prey to the \"album a year\" grind, but The Pilgrim stands as a classic example of what can be achieved when a superlative talent like Marty Stuart is given free rein and time to do more than feed the radio and video beasts.\n\nBy John Lupton\n\nCountry traditionalist and ace guitar player Marty Stuart stretches on his twelfth release, The Pilgrim, a 20-track slice of country and Americana.\n\nAccording to Stuart, The Pilgrim is a based on a true story of love lost and requited. I confess: I can't easily trace the story in the lyrics, and needed the well-written press materials to understand the album. (Like The Man From God Knows Where by Tom Russell, the press materials are an essential addition to the album, and are an essential addition to the liner notes.)\n\nStuart says the album took three years to complete, beginning with a session in Memphis at the home of famed Sun Records. Explains Stuart, \"That place is always ground zero for me. When I'm looking for a new groove I go to Memphis. It has soul and it offers a musical freedom that can't be found anywhere else.\"\n\nThe album contains a variety of styles: drinking songs (\"Sometimes the Pleasure's Worth the Pain\"), black hat country (\"Hobo's Prayer\"), and Kansas City rockabilly (\"Going Nowhere Fast\").\n\nGuest players include Ralph Stanley and Emmylou Harris on the outstanding track, \"Truck Stop,\" as well as Pam Tillis and Earl Scruggs.\n\nStuart's recording efforts also took him to California, where he recorded with guitarist Mike Campbell from Tom Petty's band. Explains Stuart, \"I flew out to California with the specific purpose of writing a jukebox anthem with him. 'Draggin' Around These Chains of Love' is what we came up with.\"\n\nStuart continues: \"I live the outer edge of country music. It's amazing the people you bump into out there . . . dreams do come true. I fell in love with country music when I was five years old by way of two albums: The Fabulous Johnny Cash and Flatt & Scruggs' Greatest Hits. My dream was to meet them. I got to. It turns out that the only two steady jobs I've had since 1972 were with Lester Flatt and Johnny Cash.\"\n\nThe album constantly changes gears, as the flashy country instrumental pop of \"Outro\" segues into a spoken-word piece by Johnny Cash, followed by \"Mr. John Henry, Steel Drivin' Man,\" a bluegrass duet with Earl Scruggs.\n\nThe Pilgrim forges brave territory for a Nashville release. Ranging far from the safe confines of country sound, the new album will both frustrate and attract fans (I think the album would get a better reception if listeners had access to the complete background information). Take a sojourn with The Pilgrim.\n\nIf ever a concept album lent itself to a visual, The Pilgrim is it. It could easily provide the aural magic for a stage production, or perhaps the soundtrack to a film. As a country album, however, the listener might find it a bit murky to comprehend, even knowing the threads of the tale.\n\nIn the liner notes, Stuart explains that his current album -- which was three years in the making -- is based on a true story from his hometown, about a man named Norman who unwittingly gets caught in a tragic love triangle, with dire consequences. As a result, he becomes a \"pilgrim,\" living a self-destructive life and wandering the country in search of redemption. In the throes of a dream at his mother's grave, he is finally able to reconcile with himself. He returns to the woman, they marry and raise a family.\n\nSounds simple enough, but this 20-part song cycle is an ambitious musical odyssey considering the present climate in country music. This is not a disc that can be casually enjoyed (which was probably Stuart's intention); the listener must engage 100 percent of his or her thought processes to follow the journey. The various styles of country music run the gamut from country rock to traditional country to bluegrass to honky tonk, which is represented in the first single, \"Red, Red Wine and Cheatin' Songs.\" There are also several instrumental interludes, seguing the story's \"acts.\" The transitions are not always smooth and sometimes downright confusing. The fine instrumental bluegrass finale, \"Mr. John Henry, Steel Driving Man,\" is just sort of tagged on and doesn't serve to provide resolution to the story.\n\nIt does have moments of haunting beauty, as in Emmylou Harris' rendition of the first verse of \"The Pilgrim.\" Johnny Cash's reading of an excerpt from Alfred Lord Tennyson's \"Sir Galahad\" is mesmerizing. Also, \"The Observations of a Crow\" is a work of songwriting genius beginning with a spoken word narrative by Stuart. (The song brings to mind similar efforts by Robbie Robertson and Leonard Cohen.) Told from the perspective of a crow, it's one of those songs that rolls eerily around in your subconscious mind for awhile.\n\n\"Hobo's Prayer\" is a fine narrative song, and \"Truckstop,\" which is graced by the legendary presence of George Jones, with Harris portraying the all-knowing truckstop waitress, is another high point. The rockin' \"Draggin' Around These Chains of Love\" has a memorable guest appearance by guitarist Mike Campbell of Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers fame. Bluegrass legend Ralph Stanley lends not only his voice to the project, but the stellar musicianship of the Clinch Mountain Boys. Pam Tillis contributes her traditional country vocal sensibilities to several tracks. Earl Scruggs, Dobro player Josh Graves and fiddler Stuart Duncan are some of the fine musicians appearing on the project.\n\nThe Pilgrim is a radical departure from the current trend in \"feel good\" pop/country albums -- an attempt by Stuart to return to a reverence for the tradition of story-telling in country that has been absent as of late. Although a sincere effort, there are too many musical textures vying for the listener's attention.\n\nBy Michelle Nikolai\n\nMarty Stuart is country music's consummate multitasker (what we used to call a Renaissance man): a singer, songwriter, super-picker, antiquarian, photographer, essayist, fashion and honky-tonk bon vivant. He grew up a prodigy tutored by Bill Monroe, Earl Scruggs and other greats -- none of it was lost on him. He has absorbed and cultivated every strain of music that ever stirred a hillbilly soul. And now, all that teaching and experience has been poured into The Pilgrim, a record that transcends anything he's ever done and that promises to be on of Music Row's strongest releases this year.\n\nIt sounds pretentious to call The Pilgrim a country/rock opera, but it fits the billing. Like the Who's Quadrophenia or Tom Russell's recent The Man From God Knows Where, the record takes its substance and shape from a narrative. The story, told in scraps and fragments, is of a love triangle that played out in Stuart's hometown. A man, the Pilgrim falls in love with a woman, not knowing she has an estranged husband. The husband confronts them and then kills himself. The Pilgrim wanders, seeking solace, and finally returns to make the original love work.\n\nOf the 20 tracks, nine are songs that would either stand apart as strong singles or together as a fine album in their own right. We hear Stuart's mastery of honky-tonk on \"Red, Red Wine and Cheatin' Songs\" and \"Goin' Nowhere Fast.\" He dives into classic hillbilly rock with \"Sometimes The Pleasure's Worth The Pain\" and \"Draggin' Around These Chains Of Love.\" The uncategorizable \"Observations Of A Crow\" is just a wonderful song that proves Stuart isn't hamstrung by conventions.\n\nThe CD's 11 other mini-cuts tie the project together and lend it texture. These interludes include the voices of Emmylou Harris, George Jones, and Johnny Cash reading Tennyson, if you can imagine such riches. A short song that Stuart wrote especially for Ralph Stanley relating the husband's suicide sounds a thousand years old. Elsewhere, Beatles-like instrumental flourishes and the ambient sound of birdsong give The Pilgrim flair and soul.\n\nBut Stuart didn't get so caught up in the elaborate production that he forgot to pick. He brings in a dozen or so of the staggering guitars and mandolins from his collection and gets them up close to the mike. The mandolin work on the title cut is a tour de force. And the final cut, a mando/banjo duet with Earl Scruggs on \"John Henry,\" is like dessert.\n\nStuart is a good, but not a great, songwriter. He borrows classic country conventions (the train in the distance, the road home) gracefully, but so often that it doesn't always leave him enough space to turn innovative phrases himself.\n\nBut, you know, who cares? This kind of commitment to creativity and the music's heritage should be more common in Nashville's mainstream.\n\nBy Craig Havigurst\n\nHe cut his teeth in the bands of Lester Flatt and Johnny Cash. He's on his third term as president of that venerable institution, the Country Music Foundation. He's even married to a venerable country music institution, Connie Smith (having previously wed Cash's daughter Cindy). Marty Stuart is a pillar of the Nashville community, a well-connected, all-round nice guy. But what has he actually given us musically?\n\nUntil now, I'd have said not a lot, beyond a few catchy but lightweight ditties like \"Tempted.\" With this ambitious and accomplished concept album, however, Stuart proves his worth.\n\nThe Pilgrim is based on the true story of some people from Stuart's hometown. The title character falls in love with a woman he doesn't know is married. The jealous husband confronts them and publicly kills himself. The pilgrim flees the scandal on a soul-searching journey through America's honky tonks and hobo jungles before eventually returning to marry the woman he loves.\n\nThis is perfect subject matter for country music and, fortunately, the narrative is suggested, rather than explicitly described, by a series of very different tracks that, on repeated listens, don't give the impression of watching the same movie over and over.\n\nThere are several reprises, sound effects, links lasting a minute or so and even a musical intermission. But Stuart dodges a traditional pitfall of the concept album by including several tracks that would easily stand alone as radio singles.\n\nFirst extraction, \"Red, Red Wine and Cheatin' Songs,\" is a case in point. A stomping honky tonk belter in the style of the standard \"Dim Lights, Thick Smoke and Loud, Loud Music.\" If that proves too country, another chart contender must be \"Sometimes The Pleasure's Worth The Pain\" which echoes the Roy Orbison-meets-Phil Spector sound of Stuart's 1991 success, \"Tempted.\"\n\nOther potential hits include the Traveling Wilbury's-style rocker, \"Draggin' Around These Chains Of Love,\" the quirky but striking blues song, \"The Observations of a Crow,\" the foot-to-the-floor country rock of \"Goin' Nowhere Fast\" and, if country radio will let in a little country music, the very retro\" \"Reasons\" on which Pam Tillis sings harmony.\n\nBeyond likely singles, the album offers plenty of traditional country and bluegrass flavors, with the added interest of guest appearances by Johnny Cash, George Jones, Ralph Stanley, Earl Scruggs and, of course, Emmylou Harris (if someone hung up a fly paper, Emmy'd want to be on it).\n\nGiven the story-telling nature of country music, it's a wonder we're not knee deep in concept albums. In fact, the somewhat maligned format is virtually extinct. The Pilgrim proves there is much to be discovered beyond the confines of the three-minute single. It deserves to succeed and encourage others in country music to try a larger canvas. With multi-media CDs, there's a whole new frontier to be explored.\n\nAt the very least, The Pilgrim is the best thing Marty Stuart has done, by far. [Four Stars]\n\nBy Douglas McPherson\n\nLast year's muddled Tribute To Tradition attempted to honor country music by featuring today's hot new country artists covering traditional standards. The effort was a failure mainly because many of the chosen artists couldn't hold a candle to the performers they were called to honor. But one track, \"Same Old Train' written and compiled by Marty Stuart, was an album in a song, covering the styles and history of country music in six minutes.\n\nIt was a harbinger of things to come, as Stuart's new CD, The Pilgrim, tells an engaging story of love lost and found; the saga of Norman, Rita and The Pilgrim. In Stuart's engaging tale, Norman, the jealous and possessive husband of Rita, kills himself when he discovers his wife in the arms of The Pilgrim. The Pilgrim is an honest man who would not have fallen in love with Rita had he known she was married. His shame -- and the town gossip -- causes The Pilgrim to flee, becoming a hitchhiker and hobo as he searches for forgiveness and love. After a while, The Pilgrim realizes he truly loved Rita and his conscience is clear; after all, he really did not know she was married. Besides, he realizes she needs him as much as he needs her.\n\nThat's the basic plot, but the love and hard work that has gone into making this CD come to life is nothing short of astounding. From the very beginning, Stuart drops the listener into the history of country music, from old-time bluegrass (Ralph Stanley on \"Harlan Country\") to rockabilly (\"Sometimes The Pleasure's Worth The Pain\") to folk (\"Hobo's Prayer\") and to blues (\"The Observations Of A Crow\"). Singers involved include Emmylou Harris, George Jones, Stanley, Johnny Cash and Pam Tillis. The CD is an aural movie; close your eyes and the characters and events spring to life.\n\nBut in many ways, Marty Stuart is The Pilgrim. He began as a youngster picking for Lester Flatt and moved from old-time country to rockabilly and outlaw music with Johnny Cash. He's scored with rockabilly styles and honky-tonk music and still picks a mean mandolin on old-time gospel tunes. He's been on the road living the life of a superstar yet he's returned to his roots, realizing that country music needs him as much as he needs country music. Unlike many of today's artists, he's spent his life exploring all the facets of country music, making pilgrimages to Memphis, A.P. Carter's home and many roadside honky-tonks in an effort to absorb and honor the history. Three years in the making, The Pilgrim is the most significant country music CD to be released in the last five years. Buy it and \"Honor Thy Music.\" A+\n\nBy Michael Clark\n\nI've listened to this CD dozens, maybe even hundreds of times since it was released, and the quality of the songwriting and performances continues to knock me out. It's unfathomable that a record this great resulted in Marty's being dropped by MCA. Their loss, and ours too.\n\nBy Amy Haugesag\n\nMarty Stuart has been discovered by the Americana/No Depression audience, thanks to his new album, The Pilgrim (MCA). If you hear a tiny sour note there, I'm sorry -- but not too sorry; Stuart's been around a long time, and it's hard to see why he hasn't been made much of before. The Pilgrim is far from his first album -- he debuted as a solo artist more than 20 years ago, and he'd been recording for a half decade before that with Lester Flatt's Nashville Grass -- and it's not even his first concept album; that would be 1992's This One's Gonna Hurt You, with its country then-and-now conceit. So what's different? Well, aside from the music -- which I will, I promise, get to any minute now -- it's largely the marketing; while Stuart's always produced good stuff (and done good things; he's in his third term as president of the Country Music Foundation) and remains a presence on TNN, he's just about disappeared from mainstream country radio; gone are the days of the wildly successful chart life he enjoyed in the early part of the '90s.\n\nHence the decision to target the alt-country scene with The Pilgrim's marketing, and if it helps him build his audience, more power to him. Besides, the music on the album is mighty fine. There's a story line of sorts -- a man falls in love with a woman he believes to be unattached, and when her husband shows up and kills himself before their eyes, he flees, wandering the country before experiencing a spiritual revelation that sends him back home to find her and marry -- but the full-length songs stand up quite nicely all by themselves. The interspersed themes and transitions feel natural and unforced, what with guests like George Jones, Ralph Stanley and his band, Earl Scruggs, Johnny Cash and Emmylou Harris adding their two bits. Though Marty's got country roots a lot of folks can only dream about, and puts them to good use here, there's a reason his band is called the Rock & Roll Cowboys, especially when he gets a good Waylon Jennings-ish groove going on numbers like \"Sometimes the Pleasure's Worth the Pain.\" Yeah, it's kind of unfortunate that Stuart's paid a hipness price for his commercial success in the past, but even so, The Pilgrim is his best and most fully realized album yet.\n\nBy Jon Weisberger\n\nMartys last release on MCA, in 1999, was an ambitious concept album telling a story, inspired by a true story of passion, death and undyin love which took place in his Mississippi home town. He wrote all the songs, with occasional co-writers, and produced the album, with Tony Brown acting as Executive Producer. There are 20 tracks in all, but just under half are full length songs, with several instrumentals and some half-length numbers. Marty plays both the title role, of a man who unknowingly falls in love with a married woman, and the cuckolded husband who commits suicide. Possibly using a different singer to play one or other of the roles would have made the story clearer.\n\nIt opens with the whistle and chugging of a steam train, seguing into discord and orchestral strings (\"Intro\"), and then launching into \"Sometimes The Pleasures Worth The Pain,\" a loud country rock chugger not too far removed from Martys hits, which he wrote with Gary Nicholson and might have been a hit single. It is not quite clear whether this is the voice of the cuckolded husband or the unwitting adulterer.\n\nEmmylou Harris swoops in to sing the anguished first verse of the title track (labelled \"Act I\"), which is beautiful but feels incomplete, leading into the high lonesome bluegrass of \"Harlan County.\" This is a minute and a half of narrative telling the tale of the husbands suicide on discovering the affair. Sounding like a traditional song, the lead vocal is taken by the legendary Ralph Stanley, who is perfect for it. This in turn leads into Marty singing the husbands suicide note, the traditional country \"Reasons,\" with Pam Tillis exquisite harmony on the chorus. This is a real highlight, but for the sake of narrative clarity, it would have been more effective to use a guest vocalist on this for the husbands voice  George Jones, for instance, who is underused with half a short track.\n\nA short interlude entitled \"Love Can Go To \" provides the voice of the lover, claiming I didnt know she was married.\n\n\"Red Red Wine And Cheatin Songs,\" the only single, failed to make an impact on country radio, but is a great song, with Pam Tillis on harmony again. Once more, I am not quite sure if this is supposed to be the husband or lover whose baby went wrong (I assume the former), but it is a great honky tonker about a man taking refuge in the bottle:\n\nFor ten long years not one single drop\n\nTwelve months later I havent stopped\n\nGeorge Jones sings another narrative section, \"Truckstop,\", with Emmylou then playing the part of a waitress who encounters the lover (who we know from the liner notes has left town to escape the scandal) and labels him the pilgrim of the title.\n\nThe confessional \"Hobos Prayer\" traces the pilgrims descent into rootless wandering, continued with the more contemporary and not very interesting Goin Nowhere Fast where he realises he is making no progress. The part-spoken \"The Observations of A Crow\" is poetic, atmospheric and jazzy, but while interesting and artistically adventurous, Im not sure if I like it very much.\n\nThe steel-laced \"The Greatest Love Of All Time\" has the man looking back regretfully before a long orchestral section which is a bit too much. In the country rock \"Draggin Round These Chains Of Love,\" he is exhausted by the years trying to escape his feelings; Emmylou Harris harmonises.\n\nRalph Stanley sings a second verse (or \"Act II\") of the title track before Marty then brings us the pilgrims \"Redemption\" scene, as one night in a churchyard he surrenders to God. He then sings the six-minute long Act III of \"The Pilgrim,\" a beautifully paced confessional in which he admits,\n\nPilgrims walk, but not alone\n\nTheres been a hand to guide me along the way\n\nAnd it held me up when I went astray\n\nA recitation by Johnny Cash of lines from Tennysons \"Sir Galahad\" about finding the Holy Grail, and one sung line, lead into an instrumental version of \"Mr John Henry, Steel Driving Man\" by Marty and Earl Scruggs to end the collection.\n\nThis album was critically acclaimed, but lacked commercial appeal, and Marty subseqquently left the label. The whole is more than the sum of its parts; at times the unconventional tracking verges on the pretentious and not all the songs are particularly strong in their own right. But even if not everything pays off, the artistic ambition is laudable and the project is worth hearing.\n\nGrade: A-\n\nBy Occasional Hope\n\nFor years, Marty Stuart has been the keeper of the hillbilly flame. In a country music environment that seemingly values commercial pop over tradition, Stuart has steadfastly refused to turn his back on country's roots which, by the way, are inextricably intertwined with his own.\n\nNow, with his latest release, \"The Pilgrim,'' Stuart offers what is not only his finest career work, but one of the most inventive, exquisite compilations of musical storytelling to see the light of day in Nashville.\n\nWorking from a true story from his life experiences, Stuart assembles a small but impressive cadre of musicians (among them Emmylou Harris, Johnny Cash, Ralph Stanley, George Jones) to tell not only the story of the pilgrim but to progressively explore the history of the music.\n\nThe story is about a town misfit who marries the beauty queen but lives a life of suspicion and eventually goes to pieces and kills himself when he finds she's been keeping company with another man - the pilgrim - who didn't even know she was married. The pilgrim flees in shame and travels the country before returning to claim the woman he loved all along.\n\nStuart lets the story guide the progression of the music, from the sparse bluegrass of Stanley singing \"Harlan County'' to Cash's exclamatory closing soliloquy. The cameos - by Stanley, Cash, Harris and Jones, who delivers a vintage basso introduction to \"Truckstop'' - are truly surprising gems.\n\nBut Stuart doesn't allow the story to overshadow the music. As much of a concept as the album is, its true strength lies in the consistently superb music - Stuart's writing and his delivery.\n\nHe explores roots rock with his opening number, \"Sometimes the Pleasure's Worth the Pain,'' then shifts to pure country with \"Reasons.'' \"Red, Red Wine and Cheatin' Songs'' is pure honky tonk heaven. And that's only the beginning.\n\nDuring his journey, the pilgrim wanders in and out of songs, including one in which he comes under the watchful eye of a know-it-all crow. \"The Observations of a Crow'' is perhaps the most sublime song of this masterpiece.\n\nIn the publicity material that accompanies the album, Stuart's pal, actor Billy Bob Thornton, says: \"I wish critics weren't allowed to listen to it. This is pure, honest, beautiful art and shouldn't ever be commented on by anyone other than the kind who made it.''\n\nThornton is at least partly right. But art is meant to be appreciated, and how else can you spread the word about the best country album of the year?\n\nBy Gene Harbrecht\n\nCountry music and storytelling go together like a pair of aces, each complementing the other. Concept albums -- an entire album used to tell a story -- are far from being a new concept in country. However, in recent years, they've been all but shelved. Marty Stuart's ambitious 20-track album, The Pilgrim, revives the device.\n\nThe true story of a love triangle gone awry comes directly from Stuart's childhood acquaintance with two of the three parties involved. In short, lovely Rita married town oddball Norman (\"Sometimes The Pleasure's Worth The Pain\"), but then came to meet the man Stuart calls the pilgrim (\"The Pilgrim Act I\"). The pilgrim breaks up the marriage and Norman comments suicide (\"Harlan County,\" \"Reasons\"), leaving the two with lifelong guilty consciences. The pilgrim leaves town. The bulk of the album looks through the pilgrim's eyes as he first tries to drown the memory of Rita via booze (\"Red, Red Wine And Cheatin' Songs\"). It doesn't work. So he takes to the highway (\"Truckstop\"), and then to hopping freight trains (\"Hobo's Prayer\") to somehow put far behind a sea of troubles wrought from his own hand. No dice. He's like a \"dark horse running from the past,\" Stuart sings on the rousing \"Goin' Nowhere Fast,\" looking for something that isn't there.\n\nStuart uses a number of items throughout to best convey the pilgrim's lonesome circumstances, including trains and alcohol-and a crow. Yes, a crow, a ubiquitous country critter perched high atop humanity. With \"The Observations of a Crow,\" we see the beginnings of change in the pilgrim. The crow sees a man \"tortured by the memory of a love he thought was supposed to be.\" As if we didn't already know. Thing is, though, it starts a healing process for the pilgrim.\n\nHe takes a plaintive look back to \"The Greatest Love Of All Time,\" though not with searing pain. And though he continues \"Draggin' These Chains Of Love,\" he comes to realize through \"Redemption\" and \"The Pilgrim Act III\" that \"pilgrims walk, but not alone.\" Johnny Cash's dramatic reading of an excerpt from Lord Alfred Tennyson's \"Sir Gallahad\" completes the pilgrim's odyssey, finding the \"O just and faithful knight of God.\" An instrumental duet featuring Stuart (mandolin) and Earl Scruggs (banjo) on \"Mr. John Henry, Steel Driving Man,\" punctuates the pilgrim's restful end to a journey hard fought and won.\n\nSounds like one big ol' country song, doesn't it? Stuart's cohesive conglomerate of tales amount to a batch of descriptive marvels. Textured with layers of apple-crisp country sounds and moody atmospherics, the album stands tall as his finest by a country mile. No question about it. A+\n\nBy Tom Netherland\n\nMarty Stuart has either got the biggest balls in Nashville, at least amongst major label artists, or he's the biggest idiot. In the wake of the UniGram merger, scores of acts are being dropped for not pulling their commercial weight. So what does Marty do? He releases a 3-years-in-the-making, 20- track, one- hour LP ­ breaking the de facto 10 song, 35 minute Nashville standard ­ and to make things even stranger, he makes it a concept LP. And I'll be damned if he didn't pull it off. This is really surprising when you consider who's doing it. Marty is best known for his party hearty redneck good ol' boy persona, despite the impeccable credentials that he packs ­ he's backed Lester Flat, Doc & Merle Watson, and Johnny Cash, hitting the road when literally just a kid. He uses his road band as backing, another unheard of move in Nashville. The disc's also chockablock with guests: Johnny Cash, George Jones, Emmylou Harris, Pam Tillis, Mike Campbell, Muscle Shoals vet Barry Beckett, and Ralph Stanley And The Clinch Mountain Boys.\n\nThe CD is operatic in scope and story, and opry-atic in execution. It's full of lost love, betrayal, suffering, journeying, and redemption. He ties things together with the title track, which appears three times. It seems to owe a musical debt to the traditional Appalachian song \"Wayfarin' Stranger.\" \"Sometimes The Pleasure's Worth The Pain\" is big twangy country pop rock, sounding like Roy Orbison if Phil Spector had produced him. \"Reasons\" is a wrenching duet with Pam Tillis, while Emmylou and The Possum take turns in \"Truckstop.\" Honky tonk doesn't get much better than \"Red, Red Wine And Cheatin' Songs\" and \"Goin' Nowhere Fast.\" \"Hobo's Prayer\" is a gentle folk song about riding the rails. The only track that fails is \"The Observations Of A Crow,\" which collapses under the ponderous weight of its pretensions. He turns out a classic weeper with \"The Greatest Love Of All Time,\" which is immediately reprised instrumentally by a huge orchestra and sets up \"Draggin' Around The Chains Of Love\" wonderfully. It's a terrific rocker powered by Mike Campbell's guitar and is a musical cousin of Springsteen's \"The River.\" Johnny Cash majestically recites an excerpt from Alfred Lord Tennyson's Sir Galahad, before the closing instrumental take on \"John Henry\" with Earl Scruggs.\n\nI don't know what Marty was thinking. Is he trying to get dropped by pulling a Neil Young ­ releasing an uncommercial disc? Or did he just figure that with the increasingly small label rosters that this would be his last chance to get a cherished project out on a major label? Whichever, it's a fascinating record, and easily the biggest surprise of the year.\n\nBy John F. Butland\n\nThere are some things you need to know about Marty Stuart, things that are not readily apparent when you first see the Manuel jacket, big haired, hip swiveling party boy playing \"Hillbilly Rock.\" Marty grew up in Philadelphia, Mississippi. He joined legendary Lester Flatt's bluegrass band, as a mandolin picker, before he was even haired over. After Lester died, he became a part of Johnny Cash's band. He's a bigtime Clarence White fan, who owns and regularly plays Clarence's B-Bender Tele, the Holy Relic of the Hillbilly Twang Guitar Picker world. Marty has impeccable credentials. His first record, 1982s Busy Bee Cafe on Sugar Hill Records was a powerhouse of Bluegrass and twang. I had high hopes for Marty. I can't say I've been happy with all his MCA releases. They all seemed to drift too far away from his roots. That's not to say that he hasn't done some quality work. The bluegrass gospel records he has done with Jerry and Tammy Sullivan are killer. His work on Ralph Stanley's Clinch Mountain Country was excellent as well, but the Marty Party thing just never did anything for me. The Pilgrim however, has restored my faith in Marty Stuart.\n\nThis is the disc that shows all facets of the musician Marty Stuart. This is his concept album, based on a true story, about two men, a woman, a gun, and three broken hearts. It's got everything that good country music should contain. Mature themes, pain, pleasure, drinking, killing, and Jesus. There is Hillbilly Rock, B-Bender licks galore, hard core Honky Tonk, Country Weepers, and there is even Bluegrass. George Jones makes a short appearance, as does Emmylou Harris. Ralph Stanley joins Marty Stuart in a killing song. Pam Tillis sings some harmony. Dr Ralph comes back to sing a cappela with just a few songbirds and the whistle of a lonesome train for accompaniment. Uncle Josh plays his dobro, Earl Scruggs plays his banjo and Marty plays his mandolin and they all rock. Johnny Cash reads Tennyson and makes it sound as if the end of time is upon us.\n\nI'm telling you, I love this sumbitch. This is Marty Stuart's showcase piece. Like Monet's Water Lilies, this will be the work that will remain and be remembered long after Marty's gone. Now if we can just get him to record us another Bluegrass record I'd be happy. Or at least record me hillbilly version of \"Nashville West\".\n\nBy Jeff Wall\n\nMarty Stuart is perhaps the most tradition-minded country star of his generation. He came of age picking in the bands of such icons as Lester Flatt and Johnny Cash. He owns a museum's worth of honky-tonk memorabilia and is in his third term as president of the history-conscious Country Music Foundation. Yet, oddly enough, he's spent the past 10 years trying to parlay his rowdy blend of old and new sounds, his vaunted \"hillbilly rock,\" into the No. 1 slot on modern country radio.\n\nBut with the recent deaths of Roy Acuff and Bill Monroe, and the advancing years of countless other pioneers, some in Nashville are looking to Stuart to be the keeper of the hillbilly flame. The Pilgrim, his first album in three years, proves that this faith isn't misplaced. Gone is the party-hearty country-rock of Stuart's previous records. In its place is a tapestry that stretches across a century's worth of Americana, from old-time music and bluegrass to blues and honky-tonk.\n\nThe story Stuart tells in The Pilgrim has an epic sweep as well. Drawn from events that took place in the town of Philadelphia, Miss., while Stuart was growing up, the drama centers on a man and a woman who suffer tragedy and despair, but who also find redemption and, with it, each other.\n\nMixing bits of sung narrative with songs that comment on the action much as a Greek chorus would, Stuart enlists a Who's Who of country greats to help him unfold the album's plot. George Jones wrings an ocean of emotion from every syllable he utters on \"Truckstop.\" Bluegrass patriarch Ralph Stanley sounds like a mountaintop prophet on \"Harlan County.\" And Johnny Cash's craggy baritone is positively otherworldly when, intoning the blessing from Tennyson's \"Sir Galahad,\" he welcomes the wayward pilgrim home.\n\nEarl Scruggs, dobro player \"Uncle Josh\" Graves, Pam Tillis and Emmylou Harris also appear on the album. Yet, unlike most star cameos, none of the performances here seems gratuitous. Which isn't to say that the proceedings don't get a little overblown at times. The way Stuart has the pilgrim plunge into a life of drinking and hoboing, for example, is a bit melodramatic. And the way, on \"Hobo's Prayer,\" Stuart reduces homelessness to a matter of being a \"circle in a world full of squares\" is at best naively romantic.\n\nThe album's greatest strength is its music, be it the shuffling honky-tonk of \"Red, Red Wine and Cheatin' Songs,\" the crying steel and close country harmonies of \"Reasons\" or the noirish, half-recited, half-sung blues of \"The Observations of a Crow.\"\n\nBy Bill Friskics-Warren\n\nThe \"concept album\" isn't something that you often hear from Nashville. To be honest, you don't hear them often, period. But Marty Stuart's latest release, The Pilgrim, tackles this task and is more than up to it.\n\nOutside of the \"tribute albums\" that started cropping up occasionally in 1993 and ended up happening way too often (paying tribute to artists that didn't really deserve it) by 1996, there hasn't been a country recording to feature this many superstars in a very long time. Emmylou Harris, George Jones, Pam Tillis, and Ralph Stanley all add their vocals to the project. Stanley even brings along his Clinch Mountain Boys for some good old-fashioned bluegrass pickin' on some of the tracks.\n\nThe CD is a \"concept album\", meaning that it tells a story, and each track is a vital part. You won't be listening to this one in 'random' mode on the CD player; it's meant to be heard in the order it is presented. It tells the story of a man (the Pilgrim) who falls in love with a married woman - the catch is, she's never told him that she's married. The story is from the point of view of the Pilgrim, who leaves town when the husband kills himself, but eventually comes back to the woman he loves. The different contributing artists both sing background (or lead) on the songs and also add singing and recitation to the several interludes that fall between the full-length tunes.\n\nSuch a concept recording may make for critical success, but will radio play the songs? That remains to be seen. I find three tracks that are worthy of becoming hits. The first single is \"Red, Red Wine and Cheatin' Songs\", a snappy up-tempo number. The best chance for a hit may be \"The Greatest Love Of All Time\", a love ballad, or maybe \"Draggin' Around These Chains Of Love\", a duet with Tillis that is quite reminiscent of Stuart's mid-90's recordings, the ones that only hit the mid-reaches of the charts but to this reviewer were stronger than Marty's early radio hits.\n\nSpeaking of Marty's early success, the first full song on the CD, \"Sometimes The Pleasure's Worth The Pain\", sounds almost exactly like Marty's top 5 hit from 1991, \"Tempted.\" The melody is almost the same, the chord changes are the same, and it even includes the timpani playing the same notes. Though it's a decent-sounding song, it's unoriginality makes it a disappointment compared to the rest of the album.\n\nOnce that slight disappointment gets out of the way, though, tracks 3 through 20 are enough to make me give this CD a favorable review. It's not your normal 10-song Nashville recording, nor is it likely to become a commercial success, but it's good pickin' and singin' and worth three and half trees out of four.\n\nBy Matt Scheidler"
