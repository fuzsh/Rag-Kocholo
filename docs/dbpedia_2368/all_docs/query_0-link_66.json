        "text": "The Pain of Loving You written by Dolly Parton and Porter Wagoner © 1971 Velvet Apple Music Oh the pain of loving you Oh the misery I go through Never knowing what to do Oh the pain of loving you You just can't stand to see me happy Seems you hurt me all you can Still I go on loving you But I never understand Oh the pain of loving you Oh the misery I go through Never knowing what to do Oh the pain of loving you To love and hate at the same time The line between the two is fine The two have bound me heart and soul So strong that I can't let you go Oh the pain of loving you Oh the misery I go through Never knowing what to do Oh the pain of loving you Oh the pain of loving you\n\nMaking Plans written by Johnny Russell and Voni Morrison &copy 1963 Sure-Fire Music Co. You say tomorrow you're going That's so hard for me to believe I'm making plans for the heartaches Cause you're making plans to leave The tears for me will be falling Like a tree shedding its leaves I'm making plans for the teardrops Cause you're making plans to leave You're making plans to forget me I'm making plans to miss you I'm getting ready to grieve I'm making plans to be lonesome Cause you're making plans to leave I'm making plans to be lonesome Cause you're making plans to leave I'm making plans to be lonesome Cause you're making plans to leave\n\nTo Know Him Is To Love Him written by Phil Spector © 1958 Vogue Music To know know know him Is to love love love him Just to see him smile Makes my life worthwhile To know know know him Is to love love love him And I do I'll be good to him I'll bring love to him Everyone says there'll come a day When I'll walk alongside of him Yes just to know him Is to love love love him And I do Why can't he see How blind can he be Someday he will see That he was meant for me Oh To know know know him Is to love love love him Just to see him smile Makes my life worthwhile To know know know him Is to love love love him And I do\n\nHobo's Meditation written by Jimmie Rodgers © 1933 Peer International Corp Last night as I lay on the boxcar Just waiting for a train to pass by What will become of the hobo Whenever his time comes to die There's a Master up yonder in heaven Got a place that we might call our home Will we have to work for a living Or can we continue to roam Will there be any freight trains in heaven Any boxcars in which we might hide Will there be any tough cops or brakemen Will they tell us that we cannot ride Will the hobo chum with the rich man Will we always have money to spare Will they have respect for the hobo In that land that lies hidden up there Will there be any freight trains in heaven Any boxcars in which we might hide Will there be any tough cops or brakemen Will they tell us that we cannot ride Will the hobo chum with the rich man Will we always have money to spare Will they have respect for the hobo In that land that lies hidden up there\n\nWildflowers written by Dolly Parton © 1986 Velvet Apple Music The hills were alive with wildflowers and I Was as wild, even wilder than they For at least I could run They just died in the sun And I refused to just wither in place Just a wild mountain rose Needing freedom to grow So I ran fearing not where I'd go When a flower grows wild It can always survive Wildflowers don't care where they grow And the flowers I knew In the fields where I grew Were content to be lost in the crowd They were common and close I had no room for growth And I wanted so much to branch out So I uprooted myself from home ground and left Took my dreams and I took to the road When a flower grows wild It can always survive Wildflowers don't care where they grow I grew up fast and wild And I never felt right In a garden so different from me I just never belonged I just longed to be gone So the garden one day set me free I hitched a ride with the wind And since he was my friend I just let him decide where we'd go When a flower grows wild It can always survive Wildflowers don't care where they grow Just a wild rambling rose seeking mysteries untold No regret for the path that I chose When a flower grows wild It can always survive Wildflowers don't care where they grow\n\nTelling Me Lies written by Linda Thompson and Betty Cook © 1985 Linda Thompson / Firesign Music Ltd. They say a woman's a fool for weeping A fool to break her own heart But I can't hold the secret I'm keeping I'm breaking apart Can't seem to mind my own business Whatever I try turns out wrong I seem like my own false witness And I can't go on I cover my ears I close my eyes Still hear your voice and it's telling me lies Telling me lies You told me you needed my company And I believed in your flattering ways Told me you needed me forever Nearly gave you the rest of my days Should've seen you for what you are Should never have come back for more Should've locked up all my silver Brought the key back to your door I cover my ears I close my eyes Still hear your voice and it's telling me lies Telling me lies You don't know what a chance is Until you have to seize one You don't know what a man is Until you have to please one Don't put your life in the hands of a man With a face for every season Don't waste your time in the arms of a man Who's no stranger to treason I cover my ears I close my eyes Still hear your voice and it's telling me lies Telling me lies I cover my ears I close my eyes Still hear your voice and it's telling me lies I cover my ears I close my eyes Still hear your voice and it's telling me lies\n\nMy Dear Companion written by Jean Ritchie © 1976 Geordie Music Pub Co. Oh have you seen my dear companion For he was all this world to me I hear he's gone to some far country And that he cares no more for me I wish I were a swallow flying I'd fly to a high and lonesome place I'd join the wild birds in their crying Thinking of you and your sweet face Oh have you seen my dear companion For he was all this world to me But now the stars have turned against me And he cares no more for me Oh when the dark is on the mountain And all the world has gone to sleep I will go down to the cold dark waters And there I'll lay me down and weep Oh have you seen my dear companion Oh have you seen my dear companion Oh have you seen my dear companion For he was all this world to me\n\nThose Memories of You written by Alan O'Bryant © 1978 Bill Monroe Music Those memories of you still haunt me Every night when I lay down I'll always love you little darling Until the day they lay me down In dreams of you my body trembles I wake up and call your name But you're not there and I'm so lonesome Without your love I'd go insane Those memories of you still haunt me Every night when I lay down I'll always love you little darling Until the day they lay me down I close my eyes and you're there with me Your kiss I feel your face I see It's not your lips now that drive me crazy It's just your haunting memory Those memories of you still haunt me Every night when I lay down I'll always love you my little darling Until the day they lay me down Until the day they lay me down\n\nI've Had Enough written by Kate McGarrigle © 1981 Garden Court Music Love it's not I Who didn't try Hard enough Hard enough And this is why I'm saying goodbye I've had enough I've had enough Love you don't see The pain in me That's plain enough Plain enough You're never here To catch the tears I cried for us I cried for us I'll take my share But I'll be fair There's not much stuff Easy enough And if you choose I'll break the news This part is tough So very tough I've tried and tried To put aside The time to talk But without luck So I'll just pin this note Within your coat And leave the garden gate unlocked And this is why I'm saying goodbye I've had enough I've had enough\n\nRosewood Casket Traditional, arranged by Avie Lee Parton There's a little rosewood casket Resting on a marble stand With a packet of old love letters Written by my true love's hand Go and bring them to me sister Read them o'er for me tonight I have often tried but I could not For the tears that filled my eyes When I'm dead and in my casket When I gently fall asleep Fall asleep to wake in heaven Dearest sister do not weep Take his letters and his locket Place them gently on my heart But this golden ring that he gave me From my finger never part There's a little rosewood casket Resting on a marble stand With a packet of old love letters Written by my true love's hand"
