        "text": "Emmylou Harris and Rodney Crowell's The Traveling Kind reviewed\n\nIt's likely that on her school report it was said of the young Emmylou Harris that \"she plays well with others\". Since being plucked from a Washington D.C. folk club by the doomed but hugely influential country/country rock figure Gram Parsons, to sing alongside him for two landmark albums, Harris has been what you might call the essential companion.\n\nShe showed with Parsons, and later with Dolly Parton and Linda Ronstadt, that she was one of the great harmony vocalists, then with seemingly anyone of note from Bob Dylan to Elvis Costello to Ryan Adams, she has been one of the most in-demand backing vocalists.\n\nAs a singer in search of a quality song to sing she has been both a champion of traditional songs sometimes forgotten in the wake of rhinestone and big hats, and one of the most important voices on behalf of rising young songwriters from Rodney Crowell and Lucinda Williams decades ago to Patty Griffin more recently.\n\nAnd, almost incidentally, along the way she became one of the finest singers in the sometimes linked fields of country, pop, atmospheric rock and what eventually would be called Americana. The woman has been busy and stayed busy for nearly 50 years now.\n\n\"It suits me I think,\" Harris says of the constant work. \"It's woven into the whole fabric of my life now and has served me well.\"\n\nDoes she ever hesitate when asked to contribute to somebody else's record? She is always on the road or in the studio. \"Not like Willie [Nelson who has been working to pay his tax debts off for more than a decade now],\" she says with a laugh. However, you would be hard-pressed to think of a single thing she's sung on or person she's worked with that wasn't of seriously high quality.\n\n\"For the most part I work with my friends now,\" she claims, as if that's a way to reduce the demand. But given her longevity (her first recordings with Parsons were in 1972), her extensive and varied work since and her influence across generations and genres, \"my friends\" is a pretty big cohort.\n\nAmong them is Crowell, with whom she has recorded two albums of duets in since 2013, including this year's The Traveling Kind, and will tour Australia with in June. Crowell, an extremely well-regarded songwriter and one-time son-in-law of Johnny Cash (as the husband of singer/songwriter Rosanne Cash) was part of her Hot Band in the mid 1970s and she calls him \"just about my oldest collaborator\".\n\nThey've been singing for 40 years and, amazingly perhaps, still talk. \"We pretty much talk all the time, I don't even think about it really because we laugh a lot.\" Picking the songs for their second collaboration was \"pretty much a non-stop conversation\". They dug into old songs and wrote a few more together, not surprisingly finding it easy to work together.\n\n\"Especially when you're writing, you have to have that,\" she says. \"I trust his instincts and we have never butted heads that I can remember.\"\n\nMaking it easy, too, was producer Joe Henry, who, like anyone with a taste for quality Americana, country or music generally, was a fan of both of them. Especially Harris.\n\n\"I did have a few of those moments last week when I asked myself how I got here,\" Henry said of those sessions. \"I'm listening to a playback in a control room, shoulder to shoulder with Emmylou. She means to me what she means to everybody else.\"\n\nWhat struck Henry, apart from the sheer pleasure of her voice, was the quality of Harris's songwriting. It's something that has appeared irregularly throughout her career but each time it surfaces it is with a sense of \"why doesn't she do this more often?\".\n\n\"Rodney was the one who pulled me into writing for this record,\" Harris confesses. \"I'm very comfortable being an interpreter so I have to set aside blocks of time where I don't do anything else [so as to write]. I really hadn't written since [2011's] Hard Bargain and I trust Rodney so much so didn't really have any ideas stewing around.\"\n\nFor Crowell, the idea of not writing had never occurred to him, songwriting being something he sees almost as a spiritual demand for Harris as much as himself. \"I really think that one of the ways that you truly honour the tradition of songwriting and storytelling ...what you owe those who have truly achieved greatness, is to strive for greatness in yourself.\""
