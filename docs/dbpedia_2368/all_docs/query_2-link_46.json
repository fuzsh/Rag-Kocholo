        "text": "Earlier this week, Billie Eilish was obliged to issue an apology, after an eight-year-old video of the singer emerged, featuring her mouthing along to a racial slur in Tyler, the Creator’s Fish, in a lyric that is also about date rape. It had provoked the kind of bad-faith performative outrage in which certain corners of the internet specialise, but, if nothing else, it functioned as a reminder of different era, in which the Odd Future collective were held to be The World’s Most Notorious Rap Group – a broiling mass of wilful controversy thanks to their lyrics – and Tyler, their de facto leader, was quaintly thought such a threat to public morals that the then-home secretary, Theresa May, successfully petitioned to have him barred from entering the UK.\n\nFor all the column inches expended on them, you would have been forgiven for thinking that this was not a career built to last: the succès de scandale tends to burn bright, but not long; dissenting voices wondered if it were possible to translate infamy and a willingness to give their music away for free online into a career. Occasionally, those voices belonged to Odd Future themselves. “I could fail tomorrow. A year from now no one will give a fuck about this interview,” Tyler told the Guardian in 2012. “That’s always in the back of my head. But I have to keep doing what I’m doing.”\n\nAs it turned out, he needn’t have worried: nine years later, Tyler, the Creator finds himself a lauded, longstanding figure in hip-hop and beyond, and the author of a succession of Top 10 albums, the last of which – 2019’s Igor – won a Grammy and went to No 1 in the US. “Doing what I’m doing” turned out to mean doing the last things you would once have expected, including gradually toning down the more controversy-provoking aspects of his style without losing his experimental edge, bringing tenderness and greater sincerity to his honesty and vulnerability, imperiously shifting his sound at will, and singing. The author of 2011’s starkly oppressive Goblin was subsequently to be found making Dr Seuss-inspired EPs with “seven-year-olds in mind”; the contents of Igor were less like hip-hop than an exploratory, 21st-century take on soul music.\n\nIt’s a process of evolution that continues on Call Me If You Get Lost, an album on which all the tracks elide into each other; that deals largely in short, sharp bursts of music but finds room for two episodic epics that each clock in close to the 10-minute mark. It goes some way towards fusing the two extremes of Tyler, the Creator’s persona – the hard hitting rapper who, as he’s often wont to point out doesn’t “give a fuck”, makes jokes about terrorism and brags about having been “cancelled before cancelled was with Twitter fingers” and the sensitive, lovelorn melodic experimentalist who claims “I would rather hold your hand than have a cool handshake”. The latter is in the middle of Wilshire, eight-and-a-half minutes of breakbeats and gentle wah-pedal funk guitar over which he details an illicit relationship sparking, then failing, in painful detail, as well as alluding to his flexible attitude to sexuality.\n\nThe album introduces yet another new persona – Sir Tyler Baudelaire, presumably named after the decadent French poet – and underlines that, in a straitened world, where artists are expected to adhere to certain standards and fulsomely apologise for their transgressions, its author remains a thrillingly messy and conflicted character. At one juncture on Corso, he apologises for saying “bitch” (“I don’t even like using the word”), elsewhere he lets fly with far worse in hair-raising style; Manifesto offers a complex, nuanced examination of the Black Lives Matter protests and his own reaction that declines to fall in line with pat sloganeering (“I ain’t gonna cheerlead with y’all just to be a dancer”) and wonders aloud if his past reputation means his support will do more harm than good.\n\nThe lyrics veer wildly about, and the music follows suit, in the best possible sense: its stylistic lurches are both unexpected and hugely impressive, the product of an artist with eclectic tastes and a disinclination to make music that fits in with prevalent trends. Sweet/I Thought You Wanted To Dance alone goes from spindly synth-pop with a melody that vaguely recalls Neil Sedaka’s Laughter in the Rain, to two-step soul ballad to reggae; the straightforward menace of Lumberjack is followed by Hot Wind Blows, which sticks a guest feature from Lil Wayne over an abstract, jazz-infused backdrop.\n\nThe result is a dense, kaleidoscopic album that might take a lot of time to fully unpick, but clearly isn’t going to diminish in quality if you do so. “I came a long way from my past … it’s obvious,” he says at one point, which it is. Call Me If You Get Lost is another stop on a far longer and more serpentine musical journey than anyone might have expected Tyler, the Creator to undertake a decade ago.\n\nHard to believe, but on 5 June Martha Argerich turned 80. Her birthday has been celebrated by several of the labels for which she has recorded over seven decades, with lavish reissues of her classic discs, many of them dazzling performances that rank among the greatest of the piano repertoire ever recorded. Even though it’s well over 30 years since she was lured into a studio to make a solo recording, and almost as long since she gave a solo recital in public, saying that she feels “lonely” on stage without a recital partner or an orchestra, she is still generally regarded as the greatest pianist alive today.\n\nEuroArts’ collection superbly complements what is available on the audio discs. It not only includes some of Argerich’s most celebrated interpretations, but begins with Bloody Daughter, the affectionate 2012 documentary that her youngest daughter, Stéphanie, made about the notoriously publicity-shy pianist. The concert performances range from the 1970s to just last year. There’s a pair of piano concertos recorded with British orchestras in 1977 – a fierce, imposing account of Tchaikovsky’s First with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic under Charles Groves, and a typically breathtaking one of Prokofiev’s Third, with André Previn and the London Symphony – as well as a 2010 performance in Warsaw of Chopin’s First Concerto, the work with which she had won the Chopin Competition in the same city 45 years earlier, and which also includes a precious couple of solo encores, a Chopin mazurka and one of Schumann’s Op 12 Fantasiestücke.\n\nNo portrait of Argerich would be complete without an example of her chamber playing, collaborations that have dominated her musical life for the last quarter century. Here it’s a recital of violin sonatas by Schumann, Prokofiev and Franck with Guy Braunstein, ending with a delicious group of Kreisler lollipops, recorded in February last year. But perhaps the most compelling discs are those with two of her most enduring collaborators, Daniel Barenboim and Claudio Abbado. Argerich’s two-piano recital with Barenboim in the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires in 2014 – a programme of Mozart, Schubert, Schumann and Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring – was clearly an emotional return to the city in which the two great musicians had grown up in the 1940s. And though the filming of Abbado’s Prometheus-themed concert with the Berlin Philharmonic in 1992, which begins with Beethoven’s The Creatures of Prometheus and ends with a section of Luigi Nono’s “tragedy for listening” Prometeo, is just a bit too “arty”, it has Scriabin’s Prometheus as its glorious centrepiece, a work whose darting, flickering solo-piano part is so perfectly suited to Argerich’s imperishable virtuosity.\n\nThe first disc devoted exclusively to orchestral music by Francisco Coll traces a neat trajectory through his development over the last decade and a half. The earliest piece here is Coll’s opus 1, Aqua Cinerea, composed in 2005 when he was 19; the most recent is his Violin Concerto, written for Patricia Kopatchinskaja in 2019. It’s been a hugely impressive development, taking the flair for vivid orchestral colouring and stark, sometimes shocking juxtapositions of imagery that was evident from the start in Coll’s music in ever more distinctive and personal directions, while never forgetting the debt his music owes to tradition, whether modernist or more specifically Spanish.\n\nThe nervy, unstable rhythms of Hidd’n Blue, first performed by the London Symphony Orchestra under Coll’s teacher Thomas Adès in 2012, largely continue where Aqua Cinerea left off. But the five-movement Mural, which followed four years later, is much more substantial, almost symphonic attempt to reconcile past and present, to build something fresh from the rubble of musical history, while the Four Iberian Miniatures, for violin and chamber orchestra, lovingly and wittily adopts the rhythms and rawness of Spanish dance from tango to flamenco.\n\nThe Violin Concerto is the fourth work that Coll has composed specifically for Kopatchinskaja since they were introduced by the conductor Gustavo Gimeno five years ago – another of those pieces was the double concerto Plairs Illuminées, which appeared on disc earlier this year. Kopatchinskaja’s extraordinary, freewheeling virtuosity appears to have unlocked a new vein of immediacy and expressiveness in Coll’s music, which the Violin Concerto seems to me to take on to another plane altogether. It’s a fabulously assured piece in three evocatively labelled movements – Atomised, Hyperhymnia, Phase – which outline the shape of a traditional concerto, complete with solo cadenza. Ligeti’s violin concerto, and more specifically Kopatchinskaja’s dazzling performances of it, seem to lie behind the pyrotechnics of the first movement, while something more deeply personal is explored in the murmuring expressiveness of the second, before the music explodes again in the anarchy of the third. It’s compelling from first note to last, and could hardly be better played by Kopatchinskaja and the Luxembourg orchestra under Gimeno.\n\nThe music magazine Uncut recently featured a cover-mounted CD and an accompanying article celebrating “Ambient Americana”, subtitled “a road trip across psychic state lines”, while the Guardian surveyed the “ambient country” scene in 2020. Also known as “post-country”, “cosmic pastoral” or “bootgaze”, it’s a micro-genre that has been percolating for decades. Think of Ry Cooder’s soundtrack to Paris, Texas; BJ Cole’s collaborations with Guy Jackson or Øyvind Skarbø, Brian Eno’s work with Daniel Lanois, the avant garde primitivism of John Fahey, or even The KLF’s Chill Out album. In recent years it has been taken in new directions by the likes of Chuck Johnson, Mike Cooper, Marielle Jakobsons and the Nashville duo Hammock.\n\nThe latest development in the genre comes from Blank Gloss, a duo from Sacramento, California, comprising Patrick Hills and Morgan Fox. The pair have a history in thrashy punk and experimental bands but, since signing to the Cologne-based electronic label Kompakt, they’ve moved in a more ruminative, improvisational direction. Their debut album Melt is a futuristic journey through the US desert, one that dismantles the defining sonic tropes of American roots music (woozy pedal steel flourishes, slurring fiddles, brushed drums, the twang of a reverb-drenched electric guitar) and reassembles them as disembodied sounds, put through an ambient filter. Where so much electronica conjures up concrete brutalism, spacious warehouses and neon-lit motorways, Melt suggests wide open spaces, huge skies, endless horizons and dust-dry roads.\n\nThese improvisations often remove any rhythmic anchor – when they do introduce a pulse it is often irregular, like the twisted new age beats of Walking Toward the End, or the slithering double bass and piano patterns on Strewn All Over, which start at a gentle 6/8 canter and then keep subtracting beats, leaving us with a gloriously disorientating time signature. Opening track Those Who Plant weaves a wistful EBowed guitar around synth drones and Harold Budd-style piano voicings; Rags is like a Dick Dale tour de force played at a snail’s pace, with a reverb-drenched surf guitar playing ultra slow motion arpeggios that resonate sympathetically with muted piano riffs. Best of all is the heartachingly beautiful Of a Vessel, which sounds like a piece of ECM jazz that has been warped in the Mojave sun.\n\nVince Staples currently occupies an intriguing and almost unique space within hip-hop. He’s become successful – big enough to get an endorsement deal with Sprite, to be asked for his grooming tips by GQ magazine, and that his fourth album comes bound up with the announcement of his own Netflix show – without actually having had a major hit. His most successful album, 2017’s Big Fish Theory, briefly scraped the lower reaches of the US Top 20; his 2015 single Norf Norf went gold without making the charts.\n\nPerhaps that’s part of his plan. In a genre usually obsessed with success and the status it brings, he’s claimed to be uninterested in either: “Don’t go diamond [sell 10m copies] and you’ll be fine,” he told an interviewer who asked about his ambitions early on in his career. “You’ll have a regular life.”\n\nYou’re also likely to get more artistic wriggle room than someone charged with following up a multimillion-selling hit, something Staples has used to his advantage, chopping and changing his sound with each new release. His debut, Summertime 06, was shadowy and dark; Big Fish Theory was audibly influenced by Detroit techno and saw him collaborating with Sophie and Australian dance producer Flume; 2018’s FM! crammed 11 tracks into 20 minutes, presented itself like a radio show and kept wilfully short-circuiting the listener, not least when Staples ceded the microphone entirely to Tyga and Earl Sweatshirt, then cut their tracks short.\n\nThe message that Staples isn’t going to do what people expect him to has rung out pretty clear – when a video of a white Christian mother attacking his lyrics as “filth” went viral, Staples rushed to her defence and chastised fans attacking her – and the stylistic alterations continue on his eponymous fourth album. Produced by Kenny Beats, whose intriguing résumé takes in everything from Gucci Mane to Idles to Ed Sheeran, it mirrors FM!’s brevity – again, it’s just a shade over 20 minutes long – but sounds noticeably different.\n\nThe eerie electronic tones of FM!’s Run the Bands or Don’t Get Chipped are largely replaced by music that feels hazy and relaxed, more obviously inspired by 90s G-funk and its characteristic repurposing of old soul. Staples has always been open about his west coast musical inspirations – “if this was 88, would have signed to Ruthless” he suggested eight years ago, during his guest appearance on Earl Sweatshirt’s debut album, “94, would have had ’em walking down Death Row” – even if they haven’t always been audible in his sound. Here, Sundown Town and Taking Trips feel like G-funk tracks viewed through a fog or a distorting lens. The samples are muffled and warped, vocals sped up to squeaky chipmunk frequencies or slowed into incomprehensible sonic gloop. There’s a very pop melody lurking within opener Are You With That, and a gorgeous vocal by TikTok-boosted alt-soul singer Fousheé on Take Me Home, but the album is almost devoid of obvious hooks or choruses, the music there largely as a backdrop for Staples’ voice.\n\nThe rapper has suggested the album is his most personal to date, hence the title; this time around, the interludes are provided not by his fellow rappers, but his mum, talking about her anger issues and an old friend, recounting the grim story of a party that Staples luckily declined to attend and which turned bloodily violent. In the past, his lyrics have hardly shied away from his troubled upbringing in North Long Beach, California, but here he seems consumed by it. “When I see my fans I’m too paranoid to shake their hands,” he says on Sundown Town, while Law of Averages offers a litany of distrust, born out of the disparity between the environment he grew up in and the one he now inhabits. He’s extremely good at drawing the former in a matter-of-fact, conversational tone that emphasises what he’s describing isn’t exceptional, but everyday – “don’t get murdered” he mutters at the opening of The Shining, as if reminding you to pick up groceries on your way home – and good, too, at throwing the listener off. Taking Trips sounds relaxed and summery, its synth line lazily spiralling upwards, but its mood, if not its subject, is at odds with the lyrics: “Can’t even hit the beach without my heaters in my trunks … this summer sucks.” “I’m a real beach boy,” Staples offers drily on Are You With That?, a knowing reference to a band who defined a certain kind of white California utopia and who grew up in Hawthorne, 20 minutes’ drive from his home town. “Come round my way.”\n\nHe still seems as diffident about big commercial success as ever – “fuck a mansion” he snaps at one point. But then, you can’t really blame him. Vince Staples is idiosyncratic and really impressive, the sound of someone walking their own path, uncoupled from current trends, shifting and changing as they go. You leave it keen to hear what his next album – apparently already completed – holds. The space he’s created for himself isn’t a bad place to be.\n\n• Vince Staples is released 9 July.\n\nIn 1921, Carl Nielsen heard the Copenhagen Wind Quintet for the first time and was bowled over by the sheer musicality of their playing. The following year he composed a wind quintet for the group, which ends with a set of variations that depict the characters of the members in turn, and announced that he planned to write a solo concerto for each of them, too. But he only managed to complete two of those concertos, the work for flute in 1926 and for clarinet two years later, before his death in 1931. They were his last large-scale orchestral pieces, and continue to show the influences of modernism that had already appeared in his final symphony, the Sixth.\n\nTogether with the much earlier violin concerto, those concertos define the classes in the Carl Nielsen International Competition, held every three or four years in Odense, near to the composer’s birthplace on the Danish island of Funen. The flute and clarinet winners in the most recent competition in 2019 are featured on this pair of portrait discs with the Odense Symphony Orchestra and conductor Anna Skryleva. As well as the Nielsen concerto, the French flautist Joséphine Olech plays concertos by Theodoor Verhey and Jean Françaix, while the Slovenian Blaž Šparovec includes works for clarinet and orchestra by Debussy, Lutosławski and Copland alongside his Nielsen performance.\n\nBoth are clearly very fine woodwind players, who are given punchy, characterful support by Skryleva and the Odense SO in scores in which Nielsen often makes the orchestra an equally important protagonist. Olech gets the neurotic solo flute writing, and its reactions to the rude intrusions from a solo trombone, spot on, and Šparovec portrays the irascible character of the clarinet in its duels with the snare drum in the orchestra vividly, too. There are already fine versions of both concertos available on disc, some more vivid, some more genteel, but these don’t suffer by comparison at all.\n\nFor every raga there is a time. Traditionally, the Indian classical form is composed with a specific time of day in mind, and only then is each raga meant to reveal the height of its melodic beauty to the listener.\n\nIndian American composer Arushi Jain weaves her diasporic identity into this notion of timely ragas in her debut album, Under the Lilac Sky. Composed for the sunset, it blends Jain’s training as an Indian classical vocalist with modular synth work inspired by the likes of American composers Suzanne Ciani and Terry Riley into six ambient arrangements that reflect the transition from day to night.\n\nUnlike the sufi lineage of Indian classical music, which places vocal melodies as the focal point of compositions, Jain uses her voice as a harmonic texture that interacts with her looping and layered synth patches. Opening track Richer Than Blood gently builds falsetto vocal harmonies over a rumbling electronic bass drone, as if heralding the first dip of the sun from the sky, and replicating the traditional root note of the tanpura. As the drone intensifies to a guttural buzz and the darkness builds on Look How Far We Have Come, Jain disassembles the melody on her synth and brings it to a harmonic resolution through her vocals, releasing the tension.\n\nThroughout the album, these percussion-less tracks are propelled by their own sense of momentum, grounded by the pace of Jain’s repeating synth patterns and the reassuring constant of her vocal melodies, heard with particularly piercing clarity in the bass-led My People Have Deep Roots. It is an anchoring point in the otherwise ever-changing tessellation of drones and keys.\n\nReleasing her debut album as India reckons with a horrendous outbreak of Covid-19, Jain explains in her press materials that she would like her work to foster empathy and awareness for the lives lost. In her repurposing of the evening raga, Jain invokes home while creating her own language of expression. It is one that provides solace during such an uncertain and painful time – a reminder that the beauty of sunset always gives way to night, and that daybreak will come again.\n\nThe rise of Griff feels like a silver lining around the thundercloud that was 2020. While all around the 20-year-old pop powerhouse careers stalled, tours evaporated and sound engineers peed in bottles while driving delivery vans, this singer went from buzzy obscurity in Kings Langley, Hertfordshire, locked down with her family and foster siblings, to a Top 20 hit and a Brits rising star award.\n\nAlong the way, there have been fistfuls of great, under-the-radar tunes, Taylor Swift endorsements and an ever-growing bubble ponytail, Griff’s visual signature, a sculptural riff on Ariana Grande’s own swishy hair extension. There was also a Disney Christmas ad, of which the best that can be said is that it was a Trojan horse, delivering Griff’s elastic, emotive voice into greater public consciousness. As @wiffygriffy, this holder of a textiles A-level, AKA Sarah Griffiths, does good work on TikTok, posing craft challenges.\n\nOn Brits night itself, Griff stole the show; it was only her second-ever gig. Sashaying expertly across a very literal stage set – “there’s a big black hole where my heart used to be,” Griff sang, from a hollowed-out, heart-shaped plinth – she nailed Black Hole’s dramatic vocals. This former bedroom pop producer also made a point of looping her voice live on a loop pedal machine, à la Ed Sheeran at Glastonbury. In interviews, Griffiths has spoken out about the continuing dearth of female producers, never mind female producers of colour (her own heritage is Chinese-Jamaican). That loop pedal is now a competition prize.\n\nOne Foot in Front of the Other is, though, an odd release. A debut album in all but name, this mixtape comes with the caveat that it was written and recorded during lockdown. Griff and her label feel that her debut album proper is still ahead of her.\n\nCertainly, this mini-album’s title chimes hard with the emotional rollercoaster of the year just gone. Griff’s mood is often pensive. Sober themes abound. Not for Griff the giddy heights of love’s intoxication – at least not here. One track, self-written and self-produced, ponders the age-defying, cancer-busting properties of Earl Grey tea. “You’re so scared of dying slowly,” sings Griff as the keys on her electric piano clunk in the background, “but why aren’t you more scared of dying lonely?”\n\nSimilarly, Shade of Yellow finds Griff finding solace in the quality of lamplight. It makes her feel safe – “and I swear, that’s rare these days”, she notes. Like everyone else, she’s been having weird dreams. “Usually I forget them, in, like, a millisecond,” she sings on Remembering My Dreams, but these details are vivid. Maybe too vivid: the perky bittersweetness of the production finds room for a distant, groaning undertow.\n\nAs much as you want to punch the word “resilience” for being everywhere now, wobbling and righting yourself are this record’s themes, not least on the title track. Released last month, it lays out persuasive evidence that Griff is a talent deserving of the hype. Alongside the usual prerequisite pop tick-boxes – earworm melody, punchy step-change from verse to chorus and so on – she emanates effortless maturity. “You know it’s easy when you’re young/ Bounce back and whatever/ Just bounce back like it never happened,” Griff offers in a kind of R&B mutter. The young suffer just as much as anyone else, she argues. Hence the tightrope-walking artwork: Griff is trying, but not quite nailing the art of functioning after some setback or breakup, legs shaking, face plant imminent.\n\n“Things just take longer to heal these days,” she pronounces. Hers is a wise, eloquent head on shoulders that just happen to be encased in architectural ballgowns. If Lorde hadn’t just released a single, Griff would make an excellent stand-in for fans of the New Zealander’s preternaturally poised pop. As it is, you can hear Griff’s Taylor Swift fandom often here, but that is no criticism. With it comes a taut compositional style and ninja-level emotional literacy.\n\nTwo tiny concerns nag at this mixtape. One is that, with the arrival of pro songwriting and production hands, the more arresting sounds of Griff’s EP Mirror Talk, released last year, have been homogenised. Another is the vague impression that she may be keeping her powder dry for whatever comes next. Given that these songs are really, really good, you pity the competition when Griff: The Opus finally lands."
