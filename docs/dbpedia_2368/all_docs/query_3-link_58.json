They want to ensure that the audience feels like they are back in the 1970s listening to the hottest band on the scene. The stories of Fleetwood Mac, their relationships, and knowing how it influenced their sound are why it’s so important for the member of Tell Me Lies to hold true to the music of Fleetwood Mac. This band believes that to love Fleetwood Mac and their music, you must fully grasp their spirituality and their history. Their motto, which was set in the very beginning stages of this band is, “It is about THEIR music.” Tell Me Lies, prides themselves on being the most authentic Fleetwood Mac Tribute without coming across as a parody or satire.
