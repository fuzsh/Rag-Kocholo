        "text": "In her four-decade career, Emmylou Harris has earned a dozen Grammy Awards and a spot in the Country Music Hall of Fame. Her long list of collaborators includes Gram Parsons, Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison, George Jones, Willie Nelson, Neil Young, Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt and Rodney Crowell, an old friend and former band mate with whom she has just released a duets album, “Old Yellow Moon.”\n\nThey will perform at the Paramount in Huntington on Long Island on March 24 and at the Beacon Theater in New York on March 27.\n\nMs. Harris, 65, called recently to talk about songs, staying creative and her second career. Our conversation has been edited and condensed.\n\nThe passage of time is a recurring motif on your new album. Did you and Rodney have that theme in mind when you were choosing material or did it happen organically?\n\nIt was definitely organic, because we’ve been talking about making this record from the time we became friends in 1974. We never had a concept, except the fact that we love to sing together and love the same kind of songs. As we started picking material, it became obvious that we weren’t going to do these lovey-dovey sorts of songs that perhaps might have appealed to us when we were younger.\n\nAnd yet you’ve returned to songs from both of your pasts. Why do some retain their appeal while others don’t, and how does your interpretation of a song change over time?\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
