        "text": "When considering the whole sweep of 20th century music, the 1960s loom especially large. Some of the importance placed on the music of the decade can be traced to demographics (the massive baby boomer generation born after World War II reached prime music-listening age) and technology (the consumer electronics industry was creating new listening spaces in automobiles and on television, and advancements in sound reinforcement made large concerts possible). Still, there’s no getting around the fact that the music of the ’60s made a huge impact at the time and never really went away. In the 1950s, the album charts were dominated by easy listening singers like Bing Crosby and endless musicals, records that only have niche audiences now. But so many top LPs from the 1960s continue to enthrall old and new listeners, and they're still re-discovered and re-assessed.\n\nThis list is Pitchfork’s attempt to do just that. The key for us in assembling this list, which is based on votes from more than 50 full-time staffers and regularly contributing writers, is to make sure we opened up our look at the decade to incorporate all places where great music was happening in LP form. That means, in addition to a mix of rock and pop and R&B, our list is heavy on jazz and includes quite a bit of early electronic music alongside records from outside the English-speaking world. Inevitably, our list also reflects the realities of the marketplace in the ’60s—some brilliant singles artists never made a great album. But we hope this list represents the best of what the decade has to offer and reflects how people explore music now. In 2017, we’re not making the same divisions between, say, Miles Davis’ In a Silent Way and John Fahey’s The Legend of Blind Joe Death or Nico’s Chelsea Girl; they’re all gorgeous records that fill a room, records we stream and collect and share with our friends with a “you gotta hear this one.” Here are 197 more.\n\nListen to selections from this list on our Spotify playlist and our Apple Music playlist.\n\n200.\n\nEnnio Morricone: Il Buono, Il Brutto, Il Cattivo (1966)\n\nComposer Ennio Morricone and director Sergio Leone worked in tandem throughout the 1960s on Italian spaghetti westerns, and their masterpiece is The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. The entire three-hour epic is conjured fully in the first five notes of Morricone’s theme, that mythical coyote howl. Then comes the anachronistic kang of electric guitar, the strident trumpet, and wooden flute; you can feel the dirt from the graveyard and smell Clint Eastwood’s cigar.\n\nBefore the film was shot, Morricone and Leone worked out musical themes for the three main characters, and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is one of the greatest soundtracks in history because it feels like the movie was retrofitted to it. What should happen during “L’Estasi Dell’Oro (The Ecstasy of Gold)”? Let’s just have a guy run around in circles for a few minutes. What about “Il Triello (The Trio)”? How about three guys just stand there and stare at each other? These are thrilling moments in cinematic history, devoid of dialogue—just the tactile, otherworldly music of Morricone guiding the film into the sunset. –Jeremy D. Larson\n\nListen: Ennio Morricone: “Il Triello”\n\n199.\n\nDonovan: Sunshine Superman (1966)\n\nBefore the Summer of Love, there was the Season of the Witch. In it, Donovan Leitch transformed from the Scottish Bob Dylan into the Sunshine Superman, a paisley-clad and permed psychedelic who wrote fables about rotund angels, Arthurian queens, and Sunset Strip nightclubs where Fellini dream women danced with sequins in their hair.\n\nDonovan drew his formula from Celtic mythology, hillbilly American folk, Indian sitar ragas, Beat poetry, and the occasional bongo solo. The 20-year-old gypsy also conscripted future Led Zeppelin members Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones as session men on the title track, which soared to No. 1 in the United States. In the process, Donovan hallucinated the modern archetype of the guitar-picking mystic, one that would be borrowed by Marc Bolan, pre–Hunky Dory David Bowie, and the Tolkien fanatics who’d just shared his studio. –Jeff Weiss\n\nListen: Donovan: “Sunshine Superman”\n\n198.\n\nAndrew Hill: Point of Departure (1964)\n\nThe fifth album from the Chicago-born pianist Andrew Hill catapulted him to the top tier of forward-looking jazz composers of the ’60s. As Ornette Coleman and John Coltrane pioneered jazz’s “New Thing” movement, loosening the shackles of long-established chord progressions, Hill’s tight-knit pieces played within them, drawing on post-bop, avant-garde, and the blues. Point of Departure is at once abstract and dynamic, labyrinthine and lyrical, dizzying and dense with ideas. In this session, Hill found his perfect foil in the adventurous woodwind multi-instrumentalist Eric Dolphy (who would tragically die just three months later). Joined by several other talented collaborators, they soar to the furthest reaches of Hill’s ever-shifting compositions, offering a fearless moment in a tumultuous era for jazz. –Andy Beta\n\nListen: Andrew Hill: “New Monastery”\n\n197.\n\nCecil Taylor: Unit Structures (1966)\n\nAmong the most intense of the early free jazz albums, pianist Cecil Taylor’s 1966 Blue Note debut, Unit Structures, still challenges notions of musical freedom. Recorded during the same season that the psychedelic ballroom scene was starting to bubble in San Francisco, Unit Structures did more to disassemble music than nearly all of the light-show-drenched psychedelia that followed. The album is by no means easy listening; the atonality is unrepentant. But Taylor’s septet finds numerous gorgeous spaces as they interpret “free jazz” not just as the freedom to improvise but the freedom to invent musical worlds and hidden syntaxes. The only way to tap into the “rhythm-sound energy found in the amplitude of each time unit,” as Taylor wrote in the liner notes, is to listen reverently. –Jesse Jarnow\n\nListen: Cecil Taylor: “Steps”\n\n196.\n\nWanda Jackson: Rockin’ With Wanda (1960)\n\nTo read most rock histories, you’d think women started picking up guitars sometime in the mid-1970s. The truth is, pioneering singer-guitarists like Wanda Jackson and Sister Rosetta Tharpe were as instrumental as any male musician in helping rock’n’roll coalesce out of rockabilly, country, R&B, and blues in the 1950s. Jackson, nicknamed “The Queen of Rockabilly,” even toured with—and dated—Elvis when she was a teenager.\n\nThe best introduction to Jackson’s early work is Rockin’ With Wanda!, an exhilarating compilation of two-minute masterpieces that showcase her remarkable range. There’s the plaintive country balladry of “Sinful Heart,” the proto-girl-group hearts and flowers of “A Date With Jerry,” and clap-along jump rope jams like “You’re the One for Me.” But her charisma really shines on her fastest, toughest, most boastful tracks. Along with her famous novelty single “Fujiyama Mama” (a big hit in Japan, despite its distasteful references to Hiroshima and Nagasaki), “Hot Dog! That Made Him Mad” and “Don’a Wan’a” were the riot grrrl anthems of their day. –Judy Berman\n\nListen: Wanda Jackson: “Rock Your Baby”\n\n195.\n\nNilsson: Aerial Ballet (1968)\n\nHarry Nilsson’s third LP, Aerial Ballet, is where his work shifts irrevocably, moving from the quirky psychedelic pop that was tapering off in the late 1960s into the more naturalistic singer-songwriter style of the looming ’70s.\n\nBy the time Aerial was released, Nilsson hadn’t scored a hit for himself, but he had written mind-bending, orchestral songs for the Shangri-Las, the Turtles, and the Monkees. But the more low-key aspects of Aerial Ballet reflect the soft rock that would become increasingly popular in the next few years. Ironically, the album’s two most famous tracks are a cover of Fred Neil’s “Everybody’s Talkin’” and Nilsson’s own “One,” which the rock group Three Dog Night would turn into a major smash soon after. Both songs are the perfect encapsulations of Nilsson’s unusual yet direct approach to making music: embedding lyrical gut-punches into catchy folk-pop riffs and experimental production techniques. Even before Nilsson made his mark as one of the most coveted songwriters of his generation, Aerial Ballet served as a snapshot of the unconventional style that would make him a cult icon. –Cameron Cook\n\nListen: Nilsson: “One”\n\n194.\n\nDonald Byrd: A New Perspective (1964)\n\nIn 1963, Donald Byrd, already a leading light of bebop as a trumpeter and bandleader, set out to make what he called “an entire album of spiritual-like pieces.” The result was A New Perspective, a sort of symphony in five movements that incorporated blues, doo-wop, and even opera into its more conspicuous hard bop and liturgical influences. Brought to life by an ensemble that included a young Herbie Hancock and a sizable choir, A New Perspective is often dominated by the haunting, otherworldly passages Byrd wrote for its fluid female voices. But unlike other bop compositions of the era, which drew on popular melodies and forms as grist for improvisation, A New Perspective incorporated its hard bop forays into an ambitious art-music framework closer in structure to a classical oratorio like Handel’s Messiah. It’s perhaps one of the purest embodiments of Nina Simone’s famous assertion that the innovative project categorized as “jazz” might better be characterized as “black classical music.” –Edwin “STATS” Houghton\n\nListen: Donald Byrd: “Elijah”\n\n193.\n\nThe Beach Boys: Surfer Girl (1963)\n\nAfter worshipping waves, babes, and automobiles for two records, the Beach Boys began to look inward on Surfer Girl. Thanks to the success of Surfin’ USA and “Surf City,” a No. 1 track written for their SoCal pop peers Jan and Dean, Capitol allowed Brian Wilson to produce an entire Beach Boys record for the first time; he pulled out all the stops, introducing string arrangements and more session players into the group’s sound.\n\nThough Surfer Girl contains “Catch a Wave,” “Little Deuce Coupe,” and other songs about the Californian myth, two moments emerge as more searching masterpieces. One is the title track, a sleepy love ballad and a sincere expression of longing that portrays the ocean as a delicate place where “love could grow.” And “In My Room” moves even deeper into Wilson’s vulnerability, with nary a mention of romance. Instead, it pays tribute to the sanctuary of the childhood bedroom, a place where Brian and his brothers could escape their abusive father/manager, Murry Wilson, and sing together in peace. In these breaks from the Beach Boys’ pop gaiety, Wilson began to probe the wistfulness at his core, hinting at further genius to come. –Quinn Moreland\n\nListen: The Beach Boys: “In My Room”\n\n192.\n\nLink Wray & the Wraymen: Link Wray & the Wraymen (1960)\n\nYou can’t quite call Link Wray’s debut album his signature effort, since his first and most famous garage-rock single, “Rumble,” isn’t on it. But his next three subsequent, equally great singles are, as well as a tune called “Ramble” that’s basically a self rip-off of “Rumble.” Add a ripping rockabilly jam called “Raw-Hide,” a few homecoming-dance-worthy rock numbers complete with swinging horns, and some more solid originals, and what could’ve sounded like a hodgepodge turns out to be a dead-spot-free display of Wray’s talents.\n\nMost of Link Wray & the Wraymen bears a distinct sonic style that’s still influential today—especially Wray’s high-octane riffs, which basically invented the power chord. The album is also a charming family affair—brothers Vernon (rhythm guitar) and Doug (drums) were Wraymen—though Link’s the clear sonic leader, making the case for a Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction that somehow still hasn’t happened. But the list of Hall-of-Famers who worship him—Dylan, Townshend, Page, Springsteen—is testament enough to his power. –Marc Masters\n\nListen: Link Wray and the Wraymen: “Raw-Hide”\n\n191.\n\nAmon Düül II: Phallus Dei (1969)\n\nAmon Düül began as a radical art commune in Munich, one whose extended jam sessions were open to all. Soon, the most musically adept members went their own way, and this splinter group made their debut with Phallus Dei. In Latin, the title means “God’s Penis”—as statements of intent go, this is certainly up there. Krautrock didn’t exist yet, but 1969 was the year when the political, musical, and social currents running through the German counterculture began to coalesce into actual recorded music.\n\nPink Floyd and Hawkwind are obvious touchstones, though Amon Düül II felt distinct from much of the prog in the UK or U.S., their music unprissy and shot through with a primal weirdness. “Kanaan” weaves together Eastern scales, rolling hand percussion, and the operatic keening of Renate Knaup into something mystic and heavy, while “Dem Guten, Schönen, Wahren” is a hallucinogenic nightmare of delirious falsetto vocals, curdled acid-folk, and beer-hall chanting. And the title track is 20 minutes of gale-force psych and mangled violin that resembles a Germanic Velvet Underground. –Louis Pattison\n\nListen: Amon Düül II: “Dem Guten, Schönen, Wahren”\n\n190.\n\nJudy Collins: Wildflowers (1967)\n\nWildflowers sets three of Judy Collins’ songs alongside covers of Leonard Cohen and Joni Mitchell, and her take on Mitchell’s “Both Sides Now” turned into the hit that launched this album up the charts. Though a product of the acoustic guitar-favoring Greenwich Village folk scene, Collins was by this point singing over lush orchestral arrangements, with sweet choruses of clarinet and flute complementing the effortless formality of her own voice. It’s that formality that can be a stumbling block to enjoying an album like this some half a century later, but Collins’ powdery femininity is ultimately an impeccable match for the tender naturalism that fills the lyrics of her songs, where love stories play out amid images of “lilies and lace” and “amethyst fountains.” –Thea Ballard\n\nListen: Judy Collins: “Sky Fell”\n\n189.\n\nThe Cannonball Adderley Quintet: Mercy, Mercy, Mercy! Live at “The Club” (1966)\n\nWhile Cannonball Adderley may be the bandleader on Mercy, Mercy, Mercy! Live at “The Club,” the record is arguably as much a showcase for his brother’s songwriting and playing. Nat Adderley wrote the two opening numbers, “Fun” and “Games,” which are hard bop at its most enthusiastic and mercurial; his playing is appropriately ecstatic, buoyed by joy into gymnastic flights and contortions. The focus also inevitably drifts to pianist Joe Zawinul, three years before he played the sustained organ notes that opened the title track of Miles Davis’ In a Silent Way; here, his composition “Mercy, Mercy, Mercy” merges soul and jazz in the hybrid timbre of his electric piano. But it’s the polyphonic sense of play in the group’s improvisations, particularly in Cannonball’s solos, that lends the session its aura of excitability and invention. It doesn’t matter that it wasn’t actually recorded at a club but in a Los Angeles studio, to which they invited a small crowd: It only contributes to the feeling that this record, from start to finish, was produced in a totally imaginative space. –Brad Nelson\n\nListen: The Cannonball Adderley Quintet: “Introduction/Fun”\n\n188.\n\nDave Van Ronk: Folksinger (1963)\n\nDave Van Ronk was a ubiquitous figure of Greenwich Village folk culture, one so essential and deeply rooted that he struggled to attract ears beyond it. Ironically, it was a scene he never quite fit into, literally or figuratively: A 6-foot-5 Swede and early mentor to Bob Dylan, the dive-bar philosopher cast a keen ear to blues traditions instead of Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger’s acoustic, Americana strums.\n\nOn Folksinger, Van Ronk’s somber masterstroke, he filters plaintive 12-bar traditionals through jazzy folk paces and a mournful yet bristling growl. His crawl through the standard “Hang Me, Oh Hang Me” is almost oppressively intimate, its spare fingerpicked guitar and slow-pooling croon as stifling as the solitude he’s succumbing to. His soulful yet chatty pass through “Cocaine Blues” brings a modern sheen to the addict’s tale, rivaling Dylan’s reedier, less convincing turn. For such troubles, Joan Baez called him “the closest living offshoot of Leadbelly,” while the Coen brothers loosely based Inside Llewyn Davis on him, finally giving this perennial outsider his due. –Stacey Anderson\n\nListen: Dave Van Ronk: “Hang Me, Oh Hang Me”\n\n187.\n\nJefferson Airplane: Surrealistic Pillow (1967)\n\nSurrealistic Pillow is to San Francisco what The Velvet Underground & Nico is to New York: an iconic album that captures a city’s sound circa the Summer of Love. Surrealistic Pillow finds the band compiling their cornerstones of crunchy psychedelia, languid blues, and freewheeling jamming—but this time, they have Grace Slick, a femme fatale alto with the fury of a valkyrie. Coupled with Rick Jarrard’s Spectorian production, melodically top-heavy and immediate, Slick’s jagged hooks on “Somebody to Love” and “White Rabbit” earned Jefferson Airplane their reputation as the first big San Francisco band. Surrealistic Pillow is high-definition psychedelia that’s both exotic and approachable. –Zoe Camp\n\nListen: Jefferson Airplane: “Today”\n\n186.\n\nThe Kinks: Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire) (1969)\n\nArthur could’ve been the Kinks’ Tommy. Commissioned to accompany a teleplay co-written by frontman Ray Davies, it was forced to stand on its own after the TV movie was scrapped. So instead of a zeitgeist multimedia experience, this follow-up to The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society became the band’s second great, quintessentially English concept album in as many years.\n\nIn a 1970 interview, Davies joked that Arthur was “about the rise and fall of the British Empire, which people tend to associate me with,” and he told that story through the eyes of a character based on his brother-in-law, Arthur Anning. After opening with the soaring “Victoria,” a rock monument to the Queen’s bygone Britain, the carpetlayer’s tale descends into the horrors of the World Wars on “Some Mother’s Son” and “Mr. Churchill Says.” Its centerpiece is a one-two punch of sarcasm on “Australia,” a sing-along escape anthem, and “Shangri-La,” a folk hymn to suburban consumerism. But while Davies is barbed, he still shows a grudging empathy for his countrymen, lending an undertone of sweetness to a history lesson that could have come off as merely bitter. –Judy Berman\n\nListen: The Kinks: “Brainwashed”\n\n185.\n\nCharles Mingus: Mingus Plays Piano (1963)\n\nFew humans were ever able to wrestle melody out of an upright bass or command a cacophonous jazz band like Charles Mingus—though all that is basically irrelevant on this album of solo piano works. The idea seems a bit incongruous, like if Eddie Van Halen decided to release an oboe-only record in his prime, but Mingus was no dilettante on the keys. At a young age, he was mentored on the instrument by the quick-fingered jazz titan Art Tatum, and this album of originals, reinterpretations, and spontaneous performances adds another dimension to his staggering talent.\n\nUnlike Mingus’ full-band albums and shows, which could be rambunctious affairs that teetered on the precipice of chaos, Mingus Plays Piano is gorgeously spare, incorporating elements of jazz, blues, and his beloved classical music. Opener “Myself When I Am Real” was largely made up on the spot, a shapeshifting ballad that doubles as a spiritual portrait of Mingus’ own creativity. Elsewhere, there are skewed standards, quiet confessionals, and an eight-and-a-half minute ode to Mingus’ America, a complex and troubling place where black men like him were often left out. The record’s haunted soul still speaks to artists like Blood Orange’s Dev Hynes, who sampled “Myself When I Am Real” to introduce his own profound and personal treatise on being black in America, Freetown Sound. Truth, beauty, liberty—it’s all here. Unadorned. –Ryan Dombal\n\nListen: Charles Mingus: “I Can’t Get Started”\n\n184.\n\nBBC Radiophonic Workshop: BBC Radiophonic Music (1968)\n\nThe BBC Radiophonic Workshop was founded in 1958 as a space in which composers, musicians, and engineers experimented with techniques for producing sound under the auspices of soundtracking BBC programming. Released a decade into the Workshop’s tenure, this compilation collects 31 short works by Delia Derbyshire, David Cain, and John Baker. Though these pieces were designed for functional use in broadcast programming, taken together, they present a view of the strange, brilliant sonic terrain being forged at the Workshop.\n\nMany of these pieces are essentially jingles, driven by lilting melodies, but even the most cloying of tunes are uncanny in their construction, featuring experimental techniques ranging from musique concrète tape-collage to recording and sampling odd everyday sounds. Derbyshire dips into the weird, particularly, and her work would prove invaluable to generations of electronic experimentalists who followed her, including Aphex Twin and the Chemical Brothers. She relishes in new sounds and unsettling melodic forms; the metallic clatter and modulated vocals of a track like her “Ziwzih Ziwzih OO-OO-OO” anticipates the twists that pop would soon take. –Thea Ballard\n\nListen: John Baker: “Milky Way”\n\n183.\n\nMickey Newbury: Looks Like Rain (1969)\n\nAccording to the chorus of Willie Nelson and Waylon Jenning’s song “Luckenbach, Texas (Back to the Basics of Love),” the Holy Trinity of country music includes Willie himself, Hank Williams, and the somewhat lesser-known Mickey Newbury. The latter’s 1969 album Looks Like Rain might get chalked up as a record by a songwriter’s songwriter, but his music served as an offering to pop, soul, and country singers alike: Jennings, Kenny Rogers, Solomon Burke, Roy Orbison, and Jerry Lee Lewis all covered his songs. He became the spiritual forefather for the outlaw country movement, and later for indie singers like Bill Callahan and Will Oldham. Here, Newbury accompanies his songs of unbearable heartbreak with acoustic guitar, but he also couches them in church choirs and sitar, as well as the sounds of chimes, rain, and distant trains, creating a singular album that might best be described as ambient country. –Andy Beta\n\nListen: Mickey Newbury: “San Francisco Mabel Joy”\n\n182.\n\nThe Soft Machine: The Soft Machine (1968)\n\nSoft Machine’s self-titled debut album is a Rosetta Stone for adventurous rock music. The British band’s founding lineup—bassist and baritone vocalist Kevin Ayers, shirtless drummer and devastating high tenor singer Robert Wyatt, organist Mike Ratledge, and Australian guitarist Daevid Allen—ranked alongside Pink Floyd in London’s psychedelic underground. After visa issues forced Allen out, the remaining trio toured with the Jimi Hendrix Experience and finally cut an LP with Hendrix’s producer.\n\nThe Soft Machine unites psych-rock frenzy with modern-jazz improvisation, a refreshingly new idea at the time, and the joyful medley kicked off by opener “Hope for Happiness” still breathes with discovery. Better yet is the Ayers-led “We Did It Again,” a brutishly minimalist link between the Kinks’ “You Really Got Me” and krautrock’s motorik that could stretch out to a trance-inducing 40 minutes live. Today, the Soft Machine are known as pioneers of prog-rock, jazz fusion, and the Canterbury scene, and their members have enjoyed fruitful avant-garde careers. This debut captures a pregnant moment when all paths remained open. –Marc Hogan\n\nListen: The Soft Machine: “Hope for Happiness”\n\n181.\n\nLesley Gore: I’ll Cry If I Want To (1963)\n\nLesley Gore’s debut album, which she began recording when she was just 16, follows a party attended by a teenage love triangle: herself, her beau Johnny, and that interloper Judy. For a record that kicks off with seven songs about sobbing, I’ll Cry If I Want To maintains an impressively consistent, candied sweetness throughout; produced by Quincy Jones, the album epitomizes the sound of early-1960s girl-group pop, airtight in structure as it soars, dreamy-eyed, through tales of young love and loss. Gore eases through shimmery choruses and lovelorn ballads, but she also embraces despair, spite, and other less lovely parts of being a young woman. Before she released the second-wave feminist anthem “You Don’t Own Me,” Gore was, in a way, already carving out room for women within the narrow parameters of girl-group femininity. –Thea Ballard\n\nListen: Lesley Gore: “Cry Me a River”\n\n180.\n\nWilson Pickett: The Exciting Wilson Pickett (1966)\n\nDespite his charismatically gruff vocals and emphatic style, Wilson Pickett was just one more struggling R&B singer until Atlantic Records sent him down to Stax studios in 1965. There, he recorded his career-making “In the Midnight Hour” and “634-5789 (Soulsville U.S.A.),” among other hits. But Pickett alienated his fellow musicians in Memphis, to the point where Stax president Jim Stewart nixed further recording there. So the singer trekked even further south to Muscle Shoals, Ala., where he recorded at the legendary FAME Studio.\n\nPickett’s third album chronicles that journey, playing like a battle between the Stax house band and the FAME crew. The edge may go to the Alabamans, mostly for Roger Hawkins’ relentless drums on “Land of 1,000 Dances,” but as a whole The Exciting Wilson Pickett helped distinguish Southern soul as grittier, rawer, and more immediate than its northern and Midwestern counterparts. The album established Pickett as a major star, a compelling bandleader who could mold these dynamic groups into his own vision. –Stephen M. Deusner\n\nListen: Wilson Pickett: “You’re So Fine”\n\n179.\n\nArt Ensemble of Chicago: Message to Our Folks (1969)\n\nIn the spring of 1969, Lester Bowie moved his band, the Art Ensemble, to Paris. To afford the tickets, the Chicago trumpeter sold his furniture. “He put an ad in the [Chicago] Defender,” collaborator Roscoe Mitchell recalled in 2015. “‘Musician sells out.’” By July, the group found itself at the Pan African Cultural Festival, where they rubbed elbows with other avant-garde jazz composers, Nina Simone, and the Black Panther Party leader Eldridge Cleaver. Message to Our Folks was compiled during an intense week of recording sessions in the French capital with musicians the Art Ensemble met at the festival. Equal parts gospel, bebop, and abstract dissonance, Message pays homage to jazz music’s foundation while reaching for outer space, offering a shining example of unfiltered black art and compelling Afrofuturist music in the vein of Sun Ra. The Art Ensemble’s music remains difficult to grasp, but the spirit of it—the complex sonic arrangements, the “all for one” ethos—can be heard in modern-day jazz leaders like Kamasi Washington and Shabaka Hutchings. –Marcus J. Moore\n\nListen: The Art Ensemble of Chicago: “Old Time Religion”\n\n178.\n\nWendy Carlos: Switched-On Bach (1968)\n\nThe earliest electronic music was equal parts experimental art and temperamental science project. When Wendy Carlos recorded this suite of Bach pieces, she could only play around one measure at a time before her delicate synthesizer fell out of tune. She worked with inventor Robert Moog himself to build her prototype, a decade before touch-sensitive keyboards became standard.\n\nThe nuance of Carlos’ playing here feels miraculous: “Prelude and Fugue No. 7” manages to segue from crystallized harmony to dainty counterpoint, while “Jesu, Joy of Man’s Desiring” sheds its usual stately ceremony, trilling the melody like a bird. Switched-On Bach sold more copies than any previous classical album, bringing a mass audience to an alien medium. Her choice of material had its strange logic: Writing to glorify God, Bach often composed with no particular instrument in mind. He never heard a synth’s unearthly tones, or a drum machine’s divine precision, but his notes reveal the beauty of every device. Long before music melted into data, Carlos presided over a kind of transcendence. –Chris Randle\n\n177.\n\nHerbie Hancock: Empyrean Isles (1964)\n\nPianist Herbie Hancock was already an elite jazz session player when he led this set for Blue Note. Trumpeter Freddie Hubbard had likewise distinguished himself as a post-bop player with an edge by working with drummer Art Blakey and avant-garde reed player Eric Dolphy. Here, joined by some of Hancock’s rhythm section colleagues from Miles Davis’ quintet, they could have turned any group of tunes into one hell of an album.\n\nBut Hancock was also hard at work on his compositional craft. His four original pieces on Empyrean Isles prompt motifs based on brisk chord changes as well as scale-based improvisation. Nearly two decades before his embrace of turntablism on “Rockit,” Hancock was already signaling his intention to swing between radically different formal designs. –Seth Colter Walls\n\nListen: Herbie Hancock: “One Finger Snap”\n\n176.\n\nTownes Van Zandt: Townes Van Zandt (1969)\n\nIn the late 1960s, when he was a hard-luck troubadour gigging around Texas and Tennessee, Townes Van Zandt was something of a cult figure: a songwriter already being likened to the great Hank Williams by admirers like Emmylou Harris. Such a comparison cuts both ways, emphasizing the graceful economy of his lyrics and the Hill Country lonesomeness in his vocals, but also acknowledging the self-destructive tendencies that ultimately undermined his career.\n\nOn Van Zandt’s third record, he was still figuring himself out, so he took another go at “For the Sake of the Song,” the title track from his 1968 album about a woman who won’t stop singing sad songs to her old man. He similarly recut “I’ll Be Here in the Morning” and “Waiting Around to Die,” the latter arguably the saddest outlaw defense country music has devised. He largely dispenses with the florid arrangements of his previous albums, stripping every song down to its essentials: his dexterous picking, that glorious Lone Star warble, and the occasional flourish of flute or pedal steel. Like all of his records, this one failed to find anything resembling a mainstream audience, but so many years later, it has become the bedrock of his legacy. –Stephen M. Deusner\n\nListen: Townes Van Zandt: “Columbine”\n\n175.\n\nElla Fitzgerald / Count Basie: Ella and Basie! (1963)\n\nTruly, the album should be called Ella and Basie and Quincy. Count Basie and Ella Fitzgerald had been winding around each other in elegant, wayward jazz-royalty circles for a few years, but it took a young Quincy Jones, then under Basie’s wing, to pull these two forces into the same orbit for a full album. Together, they cut one of the most enduring and beloved records to bear either Fitzgerald’s or Basie’s name. Jones’ arrangements make the off-kilter chemistry between Fitzgerald and Basie’s band crackle to life: As musicians, they had almost too much in common. The horns in his band punched with a lead singer’s brio, while she sang like a horn, winding and unpredictable, the words mere containers for the sounds she made.\n\nFitzgerald’s trail of records is long and studded with forgettables, but on Ella and Basie!, she is at her peak—mercurial, tart, apple-wry. She worms her way into the deep pockets of space that Basie’s band leaves for her on “Them There Eyes” and wails her way into the stratosphere, sounding drunk on the possibilities open before them. –Jayson Greene\n\nListen: Ella Fitzgerald & Count Basie: “Tea for Two”\n\n174.\n\nPatty Waters: Sings (1965)\n\nThe first side of Patty Waters’ debut album offers seven short, subdued tunes intoned solemnly over hushed piano playing—masterful but easy to miss, given what happens on the other side. As Burton Greene, the pianist who accompanied Waters, put it, “Patty kept going on with the ballad routine. I thought, this chick is sitting on a big egg; this egg is going to be some kind of monster, and I’ve got to help her hatch that egg.”\n\nThat egg turns out to be a 14-minute interpretation of the traditional song “Black Is the Color of My True Love’s Hair,” and Waters cracks it wide open. After a few minutes spent meditating on the melody, accompanied by Greene’s trio, she unleashes every tone and noise her voice can conjure. Her burning strangulations of the word “black” are so direct and bracing, she seems predict the fury soon to erupt in anti-war protests and riots around America. But she also taps into something universal: the extreme energy and emotions that only artistic freedom can access. –Marc Masters\n\nListen: Patty Waters: “Why Can’t I Come to You”\n\n173.\n\nDuke Ellington: Far East Suite (1967)\n\nIs this a linked “suite,” or just a bunch of songs? Does it really carry a significant “far east” influence? These questions are fun to ponder, though the answers aren’t hugely consequential. Because what Far East Suite does offer is one of the pianist’s large ensembles in a set of music co-composed with the Duke’s longtime collaborator, Billy Strayhorn. Which means it is automatically part of one of the most exalted catalogs in American music. During “Bluebird of Delhi (Mynha),” a clarinet theme that may seem slight at first ends up taking majestic flight over the ensemble’s delirious riffs. And the ballad “Isfahan,” a feature tailored by Ellington and Strayhorn for the altoist Johnny Hodges, has long been recognized as a tour de force saxophone performance. Ellington created some essential music after Strayhorn died later that year, but this final moment in their long collaboration is a pinnacle of their poetically swinging genius. –Seth Colter Walls\n\nListen: Duke Ellington: “Isfahan”\n\n172.\n\nEddie Palmieri: Justicia (1969)\n\nThe montuno—the interlocked bass and percussion groove of Cuban son music—has been convincingly ID’ed as the sonic godfather of the drum-and-bass breaks that characterize American funk. Eddie Palmieri’s 1960s releases reunited these divided streams. Justicia represents the peak of this period, combining the latest Cuban dance craze (a rhythm known simply as “Mozambique”) with elements of blues, soul, and psychedelic rock: the ahead-of-its-time “My Spiritual Indian” wanders around a hypnotic, bluesy chord before descending into a sublime Afro-funk groove augmented by Thelonious Monk-inspired piano work. “Verdict on Judge Street” pushes Palmieri’s jazz conceits even further, building up plonky, dissonant ghost notes that trip over each other in contradictory rhythms yet still remain danceable.\n\nTying these elements together is Justicia’s unapologetically activist vision and the soulcat slang of late ’60s pro-black, anti-colonial street protests; it peppers the English portions of the LP’s mostly Spanish lyrics. There are clunky moments, like Palmieri’s somewhat wooden vocal cadence on the spoken-word “Everything Is Everything,” a sort of English-language key to both the album’s politics and its kitchen-sink genre fusion. Yet Justicia remains a formidable testament to Palmieri’s inventive powers. –Edwin “STATS” Houghton\n\nListen: Eddie Palmieri: “My Spiritual Indian”\n\n171.\n\nVarious Artists: Golden Rain (1969)\n\nKecak (pronounced “ket-chak”) is a percussive Balinese chant performed by some 100 men squatting in concentric circles, all hooting and hollering in simian syncopation. Although rooted in an exorcism ritual that dramatizes a monkey-filled tale from the ancient Hindu epic The Ramayana, the music and dance performance is a relatively modern phenomenon dating to the 1930s. Self-described “musical tourist” David Lewiston included a kecak track on all three albums of Balinese field recordings he released on Nonesuch, but the 22-minute side B of 1969’s Golden Rain is the iconic example.\n\nLewiston taped performances in all their messy vitality, achieving an in-the-moment energy more reminiscent of jazz or punk than lab-coated ethnomusicology. Golden Rain’s “The Ramayana Monkey Dance” remains as astounding now as it must have been for late-night FM audiences. The first side of the compilation is given over to two luminously chiming tracks of gamelan, the trance-like Indonesian traditional music played on marimba-like gongs. The Paris Exposition of 1889, when Claude Debussy encountered Javanese gamelan, has long been considered a turning point for modern music. For the vinyl era, Golden Rain stands as a similar epiphany. –Marc Hogan\n\nListen: Gamelan Gong Kebjar: “Oleg Tumililingan” (“Bumblebee”)\n\n170.\n\nRoland Kirk: The Inflated Tear (1967)\n\nHe was a showman, an eccentric, an advocate, and a scholar—but at the core of Roland Kirk’s appeal, there’s the staggering fact that his performance is the sound of one man harmonizing, thanks to his striking ability to play multiple horns at the same time. One of his earliest records for Atlantic, The Inflated Tear inaugurates his idea of jazz as what he, like Nina Simone, called “black classical music,” a wide-ranging tradition that included everything from the cutting-edge avant-garde to generations-old musical traditions to contemporary pop styles. He could start with a melodic and thematic premise as simple as the slow march of “The Black and Crazy Blues” or a base as familiar as Duke Ellington’s “Creole Love Call” and guide his band to places that tapped the deepest spaces of mood-altering sonics. The purity of lighthearted joy on the flute-led tribute to his young son, “A Laugh for Rory,” the manic giddiness of “Lovellevelliloqui”—it’s all overwhelming, so it’s even more of a rush when Kirk goes on one of his spectacular solo runs, like the Coltrane-rivaling tenor sax fusillade of “Many Blessings.” –Nate Patrin\n\nListen: Roland Kirk: “The Black and Crazy Blues”\n\n169.\n\nThe Sonics: Here Are the Sonics!!! (1965)\n\nRock’n’roll can be a lot of things, but for a certain snapshot of mid-’60s teenage delinquency—an inner world fueled by shaggy Rat Fink scuzziness and drive-in horror double features—the genre reached its ideal form in the Sonics. They weren’t necessarily the first garage rockers, but nobody embodied the style better, from the moment their debut single “The Witch” peeled fake woodgrain off speaker cabinets in 1964. The formula, as ruthlessly displayed on their 1965 debut LP Here Are the Sonics!!!, was simple: Make every instrument hit with the force of a brand new Pontiac GTO smashing through a guardrail. And if you’re going to get that raucous, make sure you’ve got a frontman like Jerry Roslie, whose range stretches from a demented bellow to an unhinged shriek—all in the service of songs about getting your kicks from drinking poison, tearing around in a “turn-on red” Mustang, and absolutely losing your mind over rejection. Throw in some rock and R&B standards performed as though they were all written by Screamin’ Jay Hawkins at his coffin-busting wildest, and you’ve got the big bang explosion that set the standard for everyone from the Cramps to Nirvana to the White Stripes. –Nate Patrin\n\nListen: The Sonics: “The Witch”\n\n168.\n\nThe Peter Brötzmann Octet: Machine Gun (1968)\n\nWhen hard-blowing free jazz reaches a certain intensity, you start to wonder how far it can go and what its limitations of expression might be. Machine Gun is one idea of how such an impassable sonic barrier might present itself. On it, the German saxophonist Peter Brötzmann and seven fellow improvisors—including British saxophonist Evan Parker and Dutch drummer Han Bennink, who would all make a serious mark in European free jazz—are still tethered to jazz proper, with variations on themes and melody and groove, but the result sounds closer to what we now call noise music.\n\nMachine Gun is a roaring mass of energy that serves as an auditory Rorschach test: Given its title and its initial release during a violent, tumultuous, and war-wrecked year, the album can easily inspire fear, horror, and images of violence. But its spirit of collective invention, and the sheer delight of musicians pushing their instruments beyond their design, also yields an equally vivid joy. It’s the sound of eight creative people confronting musical barriers and working together to annihilate them. –Mark Richardson\n\nListen: Peter Brötzmann: “Machine Gun”\n\n167.\n\nThe Impressions: Keep On Pushing (1964)\n\nWith “Keep On Pushing,” penned in the middle of the civil rights movement, Curtis Mayfield channeled his gospel roots into a moment of motivation. The song’s message of strength and persistence had been stewing in him his whole life—a meditation on love, faith, existing on the streets of segregated Chicago, and how he thought things ought to be. Aided by his bandmates Fred Cash and Sam Gooden’s harmonies, Johnny Pate’s horn arrangements, and of course, the warm flourishes of his electric guitar, Mayfield’s stunning falsetto exuded the power and strength he preached.\n\nKeep On Pushing was the Impressions’ first attempt at a proper album—their previous records were essentially singles collections. Every song is crafted just as beautifully as the title track, with Pate’s expert arrangements backing the trio’s earworm harmonies. Mayfield cements his soul icon status with songs about love affairs that are new (“Talking About My Baby”), forbidden (“I Ain’t Supposed To”), and gone (“Long, Long Winter”). And while Chicago blues is certainly present, gospel is the key ingredient. One year after Martin Luther King, Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech, the Impressions’ version of the spiritual standard “Amen” is arranged as a march. Mayfield’s first proper LP with the Impressions hinted at the artistic intent that would follow: Not long after its release, the Impressions would further soundtrack the movement with “People Get Ready,” “We’re a Winner,” and several other classics. With Keep On Pushing, Mayfield became a star, and it was just the beginning. –Evan Minsker\n\nListen: The Impressions: “Keep on Pushing”\n\n166.\n\nThe Byrds: The Notorious Byrd Brothers (1968)\n\nIn 1968, the Byrds could be described as Sgt. Pepper’s-curious: a band longing for experimentation but still in touch with their jangly roots. There are moments when they sound like a conservative dad’s worst nightmare: aloof, stoned, and gently rebelling. “Things that seemed to be solid are not,” goes one trippy line from “Change Is Now,” and the song’s guitar solo is the sound of thousands of high school longhairs being threatened with military service. But for every early, intrepid use of a Moog synthesizer, there’s something like the gentle cover of Gerry Goffin and Carole King’s “Goin’ Back,” which came with its own confession: “A little bit of courage is all we lack.” The Notorious Byrd Brothers catches the band in a space between, it’s the sound of psychedelic pop’s sugars fermenting, but not yet turning into alcohol. –Andrew Gaerig\n\nListen: The Byrds: “Dolphin’s Smile”\n\n165.\n\nSonny Rollins: The Bridge (1962)\n\nAfter releasing over 20 albums from 1953 to 1959, Sonny Rollins found himself being named in the same breath as John Coltrane and Miles Davis. But at the height of his fame, the tenor saxophonist disappeared from the jazz scene. Convalescing from the stresses of addiction and success, he began practicing on the Williamsburg Bridge’s pedestrian walkway, far from the peering eyes of the world (save the chance passerby).\n\nThose three years of meditations led to The Bridge, an album that turns panoramic NYC vistas into ballads and bop of utmost soul. Stylistically, the record doesn’t veer far from the hard bop of Rollins’ celebrated 1956 LP Saxophone Colossus, but it digs a little deeper. The nimble title track, in particular, is a snapshot of his new level of control as his solo winds through a series of tempo changes. While his peers started to explore the structural limits of the genre with free jazz in the early ’60s, Rollins went further into what he knew, into himself, discovering a fount of grace in the process. –Kevin Lozano\n\nListen: Sonny Rollins: “The Bridge”\n\n164.\n\nThe Beatles: A Hard Day’s Night (1964)\n\nBeatlemania was well underway when the Fab Four created A Hard Day’s Night; they were also simultaneously filming their first feature, and the flurry of activity forced the songwriting team of John Lennon and Paul McCartney to focus on cranking out their first album of original tunes. Some tracks echo their earlier songs and influences—girl groups, Motown, and even Tin Pan Alley—but by synthesizing these sounds, the Beatles wound up with a style that felt like the start of something new. It’s not just the songs, it’s the grace notes: the double-tracked vocals on “Any Time at All,” the country-rock gait of “I’ll Cry Instead,” the 12-string George Harrison wields throughout. The album also opened the floodgates for all the beat groups and blues combos lying in wait in the UK, ready to cross the Atlantic once America was ready to hear them. Every band in the British Invasion owes a debt not just to the Beatles but to A Hard Day’s Night specifically: It is the record that created a whole new world. –Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\nListen: The Beatles: “Can’t Buy Me Love”\n\n163.\n\nBig Brother & the Holding Company: Cheap Thrills (1968)\n\nJanis Joplin proved she was an electrifying performer at the Monterey Pop festival, but she didn’t cement her legend until the next year, on the fourth track of Big Brother & the Holding Company’s major-label debut. “Piece of My Heart” is spare for a Big Brother track, with Sam Andrew and James Gurley’s rock guitars forced into the background by Joplin’s annihilating vocals. She squeezes out the chorus as though she is about to tear open her chest cavity.\n\nLike the rest of Cheap Thrills, “Piece of My Heart” derives some of its power from John Simon’s canny production. By adding crowd noises to Big Brother’s studio recordings, he creates the impression that Joplin was fronting San Francisco’s rowdiest bar band—climbing up on a table, beer mug in hand, to howl about heartbreak to an audience of emotional drunks. On “Turtle Blues,” a ballad that mingles old-school blues piano with nimble guitar riffs, you can hear a glass shatter. The first 10 seconds of “Ball and Chain,” which transforms Big Mama Thornton’s classic into a languid acid-rock jam, sound like a false start. These moments could have felt like gimmicks if Joplin’s sincerity and fervor hadn’t endowed the album with such intimacy. –Judy Berman\n\nListen: Big Brother and the Holding Company: “Combination of the Two”\n\n162.\n\nDr. John: Gris-Gris (1968)\n\nMac Rebennack was far from the bayou in 1968. As a session musician in Los Angeles, he sat in with Frank Zappa, Phil Spector, and the Wrecking Crew at the height of the city’s psychedelic heyday, before the Manson family murders cast a pall over the Laurel Canyon dream. But despite being recorded in Spector’s favorite studio, Gold Star, not a sliver of local sun cuts through the mist of Gris-Gris, Rebennack’s debut album as his voodoo-inspired persona Dr. John the Nite Tripper. It’s a direct portal to his hometown of New Orleans, a sinewy swamp-funk jam that simmers together Afro-Caribbean percussion, earthy congas, whirling electric guitars, and pernicious flutes. Dr. John proves instantly at ease on opener “Gris-Gris Gumbo Ya Ya,” purring as he proclaims himself “the last of the best” medicine men, a French Quarter Rasputin as shifty as he is seductive. From there, he offers a collection of eccentric pleasures—aural charms and amulets amassed to foster luck and ward off evil spirits. –Stacey Anderson\n\nListen: Dr. John: “Gris-Gris Gumbo Ya Ya”\n\n161.\n\nWhite Noise: An Electric Storm (1969)\n\nOn November 23, 1963, one day after the assassination of JFK, British TV viewers were treated to their first episode of “Doctor Who,” an iconic TV series that would introduce not only the wonders of time travel and lo-fi monsters but also the sonic joys of early electronic music, thanks to the work of the fabled sound effects unit the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. Five years later, Radiophonic composers Delia Derbyshire and Brian Hodgson joined classical bass player David Vorhaus in White Noise, an experimental electronic act avant la lettre.\n\nTheir debut album, An Electric Storm, is astonishingly original. Side A is ostensibly in the lineage of ’60s psychedelic pop, home to the same darkly experimental melodic instincts that drove early Pink Floyd or the United States of America. Here, though, the music is adorned with tape-spliced electronic collages and sound effects, from the scrabbled circus sounds on “Here Come the Fleas” to the unsettling—and very “Doctor Who”—electronic pulses on “Firebird,” which create the impression of shifting sonic sands beneath the listener’s feet. Side B, however, is something entirely new, a terrifying theatrical soundscape of ghastly sonic intensity. One year later, Kraftwerk would release their debut album, but the future of electronic music had already arrived. –Ben Cardew\n\nListen: White Noise: “Love Without Sound”\n\n160.\n\nPhil Ochs: I Ain’t Marching Anymore (1965)\n\nAesthetes who sneer at so-called “protest music” like to pretend that all songs with political agendas are strident statements of the obvious—sermons devoid of beauty, nuance, and especially humor. But Phil Ochs, a self-described “singing journalist” and a Dylan for the student-radical set, recorded some of the funniest, smartest, and prettiest tracks of the ’60s on his second album, I Ain’t Marching Anymore. The hilarious “Draft Dodger Rag” finds a would-be soldier telling the draft board he’s got epilepsy, a ruptured spleen, and, by the way, “I always carry a purse.” He also issues a scathing leftist critique of labor unions’ racism, over violently strummed acoustic guitar, on “Links on the Chain.”\n\nOchs’ most memorable songs make their points through poignant storytelling. The rousing title track is an allegory of a mythical soldier who’s spent over 150 years fighting for America and can no longer stomach imperialist violence. “Here’s to the State of Mississippi” closes the album with a vividly painted panorama of enforced ignorance, systemic bigotry, and police violence. These songs succeed as both art and political critique; it’s just unfortunate that, 50 years later, not one of them sounds like the relic of a less enlightened time. –Judy Berman\n\nListen: Phil Ochs: “I Ain’t Marching Anymore”\n\n159.\n\nRay Barretto: Acid (1968)\n\nAlthough not nearly as “out there” as its title and artwork suggest, Ray Barretto’s 1968 experiment in Nuyorican soul is nevertheless an essential trip. It’s a missing link between the insanely catchy yet quickly dated Latin boogaloo sound of the early ’60s—a New York phenomenon that Barretto helped take international with his hit “El Watusi”—and the more expansive, Afrocentric Latin sound of the 1970s. Its strongest soul/boogaloo tracks have a Memphis-via-Harlem swing that captures the fierce, aspirational joy of mid-’60s soul.\n\nStill, these moments are ultimately outshone by the pure, virtuosic salsa workout of “El Nuevo Barretto,” which opens the album. Its combination of Cuban roots and R&B vamping clearly foreshadows the more mainstream Latin rock of Carlos Santana. But if Acid is notable for its prophetic fusion, its real treasures—the bass-heavy, eight-minute jam “Espiritu Libre” and the minimalist title track, with its relentless Afro-Cuban drums—are not so much ahead of their time as they are removed from time, difficult to assign to a particular decade or hemisphere. –Edwin “STATS” Houghton\n\nListen: Ray Barretto: “Acid”\n\n158.\n\nAlice Coltrane: A Monastic Trio (1968)\n\nAlice Coltrane’s solo debut, A Monastic Trio, is also her tribute to her husband John Coltrane, who died the year before—a star-is-born/star-is-extinguished moment that remains unique in music. Anchored by Jimmy Garrison’s heavy bass frequencies, which take the modal structure of blues into something beyond it, its compositions sound like death. Coltrane’s resonant harp sets an ecstatic base for the strangled cries of Pharoah Sanders’ bass clarinet and tenor sax improvisations, and the album’s opening passages convey struggle and discord before giving way to celestial string trills and a lighter second side. Whether this sonic transformation is meant to embody John’s spiritual journey or Alice coming to terms with her grief, it is the rare instrumental album that is a difficult listen, both for the emotions it confronts and its willingness to push the boundaries of conventional music. It is equally difficult to forget. –Edwin “STATS” Houghton\n\nListen: Alice Coltrane: “Lord Help Me to Be”\n\n157.\n\nMerle Haggard: Mama Tried (1968)\n\nBy 1968, Merle Haggard had made a comfortable niche singing honky-tonk-influenced songs about tough stuff like being a drunk and going it alone. At sharp but comfortable odds with the orchestral dressings of late-’60s Nashville—“countrypolitan,” they called it—Mama Tried is an album of difficult situations described with frankness and care, where a man sings of remembering his father’s hands broken and bleeding from work or the sight of his mother bedridden with disease his family was too poor to treat. At no moment does Haggard perform with undue sentiment; at no moment is his sound calibrated for pity. If anything, there’s something dreadful about Haggard’s ability to get on with it. True believers in sin, his narrators don’t bother seeking absolution through song. They wait for God, and already have a pretty good idea of what God’ll say. Blame the career-defining title track for inspiring hundreds, possibly thousands of tattoos worn by people with a dozen stories to tell but no good way to say they’re sorry. –Mike Powell\n\nListen: Merle Haggard: “Folsom Prison Blues”\n\n156.\n\nOrnette Coleman Trio: Live at the “Golden Circle” Stockholm Vol. 1 (1965)\n\nOrnette Coleman’s music is a study in contradiction: He questioned structure and his ideas launched the free jazz revolution, but he also had an infallible ear for melodies you can hum. He developed densely theoretical justifications for his boundary-pushing music, but his tone and approach were indebted to early days spent playing blues and R&B in bars. He was greatly admired by virtuoso players, but he was drawn to untutored playing, whether via his own experiments on trumpet and violin or by recruiting his 10-year-old son to drum on a record. It was never possible to boil Coleman’s music down to one or two concerns, but so much of what made him remarkable can be heard on At the “Golden Circle” Stockholm Vol. 1.\n\nAfter an early run of quartet records with provocative titles (The Shape of Jazz to Come, Change of the Century, This Is Our Music), Coleman spent the rest of his career experimenting with instrumentation, arrangements, and settings. His 1965 tour of Europe found him performing in a trio with bassist David Izenzon and drummer Charles Moffett. With Coleman’s alto saxophone alone in front, he indulges his boundless melodic imagination, treating his new tunes like putty to be reshaped with each passing bar. His horn bellows, squeaks, and wails while also communicating on a microscopic level, with subtle shifts in phrasing and intonation that bring to mind the human voice. Golden Circle (and its equally fine, if further out, Vol. 2 companion) serves as both a terrific introduction to Coleman’s music and a towering highlight from his first decade. –Mark Richardson\n\nListen: Ornette Coleman Trio: “European Echoes”\n\n155.\n\nMoondog: Moondog (1969)\n\nThe release of Moondog’s second self-titled album followed a 12-year hiatus, though in that time the iconoclastic poet and musician certainly wasn’t silent: Installed, as always, in his Viking garb on the streets of New York, he was in the company of Beat poets and members of all corners of the city’s musical avant-garde. (He even lived with Philip Glass for a period.) This album sees him trading in the shuffling modesty of his older recordings for a series of fully realized micro-symphonies that nevertheless retain his loving, oddball spirit. Many songs double as tributes to artist friends and inspirations: “Witch of Endor” was composed for a Martha Graham ballet; “Symphonique 6 (Good for Goodie)” and its woodwind swing nods to Benny Goodman; and “Lament I, ‘Bird’s Lament’” pays tribute to Charlie Parker with a free-ranging alto sax solo. Leaning as much on the bombast of European classicism as it does on the new rhythms coming out of New York minimalism, Moondog absorbs the essence of an era while peering beyond it. –Thea Ballard\n\nListen: Moondog: “Bird’s Lament”\n\n154.\n\nThe Delfonics: La La Means I Love You (1968)\n\nFor most of the ’60s, soul music was defined by the pop-minded sounds of Detroit and the bluesier rhythms of Memphis, but with this album, Philadelphia elbowed its way to the table. Spearheaded by producer/conductor Thom Bell, the Delfonics’ fastidiously orchestrated debut introduced the world to an imagining of R&B so suave and gentlemanly, it made the tuxedoed crooners of Motown sound like motorcycle-riding bad boys. At a time when soul was becoming faster and funkier, this effortlessly smooth group made an album with two Burt Bacharach covers on it.\n\nThe Delfonics’ sound became the foundation for some of the best soul music of the early ’70s, much of it also recorded with Bell, including classics from the Spinners and the O’Jays. As durable as the template proved to be, though, few of the Philly soul full-lengths that followed cast quite the same spell as La La Means I Love You, nor committed so completely to its pristine, white-marble vision. It’s still impossible not to be swept away by the sheer decadence of it all. –Evan Rytlewski\n\nListen: The Delfonics: “Losing You”\n\n153.\n\nMax Roach: We Insist! Max Roach’s Freedom Now Suite (1960)\n\nIn 1959, drummer Max Roach and writer Oscar Brown Jr. began working on a civil rights-themed suite for jazz ensemble and chorus. They planned to debut it in 1963, in the 100th anniversary year of the Emancipation Proclamation. But when sit-in demonstrations against segregation began, Roach and his collaborator moved up their timetable. The urgency of the two 1960 recording sessions that resulted in We Insist! Max Roach’s Freedom Now Suite still prove dramatically gripping, just as the political themes that spurred the bebop drummer remain salient.\n\nOn “Driva’ Man,” Brown’s lyrics sketch the practices of sexual assault on plantations. Vocalist Abbey Lincoln handles Roach’s world-weary melody with defiant grace as saxophonist Coleman Hawkins projects mournfully. On the wordless “Triptych,” Lincoln creates a sense of drama and resolution by moving through textures of solemnity, rebellion, and repose. Whether in the company of a Nigerian percussionist (“All Africa”) or working with bop stylists like the trumpeter Booker Little, Roach’s playing is as sharp as his arrangements. By building successfully on jazz’s previous political messages (including Billie Holiday’s “Strange Fruit”), We Insist! played a catalyzing role in the music’s next decade of protest. –Seth Colter Walls\n\nListen: Max Roach: “All Africa”\n\n152.\n\nJacques Brel: Ces Gens-là (1965)\n\nJacques Brel defected from the bourgeoisie as a young man, abandoning his stuffy Belgian family for the cabaret nightclubs of 1950s Paris. By 1966, he was an international icon, packing concert halls in New York, London, and throughout the Soviet Union. That year, a dozen before his death, the master songwriter threatened to retire from music, but not before releasing Ces Gens-là, a slippery chanson classic. In charismatic vignettes, Brel presents a cast of flawed and unreliable narrators—jealous lovers, inspired drunks, would-be superstars. His theatrical delivery conceals intimate observations, and he exorcises his characters’ unrealized dreams just when we might question their motives. On the song “Jef,” strings lurch across a tightrope of discord, mirroring the precarious friendship between a heartbroken alcoholic and his stargazing, gutter-dwelling savior. On the title track, the narrator deliciously satirizes a family of bourgeois degenerates: imitates their porcine soup-slobbering, laments their impatience for a rich relative’s death. As strings part the sky, he announces the family’s gravest crime: forbidding his relationship with Frida, the family daughter. Was his vicious class commentary a farce? Either way, a final twist somewhat validates their reservations: Our narrator—passionate, lovably flawed—half-confesses to having slit cats’ throats. “They didn’t smell good,” he reasons. Brel could not, at the very least, be accused of writing stock characters. –Jazz Monroe\n\nListen: Jacques Brel: “Ces Gens-là”\n\n151.\n\nLa Monte Young / Marian Zazeela: The Black Record (1969)\n\nBy 1969, La Monte Young already had a significant influence on the trajectory of popular music. A guru of drone switched on by the hum of electrical generators and high winds that surrounded his childhood home in rural Idaho, come the early ’60s, Young had relocated to New York, where he founded the experimental performance group Theatre of Eternal Music. Among his players was a young John Cale; shortly after, Cale took up his viola as part of a downtown rock band called the Warlocks, soon to be renamed the Velvet Underground, and the rest is history.\n\nThe Theatre’s ’60s recordings have emerged only as bootlegs, so it’s the so-called Black Record—its unofficial name a reference to the calligraphed cover by Young’s wife, collaborator and fellow Theatre member Marian Zazeela—that stands as the earliest official example of Young’s recorded work. Handily, its two side-long tracks neatly encapsulate Young’s late-’60s process. Untethered from the 12-note Western music vocabulary, the pair experiments with long, droning pitches that seem to collapse time around them. On “31 VII 69 10:26-10:49 PM,” Young and Zazeela vocalize around a single glowing sine wave, while on the flip (“23 VIII 64 2:50:45-3:11 AM”) we hear a gong acquired from the sculptor Robert Morris played with a double bass bow. The result is a yawning metallic void that presages everything from Brian Eno’s ambient music to the amplifier armageddon of Sunn O))). –Louis Pattison\n\nListen: La Monte Young: “31 VII 69 10:26 - 10:49 PM / 23 VIII 64 2:50:45 - 3:11 AM The Volga Delta”\n\n150.\n\nJohn Coltrane: Olé Coltrane (1961)\n\nOlé Coltrane is a curious record in John Coltrane’s career. It’s his last session as a bandleader for Atlantic; it features one of his largest ensembles, including two bassists—Reggie Workman and Art Davis—and Eric Dolphy on flute. It precedes the spiritual and interstellar exploration of his work for Impulse! Records. Over the previous years, he had developed a method of improvisation, classified by critic Ira Gitler as “sheets of sound,” in which he would vertically and vertiginously stack arpeggios in his solos.\n\nSo it’s strange that Olé is, in a way, Coltrane’s most horizontal album, if only for how much real estate he cedes to the rhythm and groove. This is especially evident on “Olé,” which unfolds for 18 minutes on a hypnotic rhythm sustained by the fixtures of John Coltrane’s band, pianist McCoy Tyner and drummer Elvin Jones. Workman and Davis, meanwhile, try to destabilize this groove by drawing strange, pulsing magnetic fields and sawing their basses so vigorously, they form long, dark shadows into which the song sinks. When Coltrane finally takes his solo, 13 minutes into the track, what pours out of his saxophone isn’t a toppling structure: Instead, one hears him scraping against the upper limits of his range. It sounds like he’s starting to escape the atmosphere. –Brad Nelson\n\nListen: John Coltrane: “Olé”\n\n149.\n\nSon House: Father of Folk Blues (1965)\n\nEddie James “Son” House, Jr. did not sell his soul; he was not blinded by lye. If he seems less mythologized than the average bluesman of his era and stature, it’s largely because he was alive to record this album and subsequently receive polite applause at colleges and folk festivals for a decade afterward. But there’s no questioning his bona fides: House was blues bedrock enough to have once shooed away a young Robert Johnson.\n\nHis rediscovery in the ’60s resulted in Father of Folk Blues, an album that’s even more stripped-down than his ’40s Library of Congress sessions with Alan Lomax, driven by his slinky steel guitar work and deceptively sweet vocals. More than a guitar player, House was a singer and a writer: Eight of this album’s nine songs are credited to him, and “Death Letter” and “Levee Camp Moan” have become classics in their own right. He may have never made a deal with the devil, but House paid a different cost, taking terrible jobs as a chef and railroad porter, waiting until someone cared. Father of Folk Blues is the payoff. –Andrew Gaerig\n\nListen: Son House: “Sundown”\n\n148.\n\nRoberta Flack: First Take (1969)\n\nRoberta Flack’s singing is like a fever. Even as her vocals gather mass and volume, there is the sense that she is communicating something so intimate and honest that it burns from the inside. She returns to certain phrases and words in a way that widens their definitions; on her glacial recording of the Donny Hathaway/Robert Ayers–written “Our Ages or Our Hearts,” from her debut album First Take, she sings, “I thought… I thought we had a love that was true.” The second “thought” is broader than the first, drawing the unabridged history of a relationship into itself.\n\nOn First Take, Flack’s singing and spacious piano playing blend soul, blues, jazz, and folk. The arrangements are dense, but they almost exclusively express themselves in flourishes; in the opening track, “Compared to What,” the horn section abruptly sprouts out of the chorus. It’s a remarkable song on a remarkable debut, Flack expressing political and personal dissatisfaction while barely raising her voice. “Hate that human/Love that stinking mutt,” she sings in an angry simmer. “Try to make it real/But compared to what?” The fire in her voice flickers beyond a composed surface, but it still burns. –Brad Nelson\n\nListen: Roberta Flack: “I Told Jesus”\n\n147.\n\nDon Cherry: Eternal Rhythm (1969)\n\nA crucial player in the birth of free jazz in the early ’60s, trumpeter Don Cherry discovered an even freer world on Eternal Rhythm. Recorded in Berlin in November 1968, the album found him working with a transcontinental, all-star cast that included guitarist Sonny Sharrock and avant-garde French percussionist Jacques Thollot, establishing the Oklahoma City-born Cherry as a joyous visionary and global intermediary. Finding shapes on the far side of complete freeness, the LP’s two side-long suites encompass clouds of group improvisation but also mini ensembles, coalescing motifs, and solo flute pieces. Throughout, the constant chime of melodic percussion gives the music a rolling lightness, even as the ensemble hits full density on “Autumn Melody,” an earthy grounding for Sharrock’s splintering guitar. Open-eared and timeless in spirit, Eternal Rhythm remains a glowing doorway to music from the other side. –Jesse Jarnow\n\nListen: Don Cherry: “Eternal Rhythm, Pt. 1”\n\n146.\n\nJorge Ben: Samba Esquema Novo (1963)\n\nThough most widely known for launching the endlessly covered “Mas, Que Nada,” Jorge Ben’s debut album is a bossa nova masterpiece rounded out by 11 other equally immortal, if less imitated, songs. Raised in Rio by an Ethiopian mother, the 18-year-old Ben infused fresh blood into the city’s established sound, incorporating a stronger samba influence in his rhythmic guitar style than his predecessors. Likewise, his vocal style was much less restrained, as likely to slide upward into a soaring, yipping cry for joy (“Uála Uálalá,” “A Tamba”) as it was to remain in the quiet, warm lounge tone most associated with the genre.\n\nSamba Esquema Novo is one of most distinctive bossa nova albums ever recorded and a tantalizing glimpse into Ben’s unique oeuvre, which straddles bossa, samba, Tropicália, and Afro-funk. His impact as a songwriter and sonic innovator is particularly foreshadowed on the spooky, minor-keyed passages of “Quero Esquecer Você” and “A Tamba.” Though he has often been overlooked in comparison to contemporaries like Gilberto Gil, Caetano Veloso, and Sergio Mendes, particularly outside Brazil, his contribution is no less major. –Edwin “STATS” Houghton\n\nListen: Jorge Ben: “A Tamba”\n\n145.\n\nArchie Shepp: Blasé (1969)\n\nBefore taking up the saxophone, Archie Shepp studied drama, training that proved belatedly useful: The players on Blasé sometimes seem to be trading off monologues, circling each other at his direction. Shepp’s theatrical form of jazz estranges tradition—the first sound heard here is blues harmonica, off-key and dissonant. The hymn “There Is a Balm in Gilead” is pared down to a resounding nothing: muted flugelhorn, piano keys faintly brushed. Like much of the album, one of five Shepp recorded in the same year, it wouldn’t work without the singer Jeanne Lee, who gives that title such ironic sting: “Blasé, ain’t you, daddy?/You, who shot your sperm into me/But never set me free.” Warmth and reproach mingle in her voice, like a handful of cinders. The notes contort while crawling on ahead, intimately menacing. –Chris Randle\n\nListen: Archie Shepp: “Blasé”\n\n144.\n\nDavid Axelrod: Song of Innocence (1968)\n\nIn 1968, a former boxer turned producer, composer, and A&R man sets to work on his most ambitious project yet: an orchestral tone poem based around Song of Innocence and of Experience, a book of poems published by the visionary English author William Blake some two centuries before. David Axelrod had previously been the creative force behind the Electric Prunes’ Mass in F Minor, a psychedelic religious opera sung in Latin that all but killed off the hapless garage rockers that were its unlikely vessel. Despite that album’s noble failure, Axelrod somehow assembled an ensemble of some 30 players—including members of L.A.’s hotshot session players the Wrecking Crew—to bring Song of Innocence to life.\n\nBaroque and of rarefied atmosphere, “Holy Thursday” and “The Smile” blossom with sumptuous strings, horns, and scorching electric guitar leads. But you can also hear hints of Axelrod the pugilist in the album’s punchy, funk-inflected drum breaks. Song of Innocence was seen by some as a folly, but by the 1990s, Axelrod’s work was being rediscovered by a generation of crate-diggers like DJ Shadow and Madlib, who recognized the holy, beautiful vision writ through his grooves. –Louis Pattison\n\nListen: David Axelrod: “Song of Innocence”\n\nDeeper Dive: David Axelrod’s hip-hop influences\n\n143.\n\nAlexander “Skip” Spence: Oar (1969)\n\nA catalyst behind the early San Francisco rock scene, Alexander “Skip” Spence followed up a stint as the drummer in Jefferson Airplane by joining the star-crossed psych rock outfit Moby Grape. It didn’t go so well: While working on an album in New York, Spence took a fire ax to his bandmates, landing him in the Tombs and, eventually, Bellevue. After his discharge from the mental hospital, he went to Nashville and cut the entirety of Oar in four days with himself on every instrument. By turns shambolic, astonishing, silly, and shattered, the album is a haunting snapshot of an artist mastering country, loose-limbed rock, ghostly gospel, free-love ditties, and drum’n’bass abstraction as his mental state crumbles. There’s no darker portrait of the perils of the psychedelic era. –Andy Beta\n\nListen: Alexander “Skip” Spence: “Diana”\n\n142.\n\nFrank Sinatra: September of My Years (1965)\n\nThe dewy-eyed oldie “It Was a Very Good Year” is on the shortlist of songs that define Frank Sinatra’s midlife resurgence, but the title also describes the year he was having when he sang it. In 1965, at age 50, the Voice got his second wind: He was the subject of the Emmy-winning special Frank Sinatra: A Man and His Music and made his directorial debut in None But the Brave, which he also starred in and produced. He was shadowed by Gay Talese for what would become the mythic Esquire article “Frank Sinatra Has a Cold.” He bought his first Learjet, and two albums he released would go on to win Album of the Year Grammys. As he entered his golden years, Sinatra was solidifying his legend.\n\nEven amid this career renaissance, twilight was clearly setting on the storied songman. So it’s fitting that September of My Years, the first of those two Grammy-winners, is a traditional pop standard-bearer about learning to accept growing old. The aging Lothario gazes longingly at young lovers and remembers his conquests, and he gazes reflectively at himself through the looking glass, catching glimpses of the man he once was. The album’s extended metaphor—autumn signaling the coming of the end—presents a bittersweet backdrop for his soul-searching. This collection of sentimental songs from a self-professed playboy feels as essential to his myth as any of the swanky displays of his youth; the writing is wistful and evocative and his voice swells into lush, crescendoing strings. September of My Years is graceful and meditative, willingly accepting of a time-imposed truth: “That world I knew is lost to me.” –Sheldon Pearce\n\nListen: Frank Sinatra: “Once Upon a Time”\n\n141.\n\nShirley and Dolly Collins: Anthems in Eden (1969)\n\nOn 1969’s Anthems in Eden, English folk singer Shirley Collins and her sister Dolly delved into the past to give the modern folk scene a kick up the ærs. Shirley refashioned a clutch of traditional numbers into a song-cycle about women in wartime. Dolly arranged the material for David Munrow’s Early Music Consort of London, featuring the strange, dissonant sound of crumhorns and sacbuts. Together, they imbued this Old English material with disarming new vitality.\n\nAnthems opens with “A Song-Story,” which describes a relationship between a young woman and a blacksmith who are besotted with one another. He betrays her, and a valuable, progressive lesson rings through their centuries-long tale (“There’s no trusted man/Not my own brother/So girls, if you would love/Love one each other”). Along with stories of personal treachery, Anthems offers a subtle indictment of war’s effect on the British working classes. Romantic, earthy, vengeful, and above all self-possessed, the album tells a timeless narrative of innocence and experience, and suggests that sacrifice is only worth making on one’s own terms. –Laura Snapes\n\nListen: Shirley and Dolly Collins: “God Dog”\n\n140.\n\nMary Lou Williams: Black Christ of the Andes (1964)\n\nUpon her conversion to Catholicism in the 1950s, piano innovator Mary Lou Williams all but disappeared from the world of jazz. The following decade, she emerged from her prayerful isolation with this visionary 10-song LP. Initially an eponymous release, subsequent reissues formalized its title as Black Christ of the Andes—a reference to St. Martin de Porres, a dark-skinned 17th-century healer who symbolized racial harmony and was later canonized by Pope John XXIII. The first track is Williams’ largely a cappella hymn to the saint, its choral exclamations driven by traditional, mid-century pop-group harmony. But Williams also throws in startling, modernist harmonic material, reflecting her connection to bebop. Toward the end of the song, her piano makes a swooping entrance—and when the singers join her, there are swinging rhythms and call-and-response vocalizations in the reverent mix. This rich variety sets the tone for the rest of the album, which moves from the avant-garde solo piano strains of “A Fungus A Mungus” to the rousing and sanctified small-band groove of “Praise the Lord.” In earlier decades, jazz was seen as principally belonging to the secular realm, but Williams showed how swinging compositions and spiritual reflection could be one and the same. –Seth Colter Walls\n\nListen: Mary Lou Williams: “Black Christ of the Andes (St. Martin de Porres)”\n\n139.\n\nStevie Wonder: For Once in My Life (1968)\n\nThe story of Stevie Wonder’s first decade in music is his rise from young talent to true auteur—no small accomplishment for an artist working in Motown’s famously controlling machine. Wonder hadn’t completed that arc yet at age 18 when he released For Once in My Life. It was already his 10th LP, but this record marked some major milestones, including his most writing credits yet on an album and his first production one. Most significantly, it marked the first of Wonder’s pop albums to feature the clavinet, the instrument that would come to symbolize his creative ambitions.\n\nSong for song, For Once in My Life is stronger than Wonder’s previous albums, but it’s the sheer eagerness of his performances that makes it stand out. By 1968, he’d fully grown into his adult voice, and he lets it soar here, eager to show off all its new tricks. You can hear Wonder take a deep breath and smack his tongue against the roof of his mouth before hitting the show-stopping note on “I Don’t Know Why,” and by the end of the song, he’s practically run himself ragged. Even would-be ballads like the title track get an ebullient, swinging treatment. The last thing Wonder wanted to do, at this point in his career, was slow down. –Evan Rytlewski\n\nListen: Stevie Wonder: “For Once in My Life”\n\nDeeper Dive: Stevie Wonder, musical wunderkind\n\n138.\n\nSun Ra and His Arkestra: The Magic City (1966)\n\nKeyboardist, bandleader, and self-proclaimed spaceman Sun Ra released more than 20 albums over the course of the ’60s. They all have their charms, but The Magic City is particularly vehement about being jazz on Ra and his Arkestra’s terms and no one else’s. Named after a train station sign in Ra’s hometown of Birmingham, Ala., “The Magic City” itself is a 27-minute group improvisation, with Ra playing fractured figures on a piano and reeling spacey whistles out of a Clavioline (sometimes simultaneously). For most of the piece, he pulls two or three musicians at a time into the spotlight, then out again; the Arkestra probes tentatively around the neon-light field of the imaginary place their leader is evoking, and sometimes erupts into swaggering clusters of horns. As a further backhand to jazz convention, the album includes both “Abstract Eye” and “Abstract ‘I’”—two versions of the same piece that suggest the flexibility of what a “composition” could mean to Ra and his group. –Douglas Wolk\n\nListen: Sun Ra and His Solar Arkestra: “The Magic City”\n\n137.\n\nThe Isley Brothers: It’s Our Thing (1969)\n\nAs It’s Our Thing opens, Ronald Isley catches a woman in a compromising situation. She’s been sleeping around, but Isley preempts any fears that he might rat on her. It’s all right, he assures her: He’s been cheating on his girl, too. And so sets the tone for one of the most exuberantly hedonistic soul albums of the ’60s, a judgment-free celebration of free love and freedom in general.\n\nAutonomy was strong on the Isley Brothers’ minds at the time. They’d spent the previous few years on Motown, where they’d begun to feel out of place—Isley’s untamed voice often clashed with the smoother songs they’d been assigned to record, and the group had grown resentful as the label continually passed its surefire hits to other artists. Without Berry Gordy overseeing their image, the Isleys were free to run with their wild side, writing every song on It’s Our Thing themselves, and concocting a looser, funkier, and kinkier record than anything Motown would’ve allowed. The group would reinvent themselves ceaselessly over the next decade-and-a-half, but It’s Our Thing marked the moment where they first grasped how infinite the possibilities were. They could sleep with whomever they wanted. They could make whatever music they wanted. –Evan Rytlewski\n\nListen: The Isley Brothers: “It’s Your Thing”\n\n136.\n\nRoy Orbison: Crying (1962)\n\nOn the engagement ode “She Wears My Ring,” Roy Orbison allows himself a rare moment of pure joy. “She swears to wear it with eternal devotion,” he beams. Alas, this bliss is short-lived. On the album’s very next track, he’s all alone once again: It’s his wedding day, but all he has to hang on to is that same cold, gold ring. She’s gone.\n\nArdent devotee Bruce Springsteen, who copped Orbison’s melodramatic delivery on Born to Run, once described the singer as “the coolest uncool loser you’d ever seen.” His tinted shades gave him mystique, but he was a pining romantic at heart, an introvert who could turn a teary pop ballad into an opera for the ages. He wasn’t particularly suave onstage, like Elvis, or even that cute, like the Everly Brothers, but his dweebiness made his tales of unrequited love that much more believable. When he sings “love hurts” in that sterling, warbling tenor, you can practically see the bruises. –Ryan Dombal\n\nListen: Roy Orbison: “Love Hurts”\n\n135.\n\nFred Neil: Fred Neil (1966)\n\nOriginally a singer-songwriter cog in the Brill Building pop machine, Fred Neil and his fathoms-deep baritone soon found a more accommodating setting in the Greenwich Village folk boom of the early ’60s. There, he mentored budding young folkies like Bob Dylan, Karen Dalton, Tim Buckley, and David Crosby and released a self-titled album that still resonates in its profundity. “The Dolphins” and “Everybody’s Talkin’” remain evocative classics, as humble and mysterious as the folk music standards Neil and cohorts previously emulated at Café Wha? The album ranges from harmonica and 12-string folk staples to ruminations that shimmer with electric guitar lines. Spare and serene yet with an underlying sadness, Neil proved that “searching for the dolphins in the sea” wasn’t just a metaphor but a life goal, soon turning his attentions from music altogether and towards dolphin conservation in South Florida instead. –Andy Beta\n\nListen: Fred Neil: “Everybody’s Talkin’”\n\n134.\n\nDuke Ellington / Charles Mingus / Max Roach: Money Jungle (1963)\n\nAlready an immortal songwriter and composer, Duke Ellington refused to fade into the background, even as he reached his sixties. And with the one-day 1962 session that resulted in Money Jungle, he took the rare step of paring down his big band sound by playing in a trio with two artists decades his junior: bassist Charles Mingus and drummer Max Roach. Together, they catalyzed a rhythm section that pushed Ellington’s melodic and improvisational chops to the limit. On the title track, Ellington enthusiastically reckons with the avant-garde. The album’s quieter moments—the softly rustling “Fleurette Africaine” and the romantic, subtly bluesy “Warm Valley”—find odd-angled routes towards reverie. The album closes with two old standards from Ellington’s 1930s heyday—a deliriously joyful take on Juan Tizol’s “Caravan,” and a lush meditation on the Ellington-composed “Solitude.” They advance the past into the future on terms even a musical forefather like Duke could welcome. –Nate Patrin\n\nListen: Duke Ellington/Charles Mingus/Max Roach: “Money Jungle”\n\n133.\n\nAretha Franklin: Aretha Now (1968)\n\nAretha Franklin’s 15th album, Aretha Now, came into a world on fire. The United States was in turmoil in 1968, reeling from the assassinations of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy; amid protests and uprisings, troops waged war in Vietnam. Perhaps on purpose, Franklin reflected those tensions on her opening song, “Think,” a volcanic soul stomp that cries for freedom.\n\nAs the story goes, Aretha Now was recorded in five days under the watch of producer Jerry Wexler, who also oversaw her smash Lady Soul earlier that year. Aretha Now turned out to be a barnburner in its own right, slightly overshadowed by its predecessor yet no less potent. On “You’re a Sweet Sweet Man,” for instance, Franklin sounds especially resonant, and her cover of “Hello Sunshine” might be better than Wilson Pickett’s original. Aretha Now captures Franklin ascending to the height of her power, helping her earn her rightful title as the Queen of Soul. –Marcus J. Moore\n\nListen: Aretha Franklin: “Hello Sunshine”\n\n132.\n\nThe Flying Burrito Brothers: The Gilded Palace of Sin (1969)\n\nIn a flowery West Coast scene that dismissed George Jones and Porter Wagoner as conservative squares, Gram Parsons of the Flying Burrito Brothers treated country 45s as sacred texts. What’s more, he adopted their bedazzled Nudie suit uniform, tricking his out with pills and pot leaves. The band, formed by Parsons and Chris Hillman after they left the Byrds, played to Parsons’ strengths: a deep knowledge of country music, a strong voice, a pretty face, rock star friends, and a trust fund that kept him stocked with drugs and flashy duds.\n\nThe Gilded Palace of Sin—the band’s first and best record—establishes their identity perfectly. The warm, loose twang of Kleinlow’s pedal steel underscores Parsons and Hillman’s harmonies. They offer up morality tales about music industry greed (“Sin City”), groupie culture (“Christine’s Tune”), draft-dodging (“My Uncle”), and in true country tradition, heartbreak (“Hot Burrito #1”). They also expand beyond country’s confines, covering two classics by the Muscle Shoals songwriting legends Chips Moman and Dan Penn. Gilded Palace is a testament to the band’s omnivorous nature: They blurred the lines between country and rock, James Carr and Lefty Frizzell, churchgoers and hippie boys. –Evan Minsker\n\nListen: The Flying Burrito Brothers: “Sin City”\n\n131.\n\nJimmy Cliff: Jimmy Cliff (1969)\n\nIf the 1972 soundtrack to The Harder They Come spread the sounds of reggae worldwide, that film’s star and soundtrack curator sowed the seeds for the incoming revolution three years earlier with his self-titled album. Jimmy Cliff was already a hero in his native Jamaica, a celebrity since he was a teen, but this is the record that brought the 21-year-old singer to an international audience. It includes some of Cliff’s most enduring songs—“Many Rivers to Cross,” “Vietnam,” “Wonderful World, Beautiful People”—and each one became a reggae standard in its own right, covered endlessly after Cliff let them loose into the world. The album also saw him showing off his range as a songwriter who was equally comfortable penning mournful ballads and incisive protest songs as he explored the flexibility of a sound on the cusp of its breakthrough. –Kevin Lozano\n\nListen: Jimmy Cliff: “Vietnam”\n\n130.\n\nVarious Artists: A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector (1963)\n\nA Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector is an advent calendar of tracks featuring the producer’s trademark opulence. But its grand soundscapes, from sweeping strings to clanging bells, would be nothing but window dressing without its talented cast—most notably Darlene Love, whose soaring, bittersweet vocals on “Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)” challenge the season’s easy cheer. Throughout, Spector retrofits Yuletide standards with his maximalist Wall of Sound style, helping the Crystals breathe new life into “Santa Claus Is Coming to Town” and the Ronettes revive “Frosty the Snowman.” –Zoe Camp\n\nListen: Darlene Love: “Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)”\n\n129.\n\nThe United States of America: The United States of America (1968)\n\nTheir name was a provocation—“a way of expressing disdain for governmental policy. It was like hanging the flag upside down,” as the group’s Dorothy Moskowitz told Terrascope. But if you were young in 1968, there was a lot going on—LSD, Vietnam, The White Album, Stockhausen—and the United States of America somehow sounded like all of it at once: a counterculture state-of-the-union address. Their debut album was the work of a group of UCLA students working under the direction of Joseph Byrd, an ethnomusicologist and former student of John Cage.\n\nByrd, a card-carrying Communist, envisaged an avant-garde rock band with radical politics at its center, and from that combustible starting point came a suite of music that pulls in all directions. Fuzz-rock and musique concrète leaks into traditional jazz and ragtime, with Moskowitz’s beautiful but affectless voice a rare constant. By any conventional yardstick, it’s a jumble, but think of it as the musical equivalent of a Rauschenberg collage and it all makes sense. –Louis Pattison\n\nListen: The United States of America: “Cloud Song”\n\n128.\n\nJohn Coltrane: Live at Birdland (1964)\n\n“One of the most baffling things about America is that despite its essentially vile profile, so much beauty continues to exist here,” writes the poet LeRoi Jones (aka Amiri Baraka) in his liner notes to Live at Birdland. Throughout the 1960s, John Coltrane mastered this paradox, turning harrowing sadness into sublime beauty and vice versa. Live at Birdland, one of his most accessible and engaging albums from the decade, offers plenty of straight-up beauty, especially in Coltrane’s lilting version of Mongo Santamaria’s “Afro-Blue” and two other tunes recorded at an October 1963 concert.\n\nBut one piece recorded in a studio, “Alabama,” goes deeper, melding tragedy and grace into something epic despite lasting only five minutes. Written in reaction to the Birmingham church bombing just weeks prior, timed to match the cadence of Martin Luther King Jr.’s memorial speech, “Alabama” is played by Coltrane’s classic quartet with both solemnity and hope. It’s a stirring, timeless example of how music can grapple with incomprehensible human acts. –Marc Masters\n\nListen: John Coltrane: “Alabama”\n\n127.\n\nThe Monks: Black Monk Time (1966)\n\nThe Monks were rock’n’roll’s original trolls. In an era when British Invasion bands were sparking sexual revolutions and denying Jesus’ chart appeal, the Monks cheekily pledged allegiance to the monastic tradition, foregoing mop-tops in favor of tonsures. At the dawn of the guitar-god age, they wielded a banjo player. And where most young men their age were starting bands to get girls, the Monks seemed more interested in repelling them with caveman-stomped kiss-offs like “I Hate You.”\n\nBut the Monks’ novel nihilism was driven by very real neuroses. While budding U.S. rock bands could spout off about their teen angst from the comfort of their parents’ garages, the Monks were formed by five American GIs stationed in Germany, staring down the possibility of getting shipped off to Vietnam. That cloud of dread consumes even the most joyously anarchic songs on their 1966 debut. The opener “Monk Time” rolls out on a bouncing-ball beat like some children’s-show theme song for juvenile delinquents, but it’s overtaken by Gary Burger’s unsettling shrieks—“Stop it! I don’t like it!”—as if he were suddenly overcome by PTSD. Even when not directly addressing the horrors of combat, Black Monk Time is a discomfiting listen. –Stuart Berman\n\nListen: The Monks: “Shut Up”\n\n126.\n\nTammy Wynette: D-I-V-O-R-C-E (1968)\n\nTammy Wynette didn’t take long to peak. She was only just a couple of years into her career by 1968, but already in the middle of a long run of consecutive No. 1 hits that cemented her stardom. She released her signature song, “Stand By Your Man,” that year, as well as her tearjerker of a third album, D-I-V-O-R-C-E, which captured some of her most harrowing performances.\n\nThe main attraction is the title track, about a couple’s attempt to hide their divorce from their not-yet-literate 4-year-old child by spelling out the word instead of saying it. Wynette had a gift for sniffing out the sorrow in any material she was handed, though, so even the obligatory covers typical of country albums from that era soared—especially anguished takes on the Beatles’ “Yesterday” and country fiddler John Hartford’s “Gentle on My Mind.” Producer Billy Sherrill helped pioneer the “countrypolitan” sound—a sometimes overblown tangle of strings, choirs, and twang—but with Wynette, he always cleared plenty of room for her sterling voice, allowing every quiver and catch in her throat to speak for itself. –Evan Rytlewski\n\nListen: Tammy Wynette: “Sweet Dreams”\n\n125.\n\nSonny Sharrock: Black Woman (1969)\n\nSonny Sharrock’s 1969 debut as a bandleader, Black Woman, is a distinguished free jazz record because of three things: the restless thrum of Milford Graves’ drumming, which never assembles into anything as coherent as a pulse; the antlered progressions of Sonny’s guitar playing; and the voice of Linda Sharrock—singular, gorgeous, uniquely capable of deconstructing itself in real time. When all those elements align in “Peanut,” they seem to produce a shimmer; when they stutter and fall apart, as they do often in “Portrait of Linda in Three Colors, All Black,” each part separates into its own bracing fraction. That Linda rarely sings any recognizable words is key: Black Woman tries to give shape to a nameless personal and emotional betweenness—between fraternity and isolation, between singing and screaming, between joy and pain. –Brad Nelson\n\nListen: Sonny Sharrock: “Peanut”\n\n124.\n\nThe Kinks: Something Else By the Kinks (1967)\n\nWhile many of their British Invasion peers were hypnotized by the escapist allure of psychedelia, the Kinks offered a focused view of the cruel absurdities of real life. Their fifth album, Something Else, may boast all the telltale trappings of circa-’67 rock production (harpsichords, chirpy horns, woozy sound effects, bird calls), but they’re used to subtly color rather than to distort songwriter Ray Davies’ wry, acutely detailed portraits of workaday drudgery, paycheck-draining impoverishment, and family dysfunction (a subject he was all too familiar with). But on Something Else’s swooning closer, “Waterloo Sunset,” Davies’ withering social commentary gives way to a quiet reverence for his surroundings. Part love song, part urban travelogue, part zen mantra, “Waterloo Sunset” serves the same function as psychedelia—inviting us to block out the bustle and grime of city life and bask in a natural wonder—but with a sobering sense of clarity. –Stuart Berman\n\nListen: The Kinks: “Tin Soldier Man”\n\n123.\n\nMarvin Gaye: In the Groove (1968)\n\nMarvin Gaye and Norman Whitfield hated each other, but the producer Whitfield brought out a newfound intensity and fervor in Gaye’s performances on In the Groove. (Gaye later said his collaborator had him “reaching for notes that caused my throat veins to bulge.”) The strategy worked, though this album’s biggest hit almost didn’t even see the light of day: “I Heard It Through the Grapevine” was shelved for a full year before being added to In the Groove at the last minute. The song became Gaye’s first single to top the Billboard 100 when it was later re-released as a single, eventually selling more than 4 million copies. It cemented the singer’s financial stability and gave him the leverage he needed to break free of Motown’s strict quality-control system and invent a whole new take on soul music a few years later. –Kevin Lozano\n\nListen: Marvin Gaye: “Chained”\n\n122.\n\nMulatu Astatke: Afro-Latin Soul, Vol. 1 (1966)\n\nThe title is sublimely generic; the “Ethiopian Quintet” credited as backing band is mostly Puerto Rican. Mulatu Astatke would become better-known for the records he made after returning to Ethiopia in the 1970s, but Afro-Latin Soul is trickier than it first appears. His idiosyncratic style, fusing the traditional pentatonic scale with Western jazz chords, remained half-formed—this album resembles Latin dance music of the period, led by someone learning the jams secondhand. On tracks like “Askum,” there’s a charming sense that Astatke is speeding up to match the tempo of the audience. He wrote lyrics for “I Faram Gami I Faram,” uncharacteristically, and got sideman Louis Rodriguez to sing them in Amharic, along with a trumpeting elephant. The vibraphone you hear everywhere doesn’t comfort or lull; it gives each groove a blurred weight, as if moving through the immaculate lacquer of dreams. –Chris Randle\n\nListen: Mulatu Astatke: “Shagu”\n\n121.\n\nDesmond Dekker and The Aces: Israelites (1969)\n\nIn June 1969, a few years before Jimmy Cliff, Johnny Nash, and Bob Marley introduced reggae to the pop mainstream, Kingston group Desmond Dekker and the Aces cracked the Billboard Top 10 with “Israelites,” beguiling American listeners with an off-kilter, upstroke rhythm, Dekker’s high-pitched croon, and lyrics that linked hardscrabble Jamaican life to Old Testament myths. Dekker had released several Jamaican hit singles through the ’60s (and topped the UK charts in 1967 with the rude boy ode “007 (Shanty Town)”), but the U.S. success of “Israelites” led to a quick LP follow-up helmed by legendary producer Leslie Kong. Far from a simple cash-in, Israelites shows the depth of Dekker’s crossover capacity. Covers of Bill Anderson’s 1960 country hit “Tip of My Fingers” and a ballad version of “For Once in My Life,” a 1968 up-tempo smash for Stevie Wonder, share space with purely Jamaican tunes like the sassy “Rude Boy Train” and “It Mek” (island patois for “that’s what you get”). Unfairly classified as a “one-hit wonder” for the surprise success of “Israelites,” Dekker’s historical role is much more significant: He was the first Jamaican pop diplomat. –Eric Harvey\n\nListen: Desmond Dekker and the Aces: “It Mek”\n\n120.\n\nPink Floyd: The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)\n\nAs a no-show on classic-rock playlists, Pink Floyd’s debut is rarely anyone’s starting point with the band. But even if the British group had ended with the dismissal of original leader Syd Barrett following the release of Piper at the Gates of Dawn, their place in psychedelic rock would be assured. The album is one of the mode’s greatest achievements, finding space for both fractured fairy tales and 10-minute interstellar freakouts while making both sound equally mind-altering (and frightening). It also makes a tragic hero out of the troubled, brilliant, and ultimately doomed Barrett. Fifty years later, it’s possible to see Pink Floyd as everything punk and indie rock sought to tear down as well as a foundational influence on those same movements. –Ian Cohen\n\nListen: Pink Floyd: “Astronomy Domine”\n\n119.\n\nThe Meters: The Meters (1969)\n\nThere were dozens of instrumental R&B hits in the ’60s, but most of them were showcases for a star soloist. New Orleans’ the Meters, the house band for Allen Toussaint, evolved into an impossibly tight funk ensemble without a leader and with no shortage of personalities. Their breakthrough hit “Cissy Strut” bounces equally between all four members, including drummer “Ziggy” Modeliste, whose cymbal smashes are direct commands to the hips.\n\nThe group whipped up most of their debut album quickly when “Cissy Strut” started climbing the charts, offering the dance grooves they’d honed and hardened in eight-hour gigs at the Ivanhoe club on Bourbon Street. It’s remarkable how much open air there is in The Meters’ funk: Keyboardist Art Neville glides as the rest of the musicians snap and crack, and burners like “Sophisticated Cissy” and “Ease Back” slow down sensually while heating the dance floor up. –Douglas Wolk\n\nListen: The Meters: “Live Wire”\n\n118.\n\nThe Beach Boys: Smiley Smile (1967)\n\nAfter Brian Wilson’s epic Smile project came crashing to earth in 1967, the Beach Boys knocked out a quickie album to replace it. Filled with casual re-recordings of songs and fragments considered for Smile, along with two earlier singles that sound completely out of place in their baroque grandiosity (“Good Vibrations” and “Heroes and Villains,” the latter of which was labored over endlessly as Smile’s planned centerpiece), Smiley Smile seems at first like a Beach Boys album to skip, a final squib from the towering ambition of the previous few years.\n\nBut over time, Smiley Smile has developed a small cult of its own, attracting those drawn to its stripped-down, highly spontaneous, and deeply stoned vibe. Partly recorded at Wilson’s house, it has the feel of a mixtape, with a zany instrumental interlude, tape-warp nuttiness, explosive fits of laughter, and sound effects; the songs, about hair loss and visions of distant lands and the essential goodness of vegetables, have the cracked and colorful logic of daydreams. Considering how significant the Beach Boys were in the pop landscape at the time, it’s baffling that a major record label would release an album this goofy and slight. But Smiley Smile is a record of startling intimacy, and it basically i"
