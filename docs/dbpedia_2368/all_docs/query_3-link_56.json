        "text": "It’s always been a prerequisite of ours… if you’re stepping out on stage with Tell Me Lies you must have a love and understanding of FM's music, their spirituality and their history. Our motto, which was set in the very beginning stages of this band... ‘It's About Their Music’. The challenge as musicians is to play the songs just as they were recorded. These precious songs have been the soundtrack to many people's lives and we know that you hold them close. That stands true for us also. Quite a task but one we all understand.\n\nTell Me Lies prides themselves on being the most authentic Fleetwood Mac Tribute without coming across as a parody or satire. They will make you dance, sing along at the top of your lungs, and you’ll even learn something new about Fleetwood Mac at each performance.\n\nTell Me Lies will make you relive those Fleetwood Mac memories.\n\nIf you are looking for the most authentic Fleetwood Mac Tribute Band, Tell Me Lies is an all-ages show suitable for Theaters, Concerts Halls, Parks, Casinos, Corporate Events, Clubs, and Private Events.\n\nRead More"
