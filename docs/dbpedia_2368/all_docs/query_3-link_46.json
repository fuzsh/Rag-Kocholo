        "text": "The Black Keys' song 'Tell Me Lies' delves into the complex and often painful dynamics of relationships built on deception. The lyrics paint a vivid picture of a cycle where lies and half-truths become the foundation of interactions. The opening lines, 'Burn, baby burn / You live and learn every time along the way,' suggest a sense of inevitability and resignation to the hurt that comes with being deceived repeatedly. The use of 'burn' metaphorically indicates the emotional pain and scars left by these experiences.\n\nThe chorus, 'Tell me lies / Tell me all your pretty lies,' highlights a paradoxical desire to hear comforting falsehoods rather than face harsh realities. This reflects a common human tendency to prefer the comfort of illusions over the discomfort of truth. The repetition of 'lala-la-la-la-la-lies' adds a haunting, almost hypnotic quality to the song, emphasizing how lies can be both alluring and destructive.\n\nIn the verse, 'Every woman who's ever loved you is telling you lies / Everyone who's ever loved you can never deny,' the song touches on the universal nature of deceit in relationships. It suggests that lying is a common, perhaps even inevitable, part of love and human interaction. The song's melancholic tone and repetitive structure underscore the cyclical nature of these deceptions, creating a sense of inescapable entanglement in a web of lies. The Black Keys use their signature blues-rock sound to amplify the emotional weight of the lyrics, making 'Tell Me Lies' a poignant exploration of the darker side of love and trust."
