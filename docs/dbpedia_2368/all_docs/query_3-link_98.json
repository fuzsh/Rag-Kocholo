        "text": "watch video from Cats Don't Dance movie, song music and lyrics by Randy Newman, performed by Natalie Cole (Sawyer)\n\nLyrics with pictures\n\nI never believed / That there was a rainbow / With a pot of gold at the end / I'm much too smart / For fairy tales like that / Yet here I am again / I thought this time, / This time we're gonna make it / Why I thought so I really don't know / Maybe something in his eyes / Just told me so / Something in his eyes... / Tell me lies / / And I'll come runnin' / I must have lost my mind! / I could close me eyes / And tell you / Just exactly what's comin' / Life's gonna turn / Just a little unkind. / Seems like everyone's sailin' / Way out on the sea / And I'm stuck here on the shore / Sun's always shinin' / But it's never on me / Why should I try anymore? / Tell me lies / Tell me lies / And I'll just keep right on comin' / This time I've got to believe in the dream. / This time I've got to believe in his dream. NOTE: To watch the pictures in high resolution, click on them\n\nWatch songs from original soundtrack and other parts of movie"
