        "text": "Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt, and Emmylou Harris have three careers unparalleled in music history. Together they have sold over 200 million albums worldwide and performed for decades in front of countless fans around the globe. It's no surprise that when their three voices united to release their debut collaboration, the results were remarkable. The threesome released two albums together, TRIO (1987) and TRIO II (1999), which have combined to sell more than five million copies worldwide and win three GrammyÂ® Awards.\n\nBoth of these classic albums have been newly remastered for a three-CD collection packed with rare and unreleased music.\n\nThe bonus disc is loaded with 20 songs, including alternate takes of album tracks like \"I've Had Enough,\" \"Making Plans\" and \"My Dear Companion.\" Also featured are 11 completely unreleased recordings from the trio spanning both album sessions including \"Waltz Across Texas Tonight,\" \"Pleasant As May,\" \"Are You Tired of Me,\" and the gospel standard \"Softly And Tenderly.\" Among the unreleased material is also an alternate version of \"Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?\" featuring Parton on lead vocals and a stunning acapella version of \"Calling All My Children Home.\"\n\nUPC: 081227954086"
