        "text": "1. Lucius Second Nature\n\nThe Brandi Carlile-produced album has plenty of hooks and lyrics that dig deep and vocal harmonies galore.\n\n2. Beyoncé Renaissance\n\nA rebirth and throwback to 90s house music whose intention is to inspire joy and escapism through dance music.\n\n3. Sharon Van Etten We’ve Been Going About This All Wrong\n\nOne of many “pandemic records” on this list, Van Etten recounts her experiences of the past two years and the changes and struggles that it brought.\n\n4. Mitski Laurel Hell\n\nTransformation is the theme here, as she examines her struggles with relationships including the one with herself and her career.\n\n5. The Weeknd Dawn FM\n\nThe concept is a “psychedelic radio” station blending genres and musical styles that sounds like a throwback with a contemporary edge.\n\n6. Angel Olsen Big Time\n\nWritten during a time of struggle, this old-school country album finds Olsen digging deep into her pain and offering an honest and painstaking look at the highs and lows of life.\n\n7. The Smile A Light For Attracting Attention\n\nConsisting of Thom Yorke, Johnny Greenwood, and Tom Skinner on drums, this could be considered Radiohead light, but it still packs a punch.\n\n8. Amanda Shires Take It Like A Man\n\nTake It Like a Man is the seventh solo studio album by singer-songwriter and fiddle player Amanda Shires. She’s part of the supergroup The Highwoman but makes it clear that she can stand on her own.\n\n9. Fontaines D.C. Skinty Fia\n\nThe opening track “In ár gcroithe go deo” perfectly sets the somber tone of their third release from the Irish post-punk band.\n\n10. Florence + The Machine Dance Fever\n\nThe title of the album was inspired by choreomania, an uncontrollable urge to dance, especially in a frenzied, convulsive manner. Florence Welch deals with big feelings on this record which is also her most personal.\n\n11. S.G. Goodman Teeth Marks\n\nHer striking voice has a soulful aching quality that perfectly suits her country rock-tinged sound.\n\n12. Amber Mark Three Dimensions Deep\n\nOn her debut full-length album, The R&B singer-songwriter’s soulful voice takes center stage and shines brightly.\n\n13. Julia Jacklin Pre Pleasure\n\nOn her third album, the Australian singer-songwriter ponders her past with introspection, seeking answers to questions she’s not afraid to ask.\n\n14. Yeah Yeah Yeahs Cool It Down\n\nReflection, destruction, and isolation are some key themes in these post-pandemic times. The band’s first album in nine years touches on all of them and doesn’t miss a beat from where they left off in 2013.\n\n15. Arctic Monkeys The Car\n\nThe band builds on their last album “Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino”, fusing art rock, jazz, and lounge elements with lush orchestration.\n\n16. Spiritualized Everything Was Beautiful\n\nThe album showcases the band’s numerous influences including psychedelic and classic rock, gospel, blues, and free jazz.\n\n17. Lissie Carving Canyons\n\nFilled with self-reflection and heartbreak but with the promise of healing. Comparisons can be made to Fleetwood Mac, specifically Stevie Nicks, and that is a good thing.\n\n18. Beach House Once Twice Melody\n\nMoody and quiet, this album is filled with all the dreamy and atmospheric sounds we’ve come to expect from the band.\n\n19. Spoon Lucifer On The Couch\n\nAnother year, another Spoon album...solid as ever.\n\n20. Destroyer LABYRINTHITIS\n\nThirteen albums in, Dan Bejar continues to push his music into some challenging, yet exciting directions.\n\n1. The Weather Station Ignorance\n\nThis album grabbed my attention right away with its catchy, jazzy, even upbeat dance-able songs. On the surface, it feels lighthearted, but if you dig in, you’ll realize that she’s singing about some serious issues, with the climate crisis serving as the album’s main theme. Bandleader Tamara Lindeman has been compared to Joni Mitchell over the course of her career, and this album will only continue to further those comparisons.\n\n2. Yola Stand For Myself\n\nThe English singer-songwriter makes a mark with her second record. Once again, producer Dan Auerbach creates a retro sound that fuses R&B and country, all heightened by her powerful voice.\n\n3. The War On Drugs I Don’t Live Here Anymore\n\nThis album starts out nice and slow but steadily kicks into high gear. It’s easy to let yourself go and get lost in the flowing melodies and effortless jams.\n\n4. Kacey Musgraves Star-Crossed\n\nOn her divorce album, she takes you back to the beginning where the trouble began. The gorgeous opening title track sets the tone for a journey of love found and love lost, eventually finding light at the end of the tunnel.\n\n5. Aimee Mann Queens Of The Summer Hotel\n\nThis collection of songs was originally intended for the stage adaptation of Girl, Interrupted. It certainly feels like it was made for the stage with its lush orchestrations and clever lyrical observations that are her forte.\n\n6. Jazmine Sullivan Heaux Tales\n\nSongs and interludes make up this album which features testimonies from a variety of women on the subjects of love, sexuality, feminism, and relationships. The songs are character studies of these musings told through her perspective and passionate vocals.\n\n7. Adele 30\n\nAdele chronicles the end of her marriage and uses her music as a means of catharsis. There are some really great songs on this album (“To Be Loved” is a powerhouse!), but I can do without the talking.\n\n8. Low HEY WHAT\n\nHEY WHAT picks up where Double Negative left off...beautiful harmonies and haunting melodies backed by distorted sounds and noises.\n\n9. Lil Nas X MONTERO\n\nProving he is not a one-hit-wonder, his official debut album made quite a splash. Wearing his heart on his sleeve, these songs deal with family issues, the trappings of fame, loneliness, and the pressures of being a Black gay artist in the music industry.\n\n10. Billie Eilish Happier Than Ever\n\nOn the opening track “Getting Older”, the recently turned 20-year-old sings, “I’m getting older, I think I’m aging well”. I would have to agree.\n\n11. Julien Baker Little Oblivions\n\nHer last album was a collaboration with Phoebe Bridgers and Lucy Dacus who make up boygenius. This album has a fuller sound than her previous ones (she plays guitar, bass, keyboards, and drums) and displays an openness that allows her to express personal experiences like addiction, recovery, healing, and forgiveness.\n\n12. Parquet Courts Sympathy For Life\n\nThe band didn’t want to make another rock record, so they incorporated some techno elements into their sound to make it more experimental. The result is garage rock for the dance floor.\n\n13. Jon Batiste We Are\n\nCombining soul, jazz, funk, and R&B, he takes you on a journey through his history and inspirations. It’s a celebration of music with a social conscience.\n\n14. Liz Phair Soberish\n\nLiz worked with Exile In Guyville producer Brad Wood on her first album in 11 years. Sadly, this album slipped under the radar, but then she has always been underestimated. Middle age tales filled with honesty and hooks.\n\n15. Manchester Orchestra The Million Masks Of God\n\nTheir sixth album sounds like it could be a soundtrack to a movie with its urgency and dramatic crescendos. If Band of Horses and Silversun Pickups made an album it would sound like this.\n\n16. serpentwithfeet DEACON\n\nHis sophomore album celebrates what it means to be Black, gay and in love with rolling, smooth vibes. Think Lil Nas X or The Weeknd without the drama.\n\n17. Arlo Parks Collapsed In Sunbeams\n\nThe Mercury prize winner is one of four debut albums that made the list and she delivers an impressive debut. Soulful and chill.\n\n18. Olivia Rodrigo SOUR\n\n18-years-old and wise beyond her years. Another excellent debut filled with depth and sincerity.\n\n19. Celeste Not Your Muse\n\nThe American-British singer-songwriter’s dynamic vocal styling has garnered comparisons to Amy Winehouse, Billie Holiday, and Adele, and rightfully so.\n\n20. Dusted III\n\nThe Canadian indie rock band made a beautiful album that is subtle and quiet, but still memorable.\n\n1. Fiona Apple Fetch The Bolt Cutters\n\nThis was the perfect project to dissect during the quarantine. Experimental and improvisational, like a modern-day jazz record, the album is built around percussion, paired with her brutal honesty. Entertainment Weekly describes it as “melodic and chaotic”, which sums it up perfectly.\n\n2. Jessie Ware What’s Your Pleasure?\n\nWe so needed to dance this year and this music perfectly fits the bill. Hints of Teena Marie, Prince, Sade, and Robyn, mixed with old-time disco, constitute the perfect pandemic solo dance party.\n\n3. The Dears Lovers Rock\n\nThe Canadian indie rock band’s combination of melodic rock, shoegaze, and goth, features dark guitar riffs, keyboards, strings, and saxophone solos, all with an underlying urgency. Songs with grim titles like “Instant Nightmare!”, “The Worst In Us”, “I Know What You’re Thinking And It’s Awful” and “We’ll Go Into Hiding” felt very relevant, and could be interpreted as a commentary on the year 2020.\n\n4. Alanis Morissette Such Pretty Forks In the Road\n\nAlanis is in fine form here on her best album since Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie. Issues include addiction, depression, and abuse, but there is a silver lining as the strength she finds outweigh the seemingly depressive qualities. The light is all around us.\n\n5. The Weeknd After Hours\n\nInspired by a variety of artists including The Cocteau Twins, Roxy Music and Kraftwerk, to name just a few, it’s the perfect blend of R&B and pop, glossed over with an 80s new wave sheen.\n\n6. Taylor Swift Folklore\n\n2020 brought many surprises, and me becoming a T. Swift fan was definitely one of them. While I respected her and her message, you wouldn’t exactly call me a “Swiftie”. That all changed with this set of stripped-down, introspective songs. The ethereal production shines bright with the help of Aaron Dessner (The National) and Jack Antonoff, but it’s the songwriting and her soothing voice that take center stage here.\n\n7. Taylor Swift Evermore\n\nThe companion piece to Folklore, Evermore came out just a month ago, and I fell in love with it immediately. Once again, Swift trades in her pop sound to explore her folksy side, with guests like Bon Iver and The National. Infectious hooks and vivid storytelling allow you to get lost in your own little world. The hardest part was picking which Taylor record was my favorite, as they were indistinguishable at times.\n\n8. Sault Untitled (Rise)\n\nThere is little information about this British collective, but they managed to release two albums this year, and like Taylor, they both made the list. This was the later one and deals with timely issues following the George Floyd protests. It feels more celebratory musically, but lyrically, it’s a reminder that we need to be fearless in the fight for equality.\n\n9. Waxahatchee Saint Cloud\n\nSaint Cloud was written after Katie Crutchfield (aka Waxahatchee) got sober. She has described the main themes as “addiction and codependency”. Despite the bleak themes, the album has a warmth about it that feels like a cozy blanket on a chilly night.\n\n10. Sault Untitled (Black Is)\n\nThis is an assortment of funk, soul, and spoken-word narrating the Black experience in a world divided. It feels like the soundtrack to the start of a revolution, one that can hopefully bring about real change.\n\n11. Run The Jewels RTJ4\n\nLike many records this year, RTJ ditched their release date and dropped this when they thought the people needed it. Turns out, we did as this protest album deals with classism, racism, and other social issues. Cameos from musicians/activists Pharrell Williams, Zack de la Rocha, and Mavis Staples make a meaningful impact.\n\n12. Phoebe Bridgers Punisher\n\nThis was her breakout year as she’s nominated for four Grammys®. There are a subtleness and quietness to her music, but if you listen closely, she packs a punch.\n\n13. Perfume Genius Set My Heart On Fire Immediately\n\nMike Hadreas continues to impress me. He creates such a personal space with his songs, that you feel like you are living out the scenarios. The song “Jason” is a perfect example of this.\n\n14. Miley Cyrus Plastic Hearts\n\nBilly Idol, Joan Jett, and Stevie Nicks all make appearances as Miley continues to broaden her horizons and get her “rock” on. Pop-rock songs like “WTF Do I Know” will grab your attention first, but soaring ballads like “Angels Like You” and “High” showcase an artist who wants to be taken seriously.\n\n15. Dua Lipa Future Nostalgia\n\nDisco made a comeback this year, and this is one of the many artists who benefited from it. Like the divas of dance music that came before her, she taps into a familiar genre that could easily be cliché but manages to deliver a fresh take.\n\n16. Haim Women In Music Pt III\n\nThe sister act from LA was like a shining light that we needed this year. Highlighting their three-part vocal harmonies, the music is easy-breezy, pop-rock that assists you in finding your sunny place, despite a dreary year.\n\n17. Destroyer Have We Met\n\nAnother Canadian group, who draw on a variety of musical influences. This release combines folk, soft rock, dream pop, and a little new wave. I was able to see the band perform before the lockdown, and their live performance truly elevated the record.\n\n18. Kathleen Edwards Total Freedom\n\nAfter Voyageur in 2012, Edwards, suffering from depression, quit the music business and opened a coffee shop. Thankfully, she’s back with her sturdy blend of country rock and confessional lyrics, and it’s a welcome return.\n\n19. Lucinda Williams Good Souls Better Angels\n\nOn her 15th album, Lucinda amps up the intensity, both musically and lyrically, in her assessment of the current state of affairs. On “Bad News Blues”, she sings “Who’s gonna believe liars and lunatics? Fools and thieves and clowns and hypocrites? Gluttony and greed, and that ain’t the worst of it.” Sound familiar?\n\n20. Chloe x Halle Ungodly Hour\n\nThe singer-songwriting sisters were discovered on YouTube by Beyoncé, who became their mentor and later signed them to her label. On their second album, they display confidence and maturity beyond their years, signaling that they are here to stay.\n\n1. Lana Del Rey Norman Fucking Rockwell\n\nPitchfork said the album “establishes her as one of America’s greatest living songwriters,” which is quite the statement, and I would have to agree. Piano-based ballads are in abundance here, blending pathos and pain, with glimpses of hope. The songs, which are chock-full of references to California and life in America, are both soothing and majestic, and exceptionally produced, allowing all the nuances to shine.\n\n2. FKA Twigs Magdalene\n\nBeautifully ambitious and exploratory, I’d expect nothing less from this innovative artist. It’s Kate Bush meets Björk with some Radiohead thrown in, but still manages to be unique and original.\n\n3. Weyes Blood Titanic Rising\n\nThis album is filled with soft rock influences from the ’70s, as she continues to meld influences like Joni Mitchell and The Carpenters. Yearning for simpler times, coping with change, and not only finding, but holding on to love, are common themes throughout the album.\n\n4. Sharon Van Etten Remind Me Tomorrow\n\n“Sitting at the bar, I told you everything. You said, “Holy shit, you almost died” she sings in the opening line to this compelling album. Her songwriting has been elevated to a new level and she mixes things up by introducing electronic sounds on this album, and the results are stunning.\n\n5. Solange When I Get Home\n\nHer last album A Seat At The Table was widely acclaimed, and this album follows in those footsteps. The album is airy, ambient, and experimental and has a jazzy, soulful feel to it. It may take a few listens to sink in, but when it does, you’ll be hooked.\n\n6. Angel Olsen All Mirrors\n\nOn her third release, Angel reluctantly embraced the addition of strings to her sound. She made the right choice, as they balance these relatively stark, somber songs, adding just the right amount of lightness and drama.\n\n7. Billie Eilish When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?\n\nWho knew that a 17-year-old goth, pop singer/songwriter could be so wise beyond her years? This album makes excellent use of the contrasts between light and dark. An impressive debut from an artist with a bright (and dim) future.\n\n8. Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds Ghosteen\n\nNick Cave never disappoints. He stated that this album is the final part of a trilogy that originated with Push The Sky Away & Skeleton Key. On Ghosteen, he deals with the loss of his son, and while the album can seem very bleak, there are moments of resolution, optimism, and beauty.\n\n9. Aldous Harding Designer\n\nThe third album from the New Zealand singer-songwriter was produced by frequent PJ Harvey collaborator John Parish. He keeps things pretty simple, choosing to let her individualism and artistry be front and center.\n\n10. J.S. Ondara American Dream\n\nA talented musician, originally from Kenya, who now calls MN home. Bob Dylan was the inspiration behind his move, and he honors him with a collection of songs that tell universal stories of life, love, and location. A fresh new voice with a timeless sound.\n\n11. Big Thief U.F.O.F.\n\nFor the first time, two albums from the same artist make the list. This is the one that came out first and is the more subtle of the two. Lead singer Adrianne Lenker’s voice is tender, yet powerful, and her songwriting is stellar. The band reinvents what folk music can be.\n\n12. Lizzo Cuz I Love You\n\nLiving in the Twin Cities, Lizzo has been prevalent here for years. I always wondered not if, but when, the rest of the world would take notice. Obviously, 2019 was her year. Turns out, she is 100% that bitch and more.\n\n13. Big Thief Two Hands\n\nDescribed as the “earth twin” to U.F.O.F., Two Hands came out five months later and is a little rawer, as the songs were recorded live with almost no overdubs. Songs like “Not” and “Forgotten Eyes” show a more aggressive side of the band, which fit nicely between the more delicate moments.\n\n14. Yola Walk Through Fire\n\nThe British singer-songwriter teamed with Dan Auerbach of the Black Keys to create a collection of retro ’70s country-soul songs. The result is something familiar and authentic, all highlighted by her arresting voice.\n\n15. Julia Jacklin Crushing\n\nIn the current crop of up-and-coming indie female artists, Julia manages to stand out from the crowd. Her songs, which the 29-year-old wrote solely by herself, are reflective, intimate, and spacious. A welcome reminder that your singular voice is a unique voice.\n\n16. The Highwomen The Highwomen\n\nThe country supergroup featuring Brandi Carlile, Natalie Hemby, Maren Morris, and Amanda Shires, is a nod to The Highwaymen from the mid-80s, but with a twist. In the face of the #MeToo movement, their voices are a powerful declaration of independence. Redesigning women indeed.\n\n17. Jenny Lewis On The Line\n\nThis album reads like a collection of short stories, which features a wide variety of characters and life experiences. Is it fact or fiction? Who cares, when the songs and the storytelling are this good.\n\n18. Fontaines D.C. Dogrel\n\nThe post-punk rock band from Dublin, Ireland came out with guns blazing. Their debut album is filled with songs that have a sense of urgency and are catchy as hell. Dogrel was nominated for the prestigious Mercury Prize and was named Album of the Year by Rough Trade.\n\n19. Tyler, The Creator IGOR\n\nI had mixed feelings about Tyler in the past, specifically his use of gay slurs, but on his last two albums, he has displayed a newfound maturity and thoughtfulness. Case in point, IGOR deals with his own attraction to men and is a narrative about a love triangle where a boy is in love with a boy, who is still in love with a girl.\n\n20. Hozier Wasteland, Baby!\n\nIt’s hard to believe it’s been five years since he took us to church. The Irishman follows-up his breakthrough album with a heartfelt blend of rock, blues, and soul music. Standouts include “Nina Cried Power” featuring Mavis Staples and “Movement”.\n\n1. Low Double Negative\n\nUpon the first listen, I thought my vinyl was damaged or that my speakers had blown. I quickly realized that the distortion I was hearing was intentional. I admit that this album is pretty dark, even scary at times, but it is so beautiful. Kudos to a band that has been making music for 25 years and continues to break new ground.\n\n2. Kacey Musgraves Golden Hour\n\nOn her third album, Kacey toes the line between country and pop, redefining what contemporary country music can be. Catchy melodies paired with her honey-soaked voice make for a winning combination. Good luck getting these songs out of your head.\n\n3. Mitski Be The Cowboy\n\nThis album is full of sadness but doesn’t leave you feeling hopeless. In fact, it’s quite the opposite. The lyrics are relatable on many levels and she elevates them with upbeat production. Songs like “A Pearl” and “Two Slow Dancers” are perfect examples of the range that she is capable of.\n\n4. Lissie Castles\n\nGaining confidence and being grounded are common themes throughout this album which displays an evolution, both musically and emotionally. The production, which is acoustic-based, but also incorporates electronic effects and layered vocals, compliments her dynamic vocals, to create both an intimacy and a sense of grandeur.\n\n5. Janelle Monáe Dirty Computer\n\nAn album dealing with female empowerment that is both soulful and funky. Prince worked with her, before his untimely death, which is evident throughout the album. But make no mistake, it’s her vision and voice that comes through loud and clear.\n\n6. Parquet Courts Wide Awake!\n\nRock music was not highly represented in 2018. These guys combined punk and funk to create a recording that sounds like a mash-up of The Clash, The Black Keys, and Devo. They recruited Danger Mouse to produce the album, who works his magic and brings it all together.\n\n7. Robyn Honey\n\nThe Swedish queen of pop is back with her first album in eight years. She was inspired by Kate Bush and it shows. Even though many of the songs come from a place of sadness, she said the album represents “this sweet place, like a very soft ecstasy...I danced a lot when I was making it.”\n\n8. Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper A Star Is Born Soundtrack\n\nA great soundtrack for a great movie. Gaga pushes herself into more rock territory and her talent shines. As a musician, Bradley Cooper is no hack either. The chemistry that they have in the movie translates to the record as well.\n\n9. The Internet Hive Mind\n\nThe Internet was formed in early 2011 by Odd Future members Syd and Matt Martians. The musicians all have other projects, and in 2017 each member released an individual solo project. They reunited to create a trip-hop collection which sounds like the perfect soundtrack to a cocktail party circa 2000.\n\n10. Low Cut Connie Dirty Pictures (Part 2)\n\nThe Philadelphia band makes some straight-ahead rock ’n’ roll fused with soulful R&B. The album was recorded at Ardent, the legendary Memphis studio, but sounds like it could have been recorded in a bar, with the band’s loosely handled production and raw energy.\n\n11. Christine And The Queens Chris\n\nChris is the second studio album by French singer Hélöise Letissier. Sounding similar to Marina and the Diamonds, she writes smart pop songs that are very danceable. The playful, funky song “Girlfriend” is a great place to start.\n\n12. Lord Huron Vide Noir\n\nOn their major-label debut, the third studio album by the LA band has a cinematic quality to it. They weave airiness and delicacy with lush, heavier beats, reminding me of My Morning Jacket, who’s also capable of creating this balance.\n\n13. Beach House 7\n\nOn their seventh album, aptly titled 7, hazy guitars and dreamy melodies are still at the forefront as the band continues to experiment with sounds and textures. If you are waiting for a new Cocteau Twins album, this one will suffice for the time being.\n\n14. MGMT Little Dark Age\n\nOn their last release, I felt the duo had lost their way. In a welcome return, they have simplified things, embracing the weirdness that makes them unique. The opening line from “She Works Out Too Much” says it all; “Get ready to have some fun!”\n\n15. Ariana Grande Sweetener\n\nMuch has been said about Ariana this past year, both professionally and personally. She had a tumultuous couple of years and has certainly matured from the events, as demonstrated in this cohesive collection of songs. Here’s an artist who has found her voice, and is not afraid to use it.\n\n16. Boygenius Boygenius\n\nBoygenius consists of Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers & Lucy Dacus, who is considered a supergroup in the indie-folk world. Beautiful harmonies and simple arrangements let the songs shine. My only complaint is that it’s too short.\n\n17. The Carters Everything Is Love\n\nThe final piece in the Beyoncé / Jay-Z triptych. She raked him over the coals with Lemonade and he asked for forgiveness on 4:22, and in the end, love triumphed. A perfect ending to an imperfect relationship.\n\n18. Young Fathers Cocoa Sugar\n\nI recently discovered this Scottish hip-hop group and was immediately intrigued. Their style is hard to describe as they blur the lines of multiple genres. The best comparison may be TV On The Radio combined with Dirty Projectors. Inventive yet accessible.\n\n19. Tracey Thorn Record\n\nEverything But The Girl hasn’t released an album since 1999, but lead singer Thorn continues to make music in the same vein as their later electronica releases. Seasoned but fresh, this is euro-dance music for the middle-aged.\n\n20. Arctic Monkeys Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino\n\nThis album is a complete 180 from its predecessor, AM. This collection of songs is much more challenging and incorporates lounge, glam rock, and psychedelic pop, as well as elements of jazz. They took a chance and it paid off.\n\n1. Aimee Mann Mental Illness\n\nThroughout her 24-year solo career, Aimee Mann has released a solid catalog of extraordinary work. This one is certainly no exception, and in fact, might be one of her best. She can inhabit an assortment of characters with her trademark wit, wrapping the songs in stark arrangements that really showcase her talent as a songwriter. She set out to make her “saddest, slowest, and most acoustic” album to date, and boy did she deliver.\n\n2. Kendrick Lamar DAMN.\n\nDamn. showcases the profound rapper at the top of his game. This album finds him more self-reflective, but his social consciousness hasn’t wavered. The unification of music, lyrics, samples, and guest artists are all spot on, yet it’s Lamar’s singular voice and his message, that takes center stage and really shines.\n\n3. LCD Soundsystem American Dream\n\nDavid Bowie was responsible for James Murphy getting the band back together after they disbanded in 2011, and the world is a better place because of it. There are remnants of Bowie’s influence, along with the Talking Heads, scattered throughout, and like their previous records, it contains danceable, disco-punk, with hints of melancholy and musings of middle-age angst.\n\n4. The War On Drugs A Deeper Understanding\n\nThis album is filled with jammy guitar licks accompanied by striking melodies. Four albums in, the band have steadily improved. Their sound continues to remind me of Springsteen, with some Al Stewart sprinkled in. If you have a chance to see them live, I highly recommend it, as the music takes on a life of its own.\n\n5. Moses Sumney Aromanticism\n\nAmbient, dreamy, and lush are just a few words that come to mind when listening to this debut. He generates layers and textures through looping, to create a fresh sound that is uniquely his own. His falsetto and vocal range are impressive, and he has the songs to back up his sensuous voice.\n\n6. Charlotte Gainsbourg Rest\n\nSung primarily in French, this album comes from a place of anguish, so naturally, it has some dark overtones to it. It’s perfectly balanced with upbeat synths and beats courtesy of SebastiAn, known for his work with Frank Ocean. It brings to mind the sadness of Lana Del Rey paired with the Euro disco of Madonna’s Confessions On A Dancefloor.\n\n7. Perfume Genius No Shape\n\nMike Hadreas has said that one of the album’s influences was Talk Talk’s 1998 experimental album Spirit Of Eden and it shows. This album is a bit of a departure as he embraces a mellow prog-rock vibe, embellished with an array of instruments and sounds. He pushes himself to new levels, but the eeriness and intensity of his songwriting remain intact.\n\n8. Slowdive Slowdive\n\nHow did I miss this shoegazer band from the early nineties? Their last album was released in 1995, and this comeback album sounds like it could be from that era, without sounding dated. Fuzzy, distorted guitars and swirling synths are in abundance. “Slomo”, the hypnotic opening track, says it all.\n\n9. Kesha Rainbow\n\nTalk about a personal revolution. After years of turmoil, she comes out on top with her frank lyrics and a wide range of musical styles. It’s been a long journey from her days as a wild child into adulthood. She has always owned her persona, however, I feel on this album she’s finally letting her true colors show.\n\n10. Spoon Hot Thoughts\n\nSpoon is one of the most consistent bands in music today, firmly playing to their strengths with continued success. Their ninth studio album has more of a dance vibe but is still indie and edgy enough to be considered alternative.\n\n11. Tori Amos Natural Invader\n\nTori went into the studio to record an album made to reconnect with her mother’s family. The album took on a new direction after her mother suffered a stroke and the results of the 2016 election. It sways between personal and political, addressing themes of maternity, mythology, and environmental destruction. Tori sums it up best, “There are all these things happening in the record, this authority that seems to be making decisions about America’s resources, our Constitution – things are changing right before our eyes, and the record is tracking that.”\n\n12. Miguel War & Leisure\n\nWar & Leisure, the fourth studio album from the soul singer, is an appropriate title for this collection of songs. Throughout the album, he comments on our current state of affairs, without sounding preachy. He doesn’t consider himself a political artist explaining, “The biggest thing I was setting out to do was to create something that felt upbeat.” Mission accomplished.\n\n13. The New Pornographers White Out Conditions\n\nAfter years of making music, the band finally piqued my interest with its catchy melodies, lively production, and blended vocal harmonies. Their combination of alternative synth-rock and powerpop is the pick-me-up that I needed this year.\n\n14. SZA Ctrl\n\nSZA (Solána Imani Rowe) made quite a splash with her debut. Her vibe is part Erykah Badu, part Amy Winehouse as she mixes R&B, neo-soul, and hip-hop to create her sound. A talented new artist with a fresh voice, who’s definitely not afraid to use it.\n\n15. The xx I See You\n\nOn their third release, the London trio pushes the envelope and create a more accessible and livelier sound, without sacrificing any of the emotional intensity that defined their previous work. This album demonstrates a band that is willing to take chances and grow.\n\n16. Laura Marling Semper Femina\n\nThe title Semper Femina, which roughly translates from Latin to “woman is ever a fickle and changeable thing,” takes a phrase that could seem derogatory, and puts a positive spin on it. A concept album about femininity and female relationships, Marling delivers a powerful and captivating set, most notably “Soothing,” the opening track, which is her most adventurous song to date and also one of her best.\n\n17. Lana Del Rey Lust For Life\n\nThis release finds Lana embracing her sunnier side, although it’s hard to decipher at times through her veil of darkness. The songs are stark and vulnerable with a lushness that ties it all together. She expands her musical horizons, featuring guest artists for the first time, which include The Weeknd, Stevie Nicks, and Sean Ono Lennon.\n\n18. Thundercat Drunk\n\nStephen Bruner has an impressive resume, playing with Kendrick Lamar, Kamasi Washington, and Suicidal Tendencies to name just a few. The album has a soft rock 70s vibe (Kenny Loggins and Michael McDonald guest on one track), combined with some groove-filled jams, and rounded out with a mixture of jazz fusion, electronica, and R&B.\n\n19. Clap Your Hands Say Yeah The Tourist\n\nThis album rocks most weirdly. Pitchfork summed it up best by saying, “with renewed confidence, focus, and contentment, Alec Ounsworth delivers a consistently satisfying Clap Your Hands album, the best since their debut.” I couldn’t agree more.\n\n20. Strand Of Oaks Hard Love\n\nStrand of Oaks is a project by songwriter and producer Timothy Showalter, who I discovered when he performed an acoustic set on a local radio station. I was pleasantly surprised to find the record filled with some straight-up rock and roll, loaded with crunchy, raw guitars that remind me of Neil Young and Built To Spill.\n\n1. Beyoncé Lemonade\n\nI’ve always respected Beyoncé, though admittedly, I was not the biggest fan of her music. That all changed when I drank the Lemonade. From the opening number, you realize you are in for an emotional ride, as she explores her marriage and rumors of infidelity. This is not your typical pop record as she pushes herself lyrically and musically, seamlessly shifting from genre to genre, with the help of Jack White, The Weeknd, James Blake, and Kendrick Lamar. Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned and Bey is certainly no exception.\n\n2. David Bowie Blackstar\n\nReleased two days before his shocking death, Bowie released this incredible collection of songs that make quite a statement. Always looking to the future, he was inspired in part by Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp A Butterfly and combined elements of jazz, experimental rock, hip-hop, and more. He remained true to himself and his artistry until the very end. Talk about going out with a bang.\n\n3. Weyes Blood Front Row Seat To The Earth\n\nI stumbled upon this album on Pitchfork and was instantly captivated by the simplistic beauty of her voice paired with lush arrangements. Natalie Mering’s voice has pureness reminiscent of Joni Mitchell, Karen Carpenter, and Enya, which she blends with a Laurel Canyon sound, psychedelic folk, and touches of Celtic and Renaissance music. It sounds like a lot, but there is a delicate balance here, which pulls it all together.\n\n4. Lissie My Wild West\n\nBorn and raised in Illinois, Lissie gave it a go in Hollywood, only to develop a love-hate relationship with the city. In 2015, she ended up back in the Midwest and bought a ten-acre farm in Iowa. She chronicles these changes with great sincerity. Her voice has an ache in it similar to Patty Griffin with traces of Stevie Nicks and Fleetwood Mac. She finds the perfect balance in these songs, representing the urban and the rural, creating her own wild west.\n\n5. Frank Ocean Blonde\n\nIt took four years, but it was definitely worth the wait. Ocean’s follow-up to the critically acclaimed Channel Orange is a bit more ambiguous and experimental, as he challenges the listener to engage. He seems like an artist who’s still exorcising his demons, and lets you into his world, without giving too much away.\n\n6. Radiohead A Moon Shaped Pool\n\nOn their ninth album, these British veterans are still making viable music without regard to the latest trends. For me, this release didn’t have the initial impact of their previous work, but upon repeated listens, it began to take hold. This beautifully quiet piece is rich with subtleties as they continue to push themselves not only as a band but as artists.\n\n7. Mitski Puberty 2\n\nOn the closing track “A Burning Hill”, Mitski sings “I am the fire and I am the forest, and I am the witness watching it”, which pretty much sums up the angst and sadness on this collection. Born in Japan and living in New York, the indie rocker’s fourth album is a hodgepodge of personal but relatable songs that recall St. Vincent and Liz Phair, yet are entirely her own. It’s spacious, grungy production may be reminiscent of the ’90s, but she’s not stuck in the past, as this sounds refreshing and current.\n\n8. Sturgill Simpson A Sailor’s Guide To Earth\n\nAs one of country music’s new pioneers, Simpson is more roots-rock than twang. On his latest, he incorporates big brass with 1960s-soul that sets him apart from his peers. His reflective version of Nirvana’s “In Bloom” breathes new life into the modern-day classic.\n\n9. Solange A Seat At The Table\n\nBeyoncé may have topped most critics lists, but little sister Solange definitely came into her own this year. The album packs a punch, albeit a more understated one, with themes including rage, despair, and empowerment. Most impressive is that she wrote the majority of these songs unaccompanied. She says “It’s more than an album to me. It’s a transitional time in my life.” I couldn’t agree more.\n\n10. Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds Skeleton Tree\n\nSkeleton Tree is a dark and emotional album with minimal production that deals with loss and death, as well as survival, particularly in response to the death of Cave’s son Arthur. He reminds us how powerful grief can be and how eventually, we need to muster the strength to keep on living.\n\n11. Leonard Cohen You Want It Darker\n\nOn his fourteenth and final studio album, the Canadian crooner offered a glimpse into his own mortality. It was created while Cohen was dying and there are plenty of references to death, God, and love. His light may be extinguished, but his music will continue to burn bright.\n\n12. Michael Kiwanuka Love & Hate\n\n“Cold Little Heart”, the opening track on his sophomore release, sounds like a collaboration between Bill Withers & Pink Floyd. Clocking in at ten minutes, it’s an epic piece full of intensity and drama that makes quite an impact. He does a lot of soul-searching on this record, tackling issues of isolation, race, and identity.\n\n13. Car Seat Headrest Teens Of Denial\n\nCar Seat Headrest began as a solo recording project in 2010 by Will Toledo, and on his thirteenth studio album, he formed a band that delivered guitar-driven music filled with riffs both quiet and explosive. It reminds me of what Pavement would sound like if Beck fronted the band.\n\n14. Angel Olsen My Woman\n\nAngel reminds me of a cross between Lana Del Rey and Neko Case. The music is both delicate and gritty, as she takes on a variety of styles. Influences include Fleetwood Mac, The Shirelles, and Crazy Horse, and it shows.\n\n15. Lisa Hannigan At Swim\n\nA native of Ireland, Hannigan was featured on Damien Rice’s first two solo albums which added an ethereal quality to his sound. She continues that on her third solo album, letting the nuances shine and placing the focus on her beautifully haunting voice.\n\n16. Ray LaMontagne Ouroboros\n\nThis feels like a throwback to a time when you would listen to an album in its entirety. LaMontagne says “I wrote it as an entire piece, as a 40-minute piece of music...to really enjoy it, I think you really need to sit down and listen to it as a whole.” It’s the only way to really appreciate this album.\n\n17. Pete Yorn Arranging Time\n\nPete has been quietly making records since 2000 and on his latest, he continues to let the songs do the talking. He says, “This new record represents a step forward in sonics and creativity while celebrating and honoring some of the groundwork I laid back in the early part of the century.” Understated and introspective, it showcases some solid tunes that are both accessible and memorable.\n\n18. Savages Adore Life\n\nIt’s tempting to call their sophomore effort more accessible than their debut, but that would downplay the risks that they are taking with their music. It may contain a couple of ballads, but they’re still fired up and the intensity is there, just in a more subtle way.\n\n19. Kaleo A / B\n\nYou wouldn’t know that they were Icelandic (except for one song sung in their native tongue) by the type of music they play: Bluesy, soulful, garage rock. Another great export, this foursome knows how to tear it up and makes a very memorable major-label debut.\n\n20. White Denim Stiff\n\nThis album starts with a bang and immediately takes you back to bands like Thin Lizzy and other rock bands from the ’60s and ’70s. While their formula hasn’t changed much, there is an evolution on this album and a more cohesive sound.\n\n1. Sufjan Stevens Carrie & Lowell\n\nSufjan was inspired by the death of his mother, Carrie, who suffered from mental illness and addiction. These quietly moving songs are like snapshots of his childhood and the family trips that they took to Oregon. He bares his soul on these songs, which explore family, grief, depression, loneliness, faith, and rebirth. It’s an honest and loving tribute to a woman who he may not have truly known but loved just the same.\n\n2. Adele 25\n\nWhat can I say that hasn’t already been said? It’s that good! This album is chock full of hooks and earworms, all propelled by her powerhouse vocals. The perfect balance of light and dark makes this a modern-day classic from pop’s old soul.\n\n3. Laura Marling Short Movie\n\nOn her fifth album, Marling has created her most celebrated work to date. The record deals with Marling’s feelings of isolation and detachment while living in Los Angeles for a brief time. It’s a bit of a departure since it’s her first record in which she plays the electric guitar, in addition to the acoustic guitar, giving some songs an added urgency. While comparisons to Joni Mitchell continue, Marling is a true original with a unique voice and a gift for songwriting and storytelling.\n\n4. Marina And The Diamonds Froot\n\nThe British singer-songwriter continues to make catchy, dance-pop music that is both playful and smart. As a solo songwriter and co-producer, Marina is in control and has described the album as considerably “reflective” in comparison to her previous releases. The quiet, stark opener “Happy” beautifully sets the tone for a cohesive collection where her powerful voice remains the focus.\n\n5. Kendrick Lamar To Pimp A Butterfly\n\nLamar has proven to be a visionary and way ahead of the game. The album is very ambitious and was influenced by aspects of funk, jazz, and spoken word. There is a somewhat relaxed flow to his delivery, but his lyrical commentary on social issues is much more direct and in your face. This album is definitely a sign of the times.\n\n6. Father John Misty I Love You, Honeybear\n\nJosh Tillman doesn’t stray far from the formula that made his debut so dynamic. He described the album as a concept album about himself, sharing personal experiences about courting and eventually marrying his wife. Never one to shy away from the intimate details, he discloses them through his brand of satire, cynicism, and humor. He handles it with just enough reserve and tenderness to put you at ease.\n\n7. Florence And The Machine How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful\n\nFlorence gets personal on this new venture and the results pay off. She is no longer hiding behind lyrical metaphors, instead of taking a more direct and honest approach to her writing. There is a good mix of rocking anthems with some beautiful ballads. When making the record she says “I wanted to make something that was big but that had a gentleness to it, that had a warmth, that was rooted.”\n\n8. Low Ones And Sixes\n\nThe quintessential slowcore band has been on a roll recently, and this album is no exception, as they add another intense and self-assured album to their catalog. They stick to the same framework of balancing sparse instrumentation with ethereal vocals, yet somehow continue to expand their sound. Co-founders Mimi Parker and Alan Sparhawk, a couple since their late teens, continue to share the details of their relationship, for better or for worse. It sounds hauntingly familiar and remarkably beautiful.\n\n9. Sleater-Kinney No Cities To Love\n\nThe former Nineties’ riot grrrls are back and ready to rock, as the trio returns with their first album in ten years. The opening track, “Price Tag” sets the fiery tone, and it doesn’t let up. The music is edgy and aggressive, proving they haven’t lost any of their angst from the decade that defined them.\n\n10. Cassandra Wilson Coming Forth By Day\n\nThe contemporary jazz vocalist has been making innovative music for years. This particular outing is a tribute to Billie Holiday and she handles it with both grace and ease. Covering standards like “Don’t Explain” and “Strange Fruit”, she sings in her unmistakable vocal range, making the songs her own. A wide variety of musicians guest on the album, including T-Bone Burnett, Nick Zinner (Yeah Yeah Yeahs), and a rhythm section from The Bad Seeds. She creates a compelling collection that would make Lady Day proud.\n\n11. Janet Jackson Unbreakable\n\nMs. Jackson is back and what a welcome return it is. She reunites with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis for the first time in 8 years, and it’s exactly what she needed. This is the first time she has broken her silence since the death of Michael, and this feels like a fitting tribute, even channeling his vocal style on certain songs. His spirit appears throughout the record, but it’s Janet’s resilience that truly shines here.\n\n12. Lana Del Rey Honeymoon\n\nThe queen of sadness continues her exploration of melancholy and desolation to create some mesmerizing music. There are plenty of modern-day references, but it still sounds like it’s from a different era. Cinematic is a word that continues to come to mind when describing her music.\n\n13. Jamie xx In Colour\n\nThe debut album by the English producer and member of The xx blends electronica, house, dancehall, and rave to create an experimental ambient collection. It features his bandmates Romy Croft and Oliver Sim as guest vocalists on a couple of standout tracks. He plays nicely with tone and atmosphere to create moody ballads, dance floor anthems, and hypnotic instrumentals.\n\n14. Julia Holter Have You In My Wilderness\n\nThis is the composer, keyboardist, and singer’s third album. Her brand of experimental pop has a dreaminess that recalls a ’60s Nico or a mellow St. Vincent. Light, airy and ambient, with an abundance of strings, you can lose yourself in the haze, but still feel wide awake.\n\n15. Joanna Newsom Divers\n\nThe harpist and keyboardist enter Kate Bush territory with her distinct soprano and elaborate wordplay and compositions. While she may be an acquired taste, this album is a bit more refined and conventional than her previous work, but still draws on elements of each of them. The beautiful and complex compositions along with the delicate production make this record sound timeless.\n\n16. Chris Stapleton Traveler\n\nAs a songwriter in Nashville, Stapleton has written hits for Kenny Chesney, Darius Rucker, Tim McGraw, and Dierks Bentley to name a few. On this debut, his brand of country is more reminiscent of Johnny Cash or Bruce Springsteen, rather than the artists that he writes for. His heartfelt music is a breath of fresh air for the genre.\n\n17. Björk Vulnicura\n\nBjörk said that this album expresses her feelings before and after her breakup with artist Matthew Barney. She pours her heart out on these songs which take her from unease, to despair to eventual healing. Never one to shy away from experimentation, the album is primarily composed of string arrangements and electronic beats and would fit nicely between 1997’s Homogenic and 2000’s Selma Songs.\n\n18. Built To Spill Untethered Moon\n\nThe band’s eighth studio album is their first to feature a new rhythm section. Despite the personnel changes, there is no lack of energy here. The sound is loose and free, with fuzzy guitars and melodious tunes still at the forefront. The more things change, the more they stay the same.\n\n19. Panda Bear Panda Bear Meets The Grim Reaper\n\nNoah Lennox, the experimental musician and co-founding member of Animal Collective, released his fifth solo album under his moniker Panda Bear. He continues to play with a variety of sounds, textures, and swirling effects. He was aiming for a more “lively” and “busy” sound, which he definitely achieved.\n\n20. Modest Mouse Strangers To Ourselves\n\nThe Portland band took eight years off and come back sounding fresh as ever. Still letting their freak flag fly, the songs are accessible with just the right amount of peculiarity to make them interesting. They may not be breaking much new ground here, but songs like “Lampshades On Fire” and “The Ground Walks, With Time In A Box” are good examples of their continuing evolution.\n\n1. Beck Morning Phase\n\nMorning Phase could be considered a companion piece to his brilliant 2002 breakup album Sea Change. It could have easily been called Mourning Phase because something is surely dying. Stunning harmonies, dreamy melodies, and airy production create an emotional landscape that slowly and sadly unfolds. As far as I know, Beck is happily married with a family, but you’d never know it from this collection of heartbreaking songs.\n\n2. Sia 1000 Forms Of Fear\n\nAfter writing hits for Rihanna, Beyoncé, and Ne-Yo, Sia is back in the forefront and it’s a welcome return. No longer hiding behind other voices, she writes from the heart exposing her dark side by chronicling her mental breakdown and struggle with addiction. Her voice is intoxicating and she pushes it to the limit. It’s what truly excels here, along with her infectious hooks that pack a punch and stick with you. Out of the darkness and into the spotlight.\n\n3. Broken Bells After The Disco\n\nDescribed as “the perfect soundtrack for the morning after,” these songs have an effortless, danceable vibe. Listen closely though and you’ll hear themes of failed expectations, lost love, and desperation. Heady stuff disguised in Danger Mouse’s 70s meets 80s style production, that will make you want to hit the dance floor and forget your problems.\n\n4. Rosanne Cash The River & The Thread\n\nCash returned to her birthplace of Memphis, TN which served as the inspiration for this fully realized “concept” album. It focuses on family and all that you leave behind. Co-written with guitarist and husband John Leventhal, it honors both personal and public history. Proof that it’s never too late to go back home.\n\n5. Annie Lennox Nostalgia\n\nThe soul diva tries her hand at covering standards like “I Put A Spell On You,” “Summertime” & “Strange Fruit” with stunning results. Her peerless voice is the perfect accompaniment for her interpretation of these classics. She did not take the task lightly, immersing herself in the history of the previous recordings, and it definitely shows.\n\n6. St. Vincent St. Vincent\n\nIt was a big year for self-titled records, and this one may be the most appropriate as Annie Clark seems to have found her voice as an artist. Taking a cue from her former collaborator David Bryne, she walks a fine line of mixing art and commerce. Her live performance at the State Theatre was one of my highlights from last year.\n\n7. Pixies Indie Cindy\n\nThe pixies are back as a trio since bassist Kim Deal left the band to focus on some solo music and The Breeders. While her presence is missed, the band’s sound is still intact. The songs retain some of the intensity they displayed in their early recordings while fitting in nicely with today’s sonic landscape. Infectious hooks, blaring guitars, and biting lyrics make this album stand out among the countless contemporary bands that they have inspired.\n\n8. Weezer Everything Will Be Alright In The End\n\nIn their 20th year as a band, these guys still have it. It’s been four years since their last record, and this is a welcome return. Working with Ric Ocasek again, they mixed catchy, power-pop melodies with snarky lyrics. Everything you’d expect from them.\n\n9. Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers Hypnotic Eye\n\nIt’s hard to believe that this is the band’s 13th album and they can still sound so fresh. Not much has changed over the years: Solid songwriting, straight-ahead rock ‘n’ roll with no frills that only gets better with age.\n\n10. Sharon Van Etten Are We There\n\nOn her fourth album, the subtle singer-songwriter wears her passion on her sleeve. I didn’t know much about her music until 2012’s Tramp, but she seems to be evolving in all the right ways, by staying true to herself. It feels like the perfect soundtrack for a road trip, remembering that the journey is more important than the destination.\n\n11. Ty Segall Manipulator\n\nThis album covers a lot of territories and it all melds together quite nicely. Fueled by fuzzy, jangling guitars and some Beatle-Esque melodies, this album is one that everyone can enjoy, not just the hipsters. I look forward to hearing more from this prolific artist.\n\n12. Temples Sun Structures\n\nThese English rockers come on strong with their updated version of psychedelic rock on their debut album. Their sound harks back to the British Invasion of the mid-1960s. Catchy, trippy, and intriguing.\n\n13. Natalie Merchant Natalie Merchant\n\nThe self-titled album is her first release of original songs in 13 years and was definitely worth that wait. Her voice sounds as pure as it did in the mid-80s when she burst onto the scene. She continues to write about heavy subjects, framing the songs in a blend of electric and acoustic sounds including string, brass, and woodwinds. The self-produced album deals with issues of “love gained and lost, regret, denial, surrender, greed, destructiveness, defeat, and occasional triumph.” Heavy indeed.\n\n14. Chrissie Hynde Stockholm\n\nHer first solo album is one of the lightest records she’s made. Collaborating with Björn Yttling of the Swedish pop band Peter Bjorn and John, Hynde describes the music as “ABBA meets John Lennon”. While she explores her poppier side, certain songs evoke the work of her band The Pretenders, primarily the track “Down The Wrong Way”, which rocks with the help of Neil Young’s distinctive guitar playing. Ultimately, it’s her unique voice that draws you in and keeps you coming back.\n\n15. Spoon They Want My Soul\n\nOn their eighth album, Brit Daniel & Co. bring their A-game once again. They continue to push themselves in different directions, without deviating too far from their signature sound. Indie rock at its best.\n\n16. The Afghan Whigs Do To The Beast\n\nI never got into this band when they were at their peak in the early 90s. After 16 years of silence, they came back with a roar that mixes heavy guitar solos and soaring choruses. After seeing them live for the first time this year, I now know what all the fuss is about.\n\n17. Lana Del Rey Ultraviolence\n\nI always thought she was slightly overrated, but my opinion has changed with this album. With the help of Dan Auerbach producing, she creates a cohesive assortment of songs that could easily be a film noir soundtrack. Cinematic, dark, and hazy.\n\n18. Against Me! Transgender Dysphoria Blues\n\nIn 2012, singer and guitarist Thomas James Gabel publicly came out as transgender. Taking the name Laura Jane Grace, he began a transition to living life as a woman. Their sixth studio album details the process and emotional turmoil involved with it. The album has the fierceness and urgency of their previous releases, proving that Grace is a force to be reckoned with.\n\n19. The War On Drugs Lost In The Dream\n\nThe indie rock band from Philly was the critic’s darling this year. Having been together since 2005, this was the year that the band broke through and reached a wider audience. The songs are loose and jammy, with echoes of Fleetwood Mac, Bruce Springsteen, and The Waterboys displayed throughout.\n\n20. Brody Dalle Diploid Love\n\nBrody is an Australian-born singer-songwriter and guitarist who is best known as the frontwoman of The Distillers. On her first solo album, she channels both punk and pop. She was intrigued by Cyndi Lauper and the Beatles as a child and it shows on this collection. A welcome addition to the Aussie invasion.\n\n1. Daft Punk Random Access Memories\n\nThe kings of EDM do a complete turnaround by tapping into the past and making it sound fresh. The opening track, “Give Life Back To Music”, would fit nicely on a Chic album circa 1978. The French duo compiled a variety of artists including Nile Rodgers, Pharrell Williams, Giorgio Moroder, Julian Casablancas, Panda Bear, and ’70s icon Paul Williams. Unlike their previous albums, they avoided the use of samples and employed session musicians to record live instrumentation. Groundbreaking indeed.\n\n2. Queens Of The Stone Age …Like Clockwork\n\nOn their sixth studio album, Josh Homme and company incorporate stoner rock accompanied by twists and turns that make for some compelling songwriting. While the hooks are appealing and accessible, there is a darkness that lingers throughout. It has all the grittiness and edge of a classic modern rock album. The record is chock-full of special guests which include Dave Grohl, Mark Lanegan, Trent Reznor, Jake Shears (Scissor Sisters), Alex Turner (Arctic Monkeys) & Elton John.\n\n3. Arctic Monkeys AM\n\nThe Monkeys explore some new territory on their fifth album. Taking inspiration from various musical genres, including psychedelic rock, blues, hard rock, heavy metal, R&B, hip hop, and soul. The slick production only enhances these melodious tunes.\n\n4. Low The Invisible Way\n\nLow celebrated their 20th anniversary as a band this past year. On their 10th record, not much has changed and that’s a good thing. Jeff Tweedy produced the album, keeping it simple and sparse and letting the songs shine. Drummer Mimi Parker is more of an equal on this release, singing lead on five songs which she handles with both grace and charm.\n\n5. Johnny Marr The Messenger\n\nMarr has been involved with a variety of bands over the years: The Smiths, Electronic, Modest Mouse, and The The to name just a few. The guitarist finally released his first solo album and it’s definitely worth the wait. The album incorporates bits and pieces from his musical history, with the focal point being his stellar guitar playing. He crafts some catchy melodies that conjure the past, yet manages to make it sound current.\n\n6. The National Trouble Will Find Me\n\nThe band continues in the same vein as their previous release: Subtle, moody, and sullen. Even on the more upbeat songs, a shroud of melancholy lingers in the airy compositions. Gorgeous arrangements like “I Need My Girl” are haunting perfection.\n\n7. Mikal Cronin MCII\n\nSoaring melodies over jangly guitar riffs, this album sounds effortless, yet complex. It’s jangle pop at it’s best.\n\n8. Arcade Fire Reflektor\n\nThe Suburbs, Arcade Fire’s well-received album from 2010, marked a high point for the band. It was a tough act to follow, but they delivered. The band manages to push itself, mixing sounds and beats with the help of producer James Murphy from LCD Soundsystem. All the while, retaining the integrity that made them a great band in the first place. However, the album could have benefited from a little editing, trimming it down to a single album.\n\n9. Laura Marling Once I Was An Eagle\n\nFour albums into her career, The 23-year-old Marling continues to push the boundaries of contemporary songwriting. The first 4 songs of the album blend seamlessly into one another, setting the scene for some formidable storytelling. She certainly earns the Joni Mitchell comparisons and is destined to be the new queen of Avant folk.\n\n10. Elton John The Diving Board\n\nThe queen is back. Reunited with Bernie Taupin on lyrics and T-Bone Burnett producing, Burnett lets him shine by stripping down the production to the piano, bass, and drums. By doing so, Elton finds his way back to his roots. It’s emotional and somber, with enough pops of radiance to balance it out. Some of these songs would sound right at home on some of his early recordings. All hail the queen!\n\n11. Savages Silence Yourself\n\nThis all-female band from London certainly knows how to rock. They combine the intensity of Siouxsie And The Banshees, with the melancholy of Joy Division, to make some dismal rock and roll with much urgency. Be sure to check out their live show, you will not be disappointed.\n\n12. Vampire Weekend Modern Vampires Of The City\n\nIn 2008, I ranked their self-titled debut at #6 on my list. In 2010, I picked Contra as the most over-rated album of the year. Needless to say, I was a little tentative going into the new record. It took me a while to listen, but once I did, I realized what a gem it is. I’m happy to be proved wrong.\n\n13. Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds Push The Sky Away\n\nNick Cave continues to inspire on his 15th album. According to Cave, the songs illustrate how the internet has influenced “significant events, momentary fads and mystically-tinged absurdities”. The music is desolate and lush, combined with lyrics teeming with an ambiguity that read like poetry.\n\n14. Jagwar Ma Howlin\n\nThese lads from Down Under made a splash with their brand of psychedelic dance music. Fun, groovy & bright. This is the album MGMT should have made.\n\n15. Foxygen We Are The 21st Century Ambassadors Of Peace & Magic\n\nThis album wears its musical influences on its sleeve. ’60s garage rock, psychedelic, hippie rock, and soul make up the musical terrain. It all blends together nicely, creating something new from something familiar.\n\n16. Midlake Antiphon\n\nDuring the recording of this album, Tim Smith (founding member, vocalist, guitarist, and primary songwriter) left the band. I expected something to be missing, but the band managed to forge ahead with ease. Guitarist Eric Pulido took over singing duties and is certainly up for the challenge. Their loss is our gain.\n\n17. The Thermals Desperate Ground\n\nThe band from Portland OR released their first record back in 2003, although I just recently discovered them (thanks Barb). I love their intensity and blend of lo-fi, power pop and punk rock. Clocking in at only 27 minutes, it’s an album that you can easily put on repeat.\n\n18. Atlas Genius When It Was Now\n\nIt was a good year for the Aussies. The debut from this trio has a little bit of everything: rock, pop, dance, and hipster appeal.\n\n19. Deerhunter Monomania\n\nWeird. Complex. Accessible. Distorted. Diverse. All good things.\n\n20. Franz Ferdinand Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action\n\nI didn’t realize how I missed them until I heard the new record. They don’t sound much different than they did back in 2004 when they released their first record. A welcome return.\n\n1. Frank Ocean Channel Orange\n\nFrank Ocean made a lot of noise this year, not only by what he said but more importantly, by what he conveyed through his music. I was captivated by this record as I listened to his powerful, soulful voice tell tales of superficial LA paired with his own heartfelt emotions of longing, love, and isolation. His sincerity and passion reminded me of Stevie Wonder and Prince. His profound voice and anecdotes made for some of the best commentaries this year. This is a man who not only found his voice but perhaps the voice of his generation.\n\n2. Kathleen Edwards Voyageur\n\nYou know I love a great break-up record, well this is a divorce one that chronicles the demise of her relationship with her former guitarist. The album shows Edwards expanding her sound with the help of Justin Vernon (aka Bon Iver) who co-produced the album with her. Throughout the process, their relationship developed into something more than just a working one (they have since separated). It’s a confessional album about transition and moving forward, rather than looking back. Lyrics dealing with heartbreak, loneliness, and emptiness are juxtaposed with music that is lush and layered with subtle sounds and grungy guitars. The subtle nuances of Suzanne Vega and Neil Young come to mind. Her loss is definitely our gain.\n\n3. Father John Misty Fear Fun\n\nAfter years of recording under his name J. Tillman, in addition to being the Fleet Foxes drummer for a few years, Joshua decided it was time to reinvent himself and headed to California in his van “with enough mushrooms to choke a horse”. The result is his trippy alter ego Father John Misty who sounds like a throwback to ’60’s psychedelia. References to Hollywood, drugs, sex, and mischief are sung in his stunning voice that’s comparable to Harry Nilsson. The floating, airy quality of “Nancy From Now On” sounds like an updated take on the classic soft rock sound that Michael McDonald perfected. Fun indeed!\n\n4. Perfume Genius Put Your Back N 2 It\n\nWith the combination of his striking and haunting voice (similar to Antony Hegarty of Antony & The Johnsons), with his revealing, bare-it-all lyrics, this little record really packs a punch. Mike Hadreas, the man behind the songs, shows us intimate glimpses into his personal trauma but manages to turn it into something really beautiful. The production is sparse and thankfully so. This way you can focus on the most important thing: Songwriting.\n\n5. Jack White Blunderbuss\n\nThis album sounds like a classic from the very start. Backed by some stellar musicians, it’s energetic and musically varied with plenty of keyboard rifts and raging guitar solos. On his first solo album, White continues to channel Robert Plant and The Rolling Stones with great results. All the while, he still manages to create a sound that’s all his own. The best way to experience this album is to actually stop and listen...and turn the volume up.\n\n6. Grizzly Bear Shields\n\nThese Brooklynites continue to expand their sound on their fourth studio album. The band plays with musical textures and ambient soundscapes, persistent in being imaginative and inventive in their quest for new sounds. On “What’s Wrong” the band sounds more like a jazz quartet than an indie rock band. The hipsters are growing up.\n\n7. Dr. John Locked Down\n\nAt 71, “Mac” may have made the best album of his career, and this man has had quite a career. The album features The Black Keys’ guitarist and singer Dan Auerbach as guitarist, background vocalist, and producer. While his presence is definitely felt, he doesn’t take over the heart of Dr. John, who continues to combine blues, jazz, zydeco, boogie-woogie, and rock and roll. His passion is still burning bright.\n\n8. Calexico Algiers\n\nOn their 7th studio album, the Americana Tex-Mex Tucson band took their signature sound and breathed new life into it. The fact that they recorded it in New Orleans may have something to do with it. The album is full of post-Katrina themes, but the spirit of the Southwest still permeates the songs. A magnificent album from start to finish.\n\n9. The Shins Port Of Morrow\n\nAlthough this could technically be considered a solo project by James Mercer, it has all the essential characteristics of a classic Shins album. While it may be a bit overly produced for some, the songs are still there, hook and all.\n\n10. Leonard Cohen Old Ideas\n\nAn old soul with new ideas. It’s classic Leonard with his smoky baritone contrasted with his angelic-sounding backup singers. He still has a lot on his mind whether it be mortality, betrayal, desire, or regret. He sums it up best on “Darkness” singing “I caught the darkness, drinking from your cup. I said ‘is this contagious?’, you said ‘just drink it up.’” Cheers!\n\n11. Bob Mould Silver Age\n\nBob is back with a vengeance. This collection of angst-filled songs echoes his earlier solo work and former band Sugar. With heavy guitars, pounding rhythms, and biting lyrics, he proves you’re never too old to rage. Silver age? More like the golden age.\n\n12. Sinéad O’Connor How About I Be Me (And You Be You)?\n\nMany called it a return to form. The fiery singer combines all the rage and intensity that made her first two albums so compelling. And that voice? Still intact and incredibly powerful. She definitely put her heart and soul into it, even suffering a breakdown shortly after recording it. In “Very Far From Home” she sings, “I was too free if that’s possible to be” Unfortunately, the truth has yet to set her free.\n\n13. Beach House Bloom\n\nThey managed to follow up 2010’s critically acclaimed “Teen Dream” with another solid effort. Sounding a lot like the Cocteau Twins, lead singer Victoria Legrand’s ethereal voice is an integral part of their sound, and she uses it as an instrument. Spacious and dreamy, yet grounded.\n\n14. Django Django Django Django\n\nThe first of two debut albums from British acts to make the list. These lads fuse a combination of sounds to create some uptempo grooves. Think Beck meets MGMT meets The Beach Boys. Complex, quirky and fun.\n\n15. Dark Dark Dark Who Needs Who\n\nA local band from Minneapolis that I had heard of, but never really listened to. Their sound is described as a blend of New Orleans jazz, Americana, Eastern European folk, and pop. It reminded me of Florence + The Machine light. This album took a little while to catch on, but once it did, I was hooked.\n\n16. Lost In The Trees A Church That Fits Our Needs\n\nI admit it, there’s a lot of records on this year’s list that deals with heavy issues, and this is definitely one of them. This album focuses primarily on lead singer Ari Picker’s mother, who took her own life in 2009. While it sounds depressing, it’s actually quite the opposite. Instead of being completely direct, he uses metaphors and imagery to refer to the tragedy. With elaborate classical style arrangements and his passionate tenor, you could easily imagine this as Thom Yorke scoring a soundtrack for a movie. A beautiful and moving tribute.\n\n17. Michael Kiwanuka Home Again\n\nFrom the opening note, it sounds like you’re listening to a Van Morrison album circa 1970. Or is it Sam Cooke? On his debut album, the 24-year-old Brit channels the old songs and sounds of vintage R&B, without ever sounding cliché.\n\n18. Dinosaur Jr. I Bet On The Sky\n\nWith releases from Neil Young, Gary Clarke Jr. & Jack White, to name just a few, I am calling this “the year of the guitar”. Sounding like they did in the early ’90s, these guys haven’t changed much, which is just fine. On their 10th release, J Mascis continues to use distorted guitars and his “whiny low-key drawl” to drive the songs forward.\n\n19. Amy Ray Lung Of Love\n\nBetter known as one half of the Indigo Girls, Amy was always been the edgier one. Since 2001, she’s been releasing solo albums on her own imprint. This sadly overlooked album finds her in fine form. In her husky voice, she convincingly sings about failed relationships, yearning, and regret. Brandi Carlile and My Morning Jacket’s Jim James provide some backup vocals.\n\n20. Magic Castles Magic Castles\n\nTaking a page from The Velvet Underground’s book, this album sounds like it was recorded in a smoky haze at The Factory. Think of a drugged-out version of the Stone Roses or The Feelies. And, they’re a Minneapolis band to boot.\n\n21. Alabama Shakes Boys & Girls\n\nThe breakout band of the year. Led by the charismatic frontwoman Brittany Howard, the Shakes conjure up the soulful sounds of Otis Redding and Janis Joplin but manage to keep it fresh. Full of power and passion, this is a band that is not afraid to wear their hearts on their sleeves or their influences.\n\n1. R.E.M. Collapse Into Now\n\nI had this album on repeat back in March when it was released, prior to the announcement that the band was breaking up. I’m not sure how this album flew so far under the radar. It’s a total return to form and sounds like the band from the early nineties, but with more introspection. The album contains themes of change which was fitting for my state of mind. It became my personal soundtrack as I transitioned from NY to MN. Collapse into now indeed.\n\n2. PJ Harvey Let England Shake\n\nPolly Jean is an ever-changing chameleon. On this album, she takes on the horrors of war and the politics that propel them. While not the most uplifting of themes, she uses her passionate voice to evoke a powerful narration. A beautiful commentary on the harsh realities of life during wartime.\n\n3. Low C’mon\n\nOn their ninth full-length album, the trio continues the evolution of slowcore, the genre they helped define. Recorded in an old church, the sound is spacious and airy. The songs are affecting and the vocal harmonies that they are known for are beautiful and moving. The eight-minute builder “Nothing But Heart” (with the help of Nels Cline on guitar) showcases their knack for simplicity. Sometimes less is more.\n\n4. Bon Iver Bon Iver\n\nThis album takes you on a journey that you won’t want to end. The use of strings and woodwinds are gorgeous and enhance the songs with their subtly. The result is a sonic landscape that stretches for miles.\n\n5. The Decemberists The King Is Dead\n\n“The best R.E.M. album in years” was going to be the tagline. Well, that all changed when R.E.M. actually released an album a few months later. With the help of Peter Buck and Gillian Welch, this album would have fit nicely between Document and Green. The Decemberists certainly embraced their inner Americana with stellar results.\n\n6. Washed Out Within And Without\n\nPart of the Chillwave movement in which synth is in. Ernest Greene, the man behind the MacBook, enlisted the help of Ben H. Allen (Animal Collective’s “Merriweather Post Pavilion”) who co-produced the album with him. It’s both dreamy and dancey: Think Yo La Tengo meets New Order.\n\n7. Adele 21\n\nYes, this album has been overplayed to death, but think back to when you first heard it. You’ll remember the power and beauty of that voice paired with her confessional break-up songs, which makes for one compelling record.\n\n8. Radiohead The King Of Limbs\n\nI don’t think they are capable of making a bad record. Always one step ahead, they keep pushing themselves and continue to seek out new territory. Many try to emulate them, but few succeed.\n\n9. Girls Father, Son, Holy Ghost\n\nIdentity crisis or tribute? This album sounds like it was made by a variety of different bands: The Beach Boys, Love & Rockets, Band of Horses, Pink Floyd & Wilco to name just a few. Every song has a unique sound, yet it all goes together so well.\n\n10. St. Vincent Strange Mercy\n\nAnnie Clark is a guitar goddess and continues to experiment with sounds using her extensive pedalboards. While her third record may be her most accessible, it’s also her most personal.\n\n11. Marianne Faithful Horses And High Heels\n\nArmed with a stellar band (and guest appearances from Lou Reed and Dr. John) this album was recorded in New Orleans and it shows. It contains some bluesy covers along with a few originals. With her trademark gravelly voice, Faithful sings like a survivor who seems content with where she is in life.\n\n12. Tom Waits Bad As Me\n\nIt’s hard to believe that he’s been making music since the early seventies and is not only relevant but truly original. This record contains some of the clanking percussion found on Bone Machine as well as some poignant ballads reminiscent of his earlier work. No matter what the production, it’s the songwriting that’s at the heart of these songs.\n\n13. The Black Keys El Camino\n\nWhile this album just came out in December, it quickly grabbed my attention. The album feels more like a straight-ahead rock album than their previous efforts. With help from producer Danger Mouse, it marks the first time the Keys have co-written songs with a third party. Who says three’s a crowd?\n\n14. Laura Marling A Creature I Don’t Know\n\nAt 21, this English folk musician already has three albums under her belt, with this one being her strongest. Her songwriting and voice remind me of a younger Joni Mitchell, to which she is often compared. I would add Joan Baez, Sandy Denny, and Linda Thompson in there as well.\n\n15. Wilco The Whole Love\n\nLike Radiohead, Wilco is a band that continues to move forward with each release, while managing to stay true to themselves. The Whole Love continues to push them in the right direction.\n\n16. Fleet Foxes Helplessness Blues\n\nCapitalizing on the success of their debut album, Robin Pecknold and company stick to the formula that won fans over in the first place. Complex folk songs with vocal harmonies remain intact, but with some dramatic turns that challenge the listener to grow with them.\n\n17. M83 Hurry Up, We’re Dreaming\n\nA double album by the French electronic musician Anthony Gonzalez, who said he recorded the album as a way to remember his childhood. He’s referring in part to the days when kids would make the trip to their local record store and listen to albums and dissect all its parts. The music combines electropop, ambient and new wave with an updated 80’s production style. A great way to relive your past.\n\n18. Paul Simon So Beautiful Or So What\n\nWithout a doubt, his best album since 1990’s The Rhythm Of The Saints. Simon continues to fuse world music with his straight-ahead approach to storytelling.\n\n19. James Blake James Blake\n\nHis music is a little hard to classify...dubstep? electronica? synthpop? Regardless, his voice is alluring and he distorts it through the use of Auto-Tune and vocoders. This English electronic music producer and singer-songwriter could be considered the experimental and haunting equivalent to Bon Iver.\n\n20. Liam Finn Fomo\n\nLiam has some big shoes to fill as the son of musician Neil Finn (of Split Enz and Crowded House). He certainly lives up to those expectations with his latest release. He may sound a lot like his father, but he has a voice all his own.\n\n1. Natalie Merchant Leave Your Sleep\n\nA labor of love and a highly ambitious project. The lyrics are those of English and American poets that she set to music. It contains a wide variety of musical styles including folk, waltzes, country & bluegrass, jazz, reggae, R&B, Cajun, Celtic, Balkan & Chinese folk. She may be all over the map, but it’s a very cohesive double album. It’s like reading a book that only gets better with the turn of each page.\n\n2. Arcade Fire The Suburbs\n\nThey have created a modern-day soundtrack about growing up in Suburbia. With its tales of suburban woes and change, the suburbs never sounded so enticing.\n\n3. Sade Soldier Of Love\n\nIt’s hard to believe that 10 years have passed since Lovers Rock. She is one of those rare artists who can disappear and come back sounding fresh and new, with few changes. Timelessness never sounded so good.\n\n4. Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers Mojo\n\nTom Petty found his mojo in the blues. He used every trick in his rock-n-roll bag and used them to his advantage.\n\n5. Broken Bells Broken Bells\n\nDanger Mouse + James Mercer of The Shins = melodic jams that warm the soul.\n\n6. LCD Soundsystem This Is Happening\n\nJames Murphy knows how to get the party started. This is the smartest dance record since Talking Heads “Speaking In Tongues”.\n\n7. Midlake The Courage Of Others\n\nThis album from the Texan band sounds like it could have been released in the 70s. Flowing melodies with subtle production, the songs have a classic soft rock sound that would have fit nicely on any Fleetwood Mac album released in that decade.\n\n8. The National High Violet\n\nAnother great record from this downer band...bring on the gloom and doom.\n\n9. The Black Keys Brothers\n\nMore rockin’ blues from the duo that consistently delivers. The phrase “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” comes to mind here.\n\n10. Janelle Monáe The ArchAndroid\n\nShe takes you on a futuristic, cinematic journey with her mix of R&B, jazz, and funk. By melding sounds of the past and the present, the future definitely looks bright for this young, talented musician.\n\n11. Sufjan Stevens The Age Of Adz\n\nSufjan has always embraced his experimental side, but on this release, he takes it to a new level (he even uses Auto-Tune and makes it work!). At first, I wasn’t sure what to make of it, but upon repeated listens, the melodies that were buried deep within the electronics and effects, came to life.\n\n12. Joanna Newsom Have One On Me\n\nIt seems fitting that Joanna Newsom would release a triple album for her third release. Never one to shy away from a lengthy song, it’s the harpist, pianist, and singer-songwriters most accessible release and finds her exploring new sounds.\n\n13. Jónsi Go\n\nThe first solo record from the lead singer of Sigur Rós. I have no idea what he is saying half the time, but with songs like these, who needs to.\n\n14. MGMT Congratulations\n\nThe psychedelic, pop-rock duo becomes a bit more progressive than on their debut. The title of the opening track says it all: “It’s Working”\n\n15. Cee Lo Green The Lady Killer\n\nThis album proves that “F**k You” was not the only trick that he had up his sleeve. Funky and fun.\n\n16. Beach House Teen Dream\n\nDreamy and light, this duo created quite a buzz with its quiet intensity.\n\n17. Neil Young Le Noise\n\nYoung works with producer Daniel Lanois on this one. What started out as a solo acoustic album, became much more. It’s still a solo record, but Neil creates a whole lot of noise, while Lanois creates a haunting space for the songs to float in and out of.\n\n18. Frightened Rabbit The Winter Of Mixed Drinks\n\nA Scottish indie rock band that I stumbled upon because I liked their album cover. The music did not disappoint either...they sound like a modern version of XTC.\n\n19. Peter Gabriel Scratch My Back\n\nNot your standard cover songs. Peter gives songs written by David Bowie, Bon Iver, Talking Heads, Radiohead, Regina Spektor, and Arcade Fire (to name just a few), a whole new meaning. He strips them down to gorgeous, haunting orchestral versions that are all his own.\n\n20. Eels End Times\n\nThese songs of heartache and misery could not be more effectively conveyed. A classic break-up album.\n\n1. Regina Spektor Far\n\nWhat started out as a great soundtrack to the summer became much more as the year progressed. The catchy melodies, her soaring vocals, the spot-on production, will all stay with you. Always one to embrace her quirky side, Regina continues to push the boundaries while still staying true to herself.\n\n2. Tori Amos Midwinter Graces\n\nFor those that don’t know, I am a big fan of holiday music. I am also a big fan of Tori Amos and this combination creates some real holiday magic. This is not your typical rendering of seasonal songs. In her own unique way, she takes on the traditional holiday songs (along with a few originals), melding them into one another, and making them her own. At times, you forget you’re listening to holiday music as these gorgeous arrangements captivate you, making this one of Tori’s best albums in a long time and one that you can enjoy all winter long.\n\n3. Built To Spill There Is No Enemy\n\nFor many, this album flew way under the radar. While it didn’t seem all that special at first, that changed on repeated listens. For a band that has been making music for the past 16 years, they kept the focus where it’s always been: Melodies and guitars.\n\n4. Grizzly Bear Veckatimest\n\nThis Brooklyn-based band hit their stride in 09 mixing the lush, floating, psychedelic sounds of the Beach Boys with melodies and harmonies reminiscent of CSN. Strangely beautiful but weirdly accessible.\n\n5. Bat For Lashes Two Suns\n\nHaunting, sparse, ethereal, and danceable? This record has it all and it goes together beautifully.\n\n6. Yeah Yeah Yeahs It’s Blitz!\n\nI normally wouldn’t consider myself a big fan, however, they mix things up on their third release with Karen O channeling her inner Terri Nunn (à la Berlin). The songs would be at home on the dance floor, a rock club, or a tv series. Lots of range from a band showing some maturity.\n\n7. Phoenix Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix\n\nThere was so much hype with this band that I almost didn’t give them a chance. I’m certainly glad that I did. While it didn’t grab me right away, when it did, it didn’t let go. Believe the hype.\n\n8. Fanfarlo Reservoir\n\nYes, this London-based indie-pop band sounds like a mix of Arcade Fire and Beirut, but there’s nothing wrong with that. A strong debut from a band that I’m sure we’ll be hearing a lot more from in the years to come.\n\n9. The Bird & The Bee Ray Guns Are Not The Future\n\nThis album has an underlying retro vibe with modern beats layered over it. They cover all genres here including pop, dance, and even ragtime. Is there nothing they can’t do?\n\n10. Florence & The Machine Lungs\n\nThis year’s critics’ darling delivered. Florence Welch leads a soul-inspired indie rock band that provides the perfect accompaniment to her bluesy vocal style.\n\n11. The Avett Brothers I And Love And You\n\nProduced by Rick Rubin, this album features piano-based songs that have both heart and substance.\n\n12. Wilco Wilco (The Album)\n\nAnother great record from a great band. While it’s not quite the perfection they reached on “Sky Blue Sky,” this album is a testament to their craft. Like a fine wine, they continue to get better with age.\n\n13. Miike Snow Miike Snow\n\nThis is the album fellow Swedes Peter, Bjorn & John wished they had made. Full of fun, upbeat melodies, this one just makes you smile.\n\n14. Animal Collective Merriweather Post Pavilion\n\nIt took me a while to get into this album... a good thing it came out in January. There is a lot of space on this record and often times I would get lost, but ultimately, the music would draw me back in. Not always an easy listen, but one that is definitely worth the effort.\n\n15. Imogen Heap Ellipse\n\nFollowing up on her stellar album “Speak For Yourself” would seem like no easy task. However, she exceeds expectations, sticking to the same formula of layering vocals, beats, and samples, and it works, yet again.\n\n16. Rocco DeLuca & The Burden Mercy\n\nChanneling his inner Jeff Buckley, Rocco uses his impressive voice to explore some real range throughout his songs. The result is captivating.\n\n17. Andrew Bird Noble Beast\n\nOn his fifth solo album, the multi-instrumentalist and whistling fool crafts songs that are both subdued and affecting. Subtlety at its finest.\n\n18. Julian Casablancas Phrazes For The Young\n\nOn his solo debut, the lead singer for the Strokes finds himself sounding like an 80s throwback. There are traces of New Order, A Flock Of Seagulls, and even Cyndi Lauper. But don’t despair, he makes the synthesizer work in his favor.\n\n19. Dirty Projectors Bitte Orca\n\nThis is one of those records that is really hard to describe. At times experimental, folky, and funky. Don’t waste time trying to categorize it, just listen and let the music do the talking.\n\n20. Dan Auerbach Keep It Hid\n\nOn his solo debut, Auerbach (one half of The Black Keys), doesn’t stray far from the blues-rock music the band is known for. However, songs like “When The Night Comes” show some real tender moments that you don’t get from the duo. Sometimes less is more.\n\n1. TV On The Radio Dear Science\n\nThe music grabs you on the opening track and doesn’t let up, as the songs flow nicely into each other. Each one has a distinct sound, that while listening to the album you tend to ask yourself, “Is this the same band?” Diversity at it’s finest.\n\n2. The Black Keys Attack & Release\n\nOn their sixth release, the duo gets some help from Danger Mouse who spices things up but leaves their original sound intact. The loops and beats only add to their style of the blues that they’re playing.\n\n3. Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds Dig, Lazurus, Dig!!!\n\nBack and better than ever, this album sounds like classic Nick Cave. It combines all the elements that you’d come to expect: Religious overtones, dramatic arrangements, and a wide range of melodies that only they can deliver.\n\n4. David Byrne & Brian Eno Everything That Happens Will Happen Today\n\nReunited and it feels so good. This album combines the musical genius of two true artists with surprisingly mainstream effects, that still seem a little offbeat.\n\n5. Goldfrapp Seventh Tree\n\nWhile much more mellow than previous efforts, this British duo has gotten in touch with their softer side and the results are gorgeous.\n\n6. Vampire Weekend Vampire Weekend\n\nThe little band that could. Amidst all the hype these Brooklyn boys delivered. Fun, catchy, and hard to resist.\n\n7. Gary Louris Vagabonds\n\nThe ex-Jayhawk goes solo for the first time in his career. He doesn’t stray far from the formula that made that band so great: His melodic voice singing over roots-rock music is just another step in the right direction.\n\n8. P!nk Funhouse\n\nI always love a great break-up song and this one is chock full of them. Pink covers a lot of territory on this album delving into pop, rock, blues, and ballads. The common denominator that brings them all together is her raspy voice perfectly suited to deliver the biting lyrics.\n\n9. Beck Modern Guilt\n\nAn excellent collaboration with Danger Mouse who co-produced the album with Beck. This album clocks in at just over 33 minutes, but while it’s short, it’s also sweet.\n\n10. Ray Lamontagne Gossip In The Grain\n\nOn his third release, Ray is trying his best to be a little more upbeat. While this is a welcome change, the songs that stand out the most as still the quieter ones.\n\n11. Fleet Foxes Fleet Foxes\n\nTaking cues from Crosby, Stills & Nash, The Shins, and My Morning Jacket, these guys seem to borrow from all the right sources. The album is filled with haunting three-part harmonies with dramatic effect.\n\n12. Kings Of Leon Only By The Night\n\nThese guys seem to be taking lessons from Radiohead...exploring their experimental side but still managing to rock.\n\n13. Aimee Mann @#%&*! Smilers\n\nWhile I wasn’t crazy about her last release, this one includes some great songs which evoke the songs from the Magnolia soundtrack. A nice return to form.\n\n14. MGMT Oracular Spectacular\n\nThis Brooklyn duo captured a lot on their first release: Some funk-filled psychedelic experimentation.\n\n15. Sigur Rós Med Sud I Eyrum Vid Spilum Endalaust\n\nThe Icelandic lads further their signature sound by mixing things up a bit by adding horns and singing one of the songs in English.\n\n16. Al Green Lay It Down & The Raconteurs Consolers Of The Lonely (Tie)\n\nFrom the start of this record, it sounds like you’re listening to classic Al Green circa 1971. A fine album that brings you back to a much simpler time. Jack White & the boys offer some good old rock and roll, but with enough of a twist to make it sound fresh.\n\n17. Okkervil River The Stand Ins\n\nThis was a year full of indie boy bands. While I sometimes had trouble keeping them all straight, these guys stood out by simply delivering a solid album...that and Will Sheff’s distinct vocals.\n\n18. Pale Young Gentlemen Black Forest (Tra la La)\n\nThis band from Madison, WI sounds like they could be from another place and time. Combining instruments like the glockenspiel, flute, French horn, and harp with more traditional instruments like guitar, bass, drums, cello, and violin, they make a unique sound all their own.\n\n19. Madonna Hard Candy\n\nWhile not her best, the Queen of Pop offers up a solid set of songs that will get your booty shaking on the dance floor.\n\n20. Nada Surf Lucky & Wolf Parade At Mount Zoomer (Tie)\n\nNada Surf is a band that I’ve heard of for years but never managed to really listen to. This album changed all that. The combination of rock with a pop flair made for some catchy tunes. Wolf Parade, on the other hand, is a little more difficult to pinpoint. They may sound like several different bands from track to track, yet still, maintain a cohesive sound.\n\n1. Amy Winehouse Back To Black\n\nIf you take away all the tabloid stories and shenanigans and just focus on the music and the lyrics, you’ll hear something pretty special. With her confessional lyrics and songs that bring you back to old Motown, Winehouse has taken something old and created something new with the help of producers Mark Ronson and Salaam Remi. Chock-full of heartache and soul.\n\n2. Arcade Fire Neon Bible\n\nNo sophomore slump here! Pipe organs, big arrangements, lyrics with a bite.\n\nThese Canadians made an excellent soundtrack for the state of the world. The best album that Bruce Springsteen didn’t make this year.\n\n3. Feist The Reminder\n\nOn first listen, I thought this was a bit scattered and wasn’t sure how I felt about it. However, with one good listen, that all changed. This album has a little bit of everything. Sometimes the records I don’t care for much at first are usually the ones I end up liking the best, and this one definitely fits into that category.\n\n4. Bruce Springsteen Magic\n\nClassic Bruce for the modern-day. A lot of the album sounds similar to his old stuff but he still manages to make it sound relevant. The songs may be catchy but don’t let those melodies fool you...he is dealing with some bleak subject matters here.\n\n5. The Shins Wincing The Night Away\n\nThe album is full of catchy songs reminiscent of The Smiths and The Beach Boys. This record holds up so well from song to song, that by the time it’s over, you just want to play it again.\n\n6. Wilco Sky Sky Blue Sky\n\nWho knew Jeff Tweedy and the band would be making such great music after being clean and sober. If this is what sobriety sounds like, sign me up!\n\n7. PJ Harvey White Chalk\n\nA very different album for her. It consists primarily of songs on the piano and Harvey singing falsetto. It’s a beautiful, haunting album with some very dark themes.\n\n8. Radiohead In Rainbows\n\nIf you took OK Computer and mixed it with Kid A you would have In Rainbows. Both dreamy and edgy, it has all the necessary ingredients that make up a quintessential Radiohead record.\n\n9. Patty Griffin Children Running Through\n\nPatty does it all here: blues, gospel, rock, folk…and all with the same intensity. And that voice! What can’t she sing?\n\n10. Iron & Wine The Shepherd’s Dog\n\nThis is a beautiful album. At times it sounds like vintage Crosby, Stills & Nash but with enough variety to keep things interesting.\n\n11. Spoon Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga\n\nThese guys are good at making the same type of music, but somehow making it different. This is more of the same and I mean that in a good way.\n\n12. Kristin Mooney Hydroplane\n\nThe only truly independent artist on the list. Kristin has been making music for years but this one is her best. Blurring the lines of country, folk, and rock and using them as her backdrop, she wraps her sultry vocals around each arrangement. It also contains the best cover this year, “I Say A Little Prayer For You”, which she completely reinvents and makes her own.\n\n13. Blonde Redhead 23\n\nThis band has been around for a while but I am fairly new to them. I saw them open for Interpol a few years ago and became a big fan fast. While this may be their most accessible album yet, there is still plenty of eccentricities to make this album unique.\n\n14. Band Of Horses Cease To Begin\n\nA recent purchase and as a result, I’ve only listened to this a few times. Similar to three “The” bands: The Flaming Lips, The Shins, and The Jayhawks. Who knows where it would have been on the list had I had the chance to really delve into it.\n\n15. Peter Bjorn And John Writer’s Block\n\nThese three Swedes made one fun album. It’s fairly diverse but has a very cohesive sound. “Young Folks” has all the makings of a modern rock classic.\n\n16. Eddie Vedder Into The Wild\n\nEddie goes solo for this Soundtrack to the movie of the same name. Although my two favorite tracks “Hard Sun” & “Society” are the only songs on the album that he didn’t actually write, Eddie, delivers, making them his own.\n\n17. Crowded House Time On Earth\n\nThe masters of melodies are back...and it’s a welcome return. They made a great album in the face of grief when their drummer Paul Hester committed suicide. But something beautiful came out of it as these are some of Neil Finn’s most heartfelt songs.\n\n18. Beirut The Flying Club Cup\n\nAt times this Brooklyn band sounds like a combination of Sufjan Stevens melodies with a mix of Thom Yorke and David Bryne’s vocals. The arrangements are big and the instruments varied (French horns, accordion, and organ). It all makes for one compelling sound.\n\n19. Neil Young Chrome Dreams II\n\nOn his latest, Neil shows us his softer side with the opener “Beautiful Blackbird” which easily could have been an outtake from “Harvest.” But by the third song, Neil’s in a rockin’ mood with “Ordinary People” which clocks in at eighteen plus minutes. It’s diversity like this that always works in his favor.\n\n20. (Tie) Rilo Kiley Under The Blacklight\n\nThis is a bit of a departure for them as they explore their poppier side. As you’re listening though you realize that it’s yet another break-up album. Who doesn’t like a little sugar with their bitterness?\n\n20. (Tie) Mark Knopfler Kill To Get Crimson\n\nThis is one of those subtle albums that doesn’t sound like much on the first listen. Slowly but surely the songs do reveal themselves. A more muted, yet solid effort from the former Dire Straits leader.\n\n1. Belle & Sebastian The Life Pursuit\n\nWhat can I say? I was never a huge fan and now I am totally converted! A near-perfect album.\n\n2. Regina Spector Begin To Hope\n\nA much more solid effort this time out. This one has a little bit of everything for everyone.\n\n3. Tom Waits Orphans: Brawlers, Bawlers & Bastards\n\nClassic Mr. Waits in all his personas, with disc 2 being the stand-out.\n\n4. Cat Power The Greatest\n\nThe result of the Memphis Rhythm Band backing a singer whose voice is like honey...very smooth.\n\n5. Neil Young Living With War\n\nPutting his money where his mouth is.\n\n6. Chris Garneau Music For Tourists\n\nA Brooklyn artist that I discovered by chance who sings and writes some sad but beautiful songs. A little bit of Sufjan Stevens and Elliott Smith...in other words, quirky in a good way.\n\n7. Wolfmother Wolfmother\n\nIf Led Zeppelin & Black Sabbath had a baby they would name it Wolfmother.\n\n8. Muse Black Holes & Revelations\n\nDramatic sounds and orchestration are reminiscent of Radiohead and Queen.\n\n9. Dixie Chicks Taking The Long Way\n\nCountry leftists who have traded in the country for a little rock and roll.\n\n10. Joanna Newsom Ys\n\nThis is a very unique and challenging one with the shortest song being 7:17 and the longest one clocking in at 16:53 (luckily there are only 5 songs). The production and sweeping orchestrations are gorgeous. A 24-year old harpist with a voice that’s a cross between Björk & Victoria Williams, who has many tales to tell.\n\n11. Beck The Information\n\nBeck – still growing and maturing – but not forgetting to have fun.\n\n12. Nellie McKay Pretty Little Head\n\nNot as groundbreaking as Get Away From Me, but a joy nonetheless.\n\n13. Mark Knopfler & Emmylou Harris All The Roadrunning\n\nTwo of my faves get together with brilliant results.\n\n14. Bob Dylan Modern Times\n\nModern-day classic.\n\n15. The Rapture Pieces Of The People We Love\n\n2 words: Dance Party! The Talking Heads would be proud.\n\n16. Thom Yorke The Eraser\n\nThe lead singer from Radiohead. This one grew on me...now I can’t seem to get enough.\n\n17. (Tie) KT Tunstall Eye To The Telescope\n\nOverplayed, but really, not a bad song on the album.\n\n17. (Tie) Leah Siegel Little Mule\n\nA New York artist that I recently discovered...at times she reminds me of Jeff Buckley, Fiona Apple, and PJ Harvey...all good things!\n\n18. Sonic Youth Rather Ripped\n\nReturn to form...melodies intact.\n\n19. Michael Franti & Spearhead Yell Fire!\n\nAnthem after anthem of uplifting messages for these troubled times.\n\n20. Gomez How We Operate\n\nTheir most straight forward record yet...and that’s not a bad thing."
