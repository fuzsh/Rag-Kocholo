        "text": "At an elevation of 6,400 feet, Sunrise is the highest point that can be reached by vehicle at Mount Rainier National Park. In summer, mountain meadows abound with wildflowers. On clear summer days, Sunrise provides breathtaking views of Mount Rainier and Emmons Glacier. Sunrise Point offers nearly 360-degree views of the surrounding valleys, Mount Rainier, and other volcanoes in the Cascade Range such as Mount Adams. These views and an excellent trail system make Sunrise the second most visited location in the park. Sunrise is located 60 miles northeast of the Nisqually Entrance and 14 miles northwest of the Sunrise/White River turnoff on State Route 410. The article, White River and Sunrise: The Captivating Northeast Corner of Mount Rainier National Park, provides an overview of the history of the area.\n\nThe Sunrise Road usually opens in late June or early July and closes in late September to early October. Check the road status before setting out.\n\nYou might also consider visiting other areas of the park like the Carbon River-Mowich Lake area, Ohanapecosh, Longmire, and Paradise.\n\nServices\n\nSee Operating Hours and Seasons for current information about these facilities.\n\nThe Sunrise Visitor Center is open from early July to early September and closed in winter.

NOTE: From July 4 - September 2, 2024, timed entry reservations are required to enter the Sunrise Corridor between 7:00 am and 3:00 pm, which includes White River Campground. Once you get a White River Campground first-come, first-served (FCFS) permit, it can be used instead of a timed entry reservation to enter the Sunrise Corridor anytime during the remainder of your stay. FCFS permits can be acquired before 7 am or you may need a Sunrise Corridor Timed Entry Permit if you want to try to acquire a FCFS between 7 am and 3 pm. There is no guarantee that a FCFS permit will be available even if you get a timed entry permit. White River Campground permits provide access to the Sunrise Corridor only; they do not provide access to the Paradise Corridor.\n\nRoadside Attractions\n\nTipsoo Lake - Located at Chinook Pass, this subalpine lake is set in a glacier-carved basin amid spectacular wildflower meadows.\n\nWhite River Patrol Cabin - Located in White River Campground Loop C, this historic patrol cabin was built in the late 1920s and is part of a series of patrol cabins linked by trails that helped the early rangers protect the park.\n\nColumnar Lava - On the drive from White River Campground to Sunrise Point, watch the left-hand road banks for andesite columns that formed from an ancient Mount Rainier lava flow.\n\nSunrise Point - Sweeping views of the Cascade Range to the east, Sunrise Lake to the north, and Mount Rainier to the southwest.\n\nSunrise - The fortress and blockade style structures of the Sunrise Visitor Center as well as the rustic Sunrise Day Lodge are part of the National Historic Landmark District.
