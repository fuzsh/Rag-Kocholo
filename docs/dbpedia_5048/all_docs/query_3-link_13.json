        "text": "Do you know that the reasoning for these distinctions are historical? Back in the day, British horseback riders used to ride on the left hand side of the road, so they can keep their right arm free to offer greetings to passersby or, if it is necessary, draw their sword. On the other hand, USA teamsters used to sit on the left hand horse while driving a wagon so they can keep their right hand free for whipping the other horses. They settled to begin driving on the right in order to avoid collisions and to notice the passing wheels of other vehicles.\n\nHere is an overview of left-side driving countries per continent:\n\nIn Oceania: Australia and dependencies, Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, New Zealand, Nauru, Niue, Norfolk Island, Papua New Guinea, Pitcairn Islands, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu.\n\nIn Europe: Great Britain and dependencies (Channel Islands, Isle of Man), Cyprus, Ireland, Malta.\n\nAfrica: Botswana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. (off Africa: ) Mauritius, Saint Helena, Seychelles.\n\nAsia: Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, East Timor, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand.\n\nIn the Carribbean: Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Cayman Islands, Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, Montserrat, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Caicos Islands, British Virgin Island, US Virgin Islands.\n\nOn mainland America: Guyana and Suriname. (off mainland America: ) Bermuda, Falkland Islands.\n\nPlease note that about one-third of the worldâ€™s countries require citizens to drive on the left side of the road, while the rest follow right-hand traffic rules."
