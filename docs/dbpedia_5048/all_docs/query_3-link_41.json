        "text": "Some rural mail carriers use right-hand drive vehicles to deliver mail in rural Minnesota. Do they have a special license for that? Are there special exceptions, or can anyone do it?\n\nThat's what I was wondering yesterday. A friend of a friend is a rural mail carrier for the US Post Office and has a jeep with the steering wheel on the right. It's kinda trippy to see! The interesting thing is that it's also his daily driving car, so he's always on the right-hand side wherever he goes.\n\nIs it legal to drive a right-hand drive car in Minnesota?\n\nIs that even legal in Minnesota? Where do you even find one?\n\nThe short answer is, yes it's totally legal. As long as the car is street-legal and meets all the requirements, it doesn't matter what side of the car your steering wheel is on.\n\nRead More: Is It Legal To Drive Naked In Minnesota?\n\nHow do you get a right-hand drive vehicle?\n\nI don't really know why you would want one unless you deliver mail. But, for some reason, if you do want to get one, it's not that hard to buy them. Ebay Motors has them for sale. Import car dealerships often will have them as well (as many countries overseas are right-hand drive.)\n\nWhy do some countries drive on the left side of the road?\n\nIn the US, we drive on the right side of the road. But overseas, like in Europe, they drive on the left side of the road. Why do they do this?\n\nIt goes back to ancient Rome. When they would be traveling on roads with their horses or chariots, they wanted their right hand free for a weapon. So they would steer the horses with their left hand to keep their right hand free. This stuck through the years. Interesting, huh?"
