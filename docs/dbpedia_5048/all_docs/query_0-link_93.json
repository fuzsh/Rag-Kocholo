        "text": "Left-hand traffic: easier than thought\n\nThe left-hand traffic in some travel countries is even a reason for some to choose another holiday destination.\n\nWith that said, it’s not hard at all to master driving on the other side of the road.\n\nWe have put together some tips for you below.\n\nRight side steering wheel\n\nEven in countries with left-hand traffic, it is advisable to arrive by train or plane and to take the hire car only on the spot. Then the vehicle is built for left-hand traffic, which makes the journey much easier.\n\nThe steering wheel is not on the left side, as it is here, but on the right side.\n\nThis also means that the middle lane of the road is on the driver’s side as usual, making it easier for the driver to find his way around.\n\nWhen the steering wheel is on the left, it is common to drive too far to the left. The driver is worried about crossing the median with the vehicle and colliding with oncoming traffic.\n\nNo fear of the pedals\n\nEven if the steering wheel is on the “wrong” side, everything remains the same in the foot area. On the far right is the accelerator pedal, to the left of that is the brake, and then the clutch pedal follows in manual cars. So it’s not all unfamiliar.\n\nSelect automatic car\n\nIf the steering wheel is on the right side, it automatically means that the gearshift must be to the left of the driver.\n\nEspecially in the early days, the hire car customer who has rented a vehicle with a conventional gearshift will keep reaching into the void to the right to engage a gear.\n\nSave yourself this stress and rent an automatic vehicle. Then all you have to do is move the selector lever to “D” for “Drive” and you can cruise away relaxed.\n\nOur tips for handling an automatic vehicle can be found here.\n\nPractice first\n\nEven though the trip is supposed to be to London, it is still advisable to head for a quiet country road first after picking up the car at the airport.\n\nThere you can practise in peace and quiet and adjust to the unfamiliar driving situation.\n\nAnd then, once they are used to the vehicle and left-hand traffic, you will be able to cope in the city.\n\nEyes on the roundabout\n\nThe roundabout is one of the highest hurdles for the inexperienced tourist. This is because people not only drive on the left side, they also drive on the left side of the roundabout. Drivers who want to merge into the roundabout have to wait until it is clear. Because on the roundabout, it’s right before left.\n\nThe left lane is reserved for motorists who want to leave the roundabout at the next exit. In the middle sort themselves out the road users who have to leave soon, but not immediately and on the far right drive those who still have a little time.\n\nCaution when turning\n\nAnother problem many drivers have when turning right. Here, special thought should always be given to left-hand traffic.\n\nBecause otherwise they end up quite quickly on the right side of the lane.\n\nBut if you are traveling with a local hire car, the danger is much less."
