        "text": "Since its invention, the wheel has been at the forefront of technological advances, nowadays many being at the front of the wheel. With the growing ownership of cars, driving has become an integral part of our society. Getting one’s licence is considered a rite of passage into adulthood, buying a car acts as a mark of success. Naturally, our dependency on cars means that they need to be carefully regulated as more and more are put on the road. Issues ranging from safety features to traffic protocols are all now covered by motor laws, many of which are universal, such as the expectation to use one’s seatbelt. Yet, something as simple as which side of the road you drive on varies from country to country. This begs the question, if we can mainly agree on international motor guidelines, why is the issue of which side to drive on disputed? In fact, driving on one side of the road is even enshrined in the Geneva Convention on Road Traffic (1949) (1), so you’d think that they would have had the sense to just decide which one?\n\nThis question came to me on a recent family holiday to Spain where I was constantly dreading Dad’s turn to drive. I, myself, hate driving. My driving experience only consists of one week’s intensive course in the hopes of passing my test first time, (I didn’t of course, I failed miserably) and that was enough to put me off for life. In Spain, Dad was just unable to fake the confidence my Mum was. Seeing my Dad drive on the opposite side of the road reminded me of myself driving normally. He seemed on edge, as if waiting for an accident to happen. His unease was contagious and as passenger I was uncomfortable, paying careful attention to the road. It felt so wrong, like I was having to constantly fight my instinct to yank the wheel over to the left. For me, manoeuvring a roundabout in its own right is terrifying, having to do that in the other direction would probably give me a heart attack from the stress.\n\nIt was this that made me ask why the whole world just doesn’t all drive on the same side? Right-Hand Traffic (RHT) is used in 165 countries and territories. In comparison, Left-Hand Traffic (LHT) in countries which account for about a sixth of the world's area with about 35% of its population and a quarter of its roads (2).The more I thought about it, the more it didn’t make sense to me. Surely modern laws were based upon the precedent and conventions already in place, those which had evolved overtime and complimented the vehicle design of the time? In that case, why did America, Canada and other ex-colonial countries not adhere to Britain’s left-hand driving? Would the British have enforced this when occupying? In 1919, the number of LHT and RHT countries were equal, at 104. However, between 1919 and 1986, 34 territories converted from LHT to RHT (3).Was it possible that these countries changed their driving sides just to spite Britain? Were we really that bad? (Short answer: probably). Anyways, it got me thinking and the more I pondered, the more I wanted to find out. So, here you go; a quick history behind driving in the left- or right-hand lane.\n\nSome historicists claim that in feudal Britain, it was custom to travel on the left due to the hierarchical, potentially violent nature of the society. As the majority of people were right-handed, it was natural for knights to ride on the left to ensure their right hand (their sword-wielding hand) was closest to an oncoming enemy, with their scabbard out of the way on the left. Even though the majority of passing interactions were to greet one another, it still made sense to travel on the left, as to shake hands and avoid scabbards you would approach from the left. Similar theories draw on this to argue that people who wore their swords on the left started the tradition of mounting the horse from its left side, so not to be hampered by their scabbard (4). Others argue that it is simply easier and more natural for one to mount from the left, and therefore would use the stone walls as a step up when mounting on the side of the road, it being safer than mounting in the middle of the road (5). Additionally, it was not only logical for the aristocracy to ride on the left. Those leading a wagon with horses would often hold the reins in their right hand and walk along the edge of the road, so to avoid the worst of the mud (6). However, there is archaeological proof that LHT was adopted as the convention through the conquering of various empires, the Roman, Ancient Greek and Egyptian empire enforcing that their troops marched on the left (7). Naturally, this norm was adopted by the occupied countries, evidenced by a well- preserved track to a Roman quarry found in 1998 near Swindon. The cart-tracks on the left-hand (driving away from the quarry) were far deeper than those on the right, suggesting that they used LHT on the assumption that the wagons would be loaded at the quarry after entering it empty (8). This culminated in an officially sanctioned declaration by Pope Boniface VIII in 1300 AD, stating that all pilgrims travelling to Rome should keep to the left (9). LHT was introduced to the law in Britain by the General Highways Act in 1773, which was later mandated by the Highway Act of 1835 (10). As it was law in Britain, LHT was consequently enforced throughout the globe via the British Empire. However which way LHT came about, whether from the Roman Empire or because it suited the use of swords, it is apparent that to LHT was the more logical option for the time.\n\nNevertheless, LHT started to become illogical to some and hence there started a gradual transition between the two lanes. The transition stemmed from the rising popularity of wagons for transportation. With growing interconnectedness of Colonial America, goods were being transported further distances in larger quantities than every before. Freight wagons became popular for this reason, which were drawn by roughly half-a-dozen horses. In order to control the horses, the driver would ride the back-left horse to keep his whip hand free. However, sitting on the left meant that it was difficult to judge the oncoming traffic, so most farmers started to pass on the right. Thus, when traffic passed on narrow roads, drivers would have a clearer view of their axels and avoid collisions or sideswipes (11). Unlike in the US, there was less of a need for these massive wagons in England as these enormous vehicles were more suited to the wide expanses of terrain and distances that were necessary in Canada and the US. Eventually, Pennsylvania passed the first-keep-to-the-right law in 1792, other states being quick to follow with New York formalising RHT in 1804, New Jersey in 1813 and Massachusetts in 1821 (13). Shortly after Pennsylvania’s traffic legislation, there was a similar French decree to keep to the “common” right. Many consider it as a symbol of the consequences of the French Revolution of 1789. It was considered to be revolutionary to ride on the right as the left-side had been reserved for the aristocrats, forcing the peasants to the right, therefore, to make the right-hand the superior lane was ‘revolutionary’ (15). A consequence of this attitude, the fall of the Bastille, was that the gentry would travel on the right in an effort to be less conspicuous. Eventually all of France journeyed on the same side of the road and so in 1794 it became law (16). Napoleon later enforced this rule throughout all French territories, some say because he himself was left handed (17).\n\nLike Napoleon, the British enforced their traffic restrictions across its colonies. Many former colonies have kept LHT, most notably ones that are islands: Australia, Fiji, Tonga, Solomon Islands, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea for example. It seems that the deciding patterns that determine which side of the road your nation drives on is whether you are an island or the traffic that surrounds you. For example, of the US states, the United States Virgin Islands is the only LHT state because it is surrounded by LHT neighbouring islands (18).Countries surrounded by opposite lane drivers often choose to convert because when borders between countries of opposite lanes were crossed, traffic laws and violations would be confusing and complicated. All Asian ex-colonies are still LHT (such as India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore) because the majority of their borders face onto LHT countries. Afghanistan was LHT until the 1950s and Myanmar switched to RHT in 1970 because they only share one border with an LHT country. Left-hand driving was instituted throughout British West Africa. Nevertheless, as the majority had borders with former French RHT colonies, countries such as Ghana, Sierra Leone and Nigeria have switched to RHT since liberation.\n\nThe move from LHT to RHT was also motivated by the growth of the car, unveiled by Henry Ford in 1908 with the driver’s seat very deliberately being on the left. National Geographic maintains that this prompted many countries to change included Canada, Italy and Spain in the 1920s and later most of Eastern Europe (19). This climate of change built and built to the point that in the 1960s, the UK’s Department for Transport to consider the implications of Britain switching to RHT. However, they deemed it too expensive and dangerous to drivers for our developed nation designed for LHT as it would require an entire re-evaluation and re-construction of road standards and their current condition (20). Samoa is one of the few countries to convert from RHT to LHT and was the first territory to transition in almost 30 years, fairly recently in 2009. The government mandated it because it argued that right-hand driving cars were cheaper, imported from nearby Australia, New Zealand or Japan.\n\nSo, this is what my curiosity about such a mundane subject has produced. I hope you learned something. And in answer to your question of which side is better, as a right-handed person having grown in LHT Australia and currently living in LHT UK, I am slightly bias. However, after studying global accident statistics, Leeming concluded that LHT was the superior system (21), although since then Watson has dismissed his claims due to a small sample size (22). So really, it’s up to. Now you know all there is to know about the sides of the road. Glad to be of service.\n\n(1) Wikipedia.org. (2019). International Driving Permit.
