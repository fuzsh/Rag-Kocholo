Most U.S. passport holders traveling to Australia for tourism or business purposes for less than 90 days can obtain an ETA. The ETA is an electronic label-free visa and can be obtained at the ETA website for a small service fee. Airlines and many travel agents in the United States are also able to apply for ETAs on behalf of travelers.\n\nIf you overstay your ETA or any other visa, even for short periods, you may be subject to exclusion, detention, and removal by the Australian Department of Home Affairs.\n\nIf you are travelling on a valid U.S. ePassport (a passport that contains an electronic chip) and are 16 years of age or older, you are eligible to use Australia’s automated border processing system, SmartGate, upon arrival in Australia (SmartGate kiosks are available only at participating airports). There is no additional enrollment process or fee to use SmartGate. Visit the SmartGate website for more information and for a list of participating airports in Australia.\n\nVisit the Embassy of Australia website for the most current visa information.\n\nHIV/AIDS restrictions. Some HIV/AIDS entry restrictions exist for visitors and foreigners seeking permanent residence in Australia. Depending on the type of visa you apply for, the length of your stay, and your intended activities in Australia, you may be required to undergo a medical examination before the Australian Department of Home Affairs will issue you a visa.\n\nIf you are in the application process, and are found to be HIV positive, a decision on the application will be considered on the same grounds as any other pre-existing medical condition (such as tuberculosis or cancer), with the focus on the cost to Australia’s health care and community services.\n\nAdditional information about Australian immigration health requirements can be found here.\n\nPlease verify this information with the Embassy of Australia in Washington D.C. before you travel.\n\nFind information on dual nationality, prevention of international child abduction and customs regulations on our websites.\n\nCriminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, imprisoned or deported.\n\nIt is illegal to take pictures of certain buildings, such as inside certain areas of Australian airports, near prisons, and at military bases.\n\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website.\n\nAlcohol and Drugs:\n\nPenalties for possession, use, or trafficking of drugs are strict. Convicted offenders can expect lengthy sentences and fines. Please see Australia’s Department of Health webpage for further information.\n\nDriving under the influence of alcohol can result in jail time.\n\nRandom breath testing of a driver's blood alcohol level is a common occurrence.\n\nArrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information.\n\nPotential Health Screening: Australian authorities have broad powers to prevent the entry of diseases and other materials into Australia that might pose a threat to its welfare. In the event of a public health emergency involving a communicable disease, passengers arriving in Australia may be subject to strict health screening measures, including testing, monitoring, and assessment for possible quarantine.\n\nCustoms: Australian customs authorities enforce very strict regulations concerning the importation from all countries of items such as agricultural goods, including plants and food products, and wood products, as well as very strict quarantine standards for animals and pets.

From jellyfish to crocodiles, sharks, poisonous insects, and snakes, the continent and its waters host wildlife that merit awe and respect in equal doses.\n\nVisit the Wet Tropics Management Authority visitor information guide for information on Australian wildlife and marine life.\n\nTake important safety precautions when swimming, such as swimming only between the flags where a lifeguard is present, and never swimming alone.\n\nFurther information on beach safety can be found on the Surf Life Saving website.\n\nFollow recommended precautions when snorkeling and scuba diving and never dive alone.
