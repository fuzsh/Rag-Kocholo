        "text": "The 2024 Annual Bridge Walk is currently scheduled for Monday, Sept. 2, 2024. Any updates will be posted here as the event approaches.\n\nThe Mackinac Bridge will be closed to public traffic from 6:30 a.m. to noon on Monday, Sept. 2, 2024 to accommodate the 2024 Annual Bridge Walk.\n\nNo bus transportation across the bridge will be provided as part of the event. Walkers who decide to walk across the entire bridge will need to arrange their own transportation back to the end of the bridge where they started after the bridge reopens to public traffic at noon. There is limited parking space available west of the Mackinac Bridge Authority plaza area.\n\nFor those seeking alternative transportation during the event, the local Mackinac Island ferry companies offer transportation between St. Ignace, Mackinaw City, and Mackinac Island, as well as between St. Ignace and Mackinaw City. Local transportation companies also offer shuttle service between various locations.\n\nThere is no fee or registration required to participate in the walk. The walk begins at 7 a.m. You may start walking any time after the governor’s party starts the walk at approximately 7 a.m. No one will be permitted to start after 11:30 a.m., so make sure you arrive early.\n\nThe walk begins in St. Ignace at the north end of the Mackinac Bridge in the Upper Peninsula, and in Mackinaw City at the south end of the bridge in the Lower Peninsula. To participate in the walk you may:\n\n– Walk from either end of the bridge, turning around at the midpoint and returning to the city you started from, where your transportation is located. The turnaround points will move towards the ends of the bridge beginning at 10 a.m., but walkers can walk at least a portion of the bridge if you start by 11:30 a.m. Walkers must be on the side of the bridge they wish to return to before 10 a.m. or you will be turned back.\n\n– Walk from either end of the bridge and continue across to the other side. This option is most like previous bridge walks. However, since bus transportation across the bridge will not be provided, walkers who choose this option will need to arrange for their own transportation back across after the bridge reopens at noon. Walkers who do not reach the midpoint of the bridge before 10 a.m. will be turned back.\n\n– Walk from either end of the bridge, continuing across to the other side, then walking back to the end of the bridge you started from. This option will mean a 10-mile round trip for participants. If walkers in this option do not reach the midpoint of the bridge on their return trip by 10 a.m. will be turned back.\n\nWalkers will use the left-hand outside paved lane as they walk onto the bridge, regardless of which end of the bridge they start from. Walkers who turn back at the midpoint will turn right, then return using the opposite side outside paved lane. Walkers who choose to cross the entire bridge will stay in the left-hand outside paved lane all the way across.\n\nThe Michigan State Police and other official personnel will be available in the event of an emergency.\n\nPlease note, there are no restrooms on the bridge and the average length of time to walk the bridge is about two hours. Portable toilets will be available in St. Ignace and Mackinaw City.\n\nBaby strollers and wheelchairs are allowed on the bridge during the walk. Prohibited items include signs, banners, umbrellas, bicycles, roller skates, skateboards, wagons and similar types of devices. With the sole exception of working service dogs, no animals are allowed. Walkers must stay away from bridge railings. The inside lane in both directions will remain open for emergency vehicles.\n\nExcept for pre-qualified, registered participants in the Governor’s Council on Physical Fitness Run, no running or racing is permitted on the bridge. Playing tag on the bridge is not permitted and no smoking on the bridge, please. For information on the Governor’s Council on Physical Fitness Run, please go to www.michiganfitness.org or contact the Governor’s Council at 517-347-7891.\n\nYou will receive a numbered bridge walk certificate at the completion of your walk. Certificates will be distributed at both ends of the bridge. Individuals under the age of 18 should have the permission of a parent or guardian to participate in the walk. Any two or more people walking together should make plans for a meeting place in the event that they become separated during the walk.\n\nDisclaimer of liability: Before beginning the walk, all participants should carefully determine that they are physically fit and medically able to participate in the annual walk since the physical strain of the walk could lead to serious health problems. Participants should also understand that walking involves risks of injury from falls due to the surface condition of the bridge, contact with other participants, and the effects of weather including high heat and/or humidity.\n\nTHE STATE OF MICHIGAN, MACKINAC BRIDGE AUTHORITY, ST. IGNACE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, MACKINAW CITY CHAMBER OR COMMERCE, AND ALL THEIR RESPECTIVE EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, VOLUNTEERS AND SPONSORS ASSUME NO OBLIGATIONS WITH REGARD TO SUCH RISKS AND SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY ARISING FROM ANY WALKER’S PARTICIPATION IN THE ANNUAL WALK.\n\nAs in the past, persons who need reasonable accommodations due to disability may contact the Mackinac Bridge Authority by August 30, 2024 at 906-643-7600. TTY users may call the Michigan Relay Center at 800-649-3777.\n\nMackinac Bridge Rules Poster"
