Whenever any roadway has been divided into two or more clearly marked lanes for traffic, the following rules in addition to all others consistent herewith shall apply.\n\n(a) A vehicle shall be driven as nearly as practicable entirely within a single lane and shall not be moved from such lane until the driver has first ascertained that such movement can be made with safety.\n\n(b) Upon a roadway which is divided into three lanes and provides for two-way movement of traffic, a vehicle shall not be driven in the center lane except when overtaking and passing another vehicle traveling in the same direction when such center lane is clear of traffic within a safe distance, or in preparation for making a left turn or where such center lane is at the time allocated exclusively to traffic moving in the same direction that the vehicle is proceeding and such allocation is designated by official traffic-control devices.\n\n(c) Upon a highway located outside the corporate limits of any city divided into two lanes of traffic proceeding in the same direction, all vehicles shall be driven in the right lane except when:\n\n(1) Overtaking and passing another vehicle;\n\n(2) preparing to make a proper left turn;\n\n(3) otherwise directed by official traffic-control devices; or\n\n(4) otherwise required by other provisions of law.\n\n(d) Upon a highway located outside the corporate limits of any city divided into three or more lanes of traffic proceeding in the same direction, vehicles shall not be driven in the far left lane except when:\n\n(1) Overtaking and passing another vehicle;\n\n(2) preparing to make a proper left turn;\n\n(3) otherwise directed by official traffic-control devices; or\n\n(4) otherwise required by other provisions of law.\n\n(e) The provisions of subsections (c) and (d) shall not apply to authorized emergency vehicles, law enforcement vehicles, Kansas turnpike authority vehicles or department of transportation vehicles performing construction or maintenance work.\n\n(f) Official traffic-control devices may be erected directing specified traffic to use a designated lane or designating those lanes to be used by traffic moving in a particular direction regardless of the center of the roadway and drivers of vehicles shall obey the directions of every such device.\n\n(g) Official traffic-control devices may be installed prohibiting the changing of lanes on sections of roadway and drivers of vehicles shall obey the directions of every such device.\n\n(h) From and after July 1, 2009, and prior to July 1, 2010, a law enforcement officer shall issue a warning citation to anyone violating the provisions of subsection (c) or (d)."
