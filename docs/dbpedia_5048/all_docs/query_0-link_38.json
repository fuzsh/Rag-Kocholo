When such devices are in place and clearly visible to an ordinarily observant person, every driver of a vehicle shall obey the directions thereof.\n\n2. Except as otherwise provided in subsections 3 and 4, a driver shall not drive on the left side of the highway within such zone or drive across or on the left side of any pavement striping designed to mark such zone throughout its length.\n\n3. A driver may drive across a pavement striping marking such zone to an adjoining highway if the driver has first given the appropriate turn signal and there will be no impediment to oncoming or following traffic.\n\n4. Except where otherwise provided, a driver may drive across a pavement striping marking such a zone to make a left-hand turn if the driver has first given the appropriate turn signal in compliance with NRS 484B.413, if it is safe and if it would not be an impediment to oncoming or following traffic.\n\n5.

After having stopped or, in the event of a yield sign, slowed or stopped, the driver shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles which have entered the intersection from such through highway or which are approaching so closely on such through highway as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time such driver is moving across or within the intersection.\n\n2. The driver of a vehicle shall stop in obedience to a stop sign or yield in compliance with a yield sign, in compliance with the manner prescribed in subsection 1, prior to entering an intersection if a stop sign or a yield sign is erected at one or more entrances thereto although not a part of a through highway and shall proceed cautiously, yielding to vehicles not so obligated to stop or yield and which are within the intersection or approaching so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time such driver is moving across or within the intersection.\n\n(Added to NRS by 1969, 1496; A 1973, 1326)—(Substituted in revision for NRS 484.319)\n\nNRS 484B.260 Vehicle entering highway from private way.
