        "text": "Each country specifies a uniform road traffic flow, either left-hand traffic (LHT) in which traffic keeps to the left side of the road, or right-hand traffic (RHT) in which traffic keeps to the right. There are some countries with RHT and mostly RHD vehicles. Japanese automobile makers produce both RHD and LHD as many Japanese used cars are exported to almost all countries across the world. As per customer’s request, Japanese used car exporters arrange to convert RHD to LHD or vice-versa.\n\nVehicles are manufactured in left-hand drive (LHD) and right-hand drive (RHD) configuration, referring to the placement of the driving seat and controls within the vehicle. It just the change in driver seat position, paddles set-ups and the gear set-up that makes left hand drive and right hand drive vehicles different.\n\nInitially most traffic drove on the left side of the road. The first vehicle ever built was designed to be driven on the left-hand side of the road. But today majority of traffic in the world drives on the right-hand side of the road. Around 66% of the world’s nations are right hand traffic countries and 34% are left-hand traffic countries.\n\nIn left hand drive car the pedals set-up as gas & brake are to your right foot and the clutch is to your left foot. The gears are to your right. One uses right hand to change gears. The 1st is towards the upper left, second is down, third is up and to the right etc. For reverse one need to push the lever far away and then forward. In left-hand traffic, the predominantly better-performing right eye is used to monitor oncoming traffic and the driver’s wing mirror. Some right hand drivers find this a bit hard when they try to drive a Left hand drive car.\n\nSome instructions for Left hand drive traffic:\n\nAll traffic is generally required to keep left unless overtaking.\n\nOncoming traffic is seen coming from the right. Right-turning traffic must cross.\n\nOncoming traffic:\n\nMost traffic signs facing motorists are on the left side of the road.\n\nA left turn at a red light may be allowed after stopping. Traffic on roundabouts.\n\nGoes clockwise:\n\nPedestrians crossing a two-way road look first for traffic from their right.\n\nOn roads without a footpath pedestrians may be advised to walk on the right.\n\nThe lane designated for normal driving and turning left is on the left.\n\nMost dual carriageway (divided highway) exits are on the left.\n\nList of LHD Countries:\n\nAustralia, Barbados, Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Bhutan, Nepal, Guyana, Suriname South Africa and Trinidad & Tobago.\n\nIn Right hand drive car the pedals set-up as gas & brake are to your left foot and the clutch is to your right foot. The gears are to your left. One uses left hand to change gears. The 1st is towards the upper left, second is down, third is up and to the right, etc. For reverse one need to pull the lever closer and then backward. In right-hand traffic, oncoming traffic and the driver’s wing mirror are handled by the predominantly weaker left eye.\n\nSome instructions for Right hand drive traffic:\n\nAll traffic is required to keep right unless overtaking.\n\nOncoming traffic is seen coming from the left. Left-turning traffic must cross.\n\noncoming traffic:\n\nMost traffic signs facing drivers/motorists are on the right side of the road.\n\nA right turn at a red light may be allowed after stopping.\n\nTraffic on roundabouts goes anticlockwise.\n\nPedestrians crossing a two-way road look first for traffic from their left.\n\nOn roads without a footpath pedestrians may be advised to walk on the left.\n\nThe lane designated for normal driving and turning right is on the right.\n\nMost dual carriageway (divided highway) exits are on the right.\n\nList of RHD Countries:\n\nKenya, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Afghanistan, Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, China, Denmark, Egypt, Germany, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Italy, Mongolia, Peru, Saudi Arabia, United States, Vietnam, Switzerland, Burma, South Korea, France."
