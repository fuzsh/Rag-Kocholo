        "text": "Left-side or left-hand traffic may seem backwards for most U.S. drivers, but it's nothing new; in the 17th and 18th centuries, it helped control the flow of horse-drawn carriages on London Bridge. These laws set the trend for many of the world's countries that drive on the left side of the road.\n\nMost countries drive on the right side of the road, which makes sense since most people are right-handed. Many of the lefty-accommodating countries are former British colonies before that have since won their independence. Before renting a car abroad, it always helps to check the driving standards for your destination.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRight-hand traffic actually predates the British Empire by several centuries. Historical findings have proven that this method dates back to Roman times when wagon drivers organized their own traffic system for economic reasons.\n\nWhen driving abroad, you'll notice that most countries with left-hand vehicles will place the steering wheels on the right side. This driver's seat placement is necessary for a left-hand drive car (LHD car) because it allows drivers to react better to oncoming traffic and see important road signs and speed limits.\n\nTravelers from right-hand-traffic (RHT) countries may find it challenging to adapt to the inverse nature of LHD cars and speed limit signs posted in km/h instead of mph in a European country. However, with some practice (and hopefully some patience from other drivers), switching sides will become easier during your road trip.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother important difference between right-hand drive (RHD cars) and left-hand drive vehicles is that several pairs of wipers are designed to move moisture from right to left instead of left to right. This operation allows vehicles driving on the left side of the road to shed moisture away from the driver's side.\n\nMany newer wipers use hand-free sensors to trigger movement as they detect the first few raindrops. However, if your LHD car has levers on the sides of the steering wheel, always test them before beginning your road trip as the lights and wipers may be on the opposite side (compared to your own car at home).\n\nThe following is a list of some of the left-hand traffic (LHT) countries that are also some of the most popular tourist destinations around the world.\n\nAdvertisement"
