        "text": "Is it that strange that we drive on the left in different countries? Driving on the left is a practice that originated in some countries – specifically, in countries that are bordered by water on one side and a government that predominately uses the right-hand drive. Most people get used to driving on the right side of the road without even thinking about it. But if you’ve ever been in a car on the opposite side of the road from what you’re used to, you may have noticed that it can be a little disorienting at first. It’s only natural to wonder why some countries drive on the right side of the road and others on the left? Let’s find out!\n\nHow Did it All Start?\n\nIn the beginning, societies established standard rules and customs that helped organize their way of life. Sometimes, a few simple guidelines are inadequate, and ceremonial laws are required. For example, people need a strict set of traffic rules to move in large groups from one place to another.\n\nThe Origin\n\nSince the beginning of history, human beings have traveled overland. Whenever they crossed a body of water, they had to figure out how to get their wagons, carriages, and sleighs to their destination. According to several texts, perhaps the first mention of right-hand traffic can be found in an ancient codex written by Aetius Amidenus and may be dated back to 700 AD. But, these rules weren’t stringent till 1555, when French King Henry II declared that any driver on the road should travel on the right.\n\nA Bit of History!\n\nOver 60 countries drive on the left and some on the right. This comes down to history and politics, which would have been safer. Initially, most significant countries set up to drive on one side of the road or another for practical purposes, not for any political or religious reason. The first influential countries to start driving on the left side of the road were Great Britain and Sweden and some of their colonies. These countries went on the left-hand side because their formation had close ties to horse-drawn carriages, where drivers sat on the left-hand side next to the horse’s harnesses. It was believed to be safer than sitting on the right-hand side, where one could be kicked by a horse or collide with wagons.\n\nReason for Which Countries Have the Left-Side Drive\n\nIn countries that drive on the left, traffic approaches from the right; this is because a person riding a horse or in an early motor vehicle would not want to be passed by someone driving on their left, as whoever was giving would have an “oncoming” traffic approach. According to one theory, it comes from the idea that your dominant hand will control the sword in times of war. If a soldier is traveling with his weapon on the left side of his horse or carriage, it would be more natural to have your sword arm closer to the center of the road so that you’re not tempted to point it at people. Therefore, it makes sense for all travelers going on foot or by horse-drawn carriage to keep to the left side of the road. With time, people later adopted this practice into law, and even now, many countries use this regulation when deciding which side they should drive.\n\nWhat are the Countries that Drive on the Left?\n\nApproximately 90 countries drive on the left, including the United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, Ireland, New Zealand, and most English-speaking Caribbean countries. Also, some UK overseas territories like Gibraltar are left-hand-drive. Some people from former British colonies like India, Pakistan, and Malaysia still drive on the left.\n\nReason for Which Countries Have the Right-Side Drive\n\nSome rules of the road are easy to follow. For instance, if you drive on the right side of the road, you avoid colliding with cars from your left, such as motorbikes, bicycles, and horse-drawn carriages. The answer to the above question is given below. Here is a look at some likely reasons it’s become a global practice. There are several possible explanations for why countries drive on the right side of the road, but it boils down to a couple of factors: history and geography. Britain was the first country to use right-hand driving, and it is believed that this became ingrained in their culture through colonization. Before automobiles came into being, there were horses and carts, which made it easier for riders to navigate on the left side of their horse as they maintained control with their left hand/arm when riding. When self-propelled vehicles started becoming popular during the early 1800s, they began driving on the right to match those who continued depending on the left and avoid collisions.\n\nCountries Driving on the Right\n\nOver 70 countries drive on the right, including North and South America (except Canada and Suriname), most countries in mainland Europe and a few other English-speaking countries. Some formerly left-hand-drive countries have changed to right and vice versa, including Liberia, Myanmar, and briefly Malaya after independence from the UK. The United States is one of many countries that drive on the right; originally, it was to prevent traffic accidents in colonial America from Britain. In general, streets were designed so that important buildings were to the left of entrances while windows were to the right allowing keepers to shoot at unwanted intruders.\n\nConclusion\n\nDriving on the left or right may seem trivial, but it has a profound history. By learning about the different countries that operate on the left and right, you’ll be better prepared to make informed decisions about going to your own country! After reading this blog, you know that there are some compelling reasons behind driving on the left or right in different countries. You’ll also be well-prepared to answer why this practice is so prevalent in some countries but not in others."
