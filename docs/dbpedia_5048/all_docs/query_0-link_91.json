        "text": "I put “Main” before my title so we can discuss this idea here and not be burried in the archives if there even is one around. With that out of the way…\n\nThis is probably wishful thinking, but it would be great if we could have an option to Switch the Driver’s cockpit position from Left or Right. An example of this is from Euro Truck Simulator 2, wherein you can customize in the dealership your preferred driving position. Now we all know that not all European countries drive on the right or left side, as well as some parts in Asia.\n\nI live in a country where its in Left Hand Drive, so by default I’m used to driving in that orientation. For some cars in Forza Horizon, I LOVE the Audi RS4 Avant even in real life, but when I saw that it was in RHD, I was hesitant to get it when it got released and didn’t bother to buy one in the Auctions ever since. I had japanese cars that I’ve customized JDM style, but I often use it when I’m not racing. I guess its preference? I spend most of my time playing Forza by just roaming around the map and role playing with friends.\n\nLet me know if this could be a plausible idea to suggest. This would significantly ease my driving experience especially when some of the coolest cars in Forza are also in RHD.\n\nCLICK VOTE if you would like to see this happen\n\nA lot of British cars added in FH4 were LHD, presumably because they were scanned in the U.S. by Turn 10. As a Brit, that is a slight irritation. My preference would be for all cars to be in their home market spec, as that probably is the definitive version.\n\nAs far as both left and right hand drive variants being a choice, I doubt it will happen, as two cars would need to be scanned. That’s doubling the work or more likely, would halve the number of in-game cars. Developers have said before that each vehicle takes a year to get added.\n\nI think the OP is referring to the actual side of the road to drive on, not which side the steering wheel is, where people are getting confused here - but surely that depends on which country we’re in?\n\nBut staying with the theme of cars being RHD or LHD personally i think they’ve been really lazy with the vehicles themselves, for example seeing a classic Jag in LHD when really it should depend on where the car has been built should be left or right hand drive! Only a handful are RHD and that’s one thing that ruins this game for me.\n\nIt would be great to choose whether you like left or right steering in cockpit view, since not everybody is a fan of driving in right side, vice versa left side. Depending from with country your from, and since most car has been made both ways, the option to choose when buying a car would be great for a lot of players and give more duality in choosing cars. Personally i only wanna drive leftsided cockpit view cars since iam from EU, BUT there is a lot more fan favourite childhood cars i would love to drive if i had the option to do it from the left side of the cockpit. There is just too many right steering cars. An options to choose between it would be a very much appreciated feature when buying cars.\n\nThanks from a veteran fan of forza"
