        "text": "Dirt roads\n\nMost of the LHT/RHT bordering countries are third-world countries. They are either in the south of Africa or around India. Especially in Africa, most roads outside of big cities are just dirt roads. There are no significant signs, there are no markings on the road and cars just have to “switch sides” at the border if there is even enough space for two sides. There's probably not a lot of traffic on these roads and so there is no big solution necessary.\n\nChaos\n\nIf a road is not a dirt road or/and there is a lot of traffic what happens is that there is either a system in place (more about that later) or it’s just chaos. If you look at google maps you might see a line of trucks waiting in line to either get through customs or find a way through traffic. Maybe the border is pretty strict and because cars trickle through slowly it isn’t too complicated to get everyone to switch sides.\n\nThe border crossing in the image above between South Sudan and Uganda in Nimule seems to have custom centers but no elaborate system to switch sides. One side must merge into the right side after passing the border. You also see thousands of trucks and cars parked and seemingly waiting.\n\nX crossings\n\nOne rather easy way to turn the driving directions around is a type of X-crossing. If you come from the right you cross the left lane, then merge back and continue on the left side. A great example is the border over the Rusumo Falls between Tanzania and Rwanda.\n\nAnother example of a similar crossing exists between Macao and China. Macao is similar to Hong Kong politically. The borders in those places there are a little bit more complicated and utilize multiple systems. The custom centers are huge and google maps alone was not enough for me to understand exactly what is happening. I imagine that within these labyrinths of checks, the lanes end up swapping. But there is one road in Macao leading towards one of these customs centers that has one of these X-Crossings. The lane going towards China is the one that has to yield in order to cross to the right side of the road.\n\nOver Under\n\nLethem\n\nThe border crossing that originally awoke my interest in this topic is the crossing between Guyana and Brazil in Lethem. In order to let cars switch sides it splits both lanes and lets one go over the before merging them back together. This is a really smart way of solving the border issue as it doesn’t stop the flow of traffic. It does require a bridge or a tunnel and exists very similarly in other places.\n\nMoyale between Kenya and Ethiopia is another example of this. Right after the customs center leading into Ethiopia, cars drive under the road leading into Kenya and join the road on the right side.\n\nHighways\n\nOnly between Hong Kong, Macao, and China are there border crossings that are solved with highways that have the left and right lanes already split anyway. In that sense, they are utilizing the “Over Under” solution. The only difference is that this one has the lanes already split anyway.\n\nOne beautiful example of this is the Lotus Bridge between China and Macao. Both lanes go in different directions, then go under the bridge and split depending on whether to go north or south.\n\nTrain\n\nA border I almost forgot to mention in this article is the border between France and England. These two countries do not have a road connecting them but they have a rail-tunnel that has a system in place to transport cars on a train. Switching sides is easy. While in Coquelle-France cars enter the train on the right. In Cheriton-UK they then leave the train on the left side of the train."
