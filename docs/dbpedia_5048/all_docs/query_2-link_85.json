        "text": "First let me start by saying that i am an RHD vehicle owner. i have owned my RHD sports car for 2 yrs. i have driven it 3 times as i baby it like no other since it is my dream car. i have washed and waxed it more times than it has gotten dirty. however, i drive for a living, and i have been driving for over 10yrs and accident free, so i know the laws regarding RHD vehicles, and imported vehicles... Getting used to driving a RHD vehicle takes about 15mins. RHD or LHD makes no difference, if you are a good driver. the driver position is not such a huge difference that it makes you unsafe. unless you were already an unsafe driver...\n\nif we Ban RHD vehicles from our roads, what are we gonna do about vehicles that come from Alberta or other provinces? What about postal vehicles, garbage trucks and those old double decker buses?\n\nnone of those vehicles require you to have any special license for RHD, they do not take any RHD training courses(as there are none) and they seem to work just fine and have for years and years...\n\nok now to the down and dirty\n\nthe ICBC 40% study.... lol .... is a joke to say the least... where do i begin\n\ndid you know that the study performed by ICBC was done because Transport Canada wouldnt do such a study? and the reasoning behind them not doing was due to a lack of information regarding the history of RHD vehicles\n\nDid you know that the ICBC study used the same vehicle more than once? it also had vehicles which were not yet 15yrs old?(the vehicles which are not 15yrs or older are not allowed in our country, and that falls under the jurisdiction of Canada Customs, not ICBC or TC)\n\ndid you know that ICBC does not tell the difference between an collision and an claim in the study and that both are looped together?\n\ndid you know that some vehicles where used in more than one category, such as station wagons and mini vns being used in the SUV category, then being used in the Van/Truck category for the same claim\n\nheres a prime example of why this study isnt accurate\n\ni know of a vehicle in the study (confirmed the id of the vheicle by its VIN number) which was used 3 times, the owner was never in an accident, his claims were a chipped windsheild, a shopping cart hitting his car in a parking lot( the person left her info as she felt bad) and someone opend there door into his car(he left his info too)\n\nafter applying under the FOIP (freedom of information program) to get all the data surrounding the study we found many errors... after reworking the numbers we found that you are only 10-15% more likely to be involved in an claim, not a collision or accident than driving an LHD vehicle.\n\nAlso one reason why RHD vehicles have a higher than LHD vheicls of the same age claim rate is due to there collectabilty and high quality...\n\nThe best part of the study though, is how the man who was heading the study now wants nothing to do with it, he no longer backs it up...\n\nim sure there is more that im missing but im also sure that someone else will fill in some of the missing parts about the Defunct ICBC report\n\nok now i get to the part that i know ALOT about...\n\nPlease Drive BC show us these studies that find icbc's study to have the same results from the UK...\n\ni spent 2-3 weeks searching the internet, calling the UK(my phone bill was big that month) Calling japan etc etc and in all of my searching i found ONE study that made a difference between RHD and LHD vehicles... That study was from Englands military as they have a number of LHD vehicles that they use(keep in mind that they drive RHD all the time on the opposite side of the traffic we drive so a LHD vehicle is the opposite for them). In this study/ report it was noted that LHD vehicles had a SMALLER % accident rate than compared to there usual RHD vehicles.\n\nAnother study which was in regards to a country changing from RHT(Right hand traffic) to LHT noted that there was a drastic increase in accidents for the first 2 yrs as people adjusted to the new traffic flow... but it did not have any mention about which side of the vehicle the driver was driving on...\n\nThen there are nations like Japan which have many RHD and LHD vehicles operating astride one another that use the same auto insurance rates and same traffic laws, they even have dual sided toll booths and drive-thru's to accommodate LHD vehicles...\n\nThe UK which has many mixed vehicles does not have special laws for the vehicles that are not RHD or LHD...\n\nSo all these nations across the world that have mixed vehicles dont see this risk as being large enough to Ban them or make special laws for them. they must be doing something right then...\n\nand finally the claim of 200 vehicles being imported per month making our roads less safe.... ok heres the kicker of that statement...\n\nof these 200vehicles, there is no information that customs keeps that says if its RHD or LHD.... the 200# also includes ATV's, motorcycles, snomobiles, off-road only, and parts only vehicles...\n\nAlso these vehicles which are destined for our roads must still be inspected and approved, which means they must have D.O.T. lighting(DOT isnt that American Gov't), AS1 or AS2 approved windsheild, a 3RD high mount brake light, a neutral safety switch(only if it came with one when it was new) and Tires that have load rates on them...\n\nIn closing i think the laws should be changed, to allow NEWER than 15yr old vehicles to enter our country as NEWER vehicles are much safer than older vehicles, But i am strongly against banning these vehicles or making it so even older vehicles are only allowed in...\n\nas a final thought id like you to really think about this statement\n\nGuns dont kill people, people kill people...\n\nVehicles dont crash, Bad drivers do... If you put a RHD vehicle beside a dodge Viper, beside a semi-truck beside a motorcycle and i ask you to identify the most dangerous vehicle. The only correct answer you can give is \" the one with the person driving it \"\n\nI hope this opens peoples eyes and gets them to really think rather than make a close minded choice based on partial information and perceived risk..."
