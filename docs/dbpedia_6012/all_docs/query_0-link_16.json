        "text": "To incorporate new technical advances into military domain and make those processes more efficient in accuracy, time and cost, a new concept of Network Centric Warfare has been introduced in the US military forces. In Sweden a similar concept has been studied under the name Network Based Defence (NBD). Here we present one of the methodologies, called tactical plan recognition that is aimed to support NBD in future. Advances in sensor technology and modelling produce large sets of data for decision makers. To achieve decision superiority, decision makers have to act agile with proper, adequate and relevant information (data aggregates) available. Information fusion is a process aimed to support decision makers’ situation awareness. This involves a process of combining data and information from disparate sources with prior information or knowledge to obtain an improved state estimate about an agent or phenomena. Plan recognition is the term given to the process of inferring an agent’s...\n\nOne of the greatest difficulties in developing a fusion process is determining the type, quantity, and quality of the information provided. Even when this is accomplished, the utility (relationship) of the information is often difficult to establish. For the problem of combat identification (Combat ID or Combat ID) this is especially taxing. Often numerous sources provide information, but relationship guidelines"
