        "text": "There are decision problems where the preferences that seem rational to many people cannot be accommodated within orthodox decision theory in the natural way. In response, a number of alternatives to the orthodoxy have been proposed. In this paper, I offer an argument against those alternatives and in favour of the orthodoxy. I focus on preferences that seem to encode sensitivity to risk. And I focus on the alternative to the orthodoxy proposed by Lara Buchak’s risk-weighted expected utility theory. I will show that the orthodoxy can be made to accommodate all of the preferences that Buchak’s theory can accommodate.\n\nA central problem of rational expectations equilibrium (REE) theory is that a REE may fail to exist. This failure is known since Kreps (1977). The influential papers of Radner (1979) and Allen (1981) were able to establish that a REE exists only generically. We show that this undesirable feature is intrinsically related to the assumption that individuals are expected utility maximizers (Bayesians). If individuals have ambiguity aversion in the form of the maximin expected utility (MEU) model introduced by Gilboa and Schmeidler (1989), then a REE exists universally and not only generically. To prove this, we provide a suitable generalization of REE, which we call maximin rational expectations equilibrium (MREE). MREE allocations need not to be measurable with respect to the private information of each individual and with respect to the information that the equilibrium prices generate, as it is in the case of the Bayesian REE. We also prove that a MREE is efficient and incentive compa...\n\nA central problem of rational expectations equilibrium (REE) theory is that a REE may fail to exist.
