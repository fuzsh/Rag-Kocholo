Screening generally involves defining a number of criteria which then need to be evaluated for each site. The importance of each criterion to the final evaluation will generally be different. Weights reflecting the relative importance of these criteria can be provided by experts. To evaluate a site, each criterion must be evaluated and scored, and then aggregated, taking into account the importance of the criteria. We propose the use of the Choquet integral for aggregating the scores. The Choquet integral considers the interactions among criteria, i.e. whether they are independent, complementary to each other, or partially repetitive. We also evaluate the Shapley index, which demonstrates how the importance of a given piece of information may change if it is considered by itself or together with other available information. An illustrative example demonstrates how the Choquet integral properly accounts for the presence of redundancy in two site-evaluation criteria, making the screening process more defensible than the standard weighted-average approach.},\n\ndoi = {10.1002/ghg.15},\n\nurl = {https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1048265}, journal = {Greenhouse Gases: Science and Technology},\n\nissn = {2152-3878},\n\nnumber = 2,\n\nvolume = 1,\n\nplace = {United States},\n\nyear = {Tue Mar 01 00:00:00 EST 2011},\n\nmonth = {Tue Mar 01 00:00:00 EST 2011}\n\n}"
