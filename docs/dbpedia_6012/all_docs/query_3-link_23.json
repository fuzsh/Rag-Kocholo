        "text": "I would like to define and use the Choquet integral in Mathematica.\n\nI think the first step should be to define a representation of a non-additive (normalized) measure $\\nu:\\Omega \\rightarrow [0,1]$. Thus, I tried to define some sort of distribution function $F_\\nu(x)$ that represents the measure of the sets $(- \\infty, x]$. A so-called distorted measure $\\nu = h \\circ P$, where $h:[0,1] \\rightarrow [0,1]$ is an increasing function and $P$ a probability measure would do the job.\n\nFor instance, letting $h:[0,1] \\rightarrow [0,1]$ be $h(x)=x^2$ and using the continuous uniform distribution for the sake of simplicity:\n\nh[x_] = x^2 F[x_] = CDF[\\[ProbabilityDistribution[{\"CDF\", \\[CDF[UniformDistribution[], t]]}, {t, -∞, ∞}]], x]\n\nBut here I got stuck since I do not know how I need to tell Matheatica to evaluate something like $\\int{\\nu(\\{\\omega \\in \\Omega| f(\\omega) \\geq x\\}) dx}$.\n\nAny ideas to get this running (maybe there is a much more elegant solution)?"
