        "text": "From a conceptual standpoint, I think that there are three things one asks of an approach to integration\n\n1) An easily accessible geometric interpretation\n\n2) A readily available computational toolbox (e.g. the fundamental theorem of calculus)\n\n3) A flexible theory\n\nThe Lebesgue integral is absolutely unrivaled in (3), but it is actually quite obtuse from the other two points of view. Basic results like the Lebesgue differentiation theorem and the change of variables formula are not at all transparent from the Lebesgue point of view, and geometrically it is no better than the Riemann integral. The Cauchy integral is great if you only care about (2), but it is abysmal at (1) and (3). The Riemann integral, for all its faults, strikes a pretty good balance between (1) and (2). It is even known to enjoy an occasional technical advantage over the Lebesgue theory; for instance, one must invent the theory of distributions to make sense of the Cauchy principal value of an improper integral in the Lebesgue theory if I recall correctly.\n\nIn line with what others have said in the comments, which of the three criteria you care most about really depends on the audience.\n\nFor a class full of engineers and business majors, the question is essentially moot: two students out of a hundred can correctly define the integral of a continuous function at the end of the semester. But in my view the real point of such classes is to help students develop the language and the skills necessary to reason with rates of change. So in the end it hardly matters what the precise definitions were, and to the extent that it does matter the Riemann integral is quite well suited.\n\nFor a class full of grad students, on the other hand, the point is to show the students how to prove theorems. So there is no choice but to use the Lebesgue integral, and the Riemann integral can be largely ignored (as it is in most graduate real analysis classes).\n\nThe gray area lies in more advanced undergraduate analysis classes. Often these classes are populated by math, physics, and engineering majors who intend to actually do something with mathematics one day. The problem with teaching the Lebesgue integral to such students is that with undergrads you have to spend half the semester on measure theory, detracting from the time that should be spent on the topology of Euclidean space, multilinear algebra, and whatever else belongs in such a course. I can't even imagine how one builds integration in higher dimensions from the Cauchy point of view, short of turning Fubini's theorem into a definition. So the Riemann integral seems like a perfectly reasonable compromise to me. I admit that I found it a little frustrating to learn a theory that I even knew at the time I was probably never going to use, but I lived through the experience.\n\nHere are some unpolemical facts concerning the Riemann integral:\n\nThe Riemann integral has a geometric interpretation which is different than that of the Lebesgue integral and is certainly useful in some places. For a bounded set $S \\subset \\mathbb{R}^N$, Riemann integrability of the characteristic function of $S$ is equivalent to the Jordan measurability of $S$. Now the Jordan measurable sets form an algebra but not a $\\sigma$-algebra, and there are important geometric implications of this. For instance see Theorem 3 of these notes and the discussion just after, which gives a geometric property of Jordan measurable sets (only!) which is important in number theory (and indeed, these are notes from a first number theory course at the advanced undergraduate level).\n\nSimilarly the Riemann integral and not the Lebesgue integral shows up in the theory of uniform distribution: see e.g. Theorem 7 of these notes.\n\nAnother pleasant consequence of the Riemann (and not Darboux, which is easier) theory is that certain sums which come up -- not every day, perhaps, but not so rarely either -- can be evaluated by identifying them as Riemann sums, which would otherwise be hard to evaluate. In fact one of the only gaffes in Rudin's Principles of Mathematical Analysis I know of is the following: he develops the Darboux theory entirely because it's easier, and he likes to keep things succinct and clean at almost any cost. But then at at least one point in the text he uses convergence of Riemann sums to the integral: that's cheating, plain and simple.\n\nAdded: with some reluctance, I will wade slightly into pedagogy. Let me say that I taught a second semester real analysis course for undergraduate math majors in which the Riemann integral was one third of the course material. There were two sections for this course, an honors section and a not honors section, and I taught the \"not\". I was truly curious to see how much of a pain the Riemann integral would be: when you sort of wave at it while teaching freshman calculus, it starts to look terribly complicated.\n\nI actually enjoyed teaching this material maybe most of anything in the course (which I thoroughly enjoyed teaching). I found that there was just the right amount of messiness to it, and especially, with a little foresight, the amount of messiness can be controlled as arguments that are made again and again can be packaged and presented to students as such, if you like. I could have smoothed over the presentation a little more by skipping Riemann in favor of Darboux (again, as Rudin does), but I didn't want to. Permit me to claim that working through some of the bookkeeping of slightly changing a partition and keeping track of the effect on the Riemann sum builds character. Indeed, I think this sort of careful, detail-oriented work with inequalities and such is the essence of a certain very important kind of analytic thinking, which nowadays seems to go under the label hard analysis (as opposed to \"soft\", not \"easy\"). (In fact I think that the spirit of hard analysis is mostly absent in the works of Bourbaki and -- not coincidentally! -- Dieudonné, to its detriment. But I really don't want to debate that point here.)\n\n[Added many years later: I no longer have a reasonable copy of the course notes referred to above. I used them as a basis for a treatment of Riemann integration in a later course: please see Chapter 8 of these notes.]\n\nIn contrast, everyone I've talked to who teaches a course on Lebesgue integration tells me that the technical details are just as onerous as they remember from their student days -- or more so, depending on how much they've blocked out. (Edit: not anymore. See fedja's enthusiastic answer to this question.) The proofs of some of the basic results in measure theory are intricate but also rather boring, and I wonder whether any analysts will stand up to say that they learned something from them and use them in their work. The instructor of my basic measure theory course (an eminent hard analyst whom I will pay the courtesy of not naming), after writing Fubini's Theorem on the board, paused, sighed, turned to us and said: \"The challenge of this proof will be to stay awake.\" The fact that some analysts have at least semi-seriously advocated alternatives to the Axiom of Choice in which every function is measurable says something to me about the level of technicality of the subject.\n\nI am going to argue that Dieudonne’ is actually using limits of Riemann sums to define his “Cauchy” integral. Dieudonne’ hides his use of Riemann sums within the proof of existence of primitives of regulated functions. (Of course existence of primitives is exactly where the rest of us also appeal to the Riemann integral of continuous functions.) In section 8.7.2, on page 160 of my first edition of Dieudonne’, he writes down a primitive of a step function, i.e., a Riemann sum for a step function on a sub interval [a,x] of [a,b], which is just a piecewise linear function. Then he appeals to a prior theorem that in case the step functions under consideration converge uniformly to another function f, then these primitives also converge to a primitive of f.\n\nNow if f is continuous, the Riemann sums for f (on intervals [a,x] with variable right end point) are precisely step functions converging uniformly to f. Hence for continuous functions f, he is proving that the Riemann sums, do converge to a primitive of f. Thus the only difference between his integral and Riemann’s is the class of functions to which they apply. A weakness of Dieudonne’s approach to my mind, is the lack of a means of finding the uniformly convergent step functions needed in his definition (for arbitrary regulated functions). In Riemann’s approach the approximating step functions are easy to choose (even for arbitrary Riemann integrable functions).\n\nFor any regulated function f, there exist Riemann sum functions that converge uniformly to f, but Riemann observes this is unnecessary, since L^1 convergence suffices. As long as the set of discontinuities has measure zero (which criterion Riemann proved in an equivalent form), then any choice of the Riemann sum functions will converge to the integral. In Dieudonne’s approach, one must find step functions which converge uniformly, which he accomplishes by a non constructive compactness argument in 7.6.1. Of course once these approximating step functions are found, he approximates the integral by their Riemann sum, as in 8.7.2. So the basic idea that an integral is approximated by Riemann sums is common to both treatments. The difference is that Riemann’s approach applies to a wider class of functions, and provides an easier way to choose the approximating sums.\n\nAdded later: My hat is off to Harry for this question, and all who have answered. I learned a lot from them, especially short ones like Allen Knutson’s. Building on them, I throw out a possible combined approach. (It helps if the student read Euler’s precalculus book with infinite series but never mind.)\n\nI address those beginning students who care about understanding what is done and why, more than seeing it the absolute “best” way on first encounter. I.e. I suggest the first job is to motivate the best way, not present it in full.\n\nThe basic problem is to define a way of adding up, or averaging, values of a function with an uncountable number of values. All competing definitions seem to use limits of functions with a finite set of values, or “simple functions”. Thus the only question is which simple functions to use and what method of taking a limit.\n\nOne could begin with the integral of a monotone continuous function, as did Newton, and exhibit the two standard ways of approximating it by integrals of simple functions, namely adding up over columns (Riemann), and adding up over rows (Lebesgue). Here they are almost the same, in that one representative value is chosen for all points in a subinterval of the domain. From a computational viewpoint, Riemann’s method is superior since the length of the domain subintervals is more easily calculated. Thus for elementary approximations, Riemann’s method is worth knowing.\n\nIntroducing more complicated functions one observes how the domain “level sets” become more complicated in Lebesgue’s approach, making the definition of their size a significant task, while Riemann’s approximations remain easy to calculate. One could then define the Riemann integral and state its fundamental theorem, and define “negligible sets” and state the Riemann-Lebesgue criterion for Riemann integrability, or just mention the special cases of continuous and piecewise monotone functions, possibly proving the latter, or the former assuming uniform continuity. One could also state and/or prove the convergence theorem involving uniform limits, possibly informally. The characteristic function of the rationals, whose integral should exist for anyone knowing infinite series, but does not in Riemann’s sense, shows one limitation of this approach, whetting the appetite for Lebesgue. It also explains the failure of convergence for pointwise limits.\n\nOne might admit that much of the work in the first course will use the technique of antiderivatives rather than integrals, accepting in spirit Dieudonne’s argument, but that Riemann sums are crucial for approximations. For the technique of evaluating integrals by antiderivatives, one can observe the usual proof of the FTC works on continuous functions for any definition of the integral which is monotone and additive over subdivisions of the domain.\n\nPoint out it is hard to give a full fundamental theorem for Riemann integration, i.e. to intrinsically characterize indefinite integrals of all Riemann integrable functions. One could mention the advantages of Lebesgue’s definition.\n\nIn this context one could discuss a more flexible definition of antiderivative as Dieudonne’ does, at least for step functions, and remark that one can characterize indefinite integrals of bounded functions with only a finite (or countable) set of discontinuities.\n\nSince many instructors in the US omit proofs entirely in beginning calculus, the question of whether to present complete proofs for Riemann integration applies more to a beginning analysis course, where I think it can prove useful practice for many students.\n\nTo the argument that presenting the most advanced and abstract version first is more efficient, I would point out that having been taught that way, it took me another 40 years to understand what is going on, hence not very efficient for me.\n\nOne available compromise is to just work with the following definition of a Riemann integral (which works fine in ${\\mathbb R}^n$ as well:\n\nA bounded function $f$ on $[a,b]$ is Riemann integrable if and only if for every $\\epsilon > 0$ there are step functions $\\psi_1, \\psi_2 : [a,b] \\to {\\mathbb R}$ such that\n\n$\\psi_1 \\leq f \\leq \\psi_2 $\n\nand\n\n$\\int_a^b \\left( \\psi_2(x) - \\psi_1(x) \\right) dx < \\epsilon$\n\nI think using this definition is easy and geometrically intuitive, and on the other hand working with this definition prepares you conceptually for the Lebesgue integral where you juggle \"simple\" functions instead of step functions. Thus, you already get a nice piece of the Lebesgue point of view.\n\nThe definition also demonstrates the broad principle that to construct an object in real analysis which should be a real number, one often needs a good way to overestimate/underestimate the object you're going for, and there are plenty of examples of that in real analysis outside of integration (liminf and limsup being the simplest) -- after all, this is just one point of view on how the real numbers are constructed.\n\nTo give an example of the ease of use: to prove the fundamental theorem, suppose $F$ is continuous with a Riemann integrable derivative $F' = f$ and let $\\psi_2$ be a step function above $f$ which induces the partition $a \\leq x_1 \\leq x_2 \\leq \\ldots \\leq x_{n-1} \\leq x_n = b$. Then the total change of $F$ from $a$ to $b$ is the sum of the \"small\" changes $F(b) - F(a) = \\sum_{k=1}^n (F(x_n) - F(x_{n-1}))$ which is less than or equal to $\\int \\psi_2(x) dx$ by the mean value theorem. Similarly for the other inequality.\n\nThus, one can go pretty far with this definition, but the results which separate the Riemann integral from the Lebesgue integral (e.g. that $g(f)$ is Riemann integrable for $g$ continuous and $f$ Riemann integrable or the fact that Riemann sums converge to the Riemann integral), one needs to use the observation that step functions can't be close in terms of area without being uniformly close on all but a small set. You could think this feature is either a clarification or a disadvantage. One certain disadvantage is that it is not the right point of view for integrating vector-valued functions. So you might decide it's better to define the integral in terms of Riemann sums in the first place (giving more of a \"metric space\" point of view and less of an \"ordered space\" point of view). Or you might even decide to skip some of these other topics, depending on your point of view and time available.\n\nRiemann integration is still the simplest form of integration to introduce at an elementary calculus level. Moreover, while Lebesgue integration is often called a \"generalization\" of it, in important ways it could be considered as a sort of generalized \"cousin\" than its most direct generalization.\n\nYou see - in elementary calculus, there are at least two conceptually distinct ways of approaching the integral: the \"antidifferentiation\" approach, and the \"area\" approach. Both of these can be used to motivate the Riemann integral, but when you dig into them more deeply, they actually can be seen to diverge. This fits in with a general theme that one sees as one explores mathematics further - things that \"seem\" equivalent at first actually depend on certain assumptions for that equivalence, and one can talk about what happens when they break down. For example, when one goes from classical to intuitionistic logic, one loses the equivalence of certain formulations of properties of the real numbers such as their completeness.\n\nRiemann integration most directly, I'd say, formulates the \"antidifferentiation\" approach. Here is how. Forget about tangent lines and all that mumbo-jumbo which is badly introduced anyways, and throw out the \"standard textbook\" presentation - its confusing, unintuitive bs.\n\nIntuitively, the derivative represents the sensitivity of the output value of a function to a small perturbation applied to the input value, when the input value is set at some particular position. Think about, say, a knob on a mixing board, controlling how it changes the sound coming in. The knob can be considered as an input, and the sound produced as the output. Now consider what happens if you wiggle the knob a little bit back and forth around that set position, but don't actually move it to a greatly different location permanently. How dramatically does the sound change? Moreover, how dramatically does it change compared to how much you wiggle it?\n\nThe derivative is an idealized version of this. It is given by:\n\n$$\\mbox{sensitivity} := \\frac{\\mbox{size of change in output}}{\\mbox{size of change in input}}$$\n\nbut with the caveat that we make the size of change of input \"infinitely small\", so as to leave only one relevant parameter - the actual input value, and not our changes thereto. The derivative of a function is just the function that gives the sensitivity rating at every possible value of its input: that is, it tells me how much the \"sound\" changes for each and every fixed setting of the knob about which we wiggle it.\n\nIntegration, then, asks, \"if we are given the derivative $f'$ of a function, how can we find $f$?\" And this is how it works. First off, you cannot find it from this information alone: you first need to fix an arbitrary reference to begin the process - that is, you need a specific starting value, say, something to assign to $f(0)$. This, of course, is where the \"constant\" \"$+ C$\" comes from, that you're often told to and come to write with little thought, almost ritual-like.\n\nNow, given this information, suppose we want to evaluate $f$ at some point $x_0$. From the understanding of derivative as sensitivity ratio, we know that if we subject the input of $f$, held at point $x$, to some tiny nudge $\\Delta x$, then we should have\n\n$$f(x + \\Delta x) \\approx f(x) + [f'(x)\\ \\Delta x]$$\n\nwith the approximation the better the smaller $\\Delta x$ is, becoming exact in the limit of an infinitely small nudge.\n\nHence, starting at $x = 0$, so we have $f(0) := C$ as the beginning point, we can imagine \"nudging\" now $x$ a little bit by $\\Delta x$ in the right direction to reach the target $x_0$. We approximate $f(0 + \\Delta x) = f(\\Delta x)$, then, by\n\n$$f(0 + \\Delta x) \\approx f(0) + [f'(0)\\ \\Delta x]$$\n\nwhere, of course, $f'(0)$ we can find, since we are given $f'$ but not $f$. Now that we're there, we can now \"nudge\" one step further: just apply $\\Delta x$ again and now use the value at $f'(0 + \\Delta x)$:\n\n$$f(0 + 2 \\Delta x) \\approx f(0) + [f'(0)\\ \\Delta x] + [f'(0 + \\Delta x)\\ \\Delta x]$$\n\nand likewise, we can do this for $f(0 + 3 \\Delta x)$ by adding to it now $f'(0 + 2 \\Delta x)\\ \\Delta x]$ and so forth until we finally get to within $\\Delta x$ of $x_0$, so as to write\n\n$$f(x_0) \\approx \\sum_{n=0}^{\\lfloor\\frac{x_0}{\\Delta x}\\rfloor} f(n \\Delta x) \\Delta x$$\n\nand then when we take the limit as $\\Delta x \\rightarrow 0$, we presume exact recovery:\n\n$$f(x_0) = C + \\int_{0}^{x_0} f'(x)\\ dx$$\n\nSo that is how Riemann integration arises from \"antidifferentiation\". As you can see, the notion of \"area\" does not enter - instead, what we're actually trying to do is to reconstruct a function from its derivative.\n\nWhat should really be \"surprising\", in a sense, is that we can then also likewise develop the same formula for the integral starting from the concept of area, by the familiar \"divide into vertical rectangles\" construction, and the two happen to be equal, or equivalent. We could, perhaps, instead of calling this \"integral\", we could call it \"area finder\", and we have the intriguing result that \"antidifferentiation\" and the \"area finder\" tell us the same thing. We then decide to name these as two different concepts of integration.\n\nAnd when we go on to more advanced settings, we find they generalize in different ways. In fact, the concept of Lebesgue integration is much more closely related to the area finder concept: this can be seen by noting a very crucial difference from the above which is the fact that a Riemann integral incorporates direction into it, in the motion from $0$ to $x_0$, but areas have no such sense of direction or of \"motion\". The Lebesgue integral, naturally, \"doesn't care\" because instead of taking an upper and lower bound for which the direction from one to the other matters, it takes an undirected set as its \"bounds\". This is what we'd expect from an area measure, and that is what it provides.\n\nInstead, the \"correct\" generalization of the Riemann integral in its own spirit is actually the theory of differential forms and instead of moving to \"strange and pathological discontinuous functions\", we move to differentiable manifolds and the integration of a function along a line on such a manifold.\n\nWe can later remarry the two theories, to then talk about pathological functions on a manifold, but they have to go their separate ways first.\n\nHence, why that Riemann integration should be taught. You couldn't make sense out of any of these bodies of maths. Likewise for other integration concepts. They all have uses and it is important to be able to both understand the relationships as well as the distinctions between them.\n\nIf the students are supposed to do only pure mathematics later on in their professional life, then I have nothing to say.\n\nBut if they are ever supposed to do some applied mathematics, physics or statistics, then my humble opinion is that one should never teach them only the Lebesgue integral. For instance, the connection between Riemann sums and numerical integration techniques (rectangles, trapezes, Simpson, Romberg, Gaussian quadrature, sparse grids, etc.) is one good reason to teach the Riemann integral to applied mathematicians and engineers (at least French ones like me who are definitely supposed to understand the formal theory of Riemann and Lebesgue integration and to swim or sink in Sobolev and Besov spaces). But I'd like to mention another more fundamental and original reason:\n\nMeasure theory itself disqualifies the Lebesgue integral (on which it relies) at least for some important problems of (applied) probability theory.\n\nVery shortly. Consider for instance the Behrens–Fisher problem, the most famous 90 years old open problem in statistics and applied probability theory, with vital applications such as clinical trials (e.g. placebo vs treatment) and, more generally, point (i.e. Lebesgue negligible) null hypothesis testing problems.\n\nIf this problem is trivial for discrete parameters of interest, it does not make sense for continuous ones from the point of view of Bayesian probability theory + measure theory on uncountable sets, for the probability that the numerical values of two continuous parameters with absolutely continuous marginal probability measures wrt the Lebesgue measure on $\\mathbb{R}$ are equal to each other is equal to zero, a priori and a posteriori. Therefore, the Behrens–Fisher problem with continuous parameters admits a trivial but totally useless and meaningless solution under measure theory on uncountable sets.\n\nThat's the reason why the standard Bayesian solution to this problem, found in any textbook, is plain wrong. In particular, it violates measure theory on uncountable sets, by assigning non-zero probabilities to Lebesgue-negligible (e.g. singletons) sets. See A fully Bayesian solution to k-sample tests for comparison and the Behrens–Fisher problem based on the Henstock–Kurzweil integral.\n\nTo get the correct, meaningful, useful and practical solution to this problem, we have to forget measure theory on uncountable sets, that is we have to forget actual, uncountable infinity and go back to potential infinity and measure theory on finite sets, in order to take the limit of the solutions to the discrete problems. By construction, this limit solution, the Bayes–Poincaré factor\n\n$$\\left.\\left[ {\\frac{{\\int\\limits_{{\\Theta _0}} {\\prod\\limits_{i = 1}^k {{p_{\\left. {{\\theta _i}} \\right|{x_i}}}\\left( \\theta \\right)} {\\text{d}}\\theta \\,} }}{{\\prod\\limits_{i = 1}^k {\\int\\limits_{{\\Theta _i}} {{p_{\\left. {{\\theta _i}} \\right|{x_i}}}\\left( \\theta \\right){\\text{d}}\\theta \\,} } }}} \\right]\\middle/\\left[ {\\frac{{\\int\\limits_{{\\Theta _0}} {\\prod\\limits_{i = 1}^k {{p_{{\\theta _i}}}\\left( \\theta \\right)} {\\text{d}}\\theta \\,} }}{{\\prod\\limits_{i = 1}^k {\\int\\limits_{{\\Theta _i}} {{p_{{\\theta _i}}}\\left( \\theta \\right){\\text{d}}\\theta \\,} } }}} \\right]\\right.$$\n\nis obtained from the limits of Riemann sums that are, by definition, Cauchy–Riemann–Darboux–…–Denjoy–Luzin–Perron–Henstock–Kurzweil integrals but not Lebesgue's, since we had to forget measure theory on uncountable sets for a while. Conversely, I consider that the Behrens–Fisher problem remained unsolved for such a long time (until there is evidence to the contrary) due to the old habit of jumping directly into the actual, uncountable infinity within the standard Borel–Lebesgue–Kolmogorov measure-theoretic setting for probability theory.\n\nThis is in line with Poincaré's considerations about the physical continuum versus the mathematical one, see for instance Ly - Identité et égalité, le criticisme de Poincaré:\n\nIf, indeed, Poincaré defends the philosophical thesis according to which we must understand the continuum as a potential infinity, it is not for lack of questioning it, but because he finds in potential infinity a virtue that actual infinity does not possess. It is therefore not only because of the paradoxes that it engenders that Poincaré rejects actual infinity, it is because by considering the infinity of the continuum as actual and not as potential, we do not see how it gives mathematics the specificity that makes it the privileged language of physics. For then one is forbidden to take into account both the sensible intuition and the intuition a priori that preside over the mathematical conception of the continuum and whose importance is only understood once the positive virtue of the potential infinity is recognized.\n\nand Poincaré's silence on the Lebesgue integral and measure theory between 1904 and 1912 is no surprise An historical mystery : Poincaré’s silence on Lebesgue integral and measure theory?.\n\nThat's the most fundamental reason why I believe one should still teach Riemann integration or Henstock–Kurzweil's like in Belgium, as soon as one has some physical, statistical or practical applications in mind, because we cannot always jump directly into actual infinity.\n\nI don't agree with Dieudonné: the Henstock–Kurzweil integral is another sensible answer, there are pros and cons for both integrals, depending on one's point of view.\n\nIn his Eléments d'histoire des mathématiques, Bourbaki mentions the \"deep works\" of Denjoy, Perron, de la Vallée-Poussin, Khintchine, Luzin, Banach, etc. (chapter Intégration, p. 282, third edition, 1974) but not Kurzweil's and Henstock's."
