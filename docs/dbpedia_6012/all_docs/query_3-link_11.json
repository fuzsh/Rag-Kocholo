So we have\n\nwhere \\(\\theta \\in (0,b-a)\\). We complete the proof. □\n\nExample 3.2\n\nConsider the function \\(f(x)=x2^{x^{2}-2}\\) on \\(\\mathbf{R}^{+}\\). This function is positive, increasing, and log-convex. Obviously \\(f(1)=1/2, f(2)=8\\). Let \\(m(x)=x^{2}\\). According to Theorem 3.2 (2), there exists \\(\\theta \\in (0,1)\\) such that\n\ndue to \\(L(f(1),f(2))\\approx 2.7050\\).\n\nIn fact, we have\n\nwhere \\(\\theta \\in [0,1]\\).

This suggests an open question: Can we find the upper bound of the Choquet integral when the log-convex function is not monotone? In the following we shall present some results concerning this issue.\n\nTheorem 3.3\n\nLet f be a positive, measurable, and log-convex function on \\(\\mathbf{R}^{+}\\) and \\(\\mu =\\mu_{m}\\) be a distorted Lebesgue measure. If \\(f(0)\\neq f(1)\\), then we have\n\nfor \\(f(0)< f(1)\\) and\n\nfor \\(f(0)>f(1)\\).\n\nProof\n\nUsing the log-convexity of f, for \\(x\\in [0,1]\\), we have\n\nIf \\(f(0)< f(1)\\), then \\(f(0)^{1-x}f(1)^{x}=f(0)\\cdot (\\frac{f(1)}{f(0)} )^{x}\\) is increasing on \\(\\mathbf{R}^{+}\\). By (4) of Lemma 2.1 and Lemma 2.2, we frequently have\n\nConversely, if \\(f(0)>f(1)\\), then \\(f(0)^{1-x}f(1)^{x}\\) is decreasing on \\([0,1]\\). We similarly have\n\nThe proof is completed. □\n\nRemark 3.1\n\nWhen \\(f(0)=f(1)\\) in Theorem 3.3, we have \\(f(x)\\leq f(0), x\\in [0,1]\\). Taking into account (1) and (2) of Lemma 2.1, we get\n\nIn the next theorem, we prove the general case of Theorem 3.3.\n\nTheorem 3.4\n\nLet f be a positive, measurable, and log-convex function on \\(\\mathbf{R}^{+}\\) and \\(\\mu =\\mu_{m}\\) be a distorted Lebesgue measure. If \\(f(a)\\neq f(b)\\), then we have\n\nfor \\(f(a)< f(b)\\); and\n\nfor \\(f(a)>f(b)\\).\n\nProof\n\nWe know that\n\nUsing the log-convexity of f, for \\(t= \\frac{x}{b-a}\\in [0,1]\\), we have\n\nIf \\(f(a)< f(b)\\), then \\(f(a)^{1-t}f(b)^{t}\\) is increasing. By (4) of Lemma 2.1 and Lemma 2.2, we frequently have\n\nwhere \\(t=\\frac{x}{b-a}\\).\n\nConversely, if \\(f(a)>f(b)\\), then \\(f(a)^{1-t}f(b)^{t}\\) is decreasing. We similarly have\n\nwhere \\(t=\\frac{x}{b-a}\\).\n\nThe proof is completed. □\n\nRemark 3.2\n\nIn the case \\(f(a)=f(b)\\) in Theorem 3.4, we can get\n\nRemark 3.3\n\nWe need to point out that Theorems 3.3 and 3.4 hold for the general log-convex function; that is to say, the two theorems do not require that f is monotone. Of course, even so, they hold for a monotone log-convex function.\n\nExample 3.3\n\nConsider the function \\(f(x)=2^{x^{2}-3}\\) on \\(\\mathbf{R}^{+}\\) and the distorted Lebesgue measure \\(\\mu =\\mu_{m}\\), where \\(m(x)=x^{2}\\) in Example 3.1. We have, according to Theorem 3.3,\n\nExample 3.4\n\nConsider the function \\(f(x)=x2^{x^{2}-2}\\) on \\(\\mathbf{R}^{+}\\) and the distorted Lebesgue measure \\(\\mu =\\mu_{m}\\), where \\(m(x)=x^{2}\\) in Example 3.2. We have, according to Theorem 3.4,\n\nIn the following, we shall discuss the upper bound of the Choquet integral for the log-convex function in the framework of the general non-additive measure.\n\nTheorem 3.5\n\nLet f be a nonnegative, measurable, and log-convex function on \\(\\mathbf{R}^{+}\\) and μ be a non-additive measure. If \\(f(0)\\neq f(1)\\), then we have\n\nFurthermore, if \\(f(0)< f(1)\\), then\n\nif \\(f(0)>f(1)\\), then\n\nProof\n\nUsing the log-convexity of f, for \\(x\\in [0,1]\\), we have\n\nDue to (4) of Lemma 2.1, we frequently have\n\nFor simplicity, we denote \\(F(x)=f(0)^{1-x}f(1)^{x}\\). It is easy to get \\(F(0)=f(0), F(1)=f(1)\\), and \\(F'(x)=f(0)^{1-x}f(1)^{x}\\ln \\frac{f(1)}{f(0)}\\).\n\nIf \\(f(0)< f(1)\\), then we have\n\nConversely, if \\(f(0)>f(1)\\), then we have\n\nThe proof is completed. □\n\nRemark 3.4\n\nSpecially, when \\(\\mu =\\mu_{m}\\) is a distorted Lebesgue measure, Theorem 3.5 still holds.\n\nExample 3.5\n\nConsider the function \\(f(x)=2^{x^{2}-3}\\) on \\(\\mathbf{R}^{+}\\) and the distorted Lebesgue measure \\(\\mu =\\mu_{m}\\), where \\(m(x)=x^{2}\\), in Examples 3.1 and 3.3. We have \\(f(0)=1/8\\), \\(f(1)=1/4\\), and\n\nThe next theorem is the general case of Theorem 3.5.\n\nTheorem 3.6\n\nLet f be a nonnegative, measurable, and log-convex function on \\(\\mathbf{R}^{+}\\) and μ be a non-additive measure. For \\([a,b]\\subset \\mathbf{R}^{+}\\), if \\(f(a)\\neq f(b)\\), then we have\n\nFurthermore, if \\(f(a)< f(b)\\), then\n\nand, if \\(f(a)>f(b)\\), then\n\nwhere \\(t=\\frac{x-a}{b-a}\\).\n\nProof\n\nUsing the log-convexity of f, for \\(x\\in [a,b]\\), we have\n\nwhere \\(t=\\frac{x-a}{b-a}\\). We have \\(G(a)=f(a), G(b)=f(b)\\), and\n\nDue to (4) of Lemma 2.1, we have\n\nIf \\(f(a)< f(b)\\), then we have\n\nConversely, if \\(f(a)>f(b)\\), then we have\n\nThe proof is completed. □\n\nExample 3.6\n\nConsider the function \\(f(x)=x2^{x^{2}-2}\\) on \\(\\mathbf{R}^{+}\\) and the distorted Lebesgue measure \\(\\mu =\\mu_{m}\\), where \\(m(x)=x^{2}\\) in Examples 3.2 and 3.4. We have \\(f(1)=1/2\\), \\(f(2)=8\\) and, according to Theorem 3.6,\n\nThe remainder of this paper will be mainly devoted to Jensen’s inequality of the Choquet integral for log-convex functions.\n\nIt is well known that there is a result: if \\(g: \\mathbf{R}^{+}\\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}^{+}\\) is a log-convex function, then g is convex. The proof is sketched for the readers’ convenience.\n\nProof\n\nWe firstly come to show the following inequality (Dieudonne [23]; Kallenberg [24]): Let \\(x, y\\geq 0, 1< p, q<\\infty \\), and \\({\\frac{1}{p}+\\frac{1}{q}=1}\\), then\n\nfrom the concavity of the logarithm function.\n\nSince g is a log-convex function, for all \\(x, y\\geq 0\\) and \\(\\lambda \\in (0,1)\\), we have\n\nPutting \\(p=\\frac{1}{\\lambda }, q=\\frac{1}{1-\\lambda }\\), frequently we can get\n\nSo we obtain\n\nwhich means g is convex. □\n\nDue to the above result and Lemma 2.3, we can easily show the following theorem.\n\nTheorem 3.7\n\n(Jensen’s inequality)\n\nAssume that \\(f\\in L_{C} ^{+}(\\mu )\\) and the non-additive measure μ is concave (convex). If \\(g: \\mathbf{R}^{+}\\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}^{+}\\) is a log-convex (log-concave) function, then we have\n\nProof\n\nLet \\(y_{0}=(C) \\int f \\,d\\mu \\). g is log-convex, then g is convex. So there exists a line through \\(y_{0}\\), i.e., there exist a and b such that\n\nfor any \\(y\\in \\mathbf{R}\\). Therefore, it follows that \\(a\\cdot f(x)+b \\leq g\\circ f(x)\\) for all \\(x\\in X\\). When \\(a>0\\), by property \\((2)\\) in Lemma 2.1, we have \\((C) \\int a\\cdot f \\,d\\mu =a\\cdot (C) \\int f \\,d\\mu \\); when \\(a<0\\), we have\n\nbecause μ is concave, which implies \\(\\mu \\geq \\bar{\\mu }\\). Then, by Lemma 2.1, we have\n\nas desired. □\n\nSimilarly we shall present the following Jensen inequality for the Choquet integral of the log-convex function in two dimensions.\n\nTheorem 3.8\n\n(Jensen’s inequality in two dimensions)\n\nAssume that \\(f, h\\in L_{C}^{+}(\\mu )\\) and the non-additive measure μ is concave (convex). If f, h are comonotonic and \\(g: \\mathbf{R}^{+}\\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}^{+}\\) is a log-convex (log-concave) function, then we have\n\nProof\n\nLet \\(y_{0}=(C) \\int f \\,d\\mu , z_{0}=(C) \\int h \\,d\\mu \\). g is log-convex, then g is convex. So there exists a plane through \\((y_{0}, z_{0})\\), i.e., there exist a, b, c such that\n\nfor any \\(y, z\\in \\mathbf{R}\\). Therefore, it follows that \\(a \\cdot f( \\omega )+b\\cdot h(\\omega )+c\\leq g(f(\\omega ), h(\\omega ))\\). By Lemma 2.1 and the proof of Theorem 3.7, we have\n\nTherefore, the conclusion holds. □\n\nRemark 3.5\n\n(1)\n\nHere the two discussed Jensen inequalities of the Choquet integral for log-convex functions are valid whenever the considered non-additive measure μ is concave, which compares also the articles [9] and [15] where all considered inequalities for Choquet integrals hold whenever μ is concave.\n\nIn particular, when the non-additive measure μ is a plausibility function or the concave distortion measure \\(\\mu =\\mu_{m}\\), where m is a concave function, both inequalities above hold.\n\n(2)\n\nIn fact, for the Choquet integral of log-convex functions, we might investigate the lower bound, when the considered non-additive measure μ is concave, using Jensen’s inequality. We shall provide an easy example below.\n\nExample 3.7\n\nConsider the function \\(L(x)=2^{(x+1)^{2}}\\) on \\(\\mathbf{R}^{+}\\). \\(L(x)=g\\circ f\\) is the compound function of \\(g(u)\\) and \\(f(x)\\), where \\(g(u)=2^{u^{2}}\\) and \\(u=f(x)=x+1\\). Evidently \\(g(u)\\) is a log-convex function."
