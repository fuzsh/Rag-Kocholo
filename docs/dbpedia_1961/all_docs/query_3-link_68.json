        "text": "FOCUS: MUSIC, NATIONALISM, AND THE MAKING OF THE NEW EUROPE\n\nTwo decades after the fall of communism in Eastern Europe and one decade into the twenty-ﬁrst century, European music remains one of the most powerful forces for shaping nationalism. Using intensive ﬁeldwork throughout Europe—from participation in alpine foot pilgrimages to studies of the grandest music spectacle anywhere in the world, the Eurovision Song Contest—Philip V. Bohlman reveals the ways in which music and nationalism intersect in the shaping of the New Europe. Focus: Music, Nationalism, and the Making of the New Europe begins with the emergence of the European nation-state in the Middle Ages and extends across long periods during which Europe’s nations used music to compete for land and language, and to expand the colonial reach of Europe to the entire world. Bohlman contrasts the “national” and the “nationalist” in music, examining the ways in which their impact on society can be positive and negative—beneﬁcial for European cultural policy and dangerous in times when many European borders are more fragile than ever. The New Europe of the twenty-ﬁrst century is more varied, more complex, and more politically volatile than ever, and its music resonates fully with these transformations. Features • Examines music and nationalism in both the historical past and in the changing present. • Considers nationalism in all genres of music, from folk music to popular music to religious music to European classical music. • Presents nationalism to students in all areas of musical study, including music historians, ethnomusicologists, music theorists, and performers. • The accompanying CD includes both traditional and contemporary sounds of European music. Philip V. Bohlman is the Mary Werkman Distinguished Service Professor of the Humanities and of Music at the University of Chicago, and Honorarprofessor at the Hochschule für Musik und Theater Hannover, Germany. Among the awards for his wide-ranging publications are the Edward Dent Medal of the Royal Music Association, the Berlin Prize of the American Academy in Berlin, the Donald Tovey Memorial Prize of Oxford University, and the Derek Allen Prize for Musicology (for the ﬁrst edition of Focus: Music, Nationalism, and the Making of the New Europe) from the British Academy, to which he was elected as a Corresponding Fellow in 2007. The Focus on World Music Series is designed speciﬁcally for area courses in world music and ethnomusicology. Written by the top ethnomusicologists in their ﬁeld, the Focus books balances sound pedagogy with exemplary scholarship. Each book provides a telescopic view of the musics and cultures addressed, giving the reader a general introduction to the music and culture of the area and then zooming in on different musical styles with in-depth case studies.\n\ni\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 2 3 4 5\n\nFOCUS ON WORLD MUSIC Series Editor: Michael B.

Die Turmstube ist dunkel. Aber sie leuchten sich ins Gesicht mit ihrem Lächeln. Sie tasten vor sich her wie Blinde und ﬁnden den Andern wie eine Tür. Fast wie Kinder, die sich vor der Nacht ängstigen, drängen sie sich ineinander ein. Und doch fürchten sie sich nicht. Da ist nichts, was gegen sie wäre: kein Gestern, kein Morgen; denn die Zeit ist eingestürzt. Und sie blühen aus ihren Trümmern. —Rainer Maria Rilke / Viktor Ullmann\n\nv\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 2 3 4 5 vi\n\nContents\n\nList of Figures Musical Examples on Compact Disc Series Foreword by Michael B.

With the publication of both the ten-volume Garland Encyclopedia of World Music and the second edition of the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians (2001), we now have access to general reference resources that ethnomusicologists and world music enthusiasts of even just a few years ago could only have dreamed of. University and other academic presses—Chicago, Oxford, Cambridge, Illinois, Temple, Wesleyan, Indiana, California, Routledge—have produced excellent ethnomusicological monographs, edited volumes, and smaller-scale reference works in ever-increasing numbers, many accompanied by CDs, DVDs, and other media that bring the musics described vividly to life. A host of new introductory-level textbooks for freshman/sophomore-level world music survey courses have come out too, along with new editions of long-established textbooks catering to that market. New instructional resources for teaching these same kinds of introductory survey courses have been created in addition, the Oxford Global Music Series perhaps most notable among them. And the Internet has of course revolutionized everything, with thousands upon thousands of Web-based resources—from superb scholarly and educational resources such as Smithsonian Global Sound (www.smithsonianglobalsound.org) and Grove Music Online to the wild frontiers of YouTube and myriad commercial online music providers—all now available from your desktop at the click of a mouse. Yet for all of this profuse and diverse publishing activity, there remains a conspicuous gap in the literature. We still lack a solid corpus of high-quality textbooks designed speciﬁcally for area courses in world music, ethnomusicology, and interdisciplinary programs with a strong music component. The need for such texts is greatest where courses for upper-division undergraduate and entry-level graduate students are taught, but it extends to courses at the freshman and sophomore levels as well, especially those enrolling music majors and other students who are serious and motivated. xiv\n\nSeries Foreword • xv\n\nWhat has been needed for such courses are books that balance sound pedagogy with exemplary scholarship, and that are substantive in content yet readily accessible to specialist and non-specialist readers alike. These books would be written in a lively and engaging style by leading ethnomusicologists and educators, bringing wide interdisciplinary scope and relevance to the contemporary concerns of their readership. They would, moreover, provide a telescopic view of the musics and cultures they addressed, zooming in from broad-based surveys of expansive music-culture areas and topics toward compelling, in-depth case studies of speciﬁc musicultural traditions and their myriad transformations in the modern world. This is precisely what Routledge’s Focus on World Music series delivers, with books that are authoritative, accessible, pedagogically strong, richly illustrated, and accompanied by a compelling compact disc of musical examples linked integrally to the text. I am delighted to be part of the team that has brought this exciting and important series to fruition. I hope you enjoy reading these books as much as I have! Michael B.

Let us all sing together With different voices And a single heart. (Opening verse of the winning entry for the lyrics of the Spanish national anthem, 11 January 2008) It’s absolute drivel. . . . It could be about any country: Belarus, Lithuania, Spain. It would make a good theme tune for the Eurovision Song Contest. (On the lyrics for the new Spanish national anthem, 12 January 2008) The era of the New Europe is fully upon us. At midnight on 21 December 2007, the nations of Europe also entered a new phase, a new edition in the long history of European nationalism and the latest revision of that history, as the New Europe after the fall of communism and the rise of reuniﬁcation after 1989. The borders between the “New EU States” and the “Old EU States” were opened. Passing from Germany to Poland or from Austria to Hungary no longer required that travelers on holiday or truckers hauling goods from one part of Europe to the other stop and show passports. The lifting of border controls took place not only between East and West, “New Europe” and “Old Europe,” but also between the individual nations of Eastern Europe, reviving the ghost of the economically and politically uniﬁed region of the Warsaw Pact. Europe was one again. The headlines of European newspapers proclaimed “Open Travel for Europe” (“Freie Fahrt für Europa”: Süddeutsche Zeitung, 22–3 December 2007: 1). An estimated “400 million EU citizens from 24 nations could now travel without passport control from the Baltic States to Portugal” (ibid.). xvi\n\nPreface to the Second Edition • xvii\n\nThe new borderless European Union was the result of the Schengen Process, which, after the ﬁrst set of agreements were implemented in 1985, had itself historically stretched from the Old Europe to the New. Many Old EU States signed the Schengen agreement only tentatively, displaying the mistrust for neighboring states and the reliance on ﬁrm borders that had dominated European politics for centuries. By the late 1990s, after further assurance of ﬂexibility in the Schengen Process in Amsterdam in 1997–98, the Old EU states recognized the value of open borders, open trade, and open tourism. The incorporation of East European nations into the European nations to expand the EU to twenty-seven states was another matter, for their borders, particularly with Russia and Turkey, still remained a bulwark for Europe and a deterrent against the ﬂow of cheap laborers and refugees or stateless peoples from and across Eastern Europe. All this changed at midnight on 21 December 2007. Within a few months, on 30 March 2008, the same border restrictions were lifted at all EU airports and all harbors. The jubilation for the New Europe’s oneness would once again grow in volume. European nationalism has changed dramatically since the ﬁrst edition of this book. The borders of the European Union have expanded, now including twenty-seven nations, and the attempts to expand them even farther—especially to include Croatia, Turkey, and Ukraine—have intensiﬁed. Economic and educational reform has accelerated, and the Euro has become one of the most powerful currencies in the world, and the Bologna Reforms are a fact of European educational life. Intra-European multiculturalism, particularly the growing presence of East Europeans in West European service industries, is now a reality. In the seven years from 2004 until 2011, the emerging “New Europe” I had projected in the ﬁrst edition has become a reality in the second edition. In 2011 even more audibly than in 2004, music accompanies the sea change we now recognize as the New Europe. It is in the music of the New Europe that we hear the voices bringing about a rapidly changing European nationalism. Whereas “transition” and “music in transition” were the slogans one heard at the time I was writing the ﬁrst edition, it is clear now that we are in a period I should like to call “post-transition.” In transition, musical change was teleological, largely in a direction away from the Old Europe. With the symbolic distance of a generation since 1989 now achieved, musical change in post-transition is multidirectional. As I did in the preface of the ﬁrst edition, I begin the second edition by reﬂecting upon the ways European borders have been redeﬁned rather than redrawn, the political and military reality of the many centuries of European nationalism leading up to the twentyﬁrst century. As we see throughout the present book, national borders have historically generated anxiety. Wars were fought to claim and reclaim them; they more often excluded than included. Few borders have been as extensive and impermeable as those between Eastern and Western Europe which were opened by the Schengen Process on 21 December 2007. Architecturally and metaphorically, these borders extended “the Wall,” in other words the Berlin Wall and the thousands of kilometers of borders that prevented passage between the nations of a divided Europe, that is, until the Fall of the Wall on 8 November 1989, which in turn unleashed the events that led to the era of the New Europe. The ﬁrst edition examined the role of borders in unifying Europe through a consideration of the metaphors accruing to an earlier sea change: the introduction on 1 xvii\n\nxviii • Preface to the Second Edition\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 2 3 4 5\n\nJanuary 2002 of the Euro as a common European currency for most member states of the European Union. The designers of the Euro had cleverly displayed borders on the banknotes, with a portal or gateway on the front and a bridge on the back, each denomination marking a new era in European history. Classical Roman architecture graced the ﬁveEuro banknote, with abstract modernist architecture on the 500-Euro banknote. As historically authentic as the architecture of border crossing on Euro banknotes seemed to be, each portal or bridge was imaginary. It occupied no single place; it provided passage across no river or border that really existed. The Euro symbolized a New Europe without borders, with a unity yet to be realized. The extension of the Schengen Process into Eastern Europe effectively completed the process of opening borders that the symbols of a uniﬁed currency set in motion, and it is for that reason the events of 21 December 2007 metaphorically replace those of 1 January 2002 as the ethnographic moment providing the historical threshold for the second edition. The pair of epigraphs that open this preface also tell the tale of a European nationalism in which the old and the new dovetail in the ethnographic present (Burnett 2008). Thirteen years after the death of Francisco Franco in 1975, who had led Spain as a fascist dictator since 1936, Spain was about to have lyrics again for its national anthem, the melody for which (“The Royal March”) dates from the eighteenth-century rule of King Carlos III. The winning entry, chosen by a jury from more than 7,000 entries, stems from the pen of Paulino Cubero, an unemployed worker with no previous record of writing nationalist song lyrics. “Long Live Spain!”, as the second epigraph’s critical response from Josep Ramoneda, the Director of the Center for Contemporary Culture in Barcelona, unsurprisingly revealed, had its fair share of detractors. Ramoneda observed the obvious about the conﬂuence of the old and new. Most national anthems project images of the nation that are interchangeable with other nations; many national anthems sound alike; a few really do use the same melodies, such as “God Save the King/Queen” (see Chapter 4). The second verse of the new Spanish hymn (Long live Spain! / From the green valleys / To the vast sea, / A hymn of brotherhood) will have a familiar ring for most Americans, but no less for Europeans, who are accustomed to celebrating expansive landscapes in their national songs (see Chapter 3). If the unexceptional character of Spain’s new anthem were not obvious enough, Josep Ramoneda reduced it to what he believes his readers will regard as the lowest common denominator of popular European musical nationalism, the Eurovision Song Contest. In the search for the absent lyrics of a new Spanish anthem, what could be worse than sounding like the rest of Europe? The removal of national borders in the New Europe, musical no less than political, has by no means erased nationalism. The absence of borders may instead heighten anxiety— about allowing those outside the nation unencumbered entrance into it, about sounding like the rest of Europe. Such nationalist anxieties may be assuming new forms in the New Europe, but they also reﬂect the role of history, even in its postmodern and posttransition forms in the New Europe. Perhaps no condition of European identity refuses to give up its entrenchment in the past more than does nationalism. Music, moreover, affords remarkably powerful ways of clinging to the past and of providing the historical narrative of nationalism to which each transition in the ethnographic present gives voice. The Schengen Process notwithstanding, European nationalism refuses to go away. The xviii\n\nPreface to the Second Edition • xix\n\nconﬂuence of music and nationalism at borders, across borders, and within borders has made a New Europe that fully takes its place in the history of the present. My decision to employ methodological conﬂuence—history and ethnography—to write about music and nationalism in the history of the present proved to complicate the revision of this book for the second edition. There is disjuncture and dissonance in the conﬂuence of past and present, growing from the assumption that one changes and the other does not. Second editions, particularly soon after the ﬁrst edition, more commonly honor the pastness of the past, and their authors address the presentness of the present through a new preface that accounts for the changes that marked the years connecting publication dates. In my discussions with Michael Bakan and Constance Ditzel, I considered the more traditional path of preparing the second edition, recognizing that it would provide the path of least resistance. Eventually, however, I came to realize that the second edition would be less responsible if, in fact, I avoided resistance. Too many Europeans had set too many changes in motion to state apologetically that they were irrelevant to the history of the present. At the end of a generation, the New Europe was entirely different from the transition of its adolescence only six years ago. The New Europe enjoyed a new global presence that was possible because of the conditions of its wholeness (e.g., NATO forces in Afghanistan). The divisiveness of the “Other Europe” that I examine in Chapter 1, however, had demonstrably spread, with new nations asserting and gaining independence. The measurement of Europeanness expressed through nations and nationalism has grown exponentially in the past six years: the number of member states in virtually every category—the European Union, NATO, and the Eurovision Song Contest—have doubled and show no signs of abating. In revising and writing the second edition of this book, I have taken considerable pains to account for the changes in Europe and in my engagement with music and nationalism. Several chapters are substantially rewritten, especially the preface, epilogue, and framing chapters. The ethnographic moments that locate examples in time and place, too, now come from my own research during the past few years. My intent has not been to throw out the examples from the past, but rather to connect these to the present, enhancing their capacity to narrate a history of the present. New illustrations and references to my ﬁeldwork enter the text regularly, though I have decided to retain the same set of recorded examples for the CD, even if it would have been possible to include new ﬁeldwork or replace examples performed by my own cabaret ensemble, the New Budapest Orpheum Society, with those from our two new CDs or performances. The addition of Chapter 7 reﬂects new thinking about distinctions between New Europeans who are nationless and those of multiple nations, distinctions increasingly signiﬁcant in the era of posttransition. Ample evidence for the explosion of literature and changing perspectives on the conﬂuence of music and nationalism in the New Europe will be found in the citations and bibliography, both extensively updated. The change in the title of the new edition is meant to signal the sweeping changes for which the book now attempts to account. The ethnomusicological engagement with the New Europe—my own, but also that of colleagues across the ﬁeld—has also grown exponentially since the ﬁrst edition. I regularly conduct ﬁeldwork and teach in Europe, holding even a position at the Hochschule für Musik und Theater in Hannover, Germany. To some degree, my ﬁeldwork sustains earlier ethnographic work (e.g., projects on Jewish music and pilgrimage), but in other ways I xix\n\nxx • Preface to the Second Edition\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 2 3 4 5\n\nhave used new types of ﬁeldwork to open new perspectives on the conﬂuence of music and nationalism in Europe (e.g., intensive ﬁeldwork at the European Song Contest itself, and new ethnographic work in Europe’s Muslim communities). Even more critical to our encounter with the music of post-transition Europe, I am not alone; quite the contrary, there has been a return to Europe in ethnomusicology, and the second edition has beneﬁted enormously from the collective voices accompanying that return. Europe has not always lent itself easily to ethnomusicological examination as a single global region distinguished by cultural unity or a uniﬁed history. Indeed, one of ethnomusicology’s paradigmatic shifts in the mid-twentieth century, which was in many ways crucial for shaping its modern identity as a scholarly discipline, was a turn away from Europe. Much, if not most, previous scholarly attention mustered for what was then called Vergleichende Musikwissenschaft, or “comparative musicology,” took European music as the yardstick for measuring all other musics of the world. The historical processes of European music, say, the belief that music becomes more complex as history unfolds and societies develop, were used to impose notions of civilization on other cultural areas. European concepts and categories of music were applied to other music cultures, and European musical scholars accompanied colonial armies and Christian missionaries as they spread about the globe discovering “folk music,” the pride of a European metaphysics of authenticity. By the end of the Second World War and the onset of the postcolonial disintegration of European military and political dominance of the rest of the world, European concepts for measuring the world’s musics were exposed as threadbare, not just for so-called non-Western music but also for European music itself. European ethnomusicologists began increasingly to turn inward, to their own regional and, especially, historical traditions, and Europeanist ethnomusicology devolved into a constellation of national institutions, many espousing nationalist agendas. With the second edition of this book, even more than in the ﬁrst edition, I return to Europe as a whole, that is, as a cultural and musical area that deserves our attention for what it is as much as for what it once was. The debates and ideological issues unleashed by the introduction of the Euro as a common European currency (see the Preface of the ﬁrst edition) are not anachronistic symptoms of a continent in cultural death throes but signs of cultural vitality and the ongoing struggle to re-imagine Europe as a region with contemporary global signiﬁcance. In 2010, the Euro is indisputably one of the strongest currencies in the world, especially after the beginning of worldwide recession in 2008, and it has largely succeeded in providing new ﬁnancial and cultural glue for Europe, achieving some measure of the need to heal the wounds remaining from a century when Europe’s internal and colonial struggles were devastating for most of the world’s peoples. More important than whether the Euro engenders European unity is whether it draws attention to the ways in which wholeness might be achieved at some level. It is to determine just how music symbolizes that wholeness, and more actively contributes to its formation and maintenance, that the history of the present in the two editions of this book examines the ways in which music and nationalism interact to make modern Europe. These two foci—music and nationalism—are powerfully implicated in Europe’s past and in the shaping of its future. Approaching Europe as a cultural and musical whole is a daunting task for the ethnomusicologist. Does one write a volume that is representative in some way, giving xx\n\nPreface to the Second Edition • xxi\n\nequal coverage to as many nations and musical cultures as possible? Or does one, in contrast, plead for the special role that certain types of music and musicians, say, folk music or nationalist composers, play in the construction of the nation? Does one aim for the semblance of an all-encompassing approach, or does one admit to the necessary compromises and state one’s disclaimers from the beginning? Frankly, my own approach might be described as “none of the above.” Instead, I am adopting and adapting ethnomusicological approaches that grow from historical discourses about Europe’s wholeness and respond to contemporary debates about Europe’s unity. By focusing on both music and nationalism, I approach Europe as a historian and an ethnographer. As with other volumes in the Routledge Focus on World Music Series, Music, Nationalism, and the Making of the New Europe is shaped by an on-the-ground encounter with musicians and music cultures and reveals the methodological pitfalls and potential that accompany ethnography. From the outset, it is necessary to recognize that no ethnomusicologist can undertake ﬁeldwork across an entire continent. Clearly, I know some parts of Europe better than others, and my familiarity with repertories and the contexts of music-making is stronger in some European nations than in others. The challenge of music ethnography is not one of whether the ﬁeldworker has spent any time in Portugal or Latvia—I have in the former but not in the latter—or if the Iberian Peninsula receives the same amount of space in the ethnography as do the Balkans. The ﬁeldwork experiences that lead to a book that takes Europe as a whole as its topic are different, indeed radically different, from local ethnographies, which are in-depth and long term in a single place. To illustrate why this is so, I might schematically sketch the ethnographic work upon which I have drawn for the present book: • • • • • • • • • •\n\n•\n\nintensive studies of European Jewish communities, beginning in 1982; collection and analysis of European folk songs, beginning in the mid-1970s; community-based studies of folk religion and religious revival since 1989; ethnographic study of Muslim communities in Europe since 2005; participant-observation on six major foot pilgrimages, accompanied by numerous ethnographies of shrines, from the late 1980s to the present; ﬁeldwork at urban sites of street music throughout Europe, beginning in 1989; in-depth studies of the multicultural border region of Burgenland, beginning in 1990; ﬁeld trips to the Carpathian Mountains of Romania, 1996, 1998, and 2008; diaspora studies of European ethnic traditional music in North America, ongoing from the mid-1970s until the present; integration of European folk, popular, and classical traditions into my own musical performance in the central European community of Israel, button-box accordion studies in the mid-1990s, establishment and artistic direction of European Jewish cabaret ensemble, the New Budapest Orpheum Society, and international performances of works from the Holocaust with Christine Wilkie Bohlman; popular-music research in the institutions of European broadcasting and recording, with ﬁeldwork at the Eurovision in Kyiv (2005) and Belgrade (2008).\n\nThese ethnographic experiences may or may not cover enough European turf. Far more important for the consideration of a modern ethnomusicology and an ethnomusicology xxi\n\nxxii • Preface to the Second Edition\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 2 3 4 5\n\nof modernity is that these experiences arose from, and were responses to, a set of questions about music and culture that are not primarily connected to older notions of geography and identity. Rather than concerning themselves with musicians and musical life in villages or the performers of specialized repertories and genres, the new questions recognize that many of Europe’s musicians are on the move and that they freely incorporate new styles from the mass media. Rather than ﬁxing the language of authenticity, the new questions interpellate the troubled histories that the belief in authenticity has imposed on the culture of modernity, especially the destruction of the Holocaust and colonialism in the twentieth century. Ethnography and ﬁeldwork have been crucial in both editions of this book for another, very simple reason: it is impossible to listen to European music without encountering nationalism. Nationalism contributes fundamentally to the ontology of European music, that is, to music’s “ways of being” in Europe. However, I have avoided, assiduously so, stating that all European music is nationalistic. Much is, much is not, but that’s not the point. Surely some European musicians have distanced themselves from nationalism, say, composers of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries who strove for what they imagined to be autonomy in music. In quite different ways, there are nationless musicians (see Chapter 6) who skirt the borders of national style because of the real physical violence it might bring upon them. But even here, that is, even in the conscious attempts to move away from national identity in music, the specter of nationalism haunts modern practices of folk, popular, and classical music, and that specter travels under the name of “Europe.” In a very real, practical sense, it is because of that specter that nationalism shapes the ethnographic ﬁeld in which we encounter European music today. The musical encounters upon which I have drawn in shaping the book have not only been ethnographic. Since my ﬁrst studies of musical practices, owing a large measure of their identity to Europe, I have consistently worked with archival and historical sources. In particular, I have approached the music of Europe at the intersection of and through the interaction with oral and written traditions. Discovering and collecting musics transmitted orally in the late twentieth century, I have traced tradition through written sources to document history with as much detail as possible. My concern for historical processes shaped from the oral–written nexus has taken me to more archives than many ethnomusicologists. If my ethnographic and historical projects often intersect, they also lead me, often insistently, to projects such as this book on nationalism and music, in which diachronic and synchronic approaches, history and ethnography, past and present, are just as insistently forged together. The archives in which I have worked are sometimes national and international, for example, the Deutsches Volksliedarchiv in Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany, or the Jewish Music Research Centre at the Jewish National and University Library in Jerusalem. Written sources also occupy regional and local institutions, such as the city and village records that I have visited and revisited in the border regions between Central and Eastern Europe. At even deeper community and personal levels, the research leading to this book has depended on the ways in which musicians and the sites in which they perform—choral ensembles and public stages, dance bands and synagogues, village entrepreneurs and the festivals—have shared with me the evidence that allows me to connect their pasts to the changing landscapes of European nationalism. Nationalism xxii\n\nPreface to the Second Edition • xxiii\n\ncannot, I believe, extricate itself from music history any more than from European history as a whole. The whole of Europe can only be approached through its parts; indeed, by gathering fragments that do not so much yield a more complete picture of the whole as provide new and unexpected perspectives on the whole. It may well be that Europe has always been approached in this way, with fragments representing the whole. Ancient and modern travelers—Caesar writing his Gallic Wars, the Christian diplomats who wrote of their travels into the Ottoman Balkans, the youngest generation of travel writers journeying into Eastern Europe since the fall of communism—assembled images of Europe as viewed from the roads and paths, images that allowed them to re-imagine the encounters of those who had passed before. Like the mariner’s map charted almost entirely from the ship passing along coastal waters, the whole emerges from the perspective of the journey itself, and it is precisely the whole that does emerge: it was the mariner’s map, ultimately, that ﬁrst brought entire continents into view. The crucial issue I have repeatedly encountered as my research has led me in search of fragments has been one of experiencing Europe on the move, not as a static, bounded continent of discrete nations, but of constant cultural movement and shifting cultures. The nationalism we witness through encounter, therefore, accompanies a long history of complex multiculturalism and a mixing and subaltern resistance to the hegemony of the nation-state. If the new edition couples music and nationalism to forge a view of New Europe as a whole, it also depends on the historical centrality of cosmopolitanism. Europe is a culture of cities, and city culture is crucial to European identities, not least among them, national identities. It is not by rhetorical accident that historians begin discussions of European history with the “city-state” and end with the “nation-state.” The city consolidates the nation, but it also provides the geographical conditions that invite the most extensive cultural mix; it supports the institutions central to the state yet requires the constant ingathering of immigrants from the provinces and beyond to run the institutions. As an exporter of colonialism and empire, Europe came to depend on the city in everchanging ways. The spread of European culture to its own peripheries was made possible by routes that connected nodes provided by cities, be they the Hanseatic cities, such as Bergen or Königsberg (today, Kaliningrad), that imported Early Modernism to northern Europe or the Habsburg imperial cities, such as Kraków and Czernowitz, that transplanted the Baroque to Eastern Europe. As a ﬁnal element in the cosmopolitan mix of European nationalism, the city is home to the nationless and to peoples of multiple nations, not just the new immigrants or the guest workers, but also ethnic, racial, and religious groups consciously excluded from the state, perhaps by denial of land-owning privileges, perhaps by denial of citizenship rights, often by both. European Jewish culture and European Jewish music are perhaps the most obvious case of the dissonant relation between cosmopolitan nationalism and urban culture. In the twenty-ﬁrst century, Muslim Europe has also emerged as a culture of the city and the competition for space and community. Historically, the European city was both utopian and dystopian for its nationless peoples; the city was the symbol of the nation’s greatest potential and most immediate danger. We ﬁnd the music of the European nation not only in the center but also at its many peripheries and borders, and in the course of the research for this book, I have frequently xxiii\n\nxxiv • Preface to the Second Edition\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 2 3 4 5\n\nplied boundary regions in order to listen more acutely. The boundary crossing that ethnography and encounter make possible also has a parallel in the approaches I bring to European music itself. In short, I take all musics of the New Europe as the topic of this book, and in this way the book offers a conscious departure from most studies of music and nationalism. Most commonly, scholars seek the national in music in one genre or repertory of another, in the overwhelming majority of studies, either in art music or in folk music. There are reasons for such approaches. From a global perspective, that music which we call “European music,” particularly in historical, literate contexts, provides the paradigm for “art music,” that is, elite traditions. Art music depends to some extent on national institutions, and it frequently furthers discourses about national history, which accordingly generate music histories that elevate art music to “classical music;” in other words, to an emblem of a classical, authentic past. Those who forge and maintain national discourses insist upon owning their great composers, competing for them as if they were the musical citizens of several nations (e.g., Chopin, Liszt, or Arvo Pärt). Much of the attention given to nationalism and music, it follows, has been devoted to art music, especially traditions of national opera, or to composers who plumb folk music in a small nation that wishes to resist the hegemony of a larger nation or empire. That other invention of European musical discourse, “folk music,” provides the counterpart for identifying and exploiting the national in music. Folk music becomes the property of the nation and the language of national discourse, but only after it is collected and anointed as a canon, the product of age and the icon of agelessness, as a manifestation of the classical. In the New Europe, art and folk music retain their importance as discourses of the national center, but I turn also, indeed, above all, to the musics that proliferate at the national peripheries. I examine popular and religious, mediated and authentic musics; I regard the ephemeral as no less crucial for shaping nationalism than the classical; I challenge the reader to consider music that resists nationalism no less than music that celebrates the nation-state. Indeed, I exclude no music from the possibility of serving as a source for national identity. More to the point, I ﬁnd nationalism in music at the borders between repertories, genres, and practices. These are the sites of hybridity and contested identities; it is here that the landscapes inhabited by displaced and nationless peoples take shape; it is at the borders between musics and nations that the pressing battles over identity are most viciously fought. Music mobilizes the nation and provides a language for its invention. Ultimately, it may well be the true measure of music’s signiﬁcance for nationalism that it provides so many and such ﬂuid contexts for the nation itself. Ethnography, encounter, and border crossing also raise fundamental questions about competition and confrontation, both of which appear repeatedly in the book. At one level, I examine musical competition in very literal ways. Chapter 1 opens, for example, with a competition, the Eurovision Song Contest. The Eurovision is a mass-mediated event that takes place on a musical stage to which all Europeans connected to the media of the European Broadcasting Union have access. Throughout Europe, there are countless competitions for composers and chamber musicians, military and minority ensembles, folk musicians and rock bands, and in these competitions musicians xxiv\n\nPreface to the Second Edition • xxv\n\ncompete against each other, often to gain the privilege of representing the nation, that is, their nation. I consider the ways in which competitive frameworks generate and channel movements that rally new and different genres to represent the nation, such as the choralism that permeates the Celtic Fringe along the Atlantic and the Baltic states of the northeast. Most of these competitions culminate in international contests in which musicians from one nation compete against those of another, often before international television audiences. At another level, I consider competition in more metaphorical terms. The myths and narratives of folk music may represent competition between cultures and nations at prehistorical moments, when the Niebelungen were not yet German, and the epics of the Kosovo Cycle described struggles over the lands of the former Yugoslavia. Modern competitions, too, provide contexts for musical practices that symbolize the nation and the desire to demonstrate superiority. Music, such as national anthems, is inevitably present when nations compete on the athletic ﬁeld. War and colonialism, as violent competitions between nations and empires, engender musics that reproduce military competition—for example, in the marches or bagpipe repertories that lead nations to war. The metaphorical presence of music at competitions of all kinds notwithstanding, the fundamental point is that music gives metaphor speciﬁc functions, which in turn assume concrete forms. Competition, in most basic terms, transforms the national into the nationalist (compare Chapters 3 and 4). Nationalism is a process that is on the move; in transition and in post-transition, musical change in the New Europe is equally on the move. Thus, when we experience nationalism in the swirling constellation of musics staged in the name of the nation, we are observing it in dramatically shifting stages of transition. Music enhances the mobility that allows nationalism to ﬁnd lodging in so many different places on the national landscape. Because it is always changing, nationalism has contributed in many ways to the making of the New Europe. I emphasize the process of making as more construction than construct, that is, as dynamic, creative, activist, and also politically assertive. The New Europe, too, is constantly changing and responding to the events of the past and present. We may well be able to locate the beginnings of the history of the New Europe— to a large extent that was the purpose of the ﬁrst edition of this book—but the process of making the New Europe is ongoing; indeed, intensely so as its ﬁrst generation passes into future generations, in which nationalism and music will continue to intersect to make the New Europe. As I trace the conﬂuence of music and nationalism through the historical counterpoint of the book, I deliberately avoid treating nationalism as a single, monolithic force that is somehow “out there.” My approach therefore differs from many studies of nationalism because it does not regard nationalism as exceptional: it is not a question of nationalism that exists or does not exist, that one nation turns on and another off. Nationalism is not the marker of some musics while remaining entirely absent from others; it does not simply become extreme at some historical moments but recede at others. Nationalism has many different shades, and by considering many different genres, repertories, and practices of music we attune ourselves to those shades. We experience—and hear— nationalism in the many musics that together give the New Europe a wholeness that has xxv\n\nxxvi • Preface to the Second Edition\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 2 3 4 5\n\nhistorically been hegemonic and fragmented, that has forged cultural cooperation and fostered competition, and that has struggled for the very unity made possible when national borders are opened to facilitate free passage as a means of maintaining the nations those borders at once separate and join together.

There are the nations whose music entices and fascinates; there are the nations whose nationalism earns admiration and contempt. Early travels generate lifelong passions, and the chance concert or a recording discovered by accident unleashes an unstoppable desire to collect and learn everything there is to learn, and then some. Fulbright and IREX fellowships (if we are American) take us to other nations, and they do so in the guise of American nationalism (even if we are not American). Our passports are ﬁlled with visas that come only after commitment to respect for the laws and cultures of other nations. The musical relationships we develop with nations and nationalism are positive in the best of times, but there are many times when nations and nationalism intervene to make foreignness an unpleasant liability. For most ethnomusicologists, the early encounters with nations and nationalism follow them for many years to come, often throughout their careers. It’s a love–hate relationship, which means that it cannot simply be dismissed. My own encounters with nations and nationalism have been no exception to the rule. The moment I made the decision to embark on a career in ethnomusicology, I confronted the need to chart the world’s musics in one way or another, and the map that settled out after I followed paths across various musical landscapes was scored with the ciphers of nations. It was also scarred with the remnants of nationalism. How to sort all this out? How to make sense out of the musics of ethnic Americans (as we called them in the 1970s) and the German-Jewish community of Israel (as I called it in the 1980s)? How to perceive the ways music gave voice to the residents of a New Europe (as we began to call it in the 1990s)? How to negotiate the borders of nations whose forms of nationalism I questioned and ultimately might criticize?\n\nxxvii\n\nxxviii • Acknowledgments\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 2 3 4 5\n\nI do, in fact, have answers to these questions, answers that provide the content of these “Acknowledgments.” I was fortunate to learn early on that the encounter with nations and nationalism was most meaningful when most human and personal. My journeys to Europe—for research, for lectures, for teaching, for pleasure—are by now literally countless. Those to whom I owe thanks—for advice, for sage wisdom, for criticism, for lessons learned the hard way—are also countless. I’ve met so many musicians in so many places; I’ve joined with so many pilgrims on sacred journeys to their shrines; I’ve knocked on so many doors in search of someone who might have the key to a synagogue or have special insight into the boundary regions between past and present; to colleagues throughout Europe; I’ve given lectures and interviews and copies of my work, hoping that there still might be an extra ticket for a dress rehearsal at the Eurovision Song Contest; and I’ve taught so many students, whose lives have become emblems of New Europeanness. I’d like to thank them all personally, but space won’t permit. There are two measures of appreciation that I do, however, want to offer. First, there is this book itself, which would have been impossible without them. Second, they should know that my engagement with music and nationalism in Europe is ongoing; the lessons they taught me are still a vital part of my life and work as an ethnomusicologist, and the second edition, which marks so many changes in Europe and in my own scholarship, bears witness to the inﬂuences from those who accompanied me toward the end of a generation in the New Europe. I am not a European, and even with the second edition of this book I hesitate to allow anyone to convince me that I am a Europeanist. I am an outsider—a non-European, with no ethnic, national, or nationalist ties to Europe. Even my two academic connections to Europe—as a corresponding fellow of the British Academy and as honorary professor at the Hochschule für Musik und Theater Hannover—are reserved for non-Europeans, or more to the national point, non-British and non-German scholars. None of the musics that I discuss in this book is my own, even the several styles, genres, and repertories that I play as a musician. Still, had I not found various homes in Europe, the book would have been very different. My temporary homes in Europe are several, but those who made me feel at home, even temporarily, are legion. My ﬁrst European home, as this book amply makes clear, was the German Folk-Song Archive (Deutsches Volksliedarchiv) in Freiburg im Breisgau, where I learned about German (and Jewish and Alsatian and Yiddish and Austrian and Turkish—so much for the DVA’s nationalism) music from Barbara Boock, Jürgen Dittmar, Ali Osman Öztürk, and Michaela Zwenger. Most of all, Freiburg has become a home because of Otto Holzapfel and Inge Holzapfel, who so brilliantly and warmly merge friendship and collegial relationships. Since the ﬁrst edition of this book, my homes in Berlin have multiplied to include the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, where I have been welcomed by Christian Kaden and Hermann Danuser, and the Phonogramm-Archiv of the Ethnologisches Museum, where Lars-Christian Koch, his staff, and his family have made me and my family feel so welcome that, in fact, we have moved into an additional home in Berlin. My second home in Europe has been and will be Vienna, most of all because it is a city where one can feel at home but never be at home, as a foreigner. Friendships and intellectual exchange, therefore, become all the more intense. Home in Vienna became the Institut für Volksmusikforschung und Ethnomusikologie and the Institut für xxviii\n\nAcknowledgments • xxix\n\nMusikwissenschaft, the ﬁrst at the Universität für Musik und darstellende Kunst, the second at the University of Vienna. Faculty, staff, and researchers at those institutions, especially Ardian Ahmedaja, Oskár Elschek, Franz Födermayr, Gerlinde Haid, Ursula Hemetek, Emil Lubej, and Michael Weber were and are marvelous colleagues. Roland Mahr and Rudolf Pietsch have been far more than colleagues—not only friends but mentors who drew me into music at Europe’s center. Almost a decade after her death, I still mourn the passing of Franziska Pietsch-Stockhammer, whose gentle voice speaks to me so powerfully of what Europe must be. Other temporary homes have allowed me to draw closer to Europe. My colleagues in the International Council for Traditional Music Study Group for the Anthropology of Music of the Mediterranean, so graciously stewarded after the passing of Tullia Magrini by Marcello Sorce Keller and Ruth Davis, join me as we consider Europe from the shores encountered by its Others in Africa and Asia. In recent years, I have visited London and Newcastle upon Tyne with some frequency, in part for conversations with UK colleagues such as Paul Attinello, Stefan Berger, Michael Berkowitz, Ian Biddle, Julie Brown, Stefano Castelvecchi, Martin Clayton, Nicholas Cook, Victoria Cooper, Ruth Davis, John Deathridge, Byron Dueck, Thomas Hilder, Alex Knapp, Laura Leante, Richard Middleton, Paul Nixon, Goffredo Plastino, Tina K. Ramnarine, Henry Stobart, and, once again, Martin Stokes. With new and renewed European invitations to Berlin, Copenhagen, Newcastle upon Tyne, Vienna, and Zagreb, it seems that I’ll be a visitor for years to come. I doubt, nonetheless, that I’ll settle into domestic comfort, for so much of what Europe is for me lies along its borders. Again and again, I take my research to the boundary regions, where I encounter the soft underbelly of European nationalism. In Burgenland, I traverse the borders with Walter Burian and Gabi Burian, also with Roland Mahr, Martina Blaschek, and Sepp Gmasz. Whether Ute Bosbach and Hansrainer Bosbach really travel with me to geographical borders is not the question; generation after generation—four and counting—their German family is part of my own. My Carpathian sojourners make an extended appearance in Chapter 7, but let me here again acknowledge Rudolf Pietsch, Tamás Repiszky, and Roland Mahr. It is in Romania that a Grenzgänger of a different sort lives and works, when he is not in Chicago. Together with my Romanian friend and colleague, Marin Marian Ba˘las¸a, I have so many sojourns lying before me. Historically, the University of Chicago has been friendly toward one of the “two Europes” I discuss in Chapter 1 but not toward the other. Western civilization, great books, and European art music have been standard fare, while those displaced by the spread of empires, oral tradition, and folk and popular music have been treated often with distaste. The situation has shifted dramatically during my twenty-four years at Chicago, and this book bears witness to that sea change. I am indebted to many for the change, especially my many student-mentors whose thinking always challenges me to look to the future. With her special human touch and seemingly generations of experience in southeastern Europe, Nada Petkovicˇ taught me to hear and, now perhaps, to learn from the epics of the Balkans. I have been extremely fortunate to beneﬁt from the watchful eye of my unpaid research assistant, fellow ﬁeldworker, coauthor, and denizen of modern Warsaw, Andrea F. Bohlman; I now follow her journeys into the heart of the New Europe and learn in ways I always hoped I might.

One does not visit and revisit Europe as often as I have without the generosity of fellowships and foundations. I gratefully acknowledge and thank the American Academy in Berlin, Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (Research Fellowships in 1990–91 and 2005 and Transatlantic Cooperation Grants in 1993–96 and 2008–11), the National Endowment for the Humanities (Summer Stipend and Fellowship for University Teachers), Council for the International Exchange of Scholars (Fulbright Guest Professorship at the University of Vienna), Internationales Forschungszentrum Kulturwissenschaften in Vienna, DAAD (Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst), and IREX (International Research and Exchanges Board). The ﬁrst edition of the book appeared in the ABC-CLIO “World Music Series,” which was the brainchild of Alicia Merritt, and she wisely turned to Michael Bakan as an ethnomusicologist with the appropriate vision and the necessary hard questions to make its potential so great. Had anyone else approached me to suggest an ethnomusicological monograph on some aspect of the whole of Europe, I’d surely have found it too daunting. It took Constance Ditzel, working with Michael Bakan, to convince me that the vertiginous change in the New Europe needed to be addressed in a new edition, and I thank them for including that edition in Routledge’s Focus on World Music series. Special thanks to Sarah Stone for her gracious and thoughtful copyediting, and to Denny Tek for her creative design for the book. Perhaps the ﬁrst edition raised more questions than it answered, but I still remain grateful and humbled for the honor bestowed on the ﬁrst edition when awarded the 2007 Derek Allen Prize for Musicology by the British Academy. Whenever I accomplish anything, it is because Andrea, Ben, and Christine were there with me. This book and the present edition are no exceptions. I’ve lost count of the times before the turn of the present century during which we spent a month, a summer, or a year in Europe together. As children, Andrea and Ben had to endure German and Austrian schools; they had to indulge their father in places where every language we spoke was foreign; they had to ride on my shoulders at circuses, parades, operas, and seemingly endless performances of nationalism. I never got tired, and perhaps they did not either, for both have made the New Europe part of their lives. For me they, too, symbolize the best of all that lies ahead. At every stage of preparing both editions of this book, Christine endured even more than the rest of us. If we were outsiders and foreigners, she bore the brunt of what that really meant. It’s for that reason, however, that she asked the hardest questions and became the keenest observer. Christine—always—was there, also during the extended period of serious illness that paralleled my work on the ﬁrst edition and in our musical journeys throughout Europe in search of the meaning of the music from the Holocaust that we perform together and that reﬂect upon her so brilliantly in the dedication of both editions to her. Christine’s courage and love inspire this book once again, just as they have always inspired me—immer wieder.\n\nxxx\n\nNote on Translation and the Glossary\n\nAll translations, transliterations, and transcriptions are those of the author unless otherwise noted. Some translations appeared ﬁrst in translations into non-English languages other than the original, and these in turn served as an intermediary prior to the author’s translation into the English that appears in the book. Transliteration decisions emphasize consistency in the English spellings whenever possible, thus necessitating occasional adjustments when using contradictory rules. For the most part, English words that appear in the glossary are emboldened only when they ﬁrst occur in the text, though occasionally upon their second or even third occurrence, particularly if several chapters have intervened and if the word or concept is especially uncommon or important.\n\nxxxi\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 2 3 4 5 xxxii\n\nCHAPTER\n\n1\n\nMusic and Nationalism Why Do We Love to Hate Them?\n\nThe New Eurovision and the New Europe This year’s musical mash-up in Moscow . . . promises to be a more sober affair, with virtually all countries sending songs they feel have more credibility. . . . Welcome to the new world of Eurovision. (Osborne 2009) How different the world of Eurovision is at the beginning of the second edition of this book. And yet how uncannily the same. In the opening pages of the ﬁrst chapter and in my attempt to frame the book with musical metaphor from the ethnographic present of the 2002 Eurovision Song Contest, I regaled the reader with the revelatory rhetoric of an American Eurovision fan. That rhetoric depended on a litany of what I at the time represented as the new: the 47th Eurovision Song Contest (ESC, or simply Eurovision) marked what I predicted would be a “watershed” (Bohlman 2004: 1). It was the ﬁrst time the Eurovision would take place in the New Europe, in Tallinn, Estonia, which had been the ﬁrst Eastern European nation to win the ESC since the Velvet Revolution twelve years earlier, which had followed upon its own national Singing Revolution during the preceding decades. The number of nations sending competitors to the Tallinn Eurovision had grown to twenty-four, expanding the musical boundaries of the European Union (EU) and the cultural boundaries of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), whose national broadcasting networks were responsible for organizing the national competitions yielding ESC entries. On one spectacular evening, May 24, 2002, Europeans would watch as European nations would represent themselves almost entirely to themselves; that is, to television audiences in other European nations. In 2002, the ESC remained a largely European spectacle of music and nationalism, so much so that, in the ﬁrst edition of this book, I felt it necessary to provide the reader with a brief sketch of the ESC, stretching as a narrative arc across the most critical years of the Cold War. 1\n\n2 • Music and Nationalism\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 2 3 4 5\n\nTo the extent that the framework the Eurovision provided for the ﬁrst edition also implied a prediction of sorts—2002 in Tallinn would be the beginning of something really new—it did not miss its mark. By the end of the ﬁrst decade of the twenty-ﬁrst century, both the Eurovision Song Contest with forty-three participants and the European Union with twenty-seven member nations were ﬁrmly implanted in Eastern Europe. Newness increased exponentially, and there was no longer any doubt that the New Europe was here to stay, and that its constituent nations would be around in full force to celebrate the coming of age of its ﬁrst generation. The discourse about the musical and political underpinnings of the Eurovision that was emerging in the immediate wake of the new millennium had itself spread globally. Live EBU broadcasts were drawing massive audiences in Australia and China. North American awareness was heightened, and ESC Internet broadcasts connected the spectacle in Europe to the everyday worlds of Eurovision fans throughout the world. The juxtaposition of seriousness and silliness in the songs and the performances had even begun to generate a substantial body of scholarly analysis and academic interdisciplinarity (cf., e.g., Raykoff and Tobin 2007, and Tragaki 2011). Love it or hate it, the Eurovision has become a household word. We won’t stand this—no! Revolution is on! ’Cuz lies be the weapon of mass destruction! All together we’re one! All together we’re strong! God be my witness we’ve waited too long! (Greenjolly, “Razom nas bahato, nas ne podolaty!” / “Together We Are Many, We Cannot Be Defeated,” 2005 Eurovision entry for Ukraine) In 2010, there are fewer who doubt that there is political signiﬁcance to the forms of nationalism that constitute the core of the Eurovision Song Contest, after the numerous watersheds during the years separating the editions of this book. In 2005, in the ﬁftieth anniversary year of the ESC, the competition took place in Kyiv against the backdrop of the Orange Revolution—the struggle over democratic voting in Ukraine that had brought Viktor Yushchenko to power only after massive street protests. Figuratively and literally, the Orange Revolution served as a visible stage for the new forms of the old nationalisms forming along the ﬁssures between East and West in Europe. The rhetoric of revolution asserted itself in competing songs, not only in the hip-hop entry from Ukraine’s Greenjolly, which substituted break-dancing for the usual Eurovision dance act (see Figure 1.1), but also in the overt symbolic gestures during performances (e.g., waving orange banners or proclaiming on stage that this was a moment of “rock ’n’ roll revolution”). On the streets, particularly at the sites of the Orange Revolution itself, such as the central Independence Square, thousands of Ukrainians gathered to watch the live broadcasts punctuated by their own headliners. The ﬁftieth Eurovision Song Contest in Kyiv seemingly bore witness to—and rather conveniently completed—the historical teleology that had crept into the opening chapter of the ﬁrst edition of the book. Music, history, and nationalism were gradually forming the triangulation that I was constructing to predict the New Europe as it fulﬁlled the 2\n\nMusic and Nationalism • 3\n\nFigure 1.1 Ukrainian ESC entry, Greenjolly, performing live at the 2005 Kyiv Eurovision Song Contest (photograph by Andrea F. Bohlman)\n\npromise of its ﬁrst generation. Already in Kyiv, however, there were very clear signs of teleological slippage. There was more than a little dissonance that threatened the triangulation. As I do throughout this book, I turn in the ﬁrst order to the music itself. The sympathy it inspired for the Orange Revolution notwithstanding, Greenjolly’s “Razom nas bahato, nas ne podolaty” failed to receive the support of many Eurovision voters, and it went down in ignominious defeat, at the end of the evening in twentieth place among the twenty-four contenders. There were surely musical reasons that might explain the failure to rally support from the televoting Eurovision fans around the continents. Hip-hop, whether African American or global in style, almost entirely fails to attract support in Eurovision voting. In its attempt to make the case for a speciﬁc political moment, moreover, Greenjolly avoided even the obvious Eurovision song formulae that would have afforded it musical familiarity. If music was to shape, reﬂect, or give identity to the nation, questions of audience and authenticity could simply not be ignored. And the tears are streaming, ﬂowing in vain, No name to the pain. We are waiting Only for the day that later would come.

It should not surprise us, then, that the Eurovision Song Contests upon which I draw for framing ethnographic moments in the present edition represent histories of the New Europe that differ from those predicted, if by implication, in the framing ethnographic moments of the ﬁrst edition. The New Europe has proved more complicated than the dreams of seamlessly reunifying East and West, and so too has the music. Whether one regarded the shift of the Eurovision to Eastern Europe during the ﬁrst decade of the twenty-ﬁrst century with trepidation or jubilation, the victory of Alexander Rybak for Norway in 2009 appeared to many as if it rerouted the history of the New Europe. Norway is not a member nation of the European Union, and its geographical and political position does not fall easily into the East–West schism of the Cold War. Its position in the New Europe remains that of a slightly ambivalent outlier. In the history of the Eurovision Song Contest, Norway has played the role of perennial loser and outsider even in comparison with its Scandinavian neighbors, whose fortunes are perhaps best symbolized by the most famous band in ESC history, ABBA. Symbolically, too, the Norwegian entry, “Fairytale,” exchanged history for myth and substituted folk music for popular music. The “new world of Eurovision” to which the epigraph of this chapter welcomes us was notable because it presumably resembled the old world. And yet, in the largest ﬁeld of Eurovision competitors ever (forty-three) and during a year of war between Eurovision member states (Russia and Georgia), “Fairytale” won with the largest tally of votes (387) in the history of the ESC (for a more extensive discussion of the national and musical politics leading to the 2009 ESC in Moscow, see the Epilogue to this book). Music makes the New Europe in many ways. Music joins with nationalism to represent the nation in many forms. In 2010, the history of the New Europe is no closer to resolving the conﬂicts and anxiety of the Old Europe than it was in 2004. Above all, the music of the New Europe, precisely because its diversity represents the diverse aspirations of the nationless peoples and people of multiple nations, of the Old Europeans and the New Europeans, of those at Europe’s center or plying the borders at its peripheries, is inseparable from the nationalism that makes the New Europe we encounter in this book.\n\nMusic, Nationalism, and “The Voices of the People in Songs” Song loves the masses, the combined voices of many: It requires the ear of the listener and a chorus of voices and all that is joyous. (Herder 1975 (1778–79): 167) A remarkably diverse cast of characters gathers on the stage of history to give voice to music and nationalism in the making of modern Europe. The Eurovision Song Contest, as we have just seen, requires not just hundreds of performers and thousands of organizers, but also millions, even hundreds of millions, of Europeans, and increasingly of audiences throughout the world, willing to gaze upon the musical performance of nations. The ESC, however, is hardly an isolated phenomenon. Nations are collectives, and music often musters a collective at the moment of performance. If music truly does shape the nation by resonating with what Johann Gottfried Herder, in the ﬁrst volume 4\n\nMusic and Nationalism • 5\n\never devoted to folk music and modern nationalism (Herder 1778–79), called the “voices of the people in songs,” then both quantity and volume combine forces to articulate the modern nation. On the eve of modernity, that is, in the Enlightenment of late eighteenthcentury Europe, it was not the music of the few but rather of the masses that sang of the nation in its most fully recognizable form. Discussions of music and nationalism most often focus on the elite or the marginal— in other words, the castes of composers and ethnic or racial outsiders whose music consciously or unconsciously represents the nation or challenges the nation. Nationalism in music, according to Carl Dahlhaus, one of the most inﬂuential music historians of the late twentieth century, is evident in the nebulous qualities of the nation, “the spirit of the people in musical sound” (Dahlhaus 1980: 101). In a magisterial survey of nationalism and music, Richard Taruskin expands upon Dahlhaus’s nineteenth-century and AustroGerman themes, extending them to Eastern Europe and to a more variegated range of ideologies that generate forms and repertories of musical expression, particularly in the twentieth century, among them colonialist nationalism, tourist nationalism, and neonationalism (Taruskin 2001). In this book, nationalism assumes much more down-to-earth forms, and the people who employ it to express national identities do so much more actively. It is their voices we hear, their actions we witness. They dance the folk dances and rally to the military marches. They join together in choruses, and they form communities of worshipers mobilized through song. Their songs ﬁll the volumes gathered by nineteenth-century collectors, and their votes determine the winners of competitions at twentieth-century folk festivals. They take songbooks on pilgrimages and to war in the twenty-ﬁrst century. Their spectatorship each May is fundamental to the overwhelming popularity of the Eurovision Song Contest. If we experience music and nationalism in the voices of the people, not just in their spirit, we also recast the ways in which music participates in the making of the New Europe. Just as there are more individual European people involved, so too are there more European musics. The question is not which genres or repertories are nationalist, but how musicians weave their own national identities in the many musics they create and reproduce. Nationalism no longer enters music only from the top, that is, from state institutions and ideologies, but may build its path into music from just about any angle, as long as there are musicians and audiences willing to mobilize cultural movement from those angles. In this book, I am far more often concerned with the multitude of angles than I am with the top-down trajectories that motivate most scholars to address European music and nationalism by considering operas, tone poems, and character pieces that borrow what they might imagine to be authentic languages from the nation’s people. Folk music, too, ﬁnds its way into discussions of music and nationalism, but again as a cultural artifact that is appropriated for the loftier purposes of representing the nation-state. It is the thesis of this book that we can experience nationalism in any music at any time. Music is malleable in the service of the nation not because it is a product of national and nationalist ideologies, but rather because musics of all forms and genres can articulate the processes that shape the state. Music can narrate national myths and transform them to nationalist histories. Music marks national borders, while at the same time 5\n\n6 • Music and Nationalism\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 2 3 4 5\n\nmobilizing those wishing to cross or dismantle borders. Music enhances the sacred qualities of the nation, and it can secularize religion so that it conforms to the state. There is, then, no single place to experience the interaction of music and nationalism. Quite deliberately, I have begun by examining a competition at which the national entrants perform popular music, probably the most frequently overlooked domain of nationalism in music, at least in Europe. The reader should be forewarned that the ESC is only the ﬁrst of many unexpected places to which I journey in this book. Already in the ﬁrst chapter, we make brief sojourns at street festivals and museums, and we listen to international anthems. These places of intersecting music and nationalism chart a complex musical and ideological landscape across Europe, a landscape that each chapter represents in different ways until, with the ﬁnal chapter, we encounter a New Europe that often staggers under the weight of its own nationalist heritage. At that point, our own ethnographic present, new musicians step in, combining music and nationalism to make a New Europe. Ethnography, encounter, and border crossing raise fundamental questions about competition and confrontation, both of which appear repeatedly in the book. At one level, I examine musical competition in very literal ways. I consider contests in which musicians compete against each other, often to represent the nation. In several chapters we examine the ways in which competitive frameworks generate choral movements. I also set the historical stage with the international contests, such as the Eurovision Song Contest, in which musicians from one nation compete against those of another. At another level, I consider competition in more metaphorical terms. The myths and narratives of folk music may represent competition between cultures and nations at prehistorical moments. Music, such as national anthems, may be present when nations compete on the athletic ﬁeld. Musical competition between nations may result from the different types of colonialism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Competition, in most basic terms, transforms the national into the nationalist. Finally, I turn frequently to competition because, though on its surface it is about those who “get into the nation,” it reveals a great deal about those who are marginalized or, even more critically, have been historically excluded. The people whose voices give rise to modern Europe’s songs have historically occupied a very crowded political and ideological landscape. Frequently, they have had to compete for land, a competition that often instigated border disputes, unleashed war, or spawned imperialism. Figuratively and literally, the competition for land in Europe also spills over into other forms of competition, not least among them the musical competitions that ﬁll the pages of this book. Sometimes, competition means that the voices of some people will drown out those of others; at other times, competition may provide a means for opposing voices to coexist; almost always, competitions provide ways of accommodating large numbers of people in times of national crisis or celebration. The competition, ﬁnally, is the musical and cultural event that levels the differences between the people of the nation. Class distinctions are not eliminated but perhaps put on hold, religious and sectarian conﬂicts subside, and the social gap between center and periphery is narrowed, all to make audible the voices of people in songs.\n\n6\n\nMusic and Nationalism • 7\n\nMusic between the Two Europes When we speak about Europe today and attempt to establish just how this great and famous continent came to be, we must not forget that there are two Europes. In addition to the classical West European, grandiose and museumized, historical and pathetic, Europe there lives a second Europe, humble and cowering in the corner, for centuries repressed at the peripheries. (Miroslav Krlezˇa in Wieser 2001: 6) Two Europes have historically competed for the music of the nation. The two Europes assume many forms, which in turn enhance the degree and ways in which they compete for the music of the nation. They may stretch across the same lands and rivers, but with dual claims of ownership sounded by songs in different languages and with different poetry (e.g., Central Europe in Andruchowytsch and Stasiuk 2004, and in Chapter 5 of this book). The general shapes and functions of the two nations, nonetheless, have certain attributes that make them recognizable wherever and whenever we encounter them. In their different ways they compete for music by yielding musical practices, repertories, and identities that are both national and nationalist. The ﬁrst Europe is the Europe of the whole. The names and labels given to the ﬁrst Europe draw attention to some aspects of wholeness. The ﬁrst Europe is foremost a continent with geographical unity. Its religious history, in practical and idealized forms, also demonstrates unity, principally as the product of Christianity. The ﬁrst Europe asserts itself through claims to a common culture at a continental level, be it more global, as in “Western Civilization,” or more bounded by Europe itself, as in “European art music,” which is for all intents and purposes also “Western art music.” The second Europe is the Europe of parts. The names and labels given to the second Europe stress the ways in which the parts do or do not ﬁt together. Unlike the unity of the ﬁrst Europe, geography parses the second Europe into regions and zones: east and west; north and south; Mediterranean and alpine; Nordic and Slavic; romance and Germanic. Civilization and culture also assume regional, often parochial, forms, which reﬂect a sense that competition for European history or music can produce winners and losers. Religion in the second Europe is more diverse. It splits into many more sects and denominations, many of which exhibit extensive intolerance, particularly at the borders at which religions have met and for which they have competed. Religious strife, much of it generated by Christianity’s claims to Europe, has repeatedly ripped apart the seams of the Balkans, transforming Southeastern Europe into the classic region of the second Europe. The adjective “European” is rarely explicit as a denominator of cultural practices in the parts of the second Europe, partly because of the desire to diminish indebtedness to other parts or to the ﬁrst Europe itself, as when the English claim that they are not really Europeans, or when Russians distance themselves from Eastern Europe. If the term “European” occurs rarely, one nonetheless ﬁnds frequent use of terms from the second Europe itself, such as “balkanization,” which in international parlance refers to conditions of dysfunctional divisiveness. The two Europes assume many other forms that, to greater and lesser degrees, reﬂect the distinction between a whole and parts. Economically, for example, there is a Europe that has uniﬁed mercantile and industrial strength, which has historically afforded it the 7\n\n8 • Music and Nationalism\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 2 3 4 5\n\nrole of the “First World.” All Europeans, even most Europeans, however, have not been the beneﬁciaries of such economic might, leaving them in the position of a “Fourth World.” The division between ﬁrst and fourth worlds produces other divisions— for example, between south and north, east and west. Europe’s compass distinctions, moreover, have been among the most persistent rubrics for separating the two Europes. To the west go attributes such as industrial might, colonial power, and, for our purposes in the present book, “Western music.” It is not that the same attributes are absent in the east, but there they fail to cohere, largely because of a persistent need to compete with the west for them. At the turn of our own century, from the twentieth to the twenty-ﬁrst, the differences between the two Europes seemed, if anything, more pronounced than ever. At the close of the ﬁrst decade of the century, cultural and political institutions functioning under the public rubric of “European” remain committed to supporting, even exacerbating, the existence of two Europes, often in the cause of unity. From its earliest formation as a post-Second World War trade and defense organization, the European Union has both supported and divided the continent. During the Cold War era, the European Union and its predecessor, the European Economic Community, represented the west but not the east, which was unifying in other ways, particularly the international socioeconomic alliances of communism. European unity failed to come swiftly to the European Union, and it is hardly surprising that reﬁning the processes of real unity today remains a highly contested political issue. In 1952 there were only six countries in the proto-EU, but even a half century later, at the time of the first edition of the present book, the total had expanded only by an additional nine to reach the total of ﬁfteen. At the time, the total paled in comparison with the more than twenty European nations that are not members of the EU (the exact number depends on whether countries such as Cyprus or small nations such as Liechtenstein are or are not aligned with Europe). At the beginning of the century, most of the non-member states lay in Eastern Europe, though there are the notable holdouts in Western Europe, such as Norway and Switzerland. At the end of the decade, EU membership has reached twenty-seven, almost doubling, and debates about expanding the European Union even farther to the east and southeast have crescendoed. The political philosophy of the EU and the institutional structures that put it in play represent and emphasize the persistence of the two Europes. John Pinder notes that “the phenomenon of the Community and the Union” can be explained in two ways. The ﬁrst of these locates European unity at the economic, military, and cultural borders between individual nation-states. Problems of unity are therefore more pragmatic, and for that reason Pinder calls proponents of this model of unity “realists” or “functionalists” (Pinder 2001: 6). Those who turn to larger European institutions for solutions to the many problems that extend far beyond inter-nation-state relations often go under the name “federalists” (ibid.: 7). They concern themselves primarily with the articulation and enforcement of principles, such as the EU requirement that member states have democratically elected governments. The history of the EU unfolds in ﬁts and starts because of the shifting inﬂuences of and quarrels between the realists and the federalists—for example, about whether the constitution of the European Union should contain explicit language about Europe as Catholic, one of the greatest stumbling blocks to ratiﬁcation 8\n\nMusic and Nationalism • 9\n\neven at the end of the ﬁrst decade of the twenty-ﬁrst century. It is unlikely that one or the other will ever win the day, and it is thus equally unlikely that the two sets of conditions they espouse will succeed in unifying Europe in ways that will reﬂect real compromise. To move ahead, the EU, too, has had to accept the presence of two Europes. The question that remains open is whether the EU effects unity or whether it generates historical and political demands that exaggerate the conditions that rip Europe into two parts. Arguably, even the introduction of the Euro as a common currency has the function of bringing about some forms of unity while at the same time exacerbating the absence of unity. Indeed, there are nations almost desperate to join the EU, but there are also movements within the most stalwart EU member states (such as France and Germany) as well as more maverick states (Austria, Denmark, and the UK, for example), that openly espouse withdrawal from the EU. The EU may well successfully navigate these currents and countercurrents, but to do so it must address—and accept—the tendency for Europe to persist in two parts. That tendency, as the several examples here illustrate, is fueled by nationalism.\n\nWhy Do We Love to Hate and Hate to Love Nationalism in Music? I do not believe that I have ever encountered anyone who is simply ambivalent toward nationalist music. Some love it; many more hate it. Some welcome it for its potentially positive attributes; others vilify it for its destructiveness. When I lecture about nationalist music, say, about the Eurovision Song Contest, I am seldom spared responses that dismiss it as trite and unworthy of scholarly attention. More often than not, someone in the audience is willing to punctuate discussion with pronouncements like “this is crappy music”—indeed, one of the tamer judgments. The point is not simply that many who dismiss Eurovision songs have never heard them—they have not—but rather that they imagine that, because the Eurovision Song Contest panders to nationalism in so many ways, it must be dreadful. After all, doesn’t nationalism bring out the worst in music? It is shockingly easy to dismiss music that possesses and expresses any elements of the nation and nationalism. Nationalist music embarrasses and infuriates us. We laugh at it and we become angry at it. Almost perversely, we love to hate nationalist music. Our love–hate relationship with nationalism and music is not simply relegated to popular-song contests such as the Eurovision. The moment folk music enters the national sphere, which it does with great frequency, it too loses the luster of authenticity. Once folk music is uprooted from its pristine world and put on the stage of the nation, perhaps as a national collection in the nineteenth century, a repertory available for the virtuoso display of an Eastern European army ensemble, or as the competitive underpinning of folk-like hits for scores of national broadcasting companies, it loses its natural beauty and starts sounding all the same, while accruing the ugly messages of national ideologies. The great collectors of European folk music recognized this, while at the same time they attempted to steer clear of nationalism in folk music. European art or classical music is no less endangered by the polluting impact of contact with the national. Composers tainted by the national spirit are lesser talents, mere mortals incapable of ascending to the pantheon of godlike beings whose greatness results from their ability to recognize that art music is autonomous, moving in the course of 9\n\n10 • Music and Nationalism\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 2 3 4 5\n\nmodern European history toward absolute music.
