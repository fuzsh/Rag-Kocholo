        "text": "Bio\n\nYulia Samoylova was born in 1989 in the Komi ASSR, the city of Ukhta. Yulia has been disabled wheelchair user since childhood and has 1st disability group for hereditary disease. At age 13, he was diagnosed with \"Spinal amyotrophy of Verding - Hoffmann\". At the same time, Yulia always clearly evaluates her steps, does not accept pity in her address and lives a full-fledged life.\n\nInterest to music to Yulia was brought by her mother. In childhood she sang in school discos, at home with karaoke system. She studied at the Palace of Pioneers, sang at a charity concerts, gave four solo concerts. She participated in various vocal competitions, both local and international, among them: \"Silver Hoof 2002\" (1st place), \"On the Wings of Dreams\", \"Silver Hoof 2003\" (2nd place), \"Spring Drops\", \"SCHLAGER\" - 2005\", \"Rose of the Winds\" in Egypt (1st place), \"New Ukhta\" (Grand Prix).\n\nSamoylova has tried herself in heavy alternative music. In 2008 she founded band \"TerraNova\", which recorded 6 demo song but split up in less than two years. Samoylova returned to the stage, having performed at the charity concert in Ukhta a song by A.Pugacheva \"Svecha gorela na stole\" and realized that she could not live without a stage.\n\nIn February 2013 Yulia has decided to try herself in \"Factor A\" of Alla Pugacheva on \"Russia 1\" (Russian version of The X Factor). She got breakthrough performing at the auditions \"Molitva\" of Marija Serifovic with Russian lyrics written by ESCKAZ editor-in-chief Andy Mikheev. This performance has accumulated over 4 mln views on Youtube combined. She competed in 16-25 category mentored by Roman Emelyanov. At the show she has performed: \"Ne otrekayutsya, lyubya\", \"Yeshche lyublyu\", \"Ostanus' peplom\", \"I will always love you\", \"Zhenshchina, kotoraya poyet\", \"Svecha\", \"Ostanovite zemlyu\", \"Obernis'\", \"Ariya Iisusa\", \"Molitva\", \"Stena\". On 21 April 2013 she became runner-up of the show while Alla Pugacheva awarded with the \"Golden Star of Alla\" prize.\n\nIn 2014, Samoylova became owner of the \"V national award named after Elena Mukhina\" in the nomination \"Unbroken Note\". In 2014 she took part in the opening ceremony of the Winter Paralympic Games 2014 where she performed song \"Vmeste\". She released singles \"Light\", \"Novy Den\", and duet with Gosha Kutsenko \"Cometa\". In 2014 Yulia got married with Alexey Taran, with whom she was dating since 2012, and who also works as manager of the singer.\n\nChannel One has completed the internal selection of performer and song for the participation in the Eurovision Song Contest 2017 and decided on the choice - Russia in Kyiv will be represented by Yulia Samoylova, whose performance of the song about love \"Flame Is Burning\" made the strongest impression.\n\n\"Yulia is an original singer, a charming girl and an experienced contestant,\" says the head of the Russian delegation at the contest Yuri Aksyuta. \"The musical career requires tremendous emotional and physical tension, which only a few people can take on their shoulders. I'm amazed of the successes Yulia has managed to achieve on this path. I think that on 11 May millions of viewers around the world will share this feeling with us\"\n\nThe authors of the music and lyrics of the song \"Flame Is Burning\" are Leonid Gutkin, with whom Channel One has already collaborated on Eurovision more than once (songs of Dina Garipova and Polina Gagarina), as well as Netta Nimrodi and Arie Burshtein. Latter are known as singer/songwriter duo \"Amber Revival\" currently signed to IMAGEM/Steam Publishing, Germany, having wide resume from acoustic folk to classic, but nowadays dividing most of their time between working with electronic producers all around the world.\n\n- What are the three most interesting aspects about your entry?\n\n- The Eurovision Song Contest stage was, and still is, my most cherished dream since childhood. I can't believe it's actually going to come true. Leonid Gutkin, who was part if Russia's team in the Eurovision Song Contest in 2013 and 2015 is the co-author of my song. I am the first ever Eurovision contestant from Russia who uses a wheelchair.\n\n- What are the most impressive facts about you?\n\n- Since childhood my parents taught me to solve all my own problems myself. If I complained, if somebody offended me, took away my doll, or humiliated me, my mum and dad always told me that I was to deal with it myself. I am very grateful to them for the lesson. I grew up and I don't feel helpless. Looking at my tender image, no one will believe it but I was singing in a hard rock band. I was the one who founded the band. All other musicians were young men, older than me, but in spite of that, they had to go through a very strict casting. In hard times I can't demonstrate my emotions and people think that everything is fine even if I feel a whirlwind inside. Music helps me to express my emotions. I open up and show my emotions through my songs.\n\n- Do you have a (lucky) routine before you go on stage?\n\n- No specific routine, but before a performance I like to stay alone at least for half an hour. This way I set myself in the right tune and build up the energy to share it with viewers.\n\n- Why is the Eurovision Song Contest important for you?\n\n- Because it was my childhood dream. I always wanted a \"sea\" of people to see and hear me and here there is a whole ocean!\n\nLatest news\n\n14/04: Comment by Thomas Schreiber, ARD\n\n14/04: Konstantin Ernst: Yulia Samoylova to represent Russia in 2018\n\n14/04: Official statement of UA:PBC\n\nChannel One will not broadcast the Eurovision this year. The situation around Yulia Samoylova, whom Ukraine refused to admit to territory of the country has caused this decision. On 13 April Channel One received a letter from the European Broadcasting Union that it was unable to resolve this problem with Kyiv. So the event will not go on air in Russia. Solidarity was expressed by second Russian broadcaster VGTRK (RTR) which also will not run broadcast from Kyiv.\n\n\"EBU offers us two options to solve this issue. First, it is to film Yulia performance here in Moscow remotely and broadcast it through the satellite, and in Kyiv it would have been broadcast on the large screen. For us, this option is unacceptable, because, in my opinion, this is a complete violation of the rules. The participant must be on stage, perform the song live and be there, in Kyiv, and not somewhere remotely in Moscow or in any other European city. This, in my opinion, is simply discrimination against the Russian participant. And, of course, the broadcaster will not accept such conditions under any circumstances.\n\nThe second proposal, which the European Broadcasting Union has offered us, is to change the participant. In my opinion, this is even worse than offering Yulia to sing remotely. Because we chose our entrant a long time ago and we chose Yulia. For her this is a dream of the whole life.\n\nNaturally, we can not participate in the Eurovision Song Contest 2017 on the terms that are offered to us and we will not broadcast the competition either, because the absence of a participant from Russia, in my opinion, is very damaging to the reputation of the contest itself, and, in general, for Russian viewers it is an additional reason not to have an interest in this contest, \"- says head of Russian delegation Yuri Aksyuta.\n\nChannel One has received a letter from the European Broadcasting Union: it is not possible to solve the problem with the Ukrainian authorities. Status quo - the ban on entry for the Russian singer remains in force.\n\nYulia Samoylova should have flown to Kyiv soon to perform in the second semifinal on May 11. Yulia and many fans believed that the Eurovision management will solve the situation allowing Russian entrant to perform.\n\n\"Support is simply unreal! I do not know, it's just some kind of power, really it's power. And not only from Russia, from all over the world! They write me from Japan, they paint me like an anime hero, \"- said the singer Yulia Samoylova.\n\nIn her interviews, she always said: even if they do not let her in, she will survive. She often heard the word \"no\" in her life, and Yulia was not one of those whom refusal could stop. However, uncertainty did not give a rest. In the European Broadcasting Union they promised to fight for the Russian entrant, but ultimately lost.\n\n\"It's certainly upsetting me, because it's my dream, well, I believe and hope. I believe that this will happen again. There were a lot of situations when I was told \"no.\" Well, on the one hand, it somehow inspires to move forward. I want to inspire all people with my own example, inspire them not to surrender in any situation, live a full life and follow their dreams, do not give up, \"said Yulia Samoylova\n\nStrong, courageous, as before - with a smile, Yulia says: I would not be afraid to fly to Kyiv even under the threat of arrest. But she wouldn't have been allowed to sing anyway. However, Yulia Samoylova will still have a chance to perform at the Eurovision. Next year, in 2018.\n\nOfficial statement from the EBU\n\nFollowing the official confirmation that Russian Eurovision entrant, Julia Samoylova, will not be permitted to travel to Kyiv to compete in the Eurovision Song Contest 2017, the EBU formally offered two alternative proposals to Channel One in a bid to find a solution that would enable Russia to continue their participation in this year’s event.\n\n\"These proposals were to either take part via satellite or to change their chosen artist to one who could legally travel to Ukraine for the duration of the Contest. Sadly both proposals have been rejected by Channel One and they have now announced they do not intend to broadcast the Eurovision Song Contest 2017. Unfortunately this means Russia will no longer be able to take part in this year’s competition. We very much wanted all 43 countries to be able to participate and did all we could to achieve this,\" the EBU states.\n\nFrank Dieter Freiling, Chairman of the Eurovision Song Contest Reference Group, the event’s steering committee, said: \"We strongly condemn the Ukrainian authorities' decision to impose a travel ban on Julia Samoylova as we believe it thoroughly undermines the integrity and non-political nature of the Eurovision Song Contest and its mission to bring all nations together in friendly competition. However, preparations continue apace for the Eurovision Song Contest in the host city Kyiv. Our top priority remains to produce a spectacular Eurovision Song Contest with our Member UA:PBC in May.\"\n\n13/04: Official site has updated list of participants of the 2nd semifinal\n\n13/04: Comment of Yuri Aksyuta\n\n\"Channel One\" will not broadcast Eurovision Song Contest 2017.\n\nThe European Broadcasting Union has stated in an official letter that it could not resolve the issue of Yulia Samoylova's participation in the contest. The EBU proposed an option of remote performance, or the replacement of Yulia Samoylova with another participant.\n\n\"Channel One\" considers both options unacceptable: a remote performance discriminates against the Russian participant and goes against the rules and principles of the contest. The option of replacing Yulia Samoylova can not even be considered. In this situation, \"Channel One\" does not consider it possible to broadcast the Eurovision Song Contest 2017, \"the TV broadcaster has said in its statement.\n\n\"We consider the refusal of the Ukrainian side to be completely unreasonable, the reason for it, of course, is Ukraine's attempt to politicize the contest, whose goal throughout the 62-year history was to unite people.\"\n\nThe Russian media holding VGTRK (RTR) will not broadcast the Eurovision song contest instead of the \"Channel One\". VGTRK specified that in theory it has the right to broadcast the contest, since it is a member of the European Broadcasting Union. \"We will not broadcast the Eurovision.

We will continue a dialogue with the Ukrainian authorities with the aim of ensuring that all artists can perform at the 62nd Eurovision Song Contest in Kyiv in May.\n\nThe Security Service of Ukraine has banned for three years entry of Russian singer Yulia Samoylova to the territory of Ukraine, reported press-secretary of SSU Olena Hitlyanska on her Facebook page. Hitlyanska has clarified that such a decision was made on the basis of the data obtained by the Service about the violation of Ukrainian legislation by Samoylova.

Channel One has no additional information at the moment,\" - informed press-secretary of Russian broadcaster Larisa Krymova speaking to Interfax News Agency. She clarified that \"no official notifications from the Ukrainian authorities have been received.\"\n\nIn the report of journalist Ekaterina Kibalchich aired yesterday on Channel One it was stated: \"By the end of the week, there was an official confirmation received that the Russian delegation will not be banned from entering Kyiv, which means that Europe will hear this song and learn the life story of Yulia Samoylova.\"\n\nRecall that on 15 March, Russian newspaper \"Izvestia\", referring to its own sources in the Ukrainian committee of the contest, stated that any prohibitions that may apply to the Russian participant will be suspended for the duration of the Song Contest. \"All participants of the Eurovision will come to Kyiv and will enjoy all the beauty of the event,\" the source said.\n\nHowever, on 17 March, the Security Service of Ukraine reported that the issue on a possible ban on the entry for the Russian performer Yulia Samoylova has not yet been decided. \"As of this minute, the decision to ban the entry of the singer from Russia is not accepted... We still have enough time until May,\" - said the head of the SSU Vasyl Hrytsak on Friday.\n\nIn it's Voskresnoye vremya report, Channel One Russia Первый канал claims \"receiving at the end of the week the official confirmation that the Russian delegation would not be banned from entering Kyiv, which means that Europe would hear this song and learn the life story of Yulia Samoylova\".\n\nYulia Samoylova, who is expected to represent Russia at the Eurovision 2017, called \"amusing\" threats of Ukrainian politicians to prevent her from the participation in the contest. Such an opinion she expressed in an interview with the program \"Vesti on Saturday\" with Sergey Brilyov. \"It's all quite amusing, and I do not understand why there's such a buzz. There was an absolutely ordinary concert in Crimea in support of a sport event, there were wrestlers from America, there were a lot of artists, I do not know, I somehow find this strange\", - the singer said. She added that in past she has visited Ukrainian city of Kherson, where her relatives live.\n\nCommenting on the assumptions that her participation in the contest is a PR move by Russia, Yulia Samoylova noted that prejudice to her had always existed. \"Many people, many opinions\", - the singer said and stressed that her goal is \"to show that any person is capable of anything, no matter who you are, and if you have dream, you can achieve it. Eurovision has always been a dream for me, I've been thinking about it since 2000, and from 2013 I began to move closer to this dream step by step\".\n\nYulia said that she is preparing for the Eurovision just like for any other contest. \"I'm more worried about the song, so that I don't forget the lyrics, because I do not speak English at all\". She did not study entrants from other countries: \"It's not necessary, it only distracts, and you get unnecessary thoughts. I realized that after the \"Factor A\" project that it's better to just go there being completely self-centered, and that's it\". Hosts of Radio KP gave Yulia to listen the song of Francesco Gabbana, and she commented on it as follows: \"All the Italian songs are very melodic, they make you want to raise your hands, I grew up with many Italian songs, my life is connected with Italy, there lives my grandmother\".\n\nIn the autumn the singer underwent surgery. \"It was required for me, because in connection with my illness the muscles of the back stop to hold posture, and it was already getting to the point where there were difficulties with eating. Of course, I was frightened and started looking for different clinics. The choice was made for the one in Finland. I am happy with the result of the surgery, of course, too little time has passed since it - less than half a year. The full recovery takes one year. I became taller. They say, even my face has changed\".\n\n\"I would not want to perform in too gorgeous dress, like a princess, or a wedding dress. I would like to combine a rocker jacket with an unusual, long skirt, some shirt too, maybe something that will look rebellious\", told Yulia about the outfit she would like to wear at the contest stage.\n\n17/03: Security Service of Ukraine: No decision on Russian entrant has yet been taken\n\n14/03: Ukrainian authorities should themselves take decision on allowance of Russian performer to the country\n\n\"Of course, this is a very responsible step, but you know, I really dreamed of performing at the Eurovision from the very childhood, to represent Russia. Even when I was very small, I watch Alsou, I tried to copy her movements, singing, grimaced with a hair dryer, which represented a microphone, imagining myself on a big stage. In principle, my parents were leading me to this. I was growing up, and gradually, contest by contest, stage by stage, all came to this and I will represent Russia. It's a great honor for me and very exciting\", said Yulia Samoylova in an interview with Artur Gasparyan for \"MK\".\n\nAccording to the singer, after her performance at the Paralympic Games in 2014 her candidacy got into the potential shortlist for the Eurovision. \"I was told: keep in mind, you will be one of the candidates, when exactly, we do not know, but get ready\". The singer says that this year she has started preparing a while ago, but it was undermined by the surgery in September, and because of this she lost a lot of time. Doctors did not recommend her to sing for the whole year, because it creates a strain on the spine. Until now, Yulia is still undergoing rehabilitation in Helsinki. \"It was questionable if I will even be able take part in the contest, I did everything to go through rehabilitation period as quickly and successfully as possible, because I really wanted to, and as soon as I started feeling better, I confidently said that I can do that. Some, of course, looked with suspicion: can I do it for sure? But with my hard work I showed that I am quite persistent, assiduosu, and they relied on me, they believed me, and again everything became good. We are working!\"\n\nSpeaking about her entry Yulia says: \"I like this song, it's very organic to me, to some extent it is about me. Not even to some, but just about me. As soon as I was shown it, I immediately said I liked it, there never was doubt that it will fit me, and it was very easy during the recording, the only difficulty I have is the English language, which is of course a big trouble for me, but I'm supported by vocal coaches and English language teacher. We are very busy now and we are quietly coping with this task. Two months are ahead, and I am sure that I will be all right. It can be said that the rehearsal period has been going on for a long time, as far as it was possible after the surgery. I took part in the recording and in the classes with the teachers, but now I'm feeling much better, and we started to do everything more actively\".\n\nYulia is not yet familiar with her future rivals for the Kyiv stage, because she believes that the main thing is to concentrate on one's own forces and on one's own talent, which I must show and do my best, and, most importantly, I should perform with dignity. First of all, I am going to represent our country, for me this is the main motive. The main task is to perform with dignity, and for this I am working very hard. I want to sing a good song and do it well. I am already happy. What will happen next, I now do not want to make a guess. There will be many countries, we will all gather for the celebration of the song in one place. We are all artists, we live in music, creativity, and in this sense we understand each other very well. I can say that we speak the same language - the language of music and song. Everything will be wonderful and good, I do not know, but it seems to me that I will be well received \".\n\n\"Flame Is Burning\" belongs to the authorship of the Russian composer Leonid Gutkin, who worked on entries of Dina Garipova (2013) and Polina Gagarina (2015). These songs he composed together with Swedish authors. This year, the composer proposed to the Channel One a song created jointly with the Israelis living in Berlin, their names are Natta Nimrodi and Arie Burshtein. According to Mr. Gutkin, he and his colleagues composed the song \"Flame Is Burning\" last year, long before the choice of the song for \"Eurovision\" passed to the decisive stage. Leonid Gutkin learned who will sing the song at Eurovision three days ago. Natta Nimrodi and Arie Burshtein have their own pop project Amber Revival. They cooperate with the German publishing company IMAGEM / Steam, whose clients are, for example, Daft Punk and Mark Ronson.\n\n\"We were looking for a singer with a certain history, we were looking for a singer, maybe not very known... not some big star of our show business. We tried to find a person, a character, individuality first of all, \"says head of delegation Yury Aksyuta\n\n12/03: Yulia Samoylova to represent Russia\n\n10/03: Channel One denies press-conference plans\n\n10/03: Serhiy Proskurnia: Russian delegation to have Eurovision press-conference tomorrow\n\n09/03: Heads of Delegation meeting may take place without Russian delegation\n\n09/03: Radio Liberty report on potential Russian boycott\n\n07/03: Pust govoryat to be recorded and broadcast on 13 March\n\n06/03: Pust govoryat recording delayed indefinitely\n\n05/03: Andrey Malakhov: We need Dove of Peace\n\nAccording to the ESCKAZ sources, number of artists and creative teams who have offered the Russian broadcaster Channel One some shortlisted potential entries for the Eurovision Song Contest 2017 participation, have been notified last week about the possibility of withdrawal of the broadcaster from the competition. At that time the entry which should represent the country at the contest was not yet determined.\n\nIt is possible, that among such creative teams was also the team of Philipp Kirkorov, who last week had unexpectedly called for a boycott of the festival. \"There is such an obvious bias and score-setting with Russia, that I have absolutely no interest to deal with an organization that ignores my country, doing it so rough and so ugly. And I advise you to reduce your interest in this contest until they will put things in order there. I would not send anyone there this year at all!\", said the artist, producer and co-writer of a numerous Eurovision entries Philip Kirkorov in an interview with Life.\n\nAs the main reason for a possible withdrawal of the Russian delegation from the participation in the contest is likely to be cited insufficient guarantees of the Ukrainian side to ensure the safety of the members of the Russian delegation. This has been already worded by the press secretary of the President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Peskov: \"It is not clear whether it (Eurovision) should be boycotted. But, of course, taking into account the location of the contest this year, possible problems with safety and unfriendly attitude, cause for the concern is obvious.\" - said Peskov, answering questions of Russian press.\n\nIt should be noted that security assurance to all the participants is practically the first question discussed between EBU and the host country. EBU has repeatedly announced that all necessary guarantees were received from the Ukrainian authorities, and \"everyone who wishes to see the Eurovision Song Contest, will be able to do this and their safety will be guaranteed\". \"Ukrainian authorities understand that unpleasant accidents with the Russian delegation in Kyiv may cost Ukraine enormous image losses. The best way is to rely on the security services of the host country, which I am doing,\" - said the Executive Supervisor of the contest Jon Ola Sand in an interview with \"New time\".\n\nIn Kyiv, a special headquarters to ensure the security of the contest has been established: It consists of representatives of the UA:PBC, the State Committee, Kyiv City State Administration, the Security Service of Ukraine, the State Border Service, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Internal Affairs. \"Law-enforcement agencies had 100% guaranteed the safety of the contest in Kyiv, it was one of the reasons for the choice of this city as the host city for the event,\" stressed the former Director General of NTU Zurab Alasania, announcing the venue of the Eurovision 2017.\n\nNevertheless, the Russian press and television had already actively started preparing public opinion for the possibility of the withdrawal from the participation in the contest. Back in May, according to the opinion poll, 52 percent of respondents were against Russian participation in the Eurovision 2017. Now this figure is only increasing, reaching 60-80% according to the different data. Programs with the calls to withdraw from the contest are broadcast on all major TV networks of the country, their own talk show in the framework of \"Let Them Talk\" program on Monday plans to film participating broadcaster Channel One. To all the broadcasts are invited advocates of the boycott: MPs V.Milonov and J.Kobzon or artist manager J.Prigozhin.\n\nRussian television frightens Russian artists and public with \"mass riots\", \"armed attacks\" and \"terrorist acts\" in Ukraine. \"Due to the inability to ensure the safety of staff and visitors of the sold-out concerts in Ukraine on the eve of the Eurovision\" has been called off series of concerts in Ukraine of Alla Pugacheva's daughter Kristina Orbakaite. Taking into account the artificially generated hype around the issue, the chances for the resumption of the normal selection process are reduced with each passing day.\n\nESCKAZ poll, conducted yesterday showed that the majority of Russian fans of the competition - 87% are still in favor of their country's participation in the contest in Kyiv. At the same time, even among fans of contest from Ukraine, 60% also support the participation of a representative of the Russian Federation.\n\nHowever, in the wide national press weak voices of supporters of the participation are barely audible. Their position is basically defended only by the few potential participants: Aleksandr Panayotov calling to send to the contest song which will be \"uniting our brotherly peoples\" and perform it \"if he is not killed there\", or Mikhail Turetsky, who speaks about the special \"stress resistance\" of his all-female band Soprano, whose \"professionalism will be able to win over any audience, even originally hostile\".\n\nNow it seems that only a clear position of the Russian state leadership could change the situation. Such, for example, as a statement of the Federation Council head Valentina Matvienko, who speaking on 18 May shortly after the victory of Jamala, said that Russia should take part in the next Eurovision Song Contest to be held in Kyiv. \"We should definitely participate\", - said Matvienko responding to reporters question. \"I think that we should not strike any pose. We should not be discussing, whether we participate or not. This is politicking.\".\n\nAt the moment the representatives of the Channel One have not made any statements about their participation in the contest, citing the fact that there is still time before the deadline for the submission of the entry. We remind you that on 13 March in Kyiv will be held meeting of the Heads of Delegations of the countries participating in the Eurovision Song Contest 2017. Before the start of it participating delegations should upload to the EBU intranet complete required information about their entries.\n\nIn case of the failure of the Channel One to nominate delegate for the competition, the broadcaster will still be obliged to pay the full participation fee. Broadcaster may retain the right to broadcast the contest. In the event of its withdrawal from the broadcasting as well, appropriate rights valid for the territory of Russia may be sold out to another broadcaster of the country.\n\nESCKAZ has learnt that on 6 March Channel One Russia will be filming their primetime show \"Pust' Govoryat\" (\"Let Them Talk\", famous talk-show hosted by the ESC 2009 presenter Andrey Malakhov) with a topic of discussion \"Should Russia take part in the Eurovision?\". To the studio will be invited popular artists, representatives of the national delegation, as well as advocates of the boycott in the name of the MP Milonov etc. Broadcast of the program is tentatively scheduled for 9 March.\n\nSimilar talk show with the topic: \"Ukraine creates all conditions to force Moscow to boycott \"Eurovision\"\" as part of program \"Political Detective\" will be broadcasted on Zvezda channel owned by Ministy of Defense on Sunday. Eurovision related shows are expected on NTV, TVC and other broadcasters.\n\nWe remind you that on 13 March in Kyiv will be held meeting of the Heads of Delegations of the countries participating in the Eurovision Song Contest 2017. Before the start of it participating delegations should upload to the EBU intranet complete required information about their entries.\n\nAccording to a poll conducted on the site of leading governmental news agency RIA Novosti 61% of voters support the idea of ​​a boycott, against it stand 15%. In a similar poll on the website of the newspaper Vzglyad 66% of respondents are in favor of complete Russian withdrawal from the participation in the contest, 25% believe that it is necessary only to boycott the contest in Ukraine, and only 9% are in favor of continuing taking part in it. However, officials are likely to depart from the topic of \"boycott\" itself, and prefer to discuss possible withdrawal due to lack of security guarantees to the members of the Russian delegation in Ukraine.\n\nIn case of the failure of the Channel One to nominate delegate for the competition, the broadcaster will still be obliged to pay the full participation fee. Broadcaster may retain the right to broadcast the contest. In the event of its withdrawal from the broadcasting as well, appropriate rights valid for the territory of Russia may be sold out to another broadcaster of the country. If removal from the competition will be held after the meeting of the delegations on March 13 or in any other way brings the non-pecuniary damage the EBU, the other participating broadcasters, channel-organizer partner televoting and / or international sponsors, refusing to participate broadcaster will have to compensate this damage.\n\n03/03: EBU: No reasons to believe Russia will not take part\n\n02/03: Peskov: Kremlin has no stand on Eurovision boycott\n\nLife.ru once again writes that Aleksander Panayotov remains the number one candidate to represent Russia at the Eurovision Song Contest 2017.\n\nSource at the Channel One, which is in charge of the Eurovision broadcast in Russia this year, informed publication that the candidacy of 32-year-old singer was already approved by the management of Music broadcast department of the channel. According to Life, this year again the Russian broadcaster once again decided not to carry out the national selection and select the contest entry internally by the decision of the Russian organizing committee. Allegedly, the decision will be announced officially a month later. Officially, however, the music department of Channel One explained to Life that they are not yet ready to announce the representative of Russia officially.\n\n- I honestly have no idea where from such information comes - says in an interview with \"KP\" head of the Russian delegation Yuri Aksyuta. - Most likely, from the circles of Aleksander Panayotov himself. We do not have the decision as yet. We are still thinking about candidate or candidates who could represent Russia at the contest. In the near future this decision will be made. Hopefully, within 1.5 - 2 weeks. This will be the official decision. At this moment we are considering any candidates - including Panayotov. The song will be then written for a specific artist, whom we select. Be patient!\n\nIn the process are considered at least 5 candidates, among whom is also Panayotov, writes \"MK\", but the decision will be taken only in couple of weeks time. Alexander Panayotov himself talking to MK said that he is not aware of such a decision of the Channel One.\n\n\"I don't know anything about it yet, however, if \"The party\" will say \"You must\", then of course, I will answer \"Yes\". I understand that this is a risky move in the current situation - to perform in Ukraine under the Russian flag. But I would got with a conciliatory mission. The song should bring people together. And if it so happens that I am selected, I, of course, will have no choice but to go on a mission of good, to try to at least to do so, if I'm not killed for it. There are crazy people everywhere...\"\n\nRecall that Russian tabloid Life is already for several months promoting the candidacy of Alexander Panayotov as a possible representative of Russia at ESC 2017.\n\n25/12: 64 members of the Alexandrov ensemble were on board of the plane which has crashed at the Black Sea\n\n08/12: Interview of Mikhail Turetskiy, manager of SOPRANO, to MK\n\n31/10: 43-countries to compete in Kyiv\n\n29/09: Alexandr Panayotov comments on possibility of his ESC participation\n\n27/09: Alexandr Panayotov is labelled as favourite for the Eurovision\n\nPreselection\n\nOn 31 October EBU formally confirmed Channel One Russia as participating broadcaster in the Eurovision Song Contest 2017. However, country remains deeply divided on the issue of participation in the contest in Ukraine and final decision on it is expected to be taken in Spring. Fans of the contest should not be confused by the presence of Russia in the list of \"confirmed countries\", a Participating Broadcaster is able to withdraw from the contest at any point of time, though being liable for paying 100% of its final participation fee. If a withdrawal happens after Heads of Delegations meeting in March or somehow causes non-material damage to the EBU, the other Participating Broadcasters, the Host Broadcaster, the pan-European televoting partner and/or the International Sponsors, the withdrawing broadcaster may be required to compensate such a damage.\n\n\"Russia confirmed its participation in the Eurovision Song Contest 2017. Besides than that, no specific questions to us or requests to ensure any actions within the framework of Eurovision have been reported\", said on November 29 in an interview to ZIK TV Executive Producer of the contest Oleksandr Kharebin. \"So far the participating countries are not in a direct contact with the host broadcaster, and the Russians as well are in contact with the European Broadcasting Union. When they select through the open contest or internal decision a person or a group who will represent Russia at the Eurovision Song Contest in Ukraine, we will be hearing from them. We will be understand it in February-March,\", - he told.\n\nLargest Russian governmental agency RIA Novosti had issued a large analytical article with a clear message: Russia should withdraw from the contest in Ukraine: \"Eurovision 2017 threatens to become for Moscow the next headache, comparable to the one that was brought by the story with our Olympians\", writes analyst Vladimir Lepyokhin. Citing issues with blacklisting of the \"representatives of Russian culture\" and \"Opening of the festival-celebration of the Western, becoming more and more anti-Christianian values in the form of \"Conchitism-Wurstism\" in the St.Sophia Cathedral, absolutely holy location for the majority of Russians\", he comes to the conclusion that the only road for the improvement of the Eurovision, as well as PACE, IOC and WADA is in Russian withdrawal from these structures or at least suspension of membership in them and creation of own alternative Eurasian organizations and events. \"In short, participation in the Eurovision 2017 will mean that we do not respect ourselves. And if we do have self respect, we should not take part in it\". Russian broadcaster NTV has devoted several special talk shows and various reports in other shows to critics of Ukrainian organization of the contest, while music producer Iosif Prigozhin appealed to Russian artists to boycott the Eurovision in Ukraine.\n\nIssue with the inclusion of several Russian artists to the \"List of persons, representing threat to the national security of Ukraine\" and \"blacklisted\" from the entry to the territory of the country has been widely discussed as well, read more in our reports from 7 December and 10 September.\n\nAt the same time, on 18 May, Speaker of the Federation Council Valentina Matvienko stated that Russia should take part in the next Eurovision Song Contest to be held in Kyiv. \"We should definitely participate\", - said Matvienko answering question of reporters. \"I think that we should not strike any pose. We should not be discussing, whether we participate or not. This is politicking\", - she underlined.\n\nAt the same time, various Russian artists have already expressed interest to represent Russian Federation at the contest in Ukraine. Among them are\n\n• Eurovision National Finals veteran Aleksandr Panayotov,\n\n• girl group \"SOPRANO Turetskogo\", which was one of the favourites for the Eurovision in 2014,\n\n• US/Uzbekistani singer Nargiz Zakirova collaborating with composer Maxim Fadeev (Russia 2004, 2007, JESC 2014),\n\n• new line-up of \"Buranovskiye babushki\" band which has no artists remaining from 2012 (they are still performing as alternative line-up under \"Babushki iz Buranovo\" name),\n\n• Diana Gurtskaya (Eurovision 2008 entrant from Georgia, currently chairwoman of the commission on the support of family, children and motherhood in Russia),\n\n• controversial hair stylist turned singer Sergey Zverev, who already was considered for Eurovision 2015,\n\n• Ukrainian born artist turned singer Vitaliy Gogunskiy, who won \"Your Face Sounds Familiar\" show on TV Russia, who has already composed potential entry \"Butterfly\" and was reported to be seeking support from Philipp Kirkorov as well,\n\n• Song and Dance Ensemble of the Russian Army named after Aleksandrov, which performed as interval act in Eurovision 2009 and was already interested to compete in Eurovision in 2014. 64 artists of the ensemble, among them singer Evgeny Bulochnikov, who was considered one of the candidates for the Eurovision, were killed in the plane crash on 25 December. It should be added that singers Vadim Ananiev and Valery Gavva, who performed at ESC 2009, and Boris Dyakov, who is considered main option for the contest, were not on the board of the plane.\n\nUkrainian born singer Alexandr Panayotov, who currently takes part in The Voice Russia stated in an interview to Life: \"I am ready to represent Russia at the contest. As far as I know, when the Eurovision Song Contest was created, in the '50s, it was designed in a way not only to entertain, but also to connect, to unite nations after World War II. It seems to me this is the main mission of the Eurovision nowadays as well. Indeed now there is a difficult situation between the two countries - fraternal countries. I, as a Ukrainian, I can say that I could have entered the contest with the mission of unification, reconciliation, with a song that would have melted the hearts of everyone - at least for those three short minutes on stage! - it would be magical\". Being under contract with \"FBI music\" Panayotov several times competed in Eurovision preselections in Russia: in 2005 in duet with Alexey Chumakov with \"Balalayka\" he was placed 5th, in internal preselection 2007 same duet is runner-up with \"Every Little Thing\", in 2008 as solo singer he is runner-up again with \"Crescent and Cross\". In 2009 he competes in the preselection in Ukraine and is placed shared 2nd with \"Superhero\" and in 2010 returns to Russia, where becomes 6th with \"Maya Showtime\".\n\nIn an interview to MK newspaper famous Russian showman, singer and music producer Mikhail Turetskiy revealed plans of preparations of the all-female group SOPRANO for the Eurovision Song Contest aiming to represent Russia. \"I was checking who was representing Russia in previous years, and since Buranovskiye Babushki, there was no female group for a long time. Around a year ago, I realized that they are completely ready. We have a wonderful resource - both in repertoire and staging, it was obvious now at their big concert in Moscow. I already ordered the contest entry from the Western composers, Swedes, with experience of the Eurovision Song Contest. In a week we will have a first demo. SOPRANO has their own way, since they do not exactly belong to the show-business. Intuition tells me that what we can creatively do on the stage can win them all: both tendentious and malicious, aggressive and loyal viewers. If Turetsky Choir I created together with my friends and we grew up together, looking for our own style, shaping ourselves, we were so called self-made artists, at the time of SOPRANO creation, I already had in mind a clear model of the universal vocal project and the ability to \"sculpt\" it from a very good \"construction material\". Especially since I would like in our entry, which they will be singing predominantly in English, to add few words in Russian and Ukrainian languages... We should be able to get a victory! Perhaps psychologically it is easier for the audience to listen to the solo artist, but we will spread our song on the voices so that it will get very bright personalized and powerful short fragments, in a style of Queen, but only with the female vocal bundle. Just let us show ourselves!\"\n\nSinger Nyusha repeatedly stated she is ready to consider Eurovision proposal in the case she is offered to perform a very good song, as she thinks special song and memorable stage presentation are the two main ingredients of success at the contest. Several times she has been consulting on this issue with Russian Eurovision guru Philipp Kirkorov, who is offering various advices to the singer.\n\nDoesn't rule out possible Eurovision return also Sergey Lazarev, Russian representative at the Eurovision Song Contest 2016: \"Fans of the contest from other countries are constantly asking me to come back and take revenge.
