        "text": "SuRie will represent the United Kingdom at the 2018 Eurovision Song Contest in Lisbon but she’s done an incredible job of promoting the Eurovision Song Contest to the United Kingdom as well.\n\nToday, as SuRie flies out to Lisbon ahead of her first Eurovision stage rehearsal tomorrow afternoon, she dropped another video on BBC Eurovision, and it’s awesome.\n\nSuRie has performed her own sign interpretation video for her entry Storm. It’s something Sweden has become famous for and it makes sure that the deaf community are given full access to enjoy the show. But, we think this is the first time it’s been made by the song’s performer before the Contest.\n\nSweden is notorious for its inclusivity around the Eurovision Song Contest and their national final Melodifestivalen. In 2016, the efforts of the interpreter went viral.\n\nOne Eurovision Song Contest entry has actually been performed in Latvian sign language. In 2005, Walter and Kazha performed the chorus of their entry The War Is Not Over with sign.\n\nThe whole concept of Eurovision is about inclusivity, connecting people and breaking down barriers through a music competition. It was created in 1956 to improve cultural undertandings in post-war Europe and has gone on to be the most watched non-sporting event in the world with 43 nations competing this year.\n\nIn 2015, Poland sent Monika Kuszynska to Eurovision after she won the national final. She was the first artist to appear at Eurovision using a wheelchair after she lost the use of her legs in a car crash.\n\nIn 1992 and again in 2000, Spain sent blind singer Serafin Zubiri to represent the country at the Eurovision Song Contest. Germany sent Corinna may to the Contest in 2002.\n\nGeorgia also sent a blind singer – Diana Gurtskaya – to the contest in 2008 with her anthemic entry Peace Will Come.\n\nEarlier this week, SuRie was forced to defend the Contest on This Morning after Philip Schofield told her she was a 50/1 shot and had almost no chance to win because it’s too political and nobody likes us.\n\nShe put him straight and pointed out that other countries actually have good songs. You can read about the awkward moment here and why Eurovision fans are cursing yet more negative media presentation of the event at home.\n\nSuRie has already done wonders for the Eurovision Song Contest in the United Kigndom this year and promoted the United Kingdom song brilliantly abroad. But ensuring that everyone can enjoy this incredible annual event is something extraordinary and brilliant. Well done SuRie.\n\nMORE : Eurovision 2018 date, time, countries taking part and who is representing the UK?"
