        "text": "ALL THE NEWS, ACTION AND REACTION LIVE FROM SOCHI 2014 AS IT HAPPENS!\n\nBy Zjan Shirinian and Nick Butler\n\nClick refresh for latest updates. All times stated are Russian\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow\n\n22:31 As ever, stay here every step of the way, for all the action throughout the day here on the insidethegames blog. We will be back at 09:00 (5am GMT)\n\nGoodnight!\n\n22:20 The super-combined event is on hold until Friday in the Alpine skiing so - fog permitting - tomorrow will be a day of slalom action with six events taking place.\n\nThere are also six sprinting events in cross-country, as well as ice sledge hockey classification matches and another tantalisingly-poised day of wheelchair curling round robin action.\n\nEnd of day four\n\n22:04 That brings us to the end of another day of action here in Sochi. Russia's Roman Petushkov was arguably the star of the day after he won his third gold medal of an outstanding Sochi 2014 with a victory in the men's sitting 12.5km event - as Russia swept the first four places in the standings.\n\nThere were further Russian biathlon golds for Mikhalina Lysova in the women's visually impaired 10km and for Alena Kaufman in the standing 10km - while Vitaliy Lukyanenko of Ukraine also took his second gold of the Games.\n\nIt was a day of fog up at Rosa Khutor for the Alpine events but, for the home fans at least, the highlight of day four was perhaps Russia's scintillating ice sledge hockey victory over the defending champions from the United States - revenge in part for their shoot-out loss during the Olympics last month.\n\nThe US will face Canada in a pulsating semi-final, with Russia against Norway in the other match - although neither will take place until Thursday.\n\n21:55 So in the last-four matches Norway will face Russia, and after that shock loss to the host nation earlier on, it will be the US against Canada in a repeat of the men's Olympic semi-final and women's Olympic final last month\n\nBoth have shown vulnerability today, but is still promises to be an absolute thriller on Thursday evening.\n\n21:52 The final buzzer goes and Canada hold on to beat the Czech Republic 1-0. Canada will progress to the semi-finals but, despite battling hard, the Czech's miss out and it is Norway who will go through in second place.\n\n21:47 Four minutes to go. Czech Republic are still in this but it is the Canadians who are looking more likely...\n\n21:40 Still 1-0. Czech Republic have several opportunities with the extra man as a Canadian is sent to the bin for hooking but they have not taken them and their chances are slipping away.\n\n21:31 Two golden opportunities for Canada to take the lead but the shots are missed and their lead remains just the single goal.\n\n21:22 The players are back on the ice for the final period of sporting action at Sochi 2014 on day four.\n\n21:16 So, the tournament favourites might be giving the impression that they are cruising but with the lead remaining just 1-0, Czech Republic are still in this one.\n\n21:07 End of the second period, and Canada lead Czech Republic 1-0 in a game lacking fireworks. Canada coasting to claiming the top spot at the top of their group.\n\n20:56 Greg Westlake of Canada finally breaks the deadlock midway through the second period. They lead the Czech Republic 1-0.\n\n20:47 A delay in proceedings as Canadian Kevin Rempel has a nasty fall in the ice sledge hockey. He is taken off the rink for now, as the match resumes.\n\n20:26 The first period is over in the ice sledge hockey. Canada, who forced the issue in the latter stages with a string of attacks, have been unable to find a breakthrough. It remains goalless.\n\nClosing Ceremony preview\n\n20:23 Opera singer Jos√© Carreras, visually-impaired Adyg singer Nafset Chenib, and Russian artist and Sochi 2014 Ambassador Diana Gurtskaya will perform the Paralympic anthem at the Closing Ceremony on Sunday.\n\nThey will be joined by singers from the All-Russia Children's Chorus Assembly, it has been announced.\n\nGurtskaya - who represented Georgia at the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest in Belgrade, Serbia - founded a charity which helps talented children with an impairment to achieve their ambitions.\n\n20:15 The Czechs have had the better of the goal-mouth action so far, with three shots to Canada's one.\n\n20:04 We're underway in the Shayba Arena. Canada play Czech Republic in the final round robin ice sledge hockey match of these Paralympics.\n\n19:37 Not long to wait now for the Czech Republic versus Canada in the ice sledge hockey. That game, which should confirm Canada as group winners ahead of Norway, will be the last of the sporting action on day four in Sochi. \"Heck of an effort, boys! We'll get 'em next time! #GoTeamUSA.\"\n\n- US sports anchor Kate Scott on the USA's ice sledge hockey defeat at the hands of Russia.\n\n19:10 Because of the reshuffling of events in the alpine skiing programme due to the fog, the women's slalom in the visually impaired, standing and sitting categories has been brought forward to tomorrow. And it will be an early start with the first of the action at 09:00 (05:00 GMT).\n\nUniversity students get the Paralympic know-how\n\n18:57 Students at the Russian International Olympic University in Sochi are taking part in a Paralympics observer and participation programme, to help them understand how such events are staged and how future organising committees gain the knowledge they need. See the full story here.\n\n18:32 So it's Canada versus the Czech Republic in the final round robin match in the ice sledge hockey at 20:00. Canada are the strong favourites to win that, and top the group.\n\n18:29 They're on their feet in the Shayba Arena as the clock hits zero. They beat the USA 2-1 in a riveting tie, and what a reaction from the crowd.\n\nThe Russians will play Norway in the semi-final, while the USA, who had a 100 per cent record in this competition before today, are set to play Canada who are up next.\n\n18:27 Into the last minute. Can the USA turn the tables on Russia?\n\n18:25 Two minutes on the clock - a tie will see the USA win the group.\n\n18:23 It's getting tense in the Shayba Arena. The USA have called a time-out.\n\n18:19 Russia call a time-out eight minutes into the third period. They lead 2-1.\n\n18:09 The United States have pulled one back. Adam Page's goal makes it to 2-1 in the ice sledge hockey, five minutes into the third quarter.\n\nCurling update\n\n18:05 All done in the curling, with Great Britain beating Norway 7-3. Canada defeated China 8-5, and the United States edged Finland 7-6.\n\n17:51 A big score of four in the seventh end saw Slovakia concede their curling match with an end to play, losing 9-3 to Sweden.\n\nIn the other three matches, we're into the final ends. Great Britain have a 7-3 lead over Norway, while Canada have recovered from a slow start to lead China 7-5. The United States have a 7-5 advantage over Finland.\n\n17:46 Second period up, and Russia maintain their 2-0 lead in the ice sledge hockey. If they win the match, they'll top the group.\n\n17:22 Russia are now 2-0 up on the United States, and there are plenty of smiling faces in the crowd.\n\n\"The beginning of the game will be the hardest. We can't make mistakes. It'll be easier to play after that.\"\n\n- Russian defenceman Vladimir Litvinenko ahead of today's ice sledge hockey grudge match against the USA.\n\n17:01 And that's the first period up. Russia lead the United States 1-0.\n\n16:56 A huge roar inside the Shayba Arena as Russia, with the advantage of a two-man power play, score. Ilia Volkov is the man to break the deadlock.\n\n16:52 It's goalless as we enter the final five minutes of the ice sledge hockey match between the United States and Russia. Both teams are through to the semi-finals, but topping the group, and a fair bit of pride, is at stake.\n\n16:35 We're up and running at the Shayba Arena for a tasty ice sledge hockey encounter between the United States and Russia.\n\n16:32 Back to the curling, where all four matches are into the fourth end.\n\nGreat Britain lead Norway 2-1, while Sweden have a 4-1 advantage over Slovakia. China have taken a surprise 3-0 lead on Canada, with the Untied States 2-1 up on Finland.\n\n16:29 The final skier completes his run in the slalom sitting event, to make it 12 of 26 who made it to the finish line on a brutal course in brutal conditions.\n\n16:23 As an illustration of just how difficult conditions have been out on the slopes, just 10 of 24 men have finished the slalom sitting event, with a couple more to race.\n\n16:04 Double Sochi gold medallist Akira Kano Japan crashes out, like many before him. He is, fortunately, OK. Straight after him, another Japanese skier, Takeshi Suzuki, goes the wrong side of one of the gates and has to stop his run.\n\n16:00 We've had plenty of fallers in deteriorating conditions at the Alpine Centre.\n\nThree men's slalom races in the super combined are being held. Valerii Redkozubov of Russia topped the timesheets in the visually impaired event, while another Russian, Alexey Bugaev, has a 1.87 lead going into Friday's super-G in the standing category.\n\nThe sitting event is ongoing, with Roman Rabl of Austria haven just taken the lead by half a second from Germany's Thomas Nolte.\n\n15:46 Our sporting fix for now comes from the Ice Cube, where four curling matches are being played.\n\nCanada will be looking to get back on track after their first defeat of the Games to Norway yesterday, as they play China. Norway take on Great Britain, who lost by a huge margin to Finland earlier today. Finland face the United States, while Sweden play Slovakia.\n\n15:42 The big one in the ice sledge hockey, the Untied States versus Russia, is on at 16:30.\n\n15:39 Norway have beaten Sweden 2-0 in their ice sledge hockey battle of the Scandinavians. That should see Norway into the semi-finals.\n\nMedals table latest\n\n15:32 That wraps up the medal action for today, but there's still plenty more sport to come.\n\nIt's been a mighty day for Russia, who have won four golds in biathlon. Ukraine and Germany also won a biathlon gold apiece.\n\nWe had been due to see six gold medals won in alpine skiing, but the second runs in the super combined have been delayed until Friday because of the fog.\n\nAll that means Russia are the runaway leaders at the head of the medals table, with 11 gold. Germany are next up with four gold, while Ukraine sit in third with three gold.\n\nSee the table in full here.\n\n15:22 Vitaliy Lukyanenko of Ukraine wins gold in the men's 12.5km visually impaired biathlon. Silver goes to Russian Nikolay Polukhin, who was 10.3 seconds behind the winner, with bronze won by Vasili Shaptsiaboi of Belarus.\n\n15:10 It could be yet another biathlon gold for Russia as the men edge towards completing the 12.5km visually impaired race. Vitaliy Lukyanenko of Ukraine leads, but Nikolay Polukhin of Russia is clipping at his heels, trailing by 7.2 seconds. One more visit to the shooting range to come.\n\n15:04 Biathlon gold number four on day four for Russia, as Mikhalina Lysova wins the 10km visually impaired race from team-mate Iuliia Budaleeva. Oksana Shyshkova of Ukraine claims bronze.\n\n14:54 Russian Mikhalina Lysova maintains her lead in the women's biathlon race, with countrywoman Iuliia Budaleeva more than 50 seconds behind.\n\n14:52 The four women contesting the 10km visually impaired biathlon are approaching the shooting range for a third time. Four visits will be made in total.\n\n14:49 It's a German 1-2 in the women's sitting slalom, with just 0.31 seconds separating Anna Schaffelhuber and Anna-Lena Forster.\n\n14:45 The men's 12.5km visually impaired biathlon is about to begin. Ten athletes going for gold in this race.\n\n14:41 Mikhalina Lysova of Russia is the early leader in the biathlon after shooting cleanly in her first visit to the range.\n\n14:38 A bit of reshuffling going on in the alpine skiing programme, but we now understand the super-G runs in the super combined will be held on Friday. That will be a three-day wait between runs for the men and women competing in the six events.\n\n14:36 We're off in the women's 10km for visually impaired biathletes. Two Ukrainians and two Russians make up the start list.\n\n14:32 The women's standing slalom run ends with Marie Bochet of France on top ahead of Andrea Rothfuss of Germany.\n\n14:26 Russia are having a blinder today, with three biathlon golds lifting their total Sochi haul to 10, and 31 medals in total. See the table in full here.\n\n14:24 Two more sets of medals to be won today, both in biathlon. The women's 10km visually impaired race sets off at 14:30, with the men's 12.5km visually impaired racers joining them on the course 15 minutes later.\n\n14:21 The women's standing slalom is well underway. Double Sochi gold medallist Marie Bochet of France currently leads.\n\n14:09 Aleksandra Frantceva of Russia leads Australia's Melissa Perrine after the slalom runs. They'll be back for the super-G tomorrow.\n\n14:08 Jade Etherington of Great Britain has a silver and a bronze from these Games so far, and she slots into third after her run.\n\n14:05 The slalom run in the women's visually impaired race has begun. Defending Paralympic champion Henrieta Farkasova of Slovakia missed the last gate and is set to be disqualified. Kelly Gallagher, who won Britain's first ever Winter Paralympic gold yesterday in the super-G, fell and is out.\n\n14:03 It's gold for Azat Karachurin of Russia, who beats defending champion Nils Erik Ulset of Norway by 54.6 seconds in the men's 12.5km standing biathlon. Mark Arendz of Canada takes the bronze.\n\n13:57 Nearly time for the slalom runs in the super combined after an improvement in conditions. A reminder that the super-G runs, the times from which are combined with the slalom to decide the medals, have been rescheduled for tomorrow.\n\n13:55 Race leader Azat Karachurin has to take a penalty loop after a miss in the final round of shooting. Nils Erik Ulset misses two targets.\n\n13:49 Perfect shooting from Russian Azat Karachurin, who now leads Nils Erik Ulset of Norway by 15.1 seconds as they head for a fourth and final visit to the shooting range.\n\n13:43 Defending Paralympic champion Nils Erik Ulset of Norway lies in second as the men's 12.5km standing biathlon approaches half-distance. Azat Karachurin of, yes you guessed it, Russia, leads by 6.5 seconds.\n\n13:38 A second biathlon gold of the day for Russia, this time courtesy of Alena Kaufman in the women's 10km standing. Oleksandra Kononova of Ukraine wins silver, with an exhausted Natalia Bratiuk of Russia securing bronze.\n\n13:35 A quick update from the Shayba Arena, where Norway and Sweden are goalless at the end of the first period in their decisive ice sledge hockey match.\n\n13:34 Alena Kaufman shoots clear for a third straight time, and holds a 28.1 second lead over Oleksandra Kononova of Ukraine, who has moved back into second.\n\n13:33 The cameras are having trouble picking up the athletes as they look into the distance amidst the fog.\n\n13:31 A miss for 16-year-old Natalia Bratiuk of Russia in the final round of shooting, handing even more of an advantage to her countrywoman.\n\n13:29 The men's 12.5km standing biathlon is just getting going, so plenty of athletes out on the course. Eighteen men in the 12.5km race.\n\n13:28 Alena Kaufman takes the lead over her Russian team-mate, she has 10 seconds in her pocket.\n\n13:24 A wobble for Ukrainian Oleksandra Kononova, who misses a target on her third visit to the shooting range. She loses her lead, and now trails Natalia Bratiuk of Russia by 4.7 seconds. Still all to play for.\n\n13:18 The lead of Ukraine's Oleksandra Kononova is cut to 8.3 seconds by Natalia Bratiuk of Russia at the halfway point in the biathlon. \"Sledge Hockey makes wheelchair rugby look genteel. Bumper cars + bit of Rollerball + off the puck sporting violence.\"\n\n- Four-times Olympic gold medal-winning rower Matthew Pinsent.\n\n13:13 Oleksandra Kononova of Ukraine is the early pace setter in the biathlon, shooting clear in the first of four rounds. She leads by 12.6 seconds from Russian Natalia Bratiuk.\n\nIce sledge hockey - how things stand\n\n13:05 Today sees the last set of round robin matches in the ice sledge hockey. Norway are currently playing Sweden, with the winner likely to make it through to the semi-finals. The top two in each group advance, which the remaining teams contending classification play-offs.\n\nCanada and the Czech Republic play later - that match could decide the winner of Group A, but Canada have a far superior goal difference. The United States and Russia are the current top two in Group B. They play each other later in what is a mouth-watering encounter.\n\n13:02 Canadian Caroline Bisson, who tweeted earlier about the visibility issues, gets the women's 10km standing biathlon underway.\n\n12:55 Thirteen women will compete for the medals in the biathlon, including four from Ukraine and three from Russia.\n\n12:51 Pleased to say the sport, after a brief lull, is round the corner with the women's 10km standing biathlon beginning in a few minutes.\n\nNorway versus Sweden in the ice sledge hockey also gets underway on the hour. \"So Super-G part of Super Combined is postponed, Slalom will go ahead at 14:00 local time depending on the weather.\"\n\n- Paralympics GB confirm the news from earlier.\n\n12:37 There were a few fisticuffs earlier between a Korean and an Italian ice sledge hockey player as their match ended. The referee had to intervene, with Italy's victory clouded by some ugly scenes.\n\nHow far can you see?\n\n12:32 The fog has played its part in today's action, whether it be biathletes peering through fog on the shooting range, or skiers contending with multiple delays to their races. Here's what it's been like up in the mountains today in pictures.\n\n12:19 The slalom in the super combined has been confirmed for a 14:00 start according to the Canadian Paralympic Committee. Perhaps the fog is finally lifting after all.\n\n12:14 And with that, it's gone suddenly quiet in Sochi. We're hoping the fog will lift so we can get some skiing action in today - it must be a frustrating and nervy time for the athletes, who will have readied themselves for a morning run that has been delayed by two hours and counting.\n\nOur next sporting action is at 13:00, when medals will be won in the women's 10km standing biathlon. It will then get pretty busy at the Laura Cross-country Ski & Biathlon Centre, with another three races in less than two hours.\n\nWe will also have more ice sledge hockey to enjoy, with our second of four matches on day four. Vancouver 2010 bronze medallists Norway face Sweden at the Shayba Arena.\n\n12:08 Russia have won their curling match against Sweden 7-4, to complete the morning's action at the Ice Cube. That result puts Russia top of the round robin standings with five wins and one defeat, but they have played one more match than Canada who lie in second and play later. Their match versus China is one of four which get underway at 15:30.\n\n12:03 The slalom runs in the super combined have been postponed until 14:00, but there's no guarantee the fog will clear. We understand the super-G runs will be held tomorrow.\n\n11:55 Korea, who were 4-0 down against Slovakia in the curling, have turned things around to win 7-4. A big score of four in the sixth end saw Korea take an ultimately unassailable lead.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia lead Sweden 7-4 as they play the final end. Russia have the hammer, so look likely to chalk up another win.\n\n11:47 In the Shayba Arena, Italy have won their ice sledge hockey encounter with Korea 2-1.\n\n11:44 Great Britain have thrown in the towel with an end to go in the curling, going down 13-4 in their match against Finland.\n\nSome skiing cancelled\n\n11:38 The super-G part of the super combined has been cancelled for today because of the fog. Organisers still hope the slalom will go ahead later if the fog clears. The times in the slalom run will be combined with the times in the super-G run to decide the medallists in each of the six events. The slalom runs, the second part of today's scheduled alpine action, were set to begin from 16:00.\n\n11:36 A fifth gold medal in eight then for Russia in the biathlon so far, and still four more sets of medals to be won today. The first of those will be at 13:00 with the women's 10km standing.\n\n11:33 Russian dominance in the biathlon continues. Roman Petushkov heads a 1-2-3 for the nation, with Alexey Bychenok winning silver and Grigory Murygin claiming bronze in the men's 12.5km sitting biathlon.\n\n11:25 It's a Russian 1-2-3 as the biathletes power towards the finish line.\n\n11:22 Roman Petushkov remains ahead in the biathlon, with a 24.1 second lead over Russian team-mate Alexey Bychenok as they enter the range for a final time.\n\n11:17 On the range for a third time now in the men's 12.5km sitting.\n\n11:14 Here's a curling scoreline you don't here too often - Finland 13, Great Britain one after five ends. Britain, who will surely concede before long, play Norway later.\n\n11:12 It's a Russian 1-2 with Roman Petushkov, one of a handful of athletes to have shot clear on both visits to the range, leading the men's 12.5km sitting. He holds a 13.8 advantage over Alexey Bychenok.\n\nA blanket of fog\n\n11:07 As biathlete Caroline Bisson wrote on Twitter earlier (scroll down to 10:55), visibility is a real issue as the fog hangs in the air. The alpine skiing programme has been delayed, but the biathlon schedule is going ahead as planned, for now.\n\n11:03 Russia have won four of the seven biathlon golds so far at their home Paralympics. They also have five silver and a bronze. Ukraine are the next best-performing biathlon nation, with one gold, one silver and four bronze. With four athletes in the 12.5km sitting on now, Russia have a decent chance of adding to that impressive haul.\n\n11:00 Still no sign of the alpine skiing getting underway - pesky fog is making visibility far too dangerous to send them hurtling down a hill at ridiculous speeds.\n\n10:57 As with all the biathlon races, there is a staggered start time, so each athlete takes to the course 30 seconds apart from each other. There are four visits to the shooting range in the men's 12.5km sitting event, and they're approaching the first of them now.\n\n10:55 An unusual change of personnel in the curling. Alternate Angie Malone has replaced British captain Aileen Neilson - no indication why at the moment. They trail Finland 8-1 playing the fifth of eight ends. \"Thick fog covers the trails / range ahead of the 10K Biathlon. May not be able to see the targets!\"\n\n- Canadian Caroline Bisson, who competes in the women's 10km standing biathlon at 13:00 today.\n\n10:49 It remains advantage Italy as they play the second period of their ice sledge hockey match, holding a slender 1-0 lead over Korea.\n\nCurling update\n\n10:48 It's the halfway point in the three curling matches being played this morning, and this is where we are with them.\n\nRussia have edged in front in their match against Sweden, holding a 3-2 lead, while Slovakia have a comfortable 4-0 lead over Korea.\n\nGreat Britain are having a mini-disaster in their match against current bottom side Finland, who have yet to win a match. The Finns are up 8-1.\n\n10:44 Just a few minutes to gather our thoughts, four to be exact, before the men's 12.5km sitting biathlon begins. Nineteen men going for gold in this one.\n\n10:42 That's Germany's fourth gold of these Games - no silver or bronze as yet. They sit second, behind Russia, in the medals table.\n\n10:39 Gold for Anja Wicker of Germany in the women's 10km sitting biathlon. Silver goes to Russian Svetlana Konovalova, with Lyudmyla Pavlenko of Ukraine in third.\n\n10:34 Anja Wicker now enjoys an almost 50-second lead over Svetlana Konovalova in the women's 10km sitting biathlon. Lyudmyla Pavlenko of Ukraine has edged into third.\n\n10:32 Svetlana Konovalova misses one shot, while Akzhana Abdikarimova joins Anja Wicker in shooting clear in all four visits to the range.\n\n10:31 Brilliant stuff from Anja Wicker, who has shot clear for a fourth time in four. A final push to the line, and it's hard to see her being caught from here.\n\n10:28 One final visit to the shooting range for Anja Wicker to hold her nerve. Defending Paralympic champion Maria Iovleva, of Russia, is having a nightmare out there.\n\n10:27 Akzhana Abdikarimova, the only other athlete to have shot clear in all three visits to the range, is currently third but a full minute adrift of her Russian team-mate in second.\n\n10:26 Russian Svetlana Konovalova missed one of her shots on her third visit to the range, and slips behind German Anja Wicker - who shoots clear - by 17.9 seconds. \"Off to training & it's a little foggy...! And I look like a frog in my rain coat #hurryup&wait\"\n\n- Australian alpine skier Jess Gallagher is battling mother nature.\n\n10:20 It's Svetlana Konovalova of Russia who leads at the halfway stage of the biathlon. German Anja Wicker trails her by nine seconds.\n\n10:18 There are four visits to the shooting range in the women's 10km sitting biathlon. Five women have shot clear after two visits, and defending Paralympic champion Maria Iovleva of Russia is not among them, but she's still in the mix.\n\nFog update\n\n10:16 Action at the Alpine Centre has been delayed further, until at least 11:00, because of the fog that still hangs over the slopes.\n\nLet's hope we do get some action up there today, as plenty was promised from the six medal events.\n\n10:15 Italy have taken a 1-0 lead over Korea in the ice sledge hockey.\n\n10:13 Andrea Eskau of Germany is one of seven women to have shot clear in the 10km biathlon - still all to play for.\n\n10:08 A wobbly start for Great Britain in the curling, who trail Finland 5-0 after two ends. Finland are currently rooted to the bottom of the table with four defeats in four, while Britain are third, behind only Canada and Russia.\n\nRussia and Sweden are locked at 1-1, with Slovakia 2-0 up on Korea.\n\n10:04 The fog is not isolated to the Alpine Centre, but the scheduled biathlon action is running as planned. It's the women's 10km sitting first up, with 10 women going for gold including all three from the Vancouver 2010 podium.\n\nFog forces delay\n\n09:54 The skiing at the Alpine Centre has been delayed, with a thick layer of fog making it impossible to send the skiers out.\n\nOfficials have postponed running until at least 06:30, but it'd be a surprise if the fog lifted that quickly. There is a scheduled rest day for the alpine skiers tomorrow, which, if worse comes to worse, could be used to run events that can't be held today.\n\n09:50 At the same time as that race gets underway, the first run in the women's super combined super-G for visually impaired skiers will also be held. Britain's gold medal winner from yesterday, Kelly Gallagher, will be one of six in this event.\n\n09:45 Our first medal action of the day will be on the hour with the women's 10km sitting biathlon. The medallists from Vancouver 2010 are all in this event, which sees 10 women compete. Russian Maria Iovleva will be aiming to defend her gold, while Olena Iurkovska of Ukraine will hope to go one better than four years ago. Andrea Eskau of Germany, bronze medallist at the last Paralympics, is one of two Germans in this race.\n\n09:40 It's goalless in the early stages of Korea versus Italy in the ice sledge hockey.\n\n09:34 The first stones are being sent towards the house, as the trio of curling matches begin at the Ice Cube.\n\n09:27 In ice sledge hockey, which had a break yesterday, it is Korea versus Italy in the early game.\n\n09:26 This morning's three curling matches see Russia face Sweden, Great Britain against Finland, and Korea versus Slovakia.\n\nAfter Canada's first defeat of the competition to Norway yesterday, they now sit tied at the top of the table with Russia - both with four wins and one defeat. Great Britain and Slovakia are level in third with three wins and one defeat.\n\nThe top four countries after the round robin matches are completed will advance to the semi-finals.\n\nDay four in a nutshell\n\n09:16 So what lies in store today? Here, in a nutshell, is how the day is set to pan out.\n\nSix of today's 12 gold medals will be won in super combined super-G skiing, three for the men, three for the women. Each event will feature two runs, with the quickest combined time winning. The first runs in the six races take place from 10:00 to 12:00. The second runs, which will decide the medals in each race, start at 16:00 with the women's super combined slalom with super-G for visually impaired skiers. The final gold medal on offer today in alpine skiing will be won from 17:35.\n\nWe also have a busy day up at the Laura Cross-country Ski & Biathlon Centre, with six sets of medals available. The first race, the women's 10km sitting, sets off at 10:00. The final race of the day sets off at 14:45.\n\nThree of seven wheelchair curling matches begin in a few minutes, and we also have four ice sledge hockey matches, the first of which also gets underway in a few minutes.\n\nYesterday's history-makers\n\n09:09 Before we fully fix our field of focus to the next 12 hours or so, it's worth reflecting on some of the history that was made yesterday.\n\nCanada's Brian McKeever won his eighth cross-country Paralympic gold medal in the 20km visually impaired, his 11th in total - which includes a bronze in biathlon.\n\nIt was also a day that saw Great Britain break their gold medal duck at a Winter Paralympic Games, with Kelly Gallgaher giving the nation its first ever win. You can relive the day's action by taking a look through our blog from yesterday here.\n\n09:05 A busy day of sporting actions lies ahead, with 12 sets of medals to be won across alpine skiing and biathlon over the next few hours.\n\nWe also have seven wheelchair curling matches, and four ice sledge hockey ties to look forward to.\n\n09:00 Hello and welcome to day four of the Sochi 2014 Winter Paralympics,"
