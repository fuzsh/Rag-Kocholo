        "text": "Georgia will have a huge Eurovision show, not just a party, but a cut-throat competition between 12 very professional songs. I can’t decide for my favourite.\n\nHere are some of them, all ready to fight for their right to represent Georgia in Belgrade. To be decided on 1 March.\n\nSalome Korkotashvili – Captaine. That’s by far and away my top favourite, unless it turns out she can’t sing it live. A jolly wee song, which, if combined with a nice show, can go to the Final.\n\n3G – I’m free. Oh, yes! Three girls singing like mad, ala-Anastasia, though her voice is muck more hoarse, thus, more effective. An upbeat pop-rock track, very professional and well-performed.\n\nSalome Gasviani – Share your love. Salome is talented girl, who could easily convince you that Georgia is the cradle of world music. We’ve seen ballads with a distinct American sound, failing to perform well at Eurovision, but who knows. This time, it might be the year of the ballads. Well done!\n\nAleko Berdzenishvili – The beautiful girl. People out these seem to be hugely influenced by music from the US. But, correct me if I’m wrong, but isn’t this song amazingly beautiful?! Slightly irritating male vocal, which we can get used to if performed in a huge hall with nice acoustics. And he can for sure sing live.\n\nTika Patsatsia – Never change. Singer, dancer, TV presenter, Miss Georgia. A bad rock girl! Shall we add – a potential ESC Georgia winner?\n\nThe rest are:\n\nVIVO – Life\n\nDiana Gurtskaya – Peace Will Come\n\nIrakli Pirtskhalava – Freedom\n\nTeatroni – Georgia invites friends\n\nTako Gachechiladze – Me and my funky\n\nGuga Aptsiauri – Don’t look at me\n\nTamta Chelidze – Give me your love\n\nMore are coming, so that by the end of the month we’ll have all the winners of the local ‘Eurovisions’ across Europe. Here’s some of the winners worth noting.\n\nAlbania: Olta Boka – Zemrën E Lamë Peng\n\nAlbania will compete with a nice ballad in Albanian. It’s a pity I can’t get a word, but there’s no need to: the female vocal is resolute yet mild. Could be better in terms of composition, but I reckon many people will like it.\n\nAndorra: Gisela – Casanova\n\nWonder if this is the present state of the Eurovision Song Contest?! Andorra seems to be a million years away from Eurovision. This year’s representative of the small principality is Gisela – a cheerful girl – and I guess she’ll offer a “fairy-tale” show in Belgrade telling us about romance and the historical lover Casanova. But haven’t we heard this type of song many times already…\n\nAzerbaijan: Elnur Guseynov and Samir Javadzadeh – Day After Day\n\nThere’s been a huge support for Azerbaijan’s debut in Eurovision: Eurovision stars, like Ukrainian diva Ruslana and Serbian winner Maria Serifovic, from across Europe joined in to say “Welcome” to one of three new-comers this year. In Belgrade we’ll see a male duet who, with heavy odds against them on part of the other two competitors, managed to grab the trophy. As for the song – pop-rock supported by high vocals, correct me if I’m wrong, influenced to a degree by the Russian school.\n\nBelarus: Ruslan Alenho – Hasta La Vista\n\nDoes he stand a chance to win this-year’s ESC? Who knows, but Belarus has always been capable of surprising the audience. Yes, it’s good. Yes, he sings like a god, and yes – there are people in Minsk who can write good songs.\n\nCyprus: Evdokia Kadi – Femme Fatale\n\nCyprus can’s stop experimenting. Not even after a series of losses for one of the countries who’ve invested so much in Eurovision. Evdokia Kadi sings in Greek, for a change, what’s really notable having in mind what we’ve heard from Aphrodite’s island recently (in 2006, Annet Artani performed a typically American song, which sounded truly out of place, at least to me. Last year, Evridiki with her experiment in French – Comme ci comme ca did not even qualify to the Final). The traditional music that Evdokia has to offer seems to be much less annoying.\n\nCzech Republic: Tereza Kerndlová – Have Some Fun\n\nPrague sends to Belgrade a lift-me-up song. It does sounds like Nellie Furtado, doesn’t it? It strikes me as one of the few songs selected so far that can become a European hit, if nothing else. Keep it going, Tereza!\n\nDenmark: Simon Mathew – All Night Long\n\nPurely European sound, party atmosphere, cool looks, a naughty cheeky band – the recipe for good mood, if not for anything else. For me, this song embodies the spirit of Eurovision. Sing along:\n\n“The sun is up\n\nI’m feeling great\n\nI’m just enjoying life\n\nRight here in the shade…”\n\nEstonia: Kreisiraadio – Leto Svet\n\nVerka Serduchka in a mock pop-jazz-seventies-ridicule version, multiplied by three. Okay, it can be fun, it can be a show, but where’s the music gone? It packed and embarked on a long journey? Of course many people will vote for them, and why not But it’s not surprising in its goal to shock us with its “craziness”. Have a look at the British entries recently for inspiration, and you’ll get what I mean.\n\nHungary: Csézy – Szívverés\n\nThis is an ultimate romantic song. I can’t keep looking at Csézy’s dress though, it’s so distracting. I do hope she’ll make up to put on something simpler during the show Well done on the language front!\n\nLithuania: Jerominas Milius – Nomads In The Night\n\nOne thing is for sure – Lithuania keep surprising us.\n\nMalta: Morena – Vodka\n\nWell, if there is anyone who can help Malta out of trouble and bring it to the Final, that’s Vodka. Cheers\n\nNorway: Maria Haukaas Storeng – Hold on be strong\n\nScandinavia again offers a little piece of valuable music. Miss Storeng knows what and how to sing it – a track that appeals to all tastes. It can make you picture the Aurora Borealis though it’s not terribly romantic.\n\nSlovenia: Rebeka Dremelj – Vrag Naj Vzame\n\nRebeka won Ema 2008 and here she is, representing Slovenia. She did it thanks to a pop song, a couple of backing vocals and.. good (to some) looks. Yet another song in a native language. Great!\n\nTurkey: Mor ve Ötesi – Deli\n\nA melodic rock track won the Turkish national selection and is eventually going to Serbia. What more can we want after years of typically traditional music mixed with modern elements that Turkey had to offer to the Eurovision audiences in recent years? A nice sensual male vocal supported by an energetic band – it can turn out to be a nice show.\n\nThe end of January seems to be rather tempting for holding national finals for the Eurovision Song Contest. And it will become even busier at the end of February, and beginning of March. Keeping track of all the songs that get selected to represent their country is fun, but can be a bit difficult given the great number of pre-selection and selection stages in every country and the even greater number of ESC participants this year.\n\nA variety of styles, a motley of music genres, vocal skills, choreographies, tempos, and lyrics – that’s what we’ve had so far at the national finals. Last week saw a number of finalists, who already won their tickets to Belgrade. Who are they?\n\nSo much fuss around the national selection in Malta! Just like every year, right! Severe competition on the part of distinguished and venerable local Eurovision artists and an unclear end of the story were just part of the picture. Eventually, Morena, with her cheerful, up-tempo, and upbeat song Vodka managed to win the credit and hearts of most of the Maltese people and so they sent her to Belgrade.\n\nIn the Czech Republic Tereza Kerndlová became first in the national selection with the song Have Some Fun – a jolly up-tempo composition, reminding me of Nelly Furtado’s recent style. After last-year’s first and not particularly successful participation of the Czech Republic, this year, they haven’t given up and offer us a Slavic beauty with a fantastic disco hit.\n\nRuslan Alehno won Eurofest 2008 and will compete for Belarus with a song in English with the melodious Spanish title Hasta La Vista (Good bye). Mr. Alehno does not sound like Arnold Schwarzenegger, but his song can surely be a ‘terminator’ for most of the competitors during the Contest in Belgrade.\n\nOtherwise, earlier in the Eurovision selection period, Albania chose its 2008 Eurovision entrant during Festivali i Kenges: Olta Boka with a touching and vigorous ballad in Albanian, Zemren e lame peng (We Gambled with our Hearts). 20-year-old pop star Sirusho will go to Belgrade for Armenia. She is currently working on a couple of songs, one of which will be selected to represent the country in Serbia in May. Her voice seems to be able to easily take on amazingly complex performances with an Oriental tinge, so typical for this part of Eastern Europe.\n\nWomen this year seem rather obsessed with grand names from history. Andorra, for example, will go for Eurovision with Gisela‘s Casanova. One of Morena’s, song was called Casanova as well. And Claudia Faniello, (aka Fabrizio Faniello’s sister), who also competed in the Maltese national selection, performed a song dedicated to the great painter Caravaggio.\n\nBack to the Balkans, Bosnia & Herzegovina will be represented at Eurosong 2008 by Elvir Lakovic Laka and his song Pokusaj (Try). Nobody knows what the song is like because it won’t be aired until 3 March. Having checked out his crazy style, however, we can only expect the unexpected. This year for Eurovision, Turkey will rely on the unconventional sound and vision: TRT have charged the alternative rock band Mor ve Ötesi with the mission to defend Turkey’s Eurovision honour.\n\nMore on recently-selected Eurovision artists is yet to come.\n\nA year of debuts and love: Sweden takes off with a massive national selection for the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest in Belgrade.\n\nHere is a list of artists and towns, hosting the two semifinals, the second-chance show, and the grand final of the Swedish Eurosong:\n\nGöteborg, 9 February 2008\n\nFace-84 — Alla gamla x\n\nVelvet — Deja vû\n\nChrister Sjögren — I Love Europe\n\nE-type and the Poodles — Line Of Fire\n\nBrandur — Lullaby\n\nMichael Michailoff — That’s Love\n\nSuzzie Tapper — Visst finns mirakel\n\nFace-84 are four girls, all born in 1984, hence the name of the band. Velvet is not new to the Eurovision stage. She participated in 2006 Melodifestival with “Mi amore” with little success. Hope that this year she won’t have a “deja-vu”.Christer is famous Swedish dance and rock singer. He is mostly known as lead vocal singer in the Swedish dance-band Vikingarna, where he sang between 1978-2004. E-type and the Poodles can safely be called the Swedish DJ Bobbo, and Michael Michailoff is famous for recording an acoustic version of ABBA’s Lay All Your Love On Me\n\nVästerås, den 16 februari 2008\n\nAlexander Schöld — Den första svalan\n\nLasse Lindh — Du behöver aldrig mer vara rädd\n\nSanna Nielsen — Empty Room\n\nRongedal — Just A Minute\n\nAndra Generationen — Kebabpizza Slivovitza\n\nOla — Love In Stereo\n\nThe Nicole — Razborka\n\nHad it not been for the stars Christer Sjögren and E-type & the Poodles, the 2008 would have been the year of debuts. Of the 28 candidates, there are 17 new artists, which is an exceptionally high figure. Also, this seems to be the year of bands – more than half of the candidates participating for the trophy are bands. The artist who fits in both the categories is the debutant band Andra Generationen that participate with the song “Kebabpizza Slivovitza”. They mix Swedish lyrics with typically Balkan music – a fascinating combination to listen to.\n\nThere are some other artists with previous experience at the Eurovision. One of them is Sanna Nielsen with the song “Empty room” – a ballad that, according to the singer, goes straightly into the heart.. She participated with the song Vågar du, vågar jag at last-year’s Melodiafestival.\n\nLinköping, den 23 februari 2008\n\nMickey Huskic — Izdajice\n\nAinbusk — Jag saknar dig ibland\n\nBWO — Lay Your Love On Me\n\nCaracola — Smiling In Love\n\nPatrik Isaksson — Under mitt tunna skinn\n\nFrida — Upp o hoppa\n\nThérèse Andersson — When You Need Me\n\nKarlskrona, den 1 mars 2008\n\nCharlotte Perrelli — Hero\n\nLinda Bengtzing — Hur svårt kan d va\n\nNordman — I lågornas sken\n\nCalaisa — If I Could\n\nFronda — Ingen mår så bra som jag\n\nDaniel Mitsogiannis — Pame\n\nSibel — That Is Where I’ll Go\n\nHere are the dates, when you need to watch SVT closely:\n\nSemifinal: 23 February, 2008 in Cloetta Center, Linköping\n\nSemifinal: 1 March, 2008 in Telenor Arena, Karlskrona\n\nSecond Chance: 8 March, 2008 in Arena Arctica, Kiruna\n\nFinal: 15 March, 2008 in Globen, Stockholm\n\nMelodifestival is a four-part competition. The final will be held in the early spring of 2008. Two of the stages will be held in Kiruna and Vasteras – two towns that had not hosted the competition before. The towns of Linköping and Karlskrona are not so fresh in the Contest, but for Gothenburg it will be the sixth time to host the show. Stockholm, is naturally the most experienced: it will be the final city of Melodiafestival for a seventh time.\n\nIt’s so great to be part of the show, and to be in Sweden during the Melodiafestival. The atmosphere in the town in party-like, and it gives glitter to the streets and entertainment to the inhabitants and guests of the Scandinavian country. Enjoy it!\n\nIt takes a lot of time to think all over the events that poured on me during the Junior Eurovision Song Contest, held in Rotterdam at the beginning of December. In a cliché – a magnificent show that takes your breath away. Clichés aside, when you’re part of this dreamy getaway, the excitement is all the more serious.\n\nUpon arrival, I enter a hotel full of mad kids – a wave of colours and joy floating from corner to corner, no rest. The week starts with make-up, shooting of postcards, recording of a joint song “One World”, and interviews for the co-producer UNICEF. The kids are excited, sing running up and down the corridors of the hotel, pose for the cameras patiently, and enjoy every moment of their stay.\n\nAll 17 delegations have worked hard get to Rotterdam. Everybody is very friendly despite the tension. Every child has been trained to smile, sing, give interviews and behave. Kids who are more adults than I am. And still you can see their infantile psychology in their lovely childish smiles, in their failure to hide envy or suppress irritation with people trying to cajole them.\n\nI can’t wait to see the hall. Ahoy Arena doesn’t strike me as an amazingly beautiful building from the outside, but it has a surprise for me inside. The kids love it from first sight, and they start walking around it as if they were born on the stage and there is nothing intimidating in it. During the rehearsals, the cameras work hard to capture all their movements and happiness and it’s so much fun to see how the juniors flirt with them. Everybody is pleased with the results. Wherever problems there are, you have to solve them immediately and move on as the concert night is knocking on the door.\n\nTens of rehearsals, hours of dancing and singing… the ice is already broken, also after a day at the ice rink that the organizers have prepared for the young artists. It’s amazing how all children sing the songs of their ‘competitors’. I meet the kids from Romania, who ‘breath in, breath out’ the Dutch song, Lithuanian juniors who mumble the romantic rhymes of the Portuguese song, the charming representative of Cyprus, who sings refrains of the joint song “One World”, the girls from Bulgaria, singing the Swedish song “Nu eller aldrig”. It’s the ultimate non-competition.\n\nBut it is a contest after all. During the Dress Rehearsal on Friday, all kids are mega excited, you can see their hearts beating wild, but still there is nothing like tense silence hanging in the air. Some of them channel the tension playing at PlayStation, others lie round the floor on colourful cushions, others hug the presents they’ve received from other participants, still others exchange emails, clutching at their precious notebooks containing tens of contacts, some ever cry with thrill.\n\nThe Dress Rehearsal itself goes smoothly. The kids are already tired after a week of rehearsals, and they’re quick to go to bed. No disco tonight.\n\nBut the Contest itself is much more entertaining for the audience, and much more stressful for the participants and their delegations. No technical problems cast a gloom on the event – all 17 songs are performed with zest and energy. All kids are dressed in their Sunday bests, they smile and take pictures and again I have to note how calm and cheerful they are. No trace of competition. The Green Room is a sea of flags and smiling faces. It’s next to the stage and it’s made of the benches the children painted earlier during the week. They give a huge applause for their favourite songs – and it seems like not a single song is out of the “Favourite List”. It’s fascinating how the kids know the lyrics of all the songs, all of them in a foreign language, and they sing along with infinite artistic commotion no matter if the lyrics are correct or not. The mood is hyper cheerful. And everyone is happy when Alexey Zhigalkovich from Belarus with the song S Druzyami (With Friends) wins the 2007 Junior Eurovision Song Contest. No one thinks there is anything unfair or corrupt in the competition. They take it as grown-ups, but in a better way.\n\nYou can leave everything behind after you’ve seen 17 teams joining together in such a show. Noble is not a good word to describe their attitude. It’s just so very natural, lacking in posture. I bet the kids miss a lot from their childhood – we can argue on this issue day in day out. But we can’t disregard the facts that they enjoy it, and that the JESC is a grand chance for their future; nor can we ignore the fun, the incessant medley of various languages, the bubble of friendship and sympathy, and the precious memories dressed in glamour and gloss the event in Rotterdam must have left in everyone.\n\nMeet you next year in Lemasos!\n\n17 countries will compete for the trophy at the fifth anniversary Junior Eurovision Song Contest, to be held on 8 December in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.\n\nHere is the final running order:\n\nGeorgia – Mari Romelashvili – Odelia Ranuni\n\nBelgium – TRUST – Anders (Differently)\n\nArmenia – AREVIK – Erazanq (A Dream)\n\nCyprus – Yiorgos Ioannides – I Musiki Dini Ftera (Music Gives You Wings)\n\nPortugal – Jorge Leiria – Só Quero É Cantar (I Only Want To Sing)\n\nRussia – Alexandra Golovchenko – Otlichnitsa (An Excellent Pupil)\n\nRomania – 4KIDS – Sha-la-la\n\nBulgaria – BON-BON – BonBolandia (Land Of Candy)\n\nSerbia – Nevena Božovi? – Piši Mi (Write To Me)\n\nNetherlands – Lisa, Amy & Shelley – Adem In, Adem Uit (Breath In, Breath Out)\n\nFYR Macedonia – Rosica & Dimitar – Ding Ding Dong\n\nUkraine – Ilona Galitska – Urok Glamuru (Lesson Of Glamour)\n\nSweden – Frida Sandén – Nu Eller Aldrig (Now Or Never)\n\nMalta – CUTE – Music\n\nGreece – MADE IN GREECE – Kapou Mperdeftika (Confused)\n\nLithuania – Lina Joy – Kai Miestas Snaudžia (When The Town Is Asleep)\n\nBelarus – Alexey Zhigalkovich – S Druzyami (With Friends)\n\nThe hosts from Holland have come up with an environmental topic, which involves everyone on the Planet. The song of the Belgium band tells about the stormy life of teenagers and how they manage through the difficult emotions the teenage age brings. The Cypriot, Maltese, and Portugal songs are inspired by the artists’ desire to sing and how important music is in their lives. Some of the songs are about friendship, loved ones, or school. The elder kids, naturally, sing about love, such as the Serbian, the Swedish, and the Greek songs.\n\nOne cannot but notice the hard core of the Contest: Belgium, Cyprus, Romania, the Netherlands, Sweden, Malta, Belarus, FYR Macedonia, and Greece are among the loyal participants in the “Kids’ Eurovision”, who have been on the JESC stage since the very beginning. Others like Armenia, Georgia, Bulgaria, Lithuania have just joined the show.\n\nStill others, such as Croatia, Latvia, Poland, Norway, Switzerland, France, Denmark, the UK and Spain have given up participating in the JESC for various reasons. We hope they are coming back. Obviously, the ebb of participation on the part of these countries has not affected the popularity of the Contest, as this year we have 17 countries again. Has it not been for the last-minute withdrawal of Spain, the number would have been 18.\n\nAll children at the 2007 JESC are professionals: they go to piano, dance, singing, etc classes, study at music schools and their lives are fully focused on a future music career. Up till last year the kids couldn’t be professionally involved in a music career, but this year, the EBU has decided the other way round, which in my mind, makes the Contests all the more interesting.\n\nBusy as he might be, Dmitry Koldun will next go to Sofia, Bulgaria as a special guest in the national selection show EuroBGvision. Koldun will have a mini-gig as he’ll be singing for like a quarter of an hour, presenting the best of his musical art.\n\nEuroBGvision show is the Bulgarian national broadcaster’s attempt to draw more fans to the Eurovision idea, explaining the basis of the Contest, providing some history, starting up furious discussions between the commentators, and giving the floor to the crowds. The stage is given to singers from all over the country and Bulgarians living abroad, who want to try their luck to qualify for the grand stage in Belgrade. Most of them are way below the average, but this doesn’t seem to bother those with no ear for music.\n\nKoldun is the best qualifying artist for Belarus, since the country’s first participation in 2004. After his grand success in Helsinki this spring, he’s been quite busy, filming videos all over the place, mostly in Moscow. Seems like Russia’s enjoying the miracle from Minsk more than anyone else.\n\nThe beginning of this week saw the opening of the Belarusian national selection. State TV of Belarus, along with most broadcasters whose artists finished in the top 10 in this-year’s ESC, protested against the introduction of the new format. Still, the country will continue participating in the Contest with a fresh artist. Who will they be? We’ll know in a couple of months.\n\nYesterday, I saw a Dutch film on a Middle-Eastern country, featuring the way people there organise music and entertainment contests. The only thing that participants are allowed to do by way of choreography, is to snap their fingers. Any form of outspoken excitement is banned. Women are not allowed to the stage at all.\n\nNever mind what this image might make you think – the cultural difference is fascinating and definitely worth seeing.\n\nIn this sense, I was interested to read that Abulfas Garayev, Azerbaijan’s Culture and Tourism Minister, said that they are working more and more on the country’s joining the Eurovision Song Contest not later than 2008. For more information, visit http://en.apa.az/news.php?id=36706\n\nWonder where the boundaries of European music can be posed? Are we facing here the phenomenon of music that has no borders..? If Israel, Georgia, Moldova, and now Azerbaijan participate in a European music forum, shall we expect the US joining in shortly? Or Australia, where indeed Eurovision enjoys huge popularity. And why not? For one thing, last year Georgia’s ESC entrant Sopho with her Visionary Dream was amazing with the combination of ethnic and European, a blend between national folk and world-wide house music.\n\nThe ESC is not necessarily reserved for European countries only. The only thing that worries me is that in a couple of years, we’ll end up with 10 instead of 2 Semi-Finals.\n\nIt took me two weeks or so to read and reread the suggestions for a new format for the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest. I read what Mr. Stockselius said,\n\n“We are convinced that the introduction of a second Semi-Final contributes to a more stable future for the Eurovision Song Contest..”\n\nI went on to see how important commentators viewed the news, and finally got the nerve to have a say myself.\n\nThe facts:\n\nFrom next year on, we will have two Semi-Finals (something we expected to become a fact only after 2008). All participants must go through a Semi-Final, except for the “Big 4″ (or BIG $, if you keep the Caps Lock on all the time), who qualify directly for the Final… That is, the results from ESC 2007 will (except for the winner) have no meaning for the 2008 edition in Serbia.\n\nThe two Semi-Finals will take place at the same time, the night of 22 May. Rumours have it that even a separate Semi-Final was discussed for Eastern Europe, having in mind top 10 from ESC 2007 (all 10 countries are from the Eastern bloc). If this happens, you will watch only one part of Europe at Eurovision… If you come from Russia, you will only watch the songs of the former Russian republics, the Yugoslavian satellites, and a few more… Okay, what if you want to watch the Danish songs, or the Norwegian one, or.. hm, wonder where Hungary goes?\n\nThe results will be announced live for both Semi-Finals, while the artists are in the Green Room. Picture this… we have two Green rooms, or what?\n\nSome said that there should be a wild card for each Semi-Final, which will be granted to the song, preferred by the back-up juries.\n\nI reckon the whole thing takes a lot off the flavor of the Contest.\n\nNo, I’ll start in a different way. When I first watched the ESC, years ago, I though “blah, it’s so unfair to have last-year’s results reflecting this-year’s edition.. Let all countries compete on a fair ground and see who’s the best THIS YEAR.” As I was growing up with Eurovision, I grew to like this rule. Indeed, it gave the event an interesting side – all countries wanted to perform better so that in the following year they could go directly to the Grand Final, or the finale grande… And then the problem with ‘neighbor’ or ‘gastarbeiter’ vote appeared, and it all was corrupted.\n\nAnd we remember the good old times, when the winner would be chosen by the vote of an international jury. But today, there are the major international telecommunication corporations, which will never of earth let loose the pan-European crowds of zealous voters.\n\nThe ESC Reference group, as we get to know who pulls the strings, must agree on Rules that do not present the European pop scene one-sidedly. I can see that they want to make the Contest modern and fascinating for everyone. But I cannot see how two Semi-Finals will help solve the matter. Because this will mean more money, more flash, and less value of the true song."
