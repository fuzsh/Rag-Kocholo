        "text": "Post by Vaios on\n\n► Here you can find the latest news about Norway in NVSC.\n\nOfficial wiki page\n\nPost by Vaios on\n\nTOMORROW: DNS RESULTS\n\nOn Monday 20 January, the results of DNS 04 will be announced. They consist of a 15 minutes scoreboard which will be aired live on TogetherTube. The result show will begin on 19:00 CET. We welcome all the nations to be there so we can comment together.\n\nPost by Vaios on\n\nWINNER OF DNS 04 ANNNOUNCED\n\nThe winner of the Den Norsken Sangen 04 was announced tonight. Maria Mena won for the second time the competition with her song \"All The Love\" recieving eleven times 12 points and finishing first with the massive number of 235 points. It is the second time that Maria will represent Norway in North Vision Song Contest. She didn't make it to the final with \"Fuck You\" in North Vision Song Contest 05. Now she hopes she can do better. Watch here the official preview video of the song:\n\nPost by Vaios on\n\nFIRST SEMIFINAL FOR MARIA\n\nMaria Mena will perform -like in her first participation- in the first semifinal in North Vision Song Contest in United Kingdom, after the allocation draw which took place tonight in the island. Also, she will perform in the second half of the semifinal. In which number she will sing \"All the Love\" isn't announced, yet. The Running Order Draw will take place on 9th February, one day after the close of the song submissions for NVSC 7.\n\nPost by Vaios on\n\nSUCCESS FOR MARIA MENA IN MOLDOVA\n\nMaria Mena, representer of Norway in North Vision Song Contest 07, has experienced a worth-mentioning success in Moldova with her NVSC 5 song \"Fuck You\" being 38 weeks on the Top 50 and peaking at #2. Same with \"All The Love\" (NVSC 7 song), which it's 15 weeks on Top 50. And 2 weeks on #1 of the Moldovian charts. \"Fuck You\" recieved 12 points in the semifinal in Aarhus from Moldova. In United Kingdom, the countries are in seperate semifinals, but it would be interesting if Moldovians will vote for Maria if she qualifies to the Grand Final.\n\n@garameaning\n\nPost by Vaios on\n\nALL THE LOVE IN #23\n\nMaria Mena will be the last to perform in the first semifinal, in Liverpool. Today, the running order draw took place and she was drawn to perform in the number 23, the last act. Before her, Malena Ernman (winner of NVSC 03) will perform her song \"Perdus\", one of the favourites. Let's hope Maria will make it to the final for the first time.\n\nPost by Vaios on\n\nALL TICKETS ARE SOLD OUT!\n\n257 Norwegians will support Maria Mena in her effort to pass to the final of North Vision Song Contest 07. In less than 24 hours, 12.838 tickets were sold out for the show(s) in United Kingdom. Also, 38 people will attend the second semifinal (with Russia participating in it, one of the biggest favourites after the Norwegian poll results). Finally, 537 fans from Norway will watch the Grand Final, live from Echo Arena, in Liverpool.\n\nAleks Džehverović\n\nPost by Vaios on\n\nSUBMISSIONS ARE CLOSED IN NORWAY\n\nNorth Vision Song Contest 7, hasn't started yet, but in NRK they have already started preperations for the 5th Norsken Sangen. Submissions for songs are closed and a jury of experts will rate the 207 songs and decide the 9 that will qualify in the show on Saturday, 15th February. The songs will be announced as soon as Norway confirms officially for the eight edition of North Vision Song Contest, one per day.\n\nPost by Vaios on\n\n9 LUCKY ARTISTS ARE SELECTED\n\nToday, in Oslo, the auditions for Den Norsken Sangen 05 were held. A 3 member jury listened all the (207) songs & selected only the lucky 9 for the national final, which is scheduled for mid-March. Now, there is a 2-3 weeks time for NRK to recieve the applications for the foreign song which can participate in the selection. This time, they look for an unknown (quite young) artist with a strong song to compete with the other 9 Norwegian songs."
