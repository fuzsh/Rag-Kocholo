        "text": "We are into the top 40 songs in my countdown of my favourite 100 songs from the last ten years. Today I reveal the songs which have placed 31-40. To view the rest of the top 100 so far click here: 41-50, 51-60, 61-70, 71-80, 81-90 and 91-100.\n\nBelarus have been grabbing Eurovision headlines in 2016 when their act Ivan announced his intentions to perform completely naked on the stage in Stockholm and added how he wanted to be accompanied by a wolf. Unfortunately (or fortunately), these ambitious plans for staging have been rejected by the broadcaster. Understandably so, given that it is a family show after all. But aside from this what has Belarus got planned for us in 2016? We have a listen to ‘Help You Fly’ in our review.\n\nTonight Belarus will decide who will represent them in the 2016 Eurovision Song Contest. In the meantime, we have been asking you to vote for your favourite of the ten acts in the running in tonight’s live show. You have been voting all week and the results are in and the winner is…\n\n‘I LOVE BELARUS!’ exclaimed the 2011 entry for the country Anastasia Vinnikova. Despite not making through to the final that year, you can’t deny that Belarus always give us some memorable acts in their 12 year history at Eurovision. Who can forget Mr. Cheesecake himself TEO who in 2014 finished in 16th place with his dessert based pop nugget? Then there was of course infectious ‘Solayoh’ from Alyona just the year before that matched TEO’s position. Their best ever result came from Dmitry Koldan who saw Belarus ‘Work Your Magic’ and finish in a solid sixth place in 2007. However with the good comes the bad and Belarus have had their fare share of bad in Eurovision as well. Eight of their twelve Eurovision attempts failed to qualify for the final show and this was the case last year with Uzari and Maimuna’s ‘Time’.\n\nBelarus are back for 2016, so let’s see what gems they have lined up for us, shall we?"
