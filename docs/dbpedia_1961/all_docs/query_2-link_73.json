        "text": "Bulgaria: Deep Zone & Balthazar – DJ Take Me Away\n\nA pop disco track that could easily get you jumping. Yoanna (the vocal) could have done better with the singing, and the dress.. Yet, Bulgaria surprised us with a nice show, the side programme featuring Ukrainian star Ruslana, was much more fascinating than the 12 competing participants.\n\nCroatia: Kraljevi Ulice & 75 Cents – Romanca\n\nDid they call this type of song “old urban songs” (starogradska pesen)?? Well, perhaps there are still people who might well like them, but I doubt it. However, I have to note the high quality of the band and the concept behind the track. Good luck, guys, you might win the “worst song” on Eurovision award!\n\nGreece: Kalomira Saranti – Secret Combination\n\nA truly Eurovision song that can shake up Europe and get it dancing. Ethnic elements combined with disco sound – that’s a universal formula for success. The thing I enjoy most – the ballet\n\nIceland: Eurobandid – Fulkomid lif (This is My Life)\n\nIt’s a cool Eurovision song. A typical Eurovision song, if you ask me. Hope more people vote for Iceland, ‘coz they deserve it simply for travelling on such a long distance from the this northern island.\n\nIreland: Dustin The Turkey – Irelande Douze Pointe\n\nAnd that’s the cherry of the cake, the top of the top. A fantastic burlesque, a parody that mocks the original idea of Eurovision. Seems like the ancestors of Saint Patrick are fed up with finishing at final position. This morning, I listened to a French radio, where they had a special 10-minute comment on this song. The French are impressed and are very much looking forward to the result. Just like we all are.\n\nMacedonia: Tamara ft. Vrcak & Adrian – Vo ime na ljubovta (In The Name of Love)\n\nThe Macedonian entrant will again go for the local language. An up-tempo track telling about love and passion, perhaps.\n\nPoland: Isis Gee – For Life\n\nDo we need to comment on this song again? A powerful solo female vocal, a touching ballad, a catchy and familiar rhythm. And so very professional! For Life definitely stands every chance to win the 2008 ESC. What do you reckon?\n\nRomania: Nico & Vlad Mirita – Pe-o Margine De Lume\n\nOh, it sounds so Italian! It’s cool and romantic, and above all, well-measured.\n\nUkraine: Ani Lorak – Shady Lady\n\nThis song is a huge step beyond what we are used to see representing Ukraine at the Eurovision Song Contest. The good news is that Ukraine and Greece are not participating in the same semi-final, which will save us from watching the same (secret) combination twice.\n\nAlbania: Olta Boka – Zemrën E Lamë Peng\n\nAlbania will compete with a nice ballad in Albanian. It’s a pity I can’t get a word, but there’s no need to: the female vocal is resolute yet mild. Could be better in terms of composition, but I reckon many people will like it.\n\nAndorra: Gisela – Casanova\n\nWonder if this is the present state of the Eurovision Song Contest?! Andorra seems to be a million years away from Eurovision. This year’s representative of the small principality is Gisela – a cheerful girl – and I guess she’ll offer a “fairy-tale” show in Belgrade telling us about romance and the historical lover Casanova. But haven’t we heard this type of song many times already…\n\nAzerbaijan: Elnur Guseynov and Samir Javadzadeh – Day After Day\n\nThere’s been a huge support for Azerbaijan’s debut in Eurovision: Eurovision stars, like Ukrainian diva Ruslana and Serbian winner Maria Serifovic, from across Europe joined in to say “Welcome” to one of three new-comers this year. In Belgrade we’ll see a male duet who, with heavy odds against them on part of the other two competitors, managed to grab the trophy. As for the song – pop-rock supported by high vocals, correct me if I’m wrong, influenced to a degree by the Russian school.\n\nBelarus: Ruslan Alenho – Hasta La Vista\n\nDoes he stand a chance to win this-year’s ESC? Who knows, but Belarus has always been capable of surprising the audience. Yes, it’s good. Yes, he sings like a god, and yes – there are people in Minsk who can write good songs.\n\nCyprus: Evdokia Kadi – Femme Fatale\n\nCyprus can’s stop experimenting. Not even after a series of losses for one of the countries who’ve invested so much in Eurovision. Evdokia Kadi sings in Greek, for a change, what’s really notable having in mind what we’ve heard from Aphrodite’s island recently (in 2006, Annet Artani performed a typically American song, which sounded truly out of place, at least to me. Last year, Evridiki with her experiment in French – Comme ci comme ca did not even qualify to the Final). The traditional music that Evdokia has to offer seems to be much less annoying.\n\nCzech Republic: Tereza Kerndlová – Have Some Fun\n\nPrague sends to Belgrade a lift-me-up song. It does sounds like Nellie Furtado, doesn’t it? It strikes me as one of the few songs selected so far that can become a European hit, if nothing else. Keep it going, Tereza!\n\nDenmark: Simon Mathew – All Night Long\n\nPurely European sound, party atmosphere, cool looks, a naughty cheeky band – the recipe for good mood, if not for anything else. For me, this song embodies the spirit of Eurovision. Sing along:\n\n“The sun is up\n\nI’m feeling great\n\nI’m just enjoying life\n\nRight here in the shade…”\n\nEstonia: Kreisiraadio – Leto Svet\n\nVerka Serduchka in a mock pop-jazz-seventies-ridicule version, multiplied by three. Okay, it can be fun, it can be a show, but where’s the music gone? It packed and embarked on a long journey? Of course many people will vote for them, and why not But it’s not surprising in its goal to shock us with its “craziness”. Have a look at the British entries recently for inspiration, and you’ll get what I mean.\n\nHungary: Csézy – Szívverés\n\nThis is an ultimate romantic song. I can’t keep looking at Csézy’s dress though, it’s so distracting. I do hope she’ll make up to put on something simpler during the show Well done on the language front!\n\nLithuania: Jerominas Milius – Nomads In The Night\n\nOne thing is for sure – Lithuania keep surprising us.\n\nMalta: Morena – Vodka\n\nWell, if there is anyone who can help Malta out of trouble and bring it to the Final, that’s Vodka. Cheers\n\nNorway: Maria Haukaas Storeng – Hold on be strong\n\nScandinavia again offers a little piece of valuable music. Miss Storeng knows what and how to sing it – a track that appeals to all tastes. It can make you picture the Aurora Borealis though it’s not terribly romantic.\n\nSlovenia: Rebeka Dremelj – Vrag Naj Vzame\n\nRebeka won Ema 2008 and here she is, representing Slovenia. She did it thanks to a pop song, a couple of backing vocals and.. good (to some) looks. Yet another song in a native language. Great!\n\nTurkey: Mor ve Ötesi – Deli\n\nA melodic rock track won the Turkish national selection and is eventually going to Serbia. What more can we want after years of typically traditional music mixed with modern elements that Turkey had to offer to the Eurovision audiences in recent years? A nice sensual male vocal supported by an energetic band – it can turn out to be a nice show."
