It was the first time since 1996 that the contest was held on mainland Europe. The contest was the second to be held in Stockholm, and the fourth held in Sweden. The presenters were Kattis Ahlström and Anders Lundin, and the contest was won by the Olsen Brothers who represented Denmark with the song \"Fly on the Wings of Love\" (originally: Smuk som et stjerneskud). The song was written by one of the brothers, Jørgen Olsen.\n\n2001\n\nCopenhagen\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest 2001 was the 46th Eurovision Song Contest and was held on 12 May 2001 in the Parken Stadium inCopenhagen, Denmark. It was the first time in 36 years that Denmark hosted the Eurovision Song Contest, thanks to the Olsen Brothers' win the previous year in Stockholm. The Olsen Brothers Opened the show with a snippet from their winning song \"Fly on the Wings of Love\", followed by their latest single \"Walk Right Back\", which was already a smash hit in Denmark. The presenters were Danish journalist and TV-show presenter Natasja Crone Back and the famous Danish actor Søren Pilmark who spoke most of their announcements in rhyme. The contest was won by Estonia who were represented by Tanel Padar, Dave Benton & 2XL with the song\"Everybody\", written by Ivar Must and Maian Kärmas. Dave Benton, who was born and raised in Aruba, was the first black person and, at the age of 50 years and 101 days, the oldest contestant at the time to win the contest.\n\n2002\n\nTallinn\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest 2002 was the 47th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest. It took place on 25 May 2002 at the Saku Suurhall Arena in Tallinn, Estonia.\n\nThe contest was won by Latvia's Marie N and her song \"I Wanna\", which won by a tight margin over Malta's Ira Losco. Third place went to both the United Kingdom and host country Estonia, with France completing the Top 5.\n\n2003\n\nRiga\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest 2003 was the 48th annual Eurovision Song Contest, held at the Skonto Hall in Riga, Latvia on 24 May 2003. The hosts were Marie N and Renārs Kaupers. Sertab Erener, the Turkish entrant, won the contest with \"Everyway That I Can\", scoring 167 points. The winning songwriters were Erener and Turkish rock guitarist and singer Demir Demirkan. Belgium and Russia were second and third respectively, within three points of Turkey's score.\n\n2004\n\nIstanbul\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest 2004 was the 49th Eurovision Song Contest and it was held in the Abdi İpekçi Arena in Istanbul,Turkey. This was the first occasion in which the contest was held in Turkey after they had won the competition in 2003 with Sertab Erener singing \"Everyway That I Can\". The hosting national broadcaster of the contest was Turkish Radio and Television Corporation(TRT).\n\nSemi-final\n\nFinal\n\n2005\n\nKiev\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest 2005 was the 50th Eurovision Song Contest, which was held at the Palace of Sports, Kiev, Ukraine. The winner was Greece's My Number One, written by famous Greek songwriters Christos Dantis and Natalia Germanou and performed by Swedish-born Greek singer Elena Paparizou, who scored 230 points, while Malta's Angel written and performed by Chiara was the runner up with 192 points and the 3rd place went to Romania's \"Let Me Try\". The contest took place on 19 May for the semifinal and 21 May 2005 for the final. Organizers hoped that this event would boost Ukraine's image abroad and increase tourism, while the country's new government hoped that it would also give a modest boost to the long-term goal of acquiring European Union membership.\n\nSemi-final\n\nFinal\n\n2006\n\nAthens\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest 2006 was the 51st Eurovision Song Contest, held at the Olympic Indoor Hall in Athens, Greece on 18 May (for the semi-final) and 20 May 2006 (for the final). The hosting national broadcaster of the contest was Ellinikí Radiofonía Tileórasi (ERT). The Finnish band Lordi won the contest with the song \"Hard Rock Hallelujah\", written by lead singer Mr. Lordi. \"Hard Rock Hallelujah\" was the first ever hard rock song to win the contest, since Eurovision is normally associated with softer pop music andschlager. This was Finland's first victory in Eurovision after waiting forty-five years.\n\nThe hosts of the Eurovision Song Contest in Athens were popular Greek singer Sakis Rouvas, the Greek representative at Eurovision in2004 and 2009, and the Greek American television presenter and actress, Maria Menounos. In the semi-final, both the hosts sangKatrina and the Waves' contest-winning \"Love Shine A Light\". For one of the intervals, Sakis Rouvas sang an English version of his Greek hit \"S'eho Erotefthi\" (already a smash hit in Greece) called \"I'm in love with you\". Elena Paparizou, who performed the winning song in Kiev, returned to the Eurovision stage in Athens. Following the examples of Sertab Erener and Ruslana in the last two years, she sang twice in the final, \"My Number One\" in the opening and her current song \"Mambo!\" in the interval (which was also a smash hit in Greece at the time); Greek dancers were also present in the interval acts, as well as other Greek elements. An official CD and DVD was released and a new introduction was an official fan book released from this year, and every year to come with detailed information of every country.\n\nThe 2006 contest also saw the 1,000th song to be performed in the contest, when \"Every Song Is a Cry for Love\" by Ireland's Brian Kennedy was first sung in the semi-final. Armenia also entered for the first time in the contest.\n\nSemi-final\n\nFinal\n\n2007\n\nHelsinki\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest 2007 was the 52nd edition of the Eurovision Song Contest. It was won by first-time appearance as an independent country Serbia and was held at the Hartwall Areena in Helsinki, Finland from 10 May to 12 May. The host broadcaster was YLE. Finland earned the right to host the event after heavy metal band Lordi's victory at the Eurovision Song Contest 2006. It was the first time the Contest had been held in Finland. A budget of €13 million was presented for arranging the contest. Other bids to host the contest came from Espoo, Turku and Tampere. The hosts were Finnish television personality Jaana Pelkonen and Finnish musician, stage performer and actor Mikko Leppilampi. Krisse Salminen acted as guest host in the green room, and reported from the crowds at the Senate Square.\n\nA record number of 42 countries participated. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) put aside its limit of 40 countries, which would have meant excluding some countries using a ranking order scheme.\n\nAfter Lordi scored the first ever Eurovision victory with a hard rock song in 2006, several countries sent rock songs to the Contest rather than the soft pop and schlager styles more closely associated with Eurovision. This trend continued at the 2008 and 2009 Contests.\n\nSemi-final\n\nFinal\n\n2008\n\nBelgrade\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest 2008 was the 53rd edition of the Contest. It was hosted in Belgrade, Serbia after Marija Šerifović won the 2007 Contest in Helsinki, Finland. This year was the first contest to have two semi-finals which were held on 20 and 22 May, and the final held on 24 May 2008. The shows were hosted by Jovana Janković and Željko Joksimović at the Belgrade Arena which had a total capacity of more than 20,000 seats. The host broadcaster was RTS.\n\nSemi-final 1\n\nSemi-final 2\n\nFinal\n\n2009\n\nMoscow\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest 2009 was the 54th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest and was hosted by Russia after their win in2008. It took place between 12 and 16 May 2009 at the Olympic Indoor Arena in Moscow, Russia.\n\nSemi-final 1\n\nSemi-final 2\n\nFinal\n\n2010\n\n2010 - 2011 - 2012 - 2013 - 2014 - 2015 - 2016 - 2017 - 2018 - 2019\n\n2010\n\nOslo\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest 2010 was the 55th annual Eurovision Song Contest, übroadcast from the Telenor Arena in Bærum, Greater Oslo,Norway. It was the third time Norway had hosted the contest, having previously done so in 1986 and 1996. The 2010 winner was Germany with Lenasinging \"Satellite\", written by American Julie Frost and Denmark's John Gordon. It was Germany's first win in twenty-eight years, its second since the Contest's inception, and its first win as a unified country. It was also the first time a \"Big Four\" country won the contest since the rule's introduction in 2000.\n\nSemi-final 1\n\nSemi-final 2\n\nFinal\n\n2011\n\nAzerbaijan\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest 2011 was the 56th annual Eurovision Song Contest and was won by Ell/Nikki performing \"Running Scared\" forAzerbaijan. The event took place in the Esprit Arena in Düsseldorf, Germany, following Germany's win in the previous year. This made the 2011 contest the first since 2004 to take place outside of the host nation’s capital city. The two semi-finals took place on 10 May and 12 May 2011, while the final took place on the evening of 14 May 2011.\n\nForty-three countries participated in the contest, with those returning including Austria, which last participated in 2007; Hungary, which last competed in 2009; and San Marino, which last participated in 2008.
