He is one of the few, if no the only from Russia that actually have managed to make international hits outside Russia with songs in the English language. His career got a boost when he wrote songs for the band Gorky Park. The song \"Old Hotel\" started an international success for Gorky Park back in the 80’s.\n\nAs Karen is specialised in writing lyrics in English, it’s no wonder that his songs also enters the world of Eurovision. He wrote the lyrics for Dima Bilan’s Eurovision entry \"Never Let You Go\"last year as well as the group Prime Ministers Eurovision entry \"Northern Girl\" 2002. And after this interview was done it’s has beome known that he has written lyrics for Diana Gurtskaya and Dima Kuldun’ songs in the Belarussian national final 2007.\n\nav Alexander Borodin\n\nAlexander: I think most of our readers here in Sweden doesn’t know you at all by name!? Can you introduce yourself, short and simple? Who is Karen Kavaleryan!?"
