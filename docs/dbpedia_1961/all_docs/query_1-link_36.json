        "text": "This is this year’s score analysis of the Eurovision Song Contest in Oslo! Enjoy!\n\n25. United Kingdom – Josh Dubovie – That sound’s good to me\n\nThe third last place for Josh and the United Kingdom is also the third one in only 8 years. The United Kingdom used to be one of the most successful ESC countries (5 wins and 15 second places). In the last decade they had a series of very bad placings tough. In 2003 they “reached” last place for the first time ever with Jemini (0 points). 5 years later they came last again with Andy Abraham. In the last 10 years the UK only had 2 Top 10 placings (2002, 2009).With his 10 points Josh thus achieved the second worst result ever.\n\n24. Belarus – 3+2 – Butterflies\n\nThis was only the second time a Belarussian entry qualified for a Eurovision final since they started participating in 2004. For the “Last dictatorship in Europe” this has thus to be seen as a success. They can’t be too happy about a second to last place tough. The only entry more successful than Butterflies was “Work your magic” by Koldun which came 6th with 145 points. If you ask me, the predjudice of the “Eastern European voting mafia” can be refuted with a smoking gun: Belarus.\n\n23. Ireland – Niamh Kavanagh – It’s for you\n\nIreland oooo Ireland… “The home of Eurovision” has to suffer yet another defeat. After the glorious 90s with 4 Irish vicotries (and only 2 years outside of the Top 10) the “00s” seem ever more horrible. The best place Ireland achieved in the last 10 years (2001-2010) was a 10th place in Athens with Brian Kennedy and “Every song is a cry for love”. The year after (they were already qualified to the final) they came last tough and in 2008 and 2009 they didn’t even qualify to the final. 1993 winner Niamh has achieved at least that, but her 23rd place just gets into the line of very dissapointing results for the Green island.\n\n22. Moldova – Sun Stroke Project & Olia Tira – Run away.\n\nApart from the non-qualification in 2008, this has to be Moldova’s worst placing so far. Their 6th place at their debut (remember the drumming grandma) remains their best result to date. The last Moldovan entry that belonged to the Bottom 5 in a Eurovision final was “Loca” in 2006, which achieved a 20th place thus placing better than this years entry. It has to be noted tough that Sun Stroke Project and Olia Tira got 5 more points than Loca.\n\n21. Cyprus – John Lillygreen and the Islanders – Life looks better in spring.\n\nCyprus hadn’t been part of a Eurovision final since 2005. In 2004 Lisa Andreas reached 5th place for the island (best result ever). In 2005 Konstantinos was thus already qualified for the final (Top 10+Big4 were automatically qualified) and achieved a meager 18th place. Since then Cyprus has repeatedly failed to qualify for the Final untill 2010. Nevertheless the 21st place is the worst result in a final since 2000.\n\nSidenote: All of these songs were performed in English and 3 of the lead vocalists were native English speakers. It seems a good pronounciation (lav ooh lav) is not as important as some journalists seemed to believe before the contest.\n\n20. Norway – Didrik Solligen-Tangen – My heart is yours\n\nAfter last year’s win with Alexander Rybak in Moscow, Norway was the host thus year and had high hopes again for Didrik Solligen-Tangen. Some saw him as a dark horse for victory. Unfortunately, he couldn’T benefit from the “home ground bonus”. This 20th place is the worst result for a host nation since Ukrainian band “Greenjolly” also came 20th in Kiev in 2005.\n\n19. Iceland – Hera Björk – Je ne sais quoi\n\nAnother big fall from last year. In 2009 Iceland was the runner-up for the second time in its Eurovision history (the other being 1999) but this year the island has to digest a 19th place. It has to be noted tough that this is Iceland’s third consecutive qualification to a Eurovision final. 2005,2006 and 2007 they didn’t make the cut. In 2008 Euroband were able to qualify and achieved a respectable 14th place in Belgrade. “Je ne sais quoi” is tough the third most successful Icelandic entry in 5 years.\n\n18. Portugal – Felipa Azevedo – Há dias assim\n\nThis is the worst placing song this year entirely sung in the National language. Portugal hasn’t had much success in Eurovision. In over 40 years of participation the best place is still a sixth place in 1996 achieved by Núcia Moniz. Just like Iceland Portugal was able to qualify for the third time in a row (which they failed to do from 2004 to 2007). In 2008 Vania Fernandez was able to achieve a second place in her semifinal but fell to 15th position in the final. Last year Flor-de-lis also achieved a place in the Top 20 (15th). Felipa Assavedo’s 18th place is thus the worst place in three years, but considering the constant non-qualifications before that, can still be seen as a success.\n\n17. Bosnia-Herzegovina – Vukasin Brajic – Thunder and lightning\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina has never failed to qualify from a semifinal and unsurprisingly they did it again this year. In the last 5 years they only failed to reach the Top 10 once in 2007. It is thus no surprise, that this 17th position is the worst for Bosnia-Herzegovina since 1997. Their best place to date was in 2006 in Athens when Hari Mata Hari achieved a third place with his song “Lejla”\n\n16. Albania – Juliana Pasha – It’s all about you\n\nAlbania started participating in 2004. In its seven years of participation it has qualified to the final 4 times (In 2005 they were already qualified for the final) and failed 3 times. The 16th place achieved this year by Juliana is the best result since their debut. The last 2 years they came 17th in the final and in 2005 they reached 16th place as well, but with less point than this year. The best result to date is still their debut entry by Aneza Shahini which reached 7th place.\n\n15. Spain – Daniel Diges – Algo pequenito\n\nThis 15th place is the best result achieved by a Spanish entrant since 2004, when Ramón reached the Top 10 with “Para llenarme de ti”. To the second to last place last year in Moscow this is a huge improvement for the Southern European country. In 2005,2006 and 2007 Spain achieved two 21st and a 20th place and in 2008 they came 16th with the joke entry by Rodolfo Chikilicuatre.\n\n14. Israel – Harel Skaat – Milim\n\nOnly a small improvement from last year’s 16th place, Israel is not happy with this result. Israel had made it for the third time in a row to the final. In 2008 Boaz Mauda even reached the Top 10. This 14th place is thus a mediocre result. The most successful Israeli entry this century remains Shiri Maimon with “Hasheket shenish’ar” who achieved a 4th place in 2005.\n\n13. Serbia – Milan Stancovic – Ovo je Balkan\n\nSerbia has only sent 4 entries to the Eurovision Song Contest and won once, didn’t qualify once and came 6th the other time. Milan’s 13th place has thus achieved the second worst or the third best result for his country. In 2004 and 2005 when they still formed a Union with Montenegro they achieved a Top 10 result both times. If you include these results “Ovo je Balkan” is certainly a disappointment for the Serbs.\n\n12. France- Jessy Matador – Allez,Ola,Olé\n\n5 time winner France has had some horrible results in these last 1o years. 23rd and last in 2005, 22nd in 2006 and 2007 and 19th in 2008. Their “luck” turned when they sent internationally popular Patricia Kaas. She achieved the first Top 10 placing for France since 2002. This year many didn’T expect a lot from Jessy Matador and his soccer anthem. The 12th place is one of the better results in recent French Eurovision history and has become a hit in several countries around Europe (#1 in France)\n\n11. Russia – Peter Nalitch and Friends – Lost and forgotten\n\nRussia has never failed to qualify for a final. Their worst place remains a 17th place in 1995. Since 1997 all Russian entries have achieved at least a place in the Top 15. After a second place in 2006 with Dima Bilan, 3rd place in 2007 and their win (again with Dima Bilan) in 2008 they were called by some fans the new “Ireland”. In 2009 Russia hosted the contest and failed to achieve a place within the Top 10. Anastasia Prikhodko came 11th just like Peter Nalitch this year. It seems Russia can send almost any song and will be relatively successful. Many Eurovision fans still can’t believe this year’s amateurish entry achieved the 11th place.\n\n2 Votes\n\n10. Ukraine – Alyosha – Sweet people\n\nThe Ukraine has only participated for 8 years but has already achieved a win and 2 second places. They never failed to qualify for the final, either. Last year Svetlana Loboda only reached 12 th place with her “hell machine”, which for sure was a disappointment for the country. This year Alyosha enters the Top 10 again with her song “Sweet people”. The fact that this is one of the worst results for Ukraine shows how successful they are in the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\n09. Georgia – Sofia Nizharadze – Shine\n\nAs they withdrew their song “We don’t wanna put in” last year due to the tension with Russia, this is Georgia’s third entry to a Eurovision Song Contest. All three of them have managed to reach the final. In 2007 Sopho came 12th with her “Visionary dream” and in 2008 Diana Gurtskaya came 11th. Sofia Nizharadze has thus achieved the best result ever for a Georgian entry in Eurovision.\n\n08. Greece – Giorgios Alkaios and Friends – OPA\n\nGreece had never been a particularly successful Grand Prix nation… until this decade. After Sakis Rouvas (first) participation in 2004, where he achieved a 3rd place Greece has always made it into the final and the Top 10. Their best result is of course Helena Paparizou’s win in 2005. This 8th place is thus not a big surprise, although the song was sung in Greek for the first time in 12 years, its energy was widely expected to garner votes from all around Europe before the contest.\n\n07. Armenia – Eva Rivas – Apricot stone\n\nArmenia’s fifth participation brings them their 5th Top 10 placing. Armenia’s best result is a 4th place in 2008 with Sirusho and “Quelé, Quelé”. The Caucasian nation had high hopes for 2010 and thus the 7th place might be a bit of a disappointment. Eva Rivas has already declared her disappointment with the result and her will to try again to achieve a better place for Armenia.\n\n06. Belgium – Tom Dice – Me and my guitar\n\nBelgium was one of the countries that some thought would never make it into the final again. Since their fabulous 2nd place in 2003 only 2 points behind Sertab Erener, they failed miserably to qualify for the final every single time since then. Tom Dice’s qualification was thus already a big success for the Western European country. His 6th place in the Final is even more impressive. This success shows countries like the Netherlands, Switzerland or Andorra (should they return) that it’s not about diaspora or neighbour support (alone) but about the song and the performance!\n\n05. Azerbaijan – Safura – Drip Drop\n\nSafura was the big favourite this year to win the competition and there is no doubt that the Azeri delegation excepted nothing less than to take home the crown. All the money spent for choreography, video and promotion “only” resulted in a 5th place. 2010 saw Azerbaijan’s 3rd participation and third Top10 position. Safura is only the second most successful (and also second least successful) Azeri artist in a Eurovision Song Contest as last year Ayzel and Arash came 3rd with “Always”.\n\n04. Denmark – Chanée and N’evergreen – In a moment like this\n\nSuccessful Swedish songwriter a man/woman duo and a Eurovision kind of pop song with a catchy chorus. Everything about this year’s Danish entry screams “Eurovision winner”. They didn’t win, but probably still made Denmark proud. Chanee and N’evergreen achieved the best Danish result since 2001, when Rollo and King were the runner-ups in Copenhague, after the Olson Brothers had won in 2000. After 2001 Denmark reached the Top 10 only once in 2005 with Jakob Sveistrup and even failed to qualify for the final 2004 and 2007.\n\n03. Romania – Paula Seling ft. Ovi – Playing with fire\n\nOnly once had Romania been in the Top 3: In 2005 with Luminiţa Anghel & Sistem and their entry “Let me try”. As Paula and Ovi got 4 more points than Luminita in 2005, “Playing with fire” can be seen as the most successful Romanian entry to date. Participating since 1994, Romania has had some success with its entries. Apart from these two third places, they have a 4th place with Mihai Trăistariu and Tornero in their chart, as well as 9th and 10th places in 2002 and 2003.\n\n02. Turkey – MaNga – We could be the same\n\nTurkey was one of the least successful countries in the years prior to the introduction of televoting. Since Sertab Erener’s win in 2003 Turkey’s luck seems to have changed. In 8 years they qualified for the final every single time and reached the final 6 times. Last year Hadise came 4th with “Düm Tek Tek” and in 2007 Kenan Doğulu did the same in Helsinki. MaNga’s entry is thus the second most successful (just behind Sertab) in 35 years of Turkish Eurovision History.\n\n01. Germany – Lena – Satellite\n\nGermany is the only country that has selected a song for every Eurovision Song Contest (only missing in the Final in 1996, as they didn’t pass the qualification round with Leon’s “Blauer Planet”. So in 53 tries they only achieved one victory with Nicole in 1982 who asked for “Ein bisschen Frieden” (A little peace). Lena thus achieves a historic second win, the first one for a Big4 country since 1997. Her 246 points are also the second highest winning margin except last year’s winner Alexander Rybak. The 12 points from Finland were the first Douze points for a German song since the No Angels got 12 points from Bulgaria (and not many more) in 2008. In the last decade Germany reached the Top 10 only 3 times in 2000 (Stefan Raab) , 2001 (Michelle) and 2004 (Max). Stefan Raab thus had some kind of role in 3 of the 4 German Top 10 placings in the last 11 years. The rest of the last decade was rather disappointing for Germany (I will not elaborate on that too much). The low point came in 2005 when Gracia came last with only 4 points. Lena has thus polished Germany’s record in recent years a lot. Congratulations!\n\nSEMIFINAL 1\n\n17. Latvia – Aisha – What for?\n\nFrom 2005 until 2008 Latvia always made it to the final, but last year and this year, they were less fortunate. In 2009 they came last with “Intars Busulis” in the second semifinal and this year they repeat this failure coming last in the first semifinal. Aisha’s singing was just too off-key and her song maybe too serious. Latvia can only hope that Germany 2011 will be more of a success story for them. It can’t get much worst.\n\n16.Slovakia – Kristina – Horehronie\n\nHere’s another country without luck at the Eurovision Song Contest. Slovakia sent 5 entries to Eurovision to date and the best position they ever achieved was… this 16th and second to last place in the first semifinal. In 1994,1996 and 1998 Slovakia was in the final tough, but didn’t get past 18th place. Last year Slovakia returned to the contest after 11 years but only came second to last in their semi as only Latvia saved them from coming last (just like this year). For Kristina it must be especially bitter as she was one of the favourites to win. Let’s hope they don’t stop trying.\n\n15. FYR Macedonia – Gjoko Taneski – Jas ja imam silata\n\nAnd after Slovakia we have another Eastern European country without any luck at Eurovision (where is their Mafia?). Participating since 1998 the best result they ever achieved was a 12th place! This is the third year in a row that they don’t make it into the final as well. In 2008 and 2009 it had always been very close for Macedonia, but this year the failure is clearer. In 2004,2005 and 2006 they had made it to the final on 10th or 9th places, consequently failing to reach the Top 10 in the Final. This year, the mixture of rock and rap in combination with the Macedonian language didn’t seem to capture the public at all.\n\n14. Estonia – Malcolm Lincoln & Manpower 4 – Siren\n\nThe next Baltic country that didn’t make it. Last year the mystic Rändajad by Urban Symphony secured them their first Top 10 position since Sahlene reached 3rd place on home ground in 2002 after Estonia had surprisingly won the competition the year before. Since then Estonia had failed to make it to the final every single time from 2004 till 2009. Malcolm Lincoln thus joins the big number of disappointing positions for Estonia.\n\n13. Poland – Marcin Mronski – Legenda\n\nMarcin’s expectations seemed to be high. He spoke about a historic Contest for Poland. In the end he didn’t even qualify for the final with his anthem Legenda. In 15 participations Poland has only reached the Top 10 twice. The last time was in 2003, when Ich troje sang in Russian, Polish and German. Except for 2008 Poland has always failed to make it to the final since then. Isis Gee made it to the final in 2008, but came shared last. Marcin thus didn’T help Poland’s Eurovision record at all.\n\n12. Malta – Thea Garett – My dream\n\nThe small Mediterranean island is probably one of the Eurovision craziest countries. For a small country with no real neighbours, block or diaspora voting their record is quite impressive (a.o 2 second places). Since Chiara’s second place in 2005 Malta had to suffer through many disappointments and failures. In 2006 Malta was already qualified for the final and came last with one point. In 2007 and 2008 they failed to make it to the final and in 2009 they sent Chiara for the third time. Unfortunately she didn’t bring Malta the result they were hoping for (22nd place). “My dream” “achieved” another disappointing result, but Malta already confirmed their participation in Germany. Hopefully with a little more luck.\n\n11. Finland – Kuunkuiskaajat – Työlki ellää\n\n3 points! That’s what made Finland miss the final in favour of Moldova. Finland had long been one of the least successful countries. Never making it into the Top 5 and (too) often coming last. That all changed with a band called “Lordi” who gave Finland their first win after over 40 tries. Since then Finland had always been in the Final of the Eurovision Song Contest. Last year they came last in the Final tough with Waldo’s people. Nevertheless, Kuunkuiskaajat are responsible for the worst Finnish result in 6 years."
