        "text": "Re: ?????????? - Georgia 2010 - Sopho Nizharadze\n\nThe submission period for participation in the Georgian national song selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 has now passed.\n\n2010 sees more than 100 Georgian and foreign songwriters participating in Georgian national song selection. The Producing Team of GPB and Professional jury will select five entries for the national final. The winning song will be selected by mixed voting of televiewers and jury.\n\nGeorgian public broadcaster (GPB) has announced that, by the decision of producing team of First Channel that the country will be represented by 23-year-old Sopho Nizharadze at the 55th Eurovision Song Contest to be held in Oslo, Norway.\n\nGeorgia was represented in the Eurovision Song Contest for the first time in 2007, when Sopho came 12th with her song \"My Story.” In 2008, Diana Gurtskaya improved that record by one place, reaching the 11th place with \"Peace Will Come.”\n\nLast year - \"Stephane & 3G\" with the song “Put In Disco” were selected as the Georgian entry for the Eurovision Song Contest through Georgia’s national competition. Later, Georgia had announced withdrawal from the Eurovision Song Contest 2009.\n\nRe: ?????????? - Georgia 2010 - Sopho Nizharadze\n\nI agree but this is the most probable alternative to Georgian, in case it's not English. And it would probably do the singer a favour since the Georgians don't seem to be very fluent at it, at least the singers for ESC... Last year they had the best English-speaking ones. I guess it just wasn't meant to be for great English to be heard in the ESC by Georgians.\n\nRe: ?????????? - Georgia 2010 - Sopho Nizharadze\n\nLISTEN to all songs here: http://www.eurovision-georgia.ge/Defaul ... &Location=\n\nps. I like how GPB made it available for download\n\nGr8 songs :shock:\n\nOur World - Dysney kind of song about peace though it's much better than Peace Will Come, much more complicated it would sound cool on the NF with the orchestra. Very strong vocals 10/12\n\nSing My Song - kinda typical ballad for ex-USSR though I expected more from Tsvika Pick. 5/12\n\nNever Give In - fast upbeat pop. Such song would suit Ani Lorak perfectly. Sopho really reminded me of her during the verses. It's more about showing her vocal skills again. Though imo this song lacks something. 8/12\n\nFor Eternity - sloooow ballad that starts with piano intro. Cliche, not my kind of thing and it becomes boring until the middle already so that culmination doesn't help. 6/12.\n\nCall Me - And this one would suit Tina Karol' (no wonder cuz Brandon collaborated with her as well). I'm disappointed cuz Brandon most likely will participate in our NF too... hmmm, it should be more aggressive, but I like instrumental part though it's too short. Overall it's boring and monotonous. 7/12\n\nShine - imo, if they wanna appeal to the jury they have to choose this one. I think it rather suits Dannish or Icelandic NFs rather than Georgian. Bad thing about it - it's cliche, good thing - her incredible voice :shock: 8/12\n\nMy own fave - Never Give In or Our World."
