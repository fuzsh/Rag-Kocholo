        "text": "Smurphoria!\n\nJust a bit of news from the Little Blue Men With White Pointy Hats:\n\nThe German Smurfs (Schlümpfe) have been shaking their tiny booty's to Euphoria just as we all did. Their version of Loreens Eurovision winner is titled Ein Schlümpfentag (A Smurf day) and it can be found on their new German market CD Die Hits Der Schlümpfe Vol. 2 out now. (Universal 0602537225903)\n\nAs we all know The Smurfs are cunning multilinguists. The critters also released a new album in Dutch and that also includes a version of Euphoria. This time it's titled Mooi Smurfenland (Beautiful Smurf country).\n\nThe seasonal album Winterpret Met De Smurfen (Winterfun with the Smurfs) is released on November 30 and also includes covers of Gangnam Style, Call Me Maybe, Little Talks and some other 2012 hits. And it has Last Christmas too (EMI 5099997954828).\n\nAnd as a bit of coincidental trivia, Euphoria singer Loreen provides the voice of Smurfette (Smurfan in Swedish) in the 2011 Smurfbuster movie The Smurfs (Smurfarna). I don't know if Loreen is on the books for the new film The Smurfs 2, expected in July 2013.\n\nI don't know if any other regional Smurfs have recorded 2012 Eurovision songs. The French guys (Les Schtroumpfs) just have a new album out but just as the French grown up disque buying publique they have ignored Euphoria.\n\nIf you want to find out about the 2011 Smurftastic coverversions (Popular, Haba Haba) in Swedish, Danish and Norwegian check out this Eurocovers post.\n\nFor older Smurfocovers, here's another post for you.\n\nPlease note, the Eurocovers posts don't include any audio material / downloads.\n\nIt's a small world after all.\n\nSome of us are old enough to remember 1976.\n\nAustria's Eurovision entry My Little World by Waterloo and Robinson (Hans Kreuzmayr and Sepp Krassnitzer) finished a respectable 5th in the The Hague Eurovision Song Contest, won by the mighty Brotherhood Of Man.\n\nPrior to their Eurovision result, Waterloo and Robinson already scored a few hits with Baby Blue and Hollywood, the latter reportedly even being a #1 in Brasil.\n\nWaterloo and / or Robinson have re-recorded their Austrian #1 hitMy Little World several times, but since both their solo re-recordings from 2008 it has been a few years, so it's time for a new one.\n\n(see below)\n\nDas Comebackalbum\n\nTo cut a short story even shorter Schlagerfans, Das Comebackalbum is titled Baby Blue and is by Berger, Maier and Waterloo. So Waterloo = Waterloo (leatherfaceon the left), Berger = Ricky Berger and I guess Maier = Christian Maier, producer (but he's not in the picture, and neither is Robinson, who's probably occupied elsewhere).\n\nThe Baby Blue album will be released on November 23 and it will include new versions of W and R hits including Baby Blue, Hollywood and My Little World. It will also include a coverversion of the U.K. 1972 entry Beg Steal or Borrow (New Seekers) and favorite Clout song Substitute (although the Righteous Bro's recorded it first, I know).\n\nExcerpts are already up up up at Amazon.de.\n\nBMW (oh....) have their Facebook.\n\nHere's the list of recordings of My Little World by at least one of the original singers, maybe there are more, just let me know.\n\nh\n\nMY LITTLE WORLD (english) - Waterloo and Robinson\n\n- single (International Philips 2121 286)\n\nMeine Kleine Welt (german)\n\n- single (ATOM 238 075)\n\nMy Little World (german/english medley)\n\n- on '2 x Gold' commemorative 7\" single (ATOM C-VSTP 558)\n\nMy Little World (first english version with 'rude' lyrics)\n\n- single (Portugal: Planisom PLS 5005)*\n\nMeine kleine Welt (re-recording german, year???)\n\n- on single (Germany: Bellaphon 100 05185)\n\nMeine kleine Welt - robinson (solo version 1990)\n\n- E details wanted\n\nMy Little World (english 2008) - Robinson\n\n- on CD The ballad of my life (Tonora 400.892)\n\nMeine kleine Welt (german 2008) - Robinson\n\n- on CD Ein Morgen mit dir (Tonora 400.896)\n\nMy Little World (english 2008) - Waterloo\n\n- on CD Ewigkeit (Echo 61445)\n\nMy Little World (english 2012) - Berger, Maier, Waterloo\n\n- on CD Baby Blue, to be released November 23\n\nDetails from The Eurovision Collectors Guide.\n\n* not entirely sure of this release as I have never heard it.\n\nFlemish Schlager\n\nAnd some more release news from the cheesy variety. Laat Me Nu Gaan (Let me go now or rather Just let me go) is a single by Belgian Schlager singer Jo Vally. It's a coverversion of Non Ho L'Eta (Per Amarti), the 1964 Eurovision winner by Gigliola Cinquetti for Italy.\n\nDon't know if there's a cdsingle, but the track is available at iTunes Belgium and possibly other sources.\n\nEuphoria - Tyler Ward & Alex G\n\nTyler Ward and Alex G. do Loreens Euphoria, The Eurovision hit that still populates the top 10s in the European charts after three months (a record for a Eurovision hit)\n\nThe Ward/G. track is out through iTunes on Tyler Wards album The Hollywood Sessions EP which also includes other coverversions like thàt other song that just won't go away: Somebody That I Used To Know.\n\nEuphoria was already available as a single at iTunes since May.\n\nI like the way they fooled around with the song in a minimal electronic pop-style but I haven't decided yet if Ward is just gorgeous or a bit slappable.\n\nAmerican singer/songwriter Tyler Ward has been opening for stars like Gavin de Graw and one of the Jonasses, but in autumn he'll be touring the world on his own. 21 dates in Europe in October including Germany, Netherlands, Denmark and of course Loreenland.

San Marino and Azerbaijan. Austria opts out for 2008.\n\nEurocovers of course tries to find any excuse to present some songs here but so far I haven't been able to find any version sung in Azerbaijani (or Azeri-Turkish, check your wiki's).\n\nIf anyone knows any, just let me know….\n\nBut this is close, Muslim Magomaev (Müslüm Maqomayev, Муслим Магомаев, 1942-2008) is a classical singer (baritone) who was born in Baku, capital of Azerbaijan, in 1942, USSR times.\n\nHe shares his name with his grandfather, legendary composer Muslim Magomaev (1885 - 1937), who was a pioneer of Azerbaijani music. His father was a painter and war hero, his mother an actress. Magomaev Jr. started as a classical singer but after a performance in Italy he also turned to popular music. Since he has recorded Italian and Russian versions of many Italian songs including several San Remo entries and (other) songs by Domenico Modugno. Later he was dubbed the Soviet Sinatra.\n\nIn 1966 and 1969 Muslim Magomaev performed in Paris Olympia with great success. The director of Olympia Bruno Coquatrix offered him a contract, and Muslim Magomaev was seriously considering an opportunity to pursue international career, but he didn't get the Ministry of Culture's permission, who claimed that it needed Muslim Magomaev to perform at governmental concerts. In 1969 he received MIDEM Gold Disc Award in Cannes for the album sales of over 4,5 million units. In 1973, at the very young age of 31, Muslim was awarded the Soviet Union's highest artistic title: People's Artist of the USSR. Muslim Magomaev is also known as a composer of songs, film soundtracks and music for theater performances. In addition, Magomaev played in films and acted as a host in television and radio broadcasts.\n\nMuslim Magomaev has been living and working in Moscow since the early 1970s. In 1997, in recognition of Magomaev's professional successes, a Russian astronomical society named two planetoids of the solar system in honor of him and his wife, Tamara Sinyavskaya, a prominent Russian opera singer who was also awarded People's Artist of the USSR and worked as a soloist at the Bolshoi Theater. (source: Magomaev Website)\n\nAt his website (in English and Russian) you can read more and listen to a large selection of his songs: classical music, songs by Azerbaijani composers, western popular songs, film themes and many self composed works.\n\nADDED Muslim Magomaev, died on October 25, 2008 at the age of 66, nine months after the original article was compiled.\n\nMagomaev Eurocovers.\n\nSo far I have found two Eurocovers by Muslim Magomaev. Both are entries from 1965, the year of his visit to Milan, Italy.\n\nSe Piangi, Se Ridi (Italian)\n\n- Italy 1965, originally by Bobby Solo\n\nVoskovaya Kukla (Восковая кукла, Russian)\n\n- Luxembourg 1965, France Galls Poupée De Cire, Poupée De Son.\n\nI don't have any details on the release of Se Piangi Se Ridi, but Poupée…. was issued on a Melodija 4 track EP (33ГД-0001045-2, picture) and a compilation LP of the same year, Vsem kto lyubit pesnyu (No3) / Всем, Кто Любит, Песню (№ 3)\n\nThe third song featured is Non Pensare A Me, the 1967 SanRemo winner that was replaced at the rehearsing stages of the Eurovision Song Contest in Vienna.*\n\n♫ Poupée - Se Piangi - Non Pensare\n\n* Non Pensare A Me was the 1967 San Remo winner by both Iva Zanicchi and Claudio Villa. Villa was supposed to sing it as the Italian Eurovision entry but the song had to be replaced just days before the contest because it broke the release rules (i.e. it was released to early). Instead, Claudia Villa represented Italy with Non Andare Piu Lontano, but Non Pensare A Me was the hit (mainly for Zannichi) and is covered by most artists that were in the business of covering popular Italian songs (Connie Francis, Andre Hazes, Yukari Ito, Agnaldo Timoteo, José Guardiola).\n\nOf Non Andare Piu Lontano I only ever found one coverversion (by Los Catinos)\n\nJEDWARD - Put The Green Cape On - EURO 2012\n\nJedward are covering their own Lipstick from last years Eurovision and turned it into Put The Green Cape On.\n\nThe Green Cape is donned in support of the Irish football team who take on Spain, Italy and Croatia in the first rounds of the forthcoming European Football Championships (Euro 2012) in Poland and Ukraine*.\n\nGreen Cape is released as Jedwards new single and all proceeds will go to the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (ISPCC).\n\nYou just gotta love 'em, their hearts are even bigger than their hair.\n\nFor the video Jedward are joined by Irish sports and TV stars and even former Eurovision entrant Dustin The Turkey make a cameo appearance.\n\nThe cdsingle is out on Universal Ireland (3703342)\n\nFind out more about Jedwards 2011 entry Lipstick here at the Düsseldorf Collection and their 2012 entry Waterline here at the Baku Collection.\n\nsource: Read more about the Green Cape here at RTE\n\nMore football / soccer at Eurocovers: Volare Meets The Beautiful Game\n\n* Ireland are playing their first round games in Poznan and Gdansk in Poland)\n\nUpdate: A week after release Put The Green Cape On enters the Irish charts at #3.\n\nAt #1 there's another football anthem: The Rocky Road To Poland by various (jurassic) Irish artists. It's also is for charity and stresses that it is the OFFICIAL anthem, but it doesn't have anyone half as exiting as Jedward or any of the other Irish Eurovision stars for that matter.\n\nNo Monster Club\n\nIf Jedward are a bit too easy listening for you it may be worthwhile to check out the Lipstick coverversion by the No Monster Club. They have a free download available here at Quarter Inch Collective.\n\nIt's from the album Quompilation #2."
