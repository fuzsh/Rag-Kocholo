        "text": "Andy Mikheev\n\n(M: Music, L: Lyrics, V: Vocal, O: Overall impression before the contest)\n\nAnton Kulakov\n\n(M: Music, L: Lyrics, V: Vocal, O: Overall impression before the contest\n\nTotal\n\n(3 cat) Albania - Olta Boka - Zemren i lame peng M: Ballad, in which only die hard fans of Balkan music can find something interesting, as the song completely lacks development. 6/10\n\nL: Original lyrics are pretty good for the ballad song, but let us wait for the English version 8/10\n\nV: Confident 8/10\n\nO: Someone should immediately send in idea to create dance remix, or Europe may fall asleep soon. 7/10 M: Very strong. Finally good balkan ballad NOT in Joksimovic style. 8/10\n\nL: Theme of clocks is very intellegent.8/10\n\nV: Very pleasant 8/10\n\nO: Has solid chances to qualify, and I don't see it as given that it should be performed in English 8.5/10 22/\n\n24 Andorra - Gisela - Casanova M: Extremely ordinary Swedish-styled pop 8/10\n\nL: Same easily can be said about lyrics 7/10\n\nV: Don't exacly remember her OT performances, but should be on good level 8/10\n\nO: May become first Andorran finalist and in \"Swedish\" songs category is beating Sweden 8/10 M - Euro(Swedish)shlager. How many times we've already heard this ABBA clones? 7/10\n\nL - Casanova, catch me and love me. Hm. 6/10\n\nV - Quite fittning the genre itself. 7/10\n\nO - Has everyone forgotten how similar song from Bosnia has done? 6/10 23/\n\n20\n\nArmenia - Sirusho - Qele Qele M: In structure song really reminds song of Helena Paparizou at Eurovision 2005 and is clearly playing on the field of dance songs with some folk influences 8/10\n\nL: Comparing to Armenian lyrics of past years, this time it is not masterpiece... 7/10\n\nV: Currently, while no live performance has been presented yet, I have some doubts 8/10\n\nO: In any case it is guaranteed top 10 and we will fight for the highest spots, including victory 9/10 M: The beginning is very traditional, but then it goes into dance. I've expected something stronger. 8/10\n\nL: Come on, come on... After two excellent lyrics this is not really impressing. 8/10\n\nV: Again, I was expecting something more. 7/10\n\nO: Certainly it will qualify to the final, and I think will finish... 7th. 7/10 23/\n\n23 Azerbaijan - Elnur Huseynov feat. Samir Javadzadeh - Day After Day M: rock-opera. It will be more interesting to hear the development of it, now it seems three minutes were cut from the bigger concept. 9/10\n\nL: The idea is perfect - Angel, Devel changing into Angel after singing mugham, very creative for the debut of the country. 10/10\n\nV: Elnur is unique vocalist. He should start performing heavy metal. His upper tones are perfect. 10/10\n\nO: First impression - this is potential winner of the contest. If not a very bad draw. 9/10 M: Something quite unexpected. A gothic rock-opera? Very original, I've expected some ethnic for the debut. 9.5/10\n\nL: Quite logical for this genre. 9/10\n\nV: Oh, yes. Unbelievable. 10/10\n\nO: Finalist, and won't be lost their as well. Extremely unexpected choice. Killer one. 10/10 29/\n\n28.5 Belarus - Ruslan Alehno - Hasta la Vista M: Stable, of average European level pop tune 9/10\n\nL: There are, of course, some funny moments in lyrics and Russian variant is a bit better 8/10\n\nV: Vocal and overall presentation are very strong 9/10\n\nO: With this sort of competition should be guaranteed finalist. The strongest Belarus entry since 2004. 9/10 M: Even if it is NOT Breitburg, but I can feel his style there 9/10\n\nL: Well, yes. She turned his days into fairy tales and then left him. Sad. 7/10\n\nV: It is impossible to win at People's Artist without excellent live vocal. The strongest part of the entry. 10/10\n\nO: 50/50 to qualify because of the bad draw 8/10 26/\n\n26 Belgium - Ishtar - O Julissi Na Jalini M: Non-obtrusive, but simply passing bye 7/10\n\nL: Pretty overused gimmick with imaginary language. 6/10\n\nV: Stable, but I doubt it will help the song. 8/10\n\nO: Going nowhere. 6/10 M: Very sticky childish song with folk infuence. Pleasant. 9/10\n\nL: I'd prefer not to speak about the overuse of gimmick with imaginary language. More important is how it fits the music. It fits pretty good 10/10\n\nV: Choirs are perfect. 10/10\n\nO: Considering that 1st semifinal is rather weak, it should pass through. 21/\n\n29 Bosnia - Laka - Pokusaj M: Hm... 7/10\n\nL: Interestingly, this is song about love, though mixed with evolution theories 8/10\n\nV: Oh, well.. Original, to say least. 9/10\n\nO: The image of mentally ill person is completed, difficult to say that something is lacking. 8/10 M: Very strange theme... very strange. 7/10\n\nL: This is the best thing that is there. Gimmicks about balcony and other things are perfect 10/10\n\nV:Quite good for freak act. 7/10\n\nO: Chances are very slimmy, as for some reason freak shows are not very popular at Balkans. 6/10 24/\n\n24 Bulgaria - Deep Zone & Balthazar - DJ, take me away M: Song more suitable for the discos, techno with R'n'B 7/10\n\nL: There are very few lyrics in the song, no verses, only chorus 6/10\n\nV: And for the same reason there is not a lot of vocals as well. Female one is rather good. 7/10\n\nO: Original, but hardly will impress Eurovision audience. 6/10 M: Interesting dance track, and it is almost a miracle, without any ethnic sounds 9/10\n\nL: Disco one, so they repeat same thing for many times. Don't disturb though. 8/10\n\nV: Female one is great, and male one is too similar to Aqua. 9/10\n\nO: To the final. There are no other analogues in this category this year. 20/\n\n26 Croatia - Kraljevi ulice & 75 cents - Romanca M: It seems to be Balkan variant of Russian shanson - Croatian romance 8/10\n\nL: Excellent romantical-phylosophical lyrics\n\nV: It seems that starting the last year Croatia is looking 9/10 forward to bit record of the age of Eurovision performers. Main vocal is pretty strong. 8/10\n\nO: Probably will qualify to the final, but won't be the favourite there. 7/10 M: Oldfashioned and unique Balkan shanson with a little part of gypsy music. Great. 10/10\n\nL: City lyrics about how they will sing their song together. 9.5/10\n\nV: Very nostalgic and shanson one. 10/10\n\nO: This will be the one to beat. 25/\n\n29.5 Cyprus - Evdokia Kadi - Femme Fatale M: For quite a long time there were no typical Greek songs at the contest. 7/10\n\nL: Female version of German entry from last year. 8/10\n\nV: Main vocal and backings are pretty good and synchronized. 7/10\n\nO: It won't do well, but it entertains. 5/10 M: Yes, ethic-horror. Some passages are nice, but overall horendous. 3/10\n\nL: Suitable for title. How fatale she is. Overused. Even Andorra with banal lyrics has better realization. 4/10\n\nV: May be she has it, but I can't say that it is interesting or somewhat different from Evridiki's vocal 6/10\n\n–ò: No chances. 2/10 22/\n\n13 Czech Republic - Tereza Kerndlova - Have Some Fun M: Americanized pop. But tune is pretty memorable. 7/10\n\nL: On the first impression it is just words complied together. 6/10\n\nV: Song do not allow to show it in a full beauty. 8/10\n\nO: A lot will depend from the staging, but Americanized songs very rarely do well in Eurovision 6/10 M: Agressive, flat pop in American style. 7/10\n\nL: And lyrics are great. Especially grapes part, very interesting comparison 8/10\n\nV: Very and very impressive. If song was better, potential could have been realised. 8/10\n\nO: There are many similar songs around. So... 6/10 21/\n\n23 Denmark - Simon Matthew - All Night Long M: Standard pop 7/10\n\nL: Even if there are lyrics besides Celebrate and All Night Long, they can not be remembered with overused same chorus. 6/10\n\nV: It seems there is sort of dutch vocal style... 7/10\n\nO: It will depend on rivals. 6/10 M: Very positive tune, easily memorable. 10/10\n\nL: Protestant one. How they spend night clubbing - but the details were not included into the lyrics. 8/10\n\nV: In it's own style and fits the song. 9.5/10\n\nO: Should easily qualify to the final. 10/10 20/\n\n27.5 Estonia - Kreisiraadio - Leto Svet M: Going on the track started by \"We are the winners of Eurovision\". 6/10\n\nL: Absolute strange mix of words in Serbian, Finnish and German, which hardly can be understood by speakers of this language. But \"I'm sick of sausages\" is probably genius 8/10\n\nV: Well, singing... 6/10\n\nO: Goind absolutely nowhere. If it clashes with Irish Dustin, it falls down and that's it... 5/10 M: Guys have been joking. May be their joke will be understood. But speaking on music itself it is pretty average. 8/10\n\nL: Great lyrics and poor Serbs and their language. 10/10\n\nV: There is no vocal 6/10\n\nO: By Serduchka's path. 9/10 20/\n\n24 Finland - Terasbetoni - Missa Miehet Ratsastaa M: Finnish version of Manowar. Despite me being old metallist - the song is very average. 8/10\n\nL: In the traditions of the warriors of metal, but too repetetive... 8/10\n\nV: No specials, but sounding better live rather than in studio version 8/10\n\nO: Seems that after Lordi victory finns stop to realise the meaning of Eurovision. I have much doubt that this \"concrete\" will qualify to the final. 7/10 M: Well, someone rightly compared this with Dschingis Khan. I don't like it much. 7/10\n\nL: Damn. Why they wrote Finnish lyrics a-la Tolkien nonsense? I so hoped for the better... 5/10\n\nV: It is difficult to hear it in the song. May be they will produce better version? 7/10\n\nO: Noisy and wildly with screams. Nowhere close to the final, really. 6/10 24/\n\n19 France - Sebastian Tellier - Divine M: For some reason the closes comparison I've got is Bosnia of this year... In general it is 70s with the embryo of electronic music. 8/10\n\nL:\n\nV: Original vocal and vocal band 8/10\n\nO: Everything will depend on the presentation. If singer will just be mumbling to the micro surrounded by back-vocal band and keyboards, it certainly won't get anywhere 7/10 M: Very positive music theme. Pleasant and successful. Quickly sticks in memory. 9/10\n\nL: In general love, transformation of conscience and so on. Nothing from Lindblom. 8/10\n\nV: Vocal is pretty good. 8/10\n\nO: I don't think it will repeat success of previous years. 9/10 /\n\n25 FYR Macedonia - Tamara feat. Vrcak & Adrian Gaxha - Vo imeto na ljubovta M: Why they wasted such a briliant song for Junior Eurovision this year... 5/10\n\nL:\n\nV: Female vocals are not bad, but surrounded by double rap... 6/10\n\nO: It is known that Macedonia tends to qualify with any song. Even with this? 7/10 M: Oh, my God! Why they sent great song for Junior Eurovision and to the adult one this ethno rubbish? 5/10\n\nL: Yes, let's drink for the love. It should be get even worse in English variant. 4/10\n\nV: I haven't noticed Gaxha at all. And this whining is pretty ordinary. 4/10\n\nO: Nowhere. /\n\n13 Germany - No Angels - Disappear M: Standard pop 8/10\n\nL: Where have you disappeared, my love? 7/10\n\nV: I keep getting the impression that all choirs are in fact perfomed by one singer. May be I'm wrong. 8/10\n\nO: Oh, again it is not the favourite. 7/10 M: I was pleasantly surprised - europop with interesting vocal development. So the song really fits the style of Europa + radio. 8/10\n\nL: I won't let you lya-lya away, my dear! 7/10\n\nV: Girls band, slightly americanized variant. 8/10\n\nO: In general, may take some scores. 8/10 23/\n\n23 Georgia - Diana Gurtskaya - Peace Will Come M: One of the best songs for Diana, no doubts 8/10\n\nL: Peace anthem 8/10\n\nV: Stable 8/10\n\nO: It is important not to overdo the presentation, has good chances to qualify to the final 8/10 M: Breitburg in his repertoire. Amazing. 10/10\n\nL: Sometimes it is good to prove that peace anthem can be much better than previous examples. 10/10\n\nV: Excellent, sharp vocal 10/10\n\nO: This should be best result of blind vocalist at Eurovision. 10/10 24/\n\n30 Greece - Kalomoira - Secret Combination M: Americanized r'n'b with some bright parts in chorus 8/10\n\nL: Take me and I'll be yours and so on. 7/10\n\nV: Averagely good 8/10\n\nO: Probably should qualify to the final but then... 7/10 M: Eastern motives in another paparizou-styled nonsence. 4/10\n\nL: What combination he is seeking on her it is pretty clear. But it is far drop from Serebro's debauch. 5/10\n\nV: Not so sharp as Paparizou has, so probably it is the most pleasant thing in IT. 5/10\n\nO: They've chosen wrong girl. They should have that one that was more Greek. And this goes to the bin and bye till next year. 3/10 23/\n\n14 Hungary - Csezy - Szivveres M: Very strong ballad, which can do really well. 9/10\n\nL: I hope for mixed variant to be performed as English lyrics are not so strong as is the accent. 8/10\n\nV: Not bad, though song do not demand great vocal 9/10\n\nO: Finalist 7/10 M: Both versions of the song just hit douze. I think it can finish on the top - it is clear representative of current magyar pop. Pure and AMAZING. 10/10\n\n–¢: English lyrics as is Hungarian strikes to the very douze, it just helps concentrate on excellent vocal. 10/10\n\n–ú: Amazing. 10/10\n\nO: Finalist and very close to the victory. . 10/10 26/\n\n30 Iceland - Euroband - This Is My Life M: In the new arrangement ballad has been turned into disco techno dance song. 7/10\n\nL: Probably same concept as My Way 8/10\n\nV: Vocal of Fridrik Omar always was strong, but I'm not fan of Regina and probably he could have found better partner. 9/10\n\nO: Should qualify to the final and won't get lost there. 8/10 M: Stylish and cool Scandinavian hit. Lovers of Swedish music should estimate this very highly. 10/10\n\nL: Well, Swedish songs do not really have much sense in lyrics. 8/10\n\nV: Vocals are ideal. 9.5/10\n\nO: Probably has everything required to qualify to final and get a mention there. 24/\n\n27.5 Ireland - Dustin The Turkey - Irlande Douze Pointe M: Techno-pop, very similar to last year Verka Serduchka, as is aslo staging of the show 8/10\n\nL: Masterpiece. 10/10\n\nV: The best vocals of a turkey I've ever heard. 9/10\n\nO: One of the clearest favourites of the contest. A lot of will depend on the work of cameras M: Loud shock. The worst freak entry I've ever heard. Sorry, but 0/10\n\nL: I see some humour in it, but not more that 4/10\n\nV: I can cope with female one, but male one is damn awful. 3/10\n\nO: I can not call this music. No chances to succeed, I believe 27/\n\n7 Israel - Bo'az Mauda - Ke'ilo Kan M: It is interesting whether they have selected this song only because it has been written by Dana International? 6/10\n\nL: Some deep religious phylosophy... 6/10\n\nV: Has potential, but it is not realized 7/10\n\nO: As sleeping pill may be... M: Another \"protestant\" heresy. 5/10\n\nL: Another \"protestant\" chorals. 5/10\n\nV: Pleasant vocal, but we could say the same about Eddie Butler as well. Bad choice, nothing to add. 7/10\n\nO: Going nowhere. 6/10 19/\n\n17 Latvia - Wolves of the Sea - Pirates of the Sea M: Catchy, memorable tune. 9/10\n\nL: Pirates from the highroad 8/10\n\nV: Vocally probably band could have been selected better as currently they are not very synchronized. 7/10\n\nO: Same concept was not so long time ago at the dance Eurovision and it didn't really work... I hope for qualification here. 8/10 M: Dschingis Khan styles aggressive pop. Swedish. 8/10\n\nL: Thematic. Have you expected something else? 6/10\n\nV: Live version is disappointing. But it will go with beer. 6/10\n\nO: With the costume show probably will get high score and will qualify to the final. 7/10 24/\n\n20 Lithuania - Jeronimas Milius - Nomads in the Night M: Typical Andrew Lloyd Webber. Pity that song is completely lacking development. This is romance of 18th century. 8/10\n\n–¢: Lyrics are absolutely classical, something like Strangers in the Night. 10/10\n\nV: Vocal of professional heavy metal performer, with good school behind 9/10\n\nO: It is pretty difficult to predict this song to do well. Truely Lithuania is the only Baltic country to win yet. 7/10 M: Yes, this is what real ballad should be Typical Lithuanian ballad, remember 1994? 10/10\n\nL: Astonishing lyrics. 10/10\n\nV: And same can be said about vocal. But he should work on pronounciation. 10/10\n\nO: Should qualify to the final and battle with Csezy there. 10/10 27/\n\n30 Malta - Morena - Vodka M: Rather strange melody on it's own, and with this arrangement even more... 6/10\n\nL: The concept of the song is certainly interesting, but that's it. 9/10\n\nV: More singing, less shouting please 7/10\n\nO: Unless really manages to implement concept on stage, goes nowhere 6/10 M: Most uptempo song of the contest so far. 7/10\n\nL: Well, singer knows that there is Gorky Park in Moscow. But it is pretty different from what goes on next. For this 6/10\n\nL: Agressive, but won't it be disturbing? But very emotional. 7/10\n\nO: Russians probably will only laugh but won't vote. Same with others, so chances are pretty slim. 7/10 22/\n\n20 Moldova - Geta Burlacu - A Century of Love M: Agree, pretty reminding Lithuania of last year 8/10\n\nL: We've already had Millenium of Love, so it is smaller copy of it 8/10\n\nV: Should try to get live performance to studio level. Less pressure and agression, stay absolutely calm... 8/10\n\nO: Good song, well performed, but probably won't go anywhere... 6/10 M: Pleasant jazz tune, reminding last year Lithuania one. But this is good thing. 9.5/10\n\nL: From what I managed to understand - as usual in Romanian and Moldovan entries, lyrics are not as important as performances. 8/10\n\nV: I think that accent is really bad. But vocal fits the song really well. 9.5/10\n\nO: Too few chances to qualify, but song is excellent anyway. 9/10 24/\n\n27 Montenegro - Stefan Filipovic - Never Forget That I Love You M: Stilistically very close to last year. Quite average song with a very strong performer named Stefan. 8/10\n\nL: Not bad, but pretty standard lyrics. 7/10\n\nV: Vocal is the best thing performer has, and he reminds quite a lot Ruslan Alehno version 1.9/10\n\nO: I'm afraid that Montenegro may keep it's role as the weakest Balkan country at Eurovision and they do not deserve it. 7/10 M: Something in the middle between last year Montenegro and Austria. Boring. 5/10\n\nL: Guy is singing how poor he can not live without her beloved. We're tired of this. 5/10\n\nV: There are MANY good voices at Balkans. But very few good songs. 7/10\n\nO: Will stay for the second year in semi. 6/10 24/\n\n17 The Netherlands - Hind - Your Heart Belongs To Me M: Strong chorus compared to very weak verses with some Arabic influences in arrangement. Reminds Javine a bit. 8/10\n\nL: Pretty overused lyrical theme 7/10\n\nV: Not bad 8/10\n\nO: Will again balance on the edge, but probably won't manage to pass through. 7/10 M: Why they didn't manage with internal selection to find something better, or now chances were left from the very beginning? 5/10\n\nL: What? Again how she is lonely and everything? 6/10\n\nV: Idol type, Pop Idol. 6/10\n\nO: I do not see any reasons why THIS should qualify to the final 6/10 23/\n\n17 Norway - Maria Haukass Storeng - Hold On, Be Strong M: It is interesting how many unconnected parts one can put in the song?7/10\n\nL: Song about monofobia - dread of staying alone and without love... 7/10\n\nV: Vocally quite good... 8/10\n\nO: At least this is not plagiarized troll, and thanks for that...7/10 M: Average ballad. Devil, how they could select THIS from such a good number of excellent songs. 6/10\n\nL: Again something protestant. But not good. 7/10\n\nV: Well, she has it. But that's it. 6/10\n\nO: When Norges will realize the idea of this contest? Haven't they learned from Guri? No chances. 6/10 22/\n\n19 Poland - Isis Gee - For Life M: Good ballad, but it lacks power, required to be remembered and successful at Eurovision 8/10\n\nL: Also very typicly ballad ones. 7/10\n\nV: Not bad. 8/10\n\nM: Seemingly, song as usual will balance on the border of qualification to the final. Surrounded by many other ballads it may get lost. However, the visual show on the national final was perfect7/10 M: Stylistically very close to Romania. Not bad, I like development. 8/10\n\nL: Very americanized lyrics about mountains and other things 7/10\n\nV: Vocal is not bad, and as both lyrics and music were written by Isis herself she deserves additional credit. 9/10\n\nO: Of course, I'd like to see this in the final. 23/\n\n24 Portugal - Vania Fernandez - Senhora do mar M: Typically pathetic ballad of Babic in chorus painfully reminding old Soviet song \"Ne otrekayutsa lyubya\" 7/10\n\nL: Possibly Anton may explain this better. For me it looks like another religious pagan love anthem, similar to mitraism of last year Bulgaria. 7/10\n\nV: The strongest part of the song 9/10\n\n–ò: I'm afraid that surrounded by other slow songs it won't manage to pass through. 7/10 M: Shrilling ballad, touching the very depth of the soul. Amazing. 10/10\n\nL : Oh.... He will never sail back and won't ever see your tears. Splendid! 10/10\n\nV: What other vocal may THIS song need? 10/10\n\nO: I have many doubts of qualification and 2nd semifinal is overloaded with strong entries. 23/\n\n30 Russia - Dima Bilan - Believe No score Romania - Nico & Vlad Mirita - Pe-o margine de lume M: Ballad with good changes between male and femal parts, transfering into anthem 7/10\n\nL:\n\nV: Since the Voice of Asia victory I have some doubts in vocal of Nico. Young opera tenor surrounds her well. 8/10\n\nV: Guaranteed finalist 9/10 M: Very pleasant Romanian ballad with the development. 8/10\n\nL: As I understand bits of Romanian - something again about love. Nice. 7/10\n\nV: Very strong vocals. 10/10\n\nO: Difficult to predict whether this ordinary track will succeed this year. /\n\n25 San-Marino - Miodio - Complice M: Public has been shown three versions of the song, first accoustic, then \"garage\" and finally video version. It probably is one of the most slowest songs ever taking part in the contest. 8/10\n\nL: Interesting lyrics 8/10\n\nV: Vocal is not bad, but probably should be more agressive. 8/10\n\nO: May repeat the story of Andorra 2007. 7/10 M: Good italo-spaghetti ballad. 9/10\n\nL: Between sex and music I think about you. Interesting. 9.5/10\n\nV: Normal English, or Italian or Emo-vocal. 9/10\n\nO: Considering draw won't qualify. 24/\n\n27.5 Serbia - Elena Tomasevic - Oro M: I'm getting rather tired of sme folk-ballads of Zeljko style. 7/10\n\nL: How they dance round dances... 7/10\n\nV: Good, but quite unexpectedly for slow song, comparing for example with Serifovic one, it can't be really shown here, it has no space for it as vocal line is pretty straight forward on same note 8/10\n\nO: As host country and strongest Balkan entry will again fight for the victory. 9/10 M: Well, yes, it is clear who is author, but not THAT clear as it was in Lejla case. Pretty decent. 9/10\n\nT: Serbs are in own repertoire 9/10\n\nV: I think it is sounding pretty cool live. 9/10\n\nO: It may be a pity but Serbs have a good chance to keep this contest home for one more year. 10/10 22/\n\n27 Slovenia - Rebeka Dremelj - Vrag naj vzame M: I'm getting impression that there is style of Slovenian national final entries... Chorus is pretty memorable. 8/10\n\nL: Let's wait and see, but I'd leave chorus in Slovenia the keywords sound very good in it. 8/10\n\nV: Standard pop... 8/10\n\nO: ... which has all qualifying chances, stronger that Czech Republic. 8/10 –ú: Balkan light-ethnic-pop. So overused. It seems all entrants of OGAE Second Chance should qualify to Eurovision, but with worse song. 6/10\n\nL: I'm waiting to see how they will kill this rather interesting lyrics with English translation. 9/10\n\nV: Not Gotar at least... But far from Derenda as well. 6/10\n\nO: And remembering Gotar's qualification... It has chances. But it doesn't deserve it. You can not win only based on lyrics. 7/10 24/\n\n21 Spain - Rodolfo Chikicuatre - Baila El ChikiChiki M: There is no music as we know it. It is the all-absorbing Chiki Chiki dance bringing all listeners in trance. 7/10\n\nL: Mess of words with some hidden political message. 7/10\n\nV: Also is something non-existant here. 6/10\n\nO: It is possible that whole Europe will go to the same trance as Spanish voters... How it was possible to select this at the show \"Let's Save Eurovision\" from 500 candidates? 7/10 M: Each contest should have it's own ringtone. Though, I'm afraid that this can be another macarena or lambada by it's impression. Despite it is gibberish it has huge hit potential. 8/10\n\nL: How all people love this dance, including Hugo Chavez. No politics at all. 8/10\n\nV: Oh, yes... this is VOCAL!!! 6/10\n\nO: With all scepsis I'm afraid it is prize winner as this can turn into megahit of the world level. 10/10 20/\n\n22 Sweden - Charlotte Perrelli - Hero M: A bit modernized Swedish schlager. Typical chorus. 8/10\n\nL: Very standard love poetry 7/10\n\nV: On a good level 8/10\n\nO: Will be fan favourite based on old memories. However, those who bet on it's contest success will be disappointed. It can get only into top 5 and only thanks to neighbour voting M: 100% SWEDISH. 8/10\n\nL: Everything has it's beginning and everything has it's end. Charlotte is probably singing about her future at the contest. 8/10\n\nV: As quality as IKEA furniture. 8/10\n\nO: So, I've started speaking about what is awaiting this song. Rather sooner than later the end should be put for high positions of Sweden with almost same entries. Though may be later. Everything is possible. 7/10 23/\n\n24 Switzerland - Paolo Meneguzzi - Era Stupendo M: Ballad. As there are real similarities with \"that\" Swedish song, ballad should be called Italian-Swedish 7/10\n\nL: Good lyrics, but the main keyword, on my opinion is not working really well among English speakers. 7/10\n\nV: Doesn't seem to be good live singer, and had a lot of poor performances at San-Remo. Let's see how he will do there this year, and for now 6/10\n\nO: Won't there be stronger ballads this year? There are some already. 7/10 M: Spaghetti-ballad. Predictable all the way through. But we had no such a style at Eurovision since 1997. 8.5/10\n\nL: Again spaghetti lyrics, and difficult to perform ones. 8/10\n\nV: Well, even if he was not singing live at presentation, judging by San-Remo I know that Paolo won't be singing badly. 9/10\n\nO: Have decent chances for the final for sure. 9/10 20/\n\n25.5 Turkey - Mor ve Otesi - Deli M: Song is made of two absolutely non-connected parts. With solid and hit chorus the verses are extemely weak. 9/10\n\nL: Both verses are same. Mad lyrics in all senses. 7/10\n\nV: Vocal has not impressed in studio presentation. 8/10\n\nO: Qualifies to the final. 8/10 M: Solid alternative rock. Melody deserves praises. 9/10\n\nL: Language game with madness is amazing. 10/10\n\nV: Rock one, very suitable for the song. 9.5/10\n\nO: Song qualifies as did Athena, as I'm expecting strongest performance. Possibly will battle for the victory. 10/10 24/\n\n28.5 Ukraine - Ani Lorak - Shady Lady M: Starts with rather long indistinct chorus, but hte effectively \"strikes like thunder\" in chorus 7/10\n\nL: Lyrics are very strong. Hook is rhythmical and easy to remember. 9/10\n\nV: Remids a lot of Elena Paparizou, as is the whole song. In live version is sligtly less ballanced than in studio version. 8/10\n\nO: Favourite of the competition. Guaranteed top 5. 9/10 M: As composer Kirkorov is progressing. Chorus is brilliant. 8/10\n\nL: I think we had something similar with Sibel Tuzun. But let's support it as it is Kavaleryan. 8/10\n\nV: Very strong vocal. I can't remember any bad female vocalists in Ukraine. 9/10\n\nO: Probably will follow Tina Karol's path - finalist. 24/\n\n25"
