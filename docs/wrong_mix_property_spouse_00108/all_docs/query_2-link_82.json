        "text": "Actress Pollyanna McIntosh (The Woman) made her debut as Jadis on “The Walking Dead” back in 2017, the peculiar leader of the Scavengers. Jadis hasn’t been seen on the main series for a few years now, but we’ve learned she’s now joining the young adult spinoff.\n\nMcIntosh will play Jadis in the second (and final) season of “The Walking Dead: World Beyond.”\n\nThe show’s ten-episode second season premieres October 3 at 10:00p.m. ET/9c on AMC with all episodes available one week early on AMC+, beginning September 26.\n\nCo-created by Scott M. Gimple and Showrunner Matt Negrete, “The Walking Dead: World Beyond” also stars Aliyah Royale, Alexa Mansour, Nicolas Cantu, Hal Cumpston, Nico Tortorella, Joe Holt, Jelani Alladin, Natalie Gold, and Ted Sutherland.\n\nSeason two of “The Walking Dead: World Beyond” concludes the epic story of Iris (Royale), Hope (Mansour), Elton (Cantu), and Silas (Cumpston) — four friends who journeyed across the country on a mission that transformed everything they knew about themselves and the world. As they face off against the mysterious Civic Republic Military and fight for control of their own destiny, goals will shift, bonds will form and crumble, and innocence will be both lost and found.\n\n“We are thrilled to have the terrific Pollyanna McIntosh back as Jadis, and we’re excited for viewers to see how she collides with the characters in this part of the Universe,” said Gimple. “In our story, years have passed — we’ll get hints of what happened with that fateful helicopter ride and learn Jadis has new allies and alliances; she is a big part of connecting the CRM and Three Circles mythology that’s seen throughout all three series. We can’t wait to share it all with fans of the TWDU.”\n\n“I love the character of Jadis and I love this world so getting to inhabit her again in collaboration with the talented team at The Walking Dead: World Beyond in beautiful Richmond, Virginia was a joy. I hope audiences will catch up with the first season now so they can fully enjoy this epic final season in October,” said McIntosh."
