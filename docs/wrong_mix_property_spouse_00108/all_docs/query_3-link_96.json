        "text": "Showrunner Scott M Gimple previously teased what we can expect from the \"epic love story\", saying: \"These are two people that have been separated for a very long time.\n\n\"They've lived whole other existences and they have to find themselves again, let alone each other. It's hopefully going to be mind-blowing.\"\n\nThe show replaces the previously announced trilogy of films centred on Rick Grimes, and according to Gurira it will be \"something truly special\".\n\nMore like this\n\nRead on for everything you need to know about The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live.\n\nWhen will The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live be released?\n\nIn the US, The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live will premiere on Sunday 25th February 2024 on AMC and AMC+, but here in the UK, we're still currently waiting for a release date.\n\nWe also can't be certain yet where the show will debut in the UK.\n\nThe rest of The Walking Dead franchise airs across various platforms in the UK, with the original show available on Disney Plus, The Walking Dead: World Beyond streaming on Prime Video and Fear the Walking Dead available on both Prime Video and AMC on BT TV.\n\nWhat will The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live be about?\n\nThe Ones Who Live will pick up with Rick and Michonne as they attempt to find their way back to each other.\n\nThe official synopsis for the series states that it presents \"an epic love story of two characters changed by a changed world\", while teasing that \"Rick and Michonne are thrown into another world, built on a war against the dead... And ultimately, a war against the living\".\n\nIt continues: \"Can they find each other and who they were in a place and situation unlike any they've ever known before? Are they enemies? Lovers? Victims? Victors? Without each other, are they even alive – or will they find that they, too, are the Walking Dead?\"\n\nThe six-episode series was originally set to be a trilogy of films focusing on Rick – however, the project was subsequently re-worked with Gurira coming on board and becoming a mini-series.\n\nThe Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live cast\n\nThe following cast members are confirmed for The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live:\n\nAndrew Lincoln as Rick Grimes\n\nDanai Gurira as Michonne\n\nPollyanna McIntosh as Jadis Stokes\n\nLesley-Ann Brandt as Pearl Thorne\n\nTerry O'Quinn as Major General Beale\n\nMatthew August Jeffers as Nat\n\nBreeda Wool as Aiden\n\nFrankie Quinones as TBC\n\nThe two central stars for the series will, of course, be Danai Gurira and Andrew Lincoln, while Pollyanna McIntosh will also be returning as her character Jadis, as seen in the final trailer. Meanwhile, Lesley-Ann Brandt, Terry O'Quinn and Matthew August Jeffers will appear as new characters.\n\nLincoln previously said of appearing in the project, which he is also executive producing: \"This has been the most extraordinary journey playing Rick Grimes for the best part of a decade. The friendships I've made along the way are deep and lasting, so it's fitting that I finally get to complete the story with Danai and Scott and the rest of the TWD family.\n\n\"I'm so excited to be returning to the screen as Rick, reuniting with Danai as Michonne, and bringing the fans an epic love story to add to the Walking Dead Universe.\"\n\nMeanwhile Gurira, who is a co-creator on the series, said: \"Michonne and this TWD family has meant so much to me, and to continue the journey of these beloved characters, alongside Scott and Andy, both creatively and in front of the camera, and bringing The Walking Dead fans something truly special is just glorious. I can't wait to pick up the katana again.\"\n\nO'Quinn recently teased what we can expect from his character, Major General Beale, telling EW: \"He is the leader of the Civic Republic military and it operates pretty independently of the Civic Republic government.\n\n\"So he doesn't really have to deal with them very much. And he's held in high esteem. He's kind of a hero. He has a long military history. He served two terms in Vietnam and went to officer training school. And he's had to make some decisions in terms of who lives and who dies and how to deal with the mass of walking dead.\"\n\nElsewhere, McIntosh told EW of Jadis's epic return: \"There will be some of the Jadis that you will recognise from World Beyond. She is in the position of Warrant Officer Jadis Stokes.\n\n\"She is still working with the Civic Republic and the Civic Republic Military. So she's a committed follower of the CRM, but people are not just their jobs, and the old Jadis that we got to know and who has tried her best but has lost many times is a big driving undercurrent of where she's coming from.\"\n\nHow many episodes will be in The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live?\n\nThe series will consist of six episodes.\n\nIt was created by Scott M Gimple and Danai Gurira and designed to be a limited series.\n\nWhen did we last see Rick and Michonne in The Walking Dead?\n\nRick and Michonne became fan favourite characters in The Walking Dead. Grimes's character Rick led the show for seasons but ended up departing in season 9 after he was presumed dead.\n\nGurira's Michonne departed in season 10 with the character beginning her search for Rick (a storyline that's very much set up The Ones Who Live).\n\nBoth characters made a surprise appearance in the finale episode of The Walking Dead – but not together – as it was made clear that their story would continue.\n\nIs there a trailer for The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live?\n\nYes! Check out the epic final trailer for The Ones Who Live below:\n\nThe Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live will begin airing on 25th February 2024, while The Walking Dead is available to watch now on Star on Disney Plus. Sign up to Disney Plus for £7.99 a month or £79.90 a year.\n\nIf you’re looking for something else to watch, check out more of our Sci-Fi coverage or visit our TV Guide and Streaming Guide to find out what's on."
