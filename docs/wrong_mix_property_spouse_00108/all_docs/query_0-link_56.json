        "text": "Labelled a modern classic by some, ‘torture porn’ by others, Lucky McKee’s uncompromising adaptation of Jack Ketchum’s novel triggered heated debate when it first debuted. An unhinged family man captures a feral woman, subjecting her to a torrent of abuse in a disturbed effort to ‘civilise’ her. A brutal yet searingly intelligent critique of patriarchal abuse with far more than exploitation on its mind.\n\n2011 USA\n\nDirected by\n\nLucky McKee\n\nProduced by\n\nAndrew van den Houten, Robert Tonino\n\nWritten by\n\nJack Ketchum, Lucky McKee\n\nFeaturing\n\nPollyanna McIntosh, Sean Bridgers, Angela Bettis\n\nRunning time\n\n101 minutes"
