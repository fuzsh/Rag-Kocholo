        "text": "Jenny comes to us from the University of Hull’s Teaching Excellence Academy. As an academic developer, Jenny has transformed the Higher Education (HE) institutions she has worked with to be more inclusive to staff and students from groups historically excluded from HE. She extends her transformative reach through active academic citizenship, serving a variety of HE providers and international organisations as a consultant and external examiner. Her research interests include educational leadership and the interrelationship of staff/student wellbeing.\n\nJenny’s commitment to, enthusiasm for and ability to lead the development of academically rigorous, inclusive HE was recognised in the award of PFHEA in 2016, National Teaching Fellowship in 2020 and Reader in Higher Education in 2021 (she is the first professional service staff at Hull to win such recognition) and the Teaching Excellence Academy’s Collaborative Award in Teaching Excellence in 2021, and Inspire Hull award for Teamwork in 2022. she is an Associate Fellow of the Staff and Educational Developers’ Association (SEDA), where she serves the Executive and Papers Committees and co-edits their Blog.\n\nJenny is delighted to join the expert team of academic developers and hopes to secure academic success through the new Centre’s refreshed offer.\n\nThe Centre’s vision is to inspire the HE community to be ambitious, agile and authentic leaders of transformational academic practice, our mission is to offer inclusive, collaborative and compassionate academic enhancement and development.\n\nHer background in Higher Education includes librarianship, learning design, intercultural engagement, and inclusive curriculum, with a focus on online and digital learning experiences. She is particularly interested in Sense of Belonging at university and how education shapes individuals’ perceptions of their own identity.\n\nShe is currently completing her PhD in Technology Enhanced Learning at Lancaster University and conducting research in the UK, Japan and Scandinavia on the impact of Virtual Exchange experiences outside formal education through a Churchill Fellowship. She is a Senior Fellow of the Higher Education Academy and Certified Member of the Association for Learning Technology.\n\nBeyond Brookes, Nicola champions inclusion through volunteer roles as a school governor and as trustee of Warwickshire Pride. Outside of work she is a voracious reader and living proof that you cannot out-exercise a bad diet, being a regular Standup Paddle Boarder, Cross-fitter and indoor rower, but also a fan of delicious food.\n\nPolly is a Principal Lecturer and Educational Developer committed to raising the profile and enhancing the practice of teaching in higher education. She is driven by the belief that good teaching should inspire learning, nurture self-confidence, transform lives and enable individuals to flourish (Freire,2001).\n\nAs a Learning Development Advisor in the early 2000s Polly taught on foundation, undergraduate and postgraduate programmes across a range of disciplines. Subsequently as an Associate Professor she led master’s level programmes in Academic Practice, Clinical Education, and Global Health. In her role as an Educational Developer Polly has trained and mentored upwards of 1,200 academics from UK institutions and international partners across the globe via accredited programmes, short courses, international summer schools and 1-2-1 coaching and mentoring. Colleagues have variously described her as, ‘my pedagogic rock’, ‘an outstanding tutor’, ‘a trailblazer in learning technologies’, ‘leader in international academic enhancement’ and ‘someone who genuinely cares’.\n\nPolly’s research and publications have informed her leadership of several institutional level projects including: widening participation, internationalisation, inclusive practice, academic advising and digital learning initiatives.\n\nIn 2021 Polly was made a National Teaching Fellow in recognition of: a sustained track record in the design and delivery of transformative learning experiences; her leadership and development of institutional policy; and national initiatives such as the APA leaders forum. Beyond Brookes Polly is an education consultant, keynote speaker, independent assessor, and Senior Fellow of Advance HE.\n\nWhen she is not at work you may find Polly running about in a pair of muddy trainers, baking cakes, eating cake, singing (apologies to the neighbours) or hiding with a good book!\n\nIn her earlier career, Mary was a programme leader for the Professional/Post Graduate Certificate in Education (Post Compulsory), as well as a learning coach. Moving into teaching in Higher Education in 2016 was the catalyst for her doctoral thesis on professional academics/pracademics and achieving her EdD in 2021. Mary’s research investigated transitions from professional practice to an academic role and the findings were published in an edited collection by Dickinson & Griffiths in 2023. Mary’s publications include a peer-reviewed collection of fifty case studies for creating a gender-sensitive curriculum (Kitchener, 2022), and has work published by the British Educational Research Association, Staff and Educational Development Association, and the Society for Education and Training.\n\nMary’s external work involves being an independent assessor for Advance HE, a reviewer for CATE awards, Aurora Mentor, as well as an external examiner at the University of Suffolk for their accredited Advance HE provision.\n\nWhen not at work, Mary is often seen in wellies keeping a Springer Spaniel entertained whether running or walking.

She has designed postgraduate programmes in higher education learning and teaching and fellowship recognition schemes, as well as working alongside disciplinary academics to review their own programmes. She has external examination experience at two different types of university: teaching focused and a specialist art institution and has been through several rounds of accreditation with professional bodies like the Higher Education Academy and the Nursing and Midwifery Council.\n\nSue has a long standing interest in the use of technology enhanced learning, the subject of her PhD is Educational Technology. She created and taught Masters level modules on e-learning. Other interests include the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning and developing writing skills, her own and others’. She ran regular workshops on writing about teaching and learning at two previous institutions and was part of the first ISSoTL international writing group (see Simmons et al, 2013 and Kensinton-Miller et al 2019). Other workshops included supervising Masters students and the doctorate and Sue has supervised both Master and Phd students to completion. In 2019 she was invited to run an introductory workshop, in Spanish, on the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning at EuroSoTL in Bilbao.\n\nResearch work, due to the nature of her roles, has tended to be in evaluation: she led the evaluation strands of research projects, on Teaching Repository Use in the West Midlands, Lecture Capture and Valuing Teaching at different universities. She was instrumental in setting up and running pedagogic research networks that supported capacity building during the HEFCE funded Centres for Excellence programme (2005-10) when working at the engineering-focused CETL and co-created a toolkit and workshop for STEM academics starting out in pedagogic research.\n\nSue is currently working on two projects focused on the role of programme or course leaders in higher education. The first is looking at a possible development framework and the second (an edited book) will showcase some of the work and thinking that currently exists in the sector, both here and abroad (see Lawrence et al 2021).\n\nPreviously holding positions at the University of Lincoln, Manchester Metropolitan University and the University of Derby, he has been programme leader of the Academic Professional Apprenticeship / Postgraduate Certificate in Teaching in Higher Education and has supported a wide range of trainee teachers and existing practitioners.\n\nWithin college-based higher education, he was course leader of the Postgraduate Certificate in Education (Post-compulsory) programme in partnership with Sheffield Hallam University. Going further back, he was Head of English and a full-time teacher of English for several years.\n\nBen has co-authored practitioner texts and journal articles on personal tutoring and academic advising, designed and delivered various staff development activities and been an invited keynote speaker at national and international conferences. He is the Managing Editor of Teaching Insights, Oxford Brookes University’s teaching and learning publication. He is a reviewer of manuscripts for Frontiers in Education and the International Journal of Evidence Based Coaching and Mentoring, both international peer-reviewed journals. He is the Co-Chair of the Oxford Brookes Learning and Teaching Conference and a Conference Scientific Committee Member for the European Conference of the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (EuroSOTL). His doctoral research focuses on academic and pastoral support of students informed by critical pedagogy.\n\nHe is a Senior Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (SFHEA) and was Vice-Chair of the UK Advising and Tutoring association (UKAT) for whom he was the creator of their national webinar series Tutoring Matters. He also happens to be a drummer in a Sheffield indie band.\n\nBen is passionate about the impact the support side of a lecturer's role, including personal tutoring and coaching, can have on students individually, as well as institutions more broadly, and he is committed to developing this field further.\n\nAdrian previously established, directed and led the Integrated Foundation Year and Academic Writing and Communication programmes at Royal Holloway and has taught across a spectrum of both staff and student-facing programmes since 2008 in areas as diverse as eighteenth-century poetry and philosophy, Romanticism, academic writing and literacies and educational development.\n\nAdrian has particular research and teaching interests in academic writing, dyslexia and inclusion, writing in the disciplines / writing across the curriculum pedagogies, neurodiversity, transition pedagogies and Universal Design for Learning, one-to-one pedagogies, the philosophy of Higher Education and didacticism / persuasion. As a successful, dyslexic academic, Adrian is passionate about inclusion and works tirelessly to help enable both students and staff to achieve their full academic and professional potential. Adrian is a Senior Fellow of the Higher Education Academy and Associate Fellow of the Dyslexia Guild.\n\nWhen not writing, Adrian helps restore, fire and drive steam locomotives.\n\nOriginally a theoretical evolutionary ecologist by training, most of my work and teaching has been in STEM and specifically Environmental policy and Sustainability for Business. In my professional career outside academia I always worked at the edge of what was possible in technology and have taken a bridging role, shaping and leading projects by ensuring communication between the technical programmers and the academics/politicians/ scientists/ economists and lay public. I have worked especially on indicators and integrated assessment for decision making.\n\nI bring that bridging role also to education settings - linking what is possible technically to what is needed pedagogically and practically- and where there are gaps attempting to find solutions for them.\n\nI am a polyglot - born abroad as a trilingual third country kid. I spent much of my working life working for the EU (mother tongue plus two) working languages - so I am passionate in every way about inclusion and am acutely aware of the specific struggles that international staff and students face, as well as the issues faced by women in STEM.\n\nI trained formally in teaching (PGCE and MEd (Cambs), FHEA (Brookes) and SFHEA (Imperial)) and have worked in different HE institutions in the UK and abroad (including Oxford, Cambridge and Imperial); in mainstream schools, and in outdoor education centres.\n\nI specialize in dialogic and experiential teaching, digital technology, STEM, coaching and facilitation.\n\nI am excited to be working in HE, in Brookes and in OCAED today, and recognize this time as being pivotal in shaping HE going forward.\n\nBooks\n\nJon Hall & Louise Rickard, 2013, People, Progress and Participation: How Initiatives Measuring Social Progress Yield Benefits Beyond Better Metrics.
