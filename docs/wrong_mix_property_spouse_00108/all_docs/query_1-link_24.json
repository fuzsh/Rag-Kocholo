The colors of fall and the billowing leaves blowing to His symphony give me great pleasure. \n.\nI was sitting quietly the other morning watching the leaves literally dancing as they fluttered in breezes onto a lake that shined with waves whipping about in the wind. It was a symphony and ballet of natural beauty and delight.\n.\nCreating and noticing beauty, the loveliness of life, and the gift of sweet relationships with my littles is an emotional and spiritual defense against being overcome by evil and darkness. I am not a Pollyanna, but an intentional warrior for light, redemption, and hope. I search for this beauty as a way of life. I seek to extend this kindness and life-giving love to others as a way of life.\n.\nYet, one must take the time to notice, or the loveliness of the moment will be lost. Throughout our lives, I have done my best to take my sweet ones with me to observe God's artistry.\n.\nI would ask them to name all the colors they can see in the sunset sky, or ask \"How many different shapes of leaves have fallen to the ground? Look at each design—they are as beautiful and as different as snowflakes.\"\n.\nTo not take notice is to ignore God. So when we create beauty and order, we are co-artists with God. Our artistry shows up in the color of our homes, the interesting ways we place books, pictures, paintings, and objects of interest, all reflecting His imprint on our lives.\n.\nHow will you show His reality, beauty, love, and companionship through your life today? I would love more ideas from you, my friends.\n.\nToday on my Tea Time Tuesday podcast, I speak of moths, a surprise box of tea, foundations of hope, a crunchy salad, an inspiring set of books, a song, and more. Join me, won’t you?\n.\nNew podcast and blog post. Links in bio.\".",
