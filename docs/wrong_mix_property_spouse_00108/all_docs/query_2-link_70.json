        "text": "Pollyanna McIntosh tends to play characters that are enigmatic, dangerous and powerful. Just look at Jadis, the leader of the Scavengers gang in the zombie apocalypse TV series The Walking Dead, or her feral woman in the horror film The Woman. The reason why she assumes such roles is innate, she suggests. “Physically, I fit. I have a slightly lower register voice for a woman. I’m very tall. I’m broad-shouldered.”\n\nMcIntosh also brings her own punk rock spirit and feminism to the parts she plays, but any sense of danger is absent when we meet in a café in south Dublin. She is, quite frankly, delightful. “I’m always happy to meet fans of The Walking Dead because I’m a fan too,” she says."
