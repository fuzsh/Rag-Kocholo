In this case, their stories of social distancing and isolation.\n\nToday, the Walking Dead actress Pollyanna McIntosh chooses joy over stress while sheltering in place in Los Angeles. \"When I do feel overwhelmed by the enormitude of the pain and suffering that's going on out there from this thing, along with everything else, it can feel quite overwhelming in the chest,\" she says. \"And I think where my mind always goes is, 'Well, do you want to add to that mass stress or do you want to put out some good vibes?' And good vibes, thank you, is the bloody answer.\" Let Polly be your guide to finding happiness in the small things right now.\n\nListen on Apple | Stitcher | SoundCloud | GooglePlay | Spotify | PodBean\n\nHi, everyone. The Lonely Hour is back.\n\nWe're all trying to stay healthy by staying apart from one another right now, and that’s the right call. But we worry about the mental health issues that will worsen. Habits are hard to break, and, right now, we're getting into a habit of being alone. This is dangerous for a species that's hardwired for connection.\n\nFortunately, lots of efforts are being made to help those in need. And this episode is one of the ways we’re trying to do the same. The following episodes in this series will be truer to the DNA of The Lonely Hour, but we can't share them without first taking what we're facing seriously, and addressing what some of you have been telling us are your more urgent needs. Some of the segments in this episode are meant to help you get through this period of isolation, some are light and hopefully entertaining, and some will soothe you.\n\nListen on Apple | Stitcher | SoundCloud | GooglePlay | Spotify | PodBean\n\nBe well. And, please, if you are able, if you have one, stay home.\n\nThe second episode of our four-part mini-series, Inner Lives, is live.\n\nIn an era when we're seemingly busier than ever, we're inundated with content, we're performing on social media, how do people maintain their inner lives? There are plenty of columns out there dealing with how to manage emails, commutes, and chores, and relationships with colleagues, friends, and family members—and we love reading them. But, as we do so, we find ourselves thinking: What about our relationships with ourselves?\n\nPriya Parker, author of The Art of Gathering, shares how discussing her childhood dreams with her mother equipped her with the tools to deeply understand what it is that she desired. \"I think exploring other worlds, whether it's dream, or whether it's something like tai chi or painting...can be a helpful metaphor to help you understand your own life.\"\n\nListen on iTunes | Stitcher | SoundCloud | GooglePlay | Spotify | PodBean\n\nThe first episode of our four-part mini-series, Inner Lives, is live.\n\nIn an era when we're seemingly busier than ever, we're inundated with content, we're performing on social media, how do people maintain their inner lives?

But, as we do so, we find ourselves thinking: What about our relationships with ourselves?\n\nToday, Manoush Zomorodi, host of the Note to Self podcast and the author of Bored and Brilliant, makes the case for rethinking our digital habits and being more purposeful about putting boredom into our lives. \"It occurred to me that I was never bored anymore since I had gotten an iPhone,\" she says. \"It made me wonder if these very human states, if we got rid of them, what would be missing?\"\n\nListen on iTunes | Stitcher | SoundCloud | GooglePlay | Spotify | PodBean\n\nIn this episode, we continue with our group of explorers, people who broke away to take a moment–or a week, or a month, or even a couple years–to get some perspective.\n\nBrandon Baltzley is the chef and co-owner of a restaurant called the Buffalo Jump, in East Falmouth, Massachusetts. It started as a pop-up, and right before he brought it to life as a brick-and-mortar space last spring, he left.\n\nBrandon wanted to sober up, and he wanted to do it for himself. Most forms of recovery require community and structure–not going at it alone–but Brandon felt strongly that that's what he needed. And so, in the the middle of January, he went to Denmark, Maine, to stay in what was basically a tent. The idea was that he’d have to put down the bottle in order to survive the elements.\n\nListen on iTunes | Stitcher | SoundCloud | GooglePlay | Spotify | PodBean\n\nIf you want to support the show, check out our Patreon. Thank you for believing in the The Lonely Hour!\n\nFebruary 6, 2019\n\nToday, we launch a four-part mini-series about going off the grid in search of solitude. This is different from a solo vacation; the stakes are higher, in these cases, because our guests are looking to reframe their lives and get some perspective. Will the sacrifice of leaving their families, friends, and familiar places pay off? They’ll get swaths of time during which they can be with themselves and figure things out, but there's a risk, because they’ll also experience loneliness. Is there an upside to that loneliness?\n\nWe begin to explore all of that with Kamey Butler. After a decade in New York working as a talent agent and a producer in fashion and a loss in her family, Kamey tried to regain control the only way she knew how: She bought a one-way ticket to Cape Town.\n\nListen on iTunes | Stitcher | SoundCloud | GooglePlay | Spotify | PodBean\n\nSupport the show through our Patreon.

She basically said: “I haven’t dated anyone in a long while, I’m not sure I will again, because it doesn’t seem to be working out, and I wish people would allow for me to say that, because for one, it’s a true concern, and secondly, my life is pretty rich as it stands, and that should be acknowledged. It is by me. I wish it were by other people.” This episode takes the shape of a chat between the two of us.

I’ve joined up with the team at The Listening Booth, home of Memory Motel and What’s Happening Here, and we can’t wait to show you what’s in store; we’re going to discuss expat life, solitary confinement, fetishism, divorce, and much more. The format is changing—most episodes will run under fifteen minutes—and each discussion will be sharper and tighter (we hope!).\n\nFirst, though, a kind of intro episode. I realize, looking back at season one, that there was a big question I didn’t answer. It’s a question that I get from people every time I describe the show to them, and it’s an obvious question to want to know the answer to when you’re talking to someone who has created a show called The Lonely Hour.\n\nWhy am I doing this? What’s my stake in this podcast? Why am I on this journey?\n\nIn this first episode of the show’s second season, I attempt to answer that. Have a listen and let me know if it resonates with you. And after this, I’m going to shut up for a while and let other people tell their stories as the season continues.\n\nListen on iTunes | Stitcher | SoundCloud | GooglePlay | Spotify | PodBean\n\nOctober 12, 2016\n\nIt’s our last essay reading in this Lonely Hour mini-series. First, though, a little housekeeping:\n\nAs we head into season two in a couple weeks, we’re starting a new Lonely Hour feed on iTunes and Google Play. If you’re already subscribed, you’ll need to re-subscribe to the new feed marked NEW in all caps. That's where all future episodes will go from here on out—plus the one you’re listening to now will disappear in a few weeks, so don’t wait!\n\nUnfortunately, during this switch-over process, we'll lose all your iTunes reviews and rankings. So when you subscribe to the new feed, please take a minute to let us know you love the show—or whatever else you think of it, really.\n\nNow: hoodies. Writer Charlotte Druckman loves them, so much she wrote an ode to them for our Alone, Together essay series over the summer. Listen to her recite a portion of “A Hoodie Is a Haven” below, and read the rest of it here.\n\nListen on iTunes | Stitcher | SoundCloud | GooglePlay | Spotify | PodBean\n\nAugust 17, 2016\n\nWe're back! Time to subscribe if you haven't already.\n\nSeason two of The Lonely Hour will launch this fall as part of The Listening Booth, home to Memory Motel and the forthcoming What’s Happening Here podcasts. In the meantime, we've produced a mini-series of essays on loneliness to give you a little something to chew on. I had commissioned these pieces over the summer—you can read all eighteen here—and I’ve picked five of my favorites to be read aloud by the writers themselves. Each reading is followed by a quick question and answer session between me and the author, too.\n\nThe first is from a friend, Jamie Feldmar, who contributed what we ended up calling, “I’m Not Lonely, But I’m Not Bragging.” Listen to her reading below or on iTunes (click here for the episode, and here to subscribe to the show).\n\nOtherwise, stay tuned, because I’ll be sharing our second mini-episode in two weeks. As always, you can find me on Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook, and you can also leave me a voicemail at (415) 663-5901—that’s 41LONELY01. Tell me what loneliness means to you, and I may just use your thoughts in a future episode...\n\nListen on iTunes | Stitcher | SoundCloud | GooglePlay | Spotify | PodBean\n\nFebruary 21, 2016\n\nOver the last two years, OpenTable has seen a 62 percent increase in reservations for tables for one throughout the country. Is this because people like—or are even growing to prefer—dining alone or is it purely circumstantial?\n\nIn this episode, food writer Jamie Feldmar, who appreciates a restaurant meal with herself, and a videographer who goes by the name Keff, who produced a short film underscoring his concerns about solo dining, present the pros and cons. Then New York chef Amanda Cohen talks about why she not only reserved the bar seats at her Dirt Candy restaurant for solo diners last week, but also created a special tasting menu for them. And finally, I discuss the most private of private dining situations, eating alone at home, with Samantha Rose Widder. She just finished a masters in food studies at New York University, where she completed a project that studied the emotions connected to this kind of solo meal taking.\n\nDo you like to dine by yourself? We’re all ears.\n\nListen on iTunes | Stitcher | SoundCloud | GooglePlay | Spotify | PodBean\n\nFebruary 5, 2016\n\nMotherhood is “the state or experience of having and raising a child.” Its very definition implies accompaniment. But motherhood can be a lonely-making experience, whether it’s because of postpartum depression, the pressures of guarding a human life, or the quest to get pregnant in the first place.\n\nIn this episode, I first talk to Kate Rope, editorial director of the Seleni Institute, a nonprofit organization that provides clinical care for mothers as well as funding for women’s reproductive and maternal mental health research. Rope also wrote “The Bittersweet Loneliness of Motherhood” on The Huffington Post two years ago, revealing that, for her, the responsibility of motherhood is hers alone. “At the end of every day, when I crawl into bed next to my husband, there is a part of me that stays alert, a little part I save just for my daughters in case they need it—a tiny, stoic sentry who never sleeps and guards her post alone,” she wrote. She expands both on that and on the kinds of services Seleni offers, which is a lesson in the kinds of difficulties that can come with motherhood.\n\nMolly Guy, owner of bridal showroom Stone Fox Bride, was part of last week’s episode on social media, but I initially reached out to her to talk about mothering and about giving birth. “The couple times my husband and I were most connected, whether or not we wanted to be, was when I was giving birth to our kids,” she says in this episode. “It was totally bloody and awful and painful and beautiful and scary and primal and I’m still amazed that I’ve gone through that experience with him.”\n\nFinally, Alyssa Shelasky. She’s a food and travel writer who sold two TV pitches this pilot season: one about dating, the other about woman who decides to have a baby on her own, through a sperm donor. In this case, art imitates life, because that’s exactly what Shelasky herself did. She’s talked about it in this article for New York Magazine, and she goes way more in depth in this episode of The Lonely Hour. Full disclosure, Shelasky and I are close friends, and listening to her tenderness here brings me to tears!\n\nListen on iTunes | Stitcher | SoundCloud | GooglePlay | Spotify | PodBean\n\nJanuary 22, 2016\n\nThree months ago, Australian teenager Essena O’Neill, who had more than half a million followers on Instagram, quit social media altogether. She left a handful of Instagram posts and changed the captions to teach other teens that “living in a 3D world” is much better than obsessing over photos presenting “contrived perfection made to get attention.”\n\n“I was so hungry for social media validation,” she wrote. “Now marks the day I quit all social media and focus on real life projects.”\n\nThis detachment from “real life” was, I imagine, a lonely feeling. Even if I’m wrong, a lot has been written about social media and loneliness, both before and after the O’Neill episode. As one Huffington Post writer put it, “technology has distracted us from the age-old truths of what is most important—true friends whom we can be ourselves in front of, rather than our carefully scripted online persona.”\n\nDoes this quote ring true for others?\n\nI first pose this question to Patrick Janelle (pictured), also known as @guynamedpatrick on Instagram. He may have 450 thousand followers on Instagram, but he gets just as lonely as you do. Or as I do. Or as anyone does.\n\nMolly Guy, owner of bridal showroom Stone Fox Bride, also has a large social media following, and while it’s helpful for promoting her business, she doesn’t deny that the perfect world presented on Instagram, for example, has its drawbacks. “The world of social media is not an intimate world,” she says. (PS. Sorry for the ringing phone. Molly is a busy woman!)\n\nKat Kinsman, editor at large of Tasting Table and the author of Hi, Anxiety, will be on a future episode dealing with loneliness and mental illness, but I had to include in this episode what she said about the intimacy that can sometimes only come from the channels social media provides us. “Strangers come to me in a really vulnerable way,” she says of people who reach out to her about dealing with anxiety. “Because there isn’t the physical awkwardness of meeting over coffee, we can go right to the headspace. There aren’t these layers between us.”\n\nIn the more academic turn that this episode takes, Sydney Engelberg, a professor at both the Hebrew University and Ono Academic College in Jerusalem, makes the case that the rise in social media use and the rise in loneliness are directly related. He wrote a three-part series on the loneliness of social media on Psychology Today after this photo of him went viral; listen to hear him connect the dots.\n\nFinally, Anna Caltabiano is only in her freshman year at Brown, but she’s done a lot of thinking on this topic. “At times social media can create a dangerous illusion of being connected,” she wrote on the Huffington Post.\n\nListen on iTunes | Stitcher | SoundCloud | GooglePlay | Spotify | PodBean\n\nJanuary 6, 2016\n\nAs the New York Times reported in May 2015:\n\n“Some 24 percent of people traveled alone on their most recent overseas leisure vacation, up from 15 percent in 2013, according to the 2015 Visa Global Travel Intentions Study, which was conducted across 25 countries by Millward Brown, a market research organization. Among first-time travelers, solo travel is even more popular, jumping to 37 percent, up from 16 percent in 2013.”\n\nIn this episode, New York Times writer Alan Feuer expands on what he wrote about his 400-mile drive on Alaska’s Dalton Highway, which he calls one of America’s loneliest roads. I talk to Yahoo Travel editor at large Paula Froelich, a big fan of solo travel, as seen on her adventure travel web series A Broad Abroad, about “giving myself the gift of reflection” on the road. And I learn what single handing is from Randall Reeves, who plans to circumnavigate both the Americas and the Antarctic in a small sailboat starting in September 2017, passing through four separate oceans and nearing both poles in the process. Oh, and he’s doing it alone.\n\nListen on iTunes | Stitcher | SoundCloud | GooglePlay | Spotify | PodBean"
