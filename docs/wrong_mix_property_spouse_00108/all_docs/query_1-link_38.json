        "text": "The Vikings journey on Netflix is coming to an end.\n\nThe third season of Vikings: Valhalla, which is set to air in 2024, will be its last.\n\nMore from Deadline\n\nThe 'Maestro' Team On Bringing Leonard Bernstein's Legacy To Life: \"Music Is The Nuclear Energy In The Film' - Contenders London\n\n'May December' Director Todd Haynes On Conveying \"Disquieting\" Themes To Ignite A \"Sense Of Engaged Questioning And Uncertainty\"- Contenders London\n\n'Chicken Run: Dawn Of The Nugget' Team On Moving Into A New Era With Themes That Entertain & \"Make You Think\" - Contenders London\n\nThe show, which was created by Jeb Stuart, is a sequel to the Michael Hirst-created Vikings. After its first season launched in February 2022, it was handed a two season renewal.\n\nThe drama begins in the early 11th century and chronicles the legendary adventures of some of the most famous Vikings who ever lived – Leif Eriksson, played by Sam Corlett, Freydis Eriksdotter (Frida Gustavsson), Harald Hardrada (Leo Suter), and the Norman King William the Conqueror. These men and women will blaze a path as they fight for survival in the ever-changing and evolving world.\n\nThe cast also includes Bradley Freegard, Jóhannes Haukur Jóhannesson, Goran Visnjic, Laura Berlin, David Oakes, Pollyanna McIntosh, Soren Pilmark, Bradley James, Hayat Kamille, Marcin Dorocinski and Sofya Lebedeva\n\nStuart serves as showrunner and executive producer with Morgan O’Sullivan, Michael Hirst, Sheila Hockin, Steve Stark, James Flynn, John Weber, Sherry Marsh, Alan Gasmer, and Paul Buccieri also executive producing. MGM Television is the studio.\n\n“I am so grateful to have had three seasons to tell the stories of Leif, Harald and Freydis. I knew from the beginning that I wanted to show the evolution of how three of the most famous Vikings became the icons we know today and we have done just that. I hope when the audience gets to see the new season, they’ll be excited by all the new heights that we’ve taken these heroes. When we started this project 5 years ago, I worked hard with this incredible cast and crew to craft a journey that we all hoped would be satisfying,” said Stuart in a statement to IGN, which broke the news.\n\nHe added, “Of course with real historical figures, there are always more aspects of their lives that could be explored, but it made sense story-wise for our Leif, Freydis and Harald’s voyages to end with our third season. And we really cannot wait for the fans to see the conclusion of this chapter of history.”\n\nBest of Deadline\n\nFilm Festival Calendar Listings For 2023\n\n2023 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Cable & Streaming\n\nSAG-AFTRA Interim Agreements: Full List Of Movies And TV Series\n\nSign up for Deadline's Newsletter.
