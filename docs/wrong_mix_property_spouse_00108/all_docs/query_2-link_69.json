        "text": "The Walking Dead ‘s Pollyanna McIntosh has teased she could be appearing in the upcoming Rick Grimes solo movie.\n\n“I may or may not be doing a Walking Dead film that Andy [Andrew Lincoln] is involved in, playing Rick. Let’s see what happens,” McIntosh, who played Jadis/Anne on the television series, said while virtually attending GalaxyCon Live online.\n\nREAD MORE: ‘The Walking Dead: World Beyond’: release date, cast and everything we know so far\n\nShe added: “We have to know what happens beyond the helicopter. So that might be something I’ve got to look forward to.”\n\nA return for the character would follow her integral role in Rick’s survival and eventual escape in a mysterious helicopter during his exit from the series.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked by former Walking Dead actor Joshua Mikel if the movie might shoot in America or abroad, McIntosh admitted she “can’t even say if I’m actually shooting it at all.”\n\nThis comes after actor Andrew J West detailed his experience working with Andrew Lincoln, praising his “method” technique while explaining a particularly physical scene.\n\nRecommended\n\nWest, who briefly played Terminus leader Gareth in the fifth season of The Walking Dead, spoke to the Talk Dead to Me podcast about Lincoln behind the scenes.\n\n“He is so method,” West began. ‘”He is, look, he’s the nicest, warmest, most welcoming dude in the world. I love him to death. I had such a great time working with him.”\n\nThe actor went on to explain one specific scene which saw Lincoln’s character Rick take on Gareth during a moment of conflict.\n\n“He takes his job so seriously and I loved it,” West continued. He added jokingly: “But, I will say I probably still have welts on the side of my body from when he was whacking away at me with a rubber machete during the church scene.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I think six years later I’m still healing from that. The guy, he’s so committed to what he’s doing and he’s so intense.”\n\nGreg Nicotero, the director of the season 10 finale of The Walking Dead, currently delayed due to the ongoing coronavirus crisis, said “jaws are gonnna drop” when fans watch the last episode.\n\n“It tees us up so well for season 11,” he said. “That it’s a little agonising for me to not to be able to talk about. The last two minutes of the finale – people’s jaws are gonna drop.”"
