        "text": "Just more than two weeks after betraying Rick and the and rest of the Survivors on the season finale of AMC‘s The Walking Dead, jaded Scavengers leader Jadis will be back for a lot more potential back-stabbing. Pollyanna McIntosh, who plays the laconic Scavengers head honcho, has been upped to series regular for Season 8 of the AMC blockbuster series, along with Steven Ogg and Katelyn Nacon.\n\nMcIntosh, who played the murderous Angel on SundanceTV’s Hap And Leonard, joined Walking Dead this past season. She’s repped by Insurge-Ent, Lee Morgan Management and lawyer Stephen Clark.\n\nOgg’s Simon is the right-hand man of Savoirs leader Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). He also recurs on HBO’s Westworld and is repped by Abrams Artists Agency and MGMT Entertainment.\n\nNacon is Enid, a teenager the group met in Alexandria who recently has been a love interest for Carl (Chandler Riggs). Repped by APA and Atlanta Models and Talent, she appeared on the Go90 series T@gged."
