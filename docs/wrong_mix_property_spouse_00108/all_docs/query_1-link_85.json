        "text": "A gallotannin-rich fraction from Caesalpinia spinosa (Molina) Kuntze displays cytotoxic activity and raises sensitivity to doxorubicin in a leukemia cell line\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground Enhancement of tumor cell sensitivity may help facilitate a reduction in drug dosage using conventional chemotherapies. Consequently, it is worthwhile to search for adjuvants with the potential of increasing chemotherapeutic drug effectiveness and improving patient quality of life. Natural products are a very good source of such adjuvants. Methods The biological activity of a fraction enriched in hydrolysable polyphenols (P2Et) obtained from Caesalpinia spinosa was evaluated using the hematopoietic cell line K562. This fraction was tested alone or in combination with the conventional chemotherapeutic drugs doxorubicin, vincristine, etoposide, camptothecin and taxol. The parameters evaluated were mitochondrial depolarization, caspase 3 activation, chromatin condensation and clonogenic activity. Results We found that the P2Et fraction induced mitochondrial depolarization, activated caspase 3, induced chromatin condensation and decreased the clonogenic capacity of the K562 cell line. When the P2Et fraction was used in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs at sub-lethal concentrations, a fourfold reduction in doxorubicin inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) was seen in the K562 cell line. This finding suggested that P2Et fraction activity is specific for the molecular target of doxorubicin. Conclusions Our results suggest that a natural fraction extracted from Caesalpinia spinosa in combination with conventional chemotherapy in combination with natural products on leukemia cells may increase therapeutic effectiveness in relation to leukemia.

Tara pod powder showing a potential antioxidant activity was added at 0.02, 0.04 and 0.08% (by mass) directly to the pork batter and compared with a synthetic antioxidant, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and control (no added antioxidants). The addition of tara pod powder at 0.02% was as effective as BHA (0.02%) in retarding lipid oxidation in pork products during storage. Results showed that redness increased after the addition of tara pod powder. Specifically, 0.02% of tara pod powder was effective in keeping the red colour of meat batter stored under illumination at 4 Â°C for 48 h. Hardness of pork products was the lowest in samples manufactured with tara pod powder compared with control. Results highlight the potential of using tara pod powder as natural functional ingredient in the development of pork products with enhanced quality and shelf life.

Different concentrations of extracts of the plants Caesalpinia decapetala (CD) and Caesalpinia spinosa âTaraâ (CS) were incorporated into gelatine films as natural antioxidants. The physical, mechanical and antioxidant properties of these films were studied. Films containing plant extracts at a high concentration had lower tensile strength with higher elongation at break points, compared to the control film (p < 0.05). Films exhibited antioxidant activity in the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and Trolox equivalence antioxidant capacity (TEAC) assays when added at 0.2%. The application of gelatine film containing CD and CS was found to be effective in delaying lipid oxidation and deterioration of beef patty quality during storage. Therefore, the films prepared in this study offered an alternative edible coating for the preservation of fresh food.

Therefore, there is a great need for new therapeutic alternatives capable of generating an immune response against residual tumor cells, thus contributing to eradication of micrometastases and cancer stem cells. The use of complex natural products is an excellent therapeutic alternative widely used by Chinese, Hindu, Egyptian, and ancestral Latin-American Indian populations. Methods The present study evaluated cytotoxic, antitumor, and tumor progression activities of a gallotannin-rich fraction derived from Caesalpinia spinosa (P2Et). The parameters evaluated in vitro were mitochondrial membrane depolarization, phosphatidylserine externalization, caspase 3 activation, DNA fragmentation, and clonogenic activity. The parameters evaluated in vivo were tumor growth, leukocyte number, metastatic cell number, and cytokine production by flow cytometry. Results The in vitro results showed that the P2Et fraction induced apoptosis with mitochondrial membrane potential loss, phosphatidylserine externalization, caspase 3 activation, DNA fragmentation, and decreased clonogenic capacity of 4T1 cells. In vivo, the P2Et fraction induced primary tumor reduction in terms of diameter and weight in BALB/c mice transplanted with 4T1 cells and decreased numbers of metastatic cells, mainly in the spleen. Furthermore, decreases in the number of peripheral blood leukocytes (leukemoid reaction) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) serum levels were found, which are events associated with a poor prognosis. The P2Et fraction exerts its activity on the primary tumor, reduces cell migration to distant organs, and decreases IL-6 serum levels, implying tumor microenvironment mechanisms. Conclusions Overall, the P2Et fraction lessens risk factors associated with tumor progression and diminishes primary tumor size, showing\n\nGallotannin-rich Caesalpinia spinosa fraction decreases the primary tumor and factors associated with poor prognosis in a murine breast cancer model.\n\nPubMed\n\nUrueÃ±a, Claudia; Mancipe, Juan; Hernandez, John; CastaÃ±eda, Diana; Pombo, Luis; Gomez, Alejandra; Asea, Alexzander; Fiorentino, Susana\n\n2013-04-03\n\nSeveral treatment alternatives are available for primary breast cancer, although those for metastatic disease or inflammation associated with tumor progression are ineffective.

Polyphenols have been shown to possess some potential beneficial effects on human health and they are widely found in foods consumed by populations worldwide. Capparis spinosa (C. spinosa) is an important source of different secondary metabolites of interest to humankind. The traditional therapeutic applications of C. spinosa have been reported in Ancient Romans. Numerous bioactive phytochemical constituents have been isolated and identified from different parts (aerial parts, roots and seeds) of C. spinosa which are responsible alone or in combination for its various pharmacological activities. Therefore, this paper is a review of publications on the phytochemical and pharmacological properties of C. spinosa. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that C. spinosa or its extracts are able to improve the biomarkers of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. However, these studies used different parts of C. spinosa plant, methods of preparation and types of solvents, which cause the evaluation of activity of C. spinosa difficult and involve quite heterogeneous data. There is also evidence, although limited, to suggest benefits of C. spinosa in improving human health. Therefore, the relationship between C. spinosa and improved human health outcomes requires further study.

All accessions had the chromosome number 2n = 24, which was first described here for Caesalpinia laxiflora Tul. and Cenostigma macrophyllum Tul. The karyotype formula of C. laxiflora, Caesalpinia pyramidalis Tul., and C. macrophyllum was 12 m. The formula varies amongst the populations of Caesalpinia bracteosa Tul. (11 m + 1 sm) and Caesalpinia echinata Lam. (10 m + 2 sm and 9 m + 3 sm). The intra- and interspecific variations in chromosome length were significant (analysis of variance, P < 0.05). Analyzing the asymmetry index (AI), revealed that Caesalpinia calycina Benth. had the most asymmetrical karyotype (AI = 10.52), whereas Caesalpinia paraguarienses (D. Parodi) Burkat. and Caesalpinia gilliesii (Hook.) Benth. had the most symmetrical karyotypes (AI = 0.91 and 1.10, respectively). There has been a trend to lower AI values for the Caesalpinia s.l. species assigned in Libidibia and intermediate values for those combined into Poincianella. On the other hand, the karyotypes of Erythrostemon species had extremely different AI values. This study confirms the existence of karyotype variability in Caesalpinia s.l. while revealing a possible uniformity of this trait in some of the new genera that are being divided from Caesalpinia s.l. More broadly, the 2n = 24 chromosome number is conserved. Metacentric chromosomes and low AI values predominate among Caesalpinia s.l. and Cenostigma.\n\nInhibitory effects of Caesalpinia sappan on growth and invasion of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Kang-Ju; Yu, Hyeon-Hee; Jeong, Seung-Il; Cha, Jung-Dan; Kim, Shin-Moo; You, Yong-Ouk\n\n2004-03-01\n\nIn the present study, we investigated antimicrobial activity of Caesalpinia sappan against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and effect of Caesalpinia sappan extract on the invasion of MRSA to human mucosal fibroblasts (HMFs). Chloroform, n-butanol, methanol, and aqueous extracts of the Caesalpinia sappan showed antimicrobial activity against standard methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) as well as MRSA. Methanol extract of Caesalpinia sappan demonstrated a higher inhibitory activity than n-butanol, chloroform, and aqueous extracts. In the checkerboard dilution method, methanol extract of Caesalpinia sappan markedly lowered the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ampicillin and oxacillin against MRSA. To determine whether methanol extract of Caesalpinia sappan inhibits the MRSA invasion to HMFs, the cells were treated with various sub-MIC concentrations of methanol extract and bacterial invasion was assayed. MRSA invasion was notably decreased in the presence of 20-80 microg/ml of Caesalpinia sappan extract compared to the control group. The effect of Caesalpinia sappan extract on MRSA invasion appeared dose-dependent. These results suggest that methanol extract of Caesalpinia sappan may have antimicrobial activity and the potential to restore the effectiveness of beta-lactam antibiotics against MRSA, and inhibit the MRSA invasion to HMFs.\n\nGenetic diversity analysis of Capparis spinosa L. populations by using ISSR markers.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, C; Xue, G P; Cheng, B; Wang, X; He, J; Liu, G H; Yang, W J\n\n2015-12-09\n\nCapparis spinosa L. is an important medicinal species in the Xinjiang Province of China. Ten natural populations of C. spinosa from 3 locations in North, Central, and South Xinjiang were studied using morphological trait inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) molecular markers to assess the genetic diversity and population structure. In this study, the 10 ISSR primers produced 313 amplified DNA fragments, with 52% of fragments being polymorphic. Unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic average (UPGMA) cluster analysis indicated that 10 C. spinosa populations were clustered into 3 geographically distinct groups. The Nei gene of C. spinosa populations in different regions had Diversity and Shannon's information index ranges of 0.1312-0.2001 and 0.1004-0.1875, respectively. The 362 markers were used to construct the dendrogram based on the UPGMA cluster analysis. The dendrogram indicated that 10 populations of C. spinosa were clustered into 3 geographically distinct groups. The results showed these genotypes have high genetic diversity, and can be used for an alternative breeding program.\n\nThe genus Caesalpinia L. (Caesalpiniaceae): phytochemical and pharmacological characteristics.\n\nPubMed\n\nZanin, JoÃ£o L Baldim; de Carvalho, Bianca A; Martineli, Paloma Salles; dos Santos, Marcelo Henrique; Lago, JoÃ£o Henrique G; Sartorelli, PatrÃ­cia; Viegas, ClÃ¡udio; Soares, Marisi G\n\n2012-06-29\n\nThe genus Caesalpinia (Caesalpiniaceae) has more than 500 species, many of which have not yet been investigated for potential pharmacological activity. Several classes of chemical compounds, such as flavonoids, diterpenes, and steroids, have been isolated from various species of the genus Caesalpinia. It has been reported in the literature that these species exhibit a wide range of pharmacological properties, including antiulcer, anticancer, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antirheumatic activities that have proven to be efficacious in ethnomedicinal practices. In this review we present chemical and pharmacological data from recent phytochemical studies on various plants of the genus Caesalpinia.\n\nA new generic system for the pantropical Caesalpinia group (Leguminosae).\n\nPubMed\n\nGagnon, Edeline; Bruneau, Anne; Hughes, Colin E; de Queiroz, Luciano Paganucci; Lewis, Gwilym P\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe Caesalpinia group is a large pantropical clade of ca. 205 species in subfamily Caesalpinioideae (Leguminosae) in which generic delimitation has been in a state of considerable flux. Here we present new phylogenetic analyses based on five plastid and one nuclear ribosomal marker, with dense taxon sampling including 172 (84%) of the species and representatives of all previously described genera in the Caesalpinia group. These analyses show that the current classification of the Caesalpinia group into 21 genera needs to be revised. Several genera ( Poincianella , Erythrostemon , Cenostigma and Caesalpinia sensu Lewis, 2005) are non-monophyletic and several previously unclassified Asian species segregate into clades that merit recognition at generic rank. In addition, the near-completeness of our taxon sampling identifies three species that do not belong in any of the main clades and these are recognised as new monospecific genera. A new generic classification of the Caesalpinia group is presented including a key for the identification of genera, full generic descriptions, illustrations (drawings and photo plates of all genera), and (for most genera) the nomenclatural transfer of species to their correct genus. We recognise 26 genera, with reinstatement of two previously described genera ( Biancaea Tod., Denisophytum R.

Î±-Phellandrene (25.5%), p-cymene (15.3%), and limonene (13.3%) were found in P. flabellifolia essential oil. The inhibition zone diameters for P. flabellifolia essential oil were significantly higher than for the two other essential oils from P. spinosa (p<0.05). In broth dilution assay (ÂµL/mL), the sensitive microorganism to Pycnocycla sp. (P. spinosa, P. flabellifolia) was Aspergillus niger, followed by Candida albicans. In 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) system, P. spinosa aerial parts essential oil (IC50=548 Âµg/mL) had higher antioxidant activity than that of two other essential oils.\n\n21 CFR 184.1097 - Tannic acid.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-04-01\n\n... acid is also obtained by solvent extraction of the seed pods of Tara (Caesalpinia spinosa) or the...; flavoring agent and adjuvant, Â§ 170.3(o)(12) of this chapter; processing aid, Â§ 170.3(o)(24) of this chapter...\n\n21 CFR 184.1097 - Tannic acid.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2011 CFR\n\n2011-04-01\n\n... acid is also obtained by solvent extraction of the seed pods of Tara (Caesalpinia spinosa) or the...; flavoring agent and adjuvant, Â§ 170.3(o)(12) of this chapter; processing aid, Â§ 170.3(o)(24) of this chapter...\n\nAntioxidant activity of Caesalpinia digyna root.\n\nPubMed\n\nSrinivasan, R; Chandrasekar, M J N; Nanjan, M J; Suresh, B\n\n2007-09-05\n\nThe antioxidant properties of three successive extracts of Caesalpinia digyna Rottler root and the isolated compound, bergenin, were tested using standard in vitro and in vivo models. The amount of the total phenolic compounds present was also determined. The successive methanol extract of Caesalpinia digyna root (CDM) exhibited strong scavenging effect on 2,2-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl (DPPH) free radical, 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzo-thiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) radical cation, hydrogen peroxide, nitric oxide, hydroxyl radical and inhibition of lipid peroxidation. The free radical scavenging effect of CDM was comparable with that of reference antioxidants. The CDM having the highest content of phenolic compounds and strong free radical scavenging effect when administered orally to male albino rats at 100, 200 and 400mg/kg body weight for 7 days, prior to carbontetrachloride (CCl(4)) treatment, caused a significant increase in the levels of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and significant decrease in the levels of lipidperoxidation (LPO) in serum, liver and kidney in a dose dependent manner, when compared to CCl(4) treated control. These results clearly indicate the strong antioxidant property of Caesalpinia digyna root. The study provides a proof for the ethnomedical claims and reported biological activities. The plant has, therefore, very good therapeutic potential.\n\nEffect of Hygrophila spinosa in ethylene glycol induced nephrolithiasis in rats.\n\nPubMed\n\nIngale, Kundan G; Thakurdesai, Prasad A; Vyawahare, Neeraj S\n\n2012-01-01\n\nHygrophila spinosa (Acanthaceae) is traditionally used to treat urinary calculi. The present study aimed to evaluate the antiurolithiatic activity of methanolic extract of Hygrophila spinosa (Acanthaceae) in ethylene glycol induced nephrolithiasic rats. Methanolic extract of Hygrophila spinosa (HSME) (250 and 500 mg/ kg body weight) was administered orally to male Wistar albino rats. Ethylene glycol (EG) was used to induce nephrolithiasis. The parameters studied included water intake, urinary volume, urinary pH, urinary and kidney oxalate and calcium, urinary magnesium and serum uric acid. Ethylene glycol feeding resulted in hyperoxaluria as well as increased renal excretion of calcium and serum uric acid along with decreased excretion of urinary magnesium. Treatment with HSME significantly reduced the elevated urinary oxalate, urinary calcium and serum uric acid with increase in reduced urinary magnesium. Ethylene glycol feeding also resulted in increased levels of calcium and oxalate in kidney which was decreased after the treatment with HSME. The increased deposition of stone forming constituents in the kidneys of ethylene glycol treated rats was significantly lowered by treatment with HSME. The results indicate that the aerial parts of Hygrophila spinosa are endowed with antiurolithiatic activity, thereby justifying its traditional claim.\n\nPromotion of spinosad biosynthesis by chromosomal integration of the Vitreoscilla hemoglobin gene in Saccharopolyspora spinosa.\n\nPubMed\n\nLuo, Yushuang; Kou, Xiaoxiao; Ding, Xuezhi; Hu, Shengbiao; Tang, Ying; Li, Wenping; Huang, Fan; Yang, Qi; Chen, Hanna; Xia, Liqiu\n\n2012-02-01\n\nTo promote spinosad biosynthesis by improving the limited oxygen supply during high-density fermentation of Saccharopolyspora spinosa, the open reading frame of the Vitreoscilla hemoglobin gene was placed under the control of the promoter for the erythromycin resistance gene by splicing using overlapping extension PCR. This was cloned into the integrating vector pSET152, yielding the Vitreoscilla hemoglobin gene expression plasmid pSET152EVHB. This was then introduced into S. spinosa SP06081 by conjugal transfer, and integrated into the chromosome by site-specific recombination at the integration site Î¦C31 on pSET152EVHB. The resultant conjugant, S. spinosa S078-1101, was genetically stable. The integration was further confirmed by PCR and Southern blotting analysis. A carbon monoxide differential spectrum assay showed that active Vitreoscilla hemoglobin was successfully expressed in S. spinosa S078-1101. Fermentation results revealed that expression of the Vitreoscilla hemoglobin gene significantly promoted spinosad biosynthesis under normal oxygen and moderately oxygen-limiting conditions (P<0.01). These findings demonstrate that integrating expression of the Vitreoscilla hemoglobin gene improves oxygen uptake and is an effective means for the genetic improvement of S. spinosa fermentation.\n\nBioactivity-guided isolation of spasmolytic components of Pycnocycla spinosa Decne ex Boiss.\n\nPubMed\n\nSadraei, H; Asghari, G; Behzad, S\n\n2011-07-01\n\nHydroalcoholic extract of Pycnocycla spinosa has spasmolytic effect in vitro and antidiarrhoeal action in vivo. The aim of this research was to separate fractions of total hydroalcoholic extract of P. spinosa guided by their spasmolytic activity. Aerial parts of P. spinosa were extracted with ethanol. The concentrated extract was subjected to column chromatography and thin layer chromatography. Initially four fractions were obtained (F1, F2, F3, and F4) and their spasmolytic activities were determined on ileum contraction induced by KCl (80 mM). The more active fraction was subjected to further isolation and tested to find its most active components. The active component was phytochemically characterized using phytochemical methods including ultraviolet and infrared spectroscopy. Hydroalcoholic extract of P. spinosa (10-320 Î¼g/ml) in a concentration dependent manner inhibited ileum contraction with the IC(50) value of 47 Â± 8.1 Î¼g/ml (mean Â± S.E.M., n=6). Fraction F2 was the most potent inhibitor of ileum contraction (IC(50)= 3.4 Â± 0.33 Î¼g/ml). From five sub-fractions separated from fraction F2 (F2a, F2b, F2c, F2d, and F2e, respectively), F2c was a more active component with the IC(50) value of 2.6 Â± 0.27 Î¼g/ml. The primary results of target fraction (F2c) showed sugar moiety in its structure or in one of its components. In this research we have isolated pharmacological active fraction which is most likely responsible for antispasmodic action of P. spinosa hydroalcoholic extract.\n\nZiziphus spinosa seeds for insomnia: A review of chemistry and psychopharmacology.\n\nPubMed\n\nShergis, Johannah Linda; Ni, Xiaojia; Sarris, Jerome; Zhang, Anthony Lin; Guo, Xinfeng; Xue, Charlie C; Lu, Chuanjian; Hugel, Helmut\n\n2017-10-15\n\nIn Chinese medicine, Ziziphus jujuba Mill. var. spinosa (Bunge) Hu ex H.

Sant'Anna; Nascimento da Silva, LuÃ­s C.; Martins da Fonseca, CaÃ­que S.; de AraÃºjo, Janete M.; Correia, Maria T. dos Santos; Cavalcanti, Marilene da Silva; Lima, Vera L. de Menezes\n\n2016-01-01\n\nDue to the use of Cleome spinosa Jacq. (Cleomaceae) in traditional medicine against inflammatory and infectious processes, this study evaluated the in vitro antimicrobial potential and phytochemical composition of extracts from its roots and leaves. From leaves (L) and roots (R) of C. spinosa different extracts were obtained (cyclohexane: ChL and ChR; chloroform: CL and CR; ethyl acetate: EAL and EAR, methanol: ML and MR). The antimicrobial activity was evaluated by the broth microdilution method to obtain the minimum inhibitory (MIC) and microbicidal (MMC) concentrations against 17 species, including bacteria and yeasts. Additionally, antimicrobial and combinatory effects with oxacillin were assessed against eight clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus. All C. spinosa extracts showed a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, as they have inhibited all tested bacteria and yeasts. This activity seems to be related to the phytochemicals (flavonoid, terpenoids and saponins) detected into the extracts of C. spinosa. ChL and CL extracts were the most actives, with MIC less than 1 mg/mL against S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Micrococcus luteus. It is important to note that these concentrations are much lower than their 50% hemolysis concentration (HC50) values. Strong correlations were found between the average MIC against S. aureus and their phenolic (r = â0.89) and flavonoid content (r = â0.87), reinforcing the possible role of these metabolite classes on the antimicrobial activity of C. spinosa derived extracts. Moreover, CL and CR showed the best inhibitory activity against S. aureus clinical isolates, they also showed synergistic action with oxacillin against all these strains (at least at one combined proportion). These results encourage the identification of active substances which could be used as lead(s) molecules in the development of new antimicrobial drugs.

Roxb. is a known drug in Ayurveda to treat various diseases specifically tumors, cysts and cystic fibrosis (CF). The aim of this study was to assess in vitro as well as in vivo antimicrobial activity of Caesalpinia bonduc seeds. The in vitro antimicrobial activities of seed coat and seed kernel extracts were investigated by microbroth dilution assay. In vivo activities of hydro-alcoholic extracts were investigated in rat models of chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia mimicking that in patients with cystic fibrosis. Various extracts of plant seeds exhibited in vitro antimicrobial activities in a range of 22-350 microg/ml. The extracts also showed activity against methicillin resistant (MR) Staphylococcus aureus and ampicillin resistant (AR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa as in the sensitive strains. In rat model of chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia, hydro-alcoholic extracts of Caesalpinia bonduc seed kernel (CBSK) and Caesalpinia bonduc seed coat (CBSC) were injected subcutaneously in the test groups of animals. The control groups were treated with cortisone and saline. Two weeks after challenge with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the CBSK treated animals showed a significant bacterial clearance from the lungs (P<0.04) and less severe incidence of lung abscess (P<0.05). Results showed that Caesalpinia bonduc may have the potential to be promising natural medicine, with other forms of treatments, for CF patients with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections.\n\nAntidiarrheal activities of isovanillin, iso-acetovanillon and Pycnocycla spinosa Decne ex.Boiss extract in mice\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSadraei, H.; Ghanadian, M.; Asghari, G.; Azali, N.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIsovanillin and iso-acetovanillon are two phenolic components isolated from a number of plants including Pycnocycla spinosa. P. spinosa extract has antispasmodic and antidiarrheal activities. However, no comparative study has been done on antidiarrheal action of isovanillin and iso- acetovanillon, so far. The aim of this study was to investigate antidiarrheal action of isovanillin and iso-acetovanillon and their effects on small intestinal transit, for comparison with propantheline. Male mice (25-30 g), fasted over night with free access to water, were treated with test compounds or control (p.o.). Thirty min later castor oil (0.5 ml) was given orally to the animals. In another groups of animals MgSO4 (0.5 ml of 10% solution) was given first and half an hour later the test drugs were administered. Onset and number of wet defecations were recorded for each animal over 3.5 h after treatment with diarrhoea inducing agents. In another groups, intestinal transit of charcoal meal was determined following administration of the compounds. Isovanillin (2 mg/kg & 5 mg/kg), iso-acetovanillon (2 mg/kg & 5 mg/kg) and P. spinosa extract (5 mg/kg) delayed onset of diarrhoea and significantly reduced wet defecation induced by castor oil and MgSO4. They all had antidiarrheal effect similar to propantheline (5 mg/kg). Isovanillin, iso-acetovanillon and P. spinosa extract compared to control groups, significantly reduced small intestinal transit of charcoal meal.

Meanwhile, the changes in the climate and soil topography influence the growth and development as well as canopy level of the lignocellulosic biomass. In this study, Zilla spinosa Turr (Zilla) plants with similar age and size were collected from three main sectors (upstream, midstream, and downstream) of Wadi Hagul during spring (April) and summer (July) seasons. Environmental stresses evoked reduction in the energy trapping pigments concomitant with increments in chlorophyll fluorescence in summer harvested plants particularly at downstream. Furthermore, the biofuels generating compounds including carbohydrate, lignin, and lipid making the plant biomasses are greatly affected by environmental conditions. Greater amount of lignin was estimated in summer harvested Z. spinosa shoots particularly at downstream. Moreover, the total oil content which is a promising source of biodiesel was considerably decreased during summer season particularly at downstream. The physical properties of the lipids major constituent fatty acid methyl esters determine the biofuel properties and contribute in the adaptation of plants against environmental stresses. Hence, the analysis of fatty acid profile showed significant modifications under combined drought and heat stress displayed in the summer season. The maximum increase in saturated fatty acid levels including tridecanoic acid (C13:0), pentadeanoic acid (C15:0), palmitic acid (C16:0), and stearic acid (C18:0) were estimated in spring harvested Z. spinosa aerial portions particularly at midstream. In spite of the reduction in the total oil content, a marked increase in the value of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids ratio and thereby the unsaturation index were achieved during the dry summer period. Henceforth, these seasonal and spatial variations in fatty acids profiles may\n\nAnti-inflammatory effects of caper (capparis spinosa l.)

Materials and Methods: Leaves were extracted with acetone and separated into fractions with different polarities by solvent-solvent fractionation. The Griess assay was used to determine the nitric oxide (NO) inhibitory activity. Cellular toxicity was determined by âusing the MTT reduction assayâ. Results: With the exception of the ethyl acetate fraction which had an IC50 >750 Î¼g/mL, all extracts and fractions had significant nitric oxide-inhibitory activity. The most active being the water fraction, chloroform fraction and the dichloromethane/methanol extracts with IC50 values of 88.43 Î¼g/mL, 96.72 Î¼g/mL and 115.62 Î¼g/mL, respectively. The extracts and fractions had low cytotoxicity on macrophage U937 cell lines.

(Fabaceae), known as \"catingueira\", has been used in folk medicine in the treatment of various disorders such as gastritis, heartburn, indigestion, and stomach ache. However, the gastroprotective properties of this species have not yet been studied. The ethanol extract of Caesalpinia pyramidalis inner bark was used in rats via oral route, at the doses of 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg. The antiulcer assays were performed using the ethanol- and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced ulcer models. Gastric secretion parameters (volume, pH, and total acidity) were also evaluated by the pylorus ligated model, and the mucus in the gastric content was determined. The anti-Helicobacter pylori activity of the ethanol extract of Caesalpinia pyramidalis was performed using the agar-well diffusion and broth microdilution methods. The ethanol extract (30, 100, and 300 mg/kg) produced dose dependent inhibition (P<0.01) on the ulcer lesion index, the total lesion area, and the percentage of lesion area in the ethanol-induced ulcer model. The ethanol extract (30, 100, and 300 mg/kg) also reduced (P<0.001) the ulcer index in the indomethacin-induced ulcer model. In the model ligature pylorus, the treatment with Caesalpinia pyramidalis ethanol extract failed to significantly change the gastric secretion parameters. However, after treatment with the ethanol extract of Caesalpinia pyramidalis (30, 100, and 300 mg/kg), there was a significant increase (P<0.05) in mucus production. The ethanol extract showed anti-Helicobacter pylori activity, with inhibition halos of 12.0 Â± 1.7 mm at 10,000 Î¼g/mL. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) values of the ethanol extract were of 625 and 10,000 Î¼g/mL, respectively. Collectively, the present results suggest that the ethanol extract of Caesalpinia pyramidalis displays gastroprotective actions, supporting the folkloric usage of the plant to treat various\n\nInhibitory activity of homoisoflavonoids from Caesalpinia sappan against Beauveria bassiana.\n\nPubMed\n\nNiranjan Reddy, V L; Ravikanth, V; Jansi Lakshmi, V V N S; Suryanarayan Murty, U; Venkateswarlu, Y\n\n2003-09-01\n\nFour homoisoflavonoids, 4-O-methylsappanol (1), protosappanin A (2), brazilin (3) and caeasalpin J (4), isolated from Caesalpinia sappan, were tested for inhibitory activity against Beauveria bassiana.

It further investigates the effect of incorporating diluents such as microcrystalline cellulose and lactose on caffeine release. In addition the effect the gum's (polysaccharide) partial cross-linking had on release of acetaminophen was examined. Applying the exponential equation, the soluble drugs mechanism of release was found to be anomalous. The insoluble drugs showed a near case II or zero order release mechanism. The rate of release in descending order was caffeine, acetaminophen, theophylline, salicylic acid and indomethacin. An increase in the release kinetics of the drug was observed on blending with diluents. However, the rate of release varied with the type and amount of blend within the matrix. The mechanism of release due to effect of diluents was found to be anomalous. The rate of drug release decreased upon partial cross-linking and the mechanism of release was found to be of super case II.\n\nAntipyretic and analgesic activities of Caesalpinia bonducella seed kernel extract.\n\nPubMed\n\nArchana, P; Tandan, S K; Chandra, S; Lal, J\n\n2005-05-01\n\nEthanolic extract (70%) of Caesalpinia bonducella seed kernel has been subjected for its antipyretic and antinociceptive activities in adult albino rats or mice of either sex at 30, 100 and 300 mg/kg orally. The extract demonstrated marked antipyretic activity against Brewer's yeast-induced pyrexia in rats. The extract had significant central analgesic activity in hot plate and tail flick methods. It also exhibited marked peripheral analgesic effect in both acetic acid-induced writhing test in mice and Randall-Selitto assay in rats. It also significantly inhibited the formalin-induced hind paw licking in mice. In conclusion, the present study suggests that the ethanolic extract of Caesalpinia bonducella seed kernel possesses potent antipyretic and antinociceptive activities and thus, validates its use in the treatment of pain and pyretic disorders.

(caper bush) is an economically and ecologically important perennial shrub that grows across different regions of Iran. In this study, the genetic diversity and population structure of Iranian genepool of C. spinosa is evaluated using Inter Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) markers. Using 10 ISSR primers, 387 DNA fragments (bands) were amplified from the genomic DNA of 92 individuals belonging to twenty-one populations of C . spinosa , of which 378 (97.7%) were polymorphic. High level of genetic diversity (percentage of polymorphic lociÂ =Â 98.2%, hÂ =Â 0.1382, IÂ =Â 0.243), high genetic differentiation (G st Â =Â 0.5234) and low gene flow (NmÂ =Â 0.4553) among populations were observed. Caper bush populations were divided into 4 groups in the dendrogram, PCoA plot and Bayesian clustering results, mostly corresponded to their geographic regions. The results showed that there are value in sampling Iranian caper bush populations to look for valuable alleles for use in plant breeding programs.\n\nGastroprotective potential of hydro-alcoholic extract of Pattanga (Caesalpinia sappan Linn.).\n\nPubMed\n\nChellappan, David Raj; Purushothaman, Arun K; Brindha, Pemiah\n\n2017-02-02\n\nPattanga is botanically equated as Caesalpinia sappan Linn. (Family: Caesalpiniaceae) and is used in Ayurveda system of medicine since ages. According to Ayurveda, useful part is Heartwood, which is bitter, astringent and acrid and is useful in vitiated conditions of vata and pitta, burning sensation, wounds, ulcers, leprosy, skin diseases, menorrhagia, leucorrhea, and diabetes. It is used as a major ingredient in Ayurvedic formulations and preparations like Patrangasava, Chandanadya Thalia, and Karpuradyarka. The present study is planned to evaluate the gastroprotective activity of the selected Ayurvedic drug using three different in vivo gastric ulcer models, so as to provide scientific evidence for the Ayurvedic claims. For this study, Wistar albino rats fasted overnight were selected. The hydroalcoholic extract of Caesalpinia sappan heartwood at the dose level 250 and 500mg/kg body weight was selected and administered orally before necrotizing agents. Antioxidant and antiulcer parameters were evaluated and the stomach samples were subjected for histopathological studies. In addition, PGE2 estimation and protein expressions of COX-1, COX-2 and iNOS were analyzed by Western blot. The plant extract was subjected to LCMS/MS analysis. In addition, Cytoprotective effect in isolated gastric mucosal cells, TUNEL Assay, Acid neutralizing capacity assay, H + /K + ATPase inhibitory assay were performed. The ulcer protection was found to be 92%, 86% and 64% against ethanol, NSAID and pylorus ligation induced ulcer respectively. The hydro-alcoholic extract of C. sappan heartwood exhibited cytoprotective effect with 76.82% reduction against indomethacin-induced cytotoxicity at the concentration of 25Âµg/ml. C. sappan showed 63.91% inhibition in H + /K + ATPase inhibitory assay at the concentration 500Âµg/ml. Our results depict that Caesalpinia sappan heartwood possesses gastroprotective activity, possibly mediated through cytoprotection and antioxidant mechanisms.

(Leguminosae) has been used as a folk medicine for a variety of ailments. The crude extract of C. bonducella and its fractions were studied for antibacterial, antifungal, antispasmodic and Ca++ antagonistic properties. The strongest antibacterial effect was displayed by the n-butanol (72%) and ethyl acetate (80%) fractions, followed by the crude extract (46% and 42%), against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, respectively. The plant extract and its fractions showed mild to excellent activity in antifungal bioassays, with maximum antifungal activity against Candida glaberata (80%) and Aspergillus flavus (70%) by the n-butanol and chloroform fractions, followed by the crude extract (70% and 65%). Caesalpinia bonducella extract caused concentration-dependent inhibition of spontaneous and high K+ (80 mM)-induced contractions of isolated rabbit jejunum preparations, similar to that caused by Verapamil. These results indicate that C. bonducella exhibits antibacterial, antifungal, spasmolytic and Ca++ channel blocking actions.\n\nAntibacterial and antioxidant cassane diterpenoids from Caesalpinia benthamiana.\n\nPubMed\n\nDickson, Rita A; Houghton, Peter J; Hylands, Peter J\n\n2007-05-01\n\nBioactivity-guided fractionation of the light petroleum extract of Caesalpinia benthamiana (=Mezoneuron benthamianum) root bark has led to the isolation of two cassane diterpenoids, designated as benthaminin 1 and 2. A third compound, a deoxy form of caesaldekarin C (also referred to as methyl vouacapenate) which has previously been isolated from Caesalpinia major, C. bonducella, Vouacapoua americana and V. macropetala, was also isolated, together with beta-sitosterol and stigmastenone. The antibacterial and antioxidant activities of these cassane diterpenoids have been assessed using the microdilution assay method and DPPH spectrophotometric and TBA lipid peroxidation assays. Benthaminin 1 was the more active antibacterial compound with MIC values of 47.8 microM for both Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus flavus. Benthaminin 2 was the more active antioxidant compound and showed IC50 values of 42.7 microM and 74.2 microM for the DPPH and TBA assays, respectively. Deoxycaesaldekarin C possessed both antibacterial and antioxidant activities. The presence of methyl ester and methyl functional groups as well as an unsaturated furan ring appears to confer antibacterial activity. On the other hand, the relatively stronger antioxidant activity of benthaminin 2 may be associated with the presence of an exocyclic methylene function.\n\nAnthelmintic activity of Chenopodium album (L) and Caesalpinia crista (L) against trichostrongylid nematodes of sheep.\n\nPubMed\n\nJabbar, Abdul; Zaman, Muhammad Arfan; Iqbal, Zafar; Yaseen, Muhammad; Shamim, Asim\n\n2007-10-08\n\nThe present study was carried out to determine the anthelmintic activity of Caesalpinia crista (L.) (Fabaceae) seed kernel and Chenopodium album (L.) (Chenopodiaceae) whole plant in order to justify their traditional use in veterinary medicine. In vitro anthelmintic activity of crude aqueous methanolic extract (AME) of both the plants was determined using mature Haemonchus contortus and their eggs in adult motility assay and egg hatch test, respectively. In vivo anthelmintic activity was evaluated in sheep naturally infected with mixed species of gastrointestinal nematodes by administering crude powder (CP) and AME in increasing doses (1.0-3.0 g/kg). Both plants exhibited dose- and time-dependent anthelmintic effects by causing mortality of worms and inhibition of egg hatching. Caesalpinia crista (LC50=0.134 mg/mL) was found to be more potent than Chenopodium album (LC50=0.449 mg/mL) in egg hatch test. In vivo, maximum reduction in eggs per gram (EPG) of faeces was recorded as 93.9 and 82.2% with Caesalpinia crista and Chenopodium album AME at 3.0 g/kg on day 13 and 5 post-treatment, respectively. Levamisole (7.5 mg/kg), a standard anthelmintic agent, showed 95.1-95.6% reduction in EPG. These data show that both Caesalpinia crista and Chenopodium album possess anthelmintic activity in vitro and in vivo, thus, justifying their use in the traditional medicine system of Pakistan.\n\nAntimicrobial activity of Caesalpinia pulcherrima, Euphorbia hirta and Asystasia gangeticum.\n\nPubMed\n\nSudhakar, M; Rao, Ch V; Rao, P M; Raju, D B; Venkateswarlu, Y\n\n2006-07-01\n\nThe ethanolic extracts of the dry fruits of Caesalpinia pulcherrima, aerial parts of Euphorbia hirta and flowers of Asystasia gangeticum were tested for antimicrobial activity.

This study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of Caesalpinia ferrea Martius fruit extract against oral pathogens. Polyphenols estimation and spectral analysis ((1)H NMR) of the methanol extract were carried out. The microorganisms Candida albicans, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus oralis and Lactobacillus casei were tested using the microdilution method for planktonic cells (MIC) and a multispecies biofilm model. Chlorhexidine was used as positive control. Polyphenols in the extract were estimated at 7.3% and (1)H NMR analysis revealed hydroxy phenols and methoxilated compounds. MIC values for Candida albicans, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus oralis and Lactobacillus casei were 25.0, 40.0, 66.0, 100.0, 66.0 microg/mL, respectively. For the biofilm assay, chlorhexidine and plant extract showed no growth at 10(-4) and 10(-5) microbial dilution, respectively. At 10(-4) and 10(-5) the growth values (mean+/-SD) of the negative controls (DMSO and saline solution) for Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sp. and Candida albicans were 8.1+/-0.7, 7.0+/-0.6 and 5.9+/-0.9 x 10(6)CFU, respectively.

The objective of the present work was to evaluate the karyotypic diversity and the 2C DNA content variation in 10 species of the Caesalpinia group, representing six genera: Paubrasilia, Caesalpinia, Cenostigma, Poincianella, Erythrostemon and Libidibia. The GC-rich heterochromatin and 45S rDNA sites (which are used as chromosome markers) were located to evaluate the karyotype diversity in the clade. The variation in the 2C DNA content was determined through flow cytometry. The fluorochrome banding indicated that the chromomycin A 3 + /4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole - blocks were exclusively in the terminal regions of the chromosomes, coinciding with 45S rDNA sites in all analyzed species. Physical mapping of the species (through fluorescence in situ hybridization) revealed variation in the size of the hybridization signals and in the number and distribution of the 45S rDNA sites. All hybridization sites were in the terminal regions of the chromosomes. In addition, all species had a hybridization site in the fourth chromosome pair. The 2C DNA content ranged from 1.54Â pg in Erythrostemon calycina to 2.82Â pg in the Paubrasilia echinata large-leaf variant. The Pa. echinata small-leaf variant was isolated from the other leaf variants through Scoot-Knott clustering. The chromosome diversity and the variation in the 2C DNA content reinforce that the actual taxonomy and clustering of the analyzed taxa requires more genera that were previously proposed. This fact indicates that taxonomy, phylogeny and cytoevolutionary inference related to the complex Caesalpinia group have to be\n\nPhylogenetic relationships among morphotypes of Caesalpinia echinata Lam. (Caesalpinioideae: Leguminosae) evidenced by trnL intron sequences\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJuchum, FabrÃ­cio Sacramento; Costa, Marco AntÃ´nio; Amorim, AndrÃ© MÃ¡rcio; CorrÃªa, Ronan Xavier\n\n2008-11-01\n\nCaesalpinia echinata (brazilwood or Pernambuco wood) comprises a complex of three morphological leaf variants, characterized by differences in the number and size of the pinnae and leaflets, and occurring in allopatric and sympatric populations. The present study evaluates the utility of the chloroplast DNA trnL intron in a phylogenetic analysis of the three leaf variants along with other species of Caesalpinia and generic relatives. Our study supports the hypothesis that the name C. echinata designates a species complex and provides evidence that one of the forms, the highly divergent C. echinata large-leafleted variant, represents a distinct taxon.\n\nSimple Sequence Repeat and S-locus Genotyping to Explore Genetic Variability in Polyploid Prunus spinosa and P. insititia.\n\nPubMed\n\nHalÃ¡sz, JÃºlia; Makovics-ZsohÃ¡r, NoÃ©mi; SzÅke, Ferenc; Ercisli, Sezai; HegedÅ±s, Attila\n\n2017-02-01\n\nPolyploid Prunus spinosa (2nÂ =Â 4Ã) and P. insititia (2nÂ =Â 6Ã) represent enormous genetic potential in Central Europe, which can be exploited in breeding programmes. In Hungary, 17 cultivar candidates were selected from wild-growing populations including 10 P. spinosa, 4 P. insititia and three P. spinosaÂ ÃÂ P. domestica hybrids (2nÂ =Â 5Ã). Their taxonomic classification was based on their phenotypic characteristics. Six simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and the multiallelic S-locus genotyping were used to characterize genetic variability and reliable identification of the tested accessions. A total of 98 SSR alleles were identified, which presents 19.5 average allele number per locus, and each of the 17 genotypes could be discriminated based on unique SSR fingerprints. A total of 23 S-RNase alleles were identified. The complete and partial S-genotype was determined for 8 and 9 accessions, respectively. The identification of a cross-incompatible pair of cultivar candidates and several semi-compatible combinations help maximize fruit set in commercial orchards. Our results indicate that the S-allele pools of wild-growing P. spinosa and P. insititia are overlapping in Hungary. A phylogenetic and principal component analysis confirmed the high level of diversity and genetic differentiation present within the analysed genotypes and helped clarify doubtful taxonomic identities. Our data confirm that S-locus genotyping is suitable for diversity studies in polyploid Prunus species. The analysed accessions represent huge genetic potential that can be exploited in commercial cultivation.\n\nAntimicrobial activity of seed extracts and bondenolide from Caesalpinia bonduc (L.)

In contrast to plants that demonstrate uniform diaheliotropic and/or paraheliotropic movement for all their foliage, the alternate leaves of C. spinosa follow different movement patterns according to their stem azimuth and the side of the stem that they come from (cluster). Additionally, leaf movement for each cluster may not be uniform throughout the day, showing diaheliotropic characteristics during half of the day and paraheliotropic characteristics during the rest of the day. In an attempt to reveal the adaptive significance of this differential movement pattern, the following hypotheses were tested: (i) increase of the intercepted solar radiation and photosynthesis, (ii) avoidance of photoinhibitory conditions, (iii) amelioration of water-use efficiency and (iv) adjustment of the leaf temperature microenvironment. No evidence was found in support of the first two hypotheses. A slight difference toward a better water use was found for the moving compared with immobilized leaves, in combination with a better cooling effect. Â© The Author 2016.

In the on-station experiment using cattle, fruit extracts were applied at three concentrations 5, 10, and 20 % (w/v) and compared with a commercial acaricide, Tickbuster (amitraz) spray (positive control) and no treatment (negative control). The treatments were applied at weekly intervals for 6 weeks as surface sprays on 32 Mashona cattle in a completely randomized design experiment. Ticks on individual cattle were identified, counted, and recorded daily. Peripheral blood samples were collected for parasite screening. In the laboratory, tick bioassays were conducted at four concentrations, 5, 10, 20, and 40% (w/v) fruit extracts compared to Tickbuster (amitraz) spray (positive control) and distilled water (negative control). The extracts were incubated with Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) decoloratus tick larvae and mortalities for each treatment level recorded after 24 and 48 h. The 5% Solanum incanum treatment had higher efficacy ratio (P < 0.05) than the other fruit extract concentrations of the same plant species. Efficacy ratio was higher (P < 0.05) in the 5% S. spinosa-treated cattle than in the untreated control but lower (P < 0.05) than that for the amitraz treatment. The bioassays indicated that there was a high efficacy ratio for the lowest fruit extract concentrations when ticks were exposed to acaricidal treatments for 48 h compared to 24 h. Overall, the results indicate that Solanum incanum and Strychnos spinosa individually have some acaricidal effect.\n\nEvaluation of Antioxidant and Free Radical Scavenging Capacities of Polyphenolics from Pods of Caesalpinia pulcherrima\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHsu, Feng-Lin; Huang, Wei-Jan; Wu, Tzu-Hua; Lee, Mei-Hsien; Chen, Lih-Chi; Lu, Hsiao-Jen; Hou, Wen-Chi; Lin, Mei-Hsiang\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThirteen polyphenolics were isolated from fresh pods of Caesalpinia pulcherrima using various methods of column chromatography. The structures of these polyphenolics were elucidated as gallic acid (1), methyl gallate (2), 6-O-galloyl-d-glucoside (3), methyl 6-O-galloyl-Î²-d-glucoside (4), methyl 3,6-di-O-galloyl-Î±-d-glucopyranoside (5), gentisic acid 5-O-Î±-d-(6â²-O-galloyl)glucopyranoside (6), guaiacylglycerol 4-O-Î²-d-(6â²-O-galloyl)glucopyranoside (7), 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenol 1-O-Î²-d-(6â²-O-galloyl) glucopyranoside (8), (+)-gallocatechin (9), (+)-catechin (10), (+)-gallocatechin 3-O-gallate (11), myricetin 3-rhamnoside (12), and ampelopsin (13). All isolated compounds were tested for their antioxidant activities in the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), hydroxyl, and peroxynitrite radicals scavenging assays. Among those compounds, 11, 12, and 2 exhibited the best DPPH-, hydroxyl-, and peroxynitrite radical-scavenging activities, respectively. Compound 7 is a new compound, and possesses better scavenging activities towards DPPH but has equivalent hydroxyl radical scavenging activity when compared to BHT. The paper is the first report on free radical scavenging properties of components of the fresh pods of Caesalpinia pulcherrima. The results obtained from the current study indicate that the free radical scavenging property of fresh pods of Caesalpinia pulcherrima may be one of the mechanisms by which this herbal medicine is effective in several free radical mediated diseases.

The overproduction of IL-6 plays an important role in the prognosis of RA, but the active compounds from the extracts of Caesalpinia sappan L. suppressing IL-6 production remain unknown. Identifying the main active compounds of Caesalpinia sappan L. extracts inhibiting the IL-6 production in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells by partial least squares (PLS). Sixty-four samples with different proportions of compounds were prepared from Caesalpinia sappan L. by supercritical CO2 fluid extraction (SCFE) and refluxing. Each of 64 samples was applied to RAW 264.7 cells with LPS to evaluate whether IL-6 production by LPS is affected by addition of each sample. The IL-6 production in medium was determined by ELISA and the inhibitory activity of each sample was analyzed. In addition, the fingerprints of these 64 samples were also established by ultra-performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). We used the PLS, a simplified method, to evaluate the results from IL-6 production and fingerprints. Each of 64 samples markedly suppressed LPS-induced IL-6 production in RAW cells. The fingerprints by UPLC-MS clearly revealed variations among 64 samples produced in different extract conditions. The PLS analysis with IL-6 production and fingerprints by UPLC-MS suggested that the peaks 71, 93, 150, 157, 168 have more influence on the inhibitory activity of Caesalpinia sappan L. extracts. The peaks 71, 93, 150 are likely representing sappanone A, protosappanin E and neoprotosappanin, respectively. The peaks 157 and 168 are still at large. This is the first report that sappanone A, protosappanin E, neoprotosappanin and two unidentified compounds can be considered as possible active compounds that might inhibit IL-6 production\n\nCharacterization of the chemical composition of Adenostemma lavenia (L.) Kuntze and Adenostemma platyphyllum Cass\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFauzan, A.; Praseptiangga, D.; Hartanto, R.; Pujiasmanto, B.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to characterize the chemical compounds of Adenostemma lavenia (L.) Kuntze (Al) and Adenostemma platyphyllum Cass (Ap) using Pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GCMS) and proximate analysis. Two species of Adenostemma samples (roots, stem and leaves) about 1 mg was pyrolyzed directly at the optimum temperature of 600Â°C. Py-GCMS was relatively fast, easy to use and without samples preparation and identification of the chemical compounds was carried out by comparison of the mass spectra obtained with those stored in Wiley 7th libraries. The data of proximate analysis were statistically analysed using Friedman test followed and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) for data of Py-GCMS. The result of proximate analysis showed that A. lavenia (L.) Kuntze (Al) and A. platyphyllum Cass (Ap) contained 8.27% (Al) and 9.18% (Ap) of water, 11.52% (Al) and 17.84% (Ap) of protein, 5.67% (Al) and 6.33% (Ap) of fat, and 17.32% (Al) and 19.94 (Ap) of ash. Amines, aldehydes, fatty acids, terpenoids-steroids, alkaloids, aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, phenolic, and oligopeptides as part of 125 chemical compounds of each species are identified by Py-GCMS analysis. Hierarchical cluster analysis of pyrolysis products indicate not similitary of major chemical compounds of two Adenostemma species.\n\nAntitubercular cassane furanoditerpenoids from the roots of Caesalpinia pulcherrima.\n\nPubMed\n\nPromsawan, Netnapa; Kittakoop, Prasat; Boonphong, Surat; Nongkunsarn, Pakawan\n\n2003-08-01\n\nActivity-guided fractionation of a root extract of Caesalpinia pulcherrima led to the isolation of two cassane-furanoditerpenoids, 6 beta-benzoyl-7 beta-hydroxyvouacapen-5 alpha-ol (1) and 6 beta-cinnamoyl-7beta-hydroxyvouacapen-5 alpha-ol (2). Compound 2 showed strong antitubercular activity with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 6.25 microg/mL, whereas the benzoyl analogue (1) was less active (MIC 25 microg/mL). Both compounds expressed moderate cytotoxic activity towards KB (human oral carcinonoid cancer), BC (human breast cancer) and NCl-H187 (small cell lung cancer) cell lines.\n\nCapparis spinosa L. in A Systematic Review: A Xerophilous Species of Multi Values and Promising Potentialities for Agrosystems under the Threat of Global Warming.\n\nPubMed\n\nChedraoui, Stephanie; Abi-Rizk, Alain; El-Beyrouthy, Marc; Chalak, Lamis; Ouaini, Naim; Rajjou, LoÃ¯c\n\n2017-01-01\n\nCaper ( Capparis spinosa L.) is a xerophytic shrub with a remarkable adaptability to harsh environments. This plant species is of great interest for its medicinal/pharmacological properties and its culinary uses. Its phytochemical importance relies on many bioactive components present in different organs and its cultivation can be of considerable economic value. Moreover, taxonomic identification of C. spinosa L. has been difficult due to its wide heterogeneity, and many authors fell into confusion due to the scarcity of genetic studies. The present review summarizes information concerning C. spinosa L. including agronomic performance, botanical description, taxonomical approaches, traditional pharmacological uses, phytochemical evaluation and genetic studies. This knowledge represents an important tool for further research studies and agronomic development on this indigenous species with respect to the emerging climatic change in the Eastern Mediterranean countries. Indeed, this world region is particularly under the threat of global warming and it appears necessary to rethink agricultural systems to adapt them to current and futures challenging environmental conditions. Capparis spinosa L. could be a part of this approach. So, this review presents a state of the art considering caper as a potential interesting crop under arid or semi-arid regions (such as Eastern Mediterranean countries) within the climate change context.

Thirty-one C. craspedopus, four C. calcarifer, and five A. spinosa were weighed, sexed based on phenotype where possible, and examined using slit-lamp biomicroscopy and indirect ophthalmoscopy. IOP was measured using the TonoVet and TonoLab rebound tonometers while the frogs were held two ways (unrestrained, then restrained). Statistical differences were determined using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and t-tests. Mean Â± SD IOP (TonoVet and TonoLab, respectively) was 15.1 Â± 2.5 mmHg and 15.6 Â± 4.1 mmHg in C. craspedopus; 14.8 Â± 1.5 mmHg and 18.8 Â± 3.1 mmHg in C. calcarifer; and 9.1 Â± 2.1 mmHg and 10.8 Â± 1.4 mmHg in A. spinosa. There was no significant difference in IOP in C. craspedopus by eye (Right vs Left), tonometer, or restraint method. IOP in female C. craspedopus was 1-3 mm Hg higher than in males with both devices (P < 0.05). IOP was statistically significantly different between all species for the TonoLab and between Cruziohyla genus frogs and A. spinosa for the TonoVet (P < 0.05). There was no difference in IOP measurements between the TonoVet and TonoLab in C. craspedopus. IOP varied by gender in C. craspedopus and between species, but not by tonometer. Ocular abnormalities were minimal in this group of captive bred frogs.\n\nIn vitro studies data on anticancer activity of Caesalpinia sappan L. heartwood and leaf extracts on MCF7 and A549 cell lines.\n\nPubMed\n\nNaik Bukke, Arunkumar; Nazneen Hadi, Fathima; Babu, K Suresh; Shankar, P Chandramati\n\n2018-08-01\n\nThis article contains data on in vitro cytotoxicity activity of chloroform, methanolic and water extracts of leaf and heartwood of Caesalpinia sappan L. a medicinal plant against Breast cancer (MCF-7) and Lung cancer (A-549) cells.

Many preparations have been used in traditional Moroccan medicine for centuries to treat several illnesses including diabetes. However, scientific evidence supporting these actions is lacking. Therefore, we prepared various extracts of the argan fruit, namely keel, cake and argan oil extracts, which we tested in the HTC hepatoma cell line for their potential to affect cellular insulin responses. Cell viability was measured by Trypan Blue exclusion and the response to insulin evaluated by the activation of the extracellular regulated kinase (ERK1/2), ERK kinase (MEK1/2) and protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) signaling components. None of the extracts demonstrated significant cytotoxic activity. Certain extracts demonstrated a bi-phasic effect on ERK1/2 activation; low doses of the extract slightly increased ERK1/2 activation in response to insulin, whereas higher doses completely abolished the response. In contrast, none of the extracts had any significant effect on MEK whereas only a cake saponin subfraction enhanced insulin-induced PKB/Akt activation. The specific action of argan oil extracts on ERK1/2 activation made us consider an anti-proliferative action. We have thus tested other transformed cell lines (HT-1080 and MSV-MDCK-INV cells) and found similar results. Inhibition of ERK1/2 activation was also associated with decreased DNA synthesis as evidenced by [3H]thymidine incorporation experiments. These results suggest that the products of Argania spinosa may provide a new therapeutic avenue against proliferative diseases.

Of isolated homoisoflavonoids, sappanone A (2) showed the most potent NAs inhibitory activities with IC(50) values of 0.7 ÂµM [H1N1], 1.1 ÂµM [H3N2], and 1.0 ÂµM [H9N2], respectively, whereas saturated homoisoflavonoid (3) did not show significantly inhibition. This result revealed that Î±,Î²-unsaturated carbonyl group in A-ring was the key requirements for viral NAs inhibitory activity. In our enzyme kinetic study, all NA inhibitors screened were found to be reversible noncompetitive types.\n\nSome Strychnos spinosa (Loganiaceae) leaf extracts and fractions have good antimicrobial activities and low cytotoxicities.\n\nPubMed\n\nIsa, Adamu Imam; Awouafack, Maurice Ducret; Dzoyem, Jean Paul; Aliyu, Mohammed; Magaji, Rabiu AbduSsalam; Ayo, Joseph Olusegun; Eloff, Jacobus Nicolaas\n\n2014-11-27\n\nStrychnos spinosa Lam. is a deciduous tree used in traditional medicine to treat infectious diseases. This study is designed to determine the antimicrobial, antioxidant and cytotoxic activities of extracts and fractions from leaves of S. spinosa. Extracts were obtained by maceration with acetone, methanol and dichloromethane/methanol (1/1) while fractions were prepared by liquid-liquid fractionation of the acetone extract. A broth serial microdilution method with tetrazolium violet as growth indicator was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against fungi, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The antioxidant activity was determined using free-radical-scavenging assays, and the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide reduction assay was used to determine cytotoxicity. Four extracts and five fractions had good to weak antimicrobial activity with MICs ranging from 0.04 to >1.25Â mg/ml against both fungi and bacteria. The chloroform and ethyl acetate fractions had an MIC of 0.08Â mg/ml against Aspergillus fumigatus. The n-butanol fraction had an MIC of 0.04Â mg/ml against Cryptococcus neoformans. The hexane and chloroform fractions had an MIC of 0.08Â mg/ml against Staphylococcus aureus. The antioxidant activities were much lower than that of the positive controls. Except for the alkaloid extract, all the extracts and fractions had free-radical-scavenging activity (IC50 ranging from 33.66 to 314.30Â Î¼g/ml). The cytotoxicity on Vero cells was reasonable to low with LC50 values ranging between 30.56 and 689.39Â Î¼g/ml. The acetone extract and the chloroform fraction had the highest antibacterial activity. By solvent-solvent fractionation it was possible to increase the activity against A. fumigatus and to decrease the cytotoxicity leading to a potentially useful product to protect animals against aspergillosis. Our results therefore support the use of S. spinosa leaves in traditional medicine to treat infectious diseases.\n\nPreparative separation of bioactive compounds from essential oil of Flaveria bidentis (L.) Kuntze using steam distillation extraction and one step high-speed counter-current chromatography.\n\nPubMed\n\nWei, Yun; Du, Jilin; Lu, Yuanyuan\n\n2012-10-01\n\nIn order to utilize and control the invasive weed, bioactive compounds from essential oil of Flaveria bidentis (L.) Kuntze were studied. Steam distillation extraction and one step high-speed counter-current chromatography were applied to separate and purify the caryophyllene oxide, 7,11-dimethyl-3-methylene-1,6,10-dodecatriene, and caryophyllene from essential oil of Flaveria bidentis (L.) Kuntze. The two-phase solvent system containing n-hexane/acetonitrile/ethanol (5:4:3, v/v/v) was selected for the one step separation mode according to the partition coefficient values (K) of the target compounds and the separation factor (Î±). The purity of each isolated fraction after a single high-speed counter-current chromatography run was determined by high performance liquid chromatography. A 3.2 mg of caryophyllene oxide at a purity of 92.6%, 10.4 mg of 7,11-dimethyl-3-methylene-1,6,10-dodecatriene at a purity of 99.1% and 5.7 mg of caryophyllene at a purity of 98.8% were obtained from 200 mg essential oil of Flaveria bidentis (L.) Kuntze. The chemical structures of these components were identified by GC-MS, (1) H-NMR, and (13) C-NMR. Â© 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Dissolved oxygen, an important contributing factor in aerobic microbial fermentation, however, is not always available in sufficient amounts. To alleviate oxygen limitation in spinosad production, three different oxygen vectors, namely oleic acid, toluene, and n-dodecane, were added into early fermentation. Results indicated that n-dodecane was the optimal oxygen vector. Spinosad yield was increased by 44.2% compared to that in the control group in the presence of 0.5% n-dodecane, added after 120Â h of incubation. Yields of the test group reached 6.52Â mg/g dry cell weight (DCW), while that of the control group was limited to 4.52Â mg/g DCW. Metabolomics analysis by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry was performed to demonstrate the metabolism mechanism in the presence and absence of oxygen vector. In total, 78 principal intracellular metabolites in S. spinosa were detected and quantified in the presence and absence of n-dodecane. Levels of some metabolites that were related to the tricarboxylic acid cycle and pentose phosphate pathway varied significantly. Aspartic acid and glucose-1-phosphate levels varied significantly and contributed most in the distinction of the fermentation conditions and phases. The above findings give new insights into the improvement and the metabolomic characteristics of industrial spinosad production.\n\nMonoicy in A. angustifolia (Bert.) O. Kuntze (Araucariaceae): I. Morphological aspects of the reproductive structures.\n\nPubMed\n\nStefenon, Valdir M; Caprestano, Clarissa A\n\n2009-12-01\n\nAraucaria angustifolia (Bert.) O. Kuntze is a dioecious conifer species native of Brazil. The rare occurrence of monoiceous specimens have been attributed to pathogenic infections or other injuries in adult trees. Here, the morphological characteristics of male and female cones and pollen grains of a monoiceous A. angustifolia are described. Male and female cones and pollen grains presented normal morphology, lacking any sort of injuries or infection and suggesting the existence of further grounds for the occurrence of monoicy in this conifer species.\n\nReliance on deep soil water in the tree species Argania spinosa.\n\nPubMed\n\nZunzunegui, M; Boutaleb, S; DÃ­az Barradas, M C; Esquivias, M P; Valera, J; JÃ¡uregui, J; Tagma, T; Ain-Lhout, F\n\n2017-12-07\n\nIn South-western Morocco, water scarcity and high temperature are the main factors determining species survival. Argania spinosa (L.) Skeels is a tree species, endemic to Morocco, which is suffering from ongoing habitat shrinkage. Argan trees play essential local ecological and economic roles: protecting soils from erosion, shading different types of crops, helping maintain soil fertility and, even more importantly, its seeds are used by the local population for oil production, with valuable nutritional, medicinal and cosmetic purposes. The main objective of this study was to identify the sources of water used by this species and to assess the effect of water availability on the photosynthetic rate and stem water potential in two populations: one growing on the coast and a second one 10 km inland. Stem water potential, photosynthetic rate and xylem water isotopic composition (Î´18O) were seasonally monitored during 2 years. Trees from both populations showed a similar strategy in the use of the available water sources, which was strongly dependent on deep soil water throughout the year. Nevertheless, during the wet season or under low precipitation a more complex water uptake pattern was found with a mixture of water sources, including precipitation and soil at different depths. No evidence was found of the use of either groundwater or atmospheric water in this species. Despite the similar water-use strategy, the results indicate that Argania trees from the inland population explored deeper layers than coastal ones as suggested by more depleted Î´18O values recorded in the inland trees and better photosynthetic performance, hence suggesting that the coastal population of A. spinosa could be subjected to higher stress.

The type of macroporous resins was optimized by static adsorption method. The optimum technological conditions of saponins from Ziziphi Spinosae Semen was screened by single factor test and Box-Behnken Design-Response Surface Methodology. AB-8 macroporous resin had better purification effect of total saponins than other resins, optimum technological parameters were as follows: column height-diameter ratio was 5: 1, the concentration of sample solution was 2. 52 mg/mL, resin adsorption quantity was 8. 915 mg/g, eluted by 3 BV water, flow rate of adsorption and elution was 2 BV/h, elution solvent was 75% ethanol, elution solvent volume was 5 BV. AB-8 macroporous resin has a good purification effect on jujuboside A.

Their in vitro anti-influenza virus activities were evaluated with the cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction method. The results showed that 3-deoxysappanchalcone and sappanchalcone exhibited the highest activity against influenza virus (H3N2) with IC50 values of 1.06 and 2.06 microg/mL, respectively, in comparison to the positive control oseltamivir acid and ribavirin with IC50 values of 0.065 and 9.17 microg/mL, respectively.\n\nEffect of Leaves of Caesalpinia decapetala on Oxidative Stability of Oil-in-Water Emulsions\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGallego, MarÃ­a Gabriela; Skowyra, Monika; Gordon, Michael H.; Azman, Nurul Aini Mohd; Almajano, MarÃ­a Pilar\n\n2017-01-01\n\nCaesalpinia decapetala (Roth) Alston (Fabaceae) (CD) is used in folk medicine to prevent colds and treat bronchitis. This plant has antitumor and antioxidant activity. The antioxidant effects of an extract from Caesalpinia decapetala (Fabaceae) were assessed by storage of model food oil-in-water emulsions with analysis of primary and secondary oxidation products. The antioxidant capacity of the plant extract was evaluated by the diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH), Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays and by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Lyophilized extracts of CD were added at concentrations of 0.002%, 0.02% and 0.2% into oil-in-water emulsions, which were stored for 30 days at 33 Â± 1 Â°C, and then, oxidative stability was evaluated. The CD extract had high antioxidant activity (700 Â± 70 Âµmol Trolox/g dry plant for the ORAC assay), mainly due to its phenolic components: gallic acid, quercetin, catechin, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and p-coumaric acid. At a concentration of 0.2%, the extract significantly reduced the oxidative deterioration of oil-in-water emulsions. The results of the present study show the possibility of utilizing CD as a promising source of natural antioxidants for retarding lipid oxidation in the food and cosmetic industries.
