John B's scheduled move to a foster home is postponed due to a hurricane. After the hurricane, the Pogues find a key to a motel room onboard a sunken ship in the marsh. The room safe has an envelope, a gun, and a large amount of cash. JJ grabs the gun and a handful of cash from the room. Later that night the Pogues go to a beach party and John B gets into a scuffle with Topper (one of the Pogues' rivals, part of the wealthy gang of Kooks). JJ threatens Topper with the gun from the motel room when Topper tries to drown John B. Later on, John B borrows scuba gear from his employer (Ward Cameron, father of \"Kook princess\" Sarah) so they can explore the wreck. While leaving the boat crash site they are chased and shot at by two other men in a boat, but Kiara sabotages the men's boat and they get away. When they arrive home they find John B's father's compass in a bag from the wreck.\n\n22\"The Lucky Compass\"Jonas PateShannon BurkeApril 15, 2020 ( )\n\nSarah catches John B returning the scuba gear and agrees not to tell Ward but her younger sister, Wheezie, overhears them and tells Topper, who tells Ward when Sarah acts cagey, causing Ward to fire John B. John B and JJ find Lana, Scooter's wife, being threatened by the two men who chased them off the boat. They try to help, but she tells them the compass is dangerous and asks them to leave. John B finds a clue inside it: \"Redfield\". The two men show up looking for the clues from the Merchant. The group gets away and goes to the Redfield lighthouse, where a man tells them where to find the Merchant but calls the cops on them when he sees the compass. JJ and Pope get away but Kiara and John B get caught and are bailed out by Kiara's dad. John B is chased by the two men again, but they leave when the sheriff shows up. He decides to give the compass to Sheriff Peterkin and finds out his great-grandmother's maiden name is Redfield. The Pogues drive out to her grave and Kiara finds something.\n\n33\"The Forbidden Zone\"Cherie NowlanJosh PateApril 15, 2020 ( )\n\nKiara finds an envelope with a map of the Royal Merchant wreck and a tape recorder with John B's father telling John B to finish what he started.

Topper finds his sunken boat and he, Rafe, and Kelce deduce that it was sunk by Pope. At Tannyhill, John B asks Sarah about a portrait on the wall of her father's office, which she reveals is a portrait of Denmark Tanny, creator of Tannyhill.

Peterkin also knows about the Merchant thanks to a mystery benefactor who also has the compass, later revealed to be Ward. The Pogues crash the MidSummers party where John B tells Sarah to bring him a plat map of Tannyhill (where Denmark Tanny's letter, found in Big John Routledge's belongings, reveals the gold to be).

Sarah and Kiara work out their issues; at the Crain house, the girls deactivate the motion sensors; the boys go into the basement to retrieve the gold but the noise awakens Mrs. Crain.

JJ steals Barry's cash stash and goes back home but it doesn't work out. JJ stands up to Luke and leaves, before spending the cash on a hot tub. When Kiara and Pope show up, JJ breaks down, revealing that he got the hot tub for the Pogues - his family. Sarah and John B have sex in his secret spot. On the fishing trip, while trying to get John B to partner with him to retrieve the gold, Ward reveals everything he knows, including \"Redfield\" - the last message from Big John before his disappearance. John B realizes Ward was involved in Big John's disappearance and turns the boat around, intending to turn Ward in to the police.

As John B evades the manhunt, he is trapped by Kelce and Topper, but briefly escapes; Topper then discovers Sarah and John B's hiding spot and alerts the police about their location.

At Angel Oak, the Pogues realize the true treasure is Cecilia's body; they lay a wreath on her casket and bury her again after Rafe, Renfield and Limbrey defiled her grave looking for the cross. An inscription on the Merchant's spyglass, hidden in the tree, reveals the cross is at the church. JJ and Kie get her dad's truck so the Pogues can get to the church; Luke leaves Kildare for good and JJ says goodbye to his dad. At the church, Pope gets an idea when he sees wooden crosses above them through the spyglass. He uses a crowbar to reveal the cross under two hollow beams.

In a 25-page opinion, Batten noted that the plots of Wooten's novel and the series shared similarities with respect to the themes of shipwrecks and finding buried treasure but opined that the substantial differences in other aspects, such as the plot and characterization, meant that analyzing the plots of both works \"at such a high level of abstraction would render every work involving a hunt for treasure susceptible to copyright infringement.\"[45][46]\n\nYear Award Category Nominee(s) Result Ref. 2020 People's Choice Awards The Show of 2020 Outer Banks Nominated [47] The Drama Show of 2020 Nominated The Bingeworthy Show of 2020 Won The Male TV Star of 2020 Chase Stokes Nominated The Drama TV Star of 2020 Nominated 2021 MTV Movie & TV Awards Best Kiss Chase Stokes and Madelyn Cline Won [48] 2023 MTV Movie & TV Awards Best Kick-Ass Cast Outer Banks Nominated [49] Best Kiss Madison Bailey and Rudy Pankow Won\n\nOn February 18, 2023, Netflix held a fan event called 'Poguelandia' in Huntington Beach, California.
