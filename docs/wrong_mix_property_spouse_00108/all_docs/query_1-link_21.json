        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\n\"The Walking Dead\" cast cleans up pretty well.\n\nSome actors wear wigs and prosthetics that make them look nearly unrecognizable on the show.\n\nInsider rounds up the many current and previous cast members to see how they look in real life.\n\nVisit Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRick Grimes was constantly covered in blood and guts in the zombie apocalypse.\n\nOver the course of the show, Rick led a group of survivors through the zombie apocalypse. On season nine, his hair was shorter and grayer.\n\nThe last time we saw Rick, he was carried away on a mystery helicopter. We learned more about the people who took him in the spinoff, \"TWD: World Beyond.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though he left the show, British actor Andrew Lincoln keeps the beard partially intact.\n\nSeason nine may have been Andrew Lincoln's final season as Rick Grimes, but he's set to return in \"TWD\" movies, which will continue the character's story. So far, we know the first movie is set to be made by Universal.\n\n\"TWD\" universe chief content officer Scott Gimple recently told Insider Lincoln is very involved in the Grimes' films.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichonne watched over Alexandria with Rick gone until she went off in search of him.\n\nMichonne started a relationship with Rick, her longtime partner-in-crime, to the delight of many fans on season six. (You can read more about the Richonne pairing here and how it's been in the work for years here.)\n\nThe character left the show during season 10 after finding clues that Rick may still be alive. She's now on the search for her love.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn real life, Danai Gurira looks completely unrecognizable without her Michonne wig.\n\nGurira is still a fan favorite, but she's now a worldwide star after appearances in \"Black Panther\" and \"Avengers: Infinity War.\"\n\nShe is currently filming the \"Black Panther\" sequel \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\" and is also expected to reprise her role as Okoye in the franchise again for a TV show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRick's son Carl lost his eye from a rogue bullet. On the show, he was almost always seen wearing his dad's sheriff's hat.\n\nMany expected Carl to be the future of the show, but his time was cut short when he was killed off on season eight. Though the actor continued to mock the silly way in which his character was killed, he told Insider he had no hard feelings.\n\nChandler Riggs grew up on set of \"The Walking Dead.\" After leaving the show in 2018, Riggs cut his hair short.\n\nRiggs played Patrick \"PJ\" Nelson in a 9-episode arc on ABC's \"A Million Little Things\" in 2019. He also appeared in two 2019 movies, \"Inherit the Viper\" and \"Only.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarl's love interest Enid moved into the Hilltop and was a practicing doctor.\n\nEnid looked after Maggie since Glenn's death. After the time jump, she had a new sense of purpose as a doctor and a budding relationship with Alden.\n\nNacon's name was added to the opening credits for season nine. For the time jump, she was finally able to cut her long hair short, something she told Insider she was very excited about. Her character was shockingly killed off by the season's end in a big moment from the comics that was brought to life.\n\nNacon told Insider she was surprised more big characters weren't killed off alongside her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nActress Katelyn Nacon looks more chic in real life.\n\nYou may not have realized she was on Adult Swim's 2014 viral spoof \"Too Many Cooks.\" Nacon joined the second season of Hulu's \"Light as a Feather.\"\n\nShe'll star alongside Rhea Seehorn and Tony Shalhoub in the sci-fi dramedy \"Linoleum\" later this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlden was originally a reluctant Savior, but became a trusted member of the Hilltop.\n\nAlden was in a relationship with Enid until she was killed by the Whisperers. Actress Katelyn Nacon told Insider after the time jump, Enid was supposed to be 23, while Alden is about 29.\n\nCallan McAuliffe looks more or less the same outside the show.\n\nBefore he was on \"TWD,\" McAuliffe was the young Jay Gatsby in 2013's \"The Great Gatsby.\" He also appeared on an episode of \"Homeland\" in 2014 and had a role in the Australian political comedy \"Blow Your Own Trumpet\" in 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarl's sister Judith was aged up after a time jump on season nine.\n\nThe older Judith Grimes was introduced on season nine, episode six with her own little sword and gun. Fans instantly fell for the feisty young actress behind the role.\n\nShe appears to be a blend between Lori, Carl, and Michonne, the latter of whom is her caretaker. So far, we've seen Judith have a great bond with Negan on the show. After Michonne left in search of Rick, Daryl is currently in charge of Judith and her brother, R.J.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Star Wars\" actress Cailey Fleming landed the role of Judith on the show.\n\nYou've seen Fleming appear as a young Rey in the \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\" She also played Jennifer Garner's daughter in 2018's \"Peppermint\" and appeared on AMC's \"Preacher\" and FX's \"Better Things.\" She even had a role on the hit Disney Plus series \"Loki.\"\n\n\"She came in and she had so much personality and life and was a great person. We just knew she'd be a perfect fit for the cast,\" showrunner Angela Kang told Insider of Fleming getting cast on the show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNegan was locked up at the end of season eight after the war with Rick. Lately, he's been an alley to Daryl and the group.\n\nThough Negan's throat was slashed at the end of season eight, he loves to hear himself talk. The character was locked up in a cell for much of season nine. Though he escaped, Negan found he didn't really care much for the world outside Alexandria if he had to go it alone.\n\nSince then, he's slowly started to redeem himself after saving Judith's life and taking it upon himself to team up with Carol to kill the Whisperer leader, Alpha. Currently, it's a bit unclear how he'll fit in with the survivors, if at all, moving forward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJeffrey Dean Morgan, known for his roles on \"The Good Wife\" and \"Grey's Anatomy,\" couldn't wait to audition for the role.\n\nMorgan's hair has been shorter for the show since season nine. He married longtime girlfriend Hilarie Burton Morgan after an appearance at 2019's New York Comic Con. She began appearing on the show as Lucielle in 2021.\n\nMorgan recently starred in the religious-themed horror film \"The Unholy\" and will star alongside Michael Raymond-James, Jordana Brewster, and Jordana Brewster in the upcoming drama \"The Integrity of Joseph Chambers.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAustin Amelio joined the cast on season six as one of Negan's Saviors, Dwight, and is now on \"Fear TWD.\"\n\nDaryl sent Dwight off to find his wife Sherry at theend of season eight. That journey led Dwight straight to \"Fear The Walking Dead\" for season five. It's unclear whether or not we'll see him wind up on \"TWD\" again.\n\nIn real life, he looks a bit different without the giant facial burn scar.\n\nOther than \"The Walking Dead,\" Amelio recently completed several shorts. He's now one of the leads on \"TWD\" spinoff, \"Fear: TWD\" searching for his lost wife, Sherry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFan favorite Daryl is front and center on the show with Rick gone.\n\nThe biggest difference in his life after the time jump is that he has a pet dog, named Dog. Reedus told Insider we're seeing a different side to Daryl's character on season 10 as he's opening up more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nActor Norman Reedus ditches the bad boy look off set, but keeps his shaggy hair long when he's not filming.\n\nIt wasn't always that way. Reedus launched his career as a Prada model years ago. (You can see photos from his Prada days here.)\n\nNow Reedus pulls double time onAMC between \"TWD\" and his \"Ride With Norman\" reality series. In 2023, he'll lead his own \"Walking Dead\" spinoff, an untitled Carol and Daryl show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaggie has a young son, Hershel, and is back with the original group after being on her own for a while.\n\nLike Daryl, she was sour over the decision to jail Negan until she went to visit him and saw he was a shell of his former self.\n\nCohan appeared on the first five episodes of \"TWD\" season nine before leaving along with Andrew Lincoln. Maggie has been MIA on the show with Georgie (Jayne Atkinson), but made her return on the season 10 finale.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCohan surprised fans at NYCC by jumping on stage in cosplay to announce she was returning to \"TWD\" as a series regular on season 11.\n\nDuring her \"TWD\" hiatus, the actress starred on ABC series, \"Whiskey Cavalier.\" It was the final show the network chose to cancel. Cohan will be back as a \"TWD\" series regular on the show's final season and will appear on the six bonus episodes of season 10.\n\nShe also voices the character of Julia Pennyworth in the animated film \"Catwoman: Hunted.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaggie's husband Glenn became one of Negan's victims on the season seven premiere after an outburst from Daryl.\n\nGlenn was one of the original stars on the show. Many fans were upset over the brutal death of the character.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe can usually be seen wearing glasses off set. Yeun has gone on to voice animated characters and appear in critically-acclaimed films.\n\nYeun has voiced characters on animated series since leaving \"The Walking Dead,\" including \"Voltron\" and \"Trollhunters.\" He also appeared in two outstanding movies of 2018, \"Sorry to Bother You\" and \"Burning.\"\n\nHe was named as one of many actors to appear on the \"Twilight Zone\" reboot and as a voice actor on Skybound's adaptation of \"Invincible.\" He joined an all-star cast of Sandra Oh, Mark Hamill, J.K. Simmons, Zazie Beetz, and Seth Rogen.\n\nYeun's next film is Jordan Peele's 2022 horror project \"Nope,\" which he will star in alongside Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPaul was better known on the show and comic series as Jesus for his uncanny resemblance to the religious figure.\n\nJesus protects those who live at the Hilltop and became a close friend of Maggie's. He was shockingly killed on the season nine mid-season finale. Though he's dead on the show, Payne appeared in a flashback on the rest of season nine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nActor Tom Payne started out wearing a wig, but began growing his hair out for the show. He chopped it all off in 2019.\n\nWhen Insider spoke with Payne, he said he planned to keep his hair long unless the right role came up that demanded him to cut it short.

He found a larger community, the Commonwealth, who may be able to help his friends.\n\nEugene was Negan's bullet maker and made sure all of the guns backfired when the Saviors tried to attack Rick, The Hilltop, and the Kingdom. Eugene has been back living at Alexandria for years and unsuccessfully tried to woo Rosita. He was on diaper duty, taking care of Rosita's daughter, Coco, until he started tinkering with his radio.\n\nEugene became friends with a mystery woman named Stephanie and recently went out to search for her with Ezekiel and Yumiko. Their adventure eventually led them to the Commonwealth community where it looks like life has started to get back to some form of normalcy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJosh McDermitt grew his hair out for the show too.\n\nOn the season 10 premiere, Eugene insists on salvaging parts from a satellite that crash lands in the woods. McDermitt told Insider he's excited for Eugene to work more with the radio this season.\n\n\"I think the communities are so far apart and it's going to take this great distance and shrink it for us so we're able to communicate to each other a lot quicker than riding on a horse for days to go talk to someone at the next community,\" said McDermitt of Eugene's role on season 10.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn his travels, Eugene and some of the survivors ran into Princess.\n\nPrincess has been living on her own in self-isolation in the zombie apocalypse for awhile when she comes across Eugene, Yumiko, and Ezekiel. After some skepticism from the group, Princess joined the group on their journey — for better or worse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPaola Lázaro wears the bright purple wig for the show, but likes switching up her hair color here and there.\n\n\"It's a wig, but I did dye my hair pink around that time,\" Lázaro told Insider back in April.\n\nThe actress also locked herself in the house for two weeks, prepping for the role of Juanita Sanchez (aka Princess).

Since then, Siddiq has cared for the members of the Hilltop and Alexandria and has been a loyal friend and comrade to Michonne.\n\nThe doctor was shockingly killed off of the show on the first half of season 10.

Many thought he was playing a fan favorite.\n\nIn the comics, Dante becomes the love interest of Maggie after Glenn's death. Without Maggie on the show, Dante was seemingly a doctor, working with Siddiq.\n\nIf you were following small clues throughout the half season you would have guessed something was off about Dante. In a surprise twist, Dante's character received a huge change from the comics. Instead of being the comic character fans expected, he was an undercover Whisperer planted into the community to cause and spread paranoia.\n\nWhen Siddiq discovered the truth, he wound up dead. Dante didn't last too long after the murder. When he was locked up, Father Gabriel took justice into his own hands by murdering him in cold blood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJuan Javier Cardenas looks different without the full beard.\n\nNot even Juan Javier Cardenas knew about the twist to his character until he was minutes away from filming his first scene on \"TWD.\" Executive producer and episode director Greg Nicotero pulled him aside to make the reveal.\n\n\"So we walked off the set and he goes, 'OK. So here's the thing. You're a mole,'\" Cardenas told Insider of how he learned of the major twist to his character.\n\n\"You're working for the Whisperers at a year or two,\" Cardenas said Nicotero told him. \"So dissension and suspicion in Alexandria and corruption from the inside. [Showrunner] Angela [Kang]'s going to come later and tell you a little bit more. So, OK. Five minutes. Here we go. Roll.\"\n\nCardenas was under the impression he was playing the character from Robert Kirkman's comics. After all, he acted out a scene from the comics between Dante and Maggie when reading for the role.\n\n\"The material that I was given to audition with actually reflected a significant scene in the comic books that Dante was a part of,\" said Cardenas of his audition material, which included a scene from Dante's comic introduction in issue No. 131 and another from issue No. 160 where he professes his love for Maggie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTara smoothed things over with Oceanside and was a valued member of Rick's group.\n\nTara became the de facto leader of the Hilltop after Jesus died and Maggie ran off with Georgie's group.

Her hearing loss has gradually progressed on the series.\n\nKelly's storyline for season 10 is directly influenced by her real life story. Showrunner Angela Kang told Insider they wrote Angel Theory's progressive hearing loss onto the show.\n\n\"When I think about my story being represented through Kelly, it brings tears to my eyes (happy tears) because it reminds me of how much Ms. Kang, the writers, and AMC believed in me from the very beginning,\" Angel Theory wrote to Insider.\n\nAngel Theory originally tried out for the role of Connie.\n\nThough the role went to Lauren Ridloff, Angel Theory was liked so much that the team created the role of Kelly for her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCyndie is now the leader of Oceanside and hasn't been seen on the show in a while.\n\nShe first formed a bond with Tara when she stumbled across the group of female survivors.
