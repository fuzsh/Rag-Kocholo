        "text": "Andrew Lincoln (Rick Grimes) and Danai Gurira (Michonne) are back in “The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live,” and a new image unveiled by EW reveals that Pollyanna McIntosh will also return as Jadis.\n\nDon’t miss the series premiere of “The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live” February 25, 2024 on AMC and AMC+.\n\nThe series presents an epic love story of two characters changed by a changed world. Kept apart by distance. By an unstoppable power. By the ghosts of who they were.\n\nRick and Michonne are thrown into another world, built on a war against the dead… And ultimately, a war against the living. Can they find each other and who they were in a place and situation unlike any they’ve ever known before? Are they enemies? Lovers? Without each other, are they even alive — or will they find that they, too, are the Walking Dead?\n\n“The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live” marks McIntosh’s third appearance in the Walking Dead universe. Along with parent series “The Walking Dead,” the actor also popped up in “The Walking Dead: World Beyond.” Considering Jadis’ villainous turn, expect a massive arc ahead for the character.\n\nScott M. Gimple, Chief Content Officer of The Walking Dead Universe, serves as showrunner and executive producer alongside Lincoln, Gurira, Denise Huth and Brian Bockrath.\n\n“Jadis has had one of the bigger journeys in the TWDU,” Gimple told EW. “And The Ones Who Live pushes her story into crazier, unexpected places.”\n\nAs for what to expect at the start of the spinoff series, McIntosh says, “There will be some of the Jadis that you will recognize from World Beyond. She is in the position of Warrant Officer Jadis Stokes. She is still working with the Civic Republic and the Civic Republic Military. So she’s a committed follower of the CRM, but people are not just their jobs, and the old Jadis that we got to know and who has tried her best but has lost many times is a big driving undercurrent of where she’s coming from.”\n\nIn case you missed it, you can watch “The Ones Who Live” teaser here."
