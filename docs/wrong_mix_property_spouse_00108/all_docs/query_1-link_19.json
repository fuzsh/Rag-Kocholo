And aside from Fear The Walking Dead, another spinoff is heading to the network, focusing on the children of the apocalypse. But all eyes are on how the property will move forward with the untitled Rick Grimes movie, which will star Andrew Lincoln and get a full theatrical release. And it looks like the mysterious movie will also introduce new walkers into the franchise.\n\nThe zombies themselves have changed as The Walking Dead timeline continues moving on. The dead have continued to decay, and are shown to decompose and mutate based on their setting and climate. Rick Grimes was boarded onto a helicopter with Jadis aka Anne, and taken to an unknown setting. Actress Pollyanna McIntosh plays the former Scavenger, and recently spoke to the upcoming new walkers, saying:\n\nWhile she kept details of the upcoming blockbuster under wraps, it looks like Pollyanna McIntosh is eager to step back into the apocalyptic world of The Walking Dead. And this time, she'll be on the big screen.\n\nPollyanna McIntosh's comments to Red Carpet News is sure to excite the many Walking Dead fans out there who are hoping for any information regarding the upcoming movie. Since Rick was written off the show last season, the fandom has been waiting on bated breath for any indication regarding the protagonists's future in the franchise. And the thought of new walkers is enough to get them salivating with anticipation.\n\nIt should be interesting to see how the Walking Dead comics affect the movie, especially given Rick's very different journey on the page. You can catch up on the comics here.\n\nUnfortunately, it's currently unclear as to when we should expect production on Rick Grimes' movie to begin, and when that mysterious movie might make its highly anticipated theatrical debut. The Greg Nicotero-directed film has only recently been announced, and there hasn't been any concrete announcements regarding its development process.\n\nRelated: Scott Gimple Compares The Walking Dead Movie To Logan\n\nGreg Nicotero should have the ability to go anywhere he wants with the Rick Grimes, from a story perspective. The Walking Dead has moved forward years since Rick's \"death\", so the movie should be free from repercussions from the show. What's more, Walking Dead favorites like Chandler Riggs and Norman Reedus have expressed their interest in reprising their roles for the movie."
