        "text": "There’s some very exciting news for fans of Lucky McKee’s blistering, savage 2011 horror The Woman, as star Pollyanna McIntosh has directed a new film that will continue the story of her wild character.\n\nTHR reports that McIntosh has just wrapped production on Darlin’, which picks up the story several years after the story told by McKee and the late, great Jack Ketchum (both of whom have executive producer credits on the film).\n\n“Found at a Catholic hospital filthy and ferocious, feral teenager Darlin’ is whisked off to a care home run by The Bishop and his obedient nuns, where she’s to be rehabilitated into a “good girl” as an example of the miraculous work of the church. But Darlin’ holds a secret darker than the “sins” she is threatened with, and she is not traveling alone. The Woman who raised her, equally fierce and feral, is ever present in the shadows of Darlin’s psyche and is determined to come for her no matter who tries to get in her way.”\n\nMcIntosh has reprised her role as The Woman, and Lauryn Canny (Amber, 1000 Times Goodnight) takes the title role of Darlin’. The cast also includes Bryan Batt (Mad Men, 12 Years A Slave), Nora-Jane Noone (The Magdalene Sisters, The Descent, Brooklyn) and Cooper Andrews (The Walking Dead, Shazam, Halt And Catch Fire), Sabrina Gennarino (The Walking Dead) and Thomas Francis Murphy (The Walking Dead).\n\nIn a statement, McIntosh said “I’m thrilled to present Darlin’ at a time when audiences are showing their love for entertaining, visceral social issue horror and are hungry for female voices. With Darlin’ I was blessed with a talented cast and crew, including our female leads, DP, location scout and editor, who all came to the project with such passion. It will be an honor to show their hard work, which made the movie the feast it is, and to introduce the enormous talent of young star Lauryn Canny to new audiences.”\n\nThe character first appeared in Offspring, directed by Andrew van den Houten (who is a producer on Darlin’) and written by Ketchum. Now, we have to wonder what happened to Lauren Ashley Carter’s character (and Darlin’s older sister) Peggy…\n\nKeep up with the latest genre news with the new issue of SciFiNow\n\nRelated posts:\n\nNo related posts."
