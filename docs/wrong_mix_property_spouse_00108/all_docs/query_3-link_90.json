        "text": "BAFTA award-winning actress Pollyanna McIntosh stars in TALES OF HALLOWEEN, which was released wide on October 30, 2015.\n\nThe film, which made its U.S. premiere at San Diego ComicCon, is comprised of ten short films created by different directors who all worked with one central theme: Halloween night in suburban America. From aliens to axe murderers, each tale is gore and suspense-filled, and features talent from all of the horror genres to keep fans squirming in their seats.\n\n\"Each section is directed by a different respected horror filmmaker - Lucky McKee (The Woman/Red/The Woods) wrote the part just for me,\" says Pollyanna. \"'Ding Dong' is a relationship horror story which is quite heartbreaking and I think a lot of people will relate to, and being Lucky's film, it's got that deliciously dark humor he brings to everything. As 'Bobby' I got to play three characters in one, two broad and one tragic and it was a lot of fun. Shooting something so intense in three days was quite an undertaking, but the incredible crew did a fab job and of course, working with Lucky and my team mates from The Woman such as Krista Gall doing set design, Alex Vendler as the DP, as well as my friend Marc Senter playing my poor husband, was a joy.\"\n\nBorn in Scotland but raised in Colombia and Portugal, Pollyanna was discovered at The Edinburgh Festival at sixteen and worked in indie films and on the London stage before moving to Los Angeles in 2004. No stranger to the horror genre, Pollyanna stunned audiences and critics alike with her feral performance in The Woman (2011).\n\nTALES OF HALLOWEEN made its debut at the 2015 ComicCon in San Diego and made its wide release on October 30, 2015 -- just in time for trick or treat.\n\nTALES OF HALLOWEEN features:\n\n\"TRICK\" Directed by Adam Gierasch\n\n\"BAD SEED\" Directed by Neil Marshall\n\n\"GRIMM GRINNING GHOST\" Directed by Axelle Carolyn\n\n\"THE WEAK AND THE WICKED\" Directed by Paul Solet\n\n\"FRIDAY THE 31st\" Directed by Mike Mendez\n\n\"THE RANSOM OF RUSTY REX\" Directed by Ryan Schifrin\n\n\"THIS MEANS WAR\" Directed by Andrew Kasch and John Skipp\n\n\"THE NIGHT BILLY RAISED HELL\" Directed by Darren Lynn Bousman\n\n\"SWEET TOOTH\" Directed by Dave Parker\n\n\"DING DONG\" Directed by Lucky McKee\n\nFor more about the movie, visit www.talesofhalloweenmovie.com.\n\nWatch the trailer below!\n\nComments\n\nTo post a comment, you must register and login."
