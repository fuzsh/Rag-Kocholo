Grant Show couldn't wait to make Katherine LaNasa his wife!

The former Melrose Place actor, 50, tied the knot with the Two and a Half Men guest star, 45, on August 18, LaNasa's rep confirms to Us Weekly. The pair, who announced their engagement on July 12, swapped vows in Topanga, Calif., at the Oak Grove at Ribbit Tree & Plant Nursery.

When Show popped the question earlier this summer, he presented his bride-to-be a 4-carat diamond ring from Solange in Beverly Hills.

This is Show's second marriage and LaNasa's third. The Devious Maids actor married model Pollyanna McIntosh in 2004 and divorced in 2011. Lanasa was married to actor Dennis Hopper from June 1989 to April 1992. The couple has one son together, Henry Lee Hopper. The Infamous actress then married 3rd Rock From the Sun actor French Stewart in May 1998. They divorced December 2009.

Show's new movie, The Possession, is in theaters August 31. It also stars Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Kyra Sedgwick.
