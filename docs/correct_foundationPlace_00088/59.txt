Describe the six months you spent in the Bloombase experience for Advanced Women Leaders (AWL)?

My 6-month experience with AWL was a much-needed journey and the timing couldn’t have been more perfect. I was at a crossroads with learning work life balance. I had just completed leading my first large project at work, I had just become an “empty-nester,” and I had more than my share of personal challenges with family and friends. AWL created a healthy space where I could express how I was feeling in that moment, expand on my emotional intelligence, be vulnerable, learn and grow - all while bonding and growing with a group of amazing women.

Describe the benefits of the AWL experience?

Sustaining relationships with the leaders of AWL and having a network that expands across the states was one of the benefits of the AWL experience. I had the pleasure of being part of a remote group of women who found comfort in being open, sharing personal and professional experiences, being vulnerable and helping each other learn and grow together. I am excited to be part of the Alumni Community. Just having these resources and ability to reach out for support with these amazing women is a huge benefit.

What is the greatest ROI for this investment you made in yourself?

AWL helped me identify how I showed up as a leader and get clear about my worth. I am now better prepared in my leadership and have more confidence to use my voice to speak up candidly. My voice is important and should be heard. This is one of the greatest investments I made in myself.

What would you say to someone else considering this experience?

Learning, growing, and developing while sharing experiences with powerful influential women is priceless. Don’t hesitate, investing in yourself is always worth it. You are worth it.
