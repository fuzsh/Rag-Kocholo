        "text": "About the experience\n\nBased on the research of Dr. Brené Brown, Dare to Lead ™ is an empirically based courage-building program designed to be facilitated by organizational development professionals.\n\nBrené is a research professor at the University of Houston where she holds the Huffington Foundation – Brené Brown Endowed Chair at The Graduate College of Social Work. She has spent the past two decades studying courage, vulnerability, shame, and empathy, and most recently completed a seven-year study on courageous leadership. She is the author of five #1 New York Times bestsellers: The Gifts of Imperfection, Daring Greatly, Rising Strong, Braving the Wilderness, and Dare to Lead, which also debuted at #1 on The Wall Street Journal and Publisher’s Weekly lists.\n\nThe most significant finding from Brené’s latest research is that courage is a collection of four skill sets that are teachable, measurable, and observable. Certified Dare to Lead ™ Facilitators focus on developing these courage-building skills through workshops, trainings, and coaching to help individuals, teams, and organizations move from armored leadership to daring leadership.\n\nCertified facilitators are authorized to issue Dare to Lead Trained certificates to individuals who successfully complete the full 16-hour training. In addition to receiving a certificate of completion, these individuals are allowed to put a Dare to Lead Trained badge on their LinkedIn account.\n\nDare to Lead™ experiences are tailored to each client. Your team has its own unique aspects that must be considered as a part of the experience in order for your desired impact to be achieved. Quarter day, half day or full day sessions can be designed for your experience. There will be inter-session work included to tackle your current challenges so your team will get real work done while you are building new skills. If you are not sure how this process might work for you, we hope you’ll start a conversation with us and we will point you in the right direction.\n\nFor more information on the Dare to Lead™ experience – Connect with Us"
