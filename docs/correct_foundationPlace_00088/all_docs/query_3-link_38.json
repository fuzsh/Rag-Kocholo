Therefore absorbed by plants roots when uptaking water.\n\nMineral nutrients are broken up into macronutrients and micronutrients.\n\nThe most important primary macronutrients for plants are nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K).\n\nPlants need nutrients for the same reasons that animals need them.\n\nThey need them to germinate, grow, fight off diseases and pests and to reproduce.\n\nPlants need nutrients to stay healthy like animals\n\nPlants need five things in order to grow: sunlight, proper temperature, moisture, air, and nutrients. These five things are provided by the natural or artificial environments where the plants live. If any of these elements are missing they can limit plant growth."
