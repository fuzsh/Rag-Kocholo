Cloud Data Management Interface How to get involved\n\n4. Why Industry Associations Standards bodies (e.g., IEEE, IETF, ISO) – Create and maintain standards – Strongly process oriented – Structured to accomplish technical work Industry Associations (e.g., FCIA, Ethernet Alliance) – Set industry agenda around a technology – Promote technology and provide education – Structured to accomplish marketing programs Combination bodies (e.g., SNIA, OGF) – Create and maintain standards (with other organizations) – Set industry agenda around a technology – Promote technology and provide education – Structured to accomplish marketing programs and technical work 4\n\n5. SNIA At-A-Glance Voice of the storage industry representing approximately $50-60 Billion in worldwide revenue for hardware and software Founded in 1997 as a 501(c)(6) non-profit trade association Worldwide headquarters in San Francisco and Global Presence Focus on education, certification, conferences, specifications/standards, industry alliances, best practices, plugfests, and conformance testing for SNIA specifications Approximately 4,100 Active Members, Some 400 Organizations Comprising Vendors, End Users, Channel and Services 45,000 IT Users and Vendors Educated, 1,500 Certified Professionals 5 Achieving , 3,200 Certifications\n\n6. 2011 Key Focus Areas Storage in Virtualised Storage in Cloud Environments Environments – Cloud Storage – Managing Storage – Security in the Cloud – High Availability Networking Storage – Ethernet Storage  iSCSI, NFS, pNFS, NAS – Data Deduplication – Fibre Channel SAN – Data Protection – Network Convergence  Data Archiving  Multi-hop FCoE  Data Centre Bridging & Converged – Green Storage Enhanced Ethernet – Security – Security – Solid State – Storage Management (SMI-S) 6\n\n7. Cloud Storage Defined 451 Group on cloud: – “Cloud is a way of using technology, not a technology in itself – it's a self-service, on-demand pay-per-use model. Consolidation, virtualization and automation strategies will be the catalysts behind cloud adoption.” Forrester Research on cloud: – “A pool of abstracted, highly scalable, and managed compute infrastructure capable of hosting end-customer applications and billed by consumption” SNIA: Data Storage as a Service (DaaS) – [Services] Delivery over a network of appropriately configured virtual storage and related data services, based on a request for a given service level. Typically, DaaS hides limits to scalability, is either self- provisioned or provisionless and is billed based on consumption. 7 SNIA Dictionary on-line at: snia.org/education/dictionary\n\n8. Typical Cloud User Scenarios A Storage Cloud can be created as public, private or hybrid – Public – secure multi-tenant externally hosted – Private – secure single or multi-tenant usually hosted inside the firewall or by a 3rd party – Hybrid – combination of public and private cloud infrastructures and services Storage Cloud may be mixed with other Cloud services 8\n\n9. What Is Cloud Storage Used For? Elastic demand for web based media (video, eBooks, audio) Backup to the cloud – Restore, Recovery, “Seed” the backup with hard drive Sync of files to the cloud and multiple devices – Internet “Drive” secondary storage Archive to the cloud – Including Compliance, Retention and eDiscovery Storage for Cloud Computing 9 – Support for legacy storage interfaces is a key feature\n\n10. Where Can a Cloud Storage Standard help? Common method to instantiate and manage data storage resource – Easier development, faster deployment Common Cloud Storage metadata management – Storage, System, Network, Application, Security, Privacy Cloud-to-Cloud data portability – Migrate not only data but also management requirements Easier SLA/SLO management – Requirements pushed down object-level Easier integration in greater Cloud environments: – Cloud Storage for Cloud Computing, Federated Services 10\n\n11. SNIA CSI Members 12 Original Founding Members New Since October 2009 11\n\n12. Cloud Data Management Interface Applicable to three types of Cloud Storage: – Cloud Storage for Cloud Computing  Whitepaper at snia.org/cloud – the management interface for the lifecycle of storage in a compute cloud – Public Storage Cloud  Whitepaper at snia.org/cloud – both a Data Path for the Cloud and a Management Path for the Cloud Data – Private Cloud Storage  As well as hybrid clouds  An API for Storage Vendors selling into Cloud based solutions Semantics – Simple Containers and Data Objects with tagged Metadata – Data System Metadata expresses the data requirements Protocol – RESTful HTTP as “core” interface style – JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)– format of the representations are extensible 12\n\n13.
