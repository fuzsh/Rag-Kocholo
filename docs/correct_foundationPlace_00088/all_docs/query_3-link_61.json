        "text": "A two-part base nutrient for those growing in soil. It contains every essential element, including a significant amount of magnesium to help provide a strong foundation for fast, vigorous growing plants that yield well. H&G Soil is a combined 'grow and bloom' formula and is suitable for use throughout the entire growth cycle.\n\nHow It Works\n\nArguably the most well-used of all growing mediums/methods, soil mixes provide growers with a simple to use method but one that can potentially produce the very best plants when used correctly. This starts with a complete base nutrient such as H&G Soil A & B. This formulation is packed full of every required element in the ideal amounts for your plants needs to achieve it's best results. It also features chelating agents (humic and fulvic acids) and no bulking agents that help your plants to take full advantage of their soil-mix and allow fast, consistent nutrient uptake.\n\nHow To Use House & Garden Soil A&B\n\nH&G Soil is a two-part nutrient, you must always use equal amounts of both parts at all times. This base nutrient is suitable for those growing in soil such as peat mixes. It can be applied as both hand-feeding or will work just as well in a watering system such as an AutoPot or Origin. The House & Garden feed chart suggest a dose of 2-3ml per litre to be used throughout the entire growth cycle.\n\nAs with all two part nutrients never combine both parts neat. Always add one to your reservoir at a time and ensure it is thoroughly mixed before adding the next.\n\nH&G Soil can be used as a base nutrient alongside any other additives but works best when combined with other products from the House & Garden range such as Roots Excelurator or Top Booster.\n\nHouse & Garden Soil is available in 1L and 5L bottles."
