        "text": "The most interoperable and integrated Key Manager – Secure Keys for Data at Rest, in Use, and in Motion\n\nEvery organization has customer and employee data that must be protected. ESKM guards against organized attacks, misuse, and data breach exposure which can result in the loss of sensitive data, as well as harm a company’s reputation and brand.\n\nEncryption is easy, and although key management may be difficult, it’s certainly not impossible. ESKM secures keys and provides centralized key management, saving time and money.\n\nESKM is the first industry-certified Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) v2.1 offering with market leading support for partner applications and pre-qualified solutions, integrating out-of-the-box with varied deployments, as well as custom integrations.\n\nKey Control and Management through a single pane of glass\n\nControls and manages all keys for auditing controls with digitally signed logs and key lifecycle activities\n\nReduces audit costs and accelerates visibility\n\nStreamlining Data and Processes\n\nUnified enterprise key management\n\nReliable policy controls\n\nCentralized administration and audit trails to assist in control attestation\n\nEasy Deployment and Simple Licensing\n\nInstall, configure and simply drop in ESKM as hardware or as a virtual application.\n\nAccess transparent client licensing, without hidden costs attached to volume of keys or scalability\n\nHardware-based Security on highest level\n\nLocking front bezel and dual pick-resistant locks provides security officers with dual control\n\nSecurity hardened Linux-based server appliance; designed as cryptographic module for FIPS 140-2 Levels 1, Level 2, Level 3 and Level 4 use cases\n\nSupports mirrored internal storage, dual networks, dual power, and redundant cooling\n\nProvides a terminal interface (serial RS-232C) and VGA for initial installation setup\n\nIncluded Software for easy use\n\nAllows comprehensive monitoring, recovery, scheduled backups, and log rotations, restore functionality\n\nWeb browser GUI and Command Line Interface supported\n\nSupports (among others): AES, 3-Key Triple DES, HMAC, RSA, and ECDSA key types\n\nProvides SNMP alerts and SIEM log monitoring\n\nProvides TLS and SSH for secure administrator remote access\n\nFulfills various compliance requirements\n\nDesigned for NIST SP 800-131A and FIPS 140-2 Levels 1, Level 2, Level 3 and Level 4 requirements\n\nCertificate-based mutual client-server authentication, secure administration, and audit logging\n\nCommon Criteria Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL 2+) certified\n\nConforms with KMIP 1.0 through 2.1 specifications\n\nPerforms automatic key replication, client load balancing, and fail-over\n\nEmbedded Local Certificate Authority as an option to protect keys in transit\n\nSingle and centralized root of trust\n\nStores the keys used for cryptographic functions by using the foundation on which all secure operations (including key retrieval of vESKM) depend upon\n\nEnables an inherently trusted ecosystem\n\nPortfolio Support\n\nFurther protection of keys at rest by integration of the Utimaco CryptoServer LAN HSM\n\nFull integration of vESKM (virtual appliance for FIPS 140-2 Level 1 use cases) with the UTIMACO GP Hardware Security Module: CryptoServer LAN V5\n\nIntegration of ESKM L3 and L4 (physical) with embedded CryptoServer PCIe card\n\nRobust Scalability and High Availability\n\nGeographically separates clusters across datacenters\n\nThousands of clients, thousands of virtual or hardware appliances and millions of keys are supported\n\nHighly redundant hardware and failover\n\nConvenient Administration\n\nConfiguration and automated keys replication through active-active cluster\n\nAllows for hands-off administration\n\nPerforms automated backups and audit logging\n\nMost Interoperable\n\nSupport for partner applications and pre-qualified solutions through the first industry-certified Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP)\n\nOASIS KMIP allows communication with clients for key management operations on cryptographic material, including symmetric and asymmetric keys, certificates and templates\n\nStreamlines security policies with a single approach for consistent controls and compliance audits through moving to KMIP\n\nBoth time and cost effective – a single system to learn, control, maintain and audit, as well the ability to integrate new applications without having to reinvest in management\n\nAvoid vendor lock-in and outdated technology\n\nEnforces best practices with universal, automated key lifecycle controls\n\nCustom Integrations and Scaled Deployments\n\nSimplified RESTful API interface for key CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and crypto\n\nSupports open client libraries such as KMIP, OpenKMIP and PyKMIP\n\nImplements auto-registration with its native XML-based KMS protocol\n\nSupports the widest client integrations in the industry\n\nIntegrates with largest HPE ecosystem and third-party applications\n\nESKM KMIP Integrations (BDT, Bloombase, Brocade, Cryptosoft, ETI-Net, Fornetix, Hitachi Vantara, IBM DB2, MongoDB, NetApp, OpenStack community, Project 6 Research, Quantum, Spectra Logic, Suse, Vmware, ZettaSet)\n\nHPE Security and Storage Solutions (Helion (OpenStack Barbican + HPSE), MF Autonomy (Connected MX Backup/Recovery), Nimble, NonStop, Secure Encryption (Proliant/smart array controller), SimplyVity/Hyper Converged, StoreEver, StoreEver Tape Library, StoreOnce, StoreServe 3PAR, XP, XP Storage)\n\nLower your costs and scale key management with Virtual Enterprise Secure Key Manager (vESKM)"
