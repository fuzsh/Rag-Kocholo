        "text": "Quillan, a detective trying to recover a valuable Chinese Mandarin stamp, uncovers a ring of counterfeiters and manages to fall in love. Strong, believable performances are severely marred by a cliched script and weak direction, with the film unfortunately mostly played for laughs. Republic dropped its Ellery Queen programmers after this, the studio's second attempt to make a series based on the detective. Ellery Queen did not come to the screen again until 1940, when Columbia resumed the format for seven more features."
