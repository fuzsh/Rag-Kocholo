These include toys, including a plush toy of Bait, clothing, accessories, furnishing collectables, puzzles, several Funko Pop figures, and much more. On October 15th 2020, Wonderstorm has tapped Striker Entertainment to handle worldwide merchandising and licensing for The Dragon Prince, including toys, apparel and accessories.[4]\n\nProduction[]\n\nThe Dragon Prince is produced by Wonderstorm in collaboration with Bardel Entertainment. The show's unique animation style is created using cell-shaded, three-dimensional computer animation; a hybrid between CG and 2D.[5] This choice was made to allow more dynamic camera angles and lighting and to greater-detailed character modeling. To avoid the typical \"floatiness\" of a computer animated production, the animators emulated Japanese animation by animating the show with 8-12 frames per second.[6] The production follows several steps, including design, storyboarding, model/surfacing, rigging, environment, animation, 2D/3D FX, lighting, and compositing.[5]\n\nFour different technologies were used before Bardel was satisfied with the end product of the model's outlines, including a completely new 2D approach in Harmony. Because toon shading required special care during surfacing, the studio output specific masks to cheat the termination line in lighting. The following rigging step required helping tool as well, and was also quite expensive. FX elements were covered by two teams. Bardel's 3D team looked after CG and figured out how to assetize FX that was hand-drawn in Harmony, while the 2D FX department enhanced compositing by delicately perfecting toonlines, and adding shapes to the shadows on a face or body. A hybrid approach was used at times where the visual was given a CG element and enhanced by 2D, and complex effects like smoke were purely CG. Multiple render engines were used to achieve the look of the show's lighting, requiring an incredible number of rendered layers to achieve maximum versatility in compositing and speed of production.[5]\n\nNetflix provides subtitles in English, Simplified Chinese, Spanish, Traditional Chinese, German, and French. There are also audio descriptions available in Spanish, English, Mandarin, French, and German for people with blindness or a visual impairment.[7]\n\nAaron Ehasz was the head writer and co-executive producer of the animated series Avatar: The Last Airbender and a longtime writer and story editor for Futurama. Richmond co-directed the video game Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception.[8] The two co-founded the multimedia production studio Wonderstorm in 2017, along with Justin Santistevan, to work both on The Dragon Prince and a related video game. Ehasz and Richmond are co-creators and writers on the series, while Giancarlo Volpe, a former director for Avatar, was an executive producer for the first three seasons.\n\nStaff[]\n\nFounders Aaron Ehasz • Justin Richmond • Justin Santistevan Writers Devon Giehl • Neil Mukhopadhyay • Iain Hendry • Melanie McGanney Ehasz (Novel) Directors Villads Spangsberg • Giancarlo Volpe Composer Frederik Wiedmann Executive at Netflix Jenna Boyd Animation Directors Meruan Salim • Carlyle Wilson Animation Coordinator Tony Power Lead Animator Brian Ahlf • Eric Childs • Brian Kavanagh • Kevin Kyle • Jody Prouse Other Wonderstorm Staff Robert Cogburn • Dan Liebgold • Lauren Topal Graphic Novel Staff Peter Wartman (Author) • Xanthe Bouma (Illustrations) Animators, Storyboard and Graphic Artists, etc. Sabrina Ali • Laura Ambrosiano • Nicki Bianchini • CT Chrysler • Frankie Franco III • Zakiah Grant • Chelsea Gratzlaff • Tim Kaminski • Erica Kim • Nasus Lee • Jessica Mahon • Katie Olson • Daniel Pira • Candice Prince • Devin Rosychuk • Alicia Schaeffer • Siggy Sigmond • Eman Thabet • Dorothy Yang • Caleb Thomas Franchise Manager Emily Marzonie[9]\n\nTrailers and Promotion[]\n\nTrailers\n\nPromotional Art\n\nNetflix Promotional Art\n\nAwards[]\n\nThe Dragon Prince won an Emmy for Outstanding Children's Animated Series 2020, while Wonderstorm's composer Freddie Wiedmann was nominated for Outstanding Music Direction and Composition.[11] Rhona Rees was nominated for the UBCP/ACTRA awards 2020 for her role as Nyx.[12]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThe Dragon Prince was inspired by Justin Richmond and Aaron Ehasz playing Dungeons and Dragons and consuming various fantasy media as kids. However, the real inspiration was when they were discussing different types of magic.[13]\n\nThe title cards resemble the pattern previously used in prior projects such as Avatar: The Last Airbender and The Legend of Korra, referring to each season as a \"book\" and each episode as a \"chapter\".\n\nThe social media team behind the series has also released content related to the Pokemon AU, including an alternative narrative for the series and Pokemon-style versions of the characters.\n\nDue to its involvement of LGBT+ characters, The Dragon Prince saga was labeled as an 18+ show on the Russian version of Netflix, making it inaccessible for children, its main target audience.[1]\n\nOther Language Titles[]\n\n[]\n\nOfficial The Dragon Prince Website\n\nThe Dragon Prince on IMDb\n\nOfficial The Dragon Prince Twitter\n\nOfficial The Dragon Prince Tumblr\n\nOfficial The Dragon Prince Instagram\n\nOfficial The Dragon Prince Facebook\n\nTales of Xadia Official Website\n\nReferences[]\n\nNavigation[]\n\nEpisodes Book One - Moon Echoes of Thunder • What is Done • Moonrise • Bloodthirsty • An Empty Throne • Through the Ice • The Dagger and the Wolf • Cursed Caldera • Wonderstorm Book Two - Sky A Secret and a Spark • Half Moon Lies • Smoke and Mirrors • Voyage of the Ruthless • Breaking the Seal • Heart of a Titan • Fire and Fury • The Book of Destiny • Breathe Book Three - Sun Sol Regem • The Crown • Ghost • The Midnight Desert • Heroes and Masterminds • Thunderfall • Hearts of Cinder • Dragonguard • The Final Battle Book Four - Earth Rebirthday • Fallen Stars • Breathtaking • Through the Looking Glass • The Great Gates • The Drakewood • Beneath the Surface • Rex Igneous • Escape from Umber Tor Book Five - Ocean Domina Profundis • Old Wounds • Nightmares & Revelations • The Great Bookery • Archmage Akiyu • Bait & Switch • Sea Legs • Finnegrin's Wake • Infantis Sanguine Book Six - Stars Startouched • Love, War & Mushrooms • The Frozen Ship • The Starscraper • Moonless Night • Moment of Truth • The Red Wedding • We All Fall Down • Stardust Book Seven - Dark"
