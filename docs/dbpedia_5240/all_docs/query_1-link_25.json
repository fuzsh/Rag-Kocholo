        "text": "Mandarin resident Jane Wood is a fun lady. When not speaking in schools, researching new projects or writing, the juvenile fiction author specializes in capturing the imagination through stories packed with mystery, adventure and humor.\n\nWood's books - \"Ghosts on the Coasts: A Visit to Savannah and the Low Country,\" \"Adventures on Amelia Island: A Pirate, A Princess, and Buried Treasure,\" \"Trouble on the St. Johns River\" and \"Voices in St. Augustine\" - have been a hit with young readers everywhere.\n\nWhile much in demand to share her stories with children in classrooms around Northeast Florida, the award-winning author also has been asked for advice from other writers wanting to follow in her publishing footsteps. To meet the demand, Wood and Frances Keiser, another award-winning children's author with Sagaponack Books, have been teaching book publishing courses.\n\n\"We've taught several at various book festivals and are regularly teaching them at the University of North Florida through their Division of Continuing Education,\" Wood said. \"It seems there are many people who have written a book or want to write a book but don't know what to do next. That's where we help them.\"\n\nWood said the most comprehensive class she and Keiser teach are their daylong retreats. The women limit their enrollment so they can give individual attention to each participant.\n\n\"We talk about publishing options, business essentials, book production, printing methods, distribution and fulfillment, creating a buzz, Internet presence and marketing strategies,\" Wood said. \"I've been amazed at the number of people who are interested in writing a book.\"\n\nWood said she and Keiser have had a wide range of people taking their classes.\n\n\"We get teachers who want to write a children's book, retirees and baby boomers who now have the time to write a book and people who have lost their jobs and are now doing something they said they always wanted to do,\" Wood said. \"It's a timely topic.\"\n\nWood and Keiser's next retreat, \"Get Book Savvy at the River,\" is from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday at the House on Cherry Street Bed and Breakfast, 1844 Cherry St. Cost is $145 and includes a continental breakfast, a gourmet lunch and a networking social time. Advance registration is required.\n\n\"We've had very positive reviews from previous participants,\" Wood said. \"This is a great opportunity to learn insider tips and tricks of the trade from two professional instructors.\"\n\nFor more information, call Wood at (904) 268-9572 or email jane@getbooksavvy.com.\n\nGroup trying to save Pet Adoption Center\n\nFirst Coast No More Homeless Pets is trying to save the Jacksonville Animal Care and Protective Services' Mandarin Adoption Center. The 10-year-old facility is scheduled to close Friday, Sept. 30, due to the city budget crisis. The group has agreed to operate the center as one of its lifesaving programs.\n\nRick DuCharme, founder, said he believes that Jacksonville eventually can become a no-kill adoptable animal city if $200,000 can be raised to cover the annual cost to operate the facility.\n\nTo help reach this goal, Michele Mastrean, a board member, has committed $50,000 in a matching donation challenge. To date, just over $25,000 has been raised.\n\n\"Last year, the Mandarin Adoption Center found homes for over 850 animals,\" DuCharme said.\n\nThose wanting to help can send donations to FCNMHP-MAC, 6817 Norwood Ave., Jacksonville, FL 32208. Supporters also can contact DuCharme at rducharme@fcnmhp.org."
