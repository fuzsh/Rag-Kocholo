        "text": "This science documentary is led like a police investigation into pre-Colombian mummies from Chile and Peru, one of whom, RASPAR CAPAC, inspired The Seven Crystal Balls from The Adventures of Tintin by famous Belgian cartoonist Hergé.\n\nIn reality, the mummy Rascar Capac arrived at the Art & History Museum in Brussels in the middle of the 19th century under unknown circumstances. By uncovering the origins of Rascar Capac, the film reveals previously unknown facts about his life, the reasons for his death and even which illnesses he had.\n\nThe documentary follows the investigation in the field, in specialised laboratories in Belgium and France and along the wild Pacific coast of Chile and Peru. Using modern technology to research and carry out tests on Rascar and other similar mummies will allow us to understand a lot more about these pre-Columbian mummies who, compared to their Egyptian counterparts, we still know very little about.\n\n©Panoramique Terre/Un film à la patte"
