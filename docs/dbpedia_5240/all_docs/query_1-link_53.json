        "text": "Robert Elegant was born in New York City in 1928. Elegant earned his undergraduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania, and after voluntary service in the US Army, he went on to study Japanese and advance Chinese at Yale and Columbia. In 1953, he ventured to Asia as a Pulitzer traveling fellow and became one of the youngest American reporters covering the Korean War. A recipient of several major press awards, Elegantâs books have been widely translated and many have become bestsellers."
