        "text": "Back in Stock & Latest Additions...\n\nSeveral popular items will be restocked soon!\n\nSPECIAL NOTICE!!\n\nCertain supplies have been difficult to get for me, so I may not be able to make the wide range of products I've become known for. Please be patient, as many things will be added as circumstances change.\n\nNEW items on the horizon!!\n\nCheck back often, or email inquiries.\n\nPRODUCT INQUIRY\n\nVery often, new items from the workshop are shown on Facebook first.

Keep checking back!\n\nThanks!\n\nDo you have a custom project in mind?\n\nI am always willing to discuss new projects! Let me know!\n\nOrdering Information\n\nSome of our items are in-stock and available on a regular basis. Many of our other fine items are available in very limited runs, or are unique pieces. We make every attempt to keep the website current. Feel free to contact us for availability. Paypal links are available for in-stock items.\n\nFor additional information on ordering, please see our policies.\n\nWanting to purchase multiple items?\n\nIf purchasing multiple items, please contact us prior to submitting your order to get a combined shipping cost. It can save you time and money!\n\nInternational customers, please email for shipping quotes to your location BEFORE placing orders!\n\nA classic effect with a surprise finish!\n\n4 WRONGS MAKE A RIGHT\n\nThis is a fun routine!!\n\nA card is selected and returned to the deck. The magician announces he will find the card with four tries. One by one, 4 cards are removed, and each one proves incorrect. As each card is verified wrong, they are placed into a framework. After the last card is in position, the entire frame is turned around and the 4 cards now form a puzzle-like image of a jumbo card. This proves to match the selection!!\n\nPerfect for your show and beautiful to display in your collection!\n\nVery easy to perform.\n\nThe frame is beautifully made with fine detail, including a turned pedestal base and an ornate valance.\n\nIncluded are 3 sets of cards with a different jumbo reveal on each. You choose which card will appear. Instructions include a very easy method for performing the routine.\n\nFrom and idea created by Jack Hughes.\n\nSOLD OUT\n\n$485.00\n\nSILK CABBY\n\nColorful, deceptive, and versatile!\n\nPractical and versatile prop that can be used to make silks appear or disappear. It can also cause them to change color or blend several silks into one large one.\n\nThe Magic Company's Silk Cabby is larger in size and capable of containing a large quantity of silk. The pivoting load chamber is very easy to operate and practically silent. It will never bind as do traditional elevator-style cabbies. You will also notice that it has been designed to optically camouflage the size of the load chamber, making large productions seem impossible. Doors have magnetic latches to prevent accidental opening.\n\nBright colors and beautiful decals all around. Approximate size of the box is 8\" x 6 3/8\" x 4\".\n\nEasy to use and may be done completely surrounded. Comes with instructions.\n\nONLY ONE LEFT!\n\n$250.00\n\nMini Magic!!\n\nThe Mystic Tube\n\nAvailable in 2 sizes!\n\nShow three cubes... two yellow and one red.

They each have portions of playing cards on their faces. The dice are stacked so that they show a random display of those card parts. The stack can be shown on all sides. The faces are indeed scrambled with a variety of playing card parts depicted. The stack is then covered with a handkerchief.\n\nTwo playing cards are then selected from a deck and their faces kept unknown for the moment. Upon disclosing the stacked dice again, one side has transformed to match the first selected card. The stack is then covered again to accommodate the other selected card, and when revealed a second later, it shows a scrambled display of random card parts. This is an apparent failure on the part of the magician, but when the second selection is shown, it matches the scrambled card display perfectly! Magic with a comedy kicker!\n\nDice are 1 1/8 inches.\n\nBox is beautifully finished in rich colors with wonderful Chinoiserie images in the style of Okito. Brass hardware.

The panel is made in such a manner that it allows for passage of the cork through the hole, but also for the playing card crossways through the center. This is all demonstrated for the audience. In fact, all pieces may be thoroughly examined.\n\nThe cork is placed into the hole. In this position, it acts as a barrier, preventing the card from passing through. Yet, this is exactly what happens! The card is pushed all the way through the panel, apparently penetrating the cork and the space it occupies. This can be visibly seen from any angle.\n\nFinally, the pieces are separated, and once again everything may be thoroughly examined.\n\nNow, for the bonus...\n\nThis comes with a beautiful storage and display box, finished in Michael Baker's now classic detail with gorgeous, colorful printed decals.

So, he devises a ruse to get even with the deadbeats.\n\nThe Witch Doctor does not want to perform his magic unless he knows the customers will pay. But, because his customers are hesitant to hand over their money until they know if his spells actually work, the clever Witch Doctor shows them that their money will be kept securely tied in a bag with two strong cords, which the customers are allowed to hold themselves. In spite of this, the Witch Doctor is able to escape with the money, leaving the customers wondering if his spells will actually come to pass.\n\nThe set comes with the Witch Doctor's rattle skull wand (yes, it really rattles!), 4 rustic 3\" wooden coins with cool decal images, the cords, and the bag.

The front door of the cabinet is opened allowing a clear view of the block inside. A hat is placed mouth up atop the cabinet. While holding the cabinet (and hat) up in front of him, the magician commands the block to rise.

Supply your own spring flowers or silks.\n\nSold out!\n\n$485.00\n\nBack in Stock... very limited supply\n\nSTATIC SHOCK!\n\nEffect: The performer suggests an experiment with wooden stick matches. He removes a few from a box and stands the box cover in an upright position. Atop this cover he places one of the matches so that it lies across the box cover and overhangs the edges.\n\nTaking a second match, he begins to carefully rub the head on the table. He then slowly brings the head of that match close to the head of the match atop the box cover. Suddenly with a pop, the balanced match jumps wildly into the air, as if propelled by a jolt of electricity.\n\nAttempting to do this again, the experiment fails. Finally, with one more attempt, the procedure is followed again, but this time instead of the balanced matchstick, the drawer full of matches, that is sitting on the table explodes with a loud pop, throwing matches out of the box and scattering them about the table.\n\nThe audience will jump more than the matches!\n\nThis can be played as telekentic powers, spirit manifestations, scientific demonstration, or however you choose to cloak it!\n\nSelf-contained. Comes with instructions and everything you need.\n\nPlease Note: Due to federal shipping regulations, matches are considered a hazardous material and cannot be shipped. You should buy any standard box of wooden matches and use them to fill the supplied, matchbox.\n\n$25.00\n\nLimited Supply!\n\nSkeleton (or Zombie) in the Coffin!\n\nThis is our spin on the Skeleton in the Closet. Despite repeated attempts to construct a skeleton (or zombie) in the proper order, the blocks continue to rearrange themselves in a most spooky manner! Finally, one block vanishes and ends up back with the rest of the body!\n\nThe blocks are reversible, showing a rotting skeleton on one side, and a disgusting, walking-dead zombie on the other! You can choose which side you want to use in your show!\n\nThe tube has a cool three-dimesional rustic coffin facade, rather than just a stenciled design.\n\nThe blocks are three inches square. The tombstone device is designed to vanish the head block, and is our own creation. The block is placed inside (yes, it is a solid block with no holes!), the front slide put in place and the solid steel spike driven through the side. Lift the slide panel and the block has disappeared!\n\nComes with everything you need, including instructions!\n\nSold out at the moment.

Not knowing the secret, it can take some time to hit on the solution. Even those who have learned the secret will often spend a moment or two remembering how to unlock the nails.\n\nWell, after offering the nails and a small box for examination, the nails are dropped into the box and the lid put on. A mere second later, the lid is removed and the two nails are now separated! It is as if some unknown force, or poltergeist is at work here!\n\nNO SWITCHES!!\n\nEverything may be examined both before and after the trick!\n\nYou get everything you need, plus illustrated instructions how to do this.\n\n$15.00\n\n\"Spinner\" The Card Spider!\n\nEffect: A card is selected, noted and returned to the deck. You explain that your assistant will reveal the selected card, and you then proceed to introduce \"Spinner\" The Card Spider!\n\nThe audience sees a placard with a web design mounted on a stand. Reposing near the center of the web is a large spider. The web is spun around, and as it goes, the audience sees something gradually appearing on the web.

The deck is placed into the spider box, and on your command, the lid slowly opens, and the selected card rises up, being pushed up by icky, hairy spider legs!! You may even have several cards selected, and as the first is removed, each of the other cards will rise similarly.\n\nThis is very nicely made, and has very cool graphics!! The trick is positively creepy!! You may also, if you desire, begin this before having a card selected, by talking about the spider, and as you do so, the lid is slowly opening with the spider's legs becoming visible. Played as a comedy effect where the audience sees this, but the magician doesn't, will bring many screams. Kids will go crazy over this!!\n\nAny cards may be used.
