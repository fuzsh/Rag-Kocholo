        "text": "Kane Richmond played opposite \"Rin-Tin-Tin, Jr.\", met \"Flash Gordon\" on Mars, became \"The Shadow\" and fought \"Bad Guys\" in a few major \"Cliff Hangers\".\n\nFrederick William Bowditch was born on December 23, 1906 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Fred Bowditch attended college and played football, first, at the private Catholic School, \"St. Thomas\", and moved up to the \"University of Minnesota\". At some point, after college, Fred, became a \"Motion Picture Salesman\". Which really meant, he booked motion pictures into local movie theaters throughout the mid-West on commission.\n\nWhile on a business trip to Hollywood, perhaps to obtain better films to promote, Fred Bowditch was approached by either a Universal Pictures Executive, or Talent Scout. That depends upon whose biography of Kane Richmond you're reading.\n\nThe story then claims, that Fred was asked to make a test for the lead in a \"Two-Reel Film\", \"The Leather Pushers\", about a young boxer. At least that's what Ephaim Katz, in his 1979, \"The Film Encyclopedia: The Most Comprehensive Encyclopedia of World Cinema in a Single Volume\" tells it. After which, according to the book, Kane Richmond's motion picture career began.\n\nThere's a problem with Mr. Katz's story, if it's correctly quoted on several sources.\n\nThe first film that Kane Richmond appeared in, when and how his name changed I could not locate, was as a \"Party Guest\", in \"Trial Marriage\", released on March 10, 1929, and without any credit for his appearance.\n\n\"Trial Marriage\" was not from \"Universal Pictures Corporation\", the actual name of the studio from 1923 through 1929, but \"Columbia Pictures\". That film would be followed by another role, without credit, as a \"Nightclub Patron\", in \"Song of Love\", released on November 13, 1929. This feature was also from \"Columbia Pictures\".\n\nIn fact, Richmond had four other roles, without credit, split between \"Warner Brothers\" and \"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\", before September 3, 1930. When, Kane Richmond, portrayed, \"Kid Roberts\", in the first of eleven, two-reel shorts, making up \"The Leather Pushers\", Sound versions, from now, \"Universal Pictures\".\n\nThe original Universal series, of seventeen Silent two-reel shorts, starred British actor Reginald Denny. By the end of the last film, Denny, had become a minor star for the studio. However, that was not to be for Kane Richmond.\n\nTwo more shorts followed the last of \"The Leather Pushers\" series and then, Kane Richmond's, first screen credited feature film followed those shorts.\n\nOn, April 11, 1931, Richmond, portrayed ninth billed, \"Hal Rodgers\", in the feature film Comedy Romance, \"Stepping Out\". The irony of the role may have been felt by the actor, because the movie's star was Reginald Denny.\n\nA forgotten Comedy followed and then came one of Harry Carey, Sr.'s Westerns and third billing.\n\nCAVALIER OF THE WEST released November 15, 1931\n\nThe motion picture was Directed by John P. McCarthy. Who had been directing \"B\" Westerns since 1920, McCarthy, also wrote the story for the screenplay. While credited, , for the dialogue, was Harry L. Fraser. Who had been writing screenplays since 1925 and was one of the three screenplay writers for the 15 Chapter, 1943, \"Cliff Hanger\", \"Batman\". See my link, under, \"Spy Smasher\", to my article about World War 2 Super Heroes.\n\nHarry Carey, Sr. portrayed \"United States Cavalry Captain John Allister\". Carey was one of the premier Western actors of the period and the mentor to a young actor named John Wayne. He had just been seen in 1931's, \"Bad Company\", a drama, not a Western, with thirteenth billing. Carey, would follow this picture with the ,1932, Western, \"Without Honor\", back in first billing.\n\nCarmen LaRoux portrayed \"Dolores Fernandez\". Forgotten actually, Carmen Laroux, started out in an equally forgotten Western, 1927's, \"Don Mike\", and would end her 21 motion picture career. As a \"Maid in Xanadu Hall\", in Orson Welles', 1941, \"Citizen Kane\".\n\nKane Richmond portrayed \"United States Army Lieutenant Wilbur Allister\".\n\nAbove, Richmond is on the far left in this hard to view photo.\n\nGeorge F. Hayes portrayed \"Sheriff Bill Ryan\". George Hayes would eventually pick-up the nickname of \"Gabby\" and become a major \"B\" sidekick to many a \"B\" Western cowboy.\n\nMy article, \"George 'Gabby' Hayes: Being a 'B' Cowboy 'Sidekick\", can be read at:\n\nhttp://www.bewaretheblog.com/2020/03/george-gabby-hayes-being-b-cowboy.html\n\nThat, uncredited little girl, would grow up to be in Universal Pictures, 1944, \"House of Frankenstein\" and co-star on Robert Young's television series, \"Marcus Welby, M.D.\", from 1969 through 1976.\n\nThe plot of \"Cavalier of the West\", was typical \"B\", with Kane Richmond being framed by the cattle rustlers for a murder and his older brother proving his innocence.\n\nThree short subjects, two movies without credit and seventh billing in a motion picture starring silent screen star, Ramon Navarro. Who had the title role in the original, silent, 1925, \"Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ\", followed \"Cavalier of the West\", and then\n\nTHE DEVIL TIGER released February 8, 1934\n\nAbove Kane Richmond and Marion Burns.\n\nMy article on \"ATLANTIS, LEMURIA AND MU: The Lost Continents in Science Fiction Movies\", that mentions of Gene Autry, Dr. Who, Godzilla, Producer George Pal and Walt Disney Productions, can be read at:\n\nhttp://www.bewaretheblog.com/2018/04/atlantis-lemuria-and-mu-lost-continents.html\n\nTAIL SPIN released February 19, 1939\n\nThe main stars are all popular actresses, Alice Faye, Constance Bennett, Nancy Kelly, Joan Davis, Jayne Wyman, and all under contract to \"20th Century Fox\". Five of the pictures seven main roles went to these ladies, and don't forget eighth billed Joan Valerie. While only two of the man roles went to the men, Charles Farrell and Kane Richmond.\n\nTwo more forgotten dramas later and Kane Richmond was back in another \"Cliff Hanger\".\n\nHAUNTED HARBOR aka: PIRATES HARBORthe First Chapter premiered on August 26, 1944\n\nThe acting Director was Spencer Gordon Bennet. Who started directing in 1921 and among his films are a large amount of \"B\" Westerns. Bennet's \"Cliff Hangers\" include, 1943's \"The Masked Marvel\", and \"G-Men vs The Black Dragon\". starring Rod Cameron. In 1944 are both \"The Tiger Woman\", starring \"B\" Cowboy Alan \"Rocky\" Lane, Linda Stirling and Duncan Renaldo and \"Zorro's Black Whip\", starring Linda Stirling as \"Zorro\".\n\nThe action Director was Wallace Grissell. Grissell started with 1944's, \"The Tiger Woman\" and also worked on \"Zorro's Black Whip\". Additionally with Linda Stirling's, 1945, \"Manhunt on Mystery Island\" and, Judd Holden's,1951's, \"Captain Video: Master of the Stratosphere\".\n\n\"Haunted Harbor\" was a 15 Chapter \"Cliff Hanger\" that ran four hours and three-minutes.\n\nKane Richmond portrayed \"Jim Marsden\".\n\nKay Aldridge portrayed \"Patricia Harding\". Aldridge was a model and her first on-screen appearance, without credit, was in \"Vogues of 1938\", released in 1937, as a model. In fact, 5 of her total 25 films, were without credit. Kay Aldridge did star opposite Clayton Moore, in the 1942, \"Cliff Hanger\", \"Perils of Nyoka\", portraying \"Nyoka Gordon\". in 1943. Aldridge co-starred with Alan \"Rocky\" Lane in the Western \"Cliff Hanger\", \"Daredevils of the West\" and her final motion picture was 1945's, \"The Phantom of 42nd Street\", about the murder of a Broadway actor.\n\nAbove, Kane Richmond and Kay Aldridge\n\nRoy Barcroft portrayed \"Carter aka: Kane\". Between 1931, as an extra in Greta Garbo's \"Mata Hari,\" to 1970's, Lee Marvin and French actress Jeanne Moreau's Western, \"Monte Walsh\". Roy Barcroft appeared on screen over 462 times. Normally, he played the bad guy, especially in Westerns, and had the title role in the 1945, \"Cliff Hanger\", \"The Purple Monster Strikes\". However, I first saw \"Roy Barcroft as \"Colonel Logan\", the owner of the \"Triple R Ranch\", on \"The Adventures of Spin and Marty\". That was shown on the original \"Mickey Mouse Club\".\n\nSea Captain \"Jim Marsden's\" ship \"The Dolphin\" is lost at sea with a million dollars in gold bullion in its hold. Should that amount seem small in February of 2021, as write this article. At this time, thank you inflation, it would equate to $14,862,613.64.\n\n\"Marsden\" is framed for a murder and just as he's about to be hanged. Two of his crew rescue him and they head for the island of Pulinan. Where, \"Marsden\", expects to find the real killer, his ex-partner, \"Kane\". Who the audience discovers is calling himself \"Carter\". There, they rescue \"Patricia Harding\" and her father, \"Dr. Oliver Harding\", played by Forrest Taylor. Of course, \"Patricia\" keeps getting herself caught by the bad guys, because that's the heroine's job in a \"Cliff Hanger\".\n\nA portion of the action takes place in the entitled, \"Haunted Harbor\". Which has a Chinese style dragon lurking. Don't laugh at the dragon's look. After all this is a Republic Picture \"Cliff Hanger\" and just go with it.\n\nBRENDA STARR, REPORTER the First Chapter premiered on January 26, 1945\n\n\"Brenda Starr\" was based upon a popular newspaper comic strip.\n\nThe \"Cliff Hanger\" was Produced by Sam Katzman. Katman had been Producing pictures since 1933 and the \"Showman\" taught William Castle the trade. Among Sam Katzman's productions are, 1942's. \"The Corpse Vanishes\", starring Bela Lugosi and Tristram Coffin. 1943's, \"Ghost on the Loose\", starring \"The Eastside Kids\". Who started out on Broadway and their first motion picture as \"The Dead End Kids\", and would end up by becoming, \"The Bowery Boys\". In 1948, Katzman brought \"Superman\" to the movie screen and a year later, he produced \"Batman and Robin\", both successful \"Cliff Hangers\". He was the executive producer for Ray Harryhausen's, 1955, \"It Came from Beneath the Sea\" and 1956's, \"Earth vs the Flying Saucers\". Sam Katzman even produced an Elvis Presley motion picture.\n\nMy article, \"Superman' Meets 'The Giant Claw' as the 'Earth vs the Flying Saucers': Executive Producer Sam Katzman\" will be read at:\n\nhttp://www.bewaretheblog.com/2018/10/superman-meets-giant-claw-as-earth-vs.html\n\nThe Director was Wallace Fox. Fox started out with \"B\" Westerns and forgotten Comedy short subjects. He graduated to \"The Eastside Kids\" and \"B\" Horror films, like \"The Corpse Vanishes\", for Sam Katzman. He directed Duncan Renaldo in his early \"Cisco Kid\" movies and found himself directing episodes of televisions, \"The Gene Autry Show\", \"The Range Rider\" and \"Annie Oakley\" in the early 1950's.\n\nJoan Woodbury portrayed \"Brenda Starr\". Woodbury started on-screen acting, without credit, in 1934. She portrayed \"The Queen in the Bottle\", in James Whale's 1935, \"Bride of Frankenstein\". In fact, 16 of her first 23 film roles were without credit. Joan Woodbury had third billing, behind Bruce Cabot, 1933's \"King Kong\", and Helen Mack, 1933's, \"Son of Kong\", in 1939's, \"Mystery of the White Room\".\n\nKane Richmond portrayed \"Police Lieutenant Larry Farrell\".\n\nSyd Saylor portrayed photographer \"Chuck Allen\". Saylor's first on-screen appearance was in the 1926 Western, \"The Winking Idol\", with tenth billing. The film was Directed by Francis Ford, the older brother of Director John Ford. His career would end with 441 roles in 1963, because of his looks, he was often referred to as \"Frog Face\" and he used a comedic sneeze as a trademark.\n\nAbove left, is Syd Saylor, Kane Richmond, Joan Woodbury and Joe Devlin as \"Police Sergeant Tim Brown\".\n\nWilliam \"Billy\" Benedict portrayed \"Pesky\". Benedict was a regular as one of \"The East Side Kids\" and \"The Bowery Boys\". Among his other \"Cliff Hangers\" are, 1940's, \"The Adventures of Red Ryder\", 1941's, \"The Adventures of Captain Marvel\", 1943's, \"The Adventures of the Flying Cadets\". In which he played a cadet with the colorful name of \"Zombie Parker\". At the end of his career, in 1988, on \"Bonanza: the Next Generation\", William Benedict had 320 roles to his credit.\n\nGangster \"Joe Heller\", played by Wheeler Oakman, is double-crossed after the robbery of a quarter-of-a-million-dollar payroll, takes all the money, and goes into hiding. He is discovered by another gangster, who was in on the robbery, named \"Kruger\", played by Jack Ingram. \"Kruger\" shoots \"Heller\" and leaves with a satchel containing the money from the robbery. \"The Daily Flash\" newspaper's star reporter, \"Brenda Starr\", stumbles upon the dying \"Heller\". Who gives her a coded message! When \"Kruger\" opens the satchel, it contains cut-up paper, but he knows about the message given to \"Brenda\".\n\nThe audience has not seen the last of actor Wheeler Oakman, as he plays \"Joe's\" twin brother, \"Lew Heller\", another gang leader after the money. \"Brenda Starr\" now attempts to solve the coded message and get her story. While, \"Police Lieutenant Larry Farrell\" is watching all those involved and especially \"Brenda Starr\". Who always seems to get into trouble and needs rescuing.\n\nAbove left, George Meeker is the \"Big Boss and Nightclub Owner Frank Smith\", talking with Jack Ingram's \"Kruger\".\n\nNext it was back to a 57 minute Crime Drama and Kane Richmond became the sleazy bad guy for a change of pace.\n\nBLACK MARKET BABIES released December 15, 1945\n\nThe feature was Directed by William Beaudine. Beaudine started Directing films in 1915 and went into television in 1953. His last actual directing assignment was in 1969, for the 1960 through 1969 television series \"Lassie\". Depending upon whose list you use, William Beaudine directed between 383 and 500 either motion pictures and television episodes. While, some biographers claim the total was even much higher.\n\nRalph Morgan portrayed \"Dr. Henry Jordan\". Morgan was the older brother of Frank Morgan, the title character in 1939's, \"The Wizard of Oz\". Some of Ralph Morgan's films are, 1932's, \"Strange Interlude\", starring Norma Shearer and Clark Gable, the 1935 version of \"Magnificent Obsession\", starring Irene Dunne and Robert Taylor, the \"Cliff Hanger\", \"Dick Tracy vs Crime Inc.\". starring Ralph Byrd, the title character in Universal Pictures, 1942, \"Night Monster\", with Bela Lugosi and Lionel Atwill, and 1944's, \"The Monster Maker\", co-starring J. Carrol Naish.\n\nKane Richmond portrayed \"Eddie Condon\".\n\nThis picture goes against Kane Richmond's screen persona and turns him into small-time racketeer, \"Eddie Condon\". Who comes up with a scheme to sell babies. \"Condon\" finds an alcoholic doctor, \"Dr. Henry Jordan\", and convinces him to establish \"Dr. Jordon's Maternity Manor\". The two prey on financially strapped pregnant woman without medical insurance, or a means to raise their newborns. The kindly doctor trades their babies for medical care and a safe delivery.\n\nEverything goes smoothly until a baby is still-born and \"Eddie Condon\" needs to find a replacement. This results in the authorities finally becoming aware of the operation. At the films climax, \"Dr. Jordan\" doesn't want to go along with the baby swap and a argument between \"Condon\" and \"Jordan\" develops. \"Eddie Condon\" pulls a gun and in a struggle over a gun, \"Dr. Jordan\" kills the other. The entire movie is told in flashback, as \"Jordon\" is testifying before \"District Attorney Hamilton\", played by Addison Richards.\n\n\"Poverty Row Studio, Monogram Pictures\", now cast Kane Richmond in the first of three pictures, whose character would be as tied to the actor as \"Alan Armstrong\". Yet, these were quickie, very low budgeted movies with holes in the scripts.\n\nFor my readers interest, there were a group of small studios that only had either rented office space, or a small lot area. They all either filmed on location, or rented space from the majors. The studios were all located on Gower Street, in Hollywood, and the street earned the nickname of \"Poverty Row\". They're story is part of my article, \"HOLLYWOOD: Segregated Housing, Motion Picture Studios and Movie Palaces\" at:\n\nhttp://www.bewaretheblog.com/2019/04/hollywood-segregated-housing-motion.html\n\nTHE SHADOW RETURNS released February 16, 1946\n\n\"The Shadow\" started out as a narrator for a series of mysteries on CBS radio, July 31, 1930. He morphed into a mystic character, after the written stories began, and lasted on radio through December 26, 1954.\n\nDifferent actors portrayed \"The Shadow\" on radio. Do you recognize the above radio actor? Of course, it's Orson Welles in 1937.\n\nThe transfer to a written character was by Pulp Mystery writer, Walter B. Gibson, starting on April 1, 1931. Between 1931 and 1932, Universal Pictures, released six short subject mysteries that used \"The Shadow\" as a narrator like the radio programs. In 1937, another \"Poverty Row Studio, Grand National Pictures\", made the first of two feature films about \"The Shadow\", portrayed by Rod La Rocque. Next, it was the Victor Jory, 1940, \"Cliff Hanger\".\n\n\"The Shadow Returns\" only runs sixty-one minutes, but is a non-stop, \"Cliff Hanger\" style, action mystery and the first of three with Kane Richmond.\n\nThe credited Director was Phil Rosen. Rosen started directing in 1915 and ended in 1951, with an episode of the forgotten television series, \"Front Page Detective\". That had starred forgotten actor, Edmund Lowe, the 1931 mystery \"The Spider\", the Bela Lugosi 1932, \"Chandu the Magician\", and 1945's, \"Dillinger\".\n\nThis was, also, one of William Beaudine's uncredited Directing assignments. Which is why no one is sure how many films he actually Directed.\n\nThe screenplay was by George Callahan. Callahan only has 33 films to his credit, but these include, eight, \"Charlie Chan\" mysteries, starring Sidney Toler.\n\nKane Richmond portrayed \"Lamont Cranston\" aka: \"The Shadow\".\n\nBarbara Read portrayed \"Margo Lane\". In 1937, Read, co-starred with Lewis Stone, of the \"Andy Hardy\" series with Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland and 1932's, \"The Mask of Fu Manchu\", starring Boris Karloff and an unknown Myrna Loy, in the very good Crime Drama, \"The Man Who Cried Wolf\". About a man who confesses to a series of murders he didn't commit. So when he does commit the planned murder, nobody will believe him.\n\nAbove Barbara Read with Tom Dugan as \"Moses 'Moe' Sherevitz\" aka: Shrevvie\". A cab driver that doubles as \"Lamont Cranston's and The Shadow's\" chauffer. Dugan was in the 1927 \"The Jazz Singer\", but his comic talent was put to good use in both Carole Lombard and Jack Benny's, 1942, \"To Be or Not to Be\" and the Frank Sinatra, Gene Kelly and Esther Williams musical, 1949's, \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\".\n\nPierre Watkin portrayed \"Lamont Cranston's Uncle\", \"Police Commissioner Weston\". Watkin portrayed a variety of roles such as Senator's, the U.S. Secretary of State and Lawyers. He portrayed Confederate \"General Robert E. Lee\" in a short subject, the \"French Prefect of Police\" in 1937's, \"The Life of Emile Zola\", a \"District Attorney\" in the Humphrey Bogart, 1939, \"King of the Underworld\" and \"Perry White\", in both Sam Katzman's \"Cliff Hanger's\", 1948's, \"Superman\" and 1950's, \"Atom Man vs Superman\".\n\nJoseph Crehan portrayed \"Police Inspector Cardona\". Crehan portrayed Police Officers, Judges and Military Officers primarily.\n\nAbove on the left is Pierre Watkin and on the right is Joseph Crehan.\n\nWhat starts out as a jewel robbery, isn't about the jewels as \"The Shadow\" will discover. Then there are four deaths, two apparently suicides and the other two not clear if they're the same, or murder. In fact, all are murders and it's what's used to kill these four that is the real mystery here. Instead of a straight Crime Drama, the screenplay adds Comic elements, like in the popular \"Thin Man\" series. Courtesy of \"Margo Lane\" and \"Shrevvie\".\n\nThe 1946 Film-Noir, \"Passkey to Danger\", followed. Then---\n\nBEHIND THE MASK released May 25, 1946\n\nNow, the credited Director was Phil Karlson. This was Karlson's eighth motion picture and he would go on to direct, the pilot for television's \"The Untouchables\", the Jeffrey Hunter war biography, 1960's, \"Hell to Eternity\", 1961's, \"The Secret Ways\", starring Richard Widmark, 1962's, \"Kid Galahad\", starring Elvis Presley, and two of Dean Martin's, \"Matt Helm\" series, 1966's, \"The Silencers\" with Stella Stevens, and, 1968's, \"The Wrecking Crew\", with Elke Sommer and Sharon Tate.\n\nAs before, William Beaudine, without credit, may have directed also.\n\nKane Richmond was \"Lamont Cranston\" aka: \"The Shadow\".\n\nAbove, George Chandler, Dorothea Kent as \"Shrevvie's\" girlfriend, \"Jennie Delaney\", Barbara Reed and Kane Richmond\n\nPierre Watkin portrayed \"Police Commissioner Weston\".\n\nJoseph Crehan portrayed \"Police Inspector Cardona\".\n\nWealthy Playboy and Business man \"Lamont Cranston\" is framed for murder. Now, it's up to \"The Shadow\" to find the real murderer and clear \"Cranston\".\n\nTHE MISSING LADY released August 17, 1946\n\nThe third and final film of the \"Monogram Pictures\" series, is by far the best and has a very good story.\n\nOnce again the Director was Phil Karson, but there is nothing indicating anyone else assisted.\n\nKane Richmond portrayed \"Lamont Cranston\" aka: \"The Shadow\".\n\nBarbara Read portrayed \"Margo Lane\".\n\nGeorge Chandler portrayed \"Shrevvie\"\n\nDorothea Kent portrayed \"Jennie Delaney\".\n\nPierre Watkin portrayed \"Police Commissioner Weston\".\n\nJames Flavin now portrayed \"Police Inspector Cardona\". Flavin graduated from West Point, but became an actor instead of an Army officer. Among his films are, Producer Merian C. Cooper's, 1932, \"The Most Dangerous Game\", 1933's, \"King Kong\" and 1949's, \"Mighty Joe Young\". He found himself in many roles as either a Police Officer, Sheriff, or Prison Warden.\n\nAbove James Flavin and Pierre Watkin\n\nA jade statue, known as \"The Lady\", is stolen and it's up to \"Lamont Cranston\" to find it and \"The Shadow\" to capture the thief's. However, a series of murders occur and, of course, \"The Shadow\" is blamed for them. As every time \"Lamont\" finds a suspect, that suspect is murdered.\n\nA normal shot in all three motion pictures was of \"The Shadow's Shadow\", rather than actually seeing him.\n\nThe very next motion picture had Kane Richmond dropped to fifth billing in the Anthony Quinn and Katherine DeMille, no relation to Cecil B., film, 1947's \"Black Gold\".\n\nThen the actor was back to first billing in another \"Cliff Hanger\".\n\nBRICK BRADFORD the First Chapter premiered on December 18, 1947\n\n\"Brick Braford\", like \"Brenda Starr\", was based upon a popular newspaper comic strip.\n\nThis was another Sam Katzman serial and was Directed by Spencer Gordon Bennet. While, \"B\" Western Director Thomas Carr did some of the action sequences.\n\nThe major problem with this \"Cliff Hanger\", is that it was written by three different writers and each was given a section to write. The three were given a story outline for their section and wrote them without consulting with the others.\n\nThe first five chapters were written by George H. Plympton. Whose \"Cliff Hanger\" work included, 1936's, \"Flash Gordon\", 1940's, \"Flash Gordon Conquerors the Universe\", 1939's, \"The Phantom Creeps\", both 1940's, \"The Green Hornet\" and \"The Green Hornet Strikes Again\", and 1942's, \"Captain Midnight\".\n\nThe second five chapters were written by Arthur Hoerl. Hoerl wrote silent screen drama's and mysteries between 1921 and 1929. Then switched to Crime Drama's and \"B\" Westerns. He wrote the screenplay for the Cult Classic, 1936's, \"Reefer Madness\", and created the basic story for \"Behind the Mask\". Arthur Hoerl's only other \"Cliff Hangers\", by this time, were also from 1947. The three are, \"Jack Armstrong\", \"Vigilante: Fighting Hero of the West\" and \"The Sea Hound\".\n\nTo illustrate the problem by splitting up the screenplay without coordination. Arthur Hoerl's five chapters are full of inside jokes that don't fit the first five's tone, or the final five chapters. Which doesn't fit either other writers work as the plot will also illustrate.\n\nThe final five chapters were written by Lewis Clay. His total output would be 16 titles and all \"Cliff Hangers\". Prior to this production he had written, the Western, 1942,\"The Valley of Vanishing Men\",\n\ndidn't write anything for four years and then wrote, 1946's, \"Son of the Guardsman\", followed by the three, 1947, \"Cliff Hangers\", mentioned by Arthur Hoerl.\n\nIt should be noted the all three writers worked on 1948's, \"Superman\" as one unit and not writing without coordination.\n\nKane Richmond portrayed \"Brick Bradford\".\n\nRick Vallin portrayed \"Sandy Sanderson\". Vallin was born in Crimea and became a major \"B\" movie character actor, including playing Native Americans, in almost every genre between 1938 and 1966. Among his films are the 1943 musical, \"The Desert Song\", the 1944 Comedy, \"Army Wives\", and the 1947 Western, \"Last of the Redmen\". Some of his other \"Cliff Hangers\" are, 1942's, \"Peril of the Royal Mounted\", 1949's, \"Batman and Robin\", 1949's, \"The Adventures of Sir Galahad\", starring George Reeves, and 1950's, \"Cody of the Pony Express\"\n\nAbove Kane Richmond and Rick Vallin.\n\nLinda Leighton as Linda Johnson, portrayed \"June Salisbury\". Johnson was primarily a \"B\" Western actress between 1940 and 1950. At which year she switched to television acting with an appearance on \"The Lone Ranger\" and remained in that medium through 1977.\n\nPierre Watkin portrayed \"Professor Salisbury\".\n\nCharles Quigley portrayed \"Laydron\". He had co-starred with Rita Hayworth in five of her first films under that name. Some of Quigley's other \"Cliff Hangers\" are, 1939's, \"Daredevils of the Red Circle\", 1941's, \"The Iron Claw\", 1946's, \"The Crimson Ghost\" and 1948's, \"Superman\"."
