        "text": "Since 2019, \"The Mandalorian\" has expanded audience's knowledge of the \"Star Wars\" universe with another story, introducing new characters and bringing back familiar faces from the franchise.\n\nThe Disney+ series stars Pedro Pascal as the titular character, a bounty hunter who travels through the outer reaches of the galaxy. Initially tasked to retrieve The Child for Imperial forces, the Mandalorian decides to protect the creature and goes on a quest for redemption.\n\nGrogu, colloquially called Baby Yoda, became a fan favorite after the release of \"The Mandalorian.\" With Season 3's premiere on March 1, there may be some lingering questions about the green creature.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Grogu, including how old he is, and if he and Yoda are the same.\n\nHow old is Baby Yoda?\n\nBaby Yoda is 50 years old at the beginning of \"The Mandalorian.\" Though his age seems old, Grogu is still developmentally a child, and this is due to how slow his species matures.\n\nHe was born around the year 41 Before the Battle of Yavin (BBY). In the Star Wars timeline, the events of \"The Mandalorian\" take place about five years after \"Star Wars: Return of the Jedi,\" which is set in 4 After the Battle of Yavin (ABY). This would mean \"The Mandalorian\" is set in 9 ABY. If Grogu is 50 years old, then he would be born in 41 BBY.\n\n'The Mandalorian': How Baby Yoda, no longer a 'helpless little child,' grows up in Season 3\n\nJust Curious: Your everyday questions, answered\n\nWhat is Baby Yoda's name?\n\nBaby Yoda's name is Grogu. His name was not revealed until Season 2 Episode 5, \"Chapter 13: The Jedi.\"\n\nPrior to then, Grogu was referred to by several names in the show. Din Djarin and others referred to Grogu as the \"Child,\" \"Baby\" or \"Kid.\" The Empire, on the other hand, called Grogu the \"Asset,\" \"Bounty,\" \"Target\" or \"Donor.\"\n\nIn the season 3 finale, \"Chapter 24: The Return,\" his name becomes \"Din Grogu,\" after being adopted by the Mandalorian. This comes from the Mandalorian's family name, \"Din.\"\n\nHow many Star Wars movies are there? In order of chronology, release date and 'machete.'\n\nIs Grogu Yoda?\n\nAccording to the events of \"The Mandalorian\" so far, Grogu and Yoda are not the same character. They are simply from the same species. The name of this species has never been revealed since \"Star Wars\" creator George Lucas wanted to give Yoda a sense of mystery.\n\nGrogu's physical appearance is similar to Yoda, the legendary Jedi Master from the \"Star Wars\" films. This sparked his fan-given colloquial nickname \"Baby Yoda.\"\n\nWithin \"Star Wars\" media, Grogu is the youngest known member of Yodaâ€™s species. He is one of three featured characters from this species. The other is Yaddle, the only other adult and female member of Yoda's species who appeared in \"Star Wars: The Phantom Menace\" and \"Tales of the Jedi.\"\n\nSeason 2 review: 'The Mandalorian' still can't unlock its potential\n\nMay the Force be with you: The definitive ranking of all 11 'Star Wars' movies\n\nWhere can you watch 'The Mandalorian'?\n\nSeason 3 of \"Mandalorian\" premiered March 1 on Disney+ with one episode. The season's finale was released on April 23. Watch here."
