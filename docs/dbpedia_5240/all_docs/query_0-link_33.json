        "text": "WENDALL THOMAS (Fall Lecture Series and Q&A)\n\nSince receiving her M.A. in English from the University of North Carolina, Wendall Thomas has worked in Los Angeles as a casting assistant, director's assistant, script reader, story editor, development executive, entertainment reporter, script consultant, and screenwriter, writing and developing projects for companies including Disney, Warner Brothers, Paramount, Universal, Showtime, PBS, RKO, A&E, NBC, Scottish Screen, and Australia’s Tojohage Productions.\n\nHer Cyd Redondo mystery novels (Poisoned Pen Press) have garnered six award nominations, including Best First Mystery (2017), Best Paperback Original Mystery (2019), and Best Humorous Mystery (2019, 2021). Her most recent, Cheap Trills, won Best Humorous Mystery of 2023. Her short fiction appears in various crime anthologies, including Murder-A-Go-Gos, Crime Under the Sun, and the upcoming Hollywood Kills.\n\nShe’s been featured on the Cleveland Public Library’s “Writers Unplugged” series, NPR’s “Dog Talk,” on the Crime Wave, Aural Mess, Simply Write, and Writers Bar podcasts as well as the Career Authors website, and in Suspense Magazine, Book Reporter, and Mystery Readers Journal. She also blogs with eight other international mystery writers at Murder is Everywhere: (https://murderiseverywhere.blogspot.com).\n\nIn addition to writing and consulting, she is in her twenty-eighth year as Adjunct Professor of Screenwriting in the Professional Program at UCLA, has been a Star Speaker for Creative Screenwriting’s Screenwriting Expo, has consulted for the Atelier du Cinéma Européen Producing Program in Paris, served as Writer’s Mentor for Screen South’s UK Good Foundations program, and directed the LA FEATURES writer’s mentorship program in the UK.

She presented her \"Wendall Thomas Talks Scripts\" lecture series at the Melbourne International Film Festival from 2011 through 2019 and presented 24 lectures for Screen Queensland in between 2018 and 2020.\n\nShe’s been lucky enough to have students and clients who have won the Samuel Goldwyn and UCLA Screenwriting Competitions, been finalists in the Academy Nicholls Fellowship, the Page International and Austin Film Festival Screenwriting Competitions, HBO’s short film showcase, and the Queer Screen Goes to Cannes Showcase. For a full list of recent student/client projects, see her website at www.wendallthomas.com.\n\nKRIS YOUNG (Winter Lecture Series and Q&A)\n\nKris received his MFA in screenwriting from UCLA (’98) where he was a finalist in the Screenwriting Showcase and placed second in the Samuel Goldwyn Awards. He has written six movies for Disney Channel including Teen Angel (Jason Priestley and Jennie Garth) and Teen Angel Returns. He has also written pilots for CBS and Nickelodeon, as well as features for Columbia, Trimark and producers Richard Pryor, Terence Chang and Bill Badalato. His micro-mini movie, Mosquito Cupid, was produced for ABC-Touchstone. Young was also a staff lyricist for five years for Grammy-winning R&B producer Freddie Perren (I Will Survive) where he wrote for Grammy Award winning and nominated artists such as Tavares, Mighty Clouds of Joy, Peaches & Herb, The Spinners and Johnny Gill. (A music career highlight for Young was having a song performed on Soul Train.) Young was a founding member of the WGA Asian-American Committee, co-chairing from 2006 to 2013. He’s been with the Professional Program since 2001 and has taught the undergrad senior concentration in screenwriting for UCLA’s School of Theater, Film and Television since 2005. He’s also taught for L.A. Film Studies Center, UCLA’s Summer Arts Program for teens, Visual Communications, East-West Players and the L.A. Juvenile Probation Center in Watts.\n\nMARC ARNESON\n\nBefore coming to Los Angeles, Marc earned a Master’s Degree in Political Science from the University of Oregon and served as a Peace Corps volunteer in Mongolia. He is a graduate of both the UCLA MFA and Professional Screenwriting Programs, and has won numerous honors including: the UCLA Screenwriters Showcase, the Jack Nicholson Prize in Screenwriting, the Harmony Gold Screenwriting Award, the Zaki Gordon Award for Excellence in Screenwriting and the Showtime/Tony Cox Screenwriting Award, as well as being selected writer-in-residence at the prestigious Nantucket Screen Writers Colony. He has since developed and sold online, television and film projects including the independently produced feature Just Peck (written while a UCLA MFA student), starring Academy Award nominee Brie Larson. Marc has been a screenwriting instructor at UCLA since 2011, teaching Professional Program students as well as visiting filmmakers from the Accademia Nazionale Del Cinema, Bologna, Italy. Additionally, he was a Visiting Professor of Screenwriting at the Hollins University MFA Graduate Program and currently teaches undergraduate and graduate courses at the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television.\n\nRITA M. AUGUSTINE\n\nSince Rita’s epiphany—deep in the suburbs of Philadelphia—that she would commit her life to screenwriting (the best job she dared imagine), she’s been on a terrifying and exhilarating journey. Terrifying because each success (and failure) has led to a threshold into the unknown. Exhilarating because each time she’s stepped across, she’s found fulfilling collaborations, friendships, and meaning on the other side.\n\nGraduating from the MFA Screenwriting Program at UCLA (where she studied alongside many talented graduates of the UCLA Professional Program) was the first step that made the rest possible. Winning and later producing the UCLA Showcase led to representation by top Hollywood agents and managers and the development of her projects with executives and producers at major studios including Warner Brothers, Sony, and even having her script considered by the head of Fox as their summer tent-pole. Winning the Sloan Screenwriting competition led to NASA-mentorship, paid rewrites in tandem with screenwriter David Twohy (The Fugitive, Pitch Black), and recently ImageMovers has signed a letter of intent to come on as producers of her script Ice Moon Rising (set on Jupiter’s moon Europa), with Robert Zemeckis to potentially direct and film on location in Australia. (Nowadays, Rita even spends Thanksgivings with the NASA Clipper Mission scientists who will be sending an actual spaceship to Europa in 2024.)\n\nIt was a UCLA producer friend who hired Rita to write the greenlit draft of the SNK Playmore videogame adaptation of King of Fighters, directed by Hong-Kong action director Gordon Chan and starring Maggie Q. This led to membership in the Writer’s Guild and being hired to write US–China film co-productions on location with international teams in Shanghai and Beijing, including Rick Porras, the co-producer of The Lord of the Rings, and Shiao Yi, one of greatest wuxia (“martial-arts heroes”) genre novelists of the modern era.\n\nThese experiences, along with her undergraduate background in ancient literature, convinced producers to bring her in as a co-producer on Hawaiian Goddess, along with Thomas Pa’a Sibbett, an executive with Jason Momoa’s Pride of Gypsies. Rita was recently hired to rewrite the script, and her draft is now out to A-list directors including Zack Snyder. Back on the East Coast, not far from her place of origin, director Michael Maren (who just finished filming Shriver with Michael Shannon and Kate Hudson) is attached to direct her thriller Mirror Lake, set in the New York City literary world.\n\nComing full circle, Rita is now thrilled to teach alongside some of her brilliant fellow classmates, helping the upcoming generation of UCLA Professional Program students hone their screenwriting skills to pursue their own rewarding journeys into the unknown.\n\nMICHAEL COLLEARY\n\nMichael is a screenwriter, producer, educator and screenwriting consultant for more than 3 decades. During his 35-plus year career he’s worked for all major movie studios and TV networks. His produced credits include Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, the family comedy Firehouse Dog; and the TV series Unnatural History. Michael won a Saturn Award for co-writing (with Mike Werb) the John Woo-directed action thriller Face/Off, which the New York Times deemed “one of the best 1000 movies ever made.” Michael is the co-creator and showrunner for the television series Professionals starring Tom Welling and Brendan Fraser which aired on the CW’s Fall, 2022, primetime schedule. He is currently attached to write and produce the TV adaptation of the graphic novel series “Razor” for Jeff Most Productions.\n\nSince the mid-90s Michael has been a visiting instructor for the Screenwriting MFA program at UCLA where he teaches the famed 434 screenwriting workshop. His students have gone on to write, direct and/or produce such movies and television series as The Bad Batch, Patriot, Bojack Horseman, The Punisher, Modern Family and many more. For his contributions to the program’s students, UCLA honored him with the Lew and Pamela Hunter/Jonathan and Janice Zakin Chair in Screenwriting.\n\nMichael was born and raised in Montclair, New Jersey. His father was Bob Colleary who was head writer of the Baby Boom-generation children’s show, Captain Kangaroo, for which he won the prestigious Peabody Award. After graduating from the University of California, Berkeley, Michael enrolled in UCLA’s renowned film school where he specialized in screenwriting. While earning his MFA, Michael won the Jack Nicholson Award and the William Morris Award for screenwriting excellence.\n\nJENNIFER EDWARDS\n\nJennifer is a writer who targets an audience’s heart. She has multiple produced television movies including Just For The Summer, A Storybook Christmas, Deadly Jealousy: The Killer Cousin, is in development on several more optioned projects and works as a writing consultant. She has a Screenwriting MFA from UCLA where she also won a Sloan Foundation Screenwriting Award for her original feature Family Brew. Growing up in a small town in Ohio, she always wanted to write, but first pursued other goals. She earned a BA in Middle Eastern Studies from Mount Holyoke College, and spent her junior year at the American University in Cairo, Egypt, where she volunteered to teach English to Ethiopian and Sudanese refugees. She went on to teach high school English and English as a Second Language in Texas. She believes in the power of story to transform our lives and our world and creates content that entertains and encourages.\n\nSIMON HERBERT\n\nSimon is the co-writer/director/producer (with fellow UCLA screenwriting alums Phil Guidry and David Whelan) of the horror feature Savageland-- released by Terror Films, internationally. Savageland has screened at numerous festivals including: Comic-Con; Morbido Festival, Mexico; and FilmQuest Film Festival, Utah. It has won eight awards including: Best Director at the New Orleans Horror Film Festival; and Best Feature in: Nevermore, NC; Independent Filmmakers festival, CA; Eerie Horror Fest, PA; and the Atlanta Horror Film Festival, GA. Simon usually writes solo, and has won the Harmony Gold Award in Excellence. He has no fear of any genre; but knows that he is terrible at comedy (his one ‘comedy’ script – unfunny at a sub-atomic level - was buried in a lead container in the Mariana Trench; where rotations of freestyle aquatic pit bulls, 11,00 meters down, still guard it bravely from the gaze of innocents), which frees him up for darker stuff. Noir. Horror. Thriller. Simon hates people that get “your” and “you’re” mixed up (and will visit your house to explain the difference), but otherwise has a sunny disposition. He models his screenwriting classes on the fine example of R. Lee. Ermey in Full Metal Jacket, and you will give him twenty. He is repped by Management 360.\n\nWILL HONLEY\n\nWill has more than a decade of experience writing for film and television. Originally from Missouri, he spent his first several years in Los Angeles haunting the halls of UCLA, graduating from both the Professional and MFA Programs. Will has sold or optioned material to Sony, Universal, Disney, Blumhouse, Davis Entertainment, Automatik Entertainment, Crypt TV and Original Films. His script Flashback, written when he was still in grad school, was featured on the annual Blacklist. Will's feature credits include The Hive, Bloodline and Escape Room: Tournament of Champions, and Blood, directed by Brad Anderson and starring Michelle Monaghan. On the television side, Will sold his original pilot, Reset, to NBC. In addition to his solo work, Will adapted the novel Verity for Amazon Studios with his writing partner, April Maguire. The two of them also sold an original thriller series to NBC and a scary kids movie to Disney. Their original sci-fi movie Subservience, directed by SK Dale and starring Megan Fox was recently released, and they're currently in development on their horror movie Wolf Night, which sold to Screen Gems and is being produced by Platinum Dunes.\n\nSALVADOR PASKOWITZ\n\nSalvador Paskowitz is the 7th son of 8 brothers and 1 sister from a famous Mexican/Hungarian surfing family. His father is a Stanford doctor who bucked convention and traveled the world with his LatinX partner and their 9 kids. Their exploits were featured in the award winning documentary Surfwise, by Doug Pray and Magnolia Films.\n\nSalvador's career origins began as part of the surf apparel industry, where he was chief designer for Billabong Sportswear and later Hurley Clothing. In his youth was classically trained in oil on canvas at the Arts Students League in New York City. Salvador published his first comic book (Surf Crazed and Wave Warriors) as a teenager. Both featured in the internationally published Surfing Magazine.\n\nAn avid reader of all books since his childhood days of traveling and surfing Salvador turned to Screenwriting full time in 2009 and in 2015 \"Age of Adaline\", which Salvador created and co-wrote, starring Blake Lively and Harrison Ford, was released worldwide by Lakeshore Media.\n\nSalvador projects include:THE BIG EVERYTHING short film.
