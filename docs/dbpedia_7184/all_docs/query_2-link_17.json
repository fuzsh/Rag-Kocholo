        "text": "Great Canadian Entertainment, Canada’s leading gaming and hospitality company, announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to sell its landmark Vancouver Island property, Casino Nanaimo, to Petroglyph Development Group Ltd (Petroglyph) in a historic transaction for both parties. Petroglyph is a wholly owned corporation of the Snuneymuxw First Nation dedicated to realizing the economic potential of the Nation.\n\nGreat Canadian’s Board of Directors unanimously approved the transaction, which remains subject to customary closing conditions as well as customary approvals by the regulatory authorities. Under the terms of the definitive agreement, the Company will provide transition services to Petroglyph for up to two years post-closing.\n\n“We are very pleased to have executed this agreement. As the operator of Casino Nanaimo since its inception in 1986, we believe that under Petroglyph’s steady management, this transaction will provide Casino Nanaimo, its guests and team members with an exciting new chapter. We look forward to the closing and then working with the Petroglyph team during the transition period to ensure an outstanding outcome for all parties,” said Matt Anfinson, Chief Executive Officer of the Company.\n\n“We celebrate our partnership with Great Canadian and our entry into B.C.’s casino industry. We are committed to bringing Snuneymuxw’s local expertise to an established tradition of outstanding guest service and meaningful community contributions. Honouring the decades of work by past Snuneymuxw Chiefs and Councils, we look forward to closing the definitive agreement and realizing our collective vision with the Great Canadian team. This collaboration promises to bring significant benefits and substantial economic growth to our Nation and the local community,” said Snuneymuxw Chief Mike Wyse.\n\nErralyn Joseph, President of Petroglyph Development Group (PDG), said: “The Snuneymuxw group of companies are profoundly honoured to support Snuneymuxw economic growth in significant and meaningful ways. In addition to our pending acquisition of the business, we are honoured to announce the return of the associated land once closing is completed, a part of the Snuneymuxw xwsol’lexwel village. On behalf of the Board of Directors, we are pleased to share this news and remain committed to advancing the region’s economic growth in support of all its residents.”\n\nIan Simpson, Chief Executive Officer of PDG, said: “Acquiring this significant asset will unlock unprecedented economic potential for Snuneymuxw and PDG, paving the way for transformative growth in Snuneymuxw’s economy and the profits that PDG returns to our Nation.”\n\nMcMillan is serving as legal counsel to Great Canadian. McCarthy Tétrault is acting as legal counsel and KPMG Corporate Finance Inc. is acting as financial advisor to Petroglyph.\n\nPeter & Sons is thrilled to announce its latest milestone in the online gaming industry. Effective immediately, its acclaimed games are now live with Rootz portfolio of brands in both the MGA (Malta Gaming Authority) and Ontario licensed markets. This exciting partnership allows the studio to bring its innovative and engaging gaming experiences to a broader audience, strengthening its position as a game developer.\n\nIts exciting portfolio of games is now featured on five of Rootz’s most popular brands: Wildz, Caxino, Wheelz, Spinz, and Chipz. These brands are celebrated for their exceptional user experiences, diverse game selections and strong customer loyalty, making them the perfect platforms to host Peter & Sons’ unique and captivating games.\n\nPeter & Sons has rapidly built a reputation for creating visually stunning and entertaining games that stand out in the crowded online gaming industry. Its titles are characterised by high-quality graphics, engaging storylines and innovative gameplay mechanics, ensuring that players have an unforgettable gaming experience.\n\nRootz, a leading iGaming company, is renowned for its cutting-edge technology and customer-centric approach. The integration of Peter & Sons’ games into Rootz’s portfolio demonstrates the duo’s shared commitment to delivering superior entertainment and satisfaction to players across various markets.\n\nYann Bautista, Commercial Director of Peter & Sons, stated: “We are excited to partner with Rootz and extend our presence in the MGA and Ontario licensed markets. This collaboration allows us to bring our creative and engaging games to a larger audience, and we are confident that players will love the unique experiences our games offer.”\n\nSam Brown, CEO of Rootz, added: “Peter & Sons brings something new and fresh to the slots space which players love. Integrating their games into our portfolio aligns perfectly with our strategy to offer diverse and high-quality gaming options to our users. We look forward to a successful partnership and are excited to see how our players respond to these new additions.”\n\niGaming Ontario announced that a joint bid by Integrity Compliance 360 (IC360) and IXUP has been selected to develop a new centralized self-exclusion system for Ontario, which will be the first of its kind in North America.\n\n“We look forward to working with IC360, IXUP, OLG and our operators to develop a centralized self-exclusion program for Ontario’s igaming players. This project reflects our ongoing commitment to build on the existing player protections here in Ontario. With IC360’s tech-first expertise in betting integrity through ProhiBet and IXUP’s demonstrated success with BetStop in Australia, we’re confident they will help us build a robust self-exclusion system for Ontarians who decide to take a short- or long-term break from gambling,” said Martha Otton, iGaming Ontario Executive Director.\n\nIC360 is a global leader in delivering tech-forward, innovative integrity and compliance products and services within igaming and sports betting integrity. IXUP designed, delivered, and now operates Australia’s BetStop national self-exclusion register. Together, IC360 and IXUP will provide Ontario with an effective self-exclusion system designed to support players’ decisions to self-exclude while also protecting their privacy.\n\n“IC360 is excited to work with iGaming Ontario to generate a system that brings the highest standard of responsible gambling tools to one of the world’s leading gaming jurisdictions. Through our tool ProhiBet and our education services we have always been strongly committed to responsible gambling and look forward to working with all stakeholders to deliver the best self-exclusion solution to protect players in Ontario,” Eric Frank, President of IC360, said.\n\nAl Watson, IXUP CEO said, “This project is a significant moment for responsible gambling in North America. The entire IXUP team has worked exceptionally hard to establish IXUP as a key provider of state-of-the-art online gambling self-exclusion products globally, made possible by the application of our world leading secure data collaboration engine and we are extremely excited to continue this work in Ontario.”\n\niGaming Ontario and the IC360-IXUP team will begin developing this centralized self-exclusion system immediately, working closely with all its igaming operators and OLG. With the new centralized self-exclusion system, players will be able to self-exclude from all regulated igaming sites in Ontario at once, including OLG.ca, adding another layer of protection under the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO)’s Registrar’s Standards for Internet Gaming.\n\nSelf-exclusion is an important step that can help to protect players from experiencing harm from gambling by supporting their decision to take a break from regulated igaming websites.\n\n“Congratulations to iGaming Ontario on this important milestone. Player health is a cornerstone of OLG’s business. We are committed to ongoing improvements to responsible gambling efforts so that our industry can offer a safer, more enjoyable experience for all players in Ontario,” Duncan Hannay, President and CEO of OLG, said.\n\nEach regulated igaming site in Ontario is already required to offer a self-exclusion program that is well-promoted, easily accessible to customers and includes resources and information about problem gambling support services, according to the Registrar’s Standards for Internet Gaming.\n\n“Requirements for robust player protections and responsible gambling safeguards are central to the AGCO’s regulatory standards for Ontario’s gaming industry. Once the new, centralized self-exclusion system is available, all registered gaming operators in the province will be required to participate and this will go a long way in supporting players who wish to stop or take a break from gambling in Ontario,” Dr. Karin Schnarr, CEO and Registrar of the AGCO, said.\n\nThe BC Lottery Corporation (BCLC) has advised PlayNow users to update their passwords following a recent incident.\n\nAccording to the BCLC, PlayNow detected a suspiciously high volume of traffic on the site on July 24.\n\nAfter the data was reviewed, PlayNow identified the traffic was the result of “credential stuffing,” where criminals attempt to access player accounts using email addresses and passwords previously exposed or stolen from other companies.\n\nCredential stuffing works on the premise that people often use the same user ID and password across multiple websites.\n\n“This is a deeply concerning incident and a cautionary tale for everyone with multiple online accounts,” said BCLC President and CEO Pat Davis.\n\n“Our investigation remains ongoing, and we have found no evidence that our systems have been compromised, or that player login information was stolen from our systems.”\n\nPlayNow says impacted players’ accounts were locked due to suspicious activity immediately after determining credential stuffing had taken place, and measures were taken to block suspicious traffic.\n\nThe BCLC has advised all PlayNow users to change their passwords as a precautionary measure.\n\n“Integrity and security are at the core of our business and our games,” Davis said.\n\n“We are committed to continuing our ongoing evaluation and enhancement of PlayNow security controls to maintain the safety of our players’ information going forward.”"
