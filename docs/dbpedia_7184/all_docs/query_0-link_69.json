(Trion), the publisher and developer of server-based dynamic online games and connected entertainment, is expanding its portfolio with an innovative project, developed by the award winning, independent game development studio, Petroglyph. The companies are creating a massively multiplayer online real-time strategy (MMORTS) game, set to define a new genre and standard for online games. Petroglyph is utilizing Trion’s advanced server architecture, designed to enable massive scalability, dynamic content evolution and cross platform development, to create an epic gaming experience. The game represents the first 3rd-party development on the Trion Platform, and will be published by Trion worldwide.\n\n“Trion is thrilled to partner with such decorated and extremely talented game vets as the Petroglyph team,” said Lars Buttler, co-founder and CEO, Trion. “We are very excited about bringing the world’s first truly high-end MMORTS to market and we can’t wait to share with gamers the innovative and fun game design Petroglyph is creating on the Trion platform.”\n\nTrion and Petroglyph’s collaboration will breathe new life into the RTS genre. Renowned for developing high quality and innovative RTS games that appeal on a global level, Petroglyph is responsible for many critically acclaimed RTS titles including the Star Wars®: Empire At War™ series, collectively selling several million copies. During their time at Westwood Studios, founding members of the Petroglyph team also helped create Dune 2, widely regarded as one of the most influential real-time strategy games, and played significant leadership roles on seminal RTS franchises like Command and Conquer and Red Alert. Trion’s expansive team of game industry veterans, coupled with their cutting edge server architecture, will ensure a true evolution of the RTS genre by adding the MMO paradigm to it.\n\n“Petroglyph is extremely excited to be working with a visionary publisher like Trion World Network,” said Michael Legg, president and co-founder of Petroglyph. “Combining Trion’s platform and industry expertise with our GLYPH game technology and our development pedigree will allow us to unleash a groundbreaking MMORTS gaming experience to the world.”\n\nWith two internal development studios in Redwood City and San Diego, CA, and a technology studio in Austin, TX, Trion is creating server-based games that will fundamentally change how dynamic entertainment is made, distributed and consumed. Trion team members have worked on, developed and shipped more than 100 original games."
