        "text": "It's happening! EA reached out to the PC gaming community to find out what should be done with the Command & Conquer series and they've answered in kind. Now only are Command & Conquer Remastered and Command & Conquered: Red Aler Remastered in the works, EA is partnering up with Petroglyph Games for this collection.\n\nPetroglyph Games is made up of original developers from Westwood Studios, the studio that birthed Command & Conquer. This is a response to fans' concerns that EA wouldn't be able to pull off the revival of the series on PC and the move should sooth a lot of concerns. Another element of this collection should help, as well.\n\nCommand & Conquer: Red Alert Remastered will include the three expansion packs, Covert Ops, Counterstrike, and Aftermath, and no microtransactions will be involved, the EA blog post reads. That last bit is a wild qualified for such a game, but is a reminder of the reality in the gaming industry today. It wasn't long ago that Activision released the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare remaster and charged more for the DLC than even the original game required.\n\nCommand & Conquer Co-Creator Joe Bostic, Lead Programmer Steve Tall, and audio specialist Mike Legg will all be contributing to the project. Composer and Audio Director Frank Klepacki was the #1 request from the community, so he'll also be joining Petroglyph Games for the remaster collection."
