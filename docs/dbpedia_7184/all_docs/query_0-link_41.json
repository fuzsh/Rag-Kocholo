        "text": "Introducing the RTS Masterminds Podcast: a monthly show where 2 professional RTS game designers who also happen to be avid RTS players and content creators talk about topics related to the gaming industry and real time strategy gaming. Welcome to the battlefield.\n\nA hidden gem of the RTS genre, Universe at War came out in 2007/2008, developed by Petroglyph Games. It’s got a community dedicated to bringing the game back to life. I’m so thrilled to be a part of things that I wanted to cast a couple of matches! This is the second UAW match I’ve done commentary on, and my plan is to continue doing at least one a month from here on out."
