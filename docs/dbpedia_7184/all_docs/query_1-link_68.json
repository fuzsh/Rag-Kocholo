He recently became the second highest grossing touring comedian and is one of the most watched comedians on YouTube with over 1.1 billion views and over 25 million fans on social media.\n\nIglesias has been included in The Hollywood Reporter's \"Top 40 Comedy Players\" issue alongside comedy giants Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Rock and Lorne Michaels. Last year he also was honored with the cover of Variety's comedy issue. The comedian has had the distinct honor of being one of the few to headline and sell-out Madison Square Garden in New York, Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles and The Sydney Opera House in Australia.\n\nOn TV, Iglesias is the star and executive producer of the Netflix original comedy series, Mr. Iglesias, which is currently streaming 3 seasons. Iglesias plays a good-natured public high school teacher who works at his alma mater. He takes on teaching gifted but misfit kids to not only save them from being \"counseled out\" by a bully bureaucrat Assistant Principal, but also to help them unlock their full potential. In 2020, the show won best Primetime Comedy at The Imagen Awards, which recognizes positive portrayals of Latinx actors/actresses in the entertainment industry.\n\nIn addition to his comedy series, Iglesias penned a deal with Netflix to release two stand-up comedy specials. The first, titled One Show Fits All, was filmed in front of a sold-out audience at the Toyota Center in Houston and debuted in January 2019. The second, Stadium Fluffy premiered on October 18th and was taped in front of a crowd of 55,000 fans at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, where Iglesias made history as the first comedian to perform at and sellout the largest MLB stadium in the US.\n\nBoth of these specials are follow-ups to his highly successful 2016 special, I'm Sorry For What I Said When I Was Hungry, which was filmed at the Allstate Arena in Chicago to two sold-out shows with a total of 20,000 fans in attendance.\n\nUp next, Iglesias will co-star Tim Allen in the second season of Disney+'s The Santa Clauses. Iglesias will play Kris Kringle, the owner and operator of a Christmas-themed amusement park called Santaland. Sweet, happy, and perpetually-optimistic, Kris is a warm, generous soul who is determined to keep his struggling theme park afloat. However, his belief in Santa and love for all things Christmas may not be enough.\n\nFeature film credits include co-starring roles in Magic Mike, Magic Mike XXL and A Haunted House 2. Gabriel's voice has been heard in many animated films including the recent Space Jam: A New Legacy as \"Speedy Gonzales\" streaming on HBOMAX. In 2017, Iglesias voiced the role of \"Head Clerk\" in Pixar's Academy Award nominated animated film Coco. He also voiced \"Babo\" in Ugly Dolls, \"Rufus the Dog\" in Sony's Golden Globe nominated animated holiday film The Star and \"Cuatro\" in Fox 20th Century Film's Academy Award nominated animated film Ferdinand. Gabriel is one of a handful of comedians with a theatrically released stand-up concert comedy film, TheFluffy Movie.\n\nOn the small screen, Fluffy's Food Adventures, a non-scripted comedic docu-follow series completed a 3-season run on FUSE TV in 2017. Gabriel was a recurring guest star on the ABC sitcom Cristela, and also guest-starred in an episode of ABC's hit comedy Modern Family. Comedy Central aired Iglesias' hit series Stand-Up Revolution for 3 seasons. Comedy Central also aired Gabriel Iglesias: Aloha Fluffy in an unprecedented two-night comedy special to over 15 million viewers. The special was a follow-up to his previous DVD specials, Hot & Fluffy and I'm Not Fat...I'm Fluffy, which have sold millions of copies.\n\nGabriel Iglesias is the youngest of six children, raised by a single mother in Long Beach, CA. It was during his childhood that he developed a strong sense of humour to deal with the obstacles he faced. In 1997, he set out to hone his comedic skills, and performed stand-up anywhere he could find an audience; including biker bars and hole-in-the-wall joints. Gabriel's stand-up comedy is a mixture of storytelling, parodies, characters and sound effects that bring his personal experiences to life. His unique and animated comedy style has made him popular among fans of all ages.\n\nIglesias is repped by CAA, Arsonhouse Entertainment and Hirsch Wallerstein Hayum.\n\nAbout Great Canadian Casino Resort Toronto\n\nGreat Canadian Casino Resort Toronto stands as Canada's newest and largest destination for premier gaming and entertainment, and one of the largest in North America, offering an unparalleled experience that seamlessly merges contemporary sophistication with exceptional leisure.
