        "text": "Cross-platform play is a feature that allows players to enjoy the same game across different devices or consoles, such as PC, PlayStation, Xbox, or Nintendo Switch. This can enhance the player experience, as they can play with their friends regardless of their hardware preferences, and also expand the potential audience and revenue for the game developers. Some examples of games that support cross-platform play are Fortnite, Minecraft, Rocket League, and Call of Duty: Warzone.\n\n3. TEKKEN 8: Fans got really excited to hear the news that TEKKEN 8 for the first time ever in the history of the franchise, that it's going to support Cross-Play. This is very vital to overall experience as players will have less waiting-time in the practice sessions and get more battles.\n\nCross-platform play always made a lot of sense as long as the servers could handle it. It opens up player groups together and also in the end saves money by having to host a lower number of servers. From a player's perspective, cross-platform can destabilize game economies where applicable at first (see Warframe) but in the end it always normalizes and the effects are positive across the board, both for players and developers, although for different reasons. If you stop and think about it, the concept has been applied in the iGaming industry as well, considering the way slot games work and them being available both on mobile and computers, with the same prize pools.\n\nFootball Manager and it's decision to cross-platform its franchise has been a big win. To have a football management sim playable across PC, XBOX, PlayStation, Streaming (Netflix) and Nintendo is unique. It's also made save games accessible across versions i.e. you can play an FM23 save in FM24. This has taken FM's sales to another level. FM23 it took 284 days to reach 6m players. Due to the cross-platform strategy, FM24 took just 59 days to hit 6m players. This is the impact cross-platform has.\n\nRemakes and remasters are games that are based on older titles, but have been updated or improved in some way, such as graphics, gameplay, or content. These games can appeal to both nostalgic fans and new players, as they can offer a fresh perspective or a modernized version of a classic game. Some examples of games that have been successfully remade or remastered are Resident Evil 2, Final Fantasy VII, The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening, and Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy.\n\nEven though some old titles from famous franchises are dead, but this culture of remakes is often demanded by the fans and community of the franchise. It gives the players the hits of nostalgia and travels them back to the old good times. Ranging from GTA to Assassin's Creed. There are going to be seen a lot of the remakes for many more games.\n\nA studio that deserves all the praise it gets is Nightdive Studios for their amazing remasters and remakes. Bringing those FPS games from the odd era of Windows 98-XP that don't run in DOS Box and aren't easily installable to modern systems. Doom 64, Turok, System Shock, and the incredible Quake Remasters, to name a few.\n\nFrom an older gamer's perspective, remakes and remasters don't really appeal to me as much. From a working professional's standpoint however, I love them, as they open up older games to new audiences. My friends found out they liked \"old gems\" by playing the remastered versions, gems they would have not considered otherwise because players sometimes think newer is better. From a developer's standpoint, remakes are a wonderful idea as they can save up a lot of time on design and, time permitting, can work on delivering a much more polished end-result than most games which are made from scratch.\n\nCrossovers and mashups are games that combine elements, characters, or worlds from different franchises or genres, creating a unique and fun experience for the players. These games can generate excitement and curiosity, as they can offer unexpected or surprising combinations or interactions. Some examples of games that have been successful in creating crossovers or mashups are Super Smash Bros., Kingdom Hearts, Lego Star Wars, and Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle.\n\nI would say Fortnite is a great example, and one of the first to do it regularly with big brands and well-known figures, started with Marvel and Thanos and now they have new collaborations frequently (Starwars, Dragonball, Rick and Morty etc), Lego is a big one where players just love the new playable Lego world.\n\nCrossovers and mashups represent a creative fusion in gaming, blending different franchises and genres to create novel experiences. They spark excitement by uniting disparate characters and worlds, offering players both surprise and familiarity. Games like Super Smash Bros. and Kingdom Hearts showcase the potential of this approach, marrying varied universes to captivate fans. This innovative blend not only broadens the appeal of games but also allows for exploring fresh, imaginative gameplay dynamics.\n\nModding and user-generated content are ways that players can create, modify, or share their own content for a game, such as levels, characters, items, or scenarios. This can enhance the replay value, variety, and creativity of the game, as well as foster a loyal and engaged community. Some examples of games that have been successful in supporting modding or user-generated content are Skyrim, Half-Life, LittleBigPlanet, and Roblox.\n\nHere more examples : Minecraft: Famous for its extensive modding community and the ability for players to create their own worlds and scenarios. The Sims series: Known for its robust community creating custom content like clothing, furniture, and even gameplay modifications. Kerbal Space Program: Allows players to create their own spacecraft and missions, with a strong community creating mods for additional features. Grand Theft Auto series (especially GTA V): Offers extensive modding opportunities, with a community creating everything from new vehicles to entire gameplay overhauls. Warcraft III: The custom game modes created by players, like Defense of the Ancients, laid the foundation for entire game genres (MOBAs).\n\nWith the Discord servers dedicated to modding community of a specific game, the modders are doing a great job in terms of adding new features. And sometimes even fixing the graphical issues or other bugs that are present in the original titles. For example, recently GTA IV for PC was modded by community to fix the graphics and make it look good. Often modders also add new fun mechanics and give a new perspective to the experience compared to original versions. GTA has seen a lot of stuff like this, Superman MOD, Batman MOD etc. are just to name a few.\n\nNo game has had such longevity in its modding scene than Doom. 30 years strong and everything from unofficial extra episodes from original dev John Romero (SIGIL and SIGIL II) to complete games being released like Selaco and Hedon Bloodrite have been made from the modding community. Almost anyone who has dipped their toes in custom Doom maps knows of the Simpsons Doom, Lego Doom, and Barney Doom mods.\n\nModding has always been a part of gaming culture and it will always be, in some form or another. The Nexus, ModDB and recently Steam Workshop modding communities has produced some wonderful talent which sometimes makes game complete in a wonderful way (see the Unofficial Patches for most Bethesda games). Companies which encourage modding are always more popular with fans and a game which is moddable seems to be better built. Again a shoutout to Digital Extremes' Warframe for using modders' talents by letting players create ingame cosmetics which they can receive a part of sales from. Another good example are addons for MMOs, primarily World of Warcraft, where players are permitted to create ubiquitous addons such as DBM.\n\nLicensing and adaptation are ways that game developers can use existing intellectual property, such as books, movies, comics, or TV shows, to create games based on them. This can attract fans of the original source material, as well as introduce new audiences to the game medium. Some examples of games that have been successful in licensing or adapting intellectual property are The Witcher, Batman: Arkham, Spider-Man, and The Walking Dead.\n\nEach year more and more IP-based players figure in the top games of the year list, with the biggest studios taking big bets on them. In 2023 we saw great examples of that with Spider-Man 2 from Imsoniac/Playstation, and Star Wars: Jedi Survivor from EA to name a few. But why are Studios investing so much in these IPs? According to Video Game Insights, almost 40 games were published A DAY on steam only in 2023 (!). Building a game has never been easier, and that means competition is increasing significantly in the upcoming years. With more competitors out there wanting the player's attention, bringing well-known IPs that have a deep connection with their audience can be a game changer for the game to stand out in the crowd.\n\nLicensing can be a fantastic source of success, and deals can range from using a fictional universe like in Warhammer 40k Darktide (Games Workshop x Fatshark) to collaborations with toy companies like in Monopoly Go (Hasbro x Scopely) to licensing historical letters from the Imperial War Museum for your next WW2 game. But licensing always comes with challenges and constraints that many start-ups and aspiring studios are unaware of. In general, the greater the brand, the more complicated your project. To the ones interested in learning about licensing, I always recommend attending the Brand Licensing Europe Expo in London or if you can afford, the edition in Las Vegas.\n\nLicensed iPs in the gaming industry usually are mainly related to other entertainment categories, like comic books, sci fi, movies, fantasy or sport competitions. But what about real life stories? meaningful, deep and trespassing tales of the world we live in. What about amazing unknown heroes saving lives with his very hands? Are all the licensed characters taken by registered corporate trade marks? That's what makes video games a unique industry, and that's why I left behind 30 years of advertising career. I believe that in video games, stories can be told for real. Art can be expressed as its true nature, our pure humanity. And yes, make some cash with that is more than a satisfaction.\n\nCo-development and outsourcing are ways that game developers can collaborate with other studios or companies to share the workload, expertise, or resources for a game project. This can improve the quality, efficiency, or scope of the game, as well as reduce the risks or costs involved. Some examples of games that have been successful in co-development or outsourcing are Halo, Uncharted, Assassin's Creed, and Red Dead Redemption.\n\n1. Sony and Naughty Dog's partnership: This long-standing collaboration has produced some of the PlayStation's most acclaimed titles like Uncharted and The Last of Us, showcasing the success of combining in-house talent with external expertise. 2. Ubisoft's Massive Entertainment and Reflections: The co-development of Tom Clancy's The Division series combined Massive's open-world expertise with Reflections' shooter mechanics, resulting in a unique and commercially successful franchise.\n\nOutsourcing is omnipresent in the industry, no matter the size of the studio. It ranges from art creation to development, with localization and sound effects being the most commonly outsourced elements. Increasingly, with the growing number of remasters being released each year, publishers don’t hesitate to co-develop or actually outsource the entire development of a game to external companies. A prime example is the \"Command & Conquer Remastered Collection,\" developed by Petroglyph Games, which received widespread acclaim. Other recent notable collaborations include - Remedy and D3T for \"Alan Wake Remastered\" - Retro Studio with Iron Galaxy Studios for the \"Metroid Prime Remaster.\"\n\nOutsourcing in video game development, including blackbox and whitebox testing and game validation, offers significant opportunities. I recall an instance where my team identified a critical flaw in a major mobile game, overlooked by a renowned developer. This was not due to inadequate testing, but because of our distinct testing environment and strategies. This example illustrates outsourcing benefits like substantial cost savings, risk reduction, and avoiding potential losses post-release. Additionally, outsourcing mitigates overheads while expanding effective in-house team size, enabling studios to leverage external expertise without the complexities of direct employment.\n\nUnderstanding of the target audience is crucial; collaborations should appeal to both parties' existing fan bases, while attracting new players. Intellectual property alignment is another important consideration; the brands or franchises involved must complement each other to create a cohesive and engaging experience. Marketing strategy is also essential; a well-planned promotional campaign can generate excitement and anticipation, leading to a more successful launch. Technical compatibility is a must, ensuring that the collaborative effort runs smoothly across different platforms and systems. Additionally, maintaining the quality and integrity of each involved brand is vital. Finally, consider the long-term impact.\n\nPOWERUPS: What is the best/most common career to jump into the video game business scene? Finance, Software Engineer, Corporate, Sales..?maybe all, maybe none. From my perspective there‘s no such origin, only the discovery of how amazing can be the career you choose for life. Work for fun and fun to work. Life is too short to live it expecting to find the ideal scenario. It can be built day by day giving the best to your partners and see how it expand naturally along your days. The power ups are the chances you give to yourself to make a day better than yesterday."
