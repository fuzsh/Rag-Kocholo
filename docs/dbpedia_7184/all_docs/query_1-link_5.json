        "text": "Reporting in, Commanders,\n\nWelcome to the first of our new Meet the Team series, in which we will be introducing you to the development team responsible for creating The Great War: Western Front, Petroglyph. In this series, we will be sharing a closer look into the various teams at Petroglyph, so you can get a little more insight into the people behind The Great War: Western Front ahead of its 2023 release.\n\nIn this first post, we will be sharing a little more about who Petroglyph are as a company, as well as their impressive pedigree in the world of Real-Time Strategy (RTS) games. We hope you enjoy getting to know a little more about the studio.\n\nPetroglyph is an independent game development studio based in Las Vegas, USA, which was founded in 2003 by three developers from Westwood Studios: Joe Bostic, Michael Legg and Steve Tall, who between them have an astounding 100 years' worth of experience in the gaming industry, having worked on projects like Command & Conquer, Legend of Kyrandia, and Command & Conquer: Red Alert. Since then, Petroglyph has launched 17 games, and is now an award-winning developer best known for creating genre-defining RTS games.\n\nWith just over 20 developers with an average of over 10 years' gaming experience working at their Las Vegas studio, Petroglyph prides itself on making games they themselves want to play - and this translates clearly into the games they develop. They've also been known to step outside the box, and have produced a number of board games in-house, too; these include titles like Panzer General: Allied Assault, and Heroes of Graxia.\n\nThat just about marks the end of our first post in the Meet the Team series, but we hope you enjoyed your insight into Petroglyph as a studio, and that you are excited to join us and Petroglyph on this journey to launch The Great War: Western Front. Make sure to join us in coming weeks to learn more about the individuals working on The Great War: Western Front, and to follow us on Twitter or Facebook to get all the latest updates in the run up to our 2023 launch."
