        "text": "News video games 25 August 2022, 13:38\n\nauthor: Kamil Cuber\n\nCommand & Conquer Veterans Reveal World War I RTS\n\nDuring the Future Games Show at gamescom 2022, Petroglyph Games unveiled a new RTS, The Great War: Western Front.\n\nPetroglyph Games, which employs a number of industry veterans, best known for their work on the iconic Command & Conquer, series is developing an RTS set during the First World War, titled The Great War: Western Front. The game is to present the perspective of both sides of the conflict, and attention to historical accuracy will be ensured by cooperation with London's Imperial War Museum.\n\nThe gameplay in the new game is to be divided into two interdependent parts. The first will be dynamic clashes conducted in real time, which can be seen in the trailer above. In the second, however, the player will have the opportunity to take command of the entire frontline, and the fate of the war will depend on their decisions, such as the deployment of troops.\n\nThe Great War: Western Front will debut in 2023 on PC.\n\nThe destruction caused in combat will also be visible during the subsequent battles."
