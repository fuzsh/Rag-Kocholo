        "text": "Since 2006 Petroglyph has released many titles which have supported user-generated content (mods) either by creating new scripts, XML, or tying into existing code base. We frequently receive requests for help in understanding how certain function calls work, or how to access undocumented features within our engine. While we cannot give away source material for games that have been published by other entities, we can make available reference material related to our core engine (GlyphX) which we hope will be helpful in further development of UGC moving forward.\n\nThis is intended to be a one-shot release of our core Petroglyph documentation and we cannot accomodate suggestions or pull requests for changes to games that we have released years ago.\n\nWe hope this is helpful to you in the creation of your new work!\n\n-The Petroglyph Team"
