        "text": "In the 2019 IGDA Developer Satisfaction Survey, members of the digital game community were again asked which developer or publisher they would most like to work for. The question was asked to the 1116 respondents, 480 of whom responded with valid answers. In total, 151 unique responses were gathered, 94 of which were only selected by one person. Check out the full list below.\n\nNintendo came out on top with 10% of the vote (48 selections). They were followed by the considerable group of people who preferred to work for ‘my own studio’ with 31 votes (6.5%). Ubisoft took the 3rd spot with 29 votes (6%). Blizzard Entertainment was next with 25 votes (5%) and Naughty Dog and Sony tied for 5th (15 votes). For the first time, Valve Corporation was not in the top 5. But it was close. They were tied with Paradox Interactive for 6th place with 14 votes. Next came the three-way tie of Epic Games, CD Projekt Red and BioWare with 10 votes each. Combined with two votes for their parent Zeni Max Studios, Bethseda was 8th in a tie with Insomniac Games (9 votes). Rounding out the top ten were Square Enix (8 votes) and a tie between Double Fine Productions and Riot Games (7 votes).\n\nThis was a bit of a shake-up from previous years (see full posts below) with Valve losing its pinnacle position and dropping from the top 5. This was the first time Nintendo has topped the list, though they were in the top 5 in 2016. Blizzard, Ubisoft and Naughty Dog remained highly ranked. Epic Games, Square Enix and CD Projekt Red made gains.\n\nBethseda and Bioware dropped out of the top 5 but remain in the top 10. Riot and Double Fine also slipped but remain in the top 10.\n\nAs in previous years, for the purpose of this list different geographical studios for a company are compiled under the main parent company label (i.e., Ubisoft Montreal and Ubisoft Halifax both counted as Ubisoft).\n\nNot included in this list are the 5 people who said that they preferred to work for their current employer, the 6 people who said that they preferred to work for an independent studio and the person who said they wanted to work directly for American game director and script writer Amy Hennig.\n\nThis year the IGDA again asked which developer or publisher people in the game industry would most like to work for. The question was asked to 1186 respondents in the 2016 Developer Satisfaction Survey, 427 of whom responded with valid answers. In total, 123 unique responses were gathered, 68 of which were only mentioned once. You can find the complete list below.\n\nFor the third year in a row, Valve came out on top, with 12% of the vote (50 votes). They were followed closely by Blizzard Entertainment with 44 votes. BioWare and 'My own company' tied for 3rd spot with 23 votes each.\n\nEyeing the podium were Bethesda and Nintendo who tied for 4th with 18 votes, followed by Ubisoft (17 votes), Naughty Dog (16 votes), Riot Games (14 votes), and Double Fine Productions (10 votes).\n\nCompared to the previous lists (see full posts below), Valve, Blizzard, BioWare and 'my own company' have consistently maintained top 5 spots. Nintendo and Bethseda are new to the top 5 while Ubisoft returns after dropping out of the top 5 last year. Riot Games did not maintain its top 5 spot in 2016, but was a close 7th.\n\nAs in previous years, for the purpose of this list different geographical studios for a company are compiled under the main parent company label (Ubisoft Montreal and Ubisoft Halifax both counted as Ubisoft).\n\nNot included in the list below are the 5 people who said that they didn't want to work for any development studios or publishers, the 4 people who said they wanted to work at the current studio, and the person who wanted to work directly for Yasumi Matsuno.\n\nThis year the 2015 IGDA Developer Satisfaction Survey again asked which developer or publisher people in the game industry would most like to work for. The question was asked to 2928 respondents in the 2015 Developer Satisfaction Survey, 996 of whom responded with valid answers. In total, 170 unique responses were gathered, 96 of which were only mentioned once. You can find a complete list below.\n\nLast year, Valve came out on top, with just over 12% of respondents indicating that this is the company they would most like to work for. “My own company” came in close second with 11.8% of the vote. These responses were followed (not so closely) by Blizzard (5.3%), Bioware (4.5%) and Ubisoft (4.4%). The full report on this data can be found below.\n\nThis year the top five were similar — only one company was replaced — but there was some notable rank-shuffling. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Valve came out on top again this year, garnering 13.4% of the vote — that’s slightly over 1% more than last year. This count for Valve includes two respondents who said 'Steam' and one who named Gabe Newell. But this year professionals are less eager to work for themselves: only 4.7% of respondents indicated that they would most like to work for their own company. This is more than a 50% decrease in responses from last year, although the response did still make the top five, coming in at number five. Bioware again made the top five, ranking at number four with 5.3% of the vote. Ubisoft dropped to number 8 and was replaced by Riot Games (6.4%), which came in at number 3. This is almost a four-fold increase for Riot Games, who came in at number 13 last year with only 1.7% of respondents indicating they’d like to work there.\n\nActivision Blizzard again made the top five, coming in at number 2, but similar to last year, most respondents indicated that they would like to work specifically for Blizzard. In fact, of the 8.2% of respondents who mentioned Activision Blizzard, 92.5% said Blizzard as opposed to Activision Blizzard or Activision. When considered as separate entities, Blizzard ranks at number 2, and Activision and Activision Blizzard both received the same number of votes, ultimately ranking at number 26.\n\nSimilarly to the Activsion Blizzard conglomerate, if Take 2 is combined with Rockstar and the 2K Games family, they land in the 15th most chosen spot tied with Electronic Arts. Otherwise Rockstar is 18th, 2K Games is tied for 28th and Take 2 is tied for 29th.\n\nOften respondents specified a specific studio location – for instance Ubisoft Montreal or Rockstar San Diego. Though we recognize that different studios can have their own culture and practices, for the simplicity of this list, in all cases these were combined under the main parent company label.\n\nSome respondents didn’t mention a company name at all. Instead, they gave us some insight into what qualities they would like the company they work for to have:\n\n•“In the same state where my sweetheart lives”\n\n•“Studio location is more important at this stage in my life. There are lots of studios that appear good from the outside.”\n\n•“Small to middle-sized company”\n\nOther respondents (1.4%) said they are happy at their current employer but this data could be misleading and under-reported. Some respondents might have named the company they currently work for, but not indicated that they already work there. There were also respondents who indicated that they would work for any company (1.1%) and others indicated they’d rather not work in the game industry at all (1%). A few people (0.3%) weren’t sure who they would like to work for, but most respondents had a company in mind.\n\nA number of game-related news outlets just ran a story based on press release data from the IGDA about the most desirable employer in the video game industry.\n\nThe press release was based on data from the 2014 IGDA Developer Satisfaction Survey (DSS). The curators of gameqol.org have been extensively involved in the design, administration and analysis of this survey and can give you more detail…\n\nThe question “What developer/publisher would you most like to work for?” was asked to 2445 people and 1559 of them gave what we call a valid answer to the question – so something that was not leaving the field blank or putting in gobbledygook. Of those, 151 people wrote in answers that were not specific companies or employers. So people wrote things like:\n\nI would love to work for any company at this point. As long as I can do art, I'm happy.\n\nOne that pays well and is organizationally mature\n\nAny with a studio in a warm, southern location\n\nAny developer/publisher who truly valued my abilities.\n\nIn this group it is important to note that 37 people said they were 'not sure', 31 said ‘none’, 11 said ‘no preference’ and 24 said they wanted to work for an indie, any indie.\n\nSo that leaves 1408 people who actually listed a company name, or said ‘my own company’ or ‘my current employer’. Of these answers there were 204 employers listed, including ‘my own company’ and ‘my current employer’. This last one potentially muddies the data because some people might have listed the actual name of their current employer, but not indicated that it was their current employer. So... we’ll keep that category in here, but we need to interpret those numbers with care because they are likely higher than reported. Similarly some people could have listed a company other than their own thinking they had to make a different choice. Surveys can be a little tricky that way.\n\nYou can see the whole list at the bottom of this post. Of those 204 companies, 113 of them were mentioned by only one person.\n\nAs reported in the news, Valve comes out on top with 170 people ‘voting’ for it. This represents 12.07% of the valid sample of company responses. What is interesting and not apparent in the raw rankings is that “My own company” comes in at a very close second with 166 responses or 11.79% of the valid sample.\n\nIt is a quite a large step down from there to the third ranked company Blizzard which has 5.26% of the responses. Though the press release grouped Activision with Blizzard in the news report, game developers listed Blizzard and Activision separately. So many of you were right when you mused in your comments to the news pieces that it was the Blizzard component that put Activision Blizzard in the third ranked slot. On its own, Activision came in at number 18, representing 0.85% of the company responses sample. Added to Blizzard the percent is 6.11% and still 3rd place.\n\nAnother important piece of information that is similar to this Activision and Blizzard distinction is that many developers specified a particular studio or studio location when they listed large developer-publishers like EA, Rockstar, and Ubisoft. For the chart you see here and for the IGDA press release these were grouped together, but it is interesting and informative that developers make distinctions within these conglomerates. These distinctions could be based on a host of factors such as the games made at that particular studio, the particular management or working conditions or culture of particular studios, other ‘star’ developers who might be working there, or the geographical location. This is particularly noteworthy given the many mergers and acquisitions and the many spin-offs that occur in the game industry. Legacy seems to matter.\n\nFor those looking for their company, here’s the full list of 204 with number of responses and valid percent for each in addition to the raw ranking:\n\nWhat developer/publisher would you most like to work for?"
