        "text": "Fans of Porsche sports cars love to admire them, but opinions about engineer Ferdinand Porsche are divided in his hometown of Vratislavice in the Czech Republic.\n\nIn 2010, the city authorities opened a very modern museum dedicated to the \"father\" of the Volkswagen \"beetle\", one of the best-selling cars in the automotive industry.\n\nThe German group Porsche AG regularly furnished the museum with car models of the self-taught engineer Ferdinand Porsche (1875-1951).\n\nHowever, the new local authorities elected last year immediately resented the fact that the people of Vratislavice were celebrating Porsche, who worked for Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.\n\nVratislavice with 8.000 inhabitants has been inhabited by Germans since the Middle Ages, and was annexed to Czechoslovakia after the fall of Austria-Hungary.\n\nHitler then annexed them to Germany in 1938.\n\nThe new mayor of Wroclaw, Ales Presler, said that World War II veterans and the Jewish community resented the fact that the museum had no reference to Porsche's connection with Nazism.\n\nCheap family car for the masses: The famous \"bug\" (photo: Shutterstock)\n\nResidents resent Porsche for having prisoners of war working at its Volkswagen factory in the German city of Wolfsburg.\n\nThe city removed all welcome posters mentioning that it was Porsche's hometown and added a sign in the museum saying he was a Nazi.\n\nThe Porsche AG Group then withdrew all the cars it had made available to the museum. When Hitler came to power in 1933, he asked Porsche to design an inexpensive family car for the masses.\n\nThis is how the famous \"bug\" was born.\n\n\"Porsche was a Nazi and on good terms with Hitler. He used that relationship to get ahead,\" said historian Jan Weisskeber.\n\nToday, Porsche is one of the largest manufacturers of sports cars (photo: Shutterstock)\n\nHitler encouraged Porsche to renounce his Czechoslovak citizenship in 1935, four years before his country was occupied by Nazi Germany.\n\nPor≈°e was in prison for 22 months after the war, and died of a heart attack in 1951. He left his company to his son Ferdinand Feri, who started producing sports cars.\n\nHowever, some residents of Vratislavice respect Porsche's work.\n\n\"Porsche had no choice at the time. If he had refused Hitler, he would have certainly ended up in a concentration camp and would have achieved nothing,\" said Milan Bumba, a Porsche collector who has three cars on display in front of his cafe.\n\nSo far, Vratislavice has been visited by big collectors from Europe, the USA and New Zealand.\n\nGallery"
