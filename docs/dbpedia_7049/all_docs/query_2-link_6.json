        "text": "In October 2019, the Austrian parliament unanimously adopted an amendment to the Austrian Citizenship Act (“Staatsbürgerschaftsgesetz/StbG”) in recognition of its historical responsibility towards persons persecuted by National Socialism and their descendants. Since the implementation of this provision revealed cases that were outside the scope of the original format of the law, Parliament made the necessary legal amendments in April 2022 in order to expand the acquisition of citizenship to a broader group of people in accordance with the fundamental principles of Austrian citizenship law. The extended provision of § 58c StbG came into force on May 1, 2022.\n\nPersecuted persons within the scope of the Austrian Citizenship Act are:\n\nPersons who went abroad as Austrian citizens, citizens of one of the successor states of the former Austro-Hungarian monarchy or as stateless persons with their main place of residence in the federal territory of Austria before May 15, 1955 because they feared or suffered persecution. This also includes those who lost their Austrian citizenship shortly before they left the country because they acquired a foreign citizenship through marriage.\n\nPersons who were Austrian citizens and did not have their main place of residence in Austria between January 30, 1933 and May 9, 1945 because they would have feared persecution if they returned to or entered Austria for the first time (“prevented return”).\n\nPersons who, as Austrian citizens, died due to persecution or were deported abroad before May 9, 1945.\n\nPersons who, as nationals of one of the successor states of the former Austro-Hungarian monarchy or as stateless persons with their main place of residence in the federal territory of Austria, died due to persecution or were deported abroad before May 9, 1945.\n\nIn addition to those persons who feared or suffered persecution by organs of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP) or of the authorities of the German Reich, persecuted persons also include those who were subject to persecution or had to fear such persecution for defending the democratic Republic of Austria (hereinafter referred to as: persecuted ancestor regardless of gender or identity).\n\nIt is to be understood that the federal territory of the Republic of Austria, in this case, refers to the current day borders of the Austrian Republic. All territories outside of the federal territory of the Republic of Austria, are considered to be “abroad”.\n\nAccording to § 58c of the Austrian Citizenship Act persecuted persons and their descendants can acquire Austrian citizenship by means of a declaration (“Anzeige”), without having to give up their current citizenship or nationality in return.\n\nPlease note, however, that the law in some countries provides for the automatic loss of its citizenship or nationality through the subsequent acquisition of another citizenship. In case of doubt, please check with the competent authority of your home country.\n\nAs a descendant, it is not possible to file a declaration if you had already possessed Austrian citizenship and lost it after 1 May 2022 through the acquisition of a foreign citizenship, unless the possession of your Austrian citizenship was not known to you. Also, in cases of renunciation or revocation of your Austrian citizenship, a subsequent declaration is not possible.\n\nIf you are a persecuted person yourself, we would ask you to directly contact your local Austrian diplomatic representation (Austrian Embassy or Consulate General) and arrange the further procedure in an individual consultation.\n\nFor descendants of persecuted persons, further information on the declaration process pursuant to § 58c StbG 1985 and the documents required for this are provided in the navigation menu to the left.\n\nYour local Austrian diplomatic representation (Austrian Embassy or Consulate General) will be glad to provide you with the best possible support and advice when filing your declaration abroad. You do not need to engage a lawyer in order to file your declaration or to provide assistance in the procedure. However, if you choose to employ a lawyer, please keep in mind that lawyer’s fees have to be paid by yourself.\n\nTherefore, your local Austrian diplomatic representation offers this information about the procedure and the necessary supporting documentation. The online questionnaire will provide you with an initial, individualized orientation regarding your case.\n\nThe online questionnaire is available on the homepage of your local Austrian diplomatic representation in German, English, Spanish and Hebrew language versions.\n\nThose who have already completed the online questionnaire before the amendment in April 2022 do not have to fill it out again, but are free to do so at any time (i.e. to receive a new/updated declaration form).\n\nFurther information can be found under \"The online questionnaire\"."
