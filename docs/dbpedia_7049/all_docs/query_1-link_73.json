        "text": "To most people, the name Porsche is given to a bunch of cars they can’t buy, and which many people associate with 1980’s douchebags with mullets.\n\nTo be fair, Porsches often WERE driven by dudes with questionable looks in the 80s, but to be equally fair, almost everyone in that decade had hair problems.\n\nEven with these caveats, the August 1974 issue of Road & Track might be an eye-opened to many. The cover photo indicated that the editors of the magazine thought that the two smaller models from Ford were the big news, but I see little evidence today that they were anything but a desperate attempt to grab market share. They might have sold well in the day (no clue, I’m not interested in that kind of car), but were completely irrelevant in the larger scheme of things.\n\nNot so Porsche, and any knowledgeable person will immediately realize that this is a Porsche-dominated issue.\n\nFirst, the obvious. There’s a celebration of 25 years of the Porsche company, speaking of the road and competition cars. Remember, in the early 1970s, Porsche was involved in all sorts of sports car racing, from Prototypes to GTs to Silhouettes to Can Am. The 917 was just behind them and the 935 and 936 were just around the corner. Glory years past and future.\n\nBut that’s just the obvious. The big news for everyone else, in fat the most important article in the magazine when it comes to the general public was the launch of a little car called the Volkswagen Golf (referred to as the Rabbit in the US for some unfathomable reason).\n\nThough the editors of R&T wondered whether it would fail to replace the Beetle in the way that so many other VW cars already had, we now know that it not only replaced the beetle, but it set a foundation for a much more dominant VW company today… and the model, much evolved is still going strong nearly 50 years later.\n\nBut what about Porsche? Well, Dr. Ferdinand Porsche designed the original Volkswagen for the German government in the 1930s. It might not have been the greatest government to work for, but fortunately, engineering is not affected by ideology and the Beetle was produced all the way into the 21st century.\n\nThe company founded on that design is the Volkswagen we know and love today. We owe it to Porsche.\n\nFinally, looking at the competition pages, you need to understand that every pure race car in the issue (interestingly, not the rear-engined Porshe 356 and 911 derivatives, though) is a mid-engined design.\n\nThe first significant mid-engine racers on the world stage were the Auto Union silver arrows from the 1930s. So who designed those?\n\nGlad you asked: it was Dr. Ferdinand Porsche (not to be confused with his son Ferdinand (Ferry) or his grandson Ferdinand (Butzi) who also contributed greatly to automotive history, but whose stories will have to wait for another day).\n\nSo you can ignore the two pieces of Detroit iron on the cover. This was a Porsche tribute edition."
