        "text": "IMPERIAL AND ROYAL\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian Empire was formed in 1867 and lasted until 1918. The separate states of Austria and Hungary were united under one monarch in a military and diplomatic alliance.\n\nAt the time, Austria-Hungary was the second largest country in Europe in area and the third largest in population. Its two capitals were Vienna and Budapest. Although the area was considered one country, people could only be a citizen of Austria or Hungary; it did not allow for dual citizenship. In fact, 13 different nationalities and ethnic groups made up its citizens. Many of those nationalities have currently been restored as their own country, like Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia.\n\nAustria-Hungary was the first country to declare war in what became World War I. It fought as one of the Central Powers and was closely aligned with Germany. At the end of World War 1, the empire was divided into the Republic of Austria and the Hungarian Democratic Republic, eventually the Kingdom of Hungary.\n\nHere is Cramâ€™s map of the Empire from 1883."
