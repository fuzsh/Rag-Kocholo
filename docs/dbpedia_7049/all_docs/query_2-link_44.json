        "text": "The circle of those entitled to Austrian citizenship increased significantly in 2019 with an amendment to the law passed by the Austrian Parliament, granting eligibility to those persecuted by the Nazi regime. In addition, in 2022 the parliament made additional changes to the law, which increased the circle of those entitled to Austrian citizenship who were not included in it according to the 2019 amendment.\n\nSince the expansion of the circle of eligibility for Austrian citizenship, the number of applicants for Austrian citizenship has increased significantly, and includes the descendants of those who are eligible many generations ahead (including great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren). To find out if you and your family are included in the broad circle of those entitled to Austrian citizenship, contact the Tal Ophir law office, which specializes in issuing Austrian citizenship to the descendants of those persecuted by the Nazi regime.\n\nIn this article we will list the main points and answer common questions that arise among our customers regarding Austrian citizenship and an Austrian passport.\n\nView in Hallstadt, Austria. Photo: Depositphotos\n\nEligibility for Austrian citizenship\n\nAccording to the Austrian citizenship law, you are entitled to Austrian citizenship if you are a descendant of (or are yourself):\n\n* People who left Austria as Austrian citizens before 15.5.1955.\n\n* People who left Austria before 15.5.1955 as citizens of one of the Austro-Hungarian countries (for example: Hungary, certain areas that are currently in Romania, the Czech Republic, Poland and Ukraine, etc.).\n\n* Stateless persons whose main place of residence was in the federal territory of Austria before 15.5.1955.\n\n* People who were Austrian citizens and their place of residence was outside the federal territory of Austria between 30.1.1933 and 9.5.1945 because they feared persecution if they returned to the federal territory of Austria.\n\n* People who were Austrian citizens and died before 9.5.1945 due to the persecution of the Nazi regime or who were deported abroad.\n\n* People who died before 9.5.1945 as citizens of one of the states of the Kingdom of Austria-Hungary or as members of citizenship and their main place of residence was in the federal territory of Austria or they were deported abroad.\n\nLet’s take an example to clarify how far the law has been extended. If you are the great-grandson of a person who was a Hungarian citizen and whose place of residence before the Nazis came to power was in Vienna, you are entitled to Austrian citizenship.\n\nEligibility check for Austrian citizenship\n\nTo check whether you are entitled to Austrian citizenship, and if so by virtue of which section, it is important to conduct an archival examination. The archival examination is carried out in order to find documents that establish your right to Austrian citizenship, such as proof that your grandfather or grandmother lived in Vienna. When your application for citizenship is sent to the Austrian Citizenship Department, the documents proving eligibility must also be sent.\n\nIt is possible that you already have documents proving eligibility for Austrian citizenship according to one of the conditions mentioned above. But you should make sure that you do have all the required documents, so it is advisable to have a lawyer specializing in the field review the documents to make sure that your application for Austrian citizenship will indeed be successfully accepted and that you are not missing any documents.\n\nArchival check for Austrian citizenship.

For example, if you are a citizen of Israel and you become a citizen of Austria, you can continue to hold the Israeli right at the same time as the Austrian citizenship.\n\nBut it is important to note that if after receiving the Austrian citizenship you wish to receive the citizenship of another country, you will have to give up the Austrian citizenship. Although you can apply to maintain your Austrian citizenship before applying for another citizenship, the final decision regarding approval of the application rests with the Austrian authorities. It should be taken into account that the application to maintain Austrian citizenship is not automatically approved.\n\nThere is no problem in obtaining Austrian citizenship and an Austrian passport if you serve in compulsory (regular) military service, or in the reserves. But if you volunteer for permanent service, you will not be able to get Austrian citizenship, and your Austrian citizenship will even be revoked. The reason is that military service that exceeds mandatory service may harm the interests of Austria.\n\nIn terms of other countries, it is necessary to find out if it will be a problem to get another citizenship. In Israel, for example, there is no problem for Israeli citizens to obtain an additional citizenship, as is the case in the United States and the United Kingdom. But there are countries where you will have to give up your citizenship in order to obtain Austrian citizenship. We recommend that you consult the authorities in the relevant country in order to obtain the most accurate and up-to-date information.\n\nDual citizenship.

Upon receiving Austrian citizenship, you must make an appointment at the Austrian embassy to apply for a passport. It is important to note that every holder of Austrian citizenship is entitled to an Austrian passport.\n\nApplication for an Austrian passport: signing documents.

As someone who understands how valuable your time is to you, we save you all the bureaucracy and keep you updated all the way until you receive the Austrian passport."
