        "text": "Let the confusion begin\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian Empire can be really confusing.\n\nLet’s say your ancestor, born in 1905, referred to themselves as Austrian - even on official documents - and the family story has always been that they were indeed Austrian.\n\nThen, on starting your family tree - you discover that they were born in Trieste, Italy.\n\nSo, were they Austrian or Italian? Where should you be searching for records, Austria or Italy?\n\nAustro-Hungarian Monarchy\n\nÖsterreichisch-Ungarische Monarchie / k.u.k Monarchie\n\nOsztrák–Magyar Monarchia\n\nWhy say you were Austrian, when you kind of weren’t?\n\nWell they kind of were Austrian.\n\nIt was common to label yourself ‘Austrian’ when in reality - they were referring to theentire Empire. In simple terms - where they lived was located in an ‘Austrian part’ of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.\n\nFor example, your ancestor’s:\n\nDocuments and records show them as Austrian but at the time it was Slovenia.\n\nDocuments and records show them as Austrian but at the time it was current-day Italy.\n\nNationality on documents\n\nNationality may have been recorded as: Austrian or Austro-Hungarian or Hungarian.\n\nTake note: As the Austro-Hungarian Empire dissolved, the records remained in the new country and that’s where you need to be researching."
