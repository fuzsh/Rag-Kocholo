        "text": "A procedure pursuant to § 58c of the Austrian Citizenship Act starts by filing a declaration (“Anzeige”). All direct descendants of a persecuted ancestor, i.e. children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren… are eligible. Children who were adopted as minors are also regarded as direct descendants.\n\nThis declaration can be filed at your local Austrian diplomatic representation (Austrian Embassy or Consulate General) by submitting a declaration form and the necessary documentation.\n\nYour local Austrian diplomatic representation will be glad to provide you with the best possible support and advice when filing your declaration abroad. You do not need to engage a lawyer in order to file your declaration or to provide assistance in the further procedure. However, if you choose to employ a lawyer, please keep in mind that lawyer’s fees have to be paid by yourself.\n\nPlease note: According to the Austrian Citizenship Act, the Austrian diplomatic representation in the consular district where you have your main residence is responsible for your case. Before you continue, please make sure that you open the link to the online questionnaire only from the website of this particular Austrian diplomatic representation, as no other local representation can support you in submitting your declaration nor accept it. A list of the consular districts of the Austrian diplomatic representations (Austrian Embassies and Consulates) can be found here.\n\nThe competent authority for persons not born or not residing in Austria is the “Wiener Landesregierung” (Vienna Provincial Government), specifically “Magistratsabteilung/MA35” (Municipal Department 35). However, the declaration can be filed at your Austrian diplomatic representation, which will then forward the declaration form and the enclosed documents to MA35.\n\nPursuant to § 58c of the Austrian Citizenship Act, the documents listed below (either in German or English, or in German translation by a sworn and judicially certified translator) have to be submitted together with the completed declaration form.\n\nYour personal documents:\n\nvalid passport\n\ncurrent passport photograph\n\nyour birth certificate\n\ndocuments regarding your marital status, in case your last name has changed (marriage certificate, and - if applicable - a name declaration are required)\n\ncurrent criminal record certificate from your country of residence (not older than 8 months).\n\nForeign original documents require either a diplomatic authentication or an apostille, unless an authentication waiver is in effect (more information on this subject can be found in the authentication - section of the website of the Austrian diplomatic representation in the country that issued the document).\n\nDocuments concerning your persecuted ancestor:\n\nBy legal definition in accordance with § 58c StbG, persecuted ancestors are considered to be:\n\nPersons who went abroad as Austrian citizens, nationals of one of the successor states of the former Austro-Hungarian monarchy, or as stateless persons with their main place of residence in the federal territory of Austria before May 15, 1955, as well as persons who lost their Austria citizenship shortly before they left Austria through marriage to a foreign citizen, because:\n\nthey had reason to fear or suffered from persecution by organs of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP) or of the authorities of the German Reich, or\n\nthey were subject to persecution or had to fear such persecution for defending the democratic Republic of Austria,\n\nPersons who were Austrian citizens and, between January 30, 1933 and May 9, 1945, did not have a main place of residence within the federal territory of Austria because they would have feared persecution by organs of the NSDAP or of the authorities of the German Reich, or because of their defending the democratic Republic of Austria, if they returned to or entered Austria for the first time to establish a main residence,\n\nPersons who, as Austrian citizens, were deported abroad before May 9, 1945 by organs of the NSDAP or of the authorities of the German Reich, or because of their defending the democratic Republic of Austria,\n\nPersons who, as nationals of one of the successor states of the former Austro-Hungarian Monarchy or as stateless persons with their main residence within the federal territory of Austria before May 9, 1945 were deported abroad by organs of the NSDAP or of the authorities of the German Reich, or because of their defending the democratic Republic of Austria,\n\nPersons who died as Austrian citizens due to persecution by organs of the NSDAP or of the authorities of the German Reich, or because of their defending the democratic Republic of Austria, before May 9, 1945 in Austria or abroad,\n\nPersons who died as nationals of one of the successor states of the former Austro-Hungarian monarchy or as stateless persons with their main place of residence within Austria before May 9, 1945 in Austria or abroad due to persecution by organs of the NSDAP or of the authorities of the German Reich, or because of their defending the democratic Republic of Austria.\n\nIt is therefore necessary to enclose the following documents concerning\n\nevidence of former possession of either Austrian citizenship or of the citizenship of a successor state of the former Austro-Hungarian Monarchy of your persecuted ancestor or evidence of their statelessness,\n\nprincipal residence in Austria (or possibly abroad between January 30, 1933 and May 9, 1945),\n\nthe persecution by organs of the NSDAP or of authorities of the German Reich your persecuted ancestor had reason to fear or suffered from or the persecution he/she was subject to or had reason to fear for defending the democratic Republic of Austria,\n\n(if applicable) leaving Austria before May 15, 1955\n\n(if applicable) the marriage through which your ancestor lost their Austrian citizenship.\n\nIn principle, no documents would be required if your ancestor was deported abroad or died due to persecution.\n\nIn addition, you will be asked to provide all documents and records available establishing your direct relationship with the persecuted ancestor. These documents include in particular birth certificates, marriage certificates, acknowledgement of paternity or judicial declaration of paternity in case of birth out of wedlock or, where applicable, adoption certificates. If applicable, also all documents concerning any name change are required.\n\nAs circumstances and conditions differ from person to person and family to family, it may not be immediately obvious which of the documents and certificates mentioned are necessary in your individual case. The Austrian Federal Ministry for European and International Affairs has, therefore, developed an online questionnaire in consultation with MA35.\n\nThe questionnaire will give you an orientation which documents must be submitted in your case or which documents exist in files and archival holdings of the Republic of Austria or other Austrian institutions such as the National Fund of the Republic of Austria for Victims of National Socialism (“Nationalfonds der Republik Österreich für die Opfer des Nationalsozialismus”) or the General Settlement Fund for Victims of National Socialism (“Allgemeiner Entschädigungsfonds für die Opfer des Nationalsozialismus”) and therefore do not need to be submitted. It also allows the competent Austrian diplomatic representation to provide you with targeted advice and support."
