        "text": "Austria is one of Europe’s wealthiest countries, offering a very high quality of life to its people and visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to approximately 190 destinations worldwide. Austrian citizenship is highly coveted, and as a citizen of Austria, you can live and work in the country and anywhere else in the EU and Switzerland at any time.\n\nThe Austrian government is particularly restrictive in conferring citizenship to foreign nationals. The government only grants citizenship to foreign nationals in the following cases:\n\nCitizenship by descent\n\nCitizenship under special conditions such as by merit or through investment\n\n§ 58 (c) of the Austrian Citizenship Act, amended in September 2020 and May 2022, addresses Austria’s historic responsibility for its part in the heinous acts committed during the Nazi regime. The government provides reparations to persons persecuted by this regime and to their descendants by allowing them to apply for Austrian citizenship by descent.\n\nWhen you acquire citizenship under the Austrian Citizenship Act, you enjoy full citizenship for life, which can be passed on to future generations by descent.\n\nRequirements of Austrian citizenship for descendants of Nazi victims\n\nConditions for descendants\n\nAll direct descendants (as well as those adopted as minors) of a formerly persecuted ancestor are eligible to apply for Austrian citizenship:\n\nChildren\n\nGrandchildren\n\nGreat-grandchildren\n\nAnd even further generations\n\nConditions for ancestors\n\nApplicants may apply for Austrian citizenship by descent if one of the following cases applies to the relevant ancestor. (In each of these cases, ancestors are not required to have reclaimed or regained their Austrian citizenship.)\n\nCase 1:\n\nAn ancestor who was either:\n\nAn Austrian citizen\n\nA citizen of one of the successor states of the former Austro–Hungarian monarchy (particularly, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes)\n\nA stateless person\n\nA person who lost Austrian citizenship when they acquired a foreign citizenship through marriage around the time of their departure from Austria\n\nAnd who primarily resided in Austria before 15 May 1955 and left the country because they suffered, or had reason to fear, persecution by the Nazi regime, including persecution for their support of the emocratic Republic of Austria. Persecutors include, for example, the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (National Socialist German Workers’ Party) and the authorities of the German Reich.\n\nCase 2:\n\nAn ancestor who was an Austrian citizen but did not primarily reside in Austria between 30 January 1933 and 9 May 1945 for fear of persecution by the Nazi regime or because of their support for the Republic of Austria.\n\nCase 3:\n\nAn ancestor who was an Austrian citizen either deported from Austria by the Nazi regime before 9 May 1945 or killed by the regime (including being killed for their support of the Republic of Austria). In this case, killing and murder does not only mean active killing but also death as a result of being denied or failing to be provided with medical care and sufficient food or due to injuries that arose from torture.\n\nCase 4:\n\nAn ancestor who:\n\nWas either a stateless person or a citizen of one of the successor states of the former Austro–Hungarian monarchy (particularly, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes)\n\nPrimarily resided in Austria before 9 May 1945\n\nWas either deported from Austria by the Nazi regime or killed by the regime (including being killed for their support of the Republic of Austria) either as a result of active killing or death by being denied or failing to be provided with medical care and sufficient food or due to injuries that arose from torture.\n\nDocuments required for descendants of a Nazi victim\n\nApplicants must file an Anzeige (declaration) along with mandatory apostilled supporting documents.\n\nThe Austrian provincial government requires applicants who wish to apply for citizenship by ancestry to submit the following documents:\n\nCurrent passport\n\nCurrent passport photograph (not older than six months), complying with the Austrian photograph criteria\n\nBirth certificate\n\nMarriage and divorce certificate, if applicable, in case the original surname was changed\n\nCertificate of change of name, if applicable\n\nCriminal record from the country of residence, not older than eight months (for US residents, this document must be issued by the FBI)\n\nDocuments required for the persecuted ancestor\n\nEach application is case-by-case dependent, but these are the usual documents that are required by the applicant on behalf of their ancestor:\n\nBirth certificate (if available)\n\nMarriage certificate (if available)\n\nDeath certificate\n\nEvidence that the ancestor was persecuted (if available). The birth certificate is usually sufficient evidence for Jewish persons\n\nEvidence that the persecuted ancestor was residing in Austria (in case they were a citizen of one of the successor states of the Austro–Hungarian monarchy)\n\nIn case of flight: Evidence that the ancestor fled from Austria (for example, passenger lists)\n\nIn case of deportation: Evidence that the ancestor was deported by the Nazi regime\n\nIn case the ancestor was killed by the Nazi regime: Death certificate or other evidence\n\nProcedures and time frame of Austrian citizenship for descendants of Nazi victims\n\nAll applications for Austrian citizenship by ancestry can be lodged at a local Austrian embassy or consulate general. However, we recommend submitting your application at the relevant authority in Vienna, Austria.\n\nApplicants are advised to read all the requirements carefully before submitting their application. Thereafter, they will need to complete a client intake form to check for eligibility.\n\nSince the law has recently been amended, contact us even if your application has been rejected in the past.\n\nHenley & Partners can seamlessly manage the entire citizenship by descent application process for you, from helping you prove your lineage and your ancestors’ experience under the Nazi regime by checking various institutions and archives, to assisting with legalizing and apostilling documents, to liaising with the relevant authorities, to you receiving your Austrian passport in hand.\n\nThe process for acquiring Austrian citizenship through descent takes four to six months."
