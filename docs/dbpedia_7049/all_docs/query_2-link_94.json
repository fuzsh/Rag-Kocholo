        "text": "Top Image: Soviet soldiers taking down a Nazi sign in Austria. Image courtesy of Voennyi Albom (a Russian-language website) and Sputnik News.\n\nNazi Germany annexed Austria in 1938, with the overwhelming support of the Austrian population. Even figures such as Karl Renner, an Austrian socialist politician who was the provisional prime minister of the first post-Nazi government appointed by Joseph Stalin, welcomed the Anschluss. Thereafter, Austria was an integral part of the Third Reich, with 700,000 people, or 10 percent of the population, joining the Nazi Party. The Wehrmacht drafted more than 1.3 million Austrians between 1938 and 1945, 242,000 of whom never came back home. Austrians also served loyally as soldiers from Germany proper and were just as responsible for Nazi atrocities on the Eastern Front.\n\nThe story of the Red Army’s occupation of Austria begins in June 1941, when Hitler’s regime launched a genocidal war against the Soviet Union. The aim of Operation Barbarossa was not only to eliminate the Soviet Union as a potential military threat but also to starve and enslave the European population of the country and turn it into a German colony. The Soviet Union lost 26.6 million people during the war, with most credible estimates for military losses ranging between 11.4 and 14.6 million.\n\nAfter almost four years of brutal combat, the troops from the 3rd and 2nd Ukrainian Fronts, the two army groups at the southern end of the Soviet-German frontline, approached Austria’s border from Hungary in the winter of 1945. The fighting in Hungary was some of the most brutal of the war, as the two Red Army groups, numbering around 1 million troops at the time, suffered 484,300 losses, including 140,000 killed or captured. As they were regrouping to invade Austria, the Germans launched their last major offensive of the war at Lake Balaton in March of 1945, which was aimed at stopping the Soviet march into the Third Reich. After the 3rd Ukrainian Front absorbed the attack, it launched a counterattack that developed into the Vienna Strategic Offensive Operation, resulting in the elimination of the bulk of German forces in the south and the capture of the Austrian capital. After the Soviet troops took Vienna, they advanced towards Linz and Graz in early May. Skirmishes between the Red Army and the German soldiers, who desperately sought to surrender to the Western Allies and avoid falling into Soviet captivity, lasted into late May, well after the fighting ceased elsewhere in Europe. The Red Army suffered 94,185 casualties in Austria, 26,006 killed and 68,179 wounded.\n\nSoviet occupation policies in Austria were to a large extent shaped by the Moscow Declaration of 1943, in which the British, Americans, and Soviets proclaimed that Austria was Germany’s first victim, but that it would also have to pay the price for its participation in Nazi aggression. In the long run, the Declaration meant that Austria would emerge as an independent state. The Red Army occupied only parts of Austria, including the capital, while the Anglo-American troops entered from Germany and Italy. Thereafter, France, Great Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union divided Austria into four occupation zones, much like they did in Germany.\n\nAlthough Moscow treated Austria as a defeated Axis power, it adhered to the general line that Austria was a victim of Germany. Therefore, Austria avoided some of the worst aspects of Germany’s fate. It did not lose any territory, despite Yugoslavia’s claims to Carinthia, a province in the south of the country. Austrians also avoided the fate of the Volksdeutsche, ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe who were expelled to Germany or rounded up and deported to the Soviet Union for slave labor. Likewise, Austrians did not become victims of ethnic cleansing, like Germans from the Third Reich’s territories incorporated into Poland and the Soviet Union. The Western Allies also successfully opposed the Kremlin’s plans to impose burdensome war reparations on Austria that Germany, Romania, and Hungary had to pay.\n\nHowever, the Western Allies consented to Moscow’s demand that the Soviets should be entitled to German assets in Austria in their zone of occupation. Moscow considered German property to be all property that at the end of the war had German owners or investors. As a result, according to historian Günter Bischof, Austria ended up paying more than five times what Stalin originally demanded. In Austria, as in other “enemy” countries, local governments were obliged to feed and clothe the Red Army, which, given the number of troops, was an enormous burden on the war-ravaged countries.\n\nMoscow deployed NKVD (Soviet secret police) teams of professional looters to extract reparations through requisitions: the NKVD teams seized industrial plants and production installations while confiscating goods in the quantity of 31,200 freight cars. In June 1946, 30 percent of the national budget went into covering the occupation costs. Historian Walter Iber estimated that in total Austria paid the Soviet Union 36.8 billion Schillings, or two percent of the accumulated GDP, from 1946 to 1955.\n\nThe fact that Moscow did not plan or try to impose a communist dictatorship in Austria meant that the scale of political violence experienced by Austrians was more limited than in other countries occupied by the Red Army. According to the research of Harold Knoll and Barbara Stelzl-Marx, in 1945, or the initial eight months of occupation, Soviet military tribunals arrested around 800 Austrian civilians. For 400 of them, the charges are known: 191 were charged with belonging to the Nazi Werewolf resistance group, 61 with espionage, 55 of maltreatment of Soviet POWs and slave laborers, 31 of weapons possession, 22 of war crimes, 24 with violent acts, 11 for selling bad alcohol to Soviet troops, four with criminal activities, and one for being a former Soviet citizen. By 1955, when the Red Army pulled out of the country, the Soviets had arrested 2,400 Austrians, 1,250 of whom were prosecuted for everything from war crimes to everyday criminal activity. Some 150 were executed, while others received lengthy prison terms.\n\nBy the standards of the Soviet justice system, and given the significant Austrian contribution to Nazi war crimes, the Soviet repressive apparatus in the first months of occupation acted with considerable restraint. This restraint can be partly explained by the fact that Moscow did not fully control Austria and partly because Austria was far from the Soviet Union’s frontiers. Consequently, it did not rank high on Moscow’s list of geopolitical priorities. It was far more important for the Kremlin to have a friendly and preferably communist regime in a neighboring country, such as Romania or Poland, whose adjoining territory made it a potential military threat to the Soviet Union. In these countries, the Soviet terror was worse.\n\nThroughout the war, the Soviet leadership sustained the army’s morale through vicious anti-German hate propaganda, which given the Axis genocidal conduct in the Soviet Union, resonated powerfully with the rank and file. The anti-German indoctrination campaign fueled atrocities against civilians. As they closed in on the Third Reich, the Soviet soldiers committed hundreds of thousands of sexual assaults, robberies, and murders. By April 1945, with the fall of the Third Reich imminent, the Soviet leaders began thinking about the post-war period where they would have to govern the newly conquered territories, and thus require at least some support from the defeated Germans.\n\nSuddenly, the tone and message of Soviet propaganda abruptly changed. The hate campaign did not completely go away, but the most vehement anti-German propagandists, such as the widely popular military journalist Il’ia Ehrenburg, were criticized in the Soviet civilian and military press for “going too far.” Soviet propaganda also began to emphasize that the ordinary Germans (and Austrians) were not responsible for the Nazi crimes.The change in propaganda tone was aimed at differentiating ordinary Germans from the Nazis, to encourage Soviet soldiers to treat civilians more correctly.\n\nSoviet commanders in the field issued orders to troops to discourage criminal conduct as soon they entered Austria. On April 4, the command issued an instruction that was read to all of the frontline soldiers. The instruction proclaimed that Austria was Hitler’s first victim and that the Red Army entered the country to liberate it and destroy German forces. It stated that Nazi propaganda for years had frightened the Austrians with tales of the Soviet soldiers committing atrocities. Calling Nazi propaganda a lie, the instruction went on to appeal to troops not to conflate Austrian civilians with German occupiers. The document ended with:\n\n“Be merciless towards German enslavers, but don’t offend the Austrian population. Respect their traditions, families, and private property. Proudly carry the glorious title of a Red Army warrior…let your conduct cause respect everywhere for the Red Army.”\n\nThe instruction clearly tried to create a sympathetic image of Austria amongst the rank and file, while the appeal to respect families and properties directly urged the soldiers to refrain from committing sexual assaults and looting. It is difficult to imagine more positive pro-Austrian propaganda, as it embraced the doubtful claim about Austria being Germany’s first victim to persuade soldiers that Austrians should be treated humanely.\n\nThe rank and file tended to view with complete disbelief the new line that Austrians were not Germans, and that not all Germans were villains but just the Nazis. Vladimir Arkhipov, a signaller in the 3rd Ukrainian Front, sent his family a letter on March 19, 1945 that illuminated the prevailing mood of Soviet soldiers on the eve of their entry into Austria. After a long battle during which the Soviets stopped the Germans at Lake Balaton, he wrote that he had been listening to music on Radio Moscow with his friend Stepan. Arkhipov related that Stepan, before falling asleep, wondered when they would finally destroy the so-called German filth so that they could go back home and listen to a live orchestra, without being interrupted by explosions.\n\nTwo days earlier, Arkhipov reported, Stepan had received a letter from home informing him that his father and two cousins had been murdered by the Germans, his wife forced into slave labor in Germany, and his younger brother beaten so badly that he was still unwell. Arkhipov felt his friend’s pain. He asked his parents: “Can we really forgive the [German] scum for the villainy they inflicted?” He answered his question: “No, we will not forgive them. We will get to them as well. Thousands [of soldiers] like Stepan will exact revenge. There will be a holiday on our street!”\n\nSoviet troops understood their arrival into the Third Reich as their victory and the time to inflict their own justice. This is what Arkhipov had in mind when he wrote that there would be a holiday in the streets. In the words of Boris Slutskii, a major in the 3rd Ukrainian Front who went on to have a distinguished literary career after the war, “In Styria [an Austrian province], justice reigned, and every soldier felt himself to be its executor and guardian.”"
