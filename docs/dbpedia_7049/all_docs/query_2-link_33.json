        "text": "The Austrian Citizenship Law allows Victims of the Holocaust and their direct descendants to apply for Austrian citizenship.\n\nThe latest Austria Citizenship Law amendment, which came into force on the 1st of September 2020, has now extended its law to include an additional ten years in history. The Law now states that eligibility for acquiring Austrian Citizenship is extended to victims’ descendants if their direct ancestors had fled Austria before 1955 (previously before May 1945). Dependents include son, daughter, grandson, granddaughter, great-grandson, great-granddaughter, etc.\n\nThis Law has been effectively approved and enacted as part of Austria’s route in taking action to recognize the country’s responsibility in history. Additionally, the country is taking initiative for reconcilement and showing respect to Holocaust survivors and their descendants who suffered under, and due to, the Nazi rule in Austria.\n\nOur Guidance & Assistance\n\nThrough our dedicated experience in the field and building our dependable network over the years, we are confident in our abilities to successfully guide and support you through Citizenship and Residency programs.\n\nCitizen Lane respects every client’s unique situation and will be able to discuss details in confidence.
