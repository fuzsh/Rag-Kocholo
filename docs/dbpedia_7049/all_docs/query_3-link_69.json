        "text": "Gon fix it with me hammer\n\nJoin Date: Sep 2003\n\nLocation: In Flanders Fields where the poppies blow\n\nPosts: 23,529\n\nfunny name for a ww2 German based company\n\nTo be clear, my grandfather was a forced laborer in Germany, All i care about is knowing exactly what the deal was with Porsche.\n\nIt's just a historical anecdote at this point and in no way do I care how this relates to My fun car or the present day company.\n\nBut if anybody is going to make statements about it, I'de like to know the details about what company we are talking about.. So I can at least read up about it.\n\nWW2 german history is a pretty vague discussion because they destroyed a lot of record..\n\nSo if you are stating he flat out owned the factory, i'de like to know which one.\n\nTo my knowledge he ran the Volkswagen Factory in Wolfsburg, which Hitler had wanted to call Porsche factory, which he refused.. And to my knowledge he didn't \"own\" that factory... And he did write to Hitler to get the workers fed better.\n\nNow you can argue if he did so out of pity, or altruism.. or simply because of wanting better results out of the workers. No idea.. or argument from me there.\n\nI'm just curious to know which factory that he owned, used slave labor and what they made..\n\n__________________\n\nStijn Vandamme\n\nEX911STARGA73EX92477EX94484EX944S88NOW987C2007\n\nBIMDIESELBMW116D2019\n\nModel Citizen\n\nJoin Date: May 2007\n\nLocation: The Voodoo Lounge\n\nPosts: 17,246\n\nAs far as I can tell he was the majority owner of the VW factories starting before ww2, as per the wiki; this factory was originally founded to produce the Peoples car, but was soon transformed to build the Kublewagen.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Porsche\n\nSince being engaged by the National-Socialist authorities in building the Volksauto, Porsche was praised as the Great German Engineer.[3] Hitler considered Czechs subhuman[10] and Porsche was in 1934 urged to apply for German citizenship.[3] A few days later, Porsche indeed filed a declaration giving up the Czechoslovak citizenship at a Czechoslovak consulate in Stuttgart.[18] In 1937, Porsche joined the National Socialist German Workers' Party[19] (becoming member no. 5,643,287[20]) as well as the SS.[21] By 1938, Porsche was using the SS as security members and drivers at his factory, and later set up a special unit called SS Sturmwerk Volkswagen.[20] In 1942, Porsche reached the rank of SS-Oberführer.[22] During the war, Porsche was further decorated with the SS-Ehrenring and awarded the War Merit Cross.[23] As the war progressed his proposed solutions to new developments became more complex and Ferdinand Porsche gained a reputation in certain circles as a \"mad scientist\" especially with Albert Speer (mainly due to his new found affinity for \"pointy\" designs).[24]\n\nA new city, \"Stadt des KdF-Wagens\" was founded near Fallersleben for the Volkswagen factory, but wartime production concentrated almost exclusively on the military Kübelwagen and Schwimmwagen variants. Mass production of the car, which later became known as the Beetle, began after the end of the war. The city is named Wolfsburg today and is still the headquarters of the Volkswagen Group.\n\nAs to the slave labor, there is plenty on the web; of course it is disputed but there is information that Porsche has agreed that at least a limited number were used under H's regime.\n\nhttps://www.dw.com/en/porsche-to-investigate-forced-labor-under-hitler/a-4783359\n\n\"Porsche has already admitted to implementing forced labor at its factories under Hitler's rule. So far, Porsche has admitted to using only minimal slave labor. It has acknowledged that 50 people had been subjected to forced labor. They were said to be Poles, Russians, Dutch, Flemish, Belgian, Czech, and Italians.\"\n\n__________________\n\n\"I would be a tone-deaf heathen if I didn't call the engine astounding.

It's Memorial Day and this is exactly the wrong kind of discussion to be having today. Reading up on the German side of WWII has made me want to get out of the house and go reflect on the good things that we as Americans enjoy on this holiday when we remember the sacrifices that our descendants made so that we could live in peace.\n\nI like Porsche cars. I like Japanese electronics and cars. I love America more than both of those things and this rabbit hole has made me realize this more than I have in a long time.\n\nOh, and that was the best Indy 500 in years!\n\n__________________\n\n\"I would be a tone-deaf heathen if I didn't call the engine astounding.

You want your company to grow to the point where it could have the resources to build a car but that is just a dream. Then along comes the head of the state of a powerful state. Hitler summons you to the office and says I want you to build me a people's car. The Porsche company had only done designs of equipment, and of course with the military spending money, they ask for designs of tanks, and war related equipment. Now Hitler says he is a huge pile of money, I want a people's car and I want it right away.\n\nDo you tell Hitler, nope, I don't like your politics so forget it. Knowing full well Hitler can just wave his hand and throw you in a labor camp or have you executed on the spot. Of course the status and money is appealing, but the power of Hitler and his loyal followers is overwhelming.\n\nWould you have told Hitler, no?\n\nWe likely will never know the full truth of how it happened.\n\n__________________\n\nGlen\n\n48 Year member of the Porsche Club of America\n\n1985 911 Carrera; 2017 Macan\n\n1986 El Camino with Fuel Injected 350 Crate Engine\n\nMy Motto: I will never be too old to have a happy childhood!\n\nThread Killer\n\nJoin Date: Aug 2003\n\nLocation: SF east bay\n\nPosts: 22,621\n\nWell, I wasn't looking to have the only focus of this thread be the elder Ferdinand's affiliation with the Nazis. It is a fascinating part of his career, but it seems impossible to really know his mind during that period of his life.\n\nFor me, it's interesting his early fascination with electric vehicles, leading up to his creation of the world's first hybrid. Then, his time with Mercedes-Benz, the Beetle, and even the military projects. There's enough material here for the likes of Ken Burns to make an awesome series. I was hoping something like this existed.\n\n__________________\n\n08 HP2 Sport\n\n05 Triumph Tiger\n\nRegistered\n\nJoin Date: Sep 2005\n\nLocation: Pasadena, CA\n\nPosts: 1,353\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Steve Carlton\n\nWell, I wasn't looking to have the only focus of this thread be the elder Ferdinand's affiliation with the Nazis.

Probably because of the breadth and depth of the subject and the difficulty of doing it right.)\n\nIn lieu, I wrote a piece last year about Porsche and MBZ T-80 land speed car. The Auto Union/MBZ era is a fascinating piece of history that doesn't get a lot of attention:\n\nhttps://view.publitas.com/fitzhugh-media/southwest-star-magazine-2020-2nd-issue/page/42-43\n\nI'll recommend Origin of the Species again. It is focused around the birth of Porsche as a company, but has amazing details around the origin story and the path to the start of the company.\n\nKeep a watch out for an upcoming book set from Randy Leffingwell that traces Porsche's racing origins back to the beginning of the beginning. It is a multi-year project and done with the benefit of Porsche archive material.\n\nIf you find yourself in Austria, stop by the Porsche museum in Gmund.\n\n__________________\n\n1997 993 Cabriolet"
