        "text": "This list includes supercentenarians (people who have attained the age of at least 110 years) and foreign supercentenarians who were born in the historical state of Austria-Hungary.\n\nAustria-Hungary was an multi-national country, located in Central Europe. It was a constitutional union of the Empire of Austria and the Apostolic Kingdom of Hungary that existed from 1867 to 1918 and it consisted of many different nations, speaking their native languages - German, Hungarian, Czech, Polish, Ukrainian, Slovak, Slovenian, Croatian, Serbian, Italian and Romanian. Austria-Hungary was a multinational realm and also one of the world's great powers. Austria-Hungary was geographically the second-largest country in Europe after the Russian Empire, at 621,538 km2 (239,977 sq mi), and the third-most populous (after Russian Empire and the German Empire). The Austro-Hungarian state ceased to exist in 1918, after the lost World War I, and its disintegration gave rise to new countries existing today in these areas: Austria, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and also parts of today Poland, Ukraine, Italy, Serbia, Montenegro and Romania.\n\nThere have been verified 38 supercentenarians born in the historical state of Austria-Hungary. Another 10 supercentenarians are currently pending. The verified supercentenarians were born in today Austria, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Croatia and Hungary. What is more, there are pending supercentenarians born in Ukraine. This list also features unvalidated supercentenarians whose ages are probably true. As for the present day, there are no verified supercentenarians born in the modern borders of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia, but there is one pending case in Slovakia.\n\nThe oldest person ever born in the historical state of Austria-Hungary is Tekla Juniewicz (1906-2022) of Poland, aged 118 years, 68 days. The oldest known male born in the Austro-Hungarian Empire was Jerzy Pajaczkowski-Dydynski (1894-2005), aged 111 years, 140 days.
