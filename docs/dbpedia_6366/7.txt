üê≠ The 50 best Disney movies for family night

1. Inside Out (2015)

This family flick is one of Pixar‚Äôs most creative storylines‚Äîprepare for a roller coaster of emotions! The key characters of this sweet movie are actually a little girl‚Äôs feelings‚ÄîDisgust, Joy and Sadness, to name a few‚Äîand accompany her on an unexpected move from the Midwest to the West Coast. Clever, charming and gut-busting funny, this is a movie the whole crew will love! Stream on Disney+. Rated PG

2. The Mitchells Vs. the Machines (2021)

A visual stunner from the team behind Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse, The Mitchells takes its cues from the classic road-trip films of yesteryear. Parents trying to connect with their uninterested kids? Check. Pit stops at roadside attractions? Yup. A quest to free all of humanity from a machine apocalypse launched by a sentient iPhone and an army or robots? Okay, the Griswolds never dealt with that. But still, despite its kinetic action, this is very much a tender family film at its heart, one whose jokes hit with precision that speaks to parents and kids alike. Rated PG.

The rat can cook! This sweetly ridiculous movie about a naive, ambitious rodent named Remy (charmingly voiced by Patton Oswalt), who longs to become a great chef is witty, clever, gently moral and dramatically convincing. Who doesn't love Linguini (voiced by Lou Romano), a hopeless human moppet controlled by the supremely talented Remy? Will they win over the Snow White-style villain, a power-crazed food critic named Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole)? We won't spoil the fun for the three of you out there who don't yet know the ending! Stream on Disney+. Rated G

4. The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)

Don‚Äôt let the title scare you off from showing this Tim Burton classic to the wee ones. Sure, the stop-motion animation is a little oogie-boogie, but the story is far too sweet to cause many actual nightmares. Jack Skellington is the spindly Pumpkin King of Halloweentown, but he‚Äôs grown weary of frights. When he discovers the joy of another holiday called Christmas, it invigorates his passion for giving. But when you‚Äôve spent your whole life scaring humans, making the transition to mirth and merriment isn‚Äôt smooth. Stream it on Disney+. Rated PG

Don't worry about the strange setup‚Äìthat all babies are sorted into two categories, and the ones who don't become part of a family are trained as managers in Babycorp‚Äìbecause your kid will love it when the gravel-voiced Boss Baby (Alec Baldwin) goes undercover with the Templeton family. For some reason, the schtick of baby sounding like a cynical middle-aged manager doesn't get old. This is a film that's snarky, and funny, and deeply silly. Stream on Amazon Prime. Rated PG

6. Despicable Me (2010)

Gru is awfully busy trying to steal the moon. However, his evil plan is uprooted when he becomes responsible for three orphan sisters. The wicked scientist doesn't seem to mind his new role as a father, but how will this affect his evil, other-worldly ordeals? Stream on Netflix. Rated PG

This Pixar feature is set in a fairy tale land that‚Äôs losing its magic‚Äîthe elves who live there would rather use their phones and other devices than spells.

He sets off with his brother Barley (Chris Pratt) to complete the spell so he can see his father one last time‚Äîand maybe bring magic back to the elves. Stream on Disney+. Rated PG

This lovely tale of a young witch coming of age in a new town is the perfect entrypoint to Japan‚Äôs magnificent Studio Ghibli, a film of breathtaking artistry and huge heart. There‚Äôs really no conflict here. Just the story of a young girl making friends, hanging out with her wisecracking cat and learning to be independent. That‚Äôs not to say there‚Äôs no excitement ‚Äì the climax featuring an imperiled dirigible is a white-knuckle bit of braveau animation ‚Äì but really, just watching the hero cruise the friendly skies on her broom is enough to keep even the most cynical viewer smiling. Rated G.

10. The Lion King (1994)

Equal parts endearing and heartbreaking, the Disney classic rotates around young lion Simba, who must rise to power after the loss of his father, Mufasa. You would think the family would be supportive, but one evil uncle has it in for the cub. Hang in there, Simba! Remember: Hakuna matata! (Don't forget to check out the 2019 live-action reboot!)

A bold, beautiful and (let's be honest) somewhat bleak film transforms a dystopian future into something delightful and laugh-out-loud funny. The year is 2700, and a robot named WALL-E that has a cube for a belly and binoculars for eyes is left to clean up the Earth. The only humans left live a sterile, bloated life in a cruise ship-like spaceship‚Äîit's robots like WALL-E, the lovely and graceful EVE and even the sinister autopilot named (what else?)

16. Shrek (2001)

They've all been banished from Lord Farquaad's kingdom, so Shrek makes a deal with the pint-sized authoritarian to get his land back. All he has to do is retrieve the beautiful Princess Fiona‚Äîwho's been locked away in a castle‚Äîso Lord Farquaad can make her his bride. It seems simple, right?

22. Minions (2015)

From sidekicks to superstars, the Minions busted out of the Despicable Me franchise and have gone rogue in this slice of slapstick silliness. Little, yellow and essentially useless, can they carry an entire film? The answer is yes. The Minions indulge their weirdest, most randomly hilarious instincts. Set in the summer of 1968, the film follows three Minions as they search for a new evil master to serve. They fix upon supervillain Scarlett Overkill (Sandra Bullock)‚Äîthe action sequences are wild, the jokes dumb-but-smart, and the sense of anything-goes is glorious. Stream on Amazon Prime. Rated PG

The breakout star of 2014‚Äôs The LEGO Movie now gets his own action-packed, completely batty superhero spinoff, The LEGO Batman Movie. The first LEGO film was a real surprise: What could have been a lazy cash-in turned out to be sweet, funny and fiendishly original in the way it acknowledged and celebrated its own artificiality. And one of the film‚Äôs highlights was its take on Batman: a self-involved millionaire playboy who dresses in black body armor to fight crime and chase chicks. The inept egomaniac is at the center of this ferociously paced, wildly silly pastiche of the comic-book blockbusters that dominate today. Stream on Hulu. Rated PG

This long-anticipated sequel feels entirely fresh. The world it creates is charming, the wit sparkles, and‚Äîone brief burst of ‚ÄúReindeer(s) Are Better Than People‚Äù aside‚Äîthe songs are all new. So let go of ‚ÄúLet It Go‚Äù and clear some room for a new batch of earworms. As you‚Äôd expect, Frozen II‚Äôs story again focuses on Elsa (voiced by Idina Menzel), but her exuberant sister, Anna (Kristen Bell), is very much a co-conspirator this time, having When Harry Met Sally-ish tiffs with the lovestruck Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), and helping guide the scene-stealing Olaf (Josh Gad) through a very funny coming-of-neige plotline. The hilarious ‚ÄúWhen I Am Older‚Äù and some philosophical musings on the nature of existence are an absolute delight. Stream on Disney+. Rated PG

It seems someone is planning to put a wrench in the works of the World Grand Prix, a three-part race‚Äîall the cars, McQueen among them, are supposed to use Axlerod's new clean-fuel compound, Allinol, though it has, shall we say, an explosively fatal flaw.

Princess Merida (voiced by Kelly Macdonald) is all hair: Her long, flowing crimson locks steal the show. She's also plucky, rebellious and not down with the traditions sanctioned by her mother, Queen Elinor (voiced by Emma Thompson), that go with the regal lifestyle. Her Royal Highness isn't impressed by the princess‚Äôs radical notions. (Marry for love instead of having your hand won by a suitor?!? Ridiculous!) So is it any shock that when Merida finds herself in the presence of a wood-carving enchantress, she wishes the Queen into a, shall we say, bear of a predicament? The slapstick that follows takes us through stunningly detailed Scottish locations. Stream on Disney+. Rated PG

49. The Polar Express (2004)

Chris Van Allsburg's picture book gets the animated treatment in a lovable holiday film that's destined to become a classic. When a young boy expresses doubts about those Christmas traditions, a train ride to the North Pole changes his opinions. Stream on Netflix. Rated G

Walt Disney had already made a name for himself, having worked on a number of animated shorts (he actually had high hopes for a rodent character he'd just created, Mickey something or other), but in early 1934 he felt it was time to move into the big leagues. Disney announced that he and his team would be starting on their first feature-length film: an adaptation of the Brothers Grimm fairy tale about a princess and her septet of pint-size friends. The rest, as they say, is history. When you watch this extraordinary effort today, you can see the company's decades-old recipe for success forming before your very eyes: the heroine in peril, the moving musical numbers ("Some Day My Prince Will Come"), the humorous (Dopey), the horrifying (the Wicked Queen) and the happily-ever-after ending. It all starts here. Stream on Disney+. Rated G
