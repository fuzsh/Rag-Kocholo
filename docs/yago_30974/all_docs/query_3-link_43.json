Excerpt: Nathalie Kappler (formerly von Lahnstein) is a fictional character from the German soap opera Verbotene Liebe (Forbidden Love). The character is portrayed by actress Jenny Winkler. She made her first appearance on screen on 12 November 2004. In spite of the complications in Nathalie's relationship with Ansgar, the couple remains by the fans as one with the strongest supporter group. On internet message boards, the couple is often referred to as \"Ansglie\" (for Ansgar and Nathalie). Nathalie grows up in the East Germany and lost her parents, when she fled to West Germany during the DDR. She finds a new home by her aunt Elke Kappler (Elke Bludau). Elke works as head maid for the aristocratic Lahnstein family. Nathalie grows up with them and soon finds good friends in Carla (Claudia Hiersche) and her brother Leonard (Lars Korten).
