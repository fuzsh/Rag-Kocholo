        "text": "Character history\n\nStella is the cousin of Gregor (Andreas Jancke) and Christian Mann (Thore Schölermann) and she came to Düsseldorf in late 2008, where she searched for a new challenge. Stella first stalked Christian and Gregor when she entered NoLimits,she even followed them to the old helicopter hangar. When they saw Stella in a ninja costume, they attack her, ending in Gregor yanking the mask off Stella's face. Stella then revealed herself to the two shocked brothers, saying \"It's me Stella, your beautiful cousin!\" Later on, she applied for a job as a caretaker for a hospital, but with her tendency to be too dedicated to her work, it doesn't work out. When Leonard von Lahnstein (Lars Korten) and his wife Sarah (Sina-Valeska Jung) met her, they soon made her an offer to work as caretaker in their castle Königsbrunn. When she is interviewed by Elisabeth von Lahnstein (Martina Servatius) everything seemed to be great until Elisabeth tells her that they need the approval of her stepdaughter Carla (Claudia Hiersche). Stella and Carla had already met, without knowing who the other was. Carla isn't pleased when she finds out that Stella wants the job, because she thinks from their first meeting that Stella is harsh and not the ideal candidate to work in the house of Lahnsteins. But Leonard, Elisabeth and Sarah try to convince Carla that she should give Stella another chance. When Stella went to pick up her application, Carla asks her to sit down and offers her the job after all.\n\nSome time later, Carla falls in love with Stella (after being told by Gregor that Carla and Stella \"are of the same kind\"), and tells Sarah and Nathalie about it. Tension arises between Carla and Stella, seeing as Carla is Stella's employer. When Charlie Schneider tells Stella that she once had a crush on another woman, Stella falls for her, who is taken aback, about it and seeks advice from Olli. Olli tells Charlie to give it a try and Charlie did - and kisses Stella on Stella's birthday party, which Carla was present to watch. Carla was sad because she's in love with Stella, so seeing her with Charlie hurts.\n\nWhen Carla's horse Mr. Ed suffers an illness and Carla was also suffering because of memories of her family and Mr. Ed, Stella comforts Carla, then realizes that she reciprocates Carla's feelings - as in feeling the same kind of love that Carla felt for Stella. After some encouragement from Charlie, Stella goes to the stables to meet up with Carla and be there for her while the vet takes care of Mr. Ed. When the horse recovers, Carla thanks Stella and then Stella walks away a few feet from Carla when Carla said, \"Wait.\" Stella turns around, Carla walks up to Stella, and the two end up kissing and having sex in the stable, thus becoming a couple.\n\nOn November 10, Carla and Stella left Düsseldorf to start a world tour."
