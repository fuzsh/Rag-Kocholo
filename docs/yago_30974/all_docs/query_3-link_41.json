        "text": "Mom had talked to some church friends of hers who have a pool, and they invited us over. It was a lovely pool, cool and refreshing. Between the couple a little older than Mom and Dad, A. and L.M., and their daughter, A.B., probably fairly close to my age, they had three small dogs, who went in for a bit of a swim every so often. One was part basset hound -- I could tell by the legs. They think the other part is Jack Russell terrier, which would explain the head and face. The ears were a compromise, triangular drop ears, but not long. One dog was a poodle/bichon frise mix, and one I think a Yorkshire terrrier sort of thing, only bigger, maybe Australian terrier size. The poodle mix seemed to be the best swimmer. The owners would give the Yorkie-type a dip every so often to keep her cooled off. The basset mix would go in as far as the first step, where her head was still above water. Bassets aren't particularly built for swimming.\n\nAnyway, it was a very nice day. I put waterproof sunscreen on before I went in the pool, then put more on my face and shoulders later, as I have that very fair English complexion. I still got a little pink on my nose and cheeks, and around the tops of my arms. Dad sat in the shade and read a mystery, Mom swam some laps, and I paddled around. They had some pool noodles, which reminded me of Alles Was Zahlt and \"the pool of sin.\" They actually are kind of fun to float around with.\n\nI told L.M. a much-edited version of the kind of editing work I do. I did tell her about last summer, with the prairie dog shapeshifters who were members of a biker gang. (Changeling, Dawg Town.) That gets the idea of the wackiness across, without going into detail about how explicit the stories are.\n\nI think all of us at one time or another went off into the shade to read. I'd brought Tangled Web, which I got maybe a month after it was first supposed to come out. Giovanni's Room got it for me pretty quickly when it did come out. I had started it before, and couldn't think how our hero would get himself out of trouble, but I got a little further this time, and perhaps they'll manage. It's all right that I'm taking a long time to finally read it. I don't e-mail Lee Rowan very often, so she wouldn't be expecting to hear from me.\n\nI watched some more Verbotene Liebe YouTube clips focused on Carla and Stella. It's like a totally different world. You get glimpses of Gregor and Christian with Stella, and Olli when Charlie's involved, but it's mostly von Lahnsteins. The Manns and Olli are much more working-class, or service-job class, so none of them are involved in the aristocratic intrigues until Gregor finds out who Luise is, and the press finds out who Gregor is. Wikipedia actually had a \"Lahnstein family\" entry off their Verbotene Liebe entry, which explained much. I hadn't known that Tanja was a serial killer. I have no trouble believing it, because she's definitely one of the evil characters. I like some of the von Lahnsteins, like Elisabeth, Leonard, and Constantin, but I don't care too much for the rest of them."
