September, 1963, will see the time of the admission of the first Arts and Science freshman. One-hundred twenty young people will form four sections or classes. For more than 40 years, Bloomsburg has been an institution educating teachers certified for service in the schools of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. This one function has limited its ability to serve the youth of Pennsylvania and has excluded many from the opportunity of attending college while living at home or from attending college at all because they were not abie to pay the fees charged by private institutions. Realizing the inability of the College Entrance Examinations, generally called the College Boards, to serve as the sole and final basis for admission, Bloomsburg will continue an experiment begun last year. One hundred or more “trial” freshmen will be admitted to the regular six-weex summer session to take two courses — one in English and the other in mathematics, which, if completed with average grades, will admit these freshmen to the first semester, beginning in September. Cast year’s admission was offered to approximately 60, 50 of whom showed up for classes in the summer session. More than 40 completed their summer work and 34 returned to enroll in September. Recently a committee representing the Middle States Association visited the campus to determine th ability of the College to begin to offr courses leading to the Master’s Degree for teachers of English and Social Studies, including Geography. We have reason to believe that candidates to (1) take graduate courses leading to permanent certificate and/or (2) become candidates for the Master’s Degree will be admitted in either the summer session or in the fall semster of 1903. Total enrollments will be fixed at a figure not to exceed a 25 per cent increase in the next two years and construction will be begun on two women’s dormitories to accom- modate 500, a men’s dormitory to accommodate 300 and an auditorium to seat 2,000 during the coming year. Further information regarding the development of a second campus on the Country Club site will be released as soon as the legislature has completed its deliberations, and the Governor has signed certain bills, which are now in the process of being drawn Or considered. In the meantime, you will please understand that these are plans being made for Bloomsburg rather than prophesies of what will happen in the future at your alma mater. President THE ALUMNI QUARTERLY Vol. LXIV, No. I April, 1963 MID-YEAR COMMENCEMENT Address delivered at the Commencement Exercises of Blooms- burg State College Thursday, January 17, 1963, by Dr. Ralph E. Heiges, President of Shippensburg State College. Success Is A Journey t Published quarterly by the Alumni Association of the State College, Bloomsburg, Pa.

Millard Ludwig ’48 P. O. Box 227 Millville, Pa. Miss Elizabeth Hubler 14 West Biddle Street Gordon, Pa. I am, indeed, honored to be here at this, your midyear Commence- ment of the Class of 1963. Natur- ally, being a stranger to members of the class, 1 do not know what your attitude is toward this day or toward me as Commencement speaker. Perhaps it is the same as was expressed by the six-year- old after the first day of school. He got off the bus and as he was leav- ing he turned around to the driver and said, \"You don’t need to stop for me tomorrow.” The driver was naturally surprised and asked how that was. hteve said, “I’ve had enough of that stuff!” Or, perhaps you may be charac- terized on this occasion by the same comment made about a jet bomber observed flying over the Carolina Banks. An old codger looked up and said, \"And to think, 1 told Wilbur and Orville they would never fly!” And now, whether you have just \"had enough of this stuff” or you surprised a lot of people by being in this graduating class, at least I have you as a captive audience for a few minutes. A few months ago, Red Smith, the sports writer, made a particu- larly profound observation. He wrote, \"It is a truth well-known to all authorities on geriatrics that the older a man gets the faster he could run as a boy.” More recently, the Saturday Evening Post reported that a few months after an election, 10% to 15% of the citizens who actually voted for a defeated candidate have come to believe sincerely that they voted for the man who won. This retrospective vote for the winner increases with time. It’s impossible, for example, to find a single old-timer who recalls voting against Teddy Roosevelt. This accommodating flexibility of the memory is a pleasant kind of failing. Unfortunately some of its side effects are not socially harmless. The generation that has developed a protective myopia to- ward its own mistakes not only has £0-20 vision for the mistakes of its offspring but also is sure it knows exactly how to correct them. But. anyway, here’s some advice. As a graduate of a State College, and as a President of another State College, I feel it incumbent on me to say several things about these colleges. Your President here at Bloomsburg has searched the rec- ords and plainly stated the facts about the growth of the State Col- leges, which growth emphasizes the theme of my remarks — Suc- cess is a Journey. You are being graduated from a college suppor- ted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and you have enjoy- ed the privilege and the appropri- ations extended by the Common- wealth in order that this higher education might be accomplished. Many others will want this same privilege and ye there is a contin- uous threat to it. This threat is the lack of understanding in the Commonwealth as to the nature of public higher education. Public higher education in the state must meet at least three spe- cifications in order to exist. Public higher education must be geogra- phically available. Also, public higher education must be obtain- able at a reasonable cost. And as its third attribute, public higher education must be quality educa- tion. Too often the legislators and the citizens in general fail to real- APRIL, 1963 Page 1 ize that these three attributes are necessary to public higher educa- tion. it is no answer to have a college in a town or across the street and charge so much that the citizens cannot afford to at- tend. Public higher education is the cornerstone of our democracy in these times of increasing auto- mation and scientific advance. We don’t dare over-price it. You have the opportunity, and it will be incumbent upon you, to take a stand in favor of public higher education. So much for that. At this juncture in your educa- tional and personal life we stop to recognize your achievements. We pause to honor you for what you have done. This day is not the accomplishment. Rather, the hour- ly and daily chores of the last three or four years are the important things. Success is a Journey. I am sure that each of you look forward from time to time to tak- ing a vacation. Some of these vacations are more extended than others. Each year my wife and I enjoy planning and taking a vaca- tion. At least, we try to take one annually. Through the years we have taken cruises in the Carib- bean. We choose a vessel that plans to go to ports in which we may be interested, and in prepar- ation we may read about the type of weather, what is to be seen, and where, above all, gentlemen, where the shopping is! But it is the cruise that makes the journey. You sail from New York with the lights all aglow in Manhattan and you go by the Statue of Lib- erty and on to the ocean. Then you head south, knowing that in a day or two it will be much warm- er. Indeed, on the second day a few brave souls will appear in shorts to take advantage of the sun. Another day there is more sun, water in the swimming pool, deck games and the like. Then, per- haps, you will dock at Nassau or Jamaica and on to the shopper’s paradise of the western hemi- sphere, Curacao. Now you may have read, before you started, about the bridge in Curacao — the bridge at the harbor — which is on small pontoons. As an ocean vessel comes and leaves the har- bor, this pontoon bridge is folded against the banks of the bay. But until you see this; until you really appreciate the ingenuity and the quaintness of the situation, you have not fully made this journey. Now I could go on and describe to you the sights of Caracas, or die Virgin Islands, and then the re- turn to New York itself — the slow humdrum pace of customs, and the return home. It is not the destin- ation that we are interested in; it is the journey itself. Friends, Suc- cess is a Journey. The success of your journey now may well be determined by the preparation you made for it. In- deed, you have spent several years here in preparing for your journey into the educational field or else- where. Whether or not you will be able to collect the hundred thousand dollars it is estimated the college graduate will earn in his lifetime, above and beyond that of a high school graduate, is a matter for speculation and your efforts to produce. A man was walking across a park in a city and he knew there was a mental institution nearby, as well as a college. He stopped to in- quire of a person working in the park which way it was to the col- lege. The man, who was a patient of the mental institution close by, pointed across the park to the col- lege and then observed to the questioner, “You know, I belong to this other state institution, but you have to show improvement to get out!” In spite of this seeming slur on the college, I am sure that you have made great progress to arrive at this day in your life. There is an ever-increasing de- mand for more specialized knowl- edge. Newspapers and magazines suggest the advantages of techno- logists of all kinds. Pages and pages of advertisements plead for mathematicians, physicists, elec- tronic designers and computer pro- grammers. You must think of your field of specialization on this journey. Take time to think — for you have many decisions to make. Every generation has its problems and this is no exception. You may feel your decisions are on questions of unbelievable gravity. However, let us look backward at history a moment and raise the question: “Would you have signed the Dec- laration of Independence?” Would you have flaunted your signature in front of the king, as John Hancock did when he said, ’\"There, George the Third won’t have to wear his spectacles to see that!” Then followed such people as Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Sam Adams, and John Adams. This was in 1776, and remember that Longfellow describes an event of a year earlier in these words: “Listen, my children, and you shall hear Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere. On the 18th of April in ’75, Hardly a man is now alive Who remembers that famous day and year.” Seventeen seventy-five . . . And yet it was a whole year later, the spring of 1776 that there was still the discussion of what to do. A committee of Jefferson, Franklin, Sherman, Livingston and John Ad- ams put it in writing and a resolu- tion was passed to accept his Dec- laration of Independence But then, it was even several days later before the revised copy, the en- grossed copy, was made and sign- ed; and each man knew that it was possible that he was signing his own death warrant Now you may think that this event is something that happened years ago and such a momentous decision need never be made again. But I say to you that each gener- ation must sign the Declaration of Independence again. Each generation by its own sacrifice of money and treasure, and perhaps even by blood, must preserve the doctrines set forth in the Declara- tion of Independence. You cannot escape the obligation. Success is a Journey. Probably the secret of youth is that it takes time to play. Now play can be thought of — often is thought of — as being some type of vigorous physical exercise — in one era it may be golf, in another touch football or water skiing. But I prefer to look at it in a broader way which might be summarized by several questions, such as: Do Page 2 THE ALUMNI QUARTERLY you have a hobby? Have you read a book? In emphasizing the neces- sity for play as part of your jour- ney, I also would like to indicate that a balance in your life must be maintained. In vour ear is a little canal which contains some fluid, and this little canal is what enables you to main- tain your physical balance. If it does not function properly, or if it becomes infected, you will not be able to stand upright. You will become nauseated and uncomfort- able. This delicate physical me- chanism must operate effectively or the world around us becomes topsy-turvy. And, we all need another kind of balance — the balance in our men- tal life. We are constantly walk- ing a tightrope — a tightrope be- tween the two types of mental in- stitutions I mentioned previously — on the one hand the institution trying to restore those in ill-health mentally, and on the other hand those that improve the minds to better serve mankind. We must maintain a balance between our work, our intellectual life, and our play in order to avoid one and keep our balance. If you accept the thesis that Suc- cess is a Journey, then you can change your goals; you can change your destinations. Take time to dream. It hitches the soul to the stars. My generation remembers the day when there was no radio. Your generation remembers the time when there was no TV. But your children will always think of radio and TV as being part of their very life. We dreamed of space in the comic books, and lo, it is upon us! It has been estimated that 11% of the products we now use were not produced four years ago. Also, that 10% of prescriptions we use today could not be filled five years ago. This is, indeed, a day of dreaming, in which the most fan- tastic dreams you may have come true. But without dreaming, with- out thinking, without planning, there can be no attainment of a goal. In the attainment of the goal is your success. Now, lest you become too en- amoured of the idea of success, I would like to read to you a short see of verses written by General Alfred N. Gruenther — just to keep your sense of proportion: Sometime when you’re feeling important, Sometime when your ego’s in bloom, Sometime when you take it for granted you’re the best qualified in the room. Sometime when you think that your going will leave an unfillable hole, Just try this simple experiment and see what it does for your soul. Take a bucket, fill it with water, Put pour hand in clear up to the wrist, Now pull it out, and the hole that remains is a measure of how you’ll be missed. You can splash all you please when you enter, You can stir up the water galore. But stop — in a minute you’ll find it just the same as before. The moral in this quaint example is Be proud of yourself, Do the very best that you can, But remember: There is no indispensable man. And in conclusion, may I re- mind you that you alone are not graduating today. Your parents and your ancestors have given you the opportunity — the opportunity of being — the opportunity of be- ing what you are. Sir Christopher Wren, the build- er of many famous architectural ed- ifices, was going around the site when St. Paul’s Cathedral was be- ing built. He asked one of the men who was cutting the stone for the building, “What are you doing?” He said, “I’m cutting a stone.” He went on to another worker doing the same task. He said, “What are you doing?” “Im earning 5 shil- lings a day.” Going on to the next man, he again asked the same question, “What are you doing, my man?” To which he got the re- sponse, “I am helping Sir Christo- pher Wren to build a beautiful cathedral.” There can be little doubt as to which of these three men was getting the most out of life. Success is a Journey. May you have a successful journey throughout life.

Kunkel lives at 46 Huy- ler Road, Somerville, New Jersey. APRIL, 1963 Page 3 SCHEDULE OF WORKSHOP The Bloomsburg State College is pleased to announce the schedul- ing of a workshop in the P.S.S.C. Program during the regular sum- mer session, July 1-August 9. Class- es will be conducted daily, Monday through Friday, 8:00 a. m. to 12:30 p. m. The course will be offered at the undergraduate level for six hours of credit. This program, developed by the Physical Science Study Committee, headed by Dr. J. R. Zacharias of M.l.T. in 1956, is now being taught to 200,000 high school students. Basic materials include the P.S.S.C. Physics textbook, laboratory guide and teacher’s guide. It is recom- mended that, if possible, teachers participating in the workshop re- quest their school districts to pur- chase a set of laboratory apparatus from the Macalaster Scientific Co., Cambridge, Massachusetts. We believe the P.S.S.C. Program to be a significant step forward in the teaching of physics in the sec- ondary schools. It can contribute materially to the preparation of scientists and to increase the in- terest in and appreciation of phy- sical science to the non-science stu- dent. The vitality and life of the course is in its inductive approach, and the use of the laboratory as a learning experience. All science teachers who are teaching or plan to teach high shcool physics, and supervisors of science, are invited to participate. The program will include lectures on selected topics, discussion of problems, laboratory experience, P.S.S.C. films, related readings, and testing. The teacher’s guide will be used in the workshop dis- cussions. Cost to the participants will in- clude: Summer Session Basic Fee $75.00 Summer Session Activities Fee 5.00 P.S.S.C. Physics Text 5.80 Laboratory Guide 1.40 $87.20 Recommended, but optional: Teachers Guide $12.00 P.S.S.C. Laboratory materials, app. $75.00 ’62 SURVEY SHOWS STUDENTS FROM GREATER AREA An increasingly larger number of communities located at greater distances from the college are rep- resented at BSC according to sur- veys and analyses of the past dec- ade. The 1962 survey, completed recently, indicated a significant in- crease in number of students whose homes are in Southeastern Pennsylvania, particularly Phila- delphia, Bucks, Montgomery, Del- aware and Chester counties. Of the total enrollment of near- ly 2,000 students, more than half come from 39 communities in 48 of the 67 counties in the State. Num- erically the town of Bloomsburg ranks first with 170, followed by Shamokin with 102, Berwick with 100, Danville with 78, and Hazle- ton with 59. Seven communities are represen- ted by groups of students ranging from 26 to 50 in number. They are Sunbury 41, Williamsport 39, Cata- wissa 36, Wilkes-Barre 35, Scran- ton 30, Northumberland 29 and Milton 28. It is interesting to note that 413 students come from 27 towns having groups of 10 to 25 students enrolled at Bloomsburg. Approximately 1-3 of this group live in counties in Southeastern Pennsylvania. Included in the communities having 10 to 25 students at Blooms- burg are: Allentown 17 Ashland 13, Benton 18, Bethlehem 12, Elys- burg 10, Frackville 11, Glenside 10, Harrisburg 13, Glen Lyon 13, Hatboro 14, Kingston 18, Lewis- burg 11, Levittown 21, Lewistown 15, Mahanoy City 21, Mt. Carmel 24, Muncy 18, Nescopeck 20, Phil- adelphia 18, West Pittston and Pit- tston, 19, Plymouth 15, Pottstown 12, Pottsville 14, Reading 14, Shickshinny 16, Shenandoah 13, Upper Darby 13. 1907 George M. Lehman is living in Brandonville, Pa. ►♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦44 444444444444 4444-44-44-44-444-444-44-444-444-44444-4 ARCUS’ “FOR A PRETTIER YOU” Bloomsburg — Berwick — Danville Max Arcus, ’41 BLOOMSBURG PLAYERS “The Warm Peninsula,” a two- act comedy-drama by Joe Master- off, was presented by the Blooms- burg Players, Bloomsburg State College, on Thursday and Friday, February 14-15, at 8:15 p. m. in Carver Auditorium. The play was directed by Wil- liam Cope, of the college faculty. Costumes and makeup were under the supervision of Miss Mary Hom- righous of the faculty. Special costumes were designed and exe- cuted by students enrolled in the speech course in costume and makeup. The cast of characters: Dolores Keen, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Max Maurer, Sunbury; Rob- ert Hensley, son of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Hensley, Wilkes-Barre; Priscilla Greco, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Anthony Greco, Blooms- burg; Donald Hopkins, son of Mrs. Fay Hopkins, Dallas; Ann M.

Reedy of West Milton; Phyllis Miller, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Leroy Miller, Pottsgrove. Robert Hensley was stage manager and Phyllis Miller, assistant stage manager. In an address to more than 100 members attending the Legislative Conference of the Pennsylvania Congress of Parents and Teachers at the Capitol Motel, Harrisburg, December 7 Dr. Harvey A. And- russ, President of Bloomsburg State College, pointed out a num- ber of important items related to “Pennsylvania’s Problems in High- er Education” to be considered by the delegates in their efforts to formulate legislative policies to be supported by the Pennsylvania Congress of Parents and Teachers.

Mrs. Seronsy is the wife of Dr. Cecil C. Seronsy, who is professor of English and chairman of that department at BSC. Michael E. Flanagan, a member of the Bloomsburg State College faculty for the past three years and coach of its Pennsylvania State College Conference champ- ionship track and field team of 1961 and 1962, has resigned his position here to accept one as ad- visor in health, physical education and recreation of the State Dep- artment of Public Instruction, Har- risburg. Flanagan in his three years on the local campus has made a num- ber of friends in the community and has been active as an assis- tant coach in football as well as coaching the track team for its two championship years. He succeed- ed Harold Shelley in the latter post. He said he regrets leaving Bloomsburg but that the Harris- burg position is in a field in which he has long been active. A native of Clearfield, he is a graduate of Lock Haven State Col- lege and received his Master of Education degree at the Pennsyl- vania State College. He has taken graduate work at both Springfield, Mass., College and Ithaca, N. Y., College. Flanagan came here from Bel- lefonte where he had an outstand- ing record as a wrestling coach, turning in a record of 33 wins to 19 losses in dual meets.

DR. ANDRUSS SPEAKS IN MISSISSIPPI Speaking to the Business Tea- chers of twelve states attending the Southern Business Education Association meeting in Biloxi, Mis- sissippi, Dr. Harvey A. Andruss, President of Bloomsburg State State College, in answering the question, “Where do we go from here?” pointed out that we are engaged in a struggle for survival. In international affairs, Capital- ism, in competition with Commun- ism in the field of education, must prove itself to the many new nat- ions of the world. Business teachers must prove that they can teach Economics to all high school students so that the American citizen can understand what he stands for. “Too long,” said Dr. Andruss, “we have assumed that all the Nat- ions of the world understand what we are trying to do in America in relation to earning, spending, sav- ing, and investing money.” “Business Education began in private business colleges operated for profit, became a department in the public secondary schools, and now must make a contribution to the education of all high school students through acquainting them not only with private business en- terprises operated for profit but with the management problems of corporations and the contribution which business as an institution is expected to make to the human welfare. “Until American voters and in- vestors understand their obligation to their country, their over-concern with their private pocketbook may wreck the very enterprise system which has made America great. “Business teachers can help young people to begin to think, to read newspapers intelligently, and to evaluate the claims of politicians who wish to appeal to one group or another in the productive pro- cess, when, as a matter of fact, production is a partnership invol- ving the producer, the consumer, the labor unions, the corporation, the tax payers, and government.” 1905 The address of Irma Myers Chamberlin is R. D. 2, Dallas, Pa. CAN WE DO IT? Here is what the Alumni of one of our neighboring institutions is doing: The 1962 Alumni Loyalty Fund raised $35,103 for Susquehanna University according to a joint announcement made by John S. Hendricks, director of alumni re- lations at Susquehanna, and Clyde R. Spitzner of Philadelphia, chair- man of the annual fund. The total, spurred in the last weeks of the year by a $500 gift from S.U.’s Harrisburg District Alumni Club, went just over the $35, (XX) goal for the fund and sur- passed by more than $8,000 the total of $27,066 received in 1961. Susquehanna’s Loyalty Fund gifts, by action of the Alumni As- sociation, currently are being set aside in a building fund to help finance a new gymnasium and swimming pool on the university campus at Selinsgrove. Now officially closed out, the 1962 fund represents gifts from 1,138 persons and groups, with an average gift of $30.85. The Presi- dent’s Club, with gifts of $500 or more, has a membership of 15; 143 joined the Century Club by giving $100 or more. Of the total number of donors, 1101 are S.U. alumni. This is nearly 29 percent of living alumni and compares with 57 percent participation in 1959, 13.9 percent in 1960, and 21.2 percent in 1961. The growth of Susquehanna’s an- nual fund last year won for it a $150 American Alumni Council award for improvement. The award, sponsored by American business and industry, is financed by the U. S. Steel Corporation. COUNTY BRANCHES ACTIVE The Columbia and Montour County Branches of the Alumni Association joined in sponsoring a concert by the Penn State Glee Club. The concert was presented Thursday evening, March 21. The proceeds of the concert will be used to support one of the projects of the Alumni Association. It is hoped that the success of this un- dertaking will serve as an incen- tive to other branches to follow the example of these two branches. Page 6 THE ALUMNI QUARTERLY SPRING FINE ARTS FESTIVAL AT BLOOMSBURG SC For the second consecutive year Bloomsburg State College is hav- ing a spring Fine Arts Festival, from April 30 through May 5, 1963. In recent years there has been an increasing emphasis on college campuses throughout the country on the enrichment of the academic disciplines with a variety of cultural programs, so this is one way the Fine Arts Festival Com- mittee strongly feels, in which Bloomsburg can ally itself with contemporary trends in education. Furthermore, this activity, it would seem, has a relation to the project- ed liberal arts curriculum next Fall. Included in the five-day festival las't year were an art exhibit and lecture by Emlyn Etting of Phila- delphia; performances of Moliere’s ‘School for Wives” by the Blooms- burg Players, under the direction of Miss Mary Homrighous; a dance demonstration and lecture by Mat- teo of New York City; and a con- cert by the Madrigal Singers of the college and chamber music by a trio composed of Martin Recht- man, violinist and Aaron Shapin- skv, cellist, from New York; Mil- dred Bisgrove, pianist, of the music faculty of Bloomsburg State Col- lege. The committee is doubling its efforts this year to publicize the events and to involve more stud- ents in the activities, both as par- ticipants and as spectators. This latter project will involve a pro- gram of choral music and reading selections performed by students on Sunday, May 5. All events of the festival are free and are open to the public. The alumni particularly are cordially invited to attend. The events as they have been determined to date are as follows: April 30— Art Lecture, Robert Cronauer, Carver auditorium, 2 p. m.; Gallery Talk and Tea, Dining Commons Lobby, 3-4 p. m.

The rooms, under the specifica- tions, are to be provided with pre- fabricated units of closet space, bureau and mirror and these units may be moved from one room to another. Each of the buildings will pro- vide quarters for around 250, with 125 of those in separate four-story units. In each building there is a connecting area between each unit. In the connection area are quarters for the dean and lounge; overhead there is an areaway. One of the new dormitories will be placed on the front campus, be- tween Science Hall and the World War I Memorial Pinery and the odier will be in the area of die terraces between Noetling and Science Halls and part of it will be on the edge of the grove. Plans call for the erection of a third women’s dormitory on the present site of Science Hall so that the three will provide a U shaped pattern of dormitories. The third building will have a capacity of the two dormitories soon to be constructed and will be much higher. 1899 Jennie C. Smith (Mrs. Cliton N. Guillot) is living in Bushkill, Pike County, Pa.

REMEMBER BSC IN YOUR WILL In recent years the Alumni As- sociation has been the recipient of several substantial bequests pro- vided in wills made out by Blooms- burg graduates. For the benefit of other Alumni who may be so in- clined, we suggest the following legal forms: General Bequest: “I give to the directors of the Bloomsburg State College Alumni Association, Inc., for the loan fund of the said cor- poration the sum of $ (or property described herein.)” Residuary Bequest: “All the rest, residue and remainder of my es- tate, both real and personal, I give to the Board of directors of the Bloomsburg State College Alumni Association, Inc., for the loan fund of the said corporation.” A great many students will thus be able to complete their college education. These funds are used over and over, and you will thus be able to leave behind you an everlasting memorial. 1963 St. Joseph’s Church, Danville, was the recent setting for the mar- riage of Miss Mildred Jean Eng- lish, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Delbert English, Bloomsburg R.

Kelly, a mem- ber of the Board of Trustees of the Bloomsburg State College, a mem- ber of Common Pleas Court No. 6 of Philadelphia and a native of Exeter, has been projected into the national limelight as a result of his assignment to take over the con- tempt of court proceedings against the president and city editor of The Philadelphia Bulletin, growing out of their refusal to produce rec- ords, subpoenaed by the grand jury investigating alleged City Hall corruption in Pennsylvania s largest city. The Bulletin execu- tives contend they are not required to divulge news sources under a State law. President Judge E. Gold disqual- ified himself from sitting when he was challenged by The Bulletin. The case then was turned over to Judge Kelley. Because of the widespread interest in this con- troversial matter, Judge Kelley will undertake one of the most delicate assignments of his career. Judge Kelley, a graduate of the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Class of 1920, and of the University of Pennsylvania Law School, Class of 1926, served in the Navy for four years and was admitted to the bar of Luzerne County after completing his law studies He went to Philadelphia four months later and has been there since A great deal of his career has been devoted to public service JOSEPH C.
