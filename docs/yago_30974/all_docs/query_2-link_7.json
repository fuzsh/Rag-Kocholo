Here I was very graciously used by my Lord Wentworth. For he invited me most Lord kindly to dinner to his owne table, which courtesie the very course of humanity doth injoyne me thankfully to remember. After dinner I walked with him to the Santo, where I observed divers things that I have already men tioned in my observations of Padua : as an exorcisme performed by a Priest for the expelling of the divell out of a man possessed : a monument of one of our English Earles of Devon-shire : another of Petrus Bembus, &c. I departed from Padua about two of the clocke in the [p 292.] afternoone the same day, being conducted in my way by my kinde friend Mr. George Rooke, of whom I have made mention before in my discourse of Padua, and came to a solitary house thirteene miles beyond, about seven of the clocke in the evening, where I lay that night. When I was out of Padua I observed that there are no woods, Woodt cut groves, shrubs, or any manner of trees growing neare to dov}n the citie, as there were in former times. For all of them have beene cut downe within these few yeares. I noted a singular point of policy in this. For the Venetians who are the Lords of Padua, have caused this to be done, to the end that there shall be no place of shelter for the enemies to shroude themselves in, if any should happen to approach to the citie, with an intent to assault it. All c. c. ii. i A CORYAT S CRUDITIES Guasto, a that space which is so voyd of trees, is called the Guasto, waste plot. t j lat - S) t k e waste p} ot . not because it is altogether waste and unprofitable, as bearing no commodity at all. For it beareth great store of Melons and other fruites : but because there grow no trees there. This Guasto is extended about some three miles in length, before I could come to any trees. The like Guastoes they have also about their other cities in Lombardy, &c. I departed from the solitary house about sixe of the clocke the next morning being Wednesday, and came to Vicenza about eight of the clock. The distance betwixt that house and Vicenza is five miles. [p- 2 93-] My Observations of Vicenza, in Latin Vincentia and Vicetia. Julius Cassar Scaliger hath written these verses upon Vicenza. Scaliger s T)Acche pater, Ceres alma bonae bona numina pacis, verses on Jj Quae patulos agros, qui juga curva tenes. Quid rerum, quid amicitiae cum Marte cruento Vobiscum? vestrum ut vexet utrumque furor? Pulchra racemiferos domitat Vicetia colles, Laetaque spicilegi jugera findit agri. Caedis amor, caedis germanae insana cupido : Nee patrius nato est tutus ab hoste cruor. Nusquam iter est : vastata jacent latrone protervo Ruscula, corruerunt ignibus hausta suis. Parce (nefas) scelerare manus Gens debita ccelo, Imbueque ignoto pectora digna deo. Divinae facies, regio coelestis : at hujus In coeli medio tartara dira vigent. This city was built about three hundred twenty foure yeares before Christs incarnation, by the people called Euganei, whom Antenor the Trojan expulsed from that place, where he built Padua, and not long after it was much inlarged by those Gaules that were called Galli Senones, which followed Brennus in his warres. There OBSERVATIONS OF VICENZA are two rivers that run through it, whose names are Bacchilio and Eretinus, whereof Bacchilio is the fairest, over the which are built seven bridges, partly of stone and partly of timber. On the left hand of the bridge, which leadeth into the citie from Padua, I told sixteene pretty water-mils, which are very commodious to the Water mills. citie : it is thought to be about some foure miles in com- passe with the suburbes, being seated in a plaine at the foote of the hill Bericus, and built in that manner that it representeth the figure of a Scorpion. For it extendeth [p. 294.] it selfe much more in length then breadth. And about the West end it is so slender and narrow, that it resembleth the tayle of a Scorpion : it is invironed round about with a bricke wall, wherein are eight gates : many goodly Palaces and stately buildings, both publique and private I saw in this citie. In the first street as I came in from Padua I observed a very beautiful palace of a convenient heigth, in the front whereof I read this inscription : Has aedes quanta celeritate ignis consumpsit, tanta fere M. Antonius Walmarana Stephani Equitis clarissimi films a fundamentis erexit anno M.D.XCIII. In the great market-place is erected a stately pillar of freestone of some twenty foote high with the winged Lion upon it. The Praetorium The of the citie standeth at the north side of this market-place, Pr * orium - which is a very sumptuous and magnificent building, but much inferiour to that of Padua. It is in length fifty sixe paces, and in breadth twenty two : at the higher end there is a Tribunall, above the which the winged Lyon is placed, richly gilt. Betwixt the Lyon and the Tribunall I read this inscription, written upon a ground of gold. Antonio Bernardo Juriscon. & patri optimo ob rempub. domi forisque faeliciter administratam, urbe pontibus, carcere, foro, templis exornata, Judseis & noxiis ejectis, civitate in pristinam dignitatem studiis & sanctis moribus restituta, monte Pietatis fundato, grata Vincentia posuit, M.CCCC. LXXXVI. The roofe of this Praetorium is hollow as that of Padua, having many yron beames that come athwart or a crosse from one side to the other, as that of Padua. [p. 295.] A marvellous slender tower. CORYAT S CRUDITIES The outward roofe is covered with lead. In each side above is a faire gallery adorned with goodly pillars : like wise each side beneath hath a walke garnished with marveilous faire great pillars, sixe being compacted together in one, which doe make a faire arch : of which arches there are nine: one of these lower walkes is thoroughly finished, viz. the northerne by the market place : but not that in the South side; when I was in Vicenza, they were building very diligently every day to end the same : which without doubt will be a most beautifull walke when it is once brought to perfection, and it will yeelde a great ornament to the Praetorium. So then of all these faire walkes high and low, which belong to the Palace there are foure. Also there are two or three paire of stately staires that leade up to the hall. Neare unto this Palace there is a Tower of a marveilous h^g^ as hjgn (in my opinion) as that famous Tower of Cremona or St. Markes of Venice, but so exceeding slender that I never saw any Tower in all my life so high of such a slendernesse. There are foure very memorable things to be scene in this citie : the Monastery of the Dominican Fryers, the Palace of the Count or Earle Leonardus Walmarana, his Garden neare to the west gate that leadeth to Verona, and The monastery a famous Theater, built anno M.D.LXXXIIII. In the Monastery of the Dominican Friers is to be seene the thorny crowne of our Saviour Jesus Christ (as they say) which St. Lewes King of France, anno 1259. bestowed upon his brother at Paris, who hapned afterward to be Bishop of Vicenza, and a Dominican Frier. They report that he was the man that bestowed this crowne upon the Monastery. In my notes of Paris I have written something of this crown. For in Paris they say that they have the thorny crown : and here in Vicenza the Dominicans most constantly affirme, that none hath it or can have it but themselves : eyther they must prove that Christ had two severall crowns of thornes put upon his head (which is contrary to the history of the Evangelists) or else it must of the Dominican Friars. OBSERVATIONS OF VICENZA needes follow that one of these crownes is false. Never- thelesse I went thither to see it for my mindes sake, but I could not possibly obtaine the favour, though the Friers otherwise used me very courteously, affirming that it was never shewed to any man whatsoever but upon Corpus [p. 296.] Christi day, and that it was kept under three locks. One of the Monkes shewed me a very memorable thing in this Monastery. For he brought me into their kitchin, and Themonastery told me, that where the chimney is, even where their meate is wont to be rosted and sodde, certain Arrians heretofore lived, their principall Master reading from a chaire that stood in the same place, the Arrian doctrine to his disciples and followers : but at last the holy Bishop Bartholomew (of whom I have already spoken) chaced them out of the Citie, and in their roome placed the Dominicans. The Palace of the Earle Leonardus Walmarana seemeth Earl to be a very magnificent building, if the inside be cor- Le&lt; f ard s } i r T- i c palace. respondent to the front next to the street, ror that tront is very beautifull, having much pointed diamond worke about the bottome, and about the toppe many prety histories curiously cut in stone. Under one history is written, Ars superat naturam : under another where grey hounds are most exquisitely carved, these two Greeke wordes are written /caXA/?ro? TTOVCOV, whereby is meant that hunting is the most generose and noble exercise of all others. Both these emblemes are made on the right hand as you go into the house. On the left hand this under a fine historicall worke. Ubi periculum, ibi festinandum. Againe over the dore this noble and most remarkable inscription is written very faire in stone : Maria Austria Augusta, Caroli Quinti, Maximiliani Secundi, Rodolphi Secundi Imperatorum filia, uxor, mater, a Philippo fratre Hispaniarum Rege Potentisimo, ad regendum Lusitanorum quondam Regum Imperium nuper partum, e Germania accita per Italiam iter faciens, in his aedibus, quod ipsa ob veterem Austriacorum Principum erga hanc domum clientelam maxime volvit, cum Mar- 5 CORYAT S CRUDITIES garita Maximilianoque filiis Archiducibus, a Leonardo Walmarana Comite eodemque Philippi Regis Pension- ario, splendidissimo apparatu accepta ftiit. Anno. M.D. LXXXI. IV. Kal. Octobris. [ P . 297.] The third is the Garden of the foresaid Earle Leonardus, Earl , which is so delectable and pleasant that it seemeth a second garden Paradise. At the entrance of it over the first gate I read this inscription in Capital] letters. Civis. Amice. Advena. Qui loci amcenitate cupis oblectarier, Securus hue ingredere, Teque largiter recrea. Nullus intus canis, nullus Draco ; Nullus falce minaci Deus. Omnia sed tuta, benigneque Exposita. Sic volvit Comes Leonardus Walmarana Hortorum Dominus, Modestiam quod tuam & Con- tinentiam Custodem fore fi- dat optimum. Anno M.D.XCII. After I came into the garden I turned on the right hand, and descended into a very pleasant and delicious walke, The second at the entrance whereof I read this second inscription made inscription. j n stone over a f a i re g a fe. Si te imprudentem graviores Forte Hue usque insequutse sunt Curae, Eas velint nolint procul Nunc ut abeant facito. Hilaritati namque & Genio Pars haec potiss. dicata est. Againe, having passed through that gate and walke which was but short, I entred into a third walke of a notable length (for it was at the least two hundred paces 6 OBSERVATIONS OF VICENZA long) beset with most delightfull trees on both sides. At the entrance of this walke there standeth another stately gate, over the which I read this third inscription, which The third indeede is most witty and elegant. Cedros hosce qui dempserit, [p. 298.] Floresve carpserit, Is Sacrilegus esto ; Vertumnoque & Pomona^, Queis sunt sacri, Poenas luito. In both sides of this walke I saw Cedar trees, Orange, Fruit trees. Lemmon, and Pome-citron trees, and fruits of all these kindes ripe. Amongst the rest I observed passing faire Citrons, which made my mouth even water upon them, and caused me almost to transgresse his law. One side of the walke is invironed with a goodly wall, by the which the fruits doe grow. About the middle of the walke there is built a prety convenient house, wherein tame connies and divers sorts of fine birds are kept, as Turtles, &c. In the middle of the garden is built a faire round roofe, supported with eight stately pillars of white stone, it is said that it shall be all covered with lead, but it was not when I was there. Also I saw a fine Labyrinth made A fine of boxe, but the dore was locked that I could not get in. l a h nnth f And many lofty Pine trees, but some of them were so ox nipped with the cold frost and snow that fell the winter before, as those were in the king of Frances garden at the Tuilleries, that they were even starved. Also for the more addition of pleasure to the place, there is a sweet river full of fine fish running by that fruitfull walke, wherehence is ministred store of water to moisten the garden in time of drougth. Finally to conclude, such is the affluence of all delights and pleasures in this garden, that it is the most peerelesse and incomparable plot for the quantity that ever I saw. The fourth and last memorable thing of this City is a The Theatre stately faire Theater, which was built by certaine Scholars f Vlcenza - 7 [p. 299.] Muscovite Ambassadors entertained. Japanese noblemen. Inscription in the Theatre. CORYAT S CRUDITIES in the yeare M.D.lxxxiiii. that were called Academici Olympici, but why so called I know not. It hath an Orchestra made in it according to the imitation of the Roman Orchestraes, which is at the lower end of the degrees, or (as I may more properly terme them) benches or seates, whereof there are fourteene, each above another, compassing something more then halfe the Theater, and contrived in the fashion of an halfe Moone. In that Orchestra none sit but Noble and eminent persons. He that shewed me this Theater told me that the Orchestra and fourteen benches would containe about some three thousand persons. The Scene also is a very faire and beautifull place to behold. In this Theater was acted a play for many yeares since with divers goodly shewes before William Gonzaga Duke of Mantua, father to the present Duke Vincentius Gonzaga. Againe, afterward certaine Moscovite Ambassadors that came from Rome, were very honourably entertained in this Theater with musicke and a banquet. And after them certaine young Noblemen of that farre remote region in the East called Japan or Japona, being descended of the bloud royall of the Country, were received here with great state, at what time Livius Pajellus a singular Orator pronounced an eloquent Oration in praise of them. But one of the latest great shewes that was made here was presented before the forenamed that famous Earle Leonardus Walmarana, in the yeare 1585. For at that time the Tragedy of Sophocles, which is intituled Oedipus, was most excellently acted in this Theater. The history of the acting whereof is finely painted in the Court wal at the very entrance to the Theater. Over the three dores of which Court I read these three inscriptions, written in Capitall letters. This over the first. Olympicis Excitamento. This over the second. Civibus Oblectamento. And this over the third. Patriae ornamento. 8 OBSERVATIONS OF VICENZA In the front of the Scene, directly opposite to the [p. 300.] Orchestra, this is written : Virtuti ac Genio Olympicorum Academia Theatrum hoc a funda- mentis erexit, Anno M. D. LXXX. IIII Andrea Palladio Architecto. Without the City also are two most stately and goodly things to be seene. Whereof the first is a very magnificent arch built about the end of the City, southward as you goe up to the hill Bericus. The other is the Palace of Tfie P alace f x r / s~\\ j * the Earle Odoricus Capra. The arch certainly is a very sumptuous monument being of a lofty heigth, and sup ported with foure portly marble pillars, two on one side, and as many on the other. At the top standeth the winged Lyon in white stone, and at both the endes of the toppe two statues also of white stone are erected. In the front of the outside of the arch, this is written under the Lyon. Deiparae Virgini Berici Montis Jacobus Bragadeno Am- bross. F. Prsef. Religionis & urbis amantiss. D. M. D. XCV. After I was entred within this arch, I ascended a mar- Marvellous vailous high paire of staires, much higher then those that hl & h stam - 1 have mentioned in my description of Lyons. For they are of that heigth that they will make a weake body utterly weary before he can attaine to the toppe. For they con- taine no lesse then a hundred and fifty greeses. And you must ascend by five greeses at a place till you come to the toppe, the severall partitions being in number thirty. Truly they are the highest staires that ever I trode in my life out of a Church or house. At the left hand of the [p. 301.] 9 CORYAT S CRUDITIES ascent a little after I was entred within the arch, I read this inscription in a stony pillar. Quis ascendet in montem sanctum tuum? In another pillar on the right hand, this : Innocens manibus & mundo corde. After I was come almost to the toppe, I found this inscription in a stony pillar on the left hand. Franciscus Bernardinus Saracenus Scalas fecit ex stipe publice privatimque Collata, & viam reliquam ad Mariae templum usque silice promovit. c I D IDC. And this inscription in another stony pillar on the right hand. Hospes si properas, Paulum sistito, Urbis, collium, fluminum, Agrorum, Alpium aspectu Laborem lenito. Abi. perge pius, Dei matrem Virginem Salutato. Stratae vise commodum Piis precibus rependito. T t ^ v-Jln^ A ^ ter I had ascended those staires I went to the Temple of the Virgin Mary, seated upon the toppe of the hil, and about a mile distant from the City. All the Monkes that dwell here are meerely lay-men. In the Moneth of August when I was there, this Monastery was exceedingly frequented with people, and so it is every yeare in the same Moneth. For they hold this opinion and doe very 10 OBSERVATIONS OF VICENZA confidently maintayne it, that by the prayers which godly [p. 302.] people doe make in the Church of that Monastery that Moneth, one soule shall be redeemed out of Purgatory forsooth. Infinite are the votive tables that I saw hanged about the walles of this Church. I saw many indeede at the Altar where our Lady is worshipped at the Arsenal, and in other places of Venice, but never a quarter so many in one place as here. I walked into the Cloyster of the Monks, and into a high gallery at the toppe of the Monas tery, where they have a passing sweet prospect. Surely they dwell in as convenient a place for a retired life as any I saw in Italy, nay none comparable to it. They say that many miracles are shewed in this Monastery. The other memorable thing without the City, is the sumptuous Palace of the above named Earle Odoricus Capra, which is a little mile distant from the City. It is built upon a prety eminent hillocke, and is round (in which respect it is called in the Italian Rotonda) having foure very beautifull fronts, which doe answere the foure parts of the world. At the East front as I ascended to The arms f the house, I saw three white statues erected, and under Earl Odortc - them the picture of a blacke Goate which is his armes. Under the which I read this. Scriptum Memoriae perpetuae Mandans hasc Dum sustinet & abstinet. At the West end under another scutchin this is written. Qui asdes has arctissimo Primogeniturae gradui Subjecit. At the North side this under a third scutchin. Una cum omnibus censibus, Agris, vallibus, & collibus Ultra viam magnam. ii CORYAT S CRUDITIES [p- 33-] In the South side this under the fourth scutchin. Marius Capra Gabrielis F. Every front hath sixe most stately great pillars, and two paire of staires to ascend to the same, each contayning eighteene faire greeses. The roofe of the house is round, and very pretily adorned partly with curious pictures, and partly with statues, which worke was contrived by the An open roof, elegant pensill of Alexander Magantia. Also the roofe is open for the raine to descend into a very convenient place made of purpose in the hall for the receiving thereof. In one of the higher chambers there is the fairest chimney for clavy and jeames that ever I saw, saving that of the King of France at his Palace of Fountaine Beleau before mentioned. For it was made of an extraordinary fine coloured marble, beautified with faire veines of divers colours. This marble came from Verona. In another chamber I saw a clavy and jeames of touch stone, and a A stately table boord of the same : also there is a stately celler under cellar. ^ e Palace, the roofe whereof is vaulted. At the farther end of this cellar as you go forth of it into a faire vineyard, this impresse is written over the dore in great letters. Antrum non Cumaeum Neque Homericum videbis, Sed Bacchi ; Hospes ingredere, Laetior abibis ; But I found not the words of the inscription true ; for I went not out more merily then I came in, because the cellarer had not the honestie to bestowe as much as one draught of his wine upon me. The Bishop* \\ was at the Palace of the Bishop of Vicenza whose Palace. name is Dionysius Delphinus. In this Palace is the towne prison. This City was much annoied by the army of that [p. 304.] mercilesse Barbarian Attila, with many other famous cities 12 OBSERVATIONS OF VICENZA of Italy, after hee came out of his country of Scythia to spoyle the Europcean Cities. Also the Emperour Fredericke the second besieged it about the year a thousand two hundred and forty, and afterward having entred it by force of armes, he defaced a great part of it with the furie of the fire. For the sight of most of these notable things that I enjoyed in this faire citie, I doe acknowledge my self exceedingly beholding to two Italian yong Gentlemen Tu t that were Vicentines borne, whose names were Thomas ta \"? n de Spanivellis, and Joannes Nicoletis ; especially to one of them, who kept me company almost all that day that I spent there, and conducted me from place to place till he had shewed me all the principall things of the citie. For surely many Italians are passing courteous and kinde towards strangers, of whose humanitie I made triall in divers other cities in Italic, as Padua, Venice, Verona, Brixia, Bergomo, &c. Therefore I will ever magnifie and extoll the Italian for as courteous a man to a stranger as any man whatsoever in Christendome. For I have had a little experience in my travels of some of every principall nation of Christendome. The first that converted this Citie from Paganisme to Christianitie, was Prosdocimus that preached the Gospell first at Padua, as I have before mentioned. The Vicentines were first subject to the Signiorie of Venice about the yeare 1404. at what time they submitted themselves of their own accord to the Venetians. That day that I came forth of Vicenza, being Thursday and the eleventh day of August, I saw a franticke and 4 frantic lunaticke fellow runne up and downe the citie with a lunat lc - gowne about him, who kept a very furious stirre, and drew many people about him. The West gate of the Citie that leadeth to Verona, hath a very lofty Towre of a goodly heigth, and without [p. 305.] the same on the left hand, I saw a marvailous sumptuous gate made of free-stone, and newly built, but not fully finished. All the front is contrived with pointed diamond 13 CORYAT S CRUDITIES worke. At that place there is nothing at all built but only this gate. This charge me thinkes might have beene well saved, for it serves for no other purpose but onely for a beautifull entrance into a faire meadow. Vicenza \\ w iH now conclude my observations of Vicenza with famous for two memora bl e Italian sayings, the one of the Counts and counts and T r i r TT- L- t. *.(. faints Knights or Vicenza, which is this : Quanti ha Venetia ponti e Gondolieri, Tanti ha Vicenza Conti e Cavallieri. That is, looke how many bridges and Gondoleers Venice doth yeeld, so many Counts, and Knights doth Vicenza.

Departed from Vicenza about tenne a clocke in the morning, the eleventh day of August being Thursday, and came to Verona the next day about nine of the clocke in the morning : The things that I observed bewixt Armed Vicenza and Verona are these. Most of the horsemen horsemen t j iat j met were fu rn i s hed with muskets ready charged, Vicenza and an ^ touch-boxes hanging by their sides full of Gunpowder, Verona. together with little pouches full of bullets ; which is a [p. 306.] thing so commonly used in most places of Italie, that a man shall scarce finde a horseman in any place riding without them. I heard that this is the reason of it : because the people of the country are so given to villainies, 14 I FROM VICENZA TO VERONA that they will rob, rifle, and murder passengers, if they are not sufficiently provided to defend themselves against them. At every miles end by the way for the space of tenne or twelve miles, I saw certaine prety stony pillars* Pillars erected erected by the high way side, such as we call in Latin h thewa ? de - cippos, whereof some had Inscriptions, some had not, which I suppose were set up for many yeares since, even in the time of the Roman Monarchic to limit their miles. whereupon many auncient Latin authors whensoever they would mention a place of Italic distant certaine miles from a citie, would say, decimo &c lapide ab urbe distat. Some of the Inscriptions of these pillars were so auncient and even eaten out with time, that I could hardly reade above two or three letters of them : Perhaps they were set up before, or not long after, Christs incarnation. Againe some had crosses on them as being erected by Christians. On the right hand as I travelled to Verona, I saw three very stately and strong castels upon hils, adorned with goodly battlements, &c. whereof one, which stood almost in the middle way betwixt Vicenza and Verona, was built by the Princely familie of the Scaligers of Verona, as a certaine grave Gentleman tolde me that I overtooke riding upon the way, who discoursed with me very familiarly of many matters in Latin : the same castle is now possessed by the noble Contarens of Venice. The territories of Vicenza and Verona doe confine and meete together about a place called Turre, which is but Turre. one solitarie inne, so called because the signe thereof is a tower. This is thirteene miles beyond Vicenza. About [p. 307.] nine miles on this side Verona I sawe a most magnificent Palace not about half a mile distant from the way on the left hand. I was told that it belonged to a Venetian Clarissimo, called Peter Gritti.

I observed great abundance of vineyardes on both sides of the way, and exceeding fertile Champaines, goodly meadowes, pastures, corne fieldes, and arable groundes both betwixt Padua & Vicenza, & also betwixt Vicenza and Verona. Onely I saw one speciall commodity want ing, wherwith (God be thanked) England is so abundantly furnished, as no place (I think) in al Christendome more, being indeed a thing exceeding necessary for the sustenta- tion of mans life, as any other thing whatsoever that God hath given unto man, viz. sheepe. For I remember I saw but three little flockes in all the way betwixt Padua, and Verona, which are forty eight miles distant. Within a mile of Verona on the left hand of the way there is a faire little Monastery that belongeth to the order of those Monkes that are called Camaldulenses, which doe weare white gownes and cowles of the same. There are but eight of the Fraternity, their Church is very Faire, and they have a Cloyster that invironeth almost their whole Monastery, round about adorned with many beauti- full pillars, whereof I told twenty eight of a great bignesse. My Observations of Verona. Julius Caesar Scaliger hath written these verses upon Verona. ITalics canimus semper florentis ocellum, Calliope nequeat grandius ulla loqui. Aucta deis, auctura poli Verona Quirites ; Quot cives, tot habens sydera digna Jove. Non animi, non ingenii vigor acrior usquam, Nulla creat plures Martia terra duces. Transferre in coelum volvit sibi Jupiter, atqui Clarior in nostris malvit esse locis. The antiquity This citie is of that antiquitie, that some do write it was first founded by the ancient Hetruscans and hath 16 [p. 308.] Sca/iger s verses upon Verona. OBSERVATIONS OF VERONA beene in times past accounted one of their twelve cities on this side the Apennine mountaines. But afterwards in processe of time, the Gaules that are called Senones, having passed over the Alpes under the conduct of their Captaine Brennus, came into this part of Italy, and ejected those Hetruscans out of the possession thereof, and greatly amplified and enlarged the same. So that it was called Verona quasi Brenona, from their Captaine Brennus. But there are some that write, that it had the denomination of Verona from Vera, the name of a noble familie amongst the Hetruscans. Surely it is a very delectable, large, and populous citie, and most sweetely seated : for the noble river Athesis runneth by it which Virgil calleth amcenus, as Athesin ceu propter amcenum. nver It issueth out of the Alpes not far from the city of Trent. This river yeeldeth a speciall commoditie to the citie. . For although it be not able to beare vessels of a great burden, yet it carrieth prety barges of convenient quan- titie, wherein great store of Merchandise is brought unto [p- 39-] the city, both out of Germany and from Venice it selfe. In one side of this river, I told nineteene water-mils, which were like to those that I saw upon the river Rhodanus at the city of Lyons. There are foure bridges which joyne together both the bankes of the river, whereof one is very faire and beautifull above the rest. By the sides of that bridge that I passed over when I entred into the city from Vicenza, I observed two faire stones of white marble SfonfJ0 fwh(e opposite to each other, with armes and scutchins in them : in that which is on the right hand I saw this inscription. Qui fluminis vim passus annos plures jacuerat, Civitatis ornamento, & commodo Pons tandem est restitutus. c. c. n. 17 B CORYAT S CRUDITIES And under the same this : Andrea Gritti Principe, Francisco Foscaro Praetore, & Hieronymo Zano prefecto. an. Salutis M.DXXIX. In that on the left hand this : Fluminis impetu disjectum pontem diligentia Joannis TEmi Praetoris pene restitutum, Francisci Foscari Successoris cura perfecit. Also I noted a third stone of white marble, in which are written certaine auncient characters of that antiquity that I thinke no man can reade them ; because indeede they are partly defaced. A certain Italian young Gentleman, unto whom I was much beholding for the sight of many noble antiquities of this citie, told me that this river The Inunda- Athesis doth sometimes so extremely swell, that it hath tions of t e utterly overwhelmed all the bridges, and much annoyed the citie. For testimony whereof he shewed me this [p. 3 10 -] memorable inscription written in the corner of a certaine wall not farre from the river, which mentioneth a very strange and unusuall inundation thereof. Viator haec hie tabula posita est ut perpetuo sciri possit summas nostri fluminis aquas hue usque pertigisse. die xxx. Octobris anno M. D. L xvii. & siccitate & diluviis infausto. This Table is placed about twenty foote higher then the bridge, according to my estimation, which argueth so strange an inundation of the Athesis, that I doe not 18 OBSERVATIONS OF VERONA remember I ever read of the like, saving once of the Tyber in the time of the Emperour Mauricius when S. Gregory was Pope. For then the Tyber so far exceeded his usuall bounds, that he overflowed the very walles of Rome. The forme of the building of this citie is something like to that of Turin in Piemont : for it is almost square. The greatest part of it standeth in a plaine, and some part of it that bendeth to the South, is situate upon a hill, whereon are built two stately Castles, the one of S. Fselix, the other the Castles of of S. Angelo ; also it hath one more in the plain that standeth neare to the river : that of St. Felix is invironed with a faire bricke wall, which is adorned with battlements that yeeld so faire a shew, that from the west it is scene a great way off. All these Castles, especially those two on the hill, are passing well furnished with munition and artillery for the defence of the citie against the invasion of the enemy. The wals of the citie are the fayrest of all the TAe walh artd Italian cities that I saw, and indeede fayrer then any I ever & a saw before in all my life. For they are of a marveilous heigth, in some places forty foot high, according to my [p. 311.] estimation, built all with bricke, and fairely beautified with battlements. Also there are rive gates in them of great antiquity, whereof some are garnished with curious carvings, images, and marble pillars. The compasse of the whole citie together with the suburbes is thought to be betwixt sixe and seven miles. Within these few yeares it is become very strong ; for the Venetians doe daily strengthen it with wonderfull strong fortifications, ram- piers, and bulwarkes, which they have incompassed with deepe and broad Trenches, so that it seemeth to be almost impregnable. So many notable antiquities and memorable monuments are to be scene in this noble city of Verona, as no Italian citie whatsoever (Rome excepted) can shew the like. But the worthiest and most remarkable of all is the Amphi- The theater commonly called the Arena, seated at the South- am P hitheatre west end of the city where cattell are sold ; whereof I Amphi- ^ulltb^th Athenians, [p. 3 12 -] Venma CORYAT S CRUDITIES have expressed a picture in this place, according to the forme of it, as it flourished in the time of the Roman Monarchy. This word Amphitheater is derived from these two Greeke words a/ufa which signifieth about, and Oew/mai to behold, because which way soever a man doth view it, he findeth it of a circular and round forme. So that herein an Amphitheater differeth from a Theater, because an Amphitheater is every where round, but a Theater (according to the forme of the auncient Roman building) is but halfe round, being made in the fashion of an halfe circle or halfe Moone. The model of these kinde of Amphitheaters which the auncient Romanes built in Rome, and other places of Italy, was derived from the Athenians, who were the first that erected an Amphi- tneater - Certainly this present building, whereof I now speak, is a most stupendious masse of worke ; Non opus, at moles, qualem neque tota vetustas vidit, & haec aetas non habitura parem ; To use those verses of it that one wrote in praise of the King of Spaines Palace at Escuriall in Spaine. For indeed it is such an admirable Fabricke that it draweth all strangers into admiration thereof : and I am perswaded that the beauty thereof after it was first built and throughly consummated, was so glorious, that it no lesse drew spectators from most of the principall places of the world to contemplate the excellency thereof, then that famous Temple of Vespasian in Rome, dedicated to Pallas, which is so highly commended by Josephus the Jew. It was reported unto me by Gentlemen of good note in this citie of Verona, that the like Amphitheater is not to be seene at this day in all Italy, no not in Rome it selfe. Neyther doe I thinke that antiquity could ever shew a fayrer piece o f WO rke for an Amphitheater ; but it is very ruinous at this time \" For the P^ncipall ornaments thereof are * 1*11 1 1 /* * f&gt; demolished and defaced. So that it hath lost more then halfe of its pristine glory: it is uncertaine who was the first founder thereof. That it was built by one of the 20 OBSERVATIONS OF VERONA Roman Emperours every man beleeveth, but by whom no Chronicle, Annals, or auncient History doth certainly record. But Torellas Sariana, a learned man borne in Verona, who hath written certaine bookes of the antiqui ties of this citie, is drawen by certaine arguments and conjectures to affirme, that it was built by the Emperour Augustus, and that in the two and fortieth year of his Empire, which was that very year that our blessed Saviour was borne into the world. Were such a building to be made in England, I thinke it would cost at the least two millions of our pounds, that is, twenty hundred thousand pound, even as much as tenne of our fayrest Cathedrall Churches. For it is all built with redde marble : which Red marble. although it were a very chargeable piece of workemanship ; yet they could build it as cheape there as in any part of al Italy. For in the territory of Verona they have divers marble quarries, and that of sundry colours, as white, blacke, redde, &c. It was dedicated to Janus, and hath as [p. 313.] yet many notable things to be seene, which do argue the singular beauty thereof when it flourished in his prime. For it was invironed with two round walles, whereof the outward was a thing of rare magnificence. Which by the invasion of many barbarous people, as the Gothes, Hunnes, (who under the conduct of their King Attila sacked this city) and Longobards under their King The Alboinus, hath beene so ruinated, that there is but a little a P h ttheatre part thereof standing, the marble stones being pulled ^the^ downe, and removed therehence, partly for the garnishing barbarians. of the private houses of the city, and partly for other uses. This, together with all the other partes of the machine, was built with redde marble, all the pieces being cut square which doe very excellently garnish the worke. That which remaineth at this day of the outward wall, though it be but little, doth testifie that it was a wondrous architecture. For there are now standing three rankes or rowes of arches, and each row doth containe three severall degrees of arches more, built one above another, and raised to a wonderful heigth, at the least one hundred and 21 CORYAT S CRUDITIES The arches. fifty foot high, according to my estimation. These arches were heretofore distinguished with stately pillars of redde marble answerable to the rest : and the highest degree of the third was most gloriously beautified with faire statues made of Corinthian worke, which were placed betwixt the pillars and the arches; every arch having two severall statues, so that to double the number of the arches, which are in al seventy, there were erected one hundred forty two statues : which yeelded a passing ornament to the wall. Again, these three degrees of arches were built of as many distinct formes of workmanship, namely the Corinthian, the lonicke and the Doricke. Also above these foresaid degrees there was a fourth ranke of building, which was erected at the very toppe of all, viz. a degree of windowes made all open, without either glasse or any other thing in [p. 314.] it. These corresponded the number of the arches, even seventy two, and served for the people to sit in, to the end they might the more conveniently behold the games The outer and anc [ exercises in the Amphitheater. All this outward wal, whereof now there is but a little fragment left, onely those three ranks of three severall arches that I have already mentioned, did round about inviron the whole building (as I have before said) being some twenty foote distant from the inner wal. But the inner wal it selfe doth stand prety well, and yeeldeth a most stately shew, though some parts of the toppe be something blemished. For all the arches doe as yet remaine, even seventy two ; for I walked round about them, and tolde them all. Now whereas of the outward wal there were three degrees of arches, there are not above two in this outward wall, which stand directly one above another, so that the number of those above doth answere them beneath. And for the better grace of the worke there is inserted betwixt every arch a goodly pillar of red marble, the base whereof being made of the same matter, is five foot thicke, and the distance betwixt every couple of pillars is sixteene foote. The lower arches are now converted to very base and sordid uses. For they serve partly for stables to put horses and hay in, and partly 22 OBSERVATIONS OF VERONA for tipling houses for poore folkes to sell wine in, and other necessaries. After I had exactly viewed all the outward parts, I was admitted into the inside by a fellow that gets his living altogether by shewing the same to strangers, and as soone as I came in, 1 was driven into great admiration. For I saw so many things as will make a stranger not a little wonder. There I observed the seates, or benches, made of redde marble, incompassing Benches of red the cavea, or plaine within it round about, and ascending mat e by degrees one above another to the very toppe, which are in number forty two : but the greatest part of the marble of these benches hath beene (to the great blemish of the work) carried away for many yeares since by those [p. 315.] barbarous people that have much eclipsed the glorious beauty of this building. Yet the gentlemen of Verona have within these few yeares something repayred it againe. For they have bestowed so great charges in mending them on both sides with new marble benches correspondent to the former, that those on the right hand cost them three score thousand crownes, and those on the left sixe thou sand, as a Gentleman of Verona told me that shewed me the particulars of the Amphitheater. These threescore Great charges and sixe thousand crownes being not the fiftieth part of f o the charge (as I thinke) that the whole building would cost, were it now to be built from the foundation, may give a man some conjecture what an infinite and excessive masse of money it cost in those dayes when it was first founded, though I beleeve their building was then much cheaper then now. Also these Gentlemen of Verona doe daily beautifie it with new addition of marble benches, because they have oftentimes great shewes exhibited here to the people upon festivall dayes, as running at Tilt, and other noble exercises, especially upon their Carnivall day, which is observed amongst them in the same manner as our Shrove-tuesday with us in England, being called Carnivall from the two Latin words, Caro and Vale, that is, farewell flesh, because after that day they eate no more flesh till Easter. These foresaid two and forty benches have in 2 3 The benches contained CORYAT S CRUDITIES former times contained three and twenty thousand people that were the spectators of the games played therein, a foote and halfe and no more being limited to every particular person. The higher bench is esteemed a hun dred fourescore and three pearches in compasse, and that in the middle, namely the one and twentieth, a hundred and two and forty. Every pearch being ten foote long. Likewise from north to south it is thought to be three hundred and threescore foote long : and from east to west three hundred and forty foote broad. All that open and [p. 316.] void space at the toppe was wont to be covered over wholly with curtaynes at the time of their publique games, to the end to keepe off the scorching heate of the sunne, which otherwise would very much annoy the people. The galleries in the inside are contrived after a very strange manner, not unlike unto Labyrinths. For there are three degrees of them vaulted one above another, through the which both those that were above upon the benches did descend to goe forth of the roome, and they beneath The rooms for asC ended to their seates. Also I observed certaine roomes the beasts. wnere the beasts were kept, with whom the Gladiatores were to fight. These roomes have at one end certaine little open places to let in the aire for the refreshing of the beasts, such as we call in Latin spiracula. The cavea or greene plaine in the middle is made in the forme of an egge, sharpe at the ends, and broade at the sides, very like to a pond that I have scene in one of Sir Francis Carewes gardens in Middlesex : and it is in length nine & thirty pearches, in bredth two and twenty and halfe. For I did exactly observe the length and bredth of it. Now it is divided in the very middest by a certaine kind of pale, like to that of our Tilt-yard at Whitehall, where the Venetian Gentlemen and Nobleman of Verona doe sometimes encounter at justs and tornaments. In the middest of this plaine divers spectacles and games were wont to be shewed in former times to the people, whereof some con- Bloody fights, sisted especially of a most bloudy kind of fight betwixt men and beasts, which was performed by their Gladiatores. 24 C( 2 OBSERVATIONS OF VERONA For according to the auncient custome of the Romans certaine enormous malefactors that had committed some capital crimes, being condemned to fight for their lives with wilde beasts^ were in this place and such other (whereof Rome had many, as the Circus maximus, &c.) exposed with their swordes and targets, and such other weapons to the fury of savage beasts, as Lyons, Beares, Tigres, &c. if fortune favoured them so well that they slew [p. 31 7-] those beasts, then both their lives were saved, and also they had some reward bestowed upon them, which was commonly called brabium, in token of their victory. But if they were slaine by the beasts, it was esteemed as a just recompence for their wicked deserts. But to conclude this discription of the Amphitheater of Verona, it is a worke of such admirable magnificence that as I never saw the like before, so 1 thinke in al my future travels (which I deter mine God willing to undertake hereafter both in Christen- dome and Paganisme) I shall never see a fairer. Thus much concerning the Amphitheater. ALso I saw the rudera of an auncient Theater which was ^ ancient a distinct building from the foresaid Amphitheater, theatre - upon a hill on the farther side of the Athesis, neare to the gardens of the Dominican Friers. The Palace which doth now belong to the Capitano, was ^ he Palace of heretofore the habitation of the Princely Scaligers : at the Verona - left hand of the porch whereof, which is a very magnificent and stately building, are three very faire arches made with free stone, and adorned with diamond worke. In the front of this building which is newly built, & looketh towards that goodly walke where there is a great meeting of Gentle men and Merchants twise a day, this inscription is written over a dore betwixt two scutchins. Regia hujus superi- orem utramque partem longa incuria ruinam ita minitan- tem, ut pene reparationis desperationem cunctis adferret, Justinianus Contarenus Prastor, Franciscus Priulus Prae- fectus ab extremo vindicarunt occasu, & in longe splendi- diorem faciem pristina restituerunt c I o.

Great store of j n a lower roome which is on the right hand of the court as you come in from the street, I observed great store of munition, especially great pieces of Ordinance upon wheeles, and lesser, as sakers, &c. that roome being wholly replenished with furniture for war-fare. The Piazza. The Piazza or the publike walke without the Palace is a faire place, paved al with bricke. In length it is three score and seven paces : in bredth five and forty. And it is on every side inclosed with goodly buildings. At the East with the Praetors Palace, at the West with a certaine goodly auncient building that serveth for publique uses. At the South with the Praefectus Palace, at the North with the Councell house, which is a very faire building, having foure beautifull windowes in the front, and a goodly walke 26 OBSERVATIONS OF VERONA adorned with nine stately pillars of blew and porphyrie marble that make eight faire arches. Over the gate of the Councell house this inscription is written above two golden scutchins: Ubique simul. [p. 319-] And againe, this under the same in golden letters upon an azure ground. p ro summ a fide Summus amor, M. D. XCII. Also the higher part of the front is garnished with five F lve beautiful beautiful marble statues of certaine famous learned men borne in this noble City, who with the excellent monu ments of their wit have much ennobled their Country. The first is of Marcus Vitruvius, who hath written ten bookes of Architecture, being next to the Palace wall of the Praetor. Next to him, Valerius Catullus the Poet. The third Caius Plinius the Historiographer. The fourth ^mylius Macer the Poet that wrote certaine poems of hearbes. The last, Cornelius Nepos an eloquent Poet in the time of Cicero. Also there is another of Hieronymus Fracastorius, erected over a stately arch that standeth at the west end of the Councell house. I saw the monuments of two of the noble Scaligers of Monuments of Verona in a little Churchyard, adjoyning to the Church the called Maria Antiqua, but a little way distant from that Palace, where they lived in former times, which now belongeth to the Venetian Capitano, as I have before said. The fairest whereof is that of Mastinus Scaliger, standing at one corner of the Churchyard, which is such an exceed ing sumptuous Mausoleum that I saw not the like in Italy. It is supported with sixe stately pillars of porphyrie marble, without the which are sixe sumptuous pillars more very curiously wrought with prety works and borders. At the toppe of which outward pillars are certaine little pinnacles, each whereof sustaineth an image of an armed man made in alabaster. Also above those sixe pillars there is a marvailous rich worke made of alabaster, whereon 27 CORYAT S CRUDITIES [p. 320.] Mastinus Scaliger. Magnus Scaliger. The possessors of Verona. S there stand more images very exquisitely carved. Upon the toppe of all, even upon a little pinnacle standeth the statue of Mastinus Scaliger himselfe on horsebacke made of alabaster. It doth very neare represent the living shape of him. For it is said that it was made in his life time. In the lower part of the monument this Epitaph is written. iCaligera de gente fui, celebrique ferebar Nomine Mastinus, claras dominabar in urbes. Me Dominum Verona suum, me Brixia vidit, Parmaque cum Luca, cum Feltro Marchia tota. Jura dabam populis aequo libramine nostris Omnibus, & fidei, & Christi, sine sorde secutor. Occubui primo post annos mille trecentos Et decies quinque, heu, lux ibat tertia Juni. The other monument is of Canis Grandis, or Magnus Scaliger, which standeth in another corner of the same Churchyard right opposite unto this, the same being a very magnificent thing adorned with many pillars and statues of marble, but something inferiour to this. There also is this Epitaph. ;I Canis hie grandis ingentia facta peregit, Marchia testis adest quam saevo Marte subegit, Scaligeram qui laude domum super astra tulisset, Majores si Parca dies infida tulisset : Hunc Julii geminata dies undena peremit, Jam lapsis septem quater annis mille trecentis. Also there is a third monument of another Scaliger Prince, called Canis Signorius ; which is erected directly over the Church dore, the Epitaph whereof I could not perfectly reade. This City in the time of the Roman Monarchy was a long time subject to the Romans. Afterward it was pos sessed by the Ostrogothes, and after them by the Longobardes, whose first King Alboinus kept his Court here. At last they gave place to the successors of Carolus Magnus, as Pipin his sonne, Prince Berengarius and 28 S OBSERVATIONS OF VERONA others, that kept their Court here. After them, it came [p. 3 21 -] into the hands of the Tyrant Ezzelinus : who being again dispossessed, these Scaliger Princes (of whom I have before spoken) and others of the same family had the soveraigne dominion of this City for the space of two hundred yeares, till Joannes Galeatius Viscount of Milan abrogated their governement in the time of Antonius Signorius Scaliger about the yeare 1396. After which time the said Galea tius swayed Verona eighteene yeares. But as soone as he was dead, one of the Scaligers recovered it againe. The same being made away with poyson, Francis Carrarius enjoyed the Principality halfe a yeare. But the Venetians being exasperated against him for Scaliger s unnaturall death, deposed him againe about the yeare 1405. and governed the same till the yeare 1509. Then it was seven yeares subject to the Emperour Maximilian, who in the yeare 1517. restored it to the Venetians, that have con tinually from that time to this present day enjoyed the possession thereof. The principall market place of the City is very faire, The principal which I take occasion to mention by reason of a notable market P ace - thing that I observed there tending to idolatry. For on the front of a faire house adjoining to this market place, there standeth the image of the virgin Mary, made in white marble with Christ in one arme, and a booke in one of her hands. Under the which this superstitious inscrip tion is written concerning the adoration of the same image. Quisquis Sacram hanc B. M.

Also I saw about the middle of the same market place A pleasant a marvailous pleasant fountaine, adorned with a very fountain. ancient marble image, wearing a crowne upon her head ; that is said to be a representation of Verona. From divers spouts of this statue, jugis aquas fons doth incessantly flow. Besides, at the higher end of this market place there is erected a very stately marble pillar with the winged Lyon advanced upon it. And in a Gentlemans house of the City but a little way from that, I saw a very beautifull paire of winding stayres, made by that singular architect Andreas [p. 323.] Palladius, which by reason of the curious workemanship thereof are much shewed to strangers. There are some Jewes in this city, though not so many as in Venice or Padua, who are shut up from the Christians 3 OBSERVATIONS OF VERONA in their Ghetto by three gates ; upon one whereof, which We Ghetto f standeth at one end of their street, I read this inscription.

The buildings of this city, especially those that belong ^ he buildings to the Gentlemen, are very faire, being for the most part built with bricke : though I have scene some of the Gentlemens houses built with passing faire stone, and richly adorned with many goodly marble pillars ; the pen- tices or eavisses of their houses being much broader then I have observed in other cities. Also many of their outward walles and their chimneys are very fairely painted, which giveth great ornament to their houses. I observed one Palace amongst the rest beautified with a passing faire front, which was contrived wholy with pointed diamond worke. The like whereof I have before mentioned both in one of the outward bulwarks of the castle of Milan, & in the east front of the Duke of Venices Palace. But that diamond worke was made only in a little part of each front, [? 3 2 4-l even about the lower end. But this whole front was adorned with it from the bottome to the very toppe, which yeelded admirable grace to the edifice. In another front of one of their houses I read this pro- phesie of Christ, written under the picture of Sybilla Tyburtina. Virgo concipiet. The Cathedral I was in their Domo, which is their Cathedral Church Church. 3 1 CORYAT S CRUDITIES dedicated to our Lady ; a very auncient and goodly build ing, wherein are shewed some notable monuments. But that which is most of all esteemed and reverenced of the Citizens, is the Sepulchre of Pope Lucius the third of that name, which I saw. This Lucius died in Verona, Anno MCLxxxv. when he came thither to proclaime a generall Councell, Urban the third being substituted in his place. But that elegant Epitaph which is written upon his tomb I did not observe, being afterward bestowed upon me by a friend of mine, even this : Luca dedit lucem tibi Luci, Pontificatum Ostia, Papatum Roma, Verona mori. Imo Verona dedit tibi vere vivere, Roma Exilium, curas Ostia, Luca mori. The fairest Organs that I saw in Italy or in any other country, are in this Domo. The Bishop of The name of him that was Bishop of Verona when I was there, was Albertus Valerius, being successor to Augustinus Valerius, that was afterward made Cardinal. His Palace is neare to the Domo, the front whereof is very faire, having foure stately pillars of marble at the entrance, which are supported with two great square bases of the like marble, in one whereof this inscription is written : Probis Improbisque Par aditus ; Dispar Exitus.

Since which time they have had many godly and learned Bishops, whereof thirty sixe have bin canonized for Saints, by reason of the great holinesse of their lives. The chiefest of them all being Saint Zeno, the numen tutelare or protector of Verona, who was a godly Bishop of this citie, and a faithfull Martyr of Christ, who suffered 32 OBSERVATIONS OF VERONA in the seventh persecution of the Church under the Emperour Decius, unto whom King Pipin above saide built a very sumptuous Church at the West end of the Citie, which is beautified with many goodly ornaments. In the front thereof about the entrance of the same many religious histories are presented in Alabaster. Also the first gate is a worke of great sumptuousnesse, being decked with many pretty little peeces of brasse, wherein many notable histories of the bible are passing curiously de scribed : likewise at the sides of this gate there are carved two exceeding great Lyons in red Marble, that sustaine two goodly pillars. Within the Church there is an extra ordinary great front made of porphyrie. In a low crypta or vault of this Church I saw the monument of Saint Monument of Zeno, & againe above neare to the quire his statue made in stone with a miter upon his head. He is pourtrayed laughing and looking very pleasantly, in his left hand he held a reeden rod, the top whereof was pretily made with bone finely wrought, which indeed was nothing else but the top of his Crosier : at the ende hanged a counterfeited Trowte, in token that hee was much delighted in taking of Trowtes, as a Benedictine Monke tolde me. There I read this inscription, Anno Dom. trecentessimo primo Beatus Zeno moritur duodecima Aprilis. I saw the monument of King Pipin whom I have before Monumenf of mentioned, the sonne of Carolus Magnus, in a little Cell adjoyning to this Church ; this sepulchre is supported with foure prety pillars of marble. All strangers that are admitted to the sight of this tombe, doe first enter by a dore [p. that is most commonly locked, into a greene rude Court, and so descend by a paire of staires of some tenne or twelve greeses. There is great store of water oftentimes hard by the monument issuing out of the spring in the same place, as there was when I was there, which certaine Monkes tolde me is of great vertue to cure sundry diseases.

It is beautified with two exceeding rich marble pillars, which although they are but little, yet by reason of the admirable curiosity of the worke formed therein by the hand of Dame Nature her selfe, and distinguished with passing variety of fine colours ; they are esteemed so precious, that for them and the tabernacle it selfe a certaine Gentleman of Venice offered three thousand crownes, as one of the Monkes told me. \\ was { n tne Church of Saint Anastasia that belongeth tQ ^ Dominican Fryers, a building of notable magnifi- In the body of the Church I observed twelve cence. exceeding huge pillars of marble which were the greatest that ever I saw, even greater then those two famous pillars of Phrygian marble in Saint Markes place in Venice, neare to the Adriatique gulfe, which I have before mentioned in my description of Venice. Sixe of these stand in one side of the Church, and as many in another. At one side of the Church I saw a marvailous faire monument of Janus Fregosius Prince of Genua, adorned with foure most sumptuous pillars of Alabaster, and an excellent image of himselfe made of the same matter, with a trunchion in his hand, and a crested helmet upon his head. At the top of the monument this epitaph is written in Touchstone. Deo Opt. Maxi.

I observed foure passing beautifull pillars of a flesh- coloured marble at one of the Altars of the body of this Church, which are estimated at three hundred crownes a peece. 34 OBSERVATIONS OF VERONA In the Monastery of the Olivetan Benedictine Monkes which are attyred with white vailes made of a kinde of Say and copes of the same, I saw a most sumptuous paire of Organs, and a very admirable workemanship in certaine wainescot pillars in their closet, where their priest did put on his roabes for the celebration of masse. Also I visited the Monastry of the Bartholomaean Monkes seated upon a hill on the farther side of the Athesis, and I observed their fountaines which they told me are of singular efficacie for the curing of certaine infirmities. I was admitted into the most magnificent Palace of Count Augustinus Justus, but not without some favour. There I saw stones with very ancient inscriptions, which I could not reade by reason of the antiquitie of them. Also I was shewed a certaine higher roome in the Palace which was a place of that singular glory, that I saw not the like in any private house of Italy, the beauty thereof consisting especially of pictures which hanged round about the roome, beeing in number one hundred fifty nine, and such as repre sented some of the worthiest and most eminent persons of the world in divers ages. There I saw many of the Roman Emperours most exquisitely painted, and some of the German Emperors, and Kings of Spaine : also Kings of France : many Dukes of Venice, and divers Popes : of our English Kings but one, and that was King Henry the eighth. But the Italian painter erred, for the picture more truely represented Henry the seventh, then H. the eighth. There I saw the three famous Scaligers of Verona, whom I have before mentioned, Mastinus, Grandis Canis, and Canis Signorius ; the pictures of sixe of the most renowned great Turkes. Of Totylas King of the Gothes. Of Alchitrof King of Ethiopia. Of Muleamet Scirisso King of Marocco. Of Scanderbeg. Of David de Degli Abissini the present Presbyter John. Of Tam- berlan.

Therefore I counsell thee whatsoever thou art that meanest in thy travels to see Verona, to make meanes to bee admitted into the Palace of Count Augustinus Justus, and to see this noble and glorious roome before thou dost come forth of it : for many English gentlemen have seene it, as the Italian told me that shewed it to me. The Palace Also the Italian shewed me his garden, which is a second Paradise, and a passing delectable place of solace, beautified with many curious knots, fruites of divers sorts and two rowes of lofty Cypresse trees, three and thirty in a ranke. Besides his walkes at the toppe of the garden a little under St. Peters Castle, are as pleasant as the heart of man can wish ; being decked with excellent fruites, as Figges, Oranges, Apricockes, and with Cypresse trees. In one of these walkes is a delicate litle refectory : at one side whereof there is a curious artificiall rocke, adorned with many fine devices, as scollop shels, and great variety of other prety shels of fishes brought from Cyprus : and mosse groweth upon the same as if it were a naturall rocke. [p. 329.] This place certainely is contrived with as admirable curio sity as ever I saw, and moystened with delicate springs and fountaines conveighed into the same by leaden pipes. I have seene in England one place something like to this, even in one of the gardens of that noble knight Sir Francis Carew of Middlesex, who hath one most excellent rocke there framed all by arte, and beautified with many elegant conceits, notwithstanding it is somewhat inferiour unto this.

Before their eyes were made two holes to looke out : 36 OBSERVATIONS OF VERONA each of them carryed a burning candle in his hand of virgin wax, and some of them three candles, and there was put into every candle two peeces of their little tin money called gazets. This citie was besieged by the Emperour Charlemaine The Emperor shortly after the battell betwixt him and Desiderius the Charlema S\" e - last King of the Longobardes neare the citie of Vercellis, whereof I have before made mention. At what time Adalgisius the sonne of the said Desiderius having escaped by flight from the foresaid battell, fortified himselfe herein together with Queene Berta the Wife of Carolomannus, who was the eldest brother of the Emperour Charlemaine. But Charlemaine without any long siege got the citie into his possession, because the citizens yeelded them selves unto his mercy. Also it was besieged about one hundred and fourteene yeares after that time by the Em perour Arnolphus, who by Berengarius Duke of Forum Julii, now called Friuli (a Prince that sometimes in those daies kept his court in this city) was sollicited to come into [p. 330.] Italy with an army of men to aide him in his warres against his great aemulus Guido Duke of Spoleto who contended with him for the Kingdome of Italy : but the citie received no great hurt by his siege ; for it quickly yeelded it selfe . into the hands of the Emperour, as it did before to Charle maine. Neare this citie was fought a great battell, anno 778. 4 great battle betwixt the Emperour Charles the second surnamed the A D ~ 778- Bald, and the two sonnes of his brother Lewes surnamed Germanicus, whose names were Caroloman and Charles : in this battell (which was fought about two years after the great battell waged at the towne of Andernach in Ger many, which I will hereafter mention in my notes of the same place, betweene the said Emperour and his Nephew Lewes another of these Princely brethren) was the Emper our conquered by his Nephewes, and shamefully put to flight, shortly after the which he died in Mantua, as I have before written. Here Philippus Arabs, the first Christian Emperour was 37 CORYAT S CRUDITIES slaine by Decius the Captaine of his forces in Illyricum, and afterward his successor in the Empire. Here also Death of Alboinus the first King of the Longobards died an un- Alboinus. natura n death. For whereas the said King, after he had taken the famous citie of Pavie by a long siege out of the hands of Longinus the first Exarch of Ravenna, kept his court in this citie of Verona, and solaced himselfe with feastes and banquets : he compelled his wife Rosa- munda to drinke one day at table out of the * skull of her father Cunimundus, whom a little before he had slaine: for the which his Queene intending to be revenged upon him for that most inhumane and barbarous injury, con spired with one Helmichildus a noble Longobard, to kill the King her husband, with promise both to marry him if he would execute the matter, & to bestow the Kingdome of Lombardy upon him. Whereupon Helmichildus being [p. 331.] tempted with this faire offer, murdered Alboinus, as he was asleepe in his bedde. And so by this meanes he obtained indeede the marriage of the Queene, but not the possession of the Kingdome. For being constrayned to flie away presently after he had committed this bloody Queen assassination, he came with his wife Rosamund to Ravenna Rosamund. tQ ^ Court o f Longinus before named, where after they had remayned a little while, Longinus falling in love with the Queen, perswaded her, to the end he might the sooner enjoy her in marriage, to poyson her new husband Helmil- childus.

Besides those famous learned men borne in Verona, that I have above mentioned, with many other most excellent wittes, that it hath ever bredde from time to time, I have often read of two most worthy women borne in this city, Ttvo whereof each was esteemed the Phoenix of her time for learning, with mention of whom I will end this description of Verona; the one was called Isota Nogarola a * virgin, who attained to so great knowledge, that she was very eloquent in the Greeke and Latin tongues, and wrote many excellent Latin Epistles to Nicolas, the fifth Pope of that name. Also she composed an elegant Dialogue, wherein she disputed the matter, who committed the greatest sinne Adam or Eve. The other was f Genebria, who in the time of Pius the second of that name Pope, wrote sundry Latin Epistles with a most elegant stile ; which two women have no lesse ennobled this famous citie, with their learning then Aspasia, and Diotima, did [p- 33 2 -] Athens, Cornelia, Rome, Cassandra Venice, or Hilde- gardis the citie of Bing in Germany. Thus much of Verona. I Remained in Verona all Friday after nine of the clocke in the morning, all Saturday, and departed therehence upon Sunday being the fourteenth day of August, about one of the clocke in the afternoone, and came to a little towne called Desensan, in Latin Desentianum, which is Desensan. subject to the Venetians, and two and twenty miles beyond Verona, about eight of the clocke in the evening. In this space I observed onely a faire Fortresse of the Venetians at a towne called Peschiera, fourteene miles from Verona : Peschiera. the other things were ordinary, as faire Vineyards, &c. * Fulgosus lib. 8. cap. 3.

This towne Desentianum is situate neare to the goodly lake Garda heretofore called Benacus, which Virgil men- tioneth in these wordes : Fluctibus, & fremitu assurgens Benace marino. The first name Benacus was imposed upon it from a towne so called, and also the new name Garda from a towne situate neare to it, which retaineth that name at this day. This lake is called in the Italian Lago di Gardo ; it is said to be thirty five miles long, and in some places fourteene broad. I heard that it is commonly esteemed the noblest Lake of all Italy, and some doe not sticke to preferre it before the famous Lacus Larius, now called Lago di Como. The faire River Mincius that runneth by Mantua (of whom I have before made mention) issueth out of this Lake : it is oftentimes very rough and boysterous, inso much that at sometimes of the yeare it is very dangerous for passengers to passe that way. The cause of which roughnesse is ascribed unto the high cliffes that inclose it on both sides, and interclude the windes, who having not the liberty there as in the open sea, doe extremely tosse Golden sands, up and downe the waters. It yeeldeth golden sands like those of Tagus by Lisbone, and Pactolus by Sardis in Lydia. Also it aboundeth with fish, especially Carpes, Troutes, and Eeles. This lake is very memorable for one thing, to wit, for a famous victory gotten near unto it of the Germanes, by that worthy and victorious Emperour Flavius Claudius the successor of Galien, of whom the Historians do write he partly slew and partly tooke captive two hundred thousand. I departed from Desentianum the next day being munday, and the fifteenth day of August about seven of the clocke in the morning, and came to Brixia, commonly called Bressa, being eighteene miles beyond it, about two of the clocke in the afternoone : in which space I observed nothing memorable, but onely some few ruinous Castles, which seeme to be buildings of great antiquity. [P- 333-] Brescia. 40 OBSERVATIONS OF BRESCIA My Observations of Brixia. Julius Caesar Scaliger hath written this Hexastichon upon Brixia.

Si regeret patrias animis concordibus oras, Tune poterat Dominis ipsa jubere suis. This citie standeth in that part of Lombardy which is called Longobardia Transpadana, because it is beyond the river Po, and is situate in a plaine at the foote of a hill, being in compasse three miles. It was first founded by Brescia the auncient Gaules called Cenomani, though some doe fiw& write it was a Colony of the Romans. I heard that there are some notable antiquities and inscriptions in this citie, [p. 334.] but I must intreat thee (gentle Reader) to pardon me although I doe not communicate them to thee. For I made so short aboad in the Citie, that I could not observe halfe so much as I would have done if I had remained there but one whole day. It is invironed with strong walles, wherein there are five gates, and fortified with a most impregnable Castle that standeth upon a hill, built all with free-stone. Also it is well watered with pleasant springs and sweete foun tains, as any citie I saw in Italy, nay none the like. Which flow incessantly from many fine Conduits in sundry market-places, and it is moystened with a river called Garza, which indeed is but little, yet very commodious to the Citie. The Palace wherein the Venetian Praetor and Praefectus Palace of doe lie (for here both have but one Palace, though in Erescla - other cities they have two) is a sumptuous building, and furnished with great store of munition and artillery. At the west gate thereof, which is most commonly guarded with a guard of Souldiers that doe attend there all the day 41 CORYAT S CRUDITIES with Partizans in their handes, I read this inscription over a Scutchin on the right hand as I went into the court.

And this a little under the same, Fide, Virtute, Integritate, spectatissimo viro Paulo Parutae hujus urbis Praefecto Optime merito, anno Dom. M.D.Lxxxxi. The Palace The Palace court is thirty sixe paces long and forty broad, and all the wals round about are adorned with sundry armes of the Venetian Gentlemen. Also in the middle of [p- 335-] the court there is an exceeding pleasant Conduit that spowteth out water in three degrees one above another; in the second degree are sixe prety pipes, out of the which the water doth most abundantly flow : also the higher part doth exceeding pleasantly powre out water. At the west end of the Palace in the outside of the wall, this is written under the winged Lyon. ./Eternse pacis, justitiae, libertatisque Defensor. Over the dore of the Praetors chamber I read this impresse. Diligite justitiam qui judicatis terram. Armour. I went into one of the Praetors inner roomes, which I saw furnished with armour round about all the walles, as helmets, costlets, and other armour for armes and thighes, which served only for horsemen. The like armour also was on both sides of the entry within that roome, which leadeth to the lodgings of the Praefectus. Under which armour I saw on both sides launces and speares for horse men. At the north side there is a goodly brasen dore made like a latteise window, through the which I saw five faire roomes more, passing well furnished with armour. At that gate are exceeding faire pillars of blacke marble, 42 OBSERVATIONS OF BRESCIA interlaced with prety white vaines. Many fine pictures of armed men are made by the sides of that northerne dore. Opposite unto this roome is another faire chamber, the roofe whereof is curiously adorned with excellent pictures. Their principall market place is very faire, at one corner Principal whereof there standeth a goodly high pillar of free-stone, market P lace - whereon the winged Lyon is advanced according to the custome of the Venetians, who have erected such a pillar in the principall market place of every Citie subject to their dominion, as I have before mentioned in Vicenza and Verona. At the west end of this market place there standeth a most stately Councell house, which was very faire, and covered with lead before it was burnt. But they have reedified and marvailously beautified it beneath [p. 336-] with goodly pillars, and above round about with borders and workes in great arches, and with marble pillars and images of admirable curiosity, representing some of the auncient Roman Emperours, so passing faire that I have scarce seene a more curious and artificiall architecture in Italy, saving the Amphitheater of Verona, the Palace of Padua, and some few of the Venetian buildings. In the Domo which is dedicated to our Lady I saw a Cathedral very faire monument of Francis Maurocenus their last Ghurch - Bishop, who was also Cardinall. His statue is erected above a most beautiful stone wherein his Epitaph is written : and above the same his Cardinals hat and armes. His Epitaph is this. D. T. V.

In which Crosse these characters were plainly seene : In hoc signo Constantine vinces. The Brixians doe call this Crosse whereof they so much boast, Oroflamma, which signifieth the golden Flame, &c. and they affirme that it representeth the colour 44 cross. OBSERVATIONS OF BRESCIA of heaven. Albeit I hold this tradition to be a meere, yea, a very grosse figment (for what wise man that hath his wit in his head and not in his heele, will beleeve that this should be the very same heavenly Crosse ? seing we reade that Constantine himselfe could not have the same, but in steede thereof made another Crosse the next day after of gold and precious stone, which was borne before him in steede of a standard, Euseb. de vita Constant, lib. i.) yet for the satisfaction of my mind I made meanes to see it, but I could not obtayne the sight thereof, because it is shewed but at certayne times. The Bishop of Brixia hath many temporall dignities [p. 338.] added to his spirituall, so that he is intitled a Duke, Marquesse, and Earle. I visited the Church of the Dominican Friers, which Church of the is a very fayre building, the Quire being beautified with omn&gt; many goodly ornaments, amongst the rest their new taber nacle is a very glorious piece of worke. One of the Friers told me that they keepe a bone of one of Mary Magdalens armes here : but I could not obtaine the eight of it, because it is shewed but at certaine times. The nunnery which is dedicated to the holy Martyr St. Julia, is a building of great antiquity. For it was built by Desiderius the last King of the Longobards in the time of Carolus Magnus, about the yeare 750. The Church thereof hath beene lately renewed and beautified at the charges of the Nunnes. Upon the front I read this inscription.

One miraculous or rather prodigi ous accident that hapned once in this City in the time of the Emperour Ludovicus the second, I will mention here, to wit, that it rayned bloud here for the space of three dayes together, which was as red and lively as if it had newly flowen out of the body of any man or beast. A portent so exceeding strange, that as I never read or heard of the like in any place of the world before, so I doubt whether there was ever the like accident either before or since of the like continuance ; my Authour of this was a learned man of this City, whom I found to be a man of excellent learning. This city was first converted to Christianity about the yeare 119 by St. Apollinaris Bishop of Ravenna. One of their churches is dedicated to two Saints namely Faustinus & Jovita that were heretofore citizens of the same City of Brixia, and constant Martyrs of Jesus Christ : who suffered martyrdome in the persecution of the Emperour Adrian, whose great torments one Calocerius perceiving that they endured with great patience, he cryed out with these words : Vere magnus Deus Christianorum. For which he was also martyred in the same place. They have one principall tower above the rest commonly called Pallada, wherein the fairest bels of the City doe hang. The Gentlemens Palaces of the City are very faire, most of them being built with free stone, not with brick, as in many other Italian Cities. One amongst the rest I observed of great magnificence, in the front whereof an Eagle was so exquisitely pourtrayed, that it much graced that part of the building. Also their pentices are as broad as those of Verona. Many of their streetes are beautified 46 OBSERVATIONS OF BRESCIA with such open galleries to walke in, and garnished with faire pillars, as those of Mantua, Padua, and Venice, above mentioned. This City is one of those that Attila King of the Hunnes grievously wasted, when he entred into Italy after his over throw in France by ^Etius Generall of the Roman army. Many hundred yeares after which time it was so much inclined to factions and mutinies, that in the time of Ludovicus the third of that name Emperour and one of [p. 340.] the Othoes, it changed her governement no lesse then seven times in the space of eight and twenty yeares ; but at this time after so many revolutions and alterations of their state, it is subject to the noble Signiory of Venice. The Cutlers of this City are accounted very excellent Excellent workemen for making of knives, targets, and swordes of cutlers - a singular temper : also the trade of making silke and linen doth much flourish here. It happened that the same Munday that I was in Brixia, was Barthelmew day. At what time there was a most solemne and ceremonious dedication of a new image to the Virgin Mary with Christ in her armes, which I saw performed in a certaine little Chappel with many super stitious rites. For they attired the image with a great Dedication of many several roabes, as of sattin, taffata, lawne, &c. and an there was a great multitude of litle waxen idols brought to the Chappell, whereof some were onely armes, some thighes, some presented all the parts of a mans body : although these toyes were no novelties unto me. For I saw many of them before that time in divers Italian Cities. Yet I had a marvailous itching desire to finger one of them, only to this end, to bring it home into England, to shew it to my friends as a token of their idolatry : but I saw there was some difficulty in the matter. How- beit I gave the venture upon it in this manner. I stood at one corner of the Chappel while many women were at their divine oraizons prostrate before the image, and very secretly conveighed my fingers into a little basket (nobody taking notice thereof) where the images were laid ; and 47 34- -] CORYAT S CRUDITIES so purloyned one of them out, and brought him home into England. Which had it been at that time perceived, perhaps it might have cost me the lying in the Inquisition longer then I would willingly have endured it. Thus much of Brixia. T Departed from Brixia about eight of the clock in the A morning the sixteenth day of August being Tuesday, Bergamo, and came to Bergomum commonly called Bergomo the last City of the Venetian Signiory about seven of the clocke in the evening. The distance betwixt these two Cities is thirty miles. I observed in this space great abundance of goodly vineyards, which at that time yeelded ripe grapes passing faire and sweet. For I did oftentimes borrow a point of the law in going into their Vineyards without leave, to refresh my selfe with some of their grapes. Which the Italians like very good fellowes did winke at, shewing themselves more kinde unto me then the Germans did afterward in Germany, as I will hereafter declare in my observations of their country. For they will not graunt a stranger that liberty to goe into any of their vineyardes without leave, as the Italians doe. The Pleasant greatest part of the way betwixt these Cities is as pleasant &gt;e l \" s as any I travelled in Italy. For it is very plaine and even ; one spacious lane, on both sides whereof the goodly vine yardes grew, extending it selfe about eighteene miles in length. All that day I saw great abundance of people going to and fro, but especially forward towards Bergomo, because there was a great faire there at that time ; most of the horsemen being well appointed with muskets or pewternels ready charged, according to that custome of the Italians that I have before mentioned. 48 OBSERVATIONS OF BERGAMO My Observations of Bergomo. Julius Caesar Scaliger hath written these verses upon Bergomo. INgenium, corpus, mores, obtutus, amictus, Scaliger s Tecta, cibus, eressus, guttura, sermo, sonus : vers \" on /^ 4- -U j Bergamo. Omnia crassa modis msigmbus, omnia dura, r -. Sic valeant silices ut superare suos. Ista domi : sed vicinus si aspergat acetum, Artibus atque dolis vincitur ipse suis. This City was built about a hundred and fifty yeares before the incarnation of our Saviour Christ, by one Cirinus King of Liguria. It standeth on the side of a hill, having in the east and south the pleasant plaine of Lombardy before it. So that from many places of this City there is as sweet a prospect as any place of Italy doth yeeld. In the north and west are great hils that leade towards the Alpes. It is devided into two parts, the higher and the lower. Unto the higher there is a long and tedious ascent. It was my chaunce to be here s - Barthob- at the time of their fair the next day after Barthelmew meto&gt;f Fatr - day, which lasteth a whole weeke ; being kept in a large plaine a little way distant from the lower part of the City. This was the greatest faire that ever I saw in my life, except that of Franckford in Germany, whereof I will hereafter speake. For there was a great concurse of people not onely from the Cities of Lombardy, but also from many other principal Cities of Italy : besides many Germans both out of the Grisons country and Switzerland repaire hither at this time : exceeding plenty of all manner of commodities being there sold. The first that planted the doctrine of Christian religion in the City, and chaced idolatry and Paganisme out of it, was St. Barnabas, who preached the Gospell first also at Milan. The Cathedrall Church is dedicated to our Lady, and Cathedral standeth in the higher part of the City : a very notable Chunh - c. c. ii. 49 p CORYAT S CRUDITIES faire building though but little. At the entrance of the north gate there are two faire pillars of red marble, sup ported with two huge Lyons of the same matter. At the toppe over an arch which is above the dore, is advanced a gallant fellow on horsebacke made in alabaster. One - 343-] part of this northerne front on the right hand as you enter into the gate, is passing beautifull, being compacted wholly of sundry sorts of marble and alabaster, which doe yeeld a very glorious shew. The greatest part of it is made of checker worke. In the middest of this front is a faire round window garnished very excellently with many prety pieces of marble, at the sides whereof are erected the statues in alabaster of two famous Roman Emperours. Julius Caesar on the left hand, under whom this is written in great Roman letters : Divus Julius Caesar. And above him this : Imperavit annis V. On the right hand the effigies of Trajan, under whom is written : Divus Trajanus Augustus. And above : Imperavit Annis XVIII. But I perceive that they calculate the time of his raigne within compasse. For al the historians write that he raigned nineteene yeares and halfe. These statues are made to the middle part of their breast and no Further. I told certaine Italian Gentlemen that observed me writing, they were much to blame to erect the images of prophane heathen men upon their Church. For although it were good to keepe such antiquities, yet they ought not to be placed upon Churches where Christ is worshipped ; but rather upon their Councell houses, or their private build ings. This part of the frontispice is passing faire, and worthy to be noted by an industrious traveller. After I entered the north gate I observed in a faire litle chappell on the right hand of the Church, an exceeding Monument of sumptuous monument of Barthelmew Coleon the General Ca P taine of the Venetians land forces, as I have before mentioned in my discourse of Venice. They say it was made in his life time by his owne appointment. He is represented on horsebacke, all in glittering gold in his complete armour that he wore in the field, and his military So OBSERVATIONS OF BERGAMO trunchion in his right hand. All this monument is made of pure alabaster, wherein are represented many notable histories done in the pretiest litle images and works that [p- 344-] I saw in any City of Italy. The whole worke is supported with four alabaster pillars, at the foote whereof are expressed the heads of Lyons. At the toppe of all is advanced his helmet and crest with his armes, at the sides are hanged two auncient banners which are grievously rent and torne with antiquity. A little from his Tombe there is hanged up a faire cloth of arras, in the middest whereof his armes are finely wrought, which are three testicles. The reaso"
