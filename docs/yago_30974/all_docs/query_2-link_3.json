The character is played by actor Lars Korten since March 11, 2004.\n\nCharacter's background\n\nLeonard is the son of Adrian Degenhardt (Klaus Zmorek) and the late Francesca von Lahnstein. He is also the brother of Constantin von Lahnstein (Milan Marcus) and the half-brother of Carla von Lahnstein (Claudia Hiersche) and Ansgar von Lahnstein (Wolfram Grandezka). Until 2007 he believed that Johannes von Lahnstein (Thomas Gumpert) is his real father, but a letter from his late mother Francesca sheds another light on the truth and after a DNA-Test it was clear, that Adrian is his biological father.\n\nLeonard is the favorite son of his father Johannes. When he comes home from Chicago, where he worked as doctor, he meets Cécile de Maron (Yvonne Burbach) and knows from the beginning that she is the love of his life. Then he arrives at Königsbrunn and it turns out, that Cécile is Johannes' new wife. Soon, Leonard and Cécile have to deal with their feelings for each other. They try to deny their love, Leonard even marries his former love Silke Voss (Annette Culp) to prove that he can live without Cécile. But his marriage falls apart, when Silke sees Leonard true feelings and gives up. Johannes also comes behind Leonard and Cécile's love and finds out that they had an affair. Johannes files for divorce and wants Leonard out of his life. Cécile tries to bring them back together, when she finds out that she is pregnant and hopes that Johannes finds a way to be a grandfather to their child. He refuses after trying. But when Cécile dies after a terrible car accident, Johannes comes in an hour, where Leonard needs him the most, after he not only lost his wife, which he married only days before the accident, but also his unborn son Julius, who doesn't survive. Leonard soon becomes a drug addict to pain killers, hunted by memories of Cécile."
