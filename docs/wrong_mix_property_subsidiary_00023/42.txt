Data loss prevention solutions help organizations prevent the loss of confidential or proprietary information wherever it is stored or being used. Vontu’s products will complement Symantec’s existing portfolio of endpoint and network security, storage and compliance solutions, to provide customers with the most comprehensive platform for data loss prevention on the market today. The acquisition builds on Symantec’s strong partnership with Vontu and will provide an important component of Symantec’s Security 2.0 vision, which shifts the focus of security from simply securing systems and devices to also protecting the information itself.
