Symantec aims to simplify content discovery with an upgraded version of its Vontu Data Loss Prevention software suite.In doing so, Symantec has added new management features and native support for scanning SQL databases, such as Oracle, SQL Server and DB2. "Companies can now perform systematic enterprise-scale audits of thousands of databases as part of their data loss prevention strategy to quickly inventory databases as part of an audit or locate sensitive data which may have been improperly stored," according to the Cupertino, Calif.-based security software company.

In addition, Symantec also bolstered Vontu Data Loss Prevention's coverage for Windows Server 2003 and Windows Vista. Administrators can also automate the parallel scanning of thousands of systems from a single console.eWeek
