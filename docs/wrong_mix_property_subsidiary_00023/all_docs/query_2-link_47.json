        "text": "Dudes. Wishing you a happy 4/20. May you end your day without having suffered through too many pot jokes.:)\n\nToday’s StrictlyVC comes to you courtesy of Treble, a data-centric PR agency specializing in securing targeted media coverage for an array of global venture-backed startups and venture capital firms, including Mercury Fund, Next Coast Ventures and Signal Peak Ventures. With its proprietary scalable retainer model and team of experienced PR professionals and ex-journalists, Treble operates as a newsroom by reverse-engineering thought leaders into the news cycle. The founder of Treble penned a piece on how startups can capitalize on PR to accelerate the path to exit. Check out media coverage highlights here.\n\nTop News in the A.M.\n\nGoogle is planning to introduce an ad-blocking feature in the mobile and desktop versions of its Chrome browser that will filter out certain online ad types deemed to provide bad experiences for users. The WSJ has more here.\n\nYesterday, we told you that Oracle has acquired the seven-year-old, ad measurement company Moat, which helps advertisers and publishers measure whether people see and interact with online ads. Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed, but a source now tells Recode the price is a healthy $850 million. More here.\n\nGladly, Incubated at Greylock, Lands $36M in Fresh Funding\n\nThere’s no shortage of customer service startups trying to meet the changing expectations of consumers, who want to Tweet, phone, text and use Facebook Messenger, among other newer ways to get their points across. In fact, according to the investment platform AngelList, there are now 960 companies currently operating around customer care.\n\nThat hasn’t deterred Joseph Ansanelli, who joined Greylock Partners as a general partner in 2012 but who’d first started and sold three companies and was itching to do it again.\n\nAs he recalls it, he was having dinner with colleague Aneel Bhusri, a former Greylock partner (and now advisor) and the co-founding CEO of the HR and financial management company Workday. It was 2012, Workday had just gone public and the two were talking about the onerous but exciting process of starting companies. Before he knew it, Ansanelli was calling enterprise customers — contacts from his earlier life as a founder — and asking them what they were lacking.\n\nThe two things he learned from those conversations were, “first, that they were getting tons of demands and requests from consumers about more ways to communicate, and second, a lot of the [related] software available to them was on-premise stuff centered around case numbers and tickets.”\n\nAnd customers, says Ansanelli, “don’t like being a case or ticket number.”\n\nIn fact, his newest cloud-based company, Gladly, quickly formed around the idea of an enterprise-class company that did away with them, and he moved to get his old band together. Toward that end, he reached out to Michael Wolfe, who was Ansanelli’s co-founder at Vontu, a data loss prevention software company that was acquired by Symantec for $350 million in 2007, as well as Connectify, a company they sold in 1999 to Kana Communications. (Old timers may remember that Kana was a dot-com darling that helped pioneer the concept of email for customer service. It went public in 1999 and was taken private again in 2010.)\n\nAnsanelli separately called up Dirk Kessler, who was Connectify’s first engineer but who’d met Ansanelli at the outset of their careers when both worked at Apple. Even Jenny Roy, a marketing professional who’d worked at Vontu, was tapped again; today’s she’s Gladly’s VP of marketing.\n\nWhat the trusted colleagues have built, says Ansanelli, is more than another new ticketing system aimed at small and medium size businesses.\n\nMore here.\n\nNew Fundings\n\nAugust Home, a 4.5-year-old, San Francisco-based maker of smart doorlocks, has raised more than $17 million, shows an SEC filing that was first flagged by Axios and shows a target amount of $25 million. The company had previously raised $48 million from investors, including Bessemer Venture Partners, CAA Ventures, and Cowboy Ventures, among others. More here.\n\nBedly, a 1.5-year-old, New York-based platform for renters that manages everything from furnishing apartments to screening roommates to setting up utilities, has raised $2.7 million in seed funding led by Accomplice, with participation from Founder Collective.

Xconomy has more here.\n\nGetaround, an eight-year-old, San Francisco-based car sharing startup, has raised $45 million in Series C funding led by Braemar Energy Ventures, with participation from Toyota, SAIC, and earlier backers Menlo Ventures and Triangle Peak Partners. According to Fortune, the new round values the company at $176 million. (Getaround has so far raised roughly $100 million from investors, shows Crunchbase.)

We have more here.\n\nExits\n\nMarketo has acquired ToutApp, a six-year-old, San Francisc-based sales software company that had raised at least $21.5 million from Andreessen Horowitz, Jackson Square Ventures, Founder Collective, and others.

With its proprietary scalable retainer model and team of experienced PR professionals and ex-journalists, Treble operates as a newsroom by reverse-engineering thought leaders into the news cycle. The founder of Treble penned a piece on how startups can capitalize on PR to accelerate the path to exit. Check out media coverage highlights here.\n\nTop News in the A.M.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund just raised its outlook for global growth, citing a postelection surge in confidence in the U.S., better prospects in large emerging markets, and an uptick in global trade. The rosy forecast is something of a change of mind for the fund, reports Dealbook.\n\nThe German media company Axel Springer has taken an undisclosed stake in Uber, the companies confirmed earlier today.\n\nThis Pet Supplies Company Just Sold in the Biggest E-Commerce Deal Ever\n\nIf you haven’t heard of Chewy, you aren’t alone. But PetSmart, the retail giant with more than 1,500 stores across the U.S., has clearly been tracking the low-flying, five-year-old pet supplies company. According to Recode, it just agreed to purchase its young rival for a stunning $3.35 billion, just slightly more than Walmart paid for Jet.com last year.\n\nThis editor only heard of Chewy for the first time last fall, when talking with one of its earlier investors, Larry Cheng of the Boston-based growth equity fund Volition Capital; Volition had written Chewy its $15 million Series A check in 2013, and the company had been growing quietly like a weed, he’d told me.\n\nBy design, that began to change late last year, when Bloomberg wrote a long profile about the Dania, Fla., company and the $236 million it had subsequently raised from investors, including BlackRock and New Horizon, the venture arm of mutual fund T. Rowe Price. Until then, said its chairman, billionaire e-commerce veteran Mark Vadon, his advice to the team had been to keep a low profile to better to avoid competition.\n\nIt was something of a feat. By the time Bloomberg published its story, the company had more than 3,000 employees and more than $880 million in annual revenue.\n\nIts apparent key to success: personalization, from writing customers hand-written thank you and holiday cards to dedicating roughly one-sixth of its employees to customer service so pet owners’ questions could be answered quickly. Free shipping on orders over $49 also helped.\n\nPerhaps as a result, the company hadn’t yet reached profitability, Bloomberg noted, but no matter.\n\nMore here.\n\nNew Fundings\n\nBarnebys, a six-year-old, Stockholm, Sweden-based online service that allows people to search for, compare, and buy items from dealers and auction houses around the world, has raised $3.3 million in funding Industrifonden, Howsat Venture Partners, Accum Kapital and Kichi Invest.

Nasdaq has more here.\n\nExits\n\nAirAsia, the budget airline for Southeast Asia that’s headquartered in Malaysia, has bought a 50 percent share in the two-year-old, Malaysia-based trip planning service Touristly in a deal worth $2.6 million. TechCrunch has more on the tie-up here.\n\nMicrosoft is acquiring Intentional Software, a 15-year-old, Bellevue, Wash. software programming company that was founded by Excel and Word creator Charles Simonyi (who has also famously visited space, twice, as a tourist). Terms weren’t disclosed. GeekWire has more here.\n\nOracle has acquired the seven-year-old, ad measurement company Moat, which helps advertisers and publishers measure whether people see and interact with online ads.

More here.\n\nA New On-Demand Battle is Speeding Toward the U.S.\n\nWhile Uber’s woes take center stage in the U.S., a different on-demand battle that’s been playing out in China is coming to the states.\n\nThe battle isn’t over car sharing. It’s not over bus sharing, either, though that, too, is a growing focus for investors and automotive companies that are desperate to understand how cities and transportation are changing. This clash is over the latest wrinkle in urban bike-sharing – dockless bike sharing. And it has founders and VCs around the globe seeing dollar signs, while regulators are wrestling – again — with how to ensure they’re not victims of a trend that seemed to emerge nearly overnight.\n\n“Dockless bike sharing is something that people worry about until they realize it’s a benefit” to society, says Atomico cofounder Mattias Ljungman, who calls the ability to leave one’s bicycle where a trip ends “the real revolution here.” Docking stations are “very complicated,” he says. “Not only do riders need to know where to park their bikes, but sometimes the stations are full. It’s a pain.”\n\nAtomico has already placed a big bet on Ofo, a Beijing-based dockless bike-share company that has so far raised roughly $580 million from VCs at a post-money valuation of north of $1 billion. China-based investors are looking to pour even more into the three-year-old company given its current momentum, suggests Ljungman, citing the more than one million connected bikes it has already placed on city streets in China, and customers who are taking an astonishing 10 million rides per day, compared with the roughly 10 million rides per year that London’s public bike-sharing service powers.\n\nThe story is much the same for 16-month-old, Shanghai-based Mobike, which also claims to have more than a million bikes in its fleet and has raised $410 million from investors at a valuation that the WSJ reports is north of $1 billion.\n\nAnother Beijing-based bike-share company, Bluegogo, is drafting behind both. Founded a mere six months ago, it has already raised at least $65 million from investors.\n\nStill, China is not the U.S; it remains to be seen if a variation of the model will work here. “Just as China will tell you that things that work in the rest of the world won’t work in China because of its 5,000-year-long cultural history, things in China don’t necessarily work [in the U.S.] either,” says Sean O’Sullivan, the founder and managing director of the venture firm SOSV.\n\nFriend or foe\n\nO’Sullivan has been watching dockless bike sharing as closely as anyone. Like a growing number of VCs, he has a horse in this race.\n\nMore here.\n\nNew Fundings\n\nActility, a seven-year-old Paris-based Internet of Things startup, has raised $75 million, including the private equity firm Creadev SAS, the industrial company Robert Bosch GmbH and satellite operator Inmarsat Plc.

TechCrunch has more here.\n\nA Quick Look at Who Was Spending, on What, in the First Quarter\n\nThis morning, the research firm CB Insights, in partnership with the services firm PwC, released a report on the state of VC in the first quarter of this year. It does a great job of breaking down what’s what, so we’re basically just cutting and pasting a handful of its biggest takeaways here and adding a little bit of context in case it’s helpful.\n\n1.) U.S.-based venture backed companies raised $13.9 billion in the first quarter, across 1,104 deals. That’s up 15 percent and 2 percent from the first quarter of 2016 but way below the amount of activity we saw in 2015. (VCs invested more than $20 billion in the second quarter of 2015, for example.) This is a narrative we’ve been watching since early 2016, when an abrupt nosedive in the share price of LinkedIn (months before its acquisition) launched what would become a sustained freakout by both public and private investors.\n\n2.) This one surprised us, but seed activity as a proportion of all deals is on the decline. Seed rounds made up one quarter of all deals in the first quarter; over the last few years, that figure has been north of 30 percent. We’re not immediately sure of how to explain this one, but it’s likely that angel investors are still waiting for some of their older deals to exit. (These things typically take far longer than newer angels in particular appreciate.) There could also be a growing disconnect between the prices founders are asking for and what angel investors are willing to pay. The most optimistic scenario is that angels have grown more discerning about what to fund. (Just kidding. That probably isn’t happening.)\n\n3.) Corporates and corporate VCs are as active as ever, participating in 26 percent of all U.S. deals in the first quarter, which matches their rate of participation in the third quarter of last year, which itself was an eight-quarter high. This one won’t surprise industry observers. When even Sesame Street launches a venture fund, you know things have changed.\n\nMore here.\n\n(Other) New Fundings\n\nBanihal, a five-year-old, Redwood City, Ca.-based online matchmaking service, has raised an undisclosed amount of money from Google’s famously frugal first investor David Cheriton. (“It’s just easy to do myself, and it takes less time,” he has said of cutting his own hair.) A handful of other U.S.-based angel investors also participated in the round. The Economic Times has more here.\n\nBlink Health, a 2.5-year-old, New York-based generic and prescription medication purchasing platform, has raised $90 million in Series B funding led by earlier investor 8VC that brings its total funding to $165 million. The company was fighting off a lawsuit as of late last year, filed against it by its former CFO. (Blink called the suit “malicious” and “unjustified.”) It suffered another setback when two big pharmacy chains pulled out of its network last month. More on its new round here.\n\nCleanly, an on-demand dry cleaning and laundry service, has (despite the odds) raised $5 million in Series A funding led by AddVenture, with participation from Millhouse Capital and return backers Altair Capital and Initialized Capital. More here.\n\nDarkstore, a year-old, San Francisco-based provider of one-hour and same-day delivery fulfillment for ecommerce companies, has raised $1.4 million in seed funding from Pivot North.

More here.\n\nHackerEarth, a four-year-old, Bangalore, India-based startup behind a technical recruiting platform, has raised $4.5 million in Series A funding led by DHI Group, with participation from Japanese quartet Beenext, Beenos, Digital Garage, BizReach.

(In case you missed yesterday’s newsletter, we’d asked founders for startup-related limericks in return for free tickets to our upcoming event, courtesy of our friends at Bullish.) We had a couple of intentionally (we think) bad entries, but there are writers among you. Among our favorite entries: “There once was a founder named Hank/VCs found his style too frank/He struck out in the Valley/But friends supported him gladly/And they laughed all the way to the bank.” And: “I wake in the middle of night/Check my email with no delight/Another no sales day/ Love working for no pay/Dream big and hope it turns out right.” (We know the feeling!)\n\nSpeaking of which: Today’s StrictlyVC comes to you courtesy of Treble, a growing, data-centric PR firm out of Austin.

Last year, the seven-year-old company raised $150 million in a deal co-led by General Catalyst Partners and CapitalG that valued the startup at $9.2 billion, almost double the valuation it was assigned in 2015.\n\nAltogether, it has raised $440 million, shows Crunchbase.\n\nStill, don’t expect an IPO any time soon, Collison stated very explicitly at the Launch conference in San Francisco on Friday. While industry observers like to note the sustained and seemingly unstoppable success of gun-slinging Amazon, which went public in 1997, just three years after its founding, Collison argued that it was harder for Amazon at the outset than many seem to recall.\n\n“If you look at the Amazon daily history [as a public company], they had an incredibly turbulent time for their first couple of years,” he told interviewer and Launch founder Jason Calacanis. “Now in 2017 . . . it all looks great. But they had a tough time at the beginning and I think this is a broader structural challenge across the industry.”\n\nOf course, the point — that it’s far harder to take risks as a public company — has been endlessly argued for and against in recent years, by both people who think staying private as long as possible makes sense as long as capital is available, and those who argue that going public provides companies with cash to do things like acquire other companies.\n\nIt’s an argument that Collison preemptively argued, in fact, saying Friday that, “Being a public company certainly doesn’t stop you from taking a really long-term time horizon, but it does make it more difficult.”\n\nMore here.\n\nA Word from Our Sponsor . . .\n\nToday’s StrictlyVC comes to you courtesy of Treble, a growing, data-centric PR firm out of Austin.
