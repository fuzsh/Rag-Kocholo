        "text": "BoxMonitor.DiskUsageError\n\n90\n\nThe amount of disk space filled (as a percentage) that triggers a severe system event. For example, if\n\nSymantec Data Loss Prevention\n\nis installed on the C drive and this value is 90. In this case, the detection server creates a severe system event when the C drive usage is above 90%.\n\nBoxMonitor.DiskUsageWarning\n\n80\n\nThe amount of disk space filled (as a percentage) that triggers a warning system event. For example, if\n\nSymantec Data Loss Prevention\n\nis installed on the C drive and this value is\n\n80\n\n, then the detection server generates a warning system event when the C drive usage is above 80%.\n\nBoxMonitor.HeartbeatGapBeforeRestart\n\n960000\n\nThe time interval in milliseconds that the BoxMonitor waits for a monitor process (for example, FileReader, IncidentWriter) to report the heartbeat. If the heartbeat is not received within this time interval the BoxMonitor restarts the process.\n\nContentExtraction.EnableMetaData\n\noff\n\nAllows detection on the file metadata. If the setting is turned\n\non\n\n, you can detect metadata for Microsoft Office and PDF files. For Microsoft Office files, OLE metadata is supported, which includes the fields Title, Subject, Author, and Keywords. For PDF files, only Document Information Dictionary metadata is supported. This metadata includes fields such as Author, Title, Subject, Creation, and Update dates. Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP) content is not detected. Enabling this metadata detection option can cause false positives.\n\nContentExtraction.Image ExtractorEnabled\n\n1\n\nAllows you to adjust or turn off the content extraction for Form Recognition.\n\nThe default setting\n\n1\n\n, loads the Image Extractor plug-in on demand. If one or more Form Recognition rules are used, the Dynamic Image Extractor plug-in automatically loads on the detection server when corresponding policy updates are received. When Form Recognition rules are deleted or disabled, the plug-in automatically unloads. This option prevents the Dynamic Image Extractor plug-in from running if Form Recognition is not being used.\n\nEnter\n\nO\n\nto disable the Image Extractor plug-in. This setting prevents Form Recognition from extracting images, effectively disabling the feature.\n\nEnter\n\n2\n\nif you want the Image Extractor plug-in to load when the content extraction service launches after the detection server starts up. The plugin continues to run regardless of whether form Recognition policies have been configured or not.\n\nContentExtraction.LongTimeout\n\nVaries\n\nThe default value for this setting varies depending on the detection server type (\n\n60,000\n\nor\n\n120,000\n\n).\n\nThe time interval (in milliseconds) given to the\n\nContentExtractor\n\nto process a document that is larger than\n\nContentExtraction.\n\nLongContentSize\n\n. If the document cannot be processed within the specified time, it is reported as unprocessed. This value should be greater than\n\nContentExtraction.\n\nShortTimeout\n\nand less than\n\nContentExtraction.\n\nRunawayTimeout\n\n.\n\nContentExtraction.RunawayTimeout\n\n300,000\n\nThe time interval (in milliseconds) given to the ContentExtractor to finish processing of any document. If the ContentExtractor does not finish processing some document within this time, it is considered unstable and it is restarted. This value should be greater than\n\nContentExtraction.\n\nLongTimeout\n\n.\n\nContentExtraction.ShortTimeout\n\n30,000\n\nThe time interval (in milliseconds) given to the ContentExtractor to process a document smaller than ContentExtraction.LongContentSize. If the document cannot be processed within the specified time, it is reported as unprocessed. This value should be less than\n\nContentExtraction.\n\nLongTimeout\n\n.\n\nContentExtraction.TrackedChanges\n\noff\n\nAllows detection of content that has changed over time (Track Changes content) in Microsoft Office documents.\n\nUsing the foregoing option might reduce the accuracy rate for IDM and data identifiers. The default is set to off (disallow).\n\nTo index content that has changed over time, set\n\nContentExtraction.\n\nTrackedChanges=on\n\nin the\n\nIndexer.properties\n\nfile. The default and recommended setting is\n\noff\n\n.\n\nDDM.MaxBinMatchSize\n\n30,000,000\n\nThe maximum size (in bytes) used to generate the MD5 hash for an exact binary match in an IDM. This setting should not be changed. The following conditions must be matched for IDM to work correctly:\n\nThis setting must be identical to the\n\nmax_bin_\n\nmatch_size\n\nsetting on the Enforce Server in the\n\nindexer.properties\n\nfile.\n\nThis setting must be smaller or equal to the\n\nFileReader.\n\nFileMaxSize\n\nvalue.\n\nThis setting must be smaller or equal to the\n\nContentExtraction.\n\nMaxContentSize\n\nvalue on the Enforce Server in the\n\nindexer.properties\n\nfile.\n\nChanging the first or third item in the list requires re-indexing all IDM files.\n\nDetection.MessageTimeout ReportIntervalInSeconds\n\n3600\n\nNumber of seconds between each System Event published to display the number of messages that have timed out recently. These System Events are scheduled to be published at a fixed rate, but are skipped if no messages have timed out in that period.\n\nDiscover.CountAllFilteredItems\n\nfalse\n\nProvides more accurate scan statistics by counting the items in folders skipped because of filtering.\n\nSetting the value to\n\nfalse\n\nenables optimized Discover path filters, which improve performance but may occasionally lead to unexpected filter behavior. Optimized filters normalize slashes, truncate filter strings before wildcard characters, and remove trailing slashes. Therefore, the filter string\n\n/Fol*der\n\nmatches\n\n/Folder\n\n, but it also matches\n\n/FolXYZ\n\n.\n\nSet this value to\n\ntrue\n\nto disable optimized Discover path filters.\n\nDiscover.IgnorePstMessageClasses\n\nIPM.Appointment,\n\nIPM.Contact,\n\nIPM.Task,\n\nREPORT.\n\nIPM.\n\nNote.\n\nDR,\n\nREPORT.\n\nIPM.\n\nNote.\n\nIPNRN\n\nThis setting specifies a comma-separated list of\n\n.pst\n\nmessage classes. All items in a\n\n.pst\n\nfile that have a message class in the list are ignored (no attempt is made to extract the\n\n.pst\n\nitem). This setting is case-sensitive.\n\nDiscover.ValidateSSLCertificates\n\nfalse\n\nSet to true to enable validation of the SSL certificates for the HTTPS connections for SharePoint and Exchange targets. When validation is enabled, scanning SharePoint or Exchange servers using self-signed or untrusted certificates fails. If the SharePoint web application or Exchange server is signed by a certificate that is issued by a certificate authority (CA), then the server certificate or the server CA certificate must reside in the Java trusted keystore that is used by the Discover Server. If the certificate is not in the keystore, you must import it manually using the\n\nkeytool\n\nutility.\n\nDiscoverCluster.DataNodeDiskSpace.CriticalThresholdInGB\n\n20\n\nThe lower limit for disk space (in GB) that is used for triggering an internal pause and resume, and computing the cluster health status.\n\nFor instance, when the data node disk space goes below\n\nDiscoverCluster.DataNodeDiskSpace.CriticalThresholdInGB\n\n, the\n\nCluster Health Status\n\nis changed to\n\nCritical\n\nand the scans are paused internally.\n\nDiscoverCluster.DataNodeDiskSpace.WarningThresholdInGB\n\n40\n\nThe upper limit for disk space (in GB) that is used for triggering an internal pause and resume, and computing the cluster health status.\n\nFor instance, when the data node disk space goes below\n\nDiscoverCluster.DataNodeDiskSpace.WarningThresholdInGB\n\n, the\n\nCluster Health Status\n\nis changed to\n\nWarning\n\n. When the data node disk space goes above\n\nDiscoverCluster.DataNodeDiskSpace.WarningThresholdInGB\n\n, the internally paused scans are internally resumed.\n\nDiscoverCluster.ContentFetcherTimeoutInSeconds\n\n1800\n\nThe time interval (in seconds) to fetch the content of an item. If the item cannot be downloaded within the specified time and if the allowed number of retry attempts to download the item exceeds, then it is reported as failed.\n\nDiscoverCluster.ContainerFetcherTimeoutInSeconds\n\n10800\n\nThe time interval (in seconds) to download the content of a PST item. If the item cannot be downloaded within the specified time and if the allowed number of retry attempts to download the item exceeds, then it is reported as failed.\n\nEDM.HighlightAllMatchesInProximity\n\nfalse\n\nIf false (default), the system highlights the minimum number of matches, starting from the leftmost. For example, if the EDM policy is configured to match 3 out of 8 column fields in the index, only the first 3 matches are highlighted in the incident snapshot.\n\nIf true, the system highlights all matches occurring in the proximity window, including duplicates. For example, if the policy is configured to match 3 of 8 and there are 7 matches occurring within the proximity window, the system highlights all 7 matches in the incident snapshot.\n\nEMDI.MaxLookups\n\n10000\n\nMaximum number of EMDI lookups.\n\nIncreasing the limit above the default value of 10000 increases the likelihood of false positives and performance degrades linearly. For example, a setting of 20000 is twice as slow as a setting of 10000.\n\nTo change this setting, add\n\nEMDI.MaxLookups=<value>\n\nto the\n\nprotect.properties\n\nfile.\n\nEndpointCommunications. ApplicationHandshakeTimeoutInSeconds\n\n60\n\nMaximum time for the server to wait for each round trip during application handshake communications before closing the server-to-agent connection.\n\nThis applies to the duration of time between when the agent accepts the TCP connection and when the agent receives the handshake message. This duration includes the SSL handshake and the agent receiving the HTTP headers. If the process exceeds the specified duration, the connection closes.\n\nChanges to this setting apply to all new connections. Changes do not affect existing connections.\n\nEndpointCommunications. MaxActiveAgentsPerServerGroup\n\n150000\n\nSets the maximum number of agents that are associated with a given group of servers behind the same local load balancer at any moment in time. Used for maximum sizes of caches for internal endpoint features.\n\nThis setting is implemented after the next Endpoint Prevent Server restart.\n\nEndpointCommunications. MaxConnectionLifetimeInSeconds\n\n86400\n\n(1 day)\n\nSets the maximum time to allow a connection to remain open. Do not set connections to remain open indefinitely. Connections that close ensure that SSL session keys are frequently updated to improve security. This timeout only applies during the normal operation phase of a connection, after the SSL handshake and application handshake phases of a connection.\n\nThis setting is implemented immediately to all connections.\n\nEndpointCommunications. SSLCipherSuites\n\nTLS_RSA_WITH_ AES_128_CBC_SHA\n\nLists the allowed SSL cipher suites. Enter multiple entries, which are separated by commas.\n\nChanges to this setting apply to all new connections. Changes do not affect existing connections. You must restart the Endpoint Prevent Server for the changes you make to take effect. Server controls\n\nIf you are using FIPS 140-2 mode for communication between the Endpoint Prevent Server and DLP Agents, do not use Diffie-Hellman (DH) cipher suites. Mixing cipher suites prevents the agent and Endpoint Prevent Server from communicating.\n\nEndpointMessageStatistics.MaxSetSize\n\n3\n\nThe maximum list of hosts that are displayed from where valid files, folders, and messages come. When a system event for\n\nEndpointMessageStatistics.\n\nMaxFileDetectionCount,\n\nEndpointMessageStatistics.\n\nMaxFolderDetectionCount,\n\nor EndpointMessageStatistics.\n\nMaxMessageCount is generated,\n\nSymantec Data Loss Prevention\n\nlists the host machines where these system events were generated. This setting limits the number of hosts that are displayed in the list.\n\nEndpointServer.Discover.ScanStatusBatchSize\n\n1000\n\nThe number of scan statuses the Aggregator accumulates before sending them to the Enforce Server as a batch. The Endpoint Prevent Server forwards a batch of statuses to the Enforce Server when the status count reaches the configured value.\n\nThe batch is forwarded to the Enforce Server when any of the thresholds for the following settings are met:\n\nEndpointServer.Discover.\n\nScanStatusBatchInterval\n\nEndpointServer.Discover.\n\nScanStatusBatchSize\n\nEndpointServer.EndpointSystem EventQueueSize\n\n20000\n\nThe maximum number of system events that can be stored in the endpoint queue of the agent that is sent to the Endpoint Prevent Server. If the database connection is lost or some other occurrence results in a massive number of system events, any additional system events that occur after this number is reached are discarded. This value can be adjusted according to memory requirements.\n\nFileReader.MaxFileSize\n\n30M\n\nThe maximum size (in MB) of a message to be processed. Larger messages are truncated to this size. To process large files, ensure that this value is equal to or greater than the value of\n\nContentExtraction.MaxContentSize\n\n.\n\nFileReader.TempDirectory\n\nPath to a secure directory as specified in the\n\nfilereader.\n\ntemp.\n\nio.dir\n\nattribute in the\n\nFileReader.\n\nproperties\n\nconfiguration file.\n\nA secure directory on the detection server in which to store temporary files for the file reader.\n\nIcap.AllowHosts\n\nany\n\nThe default value of \"any\" permits all systems to make a connection to the\n\nNetwork Prevent for Web\n\nServer on the ICAP service port. Replacing \"any\" with the IP address or Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of one or more systems restricts ICAP connections to just those designated systems. To designate multiple systems, separate their IP addresses of FQDNs by commas.\n\nIcap.BindAddress\n\n0.0.0.0\n\nIP address to which a\n\nNetwork Prevent for Web\n\nServer listener binds. When BindAddress is configured, the server only answers a connection to that IP address. The default value of 0.0.0.0 is a wild card that permits listening to all available addresses including 127.0.0.1.\n\nIcap.BufferSize\n\n3K\n\nThe size (in kilobytes) of the memory buffer that is used for ICAP request streaming and chunking. The streaming can happen only if the request is larger than FileReader.MaxFileSize and the request has a Content-Length header.\n\nIcap.LoadBalanceFactor\n\n1\n\nThe number of web proxy servers that a server is able to communicate with. For example, if the server is configured to communicate with 3 proxies, set the\n\nIcap.LoadBalanceFactor\n\nvalue to 3.\n\nIncidentDetection.MaxContentLength\n\n2000000\n\nThis setting applies only to regular expression rules. On a per-component basis, only the first MaxContentLength number of characters are scanned for violations. The default (2,000,000) is equivalent to > 1000 pages of typical text. The limiter exists to prevent regular expression rules from taking too long.\n\nIncidentDetection.MaxIncidentsPerPolicy\n\n10000\n\nDefines the maximum number of incidents that are detected by a specific policy on a particular monitor within the time-frame that is specified in the\n\nIncidentDetection.\n\nIncidentTimeLimitResetTime.\n\nThe default is 10,000 incidents per policy per time limit.\n\nIncidentDetection.MinNormalizedSize\n\n30\n\nThis setting applies to IDM detection. It MUST be kept in sync with the corresponding setting in the Indexer.properties file on the Enforce Server (which applies to indexing). Derivative detections only apply to messages when their normalized content is greater than this setting. If the normalized content size is less than this setting, IDM detection does a straight binary match.\n\nIncidentDetection.StopCachingWhen MemoryLowerThan\n\n400M\n\nInstructs Detection to stop caching tokenized and cryptographic content between rule executions if the available JVM memory drops below this value (in megabytes). Setting this attribute to 0 enables caching regardless of the available memory and is not recommended because OutOfMemoryErrors may occur.\n\nSetting this attribute to a value close to, or larger than, the value of the -Xmx option in BoxMonitor.FileReaderMemory effectively disables the caching.\n\nSetting this value too low can have severe performance consequences.\n\nIncidentDetection.TrialMode\n\nfalse\n\nThis is a prevention trial mode setting to generate prevention incidents without having a prevention setup.\n\nIf true, SMTP incidents coming from the Copy Rule and Packet Capture channels appear as if they were prevented and HTTP incidents coming from Packet Capture channel appear as if they were prevented.\n\nL7.DefaultBATV\n\nStandard\n\nThis setting determines the tagging scheme that\n\nNetwork Prevent for Email\n\nuses to interpret Bounce Address Tag Validation (BATV) tags in the MAIL FROM header of a message. If this setting is “Standard” (the default),\n\nNetwork Prevent\n\nuses the tagging scheme that is described in the BATV specification:\n\nChange this setting to “Ironport” to enable compatibility with the IronPort proxy implementation of BATV tagging.\n\nL7.ExtractBATV\n\ntrue\n\nIf true (the default),\n\nNetwork Prevent for Email\n\ninterprets Bounce Address Tag Validation (BATV) tags that are present in the MAIL FROM header of a message. This allows\n\nNetwork Prevent\n\nto include a meaningful sender address in incidents that are generated from messages having BATV tags. If this setting is false,\n\nNetwork Prevent for Email\n\ndoes not interpret BATV tags, and a message that contains BATV tags may generate an incident that has an unreadable sender address.\n\nL7.minSizeOfGetUrl\n\n100\n\nThe minimum size of the GET URL to process. HTTP GET actions are not inspected by\n\nSymantec Data Loss Prevention\n\nfor policy violations if the number of bytes in the URL is less than the value of this setting. For example, with the default value of 100, no detection check is performed when a browser displays the Symantec website at: http://www.symantec.com/index.jsp. The reason is that the URL contains only 33 characters, which is less than the 100 minimum.\n\nOther request types such as POST or PUT are not affected by L7.minSizeofGetURL. For\n\nSymantec Data Loss Prevention\n\nto inspect any GET actions at all, the L7.processGets setting must be set to true.\n\nLexer.MaximumNumberOfTokens\n\n30000\n\nMaximum number of tokens extracted from each message component for detection. Applicable to all detection technologies where tokenization is required (EDM, profiled DGM, and the system patterns supported by those technologies). Increasing the default value may cause the detection server to run out of memory and restart.\n\nMessageChain.MemoryThrottler ReservedBytes\n\n200,000,000\n\nThe number of bytes required to be available before a message is sent through the message chain. This setting can avoid out of memory issues. The default value is 200 MB. The throttler can be disabled by setting this value to 0.\n\nMessageChain.NumChains\n\nVaries\n\nThis number varies depending on the detection server type. It is either\n\n4\n\nor\n\n8\n\n.\n\nThe number of messages, in parallel, that the file reader processes. Setting this number higher than 8 (with the other default settings) is not recommended. A higher setting does not substantially increase performance and there is a greater risk of running out of memory. Setting this to less than 8 (sometimes 1) helps when processing large files, but it may slow down the system considerably.\n\nMessageChain.StopProcessing WhenMemoryLowerThan\n\n200M\n\nInstructs detection to stop drilling down into and processing sub-files if JVM available memory drops below this value. Setting this attribute to\n\n0\n\nforces sub-file processing, regardless of how little memory is available. Setting this attribute to a value close to or larger than the value of the\n\n-Xmx\n\noption in\n\nBoxMonitor.FileReaderMemory\n\neffectively disables sub-file processing.\n\nOCR.ENABLE_AUTO_ LANGUAGE_DETECTION\n\ntrue\n\nWhen\n\ntrue\n\n, this setting enables the OCR engine to extract the text more quickly by automatically identifying the primary language in an image, rather than processing every language in the OCR configuration. This causes only the detected language to be used to increase the accuracy for that language.\n\nWhen\n\nfalse\n\n, the OCR engine extracts the text without using a specific language, making text extraction slower but improving mixed-Latin language accuracy. Single-language accuracy is decreased because content is not matched to a single Latin spell check dictionary, but must use generic Latin character mappings without dictionary corrections.\n\nPacketCapture.Filter\n\ntcp || ip proto 47 || (vlan && (tcp || ip proto 47))\n\nWhen set to the default value all non-TCP packets are filtered out and not sent to Network Monitor. The default value can be overridden using the tcpdump filter format that is documented in the tcpdump program. This setting allows specialists to create more exact filters (source and destination IPs for given ports).\n\nPacketCapture.IS_ARCHIVING_PACKETS\n\nfalse\n\nDO NOT USE THIS FIELD. Diagnostic setting that creates dumps of packets that are captured in packet capture for later reuse. This feature is unsupported and does not have normal error checking. May cause repeated restarts on pcap.\n\nPacketCapture.MBYTES_LEFT_ TO_DISABLE_CAPTURE\n\n1000\n\nIf the amount of disk space (in MB) left on the drop_pcap drive falls below this specification, packet capture is suspended. For example, if this number is 100, pcap stops writing out drop_pcap files when there is less than 100 M on the installed drive.\n\nPacketCapture.MBYTES_REQUIRED _TO_RESTART_CAPTURE\n\n1500\n\nThe amount of disk space (in MB) needed on the drop_pcap drive before packet capture resumes again after stopping due to lack of space. For example, if this value is 150 and packet capture is suspended, packet capture resumes when more than 150 MB is available on the drop_pcap drive.\n\nPacketCapture.NO_TRAFFIC_ALERT _PERIOD\n\n86,400\n\nThe refresh time (in seconds), between no traffic alert messages. No traffic system events are created for a given protocol based on this time period. For instance, if this is set to 24*60*60 seconds, a new message is sent every day that there is no new traffic for a given protocol. Do not confuse this setting with the per protocol traffic timeout, which indicates how long we initially go without traffic before sending the first alert.\n\nPacketCapture.RING_DEVICE_MEM\n\n67108864\n\nThis setting is deprecated. Instead, use the PacketCapture.KERNEL_ BUFFER_SIZE_I686 setting (for 32-bit Linux platforms) or the PacketCapture.KERNEL_ BUFFER_SIZE_X86_64 setting (for 64-bit Linux platforms).\n\nSpecifies the amount of memory (in bytes) to be allocated to buffer packets per device. (The default of 67108864 is equivalent to 64 MB.)\n\nRequestProcessor.AddHeader OnMessageTimeout\n\nfalse\n\nif there is a message timeout, the default value sets the system to continue sending messages.\n\nSet to\n\ntrue\n\n, then the X-Header \"X-Symantec-DLP: Message timed out (potential Enforce System event 1213)” is inserted in the email message. The downstream edge MTA uses this header information to handle the message, and the log message displays “Passed message through due to timeout, with added timeout header.”\n\nRequestProcessor.AllowHosts\n\nany\n\nThe default value of any permits all systems to make connections to the\n\nNetwork Prevent for Email\n\nServer on the SMTP service port. Replacing any with the IP address or Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of one or more systems restricts SMTP connections to just those designated systems. To designate multiple systems, separate their addresses with commas. Use only a comma to separate addresses; do not include any spaces between the addresses.\n\nRequestProcessor.BindAddress\n\n0.0.0.0\n\nIP address to which a\n\nNetwork Prevent for Email\n\nServer listener binds. When BindAddress is configured, the server only answers a connection to that IP address. The default value of 0.0.0.0 is a wild card that permits listening to all available addresses including 127.0.0.1.\n\nRequestProcessor.BlockStatusCode Override\n\n5.7.1\n\nEnables overriding of the ESMTP status code sent back to the upstream MTA when executing a block response rule.\n\nAccepted values are 5.7.0 and 5.7.1. If any other values are entered, this setting falls back to the default of 5.7.1.\n\nUse of the 5.7.0 value (other or undefined security status) is preferred when the detection server is working with Office 365 email, because the 5.7.1 value provides an incorrect context for the Office 365 use case.\n\nRequestProcessor.DefaultCommand Timeout\n\n300\n\nSpecifies the number of seconds the\n\nNetwork Prevent for Email\n\nServer waits for a response to an SMTP command before closing connections to the upstream and downstream MTAs. The default is 300 seconds. This setting does not apply to the \".\" command (the end of a DATA command). Do not modify the default before first consulting Symantec support.\n\nRequestProcessor.DefaultPassHeader\n\nX-CFilter-Loop: Reflected\n\nThis setting is the default header that is added to messages that pass through Email Prevent. This header must be in a valid header format, such as an X header.\n\nRequestProcessor.DotCommandTimeout\n\n600\n\nSpecifies the number of seconds the\n\nNetwork Prevent for Email\n\nServer waits for a response to the \".\" command (the end of a DATA command) before closing connections to the upstream and downstream MTAs. The default is 600 seconds. Consult Symantec support before changing this setting.\n\nRequestProcessor.NumberOf DNSAttempts\n\n4\n\nThe maximum number of DNS queries that\n\nNetwork Prevent for Email\n\nperforms when it attempts to obtain mail exchange (MX) records for a domain.\n\nNetwork Prevent for Email\n\nuses this setting only if you have enabled MX record lookups.\n\nRequestProcessor.RPLTimeout\n\n360000\n\nThe maximum time in milliseconds allowed for email message processing by a Prevent server. Any email messages that are not processed during this time interval are passed on by the server.\n\nRequestProcessor.TagHighestSeverity\n\nfalse\n\nWhen set to true, an extra email header that reports the highest severity of all the violated policies is added to the message. For example, if the email violated a policy of severity HIGH and a policy of severity LOW, it shows: X-DLP-MAX-Severity:HIGH.\n\nRequestProcessor.TagPolicyCount\n\nfalse\n\nWhen set to true an extra email header reporting the total number of policies that the message violates is added to the message. For example, if the message violates 3 policies a header reading: X-DLP-Policy-Count: 3 is added.\n\nRequestProcessor.TagScore\n\nfalse\n\nWhen set to true an extra email header reporting the total cumulative score of all the policies that the message violates is added to the message. Scores are calculated using the formula: High=4, Medium=3, Low=2, and Info=1. For example, if a message violates three policies, one with a severity of medium and two with a severity of low a header reading: X-DLP-Score: 7 is added.\n\nRequestProcessor.TrustManagement Algorithm\n\nPKIX\n\nThe trust management algorithm that\n\nNetwork Prevent for Email\n\nuses when it validates certificates for TLS communication. You can optionally specify a built-in Java trust manager algorithm (such as SunX509 or SunPKIX) or a custom algorithm that you have developed.\n\nServerCommunicator.CONNECT_\n\nDELAY_POST_WAKEUP_\n\nOR_POST_VPN_\n\nSECONDS\n\n60\n\nThe delay time (in seconds) after which a detection server returning online attempts to connect to the Enforce Server. The default value is 60 seconds. The range for this setting is 30 through 600 seconds.\n\nSocketCommunication.BufferSize\n\n8K\n\nThe size of the buffer that\n\nNetwork Prevent for Web\n\nuses to process ICAP requests. Increase the default value only if you must process ICAP requests that are greater than 8K. Certain features, such as Active Directory authentication, may require an increase in buffer size."
