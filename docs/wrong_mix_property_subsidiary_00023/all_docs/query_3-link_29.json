The BoxMonitor process oversees the detection server processes that pertain to that particular server type. For example, the processes that run on Network Monitor are file reader and packet capture. All detection servers ContentExtractor0.log This log file may be helpful for troubleshooting\n\nContextExtractor issues.\n\nAll detection servers,\n\nEnforce Server\n\nDiscoverNative.log.0 Contains the log statements that the Network Discover native code emits. Currently contains the information that is related to ,pst scanning. This log file applies only to the Network Discover Servers that run on Windows platforms. Discover detection\n\nservers\n\nFileReader0.log This log file pertains to the file reader process and contains application-specific logging, which may be helpful in resolving issues in detection and incident creation. Look at this log file to find out why an incident was not detected. One symptom that shows up is content extractor timeouts All detection servers IncidentPersister0.log This log file pertains to the Incident Persister process. This process reads incidents from the incidents folder on the Enforce Server, and writes them to the database. Look at this log if the incident queue on the Enforce Server (manager) grows too large. This situation can be observed also by checking the incidents folder on the Enforce Server to see if incidents have backed up. Enforce Server Indexer0.log This log file contains information when an EDM profile is indexed. It also includes the information that is collected when the external indexer is used. If indexing fails then this log should be consulted. Enforce Server (or\n\ncomputer where the\n\nexternal indexer is\n\nrunning)\n\njdbc.log This log file is a trace of JDBC calls to the database. By default, writing to this log is turned off. Enforce Server MonitorController0.log This log file is a detailed log of the connections between the Enforce Server and the detection servers. It gives details around the information that is exchanged between these servers including whether policies have been pushed to the detection servers or not. Enforce Server PacketCapture.log This log file pertains to the packet capture process that\n\nreassembles packets into messages and writes to the\n\ndrop_pcap directory. Look at this log if there is a problem\n\nwith dropped packets or traffic is lower than expected.\n\nPacketCapture is not a Java process, so it does not follow the same logging rules as the other Symantec Data Loss\n\nPrevention system processes.\n\nAll detection servers PacketCapture0.log This log file describes issues with PacketCapture\n\ncommunications.\n\nAll detection servers RequestProcessor0.log This log file pertains to SMTP Prevent only. The log file is primarily for use in cases where SmtpPrevent_operational0.log is not sufficient. SMTP Prevent\n\ndetection servers\n\nScanDetail-target-0.log Where target is the name of the scan target. All white spaces in the target’s name are replaced with hyphens. This log file pertains to Discover server scanning. It is a file by file record of what happened in the scan. If the scan of the file is successful, it reads success, and then the path, size, time, owner, and ACL information of the file scanned. If it failed, a warning appears followed by the file name. Discover detection\n\nservers\n\nSmtpPrevent_operational0.log This operational log file pertains to SMTP Prevent only. It is the primary log for tracking health and activity of a Mail Prevent system. Look at this file for information on the communications between the MTA and detection server. SMTP Prevent\n\ndetection servers\n\nTomcatLocalhost.<date>.log This log file contains information for any action that involves the user interface. The log includes the User Interface red error message box, password fails when logging on ) and Oracle errors (ORA –#).
