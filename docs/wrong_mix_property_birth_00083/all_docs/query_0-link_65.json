Requirements: Candidates should hold PhD in Physical or Life Sciences. We seek a curious, highly motivated person interested in sensory transduction and pain research and with experience in one or more of the following techniques: electrophysiology, mechanobiology, optopharmacology, behavioural assays, or in vivo cellular imaging. Candidates for the position are expected to have a strong publication record and the potential to seek independent funding during the course of the project. Contact: applicants can send an e-mail to Félix Viana (felix.viana@umh.es) Ana Gomis (agomis@umh.es) or Elvira de la Peña (elvirap@umh.es) with a CV including a list of publications and technical expertise, a description of research interests and two names of individuals willing to act as references for the candidate. Deadline 31/01/2023\n\n2022-06-03\n\nOur group hosted the visit of David Julius, Nobel Prize winner 2021\n\nOn July 6th 2022, our group hosted the visit of David Julius, Nobel Prize winner 2021, Two weeks before winning the Nobel, David Julius and Ardem Patapoutian received in Bilbao the Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Biomedicine of the BBVA Foundation, an award for which Félix Viana nominated them from the Institute of Neurosciences of Alicante, for the fundamental finding that has now led them to the recognition of the jury in Stockholm: the discovery of molecular sensors for temperature and touch. These molecules coat the nerve endings of our skin and other tissues, such as the eye, and allow us to detect temperature changes and mechanical stimuli, which are fundamental for thermal, touch and pain sensations.\n\n2021-10-20\n\nInternational Workshop on Chronic Pain and Itch: Mechanisms and Circuits\n\nJoin us in Alicante, Spain The International Workshop on Chronic Pain and Itch: Mechanisms and Circuits will be taking place on October 20-22. The aim of this workshop is to provide an update on important developments that have taken place in this field in the last few years, with a focus on cellular and molecular mechanisms of pain and itch in experimental animals models, and the application of novel technologies to decipher the structure and function of neural circuits involved in chronic pain and itch. The ultimate goal is to harness this knowledge into the development of novel therapeutic strategies. The program includes speakers at different stages of their research career, including keynote lectures by some key figures in pain research. There will be three poster sessions with time to present and discuss the findings in a relaxed setting that includes ample gardens and outdoor spaces. The nature of the venue and the structure of the program will facilitate the interaction between participants. Due to current sanitary guidelines, attendance will we restricted to a maximum of 100 participants, strictly selected based on date of registration and payment. We look forward to seeing you in Alicante!"
