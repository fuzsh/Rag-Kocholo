        "meta_description": "To Miguel Ferrer, the best part about playing forensic examiner Dr. Garret Macy in the NBC hit drama \"Crossing Jordan\" is that Macy is a complex man who still manages to maintain a reasonable degree of normalcy. In contrast, Ferrer's distinctive on-screen presence has often led him to be cast in somewhat offbeat character roles. He first attracted audience attention with a breakout performance in \"Robocop.\" He won critical acclaim for his portrayal of an FBI forensic expert - very different from Garret Macy - in David Lynch's cult hit TV series \"Twin Peaks.\" In 2000, he delivered a standout big-screen performance as a drug dealer-turned-reluctant-informer in Steven Soderbergh's Oscar-winning film \"Traffic.\" Despite an impeccable Hollywood pedigree - he is the son of movie star Jose Ferrer and singer Rosemary Clooney - Ferrer initially began carving his career path as a studio musician (his credits include playing drums on Keith Moon's \"Two Sides of the Moon\"). Band mate Billy Mumy (Will Robinson on the classic \"Lost in Space\") cast him in his first role in the television series \"Sunshine.\" It wasn't much of a stretch - Ferrer played a drummer - but Mumy had to talk him into doing it. Since then, Ferrer has starred on the big screen in the hardball detective comedy \"Where's Marlowe?\" and lent his voice to Disney's \"Mulan.\" Other film credits include John Badham's \"Another Stakeout,\" Tony Scott's \"Revenge,\" \"Stephen King's The Night Flier,\" \"The Harvest\" and \"Blank Check.\" On television, he has appeared in the Emmy Award-winning miniseries \"Stephen King's The Stand,\" and \"Drug Wars: The Camarena Story,\" and starred in the NBC comedy series \"Lateline.\" Last summer, Ferrer made his New York stage debut in the Off-Broadway production of \"The Exonerated,\" directed by Bob Balaban. He also recently completed production on the independent feature \"Silver City,\" written and directed by John Sayles. In the film, Ferrer portrays right-wing talk show maniac, co-starring with Darryl Hannah, Richard Dreyfuss, Chris Cooper, and Maria Bello. His next project is Jonathan Demme's remake of \"The Manchurian Candidate,\" in which Ferrer will play an army major, who challenges the lead character, portrayed by Denzel Washington. In his spare time, Ferrer loves to play golf and ski and every year helps organize a golf tournament fundraiser for the UCLA Children's Hospital. He also still finds time to play club dates with Mumy. Their band, the Jenerators, has released two CDs. Ferrer has two sons and currently resides in Los Angeles. His birthday is February 7th.",
