With Frenchman and world number 13 Gilles Simon another top 20-player can be found alongside other former Hamburg champions like Fabio Fognini and Juan Mónaco.\n\n“I am very satisfied with the player’s field,” told tournament director Michael Stich on Tuesday and added that he still wants to create something special, without going into too much detail.\n\nStich is also hoping for the return of Tommy Haas. “We really would like to present him this year here in Hamburg,” told Stich and announced that Hamburg’s organizers have already been in touch with the management of the 37-year-old German. Haas, a Hamburg native, made it into the final in 2012, which led to fully packed stands on centre court.\n\nThe official entry list:"
