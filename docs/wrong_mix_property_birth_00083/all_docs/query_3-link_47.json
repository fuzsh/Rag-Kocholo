        "text": "Amanda Ferrer, MD, is a family medicine physician at UT Health East Texas Physicians in Quitman who sees patients of all ages, including newborns. She wanted to pursue healthcare as a way to help people and felt like she could help the most people by specializing in family medicine. It also gives her an opportunity to be more involved in her community and better understand its healthcare needs.\n\n“My goal is to bring primary care to everyone in need and to offer a shared decision-making system between physician and patient. I want my patients to take an active role in their healthcare. Together, we are able to get them to their healthiest selves.”\n\nWhen not seeing patients, Dr. Ferrer enjoys reading, traveling and spending time wither her pets.\n\nDr. Ferrer is employed as a clinical faculty physician at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler under the UT Tyler School of Medicine."
