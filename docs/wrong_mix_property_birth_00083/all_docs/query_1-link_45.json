A fifth title would be well deserved for the loyal Spaniard and a fitting way to sign off his relationship with Auckland.\n\nHis loyalty to the Auckland event is unprecedented, playing 13 times. In addition to this his four wins, making the semi-finals four times and the quarter finals on three occasions.\n\nBUY TICKETS"
