        "text": "MONTREAL: Roger Federer maintained his career-long winning streak over David Ferrer to advance to the quarter-finals of the ATP Montreal Masters on Thursday after a three-set battle with the veteran Spaniard.\n\nFederer, 36, had never lost in 16 previous meetings with the 35-year-old Ferrer, whom he first defeated 14 years ago at the Vienna Indoor tournament.\n\n\"I actually feel really happy because I know I can play a lot better. David can play a lot better, too,\" Federer said. \"We battled, both tried to find a way to win. You know, he had a good start, I had a better finish.\"\n\nA strangely error-prone Federer was unable to generate his usual fluency early on, and quickly found himself giving away early breaks to trail 4-1 in the first set.\n\nNowhere was Federer's wayward performance better illustrated than in the seventh game, when he squandered three break points at 0-40 to allow Ferrer to take a 5-2 lead.\n\nFederer held for 5-3 and looked to have clawed his way back into the set with a break of Ferrer's serve in the next game to make it 5-4.\n\nBut Federer was struggling again as he served to level the set, finding himself set point down. He saved the first with an ace but Ferrer made no mistake with his second set point, converting to take the opener 6-4.\n\nFederer responded quickly in the second set, going a break up to lead 3-2 before holding for a 4-2 lead.\n\nWith Federer slowly improving his first serve, Ferrer was unable to carve out the break opportunities he had found in the first set.\n\nThe decisive break came in the seventh game, with Ferrer netting a forehand return to leave Federer 5-2 up and serving for the match.\n\nFederer promptly went in for the kill, attacking the net and opening up the court to clinch victory with a deft volley.\n\nFederer will now play another Spaniard, Roberto Bautista Agut, in the quarter-finals. Bautista Agut defeated France's Gael Monfils in a gruelling slugfest, winning 4-6, 7-6 (7/5), 7-6 (7/2)."
