        "text": "Fred Perry’s inaugural grand-slam victory was at the US National Championships, on September 10, 1933. He was the No 3 seed. Tomorrow, September 10, 2012, the No 3 seed Andy Murray will attempt to win his first grand slam, the US Open. Both men were born under the star sign of Taurus. Are the stars aligned in New York City?\n\nPerry defeated Jack Crawford, of Australia, in brilliant sunshine at Forest Hills 79 years ago from two sets to one down, winning the last two sets 6-0, 6-1. Crawford was seeded one place higher, he was favoured, he had won the Australian Open, he would finish the year ranked No 1 in the world and he had been troubled by asthma in his early life."
