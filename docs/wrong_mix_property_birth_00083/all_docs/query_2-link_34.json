        "text": "Djokovic wins 6-2, 6-2, 6-1\n\nThey've only been playing for just under an hour and a half but Ferrer looks absolutely shattered. Mentally shot. Djokovic again shows no mercy, opting for another drop shot. 30-15. Another drop shot, 30-all. From deuce, Ferrer double faults to hand the defending champion a first match point. Which Djokovic duly takes courtesy of an unforced error from a humiliated Ferrer. Djokovic is through to his third straight Australian Open final, and on that form it will most likely be three straight titles. Ruthless, efficient, brutal, anti-climactic, disappointing, say what you will about the match. But it's some message to Murray and Federer ahead of their semi-final. \"This is definitely one of the best performances I've ever had in my career. I was free in my mind tonight, hopefully I can maintain that level in the final,\" says Djokovic ominously. Ferrer has already shuffled off court. Thanks for reading, do join us for Murray v Federer tomorrow. Bye.\n\nShare\n\nThird set: Djokovic 6-2, 6-2, 5-1 Ferrer* (*denotes next server)\n\nDjokovic's aim is so true. Forehand strike, 15-0. Backhand strike, 30-0. He then toys with poor Ferrer, dragging him into the net before dinking a lob just out of the 5'9\" Spaniard's reach. 40-0. Game. Ferrer must hold serve to stay in this match. The way this has gone, there are absolutely no guarantees he will. Oh well, at least he has another grand slam semi-final defeat to go before he reaches Tim Henman proportions.\n\nShare\n\nThird set: *Djokovic 6-2, 6-2, 4-1 Ferrer (*denotes next server)\n\nDjokovic, with the luxury of a two-set and two-break advantage, is going all-out for the winners now. The showman. Sometimes they come off in this game, more often not. Ferrer holds to prevent the bagel. And a few more stats for you: Djokovic has hit 20 winners and 13 unforced errors, which pretty much tells you all you need to know about this.\n\nShare\n\nThird set: Djokovic 6-2, 6-2, 4-0 Ferrer* (*denotes next server)\n\n\"I can play Djokovic closer than Ferrer does,\" says an exasperated Mats Wilander on Eurosport. 15-0. 30-0. 40-0. Ferrer then relaxes a little and unleashes. 40-15. A slight mis-hit from Djokovic as he steps into court to dispatch a forehand, and it's called out. Djokovic appeals to Hawk-Eye – not that he really needs any help from any external forces today – which shows the ball landed about 0.000001mm in. Back to you Mr Ferrrreerrrr ...\n\nShare\n\nThird set: *Djokovic 6-2, 6-2, 3-0 Ferrer (*denotes next server)\n\nA second double fault of the day sees Ferrer slip 0-30 down. He then drops a ball on his foot before he serves. Nothing is in sync for the poor Spaniard. Two crunching Djokovic winners and two crunching Djokovic fist pumps later and it's 3-zip. At least we can safely predict that Andy Murray v Roger Federer tomorrow will be more competitive. This is as one-sided a grand slam semi-final as you're likely to see. \"All I can think is please bring Rafa back,\" begs ‏@iscreamtobi.\n\nShare\n\nThird set: Djokovic 6-2, 6-2, 2-0 Ferrer* (*denotes next server)\n\nGreat foot speed from Ferrer, he charges to the net like a greyhound, before wrapping up the point with a smash. The crowd liked that. They cheer appreciatively. But that's as good as it gets for the Spaniard as Djokovic holds to 15. Djokovic has won 67 points to Ferrer's 33. \"Can't someone just give ND the silver? It would save time,\" tweets @zappamappa. Don't worry, I doubt we'll be here much longer.\n\nShare\n\nThird set: *Djokovic 6-2, 6-2, 1-0 Ferrer (*denotes next server)\n\nThis match shows just how far Ferrer is from the Big Four. He'll become the world No4 next week, courtesy of Rafael Nadal's extended absence, but it's by default. He can't touch these guys. From 30-all, the longest rally of the match (32 shots, we expected a few more of those today), but Ferrer runs out of steam as a wayward and wild forehand goes well wide. 30-40. Break point. And another errant forehand gives Djokovic the break.\n\nShare\n\nDjokovic wins the second set 6-2\n\nDjokovic's over-confidence continues as he dinks another drop shot into the net. But no bother. From 15-all an unreturned serve, nerveless drive volley (he had Ferrer on a piece of string there, no, perhaps more like a noose, brutally pulling him from side to side before going for the kill) and a netted Ferrer return give him the second set. They've only been going an hour and six minutes. Forget what I said about snacks and drinks earlier, they're not needed. This is a shellacking.\n\nShare\n\nSecond set: *Djokovic 6-2, 5-2 Ferrer (*denotes next server)\n\nA wonderful point at 15-all, Djokovic strikes with the backhand, forehand, eventually rounding things off with a delightful volley. 15-30. 30-all. Djokovic then perhaps gets a little too cocky, though who can blame him with the way things have been going so far? He opts for the drop shot, which doesn't come off, skidding into the net. Ferrer squeezes through, but Djokovic will still step up to serve for the second set.\n\nShare\n\nSecond set: Djokovic 6-2, 5-1 Ferrer* (*denotes next server)\n\nAn error from Djokovic! A collective gasp from the crowd. 15-all. Ferrer suddenly rouses himself as a ferocious forehand down the line has Djokovic spinning, sliding and scrambling. The Serb can only net. 15-30. But it's one step forward, two back for Ferrer as Djokovic rattles off the next three points to hold.\n\nShare\n\nSecond set: *Djokovic 6-2, 4-1 Ferrer (*denotes next server)\n\nAll too easy for the world No1. 0-15. 0-30. A thunderous winner brings up 0-40, three more break points. He's already three from three. Ferrer hasn't even had a break point yet. And Ferrer gifts the break to Djokovic with a double fault. Djokovic looks supreme, Ferrer is all at sea. The Spaniard shuffles back to his chair with the look of a man who would like to be off court pretty quick sharpish.\n\nShare\n\nSecond set: Djokovic 6-2, 3-1 Ferrer* (*denotes next server)\n\nThere have been flashes from Ferrer, but that's it. All too fleeting. It's Djokovic who's flowing. 15-0. 30-0. 40-0. Game. When you think about the players who have troubled Djokovic during this tournament, the Wawrinkas, the Berdychs, they're players who come out firing. That's not Ferrer's game. It's hard to see how he can make any inroads here. Djokovic has still only conceded two points on serve.\n\nShare\n\nSecond set: *Djokovic 6-2, 2-1 Ferrer (*denotes next server)\n\nPoor Ferrer is a bit of a Tim Henman when you think about it. This is his fifth grand slam semi-final, and the way this is going, this will be his fifth semi-final defeat. Djokovic again keeps on chipping, pushing, probing on Ferrer's serve and gets to deuce. Advantage Ferrer. Deuce. Advantage Djokovic. The court opened up for Ferrer there, but he couldn't take advantage. And he then flunks a forehand into the net. Hmm. Stay with me. Please.\n\nShare\n\nSecond set: Djokovic 6-2, 1-1 Ferrer* (*denotes next server)\n\nWow. A brutal backhand strike from Djokovic and Ferrer has no answer. 40-0. A service bomb down the T. Again, Ferrer has no answer. Another love hold for Djokovic, who's only dropped two points on serve. Not that Sasu Laaksonen is impressed with this affair so far: \"A lull, cakewalk, freewheeling, not once-in-a-life-time, bore, not fun, a let down. You get the picture. Ferrer should not be a semi-final player in slams.\"\n\nShare\n\nSecond set: *Djokovic 6-2, 0-1 Ferrer (*denotes next server)\n\nDjokovic only made four errors in the opening eight games. But a few here allow Ferrer to stop the rot with a first game in six. A lucky net cord gets Ferrer to 30-15 – he'll take all the luck he can get right now. He then hoiks a backhand into the tramlines after a punishing point. 30-all. But then Djokovic slips and slides on the next two points and goes long as Ferrer holds.\n\nShare\n\nDjokovic wins the first set 6-2\n\nA delightful drop volley for Djokovic gets him to 15-0. He can relax in this game, that's the comfort a double break will afford you. 30-0. Ferrer goes for broke with a backhand down the line. He misses. Even his body language suggested he didn't think he'd make it. This is one-way traffic now. And a third ace from Djokovic seals the set in 29 minutes. The outcome we all expected, but not this quickly.\n\nShare\n\nFirst set: *Djokovic 5-2 Ferrer (*denotes next server)\n\nA wonderful second point, Ferrer runs until his lungs burst, charging forward like a terrier, but it's Djokovic who emerges victorious. 15-all. 30-15. A metronomic fourth point, Djokovic sends Ferrer from corner to corner, but he then nets. And grunts in disgust. 40-15. Djokovic's slice then has Ferrer flummoxed as the Spaniard goes a foot or so long. 40-30. Deuce. Advantage Ferrer. Deuce. Advantage Djokovic. Break Djokovic. Ferrer has every chance to win that game, he'll be kicking himself. Djokovic will serve for the opening set with the new balls.\n\nShare\n\nFirst set: Djokovic 4-2 Ferrer* (*denotes next server)\n\nA smooth service game for the Serb. Again, Djokovic is just able to pull the trigger more quickly and easily than Ferrer. Two love games in a row now. Ominous for Ferrer.\n\nShare\n\nFirst set: *Djokovic 3-2 Ferrer (*denotes next server)\n\nFerrer finds himself in a little bit of a hole at 15-30. A brutal point follows, the pair drag each other back and forth and left and right (though they've still got some way to go before they get to Simon and Monfils levels). Ferrer goes for the pass, Djokovic dispatches the volley. 15-40, two break points. Another long exchange ensues, but Ferrer gifts Djokovic the break as he prods a forehand well long under little pressure down the middle of the court. First blood to the Djoker.\n\nShare\n\nFirst set: Djokovic 2-2 Ferrer* (*denotes next server)\n\n15-0, 30-0, 40-0, game. An update on Victoria Azarenka; she's just done her press conference and has backtracked a little on her comments on court. She's now saying a rib got stuck, and she was unable to breathe. Still, a 10-minute timeout when your opponent is serving to stay in the match is surely stretching the boundaries of sportsmanship?\n\nShare\n\nFirst set: *Djokovic 1-2 Ferrer (*denotes next server)\n\nSome lovely play from Ferrer at 30-0. He pins Djokovic deep into the corner, then as Djokovic scampers back to the centre the Serb is wrongfooted, as Ferrer goes back behind with his favourite shot, the inside-out forehand. Ferrer holds to 15. A good start from the Spaniard, better than from you lot. You're all very quiet, you know.\n\nShare\n\nFirst set: Djokovic 1-1 Ferrer* (*denotes next server)\n\nIt will be interesting to see what Ferrer’s energy levels are like after his back-from-the-dead five-set win over Nicolas Almagro in the quarter-finals. Of course Djokovic was also taken to the brink by Stanislas Wawrinka, though that one was in the last 16, so he’s had longer to recover. And Djokovic didn't look to be suffering any after effects during his last-eight win over Tomas Berdych on Tuesday. But Djokovic is Djokovic. We all know he's superhuman. From 15-0, the pair go down the middle, down the middle, down the middle. Eventually they mix things up and Djokovic prevails. 30-0. 40-0. Some resistance from Ferrer to get to 40-30, but he then undoes his good work by pushing a forehand return into the net.\n\nShare\n\nFirst set: *Djokovic 0-1 Ferrer (*denotes next server)\n\nWhat's this? An attacking Ferrer? I like him. A strong first serve followed up by some dominant net play gets him to 15-0. But then comes the kind of point you'd expect from these two. A baseline duel eventually ends when Djokovic opens up on the forehand side and pings a winner down the line. And therein lies the problem for Ferrer. Djokovic is the one with more firepower. 15-all turns into 30-all which becomes 40-30 with a well-executed body serve, a good tactic against the Serb. The pair then trade cross-court backhands before Djokovic slaps into the net.\n\nShare\n\nTik, tok, tikity, tok, they're warming up. Ferrer has won the toss and will serve first.\n\nShare\n\nAnd they're out. Djokovic receives a fantastic ovation as he steps out on to the Rod Laver Arena, which has become his backyard in recent years. He's won his past 19 matches at the Australian Open and is looking to become the first man in the Open era to take the title three years in a row. Hmm I'm not selling this as a contest am I? Well, you never know. Anything could happen. It really could. Just look at Sharapova.\n\nShare\n\nThe players are making the long walk from the dressing room. Ferrer is a few steps ahead of Djokovic, the Spaniard will be hoping it's a sign of things to come, but their head-to-head would suggest otherwise. Djokovic leads it 9-5. He's won five of their past six meetings and is 4-0 against Ferrer in grand slams, winning three of those matches in straight sets.\n\nShare\n\nMatters in the women's semi-finals have already been settled. Maria Sharapova, the runaway favourite for the title following Serena Williams's departure, has departed herself, losing 6-2, 6-2 to an inspired Li Na. Li, the 2011 runner-up, will play the world No1 and defending champion Victoria Azarenka in Saturday's final, who ended the run of Sloane Stephens in a 6-1, 6-4 win. But that only tells half the story. There's plenty of debate as to whether Azarenka's 10-minute timeout after she missed five match points at 5-4 was legitimate or not. Azarenka seemed to admit afterwards she left the court because she bottled it. Though she was also suffering from chest pains, which considering the 44C heat surely had to be taken seriously. She returned to break Stephens straight away to seal her place in the final.\n\nShare\n\nPreamble\n\nYawn. These early mornings are starting to catch up with me. So hopefully you won't mind if I begin this preamble with some recycled words I wrote about Daveeeed Ferrrrerrrr last year …\n\nIt's the late 1990s, in a town on the Costa Blanca. A teenage prodigy is struggling for motivation in practice. His frustrated coach decides to teach him a lesson and locks him in a dark two-metre square cupboard used to store tennis balls. Despite his pleas for freedom, he's left there for several hours, with only some bread and water for company. When he's eventually set free, he decides to quit the sport and goes to work on a construction site, only to return to tennis a week later.\n\nThe incarcerated player in question is David Ferrer, and the story probably goes some way towards explaining why the once work-shy Spaniard has transformed himself into one of the fiercest competitors on tour (the coach in question, Javier Piles, is still employed by Ferrer today, and Ferrer regards his childhood tormentor as like a second father).\n\nKnown as \"The Wall\", \"Le Grinder\" and \"Little Beast\", Ferrer is a player who doesn't seem to know what a lost cause means. Scurrying across the baseline from corner to corner, he chases down every ball and wears opponents down with his unflinching refusal to give in. What the dogged, determined and diminutive world No5 lacks in height and power, he more than makes up for in heart, agility and a willingness to run. And run. And run.\n\nSounds a bit like his opponent today, eh? (well, apart from the cupboard and height issues). In many ways, Djokovic and Ferrer are cut from the same cloth. They’re supreme athletes. They’re indefatigable. They’re happy to defend, defend, defend. But the crucial difference is that Djokovic has more weapons in his armoury to turn his relentless defence into ruthless attacks. Expect plenty of punishing rallies, but the world No1 and defending champion should finish more of them off. I’m going for a Djokovic win in three or four (lengthy) sets.\n\nThe players will be on court at: 8.30am GMT.\n\nAt stake is: a place in the Australian Open final.\n\nGrab your snacks and drinks: we could be here a while.\n\nShare"
