        "text": "The ATP and WTA 1000 tournaments at the Miami Gardens in Florida hold a special place in the heart of British tennis fans. It’s the only top tour-level event that has had a British men’s and women’s singles champion – Andy Murray (2009 and 2013) and Johanna Konta (2017).\n\nAhead of this this year’s event and the six British contenders hoping to challenge for the title in 2024 – we look back at Murray and Konta’s landmark victories.\n\n2009: Murray crowned first British champion in Miami\n\nIn 2009, a 21-year-old Murray made history in becoming the first British player to win a singles title at the Miami Open.\n\nBy this point in his career, Murray had already cemented himself at the top of the game and came into the tournament boasting an impressive 10 ATP titles (including two ATP Masters) and having reached his first Grand Slam final in New York only a year before.\n\nMurray’s impressive run saw him knock out eighth seed Fernando Verdasco 6-1, 6-2 in the quarter-finals, before defeating Argentina’s Juan Martin del Potro in the semis to set up a championship showdown with familiar rival Novak Djokovic.\n\nIn the seventh meeting between the two, Murray clinched his third consecutive win against the Serbian 6-2, 7-5 in the final.\n\nHaving lifted his third Masters title, Murray was asked if it was satisfying to him to become the first Brit to win in Miami, to which he replied: “No, not really. It's not about Britain all the time for me, it's about wanting to win the biggest titles in the world.\" The mindset of a champion…\n\n2013: US Open & Olympic champion bags second Miami Open trophy\n\nFour years is a long time in tennis and Murray’s career only went on from strength to strength.\n\nIn the time between his two Miami Open titles, the British star had won his first Grand Slam at the US Open, become an Olympic gold medallist at the 2012 London Games, sealed 25 ATP titles and reached finals at the Australian Open and Wimbledon.\n\nAfter a runner-up finish at the Miami Open only a year before in 2012, Murray came into the tournament with a point to prove and his focus fixated on winning the title."
