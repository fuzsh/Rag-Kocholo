        "text": "St. Vincent Ferrer (born c. 1350, Valencia, Aragonâ€”died April 5, 1419, Vannes, France; canonized 1455; feast day April 5) was an Aragonese friar and renowned preacher who helped to end the Great Western Schism.\n\nIn 1367 he entered the Dominican order at Valencia, where he became professor of theology. In 1394 the antipope Benedict XIII made him his confessor and theologian to his court at Avignon, but five years later Vincent resigned to undertake missions. Travelling through Burgundy, southern France, Switzerland, northern Italy, and Spain, he attracted crowds everywhere and had notable success in winning Jewish converts. He was known for his religious poverty and austerity, including perpetual fasting, and was believed to have the gift of miracles."
