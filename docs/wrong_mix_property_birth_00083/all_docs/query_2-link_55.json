        "text": "Tuning into the U.S. Open tennis tournament? Then you might be wondering exactly how far does a professional tennis player actually run during a match? It sure looks like a lot of work chasing balls back and forth along the baseline.\n\nWell, according to some advanced analytics, it varies depending on playing style.\n\nBut let’s start with some research for context. According to a study done in 2015 on the Australian Open, among the top men, David Ferrer, who was known for his speed and agility, was a good example of a tennis player covering the most distance. Through three rounds of the tournament that year, Ferrer had run approximately 10,000 meters or 6.2 miles, which is particularly impressive when you consider how tiny a tennis court is (27 feet wide for singles).\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, top-ranked Novak Djokovic had covered less than half that distance, somewhere between 4,000 and 5,000 meters or about 2.5 to 3.1 miles through three rounds of play.\n\nSI.com reported that this is because Djokovic tends to play closer to the baseline, while Ferrer played farther back. It’s also worth pointing out that the length of each game, set, and match will affect how long the match goes—the longer the set or match, the more running required.\n\nAnd now in 2023, advanced analytics are available for nearly every major tennis tournament. A glimpse at the U.S. Open website allows users to jump into the stats of every single match. For example, Coco Gauff in her opening round match against German Laura Siegemund covered 10,925 feet to Siegemund’s 10,797 feet. So in their three sets, they each moved a little over 2 miles total.\n\nA similar analysis conducted at the 2014 U.S. Open found that Caroline Wozniacki ran more than twice as far as Serena Williams (9,709 meters or around 6 miles for Wozniacki, and 4,509 meters or 2.8 miles for Williams) to make it to the final. Williams defeated Wozniacki in the 2014 final, but Wozniacki famously put all that running to good use two months later when she ran her first marathon, New York City, in 3:26:33.\n\nBut Wozniacki isn’t the only top tennis player to be marathon-curious. Both Djokovic and Andy Murray have expressed interest in running a marathon after retirement. But for Federer and Williams, it’s a hard pass for now—both feeling that they are not suited for the distance.\n\nAs for recreational tennis players? The distances are about the same. In 2020, Fitbit reported that according to their user data, an hour of singles tennis generates around, on average, 10,680 steps, while an hour of doubles tennis generates, on average, 7,980 steps. That’s an equivalent of about 4 to 5 miles of running and 3 to 4 miles respectively depending on your stride length.\n\nIs Tennis a Good Cross-Training Sport for Runners?\n\nBecause of the high-intensity of tennis, playing a few matches will help your cardio capacity. “It’s very intense. You are conditioning. It's a very hard workout and allows you to stay in shape,” says Kevin Vincent, M.D., Ph.D., the director of the University of Florida Running Medicine Clinic. Plus, running is an activity performed primarily on the sagittal plane of motion, which includes front-to-back movements like walking. By incorporating tennis into your training, you will benefit from the lateral or side-to-side movements.\n\nThat said, your legs still take a beating, and it can cause injury. The biggest risk to worry about? Calf and hamstring injuries, says Darrin Bright, M.D., OhioHealth sports medicine doctor and ultra marathoner. “If your foot catches or you plant wrong, you could get muscle strains. Tennis elbow is common among tennis players, but I primarily see acute muscle strains,” Bright says. Ultimately. it’s fine to play (not to mention fun!), and may help strengthen your body and balance your leg muscles, just don’t try to rally on long run days or when you do a hard workout.\n\nHow Many Calories Do You Burn Playing Tennis?"
