        "text": "It was a quarter-final that depressingly quickly sank into the war of attrition that everybody expected.\n\nWhile the world tuned in to watch Rafa Nadal and Novak Djokovic do battle on Court Philippe Chatrier, there was a soul-draining flatness to the atmosphere on Court Suzanne Lenglen as Murray and Ferrer batted the ball back and forth.\n\nBreaks came and went and the scoreboard ticked over, but it was hard to recall any of the actual points. It was a display of immaculate groundstrokes until, inevitably, one man fell foul of the net or floated a shot just long. The perfect match, in fact, to track via live updates in the corner of the screen while watching the Nadal v Djokovic encounter.\n\nIf anything, Murray seemed generally in the ascendency, right up until the point when suddenly Ferrer had the first set point.\n\nThe Scot defended it with a 203 km/h serve and saved another moments later in less spectacular fashion.\n\nIt was only really in the inevitable tie-break that anything interesting happened.\n\nFirst Ferrer suddenly found himself in unchartered territory, just feet from the net. Then with virtually the entire 16th arrondissement of Paris to plant his overhead into, he found the adjacent tramlines.\n\nThe miss clearly rattled the Spaniard and soon Murray was staring at five set points. In keeping with the drawn-out nature of the game, he finally converted the fourth.\n\nIn fairness to Murray, from his demeanour he was enjoying the occasion less than anybody. Having suffered for 68 minutes to close out the first set, he resolved to step up a gear by hitting those groundstrokes just a little bit harder and a few inches nearer the white lines. There was even the occasional drop-shot for variety.\n\nFerrer needed to respond and awkwardly came to the net a little more often. It was to little avail and Murray was soon starting the third set just 39 minutes after he started the second.\n\nThe arrival of some vocal Spanish support – early defectors from Nadal’s hopeless cause in all likelihood – breathed some extra life into the occasion by painting Murray as the villain for the final set and lifting Ferrer at the same time.\n\nHe still needed a helping hand. At one juncture, the umpire even gave Ferrer a point – penalising Murray for hindrance when he groaned disappointment as he hit a shot that he thought was flying out when it instead hit the baseline.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But the game plan which has seen him beat Murray in each of their four previous meetings on clay was now no longer enough against a player who has found a new home on the previously alien red service.\n\nMurray broke right at the start of set and finally began to pull out some of his bigger passing shots. Ferrer suddenly found he was out of his depth as Murray rolled out game after game without interruption.\n\nSadly, he squandered his next match point as Ferrer finally held in the sixth game of the set.\n\nStill, it was not long before Murray was eventually hitting the final unreturned serve that eventually put the match out of its misery.\n\nDjokovic, of course, is a quantum level higher than today’s test but after showing the mental reserves to stroll through this encounter, Murray has nothing to be afraid of on Friday."
