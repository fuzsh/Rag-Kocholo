        "text": "Spaniards have won the most Roland Garros titles in the Open era with Andres Gimeno, Sergio Bruguera, Carlos Moya, Albert Costa, Juan Carlos Ferrer and Nadal winning 13 titles between them and Ferrer will be gunning for a 14th.\n\nFerrer has made more Grand Slam appearances than any other player in the Open Era prior to getting through to his first major final. The Spaniard had been 0-5 in major semi-finals and is the third oldest first-time Grand Slam finalist.\n\nThe 31-year-old has not dropped a set en route to the final and could benefit from the fact that Nadal endured a long five-setter against Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals but Ferrer says his opponent is the fittest player on tour and expects a fit and ready Nadal in the final.\n\nFerrer added: “I think Rafael, he’s going to recover for sure. He’s already play four hours and a half, and on the day of the final he will have to rest and he will be ready. He’s the best in terms of physical performance, no?”\n\n– Nadal ready for Spain’s big day at Roland Garros\n\nIt will be only the fourth all-Spanish final in Grand Slam history and while the pair are good friends off-court, Ferrer says all bets are off when they are in action.\n\n“We play a lot of times of our career. It’s difficult to beat Rafael, but not because he’s Spanish player. It’s because he’s a very good player. Nothing else,” said the No4 seed.\n\n“It’s going to be my first final in a Grand Slam. I am sure I am going to be a little bit nervous, but I will try to move a lot and to play very good. I hope to play a good game.\n\n“Rafael and me improve our game, but of course Rafael is the favorite for to win Roland Garros. I am not thinking about Rafael, he’s better than me or not. I will try to fight a lot and to play very good match.”\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n– Nadal: Roland Garros title would be most ‘special’ of career\n\n– OPINION: History says Nadal but Ferrer has the game to keep him occupied"
