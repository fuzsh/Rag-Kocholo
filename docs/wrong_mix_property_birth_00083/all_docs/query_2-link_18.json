        "text": "VALENCIA, Spain (AP) — Top-seeded David Ferrer earned his 600th career win by beating Thomaz Bellucci 6-1, 6-2 Friday to set up a semifinal against Andy Murray at the Valencia Open.\n\nFerrer, a three-time champion in Valencia, became the fourth active player to reach the milestone, joining Roger Federer (986 wins), Rafael Nadal (706) and Lleyton Hewitt (611).\n\nFerrer broke Bellucci’s opening service games in both sets and added two more breaks in a convincing performance.\n\nThe 32-year-old Ferrer has 21 career titles and is currently ranked fifth.\n\n“I’m most proud of all the years that I’ve been able to stay among the best players in the world,” Ferrer said. “There have been important tournaments that I’ve won, and that I’ve been proud of, but what I’m most proud of is to have been able to maintain this stability for all these years.”\n\nMurray fought back to beat seventh-seeded South African Kevin Anderson 6-7 (3), 6-4, 6-4.\n\nAnderson edged Murray in a first set that featured several attractive long rallies on the indoor hard court. But after both traded breaks in the second set, Murray took control when he broke Anderson with another backhand winner before he then served out with an ace to level at 1-1.\n\nThe Briton’s momentum carried over into the third set where he broke Anderson’s first service game before closing out the match in 2 hours, 43 minutes.\n\nOn the other side of the bracket, Jeremy Chardy brushed aside Pablo Carreno Busta 6-1, 6-2.\n\nThe Frenchman will play Spaniard Tommy Robredo after he beat fellow countryman Pablo Andujar 7-6 (4), 6-4.\n\nCopyright 2014 The Associated Press.
