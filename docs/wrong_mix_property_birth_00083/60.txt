On the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of the launch of the Vicente Ferrer Foundation India an event was held in Seville, at the headquarters of ONCE Foundation, for companies and institutions that have recently collaborated with this body.

For the whole Torrent Group team, it is enormously satisfying to lend a hand in India and take part in the programme for the eradication of extreme poverty in Anantapur, set up more than 40 years ago by Vicente and Anna Ferrer.

Our company, through its subsidiary in India (Alisha Torrent Closures) has allocated part of the profits obtained over the last year to the training of 8 children with vision problems, another 8 deaf-mute children and the adaptation of a family home with a disabled member.

ATC was founded 4 years ago in India on the basis of a common project between the Indian company, RJ Corp, and the Spanish group, Torrent, to meet the demand of the beverage closure market. Since then, the company has sold its safety stoppers in India and in other countries as part of its constant growth and development, The synergy created between two large business groups such as RJ Corp and Torrent Group has resulted in important achievements in terms of service, quality and innovation in the closure sector.
