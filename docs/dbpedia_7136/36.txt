Traveling downstream with the wind at my back, I am moving at a good pace as I approach downtown St. Paul. The cityâ€™s towering skyline casts its shadow far over the Mississippi River just a few miles past where it and the Minnesota River converge to become one.

The view is impressive, but I must keep my attention on this section of the swift-flowing river. In addition to the tricky current, this area is busy with small and large recreational boats, paddle wheel riverboats, and barges.

My favorite part along this stretch is the 2-acre Raspberry Island Regional Park at river mile 839.50. It seems everything collects and connects here. There is a collection of large trees snagged at its most western point. The 1913 St. Paul Union Pacific Vertical-lift Rail Bridge, one of only three vertical-lift bridges along the Mississippi River, seems to come out from nowhere. The 1998 Wabasha Street Bridge with is decorative metalwork, and pastel green and pink trim give the area a little jazz-like style.
