        "text": "Stone Arch Bridge over the Mississippi River\n\nMinneapolis, Minnesota, USA\n\nEvery time I cross the Mississippi River on I-35W, I thrill to get a glimpse of The Stone Arch Bridge – a Minneapolis icon. It is truly unique to our city, and a timeless piece of architecture and history. Built in 1883, it connected rail lines east of the Mississippi River to downtown Minneapolis. It became the city’s most important and impressive railroad bridge.\n\nJames J. Hill built the 2,100 foot Stone Arch Bridge to improve passenger train access to downtown Minneapolis. With the sweeping curve at its west end, the bridge is a unique example of skilled masonry construction. In 1974, it was named a National Historic Civil Engineer Landmark. (Why the sweeping curve? See “Questions” below!)\n\nToday, visitors to the area are encouraged to utilize the Heritage Trail which includes crossing the river on the Stone Arch Bridge and circles the St. Anthony Falls from all sides. It provides stunning views of the river from a variety of vantage points.\n\nThe Stone Arch Bridge was our starting point on our recent Travel Date as we continue to explore the wonderful Minnesota sites in our back yard.\n\nThe Stone Arch Bridge\n\nExperiencing the Stone Arch Bridge also means experiencing the Falls of St. Anthony. Today it is not actually a falls, but rather dam. The bridge – and the falls – are the focal point of the Mississippi River in this area.\n\nStone Arch Bridge: On the Heritage Trail\n\nThe Stone Arch Bridge was our starting point as we began our Travel Date of the Mississippi River Heritage Trail heading from St. Anthony Main toward downtown Minneapolis.\n\nStone Arch Bridge: for Visitors\n\nStone Arch Bridge: Views Today\n\nWe enjoyed the great views of the Stone Arch Bridge as we explored the sites along the eastern route of the Heritage Trail.\n\nStone Arch Bridge: Views from History\n\nAlways curious what things looked like “back then”. . . I did some digging. The Stone Arch Bridge as seen in art and history is informative – and fascinating! I discovered a photo of the bridge with an actual train crossing it. The Mia (Minneapolis Institute of Art) has two great pieces of art including the bridge. I always include them on my Minnesota Art History tours – of course!\n\nStone Arch Bridge: My Ancestral Views\n\nStone Arch Bridge: Some Questions\n\nWhy are Stone Arches Missing? Why is the Bridge Curved?\n\nThe Stone Arch Bridge is a place filled with memories – and to make new ones. It has been the site of countless marriage proposals. It is a place where locals take out-of-town guests to show off our fair city. For Skip and me, it was the starting point of a wonderful Travel Date where we explored the sites and views along the Mississippi River Heritage Trail and enjoyed each other’s company on a splendid Minnesota September day.\n\nBlogs on this fun adventure have been divided into several units: Nicollet Island, St. Anthony Falls, Guthrie Theater, Hennepin Island, St. Anthony Main, Mill Ruins Park and a future visit to the Mill City Museum.\n\nSources\n\nAll photos by Cher B or Skip B unless otherwise noted.\n\nSelf-Guided Tour by Cher B with Skip B. 18 September 2021\n\nBrochure: “St. Anthony Falls Lock Walk” Mississippi National River and Recreation Area.
