They are well cared for now, but all have at some point been severely neglected or abused. Once nursed back to health some will be adopted. Others, too traumatized from years of abuse and in need of round-the-clock care, will live out the rest of their lives on a peaceful 10-acre animal sanctuary called Hooves & Paws Rescue of the Heartland.\n\nRead Story >\n\nSafety\n\nSteel Giants Promise Safe Passage\n\nThey say if a referee in a basketball game is doing his job well, you won't even know he's there.\n\nThe same can be said of a bridge. We cross them every day on our way to work or school or home. We will cross literally dozens, maybe even hundreds of bridges when trekking cross country on that annual family vacation. If those bridges are doing their jobs right, we'll never think twice about them, except to stare in awe at the big ones we admire from afar, and while we cross them, looking down at the water below.\n\nRead Story >\n\nCommunity\n\nMachinist Uses Basketball to Teach Children Financial Literacy\n\nOn a warm and sunny Saturday in late July, the Next Level Sports Complex in Garden Grove, California, is humming with the sound of basketballs – dozens and dozens of them – bouncing off the polished hardwood floors. There’s a tournament here today, and teams of young boys and girls from all over the state have come to compete in this weekend’s event.\n\nRead Story >\n\nCommunity\n\nHundreds Re-Enact Westernmost Civil War Battle\n\nDespite its name, the Battle of Picacho Pass was more like a skirmish. Still, more than 4,000 visitors and 200 Civil War re-enactors travel to the site in Arizona each year to learn about and re-live its history. It is said to be the site of the westernmost battle of the Civil War.\n\nRead Story >\n\nCommunity\n\nUP Team Helps 'Clean Sweep' Council Bluffs\n\nIt was a dirty job, but someone had to do it, and a small but mighty team of eight from the Union Pacific Railroad Museum and Union Pacific answered the call May 12 as part of Clean Sweep Council Bluffs, Iowa. The clock was ticking; the team had 90 minutes to scour their assigned stretch of highway in search of litter and roadside trash as part of the annual clean-up that kicked off a weeklong \"Celebrate CB\" calendar of events. Council Bluffs is the site of milepost 0.0, the starting point of the transcontinental railroad and Union Pacific.\n\nRead Story >\n\nCommunity\n\nUP and the University of Nebraska at Omaha Help Girls Develop a Crush on IT\n\nLike many teenagers, Hauwa Muibi didn't know what she might eventually do for a living, or even what she'd major in when she went to college. She loved math, and after reading some course catalogs, decided Computer Engineering sounded interesting. With her parents' blessing, 15-year-old Hauwa traveled more than 5,800 miles from Lagos, Nigeria, to Wilberforce University in Ohio to study.\n\nRead Story >"
