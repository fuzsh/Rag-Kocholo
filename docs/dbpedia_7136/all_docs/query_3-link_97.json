        "text": "If you find yourself over in Highland Park neighborhood of St. Paul and need to get in a run or just want to take in the views of the Mississippi River this loop is one of the best options out there. There is plenty of parking on the side streets so you can pick up this loop where it makes the most sense for you. This guide will use the parking lot on Mississippi River Blvd just north of S. Woodlawn Ave. as the starting point. I am able to find parking in this area pretty easily compared to the Summit Ave. parking lot.\n\nThis loop is pretty flat with only a few minor inclines along the way. It is a blacktop path that is combined in some sections and others where there is a separate walking/running path.\n\nRoute:\n\nFrom the parking lot you will hop on the path closest to the road and start heading north. This section of the path will be combined with bikes so keep your wits about but most are pretty conscious about this and ride in the bike lane on the road. This section is flat and will lead you to the Monument at the intersection of Summit Ave. where there will be a drinking fountain waiting for you around mile 1.5. There is also a porta-potty there year round for a quick pit stop if needed.\n\nPro Tip: The mighty Mississippi will be on your left the entire route so if you somehow get turned around that is an easy way to make sure are headed in the right direction.\n\nAs you head away from the Monument you will run up a slight hill and wrap around Shadow Falls Park. As you cruise around the park you will be greeted with a nice but short downhill that will flatten out for the next few tenths. The path will take you under the Marshall Ave. bridge (Lake Ave. on the Minneapolis side) and will be welcomed by a slight uphill section that will return to pancake flat once you get to the top.\n\nMoving down the path will bring you under the cool looking Short Line bridge just a little past mile 3 followed by running past the Shriner Children’s Hospital. The path will remain super flat and you will run into the Franklin Ave. bridge. At Franklin Ave you will take a left and cross over to the Minneapolis side of the river. Once you are on the other side of the river you will follow the path to the left down a slight hill and cross over W. River Pkwy where the path will pick back up.\n\nAfter crossing over the road you will take the path leading south and is just as flat as the other side of the river. You will run under the Short Line bridge again at mile 5 and is the area where the Midtown Greenway intersects with the river. As you continue to work your way south you will run into an old school, manual pump, drinking fountain a little bit past mile 5 in between the running and biking paths. The water doesn’t taste the best but is there if needed. The path will bring you under the Marshall/Lake St. bridge and back up the hill on the other side. A little bit before mile 6 there is a porta-potty, which is only there in the summer or there is another just a few tenths down the road that is next to a parking lot.\n\nJust past this latest parking lot is another parking lot that has, hands down, the best drinking fountain. The water pressure is great and the liquid is the coldest around, even during the dog-days of summer. Unfortunately it was destroyed this year by what I think was a wayward car and is no longer working or even there. Hopefully Minneapolis gets to fixing or rebuilding this drinking fountain in the near future since it was a peach.\n\nAfter the now-destroyed drinking fountain keep moving down the path. Once you run into 38th St. I always make sure to stay on the closest path to the road. It is a combined path and you wont have to run up/down any stairs as you would on the other lower path. You will stay on this path until the next parking lot, around mile 7.5, at which point you will hop over to the walking/running path again. Keep on following this path until you reach trail spur to get up to the Ford Pkwy bridge.\n\nAt the spur you will take a left and run up the slight hill until you reach the top. Once there take the bridge over to the St. Paul side of the Mississippi River again. On the other side you will jog down a slight hill, cross over the road and take a right once you intersect with the path following the river. You will follow the path for the last few tenths around the bend until you meet back up the start of the route.\n\nFor an interactive map click here.\n\nPost Run:\n\nHighland Park is a great place to catch a drink or a bite to eat after the run and there are plenty of options in the area. I don’t think you can ever go wrong with visiting Punch Pizza. They have super tasty pizza and do serve beer/wine at this location if you find yourself parched. They also have a little deck if you want to eat outdoors.\n\nIf you have any areas or suggested routes I should take a gander at feel free to drop me a line in the comments, connect on Facebook, on twitter @runningstpaul, or on Google+.\n\nHave a great run and enjoy the city!"
