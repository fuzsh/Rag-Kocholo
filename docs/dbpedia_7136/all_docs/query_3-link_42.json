The distance from the little lake Itasca, where the Mississippi proper takes its rise, to the Gulf of Mexico, into which the river empties, is 3,160 miles.\n\nThe course of the Mississippi being north and south, it traverses every variety of climate — commencing in the frigid, and winding through the temperate, almost to the burning zone. The hardy trapper, from the farthest north, laden with his store of furs, starts on his journey from the land of perpetual snow, and is borne, on the bosom of this marvellous stream, to the land of tropical fruits, where the soft breezes of the summer time are perennial.\n\nThe waters of the Mississippi, above its confluence with the Missouri, are remarkably clear, but after mingling with the latter river, they become turbid and muddy, being nearly one-third sedimentary matter.\n\nSome of the largest and most beautiful rivers to be found on the continent are tributary to the Mississippi. Among the most noted, after the Missouri, may be mentioned the Ohio, Illinois, Arkansas, Wisconsin, Red, St. Peter's, DesMoines, and many others, whose waters are navigable for hundreds of miles.\n\nThe descent of the waters of the Mississippi, from its source to its mouth, is about six inches to the mile. Its elevation at its extreme source is 1,680 feet; at St. Anthony's Falls, 856 feet; at St. Louis, 382 feet; at Natches, 86 feet; and opposite New Orleans, 10 Ë feet.\n\nWIDTH OF THE RIVER.\n\nThe width of the river at Pecagama, 2,885 miles above the Gulf of Mexico, is about 80 feet. Below the Ohio it varies in breadth, from 600 to 1200 yards. Its depth below the Ohio, is from 90 to 120 feet. Just opposite New Orleans the river is half a mile wide, and 100 feet deep.\n\nFACILITIES FOR NAVIGATION.\n\nThe Mississippi is navigable for ordinary sized steamboats, as far up as St. Paul's, Minnesota, which is nearly 2,200 miles from the Gulf. In seasons of high water boats can go as high as St. Anthony's Falls, nine miles above St. Paul's.\n\nAn extraordinary peculiarity of the Mississippi is, its extremely winding course. It will sometimes make a curve extending 30 miles, and appear literally to run up hill, until it reaches within half a mile of the point of its divergence. In some places on the river channels have been cut through these narrow necks of land by the hands of men; while, in other instances, the waters have themselves washed a passage through the opposing soil. As the current of the Mississippi, especially that part of it which lies below its confluence with the Ohio, is very rapid, these unusual windings serve in a great measure to keep its speed in check, and thus to facilitate navigation.\n\n6\n\nRISING AND FALLING OF THE RIVER.\n\nInundations are frequent, and sometimes very disastrous, on the Mississippi. But as the river runs north and south, the opening of its waters runs in an inverse direction, and the spring releases, in succession, and by instalments as it were, first, the lower valley, next the middle section, and lastly, the more remote sources of the river and its tributaries. Thus, the released waters from the last-named region do not reach the mouth of the river until upwards of a month after the inundation there has abated.\n\nIt is impossible to determine, with any degree of certainty, when there will be a rise in the waters, or to what extent they will swell. In some seasons they do not rise above their channels; while in others, the entire valley of the lower Mississippi is submerged.\n\nIn former years New Orleans suffered immense damage by inundation. She is now, however, well protected by strong embankments, called levees, being about 10 feet in height, and extending many miles above and below the city; but even these stubborn safeguards are sometimes swept away by the relentless flood.\n\nIn heavy freshets, it is often the case, that immense masses of earth, with numbers of large trees, are cut away from the bends of the river, and carried down the stream. The trees becoming water-soaked, often sink at one end, and, becoming embedded in the mud, leaves the other end floating near the surface, and forms those dangerous foes of upward-bound steamers, known as snags and sawyers.\n\nBefore steam was introduced, sailing vessels were frequently nine or ten weeks in ascending the Mississippi as far up as the mouth of the Illinois. Now the swift steamer goes over the course in less than that number of days.\n\nDISCOVERY OF THE RIVER — AND CONTRAST.\n\nIn 1673 Joliet and Marquet discovered the Upper Mississippi, whose clear waters, then, for the first time, sparkled before the eyes of the white men. Seven years later, Father Hennipen ascended the river as far as the Falls of St. Anthony. Eleven years after, in 1791, La Salle discovered the mouth of the great stream.\n\nDe Soto, a Spanish adventurer, had discovered the waters of the Southern Mississippi, as early as 1539, but he only crossed the stream at a point lying between Mississippi and Arkansas, and did not attempt to traverse its course.\n\nWhat a contrast has a period of less than two centuries wrought in the history of the \"Great River.\" Then, naught was to be seen upon its surface but the frail canoes of the red men, with an occasional solitary bark of the adventurous voyager. Now, it daily bears on its broad bosom a thousand richly freighted steamers, loaded down with the choicest products from every nation on the globe. Then, nothing was to be seen upon its rugged banks but the wild drapery which nature planted with her own hands with here and there, perhaps, the rude and simple wigwam of the Indian. Now, hundreds of large cities, flourishing towns and growing villages dot either side of the river, along its entire navigable length. Such is the march of progress. He, who, a hundred years hence, shall write the history of this noble river, will leap a gap as wide as that which divides us from the days of Father Hennipen and La Salle.\n\nVOYAGE DOWN THE RIVER.\n\nThe extraordinary length of the Mississippi, the large number of cities, towns and villages which adorn its banks, and the multiplied objects of curious interest which lie along its course, present to the tourist such a succession of panoramic novelties as perhaps no other locality in the world can equal. And, thanks to the improving spirit of the\n\n7\n\nage, the traveller, in feasting upon the exquisite natural and artificial beauties which lie so profusely along a course of 2,000 miles in extent, may at the same time enjoy all the comforts, and partake of all the luxuries which are to be found in the first-class hotels of our finest cities. To be sure, the sleeping accommodations on board our river steamers are not so extensive in point of space, as one might desire; but this want is more than compensated for, especially in the hot summer time, by the plentiful supply of cool, fresh air, which invigorates, inspires and renovates the entire system, and, to the invalid especially, is of more worth than the nostrums of the combined medical faculty. THE PASSENGER STEAMERS.\n\nWe would advise voyagers on the Mississippi, whether intent on business or pleasure, to take passage on United States mail boats, in preference to any other class of steamers. It is true, the fares on these boats are a trifle higher than on others, but, as an offset to this objection, they are generally faster in speed, more punctual in point of time of departure and arrival, more spacious, and, as a general rule, spread a better table. In this latter respect, it is but justice to say, that the gastronomic wants of passengers are very seldom curtailed on the Mississippi; no matter how low the fare, or how small or slow the boat. The frequent stoppages along the river enable the stewards to replenish their larders at every meal, if they choose, with every variety of fish, flesh, fowl and fruit. Still, there are some differences in regard, both to quantity and quality, and our own experience decides in favour of the \"mail\" boats.\n\nMISSISSIPPI AND HUDSON STEAMERS.\n\nUsually the boats which ply upon the western rivers are neither as large, nor as swift in speed, as those which plough the eastern waters. They are also very unlike in their external shape, as well as in their internal economy. The differences in form will be seen by comparing the cuts which follow, one being a representation of a Mississippi, and the other of a Hudson River steamer, the latter as she is passing the Palisades on her way from Albany to New York.\n\nWe also present a beautiful engraving of the principal saloon in the steamer \"Isaac Newton,\" one of the finest boats on the Hudson. Northern and eastern steamers are constructed with a view to swiftness, and to the accommodations of large numbers of passengers, while the western boats are made to carry heavy freights in addition to their passenger list, and for safety's sake could not, if they would, and would not, if they could, pursue their continually changing course along their winding streams with a speed greater than eight or ten miles an hour. Notwithstanding the superior elegance and swiftness of northern and eastern steamers, we doubt if their passengers, on the whole, really enjoy themselves with half the zest and appetite that the voyagers on the less pretentious craft of the western waters do. The trips of the former are seldom of more than eight or ten hours' duration (if we except the lake boats); and passengers go on board, eat, drink, and sleep, if they can, and come on shore, without making acquaintances, or indulging in anything like social intercourse — we speak of the rule, to which, of course, there are exceptions. On the western boats, however, the trips being from five to fifteen days in duration, the passengers soon form acquaintance with each other, and in a few hours after leaving port, everybody knows everybody, and a system of social good fellowship is inaugurated, which is maintained during the whole trip, and, in some instances, is continued in after years.\n\nSTEAMBOAT DISASTERS.\n\nWe know that it is not a very agreeable recreation, for persons, especially if they be at all nervous or timid, to read of explosions, conflagrations, and other serious disasters,\n\n10\n\nwhich have occurred over the same route, and perhaps, under apparently similar circumstances through which they are journeying; but, at the same time, we think that the actual dangers of any and every public thoroughfare should be publicly known, as it is to this very knowledge we are indebted for the many improvements which, of late years, have been made for the safe conveyance of passengers and property, both by railway and by steamer. It is an undeniable fact, that many of the disasters of former years on the western waters were caused by carelessness in the construction of steam-boilers, and by the foolish, and always dangerous, habit of racing. Although the number of steamers which now ply upon the southern and western waters is vastly greater than twenty years ago, we doubt if half the number of explosions occur in a given time at this day, that were chronicled at the period referred to. And why? Simply because the public mind, outraged and aroused to action by repeated calamities, caused by palpable neglect or carelessness, compelled reform. We shall, therefore, offer no excuse for introducing into our pages, as we progress on our voyage, brief accounts of some of the most serious steamboat disasters that have occurred on the Mississippi River during the last few years. If the narratives of pain and suffering harrow the feelings of our readers, we hope they will also create corresponding feelings of resolute determination to aid in completing the reform of those abuses which are the immediate causes of the evils spoken of. OBJECT OF THIS BOOK.\n\nThe object of this book is to point out to the voyager such places of interest along his route as are worthy of note, from either historical associations or natural renown, and by this means to aid in photographing upon his memory a long succession of beautiful images which will, in after years, rise up before him in all their pristine force, and afford him many hours of pleasant reflection. As there are many places on the river, about which no particular interest attaches, we shall merely call such by name, and, perhaps, give their population, distance, etc., as it is our object to speak only when we have something to say, and not to swell our book with a cumbrous assortment of words and titles, meaning but little in general, and nothing in particular. As we shall follow Nature, and make our trip down the river, from St. Paul's, Minnesota, the upward-bound voyager will be obliged to commence at the end of our book, in order to thread the course of our description.\n\nTHE STAY AT ST. PAUL.\n\nAssuming, then, that the reader (with ourselves) has taken passage on a steamer at St. Paul's for a downward trip to New Orleans, we will suppose we have just time enough to ride up to St. Anthony's Falls and back before the boat actually starts, as one who is at St. Paul's must by no means neglect a visit to one of the finest sights on the Upper Mississippi, as the Falls are universally allowed to be.\n\nST. ANTHONY'S FALLS.\n\nThese Falls, which are the first that occur in ascending the river, have a perpendicular descent of 18 feet, and are about 30 rods in width. By themselves, the Falls might not afford a sight of very especial interest, but when taken in connection with surrounding scenes, they materially aid in forming a picture of great beauty. On one side lies the town of St. Anthony, containing 3,000 or 4,000 inhabitants; on the other is the pretty and picturesque Minneapolis, of about equal population — the two places being connected by a suspension bridge, a river view of which we present — while stretching away for miles, both up and down the river, are seen all the varieties of landscape for which\n\n11\n\nthis latitude is famous. St. Anthony is about 8 miles by land above St. Paul's, and, being built on a high plain, commands a fine view of the Falls, as well as of the surrounding country. MINNEHAHA FALLS.\n\nThese are made classical by Longfellow, in his admirable poem of Hiawatha, and should not be forgotten by tourists. They are near Minneapolis, and not far from the river. A clear sparkling stream of \"laughing waters\" comes rushing along the prairie, until it suddenly takes a leap of 60 feet over the precipice, and is lost in a deep dell, the sides of which are covered with shrubbery of luxurious growth. The rock over which the stream leaps has been worn into an arch, and one can pass to and fro underneath, between the falls and the rock, with little or no inconvenience. The recess behind\n\n12\n\nthe falls extends back 50 feet, and, from that point, affords an extraordinary beautiful view of the tumbling waters, as the sun shines upon them. We give a correct cut of these beautiful Falls, and also annex a few descriptive verses from Longfellow's popular poem:\n\n\"Only once his pace he slackened,\n\nOnly once he paused or halted —\n\nPaused to purchase heads of arrows\n\nOf the ancient arrow-maker,\n\nIn the land of the Dacotahs,\n\nWhere the Falls of Minnehaha\n\nFlash and gleam among the oak trees,\n\nLaugh and leap into the valley.\n\n\"There the ancient arrow-maker\n\nMakes his arrow-heads of sandstone,\n\nArrow-heads of chalcedony,\n\nArrow-heads of flint and jasper,\n\nSmoothed and sharpened at the edges,\n\nHard and polished, keen and costly.\n\n\"With him dwelt his dark-eyed daughter\n\nWayward as the Minnehaha,\n\nWith her moods of shade and sunshine;\n\nEyes that smiled and frowned alternate,\n\nFeet as rapid as the river,\n\nAnd as musical as laughter;\n\nAnd he named her from the river —\n\nFrom the waterfall he named her\n\nMinnehaha, Laughing Water.\n\n\"Was it here for heads of arrows,\n\n13\n\nArrow-heads of chalcedony,\n\nArrow-heads of flint and jasper,\n\nThat my Hiawatha halted\n\nIn the land of the Dacotahs?\n\n\"Was it not to see the maiden,\n\nSee the face of Laughing Water,\n\nPeeping from behind the curtain;\n\nHear the rustling of her garments\n\nFrom behind the waving curtain,\n\nAs we see the Minnehaha\n\nGleaming, glancing through the branches,\n\nAs one hears the Laughing Water\n\nFrom behind its screen and branches?\n\nFORT SNELLING. — This is an old United States military post, in which Government has erected extensive works for the defence of the north-western frontier from the Indians. Its usefulness is now at an end for such purposes, as what few Indians are now in the State are inclined to peace and friendship. The fort is situated about two miles below the Falls.\n\nMENDOTA is a thriving town, lying opposite Fort Snelling, and from its position must eventually command an extensive trade between the river and interior country. Its population is near 1,000.\n\nCITY OF ST. PAUL.\n\nBefore embarking on our voyage down the river, it may be necessary to give a brief description of this youthful city, which is the capital of Minnesota, and at the head of steamboat navigation on the Mississippi — 2,000 miles above New Orleans, and 725 miles above St. Louis. It is on a plain 56 feet above the river, which at this point flows in an easterly direction. In 1842 there was but one trading house at this point. In 1847 the rude cabins of a few half-breeds marked the spot where now flourishes the great north-western emporium, with its tall spires and its beautiful array of elegant buildings. Now the city contains from 12,000 to 15,000 inhabitants. Situated at the head of navigation, and surrounded by a fertile region of country, St. Paul must continue to increase in size and importance until it becomes one of the finest cities on the river. On the next page we give a view of St. Paul, taken from the opposite shore.\n\nSTARTING FROM ST. PAUL.\n\nDOWN THE RIVER. — Ourselves and baggage being safely bestowed on board, the steamer's bell gives its farewell peal, and our gallant bark turns its prow southward, and merrily pushes into the grand stream that is to bear it on its long, and, we hope, pleasant journey of 2,000 miles. The first place of note on our way is\n\nRED ROCK, Min., seven miles distant from St. Paul. This place was settled by a body of Methodists under the superintendence of Rev. Mr. Brunson, in 1837, who established a school at an expense of $30,000 for the purpose of educating the Indians; but after a few years the mission was abandoned. The place derives its name from a large granite boulder which was painted red by the Indians, and called by them Wakon, or Spirit Rock .\n\nHASTINGS, a small, unimportant place, lies 10 miles further down.\n\nVERMILLION RIVER, three miles below the last-named town. This river enters the Mississippi. It takes its rise in Minnesota, and runs in a north-easterly direction in a line parallel with St. Peter's River.\n\nPOINT DOUGLAS, Min., five miles below, is a pleasant post village, situated on a point of land formed by the junction of the St. Croix with the Mississippi River. It has one hotel, a steam mill, several stores, and has an excellent landing for steamboats.\n\nST. CROIX RIVER rises in Wisconsin, near the west end of Lake Superior, and, flowing in a southerly direction, reaches the Mississippi at this point. Its extreme length is about 200 miles, and it is navigable for steamboats about 60 miles. It is 100 yards wide at its mouth. About one mile above its entrance into the Mississippi, an expansion of its shores forms St. Croix Lake, extending 36 miles in length, and 3 or 4 miles in width. There are several beautiful falls towards the centre of this river, which runs through a pine country, and annually brings down large quantities of lumber which are shipped to ports below.\n\nPRESCOTT, just below Point Douglass,\n\n15\n\nand on the opposite shore, is a small post village in Wisconsin. Eighteen miles below is\n\nRED WING, on the Minnesota side, and situated on the upper extremity of Lake Pepin.\n\nLAKE PEPIN is formed by an expansion of the Mississippi, and is 25 miles long and 4 miles wide. The water is here very clear and transparent, and the current quiet and gentle. On the eastern side of the lake is the celebrated\n\nMAIDEN'S ROCK, which rises perpendicularly 500 feet from the water. Tradition states that an Indian maiden, Mattakeo, or the strong-hearted, leaped from the summit of this acclivity in order to save herself from the hated embraces of a repulsive chief who had taken her prisoner after having slain many of her people. An accurate view of \"Maiden's Rock\" will be found on the page following, and likewise a sketch of a scene on the Mississippi, between Lake Pepin and St. Paul's. On our passage along the lake we pass the mouth of Rush River on the east and Cannon River on the west.\n\nKANZAS, a small village in Wisconsin; and continuing on, comes the mouth of\n\nCHIPPEWA RIVER, called by the Indians Ojibbeway. This river, which is over 200 miles long and 500 yards wide at its mouth, takes its rise in the northern part of Wisconsin, and, flowing in a south-westerly direction, enters the Mississippi at the foot of Lake Pepin, and 85 miles below St. Paul. Its shores are lined with magnificent forests of pine, and its waters are navigable for about 70 or 80 miles.\n\nLeaving this river, we pass the small towns of\n\nWABASHA, Minn., 10 miles below, and\n\nFOUNTAIN CITY, Wis., 15 miles further on, and come to\n\nTREMPALEAU RIVER, a small stream which rises in Wisconsin, and pours into the Mississippi, 10 miles below Fountain City. Opposite its mouth is\n\nMINNESOTA CITY, capital of Winona County, Minn. This is a very pretty village, which was settled in 1852 by the \"Western Farm and Village Association,\" and industry and economy have found their reward in the blooming fields which are observable from the banks of the river, deep into the interior. Passing the small town of Montoville, Wis., we come to\n\nMOUNTAIN ISLAND, which is a high, rocky island, whose estimated height is near 500 feet from the level of the river.\n\nIt is a very conspicuous and noted landmark, wild and rough and savage in its appearance, and is considered one of the most remarkable objects on the Upper Mississippi.\n\nBLACK RIVER, which rises in the central part of Wisconsin, flows into the Mississippi, 8 miles below Montoville. It is 200 yards wide at its mouth, and maintains that width for about 50 miles, to the falls, which are at the head of navigation for small boats.\n\nPassing on 4 miles, we come to Rising Sun, Minn.; and 2 miles to Brooklyn; and other 2 miles brings us to\n\nLA CROSSE, Wis. This is a beautiful town, situated on La Crosse Prairie, in La Crosse Co., on La Crosse River — which certainly entitles it to a crown, if bearing an unusual number of crosses, be deserving of such high reward. It does a large lumber-trade, and contains about 1,200 inhabitants. A railroad now extends from La Crosse to the city of Milwaukee, three miles below.\n\nHokah, or Root River, enters the Mississippi from Minnesota. It is about 130 miles long, and but little navigable. We next come to\n\nBROWNSVILLE, Minn., 5 miles below.\n\nRACOON RIVER, a small stream, flows into the Mississippi from Wisconsin, 5 miles below.\n\nBATTLE FIELD, Wis., 2 miles below.\n\nUPPER IOWA RIVER, Minn., a small stream, which, on entering the Mississippi, makes the dividing line between Iowa and Minnesota.\n\nLANSING, Iowa, 15 miles below.\n\nLYNXVILLE, Wis., 8 miles below.\n\nWEXFORD, Iowa, opposite Lynxville, and we come to\n\nPRAIRIE DU CHIEN, Wis. This is a place of some importance, and one of the oldest towns in Wisconsin. It is built on a level prairie, 6 or 8 miles long, and 2 miles wide, inclosed on the east side by a succession of rocky bluffs. It occupies the site of an old Indian village, and there are some excellent hunting grounds still to be found in\n\n18\n\nthe vicinity. Numerous mounds are scattered over the neighbouring country — the only remains of an ancient people, whose history is unknown to us, and whose very existence would have been doubted, had they not, like the builders of the Pyramids, left these unmistakable evidences of their having once lived, moved and had a being upon this soil. This town is the terminus of the Milwaukee and Mississippi Railroad, and is destined to become a place of large business. We give an engraving of an Indian mound, similar to those found near Prairie du Chien.\n\nPrairie du Chien is one of the connecting links in the chain of communication from Chicago and Milwaukee to St. Paul, via rail from these cities, and thence per steamer to St. Paul, or down the river, as we are now proceeding. Passing Port Crawford, 1 mile below Prairie du Chien, we come to\n\nWISCONSIN RIVER. This is a stream of some magnitude, being about 600 miles in length; 160 miles being navigable for steamers. At Portage City a canal connects the Wisconsin with Fox River, which enters Green Bay at Fort Howard, thus opening navigation from the Gulf of Mexico to the Northern lakes. At Portage City is still seen the remains of old Fort Winnebago, a place made famous in the annals of Indian warfare.\n\nCINCINNATI, Wis., 7 miles; Kilroy, Iowa, opposite; Clayton, Iowa, 2 miles, and\n\nMENDOTA, Wis., 7 miles below, brings us to\n\nGUTTENBURG, a thriving post village of Iowa, 40 miles above Dubuque. It has a good landing for steamboats, and has many valuable lead mines in its vicinity, many of which are worked to advantage.\n\nCASSVILLE, Wis., 6 miles below, has also several lead mines in its vicinity, from which large quantities are annually shipped.\n\nTURKEY RIVER, 150 miles long, but unnavigable for steamers, enters the Mississippi, from Iowa, at this point.\n\nFRANKFORD, Iowa, is a small village, at the mouth of Turkey River, and\n\nBUENA VISTA, Iowa, 5 miles below, is of about the same size.\n\nPOTOSI, Wis., 12 miles below, near the mouth of Grand River, is a flourishing town, of some note, containing near 4,000 inhabitants, and having some valuable lead mines in its vicinity.\n\nPERU, Iowa, 7 miles below: Sinopee, Wis., 2 miles, and Jamestown, Wis., 1 mile below, brings us to\n\nDUBUQUE, Iowa, 5 miles further on. This is the oldest settlement, and the largest city in the State. The history of its site dates from 1774, when Julien Dubuque, arrived in its vicinity, and settled among the Sac and Fox Indians, near Prairie du Chien. In 1778, he received from the Indians a grant of land, containing lead mines, discovered by Peosta, wife of one of the chiefs. In 1796, the Governor of Louisiana acknowledged the gift, and granted Dubuque a large tract, embracing the site of Dubuque, which was called after its founder, who worked the lead mines until his death, in 1809.\n\nThe Indians then took possession until their removal further west, in 1832. The heirs of Dubuque claimed, and for a while retained the grant, but were forcibly ejected by Government in 1833. Disorder ruled for a long period, until Congress by a special act, authorized the sale of the contested land, and that consummated, quiet was restored, and the place began to rapidly increase.\n\nIn 1832, the permanent settlement of the place was commenced by Henry McCrary, who built the first house on the Iowa side of the river, above Keokuk. It is remarkable that on the Illinois side, lead is found in the clay, by digging a few feet below the surface, while in Dubuque, the shafts have to be sunk one hundred feet to reach the ore; but as the lead is found in greater abundance, it pays for the extra labour.\n\n19\n\nDubuque is one of the most active business places in the west, and is remarkable for the intelligence of its people. Education is justly considered of paramount importance. In 1856, the school system was re-organized, and two extensive school-houses erected, at a cost of $25,000 each.\n\nWest of the city, the country is strikingly beautiful, and well watered. It is a rolling prairie, interspersed with groves of timber, while along the small streams, running from north to south, there is also plenty of timber, and good water-power. Population about 16,000.\n\nWe append to this notice of Dubuque, a sketch of the first house, built and occupied by the original settler. Houses of this description are common throughout the west.\n\nDubuque forms another of the favoured spots on the river which enjoys the great advantage of direct railroad communication with the cities on the shores of Lake Michigan, and from thence to the cities in the east, those on the seaboard, as well as with Canada, and being also one of the chief places for railroad travellers from the east, proceeding either up or down the river.\n\nDUNLEITH, Ill., lies opposite Dubuque, and is the terminus of the north-west branch of the Illinois Central Railroad.\n\nFEVRE, or Fever River, is a narrow, sluggish stream, emptying into the Mississippi from Illinois, 15 miles below Dubuque. It is only navigable for steamboats as far up as\n\nGALENA, which is situated on both sides of the river, about 6 miles above its mouth, 200 miles north-west of Springfield, and 180 from Chicago. It is the metropolis of the great lead region of northern Illinois, and the depot for the agricultural products of a fine country around. Its trade extends to nearly all the towns on the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. The houses are built upon streets, terraced one above the other, as they recede from the river, and present a novel and very pleasing appearance. The amount of lead shipped annually amounts to 50,000,000 pounds. A large amount of copper is smelted here. Zinc and copper abound in the vicinity. Thousands of tons of zinc lie neglected on the surface, as the scarcity of coal will not sufficiently pay for smelting. A bank is located here, and three papers are published. Population, in 1858, 12,000.\n\nMOSELLE, Ill., is a small post village, and lies 7 miles south of Fevre River.\n\nBELLEVUE, Iowa, is nearly opposite Moselle. It is situated at one end of a beautiful valley, on a bank elevated 30 feet above high water mark, and has one of the finest landings on the river, formed by a gravelly beach, with a sufficient depth of water to accommodate the largest steamers. A fine farming district lies back of the town, and the shipping of immense quantities of produce down the river affords employment to its industrious people. Eight miles below,\n\nMAKOQUETA RIVER enters the Mississippi. Its length is about 100 miles, and furnishes a large amount of water power.\n\nWe now pass a succession of small villages, varying in population from 100 to 2,000 persons, which we will simply name in the order in which they are reached, viz.: Portsmouth, Ill.; Savannah, Ill.; Sabula, Iowa; Lyons, Iowa; Fulton City, Ill.; Albany, Ill.; Camanche, Iowa; Cordova, Ill.; Princeton, Iowa; Parkhurst, Iowa; Port\n\n20\n\nByron, Ill.; Le Claire, Iowa, and Hampton, Ill., when we reach\n\nDAVENPORT, Iowa, which is one of the most busy and thriving places on the upper Mississippi. It is built at the foot of a bluff which rises gradually from the river, with a chain of rounded hills in the background. On another page, we give a view of the railroad bridge, which spans the Mississippi at this point.\n\nROCK ISLAND CITY, just below Davenport, and opposite it, is built upon an island on the Mississippi, of about 3 miles in extent. On the extreme southern point of the island, upon a rock 20 feet high, stands Fort Armstrong, an old block-house occupied as a place of defence in the Black Hawk war. There is a recess in this rock, called Black Hawk's Cave, in which it is said the stubborn chief often concealed himself. The waters of the Mississippi at this place are very rapid, and as the channel is covered with ledges of rock, the navigation at stages of low water is frequently obstructed. The country around is extremely rich and fertile, and the city being the southern terminus of the Chicago and Rock Island Railroad, is the outlet of immense quantities of produce, which is sent off by river and rail to all parts of the country. Rock Island City is also distinguished for the number of its manufactures, and seems destined to become one of the most considerable towns in Illinois, in this respect. Population, 12,000.\n\nMOLINE, a thriving post-village in Illinois, opposite the head of Rock Island, is a place enjoying great water privileges from the rapids of the Mississippi.\n\nROCK RIVER, something over 300 miles in length, flows into the Mississippi, near this point. It rises in Wisconsin, and thence flows into Illinois, and through a rich and extensive valley, which, in time, must prove one of the richest in the western country. It is navigable for about 200 miles, and has a descent of about 380 feet from its source to its mouth. Some of the finest towns in Wisconsin and Illinois are situated upon its banks. The current is obstructed somewhat by rapids, but time, and the inevitable laws of progress, will remove these obstacles in due season.\n\nLeaving ROCK RIVER, we pass Buffalo, Iowa, 5 miles below, and Andalusia, Ill., just opposite; Iowa, 8 miles below, and Fairport, Iowa, 7 miles beyond, and come to\n\nMUSCATINE, Iowa, formerly called Bloomington. This beautiful city is situated on a high bluff, on a bend of the Mississippi, and commands a most superb view of the river and surrounding country. Previous to 1836, when it was first settled by the whites, it was an Indian trading post, known by the name of Manatteka. In consequence of the bend in the river, Muscatine is situated nearer the centre of the State than the other ports on the Mississippi, and therefore commands nearly all the trade flowing from the valleys of the Red Cedar and Iowa Rivers. It is a very prosperous place, and gives promise of great future advancement. Population about 8,000.\n\nAbout 8 miles below Muscatine, on the 15th of August, 1837, a terrible steamboat explosion occurred, causing the loss of 25 lives, and the serious scalding and burning of several others of the passengers and crew. The steamer Dubuque, on her trip up the river, from St. Louis to Galena, was running at her usual speed, under a moderate pressure of steam, when the flue of the larboard boiler collapsed, throwing a torrent of scalding water and steam over the deck. The pilot immediately steered for the shore, and effected a landing. The after part of the boiler-deck, with all the freight, and every article which had been deposited there, was blown off the boat and far away into the water. Many of the deck passengers, and such of the crew as were in the vicinity of the explosion, were killed outright, while others were dreadfully scalded by hot water and escaped steam. These latter unfortunates, escaping to the shore, were driven to frenzy with excruciating pain, and, uttering the most appalling shrieks, actually tore their clothing from their persons — in some instances bringing away the skin, and even the flesh, with them. After lingering for hours in intense agony, some of the sufferers were relieved by death, while others, being cared for, and attended to by a number of kind physicians, who had been sent for from Muscatine, (then, called Bloomington,) were fortunate enough to recover. It is a noticeable fact that none of the cabin passengers were killed, or seriously wounded. It was\n\n21\n\nTHE above sketch represents one of the most important public erections in the north-west, connecting, as it now does, the States of Iowa and Illinois, and opening up continuous railroad communication between Chicago and many of the most important cities on the western side of the Mississippi, extending as far as the Missouri River.\n\nThe entire length of the bridge is 5832 feet, consisting of spans of 250 feet each. Cost, $260,000 (Å52,000 stg.). In the centre stands a draw-bridge, working on the rotary principle, so that it can be opened when necessary to allow the steamers to pass up and down the river. The average height of the bridge is 30 feet above low water.\n\nAt the west end of the embankment on Rock Island (which is in the centre of the river) another bridge extends from there across the Illinois channel, consisting of three spans of 150 feet each constructed on the same principle.\n\nDavenport is the capital of Scott County, Iowa, and one of the most flourishing towns in the State. It is situated 320 miles from St. Louis, and 60 miles east from Iowa City. \"During low water, the navigation is obstructed by the rapids, which extend 20 miles above Davenport. The scenery around the town is scarcely surpassed by any on the river. Two or three newspapers are published in the town. Stove coal is so abundant and cheap in the vicinity that steam power is used chiefly for manufacturing purposes.\"\n\nSince the completion of the above bridge, it has greatly increased the through traffic to and from Chicago and the West, as it is the depot where all the agricultural and mineral wealth of the State of Iowa is received, and from thence distributed, per railroad and river steamers, in all directions. Few places we could name present greater likelihood of rapid progress than Davenport.\n\n22\n\nsupposed that the cause of this terrible disaster was some defect in the material or workmanship of the boiler.\n\nPORT LOUISA, Iowa, is a small village, 16 miles below; and 10 miles further down lies the pleasant and thriving town of\n\nNEW BOSTON, Ill. This is a place of much activity in business, at which a large quantity of produce is bought, and shipped up and down the river. The adjacent country is fertile, and rapidly improving in condition.\n\nIOWA RIVER enters the Mississippi at this point. It is one of the most important streams in the State, being near 300 miles in length, although navigable for only small boats for about 100 miles above its mouth.\n\nKEITHSBURG, Ill., 7 miles; Huron, Iowa, 9 miles, and Oquawka, Ill., 10 miles below, brings us to\n\nBURLINGTON, Iowa, 15 miles below the last-named place. This is a fine commercial city, formerly the capital of the State, and, in point of population, is second only to Dubuque. It is the terminus of the Burlington and Peoria, and of the Burlington and Missouri Railroads, and is connected with the interior by a plank road, extending fifty miles. Notwithstanding the change of the seat of government from this place to Iowa City, Burlington has continued to improve in size and importance. Being built both upon a level plain, and upon high bluff which descends with a gradual slope to the water's edge, it has much the appearance of an amphitheatre. The summit of the bluff, which is 200 feet above the river, affords a view of the surrounding country, which is beautiful in the extreme.\n\nSKUNK RIVER enters the Mississippi from Iowa, 9 miles below Burlington. It rises near the centre of the State, and flows through a very fertile farming country, and furnishes considerable water power. Its entire length is 250 miles, but is but little navigable. Seven miles below is Pontoosue, Ill.; and 6 miles below that is Appanoose, in same State. Three miles further is\n\nFORT MADISON, Iowa, which occupies the site of an old fortification, built in 1808, as a defence against the Indians, who, in 1813, obliged the garrison to abandon and burn the fort. The situation of the town, as seen from the river, is very beautiful; the ground rising with a gradual slope from the river to the western portion of the town. The State Prison is located there. Two or three ferry boats ply constantly across the river, which is here about one mile wide. This town is somewhat noted for its manufactures, which have progressed wonderfully within the few past years, and are not excelled by any in the State. Population about 4,000.\n\nA Settler's First Home\n\nNAUVOO, Ill., is about 8 miles below. The history of this city makes it one of the most remarkable in the Union. It was founded by the Mormons, under their apostle, Joe Smith, in 1840. The situation of the town is one of the most beautiful to be found on the river. The ground rises gradually from the water's edge, to an unusual height, presenting a smooth and regular outline, with a broad plain at the surface. As originally laid out, it was 12 miles in circumference, the streets wide and straight, and crossing at right angles. The houses were small, plain, and of simple construction, with the exception of the \"Temple,\" which was of magnificent proportions, and erected at an immense cost — estimated at half a million of dollars. It was built of polished limestone, 130 feet long, 88 feet wide, and 160 feet high, and calculated to comfortably hold a congregation of 3,000 persons. In the basement was a large stone basin, called the Baptistry, or Brazen Sea, supported by 12 collossal oxen, and in this pool the faithful were baptized. The erection of this singular, but magnificent structure, was completed by the male members of the Mormon Church, who either performed a certain amount of labor with their own hands, or else contributed a stipulated portion of their property to engage the labor of others.\n\nSmith, the originator and leader of this delusion, was finally, in 1844, with several sub-leaders, arrested and thrown into prison, on charges, which, had they been brought to trial, would have been difficult to prove. Soon after, a lawless mob attacked the prison, and shot Smith, without giving him even the form of a trial. His people, tired and wearied with persecuting and being persecuted, soon after removed from Nauvoo, and made their long and difficult journey to Utah, where they soon after built the celebrated\n\n25\n\nSalt Lake City, where they still reside under the guidance of the notorious Brigham Young. In 1848, the great Temple was fired by an incendiary, and reduced to complete ruin. Nauvoo, which, in the days of the Mormons, contained 15 or 16,000 inhabitants, has now but about 2,000.\n\nA few years ago, a band of French socialists, under M. Cabet, established themselves — about 400 in number — at Nauvoo, and built upon the site of the temple, having purchased the ground upon which it stood.\n\nMONTROSE, Iowa, is nearly opposite Nauvoo, and is a fine town, at the head of the Lower Rapids, situated on an elevated prairie, from which a fine view of the country around is obtained. The inhabitants mostly find employment in \"lightening\" steamers over the rapids in seasons of low water. A large number of Indian mounds are found in the neighborhood.\n\nPassing by Nashville, Iowa, 4 miles; and Montebello, Ill., 6 miles below, we reach\n\nKEOKUK, Iowa, 205 miles above St. Louis, and 125 miles south of Iowa City. It is situated at the foot of the Lower Rapids, and is at the head of navigation for the larger class of steamboats, which, at certain stages of water, cannot get over the rapids. A line of fine steamers communicates daily between here and St. Louis. Over a thousand steamboats arrive and depart from this place annually. Keokuk is a very prosperous town, and must continue to improve, as it is, from its position, the natural outlet of the fertile valley of the Des Moines, which is the most populous part of the State.\n\nOpposite Keokuk is Hamilton City, Ill., and 4 miles below is\n\nWARSAW, Ill., situated on a high bluff, near the site of old Fort Edward. Its position is favorable for trade, and it already does an extensive business in importing and exporting, and is fast growing in population and wealth. Plank roads run from this place several miles, in various directions, towards the interior. Pop. about 5,000.\n\nDES MOINES RIVER enters the Mississippi, from Iowa, nearly opposite Warsaw. It commences in Minnesota, and runs a course of 400 miles, through an exceeding rich and fertile, tract of country, including long ranges of prairie. It is navigable for nearly 200 miles.\n\nWe now leave Iowa, and come to the edge of the State of Missouri; the first town we pass belonging to that State being Alexandria, situated at the mouth of Fox River. We next come to Des Moines City, Mo., 6 miles below, and then to\n\nTULLY, Mo., 12 miles further on; a flourishing town, of about 1200 inhabitants, doing a large business in shipping produce.\n\nLAGRANGE, Mo., 6 miles below, is a village of about the same size, and doing an equally flourishing business.\n\nQUINCY, Ill., 12 miles below, is finely situated, on a limestone bluff, 125 feet above the river, of which it commands art extensive view. The country in the vicinity is a rich, rolling prairie, and one of the most highly cultivated parts of the State. Quincy carries on an active trade by steamboats on the Mississippi. It has a railroad, reaching to Galesburgh, 100 miles distant, and there connects with the Chicago and Burlington road to Chicago, 160 miles. Lines of stages also run from this city to Hannibal, Palmyra, St Joseph's, etc. This city is one of the most thriving on the river, and is constantly increasing in trade, commerce and population. Its population, in 1840, was 2,000 — in 1859, over 15,000.\n\nPassing Fabian's River, which passes into the Mississippi in two branches, neither of which is navigable, we come to Marion City, Mo., and then to Aston and Boonville, on the Illinois side. These are all small places, and used as shipping ports for the interior.\n\nHANNIBAL, Mo., 7 miles below Booneville, is a fine town, doing a large business in the sale and shipment of pork, hemp, tobacco, etc., which are raised in the vicinity in great quantities. Coal and carboniferous limestone, an excellent building material, are found in great abundance in the adjoining country. Hannibal is the terminus of the Hannibal & St. Joseph's Railroad. Population of the town, about 5,000.\n\nPassing Dayton, which is a small settlement, opposite Hannibal; and Saverton, Mo., 8 miles below, we come to\n\nSALT RIVER, 18 miles further on. This is the famous stream, up whose saline waters so many defeated politicians have \"paddled their own canoes.\" This river is politically navigable only in seasons after general election, and we suppose that the defeated candidates\n\n26\n\nselect a retreat up these waters in order that they may keep until the next canvass.\n\nLeaving this forever embalmed stream, we pass a succession of small towns, dotting both sides of the river, the names of which we give in the natural order, viz.:\n\nCincinnati, Mo., Louisiana, Mo., 2 miles; Clarksville, Mo., 12 miles; Hamburgh, Ill., 15 miles; Gilead, Ill., 9 miles; Deer Plain, Mo., 27 miles; and 6 miles below, come to the mouth of\n\nILLINOIS RIVER, one of the finest rivers in the State from which it takes its name. The country bordering on its banks is rich and productive, and its commerce very large. It runs through many fine prairies, and, in other places, numerous high bluffs adorn its course. Steamboats ascend 250 miles, and from thence the Illinois and Michigan Canal, 100 miles in length, effects a communication with the lakes, at Chicago.\n\nGoing on, we pass Grafton, Ill., Portage des Sioux, Mo., 7 miles below, and Randolph, Ill., 4 miles; and 7 miles further on, we come to\n\nALTON, Ill., which is situated at the south terminus of the Chicago, Alton and St. Louis Railroad, 72 miles west by south of Springfield, and 250 from Chicago. In commercial advantages, it is second to no town in the State, having the best landing for steamboats on the east side of the river. A flat rock, level with the water, affords an excellent natural wharf. Bituminous coal is found in great abundance, and timber is plentiful in the vicinity. The city is beautifully laid out, five squares being reserved for public purposes, and a large reservation at the landing-place. Market street is 150 feet wide, and other streets from 60 to 140. It has a city hall, 8 churches, a bank, lyceum, mechanics' association, and an abundance of stores and warehouses. It has a railroad communication with Terre Haute, Indiana, and a regular steamboat connection with St. Louis. Population in 1850, 3,585; 1858, 7,000.\n\nUPPER ALTON, two miles east, is situated on an elevated plain, and contains Shurtleff College, a Baptist Institution, founded 1835.\n\nLeaving Alton, and passing down 5 miles, we come to\n\nMISSOURI RIVER. This magnificent stream rises in the Rocky Mountains, and, after running a tortuous course over 3,000 miles, mingles its waters with the Mississippi at the point we have now reached. At the distance of 450 miles above the navigable waters of its head branches, are the \"Gates of the Rocky Mountains,\" a series of rocks, which, for the distance of about 6 miles, rise perpendicularly from the margin of the river, to a height of 1,200 feet. The river is here compressed to the breadth of 150 yards, and, for the first 3 miles there is but one spot, and that but a few yards in extent, on which a man can stand between the water and the perpendicular ascent to the mountain. 110 miles below commences the great \"Falls,\" where the waters, in a distance of 16 miles, descends in rapids, and falls 357 feet. The highest fall has a perpendicular pitch of 98 feet; the next, 47; the third, 26; and the fourth, 19 feet. Next to Niagara, these falls are the largest on the continent. The banks of the Missouri are dotted with villages and towns from its mouth up as high as Council Bluffs, 600 miles from the Mississippi. Beyond this point, the wilderness prevails, consisting of vast and almost boundless plains of high grass, peopled only by savages, and immense herds of buffaloes, elk, deer, white bears, antelopes and mountain sheep. That the \"Upper Missouri\" — as this region is named — is rich in agricultural and mineral wealth, is unquestionable; and there is no doubt that the spirit of enterprise and progress which has led to such mighty improvements in the East, will, ere many years have passed away, make this far-reaching wilderness to blossom and flourish like the rose.\n\nThe rich valley of the Missouri, holds out such high promise for the future, that we cannot forbear transferring to our columns a detailed and graphic notice of its characteristics, which we extract from the \"New World for 1859,\" a book of great merit, just published in New York, and containing much valuable information in reference to all the principal places in the United States. We also give an engraving, from the same book, representing a steamer on her way up the Missouri. Between the Missouri and St. Louis — 18 miles below — lie the small towns of Chippewa, Madison, Venice and Bremen.\n\n27\n\nTHE VALLEY OF THE MISSOURI.\n\nIN our description of the western portion of the States, we have concluded for the present not to extend the limits of our information further west than that of the Missouri Valley — and although Nebraska and Kansas formed no part in the original plan, in the publication of the work, yet, from the great emigration movement in that direction, of late, we have thought it advisable to give the following details of that wonderful region, although not from our own experience, not having as yet had an opportunity of penetrating so far west. In some future edition of this work, we may be able to present such, from our own observation — meantime, we compile from what appears to us to be a reliable notice of this territory, which appeared in the North American Review, for July, 1858, in a review, in that journal, of two works lately published on that part of the Union.\n\nAfter describing that portion of the country west of Nebraska and Kansas, which is considered to be undesirable as a field for emigration, the writer asks: —\n\n\"What effect will the important fact have on these young territories themselves, as well as on the country at large? Nebraska and Kansas will, in that case, be the shores at which will terminate a vast ocean desert, nearly 1000 miles in breadth. To the west of that lie California and Oregon, great producing, and yet not capable of becoming great manufacturing countries.\n\n\"On the eastern coast of this great desert sea will lie Kansas and Nebraska, of all countries the best suited for the sites of vast manufactories. There run rivers whose descents, and whose capaciousness adapt them as well to turn the wheel as to irrigate the land. There, underneath a soil which can support a million of workmen, are spread layers of coal which will form the fuel for tens of thousands of square miles. There is the iron which is to form both the engine and the staple — the arm that strikes, as well as the material which is struck. Here, in fact, are the great furnishing warerooms, where the people of California will exchange their gold and quicksilver, and those of Oregon their fish and lumber, for the hardware, the cloths, and the furniture which the manufactories of the Missouri Valley will produce....Freight amounting to five dollars per 100 weight will be a sufficient protection to force the manufactories of the Missouri Valley at once into energetic action.\" If manufactured there, heavy goods will be able to be sold 20 per cent. less than those brought from the factories in Connecticut or Pennsylvania.\n\n\"When the time comes for the inland transportation of the goods of India and China from the Pacific to the Atlantic, it will be found that there is one route whose cheapness — at least, for heavy goods — will enable it to outbid all competitors.\"....\"The Columbia River, while it forms one vast and navigable stream from the ocean to the centre of the Oregon plains, flares out at the latter point into three forks, each of which offers a pass, and the only passes here accessible through the Rocky Mountains. It is the Columbia alone that holds the keys to the passes of the mountains, from which, on the easternmost side, run the tributaries of the Platte. The forks of the Columbia will, therefore, have one side of them the only navigable waters leading to the Pacific, and on the other the only highways through whose mountain gates the locomotive can course to the Missouri Valley.\" That the Platte and the Kansas are incapable of navigation, we think is abundantly proved; but it is equally clear that the valleys through which they run are the natural courses through which the canal must be opened and the railway laid. Thus there will pour into the great depots which these frontier States will present, not only the products of Eastern and Western America, but those of China and India.\n\nThe corn and wheat prairies of Nebraska, Iowa, and Kansas, stand on the banks of that great river (Missouri) which, with a volume, a force, and through an extent of territory no other stream can equal, shoots down the freight committed to it on the vast corn-consuming plains of the Southern Mississippi.....Never was there such an avenue for such a freight. For 500 miles these magnificent prairies slope upward from the river banks. For 1000 miles it dashes down, with a velocity which enables even the slower class of steamboats to make the descent in from 15 to 20 miles per hour. It is here that the Missouri has the great advantage over the Mississippi. The prairie country is scarcely reached by the latter river — so far as continuous navigation is concerned.....The navigation of the Missouri, on the other hand, continues nearly 1000 miles beyond where that of the Mississippi stops.....It is on account of the cheapness and rapidity which transportation in such a channel gives that we think the market of the gulf country will be supplied from the valley of the Missouri — not from that of the Mississippi.\n\nTHE EXTENT AND CHARACTER OF THE SOIL. — \"The bottom lands, of which the base of this seam (the Missouri) is composed, form a plain extending from 5 to 25 miles in breadth, and accompanying the river through nearly its whole course.\" The soil is of a very shifting nature, and the course of the river very circuitous. \"It doubles and curves, for instance, to such an extent around a line of 100 miles, between Leavenworth and Nebraska City, as to make that 100 miles into 200. What is\n\n28\n\npopularly called the ‘western bank,’ is, by turns, the southern and the eastern.\" For farming purposes, therefore, the lands of that nature are very uncertain and precarious.\n\nIn its course, however, it leaves, on the one side or the other, a rich bottom, which, for immediate productiveness, has probably no superior in the world. \"To this are added uniform belts of forest trees, interposing themselves between the bottom and the bluffs, which, along the States of Iowa and Missouri, and the opposite shores, develop themselves in great beauty. These trees, in connection with the stone with which the bluffs are often filled, give building materials to the settler in the richest abundance.\n\nIn Nebraska, the fertile bottom lands on the Missouri River begin near the mouth of the Vermilion River, on the 97th meridian, about 50 miles from Sioux City, and about 1000 miles on the river-course from the Mississippi. The trees on the river bottoms are immense and luxuriant. West of Sioux City, the bottom lands become narrow and irregular, and give only an uncertain prospect of support. The soil on the table prairie lands, which lie back from the bluffs, is not susceptible of much cultivation — degenerating into a cold and desolate moor. The exception to this is a patch, 60 miles above the Big Sioux, at the mouth of the Eau-qui-Court, which there runs into the Missouri. No point beyond the Vermilion can be relied on to raise corn.\n\nTHE PLATTE RIVER VALLEY. — The valley of the Platte is sodded with firm, and yet nutritious grass, which affords a road for wagons, and food for the oxen or mules by which the wagons are drawn. Along this great highway, the emigration from the Atlantic to the Pacific will pass.\n\nIn the bottom lands of the Platte, cottonwood of excellent quality is to be found; and above and around the forks, cedar in considerable quantity is to be seen.\n\nThe width of the Platte is, generally, one mile; and, when full, is six feet deep, but rarely is so: consequently, is considered of no use for navigation purposes.\n\nThe arable prairies that arise from the bluffs by which the Platte is hemmed, do not spread to any considerable extent after the first 150 miles of its course are passed.\n\nThe region south of the Platte presents a much wider sweep for agricultural enterprise. There, a climate not yet infected with the parching heat of the low country, is united with a soil of eminent fruitfulness; and, as the arable lands begin to widen, they disclose one of the loveliest regions in the world. The arable lands extend from 150 to 200 miles from the river banks.\n\nTHE COMPOSITION AND PRODUCTIVENESS OF THE SOIL. — The general character of the bottom lands — not only of the Missouri, but of the Kansas, the Yellowstone, and the Platte — is of sand and clay, richly impregnated and saturated with carbon, and with the vast quantities of decayed vegetable matter which the rivers are constantly precipitating.\n\n29\n\nNot unusually, Indian corn to the amount of 150 bushels to the acre are produced, with scarcely any more preparation than the ordinary turning over, which is easily done by the plough. From the river basin, rise terraces, or subsidiary bottom, at an average of 50 feet from the river level, and sloping and sweeping away till they reach, sometimes, the prairies themselves.\n\nFor permanency, depth, richness, and extent, the prairie soil can find nothing in the world, to say the least, to excel it — many parties declaring that there is nothing to equal it.\n\nUnlike the bottom lands, which are soft and pliable, the prairie lands of the Missouri are tough and tenacious. In Nebraska and Kansas, as many as six or eight yoke of oxen are employed at a single plough in breaking the ground for the first time. When once upturned, however, the sod rots in a single summer, after which it may be ploughed by a single yoke. Indian corn and potatoes grow upon it after the first ploughing; wheat not until after the second.\n\nThe present appearances of the prairies of the Missouri show clear evidence of having, some centuries ago, been under cultivation, the fields, etc., being clearly traced. They are found in the best-watered and richest sections, and extend from one to three hundred acres in area.\n\nLUMBER. — In respect to forests, south-eastern Nebraska and Eastern Kansas have a great advantage over Illinois and Iowa. In the latter States we may travel for miles without seeing a single tree within sight. In the central valley of the Missouri, the cottonwood, willow, and poplar spread themselves in great abundance and beauty along the bottom lands, and on the bluffs are found the oak, elm, cedar, and the black walnut, thus providing abundant material on the spot for building and fencing.\n\nCLIMATE. — Between the Missouri Valley and the same range of latitude towards the east, the advantages, so far as evenness of temperature is concerned, are with the latter. Both in Kansas and Nebraska the thermometer ranges from 15 degrees higher in summer, and 15 degrees lower in winter, than in Virginia or Pennsylvania. It is not uncommon for the mercury to sink to 30 degrees below zero in the one season, and to keep steady in the other, even as far north as Omaha City, at 110. It is an error to seek the causes of these extremes in the as yet unsettled condition of the country. They result from the fact, that as we recede further from the sea-coast, both heat and cold become, in their degree, greater, as can be explained on philosophic grounds.\n\nTwo features, however, tend greatly to soften these extremes. The winter is relieved by the crisp dryness of the air, as compared with the piercing sharpness of the Atlantic seaboard, or the raw, damp, cold atmosphere of Great Britain.\n\nTHE BREEZES ON THE PRAIRIES. — The summer — to those who can take refuge in the shade — has nearly all its terrors removed by the cool and powerful breezes by which the prairies are incessantly swept.\n\nIt is in these breezes, in fact, that consists one of the main charms of prairie life. In their uniformity, their bracing purity, their vigour, they rival those of the sea. They are greatly preferable, in these respects, to those that traverse the eastern Alleghany slopes. There, the wind is fractured into puffs, or slit into threads by the forests, gorges, mountain crags, and ravines, through which it passes. But the breezes of the prairies pass onward in one grand and unbroken sheet. They blow with the evenness and continuity of the eastern trade winds, which may always be relied on, and in summer, at least, is as far from sinking at one time into a calm, as from rising into a hurricane. In winter the wind then covers the prairies with a cold and heavy weight, whose very uniformity aggravates its severity. But in the summer, the delicious coolness and the unfailing regularity of the prairie winds are blessings to which all travellers will bear a grateful testimony.\n\nIn connection with this subject, we quote from a writer in Colburn's New Monthly Magazine for July, 1858, who, on an excursion to the \"Great West,\" and close to the Missouri, says: —\n\n\"The west of America must be a healthy country, except where the land is low or near sluggish mud-banked rivers, for there intermittent fevers prevail as well as elsewhere. There seemed in the midst of the excessive heat, a power of exertion, a springiness, not at all like the faint, relaxing sensation of a very hot English summer's day. I speak of the dry prairies of the west. The air was always clear, dry, exhilarating beyond idea.\"\n\n30\n\nPILOT KNOB IRON MOUNTAIN, MISSOURI.\n\nABOUT eighty-six miles south-west from the city of St. Louis, and at the termination of the St. Louis and Iron Mountain Railroad, is situated one of the most imposing mineralogical objects of interest which we can possibly present; affording, as it does, a gigantic specimen of the mineral wealth of the State of Missouri. We refer to the iron mountain, known by the name of Pilot Knob — an accurate representation of which we give on another page.\n\nIn St. Francois County, Missouri, on the same line of railroad, are situated two mountains of iron ore — the smallest one, a few miles from the other, is known as \"The Iron Mountain,\" but which title belongs more properly to its much larger mountain neighbour, \"Pilot Knob.\"\n\nPilot Knob Mountain is 580 feet high, and as the pedestrian makes its ascent he will find little else than the brushwood with which it is covered, and masses of iron stone lying about or cropping out of the ground, until he reaches the summit, which is one bare solid mass of iron ore, forming, as it were, a crowning diamond set in the apex of this great mountain of wealth. The ascent of the mountain is easy.\n\nTo give an exact idea of the quantity of iron ore in Pilot Knob is simply impossible; suffice it to say that it is considered as sufficient to supply the wants of the whole world for generations to come. The quality of the ore is pronounced superior to that of Norway and Sweden, and contains from 60, and in some cases 90 per cent. of pure metal. The ore does not require much digging for, further than quarrying and blasting it out of the face of the mountain, which is done near its top. There, the miners will be seen filling a railroad car with the iron stone. When one car is filled it is placed at the top of the incline, with an iron rope attached, and which is wound round a large wooden drum; and thus fixed, is placed on the incline, when it proceeds down the plane with its heavy cargo at a rapid rate, till it reaches the bottom and runs on to a stage, where the contents are emptied on a heap of iron stone and charcoal mixed together, ready to undergo \"roasting\" — being the first process of preparing the ore for the blast furnace.\n\nWhilst the loaded car is being attached at the top and sent down the incline by its own weight, an empty car is attached to another iron rope at the foot of the mountain, which winds round the same drum at the top, which is drawn up the incline at the same time by the weight and impetus of the downward car, thereby saving all expense for any other power for drawing the cars up and down the mountain side.\n\nThe railroad consists of three \"metals,\" excepting at the point where the cars in their progress up and down pass each other in their rapid journey. There four rails are laid to allow each car to pass clear of the other.\n\nFrom the top of the mountain a good, although by no means very extensive, view of the surrounding country is to be had, as it is one series of hills and valleys as far as the eye can see. At the foot of the mountain reposes the future \"Pilot Knob City\" with its furnaces at work. In a valley towards the south is to be seen the thriving village of Ironton, of twelve or eighteen months' standing, whilst a mile further on is the prettily situated village of Arcadia; both of which villages are allowed to be \"pretty smart places.\" To the west rises the highest mountain of the district, known as Sheppard Mountain, also of mineral richness, with its ore possessing the peculiar property of being both negative and positive in its magnetic character.\n\nThe iron, when manufactured into \"pig,\" is sent to St. Louis. The mountain is owned by a company, of whom Col. L. V. Bogy is a member, who is also President of the Iron Mountain Railroad, and who has our thanks for his polite attention to us when on our visit there. The curious in such matters, resident in Great Britain, may inspect specimens of iron ore, picked from the top of Pilot Knob, by calling on Mr. Bailliere, publisher of this work, 219 Regent street, London.\n\nThe tourist, when at St. Louis, intending to proceed to this wonderful natural specimen of mineral wealth, takes the Iron Mountain Railroad from St. Louis, (fare $3,) which proceeds for several miles along the western shore of the Mississippi, when some excellent views of the mighty \"Father of Waters\" are to be had. The country, for the most part along this line of road, consists of a rough, rocky surface, with patches of good land in the river bottoms, and on some of the higher portions of the country.\n\nWithin a few miles of the Iron Mountain the country becomes very hilly, with the hills wooded to their summits.\n\nAbout half way an excellent dining-saloon is situated, at Victoria Station, which is situated in the centre of a wood, on a rising ground, but which ere long is expected to be dotted over with the summer villas of the St. Louis manufacturers and merchants.\n\nAbout six miles from Pilot Knob is Iron Mountain Station, from which will be seen the Iron Mountain with its furnace at work. Shortly after leaving which the traveller will be landed almost at the base of Pilot Knob Mountain, surrounded by numerous frame houses, stores, and a hotel, forming the nucleus of the future Pilot Knob City.\n\n32\n\nCITY OF ST. LOUIS.\n\nON the arrival of the traveller at this city — from either the North or South by steamer on the Mississippi, or as he alights at the railroad depot on the Illinois side of the river from the east — his attention will at once be arrested, and his surprise excited, by the immense array of steamers which lie so closely packed together at the levee (or Front street) of the city, and extending there for some miles; forming, beyond question, the most magnificent and extensive mercantile steam marine which is to be seen at one time at any port in this or any other country — at once impressing the mind with the magnitude of that commerce which supports and employs them, at a far inland river port in the Western States of America.\n\nThe first impression of the stranger on visiting St. Louis, therefore, is, that it must be a city of great commercial importance; and on passing along its busy, crowded and, in many places, filthy and badly-paved streets, that impression is strengthened and confirmed.\n\nThe geographical and other natural advantages which St. Louis possesses, renders it a focus for commerce unsurpassed by any other city in the country.\n\nAs may be well known, the city is situated on the great highway of the Mississippi, between two oceans; it is the centre of the finest agricultural sections of the country, and the receiving and distributing point for the manufactures and produce which are carried on the waters of the Mississippi, the Ohio, the Missouri, Tennessee, Wabash and other rivers. Besides these, the immense railroad arteries which now traverse the States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa and Missouri, centre in St. Louis, and have contributed largely to the progress and prosperity of the city; and the last, but greatest achievement accomplished, in that respect, is the opening of the great overland mail route from St. Louis to San Francisco — a distance of upwards of 3,000 miles, occupying 25 days — the Rocky Mountains and dreary wastes no longer forming insurmountable obstacles to American enterprise.\n\nFrom what we have already stated, it will be inferred that the commerce of St. Louis is immense — the chief articles being groceries, tobacco, whisky, dry goods and hardware. The stores of the dealers in those articles are very numerous and large; and in Main, Second and Third streets, where such are situated, a degree of bustle and business activity may be seen not exceeded in the streets of any Eastern city. As connected with the commerce of the city, we may mention, that in the single article of sugar, St. Louis imported more than that imported by all the cities on the eastern seaboard, put together, of such native-grown sugars as passed through the Custom House at New Orleans.\n\nThe manufacturing establishments of St. Louis consist of numerous flouring mills, foundries and machine-shops, sugar refineries and sundry others; but, when taken in the aggregate, the manufactures of St. Louis are not so numerous as the size and commercial importance of the city would indicate, and, strange to say, in one iron manufacturing establishment which we visited — owned by one of the most enterprising firms — we found that the very iron used there in the manufacture of their goods had been brought 340 miles — from the \"Queen City of the West,\" Cincinnati — although, not 100 miles from St. Louis, there is iron ore more than sufficient to supply the whole world for generations to come. In that establishment, we saw iron bolts and nuts being made by machinery, and which, by the way, are now shipped from there to engineering establishments in Great Britain, as well as other parts of Europe.\n\nAn active competition is now in operation, between Cincinnati and St. Louis, for the commerce of the Western and Southern States; and merchants from the West, South and Northwest, have now the choice of the markets of both these cities, as well as any inducements which may be held out to them by houses in the Eastern cities on the seaboard, the merchants there being naturally anxious to be brought in direct contact with all trustworthy\n\n33\n\nmen, however far off such may reside. This applies, of course, more particularly to the great staple articles connected with dry goods, hardware, and other descriptions of goods which are not manufactured, or which cannot be supplied so advantageously in the West. It behoves, therefore, the merchants — but more particularly the manufacturers of St. Louis — to look to their laurels, and not rest too self-satisfied upon what they have done, if they would raise the character of their city, by rendering its manufacturing, somewhat commensurate with the magnitude of its commercial operations.\n\nDuring the late commercial panic, St. Louis suffered probably less than any other city which can be named; and, although several suspensions of parties took place during the crisis, the most of these have paid up, in full, and resumed business as before. The caution of the merchants on the outburst of the storm, the large amount of healthy business done from St. Louis to the Southern States, which were little affected by the panic, contributed largely towards the lucky circumstance just mentioned; so that, looking into the future, St. Louis appears to us to have a glorious prospect before it. A large influx of emigration is now, and has been, for some time past, flowing into Missouri from the South and East, and even from Illinois and other more northerly States. When the true character of the climate, and correct information regarding the character of the State for agricultural purposes becomes known — looking at what has been done in the manufacture of Missouri wines, and the undeniable fact of immense tracts of the State being well adapted for the cultivation of the grape — and as the inexhaustible mineral resources are developed — the future of the city of St. Louis, as the parent city of the State, must participate largely in such increasing advantages, and render its progress and future prosperity — although it has been great — greater than ever it was before.\n\nThe levee, where all the steamers are moored, presents a most animated appearance from early in the morning until dusk. On the broad incline towards the river, which extends for miles, it may be seen covered with thousands of packages of merchandise of every description — sugar, molasses and flour forming the chief items. Along the side of the levee run the stores of the commission, forwarding, import and export merchants, whilst opposite to them lies the white-painted river steamboats, presenting a perfect forest of chimneys — each steamer having two — along the line. Many of these steamboats, for comfort and speed, are not excelled by any river boats in America, although, in general, they are much smaller than the large passenger boats which ply on the lakes, or East and North Rivers at New York. There is also a great difference in the punctuality of the former's sailing at the advertised hour; and in that respect the Mississippi boats, we should suppose, would do well to study more the convenience of those who proceed by them than they do — the advertised hour of 12 noon generally meaning 4 P. M., or even 12 noon of the next day.\n\nFourth street is the principal street for retail business, at the north end of which are situated some very handsome newly-erected stores.\n\nThe public institutions and buildings of St. Louis consist chiefly of the Court House, corner of Chestnut and Fourth streets, now approaching completion, the College of the Medical Department of the University, the Mercantile Library and Reading-room, and the Central High School. Notices, together with illustrations of these buildings, will be found elsewhere in this work. Besides these, may be named the new Custom House, the University of St. Louis, O'Fallon Institute, Wyman's Hall and Museum, in addition to which the city abounds with charitable and benevolent institutions, and several handsome churches.\n\nThe principal hotels will be found enumerated in our list of hotels given elsewhere. Amongst the various educational institutions in St. Louis, stands pre-eminent the St. Louis University; and, to give an idea of its extent, we give the annexed illustration of one of its departments, known by the title given, and which forms one of the medical colleges of the city, established chiefly through the instrumentality of Dr. C. A. Pope, of St. Louis, backed by the munificence of J. O. Fallon, Esq., who caused the above edifice to be built, at an expense to him of $80,000, and was presented by him to the Faculty of Medicine,\n\n34\n\nunder trusteeship forever. It is a handsome brick building, 130 feet long, 100 feet deep and 75 feet high. The museum arrangements and instruments originally cost $30,000, since which large additions have been made; and it may be said, that it now possesses in its museums one of the best collections extant of rare and valuable specimens connected with the sciences of medicine, natural history, mineralogy, geology, botany, etc., which must prove of incalculable value to the students, for whose more immediate benefit and instruction it has been established.\n\nOne of the most pleasing features connected with a large city is, the existence of a library and reading-room, which the young men of the city can frequent, after business\n\n35\n\nhours; and there get \"posted up\" in the news of the day, enjoy an hour or two's company with some favorite author, and that in a magnificent room, surrounded by specimens of the genius of the sculptor and painter, with the advantage of having recourse to a most excellent library for reading at home. In this respect, the City of St. Louis is not behind any of her sister cities in the United States. The view prefixed represents the building appropriated for such a purpose, (and known as the Mercantile Library,) as well as providing in the same building large halls for lectures, concerts, etc. The reading-room, which is free to strangers, is fitted up with comfortable reading-desks, and is plentifully supplied with newspapers and magazines, both American and European. The building is plain but substantial, 105 feet front, 127 feet deep, 90 feet high, and erected at a cost of $140,000 (Å28,000 sterling). Belongs to a joint stock company.\n\nThe O'Fallon Institute (named after J. O'Fallon, Esq., one of the largest real estate owners in St. Louis) is an institution of a kindred character to that of the Mercantile Library, already noticed, with this difference, that the Mercantile Library is open only to young men engaged in mercantile pursuits, whilst the O'Fallon Institute forms the Mechanics' Institution of the city — with its reading-room, library and museum thrown open to all, of whatever trade or profession — where the young workman can, for a mere trifle a year, enjoy all the advantages of such an institution, including the attendance at lectures, by the best men, on scientific and generally interesting and important subjects.\n\nThe institution was started exclusively, and is supported, partly, by voluntary subscriptions, including very handsome money donations from some of the citizens, and a grant of land from the liberal gentleman whose name the institution bears. The O'Fallon Institute is a noble institution, devoted to a noble purpose. Strangers are made most welcome, by its obliging and communicative superintendent.\n\nThe Court House is the largest public building in St. Louis; and, being situated in a large open square on Chestnut and Fourth streets, its large and fine proportions are seen to great advantage. Several years have been occupied in altering and completing it, at a cost of several thousands of dollars. From its dome, a magnificent view of the city, river and surrounding country is to be had.\n\n36\n\nTHE accompanying sketch represents one of the most complete school-houses in the United States. It has been built combining all the improvements connected with the best school-houses in Boston, New York and Cincinnati, and at present stands as a model school-house for the country at large. It is 3 stories high, 106 feet long, 84 feet wide, and 86 feet high to the apex for the roof, with octagonal towers, flanking each corner, 102 feet high. The first and second stories are each divided into 4 rooms, capable of accommodating 70 scholars in each, with the third story suited for 600 making, in all, accommodation for 880 scholars. The interior is fitted up with admirable judgment, both as regards seeing, hearing, light and ventilation; with wardrobes, desks for masters and pupils, reception-rooms, retiring-rooms, committee-rooms, and all the appliances of a school-house, apparently impossible to improve upon. The pupils who attend this school are those who have distinguished themselves at the primary and intermediate schools, and whose parents are desirous of their acquiring knowledge in the higher branches of education. The establishment of this school reflects great credit upon the citizens of St. Louis, and upon Mr. Rumbold, its architect. Cost upwards of $45,000 (Å9,000 sterling).\n\n37\n\nDOWN THE MISSISSIPPI.\n\nTHE following poem, descriptive of a voyage down the Mississippi in the wintry month of February, 1858, is from the pen of the accomplished Scottish author and poet, Dr. Chas Mackay, written at New Orleans, after his arrival there from St. Louis; and which poem formed the greater portion of one of his interesting letters, entitled \"Transatlantic Sketches,\" which appeared in the \"Illustrated London News:\"\n\n'TWAS a wintry morning, as the clock struck ten,\n\nThat we left St. Louis, two dejected men; —\n\nGazing on the river, thick with yellow mud,\n\nAnd dreaming of disaster, fire, and fog, and flood; —\n\nOf boilers ever bursting, of snags that break the wheel,\n\nAnd sawyers ripping steamboats, through all their length of keel; —\n\nYet, on shipboard stepping, we dismissed our fears,\n\nAnd beheld through sunlight, in the upper spheres,\n\nLittle cherubs, waving high their golden wings,\n\nGuarding us from evil and its hidden springs;\n\nSo on Heaven reliant, thinking of our weans,\n\nThinking of our true-loves, we sailed for New Orleans; —\n\nSouthward, ever southward, in our gallant ship,\n\nFloating, steaming, panting, down the Mississip.\n\nOh the hapless river! in its early run\n\nClear as molten crystal, sparkling in the sun;\n\nEre the fierce Missouri rolls its troublous tide\n\nTo pollute the beauty of his injured bride;\n\nLike a bad companion poisoning a life,\n\nWith a vile example and incessant strife,\n\nSo the Mississippi, lucent to the brim,\n\nWedded to Missouri, takes her hue from him;\n\nAnd is pure no longer, but with sullen haste\n\nJourneys to the ocean a gladness gone to waste; —\n\nThus our idle fancies shaped themselves that day,\n\nMid the bluffs and headlands, and the islets grey,\n\nSouthward, ever southward, in our creaking ship,\n\nSteaming through the ice-drifts, down the Mississip.\n\nIn our wake there followed, white as flakes of snow,\n\nSeven adventurous seagulls, floating to and fro,\n\nDiving for the bounty of the bread we threw,\n\nDipping, curving, swerving — fishing as they flew; —\n\nAnd in deep mid-current, throned upon a snag,\n\nFar away — a rover — from his native crag,\n\nSat a stately eagle, Jove's imperial bird,\n\nHeedless of our presence, though he saw and heard;\n\nLooking so contemptuous, that human nature sighed\n\nFor a loaded rifle to slay him for his pride; —\n\nBut superb, defiant; slowly, at his ease,\n\nSpreading his wide pinions he vanished on the breeze\n\nSouthward, flying southward, far beyond our ship,\n\nFloating, creaking, panting, down the Mississip.\n\nIn a blaze of glory shone the sun that day;\n\nIn a blaze of beauty, fresh as flowery May,\n\nA maid from Alabama came tripping on our deck —\n\nBright as heaven above us; — pure without a speck,\n\nSinging songs till twilight freely as the lark\n\nThat for inner gladness sings, though none may hark,\n\nSongs of young affection, mournful songs of home,\n\nSongs of happy sadness, when the fancies roam\n\nFrom th' oppressive Real to the fairy Far\n\nShining through the Future, silvery as a star; —\n\nAnd the Sun departed in his crimson robe,\n\nLeaving Sleep, his viceroy, to refresh the globe;\n\nThus we travelled southward in our gallant ship,\n\nFloating, drifting, dreaming, down the Mississip.\n\nBrightly rose the morning o'er the straggling town\n\nWhere the broad Ohio pours its waters down\n\nTo the Mississippi, rolling as before,\n\nSeeming none the wider for increase of store;\n\nAnd they said, \"These houses scattered on the strand\n\nTake their name from Cairo, in the Eastern land,\n\nAnd shall be a city at some future day,\n\nMightier than Cairo, dead and passed away.\"\n\nAnd we thought it might be, as we gazed awhile; —\n\nAnd we thought it might not, ere we passed a mile —\n\nAnd our paddles paddled through the turbid stream\n\nAs we floated downwards in a golden dream;\n\nSouthward, ever southward, in our panting ship,\n\nIdling, dawdling, loafing down the Mississip.\n\nSometimes in Missouri we delayed an hour,\n\nTaking in a cargo — butter, corn and flour;\n\nSometimes in Kentucky shipped a pile of logs,\n\nSometimes sheep or turkeys, once a drove of hogs.\n\nRuthlessly the niggers drove them down the bank,\n\nStubbornly the porkers eyed the narrow plank,\n\nTill at length, rebellious, snuffing danger near,\n\nThey turned their long snouts landward and grunted out their fear,\n\nAnd the white-teethed niggers, grinning with delight,\n\nRode them, and bestrode them, and charged them in the fight;\n\nAnd then came shrill lamenting, and agony, and wail,\n\nAnd pummelling, and hoisting, and tugging at the tail\n\nUntil the swine were conquered; and southward passed our ship,\n\nPanting, steaming, snorting, down the Mississip.\n\nThus flew by the slow hours, till the afternoon,\n\nMid a wintry landscape, and a sky like June;\n\nAnd the mighty river, brown with clay and sand,\n\nSwept, in curves majestic, through the forest land,\n\nAnd stuck into its bosom, heaving fair and large,\n\nMany a lowly cypress that grew upon the marge; —\n\nStumps, and trunks, and branches, as maids might stick a pin,\n\nTo vex the daring fingers that seek to venture in —\n\n38\n\nOh travellers! bold travellers! that roam in wild unrest,\n\nBeware the pins and brooches that guard this river's breast;\n\nFor danger ever follows the captain and the ship\n\nWho scorn the snags and sawyers that gem the Mississip.\n\nHere our songster fled us, the little gipsy queen,\n\nLeaving us a memory of gladness that had been,\n\nAnd through the dark night passing, dark without a ray,\n\nSave the light we carried, we held upon our way;\n\nDarkness on the waters, — darkness on the sky, —\n\nRain-floods beating o'er us, — wild winds howling high, —\n\nBut, safely led and guided, by pilots who could tell\n\nThe pulses of the river, its windings and its swell;\n\nWho knew its closest secrets by dark as well as light,\n\nEach bluff and fringing forest, each swamp or looming height —\n\nIts gambols and caprices, its current's steady law,\n\nAnd at the fourth day dawning we skirted Arkansaw:\n\nSouthward, steering southward, in our trusty ship,\n\nFloating, steaming, panting, down, the Mississip.\n\nWeary were the forests, dark on either side;\n\nWeary were the marshes, stretching far and wide;\n\nWeary were the wood-piles, strewn upon the bank;\n\nWeary were the cane-groves, growing wild and dank;\n\nWeary were the tree-stumps, charred and black with fire;\n\nWeary was the wilderness, without a house or spire;\n\nWeary were the log-huts, built upon the sand;\n\nWeary were the waters, weary was the land;\n\nWeary was the cabin with its gilded wall;\n\nWeary was the deck we trod — weary — weary all —\n\nNothing seemed so pleasant to hope for or to keep,\n\nNothing in the wide world so beautiful as sleep,\n\nAs we journeyed southward in our lazy ship,\n\nDawdling, idling, loafing, down the Mississip.\n\nEver in the evening as we hurried by\n\nShone the blaze of forests, red against the sky —\n\nForests burned for clearings, to spare the woodman's stroke —\n\nCottonwood, and cypress, and ash, and giant oak —\n\nAnd from sleep upspringing — when the morning came,\n\nSeemed the lengthening landscape evermore the same,\n\nEvermore the forest and the rolling flood,\n\nAnd the sparse plantations and the fertile mud; —\n\nThus we came to Princeton, threading countless isles;\n\nThus we came Vicksburg, thrice three hundred miles;\n\nThus we came to Natchez, when the starlight shone,\n\nGlad to see it — glad to leave it — glad to hurry on —\n\nSouthward, ever southward, in our laden ship,\n\nFuming, toiling, heaving, down the Mississip.\n\nWhence the sound of music? Whence the merry laugh?\n\nSurely boon companions, who jest, and sing, and quaff?\n\nNo! the slaves rejoicing; — happier than the free,\n\nWith guitar and banjo, and burst of revelry!\n\nHark the volleyed laughter! hark the joyous shout!\n\nHark the nigger chorus ringing sharply out!\n\nMerry is the bondsman; gloomy is his lord;\n\nFor merciful is Justice and kind is Fate's award.\n\nAnd God, who ever tempers the winter to the shorn,\n\nDulls the edge of Sorrow to these His lambs forlorn —\n\nAnd gives them cheerful natures and thoughts that never soar\n\nInto that dark To-morrow which wiser men deplore.\n\nSo sing, ye careless negroes, in our joyous ship,\n\nFloating, steaming, dancing, down the Mississip.\n\nAt the sixth day's dawning all around us lay\n\nFog, and mist, and vapour, motionless and grey;\n\nDimly stood the cane-swamps, dimly rolled the stream,\n\nBayou-Sara's housetops faded like a dream;\n\nNothing seemed substantial in the dreary fog —\n\nNothing but our vessel drifting like a log —\n\nNot a breath of motion round our pathway blew —\n\nIdle was our pilot, idle were our crew —\n\nIdle were our paddles, idle, free and slave —\n\nEvery thing was idle but the restless wave —\n\nBearing down the tribute of three thousand miles\n\nTo the Southern Ocean and its Indian isles; —\n\nThus all morn we lingered in our lazy ship,\n\nDozing, dreaming, nodding, down the Mississip.\n\nBut ere noon, uprising, blew the southern breeze;\n\nRolling off the vapour from the cypress-trees,\n\nOpening up the blue sky to the south and west,\n\nDriving off the white clouds from the river's breast;\n\nBreathing in our faces, balmy, from the land,\n\nA roamer from the gardens, as all might understand;\n\nHappy as the swallows or cuckoos on the wing,\n\nWe'd cheated Father Winter, and sailed into the Spring,\n\nAnd beheld it round us, with its sounds and sights,\n\nIts odors and its balsams, its glories and delights,\n\nThe green grass, green as England; the apple-trees in bloom;\n\nThe waves alert with music, and freighted with perfume —\n\nAs we journeyed southward in our gallant ship,\n\nSinging and rejoicing down the Mississip.\n\nOn the seventh day morning we entered New Orleans,\n\nThe joyous \"Crescent City\" — a Queen among the Queens; —\n\nAnd saw her pleasant harbour alive with tapering spars, —\n\nWith \"union-jacks\" from England, and flaunting \"stripes and stars\"; —\n\nAnd all her swarming Levee, for miles upon the shore, —\n\nBuzzing, humming, surging, with Trade's incessant roar,\n\nWith negroes hoisting hogsheads, and casks of pork and oil,\n\nOr rolling bales of cotton, and singing at their toil;\n\nAnd downwards — widening downwards — the broad majestic river,\n\nHasting not, nor lingering, but rolling on forever,\n\nAnd here, from travel resting, in soft ambrosial hours,\n\nWe plucked the growing orange and gathered summer flowers,\n\nAnd thanked our trusty Captain — our pilot — and our ship —\n\nFor bearing us in safety down the Mississip.\n\n41\n\nSAINT LOUIS. — An extended notice of this city, together with illustrations of some of its public buildings, will be found at p. 32.\n\nILLINOISTOWN, Ill., is opposite St. Louis, and is the terminus of the Ohio & Mississippi Railroad.\n\nCAHOKIA, Ill., 4 miles below, is probably the oldest town in the State, having been settled, by the French, at the latter part of the 17th century. It was occupied by the Caoquias Indians long before the discovery of the Mississippi. Most of the houses are built of pickets, one story high, having piazzas on each side, and whitewashed. By an act of Congress, passed in 1788, a grant of 400 acres of land, adjoining the village, was given to each family — mostly being French. It is a town that reminds one of the olden time, and seems hardly to have moved during the last hundred years. In 1766 it contained 40 families, and now has about 50.\n\nCARONDOLET, Mo., formerly called Vide Poche, (empty pocket,) is a small town 1 mile below, and is occupied by French families, engaged in supplying vegetables for the St. Louis market. It was settled in 1767, but remained almost stationary for a number of years. During the last five years, however, it has shown a rapid increase.\n\nJEFFERSON BARRACKS, Mo., 5 miles below, is one of the most extensive United States military establishments in the West, and has a large cavalry school attached, from which the mounted troops upon the frontiers are supplied.\n\nCLIFTON, Mo., 10 miles below, and Harrisonville, Ill., 2 miles below, are small towns. Two miles further down is\n\nHERCULANEUM, Mo., and is a great mart for the lead which is found in its vicinity. There are also several shot towers here in successful operation. In 1844 this place was almost entirely destroyed by a flood. Population, 1,000.\n\nPLATTEN ROCK, Mo., 1 mile, Selma, Mo., 2 miles, and Rust Tower, Mo., are small villages.\n\nFORT CHARTRES, Ill., 9 miles below, was an old French fort, built in 1720, as a defence against the Spaniards. It was taken possession of by the British, in 1765, by virtue of the treaty of Fontainbleau. It is now a heap of ruins.\n\nST. GENEVIEVE, Mo., 11 miles below, is another old French settlement, dating back as far as 1750. It is situated in the richest mineral district in the United States, and exports large quantities of lead, iron, copper and limestone. Forty-two miles back of St. Genevieve is situated the celebrated \"Iron Mountain,\" the greatest natural curiosity in the West. We subjoin an account of this wonderful place, and also an engraving, as it appears from the plain below.\n\nWe now pass, in succession, St. Mary's Landing, Mo., 10 miles below.\n\nPRATT'S LANDING, Mo., 2 miles below.\n\nKASKASKIA RIVER, which enters the Mississippi from Illinois, 3 miles below:\n\nCHESTER, Ill., 1 mile below the Kaskaskia.\n\nMARY'S RIVER, which joins the Mississippi, from Illinois, 4 miles below.\n\nPORT PERRY, Mo., 3 miles below.\n\nLIBERTY, Ill., 4 miles below.\n\nWITTEMBURG, Mo., 17 miles below, and come to\n\nDEVIL'S BAKE-OVEN AND GRAND TOWER, which are names given to a portion of a gigantic range of rocks, rising to a great height on both sides of the river, the summits of the range being covered with vegetation, appearing in strange contrast with the rough and barren sides of the rocks which face the water. The current, which is here very swift, has, by its force and constant attrition, separated a mass of rock from the main body; and this stands like a giant sentinel in the midst of the waves, towering to a height of over 50 feet above the level of the river. This isolated rock is called Grand Tower.\n\nThe voyager who passes this place so leisurely and quietly, without dreaming of danger, is reminded, that before steam was introduced on the river, this point was dreaded more than any other on the passage, by the hardy boatmen who traversed these waters. They were only able to ascend by going on shore on the Illinois side, and thence pulling their boats up the stream by means of ropes. The hostile Indians, always on the look-out for plunder, would conceal themselves in the bushes, and, when a favourable opportunity offered, fall upon, rob, and perhaps murder the toiling boatmen. Thus were lives and property lost, in attempting\n\n44\n\nthat which steam now enables us to perform with safety.\n\nWe now pass, in succession, Breeseville, Ill., 2 miles; the mouth of Muddy River, 4 miles; Birmingham\", Mo., 4 miles; Union Point, Ill., opposite; and 3 miles below come to a scene, where Nature has been engaged in playing one of her most curious freaks, known as Devil's Tea-table and Cornice Rocks. The constant action of the water upon the work has worn them into regular shapes, representing continuous rows of cornice rocks, and other architectural devices, of marvellous beauty, which hang majestically over the river, and challenge the admiration of the beholder.\n\nNext we pass B"
