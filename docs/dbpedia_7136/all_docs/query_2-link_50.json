        "text": "The Holiday Train is a great way to get into the festive spirit. It's about 1,000 feet in length with 14 brightly decorated rail cars. Each one is lit with hundreds of thousands of LEDs and holiday designs celebrating the spirit of the giving season.\n\nDepending on the day, visitors can enjoy free musical performances by Tenille Townes and Breland or Dallas Smith and MacKenzie Porter. Any food or cash donations will also benefit the local community.\n\nPlease note: You don't actually get to ride the Holiday Train. It's more of a pop-up concert experience. Or as the railway says in its FAQ page, \"A typical Holiday Train event goes something like this: The train arrives and pulls to a safe stop in front of the crowd. The stage door lowers and the band opens with its first song, followed by a brief presentation with the local food bank officials and other dignitaries on stage. Once the presentation is done the band resumes the show, singing a mix of traditional and modern holiday-themed songs, and popular original songs. After the final song the boxcar door closes and the train is on its way to the next stop.\"\n\nFor more details on the event, visit the Canadian Pacific website, and check out Minnesota's rough itinerary below, including arrival times, dates and destinations.\n\nHoliday Train 2023:\n\n12/6 Rochester at 1605 Civic Center Drive NW (1 p.m.)\n\n12/6 Owatonna at 1145 Park Drive (3:40 p.m.)\n\n12/6 Waseca at 308 South State Street and HWY 13 (5:15 p.m.)\n\n12/6 Janesville at Veteran's Memorial Park (7 p.m.)\n\n12/7 Austin at 550 11th Street NE (5 p.m.)\n\n12/8 La Crescent at The Commadore Food and Spirit (7:15 p.m.)\n\n12/9 Winona at Amtrak Station (3:30 p.m.)\n\n12/9 Wabasha at Gambie Avenue railway crossing (5:30 p.m.)\n\n12/9 Hastings at CPKC Depot (8 p.m.)\n\n12/10 Cottage Grove at South Seiben Bridge (5 p.m.)\n\n12/10 St. Paul at Union Depot (6:45 p.m.)\n\n12/11 Golden Valley at Golden Hills Drive railway crossing (4:45 p.m.)\n\n12/11 St. Louis Park at W.
