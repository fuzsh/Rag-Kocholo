Plans originally called for the boat launch to open for public use in the fall of 2019 or spring 2020.\n\n“There’s really no excuse for not getting this old guy a place close to home to launch his boat,” said Sheldon Ajax, 87, who keeps his 18-foot Lund Tyee fishing boat in his garage at Boutwells Landing Senior Living Complex in Oak Park Heights.\n\nAjax was happy to hear this week that state officials have made significant progress on plans for the boat launch, and that it could open later this year.\n\n“That is great, that’s really great,” said Ajax, who fishes for walleye in the St. Croix at least once a week during the summer.\n\nLAST HURDLES\n\nOfficials from the Minnesota Department of Transportation and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources say they are close to resolving issues concerning access to the site. The road leading to the boat launch is a private access road that serves the St. Croix Valley Wastewater Treatment Facility; the road also crosses a Union Pacific railroad track.\n\nThe railroad tracks are a spur used to assemble and disassemble freight trains filled with coal going to Xcel Energy’s Allen S. King plant in Oak Park Heights.\n\nUnion Pacific officials requested that the access road to the boat launch be moved off railroad land to property owned by the Metropolitan Council and MnDOT. State and Met Council officials have agreed to do so, and the road is expected to be moved about 25 to 30 feet off railroad land, said Kent Skaar, senior project manager for acquisition and development for the DNR’s parks and trails division.\n\n“Union Pacific does not want the public on their property that close to their tracks,” Skaar said. “They are very protective of what that safety zone is.”\n\nOfficials are now working to resolve the project’s last hurdle — changing the designation of the railroad crossing from a private crossing to a public crossing.\n\n“With a public boat launch going in there, it needs to be designated as a public crossing,” said Adam Josephson, east area manager for MnDOT.\n\nIn order for a crossing to be deemed “public,” a road authority must own it, and MnDOT is working to acquire the land rights, he said, adding that the agency plans to make a formal request for the crossing “in the near future.”\n\n“It doesn’t seem like there is opposition to doing it, we just need to go through the process,” he said. “Historically, working with the railroads, it takes longer than you would expect. It is the last mitigation item, so we’re excited to get it done. Everything is doable, we just have to work through the machine.”\n\nDNR officials started working with Union Pacific officials in 2017 to change the designation of the crossing to public, but it wasn’t until early 2021 that railroad officials informed the DNR that it “didn’t have standing as a property owner to request a change in designation of the crossing,” Skaar said. “We were all operating under good faith. There was just a piece of information that we all had not conveyed well enough.”\n\nMnDOT assumed responsibility for the crossing portion of the project last fall, and MnDOT officials are now engaging with Union Pacific officials, Skaar said.\n\nA spokeswoman for the railroad said Thursday that “Union Pacific is aware of the proposed project, but we have not received a formal request to initiate or review a proposed agreement from any government sponsor.” She declined further comment.\n\nLAUNCH PLANS\n\nPlans call for a double-ramp boat launch, which will feature 35 angled boat-trailer parking slots.\n\nTo get to the launch, boaters will drive across the railroad crossing, go around a roundabout and then go down to the launch ramp, Skaar said. After their boat has been launched, boaters will drive their vehicles and trailers back up the road, go around the roundabout again and then park. “All the parking will be angled toward the river,” he said. “When you come to leave, and you’re going to retrieve your boat, you’re going to come back to your vehicle, back up and just stage in line to pick up your boat and leave.”\n\nOnce all the permits are acquired, DNR officials can go out for bids, a process that generally takes about two months, Skaar said. Construction is expected to take two or three months, depending on the weather, he said.\n\nConstruction, however, must be timed around the schedules of threatened and endangered species in the area, including the rusty-patched bumblebee and the northern long-eared bat. “We have to be cognizant of those,” he said. “It’s not as if we are going to impact or take a bee, but we do have to time the construction to avoid the times when they would be there. The same with tree removal. We have to make sure tree removal is done at an appropriate time of the year when it wouldn’t negatively impact the northern long-eared bats.”\n\nDNR and MnDOT officials are committed to completing the project as soon as possible, Skaar said.\n\n“It’s not a question of, ‘Will it be completed?’” he said. “It truly is a question of, ‘When can we complete it based on the remaining issues?’ I think we’ve made progress. It’s just a matter of getting everyone to sign off.”\n\nOriginally Published: February 12, 2022 at 4:22 a.m."
