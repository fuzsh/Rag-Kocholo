        "text": "Highways, Byways, And Bridge Photography\n\nC&NW Rail Bridge\n\nC&NW Mississippi River Crossing At Clinton\n\nClinton, Iowa\n\n• Structure ID: • Location: River Mile 518.0. • River Elevation: 572 Feet. • Railroad: Union Pacific Railroad. • Daily Traffic Count: 50 Trains Per Day (Estimated). • Bridge Type: Steel Through Truss W/Swing Span. • Length: 890 Feet Overall, 460 Foot Swing Span. • Width: Double Track. • Navigation Channel Width: 178 Feet. • Height Above Water: 19 Feet. • Date Built: Opened 1909.\n\nThe railroad bridge at Clinton was built for the Chicago & Northwestern Railroad for their mainline between Chicago and Omaha. The original bridge at this location was the second bridge to cross the Mississippi River. It was involved in several litigations from steamboat operators. The third such lawsuit was conclusively settled in favor of the railroads, ending the war between the bridge operators and steamboat operators. That did not, however, erase the fact that the narrow swing span of the original bridge probably was a navigation hazard.\n\nThe bridge that we see today was built in 1909. It is brute of a bridge and it contains a lot of steel. It has to. Since it serves one the most heavily used Union Pacific Railroad mainlines, it takes a pounding from over 150 trains a day. Interestingly enough, no two spans of this bridge look alike."
