        "text": "There are around 25 bridges throughout the Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota metro that allow you to walk or roll across the Mississippi River and Minnesota River. A few are only used by the railroad. Others have their own historical prominence.\n\nDiscover The Bridges of Minneapolis & St. Paul\n\nThe Twin Cities are divided by the Mighty Mississippi. Here, you can take a virtual stroll on some of these historic bridges. Some pictures are current, others go back as far as 15 years.\n\nSee how many bridges you've crossed.\n\nCedar Avenue Bridge\n\nThree lanes in each direction that carries Minnesota State Highway 77 across the Minnesota River.\n\nCentral Avenue\n\nJust above the dam at St. Anthony Falls.\n\nDartmouth Bridge\n\nU.S. Hyw. 12 bridge that carries more vehicles than any other bridge in the state with 10 lanes of traffic.\n\n10th Avenue Bridge\n\nFormerly called the Cedar Avenue Bridge, connects 10th Avenue Southeast, on the east side of the Mississippi River to 19th Avenue South, on the west side.\n\nBroadway Avenue Bridge (Merriam Street Bridge)\n\nThe current bridge was built in 1987. However, this is number three. A wooden structure was first built in 1857 but washed away in a flood two years later. In 1887 Broadway III was one of the most ornate bridges to be constructed in Minnesota.\n\nBNSF Rail Bridge\n\nSpans the main channel of the Mississippi River between downtown Minneapolis and Nicollet Island.\n\nCanadian Pacific Camden Place Rail Bridge\n\nThe bridge passes over the St. Anthony Parkway. It is the main line crossing of the Mississippi River for the Canadian Pacific Railway transcontinental (Soo Line Railroad) line.\n\nFord Parkway Bridge\n\nJust a short distance up-river from the Twin Cities Assembly Plant Hydroelectric Dam\n\nFranklin Avenue Bridge - (Cappelen Memorial Bridge)\n\nOne of the renowned concrete arch bridges of the 1920s. At the time of construction, it was the longest concrete arch in the world.\n\nHennepin Avenue Bridge\n\nThe Granddaddy of Minneapolis bridges that opened in 1855 is a suspension bridge with 150-foot tall towers. The top picture is from 207. Bottom from 2021.

Pictures are from 1968 and 2021\n\nLowry Avenue Bridge\n\nA beautiful addition to Minneapolis as the Lowry has been rebuilt to honor people, places, and events. Such, when Prince died.\n\nMendota Bridge\n\nCarries State Highway 55 across the Minnesota River valley between Mendota Heights in Dakota County and the Fort Snelling area of Hennepin County. Comprised of 13 rib-arch main spans of 304 feet each, it was the longest continuous, concrete arch bridge in the world when built-in in 1926.\n\nMerriam Street Bridge - (Broadway Avenue Bridge)\n\nConnects to Nicollet Island.\n\nNicollet Island Railroad Bridge\n\nThis was the first Mississippi river railroad crossing in Minneapolis.\n\nNorthern Pacific Bridge Number 9\n\nLocated between the Seven Corners area and the University of Minnesota campus.\n\nPlymouth Avenue Bridge\n\nBuilt in 1873 when Minneapolis consolidated with the city of St. Anthony.\n\nFord Parkway Bridge\n\nServed commuters back in the day traveling to the Ford plant.

The bridge carries Third and Central avenues, which are part of Hwy 65. Construction began in May 2020 and is anticipated to be complete in August 2023. The reverse S-curve alignment and spacing of the arches were\n\nintended to avoid dangerous limestone breaks. The bridge is fully closed to traffic through November 2022.\n\nStone Arch Bridge\n\nBuilt in 1883 this Great Northern Railroad bridge carried two tracks into downtown Minneapolis and at its peak brought 80 passenger trains a day into Union Station.
