        "text": "Twin City Area Railfan Guide\n\nBy Dan Meyer\n\nUpdated November 9, 2022\n\n\"but it still contains errors!\" Send updates and corrections to dan@meyer-family.net.\n\nWARNING / DISCLAIMER\n\nRailroads and cities are dangerous places. Injuries and crimes can happen if you are not careful, and sometimes in spite of your being careful. Therefore, you assume all liability for injuries and / or property loss while you are engaged in any railfan activity. Do not trespass upon railroad or other private property without first obtaining written permission.. This web page provides information only, and no one but you is responsible for any consequence of your use of this information.\n\nBNSF\n\nThe BNSF enters the Twin Cities on ex-CB&Q tracks southeast of Saint Paul, crossing the Saint Croix River into Minnesota from Prescott WI. After crossing into Minnesota it runs near the Mississippi River most of the way until it reaches downtown Saint Paul. From Saint Croix (Junction with CP rail) to Hoffman Avenue, the BNSF uses a joint trackage agreement with CP rail, with the BNSF doing the dispatching.\n\nAt Saint Paul, the BNSF's ex-CB&Q line from Chicago connects to both their ex-GN and ex-NP lines at a point called 3rd Street, not far from the 7th street bridge east of Downtown. The ex-NP route is the double-tracked fast way for freight from Saint Paul to Northtown Yard, in Northeast Minneapolis. The ex-GN is not as fast because it is only partially double tracked, and has more customers of all kinds located along the route, contrasted with the ex-NP route that has fewer customers along it route.\n\nOne major customer facility that exists today on the ex-GN route is the BNSF's Twin City intermodal facility, and is known as the Midway Hub Center. Further along the ex-GN route, the Minnesota Commercial crosses both the ex-GN and the ex-NP line. After crossing the Minnesota Commercial, the railroad passes the UP's East Minneapolis facility (Ex-CNW / nee CMStP&O), and the BNSF's Union Yard. Union Yard is where a spur runs down to the University of Minnesota's power plant near the Stone Arch Bridge. The ex-GN line from Willmar, MN meets the Saint Paul - Northtown route at Minneapolis Junction, a full wye in Northeast Minneapolis. In the middle of the wye is where Steam Locomotive 261 is stored. The route to Willmar (and points west) was once the route of the Great Northern's Empire Builder, now the route has been relegated to secondary mainline status. A couple miles down the Willmar line, BNSF's branchline (and onetime GN mainline to Saint Cloud) to Osseo and Monticello connects at Lyndale Junction.\n\nA few miles further up the ex-GN mainline, the ex-NP from St. Paul joins ex-GN line and then passes the west side of the Soo Line's Shoreham Yard and Shops at University. The line goes through the BNSF's 35th Ave. and Northtown facilities, crosses Interstate 694, and continues west (geographically northwest) after spawning the busy ex-GN line to Duluth / Superior at Coon Creek.\n\nSeveral miles up the line to Duluth is Bethel, MN, is the former home of Independent Locomotive Service. ILS paints and refurbishes locomotives, and sometimes has some interesting railroad equipment stored around their shop.\n\nCP Rail\n\nCP Rail enters the Twin City area on ex-Milwaukee Road rails at Hastings, MN, southeast of Saint Paul. Like the BNSF, CP Rail also generally follows the Mississippi river to Saint Paul utilizing trackage operated jointly BNSF from Saint Croix to Hoffman. CP Rail's major Twin City yard and shops is located just outside of downtown at Saint Paul Yard. From Saint Paul Yard, CP rail travels past the Saint Paul Union Depot, then west up Shortline Hill, with the dormant branchline to the now-demolished Ford Motor Company light truck assembly plant joining at Fordson Junction. This line then passes the Minnesota Commercial Railway roundhouse in the Midway area of Saint Paul, then crosses the Mississippi River, and ends up in an industrial area in south Minneapolis along Hiawatha Ave and south of Lake Street. If you are interested, the Milwaukee Road's passenger station and train shed still stands in downtown Minneapolis, at 3rd street and Washington Avenue, with nary a rail in sight. West from Southtown, the trackage has been removed across south Minneapolis in what is now called the Midtown Greenway. Further west, the ex-Milwaukee Road mainline west of Tower E-14 has been sold to the Twin Cities and Western Railroad. (the tower and the at-grade crossing diamond at E-14 with the CNW ex-M&StL is gone...).\n\nCP Rail also has another mainline across the northern Twin Cities. The ex-Soo Line (Minneapolis, Saint Paul and Sault Saint Marie) extends from their junction with the Canadian National (ex-Wisconsin Central) at Withrow, and goes west past Bald Eagle (crossing of the BNSF's ex-NP Duluth \"Skally\" route), Cardigan Junction (connection with their Saint Paul Sub), New Brighton (Minnesota Commercial crossing / Junction and Canadian National terminal), Shoreham, Camden Junction (their industrial line down the west bank of the Mississippi River toward downtown Minneapolis), Humboldt yard and finally MN&S Junction (and the ex-MN&S Railway). Also located on CP rail, about 20 miles west of Minneapolis on MN Highway 55 is Loram, a rail grinder manufacturer / general railroad contractor.\n\nCP Rail also owns and operates the ex-MN&S Railroad, extending from MN&S Junction in Crystal, south through Golden Valley, Saint Louis Park, Edina, and Bloomington. The branchline to Richfield and South Minneapolis is operated by Progressive Rail. The former MN&S mainline also extends across the Minnesota River at Savage, (The bridge across the river has been purchased by the TC&W and rehabilitated, but sees very little to no use.) Between Savage and Air Lake Park the railroad has not seen a train in decades and good size trees obstruct the route. The remainder of the railroad south from Airlake Park is servicable and is operated by Progressive Rail. The MN&S Shops and yard no longer exist, and their are new office buildings on the site.\n\nMost CP rail traffic travels on BNSF trackage rights from Saint Paul to Shoreham, in Northeast Minneapolis, taking either the ex-NP or ex-GN as traffic conditions dictate. One alternative to the BNSF routes are to take the ex-NP from Dayton's Bluff to Soo Line Junction, where they re-join their own Saint Paul subdivision to Cardigan Jct, and then east to Shoreham. This route is rarely taken, as the Saint Paul sub is has a speed limit of only 10 mph. Another alternate route is to take the ex-Milwaukee Road to the Minnesota Commercial, and use Minnesota Commercial trackage rights to New Brighton. This route also sees little traffic, as the connection at New Brighton is less than ideal.\n\n(note: the following picture was not taken in the Twin City area!)\n\nUnion Pacific\n\nThe UP is a relative newcomer to the Twin City area, having taken over the C&NW in 1995. Their mainline is ex-Rock Island, and enters the area from the south at Rosemount. The ex-Rock Island trackage ends at their South Saint Paul terminal. Most UP trains in the area originate and terminate here. From here, the line runs to St. Paul using two separate routes. The first is an ex-CGW (nee Saint Paul Bridge and Terminal) facility known informally as \"the belt\" and officially as Hoffman Ave. It is located next to CP Rail's Saint Paul yard. The second is also ex-CGW, crossing the Mississippi River on an ancient vertical lift bridge that is slated to be replaced near Saint Paul Union Depot. From either location near downtown, the UP uses trackage rights on BNSF's ex-GN to access most of their other facilities, among them East Minneapolis, just west of MN 280 and the Minnesota Commercial Railway tracks. Trains bound for Duluth / Superior can use either of the BNSF's routes across town.\n\nThe large chemical / industrial complex south of their South Saint Paul terminal at Roseport was built by the CGW Railroad, and is now served by the Union Pacific. This area is served daily by the UP. CP Rail also has trackage and traffic rights to this area.\n\nThe UP also run trains to and from Superior, WI on trackage rights over the BNSF. These trains use either one of the BNSF's lines to get from Saint Paul to Coon Creek, and then BNSF's line to Duluth.\n\nThe UP also has a couple of other interesting lines. The first would be the ex-CMStP&O, known informally as \"The Omaha\". This line crosses into Minnesota at the St. Croix River crossing at Hudson, WI, connecting to the BNSF's ex-GN at Westminster. The Omaha then passes Saint Paul Union Depot, and crosses the Mississippi River just south and west of downtown Saint Paul on Bridge 15, and leads west and southwest through an area from Savage to Shakopee with many industries and grain terminals. On the way to Mankato, there is a medium sized yard known as Valley Park. This is where trains are made and broken up before being delivered to nearby customers. Valley Park is located near State Highway 101 and US 169.\n\nThe UP also operates an industrial railway, the remains of the interuban Minnesota Western. Now an isolated branchline extending from a junction with the CP ex-MN&S in Golden Valley, west to Plymouth (both western Minneapolis Suburbs). The line is operated usually during daylight hours most weekdays.\n\nCanadian National\n\nThe Canadian National's ex-Wisconsin Central's property ends in the far northeastern suburb of Saint Paul known as Withrow. from there, they have a mainline that extends east to Stevens Point, and a heavy duty branchline that extends northeast to the Dresser, WI that presently sees no freight traffic and only hosts the Minnesota Transportation Museum's heritage railroad. This heavy duty branchline is the one time Soo Line mainline to Sault Saint Marie. Today the line ends at a wye at Dresser. The Museum hosts interstate passenger service between Dresser, WI and Marine, MN during the summer months. see their web site www.trainride.org for current information\n\nFrom the end of CN's property in WIthrow they use CP Rail trackage rights to get their trains to and from the Minnesota Commercial's New Brighton Yard, where they break their trains into two blocks, and any excess power lays over. One block travels to both the BNSF at Northtown, and the CP at Humboldt Yard. The other block travels to the Minnesota Commercial yard in Saint Paul.\n\nMinnesota Commercial\n\nThe Minnesota Commercial runs north from a junction with CP rail at their roundhouse on Cleveland Avenue two blocks south of University Avenue, past Amtrak's forlorn Midway Station; It the goes north and west through their yards, turning north again to cross the BNSF's ex-GN line, and then crossing the BNSF's ex-NP line. It the travels north into Roseville, where the BNSF's ex-NP Mulberry Line to White Bear Lake crosses at grade. The Mulberry Line is the one of the lines the railroad has serving in recent years, as it is not profitable for the BNSF to operate. Further north is the crossing of the Soo Line and New Brighton Yard, where there is a utility pole treating plant and the CN depot facility. Even further north, past I-694, is the restored Soo Line depot that once stood at the crossing of the Minnesota Commercial and Soo Line Railroad, is now in Long Lake Regional Park. Near this depot is the junction of the US Government railroad to the former Twin City arsenal. This is also where the line turns west, traveling 3 or 4 miles, terminating just short of crossing University Avenue near 73rd avenue at a their coil steel reload in Fridley.\n\nMany of the railroad's customers are located in a spur from their mainline between Park Junction (ex-NP crossing) and the crossing of the Mulberry Line. This is quite a large industrial park; it is west of MN 280 and East of I-35w, between East Hennepen Avenue and Broadway Avenue.\n\nTwin Cities and Western\n\nThe Twin Cities and Western enters from the west on ex-Milwaukee Road rails. Their trains terminate in Hopkins, where there are two existing railroad depots (ex-MILW currently in use, and CN&W ex-M&StL that is now a coffe house). From Hopkins, TCW trains will travel to CP's Saint Paul Yard, sometimes dropping part of their train at the Minnesota Commercial, and picking up from the Minnesota Commercial on their way back.\n\nThe TC&W also owns the ex-MN&S bridge over the Minnesota River at Savage, and it is intermittently used to access the rail-to-barge facilities at Savage.\n\nAmtrak\n\nAmtrak enters the Twin Cities area at Hastings, where it passes a Milwaukee road depot just before it crosses the Mississippi River on a relatively modern vertical lift bridge. From Hastings, the train travels to Saint Croix, where the train travels generally up the river, using joint BNSF and/or CP rails to get to Saint Paul Yard, where it again uses CP tracks to the Minnesota Commercial and Midway Station. West of the station, Amtrak uses Minnesota Commercial trackage to reach Saint Anthony on the BNSF, where they use either the ex-GN or ex-NP to University, and from University the use the ex-NP all the way to Fargo, ND.\n\nMinnesota Scanner Law\n\nMinnesota has a fairly restrictive law against using a scanner radio in a vehicle. There is one notable exception; If you are a licensed amateur radio operator, no state-issued permit is needed to carry or use a scanner in a car - just carry a copy of your FCC license with you. Here is the text of the Minnesota Scanner Law\n\n299C.37 Police communication equipment; use, sale.\n\nSubdivision 1. Use regulated. (a) No person other than peace officers within the state, the members of the state patrol, and persons who hold an amateur radio license issued by the Federal Communications Commission, shall equip any motor vehicle with any radio equipment or combination of equipment, capable of receiving any radio signal, message, or information from any police emergency frequency, or install, use, or possess the equipment in a motor vehicle without permission from the superintendent of the bureau upon a form prescribed by the superintendent. An amateur radio license holder is not entitled to exercise the privilege granted by this paragraph if the license holder has been convicted in this state or elsewhere of a crime of violence, as defined in section 624.712, subdivision 5, unless ten years have elapsed since the person has been restored to civil rights or the sentence has expired, whichever occurs first, and during that time the person has not been convicted of any other crime of violence. For purposes of this section, \"crime of violence\" includes a crime in another state or jurisdiction that would have been a crime of violence if it had been committed in this state. Radio equipment installed, used, or possessed as permitted by this paragraph must be under the direct control of the license holder whenever it is used.\n\n(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c), any person who is convicted of a violation of this subdivision shall, upon conviction for the first offense, be guilty of a misdemeanor, and for the second and subsequent offenses shall be guilty of a gross misdemeanor.\n\n(c) An amateur radio license holder who exercises the privilege granted by paragraph (a) shall carry the amateur radio license in the motor vehicle at all times and shall present the license to a peace officer on request. A violation of this paragraph is a petty misdemeanor. A second or subsequent violation is a misdemeanor.\n\nSubd. 2. Repealed, 1971 c 71 s 2\n\nSubd. 3. Permit. The superintendent of the bureau shall, upon written application, issue a written permit, which shall be nontransferable, to a person, firm, or corporation showing good cause to use radio equipment capable of receiving a police emergency frequency, as a necessity, in the lawful pursuit of a business, trade, or occupation.\n\nSubd. 4. Repealed, 1983 c 293 s 115\n\nHIST: (9950-48) 1935 c 195 s 8; 1961 c 661 s 1; 1965 c 721 s\n\n1; 1981 c 37 s 2; 1983 c 293 s 91; 1986 c 444; 1987 c 191 s 1\n\nHaving warned you about the consequences of mobile scanning in Minnesota, here is a link to Minnesota Railroad Radio Frequencies\n\nA Few Interesting Twin City Railfan Sites\n\nRecommended map:\n\nIf you will be exploring Twin City area railroads, We recommended that you find a Hudson street atlas at a gas station or convenience store, and use it for navigating around town. It does include the railroads, and has a complete index of all roads and highways in the area. Today it might be easiest to use your favorite smartphone app to find your way around.\n\nChemolite Named for a 3M plant on the ex-MILW route southeast of Saint Paul. Now there is an auto rack unloading facility in addition to 3M and the other customers located here. Take US highway 61 to Jamaica Av., and turn right (south).\n\nCGW Lift Bridge UP's bridge into Saint Paul. Good shots available by taking Kellogg Blvd. to 2nd St., and park near the top of the hill. The UP has been taking initial steps to replace this bridge, so get your photos now!\n\nDaytons Bluff BNSF's automobile unloading facility located across the tracks from CP's Saint Paul Yard. See Saint Paul Yard for directions.\n\nEast Minneapolis UP's ex-CNW, Ex-CMStP&O facility near 280 and Kasota. Much of this facility has been redeveloped into office buildings, but some activity may be found at the east end of the yard. To find the east end of the yard, take MN 280 to Kasota Av., and turn west. Follow Kasota Av. about 3/4 of a mile. To find the abandoned (and partially re-developed) west end, continue west on Kasota another mile and turn left (south) at 17th Ave SE.\n\nEast Minneapolis BNSF's former junction with the Mulberry line to White Bear Lake. Not much here, except the BNSF's ex-NP double track mainline across town and a couple of customers. Exit I-35w at Stinson, and turn south. Turn right at Broadway Av., and left on Johnson St. Turn into parking lot immediately after crossing under the railroad. This is a difficult area to get good photographs.\n\nHastings A river town southeast of Saint Paul on US 61. CP Rail has a depot and yard. The Hastings Patrol (Hastings Local) goes on duty here, and their power is usually a Soo Line GP-38, and this job uses a caboose. The power and caboose usually lays over near the depot. Views of the BNSF and CP mainlines can also be had from the Lock and Dam area just northwest of town. To get to the Depot, take US 61 to Hastings turn east at 6th street, and then turn left on Bailey St. The depot will be ahead on the right. To get to the lock and dam, go west down the main drag through town, under US 61, and turn right on Spring Street (Lock and Dam Road) and look for the railroads across the river.\n\nHoffman Av Take Warner road to Childs Road. Almost all local railroads pass here. See Saint Paul Yard\n\nHopkins CP Rail and CNW once staffed depots here, now only the CP depot is in use by a railroad. Both depots still stand, and the TC&W crews go on duty here; TC&W locomotives wait for crews here quite often. Take US 169 to County 3, Excelsior Blvd., go west, and turn left at 5th Av. Cross the CP rail tracks. Turn left at 3rd street (\"T\" in the road), and turn left again on Washington Av. (another \"T\" in the road); where curves to the right, you will see the CP depot on your left, and the CNW depot across the tracks. Watch out for the semi's serving the Super Value warehouse....\n\nHumboldt Yard CP rail yard in far North Minneapolis. A yard office and some power for local jobs may be found here. Take MN 100 to the Brooklyn Blvd. exit, turn left (south). This road passes over the west end of the yard about 6-8 blocks from the highway.\n\nIndependent locomotive Service On the BNSF line to Duluth north of the area. Not as interesting as it once was, but there is sometimes somthing interesting to be seen here. Take MN 65 north from I-694 to County 24 / 237th Av. (About 25 miles) and turn left. Turn right on County 73 / University Av. Extension, and watch for their facility on the left.\n\nJackson Street MTM's ex-GN shop facility where one may find anything from 44 toners, a rare Westinghouse diesel electric locomotive, EMD Switchers, the GNRHS \"Hustlemuscle\" SD-45 #400 , passenger cars and a steam engine or three undergoing restoration. Take I-35e to Pennsylvania Av., exit and turn west. Turn Right into their parking lot.\n\nJessamine St. and Victoria Av. The only grade crossings on the ex-NP in Saint Paul. Also about halfway up the hill that begins at Hoffman (the top of the hill is near Snelling Ave). Frequent action, with trains occasionally waiting here for clear track down the hill. exit I-94 at Rice St., Turn North (right), and then left on Como. Take Como to Jessamine (just before the tracks, about 2 miles from Rice St.) and turn left.\n\nLoram A rail grinder / contractor located 18 miles west of Minneapolis, outside of Hamel. MN along the CP Rail mainline Take MN 55 west from I-494 to the intersection of Arrowhead Drive (about 6 miles from I-494).\n\nMidway Station Amtrak's former Twin City Passenger Station that is now used as a place to drop off and pick up private cars, located just north of University Ave. at 730 Transfer Road. Minnesota Commercial can be seen moving from their roundhouse to the yard, and the Twin City and Western can be seen setting out and picking up, and occasionally CP transfers can be seen here. Of course, Amtrak trains may also be seen here.\n\nMidway Yard (Midway Hub) BNSF's intermodal facility. Take Snelling Av. to Energy Park Drive, and go west. Not the greatest views. The facility is stretched out along the south side of the road.\n\nMilwaukee Road Station The restored Milwaukee Road Passenger station and train shed, at 3rd Avenue and Washington Avenue, downtown Minneapolis is now a Courtyard by Marriot hotel. Under the trainshed is an ice skating rink. It is worth the price for parking to see the inside of the building and train shed.\n\nMinneapolis Junction BNSF's ex-GN engine facility, most recently abandoned by the CNW (They were a tenant) and later had a roundhouse fire. Today this facility houses Milwaukee Road steam engine 261.\n\nMinnesota Commercial Roundhouse located at 508 Cleveland Ave; take University to Cleveland, turn south 3 blocks. You can get around the back of the shops by continuing south on Cleveland Ave, turning left on Gilbert Av. before crossing the freeway, turn left at Prior Av. (stop sign, 6- 8 blocks), and turn left into the driveway immediately after passing under the railroad overpass.\n\nMounds Park Atop of the bluff above Saint Paul Yard, with nice views of both the yard and downtown Saint Paul. Take I-94 to US 61 South to Burns Ave, and turn right. On Burns Av., Bear to the left on Mounds Blvd., and watch for parking areas.\n\nNew Brighton The Depot that once stood at the crossing of CP Rail and Minnesota Commercial has Depot been moved to Long Lake Regional Park along the Minnesota Commercial and has been restored. Take I 35w to County 95, and turn west. Then turn left on Old Highway 8, and watch for the park entrance on the right. Enter the park, and follow the entrance road to the depot. For a picture of this depot, see the web page at http://www.n0kfb.org/homepage/\n\nNew Brighton Yard / Pole Yards Minnesota Commercial yard located in New Brighton. CN (WC) trains go on duty here, excess power lays over here, and this is where coal trains are interchanged to the WC from the UP. From I-35w, take County Road E-2 east to 5th ave NW and turn left. Follow 5th to the \"T\" in the road and turn right. The yard is just north of the crossing\n\nNewport The former at-grade crossing of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy and Milwaukee Road. Now just double crossovers in joint track territory, there was once a tower and interlocker controlling the plant. The tower survives nearby, moved from it's location along the right of way. The station sign was found on US 61 at 12th street, and the tower is now tucked in behind Newport city hall. Since the reconstruction of the highway in the area, the sign may no longer exist. The old pre-construction directions are: from Saint Paul, take US 61 south to 12th street, turn right and go to 7th Ave, turn left. Take 7th Ave to 6th street and City Hall. Newport Tower is in the backyard. (no trespassing!)\n\nNorthtown BNSF's major facility in the Twin Cities. The actual station sign is located one block north of East River Road and 44th Ave, but better views of the facilities can be had from the 44th Ave bridge over the yard (no parking on the bridge!). Also, trim jobs pulling cars from the bowl tracks may be seen switching the south end of the yard by traveling south on East River Road to Saint Anthony Blvd., and turning left (east). Park on California Street, and walk back to the bridge over the yard.\n\nPark Jct. Crossing of the BNSF's ex-NP line and the Minnesota Commercial. Near the Minneapolis - Saint Paul border. use the MN 280 west frontage road south to end of road. The view isn't the greatest (it's quite a way from the end of the road to the tracks), but it is unobstructed.\n\nRed Rock Spur Interesting industrial spur south of Saint Paul Yard. North Star Steel was the dominant industry here, and they produced rebar for concrete reinforcement from junked automobiles. There was an EMD switcher to switch the plant, and it sometimes may be seen from public areas. Also found further up the road was Rail Systems inc., a rail scrapping outfit. Another interesting operation on this spur is an ADM grain facility, located at the end of the spur. This is a rail to barge facility, and they also use an EMD switcher. Unfortunately, most of their plant is hidden from public view.\n\nSaint Paul Union Depot The Grand Saint Paul Union Depot survives at 4th St. and Sibley St., in Downtown Saint Paul. Amtrak's Empire Builder calls here, as do intercity buses, transit buses and light rail trolleys stop in front of the building. Several rail-oriented events happen here annually; among them train days in the early summer, the CP Rail holiday train stops here and 261's Santa Train has also made apprearances here.\n\nSaint Paul Yard (Hoffman Av.) This is probably the number 1 or 2 spot for local railfans to catch some action. Almost all railroads pass this point, and the 3 class ones have facilities nearby. Take I-94 to US 61 south. Turn right at Warner Road and exit at Child's Road. Turn left just past the cement plant on Pigs Eye Lake Road (it looks like St. Paul Yard driveway.) Cross the first set of tracks (Union Pacific) and park near the highway overpass. Do not cross the CP rail tracks, and stay on the paved public road! Note: railroad police have been asking people to leave this area off and on over the years. If asked to leave, please don't make a fuss.\n\nSoo Line Junction Take I-35e to Maryland, turn west, and then right on Jackson Street. Turn onto Norpac street and walk to the bridge over the BNSF. From this bridge is a sweeping curve to the east, where westbounds will be working very hard. Just to the west is Soo Line Junction, and the CP rail bridge over the BNSF. The only challenge here is photographing through a cyclone fence on the bridge.\n\nSouth Saint Paul UPRR terminal complex and yard along the Mississippi River in South Saint Paul. Take US 61 to I494 West. Exit at Concord Blvd., and turn right. The facility will be about a mile or so north. Parking is available on Hardman Ave / Industrial Road, and good views may be had from the sidewalk on Concord Street or hiking trail on the levee.\n\nSouthtown CP Rail's South Minneapolis industrial switch yard, serving several grain elevators along Hiawatha Ave. (MN 55), from Lake Street to 46 St. South. Now served by the Minnesota Commercial.\n\nShoreham yard / Shops CP Rail's ex-Soo Line Shops and Yard. Much has changed here in the last decade. No longer doing any locomotive repair, as this functions has been moved from here to their Saint Paul facility. Also, this is CP's Twin City intermodal facility. It is along the west side of Central Avenue from 28th Ave to 31st Ave. Some activity can also be seen from University Ave, just south of Saint Anthony Bvld.\n\nStone Arch Bridge James J Hill and his Great Northern Railroad built the Stone Arch Bridge in the late 1800's to bring his railroad into Minneapolis. The bridge hosted passenger and freight trains into the 1980's, until changing conditions made the route surplus. Today the bridge is open to pedestrians, bikes and busses, with nice views of the Minneapolis Skyline available to anyone in the area. Take Washington Avenue to Portland Av., and turn north (right). Follow this to the East River Parkway, and park in one of the small parking lots, or use the Corps of Engineers Upper lock and Dam parking lot at the end of Portland Av. For views from the east side of the river, take University Av. east to 6th av., turn right (south), 3 blocks.\n\nUnion Yard BNSF's ex-GN facility. Union Tower is no longer standing; take 15th av SE to 8th st SE, and turning Southeast. Follow 8th to the end of the road.\n\nUniversity Another very popular spot for local 'fans to hang out in Northeast Minneapolis. BNSF, CN, CP, UP and Amtrak can all be seen here. Take University Av. to 27th St., East one block and park near the tracks. Note: railroad and Minneapolis police have been asking people to leave this area off and on over the years. If asked to leave, please don't make a fuss.\n\nValley Park Yard UP Yard near between Savage and Shakopee, southwest of Minneapolis. Near the junction of MN Hwy 101 and US 169\n\nWestminster Saint Paul, North of downtown. Interesting area, with the BNSF's ex-NP using 2 parallel tunnels, and the GN and UP above the tunnels. Interesting views can be had from the east (geographically south) side of the are from the LaFayette Av. overpass. Park on a side street and walk back to the bridge. Take a friend, as a homless mission is located near the west end of the bridge and homeless have set up camps on railroad property in the area. The Phalen Blvd overpass being also provides interesting picures.\n\nWhite Bear Lake The ex-NP route to Duluth is no longer a through route. One interesting structure still survives, and that is the depot in White Bear Lake. It is a nice brick structure, with a caboose parked nearby. Take US 61 north from I-694, and watch for the depot on the left a couple of blocks past 2nd street in downtown White Bear Lake.\n\nThe Northstar Chapter, NRHS and their library is a good source for Twin City railfan information. Click for more information.\n\nComo Shops, a railfan oriented bookstore, located only online is also a good source of local information."
