        "text": "Traveling downstream with the wind at my back, I am moving at a good pace as I approach downtown St. Paul. The cityâ€™s towering skyline casts its shadow far over the Mississippi River just a few miles past where it and the Minnesota River converge to become one.\n\nThe view is impressive, but I must keep my attention on this section of the swift-flowing river. In addition to the tricky current, this area is busy with small and large recreational boats, paddle wheel riverboats, and barges.\n\nMy favorite part along this stretch is the 2-acre Raspberry Island Regional Park at river mile 839.50. It seems everything collects and connects here. There is a collection of large trees snagged at its most western point. The 1913 St. Paul Union Pacific Vertical-lift Rail Bridge, one of only three vertical-lift bridges along the Mississippi River, seems to come out from nowhere. The 1998 Wabasha Street Bridge with is decorative metalwork, and pastel green and pink trim give the area a little jazz-like style."
