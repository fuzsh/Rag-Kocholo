        "text": "Highways, Byways, And Bridge Photography\n\nChicago & North Western Railroad Bridge\n\nC&NW Saint Croix River Crossing\n\nHudson, WI\n\n• Structure ID: N/A. • Location: River Mile 17.4. • River Elevation: 675 Feet. • Railroad: Union Pacific Railroad. • Daily Traffic Count:: 5 Trains Per Day. • Bridge Type: Steel Truss With Swing Span. • Length: 3,922 Feet (Estimated). • Width: 1 Track. • Navigation Channel Width: 132 Feet. • Height Above Water: 17 Feet. • Date Built: 1872.\n\nThese two photos are views looking southeast from the edge of the river bluffs just off of Minnesota highway MN-95. The photo above is the swing span, which is in the open position. The photo below are the two fixed bridges spans. The larger is a through truss, while the shorter span is a pony truss. The land directly behind the bridge is a natural sandbar. The causeway in the background is the roadway leading to the old US-12 toll bridge.\n\nThese two photos are more views from the river bluffs on the Minnesota side of the river. The photo above is an overview of the bridge spans. The photo below is a view of the railroad causeway leading leading to the bridge from the Wisconsin side of the river.\n\nThese two photos are views of C&NW Railroad bridge at Hudson as seen from the Walnut Street Causeway. The causeway leads to the site of the old Toll Bridge that once carried highway US-12 over the Saint Croix River. The photo above is a view looking north at the west end of the swing bridge, which crosses the river navigation channel. The photo below is looking northwest towards the swing span and the two smaller truss spans at the east end of the structure. The bridge is a little hard to see in this view given that the late fall background is nearly the same color as the bridge structure.\n\nThe photo above is the north side of the C&NW bridge as seen from the marina that is located about a mile north of the bridge. The photo below is a smaller side channel bridge on the Wisconsin side of the river crossing. It carries the railroad mainline into the north end of Hudson, where it will gradually climb out of the Saint Croix River valley and head towards Roberts, Hammond, Baldwin, and Menomonie.\n\nThese two photos are a road bridge on Saint Croix Street leading to an island in the river where the railroad once had Y-track. At one time, this was a railroad trestle, but is now used as a driveway leading to the railroad property on the island. The photo above is looking west down the length of the bridge, while the photo below is looking northwest towards the south face of the structure.\n\nThe photo above is a building located at the east end of the railroad trestle on Saint Croix Street. This building might have been an old railroad building, but I suspect that it is likely a well house for the city of Hudson. The photo below are the remains of a trestle located just south of the bridge on Saint Croix Street. This branch of the railroad crossing over the Saint Croix River once fed a route heading to River Falls, Wisconsin.\n\nThese two photos are an old railroad trestle on yet another branch of the Saint Croix River railroad crossing. This one leads north from the Y-track at the east end of the river crossing. This bridge crosses the mouth of Lake Mallalieu where it flows into the Saint Croix River. This line led to industries in North Hudson, and may possibly have headed north out of the city. The photo above is looking north along the east side of the bridge, while the photo below is looking north down the length of the bridge deck.\n\nThese two photos are additional views of the railroad bridge over the mouth of Lake Mallalieu. The photo above is looking north along the west side of the bridge. The photo below is looking northwest towards the east side of the bridge from across the lake.\n\nThe photo above is a dam that controls the water flow between Lake Mallalieu (to the right) and the Saint Croix River (to the left). Note the railroad trestle just to the right of the dam. The photo below is a bridge on Bridge Street leading to the dam. There is a small dam under the bridge, which is another outlet for Lake Mallalieu."
