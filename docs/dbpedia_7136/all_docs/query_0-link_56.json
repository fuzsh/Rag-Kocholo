        "text": "General Info[]\n\nShort Name: The Milwaukee Road.\n\nCountry of Origin: United States.\n\nLocale: Midwestern and Western United States.\n\nHeadquarters: Chicago Illinois, United States.\n\nEstablished: 1847.\n\nDefunct: 1986.\n\nCause of Demise: Bought out by The Soo Line (DBA Canadian Pacific)\n\nSuccessors: The Soo Line (pre-1990), BNSF (South Dakota and Montana), Union Pacific (Washington state), Canadian Pacific (most of the Midwest) Wisconsin & Southern Railroad (some trackage in Illinois and Wisconsin)\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe Milwaukee & Waukesha Rail Road was established in 1847, marking the beginning of Milwaukee Road history. Its name was changed to the Milwaukee & Mississippi even before it lay its first rails in 1850. It arrived in Waukesha, Wisconsin, 20 miles west of Milwaukee, in 1851. Madison was served by its rails in 1854, while Prairie du Chien, located on the Mississippi River, was reached in 1857.\n\nCompleting its path between the cities bearing its name, the La Crosse & Milwaukee Rail Road created a second route through Wisconsin that connected Lake Michigan to the Mississippi River in 1858. After being restructured as the Milwaukee & St. Paul in 1863, it acquired the Milwaukee & Prairie du Chien, which was the Milwaukee & Mississippi's successor, in 1867.\n\nFollowing the completion of a line from St. Paul to La Crescent, which is located opposite La Crosse, along the west bank of the Mississippi, the St. Paul & Chicago was absorbed by the Milwaukee & St. Paul in 1872. When it completed a line from Milwaukee south to Chicago in 1873, the M&StP added \"Chicago\" to its name the following year.\n\nOver the ensuing years, the road constructed or obtained lines that stretched from Chicago to Savanna, Illinois; from Racine, Wisconsin, to Moline, Illinois; and two lines that ran west across southern Minnesota. In 1882, the road traversed the Missouri River from Omaha to Council Bluffs, Iowa, and in 1887 it arrived in Kansas City. The Milwaukee & Northern, which ran from Milwaukee into Michigan's upper peninsula, went under acquisition of the CM&StP in 1893.\n\nAround 1900, the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul railroad was considered as one of the wealthiest, most innovative, and most ambitious in the United States. Its lines stretched from Kansas City, Omaha, and Minneapolis to Chicago. The majority of Wisconsin, Iowa, and Minnesota between the Omaha and Minneapolis lines was serviced by secondary lines and branches. Lines bridged the Missouri River in three locations in eastern South Dakota: Running Water, Chamberlain, and Evarts. The Missouri River identified the western boundary of the CM&StP, with the exception of the final few miles into Kansas City and the portion that traveled over Union Pacific lines from Council Bluffs to Omaha. The term \"Milwaukee Road\" was not coined until the late 1920s, but \"St. Paul Road\" was occasionally employed as a moniker, but the complete name was utilized in railroad advertisements.\n\nThe 1901 conflict for authority over the Northern Pacific and the Burlington made the Milwaukee Road cognizant of how it could be exposed to the whims of its competitors should it failed to construct an independent route to the Pacific. Concurrently, the flow of traffic on Milwaukee Road fluctuated from a preponderance of wheat to a more proportionate blend of commercial and agricultural commodities. The prospect of building the Panama Canal and the existence of the Union Pacific, Northern Pacific, and Great Northern railroads—all formidable rivals—were used as justifications opposing the westward expansion. Propositions for expanding primarily depended on rising volumes of traveling to and from the Pacific Northwest.\n\nAn engineer was appointed west by the president of the Milwaukee Road in 1901 to determine the amount it was going to cost to reproduce the Northern Pacific's line. It amounted to $45 million. The board of directors of the Milwaukee Road spent awhile to evaluate such an expense, and in November 1905 they sanctioned constructing a line that would have linked the city to Tacoma and Seattle in the west.\n\nMilwaukee Road developed affiliates in South Dakota, Montana, Idaho, and Washington in 1905 and 1906. In 1908, the Washington business acquired the other three businesses and switched its name to the Chicago, Milwaukee & Puget Sound Railway. In 1912, the CM&StP seized it.\n\nThree miles upstream from Evarts, South Dakota, the extension started with a bridge that crossed the Missouri River at Mobridge. Roadbed and rails protruded into uninhabited area at multiple locations. The route to Butte, Montana, became accessible in August 1908 after brisk construction.\n\nThe route from Harlowton to Lombard was that of the Montana Railroad. Its mortgage was held by James J. Hill and the Great Northern Railway. Taking advantage of Hill’s absence on a trip to England, the Milwaukee Road advanced the owner the funds required to pay off the mortgage and bought the railroad through the CM&PS.\n\nConstruction was also under way eastward from Seattle. The last spike on the line was driven near Garrison, Mont., on May 14, 1909. Local passenger service was established later that year, through service in May 1911.\n\nThe Milwaukee elected to electrify the majority of the newly constructed route in 1912. Electrification was put forward by the hilly terrain, the potential for hydroelectricity, the challenges of running steam locomotives through tunnels and during inclement wintertime conditions, and an upsurge in traffic. In late 1916, the entire length from Harlowton, Mont., to Avery, Idaho, was switched to electric operation. The railroad opted to electrify the stretch of the line that stretched between Othello, Wash., to Tacoma at the start of 1917. In 1919, the Coast Division began operating on electricity, and by 1927, catenary had arrived in Seattle. The railroad indicated in 1925 that the savings over steam operation had already equaled to over fifty percent of the $23 million cost of electricity.\n\nThe $234 million cost of the Pacific Extension was significantly higher than projected. Although the prosperity in the Pacific Northwest waned around 1910 and the Panama Canal finished in 1914, traffic on the new corridor fell far short of expectations. The debt accumulated throughout the construction of the extension endured.\n\nFurthermore, the Milwaukee purchased the Chicago, Milwaukee & Gary in 1922 and leased the Chicago, Terre Haute & Southeastern in 1921 for the purpose to obtain accessibility to the southern Indiana coalfields. Both of those roads owed a lot of money. In 1925, The Milwaukee Road declared bankruptcy.\n\nAfter restructuring, the business reorganized itself in 1928 and renamed the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad. Once more, it went insolvent on June 29, 1935. Milwaukee Road experienced certain captivating moments in the late 1930s and early 1940s, notwithstanding economic hardships. It launched the Hiawatha in May 1935 as a swift steam-powered streamliner that linked the Twin Cities and Chicago. It was immediately a smashing and enormous success. Throughout the following years, Hiawathas showed up on numerous routes, the train was reequipped, and service was doubled. The majority of the freight and passenger cars in addition to the majority of the steam locomotives on Milwaukee Road, notably the cars of the Hiawatha, were constructed in the road's Milwaukee works.\n\nThe Milwaukee Road rebounded from bankruptcy amid the postwar boom and maintained a comparatively stable condition of business up until the 1960s. Union Pacific shifted its passenger trains from the Chicago & North Western to the Milwaukee Road's Chicago–Council Bluffs route in 1955, and the Milwaukee Road upgraded its Chicago suburban service in the start of the 1960s. Merger talks took place on with the C&NW and the Rock Island. The Milwaukee received trackage rights on BN into Portland, Oregon, as an integral part of the emergence of Burlington Northern. It also acquired trackage rights across the former Monon line from Bedford, Indiana, to Louisville, Kentucky, as a prerequisite of Louisville & Nashville amalgamation with the Monon.\n\nThe Milwaukee Road's lines west of the Missouri River had minimal alteration during the moment in its history. The most extensive electrification in North America continued in its two separate sections, with trains being hauled over the 212 miles of non-electric track between Avery, Idaho, and Othello, Washington, utilizing steam followed by diesel power. It looked that the electrification would be razed with the onset of dieselization following World War II, but instead the route obtained twelve electric locomotives that General Electric had constructed for the Soviet Union and placed under interdiction due to diplomatic doubts. Milwaukee Road rehabilitated the \"Little Joes,\" which were christened after Joseph Stalin, to their normal height of five feet and retrofitted two of them with steam generators to facilitate passenger transport. They began operating between Avery and Harlowton.\n\nFor a further twenty years, electrification continued, but diesels began appearing under the wires with increasing regularity, occasionally operating in conjunction with the electrics. By the start of the 1970s, a majority of the original electric locomotives had been discarded, passenger services were already extensively eliminated and a significant amount of the electrification's hardware needed to be substituted. The road lacked the necessary funds to repair the power plant since there had been inadequate traffic on the railroad. On June 16, 1974, the Milwaukee discontinued electric operations on the Rocky Mountain Division and deactivated the catenary over the Coast Division in 1972.\n\nThe Milwaukee Road was subordinate railroading, with the exception of its double-track Chicago–Twin Cities main line. It was not the first railroad one would have considered running between, say, St. Paul and Seattle or Kansas City and Chicago. One freight train per day, each way, was scarcely sustained by traffic on the Pacific Extension. The vast majority of the goods transported by the fragile branch lines that snaked throughout Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, and South Dakota were agricultural goods.\n\nThe Pacific Extension, not electrifying between the two energized sections, buying the route into Indiana, and in the 1960s choosing Flexivans—containers with separate wheels/bogies that required special flatcars—instead of traditional piggyback trailers were just some of the disastrous choices made by the road's administration throughout the years.\n\nOn December 19, 1977, the Milwaukee willingly undertook another round of reform amid a string of economically disastrous years in the early 1970s. The primary consequence of the 1977 restructuring was to focus on what became known as the \"Milwaukee II\" system, which connected Chicago, Kansas City, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Duluth (via Burlington Northern rails from St. Paul), and Louisville (but no longer via Omaha). Everything west of Miles City, Mont., was removed.\n\nThe Chicago-Twin Cities main line, Chicago-Savanna-Kansas City, Chicago-Louisville (nearly entirely on Conrail and Seaboard System rails), Milwaukee-Green Bay, New Lisbon–Tomahawk, Wis., Savanna–La Crosse, along the west bank of the Mississippi, Marquette to Sheldon, Iowa, and Jackson, Minn., Austin, Minn.–St. Paul, and St. Paul–Ortonville, Minn., in addition to a few branches, were all components of the Milwaukee system by 1983.\n\nThree roads battled for what became the remains of the Milwaukee: the Chicago & North Western, which was not particularly strong in terms of finances; Grand Trunk Western, a Canadian National subsidiary that aimed to link eastern and western Canada south of the Great Lakes; and Soo Line, a Canadian Pacific affiliate.\n\nDespite not placing first in the \"auction,\" Soo Line was granted the Milwaukee Road in February 1985, and on January 1st, 1986, it was amalgamated. For a brief period, The Soo attempted to operate its light-density lines in Michigan and Wisconsin under different labor regulations as its Lake States Transportation Division. Nevertheless, in October 1987, it sold those lines to Wisconsin Central Ltd., a new carrier which successfully replicated the pre-1909 Wisconsin Central Railway, along with the Milwaukee-Green Bay and New Lisbon-Tomahawk lines that were previously owned by Milwaukee Road.\n\nIn an effort to link up with its parent organization, CP Rail, Soo stationed its operations between Chicago and Twin Cities on the original Milwaukee Road main line and obtained trackage rights on the Chessie System between Chicago to Detroit.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nIn 1982, the Milwaukee Road's two commuter lines in Chicago, namely the Milwaukee District West Line and Milwaukee District North Line, were bequeathed to the newly-created Northeast Regional Commuter Rail Corporation, which does business to this day as Metra.\n\nThe Chicago & Pacific Railroad Company (which constructed a rail line in Chicago which is now the 606), was folded into the Milwaukee Road in the 1880s.\n\nFreight trains rarely had names, but the Milwaukee Road had two piggyback trailer trains running between Chicago and Tacoma: #261 (XL Special) and #262 (Thunderhawk).\n\nAfter 1985, several Milwaukee Road locomotives (especially EMDs) had black paint covering their company's name and engine numbers, dubbing them \"Bandits\". Also the Milwaukee Road emblems were painted over with black paint with the \"SOO\" word plastered over.\n\nThe Milwaukee Road shuttled parts for Ford trucks to the latter's plant in Minnesota. This continued through the Soo Line and Canadian Pacific eras until the factory shuttered in 2011.\n\nSome trackage in Wisconsin and Illinois is operated by the Wisconsin & Southern Railroad on its Fox Lake Subdivision (Janesville Sub).\n\nLocomotive Roster[]\n\nSteam Locomotives[]\n\nMilwaukee road S3 northern 4-8-4\n\nDiesel Locomotives[]\n\nEMD, GP38-2\n\nEMD, SD40-2\n\nEMD, F7\n\nFairbanks Morse, FM H10-44\n\nFairbanks Morse, C liner\n\nElectric Locomotives[]\n\nLittle Joe E-70 Locomotive\n\nE-75B Boxcab Engine\n\nLiveries[]\n\nMilwaukee Road Orange And Black Livery\n\nMilwaukee Road Hiawatha Livery\n\nNotable Engines[]\n\nChicago Milwaukee St. Paul and Pacific railroad #261\n\nChicago Milwaukee St. Paul and pacific railroad #760\n\nChicago Milwaukee St. Paul and pacific railroad #118-C\n\nAppearances[]\n\nTV Shows[]\n\nThe Simpsons - Seen In “Midnight Towboy”.\n\nMovies[]\n\nPublic Enemies (2009)\n\nThe Express (2008)\n\nImage Gallery[]\n\n[]"
