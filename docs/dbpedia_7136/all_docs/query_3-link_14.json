        "text": "Intercity Bridge (Bridge 3575)\n\nHistory and significance\n\nThe Intercity Bridge is one of the largest reinforced-concrete bridges ever built in Minnesota. The bridge was constructed in 1927 and consists of five open-spandrel, two-rib, continuous-arch main spans and six deck girder approach spans. It was designed by Saint Paul bridge engineer Martin Sigvart Grytbak as an intercity bridge carrying the Ford Parkway over the Mississippi River to connect Saint Paul and Minneapolis. The bridge is significant as a representative example of Grytbakâs work and for its type as a reinforced-concrete arch bridge in Minnesota.\n\nLocation\n\nCity of Saint Paul (Ramsey County)\n\nLatitude, Longitude: 44.91786548, -93.20094705\n\nBridge features"
