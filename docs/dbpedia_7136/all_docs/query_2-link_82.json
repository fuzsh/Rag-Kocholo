        "text": "I was driving northeast on Route 66 as I do so often on my trips to historic Claremore. I had some time between appointments, so I decided to take a little side step. You see, I had purchased these beautiful vintage postcards of Rogers County train truss bridges, one entitled “Mo. Pac. Bridge across the Verdigris River, Claremore, Okla.,” the other, “On the Verdigris River, Claremore, Okla.” Two railroads crisscross in Claremore then continue on their way. The Missouri Pacific and Iron Mountain Railroad – also know as Union Pacific’s St. Louis, Iron Mountain, and Southern Railway – takes its path south and east. The Frisco – also know as BNSF’s St. Louis – San Francisco Railway – veers off to Claremore’s south and west. The Missouri Pacific Railroad is the road that passes by the backyard of the Belvidere Mansion.\n\nTruss bridge (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truss_bridge). “Mo. Pac Bridge across the Verdigris River, Claremore, Okla.” Divided back postcard. Atkinson Studio. Publisher: Wheelock. #192533. Postmark Nov. 4, 1910.\n\nRailroad truss bridge Crossing the Verdigris River. “On the Verdigris River, Claremore, Okla.” Divided back postcard. Published by the South West News Company, Kansas City, Missouri. Litho-chrome ANC N.Y. No. C 4093, No. 120789.\n\nApril Churchill and Dorthy Kinzer-Dennis in their book, Postcard History Series, Claremore, page 93, write, “In 1908, the industrious Wofford brothers built the ferry pictured here…. The ferry operated on the river on the Keatonville Hill cutoff road until 1914 when a horse bridge was built. The bridge shown in the postcard is the Frisco Railroad bridge.” If you know where the Keatonville Hill cutoff is, then you know where this bridge must have stood. And who is the guy watching their progress from the railroad bridge above?\n\nThese vintage postcards inspired me. I longed to get a closer look at the current BNSF railroad bridge that crosses the Verdigris River beside Route 66 in Catoosa. I hoped to recreate the moment captured in the vintage postcards. I knew there was no place to stop my car along the west side of the highway bridge, but I recently discovered a sign declaring there was a park to the east. The Roger’s Point City of Catoosa Park has a smoothly paved vehicle loop and more than a dozen metal-covered, stone picnic tables. Off to the west, toward the highway, there is a primitive dirt road. I parked my car on the paved road and took a walk down the rutted, water-puddled dirt one. My mission was to find a path under the Route 66 auto bridge overpass so I could capture photos of the BNSF train bridge that crossed the Verdigris River to the west. Gratefully, the dirt road made the mission a success. Unfortunately, I was not dressed for hiking. Had I been in hiking boots and jeans, and had I been with a companion, I would have braved the weeds, stickers and overgrown river bank to get a closer less cluttered shot of this contemporary railroad bridge.\n\nBridge over the Verdigris River from Roger’s Point Park, City of Catoosa. Standing under the Route 66 highway bridge. April 7, 2017.\n\nI love the romance and pondering about the early transportation that brought new comers and new opportunity to Indian Territory and later to Oklahoma. It is said that railroad builder John M. Bayless settled in Claremore because he understood the importance of its two fine railroads. One wonders if Mr. Bayless and his family ever traveled over the train truss bridges pictured in these vintage postcards.\n\nBy Christa Rice, Claremore History Explorer"
