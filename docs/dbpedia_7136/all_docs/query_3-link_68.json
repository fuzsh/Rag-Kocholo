        "text": "Nicollet Island sure has a lot of bridges. Two of them – the BNSF Railway Bridge (also known as the Nicollet Island Silver Rail­road Bridge) and the Hennepin Avenue Bridge – traverse the island. Two others – the Merriam Street Bridge and the Boom Is­land-Nicollet Island Bridge – con­nect the island to the mainland.\n\nThese two “connectors” on the east channel of the Mississippi are just a half-mile apart and have some interesting history.\n\nMerriam Street Bridge\n\nThis bridge, which takes you from Main Street across the east channel of the river and drops you off by the Nicollet Island Inn, is the oldest of the two bridges, built in 1887. Andrew Rinker was the city engineer back then. He was the king of Minneapolis infrastructure, overseeing street paving, and installation of the Minneapolis Water Works and sewers. In his obituary, he was described as having “had more to do with the development of municipal public utilities than any other man in the city.”\n\nIt was during Rinker’s tenure that the bridge was built. It was manufactured by the King Iron Bridge & Manufacturing Co. of Cleveland, Ohio, the largest highway bridgeworks in the U.S. in the 1880s. The company was started in 1858 by Zenas King. He started out manufacturing iron roofing and boilers, but soon came to specialize in bridges.\n\nThe Merriam Street Bridge is a steel truss through deck bridge. The fancy wrought iron fleur-de-lis at the top of each end were typ­ical King bridge ornamentation. Bridges were not only useful, but decorative as well. The bridge was not built to cross the river at Merriam Street, however, but at Broadway.\n\nThe old Broadway Bridge was constructed with four 257-ft. trusses. When it was torn down in 1985 to make way for a new bridge, the best of the four truss sections was saved and floated downriver to Nicollet Island. Former Northeaster Publisher Kerry Ashmore was on hand to witness the action: “What might seem like a short trip downstream required a number of complicated maneuvers, and lasted from Tues­day till Saturday. An engineering accomplishment, to be sure.”\n\nHe went on to explain the move was funded by money that would have built a freeway – I-335 – across Boom Island through Northeast. Neighborhood opposi­tion was so fierce, the project was abandoned after a 20-year fight, and the new Broadway Bridge was built with the freeway money instead.\n\nAccording to John A. Weeks III, a bridge enthusiast, the Merriam Street Bridge is a wedding of the old and new. He writes on his website, “While the truss section dates from 1887, the piers and the approach spans for the Merriam Street Bridge are new construction. Due to concerns about the bridge structure, it was built on top of a set of steel girders. As a result, the truss no longer supports the main bridge span. Finally, the steel grate deck was removed and replaced with a concrete deck. Wooden walkways were built on the outside of the truss on each side of the bridge.”\n\nHe concludes, “The bridge has the appearance of a 100-year-old bridge, yet is built like a modern bridge. It looks very natural sitting at that location, like it was built to be there from the very start.”\n\nBoom Island- Nicollet Island Bridge\n\nUnlike the Merriam Street Bridge, the bridge that links Boom Island Park to Nicollet Island is in its original location. While the Merriam Street Bridge is suspended 14 feet above the river, the Boom Island-Nicollet Island Bridge sits a little lower – just eight feet above the water, although some sources say 12 feet.\n\nIt was built in 1901 for the Wisconsin Central Railroad by Butler-Ryan of St. Paul. Its designer was Charles F. Loweth, another Clevelander who lived for a time in St. Paul. He designed all kinds of things in connection to railroads, including the train depot in Edgerton, Minn. R.B. Tweedy was the railroad compa­ny’s chief engineer who oversaw the bridge’s construction.\n\nBoom Island was an actual island at the turn of the 20th century, and it was in its heyday used as a landing area for logs floated downriver to Minneapolis’ many sawmills which churned out lumber for the growing city.\n\nFresh-cut lumber was stacked at the lower end of the island to dry.\n\nThe Wisconsin Central Railroad bought property on the lower end of the island to create a railyard, then set about to connect it to Nicollet Island. The 175-ft. bridge provided rail access to and from Boom Island and the Minneapolis milling district, another important railroad customer at the time.\n\nThe railroad bridge was a workhorse, meant to facilitate carrying loads of freight rather than vehicular traffic. It lacks the lattice work and detailing found on the Merriam Street Bridge.\n\nWeeks writes, “The track that connect­ed this yard to the rail network split off of the Great Northern Bridge [The Silver Railroad Bridge] over the east channel behind Nicollet Island. The branch line skirted along the northern edge of Nicollet Island, and then used this bridge to cross the Mississippi River east channel to reach Boom Island.\n\n“The railroad operation on Boom Island was in high gear until after [World War II], where rail traffic in general started its downhill trend.”\n\nThe Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railroad merged with Wisconsin Central in 1961 and created the Soo Line. By the 1970s, the bridge was no longer in use.\n\nBoom Island was nearly swallowed up in the aborted plan to build I-335. The Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board (MPRB) acquired it in 1982, with funds appropriated by the Minnesota legislature through the Metropolitan Council for $2.6 million. The tracks were taken up from the bridge and it was converted to a bicycle and pedestrian crossing.\n\nMPRB gave the bridge a complete overhaul in 2018. The steel supports were strengthened. A new wood plank deck was installed, and a chain link fence was replaced with a safer new cable rail system on each side. Concrete abutment repairs were completed and the bridge was cleaned and repainted.\n\nSources\n\n“Funeral of Former City Engineer to Be Held This Afternoon,” Minneapolis Tribune, March 19, 1918\n\n“Boom Island Bridge (Bridge 93835),” dot.state.mn.us/historicbridges\n\n“Merriam Bridge (Bridge 27664),” dot.state.mn.us/historicbridges\n\n“King Iron Bridge & Manufacturing Co.,” Encyclopedia of Cleveland History, Case Western Reserve University\n\nJohnweeks.com/bridges\n\n“Items of Note in the News,” Northeast­er, Sept. 10, 1986\n\n“Minneapolis Parks Histories,” minneapolisparks.org"
