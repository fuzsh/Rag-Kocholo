        "text": "Post by loopysanchez on\n\nBill, Marty, you guys ok up there?\n\nnews.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070802/ap_on_re_us/minnesota_bridge_collapse\n\nBy PAT CONDON, Associated Press Writer\n\n3 minutes ago\n\nMINNEAPOLIS - The entire span of an interstate bridge over the Mississippi River collapsed during evening rush hour Wednesday, sending vehicles, tons of concrete and twisted metal crashing into the water.\n\nThe Interstate 35W bridge, which spans between Minneapolis and St. Paul, was under construction when it broke into several huge sections.\n\nIt was not clear how many people were injured. A burning truck and a school bus clung to one slanted slab, while at least eight cars and a truck were submerged in the river.\n\nThe bus had just crossed the bridge before it crumpled into pieces, and broadcast reports indicated the children on the bus exited out the back door.\n\nDozens of vehicles were scattered and stacked on top of each other amid the rubble. Some people were stranded on parts of the bridge that aren't completely in the water.\n\nLocal television stations captured video of injured people being carried up the riverbank. There was no official word on injuries, but dozens of rescue vehicles were there. Divers were also in the water.\n\nGregory Wernick Sr., Rockford, Ill., drove over the bridge shortly before the collapse. He stopped to get a drink nearby and heard commotion so he went back.\n\n\"I figure I crossed about 10 minutes before it happened,\" he said. \"That's just too close to call.\"\n\nHe was standing about 200 feet away on top of a parking ramp with large group of people.\n\n\"I've never seen anything like this,\" he said.\n\nThe Homeland Security Department had received no indications Wednesday night that the collapse was an act of terrorism, department spokesman Russ Knocke said in Washington.\n\n\"We continue to monitor the situation. At this time, there's no indication of a nexus to terrorism,\" Knocke said.\n\nPost by billhammond on\n\nI got called into work, will be here a few hours.\n\nThis is a major catastrophe and will alter life here for years. It's the biggest Mississippi River bridge of all in the area. I cross it almost daily, but as usual, avoided it on the way home, as the freeway is too crowded then and I have a surface-street route. Had I taken it home tonight, I would have crossed it about an hour before it collapsed.\n\nAnd now we have storms about to hit.\n\nI would guess we have at least 20 or 30 dead.\n\nPost by billhammond on\n\nHow could this happen? They monitor the HELL out of these bridges. They were doing the usual summer maintenance on the deck and the deicing system, but nothing with its structure.\n\nI mean the WHOLE MIDDLE of the thing just collapsed. It's 1,900 feet long and I bet 1,000 of it is in the river, along with dozens of cars.\n\nBuilt in the late 1960s, never hit by a ship or anything, as far as I know. The lock is nearby, so there is no boat traffic.\n\nPost by billhammond on\n\nHanners should be OK, as he lives and works on the east side of the river. MnHermit is way up north. Radtke is way east, although I am not sure where his workplace is, exactly.\n\nTim Rozelle (DocR) is visiting the area, but is well off to the east in River Falls, Wis., where his beloved KC Chiefs have their training. He and his family and I are sposed to meet at Podium noonish tomoro."
