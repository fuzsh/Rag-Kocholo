        "text": "Bridge 9300\n\nHistory and significance\n\nBridge 9300, constructed in 1961, carries State Highway 5 (West 7th Street) over the Mississippi River in Ramsey County. It is a continuous steel girder bridge. In response to concerns about nearby historic Fort Snelling, the bridge was realigned and designed to connect with Bridge 27027. This allowed State Highway 5 to pass beneath the historic fort rather than bisecting the site and severing the fortâs physical connection to other parts of the historic property. The bridge is significant as an example of the local impact of and response to highway development and the avoidance of impacts to historic and cultural resources.\n\nLocation\n\nCity of Saint Paul (Ramsey County)\n\nLatitude, Longitude: 44.89404302, -93.18182615\n\nBridge features"
