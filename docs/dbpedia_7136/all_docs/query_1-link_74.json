        "text": "\"Hill's Folly\"\n\nThe Building of the Stone Arch Bridge\n\nby Ray Lowry\n\nOriginally published in the Hennepin County History, 1988\n\nStone Arch Bridge streaming video by Ray Lowry\n\nIn 1880, Minneapolis was a blossoming city of over\n\n45,000. Just eight years had passed since the city\n\nhad merged with St. Anthony, its sister city on the\n\neast bank of the Mississippi River, and during that\n\nshort period of time the population of the combined\n\ncities had more than doubled. Yet little had been\n\ndone to bind the two parts of Minneapolis together.\n\nThe main business hub of the city, like today,\n\nwas located on the west side of the river, as were\n\nmost of the city's flour and saw mills. On the east\n\nbank, one could find a few smaller mills, scattered\n\nshops and hotels, and less than twenty percent of\n\nthe city's total population. This sense of urban\n\nschizophrenia was compounded by the fact that the\n\ncity's main railroad links, so crucial to urban\n\ngrowth in the 1880s, were also located on the\n\nunderdeveloped east side of the river.\n\nAs the only Mississippi River crossing open to\n\nMinneapolis pedestrian and passenger traffic,\n\nthe Hennepin Avenue suspension bridge was of vital\n\nimportance. Yet this structure, while only\n\ntwenty-five years old, had fallen into a state\n\nof disrepair. \"We do not believe there is a city\n\non the civilized globe outside of Minneapolis\n\nwhich would permit a bridge of the importance of\n\nthis - forming the connecting link between two\n\ngreat divisions of the city - to get into such\n\na shameful condition of dilapidation,\" wrote\n\nthe editors of St. Paul's Pioneer Press (April\n\n20, 1882).\n\nAccording to the Pioneer Press, travelers arriving\n\nat the rail depot on Minneapolis's east side were\n\ntaking their lives into their own hands by even\n\ncrossing the bridge. \"A swamp corduroy (road) is\n\na delightful pleasure drive compared with the\n\nholes, the ruts, the pitfalls and the snares which\n\nthe rotted pine blocks in this thoroughfare\n\nconstitute,\" the article added.\n\nAlthough the Pioneer Press's description of the\n\nbridge was undoubtedly exaggerated, the availability\n\nof ready transport into central Minneapolis was of\n\ngreat concern to the city's business community.\n\nManagement of the Hennepin Avenue suspension bridge\n\nwas, it seems, a bit of an embarrassment to the\n\ncity. The structure was a toll bridge under control\n\nof the mayor's office. Although the bridge had\n\nbeen completely refurbished in 1876 at great\n\nexpense, the condition of the structure remained\n\ndeplorable. Consequently, many of the city's\n\nbusiness leaders came to believe that the bridge's\n\nrenovation funds had been squandered by city officials. (1)\n\nThe fact that various mayors treated the suspension\n\nbridge as an item of personal property didn't help\n\nmatters either. One mayor had gone so far as to\n\nallow the penniless widow of a former crony to move\n\ninto the bridge's tollhouse where the destitute woman\n\nresided until her death. (2) What was needed, in the\n\neyes of Minneapolis businessmen, was a new bridge - one\n\nnot in the hands of the politicians - that would\n\nbring railroad passengers directly into the central\n\nbusiness district of Minneapolis.\n\nTo embark on such an undertaking, Minneapolis business\n\nleaders turned to St. Paul's up-and-coming railroad\n\nentrepreneur, James J. Hill. Hill eagerly plunged\n\ninto the task and, within a few short years, managed\n\nto bring the venture to completion. Known to critics\n\nas \"Hill's Folly\" at the time of construction, the\n\nresulting bridge still stands, as solid today as on\n\nthe day it was completed in 1883. Known simply as\n\n\"the Stone Arch Bridge,\" this 2,100-foot-long, 100,000\n\nton structure helped usher the railroad age into\n\nMinneapolis. The eye-pleasing design of the bridge,\n\nwith its twenty-three gracefully curving arches, soon\n\nbecame a landmark of the city, adorning numerous\n\npostcards and the letterheads of countless Minneapolis\n\ncorporations.\n\nIn all likelihood, \"Hill's Folly,\" perhaps the oldest\n\nmajor structure in the city of Minneapolis and the\n\nsecond oldest bridge spanning the Mississippi River, (3)\n\nwill remain intact for a second century; perhaps even\n\na third or fourth. This, then, is the story of James\n\nJ. Hill's Stone Arch Bridge, one of the most remarkable\n\npieces of nineteenth-century architecture still in\n\nexistence in Hennepin County.\n\nThe Man\n\nIn the early 1870's, James J. Hill was considered\n\nsomething of a buffoon by many Minnesota businessmen.\n\nWhen the area around Winnipeg, Manitoba was first\n\nopened up to white settlers in 1858, Hill had managed\n\nto make himself a small fortune in what many regarded\n\nas a wildly lucky business venture. A few of Hill's\n\nbusiness associates had purchased two dilapidated\n\nMississippi River steamers in St. Paul, which they\n\ndismantled, loaded on oxcarts, and hauled all the\n\nway across the state to the Red River country.\n\nThe steamers were then reassembled and put to work\n\nhauling much-needed Red River freight from the oxcart\n\ntrails in Minnesota to the booming settlements\n\naround Winnipeg.\n\nJim Hill, recognizing a fantastic business opportunity,\n\nacted as purchasing agent for much of this Winnipeg-bound\n\nfreight. When rail lines were pushed through to\n\nBreckenridge and Moorhead, Minnesota, settlers flocked\n\nto Manitoba and Hill dreamed of a business empire\n\nin the north. But river steamers were a seasonal\n\nform of transportation, and during the long winter\n\nmonths Winnipeg was accessible only by dog sled.\n\nHill, who had made this grueling journey on numerous\n\noccasions, dreamed of a more practical means of\n\nexploiting the growing market in the north.\n\nJim Hill soon had his eye on the St. Paul and Pacific Railway\n\nCompany, a pretentiously named bankrupt line whose tracks barely\n\nreached the Dakota border. Years earlier, a $13,800,000 bond issue\n\nhad been floated to fund this supposed transcontinental line,\n\nyet only five hundred miles of mostly unusable track had ever\n\nbeen laid. A classic case of nineteenth-century railroad looting,\n\nmost of the St. Paul and Pacific's capital had been\n\nsiphoned off to a number of dummy construction companies\n\nand shadowy managers, leaving the bondholdersmostly Dutch\n\nventure capitalistswith \"two streaks of rust and a right of way\"\n\nfor their trouble. (4)\n\nThe line was in such dismal condition that when it went bankrupt in 1873, the\n\nreceiver had to inspect some of the company's property by handcar\n\nbecause the line's single, rickety locomotive was unable to\n\nnegotiate many of the poorly constructed stretches of track!\n\nThis was the railroad Jim Hill dreamed of acquiring.\n\nConvinced that the St. Paul and Pacific could be a money-making\n\noperation. Hill ignored his critics and moved to acquire the\n\nbankrupt line. In a complicated stock transaction, Hill and a group of\n\nMontreal financiers managed to gain a controlling interest in the\n\nline. Critics howled with laughter, yet Hill had the last laugh. The\n\nrechristened St. Paul, Minneapolis and Manitoba Railway,\n\nor the \"Manitoba Road\" as it was more commonly known, almost\n\nimmediately became a profitable enterprise.\n\nHill's first major chore was to replace the Manitoba Road's\n\nexisting track. He steadily replaced the original low-grade iron\n\nrails with rails of high-quality steel, and the Manitoba Road\n\nsoon became known as a quality road. By 1880, four of the major\n\nrailroads serving the Minneapolis/St. Paul market used Hill's track\n\nwhen they ran their trains between Minneapolis and St. Paul.\n\nA union depot was eventually constructed in downtown St. Paul\n\nfor use by these lines, and it rapidly became one of the busiest\n\nand most efficient rail terminals in the country. When Minneapolis\n\nbusiness leaders expressed interest in building a similar union depot\n\nin downtown Minneapolis (with a viaduct connection to the\n\nManitoba Road's track on the opposite side of the Mississippi\n\nRiver), Jim Hill was the man to whom they naturally turned.\n\nThe Plan\n\nOn November 28, 1881, James J. Hill and several Minneapolis\n\nbusinessmen met at the old Nicollet House Restaurant to\n\ndiscuss construction of a downtown rail terminal and a short-line\n\nrailroad linking that terminal with the Manitoba Road's St. Paul-to-\n\nMinneapolis line. The men organized the Minneapolis Union\n\nRailway Company for this purpose and formally incorporated\n\nthe company on December 1, 1881.\n\nOn January 9 of the following year, the company held its first\n\nstockholders meeting, and James J. Hill, as owner of 232 of 250\n\nshares of stock, was elected president. Col. Charles C. Smith\n\nwas appointed chief engineer of the project, the Central Trust\n\nCompany issued $3,000,000 worth of bonds (guaranteed at 6%\n\nper annum by the St. Paul, Minneapolis and Manitoba Railway\n\nCompany), and a contract was entered into with Edward\n\nDarragh and Michael Haviland to construct a stone-arch viaduct\n\nacross the Mississippi River. (5)\n\nHill had originally proposed to build an iron bridge across the\n\nMississippi River at Nicollet Island, just upriver from the\n\nexisting suspension bridge. The river reached its narrowest point\n\nat that location and he believed construction costs could be kept\n\nto a minimum. Such a location would also provide the most\n\ndirect route into downtown Minneapolis where Hill wanted to\n\nbuild his union depot. But Col. Charles C. Smith, Hill's West\n\nPoint-trained engineer, believed the massive stone pillars needed\n\nto support a railroad bridge might create a choke point in the river,\n\ncausing ice and log jams.\n\nSmith also feared that any major construction on the Mississippi\n\nriverbed above the Falls of St. Anthony might cause a\n\ndestabilization of the falls.(6) Year after year,\n\nthe sandstone layer underlying St. Anthony Falls was steadily being\n\neaten away by erosion. This erosion was causing the falls to\n\ngradually \"migrate\" upstream. Smith feared that punching\n\nthrough this sandstone layer with bridge piers might fracture the\n\nentire foundation of the river floor, accelerating the migration\n\nof the falls. This, in turn, would result in wholesale disruption of\n\nthe water power upon which the flour and lumber milling industries\n\nof Minneapolis depended. A similar break-up of the falls had\n\noccurred in October 1869 when a tunnel being dug between\n\nNicollet and Hennepin Islands collapsed. Millions of gallons of\n\nriver water gushed through the tunnel, taking large segments of\n\nthe two islands with them. Workmen labored frantically to plug\n\nthis huge leak, but the Herculean task wasn't accomplished until the\n\nfollowing spring. No one, least of all Jim Hill, wanted to see a\n\nrepetition of that disaster. Col. Smith's answer, then, was to build\n\nbelow the falls at considerably greater expense.\n\nSmith proposed to construct a solid stone bridge cutting diagonally\n\nacross the Mississippi River. The west end of the bridge would\n\nlie just below the St. Anthony Falls mill district and the east end\n\nwould lie 500 feet downstream from the Hennepin Avenue suspension bridge.\n\nThe proposed double-tracked bridge would terminate at a union depot located\n\nbetween Nicollet and Hennepin avenues. Believing that the project-\n\nwould be of \"direct and immediate benefit\" to the mill\n\nowners. Hill hoped \"to have the fullest and most earnest cooperation\n\nof the people at the falls on both sides of the river.(7) But Jim\n\nHill soon learned that the benefits of one party often conflict with\n\nthose of another.\n\nTo build his bridge. Hill needed to acquire certain tracts of land\n\nalong the river. He had begun this process eighteen months earlier\n\nwhen he purchased the St. Anthony Water Power Company for\n\n$425,000. The sale was widely reported in the press, as was Jim\n\nHill's motive in making the purchase. No one believed Hill\n\nhad the slightest interest in getting into the water-power business.\n\nThat Hill needed to acquire the necessary right of way for his\n\nproposed railroad bridge was readily recognized.\n\nBut two parcels of land along the proposed bridge route lay beyond\n\nHill's immediate grasp. The first of these, located on the St.\n\nAnthony side of the river, was occupied by the Mornson Sawmill\n\nCompany. The second, a piece of land at the foot of\n\nHennepin Island, was occupied by the Farnham & Lovejoy\n\nSawmill Company. Dorilus Morrison, Sumner Farnham and\n\nJames Lovejoy, the proprietors of the businesses in question, were\n\naware of Hill's plans. The three men drove hard bargains when\n\nHill sought to buy them out. The Farnham & Lovejoy operation\n\nwas initially offered $35,000 to surrender their site, but the pair\n\nscoffed, demanding $150,000. The Morrison Company was\n\nequally adamant.\n\nIn desperation, Hill wrote to his friend Cadwallader C. Washburn,\n\npresident of the Minneapolis Water Power Company and\n\nformer business associate of Farnham and Morrison, imploring\n\nhim to assist Hill in acquiring the sites: \"In lieu of the enormous\n\namount we have to invest in the bridge and Union Depot and the\n\nfact that our resources wouldn't be materially increased, I ask that\n\nyou will consider the enterprise on our part, awfully beneficial to\n\nall property in Minneapolis, and that in asking a price, these facts\n\nwill be borne in mind.(8) Washburn was sympathetic, but\n\nhad little influence over his former business associates. Eventually\n\nDorilus Morrison came to terms with Hill, but Farnham &\n\nLovejoy continued to hold out. In the end. Hill gave in, purchasing\n\nthe pair's property for $112,000. This was one of the few\n\noccasions when Jim Hill was outfoxed in a business deal and\n\nthe thought must have stung him. When he reported news of the\n\ndeal to his lawyer, he sheepishly wrote: \"I trust you will not\n\nconsider that I was too free in making this purchase.\" (9)\n\nThe Task\n\nOn a cold January morning in 1882, press reports indicated that\n\nground had been broken and construction begun on \"the great\n\nviaduct.\" Although control of the two disputed pieces of property\n\nhad not yet been resolved, Darragh and Haviland, the contractors\n\non the project, began work in earnest. A small crew had been\n\nhired to begin the project and within days derricks, tool houses\n\nand steam-driven engines were assembled and put into place on\n\nboth sides of the river. \"The gentlemen comprising the firm\n\nare among the most successful and energetic railroad builders in the\n\ncountry,\" reported the Pioneer Press on Jan. 13, 1882, \"and\n\nbefore many days the people of Minneapolis will be enabled to see\n\nhow much can be accomplished in a short time by concentrated\n\nand well directed energy.\" Within weeks, nearly 600 men were at\n\nwork on the project. About 300 of these were employed as a day\n\ncrew and 125 made up the night shift. Another 150 were set to\n\nwork cutting limestone blocks from a quarry on the east bank of\n\nthe river.\n\nThe workers were paid $1.25 a day for their labors and most\n\ncertainly earned every nickel of it. While heavy construction has\n\nalways been grueling work, in 1882 it could be brutal. On\n\nFebruary 21 of that year, the Pioneer Press noted that \"twenty\n\nor thirty men were busy up to their waists in the icy waters.\"\n\nThese laborers were constructing a number of coffer damscircular\n\nstructures in the middle of the river from which the water could\n\nbe pumped with steam-driven centrifugal pumps. When completed,\n\nthese dams allowed workers to prepare the necessary\n\nfoundations of the bridge upon the temporarily dried floor of the\n\nriver. While the workers were provided with \"great rubber\n\nboots,\" said to be \"necessary for the amphibious character of the\n\nemployment\" (Pioneer Press, Feb. 18, 1882), it is hard to imagine\n\nthat the work was anything but torture. Yet, the icy waters were\n\nonly one of the dangers that the river posed for these men. During\n\nthe winter of 1882, those hardy souls who braved the icy chill of\n\nthe Mississippi River also struggled with its raging currents,\n\ncurrents capable of sweeping a man to his doom.\n\nOn February 26, after just forty-five days of work on the bridge,\n\nthe first casualty occurred. Joseph Schmidt, a young Prussian\n\nimmigrant, met his death in the rapids below the falls. Schmidt\n\nwas helping to build one of the piers on Hennepin Island when\n\nhis foreman ordered him to take a message to a crew doing similar\n\nwork on Upton Island. While maneuvering a small rowboat\n\nthrough the strong river currents, Schmidt apparently lost control of\n\nthe craft and was swept into the rapids downstream. Once in the\n\nchurning rapids, the small boat struck a large cake of ice, upsetting\n\nthe craft and throwing the occupant into the river. Schmidt\n\nstruggled for a few moments before sinking into the churning\n\nwaters. When the victim's foreman was questioned as to the\n\nwisdom of sending a lone man to navigate a tiny rowboat through\n\nsuch waters, the foreman retorted: \"Schmidt became thoroughly rattled\n\nand was drowned through lack of nerve and ordinary presence of mind\"\n\n(Pioneer Press, Feb. 27, 1882).\n\nBy the spring of 1882, all but one of the bridge's twenty-three\n\nfoundations were completed and the entire site was connected by a\n\nseries of rickety wooden tramways. Horses were employed to\n\ndrag huge stone blocks along these tramways, where equally\n\nrickety derricks swung the huge blocks onto the growing piers.\n\nFour sputtering steam engines provided the power necessary for\n\nsome of the derricks to hoist the stone into place. But more often\n\nthan not, the blocks were raised and lowered by means of horse-\n\npower. A number of windlasses were employed for this purpose\n\ndevices that permitted draft horses, walking in circles, to coil\n\nthick ropes around wooden drums. On one of these contraptions,\n\nthe bar passing through the shaft of the windlass snapped,\n\ncausing an 800-pound block of limestone to tumble into the river.\n\nThe weight of the limestone caused the windlass to be spun\n\nwith \"lightning rapidity\" and a piece of the shattered windlass\n\nwas hurled away with great velocity. The flying debris struck\n\nthe operator of the device, a young immigrant named John\n\nDonovan, instantly crushing the poor man's skull, \"Knocked into\n\nEternity\" read the newspaper headline (Pioneer Press, April 30,\n\n1882).\n\nIn many respects, the technology used in building the Stone Arch\n\nBridge had been around since antiquity. The very idea of draft\n\nanimals and gangs of sweating workmen moving huge stone\n\nblocks into place brings to mind the Egyptian pyramids. But in\n\nspire of the primitive engineering techniques employed by Hill's\n\nmen, the Stone Arch Bridge could have been built during no earlier\n\ntime period. While much of the limestone used on the bridge was\n\nquarried on the spot, thousands of tons of stone had to be shipped\n\nin, often from hundreds of miles away. The stone quarried at these\n\ndiverse locations could never have been efficiently transported ro\n\nMinneapolis without the growing rail network that existed in the\n\n1880s.\n\nThe foundations for the bridge's piers were built of solid granite\n\nhauled in from Sauk Rapids, Minnesota. All exposed, work on\n\nthe upper portion of the bridge was built of magnesium limestone\n\nquarried at Mankato, Minnesota and Stone City, Iowa. Marble,\n\nused for the trimming on the deck of the structure, came from\n\nBridgeport, Wisconsin. Limestone, used for the unexposed\n\nportions of the bridge, was quarried on the site. In all,\n\n100,000 tons of stone were needed for the project and the\n\nlogistics of supplying such a huge amount of material was no simple\n\nmatter. From June 1882 until November 1883, not less than five\n\nmarble-laden railroad cars were contracted to leave Bridgeport\n\neach and every day. During the same period, 2,000 carloads of\n\nMankato limestone were used. Hill, ever the stickler for derail,\n\nwas a very quality-conscious businessman. When he became\n\ndissatisfied with the quality of stone being shipped from\n\nMankato, he solved the problem in typical Jim Hill fashionhe\n\nsimply purchased the Mankato quarry.\n\nIn order to bond such a huge amount of stone together, an\n\nequally large amount of mortar was required. In all, 30,554 cubic\n\nyards of various cements were used on the project. Because much\n\nof the masonry work was done during the winter, a method of\n\npreparing cement in subfreezing temperatures had to be devised.\n\nCol. Smith, the chief engineer of the project, came up with a simple\n\nsolution to this problem. Eight quarts of salt were incorporated\n\ninto each barrel of cement and then mixed with hot water. The\n\nsalt content of the solution prevented the cement from freezing\n\nand, upon drying, the salt was simply absorbed into the pores of\n\nthe stone.(10)\n\nBy the spring of 1883, the last of the foundations had been\n\ncompleted and the bridge's piers were rapidly rising above the waterline.\n\nThe graceful arches of the bridge began to take shape. As they rose\n\nabove the water, the piers curved outward on either side, forming\n\nthe bridge's distinctive arches. The arches were designed to be of\n\nvarying sizes, spanning from 40 to 100 feet. Like any self-supporting\n\narch, they were incapable of standing without external support\n\nprior to completion. As a result, thousands of heavy timbers were\n\nused to prop up the unfinished structures. These creaking and\n\ngroaning timbers shivered under the weight of the half-completed\n\narches. Sometimes they collapsed, with tragic results. The third, and\n\nfinal, casualty on the project involved a young man who was\n\ncrushed when a violent gust of wind caused the timbers holding\n\none partially completed arch to give way. But when things went\n\nas planned and the two halves of an uncompleted arch approached\n\nvery near to one other, the uppermost stonethe keystone\n\ncould be dropped into place and hammered home with huge\n\nwooden mallets. Once completed, the arches became as solid as the\n\ngranite and limestone deposits from which they were quarried.\n\nThe Legacy\n\n\"Speed is the characteristic of American civilization; everybody\n\nis in a hurry, and no sooner is one device for overcoming time and\n\nspace successfully put to use, than people find it too slow, and brain\n\nand money are drawn upon to start an improvement.\" So reads\n\nthe account in the Pioneer Press of the completion of the Stone Arch\n\nBridge (Nov. 17, 1883). One of the most important features of\n\nHill's creation, it seems, was that it reduced travel time between\n\nMinneapolis and St. Paul to an astonishing twenty minutes.\n\nBecause the Minneapolis/St. Paul route crossed no city Streets, trains\n\nleaving one city could immediately put on full steam and\n\nrush through to the other. Even when crossing the new bridge,\n\ntrains could achieve top speeds. The heavy stone walls on either\n\nside of the structure's upper deck were said to be so massive that,\n\nin the event of a derailment, trains could neither jump over nor crash\n\nthrough them. (11)\n\nThis was quite different from most railroad viaducts. The\n\ntypical railroad bridge of the day was a wobbly wooden affair over\n\nwhich trains literally had to creep. They were usually cut-rate structures,\n\nbuilt of timbers felled on the spot, and intended to last only a few years.\n\nHill's bridge, by contrast, was a $650,000 stone monument built for the\n\ncenturies. \"Firmer than the earth,\" is how the Tribune described Hill's\n\ncreation (Nov. 23, 1883). \"More solid than the ground itself,\"\n\ndeclared the Pioneer Press (Nov. 17, 1883).\n\nWhile a union depot had yet to be completed, contractor George\n\nBrackett's shovel brigade was said to be \"tearing up the dirt at a brisk\n\nrate.\" The original plans called for a depot between Hennepin and\n\nNicollet avenues, but the site being prepared by Brackett's men\n\nwas located on the river flats beneath the Hennepin Avenue\n\nsuspension bridge. Pedestrians leaving the new facility would\n\nclimb a set of stairs and emerge from the building in the middle\n\nof Bridge Squarethe very center of activity in Minneapolis. In the\n\nmeantime, a temporary depot was established at the end of Fourth\n\nStreet, and at long last travelers were able to step off a passenger\n\ntrain in the heart of Minneapolis.\n\nThe Union Depot was completed in April 1885. The design of the\n\nbuilding was said to be \"almost severe in its simplicity,\" but the\n\nTribune insisted \"one must enter the building to appreciate its\n\nbeauty, convenience and spaciousness\" (April 23, 1885). The\n\nNorthern Pacific Railway; the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &\n\nOmaha Railway; and the Minneapolis & St. Louis Railway\n\nimmediately joined Hill's Manitoba Road in using the facility.\n\nWithin a few years, the Chicago, Burlington & Northern Railway;\n\nthe Eastern Railway Company of Minnesota; and the Wisconsin\n\nCentral Railway Company followed suit. Every passenger\n\nrailroad then serving Minneapolis used Hill's Stone Arch Bridge and\n\nUnion Depot with one exceptionthe Milwaukee Road.\n\nAlthough officials of the Milwaukee Road entertained the\n\nidea, they just could not bring themselves to rent space in\n\nanother line's depot. Milwaukee Road officials eventually\n\nconstructed a passenger depot of their own a few blocks away.\n\nWhen the Rock Island Line and the Minneapolis, St. Paul & Sault\n\nSte. Marie Railroad (or the \"Soo Line\") began serving Minneapolis\n\nin later years, they, too, used the Milwaukee Depot rather than\n\nthe Union Depot.\n\nNevertheless, the Stone Arch Bridge and the Union Depot were\n\nthe pride and joy of the downtown Minneapolis business\n\ncommunity. On September 10, 1884, a group of downtown\n\nbusinessmen held a testimonial dinner for Jim Hill and presented\n\nhim with a massive silver tray as a token of their appreciation. The\n\ntray, a two by two-and-one-half-foot solid silver work of art, was\n\ninscribed with a detailed engraving of the Stone Arch Bridge, as\n\nwell as eight smaller engravings representing significant\n\ndevelopments in Hill's career. One could see the oxcart trains crossing the\n\nMinnesota plains, a dogsled journey to Winnipeg, steamboats on\n\nthe Red River. This beautiful gift was a creation of Tiffany &\n\nCompany of New York City and is now part of The Minneapolis\n\nInstitute of Arts' permanent collection.\n\nHill's partners in the Minneapolis Union Railway Company were\n\nalso present at the testimonial dinner. They, too, had reason to\n\nfeel proud. The company's Union Depot was destined to become\n\none of the busiest rail terminals in the country. Their Stone Arch\n\nBridge was already one of the best-known landmarks of the city.\n\nConstruction of both would certainly contribute to rapid\n\ngrowth for the city of Minneapolis.\n\nIn later years, however, one thing may have. pleased these men above\n\nall elsethe Minneapolis Union Railway Company became an\n\nincredible financial success. Although the Union Railway\n\nCompany owned no rolling stock and operated no trainsand\n\nwhile the total mileage of the company's track amounted to less\n\nthan two-and-one-half miles (stretching from present-day\n\n\"Dinkytown\" to the Hennepin Avenue terminal site)the Union\n\nRailway Company became one of the bluest of blue-chip railroad\n\ninvestments. In 1887, the company paid a whopping 38 percent\n\ndividend on its stock. The following year it paid 10 percent,\n\nDuring the next three years, the stock yielded 15 percenteach\n\nyear. (12)\n\nBy 1910, rail passenger service to Minneapolis had outgrown the\n\noriginal Union Depot and the facility was bursting at the seams.\n\nA much larger terminal was needed, but the Minneapolis\n\nUnion Railway Company, the builder of the original facility, had\n\ndis-incorporated three years earlier. Jim Hill's Great Northern\n\nRailway Company (formerly the Manitoba Road) had absorbed\n\nthe property of the Union Railway Company, including the\n\nbridge and depot. The Great Northern had become a\n\nphenomenally successful enterprise with tracks stretching from\n\nthe plains of the Midwest to the cliffs of the\n\nPacific coast. Hill's company agreed to provide funds for a new\n\ndowntown rail terminal, but this terminal was to be utterly unlike\n\nthe original. The first Union Depot was plain and utilitarian.\n\nThe second was to be ornate and grand.\n\nLofty ceilings, ornate chandeliers, huge crystal windows, polished\n\nbrass doorknobs and handrails, gigantic murals of Blackfoot and\n\nKootenai Indian powwows, and ticket and baggage agents dressed\n\nin immaculately pressed uniformsthis was the type of\n\nfacility Jim Hill wanted for his Great Northern Railway. And this\n\nis exactly what he built. Completed in 1914, the Great Northern\n\nDepot was a veritable palace. The cost of the project exceeded\n\n$1,800,000, but few complaints were heard. When visiting Minneapolis,\n\nthe Stone Arch Bridge and the Great Northern Depot were very often\n\nthe first glimpses visitors had of the city. They were invariably\n\nimpressed.\n\nConclusion\n\nDuring the heyday of rail passenger service, hundreds of\n\nthousands of travelers passed over Jim Hill's Stone Arch Bridge each\n\nyear on their way into, or out of, the city of Minneapolis. A time\n\nschedule from May 1948 shows 82 passenger trains, representing\n\nnearly a dozen rail lines, leaving the Great Northern Depot every\n\nday. Yet, by 1978 the number of departures had been reduced to\n\njust four. Those remaining trains were operated by a single rail\n\ncarrierAmtrak.\n\nHard times had fallen on the Great Northern Depot. The long\n\nwooden benches, once jammed with hundreds of waiting\n\ntravelers, now stood empty. The elegant chandeliers were gone and a false\n\nceiling hid the depot's once-ornate, now-crumbling roof. The\n\nwalls of the waiting room were painted a dingy green, and the\n\nhuge windows were coated with years of grime. Receipts from\n\nticket sales simply did nor justify the expense involved in maintaining\n\nthe once-grand structure. On March 1, 1978, the last passenger\n\ntrain to cross the Stone Arch Bridge rumbled into the Great\n\nNorthern Depot, dropping off the very last load of rail passengers\n\never to arrive in downtown Minneapolis. A grand age had\n\ncome to an end. Within months, the Great Northern Depot fell to\n\nthe wrecking ball, and the Stone Arch Bridge, itself surrounded by\n\ncrumbling, abandoned flour mills, fell into obscurity.\n\nWhen this bridge was completed in 1883, the Minneapolis Tribune\n\nhad made a rather extraordinary prediction concerning the\n\nstructure. \"It is constructed to stand the rest of time,\" said the Tribune,\n\n\"until the golden age shall arrive when the problem of aerial\n\nnavigation shall have been solved, and the railroads and railroad\n\nbridges will be useless works of engineering\" (Nov. 23, 1883).\n\nAfter the closing of the Great Northern Depot in downtown\n\nMinneapolis, the few trains still serving the Minneapolis/St. Paul\n\narea made their stops at the new Amtrak Depot in St. Paul's\n\nMidway area. The site was chosen, in part, because of its proximity\n\nto the Minneapolis/St. Paul airport.\n\n****************************************************\n\nWhen the last train pulled out of the Great Northern Depot in\n\n1978, the riverfront area surrounding the depot was littered\n\nwith abandoned mills, factories and warehouses. Today, this\n\nportion of the city is undergoing a miraculous transformation.\n\nWithin the past ten years, Riverplace and St. Anthony Main\n\nhave been constructed, Nicollet Island has been rehabilitated, and\n\nmodern hotels have sprouted amidst old mill ruins. The Stone\n\nArch Bridge has mutely witnessed these changes. City officials hope\n\nto acquire the bridge for use as a pedestrian walkway, and if all goes\n\nwell, our great-great-grandchildren may one day stroll across the\n\nMississippi River on Jim Hill's monument to the railroad age."
