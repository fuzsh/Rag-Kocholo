(But) as far as I can tell, I don’t know there’s a darned thing we can do about it.”\n\nEngineers faced such challenges in designing the $190 million project to replace the aging U.S. 52 bridge that there might not be any other way, Lantry conceded.\n\nLast week, the city council signed off on the Minnesota Department of Transportation’s near-final designs. Rough construction schedules call for much of the work to take place between next year and 2014. Traffic always will be able to cross the river, either on existing spans or new ones.\n\nWith aircraft height restrictions overhead, watercraft clearances below and little real estate to work with as U.S. 52 approaches Interstate 94 and East Seventh Street east of downtown, engineers and architects had only 13 feet of vertical distance to construct the bridge.\n\nThe result is an utterly utilitarian design, with no sweeping arches or soaring spires. The only question remaining is whether it will be concrete or steel.\n\nWhen it came to figuring out how to connect the bridge with streets and highways north of the river, however, engineers drew up 22 variations, some stretching as far north as East Eighth Street.\n\nIn a traffic engineer’s perfect world, the project would have examined completely rebuilding the interchanges between not just U.S. 52 and I-94, but also feeder ramps to I-35E and exits to downtown.\n\n“To really improve the north end of the Lafayette Bridge, you would have to alter 94 and 35E, and where do you stop?” said Wayne Norris, MnDOT’s north area manager. “This is a bridge replacement.”\n\nStructurally speaking, the 42-year-old Lafayette Bridge is in worse shape than the Minneapolis I-35W bridge was before it collapsed in 2007. Like that bridge, the Lafayette is classified as “fracture-critical,” meaning if certain key parts of the bridge fail, the entire thing could collapse. Today’s bridges are designed with a level of redundancy so that can’t happen.\n\nOfficials said the Lafayette is in no danger of immediate collapse, but replacing it is a top MnDOT priority — and addressing the larger traffic picture of I-94 and I-35E isn’t part of that plan. Nonetheless, engineers did put a priority on addressing a few current safety issues.\n\nToday, the bridge empties straight into Seventh Street at a four-way intersection. In addition to creating large backups in rush hour, the layout has led to a notorious pattern of crashes into Red’s Savoy Pizza restaurant, which faces the intersection.\n\nAnd traffic from U.S. 52 to westbound I-94 is forced to make an unusually tight curl between Seventh and the interstate.\n\nFinancially and politically wary of condemning much land to address these problems, engineers, following a community feedback process, selected a final design with wider loops that go beneath roads rather than between them.\n\nWhile traffic will get on 52 from Seventh at the same spot it does today, traffic getting off 52 onto East Seventh will actually end up east of Red’s Savoy — facing south.\n\n“Where there is one really busy intersection today, we’ve split that intersection up into two intersections,” Norris said. Engineers maintain their final selection is safer and smoother for traffic than today’s cramped layout. But Lantry said the changes are so dramatic and different from what generations of drivers are accustomed to that it could spell trouble.\n\n“People are going to be so turned around,” she said at last week’s council meeting. “They’re going to be going north to go south and west to go east and they’re going to come out at the corner of Kittson and Seventh Street, where they never thought they would be.”\n\nCarol Carey, who chairs the lower Phalen Creek Project, said a straight connection to Seventh would cost less and be less confusing. It would also be less ugly, she said.\n\n“After leaving the bridge, users will travel past a salt shed, under three bridges, along a set of railroad tracks — and as they wind up on Seventh Street, they will have a 360-degree view of a pawnshop,” she wrote in a letter to the city. “This is the ‘gateway’ to our communities created by the alignment.”\n\nSt. Paul City Engineer John Maczko assured the city council that the new interchange would be clearly marked — and well-landscaped. “I think people will be pleasantly surprised,” he said. “And I think it’ll be pretty obvious where to go.”\n\nTake A Test Drive\n\nFollow MnDOT’s 3D drive-through simulation of the U.S. 52-Interstate-94-East Seventh Street interchange at TwinCities.com.\n\nOriginally Published: June 19, 2010 at 11:01 p.m."
