Mystery tour of the British workina class

Raining Stones (M). At Electric

Shadows in the Boulevard Twin.

COMPARED with film-maker

Ken Loach, the generation

that came to be known as

the angry young men are but a col

lection of pussycats.

Yet, while Loach's observations

of contemporary British working

class life are much more savage and

acerbic, they are also furiously

comic, seeing the normal behaviour

of their characters for what it is,

funny in adversity.

Raining Stones begins on a fog

covered moorland as two men run

after a flock of sheep. They are

Bob (Bruce Jones) and Tommy

(Ricky Tomlinson). They want to

catch a sheep to flog to a butcher

for a few quid.

The driving force is Bob's con

frontation with adversity. His

seven-year-old daughter is about to

take communion for the first time

and needs more than £100 worth of

clothes for the occasion. Well, not

in need, but Bob is determined that

she is going to church that day

dressed for the occasion.

The film is about how Bob raises

the cash. It's a series of debacles as

Bob tries to break through the

glass ceiling that presses down on

people of his class, place and time.

His job-seeking takes us through

drain cleaning, bouncing at a disco,

labouring for a landscape gardener.

His van is stolen and he borrows

the money for another without tell

ing Anne (Julie Brown). This black

ens his life wfoen the lender factors

the loan to a hard man who threat

ens Anne and the child when Bob

defaults on a payment.

Here is not only the basis of

sonic wonderful comedy but a vig

orous statement about the condition

of the working class in Britain.

Using a non-professional cast of

mostly working-class folk. Loach

works from a story outline rather

than a detailed shooting script,

sending the players into the world

and filming them unobtrusively so

that the people in the street or the

market square become extras with

out being aware of it. His interiors

are shot in real locations, not in

sets where walls can be opened out

and lighting controlled.

The result is impressive in its

realism. Writer Jim Allen is well

qualified to write working-class dra

ma — as a miner, he was once

black-listed from every pit in Lan

cashire; his stint as a staff writer

for Coronation Street ended when

at a story conference he suggested

sending the whole cast on a mys

tery tour and driving the coach

over a cliff. The film's Manchester

locations are where Allen lived.

Loach says that, politically, films

have very little impact. He bemoans

that that has been the case with his

TV films about miners. Yet 1 feel

w

lie is too pessimistic. His films, by

combining political statements forci

bly made with a deep sense of

understanding of characters anil a

wonderful sensitivity for comedy.'

cannot but increase public aware

ness of social issues, particularly

unemployment, in a way that- TV

news and documentary doesn't

achieve with the same level of con

viction.

What is important about Raining

Stones is not that Bob comes out in

front at the end, with his daughter

dressed for church as he wishes, his

problem with the loan shark re:

solved in a grim manner that allows

Loach to spend time examining

how the Church is dealing with

current social and moral problems,

his' van located by the police who

seem all unconcerned that it isn't

registered.

Loach's depiction of Bob's pro

gress to those points is wonderfully

aware of all the possibilities of the

story, put on the screen with a col

lection of economical film-making

skills that manifests in every frame

the devotion of the film-maker and

nis leam.
