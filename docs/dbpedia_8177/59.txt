When you’re a worker, it rains stones seven days a week.

Set in North England, Ken Loach’s persuasive tragicomic Raining Stones, from Jim Allen’s original script, opens with a wide-angle shot of a gorgeous misty country landscape at dawn—a moment of quiet and serenity, which the second shot explodes. Two men are scrambling to catch and steal a sheep, which they transport back to town and have butchered, selling cuts of it to ease financial stress. Bob and Tommy, both out of work, live on the dole. They are devoted to their families and each other. Bob needs money to pay for a First Communion outfit for his daughter, Coleen. He therefore takes out a loan where he can. He falls behind in payments; the thugs who have assumed the debt break into his home to collect. Bob’s perpetual anxiety reflects the emotional predicament of countless lower-class people.

This very funny film is nonetheless most memorable for its poignant moments. In one, lying that she has a conventional job when in fact she is working for a drug dealer, his daughter gives Tommy some money “for a beer” (“She can afford it now,” Tommy’s wife explains), and Tommy struggles to suppress his humiliation. When wife and daughter leave to go shopping, the bespectacled man dissolves privately into tears.

Bob is the main character, though. His van has been stolen—a situation that seems to epitomize his lot. Irish Catholic Bob’s first stop after taking a wrench to his antagonist (after the latter has violated the sanctity of his home and terrorized his wife) is the local priest, who convincingly acts as a priest ought to act.

Charming, delightful: Bob’s attempt to explain the dogma of transubstantiation to little Coleen. That is a tough one.
