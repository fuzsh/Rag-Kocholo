        "text": "Ben Davis ended Center Grove’s unprecedented three-year run as Class 6A state champions (6A was added in 2013) with a dramatic run through the tournament that ended with an anti-climatic 28-point win over Crown Point.\n\nCan Ben Davis do it again? Or is there another contender out there? Perhaps Center Grove climbs back to the top. Warren Central looks loaded for a run. Or maybe Brownsburg can break through and knock off the Giants in the sectional. There are contenders below from the north half of the bracket, too, including Westfield, Carmel and Hamilton Southeastern.\n\nIndiana Mr. Football: What do trends tell us about favorites going into 2024 season?\n\nIHSAA football preview: Class 5A predictions, top players in Central Indiana\n\nA closer look at the local teams in 6A:\n\n(In order of projected finish; records from 2023)\n\nSectional 3\n\nWestfield (11-2): The Shamrocks were a relatively young team a year ago that was on the doorstep of a third state finals appearance in four years before falling to Crown Point, 38-31 in double overtime, on the road in semistate. The biggest difference from a year ago is a change at the top with coach Jake Gilbert making the move to coach at Wabash and former assistant Josh Miracle taking his place. The offensive has a bona fide playmaker in senior receiver and Ball State commit Gabe Aramboles (41 catches, 583 yards, six TDs) and an offensive line that should be a position of strength, led by senior tackle and Cornell recruit Avery Huggins. Senior Carsen Melvin does not have much game experience since his freshman season as quarterback at Plainfield, but the 6-3, 185-pounder is a Bowling Green recruit with a lot of talent. The defense will be led by senior linebacker and Ball State commit Mikeah Webster (152 tackles, 11 tackles for loss, two fumble recoveries). Senior safety Drew Law (70 tackles, two interceptions) is expected to be a leader in the secondary. Junior free safety Deacon King (70 tackles) and junior defensive end Alex Aramboles (66 tackles, 9 ½ tackles for loss, four sacks) are among the other returners on a defense that should be improved. Senior Cruz Williams, a talented senior linebacker, also returns from injury. Westfield is looking for its fifth consecutive sectional title.\n\nCarmel (5-5): The Greyhounds took some lumps last year with a young team, but coach John Hebert goes into his 10th season with a deep group that should benefit from experience. Included in that group is junior quarterback Anthony Coellner (56.1% passer, 937 yards, eight touchdowns; 298 rushing yards, two TDs), who has multiple Division I offers. Receiver looks like a position of strength with juniors Jake Bellin and Dominic Shockley and seniors Liam Mann (Toledo offer) and Nate Williams leading the way. Indiana recruit Evan Parker anchors the offensive line at tackle and senior Ozzy Pollard (several FBS offers) should see time at tackle and tight end. Senior Collin Johnson (424 yards, two TDs) was Carmel’s top rusher last year. The defense has a lot of experience, too, with senior outside linebacker/safety Jimmie Winbush Jr. (82 tackles, four tackles for loss), senior safeties Drew Cannon (56 tackles, two interceptions) and Carter Grayson (46 tackles, two caused fumbles in six games), junior linebacker Will Massey (36 tackles, five tackles for loss), senior cornerback Jabril Randolph (27 tackles) and Troy commit and senior end Uchenyo Ojata (26 tackles, two tackles for loss) among those returning. Pollard, junior Kaiden Bower and sophomore Emmanuel Griffin III will anchor the defensive line. Carmel is looking for its first sectional title since 2020.\n\nIHSAA football preview: Everything you need to know for 2024 season\n\nZionsville (3-7): Since making runs to the Class 5A state finals in 2020 and ’21, the Eagles moved up to 6A and have been bounced in the first round of the sectional by Noblesville each of the past two seasons. Coach Scott Turnquist goes into his sixth season with a strong senior class that has one of the most talented receivers in the state in senior receiver and Wisconsin commit Eugene Hilton (46 catches, 836 yards, 10 TDs). Others expected to key the offense will be senior receiver Nolan Teising (five catches, 47 yards in five games), junior tight end Isaac Tuffnell, senior lineman Deiter Hartwig, sophomore running back Sam Manna (392 rushing yards, one TD), senior linemen Brayden Sipes and Bennett Bowers, junior lineman Gabe Anderson and sophomore lineman Ben Maxey. Army commit Max Phenicie (58 tackles) is a senior safety who will anchor the defense and likely will be joined at safety by his younger brother Hank Phenicie, a junior. Other key players on defense will be senior defensive end Darrius Eleazard, senior tackles Prab Singh (36 tackles) and Alex Moore (20 tackles), senior lineman Alex Tate, senior linebacker Chase Wilson (22 tackles in seven games), senior linebacker Zach Cook (61 tackles in eight games), junior outside linebacker Brody Aeschliman, senior safety Brady Peterson (22 tackles) and junior cornerback Bryce Meyer.\n\nHarrison (9-2): Harrison has been a consistently strong program under coach Terry Peebles, winning sectional championships in 2018 and ’19. The Raiders now make the significant jump from 5A to 6A for the first time, a move Zionsville made two years ago.\n\nSectional 4\n\nHamilton Southeastern (9-3): This is a bit of a reboot for fifth-year coach Michael Kelly, whose program is coming off a regional title in 2022 and sectional title in 2023 with a combined record of 21-4 in those two seasons. Just three starters return on offense and two on defense, though there is some serious talent on the roster, led by senior offensive tackle and Purdue commit Cameron Gorin and senior cornerback and Pitt commit Mason Alexander (39 tackles, three interceptions). Joining Gorin as projected standouts on offense are senior quarterback Chandler Weston (58.6% completions, 1,415 passing yards, 18 TDs; 295 rushing yards, four TDs), senior running back AZ Wallace (595 rushing yards, nine TDs), senior receiver Dylan James (six receptions, 110 yards, two TDs), junior lineman Corbin Mullis, senior receiver Liam Boyd (11 catches, 105 yards) and senior receiver Callen Okerson. In addition to Alexander, HSE’s defense will be led by junior safety Kian Kelly, senior safety Braeden Totton, junior Matthew Ruiz, junior lineman Alex Jenkins, junior end Austin Dombrow, senior Evan Lawhead and senior linebacker Cole Schechter. HSE has never won three consecutive sectional titles.\n\nFishers (7-4): Coach Curt Funk goes into his fifth season at Fishers with a program that has showed steady improvement but has no hardware to show for it after losing for the third consecutive year to rival Hamilton Southeastern in the sectional. There will be quite a bit of turnover this year with key offensive players like running Khobie Martin (1,379 yards, 19 TDs last season) and quarterback Bennett Gorak (1,785 passing yards, 15 TDs) gone to graduation, along with five of the top seven tacklers on defense. There are four new starters along the offensive line, a group anchored by senior left tackle Chuck Slain. There is talent, though, especially if the Tigers can find ways to get senior receiver and Stanford commit JonAnthony Hall (69 catches, 1,055 yards, six TDs) the ball. Junior Ryan Thembulembu (283 rushing yards; three catches, 30 yards) will also be a key playmaker as junior Gage Sturgill (27-for-49 passing for 344 yards and three TDs in three games) will slide into the starting quarterback role. Expected to lead on defense will be senior outside linebacker/defensive end Jev Hutton (51 tackles, seven tackles for loss), senior safety Owen Folta (45 tackles), junior defensive end Tyler Maynard (33 tackles, five for loss), junior cornerback Carsen Eloms and senior cornerback Tristan Johnson. Fishers’ last sectional championship was in 2017.\n\nNoblesville (4-7): The Millers have been a more competitive program the past two years for fifth-year coach Dave Sharpe but have not enjoyed that breakthrough season just yet. Sharpe put an emphasis on leadership education and team bonding in the offseason to create a better team culture, while maintaining the identity of the offense and defense. The Millers were just 1-4 last year in games decided by a touchdown or less. Senior Max Miller will move to quarterback after playing tight end last year (seven catches for 130 yards). Miller will have two three-year starters in front of him on the offensive line in seniors Michael Bennett and Merek Helvey and a standout senior tight end/receiver in Bowling Green commit Aiden Brewer (22 catches, 399 yards, two TDs). Senior Indy Wilhelm, a starter at tackle last year, will move to tight end. The defense will be led by senior end/linebacker Israel Oladipupo (75 tackles, 6 ½ tackles for loss), a Boston College commit, along with senior linebacker Corbin Hornickel (68 tackles, six tackles for loss) and senior linemen Jrue Kante (41 tackles) and Adam Mhedbhi (37 tackles, six tackles for loss). If Noblesville can turn some of those closes losses into wins, the program’s first winning season since 2001 is a possibility.\n\nHomestead (5-5): This is a tough sectional draw for Homestead, which lost by 28 points to Fishers in the sectional last year and by 35 points to Hamilton Southeastern two years ago.\n\nSectional 5\n\nBen Davis (13-1): The Giants navigated a tight rope with narrow wins over Brownsburg (28-25 in the sectional), Cathedral (27-24 in the regional) and Center Grove (37-34 in overtime in the semistate) on the way to demolishing Crown Point 38-10 to win the Class 6A state championship — the 10th in program history. Second-year coach Russ Mann has a lot of talent returning on both sides of the ball. The offense brings back senior running backs Alijah Price (1,000 rushing yards, 12 TDs; 31 catches, 282 yards, four TDs) and Isaac White (312 yards, three TDs), senior receiver/defensive back Mark Zackery IV (53 catches, 823 yards, eight TDs), junior receiver Jeivyair Horton (19 catches, 264 yards, two TDs), senior receivers Malik Williams (11 catches, 117 yards, three TDs) and Anthony Stapleton Jr. (12 catches, 105 yards, one TD in six games). Senior quarterback Isaiah Rogers (41-for-81 for 514 yards and four TDs) enters as the starting quarterback. Key linemen include seniors Kenny Guinhouya and Dereon Sanders. The defense was hit hard by graduation, but does return senior defensive lineman and Illinois commit Isaiah White (69 tackles, 11 ½ tackles for loss, 7 ½ sacks), senior defensive end Frank Bertram (39 tackles, 6 ½ sacks) and senior defensive back DeShon Horner (28 tackles, one fumble recovery) among its key players.\n\nMore: New Ben Davis offensive coordinator Tyler Campbell brings 'Air Raid' attack to Giants\n\nBrownsburg (9-1): Brownsburg was on the brink of knocking off Ben Davis going into the fourth quarter of last year’s sectional but could not shut the door and let an 18-point lead get away in a 28-25 loss. It was a tough finish to a season that probably exceeded expectations from the outside. The Bulldogs will be a different offensive team without 2,000-yard rusher Garrett Sherrell, but the offensive line has promise with junior Ricky Ortiz and senior Justin Hamm returning as starters and juniors Mezziahs McDaniel and Tabarak Lawal and sophomore Nick Vecrumba expected to start. Quarterback is a question mark, though coach John Hart has a couple of good options in senior Iosua Stephens (127 passing yards, one TD in four games) and sophomore Oscar Frye (74 passing yards, one TD in four games). Junior running back A.J. Jobe (216 rushing yards, three TDs) is the team’s top returning rusher. Junior Avin Robinson (4 catches, 53 yards in five games) and sophomore Branden Sharpe are promising receivers. The defense is the side of the ball with more experience. The defensive line is a strength with seniors Mason Keifer (37 tackles, seven tackles for loss, two sacks), Jackson Sarjent (27 tackles) and Colin Kelly (27 tackles, 4 ½ tackles for loss) coming back. Senior linebackers Hunter Childs (41 tackles, 6 ½ tackles for loss, three sacks) and Alex Burke (51 tackles, six tackles for loss), senior safety Davin Pearson (35 tackles), senior cornerback Chance Whitfield (27 tackles), senior Quentin Russ Jr. (15 tackles) and senior safety Jamere Pendleton will be among the names to watch.\n\nAvon (2-8): The Orioles played some close games but started Rob Gibson’s first season as coach at 0-7 before knocking off Zionsville and Noblesville, then losing by a point in overtime to Pike in the first round of the sectional. This team is a year older and a year stronger. The success on offense will start up front with junior linemen Will Johnson and Mike Kahari and senior lineman Grant Stewart. The skill positions should be a strength with junior running back Ashton Carter (283 rushing yards, two TDs), junior receivers Shawn Curry Jr. (26 catches, 477 yards, five TDs) and T.J. Stewart (25 catches, 357 yards in seven games) and junior tight end Kaven Tislow. Junior lefty Jace Cameron is projected as the starting quarterback. Jamir Bouie, a transfer from Plainfield, should also be a target at receiver (40 catches, 415 yards, five TDs last season). The defense should also be improved, led by senior defensive end and Minnesota commit Enoch Atewogbola (17 tackles, one sack), senior lineman and Northern Illinois commit Fawzy Omotoso (27 tackles, 4 ½ tackles for loss), sophomore linebacker Makyi Hines (64 tackles) and senior defensive backs Brodey Gray (57 tackles, two tackles for loss, one interception) and Jeshua Miller.\n\nPike (3-8): The Red Devils improved by two wins in Mike Brevard’s second season as coach. He is optimistic going into this season with a talented junior class that took some lumps last season. The offense will be led by senior quarterback Dohnavin Ward (471 passing yards, four TDs in seven games), senior running back Chase Shurn (191 yards in five games), sophomore running back Bobby Thomas, senior running back Dashaun Leavelle (142 rushing yards in seven games), junior receiver Sean Nash (13 catches, 182 yards, two TDs), senior receiver/tight end Pierce Collins, junior tackle/tight end Muna Newman-Nwodika and senior tackle Keon’dre Ervin. The defense brings back a lot of talent, including senior defensive end Ife Adeoba (54 tackles, 19 tackles for loss, 11 sacks), junior outside linebacker/strong safety Dammy Adeoba (50 solo tackles, two sacks, one interception), junior linebacker Zayne Davis, senior safety Dejuan Elliott (16 tackles, one interception in four games), senior cornerback Dyreese Elliott (29 tackles), senior safety Elijah Meriweather and senior cornerback Julian Ward (28 tackles, one interception).\n\nSectional 6\n\nLawrence North (7-4): The Wildcats have momentum going into Pat Mallory’s 12th season. The Wildcats bring back a lot of top-end talent led by Indiana recruit and senior wide receiver Davion Chandler (40 catches, 779 yards, 13 TDs) and sophomore running back Izayveon Moore (1,127 rushing yards, nine TDs; four catches, 51 yards, one TD). Also leading the offense will be senior quarterback Tanner Aspeslet (831 passing yards, eight TDs; 208 rushing yards), sophomore receiver Monshun Sales (offers from Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisville, Michigan State, Ole Miss, Purdue, Tennessee and more), senior receiver Damario Moore (18 catches, 312 yards, one TD) and senior H-back Cale Mallory. The defense has plenty of talent returning, too, with senior linebacker Caleb Beeler (88 tackles, 13 tackles for loss, four sacks) junior linebacker Breck Mallory (11 tackles), linemen Anthony Ludington (56 tackles, 14 tackles for loss, 10 sacks), Marcus Jackson (38 tackles, nine tackles for loss) and Phil Allen (50 tackles, nine tackles for loss, four sacks) and senior defensive backs Jerome Smith (39 tackles, two interceptions), Kale Burnett (10 tackles) and Jevonte Wilson (17 tackles).\n\nCathedral (8-4): It is a new era for the Irish, who were last seen battling eventual state champion Ben Davis to a 27-24 loss in the regional in November. Quarterback Danny O’Neil is now batting for the starting job at San Diego State, which means there will be a new starter at that key spot for the first time in three years in junior Cameron Koers. He will be surrounded by talent offensive players in senior running back Jalen Bonds (1,194 rushing yards, eight TDs), senior receivers Devaughn Slaughter (53 catches, 373 yards, seven TDs) and Albren Johnson (20 catches, 372 yards, seven TDs) and junior receiver Jackson Harvey. The offensive line should be a strength with senior Eli Gigerich and sophomore Phil Brown at tackle, senior Manny Egan and junior Kaiden Martin at tackle and senior Nicky Neale at center. Senior Alston McDaniel is a big target at tight end. The defensive will be led by senior safety Jack Lockhart (53 tackles, one caused fumble), senior cornerback Aden Chase (16 tackles, two interceptions) and junior cornerback Zion Hill, senior outside linebacker Charlie McCormick and junior outside linebacker Alex Couch, junior linebackers Gannon Knowles and Kyle Harden (50 tackles, 5 ½ tackles for loss, four sacks) and Michael Pugh, senior defensive ends Jack Gause and Aden Hughes (22 tackles) and junior defensive tackle Aiden Flournoy.\n\nLawrence Central (4-6): The Bears did not have the breakthrough season in 2023 that coach Will Patterson was hoping for, though the program is certainly on more solid ground now than it was when he started in 2020. Patterson believes this team of “football junkies” is equipped to have success into November. The offense will be triggered by junior quarterback Terry Walker III (749 passing yards, five TDs; 94 rushing yards, one TD last year in five games), who will have talented players around him in senior tight end and Wisconsin commit Nizyi Davis (29 catches, 410 yards, one TD in eight games), junior running backs Caron Parks (577 rushing yards, three TDs; seven catches, 106 yards) and Albert Gooden III (691 rushing yards, seven TDs; nine catches, 109 yards, one TD) and senior receiver Jack Jordan (13 catches, 166 yards, four TDs in seven games). The offensive line is led by junior James Williams (Miami of Ohio offer) and senior Sean Casteal Jr. (NAIA offers). The defensive line should be a strength with seniors Robert Beasley (50 tackles, nine tackles for loss, 4 ½ sacks), Bryan Robertson (42 tackles, 11 tackles for loss, three sacks) and Gian Carter (29 tackles, 6 ½ tackles for loss, three sacks) all claiming FBS or FCS offers. The linebacker crew will include Steve Fox, Sean Fox and Gooden and senior Jaylen Lowrance returns in the secondary.\n\nNorth Central (0-10): Second-year coach Derek Hart still has a young team but believes this will be an improved group. The offense will be led by senior quarterback Caleb Foor, senior wide receiver Eli Thompson, sophomore receiver Demetrius Averitte and junior left tackle Sam Dutkanych. The defense will be led by senior defensive backs Sherman Wills and Bacari Fields, senior outside linebacker Cion Waters and senior lineman Solomon Massela. The Panthers are just 1-29 since a run of three consecutive winning seasons from 2018-2020.\n\nSectional 7\n\nWarren Central (5-7): The Warriors have a chance to be a breakout team going into coach Mike Kirschner’s fourth season. There is major talent along the defensive line with senior end and LSU commit Damien Shanklin (66 tackles, 17 tackles for loss, three sacks) a contender for Mr. Football. He will be bookended by senior Louisville recruit Tyrone Burrus (36 tackles, 15 tackles for loss, six sacks) with Marcus Bell (27 tackles, five sacks) Jerimy Finch Jr. (41 tackles, 14 tackles for loss, three sacks) and senior Jevon Guess making this one of the best position groups in the state. Returning starters at linebacker are Donovan Dungy (53 tackles, three sacks), DaVonte Dungy (56 tackles and Jordyn Barlow (39 tackles, three interceptions). Seniors Aaron Durham (22 tackles) and Armonte Jackson (13 tackles) return in the secondary. Senior Keith Jackson (326 rushing yards, three TDs) moved from quarterback to receiver and defensive back and will provide speed and experience. At quarterback, junior Jaydin Rivers is a transfer from Hammond Bishop Noll and sophomore Anthony Dennison (617 passing yards, four TDs in eight games) got experience last season when Jackson was injured. Seniors Jaylan McMoore (926 rushing yards, eight TDs) and James Clark (559 yards, four TDs) return at running back and seniors Chazz Corley (23 catches, 405 yards, one TD) and Airic Hester (21 catches, 215 yards, two TDs) at receiver. Iowa commit Cam Herron anchors the offensive line and Sean Ketchum is also a returning starter.\n\nPerry Meridian (2-8): The Falcons were a better team in 2023 than the final record showed due to an 0-5 record in games decided by a touchdown or less. Coach Brett Cooper enters his fifth season as coach looking for his program to make strides and start winning those close games. With 18 starters returning, it certainly appears to be a possibility. One of the top players on both sides of the ball will be senior linebacker and St. Francis commit Andy Warren (118 tackles), who was also the team’s leading rusher last season with 507 yards and 10 TDs. Senior Allen Zupan (1,281 passing yards, eight TDs) is a three-year starter at quarterback and will have one of his top target returning in senior Byron Hon at receiver (40 catches, 691 yards, six TDs). Senior Jonathan Hunter (250 rushing yards, two TDs in seven games) should carry the load at running back. In addition to Warren, the defense has senior safety Isaac Williams (71 tackles, two caused fumbles), senior cornerback Hon (42 tackles, one interception) and junior linebackers Zach Clary and Carson Stringer.\n\nINSIDER: It's been 20 years since Perry Meridian had a winner. These seniors want to quiet the haters.\n\nSouthport (2-9): Coach Alex Bettag enters his fourth season with possibly his best team with a good mix of experience and young talent. Junior running back Jeremiah Stanovic (619 rushing yards, five TDs) was the team’s leading rusher last season and senior and St. Francis commit Nilyn Compton (16 catches, 221 yards, two TDs) will again be one of the team’s top playmakers. Junior Riley Matlock (341 rushing yards, three TDs) and senior Braylon Koenig are also two players expected to be leaders on offense, along with junior quarterback Gavin Cummins (728 passing yards, four TDs) and senior lineman Cooper Gannon. There is a lot of experience returning on defense with senior linebacker Fabian Tapscott (107 tackles, 12 tackles for loss, two interceptions) senior cornerback Ricky Sanders (43 tackles), senior cornerback Malachi Kennedy (57 tackles, two interceptions) and Stanovic (29 tackles) coming back. James Kalala, a 6-7 junior standout on the basketball team, should be a playmaker for the football Cardinals.\n\nTech (0-10): Jerdson Gamble goes into his second season as coach with a team he expects to be improved with numbers and expectations on the rise. Senior Damon Hooks is projected as the starting quarterback after playing a little bit of quarterback, receiver and defensive back last season. Junior running back Mike Price and junior lineman Kyle Kendall are also expected to be leaders on offense. Among the top players on defense will be Gavin Porter and Elijah Thomas. The schedule should allow the Titans to have a better chance for success this season.\n\nSectional 8\n\nCenter Grove (11-2): Center Grove saw its three-year state championship run end with a 37-34 overtime loss at Ben Davis in the semistate. Coach Eric Moore goes into his 26th season with Center Grove needing just three wins to reach 250 with the Trojans. This will be one of his youngest and most inexperienced teams in recent years and already junior defensive end standout Kobe Cherry (70 tackles, six tackles for loss) is on the shelf for the season with a knee injury. Senior quarterback Gabe McWilliams will take over and has a solid group of receivers, led by seniors Tristan Baxter (22 catches, 338 yards, two TDs) and Brevin Holubar (39 catches, 744 yards, six TDs) and sophomore slot back Drake McClurg (13 catches, 204 yards, two TDs). Junior tight end Dom Barry (eight catches, 120 yards, one TD in five games) and senior running back Austin Hennessy (360 rushing yards, three TDs) will be key offensive players. Others to watch are junior running back Nolan Rees, senior wingback Brady Dicken and linemen Brady Weber (junior), CJ Scifres (junior), Cam Peters (senior), Caden Grant (senior) and Joey Blanchard (senior). Only one of the team’s top seven tacklers on defense returns in senior tackle Ryder Woolwine (51 tackles, four sacks). Junior defensive end Lincoln Bright (45 tackles), senior strong safety Luke Barrett (34 tackles, six interceptions), senior cornerback Ben Tapak (37 tackles) and senior defensive end Augie Argbah (28 tackles) are among the most experienced players on defense. Players to watch at linebacker are Jack Browning, TJ Williams and Frank Hayes. The Trojans have 13 consecutive sectional titles.\n\nFranklin Central (4-6): Coach Jayson West goes into his fourth season with a team that appeared to be on the brink of its first winning season since 2017 before the Flashes dropped four consecutive games to end the season. Franklin Central will have one of the most experienced quarterbacks in Central Indiana in senior Nevan Tutterow (1,949 passing yards, 15 TDs). Others expected to be key contributors on offense are senior offensive lineman John Steinhofer, senior receivers Damir Swanigan (19 catches, 211 yards, two TDs) and Emauri Hines, junior receiver Hudson Moritz (10 catches, 79 yards), senior running back Avery Allen and junior running back Brody Middleton (287 rushing yards, one TD). The defense will be led by sophomore defensive end Jayce Brewer (offer from Toledo), junior linebacker Jose Butler (26 tackles 2 ½ tackles for loss), senior linebacker John Ragland, senior outside linebacker/strong safety Jeremy Cox (51 tackles), senior outside linebacker Steve Kiarie (72 tackles, 2 ½ sacks) and senior defensive tackle Jayden Hall. This is a talented group that should compete but is not especially deep.\n\nColumbus North (5-6): The Bull Dogs return junior quarterback Asher Ratliff (1,368 passing yards, 18 TDs; 549 rushing yards, seven TDs), along with their top rusher, three top receivers and most of the key members of the defense.\n\nJeffersonville (0-10): New coach Joe Washington has a lot of work ahead. The Red Devils have just one win over the past two seasons and have not had a winning season since 2015.\n\nCall Star reporter Kyle Neddenriep at (317) 444-6649."
