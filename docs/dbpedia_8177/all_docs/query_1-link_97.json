        "text": "This short essay, co-authored with L.O. Aranye Fradenburg, and filed under \"Paradigm Change/Institutional Change\" in the edited volume, ruminates the importance of the humanities as an important space for the artfulness of living, for enriched environments, and real-time experimental ecologies that donate valuable resources, not just for surviving, but thriving. The essay also urges a move, for the university, to the para-academic Outside, where it might help spawn a vibrant network of Outstitutions and a materialist Epicureanism for new and sustaining historical trajectories.\n\nThis paper reports on findings regarding one African community that has practiced rainmaking until the early 1960s. Rainmaking among Africans was recorded in 19 th century travel writing by imperialist Europeans such as Rider Haggard in his books Ayesha: the Return of She (1905) and King Solomon's Mines (1985). In keeping with the agenda of imperialism and colonisation, the art of rainmaking among Africans was reduced to writing in a distorted, Eurocentric manner. Therefore, an Afrocentric investigation of the religious-cultural practice of African communities to bring about rain is warranted. It is hoped that the resulting balanced view of African rainmaking rituals will, among others, discourage Eurocentric tendencies of seeing its exponents such as The Rain Queen Modjadji as inscrutable exotica. Rain Queen Modjadji has been immortalised with the same attitude regretted by writers such as Caitlin Davies (2003). Davies (2003) remarks how subaltern victims such as Sara Baartman and El Negro were removed to museums in places like Spain and London as curious exotica to be studied by the \" naturalists \" of the 1830s. Research into the disappearing phenomenon of rainmaking among Africans should preserve the indigenous knowledge as well as purge it of Eurocentric distortions. A sample of 10 informants was used, determined by the role categories historically known to have been a feature of rainmaking among the African community under the spotlight.\n\nFor as long as scholars have written about African rainmaking rites and beliefs they have noted the salience of gender and sexual symbolism in them. Yet they often find this puzzling, and turn instead to the social, political and economic aspects of rainmaking. This article, on the contrary, explores locally-inflected understandings of rainmaking amongst the Ihanzu of Tanzania. It is argued that Ihanzu rain rites—and by implication, rain rites in other parts of Africa—are replete with sexual symbolism, and become locally meaningful, because they are linked to broad understandings about reproductive processes. For the Ihanzu (re)production of any sort, including making babies and rain, demands the equal and complementary combination of the cultural categories “male” and “female”. This contrasts markedly with their everyday notions of gender which imply gender hierarchy and inequality. The article thus demonstrates how competing notions of gender and gender practices are operationalised in certain ritual and everyday settings. Above all else, like previous scholarship on African rain rites, this article highlights the sexual symbolism in them; however, it goes further by seeking to explore, in one particular ethnographic locale, the cultural salience of that symbolism and the reasons it takes the form it does.\n\nThe Hydrocene is the watery, disruptive, conceptual epoch that I name for the tide of art going into the blue in response to the climate crisis. In this short watery provocation and essay, I share the potential significance of 'misting' as a hydro-artistic method of reorientation from within fog, where fog becomes a portal towards embodied encounters in art practices. I look to the extensive fog-based work of Japanese artist Fujiko Nakaya alongside Australian artists Emily Parsons-Lord's misty installation Things fall apart (2017) and Janet Laurence's hazy site-specific public work In the Shadow (2000) as examples of misting. I relate the artists' pieces to theorist Ifor Duncan's concept of 'Occult Meteorology' and Janine Randerson's notion of 'Weather as Medium', and further propose misting as a hydro-artistic method in the Hydrocene. The potential of artistic relationality between misty bodies of water in contemporary eco-critical art practices opens up possibilities of engaging indeterminate watery futures."
