        "text": "Sports preludes and recaps are best told in a storybook-like fashion. You have the preseason, your beginning of the story. A season may climax with a championship or win against a big rival. The ending, well, that's a road to the state finals that everyone strives for.\n\nThe Marion County high school football season has its own set of storylines brewing. Coaching changes are signaling culture changes for several schools. It almost sounds like the beginning of a new Netflix series at times.\n\nWe're here to give you a preview of the guiding forces ahead of the 2024 high school football season. Let’s track how these storylines evolve over the grueling 10-week season.\n\nBelleview: A Trend in the Right Direction\n\nWith the Rattlers in the middle of an administration change, there's time to look at a trend. Over the last five seasons, Belleview football was led by four different coaches.\n\nThe current seniors, like all-county honorable mention running back Nick Mills, have played for three coaches in three varsity seasons. Three different systems. Three different positions. Three times forced to earn the trust of a new staff member, but this year is a little different.\n\nBelleview has a new coach in Josh Sigler, but he’s familiar with the roster after spending last season as an assistant. He saw the foundation that was laid last year; now it's time to see what's taking shape on the next level. Armed with a growing program, a few surprises, and a team that knows what he expects, Sigler has something the other coaches haven’t had: Continuity, and that could be the difference for a winless team returning most of its roster.\n\nWhere's your team this Friday?: High school football schedules for every Marion County team\n\nThe most athletics Rattlers?: Vote for who you would add to Belleview High sports' Mount Rushmore\n\nThe top Cats: Vote for who you would add to Forest High sports' Mount Rushmore\n\nDunnellon: A Class to Remember\n\nDunnellon has a chance to take the top spot in Marion County football. Few schools are bringing back the depth, talent and production the Tigers have on their roster.\n\nSix of their 13 all-county selections return for their junior or senior seasons. That's 2,516 total yards, 32 touchdowns, 210 tackles, three interceptions, 3.5 sacks, and five forced fumbles coming back, an estimated 35% of the total production from six players.\n\nSean Martin was the first of the 2025s to make a college decision and there are others with big decisions to make on where they'll play at the next level. Before that happens, they have an opportunity to do what Dunnellon hasn't done since the early 2000s: be the best team in the county with the record to prove it.\n\nForest: Competition\n\nForest's practice field is a battleground for competition. The Wildcats are young this year but have talent at every major position.\n\nThe quarterback battle has young, dynamic arms, featuring sophomore Vanguard transfer Grayson Yancey and \"lightning in a bottle\" freshman Armani McFarland, preparing to lead Forest's potent offensive scheme. The running back room has Division I talent in Jordan Strickland, who is currently injured, leaving room for up-and-comers Jamarian Whitter and Kez Rivers to fight for more reps with the first team. The tight end room is the epitome of the cutthroat with three athletes 6-foot-3 or taller, including senior Wesley Dinkins, who earned an offer to Indiana Wesleyan over the summer.\n\nThe Wildcats are living by the saying iron sharpens iron. Every snap, every rep there's a talented player is standing behind. That's the perfect environment to cultivate players who are ready to compete on game day.\n\nLake Weir: Defending the Throne\n\nThe newly expanded Sunshine State Athletic Association is sure to make the chase for a state title tougher than last season's 12-team spread. As the pool depends, the new fish will realize that going through Lake Weir is the only way to become the big fish.\n\nIn the Hurricanes' first season in the FHSAA-alternate league, they pushed themselves to the top of the food chain, becoming the hunted in 2024. Every week, they'll get their opponent's best, knowing this is their chance to stack up with the crowned champion.\n\nThe question for Lake Weir: Is it ready for the pressure? With several returning starters and battle-tested individuals in every class, they have the DNA of a winner. Head coach Jason Roberts' approach and military background will make it hard for his team to stray from the course. We'll see how they stand during their first test on Aug. 16 vs. Bronson.\n\nNorth Marion: First-time head coach\n\nNorth Marion’s change at head coach puts Jeramiaha Gates in the driver's seat of a team that consistently has raw talent. The Colts, haggard from transfers at quarterback, running back, and others, struggled a season ago.\n\nThat leaves plenty of runway for the Gates era to jettison into the future. The new opportunities at North Marion have attracted several of the area's top positional players. Last year's Colts had a freshman, Isaac Smith, slinging the rock. They'll have West Port's two-year varsity starting quarterback, Brittin Stevens, this year.\n\nStevens was the first of many to join Gates to attempt a Colts revival. They're mixed in with the hidden gems that dotted the 2023 roster. All eyes are on how Gates runs his ship and how far it sails in the waters of a top-heavy 2S class.\n\nTrinity Catholic: New staff\n\nFor the last two seasons, the Celtics have spent their final game in Tallahassee fighting for their first state championship since 2010. Since then, the coaching staff has seen its fair share of changes. It happens. Coaches grow, and opportunities open up, but the 2024 staff has one thing in common with 2023: head coach John Brantley.\n\nOffensive coordinator JB Bynum is calling plays for Dunnellon. Defensive coordinator Steve Young is in Georgia. The Celtics have cleaned the house and are in for a culture shift with it. Gates, an assistant coach last season, is heading his own team.\n\nDivision I prospects G'Nirve Carr, Zach Johnson, and Gerrick Gordon, anchors of the offensive and defensive line, all transferred in the off-season. Trinity Catholic could be in for a rebuild between the transfer portal movement and new staff, but you never count out a team who knows how to win.\n\nVanguard: Chemistry\n\nVanguard looks to follow up its historic season with another talent-packed roster. Last year's bunch was homegrown, this one has more players from the transfer portal. With coaching changes across the board, several of the area's top football weapons looking for new homes found Booster Stadium.\n\nMaybe you remember Gerald “Juice” Walton, an all-county receiver who will now be attacking defenses for the Knights this season. There's also talented sophomores, headlined by James \"Bubb\" Bethea, Sergarion Gunsby, and juniors ready to raise the \"V\" in larger roles.\n\nThe talent on the roster is undeniable. The pure depth makes them reminiscent of last year's team that sent 19 players to play football at the next level. If the new-look Knights can put it together, expect fireworks even if growing pains come along the way.\n\nWest Port: Chasing history\n\nAt the end of this season, the senior Wolf Pack can set the standard for success at West Port. The group finds its acclaim in a heap of wins that no one in West Port’s 24-year history can match.\n\nEthan Shepp, a two-year captain and the owner of the highest bench press, has spent four years holding up the line for his quarterback. With another exceptional season, possibly one that recreates the magic of last year's school-record six wins.\n\nIt's a tall order to ask for anyone, but hungry wolves get the job done. The record will hang over some player's heads and stoke the competitive flames for others. Shepp and the 2025 class take their hunt for history when kickoff begins on Aug. 23."
