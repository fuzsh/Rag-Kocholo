He began fighting professionally in 1828. In the 1833 title fight between Burke and Simon Byrne, Byrne was beaten so badly that he died three days later of his injuries. Burke was arrested but later exonerated for Byrne’s death. This fight gave Burke the English heavyweight championship, although the previous holder of the title, Jem Ward, refused to cede the championship belt."
