        "text": "Released: 1991, 1993, 1994\n\nAvailable On: DVD, Blu-ray\n\nDirector: Ken Loach\n\nReviewer: Victoria McGowan\n\nThis BFI collection is due for release on the 25th September\n\nWe received a free copy of this film from the BFI in return for an honest review.\n\nI was fortunate enough to be working for the Tyneside Cinema during the release of what is Ken Loach’s biggest box office hit: I, Daniel Blake (2016). I saw first-hand, queues of people who flocked to see screenings and was present with the enthusiastic crowd who came to meet the man himself when he appeared in person at the cinema along with several of the cast and the film’s writer, Paul Laverty. With I, Daniel Blake Loach appeared to have hit perfect social and political timing with a film which apparently spoke to the people and for the people about inequality, injustice and the ups and downs of the common man, and in this case woman too.\n\nI wondered at the time how many of the enthusiastic young people (and a good proportion of them in attendance were ‘young’) had seen Loach’s previous works and how many of them were simply there swept up in the current wave of left wing passion? Well, with the release of this collection of three of Loach’s lesser known films they have their chance. Despite all three being made in the early 90s, it would be impossible to refer to them as his ‘early works’ – this is a director who has been making films, commercials and televisions since the 60s (with varying degrees of commercial and critical success). Therefore, this collection – Riff Raff (1991), Raining Stones (1993) and Ladybird Ladybird (1994) can all be seen as the works of a director sure of himself in themes, style and messages. Indeed, on the surface this box set should already feel very familiar from the get go, all three films focus on characters living in poverty in the grim and grey cities of England, all hoping for something better but facing terrible struggles finding it.\n\nRiff-Raff focuses on the working life of the likable (but ultimately angry) Stevie, played by Robert Carlisle in an excellently balanced performance. Having been released from prison he finds work on a London building site as a labourer. Typically for Loach the conditions are unfair, the workers are underpaid in unsafe conditions and just further add to their working-class pain, the job is converting a hospital into luxury flats. However, instantly what stands out are the very rounded people living in them. Most of the characters are given complexity, vulnerability and warmth and even when they shouldn’t be likable, they are. Ricky Tomlinson is a real asset to the movie as a builder whose impassioned left wing political speeches are often mocked by his co-workers, and the site employs a diverse group of men yet and it never feels as if these are just racial stereotypes.\n\nDespite the low budget Loach fills each set and location with real detail and depth, the lighting is naturalistic creating intimacy and the sound quality is good, allowing even the most thickly spoken accents to come through. However, it isn’t all perfect, to those more used to glossy digital there are parts where the film can feel very televisual, almost soapy and none more than in some of the dramatic scenes that feature Stevie’s very troubled childlike girlfriend Susan (Elmer McCourt) who at times seems a bit out of her depth against Robert Carlisle’s underplayed performance. Her struggling singer character plays too much into an undeveloped melodrama with her drug use and mental illness that are never fully explored or explained. It is perhaps the fault of the first (and only time writer) Bill Jesse, Loach himself may have been uneasy with these issues, or it could have been the restrictions of so much going on in a tight 90-minute run time, nevertheless it can feel very patronising and sexist with no female characters of note in the film balance it.\n\nOverall Riff-Raff is a largely enjoyable and well-made film that eases you into its male characters and their situation like an old worn sock but unlike the sock it hasn’t faded and almost feels fresh.\n\nThe second film in the set is Raining Stones (1993) which focuses on the struggles of family rather than work. Bruce Jones plays likeable but clueless dad Bob who dreams of buying his daughter a first communion dress he cannot afford. The plot follows unemployed Bob and his friend Tommy (another enjoyable and well-rounded performance from Ricky Tomlinson) as they try to make money by any means possible each ending in disaster.\n\nThis film has a much softer, less overtly political tone. The comedy is far broader, a scene with hapless Bob offering his services to the church as a drain cleaner is certainly worth the price of this third of the box set alone. However, the tragedy of the overall situation is never lost. It is difficult at first not to feel like you want to take Bob down the club for a pint and explain to him that if he is struggling for cash then a dress should be at the bottom of his priorities. It is as if Loach and the writer (Jim Allen) have anticipated this and this very scene plays out tenderly in a conversation between Bob and his priest (Tom Hickley)\n\nWhere the film really succeeds is that slowly the audience comes around to Bob’s reasoning and can empathise with his desperation. The dress is merely a symbol, this man feels he has failed his family and in this one area he wants, no, he NEEDS to succeed at almost any cost. This film is not about a man’s religious devotion, the dress is not of spiritual significance, it is about the failure of society to provide for the man willing to try hard and in this it shares a theme with Riff Raff.\n\nAs the film progresses and the tone turns darker (drug addiction, loan sharks and in a painfully convincing scene with Tommy crying over his tea – the crushing reality of a man unable to find employment) and the performances keep up brilliantly. The role of Bob’s wife Anne (Julie Brown) could easily have been a thankless one, but Loach and Allen seem to have gone out of their way to give her a bit more strength and depth. There is genuine warmth between her and her husband, a real feeling that she is not to the straight-laced matriarch to Bob’s mishaps but that she is genuinely holding things together with a real awareness of her situation. This feels like real progress from the childlike Susan in Riff Raff.\n\nOverall Raining Stones is a touching and more human film, the characters are less aggressive and far more grounded than the detached, travelling construction workers of Riff Raff. It is all about connection – connection to religion, community, and above all family. Bob lives in what seems to be a (mostly) functional environment and it is something that as a viewer it is easy to empathise with. He is never depicted as blameless, his petty crimes (driving without tax or insurance, selling stolen meat) are crimes of desperation not anger and it is the system outside of this that is letting him and his neighbours down.\n\nThe final film in the set is by far the toughest and most complex watch for various reasons. Ladybird, Ladybird (1994) follows Maggie (Crissy Rock), a mother who loses custody of her four children after an abusive relationship and an almost fatal accident bring her to the attention of social services. She begins a seemingly stable and safe relationship with a kindly foreigner Jorge (Vladimir Vega) only to face tragedy and loss once more as she again struggles with the authorities over the right to keep her new family. Unlike the other films in the set which are inspired by general lives in working and underclass Britain, this film is based on specific real events and you can see why Loach was attracted to it. Economic and social deprivation, a feeling of injustice between ‘the system’ and the individual victimised and disempowered by it.\n\nAlthough there are custody battles this is no courtroom drama and it tackles domestic violence in a convincing and comprehensive way without that being the focus of the whole film or the drama descending into soap opera. For the first time in the box set we see Loach give a female character the centre stage. This is Maggie’s story, it is through Maggie’s eyes we see the world and through Maggie’s pain we must experience it. Loach and writer Rona Munro (the only female writer in this set) create a deep world of flawed characters, going further still than the previous films to create characters it can be difficult to agree with and a times, difficult to like. What makes this film stand out is that ‘the system’ – in this case social services – is given a voice and allowed to state their case to the audience. At times, they even come across as sympathetic, Loach allows us to see them try to help and support the family (even if Maggie’s counter arguments are at times just as convincing) and eventually to see the pain in the faces of the social workers as Maggie’s children are removed from her care. Maggie herself is not a blameless victim, the accident which really sets the loss of her children in motion happens during a moment of neglect on her part. All this can make it difficult to see what Loach is trying to say with this film.\n\nThe film does not shy away from the terrible pain of the loss and separation that Maggie constantly feels despite eventually finding happiness with Jorge and is clear about the toll it takes on her mental health. The atmosphere is tense and at times claustrophobic, there is lots of time spent in the small rooms of rented flats, again lit with the natural lighting we are used to from Loach. There are very few moments of humour (a racist neighbour aside) and this adds to the tension of never knowing whose anger and frustration will boil over next, almost every character feels on edge. Moments that should be simple domestic situations can suddenly tip into violence that is shot with a blunt intensity making it even more shocking and painful to watch. Yet Loach keeps us guessing, especially around the character of Jorge, a peaceful Paraguayan political refugee whose visa expires and is forced to work illegally to support his new family but this is not a tale of humorous mishaps or accidents waiting to happen, Jorge grinds on day after day in the kitchens and eventually sees progress, a moral message from Loach perhaps?\n\nBoth Crissy Rock and Vladimir Vega give believable performances and despite their cultural and emotional differences it always feels like a real relationship. Maggie may be difficult to like but her pain sees the audience through that and allows a connection, no matter how difficult a one it is. The tone is bit too dark and intense at times, with little let up in the assault (be it physical or emotional) and there are some incredibly distressing moments where we focus on Maggie’s pain at the loss of her children but thankfully Loach is smart enough not to focus on their distress too much as this could have been one tragedy too many. Overall this is a powerful and very rounded film, just don’t expect everything to be alright or clear cut in the end, real life is often too messy for neat happy endings.\n\nSo that’s the box set, it is well worth watching to see the subtle way Loach can tell very similar stories but with significant shifts in depth and tone. Those who saw I Daniel Blake and thought it was something revolutionary will certainly be surprised to see Loach was telling these stories 20 years ago with just as much passion and skill. Those who are familiar with his work will not be disappointed with these lesser known films. The fashions may have dated and the 35-millimetre cameras may seem grainy, almost televisual, compared to flashy digital cinematography available now but these films are certainly cinematic and worth watching. An oddball mixture of likable but tragic characters that are inviting you to grab a pint (or a cuppa) pull up a chair and put the world to rights for the next 277 minutes.\n\nSpecial features: A nice collection accessible but informative of taking heads documentaries and interviews covering Loach’s life and career without getting too dry, although sadly these are a few years old (1991, 1992 and 2006) so do not cover the amazing success of I, Daniel Blake. The usual trailers and stills are also included and Ladybird Ladybird is included as a newly restored version."
