        "text": "Ah, January – the month of hastily forgotten resolutions, fresh starts and diets that never seem to last beyond week three. It’s not your fault, though. How are you suppose to resist all those tasty cinema treats? Especially when there’s so much good stuff on.\n\nThe Hateful Eight\n\nFirst up this year is Tarantino’s almost-ditched return to the western genre, The Hateful Eight (8 Jan), starring Jennifer Jason Leigh, Kurt Russell and a lineup of the director’s usual suspects. Word has it that Tarantino only has two more big-screen features left in him, so you’d be silly to miss this one. Catch it in its intended 70mm Ultra Panavision cut at a whopping 177 minutes exclusively at Manchester’s Printworks. Don’t worry, they’ll throw in an intermission break.\n\nWe Live in Public\n\nAfter something a little different? Get down to We Live In Public, at FACT in Liverpool (13 Jan). As part of the venue’s current exhibition Follow, this stark documentary feature takes aim at the ways in which the internet and digital connectivity have completely changed how we live day-to-day. Watch as director Ondi Timoner (Dig!, Brand: A Second Coming) tracks the rise, fall and bizarre times of the internet’s greatest pioneer, Josh Harris – someone you’ve probably never heard of.\n\nJim Allen Retrospective\n\nBack over in Manchester, HOME’s Jim Allen retrospective is full of double-bills that celebrate the work of one of Britain’s most important screenwriters. Still Relevant After All These Years (9-31 Jan) includes The Spongers (9 Jan), which is followed by a Q&A with the film's producer Tony Garnett, a double-punch of The Lump and The Big Flame (10 Jan), The Rank and File followed by In the Heel of the Hunt (13 Jan), and The Choice of Evils and Willie’s Last Stand back-to-back (16 Jan). Also screening are the trio of films Allen made with Ken Loach in the 90s (Raining Stones, 20 Jan; Hidden Agenda, 23 Jan; Land and Freedom, 24 Jan). Power, politics, compassion – it’s all here.\n\nRevenge of The Mekons\n\nHOME also screens George Fitzmaurice’s exotic sequel The Son of the Sheik (28 Jan) as part of Manchester Metropolitan University’s Humanities in Public festival, complete with live piano score. The same venue explores the unlikely story of British punk-art band The Mekons with exploratory documentary Revenge of The Mekons (25 Jan). What’s more, original band member Ros Allen will join attendees for a post-screening Q&A to get into the nitty-gritty of the band’s history.\n\nBen Hopkins Q&A"
