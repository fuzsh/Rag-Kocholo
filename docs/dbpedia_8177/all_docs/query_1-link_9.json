With his loyal sidekick, Tom (Ricky Tomlinson), Bob takes odd and sometimes ill-advised jobs, like building a fireplace and stealing sheep, which he thinks will provide some quick cash. But Bob's bad luck follows him everywhere in this working-class town. When his van gets stolen, Bob makes a disastrous choice that has him risk everything he's worked for and dreamed of.",
