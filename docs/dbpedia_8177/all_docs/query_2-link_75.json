        "text": "Featuring Special Guest Wayne Brady\n\nThe GRAMMY Museum is thrilled to welcome current GRAMMY nominee for Best New Artist at the 64th Annual GRAMMY Awards, Jimmie Allen, for an intimate conversation on his rising career followed by a performance. The conversation will be moderated by Emmy award-winning actor, producer and musician Wayne Brady.\n\nMulti-platinum recording artist and songwriter Jimmie Allen has been blazing trails since the beginning of his breakout career. Allen is currently nominated for Best New Artist at the 64th Annual GRAMMY Awards in 2022, his first ever GRAMMY nomination. He made history as the first Black artist to launch a career with two consecutive No. 1 hits off his 2018 debut album Mercury Lane (which The New York Times dubbed as one of 2018’s strongest) – the first being his RIAA 2x Platinum debut single “Best Shot,” which claimed the No. 1 spot on Country radio for three weeks, and second being Platinum-certified “Make Me Want To.”\n\nIn July 2020, Allen released his star-studded collaboration project Bettie James that garnered a slew of critical acclaim for the music, the historic nature of various collaborations, and its subsequent place in country music history. Named for his late grandmother, Bettie Snead, and late father, James Allen, Bettie James has been hailed as an “announcement of [Allen’s] arrival” and a “huge step for country” (NPR), and “a powerful statement from a developing voice” (Billboard). On June 25, 2021, Allen released the project’s follow up album Bettie James Gold Edition. Doubling down on Allen’s expansive love for music across genres, the album includes nine brand new songs featuring Babyface, BRELAND, Keith Urban, LANCO, Lathan Warlick, Lindsay Ell, Little Big Town, LOCASH, Monica, Neon Union, Pitbull, teamwork. and Vikina in addition to the previous collaborations on Bettie James with Brad Paisley, Charley Pride, Darius Rucker, Mickey Guyton, Nelly, Noah Cyrus, The Oak Ridge Boys, Rita Wilson, Tauren Wells and Tim McGraw. Cumulatively, the two projects have earned 432 million global streams.\n\nAllen won the both the ACM New Male Artist of the Year award and CMA New Artist of the Year award in April and November 2021, respectively. Hailed by GRAMMY.com as one of “5 Black Artists Rewriting Country Music,” he has amassed more than 1 billion on-demand streams and performed on The Kennedy Center Honors, Dick Clark’s Rockin’ New Year’s Eve, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Good Morning America, TODAY, American Idol, Tamron Hall Show, Nick Cannon, The Steve Harvey Show, ACM Awards, CMA Awards, CMT Music Awards, and more.\n\nHis current single “Freedom Was A Highway” with superstar Brad Paisley is Top 10 on Country radio; earlier this year, Allen hit the road as special guest on Paisley’s headline Tour 2021. Much like his approach to music, Allen’s other creative pursuits know no boundaries. His debut picture book, My Voice Is a Trumpet – a powerful story about speaking up for what you believe in, at any age – was published on July 13, 2021 with Flamingo Books, an imprint of Penguin Young Readers. Allen also serves as Executive Music Producer for Netflix’s series Titletown High, which premiered globally on August 27. His song “Big In A Small Town” is the theme song for the series, which follows a Georgia town where football rules and winning is paramount, a champion high school team tackles rivalries, romance and real life as they work toward the ultimate goal: a state title. He most recently reached the quarterfinals as a contestant on Dancing With The Stars’ landmark 30th season on ABC and will join Dancing with the Stars – Live Tour 2022! for select dates this year. Beginning February, Allen will embark on his Down Home Tour 2022, his first headline tour. All dates and information can be found at www.jimmieallenmusic.com.
