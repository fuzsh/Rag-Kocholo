        "text": "Fresh off of his appearance at last night’s 64th Annual Grammy Awards, Jimmie Allen announced he’ll release his third Stoney Creek Records/BBR Music Group album, Tulip Drive, on June 24. The lead single from the record, “Down Home,” is available everywhere now.\n\nLike his previous projects, the album’s title has a personal meaning for Allen and family ties. Tulip Drive is the name of the street his late grandmother grew up on. Similarly, his 2018 debut album Mercury Lane was named for the street Allen grew up on, and his 2020 and 2021 releases, Bettie James & Bettie James Gold Edition, were named for his grandmother (Bettie Snead) and father (James “Big Jim” Allen).\n\n“A lot of the songs on this album are from that time period. This is the first album where a lot of the songs are actually written based off a lot of my own personal life experiences–from relationships, the hardships of life, to the parties and the good times,” Allen shares. “A lot of these songs are based off things I went through when I was in later in high school and college, at a place where I was just learning a lot of life lessons from my grandmother. I wanted to honor her by naming this album Tulip Drive, after the street she lived on in Lewes, Delaware.”\n\nAllen was nominated for Best New Artist at last night’s 64th annual Grammy Awards, and attended the show for the first time in addition to performing “Down Home” and presenting multiple categories during the premiere ceremony. He also performed the song at the Recording Academy Honors, presented by the Black Music Collective, on April 2 and appeared throughout the weekend at the 31st annual MusiCares Person of the Year Benefit Gala, Spotify’s Best New Artist celebration, and at a panel for I AM Musicology Presents: Road to the Grammys."
