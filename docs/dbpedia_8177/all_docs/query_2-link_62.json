        "text": "The NBA is in a great place. Living legends like Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and LeBron James are still elite. Young veterans like Jayson Tatum and Nikola Jokić are champions. Up-and-comers like Anthony Edwards and Tyrese Haliburton have arrived. Then there’s the new, new blood — rising stars like Victor Wembanyama, Paolo Banchero and Brandon Miller, who headline a crop of 21-and-under players with great variance as far as potential.\n\nLet’s focus on the last group. As players between the ages of 22 and 25 start to find themselves in the NBA, it’s this 21-and-under batch who carry some uncertainty. Wembanyama could be a top-five player in the league as soon as this coming season. After him and a few others, though, the ceiling of this particular crop of prospects becomes far more unknown.\n\nSo, to put it all into perspective, The Athletic conducted an NBA all-21-and-under draft to try and find out who might be breakout stars four or five years from now. The premise was simple: Any player who was 21 or younger at the end of this past season was eligible to be selected. Players drafted in June were eligible, as well. Because he’s not yet in the NBA, Duke’s Cooper Flagg wasn’t eligible to be selected, although he’d go top-five in this exercise. The goal was to create the best team possible to potentially win a championship five years from now, in 2029. The Athletic’s James L. Edwards III, Kelly Iko and Will Guillory each picked a team of eight players.\n\nYou can see the draft choices, the reasoning behind each selection and their thoughts on the up-and-coming talent below.\n\nRound 1\n\n1. Victor Wembanyama, San Antonio Spurs (Edwards): I considered going with Emoni Bates here, but Wembanyama will have to do, I guess. In all seriousness, if we did a draft that factored in 26-and-under players, I think Wembanayama still might go No. 1. He wasn’t perfect this past season as a rookie, but all of the hype was real. Players feared him when attacking the rim. The diverse skill set on offense popped. Wembanyama will be a top-10 player in the NBA next season. I’m calling it now.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nVictor Wembanyama lives up to rookie hype. The scary part? It's just Chapter 1\n\n2. Paolo Banchero, Orlando Magic (Guillory): I had to double-check this one to make sure, but Banchero somehow doesn’t turn 22 until November. He’s already got two seasons under his belt after averaging 20-plus points per game, and he was the best player on a Magic team that won 47 games last season before pushing the Cleveland Cavaliers to seven games in the first round of the playoffs. While Banchero’s efficiency as a scorer can be up-and-down at times, he’s proven to be one of the better offensive weapons in the league among players who were born before 50 Cent released “Get Rich or Die Tryin’.” I think Banchero’s the clear No. 2 choice in this draft behind Wemby.\n\n3. Alperen Şengün, Houston Rockets (Iko): Şengün established himself as the best player on the Rockets last season and is flirting hard with stardom. I’m sure folks are tired of the Nikola Jokić comparisons, but Sengun is truly an offensive hub with an old-school, back-to-the-basket blend of footwork and post play that can initiate action from anywhere in the half court. Just surround him with cutters, floor spacers and overall high-IQ players and let the Turkish wizard cook.\n\nRound 2\n\n4. Brandon Miller, Charlotte Hornets (Iko): I’m building my team like I would on NBA 2K, and I need an athletic, three-level wing scorer who can play off of Şengün. Enter Miller, who by all accounts is a better defender than the public gives him credit for, all while being a bona fide shooter and multifaceted offensive weapon. The Hornets have been stuck in neutral for a few seasons, but with a new regime in place, there’s no reason why the 6-foot-9 phenom shouldn’t be a huge part of that turnaround project.\n\n5. Dereck Lively II, Dallas Mavericks (Guillory): For the record, Cooper Flagg would’ve absolutely been my pick here if he were eligible for this exercise. However, landing Lively is a pretty decent consolation prize. The 7-foot-1, 230-pound center played a crucial role on a Mavericks squad that won the Western Conference last season, and he doesn’t turn 21 until February. He’s got such great length and athleticism at the position, and he’s already become a fantastic complement to Luka Dončić on the offensive end as a lob threat and a passer on the short roll. This past draft, teams were speaking openly about their desire to find the next Lively.\n\n6. GG Jackson II, Memphis Grizzlies (Edwards): The league is always looking for 6-foot-9 wings who have potential three-level scoring, and I thought Jackson really popped as a rookie in an unfavorable situation last season in Memphis. Jackson was near the top of every team’s scouting report and still put up solid numbers for a teenager. He doesn’t turn 20 until December, so I have time on my side here.\n\nRound 3\n\n7. Jabari Smith Jr., Houston Rockets (Edwards): It kind of feels like people are a bit lower on Smith nowadays, but I’m not. His offensive efficiency across the board was better last season, and he even grabbed 8.1 rebounds per game. I also like that he has been available through his first two seasons, playing in 76 games or more in each. He’s going to be able to shoot it at a very high level from 3 sooner rather than later, I believe, and I think his defense will continue to improve with time.\n\n8. Jonathan Kuminga, Golden State Warriors (Guillory): Kuminga’s decision-making on both ends of the court can be maddening at times. It was a big reason why Warriors coach Steve Kerr was so reluctant to lean into him as the Warriors’ second-best offensive option last season. But there’s no denying how dangerous Kuminga can be when he’s playing decisively and downhill. Once his jumper becomes a little more reliable, he’s going to be extremely difficult for opposing defenses to handle.\n\n9. Amen Thompson, Houston Rockets (Iko): I get the spacing concerns, I really do. I also watched how Thompson found his niche as a rookie despite his shooting woes, using his versatility and athleticism to defend multiple positions (95th percentile, per Estimated Plus-Minus), put downhill pressure on defenders and play without the ball. Late in the season, Thompson was unlocked in the dunker’s spot, a testament to his positionless approach that lends well to the modern game.\n\nRound 4\n\n10. Cam Whitmore, Houston Rockets (Iko): If we’re talking upside, it’s hard to look past Whitmore and not be optimistic. Don’t get me wrong, it took the rookie some time to adjust to life under head coach Ime Udoka, a period that included a stint in the G League. And he’s still developing his live-game processor, decision-making and commitment to defense. But, man, this kid can really go. How on Earth 18 teams passed on him on draft night still confuses me to this day. Jalen Hood-Schifino? Really?\n\n11. Scoot Henderson, Portland Trail Blazers (Guillory): It’s been wild to see how many people have jumped off the Scoot Henderson bandwagon over the past calendar year. In this draft alone, we’ve already taken five players ahead of him from the 2023 NBA Draft. I’ll buy low on a guy whom many scouts were in love with this time last summer. As it turns out, playing point guard in the NBA at 19 is pretty difficult. I’m expecting Henderson to show some significant growth in Year 2 under Chauncey Billups’ tutelage.\n\n12. Ausar Thompson, Detroit Pistons (Edwards): As someone who watched every second of Thompson’s rookie season up close and personal, I just haven’t seen too many players that young with the defensive instincts that he has. Athletically, Thompson floats and maneuvers like very few players I’ve seen, too. His jump shot is a massive work in progress and the handle needs to be tightened to unlock his playmaking potential, but if one of those two things gets fixed, Thompson’s ceiling rises several floors.\n\nRound 5\n\n13. Stephon Castle, San Antonio Spurs (Edwards): This might be the first reach of the draft, but Castle was my favorite player in this year’s class. He’s going to be a plus-level defender as soon as he plays his first official game, and I think the offense is going to be better than some anticipate. I’m not as concerned about the jump shot as much as others are because I don’t think it’s too funky and, from all accounts, Castle is a hard worker. Sign me up for any plus defender who has good playmaking chops and has a workable jump shot. Those guys tend to make a pretty good living.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nStephon Castle and Victor Wembanyama's connection could determine Spurs’ future\n\n14. Josh Giddey, Chicago Bulls (Guillory): Another buy-low candidate here for me. As much as we picked Giddey’s game apart in last year’s playoffs, he still played an important role on an Oklahoma City team that had a legit shot to win the title. Even though he wasn’t a fit for that roster, Giddey still has a lot to provide as a point guard with great size and excellent passing vision.\n\n15. Brandin Podziemski, Golden State Warriors (Iko): The more I watch Podz, the more I understand why the Warriors have rebuffed approaches — most recently from the Utah Jazz — for the 21-year-old guard. He’s already a savvy playmaker who takes care of the basketball (a common plight for young players) and is a legit shooter and plus-rebounder at his position. Podziemski’s development was arguably the best thing to emerge from a strange Warriors season and as such, he’s on my team.\n\nRound 6\n\n16. Matas Buzelis, Chicago Bulls (Iko): I still can’t believe Charlotte passed on him two months ago. I’ve always been a sucker for the lengthy, versatile, GG Jackson II types and Buzelis, a player I was extremely high on during the pre-draft process, is only going to get better. He was one of the summer-league standouts in a pretty underwhelming class; Buzelis showed flashes that should have space to grow in the wake of DeMar DeRozan’s departure. He’s a Hyundai with the confidence of a Tesla Cybertruck. Bulls fans should be hype.\n\n17. Jeremy Sochan, San Antonio Spurs (Guillory): While Sochan isn’t the most exciting player to watch, he’s a glue guy who does all the little things that make a team better. San Antonio’s failed experiment to turn him into a point guard made some fans sour on his game last year. I don’t fault him for that so much. Once the Spurs start playing in meaningful games, Sochan will be able to provide a little bit of everything on the court and he’s got a chance to be a really good perimeter defender with size. Those guys are invaluable in the postseason.\n\n18. Jalen Duren, Detroit Pistons (Edwards): Duren won’t turn 21 until November, so the upside is still there. He’s already a really good rebounder, vertical lob threat and has good playmaking chops for a center. The defense is what separates him and someone like Lively here. Duren has to make real progress on that end to reach his potential as a player.\n\nRound 7\n\n19. Cason Wallace, Oklahoma City Thunder (Edwards): I’ll take the rookie who played significant minutes on the best regular-season team in the Western Conference. He’s a good point-of-attack defender who was an efficient scorer on low volume this past season. Wallace feels like a player who will always impact winning. I’ll always go to bat for those types.\n\n20. Shaedon Sharpe, Portland Trail Blazers (Guillory): Sharpe’s second season as a pro got off to a promising start, but he only managed to play 32 games before undergoing abdominal surgery in January. Through the first 22 games of last season, Sharpe was averaging 18.8 points while shooting 36.5 percent on 3-pointers (6.2 attempts). I might be one of maybe four people in the world who are excited to see what the Portland backcourt can do next season. I think Scoot and Sharpe have the potential to be an exciting combo.\n\n21. Dyson Daniels, Atlanta Hawks (Iko): At this juncture, the talent pool is essentially dried up, but I’m going to take a swing on a project. Daniels is making his presence felt at the Olympics for the Australian national team, and there’s no reason why he can’t be an impactful two-way player in the NBA at some point. Daniels was never going to get a real opportunity in New Orleans, but I think the trade to Atlanta will jumpstart his young career. Sign me up for the 6-8 ballhandler who wants to pick defenders up full-court. I’m a fan.\n\nRound 8\n\n22. Reed Sheppard, Houston Rockets (Iko): If Sheppard gets enough minutes, he’s my dark horse for Rookie of the Year. Summer league is miles away from the NBA level, but even at that, Sheppard showed why teams were so high on him. He looks under control with the ball in his hands, and every shot just feels like it’s going in. Defensively, he’s going to learn proper positioning within a team scheme, but his instincts will come in handy on a routine occasion.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nIn summer-league debut, Reed Sheppard flashes traits that made him a top-5 pick\n\n23. Zach Edey, Memphis Grizzlies (Guillory): Edey is the No. 1 guy on my list of players from the 2024 draft who I think we’re going to end up looking back and saying, “How did that guy not go top-five?” He’s going to be one of the most enormous players we’ve ever seen in the NBA, and he’s going to be a fantastic fit in Memphis next to Ja Morant and Jaren Jackson Jr. I also think people are sleeping on how much Edey’s body has improved over time. He was in fantastic shape during summer league, and he’s not nearly as slow and immobile as some people like to portray him.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nZach Edey is already showing doubters what he can do in the NBA\n\n24. Zaccharie Risacher, Atlanta Hawks (Edwards): The fact that the No. 1 pick in the 2024 NBA Draft barely cracked our top 25 of 21-and-under players says a lot about how down and unpredictable this particular class projects to be. With that said, it’s hard for me to pass on a big wing with a nice shooting stroke who is only 19.\n\nDo you like the team you drafted?\n\nEdwards: I do. At the end of the day, the goal of this exercise was to acknowledge the 21-and-under talent while putting together a team that could win a title five years from now. My team has great size, defense and positional versatility. The shooting on my roster is OK. I’m really banking on development in key areas. Overall, given the talent pool we were allowed to pick from, I like what I did.\n\nGoing into this exercise, I thought there would be more players in this age group whom I was higher on. Once we got to around pick No. 12, my belief in those guys becoming legitimate stars dwindled significantly.\n\nWas that the same for either one of you?\n\nGuillory: I don’t think I have a single guy on my team whom I would trust to hit a 3-pointer in a big game, but I love the size and athleticism we have across the board. I love Banchero and Kuminga as my top two scorers, and whenever those guys miss, Lively and Edey will be ready to crush the offensive glass.\n\nI have to agree that the options were pretty thin once we got past the third round. I was honestly shocked to see guys like Jackson and Thompson go as high as they did.\n\nOne other observation after going through this list of players: I was fairly surprised to see how many good, young center prospects I had to consider each time I was up to pick.\n\nWembanyama, Şengün, Lively, Duren and Edey were among the 24 players we picked. I also put real consideration into taking Portland rookie Donovan Clingan and Miami rookie Kel’el Ware late in the latter parts of the draft. You could also throw Jabari Smith Jr. in the mix since he played so much center for Houston late last season. It’s clear how many teams are prioritizing getting young (and cheap) at that position.\n\nIko: My team is definitely going to be 23rd in defensive efficiency, but if we’re talking about it from an NBA League Pass standpoint, it’s pretty close to must-watch television.\n\nOn a more serious note, I think my roster blend is intriguing. I like the combination of Miller and Whitmore as my wing scorers with Amen Thompson and Podziemski providing the backcourt playmaking, all while Şengün pulls the strings. The restriction to players 21-and-younger forced me to opt for athleticism and versatility over traditional size, but I think the Buzelis and Sheppard picks at the back end of the draft really pan out in the near future.\n\nIt’s a tough exercise knowing that there are players you hope to get in another round, but you also understand that the depth isn’t great so there will be reaches and questionable selections. Overall, solid draft.\n\nWhich players will we regret not selecting?\n\nEdwards: It’s probably Alexandre Sarr for me. He was not good at summer league and I wasn’t a big fan going into the 2024 NBA Draft. However, I wouldn’t be surprised if we looked up in three years and saw the 7-footer with a massive wingspan knocking down 3s at a good clip, creating his own shot off the dribble regularly, blocking everything at the rim and switching onto smaller guards on the perimeter. I don’t believe that will be the case, but clearly a few NBA teams think he can get there.\n\nGuillory: I chose Edey for my final pick, but I definitely went into this hoping I could find a way to pick Ware at some point. I was extremely impressed watching him perform during summer league. He’s got fantastic touch around the basket. He’s a good rim protector. He moves really well in the open floor. He’s already comfortable shooting 3-pointers. As long as he stays healthy, there’s no doubt in my mind he’s going to be a good pro.\n\nIko: If I had the chance of redoing the draft, I would have added another big man — Edey is a good shout — but I’m going to regret passing on Duren. He’s a double-double machine, but I think his rim protection and overall defensive efficiency should be actualized under new Pistons head coach J.B. Bickerstaff. Duren is a mobile big with a soft touch who also is a solid vertical spacer and, like his colleagues in this exercise, young enough to warrant serious attention.\n\nWhich team, aside from yours, do you like the most?\n\nEdwards: I’ll go with Kelly’s team only because he has more players who project to be good-to-great shooters. There is a real world where no one on Will’s roster is at least an above-average threat from 3-point distance. Sorry, Will. I do think your team would be more fun to actually watch play, though, because I have no idea what the identity would be. You also got the unlucky draw of going second.\n\nGuillory: I think the easy answer is James’ team because he has Wemby and Kelly doesn’t. I also think a team with Ausar Thompson, Smith, Wallace and Castle would get into at least two altercations every game. Also, taking Jackson at No. 6 was probably a reach, but I’ll admit that I’m pretty jealous he’s not on my team. I love his upside.\n\nIko: James’ team is fun. Like my esteemed brothers on this panel, I too love Jackson’s upside, and pairing that with Wembanyama is unfair. Smith and Castle also mesh nicely with that core. But if we’re keeping it a stack, I’m only here so I don’t get fined. Both of their teams stink.\n\n(Photo of Victor Wembanyama and Paolo Banchero: Daniel Dunn / USA TODAY Sports)"
