The compact gives the tribe a monopoly over sports betting in Florida and allows for the addition of craps and roulette games to their casinos, in exchange for millions of dollars in annual payments to the state. Although the compact was held up for two years due to litigation, that legal stay was recently lifted to allow those issues to be resolved. Allen addressed those issues and spoke about the future of the Hard Rock empire with GGB Publisher Roger Gros via Zoom in January.\n\nSponsored by iGamingPlayer.com"
