        "text": "International 14 World Championship at Circolo Vela Torbole, Lake Garda, Italy - Day 5\n\nby Harvey Hillary 8 Aug 01:16 PDT\n\nAndy Shaw and Rob Struckett during the International 14 Worlds at Lake Garda Â© Annamaria Ramy\n\nAndy Shaw and Rob Struckett move closer to their first i14 world title after sailing an incredibly consistent series to date. The young guns from Itchenor Sailing Club have shown a click of speed on their rivals with an impressive score line of 2,1,1,4,1 after 5 races. This leaves them needing a 4th in either of the two remaining races to take the title.\n\nYesterday's race typified their regatta having recovered from rounding 5th at the windward mark, pulling through with a mix a speed and accurate lay lines to take lead on the final lap.\n\nThe leaders were so absorbed with each other they failed to spot the S Flag at the last wing mark. Shore and Massey continuing to race the final leg as the sky's darkened from the North. The remaining boats had to turn turtle and sit out the rain squalls and.lightening until the trans Montana wind passed. Big thanks to the safety team from Circola Vela Torbole.\n\nOverall, Glen Truswell and Ed Fitzgerald lay in second having sailed a strong series counting 4,3,3,2,3. The pair had to overcome sickness earlier in the week and have been unable to find their flow. Twice the UK Champions have lead races and been overtaken which shows just how close racing has become in the class.\n\nWith another impressively consistent series, Mark Krstic and James Lanati, from Blackrock SC in Melbourne, sit third with a score line of 3,2,6,3,7 - The team have been reveling in the 14-18kt conditions describing Torbole as a bucket list venue for the class. A strong Australian contingent of twelve boats demonstrates the enduring appeal of the class down under with Lindsey Irwin and Andrew Perry in 5th and Bramley and Hanrahan in 7th.\n\nDefending Champions Massey and Hillary suffered catastrophic rudder failure on day 2 and backed that up with a scrappy race 3 as the usually smooth operators showed a chink in their armour. The Musto team are counting a 1, RTD, 13, 1, 2 in fourth place overall.\n\nThe seventy boat fleet have two remaining races in their series but the title is likely to be decided today."
