        "text": "Bassist and vocalist Nick Daniels III, a much-respected stalwart of New Orleans funk and R&B for decades, died Friday of complications from multiple myeloma. He was 68.\n\nDaniels was half of the two-bass lineup that defined Dumpstaphunk, the R&B/funk band fronted by keyboardist Ivan Neville. Over the decades, Daniels was a key member of the bands that backed the Neville Brothers, Dr. John, Allen Toussaint and the Wild Magnolias, as well as Etta James and Boz Scaggs.\n\nHe was an inspiration to successive generations of musician, to whom he was always willing to offer advice, and was much beloved for his sunny, positive disposition and generosity both on- and off-stage.\n\n\"Nick Daniels had a true gift as a musician and singer,\" Galactic bassist Robert Mercurio wrote on Facebook on Saturday, as news of Daniels' passing broke. \"He could do things I could never imagine being able to do.\n\n\"But my favorite part of seeing Nick was his genuine kindness to me for as long as I can remember. Seeing his big beaming smile and sitting and talking with him meant the world to me as a young bassist on the New Orleans music scene. I’m heartbroken over this loss.\"\n\nDaniels and Ivan Neville were lifelong friends and bandmates. As youngsters, they would rehearse in a shed behind the Neville family home on Valence Street.\n\nTheir band the Uptown Allstars morphed into the Neville Brothers' backing band in the early 1980s. Daniels and Ivan Neville also lived together for a time in Los Angeles, where Daniels joined blues singer Etta James' band.\n\nDaniels generally played a five-string bass, as opposed to the more standard four-string model. He and fellow bassist Tony Hall gave Dumpstaphunk its unique rhythm section.\n\nIn addition to the Dumpstaphunk discography, his album credits included the Neville Brothers’ 1996 release “Valence Street.”\n\nIn 2022, he released an album called “Run To Daylight” under the name The Groove Krewe featuring Nick Daniels III that showcased his various talents up front.\n\nDaniels died on the second day of the 2024 New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival. A week after his passing, on May 2, his Dumpstaphunk bandmates are scheduled to perform right before the Rolling Stones on the main Festival Stage.\n\nDumpstaphunk previously opened for the Rolling Stones at the Caesars Superdome in July 2019.\n\nAfter Hurricane Katrina, Daniels moved to the Austin area but continued to perform in New Orleans frequently and on the road with Dumpstaphunk."
