        "text": "Article content\n\nThe list of all the good things Jim Allen was and did in his life is long and impressive.\n\nRight at the top should be Jim Allen was one of the good guys.\n\nThe popular teacher and coach died quietly at his home Sunday in his 73rd year.\n\nAllen spent his life in athletics and education, working with young people and getting involved in the community.\n\nAllen coached and taught at various schools in London and around the area, retiring in 2001. He continued to coach after his retirement and at the time of his death was coaching the Central Golden Ghosts senior girls and junior boys basketball teams.\n\nSomehow coaching two teams at the time of his death was a fitting statement for how Allen lived his life. No matter what he did, he always tried to do a little more if he could.\n\nAllen spent more than 40 years working with students and athletes.\n\nHe was involved with the London Sports Council and KidSport London Chapter. He was the director of Ontario Educational Leadership Centre in Orillia for many years and recently became a senator at Highland Country Club.\n\nAs a coach, he won championships on a regular basis, especially when he coached at North Middlesex where his teams won four Ontario titles.\n\nAllen is in the London Sports Hall of Fame as an assistant coach to Craig Boydell on the 1991 Western Mustangs basketball team that won the Canadian university championship.\n\nAllen was also a tremendous athlete. He still holds the Ontario high school record for the 200-yard run, which he set in 1961.\n\nIt’s a distance that’s not run any longer but Allen’s time of 21.5 broke the Canadian schoolboy record of 21.9, set by 1960 Canadian Olympian Harry Jerome.\n\nSome of his students who saw pictures of Allen breaking the record were amazed at how “buff” he looked.\n\nAllen, a native of Kalamazoo, Mich., was a caring, personable individual who always had time to talk and listen. He believed in community and the young people who made up that community.\n\nWinning was always important to Allen but making things enjoyable for his kids was always at the very top of his to-do list.\n\n“Mr. Allen was more than just a coach to us, he was a great friend,” said Bre Murphy, captain of Central’s senior girls team. “From practices to tournaments, coach was always making things fun. He taught us more than he will know and we will be forever grateful for his time, guidance and unwavering kindness and commitment.”\n\nMurphy recalled one thing her team heard most often from Allen during basketball games: “Three in the key, are you building a house in there?” he’d say.\n\nBrandon Fonseca, captain of the junior boys team, described a man who was “pretty young at heart.”\n\nHe was surprised Allen was in his 70s.\n\n“He was always in a good mood,” Fonseca said. “He was never down, never angry. He loved to add humour to everything. He always had a smile on his face. Everyone loved playing for him.”\n\nAllen could be easygoing but he had a strong belief in doing what he believed was the right thing. It meant there were times when it put him in conflict with some of teaching colleagues, especially during several work-to-rule situations.\n\n“Jim was always good for a comment,” said longtime former London Free Press reporter Steve Green, who covered Allen for many years. “He said what he meant and meant what he said.”\n\nBut it was always about the kids with Allen.\n\n“He connected with everybody. The kids just loved him. That’s why it’s been so hard for them. He forged a relationship with them,” said Ron Douglas, head of athletics at Central. “He had their best interest at heart. He was like a parent. If they did something wrong, he would let them know but he did it in such a way they weren’t offended.”\n\nIt’s a legacy with which Allen would be happy.\n\nThat is how he wanted to be remembered, he told Green for a story in 2001 on his retirement: “. . . as someone who gave everyone the same opportunity, an equal chance to succeed with no preconceived ideas. And that I was honest with them.”\n\nHe is survived by his wife of almost 50 years Marsha, along with daughter LuAnne Hughes and son Jamie Allen."
