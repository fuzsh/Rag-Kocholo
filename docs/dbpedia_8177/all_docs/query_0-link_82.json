        "text": "Mystery tour of the British workina class\n\nRaining Stones (M). At Electric\n\nShadows in the Boulevard Twin.\n\nCOMPARED with film-maker\n\nKen Loach, the generation\n\nthat came to be known as\n\nthe angry young men are but a col\n\nlection of pussycats.\n\nYet, while Loach's observations\n\nof contemporary British working\n\nclass life are much more savage and\n\nacerbic, they are also furiously\n\ncomic, seeing the normal behaviour\n\nof their characters for what it is,\n\nfunny in adversity.\n\nRaining Stones begins on a fog\n\ncovered moorland as two men run\n\nafter a flock of sheep. They are\n\nBob (Bruce Jones) and Tommy\n\n(Ricky Tomlinson). They want to\n\ncatch a sheep to flog to a butcher\n\nfor a few quid.\n\nThe driving force is Bob's con\n\nfrontation with adversity. His\n\nseven-year-old daughter is about to\n\ntake communion for the first time\n\nand needs more than £100 worth of\n\nclothes for the occasion. Well, not\n\nin need, but Bob is determined that\n\nshe is going to church that day\n\ndressed for the occasion.\n\nJulie Brown, as Anne, and Bruce Jones, as Bob, in Raining Stones. Help\n\nJulie Brown, as Anne, and Bruce Jones, as Bob, in Raining Stones.\n\nThe film is about how Bob raises\n\nthe cash. It's a series of debacles as\n\nBob tries to break through the\n\nglass ceiling that presses down on\n\npeople of his class, place and time.\n\nHis job-seeking takes us through\n\ndrain cleaning, bouncing at a disco,\n\nlabouring for a landscape gardener.\n\nHis van is stolen and he borrows\n\nthe money for another without tell\n\ning Anne (Julie Brown). This black\n\nens his life wfoen the lender factors\n\nthe loan to a hard man who threat\n\nens Anne and the child when Bob\n\ndefaults on a payment.\n\nHere is not only the basis of\n\nsonic wonderful comedy but a vig\n\norous statement about the condition\n\nof the working class in Britain.\n\nUsing a non-professional cast of\n\nmostly working-class folk. Loach\n\nworks from a story outline rather\n\nthan a detailed shooting script,\n\nsending the players into the world\n\nand filming them unobtrusively so\n\nthat the people in the street or the\n\nmarket square become extras with\n\nout being aware of it. His interiors\n\nare shot in real locations, not in\n\nsets where walls can be opened out\n\nand lighting controlled.\n\nThe result is impressive in its\n\nrealism. Writer Jim Allen is well\n\nqualified to write working-class dra\n\nma — as a miner, he was once\n\nblack-listed from every pit in Lan\n\ncashire; his stint as a staff writer\n\nfor Coronation Street ended when\n\nat a story conference he suggested\n\nsending the whole cast on a mys\n\ntery tour and driving the coach\n\nover a cliff. The film's Manchester\n\nlocations are where Allen lived.\n\nLoach says that, politically, films\n\nhave very little impact. He bemoans\n\nthat that has been the case with his\n\nTV films about miners. Yet 1 feel\n\nw\n\nlie is too pessimistic. His films, by\n\ncombining political statements forci\n\nbly made with a deep sense of\n\nunderstanding of characters anil a\n\nwonderful sensitivity for comedy.'\n\ncannot but increase public aware\n\nness of social issues, particularly\n\nunemployment, in a way that- TV\n\nnews and documentary doesn't\n\nachieve with the same level of con\n\nviction.\n\nWhat is important about Raining\n\nStones is not that Bob comes out in\n\nfront at the end, with his daughter\n\ndressed for church as he wishes, his\n\nproblem with the loan shark re:\n\nsolved in a grim manner that allows\n\nLoach to spend time examining\n\nhow the Church is dealing with\n\ncurrent social and moral problems,\n\nhis' van located by the police who\n\nseem all unconcerned that it isn't\n\nregistered.\n\nLoach's depiction of Bob's pro\n\ngress to those points is wonderfully\n\naware of all the possibilities of the\n\nstory, put on the screen with a col\n\nlection of economical film-making\n\nskills that manifests in every frame\n\nthe devotion of the film-maker and\n\nnis leam."
