The Innocence of Lizette was fourteen-year-old Mary Miles Minter's fifth American Film Co. motion picture and "Mutual Star Production," following Youth's Endearing Charm, Dulcie's Adventure, Faith, and A Dream or Two Ago (all 1916, see entries), according to the 30 December 1916 Mutual News, a weekly organ of the Mutual Film Corp. (included in the same date's issue of Motion Picture News.) Its original proposed title, according to an advertisement in the 9 September 1916 Motion Picture News, was Lizette, but Mutual News also spelled it Lisette. Minter, who was sometimes called "Lovely Mary," was considered a competitor to Mary Pickford, who was ten years older but still playing young parts.

Filming was done at the American Film Co. studios in Santa Barbara, CA, according to the 30 December 1916 Mutual News.

American ran a full-page advertisement for The Innocence of Lizette in the 16 December 1916 Reel Life with a photograph of Minter holding a baby. An item in that same week's Motography promised that her new movie was "all about a baby," because no Mary Miles Minter film "would be complete without some babies for her to cuddle."

In 1921, American re-edited many of its films, including this series of Mary Miles Minter releases, and put them on the state rights market as "reconstructed features" under new titles. The Innocence of Lizette was retitled The Marriage Bargain, according to the 24 September 1921 Trade Review.

Lizette becomes an orphan when her father, a once famous actor, dies and leaves her in the care of his kindly landlady Granny Page, who is impoverished. While selling newspapers on the street for Granny's nephew Paul, Lizette attracts the attention of two men. One is Dan Nye, a friendly figure who is actually a gentleman crook and blackmailer. The other is millionaire Henry Faure, who, seeing her sterling and innocent qualities which remind him of the daughter he lost, adopts her. While Henry is out of town on business, Lizette finds a baby on her doorstep, and when Henry returns a few months later, she tells him that the child is her own, fearing that otherwise he will not let her keep it. Not having the least notion of biology, and simply assuming that babies are gifts from heaven, Lizette cannot understand Henry's horror at hearing this news. She gladly names the father as Dan Nye, after which Henry finds the man and insists that he marry Lizette. The wily Nye agrees to marry her in exchange for a large sum of money. Before this can happen, however, the real mother, Alice, appears to claim the baby, and thereby eases Henry's mind about his adopted daughter. For her part, Lizette realizes that she is attracted to Paul, Granny's ...
