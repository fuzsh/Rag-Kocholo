        "text": "Following CBS's live production of ''On Golden Pond'' on Sunday night, I had a nightmare flash: Will we be watching this again in 20 years with Mel Gibson and Michelle Pfeiffer as the lovable old coots? Then again, 20 years later, with Johnny Depp and Gywneth Paltrow?\n\nThis mediocre play does seem indestructible -- and irresistible to actors of a certain age and to audiences, who have embraced numerous versions of it. At least Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer, with admirable finesse, brought a crisp astringency to the proceedings, which made the play's sentimentality bearable.\n\nIt remains a mystery why CBS chose this vehicle about aging parents and family reconciliation to mount a live production. At least ''Fail-Safe,'' which this network broadcast live last April, was built around the tension of potential nuclear war, the action taking place in real time. (O.K., the war in question was the cold war, but it was still war.)\n\nThe only thing waiting to detonate in ''On Golden Pond'' is the simmering tension between elderly Norman Thayer (Mr. Plummer) and his middle-aged daughter, Chelsea (Glenne Headly). It's a small charge indeed, watching the forced hugging between this cranky father and whiny daughter.\n\nWhat nostalgia is being catered to? At the first commercial break, Vince Rosino, president of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, the show's sponsor, offered his vision: ''Tonight's program marks a return to the proud tradition of live dramatic broadcasts that were such a memorable part of the early days of television, the kind of programs we all once shared with one another in living rooms across North America. We hope tonight's presentation will find your loved ones gathered together in much the same way.'' This seems like a wistful sentiment, especially appearing on the network that has brought families together to watch the stagy cutthroat competition on ''Survivor.''\n\nThe 1981 movie version was swaddled in weepiness from the outset as the camera swooned at nature, captured in golden light. A frail-looking Henry Fonda played crusty Norman; Katharine Hepburn was Ethel, his devoted wife. The movie seemed an ode to these stars, an acknowledgment that they represented a stalwart elegance that was dying with them.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
