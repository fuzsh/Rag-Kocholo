        "text": "At its core, this is a simple movie. Something is a little off about the inhabitants of Santa Mira, CA; the key term here being little. This is a horror film shot in a sterilely broad daylight: so the monster lurks in the minds of men. If we follow the original 1965 film’s storyline, the inhabitants of this charming suburban daydream of a town have been replaced by identical versions of themselves while they slept by an alien race looking to move their dying species to Earth. Subsequent film adaptations have changed some of the details to infuse their take with freshness; but in truth, the devil here is not in the details ― this horror runs deeper and it takes the shape of whatever crevasses run through the minds behind the eyes that watch it.\n\nUpon its release, the Invasion of the Body Snatchers was widely considered a thinly-veiled metaphor for the surge of Mccarthyism in the America of the fifties. In the midst of an era marked by government-planted paranoia that the enemy is among us, the seeds were planted in the minds of theatergoers and took the shape of a communist neighbor: the disruptor of hardly-earned suburban peace hidden in plain sight. But as the decade faded into the Swinging Sixties and the Generation Gap deepened, its new audiences sowed the opposite message, and toyed with a new paranoia of totalitarian government control, of losing oneself in the conformity needed to power the country’s social and political apparatus. They found their support in the rumors of censorship, with the movie’s original ending being deemed “too bleak” for the audiences of the time, perhaps because it supposedly rolled the credits right after Dr. Bennell faced the camera yelling “They're here already! You're next! You're next!\" The following remakes leaned increasingly into the movie’s political undertones, against the backdrop of the post-Vietnam era, the Korean War and later, the Gulf War and the War on Terror. Regardless of the year, audiences everywhere saw the film’s potential as a mirror for the society of the time, and they didn’t doubt to look into it.\n\nIt may come as a surprise, then, that the movie’s own star said in an interview that after extensive talks with Jack Finney, the author of the novel which inspired the picture, he felt no political allegory was intended. This posture, although certainly valid, may be missing the point entirely. The film’s ability to terrify audiences across generations lies not in the political subtext that was or wasn’t undoubtedly present in each of the film’s versions, in other words, the answer to the film’s question of why the “body snatchers” are taking over the bodies of humans; it lies in the question, of whether or not we could do anything to stop them.\n\nWe could say then, maybe, that humanity's greatest fear is not just of losing itself, but doing so unknowingly. It is a fear which plagues the minds of people such as you and me, taking the shape of the horrors of war carried out by people whose government has lied to them about the nature of the enemy, or nameless figures lurking behind the shadows of power, controlling our minds, be it through our television sets or cellphones. In this sense, Invasion of the Body Snatchers may as well be a cautionary tale meant to remind its audience to take a good look around because the day in which they take over will look almost exactly like today; it’s just up to us to decide whom or what exactly “they” are.\n\nThe pain of not feeling heard nor believed from this experience resurfaces when I watch Don Siegel’s film Invasion of the Body Snatchers. The 1956 black-and-white film has many scenes of characters responding to the rising issue in Santa Mira in typical, unpanicked ways, which extracts familiar emotions from my perspective of feeling alienated. The human instinct to adhere to what is familiar and make assumptions to protect one’s perspective of the truth emerges continuously.\n\nMost notably, we see before discovering the body snatching, Dr. Bennell uses typical treatments and advice for the less mentally sane to help his patients who claim their family members are not the same. For Jimmy Grimaldi, Dr. Bennell sends him off with medication and a hearty slap on the butt, instructing Grandma Grimaldi to have him stay with her for the night. For Wilma Lentz, he schedules an appointment with Dr. Dan Kauffman for psychiatric help. Though Dr. Bennell listens to Jimmy and Wilma’s worries, he fails to take them seriously. What I fear most, looking back at my memory. The trust characters in the film had when asking Dr. Bennell for help vanishes as he takes Dr. Kauffman’s word about what has happened in town the past two weeks—an epidemic of mass hysteria. Interestingly, it is odd how Dr. Bennell initially ignores the many identical worries of his patients. When abnormalities like these become increasingly common, scientific experts typically dig deeper to discover why the phenomenon occurs. However,Dr. Bennell mutes his patients’ voices, much like how mine was after the boy started crying. Reverting to treatments for those who are mentally insane reflects the lack of care Dr. Bennell takes to hear them out. But his perspective quickly switches.\n\nAs the film progresses, those with qualifications use \"logic\" to dismiss the concerns Dr. Bennell raises. When Becky Driscoll’s double in her basement has vanished, and the only evidence of Jack Belicec’s double is a spot of blood on the pool table, Dr. Kauffman concludes that the body on the pool table is the product of a murder. As Dr. Bennell and Jack try to convince him with evidence, Dr. Kauffman only responds with his reasonable assumptions: murders can leave little trace, dead bodies often have plain appearances, people can burn off fingerprints to hide their identity, and mass hysteria can cause one to hallucinate a double of Becky in her basement. If an audience member were a character in this film unaware of the body snatching and noticed the lack of Dr. Bennell’s evidence in the scene, they would agree with Dr. Kauffman. His responses are nothing less than convincing, surging feelings of uneasiness. He manages to build a plausible argument that Dr. Bennell is delusional. How can one defend oneself when one possesses no weapons to do so?\n\nIn the chapter on death, the passing of Queen Elizabeth I symbolizes the unsatisfactory nature of humans who continue to live in pursuit of evading death- chasing immortality- in hopes of finding pleasure. Before her passing, the queen commands Orlando: “Do not fade. do not wither. do not grow old.” Despite living a long life, in which the queen undoubtedly must have had myriad pleasures, she is shown to be unsatisfied with the final outcome. In initial reflection, this sentiment bewildered me. Why would she be discontent when she lived such a prosperous long life and met an end known to all? The answer did not come to me until I put myself in her position. It was not the past that would sadden me, but the prospect of a better future in which I would be absent was the demise of my happiness. Here, I began to realize the flaw of human nature which is its insatiability. Despite knowing that we are to meet a similar end, we remain dissatisfied with our current state- not living lives to the utmost. In the next section, Potter further explores the aspects of human nature.\n\nIn the chapter on love, Potter highlights the abrupt and unsympathetic aspects of human affection. Male Orlando’s quick disregard for the emotions of Euphrosyne, his loving fiance, when he grows an infatuation with another lady is evident in those aspects. Despite Euphrosyne’s devotion to Orlando, he chases Sasha- an indifferent lady. Like her, too often we have individuals whose love goes unrequited. Watching this, I wondered if it would not be more righteous if love was earnable. If one could choose whom to love? Although it may extinguish an aspect of romance in love, the number of heartbreaks reduced would be immense; any love triangles would cease to exist. Alas, that is only hypothetical. In reality, humans are imperfect with the randomness of love.\n\nIn the chapter on politics, Potter illustrated the absurdity and the lengths humans would go to justify their wrong actions. During the war between the Middle Eastern countries, Orlando is stopped from tending to a dying man by a politician exclaiming: “he’s not a man, he’s the enemy.” Additionally, in the contemporary world, politics has integrated into society at each of its levels. And humans have constantly failed to keep equality between these levels. In every corner of the globe, we deal with injustice of some sort- racism, sexism, terrorism, homophobia, xenophobia- which are then legalized by laws. It is maddening to realize the depths of suffering we may cause to others and then attempt to justify it with mere laws. Maybe if people knew the pain caused by their actions on others, some trickle of humanity may shine through. This aspect of inequality is further explored in the section on society.\n\nAlthough each chapter stuck out to me, the part about society was my favorite. In the chapter on society, I had the greatest revelation of all. I am a man and I know only a few distinctions between men and women, disregarding the physical, and biological differences. And I may be inclined to owe that to my culture but I will not do so. Instead, I wish to wonder if I was born to know neither, would I gain the ability to distinguish between each? I realized, when watching Sally Potter’s film Orlando, that men and women have essentially very little differences but it is society that teaches us how to distinguish and treat one sex from another. When Orlando switches from male to female, she claims: “same person. No difference at all. Just a different sex” but society claims her to be “legally dead.” As a male, Orlando was allowed to own land, and take part in important decisions of society but, although capable, as a woman, her all existence was taken from her unless she bore a son. Although society has improved from the times represented, the fundamental principles that resulted in these inequalities are still present.\n\nWe continue to fight for a world where each human is respected and treated as if they deserve a life and Potter’s film Orlando paves a path to do just that by pointing out the many flaws of our human society. The issues presented do not remain in the movie but apply to the real world as suggested by each judgemental glance Orlando shares with the audience- breaking the fourth wall. Watching Orlando is emotionally enlightening as you learn to understand the difficulties of many perspectives in multitudes of settings; it provided a unique opportunity for me to understand the point of view of both sexes and realize they are not fundamentally different. Although Orlando does not speak directly for our times, I think humans could learn a lot from watching Orlando . . . if they are ready to feel the shame.\n\nSo begins Polish director Krzysztof Kieślowski's Three Colours: Red, a sweeping, subtly intricate masterwork which ranks among the most complex and powerful films I've seen. The third in a trilogy of films inspired by the colors of the French flag, Red avowedly addresses the concept of fraternité—the seemingly random forces which cause us as individuals to cross paths with strangers, forming the bonds which shape almost the entirety of our lives. But through this, Red also tackles much more. It's one of a select few works of art that dares to take a grasp at the core question underlying our existence: what exactly it is—if anything—that gives meaning to everyday life.\n\nAt the beginning of the film we meet Valentine, a model in Geneva who seems to be doing perfectly well for herself. She's in a decent relationship, has a moderately successful career, and seems happy, in a general way. This, in a way, is realism; Valentine lives an ordinary life, and is portrayed such that she could be anyone, really. But all of this changes when she meets Joseph Kern, a retired judge, after hitting his dog with her car. The two interact only briefly at first, but he immediately strikes her as callous and unfeeling; she wants nothing to do with him, and the two agree that the dog, Rita, would be better off under her care. Time passes, life goes on—but eventually, by pure chance, Rita escapes in a park and leads Valentine back to Kern, causing the two to begin a sort of bond. She gradually learns of the old judge's regrets—his guilt for past rulings, his failed love life—and all the while strange parallels are drawn between him and Valentine's unknown neighbor, a young law student named Auguste. Little connections between each character in the film begin to bud, slowly at first, and then more and more rapidly until each has been driven to the character's very emotional core—much like how relationships develop in real life, often without us even noticing. But in the midst of all these coincidences and sudden change, however, Red never removes itself from reality. Instead, it walks a thin line I would call magical realism—coincidences do happen, after all, audiences will think, and it's not difficult to believe that sometimes life's randomness can just fall into place. But even still, something about how everything plays out doesn't quite seem grounded in reality.\n\nEvery shot in Red connects to this theme. The camera glides through the story with a mind of its own—at times drifting between parallel stories in the very same shot—which not only builds a world for the characters that feels whole and familiar, but also grants the film a beautifully poetic sense of intimacy and flow. Of course, nearly every scene is also steeped in varying hues of red, which traditionally represents love, passion, and fraternity. Yet strangely, upon first glance these ideas seem to be discussed rather little in the film: relationships are constantly shattered, trust is repeatedly broken, and the film overall actually feels quite lonely, with its empty city streets and emotionally isolated characters. But perhaps, Red suggests, there are other forms of love and connection—ones that can somehow be established long before two people have even met. Valentine and Auguste, two characters with distinctly warm, burgundy names, do seem destined to come together, after all. This could just be blind chance, of course, but there's a creeping sense throughout Red that some other forces may be—must be—at work. In the film's final sequence Valentine boards a ship bound for England to visit her family, but in the midst of an abrupt and violent storm the ship sinks, killing nearly everyone aboard. The only seven survivors: all the main characters from each film in the Three Colours trilogy, including Valentine and Auguste. In the closing frame, Kern watches television coverage of the disaster through his shattered garden window, at last seeing the pair emerge, shivering in their wet blankets, and briefly lock eyes. The judge's final line before Valentine departed for her journey: \"Leave. It's your destiny.\"\n\nImportantly, Kieslowski was not an especially religious man; he was raised a Catholic, but always saw God as something deeply personal—an abstract concept one ought to carefully consider, and which can be felt at a person's core whether or not they subscribe to a particular faith, or even believe in a God at all. Red follows this philosophy closely. It almost never mentions religion—and certainly doesn't argue for or against there being a God—but there is an unmistakable spirituality embedded in nearly every aspect of the film. \"The light is beautiful,\" the old judge says to Valentine in one early scene right before the room floods with a heavenly glow. Fortune, it seems, can only account for so much before it begins to bleed into fate.\n\nMore than anything, Red carries with it a sense of humility—one that allows viewers to feel that there must be something more out there, some order and reason to it all, but simultaneously to recognize that, ultimately, none of us has a clue. There's a certain comfort in this smallness, the idea that what truly matters is building connections and enjoying life, without worrying too much. In the grand scheme of things, it'll be okay if the telephone at the other end of the line is never picked up. It's not religious, but it is a sort of faith. And whether or not you believe it, it certainly is a wonderful thought.\n\nReed paved the way of using lighting in this film noir to emphasize the horrendous actions and destiny of the characters. Chiaroscuro, a type of lighting used famously by Rembrant, highlights the contrast of light and dark. Reed evokes emotions of creepiness and heavy subjects using the darkness, and in contrast uses a spotlight for the character’s faces. This technique was widely used in later Hollywood films because of The Third Man. Reed also uses elongated shadows to evoke the feeling of mystery and uneasiness in the characters, and the audience. In an iconic clip, Martins is walking the streets of Vienna at night and the light from street lamps nearby casts a shadow on the buildings—the shadows, however, are enormous, and are exaggerated to emphasize the feeling of suspicion and creepiness when he is walking in the dark. His shadow, being even longer than the street lamps, shows how great and important his character is, how his shadow takes over the streets of Vienna—one of the most iconic scenes in the film.\n\nDuring the chase in the sewer, similar lighting techniques are used. It’s incredibly dark and you can only see shadows and flashlights, but that specific gray lighting shows the musty feeling of the air. The audience is literally being kept in the dark when this chase is happening since Martins is trying to get Harry, who is undercover, to surrender. But when British sergeant Paine is caught off guard and in the open, Harry shoots him. The audience is just as bewildered and have not been expecting this death. The shadowing evokes suspense and thrill that deepen the emotions of creepiness and surprise.\n\nThe historical significance of this movie helps further understand the characters. After WWII, Vienna was torn into four sections and became exhausted of its resources. The people didn’t have any money, and were incredibly desperate. This shows the motive of Lime’s atrocities in the military hospital. To Lime, diluting and selling wrongful medication was the best and fastest way to make money, even though it had immense consequences—killing children and families. On top of the chilling use of lighting, this movie covers in depth the post-war effect on people. I was born and raised in the post-war Balkans and can relate to witnessing the post-war depression of the people. The atrocities have caused a physical and mental strain on people, and this movie shows this suffering through Lime and various background character’s stories such as Anne’s. Reed almost makes the audience feel bad for Lime at times because of this suffering post-war, even though he is a murderer and a criminal. The contrast and the tension that develops in the characters as Martins begins to unravel the mystery makes the plot incredibly suspenseful.\n\nKafka’s Metamorphosis is about two transformations: the mutation of Gregor Samsa into a bug, and the growth of Samsa’s sister from a girl to a woman. Gregor Samsa, an ordinary traveling salesman, is the sole supporter of his family, until he wakes up one morning as a large insect. Samsa’s family suddenly fears and ignores Samsa, making him compliant and aimless. Samsa’s transformation inadvertently turns his sister, Grete, from a passive girl without passions to the leader of the family. She also dedicates herself to her violin playing, emphasizing her choice to and ability to pursue art, in contrast to Gregor’s hollow career.\n\nIn La Dolce Vita, Marcello undergoes the transformation from man to creature, while Fellini himself undergoes artistic growth that mirrors Grete’s. La Dolce Vita ends with Marcello and the wealthy and famous attendees of an all-night orgy standing around a large sea creature that has washed ashore. “It insists on looking,” says Marcello. Marcello, like the paparazzi and like the audience itself, is unable to turn away from the world of the wealthy and famous. The party picks up the sea creature and carries it home to eat it, and Marcello himself is dragged away from the foreground of the screen, away from the audience, into that inaccessible world. Like Gregor Samsa, Marcello becomes complicit, loses his self sufficiency, in his transformation from man to sea creature, from author and observer to one of them. Like Grete, Fellini seemed to undergo the opposite transformation – he became self-assured and dedicated to his craft. In The Films of Federico Fellini, Peter Bondella writes: “Up to the appearance of La dolce vita, in fact, Fellini's intellectual trajectory seems to be clear: His films begin in the shadow of neorealist portraits of life in the sleepy provinces of Italy, focus upon various forms of show-business types, and ultimately lead toward the capital city of Rome and the \"sweet life\" of movie stars, gossip columnists, and paparazzi scandalmongers. After that point, Fellini's cinema turns inward toward an overriding concern with memory, dreams, a meditation on the nature of cinematic artistry, and the director's fantasies.” La Dolce Vita was a turning point in Fellini’s career, away from the neorealism that had a grip on Italian cinema, and towards art films regarding his childhood, his dreams, Italian history, and the nature of cinema. After La Dolce Vita, Fellini no longer cared about commercial success. His films became more personal and artistic, with 8 ½, The Satyricon, and Casanova. Fellini blossomed into an artist with his own style and a real belief in his work and its authority.\n\nAs the film continues, the tone darkens more as her brother struggles with epilepsy, causing fear to spread throughout the house and making a financially unstable household even more uneasy. Tragedy continues as one of her older sisters drowns, driving Janet into a depression.\n\nLater when she's in college, she abandons her studies to realize her dream of becoming a poet, and sets off to start a writing career where she moves around Europe creating poems.\n\nHowever, she experiences more tragedy as her issues with depression get misdiagnosed as schizophrenia and she is sent to a mental asylum where she is subjected to over 200 sessions of shock therapy.\n\nShe is only freed when her work is published and becomes popular. With her newfound freedom she moves to Italy meeting a new cast of characters, including a love interest who eventually leaves her, but she moves on and moves back to New Zealand.\n\nThe film has frequent time skips such as jumping from Janet's life in high school to seeing her as a fully adjusted college student in the next shot, but the shift in time always feels so seamless and I was easily able to understand what was happening right away without it feeling like the director is obnoxiously announcing what stage of life Janet is in.\n\nEven with the dark tone of the film, it never feels unrealistic and the characters feel very relatable. All of this personality and human empathy is pushed into the audience by the camerawork. The movie is filled with shots of faces shot on a handheld camera,\n\nmaking the viewers gain a better understanding of the characters' emotions and even draw them into the world as if they were a part of the story as well.\n\nThe ending of the movie left me extremely satisfied. The final shots of the reporters struggling to climb the green New Zealand hills that Janet comfortably sat upon tied the story together expertly and made it feel like a full story. We are returning to the place where the film started, but with Janet as a changed and complete person.\n\nAn Angel at my Table was a story that made me think about helplessness and start to understand what it means to be a woman. Throughout the film, her feelings are discarded, she isn't taken seriously, and she's seen as an object by those around her.\n\nFrom the elementary school classroom, the treatment of Janet by her teacher makes her feel ostracized in her community from the very beginning.\n\nAt home, she's never put first because of issues with money and her brother's condition. This has a severe impact on her mental health and shows how the situation that she grew up in put her at a disadvantage from the start, which serves as a parallel to the situation many women find themselves in, even in today's society.\n\nHer sister's death scarred her, but nobody was able to take her feelings seriously, leaving her to feel hopeless and lost.\n\nHer roommate that she was forced to stay with in London put on a front of \"looking out for her, but there was always an uncomfortable implication that treated her like that because of her gender, and because he wanted to keep control over her as a woman.\n\nThe electroshock therapy was probably the most difficult part of the film, where countless women during the time were dismissed and the only solution provided was to essentially cause brain damage to them. She is only released from the facility and given basic human treatment after gaining a reputation and following from her poetry work that almost none amount to, further emphasizing the lack of credibility that society gives women.\n\nI noticed something intriguing whilst watching Ran in regards to colour: both Taro and Jiro are warm-toned colours, red and yellow respectively, yet Saburo, the youngest as well as the most logical and defiant brother, represents the colour blue.\n\nThis cool-toned versus warm-toned battle is consistent throughout the film when later on, most of those who are in the “morally right” and “correct” are wearing blue or something cool-coloured, such as Tango, Hidetora’s main advisor and later follower of Saburo. Interestingly enough, the two other clans that are unrelated to the Ichimonji family affair and are more active bystanders are represented by white and black, which are not colours but shades. This shows their detached nature from the main story and how they are simply observing from the sidelines without getting mixed up in their colour war.\n\nHidetora’s initial silver-yellow outfit slowly becomes white and flowing as Ran progresses, symbolising the spiralling nature of his mental state, as well as grief and death. It’s almost ghost-like whenever Hidetora walks or stumbles as though he’s no longer living yet still haunting his own body. In the scene after the Third Castle was destroyed, Hidetora quietly struggles out of the burnt, arrow and ammunition-filled castle where both Taro and Jiro’s army are waiting outside, weapons ready to attack if Hidetora made any dangerous moves. Yet they move aside as Hidetora walks through them like he is Moses parting the Red Sea. He’s pale as ash and sickly looking like a corpse, yet they do not attack him. Hidetora has truly lost everything, and as he walks out of the castle gates and into the storm ahead of him, his bright, dynamic white outfit shines through the dust and fog. It symbolises death.\n\nTo even further explain this point, another prominent character who ultimately dies after being stricken with so much grief is Kaede. Her family was killed and their land was stolen by Hidetora, so her entire plot is to take revenge on Hidetora and the entire clan of Ichimonji. She starts off wearing a pale dark blue-silver, a colour of “logic,” and ends with her wearing a white, flowing dress. White symbolising death is also very common in East Asian cultures, and I believe this sort of ghostly-white appearance is intentional by Kurosawa, as in another film he directed called Dreams, there too is a character dressed in white symbolising death.\n\nSymbolism is by far one of the most important things in the film as it encapsulates both colour and space. Kurosawa expertly foreshadows the end of the film through the fool, Kyoami. He’s the foil to Hidetora, starting off illogical and idiotic then revealing himself as more knowledgeable and intelligent. In the beginning, Kyoami is a stereotypical jester character with the jester's privilege, which is the right of a jester to talk and mock freely without being punished for it. He’s protected by this privilege, just like how Hidetora was protected by his title of Great Lord and his reputation. Kyoami is loyal to Hidetora, unlike Hidetora’s loyalty to his family. There are later instances where these two are compared.\n\nOne example of a comparison of the lord and jester in the film is a scene at the very start where Hidetora requests Kyoami to make a joke. He does an act where he looks off into the distance, almost unconsciously, following something in the distance, which makes everyone else follow his gaze. Everyone else sees nothing, and then Kyoami bursts out with a comedic joke, causing almost everyone to laugh. Saburo is the only one to not find Kyoami humorous and even taunts him in front of everyone, showing more of Saburo’s rationality. Then, later on in Ran, as Hidetora slowly succumbs to his madness, grief, and guilt, he does the exact same thing Kyoami does: he looks off into the distance while everyone follows his eyes. Except, this time, he starts screaming instead of laughing, his fears eating at his bones, and falls back. He is accompanied by Kyoami, the fool, who witnesses his former Great Lord fall from his honour, and this comparison of the two really shows Kurosawa’s incredible symbolism.\n\nThese two scenes create an implication that Hidetora is now the fool, no longer respectable and has fallen from grace. The fact that Kyoami watches this happen with a sensible and intelligent mind is a complete flip from the beginning of the film.\n\nThe Taipei explored in Rebels of the Neon God is a large and bustling city, full of life and energy. In the day, cars and mopeds battle for domination of the busy streets. Night-time brings bright neon lights and crowds of people at restaurants and skating rinks. Regardless, the characters never seem to be swept up into this tide of vitality and vibrancy, maintaining a somber air throughout most scenes. As soon as Hsiao-Kang or Ah Tze enter into their private spaces and shut the door behind them, the viewer is overcome with an atmosphere of despair. The camera frequently pans to the water flooding Ah Tze’s apartment, receding and then slowly seeping back up, a feeling of helplessness setting in when he gives up trying to clear the drain and just accepts that he’ll have to wade through water to even reach his bed. Smooth camera transitions between characters as they lay curled up on a bed or grudgingly go through the motions of hated everyday responsibilities highlight their shared depression. Although they adopt a cheery facade when around each other, the camera strips them of this mask, chronicling their private fatigue and despondency. Throughout the film, dialogue takes a backseat as the scenery and cinematography convey the constantly shifting mood. Ming-liang Tsai capitalizes upon the vivid color and atmosphere of the city, artfully creating high contrast with the silence and blandness of lives that seem completely removed from their surroundings. It is made abundantly clear that this disconnect is an underlying cause of their melancholy reality.\n\nRebels of the Neon God is full of complex and emotional relationships, often characterized by a lack of communication or mutual understanding. Although they live together, Hsiao-Kang and his father have a very distant and superficial relationship. Initially, this isn’t due to lack of trying on his father’s behalf. An early scene shows him trying to bond with his son, suggesting they go see a movie together. When they buy fruit to eat at the market, he wordlessly shovels half of his onto his son’s plate. These actions are touching, but the scene turns sorrowful as Hsiao-Kang remains silent, not willing to form a connection. This coldness between them makes it especially strangethat Hsiao-Kang is willing to abandon everything to seek revenge for his father. Theirrelationship takes a turn for the worse when Hsiao-Kang drops out of cram school,culminating in his father locking him out of the house. His life spirals downwards as he gets cut off from his family, wandering the streets of Taipei alone and unnoticed.\n\nAnother relationship central to the film is the romance, if it can even be called that, between Ah Tze and Ah Kuei. When they meet, they initially behave like carefree teens, laughing and exploring and drinking a little too much. Frustration grows as she clearly desires a committed relationship from him, but his emotional unavailability leaves her feeling used and unimportant. The viewer is constantly faced with scenes of Ah Tze abandoning Ah Kuei, from standing her up on a date to repeatedly leaving her after they’ve slept together. As the camera pans out from her sleeping figure to the emptiness of an unfamiliar room, we know the misery we will see on her face when she awakes. Yet, she keeps returning to him, despite the fact that he is clearly not willing or able to give her the love that she deserves. In a way, their relationship is plagued by similar issues to the relationship between Hsiao-Kang and his father. Resentment and frustration are allowed to build as they do anything but talk about their emotions or the problems they’re facing. Any level of communication would be beneficial, but instead they struggle forwards alone, pushing away everyone around them. Again and again, these failed relationships highlight the theme of complete disconnect between these characters and the world around them.\n\nRebels of the Neon God masterfully explores the futility of a life lacking purpose. Although some characters attend school or have jobs, none are following their passions, and each day only drains them further. The only instance of anyone showing any drive is during Hsiao-Kang’s quest for vengeance. When Ah Tze shatters the side mirror of his father’s car, he is seemingly possessed with a desire for retribution. It starts off with a quiet sort of anger, the scenes imbued with a sense of creepiness as Hsiao-Kang obsessively stalks Ah Tze throughout the city, constantly appearing in the corner of the camera frame like a ghost. This obsession is all-consuming, and yet Hsiao-Kang’s face doesn’t betray a single shred of emotion until he succeeds in his revenge. As Ah Tze discovers his vandalized moped, scratched and covered in brightly colored spray paint, Hsiao-Kang watches from above. He is overcome with glee, jumping up and down on his bed while grinning and cackling like a madman. Revenge gives him a goal to achieve, and allows him to finally exert some element of control over his own life. Regardless, as soon as his convoluted mission is over, he is back to square one. Just like everyone else, his narrative is predominantly devoid of purpose and meaning, overwhelmed by the sheer tedium of his daily routine.\n\nThe ending of Rebels of the Neon God is unsatisfying. There is no grand finale, no heartfelt resolution. As the wins and losses even out, no character truly ends up in a better place than where they started. Hsiao-Kang succeeds in exacting his revenge, but at the cost of his family and potentially even his future. Ah Tze and Ah Kuei may find happiness as a couple, but Ah Tze’s and Ah Ping’s criminal activity has caught up to them. They are all still in Taipei, stuck in the endless drudgery of a life without any sort of fulfillment. Through sharp setting contrasts, interpersonal relationships, and character motivations, Ming-liang Tsai creates an almost tangible sense of despair and depression caused by a lack of purpose and connection. If I had to summarize the message of this movie, I would call upon the words of Oscar Wilde: “To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all.” Rebels of the Neon God is so compelling and evocative because it feeds upon what I believe is a commonly held fear — that we will be so busy battling through our lives that we will forget to live them.\n\nThrough what must have been heroic maneuvers to secure financing and space for his vision, director Marcel Carné built an immense Boulevard to frame his story of a woman so beautiful that men’s entire lives warp around their desire for her. The Boulevard signifies the era when such public spaces were new in Paris, circa 1830, exploding with street life reminiscent of but much bigger than its medieval antecedents. Great crowds, a constant flow of coaches and horsemen, blocks of sideshows throng the scene. One of the attractions is a completely naked woman to be viewed for only a few centimes. That she is immersed in a barrel of water, showing only her face, neck and sculptural shoulders, is unknown until the gullible are inside the peep show. A handsome aspiring actor makes the rounds of little theaters, pushing for a place with operatic flair and unflagging ambition. A sinister gangster plies his trade in theft, fencing, perhaps a murder here and there. A mime, so disrespected he performs on stage outside, not meriting the price of admission, slumps in his shapeless white garments, observing the surges of people through heavily painted eyes. These are the characters we will follow for the rest of the film. The woman, now clothed in a fetching dress, attracts the actor, who woes her with poetry and unmistakable lust. She brushes him off with magnetic charm, then enters the gangster’s storefront, apparently familiar, where he bores her with philosophical tirades explaining his misanthropic life and proclaiming indifference to love. She leaves, he follows, they pause to listen to a barker promoting a play. A fat gentleman sidles up to her, the stereotype distraction, while the gangster picks his pocket. He bawls accusations at the woman, attracting a gendarme who shouts for a witness. The mime awakens. His pantomime of the woman, the victim, the pickpocket and the crime entrances the crowd and relieves the woman of suspicion. She tosses him a rose. His fate is sealed.\n\nThe mime Baptiste is Jean-Louis Barrault, one of the greatest of the 20th century and surely the best such performance ever in film. The beauty Garance is Arletty, whose affair with a German officer during the Nazi occupation of Paris must’ve been a factor in Carne’s ability to get this film made in the middle of World War II. (It also earned her a prison term for collaboration after the War.)\n\nGarance’s lovers - respectively the menacing crook, the histrionic actor and later an insufferable Count of the realm - play their roles to perfection. None is able to capture her love although sex is readily available.\n\nSYMBOLISM IN ANDREI RUBLEV\n\nby Alexandra Hontalas-Adams\n\nAndrei Rublev was an icon painter and saint, who lived in Russia during the fourteen hundreds. Though in Italy the Renaissance was flowering, this was a time the Russians were stumbling through the dark ages suffering from cruel and savage war lords. Rublev had a unique view on what Christianity was based on and how it started.. He believed that the crucifixion of Christ was something like a well staged ad for Christianity. If thrown into modern times, Andrei Rublev would be more at home with the Unitarian church then with his native Russian Orthodox church.\n\nThe production of this film was stopped many times by the then communist government of Russia. It took almost ten years to make. The Russian government would not show it for many reasons, one of which was that they were suspicious of something they couldn’t understand. They were right to be nervous because the content of this film examines the true meaning of art and realistically shows many aspects of life in this bloody period of Russian history. Especially in the relationship between war lords, and in the struggle of the peasants who are horribly punished for clinging to their pagan ways by the quickly growing and harsh Russian Orthadox world. In this world joy is the work of the devil and famine common place. This was not the Russia that the communist government wanted to be portrayed. They wanted to clean their slate of the blood and pain and forge a new Russia, where brotherhood was second nature, and class did not matter. They were trying to wash away the social barriers that had made life a dark and never ending catastrophe. This film, in their point of view, was like opening a long festering wound.\n\nThis is one of the few films that has as many layers as an onion, so that each time you see it you notice a very different batch of fresh ideas and themes.\n\nOne beautifully illustrated example of symbolism is in the prologue of the film. The first image is one of a primitive hot air balloon against a white cathedral. As people prepare for the balloon to be sent up, you see people on horses riding toward them, menacing, and armed. We follow the man that we gather is going to fly on this balloon. As the man runs through a corridor we see a black horse through a doorway trotting away form the threatening men. One of the most stunning dolly shots that stays in your mind forever, is one that moves down from the window view, past perfectly placed boats, to the ground where the threatening men have reached the balloon. In our first bitter taste of the cruel and blunt brutality, the man holding the balloon’s rope, has his eyes put out. Slowly floating above the cathedral the man calls down to the followers as he pushes away from the white wall of saints that are carved on the cathedral wall. Although it is a great image it is easy to overlook because of its subtlety. Then we are flying with the man who laughs merrily thinking he has escaped his Christian pursuers. The sound is prefect—breathing— as air escapes the balloon. You see earth and water in the landscape blend together and the sky is reflected in the water. This is a thread that is woven it all Tarkovsky’s films. He enjoys playing with the idea of earth, water, sky, and fire. The balloon loses air and falls down to the ground.\n\nIn this scene Tarkovsky remains true to reality. The flying man does not speak noble last words or die praying. Instead he is afraid and calls for his companions. Then the truly unforgettable image of this prologue appears: the same black horse seen near the beginning has fallen, then slowly rises up, and trots away while strange, eerie music plays, giving it an unreal quality. What does it mean? Does the horse symbolize all the grief he has, now leaving him as he dies? Does it symbolize his life slipping away? Does it symbolize his soul? Or does it symbolize him living on in memory? Symbolism is in the eyes of the beholder, and you must answer it as you will.\n\nThe horse is one of the symbols that is used throughout this film. Fallen horses, rising horses, dying horses, horses throwing off Tartars, horses galloping, and finally horses peacefully standing in the rain for no apparent reason. Many people ask, why horses? The film is epic, like some endless journey, and the horse seems an appropriate symbol to move its themes forward.\n\nIn one of the early scenes our main character is seen leaving a cathedral to go off with his friends. The birds are singing and you hear the sound of animals. It starts to rain, and the three companions seek shelter with a group of peasants that are being entertained by a lively jester playing a drum and dancing. When the three monks enter all is silence. The jester places a cup on his head. Why, who knows? The monks sit in the back of the shed and the camera moves all the way around the shed at the ragged clothes, and starved faces. The same other worldly music is played, because Andre had been in a monastery his whole life this would have been the first time he has seen people that suffer and have less then he even has. When we go back to the monks, one named Kirill has gone. Then outside a pack of peaceful horses, flee as a group of horsemen ride to the shed, fling open the door, and arrest the jester. The jester comes out bare chested, in the rain, and they knock him unconscious and ride off. Now because this is the first time that Andre has seen the church police in action, it is very important. For although many may not be aware of it, the church at this time thought that jesters, who the people loved and who gave them laughter in a cold gray world, were sent by the devil and needed to be punished and tortured as criminals. Kirill, one of Rublev’s friends, returns from outside and hurries his fellow monk out ignoring their questions. We learn later in the film, it is he who has betrayed the jester.\n\nThe next segment dogs are used as important symbols. The episode starts with an alarming scene, in which Kirill walks by a large crowd of people watching a man being tortured. Kirill goes to a famous icon painter and urges him to come to their monastery and ask him to be his assistant. At the monastery you see Kirill washing his hands and lighting a torch although it is day. You see the fire reflected in the water, more of the mixing of the elements theme that Tarkovsky loves so dearly. We hear dogs barking, as Kirill hears that there is a messenger. He runs outside. It is dead of winter—you can see the monks emotions in their breath that comes out in clouds. Filmmakers have tried to capture this effect by having people smoking in their movie, but by using their snowy breath, it accomplishes this much more effectively. The message is from the icon painter who sends for Andrei Rublev to help him paint a cathedral. Kirill is furious. He feels betrayed. He says that he will leave the monastery, go out it to the real world. The monks in black garb (sharply contrasting with the white snow) try to stop him, but he does not listen and angrily leaves the monastery. Kirill’s dog runs after him, but Kirill beats him savagely, and leaves him for dead. What is this trying to say? That we like to take things out on our loved ones? That sometimes the ones who are there for us pay for their loyalty? The image of the bloody dog laying in the snow is unforgettable.\n\nThen in the scene between Andrei, his young assistant, and the other icon painter each person is seen connected to the earth. For example, Andre is tracing roots with his finger, the assistant has mud on his face to cure bee stings , and the other icon painter has ants crawling on his bare feet. In the end the young assistant finds a dead bird and lifts its wing. These symbols suggest that you most be connected with the earth to become a great artist.\n\nThis next scene deals perfectly with Andrei’s feelings toward religion. It shows what looks like an Easter pageant, in which a man playing Jesus is crucified, with the voice over of Andrei. Andrei proposes that maybe those who crucified him, loved him. As the poor victim walks to the hill in the snow, the terrain looks like dripping blood. While he is nailed up on the cross there are horses in the background prancing—one of the few times they look happy.\n\nThis next segment is light hearted, but at the same time seriously symbolic. Andre leaves his traveling companions to investigate some pagans celebrating Midsummer’s Night, dancing and performing strange ceremonies. Doves fall from the trees, and the pagans play music. One of the more comical images in the film is Andrei’s robe catching on fire. He watches a couple making love, escapes capture and then at dawn returns to his friends who could never understand what he saw. This is very well symbolized in the image of one of the boats that was uses in a pagan ceremony crashing into one of the monk’s boats.\n\nIn “The Last Judgment” sequence time has passed and Andrei is supposed to be painting a cathedral depicting the last judgment. Andre thinks he can not paint this subject matter because he does not believe in scaring people into submission . We see him with one of his friends who wishes him to do the last judgment. They stand in a field of flowers by a road which divides. As the friend argues that Andrei should paint what he is told, a rider on a black horse appears in the distance, coming toward them. Andre says that he must as his duty not paint the last judgment. At that moment the rider rides past them, and vanishes up the other road. The rider becomes a symbol for Andrei resolve, and the road the two directions Andrei must choose from.\n\nBack in the cathedral, Andrei decides that he will paint a great feast. You see the princess splashing him with milk. He tells her that it is sacrilegious to spill milk. The royal children are spoiled and run through the unpainted cathedral screaming and being brats. The lord of the city’s head man is speaking to the masons who say that they are going to go work for the lord’s brother, who he hates.\n\nWhat follows is one of the most brutal scenes in the film. The masons, who are clad in white (symbolizing their innocence or purity) are moving through the forest and come a upon the lord and his henchmen. The lord jabs out the nearest mason’s eyes, and his men chase the screaming masons wildly through the forest. The lord’s men leave the blinded masons stumbling through the trees screaming and weeping in pain. One young boy who was left unharmed sees a flask of milk– the milk flows in to the nearby stream.\n\nDoes this represent their souls, going back into the earth? For we know that they work by their hands and must see to perform their trade, and so will die. Or is Tarkovsy just trying to mystify us? To leave us with questions?\n\nIn the same way you see Andrei angrily splashing black paint on to the pure white walls of the cathedral when he hears about the assault. A young woman walks in and is very distressed at the paint and, crying, tries to rub it off. What does that splash of paint mean to her? It’s a bit like all the symbolism in the film. You know it’s important, but it’s frustrating because it isn’t easy to interpret or understand. You think about it long after the film is over.\n\nAnother shining example of symbolic imagery is a scene in which three monks stand under a tree in the rain. Three figures, a tree, the rain. Is this another visual connect to the elements. Earth, water, nature?\n\nIn “The Raid,” the theme of pointless violence and death is played out. The jealous prince invades his brother’s city by joining his forces with those of the Tartars. More imagery with horses! As the prince tells the Tartar prince his plan, his horse starts getting nervous, and kicking. When the Tartars start to come down to the town by bridge one of the horses bucks the Tartar off into the river. And more symbolic acts to come! The lord tells of having to kiss his brother as a sign of friendship, then in a flash back we see this meeting, the brothers hug and kiss but then we see their feet for a brief moment. One presses his foot on top of the other’s shoe. Later this image of pressing down is used when the prince pushes his brother’s headman’s face in the snow with his foot. One of the more startling images is a cow in flames and the owner screaming hysterically and very confused. You also see the realistic fog of war. A lot of time is spent waiting: for walls to be broken, for the other side to attack, for a cathedral door to be rammed open. One of the key images is of a bewildered horse falling down the stairs and being killed by a spear, silently. Does the horse represent the innocent victim, or the people of the city? Maybe Russia itself? No matter what it represents, this is one of the unforgettable images that stay with you.\n\nAn image that will be embedded in my mind forever is that of Andrei’s assistant, shot by an arrow, falling in a stream with a cloud of milk around him. This trail of milk was used earlier when the masons were blinded. What does it mean? It occurs before or after violence. Does the milk represent the soul slipping away? Or of what we first we take as a baby from our mother’s breast being given back to the earth?\n\nInside the cathedral you see people in terror, praying. After the Tartars have broken through the door, they subject a bystander to torture in hopes of pumping him for information as to where the gold is kept. After he does not tell them what they want to know, they pour hot lead down his throat and tie him to a horse to be torn apart. The horse refuses to move till it has been whipped many times. Is this yet another symbol? Among the dead you see a young mad girl, braiding a dead woman’s hair. This image is odd and alarming because it seems so out of place.\n\nIn the last episode, “The Bell,“ we lose Andrei and are introduced to a new character—a boy who is given the task to make a bell for a cathedral. This was a Herculean task under the best of circumstances, but it was unheard of for a teenager to undertake it. In one image as he is digging the casting pit he finds a root and follows to its source, a nearby tree. He falls a sleep under it. Is this meant to show that because his dead father was a bell caster he is finding his roots?\n\nAndrei is not totally absent form this segment. He is in the background of many key moments. Watching the process of the bell making is amazing. The mass of people needed and the enormous amount of time it takes is extraordinary. Near the end film the two artists, Andrei and the boy stand together in a bleak landscape. Andrei reaffirms his faith.\n\nIt becomes clear that Tarkovsky wanted to divulge relationships between pictures and events with new and organic images. Tarkovsky believed that deliberately leaving his images open-ended would allow their meanings to continue to grow in the mind of the viewer, and refused to limit imagination with easy explanations that would manipulate the viewer. Tarkovsky had said, “What I’m interested in is not symbols, but images. An image has an unlimited number of possible interpretations.” Tarkovsky was using what is called poetic reasoning. “In my view poetic reasoning is closer to the laws by which thought develops, and thus to life itself, than is the logic of traditional drama.“\n\nWith that in mind, one can go over the recurring images in the film.\n\nThe first one that comes to mind is that of birds. The concept of flying has been haunting human minds for centuries now, but never in the same haunting way as in Andrei Rublev. The opening scene is of a man betraying all human laws and flying. Alone this could be a fairly simple image, but when you parallel it with the other images of birds in the film—including a constant rain of feathers inside a cathedral, and a disfigured swan, and any number of falling white birds—the idea of this man flying takes on a whole new level, particularly the fact that he fails. The birds in this film represent something pagan, or ritualistic. The fact that this man fails to fly could represent the downfall of all that is pagan. There is also a chicken that appears above the boy, the bell maker’s son, in the last sequence called “the Bell.” The bird is framed in a black window over the boy’s shoulder right before then men come to take him away. Though this chicken is nothing pagan, it’s docile attitude might represent something else: the end of this boy’s life on the farm, and the beginning of something big.\n\nAnother prominent symbol in Andrei Rublev is snow. Not only does the element give the film making a very “black on white” style, but it also symbolizes martyrdom of some kind. This is pure Tarkovsky to relate snow with martyrdom, a very unlikely match. Yet several times in the film people and things are seen eating snow. The first time snow is eaten is by Jesus Christ himself minutes before being crucified. The next thing to eat snow is one of the monk’s dogs, right before the dog fight scene in the “Charity” section. Minutes later the dog is attack by a Tartar’s dog. And finally snow is eaten in the Charity scene again. The deaf mute girl is shoveling handfuls of it into her mouth only minutes before being carried away on horseback by the Tartars.\n\nFinally, there is the symbol that Andrei Rublev is famous for, the horses. Hundreds of horses of all colors and builds are seen through out the film. Tarkovsky makes a special point in his “poetic reasoning” to give each scene with a horse image a separate meaning. This first thing that’s important is the color of the horse. White horses are used in much different circumstances than black ones. Black horses bring up darker, more immoral ideals—all of the Tartars ride dark horses—where as white horses give the sense of purity. The most poignant example of the color difference is in the Crucifixion scene where in the front with the peasantry are six black horses, and alone at the top of the hill with Christ on the cross is a single white horse.\n\nAn extremely dramatic use of horses in the film is to associate them with the violence of man. During the Raid sequence, where a town is attacked and its inhabitants massacred, countless horses are slaughtered, the most stunning being, of course, the black horse that falls down a flight of stairs and then is stabbed to death with a lance. This single image stays in the mind long after leaving the film, and its meaning makes the viewer contemplate everything about life that seems unfair and horrible. There are also scenes where the horses regain their strength, as if coming to life again, and others where they buck their riders off. What all of this “horse business” comes down to is that Tarkovsky is able to change the meaning of his symbols in the running narrative of the film, while juxtaposing the images as well.\n\nThe next major scene featuring the symbolism of birds is “The Holiday.” Four or five birds are seen falling from the dark trees as Rublev treks through the forest towards the Pagan rituals. He knows that sacrilege and sin is there waiting for him, but his curiosity pushes him forward. The falling birds shouldn’t be interpreted as a lack of faith of the Pagans, as they had no faith to begin with. Rather, the birds should be interpreted as the crumbling of the strict form that Rublev’s faith expresses itself in. Though he won’t be truly awakened to his true understanding of his own faith until the end of the film, the birds here symbolize the beginning of the end for his severely limited “Monk’s form” of Christianity.\n\nIn case the audience has not picked up on the constant theme of birds and their symbolism of faith and Christianity they are reminded very clearly when the stonemason remarks twice how the carvings of the Prince’s church are like the song of birds, light and beautiful.\n\nIn the most dramatic scene featuring the symbolism of birds, two large geese are seen flying/falling down from the Cathedral roof into a huge fire and total chaos below in “The Raid.” These birds symbolize the Prince’s loss of faith as well as a general assault on Christianity and God Himself, as we can be led to believe by the preceding shot of the remorseful and regretful Prince with his men stripping the gold from the top of the church.\n\nIn an interesting and insightful scene, towards the beginning of “The Bell” a bird is seen flying across the screen, staying level and not losing altitude. Below it the bell casters are digging the casting pit. Here the bird symbolizes not a loss of faith but rather a progression of it because people are coming together in unity to glorify God.\n\nThe viewer also knows a master is at work with the film The World of Apu. Satyajit Ray’s last in his trilogy on the early life of an Indian orphan seeking freedom and artistic fulfillment barely hints that this quest mirrors the struggle of the entire country to throw off British rule. The story focuses entirely on Apu’s confrontation with the small events that define and shatter and rejuvenate the soul of every individual life. He pawns precious books to pay his rent because he would rather starve and write than work the menial jobs from which he recoils. Exhilarated by a little food and companionship, he shouts poetry into the night and expounds, in the middle of train tracks, his vision of a novel. He’s going somewhere. The promise of arrival is signaled by his first success: a short story accepted.\n\nHis first stop on the road of life is utterly unplanned. Apu accompanies his friend to a wedding in the country where he is drafted to become the groom after the promised one appears insane. Overwhelmed by his new responsibilities, he is soon overwhelmed by love and then by grief when the exquisite Arana dies in childbirth. Refusing any contact with the living baby, he wanders in spiritual and geographic wilderness for five years, scattering the fragile pages of his neglected novel and working only to save money to leave the country. When his friend finds and berates him for abandoning his son, Apu responds as he did when the same friend begged him to marry the girl who will otherwise be cursed by the stigma of aborted marriage. He is not that conventional person, he will not be a father any more than he thought he could be a husband. But he cannot resist the pull of an elemental human tie. His son is a killer of birds and caster of stones, furious at his own orphanhood. His pout bears a searing resemblance to his mother’s. The boy ultimately succumbs to the fantasy of reunion with his father in Calcutta, to whom his “friend” will take him on his shoulders. The film ends with Apu beaming for the first time in many years while the face above his slowly relaxes into its own journey, about to start.\n\nAn example of this is the scene when Marcello and Emma are fighting in Marcello’s car. At first Emma won’t get back into the car, but then she won’t get out: “‘Where are you going, stupid? Come here,’ [says Marcello.] ‘No,’ [says Emma.] … ‘Get out of this car!’ [says Marcello.] ‘No!’ [says Emma.]” Marcello wants to be rid of Emma’s “aggressive, sticky, maternal love,” but he keeps coming back to her anyway; he leaves her on the side of the road, then comes back in the morning and ends up in bed with her. It is obvious that their love is unhealthy, but the scene is constructed hilariously. By the end of the scene, the viewer is not overcome with the anguish of Marcello and Emma’s relationship, although the sadness in the scene is clearly felt.\n\nMarcello is a writer at heart, but he is too obsessed with “the sweet life” to realize it or to become a writer. The scene at the very center of the movie where he is working on his book is the one scene where he is trying to write for himself, putting his talents to use—but he writes hardly anything. Marcello is wasting the only time he has given himself to be a writer, but the scene is also hopeful: at least there is a brief interval where he tries to do what he is meant to do. He compares the serving girl, Paola, to an angel: in fact, the whole scene is a kind of heaven, like the eye of a hurricane. Even though Marcello writes next to nothing and goes back to his regular life fast, there has been one moment of truth for him.\n\nThen at the end of the movie, Paola shows up again. She’s gesturing to Marcello across an estuary, making typing motions, reminding him of his true calling. But the wind is too strong; he can’t hear her. He is too far off the path of his writing to be able to interpret her signs. But after he turns away, Paola smiles. The movie ends like this, with a long close up of the little angel smiling. It ends with a remembrance of the small, good, hopeful time when Marcello was trying to be himself. Paola is still smiling after him, smiling in the face of how sad it is that he can’t see what he should be doing.\n\nThe arrival of American actress Sylvia marks the beginning of the “second episode,” and his talk with Sylvia on the top of St. Peter’s dome would be the first time they’ve “met.” There are ups and downs in the events following, but mainly, The High would be the party Sylvia dances at, and the overarching Tragedy would be when the sun rises, and the water in the Trevi Fountain gets turned off; it effectively broke the movie-esque spell of love and romance Marcello and Sylvia were in, prompting them to leave.\n\nThe third episode is scattered throughout the film, but mainly centers around Marcello’s relationship with the wealthy intellectual Steiner. The Encounter is at a church, where Steiner plays the organ for Marcello. He later invites Marcello to the gathering at his house, where they listen to sounds of nature recorded on tape—a homage to the fact that this is all being portrayed in a movie—natural scenes put into manmade recorders and distributed. While it wasn’t the most “high,” the party would count as the second step. The Tragedy is, obviously, the suicide of Steiner after he killed his two children, because he didn’t wish for them to experience the ugly side of the world. Marcello was deeply disturbed at his best friend’s suicide, but goes to pick up Steiner’s wife while paparazzi swarm around them.\n\nBetween the parts of the Steiner episode, the Madonna-sighting would be the fourth. Marcello never actually “meets” the children, but the audience does, and The High swiftly follows The Encounter in the rain, as the children run around, pointing at empty places, claiming they see the Madonna, and the crowd follows them in an uproar, wanting the blessings of the Virgin Mary to themselves, regardless of their religious teachings, ultimately representing human selfishness. They even stripped the tree that was said to have sheltered the Madonna with its branches. Emma, Marcello’s lover, did so as well, and prayed that she be given Marcello’s sole affection, because she felt him drawing away from him. The Tragedy of the immigrant child being trampled to death after being brought all this way for a blessing from the Madonna ends this episode, with the funeral held at dawn.\n\nThe fifth episode is centered around Marcello’s father. They quickly Encounter at the nightclub where the audience first saw Marcello, and The High takes place at the Cha-Cha-Cha Club, as a request of Marcello’s dad. There they encounter Fanny, the father’s female companion of the night, then return to Fanny’s house. Marcello’s father gets sick, however, and requests to be taken to the train station, where he could take the earliest train and be home by ten. The Tragedy occurs when Marcello tries to get him to stay, because they never spent any time together, but his father leaves anyway, in a drunken stupor.\n\nThe party at the castle of the aristocrats (the sixth episode) and later the party at the beach house (the seventh episode) do not have particularly clear Encounters, Highs, and Tragedies, though the Encounter could be counted as the audience’s first meetings with the different characters. The Highs, however, are hard to decide, for separate reasons. The sixth episode because while the party was a high itself, it’s hard to say whether the wedding proposal from Maddalena is the High (and her silence subsequently the Tragedy), or the ghost-hunt at the abandoned mansion, along with Marcello’s night with the other woman the High (and their cold parting the Tragedy).\n\nThe seventh episode was basically a High entirely in itself, but it’s hard to determined whether it’s the High from the audience’s point of view, or Marcello’s point of view. The audience would say the entire party and the strip tease was the High of that episode, but for Marcello, it would probably be when he was encouraging the drunken orgy from the partygoers. The Tragedy that ends the movie overall, though, is the death of the fish-beast on the beach, and how it stared even in its death. This scene mirrors the opening sequence of the statue of Jesus moving over the city, something manmade watching from above, and the fish from nature at its finest—the ocean—ending everything by watching from below. It gives the movie sequences a sense of symmetry, and ultimately combines the idea of being watched over.\n\nOne thing that definitely stood out is the girl Marcello met at the cafe on the beach. He said she was beautiful, and asked why she smiled in response. Later, she appears at the end, and her smiling face closes the movie. While each episode demonstrates an alternative life that is presented to Marcello, the Tragedy in each also marks the darker side of each life, such as the perfect life of Steiner that ended with the death of almost his entire family. The girl—the odd one out of the sequence—represents the ability Marcello possesses to free himself from this fruitless search for a better life—his writing—and her last smile, something pitying and understanding, marks Marcello’s lost into the dark world.\n\nA strong motif of religious imagery runs throughout the movie. It pits pagan images against Christian images. Christianity is shown in the helicopter- jesus, being imposed from above and not communicating with the people down below. In the episode where the children “see” the Madonna, it is portrayed as extremely manipulative. Paganism is shown in Sylvia, with a connection to animals and childish delight for life. She embraces the media, and in turn they give her “offerings.” This version of Paganism is portrayed as stupid and naive- she can't escape an abusive relationship, come up with her own answers to questions or even stay on one train of thought for more than thirty seconds.\n\nAnother idea that the images of religion bring up is celebrity. The media exploits religion the same way they do famous people in the Madonna scene. The crowd acts in a mob-like way- trying to get a handful of the tree before anyone else. They are also shown raising celebrities to the level of gods- the wild dance where they spin Sylvia, the baptism in the fountain, the Paparazzi constantly following them around to document their every move. Fellini asks us- Have gods become mere celebrities in our world today? Or are celebrities the new gods?\n\nSteiner is the most important person in the movie besides Marcello. To Marcello, he represents the ideal life. He has a loving family, an artistic lifestyle, and he encourages Marcello to pursue serious writing. When he kills himself, Marcello seems to lose his drive for finding meaning in life. This brings up the conflict of whether it's good to idolize people or not- after that, Marcello has no ideal life to strive for, only money."
