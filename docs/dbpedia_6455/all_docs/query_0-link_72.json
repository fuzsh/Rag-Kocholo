        "text": "In the second half of the 1950s, American films about “delinquent youth” took West Germany by storm. Although these films were not screened in East Germany, the still open border between the FRG and GDR allowed young people in both states to see these films. Many adopted American clothing styles and music in both Germanys. Two films, the West German production Die Halbstarken (1956) and the East German production Berlin–Ecke Schönhauser (1957) addressed “delinquent youth” in the German context and became quite popular. The article compares the competing images of femininity in both films, which linked the problem of “delinquent youth” to consumerism, pop culture, and “weak parents,” but portrayed young women very differently. While consumerism in the West German film was in a gender-specific way linked to femininity, the East German film linked consumerism to a class society and displaced it to the West. Contemporary film reviews and press treatment of main actresses reflected these differing attitudes toward gender and consumption.\n\n37 In his analysis of the film, Weidauer does identify Sissy as representing the dark side to Freddy's tendency toward goodness. As he points out, it is common in these teenage films for “the contradictions experienced by the adolescent protagonists … [to be] represented by two separate characters.” See Weidauer, “You are Too Square, I Need To Straighten You Out,” 86."
