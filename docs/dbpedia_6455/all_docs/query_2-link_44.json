        "text": "Many people today are aware of who the Keystone Girl was. They may not, however, be aware that she existed only between mid-1912 and late-1915, or just a fraction of Mabel Normand’s career. These were, nonetheless, the nascent years of the U.S. film industry, and indeed, of Hollywood , although Hollywood was not, in 1912, associated with the movie industry. A lot changed between 1912 and 1915, both for Mabel and the film business. So, let’s begin our tour of what Mabel and her friends called in the 1920s, ‘the good old days’, and we’ll begin in mid-1911.\n\nIn 1911, some of the elements of the later Hollywood were already in place. There were a small number of professional film directors, and an equally small number of actors earning the unbelievable sum of 40 and even 50 dollars a week. Most of these performers, such as Mary Pickford, had come from the stage, and their earnings suggest that producers were coming around to the idea that the business would see unprecedented growth. Towards the end of 1910, a small dark-haired girl, with no acting experience, had wandered into D.W. Griffith’s Biograph studio in Manhattan, daring to think she could cut it among the theatre people. She watched, learned and listened to the stories going the rounds, about stars, like Florence Lawrence, that had blossomed under the Klieg lights, down on East Fourteenth Street. Mabel Normand rather liked what she saw and heard, and determined that she wanted to be a star. A rather arrogant determination, considering her present company. The main weapon in her armoury was her charm, which she used in a disarming way, and which endeared her to everyone, including the haughty theatrical veterans. Unfortunately, the rug was pulled unceremoniously from under her, when the Biograph left for six months filming in Los Angeles. Only the theatre people went west, leaving Mabel high and dry. Unbeaten, Mabel went straight to the Vitagraph in Brooklyn, where she seems to have blown in like a storm. She did a few dramas, but soon the top comedian John Bunny, noticed the dusky-eyed, vivacious Mabel, and co-starred her in his films, to the detriment of veteran comedienne, Flora Finch. Mabel became the talk of the town, of the world, and of the Biographers wintering in L.A. In all probability, this went to Mabel’s head, for she was young and intense, a dangerous cocktail, or so it seems, for after some outrageous and unladylike behaviour around the studio, she was fired by Quaker boss, J.S. Blackton. A personality clash with director Harold Reid (father of Wally) at the Reliance studio pointed Mabel back to Biograph, where D.W. Griffith, spotting her coming through the door, took up his wages book, and entered her name into its pages. Everyone was glad to see Mabel, especially the likes of Mary Pickford, who hated wearing dark wigs to play vamps and ‘bad girls’, parts which she hated. Only occasional clipped texts filtered out concerning what went on in the studio, down through the following years. In 1925, Mrs D.W. Griffith put the statements together, added her own memories, and rolled everything up in a remarkable book called ‘When The Movies Were Young’. For all its flaws, it remains the only record of the early U.S. film industry, seen through the eyes of the actors and actresses. There is one actress central to Mrs Griffith’s story, Mabel Normand, a girl with no acting experience, who took on the veteran theatricals at their own game. Let’s leave Mabel, surrounded by her admirers, for the moment.\n\nD.W. Griffith ruled in those days, and was smart enough to admit anyone that walked through the door. He needed many extras, but there was always the chance that an acting ‘gem’ would turn up. For those that got no work on a particular day, there was always the consolation of the infamous Biograph sandwiches. Top actors, for the day, dined with Griffith on steaks, which upset those relegated to ‘atmosphere’, such as the awkward country boy, Mack Sennett, who was unhappy about his demeaning roles, and the parlous state of Biograph sandwiches. Mrs Griffith observes that Sennett was a constant groucher, but adds “Now ‘tis said he is worth five-millions!” Mack was, then, an outsider, someone who could never penetrate the burgeoning Mabel Normand ‘set’. Her admirers were the male heart-throbs of the day, and the girls who were later to be the brightest stars of the coming Hollywood. To them “Mabel was the most beautiful girl in the world…. daring, reckless, and generous-hearted to a fault, she was like a frisky young colt that would brook no bridle.” (Mrs Griffith) As Mary Pickford told it in 1916, Mabel was the action girl of the studio, harbouring no fear of high cliffs, swirling rapids, or bucking broncos. Some girls, like Dorothy Gish and Gertie Bambrick adored Mabel so much that they actually wanted to be her. They thought they could act out the part of being Mabel, by acquiring the latest Parisian dresses, downing some strong spirits, and hitting the town. This, Mrs Griffith states occurred in L.A. and she recounts that the pair were rounded up by Mr Griffith and Dell Henderson, after a long search, and returned them to their chaperones. In L.A. in 1912, Mabel was lodged with chaperones, but soon escaped them for an apartment with Alice Joyce. Alice in those days was an old friend of Mabel, an older girl, who had gained the distinction of being one of the earliest film stars. There can be no doubt that Alice, being worldly-wise, a runaway in fact, had a great influence on the way Mabel developed. If the Biograph girls looked up to Mabel, then Mabel looked up to Kalem girl, Alice. Among those actresses working at the Biograph in 1912 were, apart from those already mentioned, Blanche Sweet, Jack and Lottie Pickford, Dorothy West, Florence Le Badie, Dorothy Davenport, Jeanie MacPhearson, Owen Moore, Mae Marsh, Claire McDowell, Florence Barker, Grace Henderson, Kate Bruce, Vivian Prescott, and Kate Toncray.\n\nMack Sennett was a guy that could never get on with the girls, according to Mrs Griffith, but one day he was made director of the Biograph comedy unit, and he needed a leading lady that could handle comedy. Mabel was the only real comedienne at the studio, and Mack needed her, but he did not approach Mabel directly. He went to Griffith and asked that Mabel be freed from dramatic duties, whenever he needed her. To Mabel’s horror, the genius agreed. She was happy doing drama, and had no intention of doing more than an occasional comedy. She was a victim of her own (comedy) success. From what we can gather from what Mrs Griffith said, the relationship between Mack and Mabel was not a good one. Mack resorted to feeding her with diamonds — necklaces, bracelets and rings. After a while, Mabel’s regard for these things began to dwindle, as a whole host of men were plying her with sparkly things, and Mrs Griffith notes that one day she threw a diamond necklace back in Sennett’s face. The value? $80 or $2,000 in today’s money. Mack needed to up his game, for movie big-shots were about to start up a new comedy studio, and Mack was to be the director. In recent articles, we have already discussed the Mack and Mabel story in detail, and so we will leave the pre-Keystone shenanigans, and say a little more about the Biograph environment.\n\nIt is often said that Biograph under D.W. Griffith was the incubator for the later Hollywood. Not strictly true, for there were other studios involved, but for Mack and Mabel, this was clearly true. Griffith was a great director, but also a great organiser of people. Mack watched, learned, and committed to memory, the master’s methods. The early Keystone studio would be a microcosm of Griffith’s Biograph. Furthermore, Mabel learned her trade under Griffith, but her ‘Giffithian’ methods would later clash with those of Mack Sennett, when the latter decided to add his own, some would say, warped ideas. Mrs Griffith would later imply that the Biograph was some kind of egalitarian utopia, where everyone was equal, and everyone mucked in, moving and painting scenery, regardless of their status. However, it is clear that the players were fiercely competitive, and any ‘egalitarianism’ was enforced by the studio bosses on the players, via Griffith. No person was ever allowed to become a ‘star’ and leading parts were shared among the actors on a rotational basis. Beyond that, the studio never released the names of actors. In the 1920s, Mabel said in an interview that Griffith, when he was reviewing rushes, would call the whole company to the screening room, calling out “Everyone come and see a great artist at work.” On that day Mary Pickford might be the great artist, while on another, Mabel, then Blanche Sweet. Nobody knew who the next leading lady would be, but Griffith would give a book to an actress to read, in order that she might familiarise herself with the subject matter. The company knew, straightaway, that the person carrying a book would lead in the next picture, and there would be much grumbling and discontent. Things could become very heated, and agitated on occasions. By early 1912, Mabel, Mary and Blanche were the main suspects for leading parts, but when Griffith proposed a film called ‘Man’s Genesis’, the three refused to appear in it, as the story involved wearing a grass skirt, which would have made the film close to pornographic in those days. Consequently, Griffith gave the leading part to a young girl that had been hanging around the studio. Her name was Mae Marsh, someone with no acting experience, and the big three were consequently furious. When Mae was also given the lead in ‘The Sands of Dee’ they black-balled her, and made her a social outcast, only relenting when her career spiralled downwards in the 1920s. So much, then, for egalitarianism. (Photo below: Charlie Chaplin in 1914, with Peggy Page as a cave-woman in a grass skirt. It’s not surprising that Mabel did not appear in this film).\n\nMabel had been one of the top actresses at Biograph, so it is a wonder that she threw in her lot with what Sennett called, “a ragtag concern with five actors, one camera, and no money.” Sennett, of course, was being somewhat disingenuous, for the new Keystone studio was set up by the highly respected Adam Kessel and Charles O. Baumann, and so was adequately funded, and with good prospects, if Sennett managed the operation well. Some people assume that the $125-a-week turned Mabel’s head, and indeed, this made her the highest paid actress in the business. Certainly, Mabel calculated how many Parisian frocks she could buy with the cash, but her primary concern was the furtherance of her career, which she managed with determination and no little amount of guile. As we have seen, men were a perennial source of diamonds for her, but she never leant on them, never committed to, or married any of them, which was the traditional way that actresses had got along. This makes the notion that Mabel was in love with Mack Sennett, a bit of a nonsense, but as this was discussed in a recent article, we will leave the subject there. Mabel, of course, was central to Biograph, that is the people of Biograph. She made parties swing, but as Charlie Chaplin put it :\n\n“She was light-hearted and gay, a good fellow, kind and generous, and everyone adored her.”\n\nMary, Blanche and others tried to dissuade her from leaving with the madman Sennett. The whole idea was insane, and would surely fail. However, the most important thing for Mabel, was that she would be the only leading lady, so no worries about the in-studio competition. She rather liked the idea of being queen of the studio.\n\nKeystone began in New York, but within weeks, if not days, the five middle-aged men, and one teenage girl boarded the train for Los Angeles. Now, we have to say here, that the Los Angeles of 1912 was not the Los Angeles of today, and not because there were fewer vagrants. It was then, clearly, part of the Wild West although the City Fathers had grandiose plans for the future. The place was lacking in cohesion, however, for L.A. proper was the downtown district, although surrounded by small villages, such as Hollywood, Glendale, Pasadena and a host of other small habitations. The City had incorporated these places, but the people in them remained fiercely parochial. Pasadena was, perhaps, the odd one out, for it was a place for wealthy easterners to over-winter – no dogs, peasants, or ‘movies’ please. Places like Hollywood and Glendale were populated by the descendants of the pioneers of the mid-west, who, finding the governmental machine rolling ever closer, had upped sticks, and shifted further west. They were fiercely independent, and did not like strangers poking around, who might, after all, be the taxman. Especially, they did not like movie people, who they considered to be scum from the gutter. Griffith and others had tried to secure interesting locations, but the owners usually greeted them with shotguns. When an owner was offered money, he often spat on it, and threw it back in the genius’ face.\n\nThis sort of sets out the scene of the far-off place that Mabel came to in 1912. There was little to do in L.A. compared with New York, and we might mention that the city was the homicide capital of the U.S. in those days. Not that Mabel was in danger from the villains, for she was most decidedly in danger from the local populace that could spot an actress from a hundred yards. Gaudily dressed and with an air above their station, they were often abused and spat upon in the streets, and on the street cars. The women all thought that the movie girls were after their menfolk, and many an actress got a well-swung handbag around the head in those days. Mrs Griffith once recorded that, while Biograph was shooting a mild love scene on location, a woman came up to Mary Pickford, and slapped her around the face, screaming “You little whore, how could you do such disgusting things, and wear such disgusting clothes?” Finding digs was well-neigh impossible for no-one would rent to the ‘movies’, but there were a few hotels that would rent rooms to the acting folk. Santa Monica became a mecca for actors, but only because renting was possible there, and at cheaper prices.\n\nThus, was the world that Mabel found herself in. Her only friends were the few actors around her, all middle-aged, greying, and mostly married. No doubt she became melancholy away from her life and friends in New York, for we have information that Mack Sennett took to wining and dining her at the Athletic Club every night. This probably kept Mabel on track, but also served to keep Mabel under surveillance, and ensure that she did not make a run for the east. As Mabel later recorded, it was work, work, work, from sun-up to sun-down, and no-one worked harder than Mabel to get Keystone, on its tumbledown lot in Edendale, off the ground. Initially, they had no electricity, no made up roads, and no sewers, which meant no flushing toilets. Mabel was later to say that she cried herself to sleep every night.\n\nThere were other small studios in the area, but these employed mainly local people, the easterners being transient. Mabel probably prayed for the Biograph and Vitagraph trains to come west once a year, so she could meet up with old friends. Old friend Alice Joyce, also made the once a year trek with her Kalem studio, and then things would get a little lively around L.A. Depression set in, no doubt, when June came along, but eventually the New York studios began to come west on a permanent basis. The actresses came in dribs and drabs, suitcases in hand, and there was only one person to look up, Mabel Normand, now crowned ‘The Queen of The Movies’. Mabel was wonderful, knew everyone and everything, and she became the centre of the emerging Hollywood scene. Mabel was kind and generous, but was also the inventor of the wild Hollywood party. Years later, Blanche Sweet would explain the wild party phenomenon in this way:\n\n“It came about, because the locals kept acting people at arm’s length, would not interact with them, so the actors found their own amusements.”\n\nMabel helped Blanche, when she first came permanently out west, and Blanche repaid Mabel by putting her up, when she came back to L.A. from Sam Goldwyn’s New Jersey studio. Mabel stayed for around a year, and was finally asked to leave by grandma, who was probably fed up with the strange, nocturnal hours that Mabel kept. Like most actors, Mabel never thought of buying a house, as no-one was sure if they would remain working in California. Mabel, it seems, was not domestically inclined, and loved hotel apartments, where everything was, so to speak, on tap. In 1915, however, she took over a mansion on a hill overlooking Hollywood, one of the first to do so, if not the first. In all probability, she was pressured to take on the house, which was undoubtedly rented, by her new bosses, Triangle Film Distribution. Not long after, she departed for New York, and the house was given up for a Manhattan apartment.\n\nFrom 1912 to 1915, Mabel had an increasingly up and down relationship with Mack Sennett. There were several reasons for this. Firstly, buoyed up by the success of the studio, Mack began to forget about his egalitarian roots at Biograph, and began to act like an Ottoman Sultan. He began to lord it over those that had helped create Keystone in the early days, treated newcomers to the studio with disdain, and would never renew their contracts, even if he lost money. Mabel had become a ‘mother confessor’ at the studio, despite her young age, and would fight against Sennett, if she thought someone was being put down. The boss hated to give pay rises, and it was Mabel that secured several raises for a certain Englisher named Charles Spencer Chaplin. Mabel was not afraid of Sennett, for she knew where he came from, and knew he was, basically, a ‘jerk’. “I must have made that man millions” Mabel once said, drawing attention to the fact that it was by her hard work and loyalty that Sennett had got where he was. It does seem, also, that Mabel thought she had been deceived when she first took up with Keystone.\n\nIt seems possible that there was a promise made by Kessel and Baumann that Mabel would be allowed to continue with dramatics, within the comedies, and that eventually Keystone would produce full-on dramatic films. This was all very slow in coming, but in 1914 came an opportunity for Mabel to take the initiative, and bring drama, tragedy and melancholy into her films. The catalyst arose when Charlie Chaplin came to the studio. Chaplin was a quick learner, but although he was feted by Kessel and Baumann, he was much disliked by Sennett and the rest of the company. Mabel was the type that took in waifs and strays, and she realised that this strange, though good-looking, little man was someone worth collaborating with. In the past, Mabel’s attempts to ‘showboat’ in a dramatic way, elicited complaints to the management from her co-actors. With Charlie, she could do what she wanted, as the little guy had no political power at Keystone – his masters were 3,000 miles away in New York. Mabel was altruistic, but maybe also a control freak, if a comment by Chester Conklin is taken into account. “Charlie” He said “Was Mabel’s prize.” Indeed, Charlie was paraded around town by Mabel, but although Charlie was a staunch misogynist, he accepted this, as a way to get on. Other benefits included access to Mabel’s dressing room, and trips downtown, whenever the pair tired of working, something Charlie would never be able to get away with on his own, and especially as it involved ‘stealing’ a company car. Were they lovers? In all probability, yes. Mabel, of course, was linked to a whole string of men, during her Keystone years, and Charlie was but one of them.\n\nThe Chaplin interlude lasted but a year, and Mabel said she shed tears when he left. Unsurprising really, for she was signed to Sennett, rather than Kessell and Baumann, who had held Chaplin’s contract. This was to be a bitter-sweet year, during which Sennett stamped his authority on film content, and brought in girls to distract Mabel, and presumably, put her off her dinner. They were known as the Bathing Beauties. However, Hollywood was marching on, and Mabel marched with the burgeoning film colony. Now under the umbrella of the, seemingly, wealthy Triangle company, Keystone and Mabel received massive publicity coverage. Part of this publicity was the aforementioned movie mansion on Melrose Hill. In the summer came Mary Pickford to see the pile for herself, and she wrote a piece in her weekly newspaper column, in which she waxed lyrically about the place, and congratulated Mabel on her success. Well she might have congratulated her old friend, for in movie contest, run by Photo Play, Mabel collected tens of thousands more votes than Mary to take the honour of top comedienne. Meanwhile, Mabel starred in various films, but became best known for the ‘Fatty and Mabel’ pictures, which were soppy, silly, but hugely popular. There were some nonsense going on between Mack and Mabel by the Fall of 1915, although it seems they were no longer in direct communication.\n\nMabel was unhappy that Mack was promoting actresses over herself, and that these were essentially lowly paid, but jumped-up extras. From Mack’s point of view he could dispense with the very expensive Keystone Girl, and replace her with well, a bevvy of cheap Keystone Girls. Mabel was finished, or so it seemed, but Triangle called Mabel, Arbuckle and a small company to Kessell and Baumann’s New Jersey studio, to make films, as a kind of gigantic publicity stunt. Mabel left Los Angeles as the Keystone Girl, but when she returned, three months later, she was not the Queen of The Movies, but the Empress of Hollywood, installed in her own Tinsel Town studio, with her name in five feet high letters, the first of her kind to have that honour. The days of the Keystone Girl were over — for good.\n\nBibliography\n\nBehind the Screen by Samuel Goldwyn (1923).\n\nKing of Comedy by Mack Sennett (1954).\n\nLove, Laughter and tears: My Hollywood Story by Adela Rogers St. Johns (1978).\n\nWhen the Movies Were Young by Linda Griffith (1925).\n\nMabel Normand: A Source Book to her Life and Films by Wm.

For her part, Mabel said in 1924 “I must have made that man millions.” No love lost, then, between The King and Queen of Comedy, but who was responsible for whose success? Well, strangely enough, we could end the argument here for in 1919 Sennett made a will in which he leaves all of his property and personal possessions to his mother, Catherine Sinnott. Then he adds:\n\n“If my mother predeceases me, I give and bequeath all the property provided in this paragraph to MABEL NORMAND of the City and State of New York who collaborated with me during the early years of my work, and contributed by her efforts to my success.“\n\nSo, things aren’t quite as simple as they seem. In 1919, Sennett was able to say that Mabel collaborated with him in the early days, and contributed to his success, but was later to say something a little different. Late 1919 was a strange time, for Mack had heard that Mabel’s current producer, Sam Goldwyn, was in serious financial trouble, and that it might be possible to snatch Mabel from Goldwyn’s clutches. Mabel, then, was back on his mind. He was, of course, riding the crest of a wave of success, with his Bathing Beauties and peculiar, funny men. There was, nonetheless, something missing. His was the ‘Funny Studio’, a crazy, crazy place, but without a huge star, he could not make films that would give him the kudos to hold his head high among the big drama studio bosses, the Laskys, the Zukors and the Mayers. Mabel had been one of the original big stars, still hailed as such in Hollywood, but she had also studied and played in drama under the movie genius, D.W. Griffith. 1920 will be the point we are aiming for here, but first we must dissolve scene back to 1907.\n\nIt was some time in 1907 that a Canadian country rube, Mack Sennett, walked into the Biograph studio, New York, looking for work, at just about the same time as a southern gentlemen by the name of D.W. Griffith. Griffith quickly moved up the ladder, while Sennett did not. Griffith was made director, Sennett was scrabbling for bit parts. Mack was clumsy in both movements and manner, so that few people, especially leading ladies, wanted to act alongside him. By 1910, he was getting somewhere with comedy roles, just about the time that a dusky-eyed, dark-haired girl walked into the studio, looking for fame and dinner. Her name was Mabel Normand, and everyone was stunned by her unique looks, and her personality that made her glow brighter than the most blond of blonds. Mack wanted to get to know her, but he knew he could never penetrate the star hunks and heart-throbs that always surrounded her from day one. Anyhow, he was hopeless with girls, but on location the athletic Sennett ran after-work massed cross-country runs, and nobody could keep up with him, except one small, dark-haired girl, that could run like the wind, and vault the highest of five-barred gates. Back at the hotel, bass-singer Mack would serenade the assembled company, incidentally finding that young Mabel was also a gifted piano player. Was there nothing the girl could do? Well, she could not sew a doily, but she was a fine horsewoman, a strong swimmer, and fearless cliff-diver. Mack took note of the dusky Mabel. If he ever got his own studio, well……\n\nUnfortunately, Mabel was not on the list to go west to California for the Biograph six month sojourn. As Mack, Mary Pickford and co. boarded the west-bound train, Mabel headed to the Vitagraph in Brooklyn. Out in Los Angeles, the whole company were hearing of a new comedy sensation, Betty, making films for Vitagraph. One evening they got to see ‘Betty’ in action in a downtown L.A. movie theatre.\n\n“Oh, my god, it’s Mabel!” Someone blurted out.\n\nMack took a double-take – it was her alright, but she was a star act, one of a select three actresses, at that time. In his book, Mack states that he had been in love with Mabel, and was devastated when she did not come out to L.A. However, in her 1925 book ‘When The Movies Were Young’ Mrs Griffith states that Mack was not keen on girls, and girls were not keen on him. He was, nevertheless, a keen student of Mr Griffith, and understood that silent motion pictures revolved around the female, rather than the male. There are two reasons why this was important to Mack at the time. Firstly, he had just begun talks with big-shots Kessel and Baumann about starting a new comedy studio, while around the same time, he was close to being made director of the new Biograph comedy unit. Now he positively ached for possession of the new sensation, Mabel Normand. He knew she could launch his career skywards, and perhaps he really could get possession of this precious treasure. Immediately, he sat down and penned a letter to Mabel, declaring his undying love for her, and attached a little poem, stolen from a newspaper column. Would he get a reply? Strangely enough, Mabel’s reply arrived two weeks later, in which she thanked him for the lovely poem, saying it was the “most beautifulest” poem in the whole world. She signed the letter “Your Girl Mabel.” A fabrication by Sennett, naturally, as the use of the (non)word ‘beautifulest’ is designed to show Mabel as naive, and dumb, perhaps even semi-literate. Furthermore, Mabel was a relatively young girl, catapulted to fame, and might have found amusement in signing all letters to fans “Your Girl Mabel.”\n\nThe Biograph company returned to New York in the summer of 1911, and were soon surprised to see Mabel walk through the door. Mabel had been fired for some unladylike behaviour at Vitagraph, and Griffith took her on, right away. It was Vitagraph’s loss and Biograph’s gain. The genius put her into drama, but Sennett, now comedy director, immediately demanded a share in the body and persona of Mabel. In other words, he wanted to use her in comedy, on request. Griffith had to agree, but by her later account, Mabel was furious, as in no way did she want to have anything to do with Sennett, the rube with two left feet. In the end, it seems that Mabel did very well, with a foot in both camps. She continued with her previous action-girl image, by making films like ‘The Diving Girl’ and ‘The Squaw’s Love’ but was also starred in moralistic dramas, like ‘The Mender of Nets’ and ‘Her Awakening’. Sennett tells of wooing Mabel with milk-shakes on 5th Avenue (where else?) although Mabel had clearly passed the milk bar / bobby-soxer stage.\n\nOn the 4th January 1912, the full company of the Biograph arrived in Los Angeles. The young actresses were lodged with chaperones, although many of them gradually drifted away to lodgings. Mabel went off to stay with a young Kalem actress called Alice Joyce, then the nearest thing to what later became known as a Hollywood star. This gave her freedom to do what she wanted, for she was an active girl, and not the scatter-wit that Sennett painted her to be. A spin-off of this, was that Sennett could not get to her after working hours. There came the day, though, when Sennett needed to speak urgently to Mabel. Charles Baumann was in town, and about to clinch the deal with Sennett for the new comedy studio. Mack had promised to bring several prominent comedy actors with him, which was fine, but Baumann rested the deal on the acquisition of the talk of the town, Mabel Normand. “No problem” Said Mack “I can bring her along, in fact she is my girlfriend.” Baumann’s daughter, Ada, probably scoffed at the latter, but if Sennett could deliver, then the deal was clinched. The whole future, then, of film comedy in the United States, rested upon the signature of one small, dark-haired girl. Sennett was manic, he had to bring Mabel to Baumann. Mabel would have been evasive, non-committal. As a young girl, she might have been excited at the thought of being sole leading lady within a new studio, but as the now shrewd, and older young woman, she no longer wore her heart on her sleeve. If she wanted advice, well she had Alice Joyce, three years her senior, a ‘runaway’ who’d made it to the top by sheer effort and clever manoeuvring. In all probability, she told Mabel “Don’t commit, keep your options open.” No doubt, Mabel went along, met Baumann, and had some girl-talk with Ada. Maybe she signed a letter of intent, just about worthless in those days. The main thing is that Sennett would stand to be made or broken on the whim of Mabel.\n\nThings became hectic back in New York, when in Mack’s rush to make films for Biograph, Kessel and Baumann decided it was time to exchange contracts. His men, Ford Sterling, Henri Lerhman, Fred Mace and co. were ready to jump ship. Not so, Mabel. Her friends were adamant, the whole scheme was sheer madness, and would surely fail. Mary Pickford told Mabel of her experiences with IMP, a new studio that bombed, leaving her broken and dispirited. Mack responded by showering Mabel with diamonds, which Mabel took without committal, but one day she’d had enough of Mack’s pestering and threw a $2,000 (today’s money) bracelet back in his face. In the end, though, she agreed to meet Kessel and Baumann, and hear them out. Mabel was hustled into the wise-guy’s Longacre (Times Square) office, where she was sat in an overly high chair, her feet swinging clear of the ground by several inches. The bosses’ desk was on a raised dais. This was the old trick of making Mabel feel like a schoolgirl, confronting the school board commissioners. Mabel wasn’t phased, and ‘ummed and ahhed’ as the pay offers rose to ever greater heights. When the offers hit $125 a week, Mabel snatched up the pen and signed.\n\nIn his autobiography, Mack says he did not understand why Mabel chose to go with a new concern that had five actors, one camera, no studio, and no money. He is right in implying that the Keystone company was unlikely to succeed, but only if it did not have star acts. Keystone had two such acts, Ford Sterling and Mabel Normand, and we so must assume that success was, kind of, pencilled in. Ford had been a long-established clown, and everyone loved him. His leading lady, Mabel, had been adored and known by her work at Vitagraph. Only actors that had been at Vitagraph and a few other studios, were known by name. Mary Pickford, Blanche Sweet and most of the Biograph company, were unnamed and unknown, except by those that recognised them from their stage performances. Mabel brought credibility and even a ready-formed fan-base to Keystone, but what did Mabel gain from the exercise? Well, the $125 a week made her the highest-paid actress in the business, but more importantly, she would be the sole leading lady, meaning she would not have to fight for roles with dozens of equally ambitious actresses. The question is, was this enough? The answer is probably no, and if Mabel did not fully understand why, then her friends at Biograph would have told her. Keystone was a dedicated comedy concern, and she would have no chance to use her dramatic skills, so that she would soon be forgotten as a ‘heavy woman’. The later Keystone films prove that Mabel was not immersed in slapstick, and although a central pivot in the films, she was not actively involved, generally, in butt-kicking, clubbing or pratt-falling, although she did occasionally bite people. Such activities would have damaged her reputation as a dramatic artist. We must imagine that Mabel demanded, and received, some assurance that there would be occasional strong storylines, and opportunities to use her skills. In fact she might have even been promised feature-length dramatic pictures. What Mack was leading to, in the above-mentioned extract, is that Mabel did it all for love – of him. In ‘When The Movies Were Young’ Mrs Griffith makes it clear that no girl would ever have anything to do with Mack Sennett, and so it is unlikely that there was any love between Mack and the most popular girl at the studio. Admittedly, there is evidence that some people, from the early days of Keystone, believed that Mack and Mabel were an item, although neither Mack nor Mabel implicitly implied this was the case. For the sake of brevity the possible reasons for this error are explained in the Footnote.\n\non that subjectIt is clear that a certain situation had developed at Keystone, whereby Mabel was not just regarded as an actress, but queen of the studio. She had far more say in the way things ran than the average girl of her age, and some suggested that she had a share in the company. This was incorrect, but some of the bad things that happened later, would not have happened if Mabel had been a shareholder. Being young and foolish at the time she signed for Keystone, she had not thought of demanding a share in the company. When Charlie Chaplin happened along, in early 1914, he found a studio that seemed to worship and run to the whim of a mere girl. Mabel seemed to have a lot of sway over Mack Sennett, which caused Chaplin to think they were in an amorous relationship. In fact, Mabel was the king-pin of the studio, and as a Griffith-trained actress, she brought prestige and kudos to what would have been a mediocre movie producer. Chaplin’s reaction to Mabel’s reign at Keystone was covered in a previous article, and so we will be brief on that subject.\n\n1914 On\n\nIt is clear that by late 1913 that Mabel, now known as the ‘Queen of The Movies’, was a little unhappy that good dramatic roles, in semi-comedies, were not coming through. Sennett sought to placate her, by making the film ‘Mabel’s Dramatic Career’. Not exactly dramatic, it showed that the studio was ready to relaunch Mabel. This would not be easy, as although Mabel was adored at the studio, many were secretly concerned at the direction she taking some films, and told Sennett what they thought. After a difficult start with Chaplin, he and Mabel began to collaborate on films. Being the new boy, and not particularly liked, Charlie was not in a position to argue with Mabel. As a consequence you will see, in their joint films, Mabel getting very dramatic and Charlie getting more into slapstick, although sometime they cross over. The Charlie and Mabel pictures were very good for Keystone, but Mabel wanting more, kept demanding feature films. Eventually, a feature was shot, but Charlie and Mabel were not the stars. While Charlie was side-lined with a role he didn’t like, Mabel had the chance to play three versions of the same character, and acquitted herself well. By the end of the year, Charlie was gone, and now Mack Sennett began to assert his authority. He put Mabel with Roscoe Arbuckle together to do cheap comedies that, nonetheless, were big money-spinners. He forgot all the promises of drama made to Mabel, and began to turn the studio into a ‘funny farm’ where odd-looking guys, and wobbling Bathing Beauties roamed the lot. By mid-1915, he’d taken full control – it was almost as though he was punishing Mabel for the Chaplin interlude. Things got very strained by the end of the year, and we might suggest that on the lot, pro-Mabel and pro-Sennett factions developed, with the newcomers going along with Sennett, and the old stalwarts backing Mabel. The whole studio would have blown apart, if Keystone’s new film distributors, Triangle, had not got Mabel, Roscoe, Minter Arbuckle, Al St. John, and a few others out of there. The day after Christmas found the small company on the eastbound train, heading for the Triangle studio in Fort Lee, New Jersey, for a loan period of three months. For Sennett, it was a chance to regroup and set his plans out, without interference from Mabel and her allies. On the other hand, he was undoubtedly concerned that Mabel might never return. In brief, he was not so confident that he could go it alone, minus the girl with the ability to turn bad films good. Nevertheless, he continued to build up his army of Bathing Beauties and skew-eyed actors, although he certainly had some sleepless nights.\n\nIf Sennett had expected a Mabel-inspired coup, then he turned out to be right. In March 1916, the errant company arrived back in Los Angeles – minus Mabel. Mack had his Packard Twin-Six, at the San Bernadino station, together with a posse of photographers, in order to meet Mabel. Had she gone on to L.A? “No” Arbuckle told him “she’s still out east, and she ain’t coming back.” Mack didn’t have time to faint, a press guy was under his nose “What have you got to say about Mabel Normand signing for Mutual?” Mutual? Mack knew nothing about Mabel signing for Mutual, but the journo waved the telegram in his face. Mack had plenty to think about on the fifty-plus miles journey back, and Pickles the studio cat made a quick escape, as Mack stormed through the gate, where he found another telegram, this time from Charles Baumann. This read something like the following:\n\n“HAVE RE-SIGNED MABEL N STOP NEW COMPANY FORMED MABEL NORMAND FILM CO STOP NEED\n\nYOUR STUDIO FACILITIES STOP”\n\nMack replied:\n\n“GOOD WORK SAVING MABEL STOP I CAN SPARE PART OF MAIN STAGE FOR MABEL CO”\n\nNew reply from Baumann:\n\n“NEED YOUR NEW STUDIO HOLLYWOOD”\n\nObvious reply Mack\n\n“HOW MUCH RENT ARE YOU PAYING?”\n\nBaumann:\n\n“NO RENT BUT WILL GIVE YOU 25% OF MABEL N CO STOP DETAILS TO FOLLOW”\n\nSo, the deal was done. Mack’s new studio had cost $100,000 (2.5 million today) but the thought of making some big bucks appealed to him. However, Mabel smelled blood, and demanded the studio be carpeted throughout, with pot plants and fresh flowers everywhere. She wanted a dressing room to seat 25 people, set in a garden, and a marble bath, just to finish off. Crowning the studio was Mabel’s name in five feet high letters, the first of her profession to have that honour. Although Mabel had her own studio, she was never to have political influence at Keystone again. After making one film, Mabel left her studio to join the new Goldwyn concern. When she returned to Sennett, she kept a wall between herself and the King of Comedy. Mack gave her everything she wanted, and tried to recreate ‘the old days’, but it was too late. In a kind of masochistic way, he probably longed for the old fights, the arguments, the tense encounters. Eventually, of course, they parted company, and in no amicable way.\n\nBringing It All Together.\n\nThere is no evidence that Sennett created Keystone by himself, and Mabel was instrumental to his success until 1917. He received a huge boost of prestige when Mabel’s blockbuster, ‘Mickey’ was released in 1918, by which time she was working for Sam Goldwyn. Mack’s success after 1917 was entirely due to his own efforts, but he soon realised that, without Mabel, he was stuck with the ‘Funny Farm’ image. His reacquisition of Mabel in 1921 did result in increased kudos for The King, but with Mabel no longer being a political power, she considered herself a ‘floating’ actress. She would only sign on a film-by-film basis, and would not tie herself to the Sennett image. Mabel cut all ties with Sennett in 1923, and although he had stars come and go, his studio never again had a figurehead of the like of Mabel Normand. In his autobiography, Sennett pines “Why did she leave me? I could have made good films for her, better than any other man.” Probably, he missed the point.\n\nFootnote:\n\nThere is a theory that the Mack and Mabel love story came about due to a peculiarity of the Law. Mabel was, in legal terms, a minor in 1912. Under the recently passed Mann Act, it was made illegal to carry a minor (or any female) across state lines for immoral purposes., and in 1912, film-making was still, to some extent, regarded as immoral. In her book ‘When The Movies Were Young’ Mrs D.W. Griffith makes it clear that all girls were allocated chaperones, by Biograph, and express permission obtained from parents to take their daughters off to California. Early Keystone consisted of five middle-aged men and one underage girl, so there was no person that could act as chaperone. Mack and Mabel could have got married, and made things legal, but it seems clear that they did not wish to do that. They could, however, have simply gone to the parents, saying they were engaged to marry, and would they give them their blessing. We can be sure that, if the parents agreed, then Mack got a written affidavit to carry with him to California. Mack, indeed, did tell of a trip to Mabel’s Staten Island, during which he gave Mabel a cheap engagement ring. We know there were later repercussions, when Mack and Mabel’s parents queried why, after three years, there had been no wedding. During those three years, though, Mabel had been publicly associated with a number of men.\n\nBibliography\n\nKing of Comedy by Mack Sennett (1954).\n\nLove, Laughter and tears: My Hollywood Story by Adela Rogers St. Johns (1978).\n\nSunshine and Shadow by Mary Pickford (1956).\n\nWhen the Movies Were Young by Linda Griffith (1925).\n\nMabel Normand’s Own Life Story by Chandler Sprague.

If we want to be specific, then Minta Arbuckle (Durfee) claimed the first two, while Stan Laurel claimed the latter. In some ways he was a braggard, but it is also possible to view him as withdrawn, reserved, and even anti-social. These articles are mainly concerned with his first leading lady, Mabel Normand, and it just so happens that it is their relationship that gives some indication of Chaplin’s inner self. We might start, though, with what Mack Sennett said about Charlie, but Mack was very evasive about what he truly thought of anyone. The exception was D.W. Griffith of whom he said “Griffith was the person to realise that he was a genius.” We could clearly change the Griffith in the sentence with Chaplin, for indeed, Chaplin did think he was a genius, and like Adolph Hitler (with whom he shared a birthdate), this feeling coloured his outward personality. Chaplin had been the star of the Karno Music Hall troupe, where his fellow performers found him conceited, arrogant, and, as stated above, bordering on the insane. We might also say that women found Chaplin very alluring, a seemingly sensitive guy, with an air of the bohemian about him. His second wife, Lita Grey also found him sensitive and passionate, even though he treated her with disdain, and conducted an affair with actress Louise Brooks in New York, while Lita was in Los Angeles having their first child. Note that, in his autobiography, Charlie forgot to mention Louise, and also that he’d once had a wife called Lita Grey. This then, is the Charlie Chaplin that turned up at the Keystone Studios at the back end of 1913.\n\nCharlie Chaplin first met Mack Sennett in around September 1913, backstage at the Empress Theatre, L.A. where Charlie was making one of his final appearances with Karno, before moving on to Keystone. After a few words with Charlie, Mack took him outside to meet Mabel, who was waiting on the sidewalk. Mabel was just a little afraid of theatrical people, at least those she did not know. Mabel and Charlie’s introduction was a little awkward, as neither of them were good at first meetings. The theatre’s most eligible bachelor met the movie’s most eligible maiden, and nothing happened. Both seem to have been tongue-tied, and looked down at the ground, shuffling their feet. Mack broke the ice, and suggested they go for a meal at a restaurant, and off they went in “Mack’s glamorous race car. In the course of that meal, Charlie became aware that Mack was looking at him quizzically, and suddenly blurted out that he did not think Charlie was suitable, as he looked too young. Mabel sprang to Charlie’s defence, and said that she thought he could easily make up to look older. Charlie was twenty-three, and Mabel twenty-two, although everyone thought she was nineteen. It is possible that Mack noted some ‘atmosphere’ between and, as Mack states in his book, his biggest worry was that some svengali of a dude would run off with his star-of-stars. Mack might not have been swayed by Mabel’s protestations, but by some strong words from his over-bosses, Kessel and Baumann, who’d actually signed Chaplin. It seems clear, despite what Mack Sennett thought of Chaplin, Charlie was looking forward to working with Mabel, and vice versa.\n\nWho was the Charlie Chaplin that walked into the Keystone studio at the tail end of 1913? Well, he wasn’t the Tramp, that’s for sure. Chaplin was dude, a ‘swell’, a little guy cultivating an aristocratic way of speaking. The former reject from the slums of London wanted respect, and recognition of his genius. People like Music Hall star Arthur Dando, and the mothers of some of the girls he had taken up with, thought he was someone to be scoffed at rather than hailed for his genius. His first meeting with Kessel and Baumann buoyed up his confidence, and Mabel seemed to be attracted to him. Sennett’s attitude was a problem, and so much so that he twice went to the studio, without entering. The King of Comedy’s dislike for Charlie was clear, but a Mabel film, ‘Mabel’s Dramatic Career’ released after he’d met Sennett, which ends with him trying to shoot a villain that had stolen Mabel from him, might have revealed a more sinister side to Sennett’s personality. However, Charlie’s concern that he might have been killed before he even got started in pictures, was somewhat dispelled, when Sennett phoned him to find out why he hadn’t arrived at Keystone. Chaplin was, of course, shrewd enough to understand that Kessel and Baumann had probably wired Sennett, telling him to get the Limey started in pictures. We are also shrewd enough to guess that Charlie had contacted K and B, informing them that Sennett was being a little ‘anti’.\n\nFeeling self-assured, Charlie strode through the studio gate, where Sennett met him, and briefed him on their methods. From what Chaplin says here, in his autobiography, we can get an insight into the way his mind worked. He states that he thought Keystone’s methods were a bit vague, a bit hit or miss, and consisted of a loose story, which never fully developed, but always ended with a chase. This isn’t entirely true, although Mack Sennett himself tried to imply that it was true. What Charlie was getting around to, is that fact that he was so smart that he could see beyond slap-stick to a great new era, where comedy would be married to melancholy, drama and tragedy. However, the nature of his previous work suggests that he was fully steeped in simplistic comedy and slapstick, of a kind developed by his former boss, Fred Karno. Beyond his time at Keystone, Chaplin would, indeed, go on to produce films containing humour, slapstick and melancholy. Unfortunately, to begin his advancement into dramatic comedy, although he did not know it, he would first need to meet, and collaborate with the ‘Queen of The Movies’, Mabel Normand. Mabel, however, was nowhere to be seen. He knew where to find her – just join the rush to the set where she was performing, or get onto the periphery of the crowd surrounding her, but he was always too far back to be noticed by the lady of the lot. Mack was avoiding him, and giving no indication that he’d soon start work, and perhaps he was thinking of getting rid of the irritating tick, Charlie. He was sure Mabel had fallen for him, but if he would soon be gone, then why would she bother getting acquainted with him? His old insecurity began to return, and depression settled on him like a lead blanket.\n\nWhen Charlie heard that Mack and Mabel had gone on location, he knew he’d lost his chance to connect. Nonetheless, he was immediately grabbed by Henri ‘Pathe’ Lehrman (a fake Frenchman) who put him in a disreputable film called ‘His New Profession’. Lehrman took the lead, as well as directing, but made sure there were plenty of fight sequences, where he could knock little Charlie around. Although Charlie met the lovely Virginia Kirtley, the film did nothing to increase his confidence. Chaplin was a master gags-man, and gave Lehrman number of gags, but the fake Frenchman ignored them, and instead, got laughs by tipping a $1,500 Studebaker car off of a cliff. By the standards of the day, the film was not bad, and when Sennett returned, he put Charlie with Mabel. Charlie needed a solid character in order to impress Sennett, and he came up with the Tramp. A character also needed an individual and distinctive walk, and Charlie had been informed by the actors that if he did not produce a ‘walk’ then Sennett would allot one to him. A Sennett walk was something nobody wanted, and as a result, Charlie came up with the famous tramp shuffle.\n\nCharlie had met, and acted with, a few of the Keystone actresses, but none of them took an interest in him. Didn’t they know he was a Music Hall star, a minor legend? Now he was going to perform alongside the ‘Queen’ but what did Charlie think about that? He was in a kind of dichotomy, on the one hand, he was much enamoured of Mabel, from seeing her and hearing what people said about her, whereas on the other hand, the respect and deference they showed her, stuck in his craw, at a time when he was basically being ignored. He had, clearly, misunderstood the situation. Mabel had been one of the prime movers that had built up Keystone, and had the influence of a share-holder, although, having been young at the beginning, she neglected to demand a share in the company. Actors and crew that had a grievance, which Sennett would readily dismiss, took that grievance to Mabel, who often as not, would relay it to the boss, and demand action. Chaplin, of course, had done nothing for no-one, nor had he any intention of doing so in the future. On this occasion, Mack and Mabel were beginning a film called ‘Mabel’s Strange Predicament’, but although they had a story of sorts, they needed more gags to fill it out. Charlie was brought in, as the English Music Hall players were well-known for their gags. Mabel was playing a girl acting above her station, and Charlie came up with a character that would be her counterpart, and nemesis. That character was the Tramp. In essence the film consisted of Charlie chasing a pajama-clad Mabel around a hotel, upsetting old maids and plug-hatted gents.\n\nEverything went fine, until the release, when it was seen that Charlie had been allowed an opening scene to himself. It appears that Mabel had shot an opening scene of her entering the Raymond Hotel in Pasadena. The fact that she looks directly at the camera and smiles, tells us that this is the opening scene that would get the Keystone fans cheering at the sight of a well-known face. Charlie tells us in his memoirs that the place fell silent during his scene, although his presence was accepted later, once the audience had got to know him. The fact that there was a hiatus of two months before Mabel and Charlie got together again does suggest that Mabel was a bit sore about what had happened, and had refused to work with ‘golden boy’ Charlie. ‘Golden boy’ to who, we might ask? Probably to Kessel and Baumann, who had signed the Limey, and considered him to be their man, someone answerable to them and not Sennett. During the weeks that followed the Mabel film, a few men began to appreciate his style, but many found him stand-offish, pompous and a little anti-social. He was also cheap, and never bought a round of drinks, which brought him plenty of derision. Conversely, women found his acting style not to their taste, but many were drawn to his off-set quiet, and sensitive manner. He ingratiated himself with a number of actresses, most of whom dropped him, once they discovered his true character. He seemed to be getting along with Peggy Pearce for a time, and he often had tea around her mother’s house, until he was suddenly and inexplicably, let go. Presumably mother came to disapprove of Charlie, for something or other.\n\nIn March 1913, Charlie was called upon to play a part in Keystone’s biggest and most important film to date. It was called ‘Mabel At The Wheel’ and it was important as it replied to the action-girl movies, about to be released by the Pathe Company. The series of films was to be called ‘The Perils of Pauline’ starring theatrical actress Pearl White, and the threat to Keystone and its girl was real. The story was, unusually for Keystone, sound and told the story of a young girl, who after numerous attempts to derail her, goes on to win the Santa Monica 200-mile car race. Charlie was put out by his role in the film. Firstly, he resented being cast as a villain, which part made him not leading man, but second leading man. From what we read in Charlie’s memoirs, he was incandescent with rage, and in all probability, complained to Kessel and Baumann. Whether by design or accident, Baumann turned up in Los Angeles. He did not go to the studio, but sent daughter Ada along to act in the film and, presumably, keep an eye on things. Chaplin went out for the shoot, but was outraged when he saw Mabel directing. From what Chaplin says, it seems his chauvinistic tendencies took over, as he had never heard of a female directing. He began hopping up and down, and eventually went into a deep sulk, went on strike did Charlie. Mabel had been deaf to his suggestions for gags, but this was not meant to be a string of gags film. The Queen understood that too many gags would detract from the story, and stood firm against the little fellow. Richard Attenborough had it right in the film ‘Chaplin’ where he has Mabel rant at Charlie, saying “This is not a film about being funny with a hose!” Nor was it. At 5 o’clock, Mabel ceased filming, and everyone went back to the studio. Charlie claims that Sennett came storming into the dressing room, and screamed at him that he was fired. However, it seems that Chaplin is leaving something out, for it is highly likely that he phoned Baumann, and told him his woes. Ada would have phoned him too, with the result that Baumann would have contacted Sennett. In all likelihood he’d have told Sennett to cool things down, let Charlie have a few gags, and he’d tell Charlie to knuckle down. Sennett would have to go along with Baumann’s orders, but he would still bawl Charlie out, and scare the crap out of the little Limey. As Charlie tells it, Baumann told Sennett to let him do what he wanted, and Sennett rolled over like a pussycat. ‘Mabel At The Wheel’, nevertheless, tells us that Charlie was unable to change the course of the story, and he was only able to insert a few gags, and that he remained the villain, with not a sign of the tramp’s costume.\n\nChaplin, then, was smug about his position, he states it in his memoirs. However, he had not turned the studio upside down, had not stuck it to anybody, but he had bowed before his Queen. Mabel was from the school of hard knocks, from the old dog-eat-dog Biograph studio, and no-one was going to going to get the better of her. However, her attitude towards Charlie now changed, and he became her constant companion, or “Her prize” as Chester Conklin later put it. Every actress in filmdom was swooning over the good-looking, tousled hair, but suave Englisher, and Mabel ‘owned’ him. It is fair to say that Mabel always had the best leading men on her arm, it was just the way she thought things should be. Charlie was paraded around town, introduced to everyone that was anyone, and taken to the best parties. Presumably, Mabel kept a look out for partygoers eyelashes fluttered in Charlie’s direction. Charlie was teetotal, but soon learned how to make a party swing, and his book or film quizzes became legendary. At the studio, his eternal presence in Mabel’s dressing-room upset many people, especially as the door was now often locked, preventing members of the company walking in and out at will. Audiences with the ‘Queen’ were not quite so easy now, audiences that usually meant a member of the company (actors, carpenters, electricians) had a grievance that they would like Mabel to bring to the management’s attention. Charlie only had one grievance – money. Every now and then, he favoured a pay rise, and would send Mabel to negotiate with Sennett. Mabel was altruistic, but she wasn’t that altruistic, and always ensured that she got a pay rise too, so that a situation did not arise where Charlie would earn more than her. There was, therefore, always an element of competition between them. In terms of acting, we might look at ‘Mabel’s Busy Day’ in which Charlie shows that he can also do the melancholic stuff, while Mabel proves she can handle the slapstick. Mabel, naturally, did as she pleased, and when she and Charlie tired of working, she ‘stole’ a company car, and they drove downtown to take in an early show. Without Mabel, such a thing would not have been possible.\n\nTowards the end of summer, a gulf seemed to be developing between Charlie and Mabel. Mabel was appearing more and more with Keystone regulars, like Roscoe Arbuckle, while Charlie was favouring one leading lady, Peggy Page (often said to be Helen Carruthers). There might have been several reasons for this. The first is that the public were tiring of the Charlie and Mabel show, believing that the duo were getting out of their personal comfort zones. It is also likely that Sennett himself decided it was time to split them up. If Mabel was ‘Queen of The Movies’ he did not want her appearing with the ‘King of The Movies’. He would have been wise enough to realise they could sell themselves as a team to his competitors. Quite simply, Charlie might have decided it was time to come out of Mabel’s shadow. There may, furthermore, been some love interest involved, and Helen Carruthers, from contemporary reports, seems to have been the younger of two sisters, and aged fourteen. From what we know of Chaplin, this was his preferred age for his lovers – Mabel was too old at twenty-two. However, Mabel was foisted on Chaplin for ‘Gentlemen of Nerve’ much it seems to the annoyance of young Helen. In one scene, she is seen sitting in a race track grandstand, apparently comforted by her mother, while Charlie and Mabel get very flirty. The Carruthers, by the by, were a family of gold-diggers led by the mother, Estelle (Footnote).\n\nIt does appear that Mabel became Charlie’s rock as he renegotiated his contract with Sennett. According to Mabel, they had several dinners together, during which Charlie spoke of his woes, but there was little Mabel could do to hold him at Keystone. One day, Charlie told her that G.M. Anderson (Broncho Billy) of Essanay had offered him a year’s contract at $1,200 a week. They were both staggered at this sum, but Charlie was soon free of Keystone. He went to the Chicago studio, where he was treated with some contempt, by actors, office staff and the big boss George Spoor. Whether his reputation for being awkward and anti-social preceded him we do not know, but, as at Keystone, no-one was keen on the little guy. Broncho Billy talked everything through with Charlie, who seemed to be getting a little paranoid, and it was decided he’d go to the Niles Studio, near San Francisco. Being in a remote desert area, most of the company were eccentrics, which meant he fitted in much better. His replacement for Mabel was Broncho Billy, and Charlie often joined the crazy cowboy on his regular jaunts to the flesh-pots of San Francisco. They were, of course, two of a kind, and again, Charlie basked in the reflected glory the world’s most famous cowpoke. Girls were now on Chaplin’s mind, specifically he needed a leading lady. Ladies from the stock company did not suit him, he needed someone he could mould to his own requirements. At this stage, the last thing he wanted was another headstrong, interfering ‘Mabel’. Broncho was very good at knowing which girls were available, and likely for turning into pseudo actresses, and he found a high school, blond girl by the name of Edna Purviance. Slightly above his preferred age at seventeen, Charlie decided he liked blonds, and nothing about her reminded him of Mabel. Edna proved very malleable and keen to do everything Charlie demanded. Naturally, Charlie demanded more than acting ability and something developed between them, although Edna clearly found something odd in his character, for she eventually ceased the play-acting and put up a wall to amour between them.\n\nSoon, it became evident that the backwoods studio in Niles was not really fit for making anything but cowboy films. Charlie had dreams of making great pictures, which meant collaborating with people outside of the cowboy fraternity. Broncho Billy had launched Charlie, now he was going to Hollywood! He found a studio lot in Boyle Heights, not really Hollywood, but close enough for Charlie. Unfortunately, that proximity brought him into renewed contact with Mabel, but if he sought to avoid her, he could not prevent her from taking up with Edna. From this point onwards Edna became very formal with Charlie, and she seems to have taken up Mabel’s philosophy of avoiding marriage. As the years rolled by Charlie did not lose his penchant for underage girls, and in 1918, he met and married 16-year old Mildred Harris. The marriage, it turned out, was not a good one, with Mildred virtually incarcerated in Chaplin’s gilded cage, and Mabel seemed to busy herself in their affairs, when she returned from Goldwyn’s New Jersey studio to his studio in Los Angeles. Charlie had been insisting on being involved in Mildred’s acting contracts, and was much against a contract with Louis B. Mayer. Someone had clearly been whispering in Mildred’s ear, for she held steadfastly to Mayer’s contract. When the couple finally had a baby, which died soon after birth, it was Mabel that arranged a ‘snowballing’ weekend for them on Mount Lowe, although Charlie elected to stay away.\n\nWith Mabel’s return to Los Angeles came further interference in Charlie’s affairs. In his memoirs he says that he stayed at the studio after hours, as he could not face the trouble at home. What he omits to say is that he did not stay at his own studio, but went to his brother Syd’s studio that was within the lot of Goldwyn pictures. Syd, we know was never a shoulder to cry on, so he went to the office of big boss, Sam Goldwyn. We only know of this due to the fact that Sam wrote of these visits in his autobiography ‘Behind The Screen’. Sam found Charlie a strange little man, who talked of nothing but himself. Pompous and opinionated, he nonetheless grasped for approval, perhaps even groping for help to straighten out his mind. Goldwyn was very interested in Charlie’s psychology, and sometimes let ‘names’ slip out just to gauge the Tramp’s reaction. Chaplin could find no good in any of them, they were either bad businessmen or they made bad films. Goldwyn observed “Chaplin is no businessman, he simply knows he cannot take anything less.” Charlie, of course, made lots of money, but he was never the greatest financial genius – that honour went to hard-working Harold Lloyd. Inevitably, Mabel discovered where Charlie was hiding himself, and took to visiting Sam’s office, accidentally of course. Producers always liked to have their star-of-stars draped around them, and the stars were always keen on keeping an eye on their producer, ensuring they were not promoting the ‘opposition’. Sam noted that Charlie always became curiously reticent when Mabel was present. He had once asked Charlie what he thought of Mack and Mabel, and Charlie replied that they thought they were great, but he’d shown them the way things should be done. Sam knew this to be untrue, and he had specifically set out to have Mabel as the first signing of his new company. By luck, Mabel’s greatest film ‘Mickey’ was released soon after, and although the Triangle company took the profits from the 18-million box-office takings, Mabel and thereby Sam, took the kudos. Sam noted that at these meetings Mabel was as disarmingly charming as ever, but would drop little verbal bombs that could give Charlie something to chew over for the next weeks, or years. Charlie would shift uncomfortably in his chair, and Sam could see he was ready to explode, although any verbal attacks launched against the ‘Queen of The Movies’ would bring the whole of Hollywood down upon him.\n\nEventually, Charlie and Mildred divorced, but by then he’d found a new shoulder to lean on, in the form of Douglas Fairbanks. Up and coming super-star Fairbanks asked nothing of Chaplin, but Doug’s confidence and his ability to out-manoeuvre the old guard, made him someone to keep close. When Doug and Mary moved out to Pickfair in the Beverly Hills, Charlie more or less moved in. Rarely would he have to go down to Hollywood and mingle with that maddening crowd. His confidence always returned when they pulled the drawbridge up at Fairbanks Towers. By 1930, the Fairbanks confidence had dissolved, along with silent movies, and Doug and Mary were growing apart, leaving Charlie somewhat adrift. Amid all of this Mabel died, inspiring Charlie to pen an unprecedented flurry of obituaries. The reasons behind what happened next are mere hypothesis, but Chaplin seems to have had a brain-storm. He out-voted his backers and demanded that his next picture be a silent picture. Then, he ranted and raved at the studio, that his leading lady, blond-haired Virginia Cheryl, was no good and must be fired. The backers were furious, as the shooting had been going on for weeks. His next leading lady and wife, Paulette Goddard, was dark-haired and although Jewish, very Irish, and Mabelesque in her manner. Too Mabelesque in fact, for they soon divorced. His next acquisition was Irishwoman, Oona O’Neil, who he did not cast, but simply married.\n\nCharlie went fully into the dog-house in the early fifties, when he was barred from the U.S. for being a suspected communist. His penchant for young girls did not figure in this. Curiously, the rise in interest for the silent movie era brought both he and Arbuckle out of the dog-house. Mabel was never fully let out, and the reader is left to consider why.\n\nConclusions\n\nSo, not a complete account of Charles Spencer Chaplin, but enough to mull over. Firstly, let’s deal with Stan Laurel’s idea that Chaplin was insane. This is highly unlikely, as although he was often stand-offish and anti-social, he had a good grasp of most things, and he was better in business than Sam Goldwyn had claimed. Today, he would be viewed differently, and deemed to be, probably, on the autistic spectrum. The possibility of him being examined by a psychologist has now passed, but Chaplin consulted ‘shrinks’ in his lifetime, reinforcing the view that he feared going insane like his mother. We have seen above, his apparent insanity taking hold in around 1930, exacerbated by his wrong choice of women, until he found Oona O’Neil.\n\nThat Chaplin was a lecher for young girls cannot be denied, and we might wonder why no-one spoke up in Hollywood, and did not aid the Federal investigation into his activities. The fact is that nobody in Hollywood spoke out against anyone. However, like Al Capone, they eventually got him on a one-million-dollar income tax rap.\n\nWhat do we make of his ‘Mabel period’. Like most people in the 1910s, he probably fell for Mabel, by seeing her on the screen as Betty in the John Bunny comedies. No doubt, meeting the Keystone Girl was a plus point for signing with the Keystone studio. In the end, things turned out the other way round, and he ended up as her ‘prize’. Not only that, she became his mentor, without who’s support he would have withered on the studio and Hollywood vine. Chaplin, of course, would never have admitted to this, but his protests were feeble and his childish antics, on the ‘Mabel At The Wheel’ set were pitiable.\n\nFrom what Sam Goldwyn could make out in 1919, they had once been lovers, but once parted, something gnawed away at the little limey, and Mabel was not above goading him, in her own inimitable, but charming way. In his book, Goldwyn called her “disarmingly charming” which was, presumably, the key to her social success. As his wives soon discovered, Charlie was far from charming, and was certainly incapable of being disarming., which is why he made so many enemies, including, to some extent, his own children. In his autobiography, Charlie actually waxes lyrically over Mabel, and contrary to opinion, only suggests she was too young to direct, although she’d directed numerous pictures before he arrived at Keystone. In the end, it was Mabel that taught him to live, Doug Fairbanks that propped him up, and Oona O’Neil that kept him sane.\n\nFootnote: It does appear that Peggy or Helen pursued Charlie to Essanay, at Niles, but found he’d gone to Chicago. Broncho Billy put her in westerns, but when Charlie came to Niles, he immediately found Edna Purviance. Helen was next heard of in a Portland Sanatorium, after she’d swallowed bichloride of mercury. Helen got lucky and survived to marry a German Baron. However, on a swelteringly hot, New York night, in the summer of 1925, the Baroness fell, or jumped out of, a 5th storey window. Chaplin had been in town at that time, having an affair with then dancing girl Louise Brooks. Any connection? We will never know. Mother and elder daughter, Gladys, hit the nascent sea cruise scene, where Gladys met a millionaire, who she married, and seemingly, lived happily ever after.\n\nThe title above is not an original one. It comes from a journalistic piece written in Australia in 1924. Who wrote it, no-one knows for the scribe admits that it had its origin in old London town. The impetus for this, some would say disreputable, article was the second scandal involving Mabel Normand, the third occurring a little after the article’s publication. Preceding all three, of course, was the murder/manslaughter scandal involving Roscoe ‘Fatty’ Arbuckle. The public fury unleased by these scandals is understandable in relation to the United States, where the events occurred, but why such venom was unleashed in England and far off Australia, is difficult to ascertain. There is nothing surviving from London, which would suggest that the people and movie fans there were overly concerned with what Miss Normand got up to in her spare time, and she had not been convicted of any crime. The British at that time, were more concerned with the continuing problems in Ireland, and the I.R.A. bombs detonating across the country. Perhaps the writer was a citizen of the land of Aus, who’d travelled to Hollywood with dreams of stardom, and ultimately failed, causing him to be twisted, bitter and spitting revenge. Although the writer’s tirade is greatly exaggerated, there is a glimmer of truth in his account of Hollywood. For this reason, it is worth trawling through this mass of virtual detritus, in order to discover any ‘gems’ that might lie within.\n\nMoney is our learned scribe’s first concern, and he cannot wait to tell us that thirty-million pounds (one hundred and fifty million dollars in those days) a year are expended on movies in Hollywood every year. We are, of course, supposed to be shocked by this incredible sum, which amounts to $3.75bn in today’s money, and at a time when the industry was in its infancy. The salaries of the film stars soar to 100,000 pounds a year ($500,000) we are told. In reality, no stars were paid $10,000 a week, although the studios boasted that they were. The bosses had ways of relieving the performers of most of their pay. A handful of stars, like Mary Pickford and Mabel Normand, did make these sums, not as a salary, but as a percentage of the profits of their films (usually 25%). Salaries were in the region $3,000 a week, but were small fry compared with a profits share. Our writer is, therefore, alluding to a small group of people. It is correct to say that Hollywood was the Klondike of the screen, although there were no actors that were paid in gold. The place drew in tens of thousands of chancers, carpet-baggers, and, as one foreign visitor noted, “Beautiful girls with wicked eyes.” Some could have been regarded, as our writer states “the scum and dregs of mankind.” Certainly, there were escaped convicts, runaways, vamps with evil intent, gold-digging mamas selling their daughters, and devious real estate agents, all drawn to, and festering in, the place of dreams. The place where no-one asked who you were, or where you came from. “The picture players are helpless illiterates, whose sudden opulence is unregulated by the restraints of religion or education.” This is tarring everyone with the same brush, for while many came from the backwoods and the city slums, there were plenty of actors that were well-educated. No small number were, by 1924, well-spoken, for the studios had long been employing English school ma’ams to rid the stars of their Bronx or ‘covered wagon’ accents. Mabel Normand had lost her Brooklyn (Staten Island version) accent early on, and indeed, the 1920s press criticised her for developing a superior “Cavendish Square breadth of accent, so like dear old Lonnon!” [Los Angeles Herald, June 17, 1924].\n\nHaving pilloried the stars, the writer then begins to lash them for their decadence, in terms of drink and drugs. Unfortunately, he is too mesmerised by the gold he referred to in the previous paragraph. He just cannot get the stuff out of his mind. “They are like Midas. Everything they touch turns to gold, and they have the ears of the ass, as well as the morals of the monkey.” This is the first time her refers to ancient writings, and he will later bewitch us with his knowledge of the classics. For now he wants us to know that the stars were not the sweet angels of the publicity photographs, and down Hollywood way, everyone was ‘doing it’ with everyone else. Now for drink and drugs. “….. the nemesis which destroyed Soddom and Gomorrah rains down upon it (Hollywood) drink and drugs. It is being burnt to ashes by dipsomania, heroin and cocaine.” The scribe asks whether in a hundred years a small part of this sordid story will be told. Well, we can give him his answer after ninety-eight years, and the answer is no, for we know little more of the truth than our Aussie friend knew back then. He ends this section, by asserting that the ghosts of the Borgias, must bewail their clumsiness and lament their incompetence, for they were incompetent amateurs compared to the crowd don in Hollywood.\n\nIn Cinemapolis, we are told, all scandal is snuffed out by the inmates of this place. He now turns directly to Mabel Normand, she who would never tell, never knew who shot D.W. Taylor or why her chauffeur shot Courtland Dines (or “Dimes” as he puts it). “No-one knows who shoots anybody in Los Angeles.” It was chain-gang escapee Joe Kelly (aka Horace Greer) that admitted to shooting Dines, and he said that he shot Dines in defence of his mistress, Mabel, then under the influence Dines’ drugs. Just to add a bitter sauce to the story he claims that as the shooting chauffeur ran into Dine’s apartment, he shouted “Abandon dope all ye who enter” which, while amusing, is unnecessary and does not fit the facts. Our writer is kind of happy with the dope explanation, as it fits well with his tirade Another story that Mabel was that stealing millionaire Dines, from his fiancé Edna Purviance, then went cold on him, causing problems between Mabel and Dines. In fact, the latter story would be fine to our man, as it puts Mabel’s morality in the spotlight – the more dirt he can find, the better. Other facts he turns over and over with glee, and finds great joy in distorting everything. Mabel, he is convinced, is a bare-faced liar. He is unconvinced by Mabel’s assertion that she did not engage the chauffeur. This fact or non-fact is more complicated than the writer knew, and we will discuss this further on.\n\nPoor Butterflies is the title of the next section, but before he begins, he must remind us of his knowledge of the classics, by name-dropping Juvenal and Petronius Arbiter. Queen Mabel and Queen Edna may be dethroned, he says, in the same way that King Arbuckle was dethroned in 1921. Then, he reminds us that Fatty and Mabel triumphed together in comedies, but his assertion that Mabel was a witness to the alleged murder (manslaughter) of Virginia Rappe by Arbuckle, is not founded in truth. That Mabel was the last person to see director W.D. Taylor alive (apart from his murderer) is a fact, although found to be irrelevant at the inquest. Again he reverts to the subject of drugs, claiming without any evidence, that Taylor was Mabel’s supplier. Drugs (cocaine, heroin) were rife in Hollywood at the time, so why Mabel would need a specific supplier is a mystery. Bootleg booze was a different matter, and we know that Mabel (or her secretary) was on good terms with a bootlegger, in the absence of which, the wild Hollywood parties would no longer have been wild. ‘Poor Butterflies’ refers to another poor, drug-sozzled lover of Mr. Taylor, Mary Miles Minter, who wrote letters to her supposed junk trader on paper embossed with butterflies. In his scramble for scandal, the author has missed a trick here. He could have gone deeper into Taylor’s past, and come up with juicy titbits, like Taylor’s possible involvement in gun-running for the Irish Republican Army, the Loyalists, or both. This, of course, would increase the likelihood of MI6 agents turning up at the learned scribe’s door, one moonless night. At this point, said scribe tries his luck at a Mabel chronology, but makes a complete mess of it, by stating that Mabel began in pictures with D.W. Griffith, at the age of twelve, or three years before Griffith had moved into films.\n\nMabel became a star in 1915, says our man, appearing in ‘Tillie’s Punctured Romance’ with Charlie Chaplin, which makes him four years out in his warped chronology. “She was a little Arbuckle in petticoats with wonderful eyes, a slim figure, comical features and grotesque gestures.” Notice that Mabel is regarded as some female version of the male stars, implying that she somehow slavishly copied them, when in fact she was mentor to them both. Nonetheless, he has to mention that Mabel had to first appear in doublet and hose to get into pictures. This is a rather facetious comment, and there is no film in which she appears in skimpy clothing, and in truth, when Griffith wanted her to don a grass skirt, she went on strike.\n\nMolly O’\n\n“She played tomboy parts in ‘Jinx’ and Molly O.” Here our friend has it wrong again, for although a tomboy in ‘Jinx’, she was a domestic skivvy in ‘Molly O’. There was heavy investment in this film, so we might be surprised, at our writer’s surprise, that with the picture went Molly O’ merchandise of all kinds (dolls, biscuits etc.). That the film was more a drama than a comedy, is a fact that seems to have escaped the learned one.\n\nNever Divorced\n\n“Mabel is illiterate!” claims the wordsmith. A clear judgement, but from where does he derive his evidence? From nowhere, simply because there is ample evidence that Mabel was not illiterate. This is a mere jibe, and one that was eternally aimed at the acting fraternity, which other journalists have assured us, always spoke in a Bronx, southern drawl, or ‘covered wagon’ accents. “I don’t want any blooming dinner!” said Mabel when offered a film dinner, and for once this might be true, due to her avoiding such events, so as to preserve her ‘tiny Arbuckle in petticoats’ figure. It is quite true that Mabel was one of the Live Hundred in Hollywood, but not true to say she was unacceptable to New York society. She was perfectly acceptable to America’s First Lady.\n\n“Mabel was transformed out of a human being into a close-up.” Or in other words she ceased to be a woman, having been exposed for years to screen guns, screen auto-da-fe, and screen drugs. Casual presents for Mabel cost $400 (£10,000 today) the writer continues, implying she had no concept of the value of money. Why he chose to say that Mabel had never been divorced (she hadn’t married either) is a mystery, and he does not pursue the point.\n\nHedonists\n\n“They are doped by their wages, every drop of their blood is gold.” Film actresses are the prisoners of Hollywood, and life for them is a motion picture. In their leisure time they resort to pure hedonism. “Gilded boredom leads to drink and drugs.” A small amount of truth here, in that the silent movie people could get by on three or four hours work per day, and there were no lines to learn. Actress Blanche Sweet blamed everything on the good burghers of Los Angeles, who excluded the motion picture people from their society, so that they had to lean inward for support and amusement from their fellows. In other words, if the film industry had stayed in the environs of New York, instead of moving ten-bloc to the wastelands of California, everything would have been just dandy, and ‘monsters’ like Mabel Normand would never had arisen. Finally, the author has to remind us of his vaunted position as a reader of the classics, by preaching “…they are like Carinus, devoted to pleasure and destitute of taste.”\n\nConclusions\n\nIt does appear that this article never saw the light of day in London. The thing was almost certainly constructed by a guy in Australia with a heap of newspaper cuttings before him, which had their origin in the United States. Much of what is said can be related directly to news articles that still exist today. Consequently, the scribe is merely repeating some of the American vitriol thrown in the direction of Mabel Normand, and it is worth remembering that, although the whole of Hollywood was under attack, it was Mabel who was deemed to represent the evils embedded in the film colony. Many factors underlie Mabel’s singling out for hostile attack, which would require a complete article to discuss, but put briefly, Mabel was seen as the centre of Hollywood, the fount of all evil in that place. She was the first star actress to live permanently in Los Angeles, and the colony can be seen to have grown around her. She is said to have invented the Hollywood wild party, and drew even wilder people to her. More sinister, some thought, was the fact that she mentored two of the most grotesque characters to emerge from the Californian Gomorrah, Charles Spencer Chaplin and Roscoe ‘Fatty’ Arbuckle. Some others, including Mack Sennett, thought that she had simply been reckless in her acquaintances, and way of life. In the end, posterity was to judge her by the accumulated verbiage of disreputable newspapers, magazines, books and films.\n\nIn 1916, the Triangle film distribution company, acting through New York Motion Pictures, made an offer to Mack Sennett, director of, and shareholder in the Keystone studio, of a 25% share in a new film production unit called The Mabel Normand Feature Film Company. The only film ever to come out of that new company was something called ‘Mickey’, starring Mabel Normand. The picture was shot in a few months during 1916, but the film was not released until 1918. Normally, a film was edited and readied for release in a few weeks, so why the delay releasing, what turned out to be Mabel Normand’s greatest film? The delay appears to have been caused by fallout emanating from the problems of the Triangle company, but we must look closer at what was going on between the various studios and the distributor. The film, by the way, was to be of great importance, for it was the biggest box-office hit up until that point, having grossed 18-million dollars, three-million more that D.W. Griffith’s celebrated work ‘The Birth of A Nation’, although the reflected glory from the film fell upon Mabel’s new employer, Sam Goldwyn, rather than Keystone or New York Motion Pictures. However, although the film was completed in 1916, it was not released until 1918, so what happened in the meantime? In the first instance, we need to understand the background to the creation of the Mabel Normand Feature Film Company .\n\nThe most important event we need to consider, is the creation of the Triangle Film Distribution Company in 1915, which became an umbrella company for the Ince, Griffith and Keystone studios. The details of how this affected the producer Mack Sennett and his star-of-stars, Mabel Normand, have been covered in earlier articles, so we will be brief. In a nutshell, a deep division had developed between Mack Sennett and Mabel Normand, during 1915. Probably, after some conversations between Mabel and the Triangle management in New York, it was decided that Mabel and a small Keystone company would be loaned to the Triangle studio in Fort Lee, New Jersey, where they would work for three months, starting late December. Stars were now becoming important for the film studios, and Triangle had decided that each of its studios would have a big star, and for Keystone, the company had decided that it would be best to promote the existing star, Mabel Normand. From what we know, Sennett was keen on pushing some of his new male actors and Bathing Beauties to the fore, leaving Mabel a little adrift. The way forward, then, was to bring Mabel to New York, where she could make ‘special’ films that would keep her on a level with her old Biograph compatriots, such as Mary Pickford, Mae Marsh and Blanche Sweet, who were now in the ascendancy.\n\nThe plan was a success, but a problem arose when Mabel was due to return west. Perhaps, thinking Sennett would side-line her, she demanded more support from Triangle, and more than that, she wanted Keystone’s new studio in Hollywood for her own personal use. A threat to sign for the Mutual Company, galvanised the Triangle management into action, and they quickly formed The Mabel Normand Feature Film Company, for which they gained the new Hollywood studio, by offering Sennett 25% of the Mabel Normand company. This might not have pleased Mabel, as it meant Mack had some power over her, but an arrangement was devised, whereby her old boss would have no hand in the day to day running of the company. This was achieved by electing Thomas Ince as the supervisor of Mabel’s studio. The scheme, however, was never going to work, as Ince was fully engaged in producing high-class pictures for his own studio, and in any case, such was his personality that he would soon have collided with Mabel in a big way. Inevitably, Sennett ended up supervising the studio, which caused problems from the off, but as Mabel arrived at her new studio, with her name in five-feet high letters on the roof, everything looked rosy. As the congratulatory telegrams poured in, Mabel busied herself having the place carpeted, laying out a roof garden around her dressing room, and organising a dressing room balcony that overlooked the main stage. Twenty-five of her friends were able to be accommodated in the dressing room, for a celebratory dinner, prepared by a Japanese chef, using the in-house facilities. The present owner of the studio, Jesse Rogg, states the area of the timber studio as being 25,000 square feet (2323 sq. m).\n\nSoon enough, they began work on the first film, called ‘Mountain Bred’, later to be titled ‘Mickey’, but there were problems from the start. Mack Sennett brought in various directors, none of which, in Mabel’s opinion, came up to scratch. The director that Mabel wanted was a young guy by the name of F. Richard Jones, who Mack used as a kind of trouble-shooter, someone that finished films that had gone awry. He was worth his weight in gold to Keystone, and Keystone was where Mack wanted to keep him. The King of Comedy was, as ever, wary of getting young men too close to his star-of-stars. However, he was eventually forced to deliver up Jones to the MN studio, perhaps by order of Kessel and Baumann. It is surprising, though, that Sennett was able to busy himself so much in the MNS studio business, considering that he had much on his plate in Edendale. Presumably, he was working 24/7.\n\nOstensibly, Sennett worked closely with Jones, but maybe a little against the New York management. In his autobiography, Mack tells us that New York was responsible for paying Jones’ salary, while at the MNS. This was forwarded intermittently, and at one point Jones ‘kidnapped’ the film negative, and refused to return it until he was paid. Usually, nonetheless, payments were always sent via Mack Sennett, so was Mack responsible for the missing payments? Alas, we will never know. What we do know is that the management and organisation of the studio was very Byzantine in structure. In essence, there were too many chiefs, considering the small number of ‘Indians’. Harry Aitken, Kessel, Baumann, Sennett and Mabel all had a say in the running of the studio, as well as Jones. Tempers became frayed, as there was no clear ‘boss’ and at one time, as Mack told it, Mabel “ran away.” Yes, she actually disappeared for three weeks, after having been to New York, although for what reason we do not know. It would be nice to know all of the intrigues and shenanigans that went on down on Fountain Avenue, then an entire film could be made about the life and times of the Mabel Normand Studio. As we don’t know everything, we’ll move on to the making of the film.\n\n‘Mountain Bred’ (later ‘Mickey’) was a film unlike any that the Keystone management had ever undertaken in its short history. Full length feature films were very rare in those days, and even experienced outfits, like the Griffith concern, had to build up to the day they produced a true multi-reeler. Griffith, of course, had produced ‘The Birth of A Nation’, but with great help and resources from Harry Aitken, but it should be borne in mind that Griffith’s expensive follow up ‘Intolerance’ was initially a failure. In the case of the Mabel Normand Feature Film Company, the first film was a success, but there was to be no second film. There is no doubt that Mabel put everything into the picture, for the eyes of Hollywood and the world were upon the Queen of The Movies. In a way, if she failed, she would be letting down those Hollywood friends, the Mary Pickfords, Dorothy Gishes, and Gertrude Bambricks that had put her on a pedestal from the time of the old Biograph studio. The story of ‘Mickey’ was solid, and told the story of a young girl from the backwoods, who after a series of adventures, gets her man and lives happily ever after. In essence, just like a good old Keystone ‘Cinderella’ picture, but in detail, very, very different. They would, naturally, call upon the attributes of the Keystone Girl. ‘Mickey’ would be a diving girl, a brilliant horsewoman, reckless, loving, pretty, adorable, and good fun, when she wanted to be. Sometimes she would be vivacious and over the top, sometimes she would be melancholy, as her predecessor had been, and indeed, as Mabel had been. In discussions with Dick Jones, Mack Sennett probably insisted that Mickey should be as much like the Keystone Girl as possible, for to stray too far from her, would have been commercial suicide.\n\nGive the audience what they wanted to see, would have been Mack’s order. Jones, nonetheless got to work on the old Mabel, and enhanced her characteristics, and especially her facial gestures. This he would do for the next three films he made with Mabel during the 1920s. There was much work done in the studio, but a lot more was carried out on location, at Big Bear Lake, and numerous places around L.A., although a proportion of the story was set in New York (there are no palm trees in New York, but there are in ‘Mickey’). There were many chiefs under the Triangle banner, but only one real-life Indian, Mini Haw Haw (real name Mini Devereaux). She was said to be of the Cheyenne nation, and carried a scar caused by a slash from a sabre wielded by one of Custer’s men at the time of the Battle of Little Big Horn. Many suspected, though, that she was too young to have been around at the time of the battle. However, she cursed the palefaces at every opportunity, but was a great friend of Mabel, and even made a pair of moccasins for her. Perhaps Mini made her an honorary Indian, for her outstanding performance in D.W. Griffith’s ‘The Squaw’s Love’. Lew Cody played the ‘chinless’ villain in the film, who Mabel would, kind of, marry ten years later. For the time being, however, Mabel was much taken with Dick Jones, but in a professional way (we think). Only one man could play guardian/father to the girl from the backwoods, and that was the old, grouchy Keystone stalwart, George ‘Pops’ Nichols. For once, Mabel does not have a mother, leaving her usual choice, Alice Davenport, unemployed for this picture. ‘Pops’ realises that Mabel has grown up without him noticing, when her heart strings begin to flutter for leading man, Wheeler Oakman. ‘Pops’ being unable to cope with a hormonal teenager, sends her away to her relatives in New York, where she runs into a wicked aunt, played by Laura La Varnie and equally wicked cousin, played by Minta Durfee (Arbuckle). There are plenty of adventures for Mabel, including swinging from a fifty-feet high roof gutter, and riding, and falling off, a racehorse.\n\nAlthough Mack and Mabel had been brought together by the film, the war was still on. There was also intrigue and double-dealing between all of the factions involved. Mack distrusted K and B, Harry Aitken, as well as Mabel herself, if the truth was known. Mabel and Dick seem to have clung together for solace, and they distrusted everyone. Mabel’s dream had come true with the studio, but now came the nightmare. The film was canned, and then, nothing. By September 1916, the Triangle project had began to turn sour. Griffith’s ‘Intolerance’ had just about broken the company, and eventually the movie genius would buy the picture for one-million-dollars. Mack Sennett retreated back to Keystone, without Mabel, and her precious studio was rented to cowboys, led by William S. Hart. The cowpokes tore the heart out of the building, tossed the carpets and flowers out into the street, trashed the sumptuous dressing room, and used the timber balcony for firewood. The Mabel Normand Feature Film Company was no more. Everyone in the Triangle company was now in violent dispute, leaving Mabel to wander lonely as a cloud. She was, nonetheless, still a treasure, still a small corner of everyone’s heart, so we can imagine that Mabel was put on a retainer, until they could decide what to do with The Queen of The Movies. Mabel did what she always did at times like these and began to party, a lot. Through the gin haze, nevertheless, she was as shrewd as ever, and to cover her future, she signed, unbeknown by everyone, to a new studio being set up by one Samuel Goldwyn. The New Yorkers had also not lost their wisdom, and had hired a private detective to keep tabs on the flighty Miss Normand. The whole plan ultimately fell apart when the private dick blackmailed Mabel — “Give me $500 and I’ll tear up the information I’ve gathered.” Mabel called the cops, which must have alarmed the wise-guys in New York.\n\nSo, what of the famous picture? Well, under normal circumstances, the film would have been fully edited in-house, and sent onwards to Kessel and Baumann, who would have organised the publicity, and readied it for release, within three to four weeks. However, a month went by, then two, then three months, but still no release. Only one person has ever proffered an explanation for the delay, and that was Mack Sennett. In his autobiography, he states that Charles Baumann said the film was “crap”, and was not fit for release. This is a simple explanation for what was a complex, and as we have said, Byzantine affair. If the film was ‘crap’ then we must wonder why Sennett chose to heavily promote the thing. The King kept issuing releases saying “The world’s greatest film is coming!”, “Not long now!” In spite of what he said in the book, he must have had some inkling that the picture would eventually appear. The most obvious explanation is that there was a lot of in-fighting going on. Mabel’s film was probably the most valuable asset the now-ailing company possessed, and everyone wanted the lion’s share, but a lion must always fight off the jackals and hyenas. Almost certainly Kessel and Baumann were clinging onto the film, and were not going to relinquish it to Harry Aitken, who was undoubtedly going to be bankrupt, and perhaps prosecuted, in which case they would not get their full return, either from a court of law, or any buyer of Triangle. In fact, Triangle had to die, before the picture was able to be released.\n\nThe great company did not die quietly, and during 1917, violent financial skirmishes developed between all of the studios involv"
