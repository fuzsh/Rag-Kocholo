While selling newspapers on the street for Granny's nephew Paul, Lizette attracts the attention of two men. One is Dan Nye, a friendly figure who is actually a gentleman crook and blackmailer. The other is millionaire Henry Faure, who, seeing her sterling and innocent qualities which remind him of the daughter he lost, adopts her. While Henry is out of town on business, Lizette finds a baby on her doorstep, and when Henry returns a few months later, she tells him that the child is her own, fearing that otherwise he will not let her keep it. Not having the least notion of biology, and simply assuming that babies are gifts from heaven, Lizette cannot understand Henry's horror at hearing this news. She gladly names the father as Dan Nye, after which Henry finds the man and insists that he marry Lizette. The wily Nye agrees to marry her in",
