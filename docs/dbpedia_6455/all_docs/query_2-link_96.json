        "text": "Mwahahahaha…\n\nWe fade. In and out of a blissful faint. Cryptic images of our lives flash before our eyes, as we fall deeper into the warm waters of oblivion. Guided by kind hands. Smiling. We could be dying. Or we could’ve been drugged. Slowly, we ease back into our consciousness, and are faced with a cold, concrete floor, cool and unforgiving against our cheeks. Are wrists are bound, tight, as are our ankles. You manage to roll unto your back, and get a good look at our surroundings. We are in what appears to be a square room with no windows. In the corner, an ominous red door. A basement? Lit by flickering jack-o-lanterns with cruel, malevolent faces. All around us. Grinning at our misfortune. Candy litters the floor too. Wait. No. Empty candy wrappers. The air smells sickly sweet. We start feeling that same sickness in the pit of our stomachs. What have we gotten ourselves into? What’s going to happen to us? Will we ever escape? Then we see it. In the darkness. Scrawled unto the walls. Over and over. ‘Let’s Make Sweet Memories’…\n\nNOTE: I may be behind, but I’m gonna keep going till I reach 31 horror movies! Deal with it. :p\n\n— DAY TWENTY: ‘The Falling’ (2014) —\n\nCertificate – 15\n\nRunning time – 102 minutes\n\nThemes – (SPOILERS) Death, Haunting, Mass Fainting, Visions, Witchcraft, Paganism, Girlhood, Womanhood, Teenagers, Friendship, School, Mental Health, Lesbian Romantic/Sexual Tension, Incest, Rape, Nature\n\nFear Factor – 0/5\n\nI knew going in that this wasn’t a continuation of the rise in scares, but I found the DVD for two quid, so sodd it!\n\nThis barely falls into the horror category at all. This is not a film about fear in the obvious sense. This is more of a supernatural drama, and a very atmospheric one at that. Set in a strict all girls school in 1969, the cinematography, editing, soundtrack and general mood seems to be at least partially inspired by the original 1973 version of ‘The Wicker Man‘ (No, not that one. Not the bees). Well folksy, mysterious and in tune with nature. Paganism, Wicca and their symbols are only vaguely addressed once, maybe twice, and yet the movie could’ve gotten away without showing any, so strong are the vibes of Witchcraft and restless Spirits.\n\nThis movie is as creepy as it is beautiful, uncomfortable as it is seductive, and Maisie Williams does an excellent job at keeping the audience on their toes. Her performance as the troubled Lydia is a fine balance of harsh and vulnerable, kind and cruel, possessive and defensive; The Falling simultaneously gives us a compelling challenge in discerning our protagonist’s true intentions, and an honest portrayal of the many stages and struggles of Womanhood. Carol Morley writes and directs what is unfortunately still one of the very few examples of a purely feminine film. The ‘Themes’ section aside, I don’t want to spoil the viewing experience of this film too much, but I will say this: while not a horror, The Falling examines our fears of the unknown, of rejection, of sexuality and of the generations that come before and after us.\n\nNot at all Halloween-y, but most definitely a film to watch as the leaves, rain and fog all fall upon us. Grab a hot cuppa tea and enjoy!\n\n— DAY TWENTY ONE: ‘Trick r Treat’ (2007) —\n\nCertificate: 15\n\nRunning time: 82 minutes\n\nThemes: Halloween, Anthology, Trick or Treat, Jack-O-Lanterns, Sweets, Costumes, Children, Murder, Mental Illness, Monsters, Ghosts and Demons, Parades, Parties, Home Invasion\n\nFear Factor – 3/5\n\nIt should be said that when I give a movie in this series a Fear Factor, this is more of an indicator to readers than necessarily my own reaction to the movie. Some people will find ‘Trick r Treat‘ freaky. I didn’t, although I appreciated some of the well executed fake-outs.\n\nWhat I enjoyed most about this movie was the aesthetic. With it’s bright oranges, dark shadows and deep red blood stains, ‘Trick r Treat’ is unquestionably a Halloween movie. It embraces the festive season completely, and on that level it’s quite a cheery. It’s style is an unapologetic tribute to the Horror Anthology EC Comics of the 1950’s like ‘Tales from the Crypt‘, as made obvious during the opening credits.\n\nHowever, I feel like this movie’s hype amongst horror fans is a little excessive. Sure, it’s great to have the resurgence of the anthology, and a movie that actively picks apart the lore of the holiday, but ‘Trick r Treat’ is neither innovative or progressive. In fact, it continues to feed the cycle of lazy and sleazy self-gratification. A circle jerk, if you will. You get a lot of young male film-makers getting their foot in the industry through horror, and many of them will churn out the same trope-laden schlock and cheap slasher porn as the ones before them. Nothing new, nothing special, just another contribution to the straight-to-DVD shelf at Tesco or HMV. You could argue that these movies have their place, their own charm. But I feel like in this day and age, unless you are explicitly poking fun at the out-dated norms of the genre, then there really isn’t an excuse for horror’s all too common treatment of women, the autistic and the mentally ill. The way these groups are portrayed in ‘Trick r Treat’ upset and angered me, and just reminded me of all the bullshit I have had to deal with in my own life. And on Halloween, you want fantasy. You want to pretend. You want to escape that crap. And it sucks that for many men out there their fantasy is the demonization/romanticization/dehumanization of anyone who isn’t neuro-typical, and the objectification of women/the fetishization of violence against them.\n\nFor festive flavour, dark humour and campy twists, this is a movie to watch on All Hallow’s Eve, no question. But if you do, take what you see with a fistful of salt.\n\n— DAY TWENTY TWO: ‘Holidays’ (2016) —\n\nCertificate – 18\n\nRunning time – 105 minutes\n\nThemes – Halloween, Christmas, New Years Eve, Valentines Day, St Patrick’s Day, Easter, Mothers Day, Fathers Day, Women, Teenagers, Children, Parents, School, Bullying, Murder, Gore, Pregnancy, Birth, Snakes, Paganism, Madness, Monsters, Transformation, Occult, Ghosts, Desolation, Rape, Porn, Blackmail, Entrapment, Abuse, Torture, Revenge, Guilt, Kidnap, Creep, Serial Killer\n\nFear Factor – 3/5\n\nAnother modern Horror Anthology, this one is not only of a higher quality than ‘Trick r Treat’, but also has a far more realistic and varied representation of women. There isn’t an even ratio of men to women writing and directing, but the fact that they have a presence, and the male film-makers are able to create accurate female characters is a step in the right direction.\n\nSure, this movie is white as fuck, but that complaint aside this is a collection of chilling stories, each wholly different from the last, each a whole lot of fun in their own way. Some are scarier, funnier, or more gruesome than others, depending on your tastes (really, there’s a short here for everyone). The directing on all of them is exquisite (although disappointingly for October I found Halloween the weakest of the bunch).\n\nWhat can I say without ruining the surprise of each seasonal gift? If I had to pick my favourite, it would be a tough call between St Patrick’s Day and Father’s Day. Flick it on ya Netflix and see if our preferences match. It’s definitely worth your time. And the best bit? This creepy anthology works on any holiday! 😉 Although it might be best enjoyed on New Years Eve, as we reflect on our Sweet Memories…\n\n— DAY TWENTY THREE: ‘INSIDIOUS’ (2010) —\n\nCertificate – 15\n\nRunning time – 103 minutes\n\nThemes – (SPOILERS) Haunting, Ghosts, Demons, Underworld, Psychics, Astro-projection, Family, Children, Ghost-hunting technology, Evil\n\nFear Factor – 4/5\n\n*SPOILERS*\n\n‘Insidious’ was a lot better than I had anticipated it being. Which isn’t to say it was amazing. What I mean is, I had expected it to be shit, and I was forced to confront some prejudices I still held for the Horror genre.\n\nWhen I first saw the trailers six years ago, I just automatically assumed the film was going to be bad: the script would be unoriginal garbage, the acting poor, the narrative exploitative and the direction lazy. That it would be another product of the industry employing zero effort and churning out whatever the bare minimum is to get bums in seats. That all modern Horror was ultimately the same.\n\nThe truth is, ‘Insidious’ may not be anything new, but whilst it does tread the oh-so-familiar path of 21st Century mainstream Haunting movies, it does it to the highest possible standard. And I could not help but compare my viewing experience to watching the ‘Poltergeist’ remake, which came out 5 years later…\n\nThe Married Couple – Whether it was Gil Kenan’s direction or David Lindsay-Abaire’s screenplay at fault, the movie tried way too hard to make the parents likeable as a romantic duo, and it all came across very phony. But instead of attempting to make them likable, Insidious went for making them realistic, which guess what? Results in the audience wanting to root for them. Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne may still be too white, too well-off and too attractive to be considered your average American every-man/woman, but by striving to make their characters believable as a couple and as individuals (compromising, comfortable, reasonable yet flawed), the chemistry between them comes naturally and their responses to difficult situations are relatable. Again, the reluctant self-sacrificing father role is shoe-horned in, but it ain’t as bad. Byrne is particular does a great job.\n\nThe Kids – The focus on this movie is much more on the mother, with the children passively experiencing these frightening events. Dalton’s (Ty Simpkins) body may be attracting all the spirits, but his soul being elsewhere means he literally just lies there and takes it. The pain comes from Byrne feeling helpless and alone. Even the husband makes himself absent when the going gets tough. Which makes to the turn around of him trying to save the day disappointing, even if it is flowing his arc. The child actors in ‘Poltergeist’ where much better, but here they don’t have to be. They do fine, though.\n\nThe Plot – The plot is almost exactly identical, except for the twist that it isn’t a haunted house but a haunted child that is causing all the trouble. Family move in somewhere new. Strange and terrible stuff starts happening. A family member feels like no one believes them. Another family member is taken away to a land of the dead. Something occurs that makes the others open to getting paranormal help. Funny ghost-hunter-type characters arrive, the serious big boss then turning up and telling them what’s going on. The try using science/magic to get their family member back. After some danger, it appears to have worked, but the movie ends showing that all was not as it seemed, and they aren’t out of the woods yet. Side by side, ‘Insidious’ connects up the dots and delivers the details much more effectively, and all the characters are much more three-dimensional while fulfilling their functions.\n\nThe Underworld – The premise of this Other Realm is also very similar, being elsewhere and yet all around, however ‘Poltergeist’ is dealing only with Purgatory. Meanwhile, ‘The Further’ seems to be the afterlife as a whole, with the universe being ‘deathless’, although it does imply Christian mythos with the Demon’s realm. The ghosts and demons of the Further feel like a greater threat, as they are parasitic creatures trying to steal life and cause pain, rather than find peace.\n\nThe Design – ‘Poltergeist’ had interesting ideas that were let down by the excessive use of CGI. ‘Insidious’ still uses CGI, but only when necessary. The opening credits are well cool here, both in terms of audio and visual design. It really ramped up the tension, that pervading darkness, and you got a thrill out of trying to spot the unnerving and uncanny. The follow-through isn’t quite on the same level, but I still enjoyed the artistic approach, as well as the use of Prosthetics and Make-up. The Ghosts by the climax where more like actors at a scare event, but it was still creepy and fun.\n\nThe Scares – It’s scarier. There are more jumps and bumps in the night, although I kind of wished they’d held back a little longer.\n\nI wasn’t too frightened, but I had a grand time! In fact, I think I might be intrigued enough to seek out those sequels at a later date…\n\n…\n\nWill the two of us be trapped in the basement for all eternity? What are the sinister schemes of our kidnappers? Will the red door be the gateway to our freedom, or our suffering? Find out next time on 31 Days of Spoop!\n\nMarvel Studios returns with another adventure starring caped crusaders. Only this time, ☿☾magic☆Ω has been introduced to the ever expanding cinematic universe, with no doubt far-reaching consequences. (My dear Readers are asked to bear in mind that Marvel can be very alienating for new-comers, and it is recommended that you are completely up to date with the movie franchise before watching this feature if you wish to understand what the hell is going on!)\n\nDoctor Steven Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is a top neurosurgeon with an overwhelming ego, until a car accident irrevocably damages all the nerve endings in his hands. With the tools of his trade seemingly beyond repair, his desperate quest to heal them leads our skeptic to investigating Eastern medical practices in Nepal. Here he discovers the temple of Kathmandu and begins learning the mystic arts under The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), who with her followers harness energy from other dimensions to shape our reality. As well as safeguard it from darker forces of the spiritual realm. With the zealot Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen) intent on finding immortality and destroying the world as we know it, can Strange become the sorcerer the universe needs…before it’s too late?\n\nLet’s start by addressing the Asian Elephant in the room. Marvel, like many other production companies in recent years, has come under fire for white-washing the cast of ‘Doctor Strange‘, after they changed the ethnicity of our surgeon’s wise and powerful mentor from Tibetan to ‘Celtic’. With positive representation of our planet’s Asian population in Western mainstream cinema still shockingly low, many were rightly furious at this alteration. Why would Marvel, who have thus far been very calculating in their production and marketing, make such a controversial decision? The Answer: China. China has the second biggest box office in the world, and to say the government gets pretty touchy when attention is drawn to Tibet is something of an understatement (#FreeTibet). Whether Marvel sold out for profit or not is entirely dependent on their moral and political views in the first place, which we’ll probably never know, but they seem to have attempted to reach a compromise by portraying The Ancient One as an androgynous sorceress. But as decent as Swinton’s performance is, it just prompts more troubling questions. Why couldn’t the character be female and Nepalese? Separating the movements of Gender and Racial Equality in such a binary manner only trivializes them, moves us further away from Intersectional Feminism and encourages the perception that there is either White or Other. And where are all the Nepalese wizards generally? How come we can call a film diverse when amongst the main roles there are only two non-white actors: Black actor Chiwetel Ejiofor and Chinese actor Benedict Wong respectively. Not to mention all the cultural appropriation that holds up the plot’s foundations (an American travels to the Himalayas to seek spiritual wisdom from two Brits), and some very disconcerting comments about the natives, Eastern religion and it’s practices (there are implications that the other gurus and the villagers on the streets outside are inferior “savages”).\n\nIf you feel like you can get past the ethical problems posed above, then you should be at least partially entertained by this addition to the MCU. That is, unless you are any younger than 13 years old. Don’t worry, the 12A certificate is more than fair, but the grand action sequences and crazy SFX are slotted between long scenes of intellectual and metaphysical discussion that might be either too complicated or too boring for your smaller Marvel fan. There were a number of children in my screening that muttered, fidgeted, and found excuses to leave their seats as Cumberbatch contemplated the nature of existence. The fact that Marvel has gotten more ambitious in philosophical debate and cosmic scope isn’t a bad thing, but it just may not be their most kid-friendly venture.\n\nMy own eyes did glaze over at points, but that was during the fight sequences. The popularity of epic battles and save-the-world scenarios of late might’ve just desensitized my appreciation for these brawls, but that fact is, aside from a few instances of cool imagery and visual effects, the magic of ‘Doctor Strange‘ isn’t that impressive. Or strange, for that matter, at least compared to the comics. You can see some of the more interesting influences like the psychedelic period of the 70’s and the artwork of M.C. Escher in the film’s aesthetic, but for my taste not nearly enough, heavily diluted as it is from the need to maintain the running Marvel tone and emulate the success of Christopher Nolan‘s mind-boggler ‘Inception‘ (2010). Marvel has yet to have given it’s franchise an infectious enough score, and though they get close with Michael Giacchino’s trippy, New Age soundtrack, we don’t really get to enjoy it until the finale. Come on, Marvel, give us a stronger running motif!\n\nFor all the flaws, you will leave the cinema having had a relatively fun time. Cumberbatch was the only choice for this role, and his character arc is gratifying. The ever-so-slightly forced romance between Strange and fellow-surgeon Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams) is played well enough (even if you do have to deal with the reappearance of the whole ‘I am a man, and I have to leave to save the world now, be a good girl and wait here’ shtick), The acting all round is average to pretty good. It could’ve been better had the script been as deep emotionally as it was in thought, but as usual in Marvel the dialogue is quick-witted, which along with the physical gags that will keep you laughing and engaged. I advise going in with…average expectations for a middle of the road addition to the greater MCU story-line, but excited about what a sorcerer’s inclusion in The Avengers could mean for future films.\n\nSo, grab some popcorn, sit comfortably and open your mind to the possibilities. And, as always with Marvel, never leave until the credits are well and truly over.\n\n3/5 stars\n\nCertificate: 12A\n\nRunning time: 115 minutes\n\nDirector Ken Loach, well-known for his strong realist style and socialist ideals, emerged out of retirement in response to last year’s UK election to voice his next public outcry for the suffering working class: ‘I, Daniel Blake‘. If you have a problem with films carrying a political message, that is an understandable position, but one that has no place in watching Loach’s work. Because the stance he takes and his expression of those concerns is entirely the point. Nothing is being slyly snuck in, nor is there any unchecked bias. Loach is telling these specific stories to try and highlight an injustice, to maybe change the world, or at least some peoples attitudes.\n\nIn my case, I had come in already partially aware and outraged at the bureaucratic idiocy faced by those in poverty, but by the half-way point I was ready to come out the cinema prepared to do more about it.\n\n‘I, Daniel Blake’ is bleak to say the least. There are wonderful slices of homely happiness and humour, but these are interwoven with the true-to-life hardships and heart-break of what is the every day for many in Britain. Daniel Blake (Dave Johns) is a middle-aged carpenter in Newcastle recovering from a heart-attack that’s put him out of his work, but his efforts to get much needed state welfare become a kafkaesque nightmare as the benefits system denies him assistance and sends him round in circles. An encounter with newcomer and single-mum Katie (Hayley Squires) facing similar troubles begins a warm friendship of mutual support, but can the two of them beat an impersonal Jobseekers Centre that seems intent on wearing them down?\n\nThe film’s tone is perfect: a grey, no-nonsense ‘this is how it is’ approach bathed in cold light. And yet there are scenes of community and kindness that illuminate the story in their simplicity and humble generosity. The transitions, fading in and out of darkness, mark the passing of time whilst also giving the audience a moment of pause and reflection. Almost the Black Mirror effect, except it’s an actual mirror. The dark reality is ours, here and now. The film isn’t a documentary or an attempt at Dogme 95 by any means, but the cinematography, editing and sound design are done subtly, avoiding any kind of spectacle, and echoes a sense of old-school Naturalism that is starting to fade out of use in the arts.\n\nLoach is famous for employing ordinary people without any acting experience, or picking out fresh talent, and using improvisation as a tool to create authenticity. So the choice of casting Johns as the lead is not unusual, and is a very smart choice. He may not have done any credited acting, but his skills in stand-up comedy and improv lend themselves well to a character who is battling what he describes as “a monumental farce”. He gets some of the funniest lines too, which he delivers with expert comic timing whilst retaining a sense of the literal every-man. Does his lack of acting experience show occasionally? Yes, but Loach’s choice to cast unknowns adds equal parts charm and realism to his depiction of the estates. However, the performance that steals the spotlight is without a doubt Squires, who since graduating Rose Bruford College in 2010 has only starred in a handful of plays, TV series and movies in small or supporting roles. But she is a real find and an actor to watch. Avidly. Her believable and emotional portrayal of Katie and her struggles was the main reason I had tears running down my cheeks. My only fear is that this is going to be one of those performances that doesn’t get the credit it’s due when the awards get passed around. (Squires is also a playwright, which may explain her abilities, being able to carve out the text and avoid her dialogue sounding ‘scripted’).\n\nOverall, the acting from everyone was rather good, and at the end of the day the weaker scenes in that regard would be my only gripe with this picture. An outstanding piece of cinema with a great, observational screenplay from Paul Laverty, ‘I, Daniel Blake’ is as much a war-cry as a cry for help. The stories circulating as a result of people opening up about their personal struggles with our flawed system after seeing it is crushing, but a sign of hope too. That maybe if enough of us speak out in anger and use art as our soap box for these problems, then we could disgrace our Tory government into acknowledging the issue and actually doing something helpful and compassionate about it. We could dream, eh? Do, DO see ‘I, Daniel Blake’ if you can, but be prepared to leave in solemn silence. A devastating drama, one of the best films you’ll seen this year.\n\n4.5/5 stars\n\nCertificate: 15\n\nRunning time: 100 minutes\n\nWhiiiissssstttllleeeeeesssss…\n\nOnce Pippa was calmed down and sent back up the stairs with the sour-faced nanny, we freshened up and rejoined our hosts at the dinner table. Chairs remained empty, food was getting cold. “Please, dig in” sighed Madeline. Tentative first bites become a ravenous rush of teeth and tongues. Our throats are thick with our wolfish appetites, beyond our control. The meal, to put it simply, was divine. Except for a chalky after-taste. “Do try the wine!” beamed Norman. “Or perhaps some tea?” Madeline chimed in, “It’ll warm you!” We nod eagerly as she pours piping hot brew into our teacups. 18th century. Elegant in design, but not the best kept, and very jarring compared to the rest of the decor. “They are beautiful, aren’t they,” said Norman with a twinkle in his eye, “one of the few possessions rescued from the rubble of our former residence. Priceless. Both in monitory, and… sentimental value.” We smile and sip. “Oh!” I start, “that’s quite…” “Bitter.” You finish my sentence with more restrained, but I detect some suspicion in your tone that fortunately goes unnoticed by the Ushers. “Yes, so sorry about that, I’ve been trying to perfect my own home-grown recipe, but the ground here is surprisingly infertile, given…well, you know.” “Isn’t my sweetie-pie such a creative, unique spirit? There is no one like my schnukums in the whole, wide world! And I should know, I’ve been married four times! Yes! She makes everything her own!

They are just films that resonate with me in a way that my little heart cannot resist: ‘Edward Scissorhands’ (1990), ‘The Rocky Horror Picture Show’ (1975) and now ‘Crimson Peak’.\n\nIt hits all the right spots for me, and has many other appealing qualities too. For one, this was undoubtedly a project made out of a tremendous amount of love, respect and enthusiasm. The amount of hard work and detail that went into set design alone is awe-inspiring. Every single shot is sumptuous and hauntingly beautiful. Guillermo del Toro along with his crew built almost the entirety of Allerdale Hall at Pinewood Toronto Studios, a feat which truly made the Mansion a character itself. I encourage you upon finishing the movie to buy and read ‘Crimson Peak and the Art of Darkness’ in order to get a full appreciation of the world that they created.\n\nFurthermore, ‘Crimson Peak’ is heavily influenced by, and an adoring tribute to, a bounty of Gothic Art, Literature and Film, always with something new to notice on repeated viewing. For the fans of the genre and it’s history, this film is a real treat. Sure, you can see the story’s plot points and twists coming from a mile off, but that’s all part of the fun! Lie back and bathe in the horror, the seduction and the emotions aching with pathetic fallacy.\n\nI was greatly saddened that after all the blood, sweat and tears, ‘Crimson Peak’ was not at all successful at the box office last year (I saw it at the cinema twice, which is rare for me). I think it was because a lot of people where anticipating something similar to the modern horror movie, with a focus on gore and jump scares, and came out disappointed when they got a story that drew from freights of the past. This is a traditional, suspense driven Ghost Story, of Gothic Romantic origins. This is a film is about feeling a whole spectrum of emotions to their extreme, not just fear.\n\nBut there are problems. The scares don’t hold up on repeated viewing, the dubbing is horrendous, and the focus on emotionally driven character arcs results in a lack of logic and consistency in places.\n\n“Thanks for helping with this burn, my darling. Say, err, Edith? Earlier you asked me whether there had been any violent deaths in the house. May I inquire as to why?”\n\n“Thomas, this may sound peculiar, ever since I was a child I’ve been able to see ghosts.”\n\n“…Well, shit.”\n\nNever-the-less, if you like anything by Edgar Allen Poe, Charlotte Bronte, Mary Shelley, Bram Stoker, Byron or any of the ‘Penny Dreadful’writers, you will enjoy this. Best watched in complete darkness with a box of rich chocolates and someone who you wouldn’t mind getting steamy with after.\n\n— DAY EIGHTEEN: ‘The Evil Dead’ (1981) —\n\nCertificate – 18\n\nRunning time – 85 minutes\n\nThemes – Force of Evil, Evil Book, Curse, Spooky Shack, Summoning, Demons, Woods, Gore, Scary Basement, Possession, Murder, Tree Rape (yes, you read that correctly)\n\nFear Factor – 3/5\n\n*MINOR SPOILERS*\n\nThis movie was the exact opposite of Crimson Peak. Not just in terms of it’s approach to horror, but the fact that this film had NOOOOO budget.\n\nOne of Sam Raimi’s first movies where he wrote and directed, his skills certainly lay in one area more so than the other. The script is TERRIBLE. The acting is as well, but the script makes it hella worse. There is no pacing, and it drags out to an absurd degree. The characters are all brain dead dickholes and terrible friends. A Summary: “Cheryl, oh my God, what happened to you?” *crying* “Help me! Please! The Woods are Alive! I’ve been Raped! We’ve got to leave! I want to leave! Please!” *roll their eyes* “UUUGGGGHHHHHHH DO WE HAVE TO?” What the hell!\n\nAlso, Tree Rape. That whole sequence was deeply unpleasant, and not in a cool way. Not in the way that is meant to universally disgust, create tension and make us empathize with what the character is experiencing. The whole thing is fetishized in a way that is very uncomfortable and infuriating. Why would we be seeing this attack from the perspective of a horny tree and not the victim? Because gross creeps is why. And the worst thing is that this trope is not uncommon. Even today. I’m not saying that we can’t have…Tree Rape in our movies. I’m just saying that it should be used for the right reasons.\n\nI should point out that there is nothing wrong with a film-maker having a few pennies for a budget either. Great movies can be made on a shoe string. But here it really shows, and is often laughable. Some of the practical effects at the very end are nice, but otherwise they are either uninspired or so glaringly obvious it completely detracts from any suspense or fear. The best part of ‘The Evil Dead’ was Raimi’s eye for cool shots. There is undeniable flavour and flair in his ability to contort movement and imagery to his twisted vision.\n\nIf you are a start-up director or a fledgling horror buff and want to see how one of the greats first entered into his craft and evolved from meager means, then sure, go right ahead! But just because this movie was influential, doesn’t mean it has aged well, or was that good to begin with. You have been warned. You can deffo watch this for Halloween, but I would recommend skipping straight to ‘Evil Dead 2’. I watched this’un around 7-ish years ago, and the sequel benefits massively from embracing it’s own campiness.\n\n— DAY NINETEEN: ‘Rosemary’s Baby’ (1968) —\n\nCertificate – 15\n\nRunning time – 136 minutes\n\nThemes – Satan, Anti-Christ, Witches, Occult, Coven, Curses, Rape, Pregnancy, Motherhood, Birth, Potions, Charms, Murder, Kidnap, Entrapment, Mystery\n\nFear Factor – 3/5\n\n*MINOR SPOILERS*\n\nYES. YES. I am INTO this film! Thumbs up all the way!\n\nThis is less a horror story about the coming of the Anti-Christ and more so about the terror of being a woman and not having any control over your own body. And as such, you won’t be recoiling at jump-scares and monsters, but from a growing sense of unease and discomfort, and feeling absolutely awful for a heroine in a horrible situation who you can’t help but root for. Plus, the dream sequence/rape scene and it’s aftermath were expertly done, especially for the time.\n\n*AHEM AHEM* TAKE NOTE, EVIL DEAD *COUGH AHEM*\n\nDo these observations clash with the opinions and actions of writer and director Roman Polanski himself? Yes. But that doesn’t stop us being able to critique the film using feminist theory. Do I feel conflicted about buying the DVD and putting money in Polanski’s pocket? Again, yes. But bad people can make good art. And visa-versa. Normally I try and wait until that artist’s demise before spending money on what they have made, but such a principle would damage my ability to explore the world of film on an academic level.\n\nA twinge of guilt comes with saying that of my first-time viewings this month, ‘Rosemary’s Baby’ is one of my favorites, and that if you haven’t already, you should go and watch this movie immediately. Because God Dammit if it’s not fantastic. In the words of Roman Castevet: “God is Dead! All Hail Satan!” Mwahahaha!\n\n…\n\nWhy are we locked in the Basement? What will happen when we regain consciousness? What will we find? And will we ever escape? Find out when we return to 31 Days of Spoop!\n\n*Mooooaaaannnssss*\n\nPitter patter…\n\n“My darling does like to be fashionably late. She is so…amusing…”. We glance at each other sheepishly. One painfully awkward pause later, I clear my throat. “Sorry, sir, I think there has been some kind of mistake. I’m afraid we’re not your guests. The two of us were just looking to get out of the rain, and when we knocked the door, well, it was already open-” The gentleman’s face falls, but only momentarily. Forcing a casual grin, he exclaims “Good Heavens! You’re quite right! You’re soaked through! I do apologize, someone should have answered the door, only we weren’t expecting anyone so- No matter! My wife and I sent an invite to all our new neighbors, and there are plenty chairs, drinks and…treats…to go around! Let me take your coats and escort you to our amenities, so you can warm yourselves and freshen up before dinner! It shouldn’t be too much longer before we begin, and I can introduce you to my charming spouse!” “My ears are burning!”, someone calls in a sing-song voice. A gorgeous young woman with long, dark hair, soft brown eyes and a flowing red dress descends the stairs, like a feather floating to the ground. “My angel! I would never dare to singe those delicate shells of yours,” our host purrs, his wrinkled hand extending to clasp hers as she reached the bottom, like an amateur actor in a retirement home’s production of a Shakespearean Tragedy . “My dear guests, may I introduce my beautiful bride, my witty wife, Madeline.” “Such a pleasure to meet you, and to know we live in such a welcoming community! We were so worried that no one would come. I mean, after they tore down the old cemetery, and we bought the land to build our new home, we were worried that the locals would be offended!” “Or that the house would be haunted!”, chuckled her husband. “Tsch! Such nonsense! And even ghosts couldn’t have been any worse than the problems we had with our last place! We were residing at the estate my darling Norman had inherited from his mother, but the place was falling apart! Crumbling to the ground!” Old Norman’s cheery facade drops, his voice full of woe. He gazes rather dramatically through the rain splattered window pane, lamenting in a low voice “It was never the same after the fire. Generations of Ushers born and buried at that mansion, now lost forever!” “But look at our wonderful new home!” Young Madeline swirls like a blooming rose as she spins down the hall in her gown, her face beaming. “A work of art! I really made it my own, don’t you think?” We nod, politely. No good offending anyone so enthusiastic. Besides, we are also guests now, apparently. “Madeline, my rare bird, our guests that we…invited got a little bedraggled in the storm. Would you mind showing them to the downstairs bathroom whilst-” But before he can finish, we hear a yelp from the top of the stairs, following by what sounds like a child bawling. “Oh for Heavens sake!” spits Madeline, as Norman charges up the stairs, “I had told the Nanny that they were to be in bed by eight!” Seconds later Norman was trotting back down stairs with two children in tow. The one in tears was a 11 year old girl with microcephaly, clutching her right hand and wailing uncontrollably. Stomping and sulking behind father and daughter was a 5 year old with a bowl cut and the nanny hot on his heels. “Dearest,” growled Norman through gritted teeth, “your son has been on his tricycle indoors again.” “Damien!” Madeline gets down on her knees to her son’s level, “You’ve got to stop being so evil to your step-sister! One more step out of line, and Mummy will get so cross she’s going to have to take away aaalll your trick or treat candy! Do you understand?” “I HATE YOU!!!”, screamed little Damien, his face bright red with rage, “NO-DAD’S A PSYCHO! PIPPA’S A FREAK! AND YOU’RE A BITCH! I HATE YOU ALL!” And with that, the little devil runs back up the stairs, ripping down all the curtains on his way up, and slams a door after him…\n\n— DAY ELEVEN: ‘POLTERGEIST’ (2015) —\n\nCertificate – 15\n\nRunning time – 93 minutes\n\nThemes – Poltergeists, Ghosts, Haunted House, Cemetery, Family, Children, Paranormal investigators, Clowns, Dolls, Scary Trees, Portals, Afterlife\n\nFear Factor – 2/5\n\n*SPOILERS*\n\nI know. UGH. I watched the remake? Bitch per-lease! Trust me when I say I tried to find the original, but to no avail. Which sucks. On the other hand, it does mean that I can watch this movie without as much bias or expectations as I might have had. Sure, all the reviews have said this version was shite, but it couldn’t be that bad, could it?\n\nThe verdict – It’s fine.\n\nIt’s understandable that most people might give it one star if the first was brilliant, or if, like in many cases, a remake was totally unnecessary. But as a stand alone horror movie, particularly of the 21st century, it’s okay. Standard fare. Not impressive, but not terrible either.\n\nThe child actors are a lot more compelling to watch than the mum and dad (Rosemarie DeWitt and Sam Rockwell respectively). This is partly due to the fact that a lot of the fear and tension comes from the kid’s perspective of events, which I enjoyed. But it’s just also because 1) they were good little performers and 2) the parent’s dialogue was TOO SASSY! Sarcastic humour and ‘oh, you’re such a dork’ moments can be great in measured doses, and sure, some of the jokes were fun, but it was waaayyyyy too much and stopped me forming a connection with them. I didn’t care. Even the teenage daughter, a stereotype if there ever was one, was more sympathetic and well-rounded. Bar of course the very forced ‘resolution’ at the end where she apologizes for being a bitch. Even if it was a joke, it was poorly done.\n\nAlthough I was never really frightened, I was intrigued and entertained, mostly around the end of the first act and most of the second. There were one or two jumps, some tension and a few fun ideas, but the CGI was very distracting and reminded me that this was just a stupid movie.\n\nOh, and the big climax? After the fake one? Awful and completely unnecessary. It would have been improved a great deal if the reveal had been made, the car gets attacked, and it cuts to black. This was one of those movies that could have benefitted from a dark, ambigous ending that pulls the rug beneath you. Also it dragged out the running time and made it way too epic/happyclappy a-doooiiii! Plus it created all these stupid questions, stale cheese and popcorn logic.\n\nIn conclusion, boys and girls, I should have seen the original, but if you haven’t seen any of them and are just a scared-y cat dipping your toes outside your comfort zone for the first time, this will work for a Halloween sleepover with Netflix just fine. The stress on ‘fine’.\n\n— DAY TWELVE: ‘THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER’ (1960) —\n\nCertificate – 15\n\nRunning time – 79 minutes\n\nThemes – Cursed Family, Buried Alive, Spooky Old Mansion, Crypt, Skeletons, Murder, Madness\n\nFear Factor – 1/5\n\n*SPOILERS*\n\nThis was the movie I had wanted to see when I saw ‘The House on Haunted Hill’, but I felt alright about watching it at this point, as I believed it was going to be more gruesome than it turned out.\n\nFair warning, as exciting as the film is visually in all it’s indulgent, Gothic, nightmarish glory, the pacing is sllllllllooooooooooowwwwwwwwwwwww as hell. Although, with a plot and/or concept as simple as this one, you understand why Rodger Corman felt it was necessary to drag it out. This was the first of Corman’s long line of adaptions of Edgar Allen Poe’s work, but my no means his debut into the world of B-movie horror (he’s been in the movie business since 1954, and still going!) So it’s clear that this is at least semi-comfortable territory, if rather over-dramatic. Again, this works well with the artistic design and practical effects, from the surreal portraits and burning red candles, Madeline clawing her way out of her coffin with bloody fingers, to that dream-sequence. That dream sequence! So 60’s! And yet so innovative for a decade just dawning. The colours, lighting, shapes, editing, atmosphere YASSS GAWD. That same flair doesn’t translate as well to the performances. Vincent Price of course gets the best monologues, despite is character Rodrick actually being a boring pain in the ass. I mean, his acting is pretty great, but the character is just a irritating mix of self-righteousness and self-pity. The hammy-come-luvvie acting is funny for a while, but as the film goes on it loses it’s welcome. It’s all very repetitive. In fact…\n\nA ‘House of Usher’ Drinking Game:\n\nDrink every time Rodrick Usher tells Philip Winthrope to leave.\n\nDrink every time Winthrope refuses to leave.\n\nDrink every time Winthrope asserts “Madeline and I are leaving”.\n\nDrink every time Winthrope demands to see Madeline Usher, or yells”Where is Madeline?!”, or words to that effect.\n\nDrink every time Winthrope is told that he doesn’t understand, or can’t.\n\nDrink every time Winthrope says “I don’t understand”, or “Tell me what’s going on!”\n\nDrink every time NO ONE TELLS HIM ANYTHING WHEN THEY COULD, EASILY.\n\nDrink every time Madeline is asked to run away, only to reply “I wish I could”.\n\nDrink twice; once when Rodrick starts his monologue, again once he’s finished.\n\nDrink every time Rodrick flinches at a loud noise.\n\nDrink every time Rodrick reacts in a way that Madeline should mirror, but doesn’t.\n\nDrink every time Madeline refuses to eat.\n\nDrink every time the house shakes.\n\nDrink every time someone lights one of those bloody candles.\n\nDrink every time there is a close-up of one of the family portraits.\n\nDrink every time you can hear ghostly ‘woooo’s in the score.\n\nDrink every time Winthrope sees blood.\n\nDown your drink when Rodrick plays the lute, terribly. Immediately drink again if it’s obvious that those listening secretly think it’s awful, but are just being polite.\n\nIt’s a bit of late night Halloween fun with friends, or something to chill out with on the sofa with a blanket one lazy afternoon. However, with my drinking game and the right company, it will be vastly improved.\n\n— DAY THIRTEEN: ‘FREAKS’ (1932) —\n\nCertificate – 15\n\nRunning time – 64 minutes\n\nThemes – Genetic Physical Disfigurement/Disabilities, ‘Freak Show’, Circus, Discrimination, Revenge, Murder, Mutilation\n\nFear Factor – 1/5\n\n*SPOILERS*\n\nThis film isn’t so much scary or shocking as it is upsetting. To think that anyone would be so hateful and prejudiced, both in the past and to this day, is disgusting and heart-breaking. However, ‘Freaks’ is also a fascinating glimpse at history, and the story behind how the movie was made, censored and distributed over the years makes the viewing experience even more inspiring. ‘Freaks’ was way ahead of it’s time, and definitely worth watching.\n\nTod Browning was a clown in a travelling circus before he found success as an actor and director. After turning a huge profit from his 1931 adaption of ‘Dracula’ with Bela Lugosi, Universal studios gave Browning the money to pursue his passion project, with the assumption that it would be a commercial hit. And it was, very briefly. What they didn’t expect was a dark morality tale exposing the daily lives of so called ‘freaks’, their sense of community and the suffering and humiliation they routinely face at the hands of so called ‘normals’. A story of revenge, with a cast of Browning’s real life friends from the freak show his performed along side in his youth, the original full-length version of ‘Freaks’ was lost forever after some of the horrific reactions at the test screening resulted in MGM cutting half an hour’s worth of footage. Of course, the untainted version still ran for a while before the approved film could replace it, and audiences cued around the block to get the full experience. Scenes that were cut included monologues that encouraged sympathy from the audience, and much of the violent climax (Hercules was meant to be castrated by the angry freaks, and then seen later singing in falsetto). The final scene was added on to give a happier ending, but to also undermine the actions of the disenfranchised with regret.\n\nWhilst you could tell that many had never acted a day in their lives, the performances were all pretty good for the period and gave a sense of realism and charm to the picture. I was particularly taken by Daisy Earles as Frieda, the dwarf who loses the affections of her beloved fiance Hans, also a dwarf, to a ‘big woman’. She had so much soul that you fell in love with her almost instantly, and I couldn’t take my eyes off her. As well as a horror and tragic drama, ‘Freaks’ was something of a light-hearted documentary in parts too, with the plot interspersed with what can only be described as vignettes, or ‘slices of life’. This approach was really effective in getting us to empathize and relate to the outsiders and their way of living. There were moments too where the negative treatment was balanced with positive ones, which during that period was not only ground breaking about probably/hopefully educational, especially in the cases of microcephaly where brain development and cognitive issues can make communication difficult.\n\nBrowning’s vision is striking and this avante-garde little wonder should go on everyone’s list for ‘films to see before you die’, but not really a horror, or for Halloween. Unless you want to be the hippest hipster in your social circle.\n\n— DAY FOURTEEN: ‘PSYCHO’ (1960) —\n\nCertificate – 15\n\nRunning time – 109 minutes\n\nThemes – Murder, Madness, Mystery, Motels in the middle of nowhere, Creepy houses, Hitchcock!\n\nFear Factor – 2/5\n\nIt’s almost impossible nowadays to watch this thriller from fresh, because it’s become so ingrained into the public consciousness that the imagery, and the twists, are inescapable. Even if you’ve never seen this movie, you know how good it is.\n\n‘Psycho’ is iconic. And so are every blonde heroine’s eyebrows in Hitchcock’s movies.\n\nMoving on.\n\n— DAY FIFTEEN: ‘The Others’ (2001) —\n\nCertificate – 12\n\nRunning time – 104 minutes\n\nThemes – Haunted House, Ghosts, Madness, Motherhood, Children, Creepy Servants, Post-War, Catholicism, Darkness, Illness, Fog\n\nFear Factor – 3/5\n\nDamn. This is how to get someone hiding behind a cushion.\n\nRule No.1 for Great Horror Movies: Never show us anything until the very very end. If at all. Unless you are directing a schlocky zombie flick, building anticipation and manipulating the audience’s mind with glimpses of SOMETHING (but what?) is da best, yo. Psychological horror. Bitch.\n\n…Shame I figured out the twist before ‘The Others’ had even reached it’s half way point.\n\nYeah, having a good idea of how the story was going to end so early did detract from the suspense somewhat, but impressively not by much. That’s how good it was! There were strict yet seemingly simple rules that begged to be broken, with deadly consequences. Characters are literally kept in the dark. There were tropes and stereotypes, but played realistic enough that you could immerse yourself in the drama. The acting was excellent (Nicole Kidman does a great English accent), with everyone understanding the material without taking the easy route, and the children were both lovable in their believable stubborn and vulnerable behavior. Your expectations and presumptions about the characters, their intentions and reliability were constantly being tested: who is the real villain? The answer might surprise you, as will the tone of the ending.\n\nThe atmosphere as a whole is like the mist that perpetually surrounds the grand Jersey house: mysterious, melancholic and sinister. Plus the 1940’s costumes, set and props are sick, mate.\n\nI remember my big sister watching this at around 11-13 years old, and telling me how scary it was. Being the cowardly custard I was back then, I avoided even looking at the DVD case! So I went into this already riding an at least 14 year old hype train. And ‘The Others’ did not disappoint. You don’t need much to give someone the willies. I wish more horrors like this got made.\n\n(SPOILER: Although the bit was the father was kinda dumb. Sorry Eccleston).\n\n— DAY SIXTEEN: ‘The Omen’ (1976) —\n\nCertificate – 18\n\nRunning time – 111 minutes\n\nThemes – Satan, The Anti-Christ, Christianity, Catholicism, Evil Child, Murder, Suicide, Gruesome Deaths, The End of the World, Prophecy, Blasphemy, Hell Hounds, Family, Weirdo Nannies\n\nFear Factor – 2/5\n\n*SPOILERS*\n\nThis must have been SCANDALOUS and SICKENING in the 70’s. In 2016 this is nothing. Every other horror movie in this day and age is about a possession, the Anti-Christ, or a Demon’s Curse. No one gives a shit. It wasn’t even the flagship of the subgenre: Satanic Horrors had been around for at least a decade before hand.\n\nApart from the disturbing scenes where the first Nanny hangs herself, and the final few frames, there isn’t really much to talk about. ‘The Omen’ gets too bogged down in it’s own mythos, to the point where the plot doesn’t really have a point. A good deal of the film is a fictional documentary/scavenger hunt, with so much detail about the prophecy that it just serves as a backstory to the inevitable sequels. There isn’t even any drama in the ‘will they, won’t they, find the clues/escape fate’, because of course they will/obviously they won’t.\n\nIn short,’The Omen’ was boring. It honestly felt like a waste of time. Culturally significant? Eh. I guess. But not really. And it ain’t really the best Halloween material. Instead, save it for June 6th. Six am.\n\n…\n\nIS LITTLE DAMIEN THE DEVIL HE SEEMS? OR ARE HIS PARENTS TO BLAME? WHAT OF HIS UNFORTUNATE STEP-SISTER? AND WHAT HORRORS CAN WE EXPECT AS THE NIGHT GROWS DARKER, THE STORM WILDER, AND THE GUESTS…FINALLY…ARRIVE? OR WILL THEY? TUNE IN NEXT TIME, FOR…31 DAYS OF SPOOP!\n\n*SCREEEEEEEAAAAAM!*\n\nRumble…\n\nThe weather has turned, and there is a unsettling change in the air about us. The clouds are black and billowing, heavy rain drops slap against our skin, and there are flashes of lightning in the distance: we better find shelter! The last house at the end of the street! Quickly! We make it under the porch, and notice how this house is surprisingly modern in it’s appearance compared to the rest of the neighborhood, as if some deranged contemporary artist went at it with a wrecking ball. The colour scheme is very 80’s, with grey granite clashing with deep mauves, royal blues and…vermillion? Grotesque statues litter the front lawn. What even are they meant to be? Or represent? Ignoring the total lack of taste, we knock on the front door, trembling in our wet clothes. To our surprise, the door is already open. We call out. No response. We step inside. We are immediately taken by the warmth, and the smell of something delicious! Someone’s cooking dinner. Turkey, mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, gravy…we salivate. I swallow, and call out again. This time, we hear a woman’s voice. “Come on through! You’re just in time for supper, dear!” We throw each other a perplexed look, and make our way down the hall, following the sound of cheerful humming. As we pass the staircase, a noise makes you jump and grab my arm. But all I see is a shadow; the shape of a bald figure with a long nose and longer nails passing briefly at the top of the stairs and through a door. Probably just a trick of the light, right? We follow the scrumptious scent into the kitchen, bright and welcoming (despite the outlandish decor). The woman seems to have left a note, beside the inviting spread. ‘Just putting on my face, sweetheart! Please start without me’. We feel a bit awkward eating what is probably a meal for her spouse or child, so we decide to resist temptation and wait for her return. You point out the delightful bouquet centre-piece: little pink flowers unlike anything we’ve ever seen. We bend down for a sniff. That smell…it kind of makes us feel…sleepy. Maybe a relative of lavender? Just then, we hear footsteps behind us. “Ah, the guests have arrived!” We turn to see an older gentleman enter in a rather expensive suit, his hair greying and eyes glinting with mischief. He speaks with the drawl of a smug house cat, “We weren’t expecting you quite so early, but please! Do sit! And pardon my wife’s absence, she will join us for her little dinner party shortly. My darling does like to be fashionably late. She is so…amusing…”\n\n— Day Six: ‘Beetlejuice’ (1988) —\n\nCertificate – 15\n\nRunning time – 92 minutes\n\nThemes – Ghosts, The Afterlife, Haunted House, Death\n\nFear Factor – 1/5\n\nThe Maitlands are taking a little vacation at home, looking to work on their love nest in peace, when a tragic accident finds them eternally trapped as spirits within their own four walls. When the house gets sold to the Deetz family, the insufferable wife drives our ghostly heroes insane, and they decide to try and petrify these new-comers away. But what happens when they seek the help of a sleazy bio-exorcist? And will their paternal feelings for the misunderstood teenage daughter Lydia change their minds?\n\nRevisiting this movie after so many years was very exciting. Being a Tim Burton-Freak in my youth, I watched everything he made and found a reason to love it. With Burton’s second full-length feature, for me it was Winona Ryder‘s character Lydia, the set design, the make-up and practical effects, and of course the use of stop-motion animation. But with my unwavering loyalty deceased, it was time to return to The Ghost with The Most with an unbiased eye.\n\nBeetlejuice isn’t that good, you guys.\n\nMy opinions about the film’s positives still stand. I can also now include to that list an appreciation for Alec Baldwin and Geena Davies‘s endearing couple and the depiction of an Afterlife full of paperwork, case workers and manuals that ‘read like stereo instructions’. There’s a certain pleasure I take out of things that are a bit crap, and a whole lot more from the details of world building. But aside from a first act that has some satisfying poetic irony, a lot of it is just a mess of ideas squashed together into a story that doesn’t make any sense. And that is mostly down to the inclusion of Be- nope. Not saying that name three times. Because he’s not funny. He’s gross and annoying. Which I suppose is the point, yet I wasn’t laughing along with it. Micheal Keaton‘s ghoul is just repulsive, and I get the impression that a lot of the material was just improvised as they went along. I understand that at that time Keaton was trying to break out of being typecast as the romantic leading man, so he’d want to go completely the other way, but Burton turning on the juice and letting him loose just results in chaos. And not the fun kind. (Speaking of sleaze, it’s weird watching it when you know that Jeffrey Jones was charged with possessing and distributing child pornography. *Shudders*).\n\nI wish that the story had just stuck with the relationship between the Maitlands and the Deetz family, along with the legalities of the underworld. You know, toned down a bit. But then again, this was one of Burton’s earliest works, so it’s best going in viewing it as a practice round for his later stuff. As it is, I would say there are plenty better and more seasonal movies to watch this Halloween, unless you are looking for something niche and quotable from the 80’s.\n\n— Day Seven: ‘Coraline’ (2009) —\n\nCertificate – PG\n\nRunning time – 100 minutes\n\nThemes – Beldams, Parallel Worlds, Old House, Children, Motherhood, Child-Murder, Ghosts, Black Cats, Circus, Dolls, General Creepiness\n\nFear Factor – 2/5\n\nGod, this is a great movie! As beautiful as it is creepy, I just had to see it again! And this is my No.1 nomination for what to show your kids this Halloween, besides ‘Hocus Pocus‘. Mark though, this one is a lot scarier. It may even freak you out, grown ups. After all, it’s all about our relationships with our Mums and/or Dads as children, and what it means to be loved by them.\n\nWhen Coraline Jones begrudgingly moves into a new home in a different state, she’s frustrated and reeeaallly bored, feeling neglected by her busy parents. Plus, all her neighbors are weirdos, ESPECIALLY that boy who keeps stalking her. His grandma says the house is dangerous for kids, but when Coraline is given a eerily similar looking doll and discovers a mysterious little door, her curiosity leads her to a parallel world inhabited by her ‘Other’ Mother and Father. They appear exactly identical to her real parents, except they’re fun, affectionate, shower her with treats and attention…and have buttons for eyes. It doesn’t take long for Coraline to fall in love with this new reality. They even invite her to stay forever! On one condition. She too must have those buttons sewn into her eyes. Eek! Coraline starts to realize that all is not what it seems…\n\nThe studio Laika’s debut and masterpiece, ‘Coraline‘ is based on Neil Gaiman‘s children’s book and a marvel of stop-motion animation. If you’re anything like me, I advise getting the movie on DVD and taking your time to nestle into the sofa to watch the bonus features as well. The labour and creativity of all the artists behind the scenes is equally as magical as the finished product. And then you get to watch it all over again with a whole new perspective!\n\nDespite having seen this movie many time before, I admit this was the first one in my Spoop series to give me the creeps. That cold sensation you get when you can tell something isn’t right. That something sinister is going on. Henry Selick doesn’t underestimate what his young (and old) audience can handle. It’s got enough thrills and scares to create tension, atmosphere and an adventure with stakes, without it crossing the line into truly disturbing territory.\n\nWith superb voice acting, music, aesthetic and story-telling, this is a film to watch at anytime of year, but especially now. Have a Halloween Movie Night with the kids, on a rainy evening, with the lights on and the cuddles close.\n\n— Day Eight: ‘Nosferatu’ (1922) —\n\nCertificate – PG\n\nRunning time – 81 minutes\n\nThemes – Vampires, Silent Movie, Occult, Plague\n\nFear Factor – 1/5\n\n*SPOILERS*\n\nThis one was not as spooky as I was expecting. There’s a fair bit of skin-crawl-y imagery, but otherwise it really made me chuckle. Even for the silent movies of the era, this one was very simplistic and over-the-top, with a strapping hero whose nonchalance is laughable and a damsel whose frailty and hysteria are ridiculous. I mean, ‘Nosferatu‘ is based on ‘Dracula‘ (1897), the classic Gothic novel by Bram Stoker, so the tropes and arcatypes of the genre were to be expected. Furthermore, the craft of the film star in the 20’s took a great deal from theatre forms like Commedia Dell’arte and Tableau, and many gestures would become short hand for an emotion. But the hammy acting pushes it to a point where modern viewers would struggle to take the characters or their plight seriously. And again, there are films from this time where the same performance techniques are applied with far more success.\n\nYou can forgive ‘Nosferatu’ for it’s struggles with lighting and it’s ability to establish temporal setting, as director F.W. Murnau does a good job with limited resources. He certainly had an eye for the mise-en-scene, that goes without saying. But again, the narrative, especially as we get into the second half, is rather disjointed with quite a few loose ends. For example, what was the point of Professor Bulwer as a character? Dude gives cool metaphor and commentary on the vampire and nature vs supernatural, but does zero for the plot. Useless.\n\nThat said, the 1922 version of ‘Nosferatu’ is absolutely worth watching, if only for crossing it off your checklist for historically and culturally significant contributions to cinema.\n\nDat staircase scene, tho.\n\n— Day Nine: ‘Invasion of the Body Snatchers’ (1978) —\n\nCertificate – 15\n\nRunning time – 115 minutes\n\nThemes – Aliens, Possession, Disease, ‘Don’t Feed the Plants’, Clones, Splicing\n\nFear Factor – 2/5\n\n*SPOILERS*\n\nWoof. Can we just talk about the chemistry between Donald Sutherland and Brooke Adams for a second? Holy shit balls, it got hot in here real quick! Dayum! Just make out already!\n\nAhem. Okay, onwards with my opinions. So far, of all the films so far that I’ve watched for the first time (which admittedly isn’t many), this Sci-Fi Horror has to be my favourite! (I am really fond of Sci Fi Horrors in general, aka ‘2001: A Space Odyssey‘ (1968), ‘Alien‘ (1979), ‘Under the Skin‘ (2013)). It’s got…\n\nGreat practical effects that have aged rather well\n\nA script that was an ace contemporary adaption from the 1955 novel by W.D. Richter (apart from lines like “He would eliminate whether Geoffrey was having an affair, or had become gay. Whether he had a social disease, or had become a Republican”, not too dated)\n\nAmazing direction from Philip Kaufman! Tension you could cut with a butcher’s knife! Expert delivery of a disturbing concept. What would you do? What could you do?\n\nUniversal themes given room to breathe and spread like weeds\n\nThe gritty realism of the cinematography by Micheal Chapman\n\nThe paranoid mood that seeps into every crevis\n\nEvocative use of sound effects and music\n\nWonderful performances all round\n\nDid I mention steamy chemistry?\n\nLeonard Nimoy being an obvious dickhead (RIP)\n\nBaby Jeff Goldbloom\n\nAn awesome little tribute to the ’56 movie with a cameo from Kevin McCarthy\n\nThat random scene with the vicar on the swing staring at the kids…\n\nIt’s not the most seasonal of flicks, but if you haven’t seen it WATCH IT! It’ll have your heart pounding! Your mind racing! And the last scene will make you go ‘no no no noooooooooo uuurrrrrrggghhhhh!” Shivers! 10/10! Will try and get on DVD!\n\n— Day Ten: ‘The House on Haunted Hill’ (1959) —\n\nCertificate – 12\n\nRunning Time – 75 minutes\n\nThemes – Haunted House, Ghosts, Skeletons, Murder\n\nFear Factor – 2/5\n\n*SPOILERS*\n\nI went in search of a lot of other Vincent Price movies before I gave up and settled on this one. At first I was pleasantly surprised. It was an intriguing concept, and had a distinct ‘Clue‘ (1985) vibe. A Haunted House Dinner Party, thrown by a playboy millionaire and his ‘amusing’ wife. Stay the Night and Survive till Morning, receive $10,000. But once the clock struck midnight and the gaggle of guests were all trapped inside the house until dawn, it all started going to shit. The anticipation and build up was wasted by a what was a really disappointing pay off. SPOILER ALERT: No actual ghosts. All ruse after elaborate ruse. Plus red herrings. And so much that goes unexplained/makes no sense.\n\nVery Hallow. Much Ween. But…eh.\n\nP.S. It would have been way more fun if the traumatized drunk had been a secret vampire. In the talking heads sequence I thought he was hiding fangs. He wasn’t. Boooo!\n\n…\n\nWhat Fate Awaits Us In That Uncanny House? Are Our Hospitable Hosts To Be Trusted? And Most Worryingly Of All…What Movies Will I Review NEXT? Find Out, In…31 DAYS OF SPOOP!\n\n*Lighting Strikes*\n\nCreeeeeaaaaaakkkkkkk…\n\nWe’ve made it across the pumpkin patch and reached the last street of this quiet rural suburb. The houses here are older, grander, and are populated by some of the more, err, kooky residents. A man with slicked back hair, a mustache and a smoking jacket plays golf on a balcony. A black cat stalks the front of a run down little museum, hissing at anyone who comes too close. And four teenage Goth girls practice Wiccan chants beneath a tree…\n\nBTW: I had planned a slightly different selection this week, but having limited resources may prove a fun, interesting challenge for this project of mine!\n\n— DAY THREE: ‘The Addams Family’ (1991) —\n\nCertificate – PG\n\nRunning time – 99 minutes\n\nThemes – Haunted House, American Gothic, General Spoop, Family\n\nFear Factor – 1/5\n\n*SPOILERS*\n\nAnyone already familiar with the 90’s Addams Family movies will know that the second, ‘Addams Family Values‘ (1993), was by far the more superior film. Sure, they shared the same problems, but it had an exquisitely camp villain and the legendary summer camp subplot that made for spoopy fun from start to finish. ‘The Addams Family‘ on the other hand is more hit and miss.\n\nGomez, Morticia, Pugsley and Wednesday Addams are a wealthy, eccentric and spooky family who live in a haunted mansion with Granny, man-servant Lurch and ‘Thing’ (a decapitated hand with a life of it’s own). Tully the family lawyer teams up with two con-artists in a bid to fleece them of their hidden fortune. But the plan starts to back fire when the accomplice posing as long-lost Uncle Fester gels too effectively with the creepy clan…\n\nThe main issue here is the plot. It just doesn’t work, either on a structural level, as a logical/compelling arc, or as the right vehicle for the jokes and visual gags that made cartoonist Charles Addams’s New Yorker panels so successful in the first place. Or the long line of television adaptions, for that matter. With the family seemingly invulnerable to danger and sadomasochistic in their delights, there are no stakes to hold up the story. Even when they do begin to suffer (finding themselves homeless and broke), it doesn’t really matter, because it’s their bond and their strange personalities that make them whole. And entertaining to watch. Plus, it all comes too late and too brief, with a convoluted conclusion that screams lazy writing. Because no cares about the drama. Because there are no stakes!\n\nMaking the relationship of two estranged brothers the focal point was also a bad move. Simply due to that fact that, as a character, Uncle Fester isn’t interesting enough to give forward momentum to a movie’s emotional journey. Or at least, not this interpretation. His dialogue is uninspired and lacking in humour, and Christopher Llyod’s performance is far too gurning and clownish. He’s at once too gross and not gross enough. He improves in the sequel, but that’s because Uncle Fester is given the role of the love-sick fool rather than a torn, bewildered criminal.\n\nDespite all of this, ‘The Addams Family’ is very watchable. The comedy is at it’s best when the family are just going about their daily lives and getting into small shenanigans. The film’s look is faultless, and the chemistry between Gomez and Morticia is…throbbing. Even seventy-eight years on from their press debut, they are still a refreshing representation of married life: in a sea of lazy, moronic husbands and their nagging wives, Mr and Mrs Addams are not only completely besotted, but treat each other as respected equals. They are always on the same team. And all the more blissfully ‘unhappy’ for it. As for Christina Ricci’s Wednesday, she is still written a little too child-like and innocent at this point, but you can see the seeds of what’s to come in the sequel starting to take root…\n\nMaybe if the film had been half an hour shorter, and with a narrative more in keeping with the live-action TV show, it could’ve, well, been better! When will producers and company execs learn? A plot where everything is at stake, does not a successful movie make. Sometimes it’s the films on a smaller scale that make the biggest impact, that have the highest quality, and that radiate the most love. Even if that doesn’t make the most money in the short term, it brings in the big bucks long term.\n\n— DAY FOUR: Hocus Pocus’ (1993) —\n\nCertificate – PG\n\nRunning time – 96 minutes\n\nThemes – Witchcraft, Magic, Curses, Halloween, Child Murder, Zombies, Black Cats, Teenagers and Children, Siblings\n\nFear Factor – 1/5\n\n*SPOILERS*\n\nThis might actually be the perfect Halloween movie, at least for younger audiences. It’s just the right amount of dark and scary, whilst also being extremely silly and a bit camp. It’s an adventure, it’s a comedy and Baby’s First Horror Movie. And it’s set on All Hallow’s Eve! In freaking Salem! And to top it all off, we have Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy playing the wicked Sanderson Sisters, witches who have returned from the dead after 300 years to run amok (amok, amok, amok!) take the life essence of all the little children and become young and beautiful forever. They are unquestionably evil, but are such an effective comic trio that you can’t help but root for them a little bit.\n\nThe only issue one take really take with this movie in 2016 (the rest of the flaws are all part of it’s charm), is it’s obsession with virginity as something shameful. Our hero Max is ridiculed by everyone around him for being a ‘Viiirrrgin’, like primary school kids on the playground would, except they would only have the vaguest concept of what the word means. It’s ridiculous, to say the least. The 90’s was a different time, but nowadays hearing a boy, who seems barely legal to be honest, being humiliated for not having had sex yet is confusing and a little uncomfortable. We still have a problem with pressuring guys with the idea that being a ‘man’ means being highly sexually active, whilst being a girl means to protect your ‘virtue’, but at least progress is being made with Generations Y and Z.\n\nAside from that, ‘Hocus Pocus’ is a 10/10 Spooptastic must this October, and fun for all the family! Grab your sweetest snacks, dim the lights and snuggle up together for a cackling good time! SISTAAAAAAS! Come, we fly!\n\n— DAY FIVE: ‘The Craft’ (1996) —\n\nCertificate – 15\n\nRunning time – 101 minutes\n\nThemes – Witchcraft, Magic, Wicca, Teenagers, Suicide, Murder, Creepy Crawlies\n\nFear Factor – 1/5\n\n*SPOILERS*\n\nContinuing our witchy theme, we reach a point where we have something that’s not kiddie friendly, without exactly being very scary either. The subject matter is mature, but this movie is less about the terror and way more about the draaamaaaa.\n\nWhen the troubled Sarah moves state and arrives at her new Catholic High School, she ends up befriending three Gothic outcasts who practice Wicca, and becomes the fourth in their coven. Calling on the elements, they worship Manon, cast spells and begin exploring their new found powers. Including placing curses on those who cross them. But when Nancy decides that she wishes to invoke the spirit, things start to get out of hand…\n\nThe strength of ‘The Craft‘ as a spooky teen drama is in it’s confident three act structure and sense of identity. It’s style, atmosphere and (let’s be real) fashion choices, have made it more of a cult classic then a family favourite like ‘Hocus Pocus‘. That and the fact that Fairuza Balk’s performance as moody ol’ Nancy is OTT crazy to the max, yo.\n\n‘The Craft’ opens up a corpse full of worms when it comes to teenage topics and moral lessons. Sisterhood, Mean Girls, Bullying, Sex, Rape, Suicide, Self-harm, Domestic Violence, Disfigurement, Power, Corruption…to name a few. And to varying degrees of success. The biggest let down comes in the form of racism: both in it’s presence and it’s attempts to address it. Rachel True plays Rochelle, who’s main ‘character trait’ is the fact that she’s black. Her main obstacle to overcome is a racist classmate, and bar an interest in swimming, that’s pretty much all we know about her. Because the writers couldn’t seem to decide who she was, or they stuck to those details and called it a night. All the other characters have an arc, but what of Rochelle? Is she a goody-two-shoes? Is she kind? Nope, apparently not, but where did that come from? Oh she’s nice, nope she’s nasty, what IS she? When she drinks of her sisters during the coven’s initiation, she wishes to love those who hate her, but by the end she can’t even forgive the bully who is trying to redeem herself. So what is that saying about how African Americans should deal with oppression? Hmmm…\n\n‘The Craft’may not be the most accurate depiction of a religion, but certainly does enough to spark an interest in researching Wicca and Pagan rituals in more depth. Grab your girl friends and some popcorn, light some candles and get brooding. Now is the Time. This is the Hour. Ours is the Magic. Ours is the Power.\n\n…\n\nI hope to see you soon, my pretties, for the next installment of 31 Days of Spoop! The Witching Hour approaches still…\n\nBOO!\n\nYou came back! My, you are covered in goosebumps! Not to worry, we are only on the very outskirts of the deep, dark forest, with civilization close at hand! Let us trump through a sincere pumpkin patch, but watch your step! There have been quite a few owls hanging about 4 Privet Drive, and the thing with birds is they can leave a terrible…mess.\n\nBTW: Due to a well busy schedule, I will be watching some of these movies in bulk! Per examplé, tomorrow I plan to have a triple feature show in my living room!\n\n—- DAY ONE: ‘It’s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown!’ (1966) — Certificate – U Running time – 25 minutes Themes- Halloween, Trick or Treat, Autumn, Pumpkins, Apple Bobbing, Childhood Fear Factor – 0/5\n\n*SPOILERS*\n\nThis short was one I’d never seen before, but I became aware throughout my ‘top recommendations for Halloween movies’ research that it was a popular staple of USA television at this time of year. And I am not at all surprised! It’s a delightful bit of Americana, and as a Brit it really showcases the traditions and general mood of the ‘fall’ and it’s festivities.\n\nIt’s Halloween, and the Peanuts gang are planning to go trick or treating around the neighborhood before heading to a party. That is, except for young Linus, who every year embarrasses his sister Lucy by waiting in the most ‘sincere’ pumpkin patch he can find all night for the Great Pumpkin to appear, flying through the sky and giving all the good boys and girls presents. Meanwhile, Snoopy has dressed up as a WWII fighter pilot, and fantasies about taking down the Red Baron in an airborne dog fight…\n\nThe animation is adorable, if a little screwy in places, but other than that it’s aged remarkably well. The music is cute, the voice acting charming, and the humor still holds up, with a mixture of deadpan pessimism and childlike naivety (“All you have to do is walk up to a house, ring the doorbell, and say ‘tricks or treats’!” “Are you sure it’s legal?”). The colour pallet of all things was what really brought out the soul for me, the bright oranges, deep navy blacks and mellow yellows getting me right in the feels. Peanuts has always been as much for adults as it is for kids, but I found my inner-child really came out while watching this Halloween adventure. In the past it was the other way around, with the young me feeling a lot more sophisticated for understanding the grey tone.\n\nThere have been some American parents in recent years that have voiced their concerns that ‘It’s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown!’ is too mean for modern kiddie winks; with Charlie Brown being given rocks instead of treats, Linus sleeping out in the cold alone waiting for a magical pumpkin that never comes, and the overall skepticism of the old Peanuts cartoons, many are starting to wonder whether it is time to put this viewing custom to rest. It’s true that the short doesn’t shy away from the cruelty and melancholy of our world, but in my opinion there is nothing spiteful enough there to warrant it being taken off the air, or given a higher rating. Good grief! In our society there is still a fear of expressing emotions. From as early as six years old I can recall being berated by an adult for feeling sadness, and this pressure on children to be happy, obedient little robots isn’t at all healthy. Will it encourage bullying? Maybe in older children, but they’ll likely be the ones already being brats looking for new ways to humiliate their victims. Honesty is important, and sometimes the world isn’t sunshine and roses. If it was, we wouldn’t learn anything.\n\nI recommend this cute little animation for small tots and nostalgic grown-ups looking for something gentle before bedtime. Snuggle up with your sweet babboo, and enjoy this classic cartoon!\n\n— DAY TWO: ‘Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone’ (2001) — Certificate – PG Running time – 152 minutes Themes – Witchcraft, Magic, Good vs Evil, Childhood, Creatures, Halloween, Christmas Fear Factor – 1/5\n\nIt’s no secret that I fucking love Harry Potter. The Books. The Movies. Everything. JK Rowling created the universe that was my childhood, and it will eternally have a very special place in my heart, warts and all.\n\nNow that’s out of the way.\n\nFor those who have been living under some kind of enormous, culture-less rock, the Harry Potter saga begins on the night of his parent’s death, with The Boy Who Lived being left on the doorstep of his Muggle (Non-Magic Folk) Aunt and Uncle, The Dursley’s. They are not a very friendly bunch, and Harry has a miserable existence sleeping in the cupboard under the stairs. After his family destroy all the letters he’s been getting from owls, Hagrid finally comes to say ‘Your a wizard, ‘arry’, and get him on the train to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. There he meets classmates Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, and gradually discovers that Headmaster Dumbledore is hiding something…a secret in danger of falling into the wrong hands.\n\nThere are far too many things to praise about this movie: the score, the cinematography, the editing, the sets, costumes, props…maybe not all the acting. Or the CGI. But it’s so bloody charming and detailed that it’s easily over-looked.\n\nRevisiting the first movie outside of a magical marathon was strange at first, but then it quickly became apparent why this chapter in the series had gotten featured on so many lists as a stand-alone seasonal movie. Sure, the narrative moves over the course of an entire year rather than October, and yet there is an intense autumnal feel that’s hard to shake. Maybe it’s the atmosphere, the weather, or the copious amount of jumpers being worn. Maybe it’s because it is set in a school not long after many young’uns have returned to their classrooms. Or maybe it’s because there are wizards and shit.\n\nWhatever the reason, I thoroughly enjoyed revisiting the Philosopher’s Stone from a new perspective. Although to be honest I did end up quoting along to the entire thing, so there was no drilling out the childhood memories all together. In fact, even as I made fun of some moments, I still found myself getting emotional come the final scene. Because like Harry Potter, returning to Hogwarts is like coming home.\n\nThere is nothing to be scared of here, unless you are under the age of nine. (Even though, SPOILER, little Harry Potter legit kills a guy, something that gets brushed over and forgotten real quick). This might be a good one for parents who a) want to test the waters this holiday, or b) want to introduce their children to the magical world of Harry Potter. In the case of the latter, read them the books first though, you won’t regret it.\n\n…\n\nStay tuned, my rotten readers, for the next installment of 31 days of Spoops! Sleep tight!
