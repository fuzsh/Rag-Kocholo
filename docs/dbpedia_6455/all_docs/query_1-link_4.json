        "text": "THE title of Lisa Cholodenko’s wonderful new film, “The Kids Are All Right,” quotes an ancient youth-culture anthem by the Who: a song released before the parents of many of today’s teenagers were born. At least for members of my generation (to stick with the Who’s back catalog for a moment) the phrase’s original defiance has given way to anxious, fingers-crossed hopefulness. In the context of Ms. Cholodenko’s movie  a comedy of domestic manners and misunderstandings set amid the liberal-minded American middle class  “The Kids Are All Right” is a statement shadowed by an implicit question: Aren’t they?\n\nSure they are. Right? They have cellphones and pizza money just in case we’re late getting home. They have access to healthy food, good schools and cool stuff. But of course we can’t help worrying, as every aging generation has since the invention of modern adolescence back when our grandparents were young.\n\nKids these days! They spend all their time playing video games or texting and sexting and cyber-bullying instead of reading and going to movies. And when they do go to the movies, it’s to see the dumb action blockbusters and slasher pictures that are ruining the experience for everybody else. Instead of going steady, they “hook up.” What kind of music are they listening to? What kind of jobs are they going to be able to find? Where did we go wrong?\n\nMaybe we didn’t. There is a chance that Ms. Cholodenko and Stuart Blumberg, who together wrote the screenplay for “The Kids Are All Right,” meant the title to be sincere and reassuring, though without entirely letting the parents off the hook. Maybe the implication is that the younger set is doing better than their solipsistic, dysfunctional elders. Or maybe that’s a bit harsh.\n\nBut it does seem that the difficult relations between parents and semi-independent, no-longer-cute-and-precocious offspring have caught the eye of filmmakers lately. Of course clueless, hapless or antagonistic mothers and fathers have been a staple of cinema at least since Jim Backus stood in his apron and endured James Dean’s histrionic whining in “Rebel Without a Cause.” (Sorry, but that’s how it looks to me now.) But alongside these more familiar intergenerational patterns  and at a time when the childishness of grown men and the childlessness of grown women are the twin axioms of mainstream big-screen comedy  there is also a quieter sense of rapprochement and mutual sympathy.\n\nThe parents in “The Kids Are All Right” are Nic and Jules, a lesbian couple played by Annette Bening and Julianne Moore, who have never been more enchanting or seemed less like movie stars. With their Volvo and lovely-but-not-fancy house, Nic and Jules are a picture of middle-class contentment, their complacency lightly mocked and their frustrations treated with affectionate empathy by the filmmakers. They seem like good parents, and in the end their two children might agree.\n\nThose children  Joni, who is 18 and about to leave home for college, and her 15-year-old brother, Laser  certainly lead complicated lives, but the problems that keep the movie veering from farce to melodrama and back again do not primarily belong to them. Joni, a stellar student and dutiful daughter (played by Mia Wasikowska of “Alice in Wonderland”), is put off by the way her best friend, Sasha, “sexualizes everything” and is also attracted to Jai, a cute, nerdy buddy who does not seem to reciprocate her romantic interest. Laser, under the sway of an obnoxious and anti-social friend named Clay, seems to be tumbling into the male identity crisis that often begins in high school and concludes, if we’re lucky, sometime before retirement.\n\nHis moms think Laser, played with the right measure of mischief and diffidence by Josh Hutcherson, might be gay, a possibility they handle with the earnest, nonjudgmental concern that their straight counterparts might bring. But the questions Laser has about sex, love and biology are at once more basic and more elusive than the relatively simple matter of whether he likes girls or boys. Her brother’s desire to know where he came from  and perhaps also to find some connection with an adult male  leads Joni to contact the anonymous sperm donor who is at least technically their father and who is played by a scruffy and appealing Mark Ruffalo. Jules and Nic, respecting Laser and Joni’s curiosity about this almost mythical character, find the ground of their own relationship shifting in uncomfortable ways.\n\n“The Kids Are All Right” is, to a large extent, about the unstable, comical and sometimes appalling parental triangle that emerges among the three adults. This article, however, is about the children, whose real-life counterparts are probably less likely than their parents to flock to a wry independent movie whose marquee stars are, at least to adolescents, unspeakably old. But the teenagers who do tag along may wonder why Mom and Dad (or Dad and Dad, or Mom and Mom, or just Mom or just Dad) are crying at the end, when Joni, as we always knew she would, steps out of the nest and into her own story.\n\nOf course many more children will already have asked themselves the same question about “Toy Story 3.” The pathos in that film is rich and various, but as they did in “Up,” the clever heartstring pullers at Pixar have zeroed in on a phase of the life cycle not generally associated with children’s entertainment. In “Up” the handkerchief moment came early on, as the long, loving marriage of Carl and Ellie Fredricksen was chronicled in a montage that located the film’s emotional heart simultaneously in boyhood and senescence. In “Toy Story 3” the equivalent moment comes near the end, when Andy’s mother, an unsung stalwart of the franchise voiced by Laurie Metcalf, looks around his empty room and wonders where the time went.\n\nIt’s a touching moment, evoking the universal heartbreak of parenthood, but the movie does not stop there. It follows Andy, not all the way to college, but to a stop on the way, the house of a little girl named Bonnie who will inherit Buzz, Woody and all the other toys who have guided Andy through childhood. He does not just drop off the box, but stops to introduce Bonnie and her current toys to the new arrivals.\n\nThe two children, one in the first flush of her juvenile imaginative power, the other in the twilight of his, spend what might be many hours or just a few minutes spinning out new adventures. The tenderness of this little scene is breathtaking, because it finishes the “Toy Story” cycle in an unexpected and entirely convincing way, by showing that Andy, a kind and creative young man, was worthy of the devotion of his toys, and that his decency was indeed the product of that devotion.\n\nAndy, ready to put away childish things, is able to acknowledge what they have done for him. And of course his story has really been theirs all along, in that we know much more about life among the inanimate objects in his room than we do about his interactions with his sister, mother, teachers and friends. But we do know, from the haunting example of Sid, the toy-abuser next door from the first “Toy Story,” that not every child is Andy. Some even grow up to be like Cyrus, the stay-at-home man-child played by Jonah Hill in the recent movie of that name.\n\n“Cyrus,” written and directed by Jay and Mark Duplass, sometimes uses its title character’s situation to harvest queasy laughs. At other moments the filmmakers draw out more unsettling, even gothic implications in an Oedipal triangle involving Cyrus; his sweet-natured single mother, Molly (played by Marisa Tomei); and her new boyfriend, John (John C. Reilly). But as off-kilter as this predicament is, and as icky as the filmmakers sometimes dare to be, the resolution is curiously sweet and affirmative. After much anguish and acting out, Cyrus grows up and moves on, helped by the older man who is both his role model and his rival for Molly’s love.\n\nThe family  as if there were only one kind, ideally or in practice  has been the subject of culture-war skirmishing for a very long time. Depending on your perspective, the movies have been agents of wantonness and amorality or upholders of old-fashioned, even outmoded values. Both conclusions are warranted: there has always been lots of sex in movies, and lots of traditionalism as well. And everyone understands that reality is different.\n\nBut reality nonetheless finds interesting reflections on screen, where even apparently simple stories can be full of ambiguity and contradiction. Take the “Twilight” series, which for all its widely publicized pro-abstinence themes and its nostalgically Victorian sexual morality envisions some fairly radical twists on family life. Bella Swan’s parents are conventionally divorced, loving, lonely people who mostly hover around the margins of her life.\n\nThe alternative to this fractured family is not so much eternal commitment to the vampire Edward Cullen as membership in one of two sprawling nonnuclear groups: the undead Cullen clan, who are not blood relations in the usual sense, and Jacob’s werewolf tribe. Both of these kinship networks offer a way of life that seems emotionally richer  if also more dangerous  than small-town existence. And while there is a bit of suspense about which group Bella will join, there never seems to be any question of her settling down into the nonsupernatural humdrum that lies in store for most of her peers.\n\nBella is different, special, and the great paradox of American life is that everyone else believes they are too. Or at least our children, who labor under intense and contradictory pressures from which the end of adolescence offers at least partial escape. Not that their parents will stop worrying. But there are movies that can offer us at least a measure of comfort. Like Charlie Swan and Nic and Jules and Andy’s mom and Cyrus’s, we try our best and mess things up anyway. And the kids are all right. They can’t help it."
