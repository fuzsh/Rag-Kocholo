        "text": "Bloodline (Netflix) How to write a series which runs into multi seasons? This thought troubles the writers a lot specially in our industry. We have watched feature films for so long that we dont know how to make a plot stick for longer version. It is like asking a 20-20 bat to play in a Test match on day 5 when his/her team is fighting for a draw. Bloodline offers an ideal spread for a writer attempting the longer version. Story unfolds on a simple note, Rayburns are about to celebrate a big occassion, the local community/govt wants to dedicate a pier as a tribute to this family whose restaurant and hotel has provided the town with lot of business and opportunities. The occassion is marred by presence of Danny, the 'prodigal' son. The head of the family and the siblings dont want him around. Why? that give you the first opportunity to weave a backstory and it has been done brilliantly. If you break down the entire first season, its genesis can be traced back to a single event (deathof Sarah Rayburn) that shook the Rayburn family. But the amazing part is the 'unfolding' of this event. Often in our indian families, we keep on believing 'a particular relative' as 'the villain' only to find at the far end that this person is 'a victim' in real. Danny Rayburn and his trial with luck (or badluck) unfolds a series of events that put the very survival of his family at risk. How beautiful plots can be constructed from simple family issues, how trust issues among family members can bring forth a suspense of its own and how the characters are not even close what they pretends to be, all such amazing aspects are reflected beautifully in this amazingly written screenplay. Danny's return is the opening scene and mind you i am in middle of S-2 and it still resonates back to the events set off by his return. At a time when our indian web shows seems to be in a hurry to unfold the suspense, here information lingers on, revealing the true self of a character in bits and pieces like layers of an onion. And this show shatters another myth about longer format, a new writer attempting this format often 'customise' the plot to suit his/her desired end. Thus a particular happening seems to occur not beacuse the plot demands it, of the characters ushers towars it But But just beacause the Writer wants it so. But In Bloodline, when everything seems in equilibrium, the plot twist arises from 'whims of a character'. That is the beauty of a series, like life when we think why a person x did that dumb thing when 'so much good' was already going on in her/his life? This WHY remains the central pull to the amazing plot twists which keep the show running to season after season. A final word, it gets only better as it runs to the second season! So dont miss this one, specially if you are trying to write something of your own in longer format. Surinder Brar #Thebloodline Netflix #screenwriting\n\nI'm coming up on the halfway point for all three of my co-currently publishing novels on Amazon Kindle Vella and I'm getting more and more confident I'll have all three books completed and rough-edited by the end of the year! When I decided to work on three of my books simultaneously I also considered booking a therapy appointment instead, but then I realized I needed to publish these to afford the therapy. So! If you'd like to contribute to Arlene's Mental Health Fund, head over to my website www.arlene-bozich.com and click the Kindle Vella button for all three titles, or else the direct links are here: -\"Burn the Moon\", Near Future Sci-Fi: https://lnkd.in/gzth7swZ -\"Rose of Cimarron\", Wild West Historical Fiction: https://lnkd.in/gtns6Jmz -\"The Devil's Left Hand\", Detective Noir Novel: https://lnkd.in/g_D-EFj3 The blog posts this week, No. 13 \"Strike Out; I Stand With The Union to Reach for the Co-op\" and No. 14 \"September is National Suicide Prevention Month and I Suck at Killing Myself\" are part of my ongoing existential crises. I understand that the problems are systemic, so what am I individually supposed to do about the day-to-day nonsense these antiquated social structures inflict on my life? Currently, all I can think to do is keep writing the blog. If anyone else is having similar feelings ranging from deep despair to absurd madness, I think you'll find some peace and entertainment in these posts. If you currently like the way the world is functioning, you should probably read the posts but I can almost guarantee you will not like them. For these and previous titles like \"Preparing to Dance on Diane Feinstein & Mitch McConnells' Graves; An Obituary Warmup\" or \"An Open Letter to Open Minded Extra Terrestrials; Notes for Would-be Intergalactic Conquerors\", go check out all the posts at arlene-bozich.com/blog - thanks for playing!\n\nThe first book I ever wrote started out as a Christmas short story for my five-year-old son, Rob. He is now 50. The short story ended up being 350 pages long. \"An Old Man Who Walked So Far\" was never published. I was able to get Doubleday to take a look at it. They liked it but said it lacked that famous \"suspension of disbelief,\" a common cliche among publishers. However, even minor encouragement sent me pell-mell on a writing career. The good news is I have always held on to day jobs, which generally related to writing. Along the way, I sold a few books. Below is the Willard Library. Fiction, non-fiction, and those in the works.

Eliot “Four Quartets” I have carried this copy of T. S. Eliot’s “Four Quartets” everywhere I’ve gone since I was twenty. How do you explain something like that? It’s personal. The series of poems that make up this small set speak to me, deeply. There are too many bits and pieces to offer any clear explanation. But I can sketch a couple faint images. In the poems, Eliot takes us on walks in a variety of places each with hidden significance, from a worn-down manor with an empty pool to a field in which the ghosts of religious dissenters still dance to a walk through a World War II air raid in downtown London, the settings all carry the ghosts of something past, something that continues to haunt our present. Eliot uses the eternal word to step out of the moment in time and try to understand these places and their meaning from a timeless perspective. But the words bend and break, unable to accomplish their task. He writes that “Footfalls echo in the memory Down the passage which we did not take Towards the door we never opened” A line that became the central conceit of “Dark Matter,” the popular novel and Apple TV series. This passage is not what it might seem. Rather than a rumination on regret over missed opportunities, the line reminds us that where and what we are now, at this moment in time, is the culmination of all the passages we did not take in life just as much as the passages we did take. We are the sum of the choices we’ve made. Understanding this moment in time relies on understanding all those other timeless moments and their eternal place as moments, as (when they occurred) the now. If we understand that, we can return to this moment in time and know it, truly know it, for the first time. For now, we look through a glass darkly. Yet, this present moment is over even as it occurs and we are left to think of the end, the death of the poet. This is the subject of the final quartet, Little Gidding, in which Eliot wanders London in a ghost patrol with St. Augustine and considers what happens when the words you burn to put on paper today become yesterday’s dead language, reframed, reshaped, reinvented by future poets. And that is only a beginning. But, in this beginning is our end. I’ve run out of space for a Linked In post. Read, live. Take the book in your hand. Make it yours. Use it up in your life. It’s worth nothing on eBay. But it can be an invaluable companion to you. Eliot taught me that.\n\nThis is a funny book. Joel Morris is a phenomenal comedy creator, but he doesn't appear to have written this to plug his podcasts, be a contrarian, or mystify us with hilarious hocus-pocus. He's an intellectual who's capable of sitting down and enquiring beyond the clickbait, probing language, society, and science. He can do serious alright. He's just funny about it. And if you really want to find out how he does it, I can only say \"Read this book\". Comedy professionals are falling over themselves to find references to themselves, a cause for grievance, or both- but other professions should be paying attention too. Just from the ones I know: interpreters and translators need analysis of patterns, anticipation, expectations and the musicality of speech. So does anyone involved in public speaking. Politicians using rhetoric are often remembered for their best (or worst) gags. Diplomats and negotiators tread a fine line between the sublime and the ridiculous. Pomposity is undercut by humour for a reason- so anyone with power needs this work. Civil engineers need this book to understand pre-stressed concrete. OK maybe not that one. But basically, if you've ever laughed at anything, you need this book. It's a question of survival. Or as Nihal Arthanayake put it on BBC 5 Live: \"It will make you laugh BETTER if you understand the technicalities.\" Laugh better, people! (Full disclosure: I know Joel and have discussed some of this crap with him in person and online. But even that experience hasn't put me off wanting to read him banging on about it at greater length here.) https://lnkd.in/e-eVv74G\n\nAuteur Response Blog part 1 The auteur director I have chosen to write about is Jordan Peele. He is a well known African American comedian. He is most known for the TV show Key and Peele. Peele's significance in cinema can be attributed to his groundbreaking work as a writer, director, and producer, particularly in the horror and social commentary genres. I have chosen Jordan Peele because he directed the three films we watched. The films I will be comparing are “Get Out”, “Us”, and “Nope’. Some of the signature themes in the films are the social and racial commentary. In “Get Out”, it delves into the experiences of being Black. Peele is very good at mixing horror and suspense to tackle important social issues. As for visual aesthetics, Peele's films always have a very distinct way of drawing the audience into watching them and making them stand out. The way he uses striking images and symbolism to drive home the themes is amazing. Also, every little thing in these films helps the film's rewatchability because there are certain things you will catch on your second watch that you won’t catch the first time around. Finally, the narrative tendencies of his films are rich in references to pop culture, both past and present. He uses these references to enhance the narrative and add depth to the story. Some examples of the visual language when you watch a Jordan Peele film are that the smallest thing has a purpose. It can be something in the background. In “Nope\", the main threat in the film known as Jean Jacket, normally resides in the clouds, but in an earlier scene the cloud that it normally resides in is shown in the background. Another example would be a song used in the film. In “Get Out”, during the opening credits scene, a tribal song is being played. One of the biggest things is how Peele foreshadows prominent events of his films at the beginning, like during the title sequences. Everytime the film starts Peele shows something that will come back later in the film. This helps the rewatchability factor because you’ll want to watch it again to see what you missed in your first watch\n\nWhat are we reading? Stephen read 12 Steps to a Long and Fulfilling Death by Sarah Smith - released August 2023 - Adult Fiction. His review? Probably-way-too-honest! \"12 Steps\" pokes fun at Hollywood culture, with a predictable cast of almost-stereotype characters (see especially: the psychiatrist), but never goes as far as being an all-out comedy. Or, all that funny. I'm not sure it's really a satire, as it doesn't deeply examine or lampoon any of the characters or situations (at least, not in a way that I can remember a month after reading). It's primarily a paranormal mystery, as there are large sections dealing with heavy themes and without a single joke. At times, it touches on horror, but then quickly gets cold feet and relegates that plotline to the sideline, making the reader ask \"Why did you even introduce a creepy seven-foot-tall emaciated figure that strikes dread into Stacey if you could have more easily told the same story without it?\" In fact, further reflection has the reader asking a lot of \"Why do it this way?\" Why have a protagonist without agency, who can only watch as other people do the work of the plot? Why not just follow the detectives? Why have Stacey be able to affect the living world as much as she does, when this doesn't really pay off in any way? Why have a ghost who can follow her fiance around unseen, then not have her see anything important (unless the detectives find it out in the next scene anyway)? Why do all of this, when it forces you to give a ghost amnesia for the plot to function in the first place? Why twist the plot into knots in service of a tired cliche like amnesia? When you could excise a third of the book by removing the main character -- without affecting the plot -- it leaves the reader wondering what the main character was for. And, a month after reading, those structural questions override the plot in my mind. (Especially since I figured the big twist a quarter or a third of the book ahead of the main character because the author tipped it so heavily, so there was a lot of frustrated waiting for her to catch up.)"
