        "text": "Singing to that wonderful nothing\n\nA journal of a journey to here and now,\n\nputting into words that which can be put into words,\n\niterations and reiterations about gratuitous grace,\n\na tribute to that which is all-pervading,\n\nthat which does all by doing nothing,\n\nis all and is nothing, the whole,\n\n�the timeless, boundless,\n\nformless, nameless,\n\nself-less\n\n.\n\nThe most recent entries are at the top, and are the most on point.\n\nSo what's the point?\n\nIt doesn't take that many words to devise reminders that say what can be said with words about what's the most wonderful nothing.\n\nEach entry strives to be succinct, to not say too much, to not misrepresent the point.\n\nEach part of the whole is like a piece of a hologram, complete unto itself, delivering a whole image.\n\nReading more than one entry increases the resolution of the image somewhat.\n\nDiving into it at any point at random and reading a few entries will suffice in getting the point without having to read every entry.\n\nIn fact, it would probably be better to just let the most recent entry or three suffice, as preceding entries are simply more practice, practice, practice, trying to say more with less, to distill to the essence.\n\nThe main thing is to express as clearly as words can the most wonderful nothing, so that there's no doubt, no ambiguity, and no misunderstanding. The prose is unadorned, pragmatic.\n\nWords are not the nothing itself. We are the nothing itself, the most wonderful nothing.\n\nThe less said about the nothing the better, yet I can't stop writing about it--it's just the most wonderful nothing singing to itself.\n\nAs there's no way of knowing when the bodymind will be no more--as a result of natural cause, or accident freak or commonplace--it's good to relax and just be the nothing.\n\nWhat's a timeless nothing to do with its time anyway?\n\nSix Advisements\n\nLet go of what has passed\n\nLet go of what may come\n\nLet go of what is happening now\n\nDon�t try to figure anything out\n\nDon�t try to make anything happen\n\nRelax, right now, and rest\n\n~Tilopa\n\nThree Statements\n\nThe Three Statements That Strike the Essential Points\n\nby Garab Dorje\n\n1. One is introduced directly to one's own nature.\n\n2. One definitively decides upon this unique state.\n\n3. One continues directly with confidence in liberation.\n\nA Short Commentary on the\n\nThree Statements of Garab Dorje\n\nby H. H. Dudjom Rinpoche\n\nI.As for the direct introduction to one's own nature: This fresh im-\n\nmediate awareness of the present moment, transcending all thoughts\n\nrelated to the three times, is itself that primordial awareness or knowl-\n\nedge (ye-shes) that is self-originated intrinsic Awareness {rig-pa). This\n\nis the direct introduction to one's own nature.\n\nII. As for deciding definitively upon this unique state: Whatever phe-\n\nnomena of Samsara and Nirvana may manifest, all of them represent\n\nthe play of the creative energy or potentiality of one's own immedi-\n\nate intrinsic Awareness (rig-pa i rtsal). Since there is nothing that goes\n\nbeyond just this, one should continue in the state of this singular and\n\nunique Awareness. Therefore, one must definitively decide upon this\n\nunique state for oneself and know that there exists nothing other than\n\nthis.\n\nIII. As for directly continuing with confidence in liberation: What-\n\never gross or subtle thoughts may arise, by merely recognizing their\n\nnature, they arise and (self-)liberate simultaneously in the vast\n\nexpanse of the Dharmakaya, where Emptiness and Awareness (are\n\ninseparable). Therefore, one should continue directly with confidence\n\nin their liberation.\n\nTranslated by Vajranatha\n\nBaudhnath, Nepal 1978\n\nSource: \"The Golden Letters\" by John Myrdhin Reynolds pp. 39-41\n\nTreasures\n\nThe Internet is forever redeemed by bringing to the world blessings such as these. Now is the time for Dzogchen. See eye-to-eye with Longchenpa.\n\nThe Precious Treasury of the Basic Space of Phenomena\n\nand\n\nA Treasure Trove of Scriptural Transmission\n\nA Treasure Trove of Scriptural Transmission by Longchenpa contains what we need to hear, and represents what we timelessly are, as well as words are able. To read this is to understand you and me.� There are no words to adequately express how much I cherish the words in this book, how grateful I am they were written, how fortunate, how blessed, I am to have these words available to me. This is a true treasure trove, a largely hidden treasure, a terma, that has remained largely hidden for centuries, to be found and read and celebrated with joy. Please download, print out, read, and share with everyone who is ready to receive this timeless treasure.\n\nBeyond words, beyond concepts, the secret is wide open, hiding in plain sight:� naked awareness; naturally occurring timeless awareness; the pure, luminous intelligence of the dharmakaya.\n\nThe essence of dharmakaya is naturally occurring timeless awareness.\n\nIts display is the reservoir of omniscient timeless awareness,\n\nabiding as the single sphere of being within primordial basic space.\n\nfrom A Treasure Trove of Scriptural Transmission by Longchenpa\n\nAll That Is Left When Everything is Fluxed\n\nThis current apocalyptic pandemic has put naked awareness to the test. Everything is always in flux, and lately the flux has become very fluxy, to the point where it is tempting to say that we are all fluxed.\n\nSo I walk down the sidewalk, grateful that I am a sentient being aware of sentience, a self-aware being aware of awareness, saved by Samantabhadra. Wherever there is naked awareness, there am I, naked Samantabhadra, naked awareness.\n\nMay all beings be happy.\n\nChecklist\n\nAs I leave the house, I find myself singing a checklist, refining and distilling it. Lately it runs like this:\n\nHad enough sleep.\n\nHad enough dreams.\n\nWoke up breathing,\n\nto another day\n\nto give and receive love with sentient beings\n\nto see and be seen\n\nto hear and be heard\n\nto touch and be touched\n\nto know and be known\n\nI can still read, and write, and think,\n\nand understand, and recognize, and realize,\n\nthe Great Perfection.\n\nNaturally occurring timeless awareness,\n\nnaturally occurring spontaneous presence.\n\nNaming the Unnameable\n\nThe coming up with a good name for something unnameable is difficult, yet because it is difficult, and because the nameless is so lovely, so meaningful, I continue to play with different names for the unnameable.\n\nThe name that sticks at the moment is universal spirit. It is definitely universal, and it is definitely an eternal energy, and to make it less of a physical force subject to scientific reductionism and more of an essential, primordial, indefinable force that is the animating principle of everything, I want to call it spirit.\n\nTherefore universal spirit it is, for now.\n\nThe fact that the existential experiment I run every time I go for a long walk that includes one of the town cemeteries yields the same results--recognizing and identifying as the universal spirit--I want to commemorate it by naming it, tentative and inadequate the naming may be.\n\nHow lovely, how meaningful, the universal spirit; how fortunate to have lived long enough in the same form to recognize it and be it.\n\nAwareness, Energy, Spirit\n\nAwareness is the ever-flowing ever-pure universal spirit. The same universal spirit is presence. While it seems to be possible to be frozen in time, fixated by conceptualizations, fears, and desires, the universal spirit continues to flow as awareness, as presence.\n\nForget everything and always start over, and over, and over again, as pristine presence and awareness, the ever-flowing universal spirit.\n\nThe Cusp of Nothingness and Somethingness\n\nWhile walking through the preserve and the new cemetery that are to the northeast, it was easy to realize how most of the time there is only nothingness, the state before conception. Then, ever so slowly and smoothly, there is somethingness, starting with mother's heartbeat and other sounds, and then light at the end of the birth canal. For many days since, there has been somethingness, day after day. Naturally arising awareness and naturally arising presence arising from nothingness into somethingness.\n\nThe somethingness is in itself something to behold, an astonishing experience, no matter how ordinary the circumstances.\n\nAs the days of somethingness are realized to be finite, it is only natural to want to spend them in the best possible way. It helps to recall nothingness, that somethingness comes from nothingness. Everyone is an ambassador of nothingness, representing nothingness in the midst of somethingness. Only nothingness can properly cherish somethingness. In nothingness we are all the same, a profound unity. In somethingness we may appear different, and occupy different points in space, but we are still nothingness, we are still the same profound unity. Naturally occurring presence is of the same nothingness, and naturally occurring awareness is of the same nothingness, wherever and however it arises.\n\nHere today, gone tomorrow; gone today, here tomorrow. Nothingness and somethingness is the same profound unity. It is a natural dream, this somethingness and nothingness.\n\nPure Energy, Pure Awareness, Pure Ocean\n\nFeeling surges of anger, I remember that anger, like all emotions and concepts, is transformed energy, modulated energy. The anger rises, and the anger subsides, in vast emptiness. Pure, unmodulated energy is pure awareness, naked awareness, naturally occurring timeless awareness. Thoughts arise, dance in emptiness for a while, and subside. The contents of awareness--thoughts, sensations, emotions--arise in emptiness, and subside. The contents of awareness distract, enthrall, ensnare, while pure awareness itself is silent, transparent, unnoticed, unappreciated. Pure awareness is the ocean, and the contents rising and falling in the ocean of awareness are waves, inseparable waves, of the ocean of pure awareness, the ocean of pure energy.\n\nSpending the Last Day Unseriously\n\nThe Shakers had a saying \"work as if this is your last day and as if you'll live a thousand years.\" The morning checklist that I sing as I leave the house for the workplace sets the mind-set when it includes, shortly after waking to yet another day, giving and receiving love with other sentient beings. Mortality is a natural and inevitable part of life. The only fearsome and regrettable aspect of mortality is how much time is wasted during this brief span in human form. The Two Commandments of the wise carpenter said it best. 1. Love the universe.� 2. Love each other. Loving the universe can be done in seclusion, alone, in nature, and loving the universe for manifesting as all sentient beings, including the sentient being called 'me.'� Loving each other is loving the universe in� 'other' forms, other sentient beings.\n\nI watched a campus administrator trudge across my path pulling a 2-wheeled cart filled with paperwork while peering intently into smartphone screen. This makes perfect sense in context. But if we were any other animal, or if we knew this could be our last day, would we take this context of hyperconceptualization seriously, at the expense of love for the universe and love for each other?\n\nWhat pithy folk wisdom:� Don't take life too seriously: you'll never get out if it alive. One way of loving the universe, and each other, is to take anything, and anyone, especially oneself, unseriously. The universe is eternally at play. Only self-enslaved mortal beings work with deadly seriousness.\n\nWhen I go upstairs to play with the wireless station or the piano the time is better spent loving and playing with the exiled upstairs cat, who thrives on attention. Loving the living is the best way to spend the day, especially the last day.\n\nBe Life\n\nFigures of speech can perpetuate delusions. One figure of speech is at the heart of the most toxic delusion of all:� \"I am alive. I have life.\"\n\nAll suffering comes from the concept of 'having life', life that one possesses, life that one will lose. This is the primal mistaken identity: life identifying with the form it has assumed. Fearing death, fearing others:� conceptualizing identity, death, and other.\n\nIt is not megalomania or self-aggrandizement to fully, deeply realize that one is life itself.\n\nAssuming every form, life never dies.\n\nLife recognizes itself in this human form. Life recognizes itself in every manifest form. Life plays with life in every form, in every state of mind. Life loves life in every form, in every state of mind.\n\nNaked awareness is life's awareness.\n\nSpontaneous presence is life's presence.\n\nLove Light\n\nA brisk walk to Westwood Cemetery helps with lucidity. The blood is circulating well in the brain, and the setting of mortality focuses the contemplation. By the time I'm leaving the cemetery, I am at maximum lucidity. While fully lucid, I recognize the living energy I call me, or my life, is nothing other than the universal energy which has assumed the mental and physical form called me. How wonderful, and liberating, to remember what I really, eternally, am. If only every sentient being could know what we really are there would be no fear, no suffering. Light in light, there is love the light has for itself, one light in many forms, one life in many forms, one energy in many forms. We love now, we will love again.\n\nMorning Checklist\n\nHad some sleep,\n\nhad some dreams.\n\nhave awakened to yet another day,\n\nnaked awareness, effortless presence,\n\ncan still give and receive love with other sentient beings,\n\ncan still talk,\n\ncan still walk,\n\ncan still see and hear and taste and smell and touch,\n\ncan still think, and read, and write,\n\ncan still sing,\n\nhad a good breakfast, good medicine, a good shit,\n\nhot shower, clean clothes,\n\ninsight,\n\nunderstanding,\n\nrecognizing,\n\nrealizing,\n\nthis\n\nis\n\njust\n\nso\n\nwords\n\nfail\n\nIs this a dream?\n\nWho is living as me,\n\nHanging now by a thread?\n\nClear Light Naked Awareness\n\nNaked awareness is Clear Light; Clear Light is naked awareness.\n\nAll this time, every sentient being immersed in Clear Light, bestowed with naked awareness.\n\nNOTA, NOA, NA, A; NOSP, NOP, NP, P\n\nNaturally occurring timeless awareness\n\nNaturally occurring spontaneous presence\n\nOr, even more concisely, NOA and NOP, taking away the adjectives:\n\nNaturally occurring awareness\n\nNaturally occurring presence\n\nGoing further, NA and NP:\n\nNatural awareness\n\nNatural presence\n\nFinally, A and P:\n\nAwareness\n\nPresence\n\nAppropriating Presence and Awareness\n\nThere are innumerable blatant examples of human life-forms besotted by delusion who have branded themselves as separate and superior, gods in their own imaginations. Rather than recognizing and realizing their awareness as nature's awareness, their presence as nature's presence, they call it their own, regarding themselves as� the independent, autonomous do-er, and taking all credit for what they do. Ego is nothing more, and nothing less, than the sense of \"I am.\" Egocentricity and egomania is the malignant delusion of \"it's all about me, it's all for me, I am all that matters.\" Pure awareness and pure presence have become appropriated, and misunderstood, and used as mere means to self-absorbed, self-contained, self-aggrandizing ends. Egocentric selfishness, taken to its extreme, becomes evil. When two or more such deluded human life-forms get together, evil becomes enabled.\n\nGetting Yoked\n\nAtiyoga is my yoga, I am a humble atiyoga yogi. An atiyogi. I like being yoked and unified with what I really, timelessly, am. Everybody must get yoked; actually, everyone is already totally yoked, but too attached and distracted, and too much into the contents of awareness rather than awareness itself. I prefer the company of animals and unpretentious people, and feel the agony of those trapped by their conceptions and contrivances and attachments. The atiyogi wants to help everyone recognize and resume awareness and presence and to be happy with that. Awareness, presence, love.\n\nLife on a Planet, While It Lasts\n\nThe cosmic conditions for life, and for sentient life, and for self-aware sentient life, and for self-realized self-aware sentient life, are so rare, and so fleeting. In between deaths and mass extinctions and before the ultimate planetary extinction, I put down words to share in this dream before everything disappears.\n\nWriting is folly. What good are words? What good can come from them?\n\nFar better than writing is to just be, and to just be with. I greet every sentient being, and in this timeless present share presence. To be present, to be presence, is the most important business at hand in this dream. The universe has become sentient as us, and while sentient the universe has the opportunity to briefly come to know itself to be, and to love itself in all its forms.\n\nReal Eyes, the Naked Awareness of Samantabhadra\n\nThe primordial cosmic buddha Samantabhadra takes it all in, and without fear or favor. These are the original eyes, our real eyes. Look no further than naked awareness.\n\nBeing Kind to Animals\n\nVeganism is not an affectation; it is an expression of the realization that all living things are equal, are one, and deserve respect. Plants deserve respect because they capture the Sun's energy and turn it into food for all animals. Human beings are animals, dependent upon plants and the interdependent relationship between plants and animals, and between animals. Every form of life has a role, a function, a place, that entitles it to live freely, fully, in peace. Predators and prey have their place, their roles. Nature's creativity is boundless as it experiments with forming and re-forming itself. Throughout this grand natural process there is spontaneous presence, and naturally occurring timeless awareness. Nature communicates with iself through the sentience of sentient beings. When we look upon nature with the eyes of nature, when we communicate with nature with the voice of nature, we express nature's ultimate kindness: recognition of everything as itself, everything being kindred. We are one flesh.\n\nSettlement\n\nTwo other terms in Longchenpa's sublime work A Treasure Trove of Scriptural Transmission that have much therapeutic power are:� naturally settled awareness, and naturally settled state. There are no words for how much these words mean to me. This harried, hurried, high-tech, high-maintenance human world, attached to experiences and possessions, can never have enough. It is possible, for anyone who is interested, to find completeness in naturally occurring timeless awareness and naturally occurring spontaneous presence. To simply be, to simply be naked awareness, is enough. Not much else is required--a little water, a little food, simple clothes, simple shelter. There is no need, and no desire, to be somewhere else or to have more. Naturally occurring timeless awareness is the supreme treasure. Being the single sphere of being within primordial basic space, this disheveled babbling ape is one happy lifeform.\n\nThe Prestige\n\nThis surely is an impressive display of emptiness.\n\nThis illusion appears very substantial.\n\nWatching everything appear, and disappear, is fascinating,\n\nas is watching the watcher, awareness of awareness.\n\nThis energy universe shines in every eye;\n\nthose forms of it who have disappeared, reappear.\n\nCenter of the Universe\n\nEvery point is the center of the universe. There is nowhere Samantabhadra is not. Carefree, easygoing, restful and relaxed, the completeness and perfection of the center of the universe is our natural state.\n\nFellowship of the Fur\n\nThe companionship of animals is therapeutic, as they are in the natural state. Human beings are animals, too, beings of flesh and fur. Every animal's sentience is of the same natural universal pure naked awareness. Just as it is possible to become aware of naked awareness, it's also possible to recognize awareness wherever it arises as the same naked awareness, in whatever animal it is found to be present.\n\nUniversal Language\n\nMusic has been called the universal language, as it transcends conceptual and cultural barriers. There is another universal language, and that is naked awareness. The recognizing of naked awareness as one's true nature includes recognizing naked awareness as everyone's true nature. Naked awareness recognizes naked awareness, wordlessly, silently, intimately. Listen together. See together. Be naked awareness together. Naked awareness provides interspecies communication as well as intraspecies communication. Naked awareness enables musicians to play together. Naked awareness is what makes all communication possible.\n\nThe essential communication is naked awareness in the presence of naked awareness, and the recognition of naked awareness held in common. At its essence, naked awareness itself is what is communicated, without content, without concept. Sitting together in silence is timeless, tried-and-true: naked awareness, spontaneous presence, shared.\n\nThe content to be communicated in naked awareness can be simple and basic. A drumbeat, a sound, reciprocated. Eye contact made. Touch felt, touch returned.\n\nFree Fall\n\nWhen I was a child, I was totally carefree, and the world was a magical place.\n\nAs an adolescent, I was at the mercy of ignorance, self-consciousness, social status, and hormones.\n\nAs an adult, I was careworn and world-weary, crushed by adult responsibilities.\n\nNow, as an elder, I am again carefree, and the world is once again a magical place.\n\nI am in free fall.\n\nI was always in free fall, but didn't realize it.\n\nI started free falling at the moment of conception.\n\nEmerging viable, and as a fairly intact representation of my species, I commenced to eat, shit, play, and sleep while free falling.\n\nLearning to survive, and clinging to existence, I wished to live forever, to go on and on in the ways to which I had become accustomed.\n\nNow it is all as a dream, free falling.\n\nThe ground is rising up to meet me, to embrace me once again.\n\nEarth reunites with earth; air reunites with air; fire reunites with fire; water reunites with water; space reunites with space.\n\nHow good it is to let go, to relax into the free fall.\n\nNaturally occurring timeless awareness and\n\nnaturally occurring spontaneous presence gently support me as I fall into myself.\n\nNothing Personal\n\nThe implication of naked awareness is universality: natural omnipresence, natural omniscience. Everything that was important to the personal life falls away. While there is a certain momentum of habitual activities related to taking care of the business of the day, there is nothing left to fear or to desire. The personal life is recognized as universal life itself. It is nature, it is the universe, enjoying life in human form for a while. This naturally occurring timeless awareness and naturally occurring spontaneous presence has consumed the person, so that only impersonal nature, impersonal universe, remains in human form until the human bodymind form is inevitably consumed by nature, by the universe. There is seamless transference from personal to impersonal, from the particular to the universal. With recognition of omnipresence and omniscience, there is the realization that no person was ever born, and no person will ever die, there being no person.\n\nIdentifying As Awareness\n\nWe usually identify with our opinions, our feelings, our memories, our thoughts. Our responses originate from our preconceptions, and from our preconceived idea of who we are. I know this because that is the way I have habitually identified myself for a long time. Now, at this fairly advanced age, I take great pleasure to identify with naturally occurring timeless awareness, which has no opinions, feelings, memories, or thoughts. It is a great natural gift I happily bear, and look to share the joy when it can be shared. How good it is that every sentient being has the same wonderful gift of naturally occurring timeless awareness; how poignant that so many sentient beings overlook this wonderful gift, being distracted by thoughts, sensations, and impulses.\n\nJarring Realization\n\nAs grateful as I am for Padmasambhava, Longchenpa, and all the Atiyoga/Dzogchen words ever written and spoken and lived, I am especially grateful for Samantabhadra, the Primordial Buddha, who is the universe itself. It is not necessary to hold onto any concepts or labels whatsoever. In the natural state, the primordial state, we simply abide. The universe in its ceaseless shapeshifting of energy simply, effortlessly abides in timelessness, and we, being the universe, can let go of all our grasping and simply resume our natural state, the state of the universe.\n\nEven now, this body, this mind, this awareness, is recognized as the universe. Even now, in this form, there is recognition of omnipresence. Even now, this form flows into all forms, and all forms flow into this form. The space in this jar remains after the jar breaks, being the immensity of space.\n\nAtiyoga\n\nDzogchen, the Great Perfection, the Great Completion, is also known as Atiyoga, the most extreme yoga. It is called extreme because there is nothing beyond it. It is the ultimate. It is very simple to practice and access, as it is primordial awareness, nonconceptual, and effortlessly present in every sentient being. Naturally arising awareness is the medium through which all communication happens, and it is also the ground of all being, of all phenomena, and of the deepest understanding. How common, how universal, how ubiquitous, how wonderful, how mysterious, how perfect, how sublime it is, naked awareness.\n\nThe universe recognizes itself.\n\nBeings of Light\n\nAll phenomena rise and fall in awareness, in space, in emptiness. All phenomena are waves of universal energy, one energy, one light. All sentient beings are beings of universal energy, beings of light. All of what we are shines, disappears, reappears. We shine upon each other, light shining on light, interpenetrating, one light shape-shifting and shape-swapping. Light from distant suns falls upon us, becomes part of us, and passes through us.\n\nCosmic Cat\n\nIs the universe ever exhausted by its incessant shining and shape-shifting? Does it ever stop to rest? I ask the cat melted on my lap, and she answers with every fiber of her totally-relaxed, totally-at-rest being, a being who's never worked a day in her life and is never exhausted. Cats are perfect expressions of the universe. My whole stressed-filled life of striving and worrying has brought me to this universal, cat-like state, just in time.\n\nInto the Light\n\nHow easy to forget that everything, even the densest matter, is energy. This body, bones and all, is all energy, all light. That which is perceived, and that which perceives, is energy, is light. There is nothing fixed, nothing permanent, in this field of ever-changing energy. There is no ego, there is no person, there is just universal energy, luminous emptiness, lucid emptiness, forms of energy appearing and disappearing in emptiness.\n\nJust savoring the reality of being energy is wonderful. That there is no self, only the universal energy, is liberating in the extreme. Light shines on light. It takes light to see light.\n\nCircumscribed and Uncircumscribed\n\nLiving a parochial, quotidian work life, a karma yogi, a householder yogi, business matters to attend are endless and ordinary. My footsteps fall on the same patches of earth and concrete.\n\nThis is as close to monastic life as possible without joining a cloister and getting tonsured. I have, however, gotten circumscribed.\n\nBlooming where I'm planted, everything is now and forever uncircumscribed. The sky of naked awareness is my home, timeless, and infinitely spacious.\n\nFree Now, At Peace Now\n\nOccasionally, at funerals, someone will say \"he's free now\" or \"he's at peace,\" referring to the corpse's presumed state of suffering while it was alive. So before the body, the universal energy was free and at peace; after the body, the universal energy is once again free and at peace, just as it was before the body. What, then, happens to universal energy when it assumes the form of a sentient being that makes it unfree and not at peace for the duration of the occupation of the form?\n\nAnimals have their instincts, their drive to survive, their cellular imperatives to grow, eat, excrete, and reproduce. Aside from physical pain and discomforts, animals don't psychologically suffer. Human animals have it all:� physical pain and discomfort, and psychological suffering. How lucky can we get?\n\nThere is another, very fortunate step, that humans can take if they want to make sense of this human animal condition of pain and suffering:� be curious about what, exactly, is experiencing the pain and the suffering. Be curious about what is living this life in this form.\n\nUniversal energy, going by many aliases and essentially nameless, eternally free and eternally at peace, needs to recognize itself while in form and remember what it really, eternally is.\n\nThen we can prevent people from coming to our funeral and making foolish statements and assumptions about our lack of freedom and peace while we were in human animal form.\n\n\"Sure, he's free now, at peace now. And he was free and at peace while he was breathing. He knew then what he really always is.\"\n\nResting In Awareness, Resting As Awareness\n\nWorld-weary, I look for rest, for refuge now, not later; here, not somewhere else. I'm tired of fear, madness, toil, suffering. Where is refuge, where is rest, in the midst of this? What were my parents thinking, to start an innocent life and let him be subject to all the pain and sorrow and uncertainty and tragedy of morbid, mortal life?\n\nOnly now that I have fewer and fewer years left in this bodymind have I managed to start catching on to what and where the real refuge is found.\n\nNaked awareness.\n\nNaked awareness.\n\nOnce more, for emphasis:�� naked awareness.\n\nThe presence of awareness, the awareness of presence, the awareness of awareness. How many times have I been reading this, writing this, and savoring this?\n\nHow many years ago was it when, walking down the sidewalk in the middle of the campus--between Severance and Finney--edifices of science and religion--it first hit me like a wondrous ton of bricks that this pure awareness just is, just present, effortless, pure, perfect, complete, utterly cosmic and utterly natural and utterly real?\n\nThis is my true home, this is my true self, for me, for everyone.\n\nHow wonderful, how beautiful.\n\nI'm speechless.\n\nIt's quite beyond words and concepts.\n\nAnd here I am writing shamelessly on and on about this beautiful, wonderful, universal, natural, effortless awareness.\n\nTransmitting the Essence of Mind\n\nThe essence of mind, self-arising natural awareness, is pristine, timeless, the mind of enlightenment. Transparent, perfect, infinitely equal and even, it is beyond thought and word, indestructible. Yet how easily it can be overlooked, and filled with blinding toxic clouds of conceptualization and emotion. Of all the things I call possessions, the one I cherish above all others is naturally arising pure timeless awareness. It is this, the essence of mind, I wish to take with me wherever I go. Of all the things that I would give to another, it's the essence of mind, which everyone already has. Transmitting the essence of mind only requires that the transmitter be in good working order, free from distortions of the signal. The essence of mind, when left alone in its pure, unmodified, unmodulated, undistorted natural state, transmits its pure energy. The transmitted pure essence of mind resonates in the receiver's pure essence of mind. This is the basis of trust and love, of self-liberation and self-realization.\n\nThe essence of mind is beyond duality and nonduality.\n\nThe suffering of ignorance, delusion, distraction--seemingly losing our (essence of) mind--and the eventual rediscovering of essence of mind--makes the rediscovering surpassingly sweet. We have to go out of our right mind to fully appreciate our right mind. Our right mind is the essence of mind, naturally arising timeless awareness.\n\nWhose Mind Is Blown?\n\nHow many times have the words, \"It blew my mind\" been uttered? For me, it's been innumerable times. How many times can a mind be blown before it completely disintegrates?\n\nThe roller coaster and sense of personal apocalypse has come, and has gone. The oft-blown mind is still here, still on deck, still operating, still sound.\n\nBeing duly cautious has paid off.�����������\n\nThe mind I had for so long been fearful of losing is more resilent, robust, and adaptable than I could have imagined.\n\nThis indestructible mind is not \"my\" mind after all.\n\nIt's the mind of nature.\n\nThere's no me, and nothing is mine.\n\nIt's all nature, and all belongs to nature.\n\nNature's mind can't be blown.\n\nEvery mind is nature's mind.\n\nEverything is reabsorbed in nature's vast body.\n\nNaturally arising timeless awareness is nature arising, nature's awareness.\n\nSelf-named, self-identified, identified with thought forms and physical form, nature in human form is a ludicrous, death-fearing animal with a very blowable mind.\n\nBy getting the mind blown, by going out of one's mind, one may make the most mind-blowing realization humanly possible.\n\nNature, meet nature.\n\nWelcome to the natural state.\n\nTimeless, Selfless\n\n����������� It's enervating and stultifying to believe one is living in a particular time, a particular calendar day/month/year/century/epoch, and to believe one is one's memories/thoughts/beliefs/body/name/occupation/title/socioeconomic status.\n\n����������� It's liberating and empowering to realize this very space, this very presence awareness, is timeless and universal.\n\nBasic Space is the Place to Be\n\nRe-learning how to sit up straight, relaxed, alert, aware, the basic space in which I sit is the same basic space since time immemorial. Basic space and awareness are timeless, and naturally present. Sit comfortably in basic space; stand comfortably in basic space; walk comfortably in basic space; be comfortably in basic space. Speak from basic space; speak as basic space; live from basic space; live as basic space. This presence in basic space is timeless.\n\nBeing Nature\n\nThe evenness of the basic space of phenomena is lost on those in the thrall of fear and desire. Naturally occurring timeless awareness is unknown to the beings enslaved by thoughts, ensnared by attachments. Whatever neuroscience discovers about the nature and origin of consciousness, it's still necessary to overcome fear and desire in order to realize naturally occurring timeless awareness and naturally occurring timeless presence. Sentient beings are distracted by the contents of awareness and overlook pure natural awareness itself.\n\nHow good it is to have companion animals, mercifully free of striving and contriving, of judging and conceptualizing. I provide them with water, food, shelter, care, attention, and affection. In return they provide me with their pure spirit, pure awareness, and pure presence. We are equals in the Great Evenness. Together we are just being natural, just natural beings, beings of nature being nature.\n\nThe Essence of Joy\n\nRealization is realizing there is no \"do-er.\" No-one is there to take credit, or to enjoy the fruits of what is done. No do-er, no enjoyer, no experiencer. Things get done, there is enjoyment, there are experiences, but there is no-one, no person. There is something, but not someone, behind everything. Call it universal energy. These animal bodies are temporary containers of universal energy, which is timeless and uncontained. There comes a time, when conditions are ripe, for realization, i.e., the universal energy at last recognizes and realizes itself. To universal energy, birth and death are the same. Uncontained before birth, uncontained after death, uncontained regardless of what the container animal may believe, to live as universal energy is to live authentically, as the inmost nature. There is wild joy with this realization, although universal energy doesn't feel joy--it's the essence of joy.\n\nEnduring\n\nA very wise and kind person said \"He who endures to the end will be saved.\" To endure the madness of the world, to endure the madness of the mind, is not easy, especially when there is no hope seen or foreseen for salvation. The savior is not a god-like humanoid, though--it's much closer to home, much humbler. To directly experience, to directly realize, naturally arising timeless awareness, naturally arising presence, naturally present basic space, is salvation. When the conceptual mind and false identity are in abeyance, the realization of pure awareness and pure presence and basic space is possible. When salvation is known to be real, at hand, our true nature, there is no more doubt, and the madness can be allowed to rise and fall on its own in basic space. How many suicides could be prevented if only those on the brink could only get a glimpse of the salvation of the natural state. Spontaneous, effortless, relaxed:� pure awareness, pure presence--the end of suffering, salvation.\n\nThat same wise and kind person assured his devoted friends that the yoke was easy, and the burden light. Salvation is to live spontaneously, effortlessly, in the present, living in, and as, the unfathomable source of all phenomena. No longer a slave of fear or desire or attachment to anything, to relax into the basic space of phenomena, without worry, in no hurry, the letting go of the false self takes the place of suicide. The natural state is salvation.\n\nAdvocating Basic Space\n\nLongchenpa was one of the earliest, and most eloquent, advocates for basic space; he was able to find the best possible words for that which is beyond words. It's not easy to be an advocate for something overlooked by almost everyone--space, misconstrued as nothingness. Reading his words without having had the direct experience of naturally occurring timeless awareness and basic space leads to confusion and frustration:� why does he go on and on about nothing, literally nothing? Reading his words after having such direct experience, it is like drinking cold clear pure spring water after suffering from prolonged thirst.\n\nWatch This Space\n\nMany years ago in the city, at last living on my own, I sat in the spacious reading room of the downtown public library. I gravitated toward the books on Buddhism, and picked out Ashvaghosha's \"Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana\". Although it was a difficult read for me, I was deeply impressed with the references to the 'essence of mind' and all its excellence. Now, almost half a century later, I recall that experience as being a pivotal moment. The silent, spacious, reading room was the perfect place to read about, and contemplate, the essence of mind.\n\nThe essence of mind:� spacious, clear, wide-open. Now, re-reading \"A Treasure Trove of Scriptural Transmission\" by Longchenpa, I feel like I've come full circle. That Longchenpa would emphasize space in the core work \"The Precious Treasury of the Basic Space of Phenomena\" is now understandable.\n\nLiving, moving, having being, in basic space of phenomena, is lovely. Space, nonconceptual space, no labels, no doctrines, no beliefs, no right, no wrong, no sentient being, no buddha�and to commemorate space, I note the increasing space in my clothing, as it becomes looser and more comfortable the longer I remain unattached to tasty edible phenomena in space. To be loose, relaxed, at home, comfortable in these clothes, this skin, this mind, is just right. Now I'm learning to move freely through space, enjoy space, savor space, celebrate space, be complete in space--what a way to finish a lifetime that was altogether too cramped and rushed until now.\n\nWe need space. Not just personal space or room in our trousers or our house or yard, but space of mind. Lo and behold, we have all the space we could possibly need, or want. Pure awareness--the essence of mind--is spacious, vast, clear, free, wide open. We can live in this space if we want. It's ours, it's our birthright.\n\nRather than infatuation with the rising and falling contents of awareness, there is the option to live in awareness itself, naturally occurring timeless awareness.\n\nThere's always plenty of space for everyone, and everything.\n\nInfluencer\n\nIt's currently popular to be an online 'influencer'--but what is really needed is to be an offline influencer. If there are qualities lacking in persons or a culture, embody those qualities. It's easy to decry others' weaknesses, not so easy to embody strengths. I may loathe pretentiousness, so instead of feeling contempt for pretentious persons I will endeavor to be unpretentious.\n\nOnly Natural\n\nNo matter how difficult things get, there's nothing that can take away the truth of being nature itself, life itself. There are no individuals, although nature has individuated forms. That which lives in every individuated form is life itself, nature itself. Life recognizes life, life communicates with life, life communes with life, life loves life. Nature recognizes itself, communicates with itself, communes with itself, loves itself. Pure awareness--the field of communication, the field of presence--embraces and reunites all individuated forms.\n\nTo experience the totality of presence and awareness of nature, in nature, as nature, is to experience completeness. It does take some time to get over earthshaking astonishment and uncontrollable laughter. This is breaking the nature-recognizing-itself barrier. Eventually it's just nature being nature.\n\nPreparing\n\nIt is a relief to find the source of security and sanity in the universe to be naturally occurring timeless awareness--naked awareness. It is the dharmakaya's own awareness. This temporary human form is in the midst of the dharmakaya. Naked awareness looks lovingly upon this, and every mortal form within itself, with dispassionate compassion, with the single universal eye of naked awareness.\n\nThe totality of this and every mortal life is witnessed by the dharmakaya through its own naturally occurring timeless naked awareness.\n\nIt takes a certain special subtle preparation to directly experience naked awareness. The time-tested method to realize naked awareness is simple:� the cessation of desire, the cessation of fear, the cessation of hate, the cessation of alienation, the cessation of dualistic thinking, the cessation of conditional thinking, the cessation of attachments, the cessation of attachment to thoughts, the cessation of thoughts. Upon cessation of these, there begins the direct experience of naked awareness by naked awareness; there begins unconditional love, security, sanity, completeness, the wholeness of the birthless, deathless dharmakaya.\n\nGetting Here Now\n\nI catch myself walking fast to get There, and then remember that the There where I want to be is Here. So I slacken the pace and savor being Here, i.e., Being. Standing, walking, sitting, lying--this is it. This is pure being itself, pure presence. This is naked awareness, pure awareness itself. This is what I've been after, and it's always right here, always right now. It doesn't get any better than this. It doesn't get any better than Here. The craving for getting There and Then fuels the craving for money, energy, and contrivances.\n\nSubtle, Obvious Simplicity\n\nWe are not the body, not the mind. We are that which always is. We are prior to the human form, prior to the Sun, planets, and stars. The days of this human form are numbered; the human form lives and dies in timelessness. We are timeless lucid space, luminous emptiness. This very presence, this very awareness, is prior to the universe.\n\nWhen the bodymind remembers what it really, timelessly is, it dances and sings all the way to the grave.\n\nThe Hell of Forgetting\n\nA close relative called to describe her current situation. Everything she ever had has been lost:� career, house, health, income, credit rating, enjoyment of life, and the will to live, Her body and brain give her neither peace nor comfort, only pain, disability, and fatigue. She has attempted suicide several times. Despite taking numerous prescriptions and being under the care of specialists and psychiatrists, she remains miserable, only wanting an end to it all, even if it requires suicide. I could only listen and ask questions to clarify her statements. After an hour or so I had to hang up and attend to prior commitments. That night I did not sleep well, or for very long. Hearing from a relative stuck in a hellish condition was difficult. It reminded me how real hell can be to those who are suffering, as she obviously is.\n\nI could not bring myself to tell her, unsolicited, that she was attached to the past, attached to external conditions, and attached to an image of herself that depended on external conditions. I could not tell her that death comes to everyone and everything, that changes can't be stopped. I couldn't tell her to live in the moment, to be content to just be, to self-liberate through seeing with naked awareness.\n\nWhat do I know that could survive a total reversal of fortune? It hasn't been put to an extreme test yet. Someday it will--when loved ones die, when money runs out, when health, strength, and mind deterioriate. The test will come. Will I remember the most important thing? Will I still be able to self-liberate through seeing with naked awareness, come what may?\n\nIt is crucial to have compassion for all suffering sentient beings, for all attached beings, for all beings who have yet to remember who they really, timelessly, are; suffering and fear of death come from such forgetting. I can remember, and I can be self-liberated. By remembering, by being self-liberated, I can pass along what can be passed along--to be what we really are--before passing on. It is entirely appropriate to dance and sing on the way to the grave. How we are, in the midst of changes and losses, can only help others who have forgotten what they timelessly are.\n\nLiving a happy righteous Buddhist life is in itself a skillful means of saving all sentient beings, even though in truth there are no sentient beings to be saved.\n\nCommunication and Communion\n\nCommunication, an ordinary miracle, is the exchange of messages between or among sentient beings who generally regard others as separate beings. Communication is mostly dualistic.\n\nCommunion, a not-so-common miracle, is exchanging with the other recognition of the other as oneself. Communion is nondualistic.\n\nCommunication often uses symbols, words, concepts; communion is nonverbal, using body language, sight, touch, and sound--the sound being not what's said, but how it's said, the tone of the voice, the intent.\n\nCommunication is conceptual; communion is nonconceptual.\n\nThe workplace is an opportunity to not just communicate, but to also commune, to cherish the other as oneself and to make such recognition the higher, deeper subtext of quotidian communicating.\n\nA very sweet person in India said it succinctly:� Do everything you do with love.\n\nRemember to commune while you're communicating.\n\nSo-called bosses can give us every reason to feel hostile and resentful. So-called enemies and adversaries and unlovable people, some in high places, can drive us to seething madness by their words and actions. My imaginary communications with my imaginary adversaries are unkind in the extreme. And yet:\n\nIn their presence I am forsworn to love them, and to be kind, and to commune with the part of the person, the real part, which I recognize as myself, and overlook the false part which so easily fuels a dualistic perspective.\n\nA very wise person said, Love your enemies.\n\nIt's easy to commune with trusting animals. The exchange of eye contact and body heat and touch and joyful noises, shares the one life.\n\nIt's more of a challenge communing with some human animals, who are enslaved by conceptualization and conditioning, imprisoned by thought and preconception. Yet commune we must, with everyone, disregarding no-one.\n\nIt's easy to communicate with cruelty, not so easy to return cruelty with kindness.\n\nIt's easier to be kind when we recognize the other as closer than kin. Communion is implicitly kind.\n\nThe universal spirit comes in every disguise, and lives to commune with itself.\n\nCharnel Knowledge\n\nThe fear of death comes from the ego, which wants to continue its individualized existence, to continue having its name, its role, its identity, its pleasures, and its possessions, Death brings all of that to a halt, which is unacceptable to the ego. To forestall death, for the non-theist there is life-extension, cryonics, caloric restriction, transhumanist uploading of the mind to a computer; for the theist there is eternal life in heaven in a glorified body, reuniting with family, friends, loved ones, Jesus, angels, and God Himself.\n\nNot having access to a bona fide charnel house or charnel grounds where I could meditate amidst rotting corpses, the closest place to gain inspiration and perspective from death is in one of the local cemeteries. As luck would have it, I live where I can go for a good walk looping either around a cemetery northeast of my house, or southwest. They both form a loop as a terminus. My favorite cemetery is the oldest one, in town, its massive trees having long incorporated the sustenance provided by interred townsfolk.\n\nWalking two miles to the southwest, reaching the furthest point in the loop and walking back homeward, by the time I reach the cemetery entrance I have regained all necessary insight, inspiration, and perspective, realizing again as if for the first time what it is that makes me alive, what makes me me, and get reminded yet again what's really worthwhile and essential, what's worth living for.\n\nSo simple, so beautiful, this universal spirit, this living energy. How to be?� Just be this.\n\nAnyone who would come back from the dead would be grateful to just be, to have another opportunity to love life and love everything that lives.\n\nWalking through a graveyard is a way to come back from the dead, and appreciate the life force, the universal energy that has assumed forms, forms of being and awareness.\n\nDivinity School\n\nWhile walking to work this morning, counting blessings, I wondered what it would take to ease the dire circumstances of sentient life on this planet, circumstances largely self-inflicted. It gets down to the problem of people being ignorant of what they really are--the universe, the Great Completeness, the Great Wholeness. Living with a mistaken identity is nothing but suffering:� filled with fears, desires, attachments, delusions. The way of life that is conducive to realizing our true nature is also the way of life that follows such realization: a way of life characterized by nonattachment, desirelessness, fearlessness, insight, the life of the contemplative.\n\nThis planet is a divinity school.� We learn hard lessons, one after another, until we realize divinity.\n\nNaturally Occurring Awareness, Naturally Occurring Love\n\nSome translations of Longchenpa's words use the recurring phrase \"naturally occurring timeless awareness\" for rigpa, which is just fine. I would also be fine with \"naturally occurring primordial awareness\" or \"naturally occurring primal awareness\" or just \"naturally occurring awareness.\" Whatever it's called, it remains as it is.\n\nNaturally occurring awareness is the panacea for human beings. Even in the midst of mass delusion, especially in the midst of mass delusion, naturally occurring awareness is self-liberating, self-healing, self-realizing. Everyone has it; everyone is it.\n\nHow about \"naturally occurring cosmic awareness\" or \"naturally occurring universal awareness\"?\n\nWhatever it's called, it's naturally wonderful, real, and true.\n\nAnd communing with naturally occurring awareness in whatever form it takes--young, old, human, nonhuman--is wonderful. Another name for such communing is \"love.\"\n\nTotaled\n\nThe totality of the spontaneity of the universe is within and without. The ever-changing forms appear in the ever-unchanging formlessness. Walking about in this, with this, as this, be totally totaled.\n\nGlory Glory Halleluia\n\nThe first glory is the dance of energy in emptiness.\n\nThe second glory is naturally occurring timeless awareness.\n\nThese two glories are aspects of the same glory.\n\nGlory be.\n\nCage-Free\n\nI've been trapped in a conceptual cage for much of my adult life. The concepts accumulated to the point where I could not go on, existence having become a dreary burden. How was I to know that thoughts can blind and sicken?\n\nNow there is no cage. Once in a while walls and bars start to go up, and then vanish.\n\nSamantabhadra is cage-free.\n\nThe dharmakaya is cage-free.\n\nBuddha-nature is cage-free.\n\nPure, naturally occurring, naked awareness is cage-free.\n\nBe cage-free.\n\nThe best thing we can do for suffering sentient beings is, out of wisdom, compassion, and equanimity, to be cage-free and share cage-freedom.\n\nUltimate Guilty Pleasure\n\nReading Great Perfection and other sublime texts has become a guilty pleasure lately. As conditions continue changing it's good to have the actual source at hand, and to appreciate the fact that it's always at hand for every sentient being: naturally occurring timeless awareness, naturally occurring timeless presence. Realizing this is the universe's awareness and universe's presence there is no fear, no desire, no separation, no death, no birth. It's the ultimate guilty pleasure, even though resting in the source as the source is beyond guilt and pleasure.\n\nFilters and Cages and Primal Awareness\n\nPrimal awareness is like gravity and electromagnetic waves, an inherent elemental force of the universe. Self-arising, wherever it is, it is the same primal awareness. Wherever it arises, there we are. What we are, in essence, is primal awareness, the source's awareness.\n\nThe misinformation and misunderstandings and misperceptions we convey in ignorance go on to obscure primal awareness, to serve as a conceptual cage to primal awareness. Thus primal awareness, and ignorance, go on.\n\nNOTA Bene\n\nA recurring reference by Longchenpa in A Treasure Trove of Scriptural Transmission is to \"Naturally Occurring Timeless Awareness.\" This is as good of a description as any I have seen anywhere of the ineffable reality of true nature. Why oh why do I try to eff the ineffable? When I try to talk about NOTA words fail, and I stammer, apologize, and fall silent. So be it: deeds mean more than words; the heart's true intentions are impossible to conceal; nonverbal expression says far more far better than verbal expression. Sharing NOTA is as good as it gets.\n\nCrystal Ball\n\nThe appearance of phenomena in pure awareness is like the appearance of light and images in a crystal ball. Everything is just an appearance, an image, a natural illusion with no substance, a dance of energy in emptiness.\n\nNatural Illusion\n\nThe total spontaneous experience is of nature, experienced by nature. It's nature witnessing nature, the universe witnessing the universe, emptiness witnessing this display in emptiness. The witness is natural, spontaneously arising, self-originating, self-sustaining presence awareness, formless, transparent, timeless, and universal. This constant magical illusion is perfectly natural, naturally perfect.\n\nContemplating Egocide\n\nSpringtime energizes lifeforms. Human lifeforms, when energized, also have their destructive dualistic conceptualizations energized. The mind, hard to tame, is even harder to tame in spring.\n\nI rededicate myself to the contemplative life, eschewing materialism whenever possible, living the simplest, smallest-footprint, lowest-impact life possible, content with primal presence and primal awareness. I live to see another day, and live for today, for as long as I keep surviving to see another day. This bodily form is temporary, as is this conditioned mind, as is this current situation.\n\nContemplating the inevitability of death, I let the ego expire on its own, unreal bundle of concepts that it is, and realize that I have been around forever prior to this bodily form, and� will be around forever after this bodily form has disappeared. That which lives as \"me\" in this bodily form is timeless.\n\nContemplation is the life. Contemplation is life itself.\n\nLet it go, all will be lost anyway. Live for the day, live for the moment. Contemplate nature's awareness, which is \"my\" awareness. Contemplate nature's presence, which is \"my\" presence. Contemplate nature, which is \"me.\"\n\nBejeweled\n\nVoices, memories, echoes, half-remembered images and events�the noisy karma of legions of influences rise as reliably as the Sun. It's been a while since a 5.5 lb. neonate emerged from a psychic mud puddle, and continues to live in a variety of mud puddles. And a lotus blooms in the mud. And a jewel is found in the lotus.\n\nHow simple, how obvious, how common, how reliable:� self-arising self-sustaining primal presence and primal awareness, transparent, brilliant, immaculate, perfect--for every sentient being to reclaim.\n\nWitness for the Mind\n\nIt is essential to believe in nothing, to be nothing, in order to fully experience the mind, the totality of experience. By being nothing, we witness everything, without attachment, without delusion. We witness attachments without attachment, we witness delusions without delusion. We become nature's witnessing, the universe's witnessing, the natural witness, the universal witness. We at last realize we are pure awareness. We recognize pure awareness in every sentient being.\n\nNatural Mind Meets Natural Mind\n\nThe natural mind--pure awareness--is coexistent with all sentient life. It is the natural mind that recognizes itself, arising spontaneously as pure intrinsic awareness. The totality of the experience of being is witnessed by the natural mind. The natural mind is one and the same wherever it arises. Pure awareness is always pure awareness.\n\nWhen attachment to the contents of pure awareness comes to an end, pure awareness remains and is recognized by pure awareness. We live on as pure awareness wherever it arises.\n\nSatisfying Mind with Mind\n\nThe direct experience of presence-awareness, of mind experiencing mind, of pure awareness, is like being immersed in a magical world.\n\nThe experience of the totality of brain consciousness--senses, memories, fantasies, images, thoughts, emotions--is astonishing.\n\nHow the brain processes sensory impulses and creates sights and sounds and feelings projected in emptiness, ever-changing holograms dancing in emptiness, is amazing to behold.\n\nAnd behold the beholder, luminous emptiness, intelligent energy--what a fascinating show.\n\nSuch contemplation satisfies the mind, the mind lacks nothing.\n\nSatisfied minds want nothing, need nothing.\n\nA little water, a little food, simple clothing, simple shelter, we can live an enlightened life for the rest of our days.\n\nWalk with the lightest footprint upon a planet struggling to satisfy the insatiable desires of selfish high-maintenance human beings looking for happiness in an imagined outer world.\n\nEven the outer world is in the mind.\n\nHappiness is in the mind, everything is in the mind.\n\nWho needs glowing computer and video screens when the mind is so luminous, a display of energy perceived by energy?\n\nDistracted sentient beings are kept ignorant by distraction.\n\nA satisfied mind, a contented mind, a peaceful mind, is all we really need.\n\nWe're it, and we overlook it.\n\nLook within. Look at mind. Look at what's looking.\n\nPresence-awareness is enough.\n\nMind is enough.\n\nBe nothing, and be everything.\n\nEmptiness is luminous and voluminous.\n\nPrimal Primate\n\nHow could a species of primate get to the point of recognizing primal presence and primal awareness? How many incarnations as so many species, to reach this moment of realization? Yet it's happening. Dzogchen apes, redolent with Rigpa.\n\nContemplating Contemplation\n\nThis is the era of distraction. The Anthropocene, the Information Age, has brought distraction to the saturation point. Fears, desires, attachments, and delusions are rampant. The signal-to-noise ratio of the current civilization is 1:1.\n\nThe cure for distraction is unplugging and just being. This starts as deliberate, willfull, stubborn, formal meditation, simply sitting quietly, taking stock of the noise of the mind, and recognizing, thus breaking the spell of, the noises in the head. Once the spell of noisy thoughts has been broken, the signals of the mind are recognized: sensory stimuli in pure awareness. Then the noise of the mind is recognized as just a different kind of signal of the mind. Signal and noise rise and fall in the pure primordial presence/awareness. Eventually meditation becomes portable, when it can be engaged while walking and working and taking care of the business of the day. When meditation becomes portable, it becomes contemplation.\n\nTo distracted people, presence/awareness is ordinary and obvious, taken for granted, devalued, unfulfilling, and used as means to other ends. To contemplatives, presence/awareness is momentous, fulfilling, wonderful, and mysterious, the Great Completeness here and now.\n\nNothing Lasts\n\nThe clear light contains all forms rising and falling. Formless mind is clear light, the essence of mind. Form is colorful light, as empty as clear light. Nothing lasts, the clear light lasts.\n\nMirror Neurons\n\nEvery word, every movement, every expression, every intention, vibrating forth from mirror neurons vibrates sympathetically in surrounding mirror neurons which in turn vibrate forth propagating the vibrations from mirror neurons. What vibrations go around, come around. The challenge is to recognize the mirror that is the natural mind, and not get attached to and confused by the reflections.\n\nThe Big Reveal\n\nThe last desire to go is the desire for desirelessness; the last attachment to be dropped is attachment to non-attachment. Boom, it's done--by whom, unknown, and not applicable. The universe shows its mercy to mortal individuals by revealing its presence in mortal individuals, thus ending mortality and individuality in one fell swoop. And just in time--too often so-called self-identified mortal individuals die or become demented before the Big Reveal.\n\nInheritances\n\nI have inherited much, just by the luck of birth. While material wealth has eluded me, the fairest flowers of civilizations are a given:� leisure time; access to all the knowledge of the world; healthy food; good medical care; clean air and clean water; indoor plumbing.\n\nI have also inherited neurosis, which after prolonged suffering has been cured by the nature's spontaneous presence and awareness as manifested through the human being.\n\nI want to bequeath the most wonderful thing to my survivors:� nature's spontaneous presence and awareness as manifested through the human being.\n\nSurprise! It's already here, present, and aware, as us.\n\nWe just need to be reminded of that fact.\n\nThe Mind of Nature\n\n1. One is introduced directly to the mind of nature.\n\n2. One definitively decides upon the mind of nature.\n\n3. One continues directly with confidence in liberation in the mind of nature.\n\nNature in all its glory,\n\nAlways and already present.\n\nPlanetary Visitor\n\nIt is wonderful to behold this planet and this planet's lifeforms and this planet's sky and this planet's sun. Amazing!\n\nThe universe has managed to complexify and see itself here, all these sentient beings in the process of awakening.\n\nFor Those Who Did Not Ask To Be Born\n\nNo-one asks to be born, and here we all are. What now? Whose script are we supposed to follow?\n\nThe first order of business is to relax, to just be. We are not property, we are not slaves. We can recognize the script that was foisted upon us, the script that we are blindly following. It is a script of fear and desire and attachment and delusion and mistaken identity and nonexistent separate self. It is a script guaranteed to produce self-enslavement and suffering.\n\nNow relaxed, we can be natural--we can dare to be nature.\n\nThis is nature's life, nature's expression.\n\nOur presence, our awareness, is nature's presence, nature's awareness.\n\nThe ocean of nature is covered with waves rising and falling. The rising waves are not born, the falling waves are not dying.\n\nSo here we are, rising and falling, wave, ocean, nature.\n\nWe live forever as luminous emptiness, as nature, as universe.\n\nAgency, Identity, Awareness\n\nWaking up in the wee hours, unable to get back to sleep, the mystery of agency and identity and awareness overwhelms the mind. How can anyone not be curious about where and what and how this presence, this awareness, came to be? It feels like it would be only natural to go stark, raving mad from the unshakable, unstoppable experience of presence and awareness. How could this possibly be spoken of?\n\nChanging the Mind\n\nWalking outdoors in the midst of nature heals the mind because it brings out the natural mind. Once we recognize the natural mind, the mind is self-liberated. The natural world includes the natural mind, which is pure awareness. The natural world spontaneously and effortlessly manifests in the natural mind, the great magical illusion of nature.\n\nBeing Nonjudgmental about Being Judgmental, Finding Perfection in Imperfection\n\nI cherish opportunities to be in complete seclusion, especially outdoors, in nature, out of earshot and out of eyeshot of any other human animal. Nonhuman animals are welcome--they are nonjudgmental, even though they see me and hear me and smell me so acutely. Nonhuman nature is nonjudgmental. When nature assumes human form, it becomes judgmental to some degree, having taken a sophisticated, dualistic perspective. As a recovering cynic, reflexively judgmental for decades, the human animal that is the main source of dualistic judgmental thinking is in this mind.\n\nIt is really nature, the sole agency, which is passing judgment upon itself when it is in human form--nature in disguise, hidden from itself, perceiving itself to be separate and unequal.\n\nIt has taken me a long time to become nonjudgmental about judgmentality. Thanks to the great Dzogchen teachings which point to the luminous empty clarity and perfection of the natural mind it is possible for me to accept imperfection. In the natural mind, there are no concepts of perfection and imperfection, good and bad, right and wrong; they rise and fall in the Great Perfection.\n\nNow I find perfect seclusion in the natural mind, pure awareness, primordial presence, whether alone or in the midst of thought-filled human beings. The thoughts and judgments that arise in pure awareness just rise and fall.\n\nEnergetic Emptiness\n\nOkay, after several decades of self-discovery and self-inquiry it is amazing to realize there is no self to discover, no self to inquire, no self to realize. There is not one cell in this body willing to claim to be \"me.\" This is where scientific reductionism shines:� even subatomic particles are made up of a whole lot of energetic emptiness. Nature is a wonderful fractal self-creation of energetic emptiness. If I must label myself as anything, it is nature:� energetic emptiness.\n\nIt is just nature.\n\nMake me one with nature, make me one with everything.\n\nDone.\n\nImpermanent Illusion\n\nThe visual image formed on the retina is a projection through the lens that is upside-down, which is then sent to the visual cortex of the brain via electrochemical impulses, where the impulses are assembled as a right-side-up image. The whole world is the brain's interpretation of the whole world. Phenomena appear in the mind out of nowhere, and disappear back to nowhere. This protracted experience called \"my life\" is an illusion that appeared out of nowhere and will disappear back to nowhere. The constant through this impermanent ever-changing illusion is presence, awareness, natural energy.\n\nAll sentient beings are naturally deluded, of mind conditioned for survival. The illusory interpretation of the world in the mind is both real and unreal, both correct and incorrect.\n\nThe only difference between a Buddha and a suffering sentient being is that a Buddha knows he is full of delusions, and a suffering sentient being is ignorant of that fact.\n\nNature-energy presence and awareness is the ground of all being, the source of illumination as well as of illusion.\n\nIllumination and illusion and all apparent dichotomies are all the same to the natural awareness.\n\nDewdrop Difficulties\n\nSpending decades, lifetimes, at the mercy of thoughts, harassed by duality and mortality, dying a thousand deaths, has prepared me for this moment.\n\nThe dewdrop slips into the ocean. Now the ocean, the dewdrop somehow yet remains for now.\n\nThe dewdrop has its dewdrop difficulties.\n\nIt used to be for so long, \"I'm suffering\". Yes, yes, the dewdrop suffers; the ocean, not at all.\n\nFusion\n\nAwareness of awareness creates an existential fusion reaction. The presence of presence, awareness of awareness, is overwhelming. Presence and awareness is natural, of nature. To be nature's presence, nature's awareness, is almost unbearable.\n\nSnuggling Into Eternity\n\nReading words ascribed to Milarepa, the relevant takeaway for a senior citizen who is not yet too senile to grasp it and take it away is the fact that Buddha is found nowhere else but in one's own true mind, specifically, the universal mind, also known as sheer awareness itself, the clear light of the dharmakaya. This vast dharmakaya is with everyone, all the time. Everything rises and falls in the dharmakaya. How good it is to snuggle into the dharmakaya now while still alive and relatively healthy, and to remain snuggled within it through everything, including biological death. Snuggling into the dharmakaya, after a while it is natural to identify with the dharmakaya, and then to surrender to the dharmakaya, and become consumed by the dharmakaya, thus becoming the deathless dharmakaya, which is also birthless.\n\nBeing Beyond Being\n\nAt this very moment all sentient beings throughout all inhabited worlds are experiencing painful existence in fragile, vulnerable, impermanent forms: birth, hunger, thirst, cold, heat, pain, illness, injury, aging, dying. More cerebral forms also experience psychological suffering:� fear, disillusion, disappointment, craving, attachment, confusion, delusion. At the very least I would not want to inflict any pain and suffering upon them; at the very most, I would want to save all sentient beings from the pain and suffering of life as a sentient being. As a sentient being I have found salvation in Buddha, and that Buddha has already and always been within me as me. The only Buddha that can save me is the Buddha that is my true self, my true mind, which is pure, undeluded, beyond concept of Buddha and sentient being; that same Buddha is what can save all suffering sentient beings. In fact there are no sentient beings to be saved--that is what saves all sentient beings. It's all Buddha, only Buddha, and Buddha deals just fine with pain and suffering, being beyond being.�\n\nDownscale Sustainability\n\nEverything is impermanent, yet there is a temporary permanence to be had through sustainable systems. The parts of the system may still be as impermanent as ever, but the system can go on longer than its individual parts. If the system is sustainable, it sustains; if it isn't, it doesn't. If too many human beings live an upscale, high-maintenance way of life that way of life becomes unsustainable; when human beings are content to live a downscale, low-maintenance way of life, that becomes sustainable. The planet can support species with minimal desires. Human beings need to learn how to be content with intrinsic nature: intrinsic natural presence, intrinsic natural awareness--recognition and realization of our intrinsic universal nature is sufficient.\n\nCosmic Evangelism\n\nThe best evangelists are those who understand and love that which they worship. Of all things in the universe, the best by far is the universe itself--universal presence, universal awareness. The attributes of the universe that are the most attractive are its spontaneity, effortlessness, relaxedness. The universe is complete, whole, in the eternal present. The universe assumes these lovely temporary forms; these lovely temporary forms also partake in the same lovely attributes of that which has assumed form--spontaneity, effortless, relaxedness--in the midst of life as well as afterwards. Every realized form of the universe evangelizes by pure presence and pure awareness, by simply being the universe--spontaneous, effortless, and completely relaxed.\n\nBrevity, Concision, Pithiness, Terseness, Cogency\n\nAs a pre-digital youth with sloppy, cramped, awkward handwriting, I used an old portable manual typewriter to compose words. It was a magical experience, seeing formless thoughts taking clear, legible, visible, even tangible, form, inked embossments on paper. This sheet of paper preserved fleeting thoughts, to be stored, or preserved, or copied, or shared.\n\nElectric typewriters and typing classes gave my fingers wings, and my words flowed faster and freer.\n\nThen word processors followed by personal microcomputers outpaced my thoughts. As quantity of words increased, reflection and concision decreased. Spelling, grammar and syntax errors multiplied, as did half-considered, half-baked thoughts.\n\nThe advent of Internet for All enabled me to at last share half-considered, half-baked thoughts with people near and far.\n\nNow I am going back to reading works written in pre-digital times and finding the most powerful thoughts are delivered using a few well-chosen, well-considered words. Words needed to be composed with care so that it would respect the typesetter's time and effort.\n\nSo now I have come full circle, using microcomputer and Internet, and making an effort to choose my words with care, respecting the time of the readers near and far by practicing brevity, concision, pithiness, terseness, and cogency, sharing thoughts that are as powerful as thoughts can be, toward recognizing that wonderful thing, present and aware, beyond thoughts, words, and concepts.\n\nCatching Dzogchen\n\nDzogchen, beyond words and concepts, \"can't be taught, but can be caught,\" like a wonderful contagious life-restoring condition. It is transmitted person-to-person, heart-to-heart, just by how we are. Samantabhadra is always here, in every sentient being, silently waiting to be recognized. Self-liberation through seeing with naked awareness doesn't just benefit one, it benefits all those around one. Words and concepts about Dzogchen are not Dzogchen itself. Yet language is miraculous, and it is good to stash away findable words here and there for the benefit of others. The word and concept \"Dzogchen\" is a pointer, a clue, a hint, a suggestion, of the most wonderful, universal reality for everyone. The Dzogchen way is for everyone, in every circumstance. By living in the Dzogchen way we spread this glorious contagion near and far.\n\nDying While Alive\n\nIntrinsic pure awareness; intrinsic pure presence; intrinsic pure presence-awareness:� the ultimate treasure is always here, always now, intrinsically, effortlessly, uncontrivedly. Universal being, universal awareness, is always here, always now. The real deal is beyond concepts, beyond words. This is so wonderful, to die into this while alive.\n\nA Butterfly's Praise of Effortless Presence\n\nHow lovely, how wonderful, is this primal Presence, this primal Awareness that effortlessly manifests. This is my true Presence, my true Awareness. Distractions kept me away from this for decades, but no longer. Distractions simply rise and fall now, appearing and disappearing, in the timeless field of Presence and Awareness.\n\nNo longer do I insatiably crawl about and devour like a hungry caterpillar. I have had my fill, have pupated long enough, and now find plenty of flowers filled with nectar as I fly with ease for the rest of my days on butterfly wings.\n\nWriting On Water\n\nThe Internet is not necessarily 'forever', and neither is print media. Stone tablets eventually break down into sand. All forms, all phenomena, are impermanent. Maybe that is the way to spread the message of impermanence, via the obvious impermanence of all form and phenomena, letting impermanence speak for itself, demonstrate itself, prove itself, confirm itself, teach itself.\n\nImpermanence reveals the permanence of primal awareness, primal presence, luminous emptiness, the union of wisdom and emptiness.\n\nLiving the Dzogchen way is like having total amnesia, short- and long-term amnesia. Forgetting everything, every moment is new, fresh, pristine, pure. There is no-one remembered, no-one remembering. All there is is primal self-arising awareness. This is amazing, dying to self and surrendering to primal presence, primal awareness.\n\nAlways Home\n\nI have a few attachments to physical hearth and home:� housemates, toys, treats, comfy chair, bed, bathroom, etc. Not being a recluse, and working for a living, I am away from the house much of the time. Whether indoors or outdoors, it is always here, always now, and I would be woefully ignorant if I still felt I needed to be somewhere else, or in the past or future, in order to feel complete. Right now, right here, I rest, complete, in pure awareness as pure awareness, in pure presence as pure presence.\n\nThe Sky of Pure Awareness\n\nAmateur astronomers want a clear dark sky to see celestial objects, but the atmosphere always presents some degree of opacity and distortion, and the electric lighting of modern civilization has brightened the night sky. There is another sky, available day or night, which is always perfectly clear, perfectly empty, and perfectly transparent, and that is the sky of pure awareness, filled with all phenomena, physical and mental, which are constantly appearing and disappearing like clouds in this planet's sky. The sky of the earth and the sky of pure awareness are recognized by their emptiness, their transparency, their spaciousness. To see pure awareness with pure awareness we only need to recognize passing phenomena and let them rise and fall in the luminous emptiness of pure awareness. All thoughts, all emotions, all memories, all fantasies--negative, positive and neutral--are allowed to rise and fall in pure awareness. Abiding in pure awareness is the inexhaustible source of peace. Our entire physical existence is witnessed throughout all its changes, and its dissolution, as just another phenomenon rising and falling in primal cosmic awareness.\n\nDzogchen and the Universe and our Birthlessright\n\nAll the austerities, all the self-indulgences, all the suffering, all the fundamental relentless transiency of all things, bring me now to the most essential thing:� Dzogchen, the Great Perfection, the Great Completeness. This is finally acknowledging, accepting, surrendering to original self, Buddha nature, and letting it be, letting it be it, letting it be me. Hence Tilopa exhorting us, finally, to relax, right now, and rest, in Buddha nature, as Buddha nature. Those of scientific bent can visualize this as partaking in the way the universe spends its time, suspended in the infinite eternal void--relaxed while spontaneously self-arising and self-transforming. Scientists, ever-curious, study the Universe; scientists can also accept the fact they are the Universe--the Universe studying itself. Resting in the Universe, as the Universe, is our birthright, or our birthlessright.\n\nPrimally Primed\n\nTwo prime concepts are primal awareness and primal presence. These words, these labels, these concepts, are right at the very edge of my whole so-called individual life, my whole understanding, my whole reason for being. While there are still many attachments, I am content to carry with me to the moment of death primal awareness and primal presence, and be merged with the universal primal awareness and universal primal presence. In this moment, mindful of primal awareness and primal presence, there is already merging, with every heartbeat, with every breath, with every step. I am in this particular form already indistinguishable from the universal primal awareness and primal presence, one and the same.\n\nMiraculous Awareness\n\nNaked awareness itself is miraculous. How obvious, yet how subtle--hiding in plain sight, beautiful natural awareness. Only by being profoundly distracted, deeply attached, can we possibly be able to overlook miraculous awareness.\n\nWild and free, coming and going:� this nameless thing of pure presence and pure awareness.\n\nDharmakaya\n\nThe source of all forms is the Dharmakaya, in which forms self-arise, and self-annihilate. Forms, physical forms and thought forms, all vanish as if they never happened, in the Dharmakaya. Anything goes, and everything goes, in the Dharmakaya. The Dharmakaya's awareness is a constant clear-light merciful delight. Let go and let Dharmakaya.\n\nHealing, Wholeness, Naked Awareness\n\nHarassed by thoughts for decades, exhausted by mental stress and insomnia, the cure has been with me all along:� pure naked awareness. Nonconceptual, nonjudgmental, transparent, natural--naked awareness is my true self, my true mind. In this I find refuge and rest, and will spend the rest of this incarnation sharing this, even though everyone already has naked awareness, everyone already is naked awareness, and everyone who can know this could know this, and find the same relief and refuge and healing that I am finding.\n\nMind, Awareness, Spirit, Samantabhadra\n\nIt takes a long time before mind is recognized as mind, and awareness recognized as awareness. Mind is conditional mind, conditioned mind, a structure of impermanent thought forms. No two minds are exactly the same. All minds cease upon biological death of the brain. Awareness arises spontaneously, is pristine, universal, arising from universal energy. Universal energy is birthless, deathless; awareness--universal mind--is birthless, deathless. Mind is a temporary manifestation in awareness; mind is a useful survival tool. Survival for survival's sake is a biological imperative. In the self-aware, self-reflecting realm, a realm which often includes plenty of leisure time--time to contemplate existence--survival for survival's sake is not fulfilling. We survive, we are aware of our existence, and sometimes we are aware of awareness itself. What we \"are\" in fact is awareness, so it is awareness that is aware of awareness.\n\nThe source of awareness is universal energy:� awareness is universal energy's awareness. \"Spirit\" is a less-cumbersome name for universal energy. Whatever it is called, it precedes and follows impermanent forms of itself, truly timeless, birthless, and deathless, the ocean of spirit and its waves. The all-seeing eye of awareness within every form and every mind is the eye of spirit.\n\nFulfillment, completeness, perfection:� some call it Dzogchen. Pure awareness: some call it rigpa. Padmasambhava calls the wonderful process \"Self-liberation through seeing with naked awareness.\" Samantabhadra, the primordial buddha, remains silent.\n\nImpermanence is a running inside joke; only Samantabhadra gets it.\n\nResting In, Resting As\n\nNaked, pristine awareness silently awaits. After all the feverish thoughts, and weeping and gnashing of teeth, we find pure awareness to be our source and refuge. The clear light of natural awareness heals us, restores us to sanity and peace. We are complete, resting in, resting as, ordinary universal awareness.\n\nBeing, in the Now\n\nAll we can \"do\" is be, in the now, this mysterious thing that just spontaneously, universally, is. No need to cling or crave or fear as we unfold, rise, fall in eternity.\n\nA Cosmic Sense of Humor\n\nThe totality of experience on this planet alone is filled with pain, pleasure, fear, grief, happiness, hate, contentment, ignorance, suffering, and delusion. We are, at this time, apparently on the brink of some kind of anthropogenic mass extinction, whether by environmental collapse, thermonuclear war, pandemic, etc. Yet this is part of the natural unfolding of this planet's intelligent life. I am learning to accept our planetary fate, and to even develop a cosmic sense of humor as part of a cosmic perspective. Having an aging body helps in this regard--there is nothing immortal or invincible about a body that's slowly, undeniably falling apart. I accept, and joke, about this body; I accept, and joke, about this planet also.\n\nA Cosmic Community of Equals\n\nEvery sentient being is an expression of the same universal energy. It is not necessary to fear or kill or devour any sentient being when we can find our sustenance in universal energy, as universal energy. Plants, embodied sunlight, sustain us and we sustain the plants with our bodies and our bodily waste. We are sentient embodied universal energy, here to love and serve and comfort each other, as equals.\n\nApex Contemplatives\n\nMy feline housemates are apex predators, having successfully taken over this planet with their cunning and charm.\n\nApex contemplatives take over their own bodyminds, overcoming their mental conditioning and living completely in the present, in essence taking over the present. Having realized the universal mind and universal energy, the apex contemplatives are immortal and invincible, no longer having a perishable self.\n\nIn An Existential Dream World\n\nWe are all in an existential dream world, appearing and disappearing within each other's mind, held within each other's memory. Mind and memory vanish upon biological death. The universal energy continues the process, starting fresh with each incarnation of itself.\n\nThe Reliable Relevance of the Astonishing\n\nJust to be aware of awareness, just to be aware of being, was astonishing when first realized, and continues to astonish. How can something so simple, so obvious, so commonplace, be so overlooked by so many for so long?\n\nAll worlds, personal and impersonal, rise and fall. Conditions remain stable, comfortable, and agreeable only fleetingly. Self-aware biological existence is absolutely fraught from womb to tomb.\n\nAnd yet this very self-awareness that produces so much agony and anxiety is the same self-awareness that produces astonishment when we become aware of awareness and aware of being, such as it is.\n\nEverything goes to shit--everything.� Even so, how precious, how wonderful, it is to be, to be aware, to be aware of awareness, to be aware of being.�\n\nFalling\n\nThe only thing left is this moment. Awakening to the visceral experience of awareness--awareness of awareness--this transient manifestation moves through the day one day, one breath, one heartbeat at a time. In this moment everything is here, everything is at stake. There is no time to waste by hiding from this living electric reality, by pretending to be something other than this living electric reality. Letting go, I fall into the infinite void of living electric reality, here, in this moment.�\n\nEgo Death, Universal Energy\n\nBefore and after the ego vanishes, what lives this life? What keeps on seeing, and hearing, and breathing, and walking, and talking, and being, and being aware? It can be called universal energy. It has assumed this transient form and has recognized itself, realized itself, and has realized the transience of its form. It recognizes itself in this form, and in every form.\n\nMid-Death Crisis\n\nThe so-called 'midlife crisis' of relatively prosperous middle-aged people can be an excuse to be self-indulgent or self-pitying for a while. What really tests our wits and character is how we handle our old age, when days become numbered. Traveling to exotic places or acquiring a sports car is no help at all when we are having an old-age mid-death crisis. The only help we have is our inmost nature, the primordial fire. All that we hold dear, all that we hold onto, will be lost; all that we think we are will be lost as well. All that survives is inmost nature, the primordial fire which creates and destroys everything. Die as the perishable self, and be reborn as the birthless, deathless primordial fire.\n\nHelp Yourself\n\nNature's presence is everywhere, within and without. There is nothing that is not nature's presence. Times of trouble in nature's presence are not times of trouble:� there is no time, no trouble in nature's presence. The perception of time and trouble is delusional, as is the perception of within and without. There is only nature's presence:� \"our\" presence is delusional. Our presence is actually nature's presence.\n\nThe true guru is within; nature is within; the primordial buddha is within; the universe is within. Inquire within, and rest within, in and as guru's/nature's/buddha's/universe's presence.\n\nAnimals Supporting Animals\n\nAnimals beget animals beget animals ad infinitum. While many animals may not yet have the wisdom to understand they are the universal energy, they can still be recognized, communicated with, and loved, as universal energy, by universal energy. Human beings are thinking animals, and we are either masters of thought or slaves of thought. Lacking insight, human animals are slaves of thought; with insight, masters of thought. When we witness the fleeting, illusory nature of thoughts rising and falling in pure mind, we are free. Undivided by thoughts, we are no longer separate from one another--we are one universal lifeforce, one universal energy, and see our true self not just within this particular being but in every being.\n\nThis Moment\n\nIt doesn't get any better than this moment. We can't escape this moment. Striving and planning will not make this moment any better than it already is. This moment is complete. Live in this moment, and enjoy the completion.\n\nLike A Dream\n\nIt has long felt like a dream to me, and evermoreso now. Waking up in this dream, how do I comport myself while the dream lasts? I turn to good books, especially books about Buddhism, for guidelines, and find them; they had me the moment I read a quote attributed to Siddhartha Gautama stating this is as a dream.\n\nForever Young\n\nAccepting inevitable change is an acquired skill, learned from experience. I've learned to accept the onset of sensory deficits, and will continue to learn to accept other changes to come, which will include the various illnesses and deficits of aging. The bodymind is full of surprises. To learn to accept cognitive deficits would be an interesting experience. The grand finale, of course, will be to learn to accept dying, and the moment of death, intense experiences within the clear-light witnessing awareness.\n\nIt has been a long process of disabusing myself of the notion of eternal personal youth, and of ceasing the denial of personal death.� Yet I now feel, and am, forever young. Any lifeform can, if sufficiently contemplative, realize it is life itself.\n\nOdium, Opium, Otium\n\nWork life, filled with the mostly trivial business of vested interests, can be oppressive and tedious, working with egos and abstractions for profit. Relief, at least temporarily, can be had with intoxicants, numbing the mind and silencing the voices. Ultimately, what matters most is how we spend our time remaining in human form while still of sound mind and body. What really makes this moment sufficient unto itself is to finally realize the eternal leisure and completeness of the universe is ours to enjoy.\n\nAppreciation Day\n\nWalking to work this morning, I appreciate getting some sleep, with dreams; with waking up yet again, another day for this old bodymind; a substantial breakfast; medicines to help keep me alive and well; a fresh newspaper; an effortless bowel movement; a shower; clean clothes; love from and for my housemates; the ability to walk; the ability to talk; the ability to sing and play musical instruments; and most of all, the ability to be able to appreciate the simple things like awareness and being.\n\nGod's Presence\n\nHow compelling it is to contemplate God's presence within us, and what an overwhelming experience it would be to actually encounter God's living presence within us. In the course of looking for God within, how would we know when we found Him? Looking and looking, where is He?\n\nHoly shit, He is the one who is looking.\n\nFor Whom Do I Speak, and As Whom Do I Speak?\n\nI used to speak for, and speak as, a glib, cynical, neurotic character, and that became tiresome. Now, I speak, I know not for whom, I know not as whom, I know not to whom. Speaking happens, seeing happens, listening happens, communicating happens, from whom to whom is unknown. Astonishing, and so commonplace.\n\nNothing, Really\n\nMy sight is filled with debris and visual neural noise. My hearing is filled with ringing noise and nerve damage. My mind is filled with constant mental activity. Witnessing awareness is nothing, and takes it all in. From the viewpoint of nothing, signal and noise is the same. The conditioned mind generates noise, as do the senses. The beautiful emptiness takes in everything without judgement. Always pristine, nothing is the universal witness.\n\nThe Most Important/Wonderful Thing\n\nTo know that we are the universe in temporary form is both the most important and the most wonderful thing. To really understand this fact, and to fully realize it, requires the relinquishing of the notion of who we thought we were back in the days when we thought we were a separate independent entity, and not the universe. Being one with the universe is not a feeling, it is a fact. In fact, we are not just one \"with\" the universe, we are simply the universe itself. There is no separation, no difference, between it and us. It is I, it is you, it is all there is.\n\nSee with the universe's eyes. Listen with the universe's ears. Speak with the universe's tongue. Enjoy the universe's brief bodymind expression. Express the love the universe has for itself.\n\nCosmic Cleanse\n\nTime for an esotericism cleanse, getting rid of the exotic concepts and terminology that accumulate so easily. What really works for me is to go fully cosmic: cosmic sight, cosmic hearing, cosmic awareness, cosmic consciousness, cosmic being, cosmic love. The trappings of religion, even lovely traditions such as Buddhism and Hinduism, are still trappings, and traps. Give me self-liberated beings who see with the eyes of the universe and who know they are the universe itself. Give me unpretentious beings, animals, people being authentic even though unaware they're the universe--all beings are the universe, to be loved, to be heard, to be recognized, to be with.\n\nThought Control\n\nBeing controlled by one's own thoughts is the major challenge of the human condition. The harder we try to control thoughts, the more controlled by thoughts we become. Thoughts become masters, and we can even hear the masters' voices in the head. These voices can drive us to extremes if we don't recognize them as mere thoughts that arise and disappear on their own, and we cling to them, identify with them, sustain them for as long as possible.\n\nIntrinsic Status Symbol\n\nThe freedom of our attention span is the true mark of our status. If we can look freely, without fear or favor, at anything and anyone anywhere and anytime, we are looking with the eyes of the universe. We don't need money or possessions or special privileges or title to determine our true status--if we can see with the eyes of the universe, we are enjoying the highest status possible in the universe. No-one can change, or take away, or deny, what we really are. Look into each other's eyes and enjoy the bliss of the universe recognizing itself. The most wonderful thing is found no further than in each other's eyes, ablaze with the ancient clear light of the universe.�\n\nPermanent Impermanence\n\nGoing through the morning list of blessings--waking up to see another day, still able to walk, talk, sing, play the piano, still enjoying reasonably good health, suffering no serious discomforts, having a good breakfast, enjoying love from and for other lifeforms, still able to see and hear and taste and feel and smell and think and not think--the only blessing that's permanent is the pure awareness luminous emptiness of the dharmakaya, the clear light, consuming every rising thing that rises within itself. What good fortune to find dzogchen, rigpa, dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, nirmanakaya, clear light in the midst of impermanence, while this human bodymind form is still holding more-or-less together until it, too, vanishes.\n\nSamantabhadra/Samantabhadri\n\nSamantabhadra is the primordial buddha, present everywhere forever, the essence of compassion, merged in bliss with Samantabhadri, the essence of emptiness and wisdom. Our true nature--buddha nature--is Samantabhadra/Samantabhadri nature. Fly the cosmically erotic flag of Samantabhadra/Samantabhadri with joy.\n\nIncarnation\n\nLove all beings, love every lifeform. Every being, every lifeform, is our incarnation.\n\nMy Dear Suffering Waves\n\nFilled with desires and opinions and fears and beliefs and delusions, clinging to life and fearing death, burnishing your reputation and fearing ridicule, just give up the suffering, insufferable life of the wave and remember that you are the ocean. Waves do not last, they rise and they fall. That from which they rise is the ocean; that into which they fall is the ocean. So where does that leave birth and death of a wave? We do not celebrate the rising of a wave, nor do we mourn its falling, if we understand that there is no separate existence of a wave apart from the ocean.\n\nLive as the ocean. Speak as the ocean. Love as the ocean. Celebrate being the ocean, birthless, deathless, and all its transient waves.\n\nThe bodhisattva vows to save all sentient beings, even though there are no sentient beings to be saved. The ocean lets its waves learn they're ocean, some the hard way, others the wise way, and the rest just fall back into the ocean after an eyeblink of hapless survival strategizing.\n\nPlaying\n\nThe impermanence of everything, the mortality of every lifeform, lends a dreamlike quality to daily life. What could be taken seriously? Who could be taken seriously? The universe plays us, until we realize we are the universe, and we play. This is the great perfection, the great refuge, the great completion, the great love.\n\nBack Home\n\nWandering in the deserts of distraction and disappointment, following paths with no heart, I follow my own path and find my way home. Home is the path with heart. Home is the heart. I've been away for a long time, and I'm back home, singing, and shedding tears of joy.\n\nWhat I Live For, and What I Live As\n\nIt's good to make it clear what we live for, or, posthumously, what we lived for. Otherwise friends, family, strangers, and flowery-obituary writers can misrepresent us. Who understands us better than us?\n\nWe can learn to accept being misunderstood, and continue with the process of deepening our own understanding of our true self, which is the true self of everyone.\n\nWhile respecting the wisdom traditions of this planet's people, we test received wisdom and see if it accords with our own experiences and experiments, and reach an understanding on our own terms.\n\nWhat I live for is to live as the true self, universal life itself; what I live as is the true self, universal life itself.\n\nLife recognizes life. Life loves life.\n\nLosing Religion\n\nReligion can be seductively comforting, and can become a hindrance to realizing the true self. Words and concepts distract, distort, blind. Truth is a living thing that can't survive in a cage of concepts.\n\nGoing wild as the true self is subtle, quiet process: outwardly, there appears to be ordinariness, self-control, self-effacement; no devout monk would subject himself to such psychological austerity; inwardly, there is ecstatic passion as great as the universe.\n\nThe universe doesn't need, or want, religion.\n\nHuman Lifeform\n\nI am not a human lifeform that has life, I am life that has assumed a human lifeform.
