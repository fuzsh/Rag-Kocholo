The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 9:30 a.m. in room SH-216, Hart Senate Office Building, Hon. John McCain, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN McCAIN, U.S. SENATOR FROM ARIZONA The Chairman. Good morning. We have a very full and busy hearing schedule today. For the benefit of my colleagues, I would like to mention a couple of housekeeping items. One, as I understand it we may have one or more votes around 11 o'clock which will then, obviously, cause us some disruption. Also it is my intention, because of the very long day yesterday, that we will break around 12:30 today. Hopefully we will finish before then, but if not, we will break at 12:30 for one hour, and reconvene at 1:30. We have a large number of witnesses who have great interest in this hearing, so I would also ask my colleagues if they would try to make their opening statements as brief as possible. The purpose of this hearing is to discuss the Federal Trade Commission report entitled, The Marketing of Violent Entertainment to Children. The report examines the marketing practices of the motion picture, music, and video game industries. The report concludes, and I quote, ``individual companies in each industry routinely market to children the very products that have the company's own parental warnings, or ratings, with age restrictions due to their violent content.'' The report exposed, ``that extensive marketing, and in many instances explicit targeting of violent R-rated films to children under the age of 17 and violent PG-13 films to children under 13''. Of the 44 R-rated films studied by the Commission, 80 percent were targeted to children under the age of 17. The report documents extensive market research activities, citing examples of studios testing rough cuts of R-rated films on children as young as 12 years old, and revealed that violent PG-13 rated movies were targeted at children 11 and younger. One particularly disturbing quote from a marketing plan for an R-rated movie sequel states, quote, ``it seems to make sense to interview 10- to 11-year-olds. In addition, we will survey African American and Latino movie-goers between the ages of 10 and 24.'' I find this patently offensive. Studios ran ads heavily during the television programs such as The Simpsons, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Dawson's Creek, Xena: Warrior Princess, Hercules, and WWF Smackdown. These programs have some of the highest under-17 viewership. Web sites like HappyPuppy.com and MTV.com are used to attract kids. Comic books and the schoolhouse could not even protect our children from the studio hacks. Quoting from the report, ``magazines with majority under-17 audiences such as Teen, D.C. Comics Teens, or Marvel Comics, contained advertisements for numerous R-rated films. ``In addition, six of the studios use print media distributed exclusively in schools, Planet Report, and/or Fast Times, to advertise R-rated movies.'' The report notes that these periodicals are often mandatory reading for high school students. One studio distributed free movie passes to its R-rated movie at high schools, and distributed promotional material to youth groups such as Camp Fire Boys and Girls. We intend to find out which studio that was, and if the movie executives were here today perhaps we could have asked them. The FTC's mystery shopper survey sent kids 13 to 16 years old to 395 theaters, and 46 percent of the time these kids were able to purchase tickets to R-rated films. This fact is significant, because following a White House Summit on Violence last year, President Clinton and theater operators trumpeted a new zero-tolerance policy to prevent kids from buying tickets to restricted films. This zero tolerance policy claim, like the repeated claims before this Committee by the Motion Picture Industry that the industry is protecting our children with rating systems and codes of conduct, has been nothing but a smokescreen to provide cover for immoral and unconscionable business practices. I want to cite in detail one example that stands out as particularly despicable. I quote, ``At least one studio was thwarted in its attempt to market a PG-13 film to children 6 to 11 on Nickelodeon, when the network concluded that it would not be appropriate to air advertisements for that film because the Nickelodeon audience is mostly children under 12, and the film contains situations not seen on Nickelodeon, including several gun battles, a couple of fight sequences, some devastating gun blasts, in addition to strong language and sexual suggestion.'' The studio's advertising agency noted that it advanced several justifications to Nickelodeon showing the ads including, this film needs the audience Nickelodeon provides to be successful. Though the FTC report has been redacted, after some investigation the Committee was able to establish that the motion picture studio involved was Sony, and the film was an extraordinarily violent film named the Fifth Element, starring Bruce Willis. The ad agency involved was McCann-Erickson. There will be much said today, but thundering silence will be heard from motion picture executives. They have all been invited to testify. By some uncanny coincidence, every single studio executive was either out of the country or unavailable. I can only conclude the industry was too ashamed of or unable to defend their marketing practices. Their hubris is stunning, and serves to underscore the lack of corporate responsibility so strikingly apparent in this report. We do, however, have witnesses from the recording industry and the video game industry. I hope that all on the Committee will join me in commending their willingness to testify before us today. Their cooperation stands in sharp contrast to the motion picture industry. As with motion pictures, the music industry is clearly guilty of marketing violence to children. One marketing plan cited by the FTC report states, ``the team is promoting heavily at the local high school and colleges, and the colleges and high schools and community centers are the focus of our attack.'' Print ads were consistently placed in magazines like Seventeen, Skateboarding, YM, and Vibe. These magazines have an under 18 readership of between 40 and 80 percent. Television programs like The Simpsons and Buffy the Vampire Slayer represent some of the highest teen audience members on TV, and were consistently used to market label recording products. Though the music labeling system is basically useless, as it contains no content information and no age-appropriate recommendations, the FTC did conduct a secret shopper survey. Not surprisingly, 85 percent of the time children were successful in purchasing labeled recordings. Given the lack of information provided, the only thing remarkable about this number is that every child was not able to make a purchase. I understand that the music industry has announced a series of steps designed to address some of these concerns. I will leave it to the witnesses to outline these changes. To their credit, the video game industry has the most comprehensive and informative labeling system that provides detailed information about content and age appropriateness. Unfortunately, this system did not prevent marketing to kids. Nearly 70 percent of the games reviewed by the Commission were targeted to kids under 17. One particularly shocking marketing report stated that, ``though the game has two ratings for teens only, I have asked Nickelodeon sales to help get an approval so that the product can air on the network. Nickelodeon airs 27 of the top 30 cable shows against our target demo for boys 9 to 17.'' I want to make clear that neither this report nor this Committee intends to make the case for censorship. We make no threat against the First Amendment. It is not my purpose to pass judgment on the products of your industries. We all have our own views on the quality and value of what will be defended as art, but that is not the question today. Defending these market practices does not defend art or free expression. It defends the bottom line of your corporations, and while as a defender of the free market I do not begrudge anyone's honest profits: I do not think they need to come at the expense of our children's well-being. What is in question is not Government censorship but industry responsibility. It is your responsibility to refrain from making more difficult a parent's responsibility to see that their children grow up healthy in mind and body into adults who are capable of judging for themselves the quality or lack thereof of your art. I could go on, but time is short, and the witness list is long. Chairman Pitofsky will provide us with the details of the FTC report. I want to commend the staff of the Federal Trade Commission on an excellent job. I want to acknowledge the leadership of Senator Brownback in this effort, and many others. Finally, I want to get back to the motion picture industry and their failure to present even one witness for this panel. The Committee received essentially two excuses for why studio executives saw fit only to send their lobbyists to represent them. First, they were virtually all out of the country. Secondly, they did not have the time to respond to the substance of the report. On the second count, the contents of this report are based almost entirely upon data provided by the studios themselves, thus I assume they are already familiar with it. In addition, Committee staff have been talking regularly with studio lobbyists for several months about a hearing in September and the need to present studio executives. Furthermore, the FTC has served a 15-day advance notice to all entities involved in the pending report. Finally, there has been an intense dialogue between the Committee and the industry lobbyists over the past 2 weeks. Yet here we are, with no direct representation by the motion picture industry. This is a sad commentary on corporate responsibility, and an affront to American families whose children are so clearly in the crosshairs of hundreds of millions of dollars in movie violence advertising. As such, I am announcing today that this Committee will convene another full Committee hearing 2 weeks from today for the sole purpose of hearing motion picture industry testimony in response to the FTC report. As this hearing proceeds, invitations are being delivered to Gerald Levin, chairman of Time Warner, Incorporated, Michael Eisner, chairman of The Walt Disney Company, Rupert Murdoch, chairman of Newscorp, Sumner Redstone, chairman of Viacom, Incorporated, Edgar Bronfman, chairman of Seagram, Stacey Snider, chairman of Universal Studios, John Calley, chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment, Jim Gianopulos, president of Twentieth Century Fox, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Dreamworks/SKG, Sherry Lansing, chairman of Paramount Picture/Viacom, Barry Meyer, chairman of Warner Brothers, Michael Nathanson, president of MGM Pictures, and Harvey Weinstein, chairman of Miramax. By that time, these individuals will have had 2 full weeks to clear their schedules and to study the report. They will have no excuses for failing to appear before this Committee. Senator Hollings.

Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and I appreciate the fact that you are going to call that hearing within 2 weeks, and I will file my statement. Let me summarize briefly. In the words of our famous leader, President Ronald Reagan, ``Here we go again.'' Chairman Hyde back in the House committee back in 1952 concluded that the television broadcast industry was a perpetuator and a deliverer of violence. In 1954, 1964, during that 10-year period the Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings conclusively, and I quote, establishing the relationship between television, crime, and violence, between 1960 and 1999, 30 years, this Committee itself has had 20 hearings, Mr. Chairman, on this particular subject. In 1969, Senator Pastore had extensive hearings resulting in the request for the Surgeon General's study, and in 1972 the Surgeon General reported that a causal link between viewing violence as a child and subsequent violent aggressive behavior. Of course, Dr. Leon Elder of the University of Michigan, who published the famous book on this particular subject, after a 20-year study he concluded there was a direct causal link between the childhood viewing of television and violent conduct. In 1982, the National Institute of Mental Health, after 10 years of research, found the consensus among all of the research communities that violence on television leads to aggressive behavior. In 1990, we put in an antitrust--you see, the strategy of not appearing was to say, oh, wait a minute, we can do it, and so in 1990 this Committee, Mr. Chairman, gave the industry an antitrust exemption under Senator Paul Simon's bill, and after they had voluntarily done it in 1992 the networks issued this confusing standard thing, but 1993, Dr. Brandon Cantrell's study found the same thing, that the homicide rate doubles 10 years after television is introduced in a country. And in 1995, we finally got to the safe harbor bill that is, excessive gratuitous violence forbidden during the periods 9:00 in the morning to 9:00 in the evening, when the youth predominate the viewing audience. This is the practice, and proven and tried and true in Europe and Australia and down in New Zealand. They do not go into schools down in Australia, or in the countries in Europe, and shoot up the student body. We reported that out twice unanimously from this Committee. We have that same bill in this Committee, and I would ask that you consider, Mr. Chairman, for it to be included again on the markup. I think I conclude here by saying that in 1998 there were other studies, but here were the television people and the movie people. It was actually sponsored by the cable industry, but it included in the study, the National Television Violence Study, amongst other council members Chairman Beals of the Marketing Society, Belva Davis, American Federation of Television and Radio Artists; Charles B. Fitzsimmons, Producers Guild of America; Ann Marcus, Caucus for the Producers and Writers and Directors, Jean Reynolds, the Directors Guild of America, and they found conclusively that violence on television has been shown to have an influence on aggressive behavior. It is common sense. We know it, and like Pogo we have met the enemy and it is us, because I hold up--and I will just read three paragraphs from the history of broadcasting. They know violence sells. This is back in 1949, 50 years ago. Man Against Crime. Man Against Crime was sponsored by Camel cigarettes. This affected both the writing and the direction. Mimeographed instructions told writers, and I quote, do not have the heavy or disreputable person smoking a cigarette. Do not associate the smoking of cigarettes with undesirable scenes or situations, plot-wise. Then, moving on, cigarettes had to be smoked gracefully, never puffed nervously. A cigarette was never given to a character to calm his nerves, since this might suggest a narcotic effect. Writers received numerous plot instructions. But here is a producer's instructions 50 years ago, quote: It has been found that we retain audience interest best when our story is concerned with murder. Therefore, although other crimes may be introduced, somebody must be murdered, preferably early, with the threat of more violence to come. This is a history of broadcasting by the industry itself. For 50 years, we have known it. It is obvious. We continue to have hearings. We will have another hearing 2 weeks from now, but we have got a solution, tried and true. It is in Europe, down in Australia and New Zealand. It is in this Committee if we only could report it out and vote on it. It would be a privilege. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Senator Hollings follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Ernest F. Hollings, U.S. Senator From South Carolina Mr. Chairman I commend you for holding this hearing today. The issue of the exposure of children to violence in the media has been with us for a long time. I have been involved in addressing the issue of television violence for several Congresses. I believe the best step towards protecting children is to restrict the airing of violent programing to hours when children are least likely to be watching. In 1952, a House subcommittee first looked at the issue of violence on radio and television. The Senate Judiciary Committee began hearings on this issue in 1954 and the Senate Commerce Committee began hearings in 1960. Since that time there have been studies that link aggression, violent behavior, and a desensitization to violence in children to their exposure to violent programming. In 1972, the Surgeon General's report concluded that there is a causal link between viewing violence as a child and subsequent violent or aggressive behavior. Even a study in 1998 by the National Cable Television Association conceded that ``violence in television has been shown in hundreds of studies to have an influence on aggressive behavior.'' In order to deal with this issue, the various industry segments have adopted ratings systems and in 1996, Congress enacted V-chip legislation. So far, however, ratings have not proven to be an effective tool. With respect to television, the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 79 percent of shows with violence did not receive a ``V'' for ``violence'' rating. A more recent survey by the foundation determined that 9 percent of parents of children ages 2-17 now have a television with a V-chip and only 3 percent of all parents have programmed the chip to block shows they deem unsuitable for their children. With regard to movies, while 90 percent of parents are familiar with movie ratings, children are often able to purchase tickets and attend movies that are not suitable for their viewership. On the music industry side, the ``Parents Advisory Label'' appears on less than one half of 1 percent of the total inventory of music stores and as significantly, the warnings do not appear in music videos. Finally, as it concerns video games, 15 percent of boys say their parents understand the ratings system and 90 percent say that their parents never check the ratings before allowing them to buy the game. So during these years of hearings, and studies, and ratings, children continue to be exposed to media violence. A child before completing elementary school will see 8,000 murders and 100,000 other actions of violence on television alone. Now we have another study which tells us that the industry is targeting violent media products at children. It is now time to take definitive action. Self-regulation is not working. Ratings are not working. Therefore, we should take a strong step to solve this problem by instituting a safe harbor to protect our children. The legislation that I have introduced and that is cosponsored by Senator Dorgan, requires the creation of a safe harbor time period during which broadcasters and other video programmers would not be permitted to transmit violent programming. If the industry will not act responsibly then Congress must act. Thanks Mr. Chairman for holding this hearing. I welcome the witnesses and look forward to hearing their testimony. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Hollings. At your request we will place it on the markup for next Wednesday. I thank you for your involvement. I would earnestly solicit brief comments from the other Members of the Committee. I would appreciate it. Senator Burns. STATEMENT OF HON. CONRAD BURNS, U.S. SENATOR FROM MONTANA Senator Burns. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and my statement will be very short. It may take all day just to get the statements in here, but I first of all want to thank the FTC, for their work, and the relationship we have had with the FTC and this Committee and this Congress, which has been very, very constructive and very, very good. And also I noted that, just what the Chairman had noted a while ago, the studios are not here, and I think it is unfair. I think it is unfair. Now, they are sending their representative today, a very able and capable representative. It is unfair to him to make him come up and plead their case when they ought to be here themselves trying to do it. There are all kinds of pollution, and we deal with all of them here in the Congress, but the deadliest of all of them is noise and mind pollution to a society. It is the deadliest kind, because it tears at the very moral fiber of a Nation and of a society, and yet no one wants to take responsibility. Marketing to children--where have we heard that before, and not very long ago?--I am wondering if those folks who were as aggressive at that little exercise that happened here in Congress--marketing to children--will be as aggressive this time. I am not suggesting censorship or anything like that, because there are a lot of us that are at this table that served for this country and protected that First Amendment beyond belief, because we believe in it, but we also fought for this country because we were a responsible country, and that is not being shown here today, and to our Chairman and this Committee, like it should have been. And so the schedule of another hearing, Mr. Chairman, I applaud you, and I also want to applaud the work of Senator Brownback in this cause, but I think it was something that had to happen because of the kind of pollution that we are dealing with here today. Thank you very much. The Chairman. Thank you. Senator Bryan. STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD H. BRYAN, U.S. SENATOR FROM NEVADA Senator Bryan. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for convening this hearing, and I would like to preface my comments by commending the Federal Trade Commission, and particularly its very able chairman, Mr. Pitofsky. No one would deny that the entertainment media has an enormous impact on our youth and helps to shape the youth culture in America. The recent study found that the typical American child spends an average of more than 38 hours a week, nearly the equivalent of a full-time work week, with entertainment media outside of the school. The findings of the recent FTC report concerning the marketing of violent movies, music, and electronic games to children I find most troublesome. The rising tide of senseless violence in our country has shocked the American public. The circumstances that led to the tragedy that occurred at Littleton, Colorado, nearly 17 months ago has reinvigorated the public debate about the effects of violent entertainment, of the media, on youth, and while it may be impossible to show a causal relationship between the youth's exposure to media violence and violent behavior in a particular case, many researchers have come to the conclusion, as I have, that a child's exposure to violent entertainment media can be a factor contributing to aggression, antisocial attitudes, and violence. Even more troublesome and disturbing than the abundance of violent movies, music, and video games is the manner in which these games and movies and music are marketed to our youth. It defies rational explanation to understand how a movie studio can on the one hand acknowledge that an R-rated movie that it has produced has inappropriate content for a child under the age of 17 unless accompanied by an adult, and on the other hand employ a marketing strategy for that movie specifically targeted at that audience. This type of marketing strategy makes a mockery of the movie rating system, and is seemingly based on the presumption that most parents would be willing to take the children to an R-rated movie. Parents today have a very difficult time in raising their children. My wife and I have been blessed this past year with three little grandchildren and a fourth is on the way. They have responsible parents, good parents. How difficult the challenges are for them, much more difficult than in our generation in raising our own children. The actions by this industry are irresponsible and, indeed, unconscionable in terms of what it does to young people and the difficulty it presents to parents today. The current marketing techniques employed by the entertainment industry has the perverse effect of complicating a parent's job in choosing which movies, which CD's or video games are appropriate for their children. At a time when the entertainment industry should be looking at new and innovative ways to provide parents with tools to help parents make informed decisions about what type of media is appropriate for their children, it appears that the industry is working at cross-purposes and, indeed, is part of an effort to market inappropriate material to young people. Again, I thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Thank you. Senator Brownback. STATEMENT OF HON. SAM BROWNBACK, U.S. SENATOR FROM KANSAS Senator Brownback. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Congratulations for holding this hearing, and the one announced in weeks, and the one yesterday, and the one tomorrow. You have got the Committee working hard and doing good work for the people. This is an important hearing and an important report that is being released on Monday. When several of us introduced legislation last year to authorize this FTC report, we did so because the anecdotal evidence was overwhelming that violent, adult-rated entertainment was being marketed to children. It has been said that much of modern research is the corroboration of the obvious by obscure methods. The study does corroborate what many of us have long suspected, and it does so unambiguously and conclusively. It shows, as Chairman Pitofsky noted, that the marketing is pervasive and aggressive. It shows that entertainment companies are literally making a killing off of marketing violence to kids. The problem is not just one industry, but can be found in virtually every form of entertainment--movies, music, video, and PC games. All together, they take up the majority of a child's leisure hours, and the message they get and the images they see often glamorize brutality and trivialize cruelty. Take, for example, popular music. The FTC report notes that all of the stickered music they surveyed was target-marketed to kids, 100 percent. Now, in the room we have some easels that show some examples of this music by listing their lyrics. This stuff is not for the faint-hearted, but the music industry has decided it is for children. Nor are these obscure songs. The lyrics from Eminem are from an album that is currently at number 3 on the Billboard chart, after spending 2 months this summer at number 1. He received three awards from MTV last week. The other two featured artists, DMX and Dr. Dre, are currently in the top 30 in the charts, and peaked at number 1 and 2 respectively. Mr. Chairman, I would just note that as you read through some of the words here--I could not put all of the words up. Of course, I think you can get what Dr. Dre is saying based just on his title--one which I am not going to pronounce. How does it make you feel here, listening to this, looking at it, and knowing that 100 percent of this is targeted, marketed to children. Now, maybe I am a little more sensitive to this than others because I have five children, but I do not like it, and I think it is wrong for these companies to use millions of dollars to target this to children. It is especially wrong when they themselves say this is inappropriate for those children! I know it makes all of us blush and feel uncomfortable here in this room today, and yet it is okay for a 14-year-old? Indeed, major billion-dollar companies would spend millions selling this to these children. Movies are equally blatant in their marketing kits and appalling in their content. Movies have great power, because stories have great power--they can move us, change our minds, our hearts, even our hopes. The movie industry wields enormous influence, and when used responsibly the works can edify, uplift, and inspire--but all too often that power is used to exploit. The Chairman. Senator Brownback, you have run out of time. Senator Brownback. I would like to submit the rest of this for the record if I could, Mr. Chairman. I would also urge that we not stop at this, that we should ask these companies, all of which have issued statements about what they want to do, to just stop putting out some of these products. [The prepared statement of Senator Brownback follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Sam Brownback, U.S. Senator From Kansas Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the widespread interest in today's hearing. It's been said that every good idea goes through three stages: first, it is ridiculed. Second, it is bitterly opposed. And last, it is accepted as obvious. Over the past two years, I have chaired three hearings in this Committee on the effectiveness of labels and ratings, the impact of violent interactive entertainment products on kids, and the first hearing on whether violent products were being marketed to children. When we started out, these ideas were ridiculed. Bitter opposition shortly followed. And today, in reviewing the FTC report, the fact that harmful, violent entertainment is being marketed to kids is now being accepted as clear and obvious. We've come a long way. I appreciate the industry executives who have come here today. I wish that the many other executives who were invited to testify would have seen fit to show up. I have to say, Mr. Chairman, that many in the entertainment industry have shown themselves to be remarkably unresponsive to this Committee. At each of these three hearings on violent entertainment I chaired in this Committee, we invited numerous industry executives--including representatives of Time-Warner, Seagrams, Universal, Sony, Viacom, BMG, Nintendo, Hasbro, ID Software, Midway Games, and Interscope Records. Unfortunately, none of these enormous communications companies could be bothered to communicate with the United States Senate. And today, I see that not one single movie studio representative managed to show up. Mr. Chairman, this is disgraceful. I appreciate the industry executives who have made it here today; I am deeply troubled by the fact that so few of them choose to do so. Their absence today is a sharp contrast to the presence of so many concerned parents. And their silence on an issue of such importance to so many speaks volumes about their disregard both for concerned parents and vulnerable children. This is an important hearing, and an important report. When I introduced legislation last year, which was cosponsored by several of my colleagues here today, to authorize this FTC report, I did so because the anecdotal evidence was overwhelming that violent, adult- rated entertainment was being marketed to children. It's been said that much of modern research is the corroboration of the obvious by obscure methods. This study does corroborate what many of us have long suspected--and it does so unambiguously and conclusively. It shows, as Chairman Pitofsky noted, that the marketing is ``pervasive and aggressive.'' It shows that entertainment companies are literally making a killing off of marketing violence to kids. The problem is not one industry, but can be found in virtually every form of entertainment: movies, music, and video and PC games. Together, they take up the majority of a child's leisure hours. And the messages they get, and images they see, often glamorize brutality, and trivialize cruelty. Take, for example, popular music. The FTC report notes that all of the stickered music they surveyed was target-marketed to kids. Around the room here on easels are some examples of that music. This stuff is not for the faint-hearted. But the music industry has decided it's for children. Nor are these obscure songs. The lyrics from Eminem (pronounced M & M) are from an album that is currently at number 3 on the Billboard chart, after spending two months this summer at number 1. He received 3 awards from MTV last week. The other two featured artists--DMX and Dr. Dre (pronounced ``Dray'') are currently in the top 30 on the charts, and peaked at number 1 and 2, respectively. As I read over this report, I see that 100 percent ! of the stickered albums that the FTC surveyed were target-marketed to kids. This is both troubling and fairly predictable. Troubling in that the lyrics you see around the room are target-marketed to young kids-- mostly young boys--whose characters, attitudes, assumptions, and values are still being formed, and vulnerable to being warped. And predictable in that there are few fans of such music that are over 20. Movies are equally blatant in their marketing to kids, and appalling in their content. Movies have great power--because stories have great power. They can move us, change our minds, our hearts, even our hopes. The movie industry wields enormous influence, and when used responsibly, their works can edify, uplift, and inspire. But all too often, that power is used to exploit. I've seen some movies that are basically two-hour long commercials for the misuse of guns. The movie industry has had the chutzpah to target-market teen slasher movies to child audiences--and then insist that the R-rating somehow protects them. From reading this report, it seems clear that the ratings protect the industry from the consumers, not the consumers from the industry. Or take video games. When kids play violent video games, they do not merely witness slaughter, they engage in virtual murder. Indeed, the point of what are called ``first person shooter'' games--that is, virtually all M-rated games--is to kill as many characters as possible. The higher the body count, the higher your score. Often, bonus points are given for finishing off your enemies in a particularly grisly way. Common sense should tell us that positively reinforcing sadistic behavior, as these games do, cannot be good for our children. We cannot expect that the hours spent in school will mold and instruct a child's mind but that hours spent immersed in violent entertainment will not. We cannot hope that children who are entertained by violence will love peace. This is not only common sense, but a public health consensus. In late July, I convened a public health summit on entertainment violence. At the summit, we released a joint statement signed by the most prominent and prestigious members of the public health community-- including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Psychological Association, the Academy of Family Physicians, the American Psychiatric Association, and the Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatrists. I want to read you part of the statement, signed by all of the above organizations: ``Well over 1000 studies . . . point overwhelmingly to a causal connection between media violence and aggressive behavior in some children. The conclusion of the public health community, based on over thirty years of research, is that viewing entertainment violence can lead to increases in aggressive attitudes, values and behaviors, particularly in children.'' There is no longer a question as to whether exposing children to violent entertainment is a public health risk. It is--just as surely as tobacco or alcohol. The question is: what are we going to do about it? What does it take for the entertainment industry, and its licensees and retailers, to stop exposing children to poison? There is an additional element that this generally excellent report fails to cover: and that is the cross-marketing of violence to kids. That is, there is ample proof that the entertainment industry not only directly targets children with advertising and other forms of promotion, but also markets to them via toys. Walk into any toy store in America, and you will find dolls, action figures, hand held games, and Halloween costumes based on characters in R-rated movies, musicians noted for their violent lyrics, and M-rated video games. Let me give you just a few examples . . . [Show games] This is an equally egregious aspect of marketing violence to children, and one that has not yet been adequately investigated. We need to do so. I look forward to working with the FTC to ensure that this is done. Another immediate step we need to take is to ensure that these industries can enter into a code of conduct. Consumers and parents need to know what their standards are--how high they aim, or how low they will go. I've introduced legislation, S. 2127, that would provide a very limited anti-trust exemption that would enable, not require, but enable companies to do just that. There are other steps we should consider, but a rush to legislation is not one. Frankly, imposing six-month deadlines on an industry one is actively fleecing for money is unlikely to bring about lasting reform. We need to encourage responsibility and self-regulation. We need a greater corporate regard for the moral, physical and emotional health and well-being of children. This report is an important step in that direction--because although it concentrates on the tip of the iceberg, it sheds light on the magnitude of the problem. It shows kids are being exploited for profit, and exposes a cultural externality in this market. Ultimately, we have asked entertainment executives to come here to work with us, and to appeal to your sense of citizenship, and to your corporate conscience. Our appeal is this: please do the right thing. Stop making hyper-violent entertainment which glamorizes cruelty, degrades women, and trivializes abuse. And stop marketing such vile stuff to kids. Just stop it. You don't need to do it, it is morally wrong to do it, and you are hurting kids. So just stop. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Brownback. Senator Kerry. STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN F. KERRY, U.S. SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS Senator Kerry. Mr. Chairman, thanks for having this hearing. I think the FTC has done a good service and an outstanding job in placing before us a serious problem, which is the problem of potential unfair trade practice, the problem of not adhering to what people have said they will adhere to, which is the standard by which they are going to advertise and protect our children, and to that degree I think it is very appropriate that we are here. It is more than appropriate that we are talking about the recommendations they have made, specifically that we expand the codes prohibiting marketing to children, that we increase the compliance at the retail level, which is very clearly a problem, and that we increase parental understanding of ratings and try to facilitate the capacity of parents to be able to make choices. Those are things we can do legitimately, they are things we ought to do, and those are things which I think ought to be in the public dialogue front and center, in the most serious way. But I react a little bit like Fritz Hollings did. In the 16 years I have been here, I have been here many times on this same subject. It is becoming repetitive, and that is equally disturbing. At the same time, we have found historically that this is not as clear-cut as some would like to make it. To the degree that there is a false advertising process, or that there is marketing to children, that is egregious. It is unacceptable, and we should all be against it, but on the other hand let us not assume that sort of pontificating role of Washington politicians where we sit here and blame it all on one entity. Art has always reflected life. I mean, Elvis Presley was unacceptable for a period of time. James Dean in East of Eden reflected alienated young people. Alienation among young people is something that is historical. It is part of adolescence, and we ought to be asking ourselves perhaps equally as seriously, as we look at the question of enforcing marketing to kids, I think we ought to ask ourselves a little bit up here why so many kids reflect the kind of life they reflect. Why are so many kids out of school in so many communities in the afternoon with no parents at home? Why are there no after-school programs? Why is there a lack of structure in kids' lives? Why is it that so many children are growing up at risk in this country at a time when we are the richest nation on the face of the planet? Those are questions that we also ought to ask here, and we also ought to provide some solutions to them. If you want to empower parents to be able to make some of these choices, parents need to also be able to be home and be with their kids. The Chairman. Senator Kerry, your time has expired. Senator Kerry. I think there are a lot of issues that are on the table here, but I could not agree more that the marketing against an agreed-upon set of principles, specifically to avoid what has been agreed upon, is obviously unfair, it is immoral, it is wrong, and it is appropriate for us to try to hold people accountable, but let us let accountability be passed appropriately to all quarters. [The prepared statement of Senator Kerry follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. John F. Kerry, U.S. Senator From Massachusetts Thank you Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing today. The FTC has done an outstanding job documenting industry practices with regard to marketing violence to children. Too often lately, when we turn on the news we hear a tragic story of a child engaging in unfathomable acts of violence. The litany is too familiar; Littleton, Colorado; Jonesboro, Arkansas; Edinboro, Pennsylvania; West Paducah, Kentucky; Flint, Michigan to name but a few of the places where tragic shootings have occurred in our schools. I do not believe that the media is solely responsible for these sad events. But I do believe that when our young people are bombarded with shocking, graphic violent images in the movies they watch, the games they play, and the music they listen to, they become inured to abnormal, immoral levels of violence. We're not going to stop violent images in the media. Our First Amendment wouldn't let us, even if it were possible. But we do have to make every effort to guarantee that violent images are seen and heard only by adults. We have to make sure that parents understand what their children are watching, listening to, and playing. In particular, we need to make sure that the cards are not stacked against parents who are trying to monitor their children's activities. Mr. Chairman, I was very disappointed to read in the FTC's report that the movie, music and electronic game industries have knowingly and intentionally marketed to children entertainment that each has deemed appropriate only for mature audiences. The FTC's finding that of 35 of 44 R-rated movies--80 percent--were directly marketed to children under 17 is evidence that not enough is being done. And the problems are not exclusive to the movie industry. The FTC found direct evidence that children were being targeted for music containing parental advisory warnings and for video games deemed appropriate for mature audiences. Let's be clear here. What most parents most want and need is information about their children's entertainment choices. But if the ads their children are seeing are being surreptitiously placed where the children and not the parents will see them, the parents are starting with a distinct disadvantage. The problem starts when a young child watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer sees an advertisement for violent R-rated movies such as South Park, The General's Daughter or The Beach. The problem starts when a child reading Teen magazine or Marvel Comics is tempted by an ad for the latest rap or hip hop CD that contains explicit, violent content. The problem starts when a video game that features realistic shootings and violence against women is advertised on a Web site that is frequented by teens. The problem continues when a fifteen-year-old can buy a ticket to a PG-rated movie and easily slip into an R-rated movie playing at the same multiplex. The problem continues when the seventeen-year-old cashier at the record store sells a CD with a parental advisory to a fourteen-year-old. The problem continues when an overworked temporary clerk hired to handle the Christmas rush at a large department store sell a ``mature'' video game to a ten-year-old. It's a hard enough job being a parent in today's world. These kinds of marketing practices, which the FTC has demonstrated are all too common in the entertainment industry, make a parent's job that much more difficult. The entertainment industry has a responsibility to parents to make their jobs a little easier. The FTC makes some concrete recommendations regarding self-regulation and it is my hope that we will see the industry address some of these issues quickly and stop some of the most egregious acts of targeting young people for violent entertainment. I believe that the industry is fully equipped to regulate itself and alter its marketing practices to correct these problems. What I am less certain of is whether the industry has the proper motivation to correct its past wrongs. It should make every effort to do so, because if Congress does not see dramatic changes in the way these industries market their products, I have no doubt that we will be back to address some of these issues legislatively. I hope we don't have to do that. I believe that there are serious First Amendment issues that we would have to consider if we felt the need to legislate in this area. But make no mistake. I will join my colleagues in considering legislation if I don't see the entertainment industry taking steps to correct itself Whether we ultimately legislate in this area or not, each of us must recognize that this hearing and this issue should not close the book on our discussions of children and violence. As I said earlier, I do not believe that violent entertainment is the sole cause of violence in our schools or elsewhere. No matter how much violence our children are exposed to in the media, they won't go on shooting rampages if they don't have access to guns. I'm not going to get into the entire gun debate here, but I do want to address one legislative effort that I have been working on, along with my good friend Senator DeWine. We introduced legislation that will set minimum standards for gun safety locks. The legislation would not mandate that the locks be used, but would provide yet another tool for parents who want to protect their children and limit their access to firearms. Mr. Chairman, a gun lock will only keep a gun out of a child's hands if the lock works. There are many cheap, flimsy locks on the market that are easily overcome by a child. The legislation Senator DeWine and I introduced gives authority to the Consumer Product Safety Commission to set minimum regulations for safety locks and to remove unsafe locks from the market. Our legislation empowers consumers by ensuring that they will only purchase high-quality lock boxes and trigger locks. I hope this Committee will hold hearings on this legislation, because I believe that Senators will see that it is a simple way to make sure guns are stored safely. The gun safety lock legislation won't prevent every tragic shooting. Likewise, limiting the marketing of violent entertainment is not the whole answer. But both are important pieces of the bigger picture, and both can help parents make better decisions for the well being of their children. Thank you Mr. Chairman. I look forward to hearing from the witnesses. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Kerry. Senator Frist. STATEMENT OF HON. BILL FRIST, U.S. SENATOR FROM TENNESSEE Senator Frist. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, thanks for convening this important hearing. I say this as a father of a 17-year-old, a 14-year-old, a 13-year-old, who tries to be a good parent, they spend 8 hours in school a day, they all play sports, but in addition they will collectively go to at least 50 movies this year. They will see, in spite of all their other activities, probably 500 hours of television collectively, and probably listen to over 1,000 hours of music collectively together, in spite of trying to be a good parent, being at all their school functions, and them being very active. Thus, I am very concerned, and I am delighted we are holding this hearing, and delighted with the FTC report and what has come forth. You know, we are not talking about the slapstick of years past, or the Roadrunner throwing an animal again at the Coyote. Much of what my three boys are exposed to on television, in music, and in the movies is simply vulgar and violent. It is different than it was in the past, and culture may be a little bit different, but it is totally unacceptable because of the impressions that it leaves that I am absolutely convinced will affect them as individuals, their emotional life, their spiritual life, their happiness, their degree of fulfillment in the future. Congress has repeatedly gone, as so many people have said, to the entertainment industry in the past threatening Federal regulation, only to be reassured again and again by the industry that voluntary standards can be imposed, that self- regulation is the answer. If we look back at the history of voluntary standards, which we will hear about, 1950 to 1952 to 1983, that were promulgated by the National Association of Broadcasters, you see things, and I quote, like, ``in selecting subjects and themes, great care must be exercised to be sure that treatment and presentation are made in good faith and not for the purpose of sensationalism or to shock or exploit the audience or appeal to prurient interest or morbid curiosity.'' Or, in another quotation the standards were, ``violence, physical or psychological, may only be projected in responsibly handled contexts, not used exploitatively.'' Regardless of how culture is changing, standards similar to this, at least as a parent, as a responsible citizen today I would endorse. Regrettably, it is impossible--next to impossible--to find programs that even loosely comply with these standards today. Are these standards arcane, are they out of date, are they not in touch with the times, are they too traditional? Obviously, I say no, because as a parent, taking my children to the movies and participating with them I see what this world has come to in terms of the presentation. Research from the Kaiser Foundation finds that more than 75 percent of the programming in the 8:00 to 9:00 p.m. family hour now contain, and I quote, sexually related talk or behavior, period, close quotation, and that is in the family hour. That represents, say, a fourfold increase from 1976. Mr. Chairman, let me just close by reading the first six sentences of the lead editorial in The Washington Post today, which captures, I believe, what this hearing needs to be about, and what our concern as United States Senators should be about. Again, this is from September 13 lead editorial, The Washington Post. ``When it comes to children, movies, and violence, it has always been hard to tell whether the H stands for Hollywood or hypocrisy. You have the studios and recording studios piously invoking their cultural integrity and First Amendment rights as they peddle stuff with no discernible redeeming virtues. You have the movie theater chains pretending they cannot control the teens who buy tickets to PG-rated films at the Multiplex, and then stroll in to watch R-rated movies, and you have the politicians like Al Gore, whose sensibilities on the matter seem to depend on whether the day is devoted primarily to soliciting money from the moguls or votes from everyone else.'' The last sentence in this first paragraph, and then I will close: ``Now, the Federal Trade Commission has added a useful new chapter to its tale of twofacedness.'' I am delighted that they issued this report, and look forward to exploring it with them further. The Chairman. Senator Inouye. STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE, U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII Senator Inouye. Mr. Chairman, listening to my colleagues, I am obviously angered by what I have heard, but we are here to listen and to learn, and I hope that we will not make judgments too early. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Inouye. I hope our colleagues will follow your example. Senator Abraham. STATEMENT OF HON. SPENCER ABRAHAM, U.S. SENATOR FROM MICHIGAN Senator Abraham. Gee, what bad timing for me. [Laughter.] Senator Abraham. Mr. Chairman, in deference to your wish to move forward, I will submit my full statement for the record. * I will just make two observations. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- * The information referred to was not available at the time this hearing went to press. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- First, I, along with several other Members of this Committee, have very young children. Ours are actually twins who are 7, and a 4-year-old, and so to some extent what we are here today to talk about is sort of just over the horizon for our family, but it is close enough to the horizon for us to be just as concerned as every other parent is about what to do, and while certainly I think that what the FTC has done helps us to focus very effectively on one part of the problem, I think we all recognize that as parents we have a responsibility, and as leaders we have a responsibility, to speak out and to become much more engaged. The problem is, I can do everything possible to address the problem in my own home, but my children want to go visit their friends, and their friends have older siblings who maybe already own some of these recordings, or have been marketed to, and I cannot monitor that, even though I am doing the best job possible. My wife and I are at least trying to do the best job possible, and it concerns me a lot. One of the things though, that does affect us, and it is a concern not so specifically addressed by the FTC report, is the fact that there has been such a dramatic increase in the violence that is presented in animated television programs and movies. Incredibly enough, the recent study by Harvard School of Public Health indicates there has been about a 50-percent increase in the violence contained and the mayhem contained in cartoons since the release of Snow White in 1937, and that is a pattern that pervades even the kind of programming that we think is designed for children our children's age. I am concerned about that as well, and I hope that as we move forward we can investigate that a little bit more fully, Mr. Chairman. I certainly intend to speak out against it, and I intend to address it more directly. In fact, I will be sending a letter today to the executives of the companies who are engaged in the presentation of these kinds of programmings and movies, because I think they really do need to hear from us on that level as well. Mr. Chairman, thanks for doing this, and I congratulate you for the hearing. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Abraham. Senator Dorgan. STATEMENT OF HON. BYRON L. DORGAN, U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH DAKOTA Senator Dorgan. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. First let me say this is not about partisan politics, certainly, and it is not also about censorship. This report, I think, is a constructive piece of evidence that there is targeting of violence and vulgarity to our children, and let me just read a sentence. The documents show that 35 of 44 R-rated movies studied by the Commission, 80 percent of them, were targeted to children under 17 years of age. That is what this is about. Now, Senator Kerry mentioned something I think important. It is true that art is on the cutting edge of culture, and it has been very important and will be very important. I also liked Elvis. Of course, Elvis did not sing the lyrics of Limp Bizkit, and probably would not have been allowed to, and probably should not be allowed to today if he is around some place. [Laughter.] Senator Dorgan. But the targeting of vulgar material, inappropriate material in CD's and records, the targeting of violence to 12-year-olds, 14- and 15-year-old kids is wrong, just wrong, and this report shows that it is being done systematically. Now, we ought to be able to entertain adults in America without injuring children. That is the issue. Again, it is not about censorship. I introduced the first V-chip bill in the Congress as a companion to the V-chip bill Congressman Markey offered in the House. I have been concerned about these things for a long time. I have got a couple of young children, and I am concerned about wanting to be a good parent in the face of all of these influences, but let me just, Mr. Chairman, finally say this. You are inviting people to come here and testify 2 weeks from now. I would encourage you to ask those who are profiting from some of these lyrics Mr. Brownback just discussed to read the lyrics to this Committee and tell us whether they are proud of the product they are profiting from, especially if they are targeting that product to our children. I think it might be an interesting thing to see whether they would want to read those lyrics to the Senate Commerce Committee. The Chairman. Excellent idea, Senator Dorgan. Senator Ashcroft. STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN ASHCROFT, U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSOURI Senator Ashcroft. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for holding this hearing. I particularly want to associate myself with the remarks of Mr. Dorgan. I think those are very well taken, and I want to thank Senator Brownback for his long-time and longstanding interest in these issues, and for having been a catalyst in the achievement of items like today's hearing and the Federal Trade Commission report that confirms something that parents have long feared and suspected. Many media companies in the entertainment industry are routinely--that is, routinely--marketing to children, and movies, music, and games are being marketed. They are so violent that children are never supposed to be allowed to watch them in the first place. I think the FTC report is an indictment of the entertainment industry for reckless endangerment of children. The report says violent video games are marketed to children as young as age 6, and the fact was just mentioned by Senator Dorgan, advertising for 80 percent of R-rated movies and 70 percent of video games targeted to children under 17. One marketing plan for a violent R-rated over-17 age film stated, quote, our goal was to find the elusive teen target audience and to make sure everyone between the ages of 12 through 18 was exposed to the film. Hollywood targets young children because of money. The FTC confirms too many retailers make no real effort to restrict children's access to violent content. According to the FTC, half of all theaters where R-rated movies are shown admit children as young as 13, and 85 percent of children age 13 to 16 who attempt to buy mature rated music and electronic games are able to complete the purchase--85 percent. It is disgraceful, targeting violent games to 6-year-old kids, selling R-rated movie tickets to 13-year-olds, writing marketing plans to expose violent R-rated films to every teenager under 17. There are leaders in the industry who want America to lose its values, want children to lose their innocence, want to pursue profits at the expense of principle. That is why parents now call Hollywood by its, perhaps rightful name, Hollyweird. As a culture, we are playing with fire. Entertaining children with graphic mayhem, murder, corrodes children's minds. To those who think otherwise, listen to what the FTC says, and I am quoting. The Commission's literature review reveals that a majority of the investigations into the impact of media violence on children find that, and I am still quoting, there is a high correlation between exposure to media violence and aggressive and at times violent behavior. In addition, a number of research efforts report that--and I am still quoting--exposure to media violence is correlated with increased acceptance of violent behavior in others, as well as an exaggerated perception of the amount of violence in the society, close quote. In its defense, the entertainment industry wraps itself in a constitutional right of free speech, but responsibilities accompany rights. The FTC calls on the entertainment industry for better self-regulation. That is the first step, the right first step to take, but more could be done. R-rated products should not be sold or marketed to children. Parents should monitor diligently and control what their children watch. Entertainment leaders should produce products suitable for their own children. Broadcasters should reduce violence aired during early evenings, when children are watching, and if the industry does not police itself and young children continue to be targets of violent promotional material, then Government should target the industry with false and deceptive---- The Chairman. Senator Ashcroft, your time has expired. I thank you. Senator Breaux. STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN B. BREAUX, U.S. SENATOR FROM LOUISIANA Senator Breaux. Mr. Chairman, thank you for convening these hearings, and also thank the patience of our colleagues who have been sitting out there listening to us. It seems to me the problem that has been identified by the FTC, which did the study at the request of President Clinton, is really not that complicated. It seems to me the problem is that the marketing department of the various industries did not get the memo from the executives of the industry that rated their own products, which clearly said that these products are not fit for a certain class of people. If the marketing department got the memo, they did not read it, or if they read it, they did not follow it. I think the question for this Committee, then, is, what is the appropriate role for Congress to help ensure that the marketing departments follow their own company's recommendations on the products that they have produced. Is there a legitimate role for Congress to be involved to ensure that they follow what their own companies have already previously concluded. The second concern I think is one that is really a larger concern. We have helped parents have tools to ensure that their own children are protected. V-chips and rating systems were intended to give parents the tools to protect their children. The real question is, are parents using those tools, and the information I have is that as much as 90 percent of the children tell us that their parents have never discussed the ratings with them, or 3 percent say, well, we have a V-chip and we use it, meaning 97 percent do not. How does Congress address that problem? So the issues are out there. I hope the hearings will help us resolve the problems. Thank you. The Chairman. Senator Rockefeller. STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER, IV, U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA Senator Rockefeller. Chairman McCain, I think the points that John Breaux made are very important. I would differ in simply one respect, and that is, you never blame the marketing department. The buck always stops at the chief executive officer and the president, et cetera. Having said that, I understand what the Senator is saying. I find this whole thing really sad and deplorable. I mentioned we were having this hearing this morning to my 28-year-old daughter. She said, ``Have you heard about the video game where they do an electrocution, and you get to turn on the electricity and then get to watch the person die, and make the sounds that the person makes, I guess, when they die in the electric chair?'' But I do think the FTC report is an enormous contribution. I think the behavior of not just the industry but also those who merchandize the product, the theaters and the people who sell it; 85 percent are not denied. Young kids that come in are not denied these products. It is partly our fault that the Supreme Court has constantly ruled that we cannot get involved in these things, and freedom of speech is sacred in America, but on the other hand, so is what we are teaching our children. We talk about education. We spend money on education. States spend money on education, and this is in many ways more pervasive. Children spend a lot more time watching television and video games than they do in the classroom, so it is extremely serious. I think if the executives come back in 6 months not having acted and not having cleaned up their act, they will face a Commerce Committee and others that will be looking to do something to clear up this problem once and for all. This cannot happen in America. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Rockefeller. I want to thank our colleagues from both sides of the House and Senate, who have shown a great deal of patience. It is our practice on the Committee to go by seniority on both sides of the aisle. That sometimes matches the age of the witnesses, not always though, but I think it does in this case, and we would begin with the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, both chairmen, but we will begin with Senator Hatch. Senator Hatch, welcome back before the Committee. STATEMENT OF HON. ORRIN G. HATCH, U.S. SENATOR FROM UTAH Senator Hatch. Mr. Chairman, I am delighted to be before the Committee. I want to thank the Members of this Committee for the opportunity to testify on the marketing of violent entertainment to children. As the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the father of six and the grandfather of 19, and as an occasional song-writer, my interest in this issue is not just professional, but it is personal as well. The Commission should be commended for its work. This is not insignificant amount of work. Unfortunately, as disturbing as some of the findings may be, they are hardly surprising. It is hard to feign shock at the notion that children, particularly teenagers, are finding ways to see the movies they want to see, listen to the music they want to listen to, or want to hear and play the video games they want to play. Only someone who has not had the exasperating privilege of raising teenagers might be surprised to find that kids today are still as talented as they have always been in manipulating the loopholes and the gimmicks and the restrictions that are imposed on their behavior. What is disturbing is the degree to which some commercial enterprises are willing to go to facilitate the manipulation of the few rules that do exist. Just as disturbing is the fact that much of the violence found in our popular entertainment is directed against women. Despite historic, bipartisan legislation that Senator Joe Biden and I and others authored to help States battle violence against women, it is stunning how much modern music glorifies acts of violence, sexual and otherwise, against women. While the First Amendment may very well protect hateful content, we must not ignore the fact that violent, misogynistic music may ultimately affect the attitudes many young men have toward women. The recommendations of the Commission are constructive, but Federal regulation and election-year speeches are not the final answer. You cannot regulate decency or legislate taste. The real issue is far more fundamental. Let us be honest, any society such as ours, where the freedom of expression is guaranteed in the Constitution, must recognize the fact that currently is not in vogue, that with freedom there must be responsibility and accountability, otherwise we will always be downed and confined by those too ready to pander to the lowest common denominator. It would be so much easier if there were only one culprit, one group that we could blame for our current state of diminished mores and vacuous principles. Some want to blame Hollywood, but what in Hollywood are we targeting? Are we angry at those who gave us Saving Private Ryan, The Patriot, and Schindler's List, just to mention a few, or who produce television shows like Touched By An Angel, or Providence? We revel in these shows because they trumpet the very ideals we desperately seek in our own daily lives--the importance of courage, decency, honesty, conviction, and faith. What about the recording industry? Do we object to the music and lyrics of Gladys Knight or Larry Gatlin or David Foster, or do we only object to the work of those with whom we have no cultural or personal connection? As one who has written gospel music only to be told that it was unacceptable because of my religious faith, I have seen both sides of this debate on a personal level. Warning labels on CDs and video games do help, but for many teenagers the parental warning code really stands for, ``Buy this thing now.'' Some want to blame television stations for airing one show after another that portray inordinately beautiful people living in a violent, cynical, vapid society that fortunately is still alien to most of America, and I am not talking about the evening news. The networks counter by asking, how does one provide entertainment for both children and adults in a medium that is always available to both? What about the role of politicians, who seem to want to have it both ways? What kind of signal is being sent to the creative community when politicians have one hand clutched over their heart in righteous indignation over the prevalence of sex and violence in our nation's entertainment, and yet the other hand is wide open, palm up, in permanent solicitation of money and credibility from Hollywood's most glamorous? Does anyone believe that the same indignant speeches being made these last few days are also being given in the countless fundraisers in Los Angeles, Nashville, or New York? Clearly, there is no easy solution or balm that will miraculously solve this problem, but there are constructive steps we can all take to curtail our children's exposure to violence. It really is threefold. First, the entertainment industry must stop hiding behind the shibboleth of censorship, claiming any form of restraint or self-imposed, even self-imposed, is nothing more than a capitulation to the puritanical. Too often, the outrageous and shocking are little more than a cover-up for the lack of creativity and originality, but these artists will continue to flourish until the industry stops pretending that the permanent coarsening of entertainment is the only way to pay homage to the First Amendment. There is one constructive step that Congress can take. It is relatively simple, yet it could have a profound, positive influence by allowing the entertainment industry to begin making changes voluntarily. A very limited amendment to our antitrust laws would clarify that the respective industries can cooperate to develop and enforce responsible guidelines without any fear of liability under current antitrust laws. The Senate has unanimously adopted this amendment, but it has not passed through the Congress. We should pass it before we adjourn. Other industries in America recognize they have a responsibility for the cumulative consequences of their products that are being used. In Utah, we have reclaimed abandoned coal mines. Why can we not even acknowledge that there has been a mental and moral waste dump created from our overinfatuation with television, movies, and music? We place the entertainment industry on our country's highest pedestal. The time has come for them to exercise responsibility that should come with this honor. Second, we must recognize the responsibility---- The Chairman. Senator Hatch, would you speed it up? Senator Hatch. I will try if I can, Mr. Chairman. I would like to make these few points. We must recognize the responsibility parents have in the marketing of violence and sex to children. We all know how politically sensitive this subject is, but the simple fact is that parents still enjoy the single most powerful weapon in the battle over how their children are entertained. They still have the power to turn off the television and stop the movies, or unplug the CD player. It is hard to say no. Anyone who has had to weather the extended grounding of a teenager appreciates the difficulty involved. There are no immediate rewards, little support, and intense disapproval for censoring your own children, and you have to live with those you have offended the most, and then again, there is no reward for a parent other than the beauty of having a well-raised adult. Third, we have to acknowledge the importance of faith, and Mr. Chairman, if I could just take one more minute, I would appreciate it. A society needs a moral code to survive and flourish. A body of jointly shared principles against which to measure, restrain, and encourage conduct. For many of us, the source of these principles is our religion, which provides a comparable moral compass regardless of whether you attend a synagogue, a church, or a mosque, yet it is not politically correct to be religious or even morally accountable in public. We live in a time when we have devalued the right to pray, the miracle of birth, and the integrity of the marriage covenant. We live in a time when fame is not a product of achievement as much as it is the expected consequence of notoriety. I would put the rest of my remarks in the record, and I appreciate having been called to be in front of this august Committee today. I appreciate what you are doing, Mr. Chairman and other Members of this Committee, to try and elevate these issues to public discourse so we can all do something about them without having the heavy hand of government come in and force things on the creative people in our society. [The prepared statement of Senator Hatch follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Orrin G. Hatch, U.S. Senator From Utah Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify on the marketing of violent entertainment to children. As the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, as the father of six and grandfather of 19, and--as an occasional songwriter-- my interest in this issue is not just professional but also personal. The Commission should be commended for its work. Unfortunately, as disturbing as some of the findings may be, they are hardly surprising. It's hard to feign shock at the notion that children, particularly teenagers, are finding ways to see the movies they want to see, listen to the music they want to hear, and play the video games they want to play. Only someone who has not had the exasperating privilege of raising teenagers might be surprised to find that kids today are still as talented as they have always been in manipulating the loopholes and gimmicks in the restrictions that are imposed on their behavior. What is disturbing is the degree to which some commercial enterprises are willing to go to facilitate the manipulation of the few rules that do exist. Just as disturbing is the fact that much of the violence found in our popular entertainment is directed against women. Studies show that modern music lyrics, in particular, have become increasingly misogynistic. Hatred and violence against women are widespread and unmistakable in mainstream hip-hop and alternative music. Consider, for example, the singer Marilyn Manson, some of whose less vulgar lyrics include: ``Who says date rape isn't kind?''; ``Let's just kill everyone and let your god sort them out'': and ``The housewife I will beat, the pro-life I will kill.'' In 1999, I told this Committee about a new up and coming artist. His name? Eminem, the hip-hop artist featured frequently on MTV who wrote ``Bonnie and Clyde''--a song in which he described killing his child's mother and dumping her body into the ocean. Despite historic, bipartisan legislation Sen. Joe Biden and I authored to help states deal with violence against women, it is stunning how much modern music glorifies acts of violence, sexual and otherwise, against women. Many children are listening to this music. This music is marketed to our youth. It was argued at your 1999 hearing--and will probably be argued again today--that the fame and fortune of today's creators--be they hip-hop artists or movie directors--are the byproduct of a free market where consumers are free to choose. But this argument ignores that fact that these ``artists'' have been financially and personally embraced by industry. To be frank, these creators would not be as successful in the marketplace were it not for the power and effectiveness of Hollywood's production and marketing capabilities. If the findings of the FTC report do not convince you of the truth, then ask yourself the following: How does industry explain a 1998 Grammy nomination for Nine Inch Nails and a 1999 Grammy nomination for Marilyn Manson? How does CBS/Viacom explain MTV's decision to award Eminem ``Artist of the Year for 2000?'' It is one thing for industry to defend the constitutional rights of creators to express themselves. But it's quite another thing to expect society to tolerate the production and marketing of filth to young people for profit. While the First Amendment may very well protect hateful content, we must not ignore the fact that violent, misogynistic music may ultimately affect the behavior and attitudes of many young men toward women. The recommendations of the Commission are constructive, but federal regulation and election year speeches are not the final answer. You can't regulate decency or legislate taste. The real issue is far more fundamental. Let's be honest. Any society, such as ours, where the freedom of expression is guaranteed in the Constitution, must recognize a fact that currently is not in vogue--that with freedom there must also be responsibility and accountability. Otherwise, we will always be bound and confined by those too ready to pander to the lowest common denominator. It would be so much easier if there were only one culprit, one group that we could blame for our current state of diminished mores and vacuous principles. Some want to blame Hollywood, but what in Hollywood are we targeting?

But, the simple fact is that parents still enjoy the single most powerful weapon in the battle over how their children are entertained--the flick of the wrist--the ability to turn off the television, unplug the computer or CD player, and say no to a movie rental. A parent cannot protect their child in every instance, in every activity that occurs in school, but parental supervision can significantly control the content and quantity of what children watch. It is not hard to find out what television shows your teenage children are watching, what movies they are seeing, or what they are doing on the Internet. More often than not, they tend to be the very same shows, films and sites that are being watched by the parents. But it's hard to say no. Anyone who has had to weather the extended grounding of a teenager appreciates the difficulty involved. There are no immediate rewards, little support, and intense disapproval for censoring our own children. And, you have to live with those you have offended the most.
