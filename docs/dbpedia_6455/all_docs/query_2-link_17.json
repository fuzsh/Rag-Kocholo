        "text": "6\n\nThe Filmmakers\n\nBelow the Line: Cinematography, Production Design, Editing, and Scoring\n\nAbove the Line\n\nDespite consolidation by the majors, film production in the 1980s showed a healthy diversity. In part, this was due to the ancillary markets that voraciously demanded new product. But it was due as well to the robust energy of American film culture and the inherent requirements of film production.\n\nStudio executives aimed to rationalize their capital expenditures, and this impulse had considerable institutional support in the industry. Talent agencies took \"packages\" to the studios. These commanded a hefty fee, but they enabled studio executives to justify the decision to green-light a production. Market research also helped guide executive decision making, though the industry remained quite secretive about the extent to which it used such research. Film projects were concept tested before scripts were written, and scripts were subjected to focus group evaluation to predict audience responses to the hypothetical film. Based on this testing, scripts could undergo further revisions.1 If a script found its way into production, the resulting film might be subject, before release, to another round of market research, the results of which could dictate additional editing to revise characters, rework the ending, or drop scenes that elicited big negatives. The ending of Fatal Attraction (1982), for example, tested poorly with audiences, so an alternative, less subtle conclusion was shot in which the villainess died on screen in a grisly manner that test audiences found emotionally satisfying.\n\nMillions of dollars were at stake on a major production, yet predicting what an audience wanted to see was maddeningly difficult, especially with a time lag of one or more years between the onset of a production and the release of a finished picture. For these reasons, packaging, market research, and other decision-making props assumed a major institutional presence in the industry. Yet filmmaking remained an elusive enterprise, resisting the efforts of production and marketing executives to predetermine its variables. Films still had to be created. They were not paint-by-number exercises, and therefore, filmmakers commanded significant freedoms to devise shots, tell stories, and present characters. The imperative for the front office to allocate resources on the basis of predictable outcomes was, and always would be, in tension with the vagaries of the creative process. The front office needed talent, literally banked on it, but also had to let it alone to do its work. This made for many unhappy marriages but also for solid successes, and it helps explain why so much diversity existed in the productions of the 1980s or in any decade. The industry was large enough that filmmakers could work at varying degrees of proximity to the major studio-distributors, with correspondingly greater or lesser pressures to be accountable to the box office.\n\nThis latter characteristic helps explain why the so-called epoch of the blockbuster was actually less influential on filmmaking across the board than is popularly supposed. The high-tech, high-gloss, high-concept style of filmmaking (e.g., Return of the Jedi [1983], Top Gun [1986]) attracted a great deal of media coverage, with hypotheses that this style was taking over Hollywood in the eighties. Certainly there were filmmakers whose careers flourished because of their savvy commercial sense and whose films often seemed definable in these terms. These included Adrian Lyne (Flashdance [1983], 9½ Weeks [1986], Fatal Attraction [1987]), Ron Howard (Splash [1984], Cocoon [1985], Parenthood [1989]), and Rob Reiner (This Is Spinal Tap [1984], Stand by Me [1986], The Princess Bride [1987], When Harry Met Sally [1989]). But the influence was less far-reaching than the publicity generated by these films implied. Furthermore, the industry's productions were eclectic, and it will be helpful here to show some of this variety in reference to filmmakers who do not receive extended profiles later in the chapter. Blake Edwards, for example, maintained a steady output during the period, and his films were resolutely antithetical to blockbuster style. The editing rhthms of Edwards's pictures established a slow, contemplative pacing, in which character development unfolded in all of its subtleties and in which pauses, longeurs—what comes between the dialogue—counted for so much. S.O.B. (1981) was an acidic portrait of the film industry and featured the late, great William Holden's final performance. Victor/Victoria (1982) was a sophisticated comedy about the politics of gender and sexual preference. That's Life (1986) was a mellow, introspective portrait of an aging man's assessment of his life and family. With many of Edwards's family members in the cast, it amounted to a personal and revealing self-portrait. Bereft of his collaborator, the late actor Peter Sellers, Edwards tried to keep the Pink Panther series going, but with poor results. Without Sellers's brilliant portrait of the bumbling Inspector Clouseau, Trail of the Pink Panther (1982) and Curse of the Pink Panther (1983) came off poorly. But The Man Who Loved Women (1983), Micki and Maude (1984), A Fine Mess (1986), Blind Date (1987), Sunset (1988), and Skin Deep (1989) demonstrated Edwards's gift for creating a sophisticated blend of sight gags, slapstick, and dialogue-based comedy. Furthermore, Edwards consistently shot his films in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, making him, along with John Carpenter, one of the widescreen format's most consistent and skillful practitioners.\n\nMany other filmmakers elaborated stylized pictures removed from the standard industry templates. Jonathan Demme, for example, made an eclectic group of films that by decade's end had moved toward the mainstream. Melvin and Howard (1980) was an incisive, low-key character piece about millionaire Howard Hughes and Melvin Dummar, an ordinary guy to whom Hughes allegedly bequeathed a fortune. Stop Making Sense (1984) and Swimming to Cambodia (1987) recorded performances by, respectively, the band Talking Heads and monologuist Spalding Gray. Something Wild (1986) changed gears unexpectedly on its audience, shifting from an endearing comedy about a straitlaced businessman (Jeff Daniels) and a kooky woman (Melanie Griffith) to graphically violent melodrama. Married to the Mob (1988) was an attempt at mainstream comedy in a story about a gangland moll (Michelle Pfeiffer) on the run from the Mafia. Demme ended the decade at work on the singularly grim and unpleasant Silence of the Lambs (1990), a violent look at serial killers that, for all its bleakness, enjoyed the biggest audience success of his career.\n\nJohn Huston alternated formulaic efforts (Victory [1981], Annie [1982]) with more personal, unusual projects. Under the Volcano (1984) was a finely textured and atmospheric portrait of a drunken diplomat's self-destruction in Mexico on the eve of World War II. Albert Finney's magnificent performance and Huston's eye for Mexico combined to etch a memorably tragic vision of the squalid way stations visited by the diplomat on his way to a hell freely chosen. Prizzi's Honor (1985) was a droll portrait of gangland assassins (Jack Nicholson and Kathleen Turner) who fall for each other, and The Dead (1987), Huston's last film, was a luminous adaptation of the James Joyce short story about loss and aging in the context of a dinner party at turn of the century.\n\nPhilip Kaufman defined his own filmmaking territory with a pair of unusual productions. The Right Stuff (1983) could have been a standard-issue glory fest about the early days of the NASA space program, but Kaufman turned it instead into a quirky, episodic, and unexpectedly comic film whose style and rhythms remained creatively offbeat. Adapted from the Milan Kundera novel about a Czech doctor and the two women he loves, The Unbearable Lightness of Being (1988) played more like a foreign art film than a Hollywood production. With cinematography by longtime Ingmar Bergman collaborator Sven Nykvist and with a cast including Juliet Binoche, Lena Olin, and Daniel Day-Lewis, the film's leisurely three-hour pace, character-centered drama, and political subtext were characteristics perhaps more typical of European productions than American ones. As with The Right Stuff and the Tom Wolfe novel on which it was based, Kaufman directed a sterling adaptation of a notoriously difficult book. Continuing this string of unusual and thoughtful films, Kaufman ended the decade filming a lush, intelligent, and sensual account of writer Henry Miller's Paris sojourn in the twenties. When released, Henry and June (1990) was the first film to carry the industry's new NC-17 rating, designating it as having nonpornographic, sexually adult content.\n\nDirectors Norman Jewison (Best Friends [1982], A Soldier's Story [1984], Agnes of God [1985], Moonstruck [1987], In Country [1989]), Alan Parker (Fame [1980], Pink Floyd—The Wall [1982], Shoot the Moon Birdy [1984], Angel Heart [1987], Mississippi Burning [1988]), and Bruce Beresford (Tender Mercies [1983], Crimes of the Heart [1986], Driving Miss Daisy [1989]) specialized in a diverse range of film topics and characters, including projects with clear commercial potential (Moonstruck, Driving Miss Daisy) and those targeted for smaller audiences (Birdy, Tender Mercies). After making two science fiction classics—Alien (1979) and Blade Runner (1982)—Ridley Scott turned his talents for visual design to a series of different productions: Legend (1986), an Arthurian adventure; Someone to Watch over Me (1987), a contemporary romantic thriller; and Black Rain (1989), a crime drama set in Japan and which made explicit the Japanophobia that was latent in Blade Runner. These other pictures were unbalanced by their bravura production design and cinematography. While they were handsome to look at, their narratives were insufficiently developed. This was especially apparent in Someone to Watch over Me, a picture with a formulaic storyline overlaid by glossy visuals. Scott's Blade Runner created an enduring template for subsequent science fiction (more on this later), but his other films fell short of the classic status that that picture has attained.\n\nPostulating a profound influence by blockbuster filmmaking requires that one minimize the variety of production that actually prevailed. This chapter aims to emphasize that variety, and if the result is a less linear or teleological aesthetic history of the period, I believe that accords well with the industry's output. By contrast with this one, however, chapters 7 and 8 furnish a more topological account. There I cover the aesthetic and social patterns that emerged in eighties filmmaking and the ways in which segments of the moviegoing public responded. The aesthetic history of eighties filmmaking was formed from the tensions created between these centripetal and centrifugal forces. In the present chapter, I begin by considering key filmmakers in \"below the line\" departments. I then examine those above the line (directors and producers). \"Above\" and \"below the line\" are terms used by the industry in factoring production costs. \"Above the line\" designates those expenses incurred during production by the principal talent: director, producer, star, writer. \"Below the line\" designates those costs incurred during production in all other capacities.\n\nBelow the Line: Cinematography, Production Design, Editing, and Scoring\n\nFilmmaking is a collaborative act, and a film's aesthetic design results from the creative input of a range of production personnel. The director typically has the ultimate creative authority, and other members of the production team understand that their task is to help the director realize his or her vision for the project. In practice, though, directors rely on the vital contributions from crew members in areas that have direct bearing on the way a film is going to look and sound. So important are these areas that many directors maintain enduring relationships with individual cinematographers, production designers, editors, or composers, and the artists who excell in these areas can exert tremendous influence over the look and feel of the finished film. Furthermore, front-rank artists in these departments are highly prized by the industry and may establish thriving careers on an international level. In this section of the chapter, I examine American film from the standpoint of these \"below the line\" production personnel, noting their important and enduring collaborative relationships with individual directors.\n\nDemonstrating the globalization of film culture, a group of elite cinematographers collaborated with directors in multiple national film industries, European as well as Hollywood. Nestor Almendros shot French director Francois Truffaut's The Last Metro (1980) and Eric Rohmer's Pauline at the Beach (1983) collaborated with Hollywood directors Robert Benton, Mike Nichols, and Martin Scorsese on, respectively, Places in the Heart (1984), Heartburn (1986) and New York Stories (1989). After shooting a number of Wim Wenders's films in the seventies, Robby Muller worked for Peter Bogdanovich on They All Laughed (1981), Jim Jarmusch (Down by Law [1986], Mystery Train [1989]), Wenders again (Paris, Texas [1984]), William Friedkin (To Live and Die in L.A. [1985]) and John Schlesinger (The Believers [1987]). Sven Nykvist shot Bergman's last films in the eighties (After the Rehearsal [1983], Fanny and Alexander [1983]) and, in Hollywood, Paul Mazursky's Willie and Phil (1980), Bob Rafelson's The Postman Always Rings Twice (1981), Bob Fosse's Star 80, and Philip Kaufman's The Unbearable Lightness of Being (1988). Dante Spinotti maintained a prolific career shooting Italian films and such Hollywood features as Crimes of the Heart (1986), Manhunter (1986), and Beaches (1988). Vittorio Storaro continued his long collaboration with Bernardo Bertolucci (The Last Emperor [1987]) and his more recent partnership with Francis Coppola (One from the Heart [1982], Tucker: The Man and His Dream [1988], New York Stories [1989]). The relationships maintained by these cinematographers demonstrated the international scope of the contemporary Hollywood industry and its ability to attract top talents from overseas.\n\nHollywood's own cinematographers created outstanding and memorable visual designs for the period's films. John Alonzo captured superlative and beautiful landscapes for Tom Horn (1980) and employed strikingly garish colors to suggest the vulgarity and frenzy of the Miami drug trade in Scarface (1983). Michael Chapman's versatility carried him from the stark black-and-white of Scorsese's Raging Bull (1980) to Gothic horror (The Lost Boys [1987]), physical action (Shoot to Kill [1988]) and high-budget, effects-based work (Ghostbusters II [1989]). Freddie Francis excelled at period work in The French Lieutenant's Woman (1981) and Glory (1989). David Watkin's camerawork was extraordinarily subtle in literate, character-centered dramas and comedy (Out of Africa [1985], Moonstruck [1987]). Laszlo Kovacs had been closely identified with key counterculture and new wave films of the sixties and seventies (Easy Rider [1969], Five Easy Pieces [1970]), and he worked prolifically in the eighties on an eclectic group of mainly middle-of-the-road pictures: Heart Beat (1980), The Toy (1982), Ghostbusters (1984), Mask (1985), Legal Eagles (1986). Only Frances (1982), a portrait of the tortured life of Hollywood actress Frances Farmer, harked back to Kovacs's celebrated rebel pictures. Haskell Wexler sustained his unusual career mix of mainstream commercial projects (The Man Who Loved Women [1983], Blaze [1989], Three Fugitives [1989]) and left-wing political films (No Nukes [1980], Latino [1985], Matewan [1987]). Zilmos Zsigmond, one of the industry's most brilliant cinematographers, had the misfortune to do some of his best work in two films that bookended the decade as examples of industry waste: Heaven's Gate (1980) and The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990).\n\nStrong directors developed a recognizable style across their films in large part through their ongoing collaborations with individual cinematographers. John Bailey's work served the literate, dialogue-driven filmmaking of Lawrence Kasdan (The Big Chill [1983], Silverado [1985], The Accidental Tourist [1988]) as well the more aggressively visual filmmaking of Paul Schrader (Cat People [1982], Mishima [1985], Light of Day [1987]). After shooting several films in Germany for Rainer Werner Fassbinder, a director not noted for elaborate visual choreography, Michael Ballhaus began a close collaboration with Martin Scorsese (After Hours [1985], The Color of Money [1986], The Last Temptation of Christ [1988]), permitting him to execute florid camera moves and the complex lighting designs they required. Director Sidney Lumet appreciated Andrzej Bartkowiak's ability to shoot fast and employ lenses, lighting, and color for symbolically expressive effects in Prince of the City (1981), Deathtrap (1982), The Verdict (1982), Daniel (1983), Garbo Talks (1984), The Morning After (1986), Power and Family Business (1989). Brian De Palma relied on Stephen Burum to create a flamboyant visual style for Body Double (1984), The Untouchables (1987), and Casualties of War (1989), and Burum created memorably expressionistic images for Francis Coppola on Rumble Fish (1983). Ernest Dickerson's fluid camera and insistent color designs helped give Spike Lee's work (She's Gotta Have It [1986], School Daze [1988], Do the Right Thing [1989]) its memorably visual qualities in the latter part of the decade, when Lee appeared as the precursor of a new wave of black filmmakers. In the eighties, when Jonathan Demme moved up from the exploitation films he made for Roger Corman's New World International, he took cinematographer Tak Fujimoto with him to create Melvin and Howard (1980), Swing Shift (1983), Something Wild (1986), and Married to the Mob (1988). Chris Menges's work for Roland Joffe gave historical tragedy physical presence and emotional resonance in The Killing Fields (1984) and The Mission (1986). In more historically oriented productions, Robert Richardson's partnership with Oliver Stone yielded some of the decade's political classics: Salvador (1986), Platoon (1986), Wall Street (1987), Talk Radio (1988), and Born on the Fourth of July (1989).\n\nBruce Surtees was essential to Clint Eastwood's filmmaking throughout the decade, with Firefox (1982), Honky Tonk Man (1982), Sudden Impact (1983), Tightrope (1984), and Pale Rider (1985). Outside his Eastwood films, Surtees shot two of the decade's most popular pictures, Risky Business (1983) and Beverly Hills Cop (1984). Blake Edwards relied on Harry Stradling for much of his eighties widescreen work: S.O.B. (1981), Micki and Maude (1984), A Fine Mess (1986), and Blind Date (1987). In his collaborations with John Carpenter, Dean Cundey did some of the decade's best widescreen filming, on Escape from New York (1981), The Fog (1981), The Thing (1982), and Big Trouble in Little China (1986), his subsequent association with Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future [1985], Who Framed Roger Rabbit [1988], Back to the Future Parts II and III [1989, 1990]) lifted him out of low-budget horror and into the industry's expensive, state-of-the-art productions. On those films that he directed, Spielberg maintained a long relationship with Allen Daviau (E.T. [1982], Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983), The Color Purple [1985], Empire of the Sun [1987]) and Douglas Slocombe (Raiders of the Lost Ark [1981], Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom [1984], Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade [1989]).\n\nWoody Allen's filmmaking had always been extremely literate, with its foundation in solid screenplays penned by Allen. When he began to collaborate with cinematographers renowned for their magisterial control of light, however, his work became truly cinematic, with visual designs as fully articulated as the work's verbal dimensions had been. Allen learned about light from three extraordinary collaborators: Gordon Willis (Stardust Memories [1980], A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy [1982], Broadway Danny Rose [1983], Zelig [1983], The Purple Rose of Cairo [1985]); Carlo Di Palma (Hannah and Her Sisters [1986], Radio Days [1987], September [1987]); and Sven Nykvist (Another Woman [1988], Crimes and Misdemeanors [1989]).\n\nSeveral prominent directors of the nineties first established careers as cinematographers in the eighties. Barry Sonnenfeld, director of The Addams Family (1991) and Men in Black (1997), worked closely as cinematographer for Joel and Ethan Coen (Blood Simple [1984], Raising Arizona [1987], Miller's Crossing [1990]) and Rob Reiner (When Harry Met Sally [1989], Misery [1990]). The action-oriented director of Speed (1994) and Twister (1996) Jan De Bont first worked as a cinematographer with surprising versatility: The Jewel of the Nile (1985), Jumpin' Jack Flash (1986), Ruthless People (1986), Die Hard (1988), Bert Rigby, You're a Fool (1989), and Black Rain (1989).\n\nThe production designer is a key collaborator with the director and cinematographer because the work in these areas intersects and overlaps. The colors employed on a film's sets, for example, will have consequences for how those sets are lit and shot, and decisions about camera placement will affect how a set should be dressed. Production design refers to the visual organization of a film's physical environments, whether they be real locations or artificial creations on a sound stage. Much filmmaking in the eighties afforded production designers elaborate opportunities to create intricate and expansive visions of past and future in the disparate modes of fantasy and historical realism. Production design in these films was often the dominant element of mise-en-scène, and the designers who excelled at conjuring these visions were responsible for some of the decade's memorable and enduring imagery. Legendary production designer Ken Adam (Dr. Strangelove [1964], Goldfinger [1964], Barry Lyndon [1975]) provided imaginatively stylized sets for one of the decade's most unusual films, Pennies from Heaven (1981), contrasting the bleakness of Depression-era America with the cheery opulence of that period's Hollywood musicals. Dante Ferretti, who constructed elaborate fantasies for Pier Paolo Pasolini (The Decameron [1971]) and Federico Fellini (Orchestra Rehearsal [1979]), designed for Terry Gilliam's The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1989) a pseudo-historical magic kingdom that contained some of the period's most elaborate and outlandish sets in a fantastical portrait of nineteenth-century Germany. Ferdinando Scarfiotti's memorable work for Bernardo Bertolucci in the seventies (The Conformist [1971], Last Tango in Paris [1973]) gave him the international prominence that led to Hollywood productions and some of the decade's most stylized design in Flash Gordon (1980), Cat People (1982), and, again for Bertolucci, The Last Emperor (1987). Richard Sylbert's brilliant work on Chinatown (1974) was among the best of that decade, and while no comparable classic beckoned him in the eighties, he nevertheless did very strong work establishing historical periods on Reds (1981), Frances (1982), and The Cotton Club (1984). Patrizia von Brandenstein also excelled at period design, with an emphasis on opulence, in Ragtime (1981), Amadeus (1984), and The Untouchables (1987), though her work also included more austere and gritty projects (Silkwood [1983], No Mercy [1987]). Bo Welch's elaborate fantasy showpieces were integral to the mise-en-scène of The Lost Boys (1987), Beetlejuice (1988), and Ghostbusters II (1989), and, though he did not practice this as often, he also excelled at subdued naturalism (The Accidental Tourist [1988]). Anton Furst's Gotham City—dark, dank, oppressive—established an unforgettable mise-en-scène for Batman (1989) and dominated that picture's visual design. The most influential production design of the eighties, however, was Lawrence G. Paull's work on the science fiction classic Blade Runner (1982), offering a ghetto environment of crumbling buildings and urban squalor coexisting with architectural opulence and high-tech modes of transport. It established a template of the futurist megalopolis that endured on screen for the next fifteen years, until director Luc Besson, cinematographer Thierry Arbogas, and production designer Dan Weil on The Fifth Element (1997) felt compelled to break with it and offer an antithetical vision.\n\nAs they did with cinematographers, many prominent directors maintained continuing collaborations with production designers. Dean Tavoularis's brilliant work was essential for Francis Coppola's efforts to break with realism and substitute stage-bound expressionism on Hammett (1982, Coppola producing), One From the Heart (1982), and Rumble Fish (1983). Tavoularis's other Coppola collaborations were more subdued and included The Outsiders (1983), Peggy Sue Got Married (1986), Gardens of Stone (1987), Tucker (1988) and New York Stories. Steven Spielberg and George Lucas found Norman Reynolds's affectionately retro designs indispensible for The Empire Strikes Back (1980), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Return of the Jedi (1983), and Empire of the Sun (1987). Mel Bourne, who provided Woody Allen with a versatile array of locales for the disparate Stardust Memories, A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy, Broadway Danny Rose, and Zelig, was succeeded by Stuart Wurtzel (The Purple Rose of Cairo, Hannah and Her Sisters) and Santo Loquasto (Radio Days, Another Woman, September, Crimes and Misdemeanors, New York Stories). Pato Guzman regularly collaborated with Paul Mazursky, producing designs for Willie and Phil (1980), Tempest (1982), Moscow on the Hudson (1984), Down and Out in Beverly Hills (1986), and Moon over Parador (1988). Rodger Maus was Blake Edwards's preferred designer (S.O.B., Victor/Victoria, The Man Who Loved Women, Micki and Maude, A Fine Mess, Blind Date, Sunset). Sidney Lumet relied on Philip Rosenberg for Daniel, Garbo Talks, Running on Empty, and Family Business. Bruno Rubeo made politics concrete in the memorable locales and sets he designed for Oliver Stone on Salvador, Platoon, Talk Radio, and Born on the Fourth of July. In the seventies, Polly Platt regularly collaborated with Peter Bogdanovich, and his relative inactivity in the eighties led her to a more diverse range of productions: The Man with Two Brains (1983), Terms of Endearment (1983), and The Witches of Eastwick (1987).\n\nBill Kenney's work for Sylvester Stallone (Rambo [1985], Rocky IV [1985], Rambo III [1988]) established him as a premier visual stylist for action blockbusters, while his designs for Lawrence Kasdan on Body Heat conveyed that film's intricate thematic motifs with much subtlety. Especially memorable was the design Kenny created for Matty's \"lair,\" a balcony festooned with wind chimes that audibly conveyed the story's undercurrents of desire and menace. Wynn Thomas's transformation of a Brooklyn city block (strategically without trees that would offer shade) and selective application of color (red) enabled Spike Lee to convey the heat of oppressive weather and smoldering racial tension so palpably in Do the Right Thing (1989).\n\nThe decade also saw outstanding and significant work by the industry's film editors. Like production design, editing is a supremely important production component about which the general moviegoing public knows little. Editors are hardly household names in the way that some directors are, yet it is the editor's work that gives rhythm and pace to the film, provides narrative structure, and shapes and crafts many aspects of an actor's performance. The singular achievements of the decade's filmmaking were often a function of the editor's work. Nino Baragli surpassed even his customary brilliance with his editing of Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in America (1984), creating a kaleidoscopic narrative that juggled multiple time frames with astonishingly fluid transitions. John Bloom surmounted the daunting challenge of telling a story backward in Betrayal (1983), starting with the ending and working toward the beginning, and he made the shots work using this peculiar time scheme. Bloom also provided one of the decade's best examples of editing for tight narrative effect in Under Fire (1983), an extremely well cut film. Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's regular editor, provided edgy rhythms and lightning fast transitions in Raging Bull, The King of Comedy, After Hours, The Color of Money, and The Last Temptation of Christ.\n\nDede Allen had given Arthur Penn's work (Bonnie and Clyde [1967], Night Moves [1975]) its peculiarly off-kilter rhythms. While she found no comparable projects for her unusually angled shot transitions in the eighties, her work on Reds (1981) and The Milagro Beanfield War (1988) crisply organized each projects abundant wealth of source material. Another brilliant editor of late-sixties American cinema, Lou Lombardo (who edited The Wild Bunch [1969] to seminal effect) worked sporadically in the eighties and mainly on low-key films (Moonstruck, in Country [1989]) where his editing choices showed the intelligence and subtlety that rarely wins Oscars. The wonderful comic effectiveness and timing of Moonstruck, for example, depends as much on Lombardo's editing as on John Patrick Shanley's script or the performances by Cher, Nicolas Cage, and the rest of the cast. Legendary editor Anne V. Coates (Lawrence of Arabia [1962]) worked in the eighties with no directors the stature of David Lean, but her editing (with Antony Gibbs and Stanley Warnow) held Ragtime (1981) together amid its plethora of characters and subplots and produced a workable film from a difficult-to-adapt novel. Ray Lovejoy cut Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), and he worked again with Kubrick on The Shining and supplied that picture with an entirely different—tenser, more foreboding—texture than the stately science fiction classic had possessed. Lovejoy also proved adept at editing for blockbuster effect. His cutting in Aliens sustained that sequel's narrative momentum with a speed and tension that its predecessor did not have, and his editing on Batman finessed that film's gaping narrative problems by simply rushing past them. For Walter Murch (whose classic work in the seventies included The Conversation and Apocalypse Now and in the nineties The English Patient), the eighties were a relatively quiescent decade as film editor: Disneyland's \"Captain Eo\" (1986), and The Unbearable Lightness of Being (1988). After cutting in the seventies The Godfather, Parts I and II and The Deer Hunter, Peter Zinner, too, worked on less prominent projects in the eighties, the most notable being An Officer and a Gentleman (1982).\n\nCharacter-centered and dialogue-based filmmakers needed sensitive editors to find the dramatic nuances in the material, the appropriate take of an actor's performance, and the right edit points to shape the subtleties of a scene. Barry Levinson relied on Stu Linder to give Diner> (1982), The Natural (1984), Tin Men (1987), and Rain Man (1988) the careful shaping that the material demanded, and Lawrence Kasdan relied on Carol Littleton for Body Heat (1981), The Big Chill (1983), Silverado (1985), and The Accidental Tourist (1988). Clint Eastwood's improvisatory approach to filmmaking, wherein he allowed the actors to find their characters and behavior on the set while shooting, found its complement in the stately, unhurried pacing supplied by Joel Cox's editing (Cox succeeding Ferris Webster for Eastwood) on Bronco Billy (1980), Sudden Impact (1983), Tightrope (1984), Pale Rider (1985), Heartbreak Ridge (1986), Bird (1988), and Pink Cadillac (1989). The pacing of the Cox-Eastwood films was at striking variance from the accelerating speed of much filmic storytelling in the eighties, especially in action films. Their eighties work anticipates and collectively points toward their supreme achievement in \"real time\" editing, The Bridges of Madison County (1995).\n\nThe editor's contribution to a director's work is evident in other enduring partnerships that spanned the decade. Woody Allen and Francis Coppola's projects were remarkably eclectic in style and subject matter, yet they retained regular editors despite the changing aesthetic nature of their productions. Susan E. Morse edited every Allen film of the eighties, regardless of its subject matter or visual design, and as we have seen, Allen worked with a variety of cinematographers and production designers in those years. His insistent use of Morse demonstrates the essential nature of her collaboration. Barry Malkin cut Coppola's Rumble Fish, The Cotton Club, Peggy Sue Got Married, and Gardens of Stone as well as the Coppola-produced Hammet. He also cut Arthur Penn's Four Friends (1981), and the difference an editor makes on a director's films is evident by comparing his more linear approach to Dede Allen's fractured and off-center cutting. Brian De Palma's work was more consistent stylistically than Allen's or Coppola's, and he relied on Bill Pankow for Body Double (1984), The Untouchables (1987), and Casualties of War (1989). Sydney Pollack used Fredric and William Steinkamp on all of his eighties work (Tootsie [1982], out of Africa [1985], Havana [1990]). In its comic sophistication and narrative elegance, Blake Edwards's work exemplified the merits of classical Hollywood filmmaking, and illustrative of this, he relied on Ralph E. Winters, whose editing credits go back to Mr. and Mrs. North (1941) and Gaslight (1944) and who cut, for Edwards, S.O.B., Victor/Victoria, Curse of the Pink Panther, The Man Who Loved Women, and Micki and Maude.\n\nAction film storytelling accelerated at a lightning pace during the decade, with edit points barely separated by a handful of frames. Mark Goldblatt's ferocious work on The Terminator (1984) was the most impressive example of editing for sheer narrative momentum since Carl Pingitore and Don Siegel's work on Dirty Harry (1971). Goldblatt also worked on the fast-moving Commando (1985), Rambo (1985) and Jumpin' Jack Flash (1986). Chris Lebenzon and Billy Webber's editing of Top Gun, Paul Hirsch's editing of The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and Michael Kahn's work on Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) raised the threshold for narrative pacing and, through their influence, helped many of the period's most popular films increasingly resemble rollercoaster rides.\n\nUnlike other below-the-line production components, film scoring faced a threat to its very existence in the eighties. The majors' desire to exploit ancillary markets placed increasing pressure on filmmakers to use pop music (either by currently popular artists or the recycled hits of yesterday) in place of an original score. Most film composers regarded the pop solution as a quick and dirty way of getting a soundtrack and artistically inferior to an original score, whose purpose, unlike the pop song, is to serve the film. To the extent that the pop song strategy prevailed, the art of original scoring languished, and many films were released whose soundtracks were clearly just a means of selling records. On the other hand, however, the eighties produced fine original film scores, and enough productions avoided pop music to enable major composers to continue their careers by producing work of distinction.\n\nJohn Barry, for example, had famously written the brassy and jazz-inflected scores for the James Bond films in the sixties. In the eighties he produced lushly romantic com positions for Body Heat, Out of Africa, and Dances with Wolves (1990). Barry's ability on these films to write soaring music for full symphony orchestra resulted from John Williams's demonstration in the Spielberg-Lucas films (Raiders of the Lost Ark, Star Wars, etc.) of the symphony as a vital scoring resource. In the sixties and early seventies, the symphonic score had fallen out of favor, replaced by smaller groups of musicians playing rock-based music. Williams brought the symphonic score back into prominence with his stirring music for the blockbusters and enabled others to work in this mode (e.g., Randy Newman's The Natural [1984]). James Homer's soaring Glory, replete with the Harlem Boys' Choir, was one of the decade's outstanding symphonic compositions. In this expansive mode, Maurice Jarre's score for A Passage to India concluded his collaborations (Lawrence of Arabia, Ryan's Daughter [1970]) with director David Lean.\n\nWith his remarkable versatility, Jerry Goldsmith worked inside and outside of this tradition as the needs of a production warranted. His scores for the Rambo series (1982, 1985, 1988) were full-blooded orchestral works, while his work on Gremlins (1984) showed his ability to write memorable themes that provided a perfect musical embodiment for a film's emotional coloration. His score Under Fire aimed to musically characterize regional revolution in Central America by using indigenous instrumentation (pan flutes), and he managed to do this while accommodating room for impressive guitar solos by Pat Metheny. Like Goldsmith, Henry Mancini was prolific and adept at working in a variety of musical modes. Mancini's witty scoring was a superb accompaniment to Blake Edwards's comedies, and together they represented one of American cinema's most important director-composer teams. Mancini scored Edwards's S.O.B., Victor/Victoria, Trail of the Pink Panther, The Man Who Loved Women, That's Life, A Fine Mess, Blind Date, and Sunset. Mancini was equally adept at scoring drama, and his music for Edwards' earlier \"Peter Gunn\" television series and feature Days of Wine and Roses (1962) added classic and enduring musical themes to the repertoire. In 1989, Edwards returned to television with a new Peter Gunn movie and another Mancini collaboration in a superb dramatic score.\n\nItalian composers Giorgio Moroder and Ennio Morricone wrote striking scores using novel instrumentation, relatively simple themes subject to intensive repetition, and the integration of electronics with the conventional symphony. Moroder's insistent disco rhythms gave an unmistakably pop sound to the scores for American Gigolo (1980), Cat People (1982), Flashdance (1983), Scarface and Top Gun (1986), his synth-pop sound was unmistakable on Thief of Hearts (1984), for which he was the soundtrack producer, and the 1984 restoration of Metropolis (1926), which he produced and coscored. Ennio Morricone, most famous for his scores for Sergio Leone's spaghetti Westerns, was one of the most prolific film composers in the business. In the eighties, he wrote music for over sixty films. This quantity of output, however, accompanied great variations in quality, with Morricone often seeming to plagiarize himself by recycling his own material (e.g., In the Line of Fire [1993] and The Untouchables [1987]). Morricone worked as an international composer in the eighties, and his scores for Hollywood pictures accompanied a great deal of work in the Italian cinema. His best Hollywood scores left an indelible imprint on the films and in the viewer's mind. By turns lyrical and violent, accentuating rarely employed instruments like pan flutes or harmonica, Morricone's music fused with the images and became an organic part of the experience of Once Upon a Time in America (1984), The Mission (1986), The Untouchables (1987), and Casualties of War (1989). One casualty for Morricone in the eighties was his score for The Thing (1982). Director John Carpenter discarded much of Morricone's composition and retained those passages that were stylistically consistent with the scores Carpenter had himself written for his other films.\n\nBill Conti had secured his career by scoring the Rocky series, beginning in the latter seventies, and writing the popular Rocky theme (\"Gonna Fly Now\"). With John Williams s themes from the Raiders and Star Wars series, this was one of decade's best-known musical leitmotifs. Conti specialized in stirring, rousing scores (others included Victory [1981] and The Right Stuff [1983]), and he broadened his association with Rocky director John Avildson by scoring Avildson's Karate Kid series (1984, 1986, 1989).\n\nProminent scoring newcomers in the eighties included Angelo Badalamenti, whose haunting and eerie music David Lynch used to great effect in Blue Velvet (1986), Wild at Heart (1990) and, on television, \"Twin Peaks\" (1990). Scoring his first films for release in 1979, James Horner emerged as a major talent in the eighties, with full bodied, epic scores for Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982) and III: The Search For Spock (1984). But along with Glory, it was Field of Dreams (1989) that represented his finest work of the decade. Horner's Field of Dreams score was an intriguing combination of symphony orchestra and electronic instrumentation, using the former to capture the nostalgic romance of baseball and the latter to emblemize the supernatural aspects of the story. Mark Isham's scores for Alan Rudolph's films (Trouble in Mind [1985], Made Heaven [1987], The Moderns [1988]) relied on unusual instrumentation and sonic effects, with the Trouble in Mind score a particular standout with its noirish mix of solo trumpet, blues, and vocal cries. Lennie Neihaus worked without bombast, in a self-effacing way, with his music for Clint Eastwood on City Heat [1984, Richard Benjamin, director], Tightrope [1984, Richard Tuggle, director], Pale Rider [1985], Heartbreak Ridge (1986) and Bird (1988). Although he did some scoring in the seventies, Basil Poledouris emerged in the eighties as a major composer, producing the best Western movie score of the last thirty years for the television miniseries \"Lonesome Dove\" (1989). It was an epic score, with big-screen sweep and grandeur, and it stands with Victor Young's Shane (1953) Elmer Bernstein's The Magnificent Seven (1960) as a classic in the genre. Other significant composers who established their careers in the eighties were Howard Shore (Places in the Heart [1984], After Hours [1985], The Fly [1986], Big [1988]) and Alan Silvestri (Back to the Future [1985], Who Framed Roger Rabbit [1988], Back to the Future, Part II [1989], The Aryss [1989]). The most important new film composer in the eighties, however, was Danny Elfman, whose unique orchestrations and intricate rhythms made incalculable contributions to Tim Burtons Pee-Wee's Big Adventure (1985), Beetlejuice (1988), and Batman (1989). Elfman quickly established a unique musical voice and a superb ability to catch the action on screen, essential attributes that the great film composers have possessed.\n\nAbove the Line\n\nTo create an organizational schema, I have grouped the decade's major directors in terms of those who had an exemplary box-office track record (the hit makers: Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, John Hughes, John Landis, Jon Peters and Peter Guber, Robert Zemeckis); those whose careers foundered (the embattled auteurs: Robert Altman, Peter Bogdanovich, John Carpenter, Francis Ford Coppola, Brian De Palma, Arthur Penn, Martin Scorsese); those who worked steadily and solidly throughout the decade (the working directors: Woody Allen, Clint Eastwod, Sidney Lumet, Sydney Pollack); those who represented a new constituency and who added their voices to American film (the newcomers: women directors and producers, Tim Burton, James Cameron, Joe Dante, Lawrence Kasdan, Barry Levinson, Spike Lee, Oliver Stone); and those who worked outside the major channels of production and distribution (the independents and outsiders: Joel and Ethan Coen, Jim Jarmusch, David Lynch, Alan Rudolph, John Sayles, Paul Schrader). I have sequenced the filmmakers alphabetically in each section, except for the first one which deals with the hit makers. Because of the seminal status of Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, it is appropriate to begin that section with their careers.\n\nThe Hit-Makers\n\nYear after year, the industry's big blockbuster films were its most visible products, garnering the greatest media attention and public interest. The success of the blockbusters points to a related phenomenon of the period, namely, the ascendency of the producer as both creative auteur and as custodian of studio capital. Following the Heaven's Gate disaster, with its lesson about the perils of letting an ambitious director work unsupervised, studio supervision of film production tightened, and a new era of powerful producers commenced. This was a concomitant of blockbuster filmmaking and helped provide an extra index of security for the majors. Potential blockbusters would not be entrusted to directors working without tight supervision. Most of the period's reliable hit makers functioned as powerful producers, if not also as directors.\n\nSteven Spielberg\n\nMeasured strictly by box office, Steven Spielberg was easily, and clearly, the decade's most important filmmaker. His career skyrocketed during this period and arguably was informed by the period's Zeitgeist. But to measure Spielberg's filmmaking accomplishments only by the spectacular box-office returns they generated is to misjudge his career and his talent. The discontinuity between academic and highbrow cultural criticism and the public is nowhere more apparent than in the critical reception accorded Spielberg and George Lucas. These filmmakers achieved an extraordinary rapport with the popular audience, yet the critical merit of their filmmaking has remained controversial. It is true that Spielbergs popular films evoke an uncomplicated range of emotions. Furthermore, in the eighties Spielberg had not yet become intimate in his art with the evil and moral darkness that he depicted so powerfully in Schindler's List (1993) in the character of the Nazi commandant Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes). But serious critics failed to give him his due. One finds in the work of Spielberg and Lucas some decidedly old-Hollywood virtues—a delight in economical, no-nonsense storytelling, an embrace of sentiment, an emotional immediacy unaccompanied by irony, and a love for the medium that is enthusiastic and that lacks tortured, postmodern self-consciousness. Given such qualities, it is no wonder the public embraced these filmmakers.\n\nSpielberg's first picture of the decade, Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), followed his seventies hits Jaws (1975) and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) and seemed to certify him as a blockbuster filmmaker par excellance. But Raiders is more ambitious and accomplished than the appellation of \"blockbuster\" conveys. Based on a story by George Lucas (who also co-produced), it shows its makers' deep love for the medium, in particular the adventure stories and cliffhanger serials they recalled from their youth (and it has a basis in pulp novels as well—Indiana Jones is a Doc Savage-like character).2 The opening act is an amazing demonstration of storytelling skill, bringing the viewer in at the climactic end of one movie, which concludes before the main narrative of Raiders will begin. Jones's efforts to capture a valuable idol from a booby-trapped cave generate an escalating series of climaxes and hair breadth escapes that provide a splendid filmic conclusion—except that Raiders is only just beginning. The challenge Spielberg (and Lucas) set themselves here demonstrates their skill. By opening the film in this adrenaline-charged manner, they set a pace and level of thrill that they had to continually top, and they do. This is as self-conscious an act of narration and filmmaking as one will find (and which culminates in an overt homage to Citizen Kane [1941] at the end), yet the film's popularity has tended to obscure the filmmaking work and the narrative ambitions that are involved.\n\nSpielberg followed Raiders with two more popular hits: E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (1983) and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984). Once again, to the dismay of serious film critics, the popular audience made a clear statement about the importance of feeling and emotion in cinema and the enthusiastic narrative skill that Spielberg brought to his work. E.T., in particular, touched viewers in a powerful manner that few filmmakers ever achieve in their work. Many critics distrusted the emotional response that Spielberg's films evoked from viewers, and this disconnect from the popular audience soon became apparent, as well, among Spielberg's filmmaking peers. Though his films (Raiders, E.T, The Color Purple) were nominated for best picture Oscars, none of them won this award, nor did Spielberg receive a best director Oscar during the decade. Moreover, he failed even to be nominated for The Color Purple. The Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences seemed to be sending a clear message that a schism prevailed between box-office success (at the extraordinary level that Spielberg's pictures enjoyed) and artistic success.\n\nIn 1986, the Academy did bestow an honor upon Spielberg, awarding him the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award. In his acceptance speech, Spielberg lamented that much contemporary film was poorly written and urged filmmakers to create a more literate cinema, in which ideas and ennobling themes could be explored. These remarks surprised many listeners, who did not associate Spielberg with an especially literate style of filmmaking. But he now endeavored (and, indeed, had already started with 1985's The Color Purple) to honor this principle. In respect of this, his work in the eighties is bifurcated. The first half of the decade finds Spielberg working in a populist mode, fashioning films that connect with the greatest possible number of viewers (Raiders, E.T., Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and a segment of Twilight Zone: The Movie [1983]). By contrast, most of his features in the second half of the decade are films without clear blockbuster potential: The Color Purple, Empire of the Sun (1987), Always (1989). Only Indiana Jones and the last Crusade (1989) finds Spielberg back in a popcorn-movie mode. Based on the novel by Alice Walker, The Color Purple relates a story about the life of a poor black woman (played by Whoopi Goldberg in her film debut) who endures years of abuse from her husband before she can assert her independence. Empire of the Sun was another ambitious literary adaptation, based on J. G. Ballard's novel about a young British boy separated from his parents in Shanghai when the Japanese invade China in the prelude to World War II. Always was a remake of a popular World War II movie about a pilot, killed in a crash, who returns to offer spiritual shelter and protection to the woman he loves. Though each of these films has evident failings, it was clear that Spielberg was an ambitious filmmaker who aspired to new challenges and that he was seeking to expand his range.\n\nOf greatest significance is a point that was hard to see at the time—that World War II had a special resonance for Spielberg and that he would become one of its most significant cinematic chroniclers. The Indiana Jones films are set in and around that period, with Nazis as Jones's most dangerous antagonists. The storyline of The Color Purple runs into the late thirties, and servicemen in uniform appear as extras in the background of one scene. Empire of the Sun deals directly with the war, and Always resituates what was originally a wartime narrative (the original picture, A Guy Named Joe, was released in 1943) into more contemporary terms. These pictures in the latter eighties enabled Spielberg, with some awkwardness, to segue to a more adult-themed filmmaking and to make his initial forays into the historical period, and the moral issues, that he would take up with much greater assurance and accomplishment in Schindler's List (1993) and Saving Private Ryan (1998). Thus, to dismiss Spielberg as a popcorn-movie maker is doubly wrong. It minimizes the real accomplishments of his hit movies, and it overlooks the new directions in which he took his filmmaking in the latter half of the decade.\n\nSpielberg's talent was evident as well in the impassioned pace with which he worked. He completed seven features during the decade—an extraordinary level of output—and he left his mark as director or producer on a huge outpouring of film and television programming. As a producer of work by other filmmakers, he gave important career boosts to directors Lawrence Kasdan, Joe Dante, and Robert Zemeckis. Like the powerful producers of classical Hollywood, such as Arthur Freed, Spielberg left his mark on the style of the pictures he produced. Like his own most popular work as director, these tended to involve special effects and to evoke lighthearted, adolescent adventure. His work as producer included Used Cars (1980), Continental Divide (1981), Poltergeist (1982), Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983), Gremlins (1984), Young Sherlock Holmes (1985), The Goonies Back to the Future (1985) \"Amazing Stories\" (1985, TV series), An American Tail (1986), The Money Pit (1986), *batteries not included (1987), Innerspace (1987), The Land before Time (1988), Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988), Dad (1989), and Back to the Future, Part II (1989).\n\nSpielberg's work was a major influence on the blockbuster turn in contemporary cinema, but his ambitions as a filmmaker clearly transcended this category of production. The 1980s were the transitional decade for him, taking his work from the seminal popularity of pictures like E.T., and his seventies hits, and toward the ambitious and complex issues of human evil and moral redemption that he regularly examined in the nineties (Schindler's List, Amistad (1997), Saving Private Ryan).\n\nGeorge Lucas\n\nThe Star Wars films of George Lucas are seminal works modern cinema, exerting a profound influence on popular culture, and they are among the most ambitiously conceived epics of film narrative ever made. The second and third installments of the series (which are episodes five and six in the narrative cycle)—The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983)—climaxed brought to conclusion the narrative elements that had been broached in the mid-seventies with Star Wars. (Accentuating the scope of these ambitions, Lucas launched in the late nineties an additional three films, which form the \"back story\" to the conflict between the Empire and the rebel forces.) The hugeness of this project and the expanse and wealth of story information that Lucas gave to his mythopoeic world were unprecedented in contemporary cinema. By beginning his saga in the middle of the story (Star Wars is episode four), Lucas abruptly plunged his viewers into a welldefined mythic universe, and each subsequent film elaborated upon the intricate network of characters and locations that Lucas was fashioning, installment by installment. By the end of Return of the Jedi, this imaginative universe contained a galaxy of uniquely differentiated and vividly rendered planets where critical episodes of the storyline occur. The Empire Strikes Back opens on the ice world of Hoth and a deadly clash between the Empire and the rebel forces, which have gone into hiding after launching (from the planet of Yavin 4) their assault on the first Death Star in Star Wars. The heroes, Luke, Han, and Princess Leia, escape the battle, with Luke journeying to the jungle world of Dagobah, where he encounters the Zen-like but diminutive Yoda. Han and Leia seek refuge on Bespin in the Cloud City run by Lando Calrissian. Darth Vader, though, sets a trap, freeze-dries Han, and sends him to Tatooine, the desert world where Luke grew up and where the toadlike gangster Jabba the Hut has his headquarters. The climax of the Empire-rebel struggle occurs in Return of the Jedi on Endor, a forest planet that is home to the Ewok, race of furry, cute, but fierce Rebel allies. Filling out this remarkably detailed gallery of places and characters are bounty hunters (Boba Fett, Greedo), monsters (the sand-dwelling Sarlacc), and Wild West cantinas (Mos Eisley).\n\nMuch of the series' popular appeal certainly lies in the elaborateness of its conception and the vivid and engaging details with which Lucas filled it out. But this appeal ran deep and captured the fancy of a generation of young viewers. Here the archetypal elements of the story are relevant. Lucas was familiar with folklore and mythology, particularly the work of Joseph Campbell on the structural characteristics of myth. Adroitly handled by Lucas and his team of filmmakers, the mythic substrata of the stories carried the emotional urgency of primal issues. Luke's struggle with the Dark Side and the revelation (a narrative surprise at the conclusion of The Empire Strikes Back) of his relationship with Darth Vader gave the fantasy moral force and emotional resonance.\n\nAs Lucas has acknowledged,\n\nThe struggle between good and evil within us has been around since the beginning of time. All mythology and all religions address it, and it's the most intimate struggle that we cope with—trying to do the right thing and what's expected of us by society, by our peers, and in our hearts. The issues of falling from grace and being redeemed, and the strength of family and love—they're all very primary issues.3\n\nThe enthusiastic public reception for the films demonstrated the powerful rendition that Lucas had given these issues and the engaging manner in which he put them across. The archetypal force of these films is so immediate, the narratives and characters so lacking in irony, that intellectuals and critics were dismayed and somewhat uncomfortable with the communion that Lucas had achieved with his audience, as if the films' extraordinary popularity compromised their artistic worth. Interestingly, in this regard, Lucas did not, and had never, seen himself as a Hollywood filmmaker. \"I am an independent filmmaker. People say my movies are just like Hollywood movies. And I say, 'I can't help it if Hollywood copies.'\"4 Lucas's independence was both financial and artistic. By controlling the sequel rights to Star Wars and the related product licensing, Lucas reaped a fortune, which he used to establish his production facilities. These gave him an artistic freedom from studio interference. And he put his fortune into the films, using the success of each to finance the next. \"I took the money I'd made from American Graffiti and stuck it into starting ILM, and then I took the money from Star Wars and popped it into The Empire Strikes Back, and the money from Empire into Return of the Jedi. Each film has paid for the next.\"5\n\nHis desire for artistic independence fueled the development of film production facilities that were geographically removed from Hollywood, with the divergent locale embodying the philosophical split from the studios, and that were on the cutting edge of research and development into sound recording and special effects. Lucas founded in 1975 the special effects house Industrial Light and Magic, based in San Rafael, California. In 1980, he began construction in Marin County, California, of Skywalker Ranch, the headquarters of Lucasfilm Ltd., his production company. The facility would contain an extensive research library and state-of-the-art sound recording facilities that served the postproduction of Lucas's pictures as well The Godfather, Part III (1990), Terminator 2 (1991), Bugsy (1991), JFK and other films by directors who were attracted to the sophisticated resources that Skywalker Ranch offered. In developing these facilities, Lucas held a long-range view of the industry's future. He wanted the resources that could train the next generations of special effects wizards and that could ease the industry's transition toward electronic methods of filmmaking, which he believed could help make cinema into a medium like painting, where the artist can control, with exacting precision, all aspects of the image. In this respect, Lucas took an industry lead in developing electronic and computerized approaches to image and sound editing—the EditDroid and SoundDroid systems—and a general upgrading of postproduction tools. Pursuing these interests—and getting ILM into solvent shape—effectively stalled his directing career. After directing the original Star Wars (1977), he served as producer on the two follow-up films and did not direct any features during the decade (though he did shoot second-unit footage on Raiders of the Lost Ark, Willow, Tucker, and other pictures). Furthermore, the completion of Return of the Jedi put the series into a long hiatus, with sixteen years elapsing before release of The Phantom Menace (1999).\n\nBut though he did not direct, Lucas used his role as a producer, and his company, to exert considerable influence on picture making during the period. As producer, Lucas worked on Kagemusha (1980), Body Heat (1981), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Twice upon a Time (1983), The Ewok Adventure (1984, TV movie), Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), Ewoks: The Battle for Endor (1985, TV movie), \"Ewoks\" (1985, TV series), Howard the Duck (1986), Labyrinth (1986), The Land Before Time (1988), Tucker: The Man and His Dream (1988), Willow (1988), and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989). Lucas used his industry influence to help filmmakers he admired get their projects into production and distribution—Akira Kurosawa and Kagemusha, Lawrence Kasdan Body Heat, Haskell Wexler and Latino (1985).6 In addition to this feature television work, Lucas designed the Disney theme park attractions \"Captain EO\" (1986, directed by Francis Coppola and featuring Michael Jackson) and \"Star Tours\" (1987), an effects ride tied in to the Empire-rebel conflict of Star Wars.\n\nIn tandem with this work, Lucas and ILM researched and developed the next generation of production tools. Indeed, Lucas's greatest influence on American film was here, in his championing of digital production methods and effects technology. As noted, Lucasfilm brought a random-access, computer-assisted electronic editor (Editdroid) on line at mid-decade and an all-digital sound editor (SoundDroid) a few years later.7 To ensure optimum, state-of-the-art sound, the Technical Building (a sound post-production facility at Skywalker Ranch) was constructed with elaborate acoustical design features. These included mechanical and electrical systems to optimize room acoustics and to isolate sound from low-level background noise.8 The facility enabled Lucasfilm to lead the industry in sophisticated sound design, and its recording stage attracted a variety of\n\nother filmmakers and musicians (the Grateful Dead, the Kronos Quartet, Linda Ronstadt).\n\nLucas's effects house, Industrial Light and Magic, designed effects for the Lucas productions as well as a wide range of other prominent films. These included Dragonslayer (1981), The Dark Crystal (1982), Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982), E.T. (1982), Starman (1984), Star Trek III: The Search for Spock (1984), Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), Out of Africa (1985), Mishima (1985), The Goonies (1985), Back to the Future (1985), Cocoon (1985), The Golden Child (1986), Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (1986), The Money Pit (1986), Empire of the Sun (1987), Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987), *batteries not included (1987), Innerspace (1987), Harry and the Hendersons (1987), The Witches of Eastwick (1987); The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), Cocoon II (1988), The Accidental Tourist (1988), Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988); Always (1989), Back to the Future, Part II (1989), The Abyss (1989), Ghostbusters II (1989), Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), Star Trek V: The Final Frontier (1989), and Field of Dreams (1989). Through these pictures, ILM put its imprimateur upon a decades worth of film and became synonymous with cutting-edge special effects.\n\nIn 1989 and 1990, ILM's work with director James Cameron on The Abyss Terminator 2 broke new ground in the use of digital effects to create the films' slithery water creature and gleaming, shape-shifting terminator. Since then, ILM helped move the industry toward more extensive computer-based methods of filmmaking, which, Lucas believed, will give filmmakers significantly greater creative freedom because filming and post-production processes will be completely digital. \"Before, once you photographed something, you were pretty much stuck with it. Now … you can have complete control over it just like an artist does, and that to me is the way it should be.\"9 With digital tools, Lucas points out, \"you can make shots conform to your idea after the fact, rather than trying to conform the world to what your idea is.\"10\n\nOf course, many filmmakers and viewers might find this compulsion for total control over filmic elements to be stifling of creative freedom, the very ideal that Lucas said he was pursuing. His passion for preplanned design was an approach to filmmaking at odds with more aleatory, improvised methods. But cinema is open to both approaches, and Lucas's design-centered aesthetic was not dissimilar to Hitchcock's passion for control, with the proviso that Hitchcock's understanding of the audience was perhaps more nuanced than Lucas's. And it is very few filmmakers who create the essential epic mythos of modern cinema and one with a cultural force that transcends the medium and imbibes the period to become its inescapable artifact. ILM was the engine driving the effects and digital revolutions in modern film, and Lucas became the industry's technological visionary, fixed on the digital future of film and transforming it away from its photomechanical base.\n\nDon Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer\n\nAlong with Spielberg and Lucas, Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer were the decade's most successful blockbuster filmmakers. It is not incorrect to refer to them as filmmakers even though they received no director's credit on their films, nor did they direct such films. They didn't have to. As producer-auteurs (Flashdance, Beverly Hills Cop, Top Gun), they imposed a powerful visual and narrative style on the films they guided through production, and in this respect there was something of old Hollywood about their character and methods. Powerful producers were plentiful during Hollywood's classical period (David O. Selznick, Arthur Freed, Walter Wanger, Mark Hellinger), but the cult of the director that developed in the late sixties and seventies tended to delegitimize the producers creative contributions. Director Martin Brest (Going in Style [1979], Beverly Hills Cop) noted that in the seventies \"producer\" was a dirty word.11 By contrast, in the eighties the legacy of Heaven's Gate and the spectacular success of Lucas and Spielberg and of Simpson-Bruckheimer Productions marked a resurgence of the producer as a key auteur.\n\nIndeed, Simpson absolutely considered himself to be the author of those pictures that he produced, and he forcefully proclaimed this creative ownership as a means of countering a studio's inevitable assertion of creative property rights. Describing the Simpson-Bruckheimer approach, Simpson said, \"We're not only hands-on, we're feet-on. We don't take a passive role in any shape or form.\"12 Bruckheimer noted that it was strategically important to insist on the producer's creative authority when dealing with powerful studio-distributors because, otherwise, the studio would usurp the producer's autonomy. \"Don … felt, and he was right, that unless you say, 'I made this movie,' it will be Paramount's Top Gun, it will be a studio movie.\"13 Simpson was skeptical about the claims to sole authorship by many directors, and he regarded the director on Simpson-Bruckheimer productions as another for-hire member of the crew, a member that had one function—to serve the production. \"I don't believe in the auteur theory. Some directors who shall remain nameless do regard movies as an extension of their internal emotional landscape, but Jerry and I decide on the movie we want to make. We then hire an all-star team who can implement the vision. The movie is the auteur, the boss…. No one person, director or writer, is above the call of the final result.\"14\n\nSimpson was an executive at Paramount and the president of worldwide production from 1981 to 1982 when he switched (or was forced out of the studio, depending on who is telling the story) to independent production with Bruckheimer, whose background was in advertising. Considering Paramount home, Simpson-Bruckheimer turned out a stream of hits for the studio during the eighties. The production duo's chart-topping success began with their first collaboration in 1983, Flashdance, followed by Thief of Hearts (1984, and not a huge hit like the others), Beverly Hills Cop (1984), Top Gun (1986) and Beverly Hills Cop II (1987). By decade's end, their films had generated revenues for Paramount of $2.27 billion. Paramount, in turn, was so committed to keeping the production duo that the studio tore up their existing contract in 1985 and signed them to a new, multimillion-dollar, four-year deal that gave them points on all the films they produced and a share of ancillary revenue.\n\nMore than any other eighties productions, the Simpson-Bruckheimer films embodied the \"high concept\" approach to moviemaking. The storylines were simple and easily described but were punched across by aggressive editing and a skillful blend of visual imagery and popular music. Flashdance and Top Gun embodied a rock video style of filmmaking in which the emphasis was on bite-sized narrative segments and a fusion of image and music. The narrative in Top Gun is exceptionally direct and unembellished (\"clean\" in Simpson's lexicon). Tom Cruise plays a Navy fighter pilot in training at the elite Top Gun school, where he learns the latest methods of aerial combat. He romances a teacher at the school (Kelly McGillis), loses his best friend in a flying accident, suffers a crisis of confidence and nerve, and recovers his skills in time to save a comrade in a dogfight with Soviet fighters. This bare-bones narrative gets a high-gloss visual treatment amid extended sequences cut to music and that featured little or no dialogue.\n\nSimpson and Bruckheimer combined their complementary backgrounds to perfect their high-concept formula, merging a lean, propulsive story (Simpson) and commanding visuals (Bruckheimer). Simpson said, \"We entered into this relationship from two disparate positions. With my background as writer and actor, my responsibility was always in telling and conceiving the story. I brought the verbal to the relationship. Jerry was the film editor and photographer, so he brought the visual. Verbal and visual; we were the 'V & V twins.\" For Simpson, the blockbuster aesthetic must be \"clean\"; that is, it must use a design that is clear and immediately accessible. This was the essence of high concept—a catchy premise uncluttered by excessive narrative development or dramatic ambiguities and layered with slick images like icing on a cake. \"The aesthetic is: 'that's clean' … which can apply to art, a jacket, a shot in a movie, even a girl. It means 'it works.' The design works.\" Simpson's description of how he chose a project was also a statement of how their high-concept films worked on viewers: \"I never start out intellectually. I commit my instincts. It's gut to heart to mind to mouth.\"15\n\nSimpson-Bruckheimer's incorporation of music as a key element of high-concept design proved to be tremendously influential. Portions of Flashdance and Top Gun are essentially rock videos, extended montage sequences cut to music, which facilitated synergies with recorded music merchandising (see ch. 3). Flashdance and subsequent Simpson-Bruckheimer films were carefully marketed in tandem with the release of singles and albums featuring music from the sound track. The popularity of each market (recorded music and film) reinforced the performance of the other. The Beverly Hills Cop sound track sold over a million copies (platinum status) the year of the film's release, and the Flashdance sound track broke 5 million copies.\n\nThe high-concept approach became a durable and essential staple of Hollywood filmmaking and transcended the works produced by Simpson and Bruckheimer. Twins (1988), for example, made at Universal under production chief Tom Pollock, hinged its narrative premise and marketing appeals on the singular prospect, and image, of muscular Arnold Schwarzenegger and diminuitive Danny DeVito as fraternal twins. The image and the idea vividly encapsulated the film. Even as they bequeathed high concept to American cinema, Simpson and Bruckheimer's box-office success faltered at decade's end. In 1988, Paramount renegotiated their contract, promising over $300 million for five pictures of their choosing plus a percentage of the gross. The first picture under this deal, Days of Thunder, starring Tom Cruise as a race car driver, went into production with a problematic script, unusual for a Simpson-Bruckheimer picture because Simpson was renowned for giving scripts close attention. He would issue twenty- and thirty-page memos to writers specifying revisions and then oversee as many rewrites of the material. (Screenwriter John Gregory Dunne found Simpson's analyses to be intelligent and keenly attuned to issues of narrative structure.) Worse, Days of Thunder went over budget, costing Paramount $70 million and generating relatively disappointing box office, short of the Top Gun-on-wheels potential the studio wanted.\n\nIn the wake of this \"failure,\" Paramount demanded a restriction on their gross participation perk, whereupon Simpson and Bruckheimer left Paramount for Disney, ending their spectacular alliance with the decade's most successful major. At Disney, cost cutting was the norm, and Simpson-Bruckheimer's lavish ways were ill suited for their new employers corporate climate. They had difficulty putting projects together. The Ref, their next release, did not appear until 1994, and it performed poorly. But in 1995-96, they came back with three huge hits, Crimson Tide, Dangerous Minds, and The Rock. By now, though, Simpson's drug use, which had been a chronic feature of his life, was out of control, and Jerry Bruckheimer dissolved the partnership. Simpson quickly self-destructed. Drug and psychological problems overwhelmed him. Five months later, in January, he died of a drug overdose.\n\nIt was a dispiriting fall from power and a cautionary tale of Hollywood excess. Yet throughout the eighties, Simpson and Bruckheimer's hits helped make Paramount the most successful major of the decade, dramatized the windfall profits that ancillary synergies could produce, and helped turn film narrative into a series of adrenaline-pumping audiovisual montages. And although Simpson could not control the chaos of his private life, before his partnership with Bruckheimer ended, they had given the industry the quintessential elements of blockbuster marketing.\n\nJohn Hughes\n\nThe decades king of teen comedy was John Hughes. Beginning with his first film as director, Sixteen Candles (1984), Hughes worked prolifically, directing a film a year through the remainder of the decade. By contrast, in the nineties, he was virtually quiescent as a director, though not as a writer. Thus, to date, he remains essentially a filmmaker of the eighties.\n\nSixteen Candles established the essential Hughes milieu of adolescent longing and angst played as lighthearted comedy. Shot for less than $6.5 million, the picture broke the rules of teen comedy and set new ones. Hughes felt that sixteen-year-olds were poorly served by the films aimed their way, so he pitched the Sixteen Candles story with a female character at its center and with sex deemphasized. Samantha (Molly Ringwald) is a high school student fast approaching her sixteenth birthday, and she struggles with her crush on the school's most popular guy while trying to fend off the awkward affections of the school geek. \"It was my intent to write it from the female point of view, because this genre is generally about males, and sex is a predominant theme…. When you're 30, you forget that at 16 sex was not your primary motivation; you were much more interested in having a boyfriend or girlfriend.\"16\n\nHughes's sensitivity to the moviegoing interests of young viewers, and to the real-life issues that subtended their moviegoing, made his pictures phenomenally successful and influential within their demographic niche and established a galaxy of new performers. In Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, (1985), and Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986), Hughes's casting choices helped launch the careers of a gallery of young actors that became known, somewhat derisively, as the brat pack: Molly Ringwald, Judd Nelson, Ally Sheedy, Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, and Matthew Broderick.\n\nAs a writer-director, Hughes had a gift for capturing authentic-sounding teen dialogue, which he achieved partly by inventing new slang terms, and he centered the films' action within the somewhat solipsistic worlds of their young characters. Thus, adult life in these films is properly distanced from the ideals, longings, and shenanigans of his teens. But unlike Spielberg, who sometimes imposed childlike responses on his viewers, Hughes's strategy was more sociological. He did not say, like Spielberg, that it's better to be a kid. Instead, he was interested in observing and recording the codes and rituals of teen life. He played to that audience without attempting to regress his viewers to that level, emphasizing story and characters and letting the jokes emerge later and from this grounding. \"I never start with the jokes. I look at an issue and try to find the story in it…. You get a lot of bad comedy from people sitting around a bar saying 'wouldn't it be funny if…'\"17\n\nHughes's most stylish and popular film in the teen series was Ferris Bueller ($29 million in domestic rentals), about \"one man's tireless crusade to take it easy.\" While cutting classes, Ferris embarks on a wild series of misadventures about which his parents and other adults remain completely clueless, as Hughes stylishly captures the solipsism of adolescence.\n\nHughes profitably ventured outside the teen genre with two popular John Candy vehicles (Planes, Trains, and Automobiles [1987], also starring Steve Martin, and Uncle Buck [1989]), but he is best known for the Brat Pack cycle that he helped popularize. If in the nineties he turned his energies to writing and producing, Hughes's eighties films defined the quintessential look and sound for an affluent, suburban youth culture. In an era of special effects, Hughes showed that one could be successful on modest budgets, with smart, funny writing and with pictures rooted in a real sociocultural milieu.\n\nJohn Landis\n\nLandis suffered the indignity of being the only American director prosecuted for the death of actors under his filmmaking supervision. The trial, its publicity, and its aftermath hung like a pall over his career during the decade and affected his already rocky relationship with the nation's film critics. The pictures he made during this period, before, during, and after the trial, contained some notable hits but also some overbudgeted, overproduced misfires.\n\nHe began the decade as an auspicious and commercially promising filmmaker. National Lampoon's Animal House, which Landis directed, was one of the biggest hits of 1978, and it made him into a golden boy at Universal. Steven Spielberg admired and liked the picture, and he and Landis became friends. Eager to support their new filmmaker, Universal executives funded The Blues Brothers, a comedy Landis fashioned around \"Saturday Night Live\" performers John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd and the characters and sketch material they had created on that popular television show. But instead of being a character-driven comedy, the movie escalated into a series of overproduced musical numbers, explosions, and car crashes. The budget went beyond what Universal had anticipated, with press reports of a production cost in excess of $30 million. When the picture was released in 1980, critics were appalled at the expenditure of so much money on so noisy a film. The Washington Post called it a \"ponderous comic monstrosity,\" and critic Kenneth Turan remarked that \"it has more car crashes than a demolition derby\" and \"fewer laughs than an afternoon at traffic school.\"18\n\nDespite these reactions, the picture sustained a devoted cult following that ensured its relative success at the box office. Intent to prove that he could work within a modest budget, Landis next made An American Werewolf in London (1981) for Polygram Pictures and producers Jon Peters and Peter Guber. Landis again aimed for the outrageous. He had filmed Animal House with grossly funny and wickedly lewd humor. This time, he deliberately blended slapstick comedy with graphic violence and gory special effects. The monster wreaks extremely bloody carnage and corpses decay in lingering detail while Landis stages wacky car crashes. He described his approach in these terms: \"Let's say you were walking in Times Square and feeling very high—like you feel after a good movie or a great concert. … And let's say at that particular moment you were approached by … Dracula, and he attacks you and starts biting your neck with his long eyeteeth. … That sort of fast transition is going to happen all the time in this movie, and that's what nobody liked about the script.\"19\n\nAn American Werewolf was a modest success, and it helped sustain Landis s reputation as an iconoclastic director whose irreverent work was especially appealing to young viewers, that vital industry demographic. When Universal floated the idea to Spielberg of doing a movie based on Rod Serlings \"Twilight Zone\" television show, Spielberg expressed his interest, and Landis was one of the directors recruited to helm a segment of this anthology film. It gave him an opportunity to work with Spielberg, who was directing another segment for the film and serving as the picture s producer.\n\nLandis scripted a dark tale about a bigot, played by Vic Morrow, who inexplicably finds himself trapped in other times and places—the American South, Vietnam, Germany during the Nazi era—where he becomes the target and victim of racial hatred. The character learns what it is like to be the object of irrational animosity. Morrow's character gets a chance at redemption, though, when he lands in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War and rescues two Vietnamese children from a helicopter attack on their village. The filming of this sequence produced a grotesque accident, one for which Landis and four associates were held accountable. They were charged with involuntary manslaughter in the events that led to the deaths on 23 July 1982 of Morrow and two child actors, Myca Dinh Le and Renee Chen.\n\nDuring action in which Morrow fled the burning village carrying the children, a helicopter piloted by Dorcey Wingo (one of Landis's codefendents) was hit by a special effects explosion and careened out of control, crushing one of the children and decapitating Morrow and the other child. The prosecution argued that Landis exhibited gross negligence in asking his effects crew to produce explosions so large they were unsafe and in asking the pilot to fly unnecessarily close to the fireball for the sake of a more impressive shot. Reporting on the accident, California's OSHA found thirty-six safety violations on the set.20 Making matters worse, the production had employed the children illegally. They had no work permit, and they were working well after dark.\n\nWhen a judgment was finally rendered nearly five years later, on 29 May 1987, Landis and his four codefendents were acquitted of the charges brought against them. But in the interval and through the massive publicity the case and the trial had generated, Landis and Twilight Zone: The Movie came to symbolize, fairly or not, a reckless handling of actors in pursuit of the biggest explosion or the most stupefying effects sequence. Worse yet, the picture as released retained its Vic Morrow segment. Morrow and the children died \"on camera,\" that is, during filming, but the footage showing their deaths did not appear in the finished film. The Vietnam sequence was dropped. As it now exists in Twilight Zone: The Movie, Landis's segment ends with Morrow's character trapped in Nazi Germany and shipped off with Jews to an extermination camp. It makes for creepy viewing. Its violence and general nihilism are compounded by a viewer's knowledge of the accident and resulting deaths. Furthermore, the retention of the Morrow segment in the finished film enhances the unpleasant aura of exploitation that hangs over this picture.\n\nLandis continued working through this five-year debacle from the accident to the end of the trial. His next picture, Trading Places, was the third biggest box-office film of 1983 and helped skyrocket Eddie Murphy to superstardom. It was a well-written, clever comedy about a pauper (Murphy) who becomes rich on the whim of a wealthy benefactor and must contend with the awkwardness of his new class identity. As a comic vehicle, it allowed Murphy full reign in expressing his streetwise sassiness to skewer upper-class pomposity. Audiences loved Murphy and loved the film. But after this picture, and as the publicity fallout from the Twilight Zone case intensified, Landis's career went into an eclipse. He kept working, but his subsequent films failed to achieve solid commercial success in relation to their production costs. In addition, the critics were unkind to Into the Night (1985), Spies Like Us and Three Amigos! (1986), pictures that were often clever but also seemed derivative of earlier films and genres and too full of in-jokes and cameos by Landis's friends. Of these subsequent films, only Coming to America (1988), teaming him again with Eddie Murphy, gave Landis a measure of his earlier success. He ended the decade on this slow fall from his former box-office fame and remained most renowned for the Twilight Zone disaster. His work epitomized the brashness of megabuck studio filmmaking in which explosions, car crashes, and a general vulgarity of tone became prized assets for which the studios would spend millions.\n\nJon Peters and Peter Guher\n\nNever as powerful Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, Peters and Guber had a fitful, precarious cachet in eighties Hollywood because of their (sometimes remote) association with three of the decade s big hits: The Color Purple (1985), Rain Man (1988), and Batman (1989). Unlike Simpson and Bruckheimer, though, they were not hands-on producers but instead tended to be packagers of scripts, directors, and stars, and in this regard their work personified the importance of marketing in eighties Hollywood.\n\nEarly in their careers, Peters and Guber showed the flair for promotion that gained them prominence in the industry. Promoted from Barbara Striesand's hairdresser-lover to the producer of her film A Star Is Born (1976), Peters helped design its ad campaign featuring a nude embrace between Streisand and co-star Kris Kristofferson. The picture grossed over $90 million, and its success enabled Peters to form in 1977 his own production company, the Jon Peters Organization. Guber's breakthrough hit was The Deep (1977), based on a novel about sunken treasure by Jaws author Peter Benchley. Guber based the film's marketing around actress Jacqueline Bisset's wet T-shirt, and the picture, despite its mediocrity, became the second biggest box-office film of 1977. \"That T-shirt made me a rich man,\" Guber remarked.21\n\nIn 1980, Peters and Guber joined forces as joint producers at PolyGram Pictures, where they produced a string of films in 1981 that generally failed to find much popular acceptance: King of the Mountain, The Pursuit of D. B. Cooper, Endless Love, and An American Werewolf in London. As a result, PolyGram's European financiers sought to cut their loses (up to $80 million) and get out of the movie business. Peters and Guber left the company, set up shop as the Guber-Peters Co. in 1982, and found a home at Warner Bros., which agreed to finance and distribute their productions. Nearly all of the initial films were box-office losers: Vision Quest (1985), The Legend of Billie Jean (1985), Clue (1985), Head Office (1985), Youngblood (1986), The Clan of the Cave Bear (1986). The exception was The Color Purple (1985), directed by Steven Spielberg. Guber-Peters were associated with this picture because they owned the rights to the novel, but Spielberg had them barred from the set during filming and never collaborated with them on the project.22 Nevertheless, Guber and Peters treated Color Purple as the jewel in their crown.\n\nAnother string of box-office disappointments (Who's That Girl [1987], Innerspace [1987], Caddyshack II [1988]) was offset by The Witches of Eastwick, the sixth biggest revenue-generating film of 1987. Director George Miller wanted a low-key and witty film about a clash between the devil and three small-town women, but Peters pushed aggressively for a heavy dose of special effects. Peters won, and the resulting picture was a box-office winner.\n\nAfter a precipitous attempt to buy the remains of MGM/UA from Kirk Kerkorian in 1988, Peters and Guber had two huge successes that strengthened their reputation as hit makers. Rain Man was the top film of 1988's box office; as with The Color Purple, however, Peters and Guber had a stake in the script but were absentee producers on the project itself, visiting the set only once.23 By contrast, Batman (1989), a huge moneymaker for Warners, Peters took a more active role, recruiting Jack Nicholson to the project, urging director Tim Burton to add more action and romance, and helping design the very successful ad campaign.\n\nDespite their uneven track record, Sony felt that Guber and Peters were essential for the success of its newly acquired Columbia Pictures. Accordingly, the electronics giant bought out their Warners contract for $200 million and appointed them to run Columbia Pictures. Sony's action was widely criticized as excessive and unnecessary, but it seemed to be a formal acknowledgment of the producer-as-superstar status that had become such a distinguishing feature of eighties Hollywood. But their five-year tenure at Columbia proved to be a disaster. Prominent box-office bombs—Bugsy (1991), Hudson Hawk (1991), City of Joy (1992), The Last Action Hero (1993), I'll Do Anything (1994), Geronimo (1993)—led to Guber's firing as Columbia head and Sony's posting of a $3.2 billion loss in its second quarter 1994. An era of overspending on inflated productions helped produce this massive loss and brought an end to Guber's power-broker posting.\n\nIronically, given the poor showing of their Columbia films, Guber and Peters's strengths had always been in marketing and promotion, and their regard for films as revenue-generating commodities was certainly in synch with the predominant thinking in the majors' executive suites. But their uneven track record contained only a few prominent hits (on some of which they had a distant association), and this mixed performance ensured that Guber and Peters remained occasional players in the highly uncertain and unstable world of the hit-making studio executive.\n\nRobert Zemeckis\n\nA Spielberg protégé, Robert Zemeckis directed several of the 1980s' top hits (Back to the Future, Who Framed Roger Rarbit, both Spielberg productions), and he moved to the forefront of special effects filmmaking by virtue of Roger Rabbit and, in the 1990s, Death Becomes Her (1992) and Forrest Gump (1994). A university film school attendee, Zemeckis' award-winning student film, Field of Honor, earned Spielberg's attention, and Zemeckis subsequently co-wrote the story for Spielberg's 1941 (1979). The following year, he directed a fast, funny satire of car salesmen in the Spielberg-produced Used Cars (1980), which was released to poor box office ($5 million in rentals). The industry tagged Used Cars, Zemeckis's earlier I Wanna Hold Your Hand (1978), and 1941 as failures, he was temporarily unemployable. No studio would touch his screenplay for a film called \"Back to the Future\"! As a result, he was unable to land a directing job for several years.\n\nBut he returned with a picture that attracted a great deal of attention. Romancing the Stone, produced by actor Michael Douglas, earned $36 million in rentals, placing it in the top ten for 1984. The film was an old-fashioned, lighthearted adventureromance about unlikely lovers (Douglas and Kathleen Turner) in peril in South America, and it contained none of the gadgetry and special effects for which Zemeckis's work would become known. He passed on doing the sequel (The Jewel of the Nile [1985]) and concentrated on his Back to the Future project, about young Marty McFly's (Michael J. Fox) comic adventures time-traveling in a sporty DeLorean auto.\n\nBack to the Future (1985) is one of the quintessential eighties films. Tremendously successful, it spawned two sequels (1989, 1990), and it epitomized the collective yearning for a pristine past that the Reagan years had defined as a core national aspiration. Dr. Brown (Christopher Lloyd), Marty's loony inventor friend, creates a time machine that enables Marty to travel back in time to his hometown in 1955, where he meets his parents when they were high school teens. To ensure that their future (and his present life in the eighties) will come true as he has known it, Marty has to act as matchmaker, encouraging their courtship. Oedipal complications ensue, however, when his mother develops a crush on Marty, whom she perceives as an attractive and mysterious visitor in town. Downplaying this narrative wrinkle, Zemeckis concentrates on Marty's efforts to make the past right (i.e., get his mom and dad to fall in love), much as President Reagan was exhorting the nation to return to its collective past in order to find its cultural bearings amid an uncertain present. As in Reagan's rhetoric, the past here is a more shining and idealistic time than is the present. Marty's hometown in the eighties is blighted with litter, homeless drunks sleeping in public, and porno movies at the corner theater. By contrast, in the fifties the town was spotless and bursting with the aspirations of youth. Moreover, as Reagan urged the nation, Marty uses the past to remake the present. At the end of the film, he learns that his intervention into his parents' lives in 1955 has made them happier, more self-fulfilled, and successful in the eighties. In these ways, Back to the Future venerates small-town America in terms consistent with the rhetoric of the Reagan presidency (while, nevertheless, aiming a few jokes at Reagan for being an actor-turned-president). The film owed much of its success to this artful manipulation of the eighties Zeitgeist (shared by another of the period's hits, Field of Dreams [1989]), but its popularity was also a function of its warm and affectionate portrait of Marty's deepening involvement with his parents and his discovery of the conditions that made them who they are.\n\nBack to the Future commenced the special effects turn in Zemeckis's filmmaking, an emphasis that would become one of his distinguishing directorial characteristics. Dr. Brown's time-traveling auto leaps through the decades in a burst of light and leaves a double trail of flame in its wake. To create these and other effects, Zemeckis began a collaboration with Industrial Light and Magic that continued on his subsequent films and produced a series of Academy Awards for best effects (Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Death Becomes Her, and Forrest Gump).\n\nPreceding the digital effects revolution, Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988), Zemeckis's next film, was the climactic achievement of traditional compositing and matte effects work.24 Its seamless blend of live-action and animated footage, in a tale of a private eye (Bob Hoskins) investigating a crime in Toontown amid its cartoon denizens, would today be accomplished through computer animation and compositing of all-digital elements. But such was the skill with which Zemeckis and ILM executed the blend of live action and animation, and so witty were the results, that Roger and his cohorts became the year's most popular film characters.\n\nZemeckis carefully integrated the effects work with a clever story that linked disparate styles: film noir and famous cartoon characters from classic animated entertainment. Eddie Valiant, the private eye, works 1947 Hollywood, and like noir heroes he's haunted by past trauma. A cartoon character killed his brother. \"Just like a toon to drop a safe on a guy's head,\" a cop mutters about the deed. Like Jake Gittes in Chinatown, Valiant is drawn into a complex web of crime hinging on a corrupt land deal. To investigate he must return to Toontown, where the cartoon characters who work in Hollywood movies live and where he'll confront the scars of his past. Against this noir tableau, the film introduces a gallery of cartoon greats (mainly from Warners and Disney films) who make nostalgic and funny cameo appearances: Bugs Bunny, Tweety Bird, Dumbo, Porky Pig, Pinocchio, Donald Duck, Yosemite Sam, Mickey Mouse, and, in her black-and-white glory, Betty Boop. To these old favorites the film adds two new animated characters. Roger is a well-meaning but buffoonish and long-suffering rabbit who lacks Bugs's impish savoir faire, and his wife, Jessica Rabbit, is an impossibly voluptuous human, voiced by Kathleen Turner, and given the film's best line of dialogue: \"I'm not bad. I'm just drawn that way.\"\n\nThe film's extraordinary accomplishment lies in the unprecedented sophistication of its integration of live action and 2D animation. The film featured 1,031 optical shots where live action and animated footage were composited together, and this material was photographed using the eight-perforation, horizontal VistaVision process. With its larger frame size, VistaVision provided optimal clarity and resolution to offset generational loss during optical printing (which necessitated the rephotographing of layered elements in order to create the final composited image).\n\nZemeckis, cinematographer Dean Cundey, and the ILM effects artists aimed to give the 2D animation a compelling three-dimensional look because the aesthetic conceit of the film is that Bob Hoskins and the other performers are interacting with the cartoon characters. To accomplish this, Zemeckis and Cundey resolved to shoot the film with complex camera moves and lighting textures (smoke, fog) that typically are not used in cartoons. For example, when Valiant goes to the Ink and Paint Club to watch Jessica sing, its cartoon patrons move behind the room's curtain of smoke. To make it easier for the actors and the cinematographer, the shots were rehearsed with full-figure models standing in for Roger, Jessica, and the other toon characters. Lighting, camera moves, and the actors' performances were established with reference to these figures, which were then removed during shooting. For the sequence where Valiant visits Toontown and Hoskins was the blue-screen element (acting against a blue screen for subsequent compositing with an animated landscape), the animators' layouts of the background were matted in on a TV monitor, enabling Zemeckis to visualize the full shot and plan camera and character moves.
