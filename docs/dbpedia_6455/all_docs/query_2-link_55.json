        "text": "By Hank Reineke\n\nOne reality of being too overly genre-focused in our home video collecting is that too often the lines of demarcation blur. This truism surfaces when discussing the brief 1944-1946 “horror” film legacy of Republic Pictures. One might ask how many authentic “horror” films rather than moody “mystery” pics did Republic actually produce during this period? With the understanding my own view is arguable, I’d suggest the studio produced only six horror-chillers that ticked most of the genre’s boxes: The Lady and the Monster (1944), The Vampire’s Ghost (1945), The Phantom Speaks (1945), Woman Who Came Back (1945) The Catman of Paris (1946), and Valley of the Zombies (1946).\n\nOthers might disagree and, hey, I’m certainly willing to revise the above list. Truth be told, there’s seemingly no consensus even among experts. In 1999, film historian Tom Weaver examined six Republic titles in his tome Poverty Row Horrors!: Monogram, PRC, and Republic Horror Films of the Forties (MacFarland). A decade and a half later Brian McFadden would publish Republic Horrors: the Serial Studio’s Chillers, the book promising an exclusive study of ten of the studio’s horror-film catalog.\n\nThe latter tome is a worthwhile read, though reminds the studio released few outright horror pictures in the 1940s. Of the ten films chosen for examination by McFadden, only six are genuine horrors in the “classic” sense. The remaining four (The Fatal Witness, The Madonna’s Secret, The Girl Who Dared, and London Blackout Murders) are traditional mysteries with a mix of atmospheric fog and general eeriness. (Weaver also includes The Girl Who Dared, so perhaps I’m missing something).\n\nIn any case, U.S. collectors wishing to revisit Republic’s catalog of Golden Age horrors have reason to rejoice. Kino Lorber has packaged a Blu-ray quartet of long- neglected films as part of their Republic Pictures Horror Collection. This new two-disc set features approximately two-hundred and seventy-five minutes of vintage monochrome - and occasionally quirky - monster-movie goodness. The four films included are: The Lady and the Monster, The Phantom Speaks, The Catman of Paris and Valley of the Zombies.\n\nSome collectors will find Kino a bit late out of the gate with this release. In summer of 2021 Australia’s Imprint Films published its handsome Silver Screams Cinema set. That box wasn’t studio-specific: it peculiarly mixed a selection of seven films produced by three different outfits (1944-1957): four Republic’s (The Lady and the Monster, The Phantom Speaks, The Vampire’s Ghost, Valley of the Zombies), two from 20th Century Fox (She Devil and The Unknown Terror), and one Monogram programmer (Return of the Ape Man).\n\nOf course, Imprint too was late to the game with its publishing of several of these titles. The now defunct Olive Films had already given us singular Blu-rays of three later featured on the Imprint set (Return of the Ape Man, She Devil and The Vampire’s Ghost). But it was Imprint’s inclusion of several films from the Republic vault - Valley of the Zombies, The Phantom Speaks and The Lady and the Monster - that compelled folks like myself to pre-order despite the combined pain of the price of the box set, overseas shipping costs, and title double-dipping.\n\nDespite my enthusiasm, the Imprint box set was odd in its archiving. While the set contained a trio of long sought after offerings from Republic, curiously missing was Lesley Selander’s The Catman of Paris. Imprint would later issue that film as a standalone Blu in 2023. Happily, this new set from Kino somewhat corrects that omission by neatly gathering four earnest Republic chillers together. More frustratingly, Kino omits Selander’s The Vampire’s Ghost from their set. For those of us who own a copy of the 2017 Olive Films Blu such omission is forgivable. Perhaps if this edition sells well, Kino will treat us to a second Republic set, one that will include The Vampire’s Ghost and Woman Who Came Back – and, yes, The Girl Who Dared - with an additional atmospheric Republic mystery to buffer. Fingers crossed.\n\nI’m not complaining. We’ve enjoyed access to a glorious wave of rare-film home video releases over the last few years, and for that I’m entirely grateful. Decades ago I gave up hope of ever seeing any legitimate home video issues from the Paramount-owned Republic Pictures horror catalog. So, similar to other starved aficionados of 1940s horror-mysteries, I sought out serviceable - if hazy - gray-market bootlegs of Republic’s catalog films. If nothing else such bootlegs - sourced from well-worn 16mm television prints - helped fill empty slots in our home video collections.\n\nRepublic Pictures is often regarded as one of Hollywood’s “Poverty Row” studios. That’s not quite fair: both talent and production at Republic was often of high-caliber despite low budgets. The economically-financed pictures are understandable when one considers the studio had produced more than a thousand features and serials since its 1935 inception. Some historians dismissively compare Republic’s penny-pinching output with that of Monogram Pictures, another maligned purveyor of 1940s low-rent westerns, horror and mystery pics. It’s true the Monogram pics are the better remembered of the two. The Monograms are not necessarily “better” films but, more often than not, would cast such genre stars as Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi, George Zucco, Lionel Atwill and John Carradine in villainous roles.\n\nThe reasons Republic’s horror pics have too long been glossed over is threefold. For starters, they had been almost entirely unavailable to view for decades. The films of Monogram and PRC have otherwise long been available to fans – even if only through dupey, home video releases of public domain status. In contrast, the Republic horror pics have remained almost entirely commercially inaccessible for decades. Paramount, the company that absorbed Republic’s catalog, appeared disinterested in making them available.\n\nSecondly, while Republic’s wildly popular horse operas featured such personalities as Gene Autry, Roy Rogers and John Wayne, their horror pics offered no horror stars of comparable marquee value. Republic tendered Carl Esmond, Ian Keith, and Tom Powers as primary boogeymen in their chillers: good actors all, but none with names of renown amongst horror movie fans. Had Republic’s horrors featured walkthroughs of Lugosi or Karloff, there’s little doubt there would have been more interest in getting these films out to fans and collectors.\n\nThirdly, Republic was late to board of the horror-film train. The studio only really began to test the market when public interest in horror fare was clearly dimming. Though Universal famously released The Wolfman in 1941, they also offered such disguised mysteries as Horror Island and The Black Cat as chillers that same year. By 1946 even the Universal reliables as Dracula, Frankenstein and the mummy Kharis were absent, replaced on screen by such fog-shrouded whodunits as The Cat Creeps and She-Wolf of London. The iconic Universal monsters would return in 1948, but only to serve as comedic foils to Abbott and Costello.\n\nRepublic’s first horror pic entry, George Sherman’s The Lady and the Monster (1944) is, logically, the first of the four pics offered in Kino’s collection. The Lady and the Monster features a grim Erich von Stroheim as the humorless, lovesick mad scientist Professor Franz Mueller. The film’s script - by Dane Lussier and Frederick Kohner - is based loosely on Curt Siodmak’s 1942 novel Donovan’s Brain. The physical brain of a deceased plane crash victim manages to take telepathic refuge in the cranium of Dr. Patrick Cory (Richard Arlen), Mueller’s assistant. The endgame of Mueller’s experiment is to assist a bit of post-mortem legal wrangling and whereabouts of the deceased’s fortune. There’s a romantic-entangling subplot as well.\n\nThe film features the former Czech Olympic figure-skater Vera Ralston as leading lady. Ralston plays Janice Farrell who, to the consternation of Mueller, has googly eyes on Cory, not him. Ralston is a beauty, without doubt: but as an actress she’s hamstrung, delivering her dialogue phonetically. The commentary track on The Lady and the Monster is provided by comic book artist and horror enthusiast Stephen R. Bissette and author Gordon Michael Dobbs. They explain Ralston’s casting as the decision of Republic founder and president, Herbert Yates. Though married and the father of four, Yates fell hard for Ralston, the ingénue forty years his junior. Having chosen to abandon his wife and family for the skater, Yates was driven to transform Ralston from figure-skater to movie star.\n\nThe commentary of Bissette and Dobbs is entertaining and informative: they run down the filmographies of cast and crew and borrow bits from Tom Weaver’s interviews with the film’s surviving players, and suggest The Lady and the Monster is technically an “A” picture in its mounting. Director Sherman, who from 1938 through 1941 was churning out nine-to-ten films a year for Republic, professionally delivers a very worthwhile horror/sci-fi pic, one abetted handsomely by cinematographer John Alton’s brilliant photography. The Lady and the Monster did well enough for Republic that the studio chose to greenlight a double-dose of horror in 1945: The Vampire’s Ghost (again, not included in this set) and The Phantom Speaks.\n\nRichard Arlen (as Daily Globe reporter Matt Fraser) again gets top billing in The Phantom Speaks but, in all honesty, the film’s featured player is Stanley Powers as Dr. Paul Renwick. Renwick is introduced as a doctor of “psychic science.” His particular interest is with the cross-pollination of the physical and the spiritual. Can one’s spirit be sustained following physical death, he mulls? Renwick believes it can and has even written a book on the subject. He purposely sends a copy, stupidly, to Harvey Bogardus (Tom Powers), an unrepentant murderer scheduled to die in the electric chair.\n\nJust prior to the execution, Renwick visits Bogardus in his cell, asking the killer to agree to an experiment. Though it would have been advisable that the doctor had chosen a less unsavory character to test his theory on, Renwick finds Bogardus an excellent candidate. The murderer is of strong-will and Renwick needs a subject who’s “will is strong enough to reach back from the grave.” Though he admits to having read Renwick’s book, Bogardus finds it the work of a “crackpot.” On the other hand, Bogardus really has nothing to lose. “I’m not through yet,” Bogardus growls as he’s led to the electric chair. In this, he’s mostly correct.\n\nUnfortunately for Dr. Renwick - and others soon dispatched – Bogardus is so strong-willed that following his execution he manages to subjugate the mind of the doctor himself. Renwick is now the conduit for the criminal’s vengeful bidding. Detectives are puzzling over all of the dead bodies piling up during the course of a three-month murder spree. The killings appear to be the work of an executed man, one “too dead to be going around shooting people, unless he’s a ghost.” Which, in a sense, he is.\n\nThe Phantom Speaks, written for the screen from an original story by John K. Butler, is a rather downbeat affair, a film ending on an unusually grim and gloomy note. That said, it’s also one of the more engaging films in this set, having been capably helmed by veteran Republic director John English. The film’s audio commentator, Tim Lucas, notes that English was a director of talent, having previously helmed Republic’s “best action serials, hands down.” The Phantom Speaks is one of those curious horror-gangster picture hybrids of the 1930s and 40s. It’s in the vein of Michael Curtiz’s The Walking Dead (Warner Bros., 1936), Nick Grinde’s The Man They Could Not Hang (Columbia, 1939), and Arthur Lubin’s Black Friday (Universal, 1940).\n\nAs with others in this set, the running time of The Phantom Speaks clocks in just about right. It’s not overlong and the story moves along at a good clip with a good sampling of cinematic bumps and surprises. The critic from Variety got this one correct in their 1945 appraisal. The trade offered the pic as, “A spine-tingling sadistic chiller that has its odd moments.” I’ve no argument there.\n\nJust as Universal’s reign as the preeminent horror-movie studio was winding down, Republic’s was revving up. In early May of 1945, the Los Angeles Times reported executives at Republic, “encouraged by the current success of The Vampire’s Ghost and The Phantom Speaks,” were planning a new pair of chillers. Under the watchful eye of producer William O’ Sullivan, the studio’s newest horror pics, promisingly titled The Catman of Paris and The Valley of the Zombies, were to “be sold to exhibitors as a pair.”\n\nThough it’s not a great film, I hold nostalgic affection for Lesley Selander’s The Catman of Paris. Parisian police detectives believe the sinister Catman prowling about is none other than the handsome, best-selling novelist Charles Regnier (Carl Esmond). The French government is annoyed by Regnier’s most recent work of fiction, Fraudulent Justice as his narrative mirrors a true-life criminal trial of dubious prosecution - a secretive judicial hearing that aroused public mistrust of the government.\n\nRegnier has returned to Paris following a fateful trip to the tropics. The writer now suffers regular headaches which bring about amnesia and awakens his inner-demons. During such sessions Regnier is visited by hallucinogenic visions of violent weather storms and of a mysterious black cat. Regnier’s patron, Henri Borchard (Douglas Dumbrille), suggests his friend’s fragile mental state is due to having contracted a fever in the tropics. There’s also a bit of astrological hokum threaded into the script as well.\n\nBoth Bouchard and Regnier’s publisher Paul Audet (Francis Pierlot) are concerned. Two gruesome murders have taken place in which their client Regnier appears tangentially involved: the publishing house fears his reputation and book sales might plummet and bankrupt them. The Catman’s most recent victim - high-society fiancé Marguerite Duvall (Adele Mara), had been suspiciously jilted by Regnier so he could enjoy a new romance with publisher’s daughter Marie (Lenore Aubert). Marie has fallen for the dashing Regnier and is completely convinced of his innocence. That is until she herself is chased through the misty evening by a cloak and top-hatted Catman prowling for blood.\n\nThough the film would eventually be paired with Valley of the Zombies, The Catman of Paris was initially sent out on release with John English’s better-received ice-skating musical-mystery Murder in the Music Hall (featuring Vera Ralston, naturally). I can’t comment on the latter pic (I never saw it), but I can offer that director Philip Ford’s Valley of the Zombies briskly zips along just shy of sixty minutes in running time. The title is a bit of a misnomer. If you are a fan of Victor Halperin’s White Zombie (1932) or George Romero’s Night of the Living Dead (1968) or the AMC series The Walking Dead, you might be disappointed by this one.\n\nThere’s really no flesh-eating zombies rambling about, only the cloaked visage of Ormand Murks (Ian Keith). A half-decade earlier Murks was committed to a mental asylum by brain specialist Dr. Rufus Maynard (Charles Trowbridge). Believing Murks suffered from a “pathological” disorder of the brain, Maynard and assistant had attempted to correct this issue through a delicate operation. Unfortunately for all concerned, they lose their patient on the operating table... or at least it appears so. Afterwards, the hospital in which Maynard labors is inexplicably being robbed of its refrigerated blood plasma holdings.\n\nIt’s a crime no one can reasonably explain… that is until Murks suddenly resurfaces one night. He re-introduces himself (“I’m a strange man, Doctor…”) to the disbelieving Maynard. Murks explains he now exists in an “intermediate stage” somewhere between life and death. He advises Maynard of having had visited the “Valley of the Zombies” where, through “voodoo rites and devil’s potions” he was made immortal… with a caveat. To sustain his existence, he now requires periodic feedings of fresh blood plasma. So Murks is mostly a vampire, though one with a difference. Count Dracula can be indiscriminate in his source of refreshment. Murks, on the other hand, requires drinking only of the red claret that matches his own blood-type.\n\nThe police detectives believe Maynard’s associates, Dr. Terry Evans (Robert Livingston) and his nurse-girlfriend Susan Drake (Lorna Gray), are somehow involved in the doctor’s disappearance. Looking to clear themselves of any crime, the pair unwisely go off on their own to investigate. Suspecting the late Ormand Murks is somehow involved, the pair prowl about – in dead of night, of course – amongst woods, mausoleum and creepy estate of the Murks’ family.\n\nIn only his third primary directing role, Philip Ford delivers a pretty top-notch and entertaining horror yarn. This one features the requisite clutching hands, candelabra prowls, and mysterious fiend lurking about in the shadows. The script of brothers Dorrell and Stuart McGowan is tight and sassy in construction. As the distressed Susan Drake, actress Gray gets all the best lines of light-comedy relief. Third-billed (and menacingly under-lit) actor Ian Keith chews the scenery, deliciously emoting and dishing out the ghoulish dialogue provided. David Del Valle in his commentary describes Keith’s one-off performance as shining bright as one of the “great lights of horror.” I cannot disagree.\n\nAll four films in this collection from Kino prove that Republic’s spooky offerings are just as good – and sometimes superior – to the horror/mystery B-pics that Universal was releasing in the 1940s. The audio commentaries on both The Catman of Paris and Valley of the Zombies are provided by author David Del Valle and producer Miles Hunter are worthwhile listens, both informative and well researched. However, and while I know I’m in the minority here, perhaps an informative booklet could provide all annotation required. (Hey, I’m just doing my part to get writers a bit more paid (?) work).\n\nThe versions offered here have been reportedly mastered from Paramount’s own HD masters from 4K scans. These monochrome films look stunning, though there are some small issues present in The Catman of Paris: the negative used was from the studio’s 1956 re-release print, not of the ’46 original. Although the scan is not pristine - there’s a bit of speckling present throughout and moments of minor image jittering - for the most part the film looks quite crisp and not a deal-breaker. Should this set perform well, I’m very much looking forward to a Republic Horror/Mystery set, Vol. II from Kino. This set is clearly a must-have release for aficionados of Golden Age horror films.\n\nClick here to order from Amazon.\n\nBy Lee Pfeiffer\n\nIn the early 1960s director John Frankenheimer emerged as one of Hollywood's most exciting talents. Consider the remarkably diverse films he made in a four year period between 1962 and 1966: \"Birdman of Alcatraz\", a somewhat fictionalized but extremely compelling prison drama with an Oscar nominated performance by Burt Lancaster; the classic thriller \"The Manchurian Candidate\" which perfectly analyzed the type of paranoia that still defines American politics today; \"Seven Days in May\", yet another classic political thriller that also retains its relevance; \"The Train\", a superb WWII film about the French Resistance attempting to thwart a Nazi's theft of priceless national treasures, \"Seconds\", Frankenheimer's brilliant and underrated \"Twilight Zone\"-like chiller and \"Grand Prix\", the big budget, star-packed racing extravaganza that was unlike any of his previous films (it was in color, for one). For a while, it seemed Frankenheimer could do no wrong. However, by the late 1960s, he began to stumble. His forthy comedy \"The Extraordinary Seaman\" was, by any rational evaluation, a complete disaster and was deemed largely unreleasable by MGM. His next major effort, \"The Gypsy Moths\" reunited him with Burt Lancaster, star of some of his greatest successes. However, despite having many merits, the film failed to click with audiences and critics. Suddenly, Frankenheimer was no longer the \"Golden Boy\" who represented the new age of daring young American directors. In the mid-1970s, he got two more bites at the apple with \"French Connection II\" and the terrorist thriller \"Black Sunday\". He delivered the goods artistically but both films did not amass the anticipated grosses and Frankenheimer was increasingly relegated to helming middling films in return for a quick pay check. He later confessed that some of his problems were self-imposed due to his dependency on alcohol. As his feature film career deteriorated, Frankenheimer found salvation through directing acclaimed, high profile TV movies that saw him win four Emmy Awards. He did have one late career theatrical hit with the spy thriller \"Ronin\" in 1998. He passed away in 2002, having had the satisfaction of seeing his work re-evaluated by a new generation of critics with \"Seconds\", in particular, finally winning the type of praise that had eluded reviewers when initially released in 1966.\n\nOne of Frankenheimer's least-discussed films, \"The Fourth War\", is currently streaming on Screenpix, available through Amazon Prime for additional fee each month. The movie went into production at the very end of the Cold War. By the time it was released in 1990, the Soviet Union was on the verge of collapse, which is probably why the audience is informed that the story takes place in 1988. Although the film is set up to be a grudge match between two military tough guys on opposite sides of the political spectrum, the central character is Col. Jack Knowles (Roy Scheider), a spit-and-polish veteran U.S. Army officer who arrives at his new command, a remote base on the border of West Germany and Soviet-dominated Czechoslovakia. Knowles is a complete hard ass with Patton-like disciplinary measures he doesn't hesitate to enact for any soldier who doesn't abide by his rules. But we learn later that Knowles is a bit of a hypocrite. Seems he has a reputation for being a loose cannon who consistently defies orders and regulations in order to carry out procedures his own way. He's been booted from several commands and this is his last chance. It's an opportunity that has been afforded him by his Vietnam War buddy Gen. Hackworth (Harry Dean Stanton), whose life Knowles saved back in the day. Knowles shows his gratitude by immediately violating orders and taking a small patrol past the \"no go\" boundary that abuts the Czech border. By happenstance, the group witnesses a disturbing sight: a dissident is racing toward the West German border over snow covered fields with Soviet soldiers relentlessly hunting him down on horseback. The man almost makes it to freedom but is shot dead by the Soviets. Outraged, Knowles pulls his pistol and is about to initiate a shooting war. His second in command, Lt. Col. Clark (Tim Reid) realizes the international implications that would follow and convinces Knowles to holster his weapon- but Knowles is still outraged. He tosses a snowball at the Soviet commanding officer, Col. Valachev (Jurgen Prochnow). This juvenile act of protest will lead to a relentless war of wills between both men, each of whom studies the other's history.\n\nBefore long, Knowles is making surreptitious nocturnal one-man missions behind the border. At first he causes mischief by holding Soviet guards at gunpoint and humiliating them. But his actions become increasingly risky, culminating in his destroying a guard tower and nearly killing the men in it. Valachev begins to respond in kind, sneaking over the border to humiliate Knowles. By this point, Lt. Col. Clark suspects that Knowles is becoming irrational and carrying out forbidden missions. General Clark dresses down his old friend and tells him that if he makes one more slip-up, he won't be able to save him from being drummed out of the military. Knowles is momentarily shaken but can't resist resuming his activities over the border. On one such \"mission\", he meets a desperate young woman who is trying to sneak back into Czechoslovakia. She's Elena (Lara Harris), who explains she has to rescue her little daughter who is being cared for by her grandmother. Elena says that her mother is now too ill to take care of the child and she worries that the girl will be placed in a state home. The gruff Knowles is moved by her plight and agrees to help her in her quest- a promise that ultimately leads to dramatic consequences and a one-on-one confrontation with Valachev that could reignite the Cold War.\n\nWhile \"The Fourth War\" is not of a caliber of John Frankenheimer's early classics, the film has much to recommend about it. The movie did not make much of an impact when it first opened and has remained under the radar screen ever since. It needs a few champions and I'm happy to be one of them. For one, it's intelligently written and presents two interesting characters, though we never learn much about Valachev. Knowles, on the other hand, is an emotional basket case hiding behind a tough guy persona. He's friendless and desperate to find meaning in life. In one poignant scene, he celebrates his birthday in his quarters, accompanied only by a bottle of booze and a kid's party hat on his head as he tries vainly to have a civil conversation by phone with a grown son who is clearly not enamored with him. He's a tragic, fascinating figure- a small scale General Curtis Lemay, who has channeled his demons into a personal crusade against Communism. Scheider gives a terrific performance and gets fine support from Prochnow, Reid and Harris, whose character provides the catalyst for a clever plot twist late in the film. Harry Dean Stanton is terrific especially in the sequence in which he locks horns with Scheider. It's riveting all the way. Director Frankenheimer turns the Canadian frozen tundra into a convincing replica of the Eastern European landscape and milks a good deal of suspense from the proceedings, culminating in a spectacular, testosterone-laced battle between the two antagonists in full view of their respective armies.\n\n\"The Fourth War\" is well worth a look.\n\nThe film is currently streaming on Screenpix.\n\nBy Lee Pfeiffer\n\nGenerally speaking, you wouldn't visit the Cinema Retro web site to find information about themed attractions in major cities. However, when we were extended the opportunity to view RiseNY just off of Times Square, I couldn't resist visiting what is described as an \"immersive film experience\". Located at 160 West 45th Street, the museum is a unique concept. It's not competing with the grandeur of Gotham's famed museums and that is part of its appeal. It's a fun experience that can comfortably be viewed in 60 to 90 minutes depending upon crowd size and your interest in specific displays. The museum provides an overview of New York City history. I grew up back in the Stone Age right across the river in Jersey City, so from an early age Manhattan was a kind of gritty playground for my friends and I. Consequently, I had a bit of a smug attitude that arose from the expectation that I would probably know all the facts that are presented in the museum. I was happily wrong. Even if you're a seasoned New Yorker, you'll find the historical anecdotes quite enlightening, from the arrival of the immigrant waves in the early 20th century to the larger-than-life figures who have populated the city. This museum experience is not akin to that of visiting an art museum because RiseNY utilizes video and audio components in very creative and effective ways. For example, things get off on the right track (literally) with an immersive subway train experience. No, you don't get mugged, but, rather you speed along through the underground tunnels at high speed in a highly enjoyable experience. We can hear famed Mayor LaGuardia as he indulges in his practice of reading the Sunday funny papers to children on the radio. Legendary band leader Guy Lombardo and his Royal Canadians orchestra are shown celebrating the New Year's Eve bash for 1957. In a room dedicated to how New York City has been depicted on film, you can relish brief clips from such landmark movies as \"The French Connection\", \"Midnight Cowboy\", \"Dog Day Afternoon\" and \"The Godfather\". Broadway is celebrated, as well, with an array of original costumes from such popular shows as \"Wicked\", \"The Lion King\" and \"Hamilton\". There is a room dedicated to T.V. shows set in Gotham, with an original Kramer shirt on display from \"Seinfeld\". There's also a recreation of the legendary kitchen set from \"The Honeymooners\". The New York music scene is well represented from The Beatles' landmark 1964 appearance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" to the influence of rap and hip hop artists. There are also original guitars on display that belonged to Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen (although we'll split hairs and point out that while The Boss has had a great history in NYC, he's still a Jersey Shore guy at heart.)\n\nThe finale is truly grand as you are seated in an immersive 8K movie ride that simulates flying you at high speed over New York City. It really is thrilling, as attested to by the shouts of approval by participants. The experience ends on a nice touch...you can exit for a photo op atop a replica of Lady Liberty's torch.\n\nWe didn't know what to expect from the experience but suffice it to say our expectations were exceeded. RiseNY is a truly fun experience for the entire family. It fulfills the goal of any museum by educating attendees in a highly entertaining and unique manner.\n\nClick here to visit web site and to purchase tickets.\n\nFollowing our visit, we reached out to management to provide more details about RiseNY.\n\nHere is the Q&A:\n\nHow did this concept come about and who came up with the initial idea?\n\nFor over 20 years, Running Subway Productions, the creative force behind\n\nRiseNY, has been crafting unforgettable experiences, touring exhibitions, and\n\ntheatrical shows. Our CEO, James Sanna, envisioned a destination where\n\nvisitors could explore the rich history of New York City, its cultural impact, and\n\nthe influential discoveries that shaped the city's key industries. Partnering\n\nwith Brogent Technologies, known for their groundbreaking 4D flying theater,\n\nwe seized the opportunity to merge these visions. We then found the perfect\n\nlocation for it -a beautiful space in the heart of the theater district, easily\n\naccessible by all subway lines. Renowned documentary filmmaker Ric Burns\n\nalso joined our creative team and created a wonderful short intro film to our\n\nexperience - and the award-winning actor Jeff Goldblum came on board to\n\nnarrate it. The result is a unique experience - a love letter to New York that\n\ncombines interactive elements, a short film, museum-style galleries, and a\n\nthrilling ride all in one.\n\nWhat were the deciding factors in terms of the people and events to be\n\ncommemorated in the exhibition?\n\nWe were fortunate to bring on partner museums and cultural institutions to\n\ncurate the exhibition and ensure the authenticity of the history and objects\n\nwe are presenting. For instance, The Tribeca Festival partners with us on the\n\nFilm gallery, and they helped us curate a showcase of the most iconic\n\nmoments from beloved films set in New York. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\n\ncame on board for the music gallery, and the Museum of American Finance,\n\nThe Museum at FIT, Radio Hall of Fame and Museum of Broadcast\n\nCommunication helped us curate the Finance, Fashion, Radio, and TV\n\ngalleries.\n\nIn terms of the original props on display, will these be changed out occasionally for\n\nnew material or are they envisioned as being permanently on display?\n\nOur amazing museum and organization partners who have generously\n\ncontributed props and artifacts to the exhibition, and we refresh our displays\n\nregularly. We have certain pieces that remain in the permanent collection, for\n\nexample, in our Film gallery we have a kinetoscope which was introduced by\n\nThomas Edison in 1983 and was the first device created to show film - it's\n\ninteractive so our guests can step back in time and see what those first\n\nmoving images in history looked like. In terms of new material, we most\n\nrecently added to our Fashion gallery a dress worn by Taylor Swift on The\n\nDavid Letterman Show.\n\nWould there ever be plans to expand this concept to other major cities?\n\nExpanding Rise to other major cities is definitely an exciting possibility for the\n\nfuture! We have no doubt that they would not only showcase amazing\n\nexhibits, but also encourage communities to discover and appreciate their\n\nown city's rich cultural history.\n\nLogistically, what was the most challenging aspect of putting the exhibition\n\ntogether?\n\nOur exhibition showcases several invaluable artifacts, including an original\n\ncheck signed by Alexander Hamilton and historical memorabilia from major\n\nartists. Ensuring the safety of these pieces while keeping them accessible to\n\nour guests was a logistical challenge for our team, but thankfully our team\n\nhas expertly managed those challenges, and seeing the joy on our guests'\n\nfaces as they experience RiseNY makes it all worthwhile.\n\n(Thanks to Vanessa Lizana and Elin Eggertsdottir for participating in the Q&A and special thanks to Lauryn Feinstein and Jason Geffen.

Cast with English, French, Italian, and Spanish actors, the Biblical epic was filmed in Rome and Morocco. It debuted in Italy on October 4, 1962, followed by its U.S. opening in New York on January 23, 1963, through 20th Century Fox. Given the title, some moviegoers might have expected to see spicier entertainment than usual, pretensions to Scriptural piety notwithstanding. If so, they were probably disappointed. Aside from a couple of modest harem-girl dance routines and a slinky, open-all-the-way-up-the-side dress worn by Pier Angeli in some scenes and by Rosanna Podesta in others, there was nothing in the movie that would have remotely upset the church ladies of the time. In the opening scene, a palace orgy is already over and the participants are sleeping it off on the floor, all of them clothed. Some orgy! Even the legendarily strait-laced critic Bosley Crowther seemed disappointed. “The sinfulness in ‘Sodom and Gomorrah’ . . . is no more alarming or disgusting than anything you might behold on a ramble through the residential areas of Minneapolis and St. Paul,” he sniffed in his New York Times review. The film earned $2.5 million in the U.S., or about $20.8 million in 2024 worth, not a terrible showing for its era but well below its $4.5 million investment (including the cost of sending cast and crew to Morocco for the exterior scenes). The returns were particularly disappointing in comparison with the staggering $146 million that “Ben-Hur” had made three years before. By 1962 though, the public had already started to lose interest in Biblical pictures with casts of thousands. The epic fail of “Cleopatra” (1963) further doomed the genre of expensive sword and toga spectacles set in ancient and Biblical times. After “The Greatest Story Ever Told” (1965) and “The Bible: In the Beginning” (1965), the studios finally pulled the plug.\n\nFor those of us not up on our Old Testament history, “Sodom and Gomorrah” opens with brief exposition of the “Long ago and far away” type now used for “Star Wars.” In ancient times, the Hebrew tribes under Abraham and Lot have gone their separate ways, with Lot (Stewart Granger) and his followers deciding to settle down by the Jordan River. The territory is already claimed by the pleasure-loving hedonists of Sodom, who are raided periodically by aggressive nomads called Helamites. Lot strikes a deal with Queen Berah of Sodom (Anouk Aimee). She agrees to let the Hebrews have the land they want on the other side of the river, as long as they pay a modest tribute and serve as a buffer against the Helamites. “We don’t look for trouble, but we’ll fight for what’s ours,” Lot assures the queen. Fractures quickly develop, though, and the Helamites are the least of Lot’s worries. The queen’s brother, Astoroth (Stanley Baker), seduces Lot’s impressionable daughter Shuah (Rossana Podesta) and conspires with the Helamites, turncoats in the palace guard, and traitors in the Hebrew camp to overthrow and assassinate Berah, disposing of Lot in the bargain. In the meantime, “as a gift, to seal our bargain,” Berah blithely hands her personal handmaiden, Ildeth (Pier Angeli), over to Lot. The widowed patriarch liberates Ildeth, adopts her into the tribe, and installs her in his personal tent. As it becomes obvious that Lot’s interest in the beautiful woman is as much physical as spiritual, Shuah and her sister Maleb resent the new girl in dad’s life. Berah also has her own ulterior motive: with Ildeth, she now has a useful spy in the Hebrew camp.\n\nLike most Biblical epics, “Sodom and Gomorrah” sets a low bar for viewers who can’t help smirking at man-skirts and florid dialogue. But even we who embrace “thee, thou, and thine” nonsense for its own sake will find it difficult to keep a straight face when someone yells, “Watch out for the Sodomite patrols!” For the record, it means nothing like what you’re thinking it means. The story is relatively light on Hollywood-style proselytizing, with Aldrich and his screenwriters finding the cultural clash between Sodom and the Hebrews more interesting on humanistic grounds than theological ones. The Hebrews despise the libertines of Sodom, whose society is built on debauchery and slave labor. Their displeasure grows when their patriarch Lot, under Ildeth’s influence, warms to the idea that wearing expensive clothes and watching dancing girls isn’t so bad after all, and as for slavery, well, live and let live. For fans of sword fights, there’s a cool duel between Lot and Astoroth, preceded by a big battle between the Hebrews and the Helamites when Astoroth finally springs his attempted coup. Playing the Helamites, the producers cast the real-life Royal Cavalry of Morocco as the opening credits are quick to acknowledge with thanks. Lest you think that production arrangements between studios and Middle Eastern monarchies are a thing of the past, check the closing credits for Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune” that thank the Royal Jordanian Air Force for assistance. When Jehovah finally demolishes Sodom, it comes almost like an afterthought as if Aldrich finally remembered that he was making a Biblical picture. For viewers wary of sermonizing, there’s really much less to bother them than anything in those “God is not dead” movies on recent direct-to-video shelves.\n\n“Sodom and Gomorrah” hasn’t exactly been a lost film, but for several years, the only ready option for nostalgic viewers or Robert Aldrich completists was a terrible DVD-R from the 20th Century Fox Film Archives. The full-frame transfer was so grainy that it seemed to be covered in gauze. An edition released by Explosive Media in Germany in 2021 in separate Blu-ray and DVD packages, under the original German theatrical title of “Sodom und Gomorrha,” was a stellar improvement that restores Aldrich’s original 1.85:1 image in rich Technicolor. Each package contains two discs, one presenting the original, 154-minute roadshow print, the other a shorter 117-minute edit that played in Europe. Both versions have English-language voice track and subtitle options, and both credit Sergio Leone as “Director of the Italian Version.” It’s generally conceded that the credit was awarded to Leone for Italian contractual obligations only, and at most, his contribution was limited to second-unit direction in the big battle scene between the Hebrews and the Helamites. And even the extent of that involvement is disputed in some accounts. Fans of vintage James Bond will note that Maurice Binder designed the opening credits and Ken Adam served as production manager for the impressive sets. Fans of Italian genre productions will recognise several familiar faces in the supporting cast, notably Italian actor Antonio de Teffé as Astoroth’s chief henchman in the palace guard. As “Anthony Steffen,” he later went on to fame—at least in Europe—as a star of Italian Westerns.\n\nThe Explosive Media disc with the shorter version of the picture includes English-language audio commentary by Glenn Erickson of Cinesavant, and the longer one includes German-language commentary by Leonhard Elias Lemke, Benedikt Wilken, and Maximillian Scholz of Deep Red Radio. The Blu-ray package also includes a 40-page media book in German. Amusingly, the Blu-ray and DVD are rated as suitable for 12-and-up. I was 12 when I saw “Sodom and Gomorrah” on the big screen, and nowadays, it’s probably a rare kid younger than 12 who hasn’t seen more provocative material on the Internet or streaming video. Note, the Explosive Media releases are Region 2, so viewers will need a compatible Blu-ray or DVD player to watch them. I hope a Region 1 edition will appear eventually.\n\nCLICK HERE to order “Sodom und Gomorrha” from Amazon.de.

Only die-hard retro movie fans are probably aware of the movie's existence and it has long been out of print on DVD. The film marked the first starring role for Charles Grodin since his acclaimed performance in Neil Simon's 1972 comedy \"The Heartbreak Kid\", which coincidentally is also not available on home video. (Does some fiend out there have an \"in\" for Charles Grodin movies?) The movie starts off with a bang when an ambitious diamond theft caper goes wrong just as the thieves are congratulating themselves. They don't live to regret it. The assassination has been secretly carried out by the diamond cartel known as \"The System\", which is located at a posh London mansion at the title address. Grodin plays American Howard R. Chesser, a rather small-time independent diamond broker who buys from the exchange on behalf of his clients. The System is headed by Meecham (John Gielgud), the epitome of the old-fashioned English gentleman who runs the place like a military establishment, and with good reason: 11 Harrowhouse has the largest stockpile of diamonds on the world market and they are worth tens of billions of pounds. Howard is tolerated at the cartel's headquarters, but he is considered to be small potatoes compared to some of their other clients. The System has so many diamonds in its possession that it can alter the price of the stones on the world market depending upon how many they allow to be traded.\n\nHoward's girlfriend is Maren Shirell (Candice Bergen), a beautiful and outrageously rich young woman who has inherited her fortune. She lives recklessly to avoid being bored, driving her race car at top speed under death-defying conditions. When Howard comes up with an audacious and dangerous caper to pull off, Maren is all in on the scheme. Having visited The System headquarters on many occasions, he has befriended Charles Watts (James Mason), a loyal employee of the firm for almost 30 years. He confides in Howard that he has been diagnosed with a terminal illness and isn't expected to last until his 30th anniversary with the company, which would ensure he is fully vetted in his pension benefits which would allow his family to live without hardships once he has passed away. He explains that he has told Meecham about his situation and asked him to reward him for his decades of loyal service by promising to provide the full benefits to his family if he doesn't reach his actual 30th anniversary with the firm. Meechum expresses sympathy but has told him that he would only pay 20% of the benefits to the family, should Watts pass away before his anniversary date is reached. The droll, understated Watts wants to get a measure of revenge on Meechum by enlisting Howard and Maren to assist him in pulling off the robbery of all the diamonds stockpiled at 11 Harrowhouse.\n\nThis is the crux of the caper aspect of the movie but the screenplay by Jeffrey Bloom (adapted by Charles Grodin) skips far too quickly to the execution of the crime. It presents an implausible scenario in which Watts lays the groundwork for his co-conspirators by making them familiar with how the diamonds are stored. Howard and Maren then gain access to the roof of the facility and manage to use a gigantic tube to act as a vacuum to suck the diamonds out of the drawers, with Watts having secreted himself inside the vault area to feed the diamonds into the device. All of this is clever and amusing to point, but it's illogical that two people without criminal pasts could possibly pull off the crime, which they do with relative ease. Not helping matters is director Aram Avakian's inability to squeeze even a modicum of suspense out of the sequence. It's the type of caper film young Michael Caine would have starred in a decade before and probably with better results.\n\nThere is a subplot that precedes the successful execution of the caper that involves Trevor Howard as Clyde Massey, a Goldfnger-like villain who lives on a magnificent estate. He also wants Howard for a mission, albeit not a dangerous one. He hires Howard to seek out a rare \"perfect diamond\" and spend up to one million dollars on the gem. How this ultimately fits into the criminal aspect of the story is too long to go into. Suffice it to say that after our heroes have stolen the diamonds from Harrowhouse, things run amock- and so does the script. The whole thing ends with double-crosses and a mad cap chase across Massey's estate with the rich man and his bodyguards pursuing Howard and Maren's diamond-packed van on horseback. The sight of the dapper Howard riding at full gallop across the fields is the closest we'd ever get to see him in a John Ford production. The stunts by the famed Joe Powell are impressive and worthy of a Bond film and they are set to a lively score by Michael J. Lewis, but the elaborate chase scene (which even involves Massey's wife, played by Howard's real-life spouse Helen Cherry) is a messy and unsatisfactory way to end the film. When the studio held a test screening of \"11 Harrowhouse\", audience response was dire. Thus, Grodin added a narration throughout the film that works well. Not having seen the original version, I can only that the narration was generally believed to enhance the final cut. It should be noted that editor Anne V. Coates (who would win an Oscar the following year for her brilliant work on \"Jaws\") has gone on record in decrying the film, saying that Aram Avakian was out of his depth on the film and that, despite their on-screen chemistry, Grodin and Bergen did not like each other.\n\nGiven my lukewarm feelings toward the film, you may wonder why I'm hoping for a Blu-ray release. (The original DVD version is long out print but can still be bought through third party sellers on Amazon.) I feel that, despite the movie's flaws, there are enough positive aspects to merit viewing it. A primary reason is the enjoyable performances, notably by the presence British film legends Gielgud, Mason and Howard. Their presence alone makes the film worth seeing. Another reason is that I truly wish that all major films were available on home video. So, I hope that at some point, \"11 Harrowhouse\" returns to the market in a deluxe Blu-ray edition wherein the film's attributes and faults can be discussed in detail.\n\nThe movie is available to purchase for streaming from YouTube. If you live in America and your cable TV package includes FXM, you might be able to access the film on demand, as I did.\n\nBy Hank Reineke\n\nThough I’m sixty-two years of age, I can still clearly recall the moment I discovered Famous Monsters of Filmland magazine. It was not a newsstand purchase. I was in third grade and the elementary school I attended was hosting a rummage sale. There on a table overflowing with the usual Bric-à-brac one sells off at such events, was Famous Monsters no. 44, cover date May 1967. I couldn’t believe someone hadn’t already grabbed up this treasure. Perhaps it was destiny.\n\nThe cover art came courtesy of Dan Adkins, better known for his work on another macabre Warren publication, Creepy. His painting featured Willis O’Brien’s King Kong (RKO, 1933) getting the better of a Pteranodon attacker. The image was set amidst a background of Day-Glo orange. It was a used copy of the magazine, but one still in excellent shape. I can’t remember what I paid for it - certainly far less than its cover price of fifty cents. Upon arriving home I paged gingerly through the magazine, much as an archeologist might while examining a rare, ancient scroll. I couldn’t believe such a magazine existed: one completely devoted to my favorite actors, monsters and movies. The issue offered stories on Boris Karloff, The Monster that Challenged the World, Tarantula, Dr. Who and the Daleks, Horror Castle, The Creature Walks Among Us and Chamber of Horrors. It was “mind blown” time.\n\nI’m sometimes ridiculed for my love of the original run of Famous Monsters of Filmland. The mag’s detractors are correct in some of their charges. Yes, the writing was mostly juvenile, editor Forry Ackerman’s bad puns atrocious. Others - mostly those never introduced at young age to Famous Monsters - tease my fascination (obsession?) with the magazine is simply rose-colored nostalgia: a desperate return to a more innocent time long passed. I know this accusation to be untrue. How can I “return” to a time that, for better or worse, I’ve simply never abandoned? I’m not regressing, I simply never “grew out of it.”\n\nOne of my favorite features of Famous Monsters was their “You Axed For It” section. Readers would request images from films that we desperately wanted to see but feared we ever would. There was no home video, no YouTube. We were completely dependent on television broadcasts, often programmed well past our bedtime. Published on page forty-seven of FM #44 was a still from a film titled The Unknown Terror (1957). It was an intriguing image that would haunt me for decades. A beautiful actress, unidentified in the magazine’s caption, was about to be accosted by some scary, long-haired, mummified figure covered in… well, what appeared to be soap bubbles.\n\nAside from the dupey, bootleg prints that circulated, The Unknown Terror had been unavailable on home video until 2021 when Imprint Films of Australia issued the film as part of its Silver Screams Collection. For those Stateside not wishing to pay the high shipping fees from Oz, the film is now available (alongside The Colossus of New York (1958) and Destination Inner Space (1966) to be featured in Kino Lorber’s new 2-disc Sci-Fi Chillers Collection. Though none of these films will ever be lauded as iconic, cultural touchstones of sci-fi cinema – some are pretty wonky, in truth – they’re still enjoyable popcorn films, assuming viewers dispense of any pretense of critical, rational thinking.\n\nInterestingly, the photograph of which I was so intrigued - actress Mala Powers being tracked by some sort of sudsy creature – was simply a promotional still. There is, as far as I can tell, no such scene in the film itself. Charles Marquis Warren’s The Unknown Terror, shot in “Regalscope” and distributed by 2oth Century Fox is at best an OK film, one half of a 1957 double-bill and twinned with the same director’s Back from the Dead. The film’s screenplay is credited to Kenneth Higgins, an industry veteran who wrote primarily for TV westerns but also had such an old creaker as the Bela Lugosi/Bowery Boy’s romp Ghosts on the Loose (1943) on his resume. Similar to Warren’s Back from the Dead, The Unknown Terror serves passable entertainment, but one promising more thrills than delivered.\n\nThe brother of Gina Matthews (Mala Powers) goes missing while searching for a mysterious “Cave of the Dead.” If such a cave exists, we’re told only that it’s found in a distant land “South of the American continent.” Gina, her moneyed husband Dan (John Howard) and her cave exploring ex-paramour Peter Morgan (Paul Richards) anxiously decide to travel there to seek out Gina’s missing sibling. Unfortunately, they have few clues to go on.\n\nThey think there might be a clue found in decoding the lyrics of an island song, “Suffer to be Born Again,” as performed by the calypso singer Sir Lancelot. (For the record, Sir Lancelot is real; I have a number of the artist’s 78rpm shellac recordings in my collection). Dan wants his superstitious friend Raoul Koom (Richard Gilden), to decipher the song’s secreted message. He’s then tasked to lead the trio to a cave situated on the outliers of his native village. Raoul hesitantly agrees to shepherd his friends there, but not before warning it might be best if they chose not to visit.\n\nUpon their arrival – and as one might expect - Raoul disappears almost upon arrival. The others meet with the loathsome Dr. Ramsey (Gerald Milton), a bald and burly scientist who appears to possess few likable character traits. On the other hand, Ramsey is their only principal contact: he knows the area well since he’s conducted scientific research there for some fifteen years. Ramsey dismisses his adopted hometown as a “tropical backwash,” but remains, studying the plants, fungi, bacteria and slime molds that assist in his antibiotic research.\n\nThe doctor has also established himself as the most powerful figure in town. Having cured the local villagers of smallpox through traditional medicine, the superstitious indigenous hold him in high esteem. He’s now thought of as a “spiritual king,” proving himself mightier than the “God of Death.” He tells the visiting Americans there is no such Cueva de la Muerte, that the cave’s existence is merely local superstition. Ramsey’s frightened native wife – whom the doctor allegedly saved from a human sacrifice ceremony – whispers otherwise.\n\nShe tells the Yanks that she can take them to a rocky area where one can hear the tortured “voices of the souls in purgatory” bellowing sorrowfully from underground. Sure enough, they too hear the voices and fatefully choose to investigate the labyrinth of tunnels and caverns beneath their feet. Should Gina manage to find her missing sibling in the creepy caverns, who else – or what - might she encounter while down there?\n\nThis is all good stuff for low-budget sci-fi - and the black-and-white transfer used appears unblemished. It’s likely the same transfer as issued on Imprint’s Silver Screams box. For all of its intermittent charms, the film is not necessarily a nail-biter. There’s quite a bit (read “too much”) of meandering spelunking footage. The admittedly creepy “fungi” creatures appear on screen only sparingly, terribly underused. While there’s a big sudsy climax, there’s simply not enough suds to wash away the fact the film offers very little suspense in its getting there.\n\nHiggins’ scenario of a damp cave setting beneficial in growing mold spores comes right out of Erle C. Kenton’s House of Dracula (1945). In that film, Onslow Stevens’ afflicted Dr. Edelman tries to do much of the same gardening to cure the Wolfman of his lycanthropy. If nothing else, with Kino having only recently offered Back from the Dead on Blu-ray, the arrival of The Unknown Terror allows fans to program their own Charles Marquis Warren film festival… should one feel the pressing need to do so. Warren is generally remembered as a prolific writer-director of western films. I think it’s fair to suggest his directorial flair for westerns, arguably, does not translate to the two sci-fi and mystery-horror pics of which he was contracted.\n\nThis is my second digital go round for Eugène Lourié’s The Colossus of New York (Paramount, 1958), the first being Olive Film’s summer 2012 release of the film on DVD. (Never picked up the Olive Blu-ray of this title so can’t compare editions). It’s nice to finally have this on Blu-ray and the film looks and sounds great in all of its monochrome splendor. Though Lourié might best be acknowledged in the industry for his talents as production designer and art director, he was certainly no slacker as helmsman. Though he didn’t wish to be typed as a director of science-fiction films, he certainly knocked out a few 1953-1961 that remain genre favorites to this very day: The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms (1953), The Giant Behemoth (1959) and Gorgo (1961).\n\nAccording to Tom Weaver (central commentator of the disc’s audio commentary), producer William Alland suggested the film’s memorable monster was based on the Golem, the skulking anthropomorphic creature of Jewish folklore. This is certainly apparent in the creature’s design, a hulking and lumbering cement-headed giant clothed in a biblical Moses-style robe. The script of Thelma Schnee (from an original story by Willis Goldbeck) is “classic” 1950’s sci-fi hokum – great fun if you like this sort of thing. Lourié’s flair for design is evident throughout, and the film’s odd and sparse piano-based score provides an intriguing counter-point to the action on screen.\n\nUpon his return from Stockholm – where he was just honored with an “International Peace Prize” – the altruistic scientist Jeremy Spensser (Ross Martin of Wild Wild West fame) is tragically killed in an automobile accident. He leaves behind a wife, Anne Spensser (Mala Powers, again) and a son, Billy, played by child actor Charles Herbert. (Herbert will be a very familiar face to fans of 1950s/60s television as well as to horror/sci-fi fan for his roles in The Fly (1958) and 13 Ghosts (1960). Jeremy’s widow and son are left to grieve, but Jeremy’s scientist father, Dr. William Spensser (Otto Kruger) and his brother Dr. Henry Spensser (John Baragrey), an “automation” specialist, decide to re-settle Jeremy’s brain into a “Colossus” robot.\n\nJeremy’s distraught father believes the brain of his uber-compassionate son might still benefit humankind. Jeremy’s brother is less certain, offering a man’s brain without a soul to guide one’s intentions might not be the best idea. He’s right, though he has a secondary reason to wish his brother forever dead and buried: Henry has the hots for Anne, his brother’s widow, his clumsy advances thus far rebuffed. For his part, Jeremy the Colossus is unhappy over his resurrection. “Help me. Destroy me,” he pleads. But as his familial appeal is ignored, the Colossus’s mindset registers antithetical to its devotion of promoting ideals of global humanitarianism.\n\nIn fact, the Colossus now bitterly wants to rid the world completely of “idealists” and “human trash.” He figures a good place to start as any is at the United Nations on Manhattan’s East River. With his new-found gifts of ESP, hypnotism, and eyes that blaze with murderous directional lasers, the heavy-footed Colossus is well-equipped to attack and destroy the temple of international peaceful coexistence. Who, if anyone, can stop the Colossus in his vengeful wrath? If you have seventy-seven minutes to spare, you can find out.\n\nBy Lee Pfeiffer\n\nKirk Douglas leads an impressive cast in \"The Final Countdown\", a 1980 military adventure with a sci-fi twist. The film is set aboard the real-life U.S. aircraft carrier Nimitz, named after the legendary U.S. fleet commander Chester Nimitz who was in charge of the Pacific fleet. Douglas plays the fictitious character of Matthew Yelland, who is the current captain of the ship. When the film opens, the Nimitz is in service off of the U.S. Naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Yellen's ship is loaded with state-of-the-art, highly armed jets that are undertaking training missions from the deck of the carrier. When we first meet Yellen, his biggest problem is having an unwanted but important civilian passenger aboard, Warren Lasky (Martin Sheen) who represents the company that manufactures the planes. The Department of Defense has assigned him to act as a quasi efficiency expert and report back any findings he has in terms of making the planes operate more effectively. Yellen assigns Cmdr. Richard Owens (James Farantino) to assist Lasky. The two men get off on the wrong foot when Owens catches Lasky reading the draft of a historic book manuscript that Owens is writing about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, which propelled America into WWII. (You know immediately that this plot point will resurface in dramatic fashion later in the story.) Things takes an unusual turn when the ship encounters a terrifying storm that appears out of nowhere. It's effects include what appears to be bizarre manifestations of lightning, accompanying by ear-splitting and ominous sounds. (The storm effects were created by Maurice Binder, who designed the inventive title sequences for many of the James Bond films.) Ultimately, the storm subsides and the Nimitz is back in sunny weather. However, radio broadcasts from the mainland are inexplicably shows from the 1940s, including Jack Benny bantering with Rochester. Even if you haven't seen the film, you know where this is going.\n\nEvidence continues to mount that the ship has somehow sailed through a time warp and that the date is December 6, 1941, a story hook that only a screenwriter could envision. Radar detects the presence of the Japanese fleet sailing nearby and preparing to launch its fleets of Zero war planes on the unprepared and unsuspecting U.S. base at Pearl Harbor. Yellen 's first impulse is to prevent the attack by using the modern weaponry he has at his disposal to destroy the Japanese fleet. However, Lasky challenges his decision by pointing out that if history is altered, it might have a devastating effect on how the future plays out. This is where the film is most intriguing. Scientists have speculated endlessly about whether time travel might be possible and what the consequences of it might be. Lasky warns that if people who were supposed to die during the attack are spared, it would inevitably lead to mind-boggling issues to deal with. Some people alive at the present time would cease to exist, for example. Things get stickier for Yellen when a private pleasure yacht is sunk by a Japanese Zero. On board is U.S. Senator Samuel Chapman (Charles Durning) and his devoted secretary, Laurel Scott (Katharine Ross). They are plucked from the ocean and brought aboard the Nimitz. Chapman, a powerful political force on a defense committee, is understandably gobsmacked by the hi-tech weaponry on the ship and believes a conspiracy is going in terms of keeping the technology secret from his committee. Lasky informs Yellen that Chapman had died during the hostilities on December 7. What are they to do regarding his fate? Lasky postures that if he is allowed to survive, there is evidence he would have succeeded Franklin D. Roosevelt as President following FDR's death in 1945.\n\nThe \"Twilight Zone\"-like scenario dreamed up by the screenwriters has some fascinating aspects to it. Douglas makes a predictably strong impression as the captain who faces the kinds of decisions that no one in history has been confronted with. The supporting cast is all very good, though Ross seems to have been added to provide some feminine grace in the otherwise all-male cast. Farantino and Sheen are very fine and Durning is suitably blustery as the demanding and obnoxious senator. Soon Tek-Oh appears as a Japanese pilot who is captured when his Zero is shot down. The film benefits from having had the full cooperation of the U.S. Navy. Some of the scenes of the planes taking off and landing are genuinely exciting and the cinematography by Victor J. Kemper is especially impressive, as is John Scott's lush score. Director Don Taylor keeps the action flowing and is equally good in conveying the tensions aboard the ship between the main characters.\n\nKirk Douglas's son Peter brought the script to his father's attention and Kirk decided to make the film through his own production company with Peter producing. Douglas recounted in his biography \"The Ragman's Son\" that he was disappointed with the boxoffice results but did have the time of his life when he was allowed to take off as a passenger on one of the Naval supersonic jets. If the film has a flaw its in the decision to punt when it comes to the most crucial elements of the story. I won't reveal the details but the emphasis on providing the audience with an uplifting finale compromises what could have been a more effective ending if the screenwriters were bolder. Still, \"The Final Countdown\" is thoroughly entertaining. It is current streaming on Amazon Prime. Click here to order Blue Underground's Blu-ray special edition from Amazon.\n\nBy Lee Pfeiffer\n\nIn 1980, the creative team of Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker unleashed the disaster movie spoof \"Airplane!\" upon an unsuspecting world. The film became a boxoffice smash and an iconic comedy. In 1988, the team unveiled \"The Naked Gun\" series that was based on their short-lived T.V. series, \"Police Squad\". Sandwiched in between these achievements was the 1984 release of a film that didn't have much impact when released in 1984, the Cold War comedy \"Top Secret!\". Since I am a junkie for politics, like most Americans I've been greatly disturbed by the volatile and sometimes surrealistic nature of the forthcoming presidential election. It speaks volumes that I sought some laughs from a film that evokes an era in which the major problem was the possibility of the U.S. and Soviet Union engaging in mutual nuclear destruction. Not having seen \"Top Secret!\" since its original release in the Cold War era, I can say that it's held up well and provided at least a temporary antidote for today's political madness.\n\nVal Kilmer, then an unknown in his first screen role, top-lines as Nick Rivers, a teenage rock 'n roll idol who, for reasons I can't quite remember, is sent to East Germany on a goodwill mission to help bring about better relations with the U.S. Amusingly-and inexplicably- Rivers adheres to the dress and performing habits of rock stars from the 1950s, with a special emphasis on Elvis Presley. However, in a production like this, logic doesn't enter into the plot. Once behind the Iron Curtain, he becomes saves beautiful Hillary Flammond (Lucy Gutteridge) from arrest by the secret police for being part of a local resistance group. Naturally, they find each other irresistible and Lucy recruits Nick to use his presence as a guest of the government to enable him to join the freedom fighters. This leads to another bizarre and very funny scenario in which we learn that the resistance is comprised of French Underground fighters with names such as Croissant and Deja Vu. This twist allows the filmmakers to incorporate elements of WWII movies into a contemporary spy comedy. (The East German soldiers are all wearing WWII helmets and uniforms.) The third element of the \"plot\" includes elaborate rock 'n roll musical numbers in which Rick Rivers leads rooms full of teenagers in songs that are very good imitations of the actual hits. (The film's opening credits offers clever riffs of Brian Wilson's Beach Boys classics.) There isn't much of an attempt to meld any of these various scenarios in a meaningful or logical way, which only adds to the goofy fun. Oh, and there's a very clever spoof of the Brooke Shields/Christopher Atkins version of \"The Blue Lagoon\" with Christopher Villiers very funny as Hillary's former island castaway and lover, Nigel. They are reunited, as he now is the leader of the Underground. She is immediately smitten by him, much to Nick's distress...and she doesn't seem to notice that Nigel is quite effeminate.\n\nBeginning with \"Airplane!\", the filmmakers made signature aspect of their movies their ability to see comedic potential in some of Hollywood's great stone faces, managing to get very funny performances from the likes of Peter Graves, Robert Stack and most notably Leslie Nielsen, whose success in comedies afforded him an entirely new career (although he would never be able to play a dramatic role again.) Similarly, \"Top Secret!\" affords some comic turns for actors known for their dramatic roles. These include horror film icons Michael Gough and Peter Cushing (in a very funny cameo), Jeremy Kemp, and, of all people, Omar Sharif, whose fleeting appearances are the funniest aspects of the movie. Val Kilmer makes for a very suitable leading man,handing the singing, gyrations and quips with equal skill. He would go on to stardom a couple of years later in \"Top Gun\".\n\nOne aspect of the film that resonated with me was the fact that until the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, Germany had been a divided country since the end of WWII in 1945 when Stalin was awarded East Germany and much of Eastern Europe as the Soviet Union's reward for its role in defeating Hitler's forces. (Overlooking the fact that he had originally been in alliance with Hitler). Consequently, countless millions of people were forced to live in authoritarian states for almost half-a-century, and East Germany was arguably the most repressive of them all (as documented in the Oscar-winning film \"The Lives of Others\".) Watching the manner in which the dictatorship is spoofed in the film reminded me of what Mel Brooks once told me about spoofing Hitler in \"The Producers\". He said the only way he could voice his indignation at what Hitler stood for was through mockery. The filmmakers used the same tactics here. Dictators and wanna-be dictators don't have a great sense of humor about themselves and in some small way, comedies that target them must get under their skin.\n\n\"Top Secret!\" is a fun jaunt throughout. It's theater of the absurd and I wish we had comedies this inspired today, but they are in short supply. After all, where else can find scenarios including an homage to the car-crushing scene in \"Goldfinger\", another in which a man disguised as a cow is violated by a real cow and another character is reported to have been killed in a scenario involving misuse of an anal sex toy?\n\nThe film is currently streaming on Paramount+. Click here to order the Blu-ray from Amazon.\n\nINTERVIEW BY ADRIAN SMITH\n\nAlthough born in the UK, film director Brian Trenchard-Smith will forever be associated with the Australian cult film genre Ozploitation thanks to a number of films he made there in the 1970s and 1980s, including such favourites as The Man From Hong Kong (1975), Turkey Shoot (1982), BMX Bandits (1983, a childhood favourite of mine) and Dead End Drive-In (1986), the latter now available in UHD and Blu-ray from Umbrella Entertainment in its original Australian release cut and the later American edit featuring an exciting array of bonus features. To celebrate the release, I was able to speak to Brian about the film and the fact that global audiences will now be able to see the film as he originally intended:\n\nBTS - I certainly want the full Australian version to be seen by a wider public. It never has been outside of Australia in 1986. Australian audiences did not respond to the movie, which was badly marketed as a summer holiday youth market romp with garish costumes and punkish costumes. You know, older people designing a marketing campaign aimed younger people and getting it wrong. They didn’t like the film, which was clear to me from meetings. They opened it in a Sydney theatre which was still under construction from remodelling and some people told me they had trouble finding which of the three theatres it was playing in. It was damned with faint praise by Australian cinema critics who were becoming jaundiced with the wave of Australian movies that were hitting the screen and they felt we’re not living up to Hollywood standards, so they were sharpening their ‘snark’. Luckily the VHS cut version that was ultimately seen by people all over the world developed a cult following, which has led to this rediscovery.\n\nCR - It’s a shame that the full Australian cut didn’t make it to the UK because back in the 1980s we loved everything Australian here, especially the daily soaps Neighbours and Home and Away. It could have worked here.\n\nBTS - Yes, they said Australia was Britain with better weather, which is completely wrong. I grew up in a part of Hampshire that seemed to be particularly temperate except December, but Australia can have tremendous rainfall and of course tremendous heat. I think the film would have appealed to post-Thatcher British sensibility because Turkey Shoot did, even in its savagely cut form. The British film censors hated the film but you know even with stinking reviews on its opening day it had a queue around the block at the Warner West End at the beginnings of a blizzard! So, there was something about Turkey Shoot that resonated with the British public which I tried to elicit for audience to a degree for both films.\n\nCR - I thought it was interesting that you shot Dead End Drive-In at the same drive-in that you’d gone to when you were younger with your father.\n\nBTS - The first drive-in I ever went to was the Matraville Drive-In in Sydney. I took my father to see Sam Peckinpah’s Major Dundee (1965), which looked great. The way fate has it, I’m shooting in 1985 and was at that Matraville Drive-In doing Dead End Drive-In for that three-month window before the drive-in closed for economic reasons and became a block of flats. So, it was really kind of great to see the film again in a drive-in recently in Portland. I had never done that before because its release in Australia was so short, and I think there were over 60 cars and there were some flatbed trucks with kids on with blankets and cushions on the back, and every time there was a big stunt in there was a huge cheer you could hear from across the drive-in.\n\nCR – I’d like to talk about some of the publicity materials. Can we start with the girl in the horned bra? It’s a very striking image.\n\nBTS - I did not know her personally! I’ve been thinking about who she was, and I don’t think that’s one of the stunt team. We had a lot of people who wanted to be extras and they could have been models who were invited to bring costume suggestions. Of course, our art department had lots of good ideas like that.\n\nCR - I look I kept looking all the way through the film but I couldn’t see her. She’s very prominent in the marketing which makes sense.\n\nBTS - Yes, well I think there was a still photographer that day. I don’t know why I hadn’t signalled her out for a close-up come to mention it, but maybe it was a day in which the shooting schedule didn’t call for it, and she was not called. I don’t know. It’s interesting the things you learn 40 years later. That’s the interesting thing about the marketing; obviously it’s not the director who’s in control of what the marketing people are using.\n\nCR – It’s the same with this chap on some of the posters, which is now on the cover of the new Blu-ray.\n\nBTS - Oh yes, that’s appalling! The whole story of the release of the film in America, as I detailed in my director’s commentary for the deleted scenes from the American version; when they bought the film they didn’t reveal their entire purpose which was to turn it into a summer release for the youth market as if it was set in America, and dub it into American just as Mad Max (1979) had been dubbed. That appalled the actors of Mad Max and Actors Equity. When we heard about that plan, which we didn’t realize included cutting out scenes in which there was too much Australian slang in the dialogue - I mean what is a game of Two-up you might wonder? - the American intellect will be baffled by that in the drive-in circuit of America. That was their thinking, and we didn’t know there were cut scenes because the sales agent who did the deal was kind of in the bag with them as opposed to being dedicated to our best interests. He was dedicated to commission! And making good with his pals. We said you can’t dub the actors. We told whole Mad Max story, and they said, ‘Well we have the right to do anything we want under a clause of the contract,’ so we quoted Actors Equity and that the deal with our actors is that if we ever did replace their voices with other voices they still have the right to make one last attempt to get what the buyer wanted. That meant they would have to pay for them to re-record their voices in American, and then you can do what you like but at least they will not have had their voices taken away from them, which is a terrible thing to do to an actor. The distributors didn’t like the cost of that so they said, ‘Oh, what the hell!’ and basically halved the amount of the release and sort of threw it away because they knew they could get their guarantee back on the VHS sales, which I’m sure they did. We just got the advance.\n\nCR - We should also talk about your short information film Hospitals Don’t Burn Down! (1978), which has also been restored and is now available on this Blu-ray. I know from a UK perspective that there were many of these kinds of 1970s education and public information films that traumatised that generation.\n\nBTS - That was my mission! It was just a great experience. We felt we were doing something good, and we were getting paid something for it. The film is beautifully remastered. I guess they must have gone back to the 16mm negative. The density of those original negatives were really quite good.\n\nCR - In the article in the book which comes with the Dead End Drive-In release there’s an original ad for Eastman Colour where you wrote about the fact that it was the Eastman colour film that really helped you with making the film in those lighting conditions.\n\nBTS - If Hammer had ever hired me to make an industrial fire safety short, this is what I would do. I would make it into an industrial horror film. The idea was for it to be a kind of docudrama which would faithfully reproduce life in the hospital and then somehow integrate this fire disaster into it. That’s what I tried to do and give it an overall consistency. We blended three separate hospitals together, all run by the Veteran Affairs Department that had been having problems with fires in the hospitals and commissioned this film for about $85,000 AUD. We shot for 18 nights in three six-day weeks. I wrote the shooting script, so it edited together easily, and it seemed to turn out well because it became shown on a compulsory basis to every new staff member when they joined the Veteran Affairs Hospitals. I think that spread to all the hospitals across Australia. I am told a hospital on the north coast of New South Wales, a four-story hospital, that had its ICU on the fourth floor, realized that non-ambulatory patients need to be as close to the ground as possible so they moved it to the ground floor and several months later the fourth floor caught fire and was gutted. So that could be an example that the film saved lives. It is probably the only film I’ve made that has! It’s one of the many reasons I’m proud of the film and I think everyone who worked on it is proud of it.\n\nCR- There are some amazing fire stunts too.\n\nBTS – That was Grant Page and his team. They were top pyrotechnics people. This film needed to be a great marriage between the stunt department, the fire department, the safety department and the crew, particularly when you’re working with children, and it all went very smoothly. It was a great experience.\n\nA - I would like to just talk a little bit about Grant Page as he sadly passed away earlier this year. He had such a huge impact on your career right from the start.\n\nBTS - I’d always been fascinated by stunt men, the unsung heroes of the movie industry who do extraordinary things that make the star look good, or shock you and make you gasp in some way ‘God, how did you do that? Who are these guys? Gee, I’d like to be one!’ though I sensibly only dabbled at the edges. I found a stunt man called Bob Woodham who had just come back from working in the UK on The Guns of Navarone (1961) and You Only Live Twice (1967) and he also did British television work. He had come to Australia at the dawn of the Australian film industry in the beginning of 1970 so was just getting to do stunt work in the very few Australian police procedurals. I got to know him and decided to make a film (The Stuntmen, 1973) with him in the lead and it won a prize at the Sydney Film Festival. I was planning to go on to make a series but after the premier Bob unfortunately died of a heart attack. I thought ‘Right well I’ll find the other really outstanding stunt man that I had worked with’, who came up from Adelaide to do the rope slides on The Stuntmen. This was Grant Page, and he had charisma in his interview. He was the perfect person to build a series around, exploring the whole world of stunts, maybe over four or five episodes, and that’s how Dangerfreaks (1975) was born. I signed Grant to a five-year contract of management and managed his career for five years and sold him to other movies for stunts including Mad Max. We worked together on six things. I created vehicles for him like Stunt Rock (1978). Going over to America and making Stunt Rock there allowed me to introduce him to a producer who then took him on to be the stunt coordinator for Death Ship (1980) and City on Fire (1979). It was Grant’s fire stunts as exhibited in Hospitals Don’t Burn Down! that I showed that producer and he was sold, and then they hired him to set his hair on fire as a demented pirate in The Island (1980). Grant was a great man and I miss him. I sent a somewhat tearful greeting to the funeral and I expressed my view that Grant and I were pretty useful to each other at a critical period in our respective careers. He was the perfect person to put the kind of ideas I had on the screen and to make them work and make them practical. He was a great guy, and he expanded my horizons and made me challenge boundaries. He forced you to face some of your own fears. I think Grant was right - that you know your life better if you do actually face your own fears and try to expand your boundaries."
