It is chock full of expert advice, essential information, tricks, tips and cultural insights prepared by seasoned tour manager, tour operator and intrepid traveler, Sandy Serio Gregory, owner of Che Bella Tours.\n\n​\n\nThe Italians, by John Hooper. As a tour director since 2008, I love this study of Italy, where geography, history and tradition weave a portrait of the Italians at their best and their worst.\n\nItalian Neighbors, An Italian Education and Italian Ways, by Tim Parks. Certainly we all have the longing to live “Under the Tuscan Sun” and there have been many books written in the genre. I like this series about an Englishman married to an Italian wife in Verona. Tim Parks is a very good storyteller and observer of people and culture.\n\nLa Bella Figura: A Field Guide to the Italian Mind by Beppe Severgnini. This is your book if you want a fun peek into Italian culture through the eyes of a local.\n\nLa Bella Lingua, by Dianne Hales. This book is a celebration of the language and culture of Italy. It is the story of how a language shaped a nation. Told against the backdrop of one woman’s personal quest to speak fluent Italian, this is for anyone who finds the idea of living the Italian life powerfully seductive.\n\nSPQR, by Mary Beard. To this day, you’ll find these letters all over Rome – even on the manhole covers. SPQR means Senatus Populusque Romanus (the Senate and the Roman people). In the context of the rise of the Roman Empire, this author focuses on the lives of the average people who lived in the era.\n\nVenice\n\nThe Politics of Washing: Real Life in Venice, by Polly Coles. This is a city perilously under siege from tourism, but its people refuse to give up. They love Venice with a passion. This book is a fascinating window into the world of ordinary Venetians and the strange and unique place they call home.\n\n​Death at La Fenice and Blood from a Stone, by Donna Leon. Any of her mysteries featuring the fictional hero, Commissario Guido Brunetti, is a winner.\n\nThe City of Falling Angels, by John Berendt. This story tells the truth behind the 1996 fire at La Fenice opera house in Venice. This author also wrote Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.\n\nTuscany\n\nThe Agony and the Ecstasy, by Irving Stone. I first read this historical novel about the life of Michelangelo when I attended college in Florence. The streets and artwork came alive as I was studying his works while living in this Renaissance city.\n\nSixteen Pleasures, by Robert Hellenga. This wonderful novel focuses on the “Mud Angels,” who helped to clean up and preserve the art and books in Florence after the 1966 flood. Many U.S. volunteers went to help rescue works of art. This is one woman’s story of her struggle to help save a waterlogged convent library.\n\nDecameron, by Giovanni Boccaccio. A medieval story of seven young women and three young men who take refuge in a secluded villa outside Florence in order to escape the Black Death. Over ten evenings, to pass the time, each traveler takes a turn as storyteller.\n\nA Light in the Ruins, by Chris Bohjalian. In 1943, the prominent Rosati family was confident their grand villa would protect them and garner favor from the greedy German forces intruding on Italy. Jumping forward to 1955, the story picks up with the brutal slayings and heinous dismemberments of Rosati family members by an unknown assailant. Serafina Bettini, a Florence police investigator, is assigned to the gruesome case. She promptly finds herself immersed in family drama as she pursues the serial killer, who is determined to slay the entire clan. Serafina discovers she has a personal relationship with the maniacal murderer.\n\nThe South\n\nMy Brilliant Friend, by Elena Ferrante. This is a rich story about two friends growing up in a poor, but vibrant, neighborhood on the outskirts of Naples. This story is also an HBO series.\n\nCalabria: The Other Italy, by Karen Haid. My grandfather, Dr. Michael Serio, came to the U.S. from Calabria when he was eight years old. My grandfather, and this book, are inspirations to travel there soon.\n\nThe Ancient Shore: Dispatches from Naples, The Bay of Noon and other books by Shirley Hazzard. Born in Australia, Shirley Hazzard first moved to Naples as a young woman in the 1950s to work at the United Nations. This was the beginning of a long love affair with the city. My grandmother, Genevieve DelBello Valentine Serio, came to the U.S. from Naples when she was three years old, so this is an inspiration every time I visit this rich and historical city.\n\nUnto the Sons, by Gay Talese. Gay Talese, one of America’s greatest living authors, is from Calabria. This is the saga of his family’s emigration to America from Italy in the years preceding World War II. It’s the story of all immigrant families and the hope and sacrifice that took them from the familiarity of the old world into the mysteries and challenges of the new.\n\nArt\n\nLives of the Artists, by Giorgio Vasari. This is an excellent reference book for anyone who is interested in the Renaissance masters. Vasari was born in Arezzo. A painter and architect, he is more famous, however, for his biographies of contemporaries than any of his own works. The talents of the Renaissance artists made them geniuses, but it was Vasari’s words that made them celebrities. His book also provides an insider’s view of the business of art and the struggles artists faced to thrive in the environment of pleasing their patrons. Vasari also dishes on the artists behind the works: the groundwork laid by Leonardo da Vinci; the showdown between Michelangelo and Pope Julius II over the Sistine Chapel; the competitive subterfuge of Raphael.\n\nThe Stones of Florence, by Mary McCarthy. A unique history of Florence, from its inception to the dominant role it came to play in the world of art, architecture and Italian culture.\n\nBrunelleschi’s Dome: How a Renaissance Genius Reinvented Architecture, by Ross King. On August 19, 1418, a competition concerning Florence’s magnificent new cathedral, Santa Maria del Fiore — already under construction for more than a century — was announced. Of the many plans submitted, one stood out: a daring and unorthodox solution to vaulting what is still the largest dome (143 feet in diameter) in the world. It was offered not by a master mason or carpenter, but by a goldsmith and clockmaker named Filippo Brunelleschi. Starting at the age of 41, he would dedicate his next 28 years to solving the puzzles of the dome’s construction. In the process. Brunelleschi reinvented the field of architecture. This book is one of my favorites.\n\nCuisine\n\nItalian Food Rules, by Ann Reavis. In Italy, they love making rules, but hate to follow them. However, when it comes to cuisine, food rules are carved in stone. And for those of you who have traveled with me to Italy, you know food rules are not merely a suggestion.\n\nWhy Italians Love to Talk About Food, by Elena Kostioukovitch. Italy is food and food is Italy: literally, emotionally, historically, culturally and symbolically. This book is organized by region and tells a wonderful story about the history of Italian cuisine.\n\nEcco la Cucina, by Gina Stipo. Chef, instructor, restaurateur, culinary tour director and my friend, Gina Stipo is another Italian-American who brings groups to Italy. She lived in Siena for many years and ran a cooking school. Her recipes are authentic and easy to follow.\n\nHoney from a Weed, by Patience Gray. This 1986 autobiographical cookbook has been on my shelf for years. It’s a story of the author’s relocation from London, marriage to a sculptor and travel throughout the Mediterranean. Gray celebrates, through her recipes, the places she loves. In Puglia, she cooked with the local produce, including the weeds. My own grandmother, who came from southern Italy, also used the weeds from her backyard to make wonderful dishes.\n\nFILMS\n\nBig Night. An American movie set in Atlantic City, this film is about two brothers from Italy who open up a restaurant. To save their business, they take a chance and create one epic night of food, friends and family. A Serio family favorite, we make and enjoy the food featured in the movie, especially the timpano. Stanley Tucci wrote and starred in this movie, along with Isabella Rosallini, Tony Shalhoub and Mark Anthony.\n\nThe Godfather. It’s a classic. The cast. The criminals. The family. The staging. The camera work. The music. If you travel with me, bring your favorite line from the series. My line is, “Leave the gun, take the cannoli!”\n\nTea with Mussolini. Set in Florence and San Gimignano, this is a true story about a gaggle of Englishwomen caught in the fray of WWII. Maggie Smith, Judi Dench, Joan Plowright, Cher and Lily Tomlin star in this Franco Zeffirelli film. Available on DVD or from the local library. My copy is worn and scratched from the many times I have played this little gem for my guests on my motor coach.\n\n​Mid-August Lunch. A charming tale of good food, feisty ladies and unlikely friendships during a very Roman holiday. Broke, and armed with only a glass of wine and a sense of humor, middle-aged Gianni resides with his 93-year-old mother in their ancient apartment. The condo debts are mounting, but if Gianni looks after the building manager’s mother during the Pranzo di Ferragosto (the Feast of the Assumption), all will be forgiven. An auntie and a mother-in-law join the party. Can Gianni keep four such lively mamas well fed and happy in these cramped quarters?\n\nThe Bicycle Thief. This is a simple, powerful film about a man named Ricci, who joins the queue every morning, looking for work. One day, there is a job for a man with a bicycle. “I have a bicycle,” he says! The bicycle allows Ricci to go to work as a poster-hanger for cinema advertisements. Soon, of course, the bike is stolen, no doubt by another man who needs a job. The cycle of theft and poverty is the theme of this movie. In Italian with English subtitles.\n\nCinema Paradiso. This is a sweet story about a young boy’s friendship with a movie house operator and their mutual love of film and fantasy. In Italian with English subtitles.\n\nLa Grande Bellezza (The Great Beauty). Rome is the backdrop of this reflective story about 65-year-old Italian socialite who, for decades, seduced his way through lavish parties and romance. Depressed with the high life, a shock from his past causes him to rethink the beauty of life and the meaning of the superficial. Available on Netflix.\n\nLife is Beautiful. A Jewish librarian and his family become victims of the Holocaust. While in the concentration camp, he uses a mixture of will, humor, and imagination to protect his son from the dangers that surround them. Papa tells his son that they are competing with others to win an armoured tank. Everything from food shortages to tattoos becomes part of the contest. This movie was filmed in Arezzo, a place I love to travel with my guests.\n\nThe chick flicks ...\n\nThe language, the music, the passion toward life — all contribute to the romance of Italy. The first time I stepped foot onto a cobblestone piazza, I was smitten with la dolce vita. I’m a sucker for a chick flick about a grown-up woman who’s on a beautiful, life-affirming journey. Here are a few of my guilty pleasures:\n\nA Room with a View. Lucy Honeychurch’s journey to self-discovery during Victorian England is set in beautiful Florence. As Lucy is exposed to opportunities previously not afforded to women, her mind — and heart — must open. Before long, she’s in love with an “unsuitable” man and is faced with an impossible choice to follow her heart or be pressured into propriety. There is a newer version, but I prefer the 1986 movie featuring a young Helena Bonham Carter, Daniel Day Lewis, Maggie Smith and Judi Dench.\n\nEnchanted April. A wonderful movie about new life, rekindled relationships, new beginnings, new friendships and finding love again. Filmed in beautiful Positano. Sometimes a change of scenery can change everything.\n\nUnder the Tuscan Sun. When Frances Mayes (Diane Lane) learns her husband is cheating on her, life is turned upside down.

While visiting Verona, a young woman visits Juliet’s house, where the lovelorn drop notes in the red mailbox of Shakespeare’s tragic heroine, Juliet Capulet. This story, filled with love and romance, inspired me to go to Verona to write my own letter to Juliet. Like the movie, my note went into the little red mailbox. Curiously, Juliet’s 13th century house also had a computer, so I followed up with an email: “Dear Juliet, per my letter in the post, please facilitate promptly as I am 52 and not getting any younger.” Three weeks later I met Odell, who became my husband.\n\nFRANCE\n\nBOOKS\n\nTraveling to France\n\nCulture Shock! France by Sally Adamson Taylor. This is a great series of books I use before I travel to a new country, demystifying cultures and people.\n\nA Year in Provence and Toujours Provenceby Peter Mayle. Yes, another run-away-to-Europe-and-renovate-a-villa book. You know I love this genre - and I will do this some day, somewhere! Mayle's memoirs include humorous anecdotes about restoring and living in a 200-year-old farmhouse in a remote area of the Luberon. His best-selling novel about his first year in the South of France is a humorous and witty recollection of his time there. ​\n\nSixty Million Frenchmen Can't Be Wrong by Jean-Benoit Nadeau and June Barlow. This is a must-read for anyone serious about understanding French culture, contemporary politics and what makes the French tick.\n\nHistory\n\nD-Day, June 6, 1944: The Battle for the Normandy Beachesby Stephen E.

This is a memoir from the man who has fostered wanderlust for generations, set in Paris during the roaring ’20s where Hemingway lived, struggling to make a living as a writer and a journalist.

A moving tale of occupied France seen through the experiences of a blind French girl and a lonely German boy whose paths cross in war-torn St-Malo.\n\nSuite Françaiseby Irène Némirovsky. Némirovsky, a Russian Jew who was living in France and died at Auschwitz in 1942, plunges readers into the chaotic WWII evacuation of Paris, as well as daily life in a small rural town during the ensuing German occupation. It has since been transformed into a film starring Michelle Williams. What you may not know is that this film was first a book set against the backdrop of WWII and was meant to be the title of a series of five books. However, the author Irène Némirovsky, a Frenchwoman of Ukranian-Jewish origin, was arrested in 1942 for being Jewish and was then murdered at Auschwitz. Her daughters preserved the notebook containing the works but did not look at them until 1998. In 2004, a novel was published under the title ‘Suite Française,’ an amalgamation of the first two novels.\n\nThe Classics\n\nMadame Bovaryby Gustave Floaubert. Emma Bovary is unhappy with her small-town, provincial life and seeks a more exciting one. There is a reason why Madame Bovary is on the list of every book club and class on world literature: It is a timeless masterpiece.\n\nA Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens. The work is historical fiction and is set in the two capitals before and during the French Revolution.

It’s well worth a read if you ever get the chance and explores the conditions that led up to the French Revolution.\n\nCuisine\n\nMastering the Art of French Cooking by Julia Child. Mastering the Art of French Cooking is for both seasoned cooks and beginners who love good food and long to reproduce at home the savory delights of the classic French cuisine.\n\nMy Life in Franceby Julia Child. The zesty chef recounts her early days in Paris. Though remembered fondly as a cooking wizard and endearing television personality, Julia Child began as an awkward ex-pat who didn’t begin cooking at all until she was 37! The memoir is her version of a ‘Thank You’ to France for its kindness and influence on her rise to fame.\n\nFILMS\n\nAmélie. This tells the story of Amelie Poulain, a quirky waitress manipulating destiny to spreaFd joy. Audrey Tattou is charming.\n\nParis Je T’aime is a medley of 18 short films, each telling a story set in one of Paris’s arrondissements.

The main protagonist, Vianne Rocher sets up shop as a chocolatier and the film explores life in France, as well as some of its best culinary delights. If you love food, reading and France, Starring Juliette Binoche and Johnny Dep.\n\nTwo For the Road This is one of my favorite old movies, starring Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney. This story cleverly and amusingly leaps back and forth in time, catching the couple at various points during their courtship and marriage, remembering when they were “on the road” traveling throughout Europe in an old MG - very romantic. The marriage gradually loses its novelty and charm, gradually transforming itself into a deep and weary familiarity.\n\nIRELAND AND SCOTLAND\n\n​BOOKS\n\nFor the Love of Ireland: A Literary Companion for Readers and Travelers by Susan Cahill.

Soon, Utterson begins having dreams in which a faceless figure stalks through a nightmarish version of London.\n\nFILMS\n\nMichael Collins.
