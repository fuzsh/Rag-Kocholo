        "text": "Auteur Response Blog part 1 The auteur director I have chosen to write about is Jordan Peele. He is a well known African American comedian. He is most known for the TV show Key and Peele. Peele's significance in cinema can be attributed to his groundbreaking work as a writer, director, and producer, particularly in the horror and social commentary genres. I have chosen Jordan Peele because he directed the three films we watched. The films I will be comparing are “Get Out”, “Us”, and “Nope’. Some of the signature themes in the films are the social and racial commentary. In “Get Out”, it delves into the experiences of being Black. Peele is very good at mixing horror and suspense to tackle important social issues. As for visual aesthetics, Peele's films always have a very distinct way of drawing the audience into watching them and making them stand out. The way he uses striking images and symbolism to drive home the themes is amazing. Also, every little thing in these films helps the film's rewatchability because there are certain things you will catch on your second watch that you won’t catch the first time around. Finally, the narrative tendencies of his films are rich in references to pop culture, both past and present. He uses these references to enhance the narrative and add depth to the story. Some examples of the visual language when you watch a Jordan Peele film are that the smallest thing has a purpose. It can be something in the background. In “Nope\", the main threat in the film known as Jean Jacket, normally resides in the clouds, but in an earlier scene the cloud that it normally resides in is shown in the background. Another example would be a song used in the film. In “Get Out”, during the opening credits scene, a tribal song is being played. One of the biggest things is how Peele foreshadows prominent events of his films at the beginning, like during the title sequences. Everytime the film starts Peele shows something that will come back later in the film. This helps the rewatchability factor because you’ll want to watch it again to see what you missed in your first watch\n\n“What we call the beginning is often the end And to make an end is to make a beginning. The end is where we start from.” ---T. S. Eliot “Four Quartets” I have carried this copy of T. S. Eliot’s “Four Quartets” everywhere I’ve gone since I was twenty. How do you explain something like that? It’s personal. The series of poems that make up this small set speak to me, deeply. There are too many bits and pieces to offer any clear explanation. But I can sketch a couple faint images. In the poems, Eliot takes us on walks in a variety of places each with hidden significance, from a worn-down manor with an empty pool to a field in which the ghosts of religious dissenters still dance to a walk through a World War II air raid in downtown London, the settings all carry the ghosts of something past, something that continues to haunt our present. Eliot uses the eternal word to step out of the moment in time and try to understand these places and their meaning from a timeless perspective. But the words bend and break, unable to accomplish their task. He writes that “Footfalls echo in the memory Down the passage which we did not take Towards the door we never opened” A line that became the central conceit of “Dark Matter,” the popular novel and Apple TV series. This passage is not what it might seem. Rather than a rumination on regret over missed opportunities, the line reminds us that where and what we are now, at this moment in time, is the culmination of all the passages we did not take in life just as much as the passages we did take. We are the sum of the choices we’ve made. Understanding this moment in time relies on understanding all those other timeless moments and their eternal place as moments, as (when they occurred) the now. If we understand that, we can return to this moment in time and know it, truly know it, for the first time. For now, we look through a glass darkly. Yet, this present moment is over even as it occurs and we are left to think of the end, the death of the poet. This is the subject of the final quartet, Little Gidding, in which Eliot wanders London in a ghost patrol with St. Augustine and considers what happens when the words you burn to put on paper today become yesterday’s dead language, reframed, reshaped, reinvented by future poets. And that is only a beginning. But, in this beginning is our end. I’ve run out of space for a Linked In post. Read, live. Take the book in your hand. Make it yours. Use it up in your life. It’s worth nothing on eBay. But it can be an invaluable companion to you. Eliot taught me that.\n\nThis is a funny book. Joel Morris is a phenomenal comedy creator, but he doesn't appear to have written this to plug his podcasts, be a contrarian, or mystify us with hilarious hocus-pocus. He's an intellectual who's capable of sitting down and enquiring beyond the clickbait, probing language, society, and science. He can do serious alright. He's just funny about it. And if you really want to find out how he does it, I can only say \"Read this book\". Comedy professionals are falling over themselves to find references to themselves, a cause for grievance, or both- but other professions should be paying attention too. Just from the ones I know: interpreters and translators need analysis of patterns, anticipation, expectations and the musicality of speech. So does anyone involved in public speaking. Politicians using rhetoric are often remembered for their best (or worst) gags. Diplomats and negotiators tread a fine line between the sublime and the ridiculous. Pomposity is undercut by humour for a reason- so anyone with power needs this work. Civil engineers need this book to understand pre-stressed concrete. OK maybe not that one. But basically, if you've ever laughed at anything, you need this book. It's a question of survival. Or as Nihal Arthanayake put it on BBC 5 Live: \"It will make you laugh BETTER if you understand the technicalities.\" Laugh better, people! (Full disclosure: I know Joel and have discussed some of this crap with him in person and online. But even that experience hasn't put me off wanting to read him banging on about it at greater length here.) https://lnkd.in/e-eVv74G\n\nNext in my series, this submission from Miriam Ordonez Clifford. She actually sent me a number of pieces from different genres, but this was the first, and the most interesting: I once found paradise on earth and lost it. A place where the morning sun would glow through dust particles and smog, bathing the earthen sky in perfect hues of pink and orange. Pastel colors scattered across the sky like cotton candy, useless, momentary glimpses of red light enveloping my eyes in wonder. I wanted to touch it, if only for a second; the red light was so close, scattering the particles of pollution and creating something beautiful out of our destructive nature. I wanted to be the red light in the sky. Unlike its sister, blue light, red light does not travel very far. I am like the red light that stays close to home, yearning for the familiar rhythms of life — even when those days were spent in an 8x8 cell, I miss them. Like the pink-toned sky, there is a quiet beauty and comfort in what we grow to know. So, the first line is a cliche, true, but the next does something unexpected: The narrator is romanticizing how the smog would make the dawn perfect, and in the following line, we see that this perfection is due to its artificiality. I think \"creating something beautiful out of our destructive nature\" is too on the nose, however. Enough was there to imply this. \"I wanted to be the red light in the sky. Unlike its sister, blue light, red light does not travel very far. I am like the red light that stays close to home, yearning for the familiar rhythms of life\" is an original thought, trying for poesy albeit awkwardly, and it deepens the character. The passage is overwrought, and Miriam said this was a first draft, but it shows talent. Yet, it's nothing like anything else she sent me, which was all written in third person. Strangely, in those samples the characterization disappeared, and so did the voice. But here, she was able to put us behind the character's eyes. You don't need to write in first person to achieve this, but clearly that helped Miriam. In fiction, before you think of what to say, think of who is saying it. My advice to Miriam, if she wants to try third person again, would be to create a fictive narrator to write through, even one very different from herself.\n\nA TALE OF TWO RANKINS: Years ago I did read & enjoy the first few ‘Rebus’ novels, yet was put off upon picking up a much later one, & realising author Ian Rankin’s style had shifted appreciably towards ‘writing to type’, & inferably for his already established fanbase, who would be better-equipped to understand the many shorthand references & thumbnail evocations of place, atmosphere & character. Likewise, I’ve watched some, albeit not all, of the TV adaptations starring John Hannah & Ken Stott in the eponymous role (2000—2007). Yet, I was intrigued to hear of the latest 2024 BBC TV outing of Edinburgh’s favourite curmudgeon detective, this time portrayed by Richard Rankin (allegedly no relative of the author, which, (f)rankly I don’t believe — they must be some kind of distant cousins). In any event, it’s a fair rendition. I’ve no idea which, if any, of the novels it might be based upon, or where in the timeframe it might be supposed to take place, other than that it appears to be set now (whereas, by rights, Rebus ought to have retired by now, given the first novel was published almost 40 years ago, & cop was already his second career; actually, Ian Rankin ought, more politely, to have killed him off long ago, but I guess he’s got too accustomed to the royalties, particularly as he doesn’t seem to produce much other writing). Richard Rankin (the ‘non-cousin’ of Ian, ahem) puts in a solid performance. While he can’t help his looks, he kept reminding me, in turns, of either Russel Crowe or John Sessions (&, perhaps somewhat unfortunately, more often the latter). I gather Richard was born in the West Central Belt, which shows in his rendering of the accent, whereas the book Rebus is meant to be a Fifer who has spent much of his life in Edinburgh. Thus, this TV version of Rebus comes across as having a somewhat put on ‘Embra’ brogue, perhaps even with a touch of ‘Brigadoon’ about it, which doesn’t quite land true. Perhaps I quibble overmuch. I actually thought Stuart Bowman as gangster, Ger Cafferty, played his role best. Noof Ousellam as rookie gangster, Darryl Christie, was also effective (albeit I don’t reckon a former pupil of Edinburgh private school Stewart’s Melville would make the mistake of referring to it as Stewart Melville’s; when I was there, I remember much being made of the importance of correct use of apostrophe s). Pity he didn’t get his comeuppance. The plot is suitably tense and multilayered, & the filming enjoyable. That said, the overall timeframe feels too short (seems like it’s all meant to take place over only a couple of days). Oh, and I’m pretty sure Edinburgh & Fife aren’t just five minutes away from each other. All told, I would give this 7/10.\n\nHorror and the Post Office I read Hilary Mantel’s historical novel, Wolf Hall, soon after it came out. Her account of monks being hung, drawn and quartered has haunted me ever since. In terms of sheer horror it has stuck in my imagination alongside Murakami’s account of a skinning in The Wind Up Bird Chronicle. I have always been an enthusiastic reader of histories, and have frequently encountered historical reports of such executions as these, but it is these fictional accounts that have truly stayed with me. My friend Tas noticed a similar effect in the dramatisation of the #PostOffice scandal, and wondered on #LinkedIn recently why this account had moved the public so much, when endless documentaries and reports had had so little effect. He offered some thoughts on this, and rightly said it was to do with the power of #storytelling in fiction. But this still leaves us wondering, why does fiction have such an effect? I think it is because of the following, and actually it is not specific to fiction but to the act of writing. As I write this now, I have no idea what I will write next, and as you read it you have no idea either. I might stop here. But of course I don’t. And this play between myself and you, this to and fro between my imagination and yours, in anticipation of what the next word will bring, is also what makes a story alive. (In the instance of my writing, of course, it is much less powerful, although it is still what makes me write.) As a tale is told both the writer and the reader participate in the telling. So when the story is unremittingly horrific the act of telling implicates both the telling and the told in the event that is recounted. To watch a public execution is to be a part of the public nature of it, and to write a fictional account of it is to participate in no smaller measure, because you are reinventing the horror. So when the story of the people who suffered at the hands of the cruelty and neglect of those imposing fines and prison sentences on the innocent is told as fiction, we are there. We are both innocent and guilty too. And then we want blame and redress. In this way, fiction is real and factual documented accounts are not. The fiction creates an event in which we actively participate. When we participate in something that offends our sense of humanity, we rebel and are prompted to act, as even the #government has been prompted to do in the wake of the Post Office drama. I think there is some hope for us in that."
