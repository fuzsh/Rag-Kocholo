        "text": "By Skip Sheffield\n\nFilmmaker Jono Mitchell shares the evolution of a relationship between two seemingly opposite queer friends in Bad Together, his new film releasing to TVOD on December 5 via Dekkoo Films. Over four years, Robbie (played by Andrés Erickson) and Cameron (played by Queer Niro) learn to accept and love one another and themselves. “I really wanted to explore the idea that a lot of the expectations we hold for ourselves, and others can lead to sadness and conflict,” filmmaker Jono Mitchell explains. “Fundamentally you can connect with a person on the most basic level, but ultimately that connection still needs to be built on mutual expectation.”\n\nThe story begins with Robbie, newly dumped, and in such deep need for companionship that he’s willing to embrace the company of anyone who extends a hand. Enter Cameron, the life of the party who appears to revel in the admiration he receives from others. However, behind the happy go lucky exterior is a man who constantly craves validation and is struggling with finding a clear sense of purpose in his life.\n\nRobbie and Cameron are two young men who are desperate to connect with one another but have different ways of achieving the bond. They each offer their own version of love and affection and as they chase the ideal of what each deems to be true friendship, they create a relationship that may not be healthy for either one of them.\n\nMitchell explains he was inspired to write the story based on a similar friendship he experienced a few years ago. “I have an incredible friend who changed my life. He is so special to me, but circumstances within our current stages of life drove us apart,” he recalls. “When everything changed, I had to accept the version of friendship that I idealized didn’t exist anymore. What we became is just as special, but I think I’ll always grieve for what we had.”\n\nFilming for Bad Together took place in Atlanta, Georgia, where Jono Mitchell found the actors who would play Robbie and Cameron. Due to a familiarity with his work, Mitchell didn’t audition Andrés Erickson for the role of Robbie; he offered it to him outright. For his part, Erickson sees several similarities between himself and the role that he plays in Bad Together. “Robbie is a caring guy, but like me he has a tendency to overanalyze, and I think we both like to talk things out as opposed to allowing bad feelings to fester.”\n\nWhere they differ is in their style of communication. “Robbie tends to be petty and more aggressive than I am,” Erickson says.\n\nAs for his choice of Queer Niro in the role of Cameron, Mitchell explains, “When you’re casting a character who may behave in unlikable ways, it’s important to find an actor who will naturally highlight some of the character’s more likable attributes. Queer Niro’s charm makes it believable that someone like Robbie would look past Cameron’s mistakes and embrace him as a friend.”\n\n“Cameron is me, just dialed up some notches,” Queer Niro adds, acknowledging that he played the scenes how he would handle the scenarios in real life. “Cameron is an endearing guy who longs to make something of his life but fears the possible consequences that come from change.” He hopes viewers will consider Cameron’s conundrum when deciding whether they are Team Robbie or Team Cameron. “Obviously, Team Cameron is the correct answer,” he laughs.\n\nTrue to character, Andrés Erickson takes a more neutral stance. “I hope people are reminded to take care of their friendships. People are complicated and they change and letting go can be necessary. It’s sad, but that doesn’t always mean it’s a bad thing.”\n\nHe also commends Jono Mitchell on writing a script that focuses on queer friendship. “It’s not something we see a lot of in queer cinema. There’s often a tendency to focus on the romantic aspects, when in real life things are much more complex and nuanced.”\n\nFilmmaker Jono Mitchell is best known for his work on the Adult Swim digital shows, Dear Jono and Stupid Morning BS. His most recent works include Courtney Gets Possessed (2023) and Miles from Nowhere (2022). He hails from Atlanta, Georgia and in 2023, he was named a “2023 Creative to Watch” by the Atlanta Journal Constitution.\n\nBad Together releases December 5 via Dekkoo Films, a subsidiary of the Dekkoo streaming platform. It will be made available for TVOD rental across numerous platforms including Apple, Amazon, Google, and many others before arriving on the Dekkoo streaming platform in 2024."
