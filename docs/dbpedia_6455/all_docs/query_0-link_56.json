        "text": "Notes\n\nPreface\n\nSeduction is a game of psychology, not beauty, and it is within the grasp of any person to become a master at the game.\n\nA seducer does not turn the power off and onâevery social and personal interaction is seen as a potential seduction. There is never a moment to waste.\n\nSeducers are never self-absorbed. Their gaze is directed outward, not inward.\n\nPleasure is a feeling of being taken past our limits, of being overwhelmedâby another person, by an experience.\n\nFinally, seducers are completely amoral in their approach to life.\n\nEvery seduction has two elements that you must analyze and understand: first, yourself and what is seductive about you; and second, your target and the actions that will penetrate their defenses and create surrender.\n\n\"Most virtue is a demand for greater seduction.\" âNatalie Barney\n\nPart One - the Seductive Character\n\nSuccessful seductions begin with your character, your ability to radiate some quality that attracts people and stirs their emotions in a way that is beyond their control.\n\nThe Siren\n\nA man grows bored with a woman, no matter how beautiful; he yearns for different pleasures, and for adventure.\n\nAll a woman needs to turn this around is to create the illusion that she offers such variety and adventure.\n\nCreate the physical presence of a Siren (heightened sexual allure mixed with a regal and theatrical manner) and he is trapped.\n\nHer time never seems to be taken up by work or chores; she gives the impression that she lives for pleasure and is always available.Â\n\nWhile one part of you seems to scream sex, the other part is coy and naive, as if you were incapable of understanding the effect you are having.\n\nKeys to the Character:\n\nShe represents a powerful male fantasy of a highly sexual, supremely confident, alluring female offering endless pleasure and a bit of danger.\n\nOnce the Siren has made herself stand out from others, she must have two other critical qualities: the ability to get the male to pursue her so feverishly that he loses control; and a touch of the dangerous.\n\nSirens are often fantastically irrational, which is immensely attractive to men who are oppressed by their own reasonableness.\n\nPhysical Qualities\n\nPhysical qualitiesâa scent, a heightened femininity evoked through makeup or through elaborate or seductive clothing.\n\nThe voice. Clearly a critical quality, as the legend indicates, the Sirenâs voice has an immediate animal presence with incredible suggestive power.\n\nThe Siren must have an insinuating voice that hints at the erotic, more often subliminally than overtly.\n\nHer voice is calm and unhurried, as if she had never quite woken upâor left her bed.\n\nBody and adornment. If the voice must lull, the body and its adornment must dazzle.\n\nThe key: everything must dazzle, but must also be harmonious, so that no single ornament draws attention. Your presence must be charged, larger than life, a fantasy come true. Ornament is used to cast a spell and distract.\n\nMovement and demeanor: The Siren moves gracefully and unhurriedly.\n\nDangers\n\nNo matter how enlightened the age, no woman can maintain the image of being devoted to pleasure completely comfortably. And no matter how hard she tries to distance herself from it, the taint of being easy always follows the Siren.\n\nThe Rake\n\nThe Rake is a great female fantasy figureâwhen he desires a woman, brief though that moment may be, he will go to the ends of the earth for her.\n\nThe Ardent Rake teaches us a simple lesson: intense desire has a distracting power on a woman, just as the Sirenâs physical presence does on a man.\n\nThe key is to show no hesitation, to abandon all restraint, to let yourself go, to show that you cannot control yourself and are fundamentally weak.\n\nDo not worry about inspiring mistrust; as long as you are the slave to her charms, she will not think of the aftermath.\n\nThe male is traditionally vulnerable to the visual.\n\nFor women the weakness is language and words.\n\nHe chooses words for their ability to suggest, insinuate, hypnotize, elevate, infect.\n\nRemember: it is the form that matters, not the content. The less your targets focus on what you say, and the more on how it makes them feel, the more seductive your effect. Give your words a lofty, spiritual, literary flavor the better to insinuate desire in your unwitting victims\n\nKeys to the Character:Â Do not imagine that women are the tender creatures that some people would like them to be. Like men, they are deeply attracted to the forbidden, the dangerous, even the slightly evil.\n\nAlways remember: if you are to play the Rake, you must convey a sense of risk and darkness, suggesting to your victim that she is participating in something rare and thrilling.\n\nTo play the Rake, the most obvious requirement is the ability to let yourself go, to draw a woman into the kind of purely sensual moment in which past and future lose meaning.\n\nFinally, a Rakeâs greatest asset is his reputation. Never downplay your bad name, or seem to apologize for it. Instead, embrace it, enhance it. It is what draws women to you.\n\nThere are several things you must be known for: your irresistible attractiveness to women; your uncontrollable devotion to pleasure (this will make you seem weak, but also exciting to be around); your disdain for convention; a rebellious streak that makes you seem dangerous.\n\nThis last element can be slightly hidden; on the surface, be polite and civil, while letting it be known that behind the scenes you are incorrigible.\n\nDangers\n\nLike the Siren, the Rake faces the most danger from members of his own sex.\n\nToday, only stars and the very wealthy can play the Rake with impunity; the rest of us need to be careful.\n\nThe Ideal Lover\n\nYou long for romance? Adventure? Lofty spiritual communion? The Ideal Lover reflects your fantasy. He or she is an artist in creating the illusion you require, idealizing your portrait.\n\nIndeed, oneâs attachment to a man depends largely on the elegance of his leave-taking.\n\nCasanova was perhaps the most successful seducer in history; few women could resist him. His method was simple: on meeting a woman, he would study her, go along with her moods, find out what was missing in her life, and provide it. He made himself the Ideal Lover.\n\nThe Ideal Lover is rare in the modern world, for the role takes effort. You will have to focus intensely on the other person, fathom what she is missing, what he is disappointed by. People will often reveal this in subtle ways: through gesture, tone of voice, a look in the eye.\n\nLet that be a source of infinite opportunity. Be an oasis in the desert of the self-absorbed; few can resist the temptation of following a person who seems so attuned to their desires, to bringing to life their fantasies.\n\nKeys to the Character\n\nEach of us carries inside us an ideal, either of what we would like to become, or of what we want another person to be for us.Â\n\nOur ideal is something we feel is missing inside us.Â Our ideal may be buried in disappointment, but it lurks underneath, waiting to be sparked. If another person seems to have that ideal quality, or to have the ability to bring it out in us, we fall in love.\n\nThe key to following the path of the Ideal Lover is the ability to observe. Ignore your targetsâ words and conscious behavior; focus on the tone of their voice, a blush here, a look thereâthose signs that betray what their words wonât say. Often the ideal is expressed in contradiction.\n\nDangersÂ\n\nThe main dangers in the role of the Ideal Lover are the consequences that arise if you let reality creep in.Â When reality intrudes, distance is often a solution.Â Still, it is always wise to be prudent, and to keep people from glimpsing the less-than-ideal side of your character.\n\nThe Dandy\n\nMost of us feel trapped within the limited roles that the world expects us to play. We are instantly attracted to those who are more fluid, more ambiguous, than we areâthose who create their own persona. Dandies excite us because they cannot be categorized, and hint at a freedom we want for ourselves.\n\nKeys to the Character\n\nThe Dandy displays a true and radical difference from other people, a difference of appearance and manner.\n\nDandies seduce socially as well as sexually; groups form around them, their style is wildly imitated, an entire court or crowd will fall in love with them.\n\nBe different in ways that are both striking and aesthetic, never vulgar; poke fun at current trends and styles, go in a novel direction, and be supremely uninterested in what anyone else is doing.\n\nThe nonconformity of Dandies, however, goes far beyond appearances. It is an attitude toward life that sets them apart; adopt that attitude and a circle of followers will form around you.\n\nDandies are supremely impudent. They donât give a damn about other people, and never try to please.\n\nDandies are masters of the art of living. They live for pleasure, not for work; they surround themselves with beautiful objects and eat and drink with the same relish they show for their clothes.\n\nDangers\n\nThe Dandyâs strength, but also the Dandyâs problem, is that he or she often works through transgressive feelings relating to sex roles. Although this activity is highly charged and seductive, it is also dangerous, since it touches on a source of great anxiety and insecurity.\n\nEven a Dandy, then, must measure out his impudence. A true Dandy knows the difference between a theatrically staged teasing of the powerful and a remark that will truly hurt, offend, or insult.\n\nIt is particularly important to avoid insulting those in a position to injure you.\n\nThe Natural\n\nThe Natural embodies the longed- for qualities of childhoodâspontaneity, sincerity, unpretentiousness.\n\nNaturals also make a virtue out of weakness, eliciting our sympathy for their trials, making us want to protect them and help them.\n\nRemember who you were before you became so polite and self-effacing.\n\nThe following are the main types of the adult Natural. Keep in mind that the greatest natural seducers are often a blend of more than one of these qualities\n\nThe innocent: The primary qualities of innocence are weakness and misunderstanding of the world\n\nThey act like they still see the world through innocent eyes, which in an adult proves doubly humorous.Â\n\nThe imp: Impish children have a fearlessness that we adults have lost. That is because they do not see the possible consequences of their actionsâhow some people might be offended, how they might physically hurt themselves in the process.\n\nJust donât apologize or look contrite, for that would break the spell.\n\nThe wonder: A wonder child has a special, inexplicable talent: a gift for music, for mathematics, for chess, for sport.\n\nAt work in the field in which they have such prodigal skill, these children seem possessed, and their actions effortless.\n\nIf it is a physical talent that they have, they are blessed with unusual energy, dexterity, and spontaneity.\n\nAdult wonders are often former wonder children who have managed, remarkably, to retain their youthful impulsiveness and improvisational skills.\n\nTo play the wonder you need some skill that seems easy and natural, along with the ability to improvise.\n\nIf in fact your skill takes practice, you must hide this and learn to make your work appear effortless.\n\nThe undefensive lover: As people get older, they protect themselves against painful experiences by closing themselves off. The price for this is that they grow rigid, physically and mentally. But children are by nature unprotected and open to experience, and this receptiveness is extremely attractive.\n\nThey often manifest this spirit physically: they are graceful, and seem to age less rapidly than other people.\n\nPeople are drawn to those who expect a lot out of life, whereas they tend to disrespect those who are fearful and undemanding.\n\nWild independence has a provocative effect on us: it appeals to us, while also presenting us with a challengeâwe want to be the one to tame it, to make the spirited person dependent on us. Half of seduction is stirring such competitive desires.\n\nThe more absorbed you seem in your own joy-filled world, the more seductive you become. Do not go halfway: make the fantasy you inhabit as radical and exotic as possible, and you will attract attention like a magnet.\n\nHuman beings are immensely suggestible; their moods will easily spread to the people around them. In fact seduction depends on mimesis, on the conscious creation of a mood or feeling that is then reproduced by the other person. But hesitation and awkwardness are also contagious, and are deadly to seduction.\n\nIf in a key moment you seem indecisive or self-conscious, the other person will sense that you are thinking of yourself, instead of being overwhelmed by his or her charms.\n\nAs an undefensive lover, though, you produce the opposite effect: your victim might be hesitant or worried, but confronted with someone so sure and natural, he or she will be caught up in the mood. Like dancing with someone you lead effortlessly across the dance floor, it is a skill you can learn.\n\nIt is a matter of rooting out the fear and awkwardness that have built up in you over the years, of becoming more graceful with your approach, less defensive when others seem to resist.\n\nDangers\n\nA childish quality can be charming but it can also be irritating; the innocent have no experience of the world, and their sweetness can prove cloying.\n\nBecause total childishness can quickly grate, the most seductive Naturals are those who, like Josephine Baker, combine adult experience and wisdom with a childlike manner.\n\nIn any case it is usually only artists, or people with abundant leisure time, who can afford to go all the way.\n\nSimilarly, the seductive traits of the Natural work best in one who is still young enough for them to seem natural.\n\nThe Coquette\n\nThe ability to delay satisfaction is the ultimate art of seductionâwhile waiting, the victim is held in thrall. Coquettes are the grand masters of this game, orchestrating a back-and-forth movement between hope and frustration.\n\nThey bait with the promise of rewardâthe hope of physical pleasure, happiness, fame by association, powerâall of which, however, proves elusive; yet this only makes their targets pursue them the more.\n\nCoquettes seem totally self-sufficient: they do not need you, they seem to say, and their narcissism proves devilishly attractive. You want to conquer them but they hold the cards. The strategy of the Coquette is never to offer total satisfaction. Imitate the alternating heat and coolness of the Coquette and you will keep the seduced at your heels.\n\nPeople are inherently perverse. An easy conquest has a lower value than a difficult one; we are only really excited by what is denied us, by what we cannot possess in full.\n\nYour greatest power in seduction is your ability to turn away, to make others come after you, delaying their satisfaction.\n\nThe world is full of people who try, people who impose themselves aggressively. They may gain temporary victories, but the longer they are around, the more people want to confound them. They leave no space around themselves, and without space there can be no seduction.\n\nCold Coquettes create space by remaining elusive and making others pursue them. Their coolness suggests a comfortable confidence that is exciting to be around, even though it may not actually exist; their silence makes you want to talk. Their self-containment, their appearance of having no need for other people, only makes us want to do things for them, hungry for the slightest sign of recognition and favor.\n\nKeys to the Character\n\nRemember: the essence of the Coquette lies not in the tease and temptation but in the subsequent step back.\n\nThe Coquette must first and foremost be able to excite the target of his or her attention. The attraction can be sexual, the lure of celebrity, whatever it takes. At the same time, the Coquette sends contrary signals that stimulate contrary responses, plunging the victim into confusion.\n\nRemember: obvious flirting will reveal your intentions too clearly. Better to be ambiguous and even contradictory, frustrating at the same time that you stimulate.\n\nCoquetry depends on developing a pattern to keep the other person off balance.\n\nDangers\n\nCoquettes face an obvious danger: they play with volatile emotions. Every time the pendulum swings, love shifts to hate. So they must orchestrate everything carefully. Their absences cannot be too long, their bouts of anger must be quickly followed by smiles.\n\nThe Charmer\n\nCharm is seduction without sex. Charmers are consummate manipulators, masking their cleverness by creating a mood of pleasure and comfort. Their method is simple: they deflect attention from themselves and focus it on their target. They understand your spirit, feel your pain, adapt to your moods. In the presence of a Charmer you feel better about yourself. Charmers do not argue or fight, complain, or pesterâwhat could be more seductive?Â\n\nThe Laws of Charm:\n\nMake your target the center of attention.\n\nCharmers fade into the background; their targets become the subject of their interest.\n\nMake them the star of the show and they will become addicted to you and grow dependent on you. On a mass level, make gestures of self-sacrifice (no matter how fake) to show the public that you share their pain and are working in their interest.\n\nBe a source of pleasure.\n\nNo one wants to hear about your problems and troubles. Listen to your targetsâ complaints, but more important, distract them from their problems by giving them pleasure.Â\n\nBeing lighthearted and fun is always more charming than being serious and critical.\n\nAn energetic presence is likewise more charming than lethargy, which hints at boredom, an enormous social taboo; and elegance and style will usually win out over vulgarity, since most people like to associate themselves with whatever they think elevated and cultured.\n\nBring antagonism into harmony.\n\nThe Charmer knows how to smooth out conflict. Never stir up antagonisms that will prove immune to your charm; in the face of those who are aggressive, retreat, let them have their little victories.\n\nLull your victims into ease and comfort.\n\nThe key to making your victims feel comfortable is to mirror them, adapt to their moods. People are narcissistsâthey are drawn to those most similar to themselves.\n\nShow calm and self-possession in the face of adversity.\n\nAdversity and setbacks actually provide the perfect setting for charm. Showing a calm, unruffled exterior in the face of unpleasantness puts people at ease.\n\nNever whine, never complain, never try to justify yourself.\n\nMake yourself useful. If done subtly, your ability to enhance the lives of others will be devilishly seductive.Â\n\nFollow-through is key: so many people will charm by promising a person great thingsâa better job, a new contact, a big favorâbut if they do not follow through they make enemies instead of friends.\n\nThe Art of Charm\n\nA gruff exterior may hide a person dying for warmth; a repressed, sober-looking type may actually be struggling to conceal uncontrollable emotions. That is the key to charmâfeeding what has been repressed or denied.\n\nFirst, they donât talk much about themselves, which heightens their mystery and disguises their limitations.\n\nSecond, they seem to be interested in us, and their interest is so delightfully focused that we relax and open up to them.\n\nFinally Charmers are pleasant to be around. They have none of most peopleâs ugly qualitiesânagging, complaining, self-assertion.\n\nTime is the greatest weapon you have. Patiently keep in mind a long-term goal and neither person nor army can resist you. And charm is the best way of playing for time, of widening your options in any situation.\n\nDangers\n\nThere are those who are immune to a Charmer; particularly cynics, and confident types who do not need validation. These people tend to view Charmers as slippery and deceitful, and they can make problems for you. The solution is to do what most Charmers do by nature: befriend and charm as many people as possible. Secure your power through numbers and you will not have to worry about the few you cannot seduce.\n\nThe Charismatic\n\nCharisma is a presence that excites us. It comes from an inner qualityâself-confidence, sexual energy, sense of purpose, contentmentâthat most people lack and want. This quality radiates outward, permeating the gestures of Charismatics, making them seem extraordinary and superior, and making us imagine there is more to them than meets the eye: they are gods, saints, stars. Charismatics can learn to heighten their charisma with a piercing gaze, fiery oratory, an air of mystery. They can seduce on a grand scale.\n\nLearn to create the charismatic illusion by radiating intensity while remaining detached.\n\nCharisma is seduction on a mass level. Charismatics make crowds of people fall in love with them, then lead them along.\n\nThey do not explain where their confidence or contentment comes from, but it can be felt by everyone; it radiates outward, without the appearance of conscious effort. The face of the Charismatic is usually animated, full of energy, desire, alertness-the look of a lover, one that is instantly appealing, even vaguely sexual.\n\nThe following are basic qualities that will help create the illusion of charisma:\n\nPurpose. If people believe you have a plan, that you know where you are going, they will follow you instinctively. The direction does not matter: pick a cause, an ideal, a vision and show that you will not sway from your goal.\n\nMystery. Mystery lies at charismaâs heart, but it is a particular kind of mysteryâa mystery expressed by contradiction. Since most people are predictable, the effect of these contradictions is devastatingly charismatic.Â\n\nSaintliness. Most of us must compromise constantly to survive; saints do not. They must live out their ideals without caring about the consequences.\n\nEloquence. A Charismatic relies on the power of words. The reason is simple: words are the quickest way to create emotional disturbance.\n\nTo bring off this kind of eloquence, it helps if the speaker is as emotional, as caught up in words, as the audience is.\n\nYet eloquence can be learned: the devices La Pasionaria usedâ catchwords, slogans, rhythmic repetitions, phrases for the audience to repeatâcan easily be acquired.\n\nTheatricality. A Charismatic is larger than life, has extra presence. Actors have studied this kind of presence for centuries; they know how to stand on a crowded stage and command attention.\n\nUninhibitedness. Most people are repressed, and have little access to their unconscious.\n\nYou will first have to show that you are less inhibited than your audienceâthat you radiate a dangerous sexuality, have no fear of death, are delightfully spontaneous.\n\nFervency. You need to believe in something, and to believe in it strongly enough for it to animate all your gestures and make your eyes light up.\n\nA prerequisite for fiery belief is some great cause to rally aroundâa crusade.\n\nVulnerability. Charismatics display a need for love and affection.Â\n\nAdventurousness. Charismatics are unconventional. They have an air of adventure and risk that attracts the bored. Be brazen and courageous in your actionsâbe seen taking risks for the good of others.\n\nMagnetism. If any physical attribute is crucial in seduction, it is the eyes. They reveal excitement, tension, detachment, without a word being spoken. The demeanor of Charismatics may be poised and calm, but their eyes are magnetic; they have a piercing gaze that disturbs their targetsâ emotions, exerting force without words or action.\n\nAll of these skills are acquirable.\n\nPractice the effect you desire.\n\nDo not apologize or go halfway. The more unbridled you seem, the more magnetic the effect.\n\nBelieve it or not, a plain-looking man or woman with a clear vision, a quality of single-mindedness, and practical skills can be devastatingly charismatic, provided it is matched with some success. Never underestimate the power of success in enhancing oneâs aura.\n\nThat is the appearance you want: you do not need anything or anyone, you are fulfilled.\n\nThe less obvious you are, the better: let people conclude that you are happy, rather than hearing it from you. Let them see it in your unhurried manner, your gentle smile, your ease and comfort.\n\nRemember: being aloof and distant only stimulates the effect. People will fight for the slightest sign of your interest.\n\nDangers\n\nPsychologists talk of âerotic fatigueââthe moments after love in which you feel tired of it, resentful. Reality creeps in, love turns to hate. Erotic fatigue is a threat to all Charismatics.\n\nThe only defense is to master your charisma.\n\nThe better kind of charisma is created consciously and is kept under control.\n\nRemember: charisma depends on success, and the best way to maintain success, after the initial charismatic rush, is to be practical and even cautious.\n\nFinally, there is nothing more dangerous than succeeding a Charismatic.\n\nThey miss their inspirer and blame the successor. Avoid this situation at all costs. If it is unavoidable, do not try to continue what the Charismatic started; go in a new direction.\n\nThe Star\n\nDaily life is harsh, and most of us constantly seek escape from it in fantasies and dreams. Stars feed on this weakness; standing out from others through a distinctive and appealing style, they make us want to watch them.\n\nAt the same time, they are vague and ethereal, keeping their distance, and letting us imagine more than is there.Â\n\nIts principal requirement is self-distance. If you see yourself as an object, then others will too. An ethereal, dreamlike air will heighten the effect.\n\nYou are a blank screen. Float through life noncommittally and people will want to seize you and consume you.Â\n\nAnd keep your distanceâlet people identify with you without being able to touch you.\n\nKeys to the Character\n\nFirst, you must have such a large presence that you can fill your targetâs mind the way a close-up fills the screen. You must have a style or presence that makes you stand out from everyone else.\n\nSecond, cultivate a blank, mysterious face, the center that radiates Starness. This allows people to read into you whatever they want to, imagining they can see your character, even your soul.\n\nStars make us want to know more about them. You must learn to stir peopleâs curiosity by letting them glimpse something in your private life, something that seems to reveal an element of your personality.\n\nLet them fantasize and imagine. A trait that often triggers this reaction is a hint of spirituality, which can be devilishly seductive, like James Deanâs interest in Eastern philosophy and the occult.\n\nHints of goodness and big-heartedness can have a similar effect.\n\nThe things you loveâpeople, hobbies, animalsâreveal the kind of moral beauty that people like to see in a Star. Exploit this desire by showing people peeks of your private life, the causes you fight for, the person you are in love with (for the moment).\n\nRemember: everyone is a public performer. People never know exactly what you think or feel; they judge you on your appearance.\n\nDangers\n\nStars create illusions that are pleasurable to see. The danger is that people tire of themâthe illusion no longer fascinatesâand turn to another Star.\n\nYou must keep all eyes on you at any cost.\n\nDo not worry about notoriety, or about slurs on your image; we are remarkably forgiving of our Stars.\n\nThe Anti-Seducer\n\nSeducers draw you in by the focused, individualized attention they pay to you. Anti-Seducers are the opposite: insecure, self-absorbed, and unable to grasp the psychology of another person, they literally repel. Anti-Seducers have no self-awareness, and never realize when they are pestering, imposing, talking too much. They lack the subtlety to create the promise of pleasure that seduction requires. Root out anti-seductive qualities in yourself, and recognize them in othersâthere is no pleasure or profit in dealing with the Anti-Seducer.\n\nAnti-Seducers come in many shapes and kinds, but almost all of them share a single attribute, the source of their repellence: insecurity.\n\nStamp ungenerosity out. It is an impediment to power and a gross sin in seduction.\n\nTypes of Anti-Seducer\n\nThe Brute.Â\n\nIf seduction is a kind of ceremony or ritual, part of the pleasure is its durationâthe time it takes, the waiting that increases anticipation. Brutes have no patience for such things; they are concerned only with their own pleasure, never with yours.\n\nThe Suffocator.Â\n\nSuffocators fall in love with you before you are even half-aware of their existence.\n\nA subvariant of the Suffocator is the Doormat, a person who slavishly imitates you.\n\nThe Moralizer.Â\n\nSeduction is a game, and should be undertaken with a light heart. All is fair in love and seduction; morality never enters the picture. The character of the Moralizer, however, is rigid. These are people who follow fixed ideas and try to make you bend to their standards.\n\nThe Tightwad.Â\n\nCheapness signals more than a problem with money. It is a sign of something constricted in a personâs characterâsomething that keeps them from letting go or taking a risk. It is the most anti-seductive trait of all, and you cannot allow yourself to give in to it.\n\nThe Bumbler.Â\n\nBumblers are self-conscious, and their self-consciousness heightens your own.\n\nIn seduction, the key weapon is boldness, refusing the target the time to stop and think. Bumblers have no sense of timing.\n\nThe Windbag.Â\n\nThe most effective seductions are driven by looks, indirect actions, physical lures. Words have a place, but too much talk will generally break the spell, heightening surface differences and weighing things down.\n\nThe Reactor.Â\n\nReactors are far too sensitive, not to you but to their own egos. They comb your every word and action for signs of a slight to their vanity.\n\nThe Vulgarian.Â\n\nVulgarians are inattentive to the details that are so important in seduction. You can see this in their personal appearanceâtheir clothes are tasteless by any standardâand in their actions: they do not know that it is sometimes better to control oneself and refuse to give in to oneâs impulses.\n\nThere is nothing more anti-seductive than feeling that someone has assumed that you are theirs, that you cannot possibly resist them. The slightest appearance of this kind of conceit is deadly to seduction; you must prove yourself, take your time, win your targetâs heart.\n\nExcessive pride, without anything to justify it, is highly anti-seductive.\n\nThe person who is obviously angling for money or other material reward can only repel. If that is your intention, if you are looking for something other than pleasureâfor money, for powerânever show it.\n\nThe best way to avoid entanglements with Anti-Seducers is to recognize them right away and give them a wide berth, but they often deceive us.\n\nDo not get angryâthat may only encourage them or exacerbate their anti-seductive tendencies. Instead, act distant and indifferent, pay no attention to them, make them feel how little they matter to you. The best antidote to an Anti-Seducer is often to be anti-seductive yourself\n\nRemember: seduction is a game of attention, of slowly filling the other personâs mind with your presence. Distance and inattention will create the opposite effect, and can be used as a tactic when the need arises.\n\nThe Seducerâs Victims - the Eighteen Types\n\nVictims are categorized by that they feel they are missing in lifeâadventure, attention, romance, a, naughty experience, mental or physical stimulation, etc.. Once you identify their type, you have the necessary ingredients for a seduction: you will be the one to give them what they lack and cannot get on their own.\n\nIn studying potential victims, learn to see the reality behind the appearance. A timid person may yearn to play the star; a prude may long for a transgressive thrill.\n\nNever try to seduce your own type.\n\nVictim Theory\n\nNobody in this world feels whole and complete. We all sense some gap in our character something we need or want but cannot get on our own. When we fall in love, it is often with someone who seems to fill that gap.\n\nLook at the people around you. Forget their social, exterior, their obvious character traits: look behind all of that, focusing on the gaps, the missing pieces in their psyche. That is the raw material of any seduction. Pay close attention to their clothes; their gestures, their offhand comments, the things in their house certain looks in their eyes get them to talk about their past, particularly past romances. And slowly the outline of those missing pieces will come into view.\n\nUnderstand: people are constantly giving out signals as to what they lack. They long for completeness, whether the illusion of it or the reality, and if it has to come from another person, that person has tremendous power over them.Â\n\nBoth deliberately and unconsciously, we often develop, a social exterior designed specifically to disguise our weaknesses and lacks.\n\nMost importantly, expunge the nasty habit of thinking that other people have the same lacks you do.\n\nNever try to seduce someone who is of your own type. You will be like two puzzles missing the same parts.\n\nThe Types\n\nThe Reformed Rake or Siren.Â\n\nPeople of this type were once happy-go-lucky seducers who had their way with the opposite sex. But the day came when they were forced to give this up.\n\nThese types are ripe for the picking: all that is required is that you cross their path and offer them the opportunity to resume their rakish or siren ways. Their blood will stir and the call of their youth will overwhelm them.\n\nIt is critical, though, to give these types the illusion that they are the ones doing the seducing.\n\nDo not be put off if they are in a relationship; a preexisting commitment is often the perfect foil.\n\nThe Disappointed Dreamer.Â\n\nAs children, these types probably spent a lot of time alone. To entertain themselves they developed a powerful fantasy life, fed by books and films and other kinds of popular culture.\n\nYou can recognize this type by the books they read and films they go to, the way their ears prick up when told of the real-life adventures some people manage to live out.\n\nThese types make for excellent and satisfying victims. First they usually have a great deal of pent-up passion and energy, which, you can release and focus on yourself. They also have great imaginations and will, respond to anything vaguely mysterious or romantic that you offer them.\n\nIf you give them a part of what they want they will imagine the rest. At All cost, do not let reality break the illusion you are creating.\n\nThe Pampered Royal.Â\n\nThese people were the classic spoiled children.\n\nBut their ceaseless search for variety is tiring for them and comes with a price: work problems, string of unsatisfying romances, friends scattered across the globe.\n\nWhat the Pampered Prince or Princess is really looking for is one person, that parental figure, who will give them the spoiling they crave.\n\nTo seduce this type be ready to provide a lot of distractionânew places to visit, novel experiences, color, spectacle.\n\nRecognize these types by the turmoil in their pastâjob changes, travel, short-term relationshipsâand by the air of aristocracy no matter their social class.\n\nThe New PrudeÂ\n\nSexual prudery still exists but it is less common than it was Prudery, however is never just about sex; a prude someone who is excessively concerned with appearances, with what society considers appropriate and acceptable behavior.\n\nThe New Prude excessively concerned with standards of goodness, fairness, political sensitivity, tastefulness, etc. What marks the New Prude, though, as well as the old one, is that deep down they are actually excited and intrigued by guilty, transgressive pleasures.\n\nThey tend to wear drab colors; they certainly never take fashion risks. They can be very judgmental and critical of people who do take risks and are less correct. They are also addicted to routine, which gives them a way to tamp down their inner turmoil.\n\nThe New Prude will often be most tempted by someone with dangerous or naughty side.\n\nYou can often draw a New Prude into a seduction, in fact by giving them the chance to criticize you on even try to reform you.\n\nThe Crushed Star\n\nThe problem with Crushed Stars is that at one point in their lives they did find themselves the center of attentionâperhaps they were beautiful, charming and effervescent, perhaps they were athletes, or had some other talentâbut those days are gone.\n\nYou can recognize. Crushed Stars by certain unguarded moments: they suddenly receive some attention in a social setting, and it makes them glow; they mention their glory days, and there is a little glint in the eye; a little wine in the system and they become effervesce.\n\nSeducing this type is simple: just make them the center of attention.\n\nWhen you are with them act as if they were stars and you were basking in their glow.\n\nGet them to talk; particularly about themselves.\n\nThe Novice.Â\n\nWhat separates Novices from ordinary innocent young people is that they are fatally curious.\n\nSeducing a Novice is easy. To do it well, however, requires bit of art. Novices are interested in people with experience, particularly people with a touch of corruption and evil. Make that touch too strong, though, and it will intimidate and frighten them. What works best with at Novice is a mix of qualities. You are somewhat childlike yourself, with playful spirit. At the same time, it is clear that you have hidden depths, even sinister ones.\n\nEverything must be romantic, even including the evil and dark side of life.\n\nSeductive language works wonders on Novice as does attention to detail. Spectacles and colorful, events appeal to their sensitive senses\n\nThe Conqueror.Â\n\nThese types have an unusual amount of energy, which they find difficult to control. They are always on the prowl for people to conquer, obstacles to surmount.\n\nYou will not always recognize. Conquerors by their exteriorâthey can seem a little shy in social situation and can have a degree of reserve. Look not at their words or appearance but at their actions, in work and in relationships.\n\nYou want to give them a good chase. Being a little difficult or moody, using coquetry, will often do the trick.\n\nTo break them in, keep them charging back and forth like a bull.\n\nThe Conqueror is generally male but there are plenty of female Conquerors out there.\n\nThe Exotic Fetishist.Â\n\nMost of us are excited and intrigued by the exotic. What separates Exotic Fetishists from the rest of us is the degree of this interest, which seems to govern all their choices in life.\n\nThese types are easy to recognize. They like to travel; their houses are filled with objects from faraway places, they fetishize the music or art of this or that foreign culture. They often have a strong rebellious streak.\n\nClearly the way to seduce them is to position yourself as exoticâif you do not at least appear to come from a different background or race, or to have some alien aura, you should not even bother.\n\nOne variation on this type is the man or woman who is trapped in a stultifying relationship, a banal occupation, a dead-end town.\n\nThese Exotic Fetishists are better victims than the self-loathing kind, because you can offer them a temporary escape from whatever oppresses them.\n\nThe Drama Queen.Â\n\nThere are people who cannot do without some constant drama in their livesâit is their way of deflecting boredom.\n\nWith this type you have to be willing and able to give them the mental rough treatment they desire.\n\nYou will recognize Drama Queens by the number of people who have hurt them, the tragedies and traumas that have befallen them.\n\nThe Professor.Â\n\nThese types cannot get out of the trap of analyzing and criticizing everything that crosses their path. Their mind are overdeveloped and overstimulated. Even when they talk about love or sex, it is with great thought and analysis.\n\nThey would like to escape their mental prisons, they would like pure physicality, without any analysis, but they cannot get there on their own.\n\nDeep down they long to be overwhelmed by someone with physical presenceâa Rake or a Siren, for instance.\n\nLet your Professors keep their sense of mental superiority; let them judge you.\n\nYou are giving them what no one else can give themâphysical stimulation.\n\nThe Beauty.Â\n\nFrom early on in life, the Beauty is gazed at by others. Their desire to look at her is the source of her power, but also the source of much unhappiness: she constantly worries that her powers are waning that she is no longer attracting attention.\n\nMost important in this seduction is to validate those parts of the Beauty that no one else appreciatesâher intelligence (generally higher than people imagine), her skills, her character.\n\nIntellectual stimulation will work well on the Beauty, distracting her from her doubts and insecurities, and making it seem that you value that side of her personality.\n\nThe Beauty would love to be more active and to actually do some chasing of her own. A little coquettishness can work well here: at some point in all your worshipping, you might go a little cold, inviting her to come after you.\n\nThe Aging Baby.Â\n\nSome people refuse to grow up.\n\nIn their twenties they can be charming, in their thirties interesting, but by the time they reach their forties they are beginning to wear thin.\n\nThe Aging Baby does not want competition, but an adult figure. If you desire to seduce this type, you must be prepared to be responsible, staid one.\n\nAct the loving adult to the hilt, never judging on criticizing their behavior, and a strong attachment will form.\n\nThe Rescuer\n\nYou will recognize these types by their empathyâthey listen well and try to get you to open up an talk. You will also notice they have histories of relationships with dependent and troubled people.\n\nRescuers can make excellent victims, particularly if you enjoy chivalrous or maternal attention.\n\nIf you are a man, play the boy who cannot deal with this harsh world; a female Rescuer will envelop you in maternal attention, gaining for herself the added satisfaction of feeling more powerful and in control than a man.\n\nExaggerate your weaknesses, but not through overt words or gesturesâlet them sense that you have had too little love, that you have had a string of bad relationships, that you have gotten a raw deal in life.\n\nYou can also invite moral rescue: you are bad. You have done bad things. You need a stern yet loving hand.\n\nThe RouÃ©.Â\n\nThese types have lived the good life and experienced many pleasures. They probably have, or once had, a good deal of money to finance their hedonistic lives.\n\nRouÃ©s are consummate seducers, but there is one type that can easily seduce themâthe young and the innocent.\n\nIf you should want to seduce them, you will probably have to be somewhat young and to have retained at least the appearance of innocence.\n\nIt is also good to seem to resist their advances: RouÃ©s will think it lively and exciting to chase you. You can even seem to dislike or distrust themâthat will really spur them on. By being the one who resists, you control the dynamic.\n\nThe Idol Worshiper.Â\n\nEveryone feels an inner lack but Idol Worshipers have a bigger emptiness than most people. They cannot be satisfied with themselves, so they search the world for something to worship, something to fill their inner void.\n\nIdol Worshipers are easy to spotâthey are the ones pouring their energies into some cause or religion.\n\nThe way to seduce these types is to simply become their object of worship, to take the place of the cause or religion to which they are so dedicated. At first you may have to seem to share their spiritual interests, joining them in their worship, or perhaps exposing them to a new cause; eventually you will displace.\n\nKeep two things in mind when seducing this type.\n\nFirst, they tend to have overactive minds, which can make them quite suspicious. Because they often lack physical stimulation, and because physical stimulation will distract them, give them some: a mountain trek, a boat trip or sex will do the trick.\n\nSecond, they often suffer from low self-esteem. Do not try to raise it; they will see through you, and your efforts at praising them will clash with their own self-image. They are to worship you; you are not to worship them.\n\nThe Sensualist.Â\n\nWhat marks these types is not their love of pleasure but their overactive senses. Sometimes they show this quality in their appearanceâtheir interest in fashion, color, style. But sometimes it is more subtle: because they are so sensitive, they are often quite shy, and they will shrink from standing out or being flamboyant.\n\nYou will recognize them by how responsive they are to their environment, how they cannot stand a room without sunlight, are depressed by certain colors, or excited by certain smells.\n\nThe key to seducing them is to aim for their senses, to take them to beautiful places, pay attention to detail, envelop them in spectacle, and of course use plenty of physical lures.\n\nSensualists, like animals, can be baited with colors and smells. Appeal to as many senses as possible, keeping your targets distracted and weak.\n\nThe Lonely Leader.Â\n\nPowerful people are not necessarily different from everyone else, but they are treated differently, and this has a big effect on their personalities.\n\nLonely Leaders long to be seduced, to have someone break through their isolation and overwhelm them.\n\nTo seduce such types, it is better to act like their equal or even their superiorâthe kind of treatment they never get. If you are blunt with them you will seem genuine, and they will be touched.\n\nLonely Leaders can be made emotional by inflicting some pain, followed by tenderness.\n\nThis is one of the hardest types to seduce, not only because they are suspicious but because their minds are burdened with cares and responsibilities. They have less mental space for a seduction. You will have to be patient and clever, slowly filling their minds with thoughts of you.\n\nThe Floating Gender\n\nPeople of the Floating Gender type feel that the separation of the sexes into such distinct genders is a burden.\n\nWhat Floating Gender types are really looking for is another person of uncertain gender, their counterpart from the opposite sex. Show them that in your presence and they can relax, express the repressed side of their character.\n\nIf you are not of the Floating Gender, leave this type alone. You will only inhibit them and create more discomfort.\n\nPart Two - the Seductive Process\n\nYou will not seduce anyone by simply depending on your engaging personality, or by occasionally doing something noble or alluring.\n\nSeduction is a process that occurs over timeâthe longer you take and the slower you go, the deeper you will penetrate into the mind of your victim.\n\nIt is an art that requires patience, focus, and strategic thinking.\n\nYou need to always be one step ahead of your victim, throwing dust in their eyes, casting a spell, keeping them off balance.\n\nTo help you move the seduction along, the chapters are arranged in four phases, each phase with a particular goal to aim for:\n\ngetting the victim to think of you;\n\ngaining access to their emotions by creating moments of pleasure and confusion;\n\ngoing deeper by working on their unconscious, stirring up repressed desires;\n\nand finally, inducing physical surrender\n\nAt all cost, resist the temptation to hurry to the climax of your seduction, or to improvise. You are not being seductive but selfish. Everything in daily life is hurried and improvised, and you need to offer something different\n\nPhase One: Separation - Stirring Interest and Desire\n\nOnce you have decided whom to seduce (1: Choose the right victim), your first task is to get your victimsâ attention, to stir interest in you.\n\nFor those who might be more resistant or difficult, you should try a slower and more insidious approach, first winning their friendship (2: Create a false sense of securityâapproach indirectly); for those who are bored and less difficult to reach, a more dramatic approach will work, either fascinating them with a mysterious presence (3: Send mixed signals) or seeming to be someone who is coveted and fought over by others (4: Appear to be an object of desire).\n\nOnce the victim is properly intrigued, you need to transform their interest into something strongerâdesire.\n\nDesire is generally preceded by feelings of emptiness, of something missing inside that needs fulfillment.\n\nYou must deliberately instill such feelings, make your victims aware of the adventure and romance that are lacking in their lives (5: Create a needâstir anxiety and discontent). If they see you as the one to fill their emptiness, interest will blossom into desire.\n\nThe desire should be stoked by subtly planting ideas in their minds, hints of the seductive pleasures that await them (6: Master the art of insinuation).\n\nMirroring your victimâs values, indulging them in their wants and moods will charm and delight them (7: Enter their spirit).\n\nWithout realizing how it has happened, more and more of their thoughts now revolve around you.\n\nThe time has come for something stronger. Lure them with an irresistible pleasure or adventure (8: Create temptation) and they will follow your lead.\n\nChapter 1 - Choose the Right Victim\n\nEverything depends on the target of your seduction. Study your prey thoroughly, and choose only those who will prove susceptible to your charms.\n\nThe right victims are those for whom you can fill a void, who see in you something exotic.\n\nThey are often isolated or at least somewhat unhappy (perhaps because of recent adverse circumstances), or can easily be made soâfor the completely contented person is almost impossible to seduce.\n\nThe perfect victim has some natural quality that attracts you. The strong emotions this quality inspires will help make your seductive maneuvers seem more natural and dynamic. The perfect victim allows for the perfect chase.\n\nThe perfect victim is the person who stirs you in a way that cannot be explained in words, whose effect on you has nothing to do with superficialities. He or she often has a quality that you yourself lack, and may even secretly envy.\n\nThere should be a little bit of tensionâthe victim may fear you a little, even slightly dislike you.\n\nBe more creative in choosing your prey and you will be rewarded with a more exciting seduction.\n\nOf course, it means nothing if the potential victim is not open to your influence. Test the person first. Once you feel that he or she is also vulnerable to you then the hunting can begin.\n\nKeys to Seduction\n\nHow do you recognize your victims? By the way they respond to you.Â You should not pay so much attention to their conscious responses.\n\nInstead, pay greater attention to those responses outside conscious controlâa blush, an involuntary mirroring of some gesture of yours, an unusual shyness, even perhaps a flash of anger or resentment.Â\n\nLike Valmont, you can also recognize the right targets by the effect they are having on you. Perhaps they make you uneasy.\n\nWhen a person has such a deep effect on you, it transforms all of your subsequent maneuvers. Your face and gestures become more animated. You have more energy; when victims resist you (as a good victim should) you in turn will be more creative, more motivated to overcome their resistance.\n\nLook at the types you have not considered beforeâthat is where you will find challenge and adventure.Â\n\nOn the other hand, you should generally avoid people who are preoccupied with business or workâseduction demands attention, and busy people have too little space in their minds for you to occupy.\n\nChapter 2 - Create a False Sense of Security -Â Approach Indirectly\n\nIf you are too direct early on, you risk stirring up a resistance that will never be lowered.\n\nApproach through a third party, or seem to cultivate a relatively neutral relationship, moving gradually from friend to lover.\n\nArrange an occasional âchanceâ encounter, as if you and your target were destined to become acquaintedânothing is more seductive than a sense of destiny. Lull the target into feeling secure, then strike.\n\nFirst, your friendly conversations with your targets will bring you valuable information about their characters, their tastes, their weaknesses, the childhood yearnings that govern their adult behavior.\n\nSecond, by spending time with your targets you can make them comfortable with you. Believing you are interested only in their thoughts, in their company, they will lower their resistance, dissipating the usual tension between the sexes.\n\nAt this point any offhand comment, any slight physical contact, will spark a different thought, which will catch them off-guard: perhaps there could be something else between you.\n\nOnce that feeling has stirred, they will wonder why you havenât made a move, and will take the initiative themselves, enjoying the illusion that they are in control. There is nothing more effective in seduction than making the seduced think that they are the ones doing the seducing.\n\nThe first move to master is simple: once you have chosen the right person, you must make the target come to you. If, in the opening stages, you can make your targets think that they are the ones making the first approach, you have won the game.\n\nYou can also play cat and mouse with them, first seeming interested, then stepping backâactively luring them to follow you into your web.\n\nBanal conversation can be a brilliant tactic; it hypnotizes the target. The dullness of your front gives the subtlest suggestive word, the slightest look, an amplified power.\n\nNever mention love and you make its absence speak volumesâyour victims will wonder why you never discuss your emotions.\n\nLearn to disguise your feelings and let people figure out what is happening for themselves.\n\nIn all arenas of life, you should never give the impression that you are angling for somethingâthat will raise a resistance that you will never lower. Learn to approach people from the side.\n\nReversal\n\nThe indirect, carefully constructed seduction may reduce the number of your conquests, but more than compensate by their quality.\n\nChapter 3 - Send Mixed Signals\n\nOnce people are aware of your presence, and perhaps vaguely intrigued, you need to stir their interest before it settles on someone else.\n\nWhat is obvious and striking may attract their attention at first, but that attention is often short-lived; in the long run, ambiguity is much more potent.\n\nMost of us are much too obvious âinstead, be hard to figure out. Send mixed signals: both tough and tender, both spiritual and earthy, both innocent and cunning. A mix of qualities suggests depth, which fascinates even as it confuses.\n\nAn elusive, enigmatic aura will make people want to know more, drawing them into your circle. Create such a power by hinting at something contradictory within you.\n\nTo deepen their interest, you must hint at a complexity that cannot be grasped in a week or two. You are an elusive mystery, an irresistible lure, promising great pleasure if only it can be possessed.\n\nThe key to both attracting and holding attention is to radiate mystery. And no one is naturally mysterious, at least not for long; mystery is something you have to work at, a ploy on your part, and something that must be used early on in the seduction.\n\nLet one part of your character show, so everyone notices it.\n\nBut also send out a mixed signalâsome sign that you are not what you seem, a paradox. Do not worry if this underquality is a negative one, like danger, cruelty, or amorality; people will be drawn to the enigma anyway, and pure goodness is rarely seductive.\n\nKeys to Seduction\n\nIt is actually quite easy to create that first stirâan alluring style of dress, a suggestive glance, something extreme about you. But what happens next?\n\nYour attractiveness will pass unless you spark the more enduring kind of spell that makes people think of you in your absence. That means engaging their imaginations, making them think there is more to you than what they see. Once they start embellishing your image with their fantasies, they are hooked.\n\nThis must, however, be done early on, before your targets know too much and their impressions of you are set. It should occur the moment they lay eyes on you. By sending mixed signals in that first encounter, you create a little surprise, a little tension: you seem to be one thing (innocent, brash, intellectual, witty), but you also throw them a glimpse of something else (devilish, shy, spontaneous, sad). Keep things subtle: if the second quality is too strong, you will seem schizophrenic.\n\nTo capture and hold attention, you need to show attributes that go against your physical appearance, creating depth and mystery. If you have a sweet face and an innocent air, let out hints of something dark, even vaguely cruel in your character. It.\n\nA potent variation on this theme is the blending of physical heat and emotional coldness.\n\nRemember: that first impression, that entrance, is critical. To show too much desire for attention is to signal insecurity, and will often drive people away; play it too cold and disinterested, on the other hand, and no one will bother coming near. The trick is to combine the two attitudes at the same moment. It is the essence of coquetry.\n\nThese principles have applications far beyond sexual seduction. To hold the attention of a broad public, to seduce them into thinking about you, you need to mix your signals. Display too much of one qualityâeven if it is a noble one, like knowledge or efficiencyâand people will feel that you lack humanity. We are all complex and ambiguous, full of contradictory impulses; if you show only one side, even if it is your good side, you will wear on peopleâs nerves.\n\nReversal\n\nThe complexity you signal to other people will only affect them properly if they have the capacity to enjoy a mystery. Some people like things simple, and lack the patience to pursue a person who confuses them. They prefer to be dazzled and overwhelmed.\n\nEverything depends on your target: do not bother creating depth for people who are insensitive to it, or who may even be put off or disturbed by it. You can recognize such types by their preference for the simpler pleasures in life, their lack of patience for a more nuanced story. With them, keep it simple.\n\nChapter 4 - Appear to Be an Object of Desire -Â Create Triangles\n\nWe want what other people want. To draw your victims closer and make them hungry to possess you, you must create an aura of desirabilityâof being wanted and courted by many. It will become a point of vanity for them to be the preferred object of your attention, to win you away from a crowd of admirers.\n\nManufacture the illusion of popularity by surrounding yourself with members of the opposite sexâfriends, former lovers, present suitors. Create triangles that stimulate rivalry and raise your value. Build a reputation that precedes you: if many have succumbed to your charms, there must be a reason.\n\nOur desire for another person almost always involves social considerations: we are attracted to those who are attractive to other people.\n\nAnd the most effective way to create that illusion is to create a triangle: impose another person between you and your victim, and subtly make your victim aware of how much this other person wants you.\n\nThe third point on the triangle does not have to be just one person: surround yourself with admirers, reveal your past conquestsâin other words, envelop yourself in an aura of desirability.\n\nKeys to Seduction\n\nDesirability is a social illusion.\n\nMake people compete for your attention, make them see you as sought after by everyone else. The aura of desirability will envelop you.\n\nYour reputationâyour illustrious past as a seducerâis an effective way of creating an aura of desirability.\n\nMen who believe that a rakish reputation will make women fear or distrust them, and should be played down, are quite wrong. On the contrary, it makes them more attractive.\n\nYour own reputation may not be so alluring, but you must find a way to suggest to your victim that others, many others, have found you desirable. There is nothing like a restaurant full of empty tables to persuade you not to go in.\n\nA variation on the triangle strategy is the use of contrasts: careful exploitation of people who are dull or unattractive may enhance your desirability by comparison. At a social affair, for instance, make sure that your target has to chat with the most boring person available.\n\nThe use of contrasts has vast political ramifications, for a political figure must also seduce and seem desirable. Learn to play up the qualities that your rivals lack.\n\nFinally, appearing to be desired by others will raise your value, but often how you carry yourself can influence this as well. Do not let your targets see you so often; keep your distance, seem unattainable, out of their reach. An object that is rare and hard to obtain is generally more prized.\n\nChapter 5 - Create a Need-Stir Anxiety and Discontent\n\nA perfectly satisfied person cannot be seduced. Tension and disharmony must be instilled in your targetsâ minds. Stir within them feelings of discontent, an unhappiness with their circumstances and with themselves: their life lacks adventure, they have strayed from the ideals of their youth, they have become boring.\n\nThe feelings of inadequacy that you create will give you space to insinuate yourself, to make them see you as the answer to their problems. Pain and anxiety are the proper precursors to pleasure. Learn to manufacture the need that you can fill.\n\nAlthough Lawrence had great success with his frontal approach, it is often better to stir thoughts of inadequacy and uncertainty indirectly, by hinting at comparisons to yourself or to others, and by insinuating somehow that your victimsâ lives are less grand than they had imagined. You want them to feel at war with themselves, torn in two directions, and anxious about it.\n\nKeys to Seduction\n\nAs a seducer, you must never mistake a personâs appearance for the reality. People are always susceptible to being seduced, because in fact everyone lacks a sense of completeness, feels something missing deep inside.\n\nRemember: most of us are lazy. To relieve our feelings of boredom or inadequacy on our own takes too much effort; letting someone else do the job is both easier and more exciting.\n\nIf they are stuck in a rut, make them feel it more deeply, âinnocentlyâ bringing it up and talking about it. What you want is a wound, an insecurity you can expand a little, an anxiety that can best be relieved by involvement with another person, namely you. They must feel the wound before they fall in love.\n\nLawrence made his targets feel personally inadequate; if you find it hard to be so brutal, concentrate on their friends, their circumstances, the externals of their lives.\n\nCorporations and politicians know that they cannot seduce their public into buying what they want them to buy, or doing what they want them to do, unless they first awaken a sense of need and discontent. Make the masses uncertain about their identity and you can help define it for them.\n\nIt is as true of groups or nations as it is of individuals: they cannot be seduced without being made to feel some lack.\n\nReversal\n\nCharm is often a subtler and more effective route to seduction.\n\nThis is a kind of diffused seduction, lacking in tension and in the deep emotions that the sexual variety stirs.\n\nBut if you are subtle and clever, it can be a way of lowering their defenses, creating an unthreatening friendship.\n\nOnce they are under your spell in this way, you can then open the wound.\n\nChapter 6 - Master the Art of Insinuation\n\nMaking your targets feel dissatisfied and in need of your attention is essential, but if you are too obvious, they will see through you and grow defensive. There is no known defense, however, against insinuationâthe art of planting ideas in peopleâs minds by dropping elusive hints that take root days later, even appearing to them as their own idea.\n\nInsinuation is the supreme means of influencing people. Create a sublanguageâbold statements followed by retraction and apology, ambiguous comments, banal talk combined with alluring glancesâthat enters the targetâs unconscious to convey your real meaning. Make everything suggestive.\n\nSlight physical contact insinuates desire, as does a fleeting but memorable look, or an unusually warm tone of voice, both for the briefest of moments. A passing comment suggests that something about the victim interests you; but keep it subtle, your words revealing a possibility, creating a doubt.\n\nKeys to Seduction\n\nRemember: to sow a seductive idea you must engage peopleâs imaginations, their fantasies, their deepest yearnings. What sets the wheels spinning is suggesting things that people already want to hearâthe possibility of pleasure, wealth, health, adventure. In the end, these good things turn out to be precisely what you seem to offer them.\n\nSlips of the tongue, apparently inadvertent âsleep on itâ comments, alluring references, statements for which you quickly apologizeâall of these have immense insinuating power.\n\nThe key to succeeding with your insinuations is to make them when your targets are at their most relaxed or distracted, so that they are not aware of what is happening.\n\nPolite banter is often the perfect front for this; people are thinking about what they will say next, or are absorbed in their own thoughts.\n\nHints, suggestions, and insinuations create a seductive atmosphere, signaling that their victim is no longer involved in the routines of daily life but has entered another realm.\n\nReversal\n\nThe danger in insinuation is that when you leave things ambiguous your target may misread them.\n\nThere are moments, particularly later on in a seduction, when it is best to communicate your idea directly, particularly once you know the target will welcome it.\n\nChapter 7 - Enter Their Spirit\n\nMost people are locked in their own worlds, making them stubborn and hard to persuade. The way to lure them out of their shell and set up your seduction is to enter their spirit. Play by their rules, enjoy what they enjoy, adapt yourself to their moods. In doing so you will stroke their deep-rooted narcissism and lower their defenses. Hypnotized by the mirror image you present, they will open up, becoming vulnerable to your subtle influence.\n\nSoon you can shift the dynamic: once you have entered their spirit you can make them enter yours, at a point when it is too late to turn back. Indulge your targetsâ every mood and whim, giving them nothing to react against or resist.\n\nOf all the seductive tactics, entering someoneâs spirit is perhaps the most devilish of all. It gives your victims the feeling that they are seducing you.\n\nKeys to Seduction\n\nOne of the great sources of frustration in our lives is other peopleâs stubbornness. How hard it is to reach them, to make them see things our way.\n\nParadoxically, the way to entice people out of this shell is to become more like them, in fact a kind of mirror image of them.\n\nWhen you are mirroring someone, do not stop at the person they have become; enter the spirit of that ideal person they wanted to be.\n\nReversal\n\nNever take mirroring too far, then. It is only useful in the first phase of a seduction; at some point the dynamic must be reversed.\n\nChapter 8 - Create Temptation\n\nLure the target deep into your seduction by creating the proper temptation: a glimpse of the pleasures to come.Â\n\nFind that weakness of theirs, that fantasy that has yet to be realized, and hint that you can lead them toward it. It could be wealth, it could be adventure, it could be forbidden and guilty pleasures; the key is to keep it vague.\n\nStimulate a curiosity stronger than the doubts and anxieties that go with it, and they will follow you.\n\nKeys to Seduction\n\nWhat people want is not temptation; temptation happens every day. What people want is to give into temptation, to yield.\n\nYour task, then, is to create a temptation that is stronger than the daily variety. It has to be focused on them, aimed at them as individualsâat their weakness.\n\nUnderstand: everyone has a principal weakness, from which others stem. Find that childhood insecurity, that lack in their life, and you hold the key to tempting them.\n\nTheir weakness may be greed, vanity, boredom, some deeply repressed desire, a hunger for forbidden fruit.\n\nTheir past, and particularly their past romances, will be littered with clues.\n\nMany such social barriers are gone today, so they have to be manufacturedâit is the only way to put spice into seduction.\n\nTaboos of any kind are a source of tension, and they are psychological now, not religious.\n\nSearch in their past; whatever they seem to fear or flee from might hold the key.\n\nReversal\n\nThe reverse of temptation is security or satisfaction, and both are fatal to seduction. If you cannot tempt someone out of their habitual comfort, you cannot seduce them.\n\nIf you satisfy the desire you have awakened, the seduction is over. There is no reversal to temptation.\n\nPhase Two - Lead Astray-Creating Pleasure & Confusion\n\nYour victims are sufficiently intrigued and their desire for you is growing, but their attachment is weak and at any moment they could decide to turn back.\n\nThe goal in this phase is to lead your victims so far astrayâkeeping them emotional and confused, giving them pleasure but making them want moreâthat retreat is no longer possible.\n\nSpringing on them a pleasant surprise will make them see you as delightfully unpredictable, but will also keep them off balance (9: Keep them in suspenseâwhat comes next?).\n\nThe artful use of soft and pleasant words will intoxicate them and stimulate fantasies (10: Use the demonic power of words to sow confusion).\n\nAesthetic touches and pleasant little rituals will titillate their senses, distract their minds (11: Pay attention to detail).\n\nYour greatest danger in this phase is the mere hint of routine or familiarity. You need to maintain some mystery, to keep a little distance so that in your absence your victims become obsessed with you (12: Poeticize your presence).\n\nThey may realize they are falling for you, but they must never suspect how much of this has come from your manipulations. A well-timed display of your weakness, of how emotional you have become under their influence will help cover your tracks (13: Disarm through strategic weakness and vulnerability).\n\nTo excite your victims and make them highly emotional, you must give them the feeling that they are actually living some of the fantasies you have stirred in their imagination (14: Confuse desire and reality).\n\nBy giving them only a part of the fantasy, you will keep them coming back for more. Focusing your attention on them so that the rest of the world fades away, even taking them on a trip, will lead them far astray (15: Isolate your victim). There is no turning back.\n\nChapter 9 - Keep Them in Suspense - What Comes Next?\n\nThe moment people feel they know what to expect from you, your spell on them is broken. More: you have ceded them power. The only way to lead the seduced along and keep the upper hand is to create suspense, a calculated surprise.\n\nGive the victim a thrill with a sudden change of direction.\n\nIn seduction, you need to create constant tension and suspense, a feeling that with you nothing is predictable. You are creating drama in real life, so pour your creative energies into it, have some fun.\n\nBut best of all are surprises that reveal something new about your character. This needs to be set up.\n\nKeys to Seduction\n\nAny sudden event has a similar effect, striking directly at our emotions before we get defensive.\n\nAppear somewhere unexpectedly, say or do something sudden, and people will not have time to figure out that your move was calculated.\n\nFinally, you might think it wiser to present yourself as someone reliable, not given to caprice. If so, you are in fact merely timid.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you prefer to improvise, imagining that any kind of planning or calculation is antithetical to the spirit of surprise, you are making a grave mistake.\n\nConstant improvisation simply means you are lazy, and thinking only about yourself.\n\nReversal\n\nSurprise can be unsurprising if you keep doing the same thing again and again.\n\nYou need to vary the method of your surprises.\n\nChapter 10 - Use the Demonic Power of Words to Sow Confusion\n\nIt is hard to make people listen; they are consumed with their own thoughts and desires, and have little time for yours. The trick to making them listen is to say what they want to hear, to fill their ears with whatever is pleasant to them. This is the essence of seductive language.\n\nInflame peopleâs emotions with loaded phrases, flatter them, comfort their insecurities, envelop them in fantasies, sweet words, and promises, and not only will they listen to you, they will lose their Will to resist you.\n\nKeep your language vague, letting them read into it what they want. Use writing to stir up fantasies and to create an idealized portrait of yourself.\n\nWhether you are talking to a single individual or to a crowd, try a little experiment: rein in your desire to speak your mind. Before you open your mouth, ask yourself a question: what can I say that will have the most pleasant effect on my listeners? Often this entails flattering their egos, assuaging their insecurities, giving them vague hopes for the future, sympathizing with their travails (âI have understood youâ).\n\nRemember: the tone of your letters is what will get under their skin. If your language is elevated, poetic, creative in its praise, it will infect them despite themselves. Never argue, never defend yourself, never accuse them of being heartless. That would ruin the spell.\n\nDo not waste time on real information; focus on feelings and sensations, using expressions that are ripe with connotation. Plant ideas by dropping hints, writing suggestively without explaining yourself.\n\nKeys to Seduction\n\nThe key to seductive language is not the words you utter, or your seductive tone of voice; it is a radical shift in perspective and habit.\n\nThe difference between normal language and seductive language is like the difference between noise and music.\n\nLearn to sniff out the parts of a personâs ego that need validation. Make it a surprise, something no one else has thought to flatter beforeâsomething you can describe as a talent or positive quality that others have not noticed. Speak with a little tremor, as if your targetâs charms had overwhelmed you and made you emotional.\n\nThe emotions you are trying to arouse should be strong ones. Do not speak of friendship and disagreement; speak of love and hate. And it is crucial to try to feel something of the emotions you are trying to elicit.\n\nSeductive language should have a kind of boldness, which will cover up a multitude of sins.\n\nNever say âI donât think the other side made a wise decisionâ; say âWe deserve better,â or âThey have made a mess of things.â Affirmative language is active language, full of verbs, imperatives, and short sentences. Cut out âI believe,â âPerhaps,â âIn my opinion.â Head straight for the heart.\n\nYour words do not stand for anything real; their sound, and the feelings they evoke, are more important than what they are supposed to stand for.\n\nReversal\n\nDo not confuse flowery language with seduction: in using flowery language you run the risk of wearing on peopleâs nerves, of seeming pretentious.\n\nCurb your tongueâuse silence to cultivate an enigmatic presence.\n\nFinally, seduction has a pace and rhythm. In phase one, you are cautious and indirect. It is often best to disguise your intentions, to put your target at ease with deliberately neutral words. Your conversation should be harmless, even a bit bland.\n\nIn this second phase, you turn more to the attack; this is the time for seductive language. Now when you envelop them in your seductive words and letters, it comes as a pleasant surprise.\n\nChapter 11 - Pay Attention to Detail\n\nLofty words and grand gestures can be suspicious: why are you trying so hard to please? The details of a seductionâthe subtle gestures, the offhand things you doâ are often more charming and revealing.\n\nYou must learn to distract your victims with a myriad of pleasant little ritualsâthoughtful gifts tailored just for them, clothes and adornments designed to please them, gestures that show the time and attention you are paying them. All of their senses are engaged in the details you orchestrate.\n\nCreate spectacles to dazzle their eyes; mesmerized by what they see, they will not notice what you are really up to. Learn to suggest the proper feelings and moods through details.\n\nKeys to Seduction\n\nRemember: the more you get people to focus on the little things, the less they will notice your larger direction. The seduction will assume the slow, hypnotic pace of a ritual, in which the details have a heightened importance and the moments are full of ceremony.\n\nBut what is most seductive in the long run is what you do not say, what you communicate indirectly.\n\nThe gesture, the thoughtful gift, the little details seem much more real and substantial.\n\nChapter 12 - Poeticize Your Presence\n\nImportant things happen when your targets are alone: the slightest feeling of relief that you are not there, and it is all over. Familiarity and overexposure will cause this reaction.\n\nRemain elusive, then, so that when you are away, they will yearn to see you again, and will associate you only with pleasant thoughts.\n\nOccupy their minds by alternating an exciting presence with a cool distance, exuberant moments followed by calculated absences. Associate yourself with poetic images and objects, so that when they think of you, they begin to see you through an idealized halo.\n\nAt all costs, you must embody something, even if it is roguery and evil. Anything to avoid the taint of familiarity and commonness.\n\nKeys to Seduction\n\nThis makes the seducerâs task easy: people are dying to be given the chance to fantasize about you\n\nSoon after we fall under a personâs spell, we form an image in our minds of who they are and what pleasures they might offer.\n\nThe first happens when we first meet the person. The second and more important one happens later, when a bit of doubt creeps inâyou desire the other person, but they elude you, you are not sure they are yours\n\nRemember: if you are easily had, you cannot be worth that much. It is hard to wax poetic about a person who comes so cheaply. If, after the initial interest, you make it clear that you cannot be taken for granted, if you stir a bit of doubt, the target will imagine there is something special, lofty, and unattainable about you. Your image will crystallize in the other personâs mind\n\nAlthough it is said that absence makes the heart grow fonder, an absence too early will prove deadly to the crystallization process\n\nDo everything you can to keep the target thinking about you. Letters, mementos, gifts, unexpected meetingsâall these give you an omnipresence. Everything must remind them of you\n\nReversal\n\nThe only thing that cannot be idealized is mediocrity, but there is nothing seductive about mediocrity\n\nChapter 13 - Disarm Through Strategic Weakness & Vulnerability\n\nToo much maneuvering on your part may raise suspicion. The best way to cover your tracks is to make the other person feel superior and stronger.\n\nIf you seem to be weak, vulnerable, enthralled by the other person, and unable to control yourself, you will make your actions look more natural, less calculated.\n\nTo further win trust, exchange honesty for virtue: establish your âsincerityâ by confessing some sin on your partâit doesnât have to be real. Sincerity is more important than goodness. Play the victim, then transform your targetâs sympathy into love.\n\nKeys to Seduction\n\nRemember: what is natural to your character is inherently seductive. A personâs vulnerability, what they seem to be unable to control, is often what is most seductive about them. People who display no weaknesses, on the other hand, often elicit envy, fear, and angerâwe want to sabotage them just to bring them down.\n\nDo not struggle against your vulnerabilities, or try to repress them, but put them into play. Learn to transform them into power. The game is subtle: if you wallow in your weakness, overplay your hand, you will be seen as angling for sympathy, or, worse, as pathetic.\n\nNo, what works best is to allow people an occasional glimpse into the soft, frail side of your character, and usually only after they have known you for a while. That glimpse will humanize you, lowering their suspicions, and preparing the ground for a deeper attachment. Normally strong and in control, at moments you let go, give in to your weakness, let them see it.\n\nMale seducers long ago learned to become more feminineâto show their emotions, and to seem interested in their targetsâ lives.\n\nThe key is to indulge your softer side while still remaining as masculine as possible.\n\nRemember, though, to keep everything in moderation. A glimpse of shyness is sufficient; too much of it and the target will despair, afraid that she will end up having to do all the work.\n\nIn social and political situations, seeming too ambitious, or too controlled, will make people fear you; it is crucial to show your soft side. The display of a single weakness will hide a multitude of manipulations.\n\nReversal\n\nTiming is everything in seduction; you should always look for signs that the target is falling under your spell. A person falling in love tends to ignore the other personâs weaknesses, or to see them as endearing.\n\nThe only weaknesses worth playing up are the ones that will make you seem lovable. All others should be repressed and eradicated at all costs.\n\nChapter 14 - Confuse Desire and Reality - The Perfect Illusion\n\nTo compensate for the difficulties in their lives, people spend a lot of their time daydreaming, imagining a future full of adventure, success, and romance. If you can create the illusion that through you they can live out their dreams, you will have them at your mercy.\n\nIt is important to start slowly, gaining their trust, and gradually constructing the fantasy that matches their desires. Aim at secret wishes that have been thwarted or repressed, stirring up uncontrollable emotions, clouding their powers of reason. The perfect illusion is one that does not depart too much from reality, but has a touch of the unreal to it, like a waking dream. Lead the seduced to a point of confusion in which they can no longer tell the difference between illusion and reality.\n\nRemember: people want to believe in the extraordinary; with a little groundwork, a little mental foreplay, they will fall for your illusion. If anything, err on the side of reality: use real props (like the child Pei Pu showed Bouriscout) and add the fantastical touches in your words, or an occasional gesture that gives you a slight unreality.\n\nWhen our emotions are engaged, we often have trouble seeing things as they are.\n\nKeys to Seduction\n\nThe real world can be unforgiving: events occur over which we have little control, other people ignore our feelings in their quests to get what they need, time runs out before we accomplish what we had wanted.\n\nYour task as a seducer is to bring some flesh and blood into someoneâs fantasy life by embodying a fantasy figure, or creating a scenario resembling that personâs dreams.\n\nYou must first choose targets who have some repression or dream unrealizedâalways the most likely victims of a seduction.\n\nInstead create the appearance of normality. Once your targets feel secureânothing is out of the ordinaryâyou have room to deceive them.\n\nIn animating a fantasy, the great mistake is imagining it must be larger than life.\n\nIndulge your targets in this wish by first making it clear that you are playing a role, then inviting them to join you in a shared fantasy.\n\nThe idea that we can get something back, that a mistake can be righted, is immensely seductive.\n\nReversal\n\nThere is no reversal to this chapter. No seduction can proceed without creating illusion, the sense of a world that is real but separate from reality.\n\nChapter 15 - Isolate the Victim\n\nAn isolated person is weak. By slowly isolating your victims, you make them more vulnerable to your influence.\n\nTheir isolation may be psychological: by filling their field of vision through the pleasurable attention you pay them, you crowd out everything else in their mind. They see and think only of you.\n\nThe isolation may also be physical: you take them away from their normal milieu, friends, family, home.\n\nLure the seduced into your lair, where nothing is familiar.\n\nDo not give your targets the time or space to worry about, suspect, or resist you. Flood them with the kind of attention that crowds out all other thoughts, concerns, and problems. Rememberâpeople secretly yearn to be led astray by someone who knows where they are going. It can be a pleasure to let go, and even to feel isolated and weak, if the seduction is done slowly and gracefully.\n\nKeys to Seduction\n\nA target who is strong and settled is hard to seduce. But even the strongest people can be made vulnerable if you can isolate them from their nests and safety nets. Block out their friends and family with your constant presence, alienate them from the world they are used to, and take them to places they do not know.\n\nGet them to spend time in your environment. Deliberately disturb their habits, get them to do things they have never done. They will grow emotional, making it easier to lead them astray. Disguise all this in the form of a pleasurable experience, and your targets will wake up one day distanced from everything that normally comforts them. Then they will turn to you for help, like a child crying out for its mother when the lights are turned out.\n\nYour worst enemies in a seduction are often your targetsâ family and friends. They are outside your circle and immune to your charms; they may provide a voice of reason to the seduced. You must work silently and subtly to alienate the target from them. Insinuate that they are jealous of your targetâs good fortune in finding you, or that they are parental figures who have lost a taste for adventure. The latter argument is extremely effective with young people, whose identities are in flux and who are more than ready to rebel against any authority figure, particularly their parents. You represent excitement and life; the friends and parents represent habit and boredom.\n\nThe principle of isolation can be taken literally by whisking the target off to an exotic locale.\n\nFinally, at some point in the seduction there must be a hint of danger in the mix. Your targets should feel that they are gaining a great adventure in following you, but are also losing somethingâa part of their past, their cherished comfort.\n\nActively encourage these ambivalent feelings. An element of fear is the proper spice; although too much fear is debilitating, in small doses it makes us feel alive.\n\nReversal\n\nThe risks of this strategy are simple: isolate someone too quickly and you will induce a sense of panic that may end up in the targetâs taking flight.\n\nPhase 3 - The Precipice - Deepening the Effect Through Extreme Measures\n\nThe goal in this phase is to make everything deeperâthe effect you have on their mind, feelings of love and attachment, tension within your victims. With your hooks deep into them, you can then push them back and forth, between hope and despair, until they weaken and snap.\n\nShowing how far you are willing to go for your victims, doing some noble or chivalrous deed (16: Prove yourself) will create a powerful jolt, spark an intensely positive reaction.\n\nEveryone has scars, repressed desires, and unfinished business from childhood. Bring these desires and wounds to the surface, make your victims feel they are getting what they never got as a child and you will penetrate deep into their psyche, stir uncontrollable emotions (17: Effect a regression).\n\nNow you can take your victims past their limits, getting them to act out their dark sides, adding a sense of danger to your seduction (18: Stir up the transgressive and taboo).\n\nYou need to deepen the spell, and nothing will more confuse and enchant your victims than giving your seduction a spiritual veneer.\n\nIt is not lust that motivates you, but destiny, divine thoughts and everything elevated (19: Use spiritual lures).\n\nThe erotic lurks beneath the spiritual. Now your victims have been properly set up. By deliberately hurting them, instilling fears and anxieties, you will lead them to the edge of the precipice from which it will be easy to push and make them fall (20: Mix pleasure with pain). They feel great tension and are yearning for relief.\n\nChapter 16 - Prove Yourself\n\nMost people want to be seduced. If they resist your efforts, it is probably because you have not gone far enough to allay their doubtsâabout your motives, the depth of your feelings, and so on. One well-timed action that shows how far you are willing to go to win them over will dispel their doubts.\n\nDo not worry about looking foolish or making a mistakeâany kind of deed that is self-sacrificing and for your targetsâ sake will so overwhelm their emotions, they wonât notice anything else. Never appear discouraged by peopleâs resistance, or complain. Instead, meet the challenge by doing something extreme or chivalrous.\n\nConversely, spur others to prove themselves by making yourself hard to reach, unattainable, worth fighting over.\n\nMore often than not, you give up too easily.\n\nFirst, understand a primary law of seduction: resistance is a sign that the other personâs emotions are engaged in the process. The only person you cannot seduce is somebody distant and cold.\n\nThere are two ways to prove yourself.\n\nFirst, the spontaneous action: a situation arises in which the target needs help, a problem needs solving, or, simply, he or she needs a favor. You cannot foresee these situations, but you must be ready for them, for they can spring up at any time. Impress the target by going further than really necessaryâsacrificing more money, more time, more effort than they had expected.\n\nThe second way to prove yourself is the brave deed that you plan and execute in advance, on your own and at the right momentâpreferably some way into the seduction, when any doubts the victim still has about you are more dangerous than earlier on.\n\nChoose a dramatic, difficult action that reveals the painful time and effort involved. Danger can be extremely seductive. Cleverly lead your victim into a crisis, a moment of danger, or indirectly put them in an uncomfortable position, and you can play the rescuer, the gallant knight. The powerful feelings and emotions this elicits can easily be redirected into love.\n\nWhen dealing with difficult or resistant targets, it is usually best to improvise.\n\nIf your action seems sudden and a surprise, it will make them more emotional, loosen them up. A little roundabout accumulation of informationâa little spyingâis always a good idea.\n\nMost important is the spirit in which you enact your proof. If you are lighthearted and playful, if you make the target laugh, proving yourself and amusing them at the same time, it wonât matter if you mess up, or if they see you have employed a little trickery.\n\nMaking your deed as dashing and chivalrous as possible will elevate the seduction to a new level, stir up deep emotions, and conceal any ulterior motives you may have. The sacrifices you are making must be visible; talking about them, or explaining what they have cost you, will seem like bragging.\n\nLose sleep, fall ill, lose valuable time, put your career on the line, spend more money than you can afford. You can exaggerate all this for effect, but donât get caught boasting about it or feeling sorry for yourself: cause yourself pain and let them see it. Since almost everyone else in the world seems to have an angle, your noble and selfless deed will be irresistible.\n\nThe appeal of seduction is that of being separated from our normal routines, experiencing the thrill of the unknown.\n\nShow that you have a reckless streak and a daring nature, that you lack the usual fear of death, and you are instantly fascinating to the bulk of humanity.\n\nRemember: not only what you do matters, but how you do it. If you are naturally self-absorbed, learn to disguise it. React as spontaneously as possible, exaggerating the effect by seeming flustered, overexcited, even foolishâlove has driven you to that point.\n\nMake people compete for your attention, make them prove themselves in some way, and you will find them rising to the challenge. The heat of seduction is raised by such challengesâshow me that you really love me.\n\nWhen one person (of either sex) rises to the occasion, often the other person is now expected to do the same, and the seduction heightens.\n\nReversal\n\nWhen trying to prove that you are worthy of your target, remember that every target sees things differently; A show of physical prowess will not impress someone who does not value physical prowess; it will just show that you are after attention, flaunting yourself.\n\nSeducers must adapt their way of proving themselves to the doubts and weaknesses of the seduced.\n\nChapter 17 - Effect a Regression\n\nPeople who have experienced a certain kind of pleasure in the past will try to repeat or relive it.\n\nThe deepest-rooted and most pleasurable memories are usually those from earliest childhood, and are often unconsciously associated with a parental figure.\n\nBring your targets back to that point by placing yourself in the oedipal triangle and positioning them as the needy child. Unaware of the cause of their emotional response, they will fall in love with you.\n\nAlternatively, you too can regress, letting them play the role of the protecting, nursing parent.\n\nIn either case you are offering the ultimate fantasy: the chance to have an intimate relationship with mommy or daddy, son or daughter.\n\nTo practice it in real life, you need to play the therapist, encouraging people to talk about their childhood. Most of us are only too happy to oblige; and our memories are so vivid and emotional that a part of us regresses just in talking about our early years.\n\nBut pay attention to their tone of voice, to any nervous tics as they talk, and particularly to anything they do not want to talk about, anything they deny or that makes them emotional\n\nMany statements actually mean their opposite: should they say they hated their father, for instance, you can be sure that they are hiding a lot of disappointmentâthat they actually loved their father only too much, and perhaps never quite got what they wanted from him.\n\nListen closely for recurring themes and stories. Most important, learn to analyze emotional responses and see what lies behind them.\n\nWhile they talk, maintain the therapistâs poseâattentive but quiet, making occasional, nonjudgmental comments. Be caring yet distantâsomewhat blank, in factâand they will begin to transfer emotions and project fantasies onto you.\n\nThe key is not just to talk about memoriesâthat is weak. What you want is to get people to act out in their present old issues from their past, without their being aware of what is happening. The regressions you can effect fall into four main types\n\nThe Infantile Regression. The first bondâthe bond between a mother and her infantâis the most powerful one.\n\nNever judge your targetsâlet them do whatever they want, including behaving badly; at the same time surround them with loving attention, smother them with comfort.\n\nMeanwhile, create atmospheres that reinforce the feeling you are generatingâwarm environments, playful activities, bright, happy colors.\n\nThe Oedipal Regression. After the bond between mother and child comes the oedipal triangle of mother, father, and child.\n\nPlay a parental role, be loving, but also sometimes scold and instill some discipline. Children actually love a little disciplineâit makes them feel that the adult cares about them.\n\nDo not go ahead with the regression until you have learned everything you can about their childhoodâwhat they had too much of, what they lacked, and so on.\n\nThe Ego Ideal Regression. As children, we often form an ideal figure out of our dreams and ambitions. First, that ideal figure is the person we want to be. We imagine ourselves as brave adventurers, romantic figures. Then, in our adolescence, we turn our attention to others, often projecting our ideals onto them.\n\nTo create this effect, strive to reproduce the intense, innocent mood of a youthful infatuation.\n\nThe Reverse Parental Regression. Here you are the one to regress: you deliberately play the role of the cute, adorable, yet also sexually charged child. Older people always find younger people incredibly seductive.\n\nKeep in mind that certain types are more vulnerable to an oedipal regression. Look for those who, like Professor Mut, seem outwardly the most adultâstraitlaced, serious, a little full of themselves.\n\nIt is nearly impossible to embody someoneâs ideal completely. But if you come close enough, if you evoke some of that ideal spirit, you can lead that person into a deep seduction.\n\nTo effect this regression you must play the role of the therapist. Get your targets to open up about their past, particularly their former loves and most particularly their first love. Pay attention to any expressions of disappointment, how this or that person did not give them what they wanted. Take them to places that evoke their youth. In this regression you are creating not so much a relationship of dependency and immaturity but rather the adolescent spirit of a first love.\n\nRemember: most of us remember our early years fondly, but often, paradoxically, the people with the strongest attachment to those times are the ones who had the most difficult childhoods.\n\nReversal\n\nTo reverse the strategies of regression, the parties to a seduction would have to remain adults during the process. This is not only rare, it is not very pleasurable.\n\nChapter 18 - Stir Up the Transgressive & Taboo\n\nThere are always social limits on what one can do. Some of these, the most elemental taboos, go back centuries; others are more superficial, simply defining polite and acceptable behavior.\n\nMaking your targets feel that you are leading them past either kind of limit is immensely seductive.\n\nPeople yearn to explore their dark side.\n\nNot everything in romantic love is supposed to be tender and soft; hint that you have a cruel, even sadistic streak.
