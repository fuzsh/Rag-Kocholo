        "text": "Roy is a common surname in France, so it is no wonder that a number of them came to greater Acadia during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. But a descendant of only one of them emigrated to Louisiana:\n\nJean Roy, born at Aleurat, France, in c1647, came to Plaisance, Newfoundland, part of greater Acadia, in the early 1670s to work for Thomas Tompique. Nothing more is known of Jean.\n\n~\n\nAccording to Bona Arsenault, Sébastien, son of Jacques Roy and Barbe Raymond of St.-Joseph de Montmédy, Meuse, Lorraine, born in c1690, married Marie, daughter of coastal pilot Nicolas Coste and Madeleine Martin dit Barnabé, at Annapolis Royal in February 1714. Arsenault says Sébastien died in c1722, no place given, and that his widow remarried to Pierre Boy in c1724. Acadian genealogist Stephen White calls Sébastien Le Roy dit L'Espérance, calls Marie's second husband Pierre Bois, and says they married at Port-Toulouse, Île Royale, in c1718, so Sébastien must have died soon after he married Marie Coste. Evidently no children came of the union.\n\n~\n\nA much younger Jean, son of merchant Edmé-Michel Roy of St.-Nicolas-de-la-Grave, Lectoure, France, born in c1702, also came to greater Acadia and married Marie, daughter of Jacques Blemé and Élisabeth Collin of Plémont, France, at Port-La-Joye, Île St.-Jean, today's Prince Edward Island, in July 1721. If they had any children, it was not recorded.\n\n~\n\nGabriel-Baptiste Roy, born at St.-Roch, Québec, in c1725, died at Port-La-Joye in November 1750. He probably died before he could marry and start a family of his own.\n\n~\n\nIn April 1752, Charles Le Roy, ploughman, native of Paris, age 52, was living at Baie-des-Espagnols on Île Royale, today's Cape Breton Island, with his wife Marie Chauvet, \"native of La Cadie,\" also age 52, and seven children: Marguerite, age 24; Alexandre, age 22; Charles, age 18; Anne, age 16; Martine, age 14; Alexis, age 10; and Osite, age 7. Also living with them was Charles's son-in-law, Jean Fournier, age 33, a fisherman and native of Québec, and his wife Geneviève Le Roy, age 26, \"a native of La Cadie.\" Nearby were son Pierre Le Roy, age 28; and his wife Marie Lejeune, age 24; as well as son-in-law Charles Lejeune, age 2; and his wife Marie Le Roy, age 20. No member of this family emigrated to Louisiana.\n\n~\n\nThe progenitor of the Acadian Roys who ended up in Louisiana was Jean Le Roy or Roy dit La Liberté, born at St.-Malo, France, in c1651, probably no kin to the other Roys and Le Roys of Acadia. Jean dit La Liberté, also called Jean dit Le Naigre, married Marie-Christine called Christine, Aubois, also called Hautbois and Dubois, a 21-year-old mixed-blood Mi'kmaq, or Métis, in c1686 likely at Cap-Sable. Between 1686 and 1708, they had nine children, five daughters and four sons. Four of their daughters married into the Clémenceau, Comeau dit Grandjean, Girouard, Fontaine dit Beaulieu, and Trahan families. La Liberté and Christine's four sons also created families of their own:\n\nOldest son Jean, fils, born in c1691, married first to Jeanne, daughter of Pierre Lejeune and Marie Thibodeau, at Grand-Pré in October 1712. They had five children, including a son who married a Lejeune cousin at Port-Orléans on Île Royale. Jean, fils remarried to Françoise, daughter of Martin Corporon and Marie-Josèphe Viger, in c1743, in his early 50s. Francoise gave him nine more children, including a son who married into the Minet family in Canada long after Le Grand Dérangement. Jean, fils died at Champlain on the upper St. Lawrence between Québec City and Trois-Rivières in April 1770, age 79.\n\nFrançois, born in c1692, married Marie, daughter of Barthélémy Bergeron dit d'Amboise and Geneviève Serreau de Saint-Aubin, at Annapolis Royal in January 1717. Their son Abraham, born at Annapolis Royal in c1731, married cousin Anne Aubois at Annapolis Royal probably on the eve of Le Grand Dérangement and emigrated to Louisiana from Halifax in 1765.\n\nPhilippe, born in c1696, married Cécile, daughter of Louis Mazerolle dit Saint-Louis and Geneviève Forest, at Grand-Pré in August 1718. Philippe may have participated in the Acadian resistance against British rule during King George's War. He died in 1763 while in exile.\n\nYoungest son René dit Renaud dit Potvin, born in August 1708, married Marie-Josèphe, daughter of Joseph Daigre and Madeleine Gautrot, probably at Annapolis Royal in c1743. He moved to Île St.-Jean by the early 1750s, where one of his daughters was born. He died at St.-François-du-Sud below Québec City in January 1758, perhaps of smallpox, during exile.\n\n[For more of this family in pre- and post-dispersal Acadia and Canada, see Book Three]\n\nIn 1755, descendants of Jean Roy dit La Liberté could be found at Annapolis Royal, Grand-Pré and Pigiguit in the Minas Basin, and on Île St.-Jean.\n\nLE GRAND DÉRANGEMENT\n\n[For the family's travails during the Great Upheaval, see Book Six]\n\nLOUISIANA: RIVER SETTLEMENTS\n\nThree descendants of Jean Roy dit La Liberté of St.-Malo and Port-Royal were among the earliest Acadians who found refuge in Louisiana:\n\nAbraham Roy of Annapolis Royal, age 34, a widower, and two of his children--daughter Marie, age 10; and son Sauveur, sometimes called Salvador, age 6--came to Louisiana from Halifax via French St.-Domingue, in February 1765 with the Broussard party:\n\nDescendants of Abraham ROY (1731-?; Jean dit La Liberté)\n\nAbraham, son of François Roy and Marie Bergeron, born at Annapolis Royal in c1731, married Anne Aubois probably on the eve of Le Grand Dérangement. With an infant daughter, they escaped the British roundup in Nova Scotia in 1755 and fled to the Gulf of St. Lawrence shore, where a son was born in c1759. They ended up as prisoners at Halifax in the early 1760s. Anne had died by then, so Abraham was a widower when he came to Louisiana. He was one of the Halifax Acadians who exchanged Canadian card money for Louisiana funds at New Orleans in late April 1765. He and his children followed the Broussards to the Attakapas District, where they helped create La Nouvelle-Acadie on the banks of Bayou Teche, but the place did not suit them. That summer and fall, a mysterious epidemic struck down dozens of their fellow Teche valley Acadians. Abraham and his children were among the Acadians who fled to Cabanocé/St.-Jacques on the river to escape the epidemic. They remained at St.-Jacques for two generations. Daughter Marie married a Sonnier at St.-Jacques in May 1773. Meanwhile, Abraham, in his late 30s, remarried to Marie-Madeleine, called Madeleine, daughter of fellow Acadians Germain Doucet and his first wife Françoise Comeau and widow of Pierre Gaudet, at Cabanocé in June 1768. Madeleine gave him another son. Abraham's sons settled at St.-Jacques, but their descendants did not remain there. Three of Abraham's grandsons and two of his great-grandsons left the river during the early antebellum period and settled in the old Attakapas District, west of the Atchafalaya Basin. By the 1830s, no Acadian Roys remained on the river.\n\n1\n\nOlder son Sauveur, sometimes called Salvador, from first wife Anne Aubois, born in c1759 during exile, followed his widowered father into a prison compound at Halifax and to Louisiana. He married Marie, daughter of André Bourgeois, a Créole, not an Acadian, and Marie Jacobine of St.-Charles des Allemands on the Lower German Coast, at St.-Jacques in May 1780. Their son Joseph le jeune was born at St.-Jacques in September 1786, Charles in March 1788, François in February 1792, Jean-Abraham in October 1796, and Pierre-Zéphirin in February 1803. Their daughters married into the Lavigne and Rousseau families. Sauveur died at St.-Jacques in November 1803, age 45. Two of his sons and two of his grandsons settled on Bayou Teche.\n\n1a\n\nJoseph le jeune married Marie Ursule, also called Françoise Ursule and Ursule Paula, daughter of fellow Acadian Paul David and his first wife Creole Marie Pélagie Oubre at St. James on the river in June 1806. Their son Joseph Sylvère was born in St. James Parish in January 1815, and Pierre Valéry, called Valéry, in June 1820. Joseph Sylvère and Pierre Valéry followed their uncle François to the western prairies.\n\n1b\n\nFrançois, probably after he came of age, moved to the Bayou Teche valley, where he married Françoise dite Séraphine, daughter of fellow Acadians Joseph Richard and Pélagie Babin of L'Anse, at the St. Martinville church, St. Martin Parish, in May 1813. They settled at La Pointe on upper Bayou Teche in St. Martin Parish, creating a western branch of the family.\n\n1c\n\nPierre Zéphirin followed his older brother to Bayou Teche and married fellow Acadian Marie Eurasie Richard, place unrecorded, probably in the late 1820s. They settled at Île-aux-Cypres, St. Martin Parish, near present-day Breaux Bridge.\n\n2\n\nYounger son Joseph, by his second wife, born at St.-Jacques in c1770, married Marguerite, daughter of André-Antoine Bernard of Nantes, a French immigrant, not an Acadian, and Anne-Françoise Sigur of France, at St.-Jean-Baptiste on the Upper German Coast in January 1794. Their son Charles-Abraham was born at St.-Jacques in April 1795, and Charles-Alexandre in January 1797 but died the following December. Joseph died at St.-Jacques in May 1799, age 30.\n\nCharles Abraham married Marie, 16-year-old daughter of fellow Acadians Pierre Theriot and Anastasie Michel, at the Convent church, St. James Parish, in January 1820. They, too, crossed the Atchafalaya Basin and settled on the western prairies.\n\nLOUISIANA: WESTERN SETTLEMENTS\n\nBeginning in the 1810s, three grandsons and two great-grandsons of Abraham Roy \"returned\" to the western prairies. By the 1830s, all of Abraham's descendants lived west of the Atchafalaya Basin. \"Today,\" according to a recent student of French and Spanish families in Louisiana, this St. Martin-Lafayette Acadian branch of the Roys is \"one of the main centers of the clan.\"\n\nDescendants of François ROY (1792-?; Jean dit La Liberté, François, Abraham)\n\nFrançois, third son of Sauveur Roy and Marie Bourgeois, born at St.-Jacques on the river in February 1792, married Françoise dite Séraphine, daughter of fellow Acadians Joseph Richard and Pélagie Babin of L'Anse, at the St. Martinville church, St. Martin Parish, in May 1813. They settled at L'Anse, perhaps L'Anse la Butte on the upper Vermilion between present-day Breaux Bridge and Lafayette, and at nearby La Pointe on upper Bayou Teche. Some of their descendants drifted west into Lafayette Parish by the 1830s. Their daughters married into the Menard and Pavie families.\n\n1\n\nOldest son François Achilles, called Achille, born in January 1817, married Marie Marcellite, daughter of fellow Acadian Pierre Trahan and his Creole wife Ursule Boulet, at the Vermilionville church, Lafayette Parish, in July 1838. Their son François, fils, perhaps also called Lasty, was born in Lafayette Parish in June 1843. Their daughter married a Trahan cousin. François Achilles's succession was filed in the Vermilionville courthouse in August 1846; he would have been age 29 that year.\n\nFrançois, fils/Lasty married Elmire, daughter of fellow Acadians Ursin J. Broussard and Euphémie Comeaux, at the Youngsville church, Lafayette Parish, in October 1865. Their son Léon was born in Lafayette Parish in October 1867, and Dema, perhaps a son, in April 1870.\n\n2\n\nAntoine Zéphirin, born at La Pointe in March 1819, married Marie Delphine, daughter of Éloi Picard and Céleste Doré, at the St. Martinville church, St. Martin Parish, in April 1839. Their son Antoine Jules was born in St. Martin Parish in September 1842.\n\n3\n\nYoungest son Pierre Zéphirin le jeune, also called Pierre William, Pierre Aurelien, Arvillien, and Charles, born in June 1825, married Arthémise Michelle, 17-year-old daughter of fellow Acadians Michel Richard and Arthémise Granger, at the Vermilionville church, Lafayette Parish, in January 1846. Their son Charles was born in Lafayette Parish in January 1849. Pierre Aurelien's succession was filed at the Vermilionville courthouse in March 1856; he would have been age 31 that year.\n\nDescendants of Pierre-Zéphirin ROY (1803-1853; Jean dit La Liberté, François, Abraham)\n\nPierre-Zéphirin, fifth and youngest son of Sauveur Roy and Marie Bourgeois, born at St.-Jacques on the river in February 1803, followed his older brother to St. Martin Parish, where he married fellow Acadian Marie Eurasie, called Eurasie, Richard, probably in the late 1820s. They settled at Île-aux-Cypres or Cypress Island, now Lake Martin, St. Martin Parish, south of present-day Breaux Bridge. Pierre, père died in St. Martin Parish in September 1853, age 50.\n\n1\n\nOldest son Aurelien, born probably at Île-aux-Cypres in March 1829, died at his parents' home at age 17 months in August 1830.\n\n2\n\nAmand Lasty was born probably at Île-aux-Cypres, St. Martin Parish, in January 1833. He may have been the Lastie Roy who married Marie Aspasie, called Aspasie, daughter of fellow Acadians Marin Blanchard and his second wife Annette dite Nanon Broussard and widow of Jean Baptiste LeGrand, in St. Martin Parish in c1870. If so, he died by 1880.\n\n3\n\nYoungest son Pierre, fils, born probably at Île-aux-Cypres in the mid-1830s, married Uranie, daughter of Joseph Hanes and Carmézile Bertrand, at the St. Martinville church in January 1855. Their son Louis Charles was born in St. Martin Parish in January 1859.\n\nDescendants of Charles-Abraham ROY (1795-c1847; Jean dit La Liberté, François, Abraham)\n\nCharles-Abraham, older son of Joseph Roy and Marguerite Bernard and first cousin of François and Pierre-Zéphirin Roy, was born at St.-Jacques on the river in April 1795. He married Marie, 16-year-old daughter of fellow Acadians Pierre Theriot and Anastasie Michel, at the Convent church, St. James Parish, in January 1820 and followed his cousins across the Atchafalaya to the old Attakapas country, where he settled in present-day Lafayette Parish. Their daughters married into the Langlinais and Lasalle families. Charles's succession was filed at the Vermilionville courthouse in November 1847; he would have been age 52 that year. In August 1850, the federal census taker in Lafayette Parish counted 24 slaves--13 males and 9 females, all black, ranging in age from 40 years to 6 months--on Widow Charles Roy's plantation next to Olivier Blanchet in the parish's western district; these were Marie Theriot's slaves, and Olivier was her oldest son's father-in-law.\n\n1\n\nOldest son Désiré, born probably in Lafayette Parish in c1826, married Ursule, 18-year-old daughter of Olivier Firmin Blanchet and his Acadian wife Carmélite Boudreaux, at the Vermilionville church, Lafayette Parish, in April 1846. Their son Gérard was born near Abbeville, Vermilion Parish, in October 1853 but died at age 7 months in July 1854, Désiré Honoré was born in May 1856, and Charles Kossuth near Youngsville, Lafayette Parish, in November 1859. Their daughters married into the Theriot and Young (probably Anglo American, not Acadian) families. In August 1850, the federal census taker in Lafayette Parish counted 3 slaves--a 20-year-old female, a 15-year-old male, and a 5-year-old male, all black--on Désiré Roy's farm next to Olivier Blanchet, fils, near Olivier Blanchet, père, and near his widowed mother in the parish's western district. In July 1860, the federal census taker in Lafayette Parish counted 36 slaves--20 males and 16 females, all black except for 2 mulattoes, ages 50 years to 7 months, living in 3 houses--on Désiré Roy's plantation. During the War of 1861-65, Désiré, with his younger brother Pierre Bienvenu, served as a sergeant in Company A of the 8th Regiment Louisiana Cavalry, raised in Rapides Parish, which fought in Louisiana. Désiré's succession, calling his wife Ursule Blanchard[sic], was filed at the Vermilionville courthouse in December 1869; he would have been in his early 40s that year.\n\n2\n\nJoseph was born in Lafayette Parish in September 1836.\n\n3\n\nYoungest son Pierre Bienvenu, called Bienvenu, P. Bienvenu, and P. B., born probably in Lafayette Parish in the late 1830s, married Louise, daughter of Aurelien St. Julien and his Acadian wife Marie Joséphine Broussard, at the Youngsville church, Lafayette Parish, in November 1860. They settled near Youngsville. Their son Arthur was born in October 1862. During the War of 1861-65, Pierre Bienvenu, with his older brother Désiré, served as a sergeant in Company A of the 8th Regiment Louisiana Cavalry. After the war, Pierre Bienvenu \"became one of the richest and most prominent planters and merchants of the area, with a total land holding of 3,825 acres in Lafayette, St. Martin, and Vermilion parishes.\"\n\nDescendants of Joseph Sylvère ROY (1815-; Jean dit La Liberté, François, Abraham, Sauveur)\n\nJoseph Sylvère, elder son of Joseph Roy le jeune and Marie Ursule David, grandson of Sauveur, and older brother of Pierre Valéry, was born in St. James Parish in January 1815. When Joseph Sylvère came of age, he followed his kinsmen to the western prairies, where he married Marie Rose, 20-year-old daughter of fellow Acadians Olivier Trahan and Rosalie Vincent, at the Vermilionville church, Lafayette Parish, in September 1843. They settled in Lafayette Parish. Their daughter may have married into the Lormand family.\n\n1\n\nOldest son Joseph, fils, was born in Lafayette Parish April 1842.\n\n2\n\nSevènne was born in Lafayette Parish in July 1843. During the War of 1861-65, Sevenne served in Company E of the 26th Regiment Louisiana Infantry, raised in Lafayette Parish, which fought at Vicksburg, Mississippi. He married Oliva Lormand in a civil ceremony in Lafayette Parish in May 1864, while he was waiting for his regiment to be exchanged, and sanctified the marriage at the Youngsville church, Lafayette Parish, in August 1865, soon after he signed his end-of-war-prisoner parole papers at New Iberia. They settled probably at Youngsville. Their son Sevenne, fils was born in January 1865. Sevenne, called Cevenne by the recording priest, remarried to fellow Acadian Donatille Trahan in a civil ceremony in Lafayette Parish in December 1868. They remained near Youngsville. Their son Séverin was born in January 1870.\n\n3\n\nOlivier was born in Lafayette Parish in October 1847.\n\n4\n\nYoungest son Lasty Treville was born near Grand Coteau, St. Landry Parish, in August 1851.\n\nDescendants of Pierre Valéry ROY (1820-; Jean dit La Liberté, François, Abraham, Sauveur)\n\nPierre Valéry, called Valéry, younger son of Joseph Roy le jeune and Marie Ursule David, grandson of Sauveur, and younger brother of Joseph Sylvère, was born in St. James Parish in June 1820. He followed his older brother to the western prairies, where he married Clémentine, daughter of Isleño Creole Balthazar Plaisance and his Acadian wife Henriette Breaux, at the Vermilionville church, Lafayette Parish, in July 1841. Did the family line survive?\n\nOther ROYs on the Western Prairies\n\nArea church and civil records make it difficult to link some Roys in the western parishes with known Acadian lines of the family there:\n\nMarie, also called Joséphine, Roy married Edmond or Édouard Picard in a civil ceremony in St. Martin Parish in September 1851. The parish clerk who recorded the marriage did not give the parents' names. Josephine died in St. Martin Parish in May 1863, age 40.\n\nCharles Euclide, called Euclide, Roy married Acadian Belzire Boudreaux and settled near Abbeville, Vermilion Parish, by the early 1850s. Their daughters married into the Broussard family. Euclide remarried to Athanaise, daughter of French Canadian Olivier Blanchet and his Acadian wife Carmélite Boudreaux, at the Vermilionville church, Lafayette Parish, in December 1856. In July 1850, the federal census taker in Lafayette Parish counted 21 slaves--8 males and 13 females, 12 blacks and 9 mulattoes, ranging in age from 40 years to 6 months, living in 3 houses--on Euclide Roy's plantation. Euclide died by April 1868, when he and his wife were listed as deceased in a daughter's marriage record.\n\nMarie Zulma Roy married Acadian Eugène Bourque at the Abbeville church, Vermilion Parish, in July 1861. The priest who recorded the marriage did not bother to give the couple's parents' names.\n\nAccording to church records, Marie Madeleine Roy, wife or widow of Baptiste Breaux, died in Lafayette Parish in October 1864. The Vermilionville priest who recorded her burial said that she died at age 88. Was she a kinswoman of the Acadian Roys of Lafayette and St. Martin parishes? Was she even a Roy? Baptiste Breaux of Grand Prairie, Lafayette Parish, who was born in July 1779 and who died in March 1837, had a wife named Anne-Marie-Madeleine Girouard. Was this her?\n\nAlcide Roy died near Breaux Bridge, St. Martin Parish, in May 1866. The priest who recorded the burial, and who did not give any parents' names or mention a wife, said that Alcide died \"at age 30 yrs.\"\n\nÉmilie Roy married Onésime, son of perhaps Acadian Julien Leger, fils, in a civil ceremony in Lafayette Parish in January 1868. The parish clerk who recorded the marriage did not give the couple's parents' names.\n\nNON-ACADIAN FAMILIES in LOUISIANA\n\nDespite its meaning, the surname Roy is a common one in France, Switzerland, Germany, even England, and in French Canada and other places where the French have settled. It should be no surprise, then, that many of the Roys of South Louisiana are not Acadians but French Creoles, French Canadians, Foreign French, Swiss, Germans, and even Anglo Americans. Non-Acadian Roys were living in French Louisiana from the beginning of the colony. During the colonial period, they could be found not only at New Orleans, but also at Natchitoches, on the German Coast, at Pointe Coupée, and out on the western prairies:\n\nJean-Baptiste, called Jean, Roy of La Rochelle, France, a gunner, \"joined the Iberville group in 1704. ... In that year he married Renée Gilbert of Tours at Ft. Louis[-de-la-Louisiane, or Old Mobile, then a part of French Louisiana]; in 1705 she produced one of the first offspring of French parents to be born in Lower Louisiana\"; they named their son Jacques. In the spring of 1708, their son Jean-Philippe was the first European child baptized on Massacre, now Dauphin, Island, at the mouth of Mobile Bay, where Jean and Renée had recently settled. In c1719, Jean returned to France to testify before the Conseil de la Marine about the ill treatment of colonial employees, but the Conseil was unsympathetic. Jean likely returned to his family on Île Dauphine.\n\nÉtienne LeRoy dit Frambroise of Paris \"was in Natchitoches Post as early as 1722.\" He married French Creole Marie-Louise-Françoise Guillot and settled in the Rivière-aux-Cannes, or Cane River, area south of Natchitoches. They had daughters but no sons.\n\nMadeleine, daughter of François Roy and Marie Vinette of Rochefort, France, and widow of Jaques Delery, écuyer, \"officer in the royal troops,\" remarried to François, Sieur Gillaul, écuyer, son of Charles Descoublant, écuyer, Sieur de la Rousseliere, at New Orleans in May 1722.\n\nIn May 1724, M. Roy, among \"the principal inhabitants of the colony,\" was allotted 48 feet of lumber for the construction of a church at New Orleans.\n\nÉstienne Roy, \"resident of the outlying area of the Parish of New Orleans along the Mississippi River,\" died at New Orleans in December 1727, age 31. The priest who recorded the burial did not give Éstienne's parents' names or mention a wife. He may have been the Étienne Roy, who, a census taker in November 1724 noted, was a \"nephew of Chauvin, from Montréal, who lives on Mr. Bienville's land [at Cannes Brûlé]. His wife and an Indian woman are with him. He had lost about 20 arpents of sugar cane in a fire.\"\n\nLouis, son of Pierre Roy and Marie-Catherine Ducharme of Montréal and widower of Marguerite Dumay, remarried to Marie-Jeanne, daughter of Charles Magnus of Chaumont, Chambrai, France, and widow of ____ Rienne of Natchez, at New Orleans in April 1730.\n\nMarie-Marguerite, Louis's sister, also a native of Montréal, married Nicolas, son of Michel Adam of New Orleans, at New Orleans in September 1731.\n\nAntoine Roy, native of Montréal, Canada, died at New Orleans in November 1731. The priest who recorded the burial did not give Antoine's parents' names, mention a wife, or give his age at the time of his death.\n\nJean Roy married Anne Catherine Munich, place and date unrecorded, and settled at St.-Charles des Allemands on the Lower German Coast by the mid-1740s.\n\nJacques Roy, a cooper, married Marguerite Le Hous, Le Hout, or Le Houx, place and date unrecorded. Their son Jacques, fils was born at New Orleans October 1746. The boy's godfather was Jacques Cantrelle, the future founder of Cabanocé/St.-Jacques on the river above the German Coast.\n\nDorothée, daughter of Gabriel Roy and Christine Eigenbergerinne of Feltelinger, Basel, Switzerland, married Morant, son of Jacque Willig of Walheim, Basel, Switzerland, at St. Charles des Allemands in December 1753.\n\nPierre Roy, native of Reims, France, an invalid soldier, and widower of Françoise Labrot, married Marie-Renée Caynette of Lorient, France, widow of Honoré Gorderin, at New Orleans in March 1764.\n\nJean, son of Pierre Roy and Marie Segrestan of Monsegure, Guyenne, France, married Hippolite, daughter of Gilbert Cianigu of Villefranche, Rousillon, France, at New Orleans in April 1764.\n\nDenis Roy of Bire, Normandy, France, died at Pointe Coupée in February 1771. The priest who recorded the burial did not give Denis's parents' names, mention a wife, or give his age at the time of his death.\n\nMarie Roy, native of Mobile, Widow Poupart, died at New Orleans in March 1772, age 60.\n\nJoseph Roy married Marie-Francoise Lejeune probably at Pointe Coupée, date unrecorded. Their son Joseph, fils was baptized at Pointe Coupée, age unrecorded, in August 1775.\n\nAuguste or Augustin, son of Nicolas Roy and Jeanne Delarie of New Orleans, married Marie, daughter of French Creole Francois Maron, at Pointe Coupée in April 1779. Their son Auguste Marionau was born at Pointe Coupée in 1783. Auguste, père may have died at Opelousas in September 1800; if so, his succession was filed at what became the Opelousas courthouse, St. Landry Parish, that month. Auguste Marioau's succession may have been filed at what became the Opelousas courthouse in August 1804.\n\nBasile, son of Francois Roy and Marie La Lievre of Normandy, France, married Marguerite, daughter of Frenchman Jacques Bourgeois, at Attakapas in February 1793.\n\nPierre, son of Léonard Roy and Thérèse Janeau of Dro, Agen, France, married Marie-Thérèse, daughter of Jean Souquet of New Orleans, at New Orleans in May 1802.\n\n.\n\nA Roy from Canada via Detroit and Illinois settled at Pointe Coupée during the 1740s. Two of his sons moved to the Opelousas prairies in the 1780s, the first of the name to go there and remain. During the early antebellum period, some of his grandsons settled at Attakapas, but most of his descendants remained in St. Landry Parish. No other Roy family in Louisiana, Acadian or non-Acadian, equaled this one in numbers. Some of his descendants married Acadians:\n\nDescendants of Joseph ROY dit Châtellerault (c1709-1761)\n\nJoseph dit Châtellerault, son of Emond Roy and Marie-Anne Janvier, born at Ste.-Anne near Québec, Canada, in c1709, got his family dit from his paternal grandfather, Michel Roy dit Châtellerault, who came from the interior of Poitou to Canada in the late 1670s.

Many of the Roys who lived on the prairies, especially in St. Landry Parish, may have been descendants of French Canadian Joseph dit Châtellerault, but area church and civil records make it difficult to establish the connection. One also suspects that some of the Royss who lived in the region during the post-war period were Afro Creoles once owned by members of the family or whose progenitor bore the given name \"Roy.\" Area church and civil records do not always reveal their ethnicity, but the record keepers sometimes provided tantalizing clues:\n\nFrançois, son of Louis Roy and Marie Denou of Canada, married Anna, daughter of Anglo-American Samuel Walker, at the St. James church, St. James Parish, in July 1811.\n\nMarie, daughter of Jacques Roy and Marie M'Cany, married Thomas, son of Spanish Creole Joseph Gonzales, at the St. Gabriel church, Iberville Parish, in July 1812.\n\nJesse, son of Anglo-Americans James Roy and Amilia Yocum, married Nancy Peace in a civil ceremony in St. Landry Parish in August 1813.\n\nThérèse Roy, called the widow Derbonne, married French Creole Louis Bello in a civil ceremony in St. Landry Parish in September 1813.

Their son Clément Joseph Elzear was born in Pointe Coupee Parish in July 1866, and Clément Joseph Antoine in February 1870.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nRoys settled early in French Acadia, and a descendant of Jean Roy dit La Liberté of St.-Malo was among the earliest Acadians to find refuge in Louisiana. Widower Abraham Roy and two of his children came to Louisiana in February 1765 with the Broussard party from Halifax via Cap-Français, French St.-Domingue. They followed the Broussards to the Bayou Teche valley, but they did not remain there. By early 1766, they had moved to Cabanocé/St.-Jacques on the river above New Orleans probably to escape an epidemic along the Teche that killed dozens of their fellow Acadians the previous summer and fall. Abraham remarried to a fellow Acadian, a widow, at Cabanocé soon after he got there, and his new wife gave him another son. His two sons settled at St.-Jacques and had sons of their own. Beginning in the 1810s, Abraham Roy's three grandsons and two of his great-grandsons abandoned the river and \"returned\" to the western prairies, where they settled in St. Martin and Lafayette parishes. By the 1840s, no Acadian Roys remained on the river.\n\nRoys from France and Canada lived in Louisiana from the earliest days of the colony. A French Canadian widower who had lived at Detroit and Kaskaskia, Illinois, settled at Pointe Coupée in the 1740s, but his sons by his second wife did not remain there. In the 1780s, they crossed the Atchafalaya Basin to the Opelousas prairies, where their lines proliferated. Most of them remained in what became St. Landry Parish, but some of them moved down into the old Attakapas District, complicating the family's genealogical picture there. By the late antebellum period, these French-Canadian Roys greatly outnumbered their Acadian namesakes on the western prairies. Other, smaller Roy families settled in the western parishes. Meanwhile, another French-Canadian family, no relation to the Roys of St. Landry and St. Martin, moved from Pointe Coupée to the Avoyelles prairie in the 1790s and created a new center of family settlement there. During the antebellum period, dozens of Roys, called Foreign French in Louisiana, came to New Orleans from France and the Caribbean Basin; most of them probably remained in the city. No Roy family appeared in the Bayou Lafourche valley until late in the antebellum period; they probably were not Acadian.\n\nJudging by the number of slaves they owned during the late antebellum period, some Roys, both Acadians and non-Acadians, lived well on their plantations and farms on the western prairies. By the time of his death in late 1847, Acadian Charles Roy amassed a holding of two dozen slaves on his Lafayette Parish plantation. His eldest son Désiré must have inherited most of his people; Désiré held only three slaves on his Lafayette Parish farm in 1850, but a decade later he owned 36. Some of their French-Canadian namesakes in nearby St. Landry and St. Martin parishes did almost as well. Noël Roy's widow held 30 slaves on her plantation in St. Landry Parish in 1860. Her husband's cousin Pierre Ulgère Roy, who was her neighbor, owned 14 slaves. Cousin Alexandre Roy held 13 slaves on his farm in St. Martin Parish. In Avoyelles Parish, French Canadian François Roy owned 14 slaves in 1850 and 19 a decade later. His cousin Villeneuve Roy, also of Avoyelles, held 15 slaves in 1860. The largest slaveholder with the name, however, lived nowhere near his prairie namesakes. Frédéric Roy, a native of France, held 44 slaves on his St. Bernard Parish plantation in 1850; a decade later, he owned 50 slaves--enough to qualify him as a \"large planter.\" But most Roys, like most Southerners, did not own slaves, at least none who appeared on the federal slaves schedules of 1850 and 1860, and thus participated only peripherally in the South's antebellum plantation economy.\n\nDozens of Roys, both Acadian and non-Acadian, served Louisiana in uniform during the War of 1861-65. ...\n\nThe family's name also is spelled Leroy, Le Roy, Roi, Roye.
