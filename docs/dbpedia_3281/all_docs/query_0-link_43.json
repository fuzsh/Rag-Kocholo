        "text": "Emily Ann (Rathman) Box Blackmon, age 78, of Milan, MI passed away on February 14, 2021, surrounded by loved ones. She was born on January 26, 1943 in Ann Arbor, MI.\n\nEmily grew up in Ann Arbor, graduating from Ann Arbor Pioneer High School in 1961. She moved to Chelsea in 1972 with her family, and she worked for the Chelsea School District as a school bus driver and supervised the South School Elementary cafeteria and playground. She cherished every moment being in children’s lives—especially driving school bus numbers 4 and 28 and transporting children with special needs over the years. During this time, Emily also worked for the Village Bakery in downtown Chelsea. She loved seeing and hearing from everyone. In 1988, Emily became a test driver for the Chrysler Corporation’s Chelsea Proving Grounds, where she met the love of her life, Guy G. Blackmon, who predeceased her along with her parents, Orville F. and Alice C. (Trumbull) Rathman.\n\nFor the majority of her life, Emily lived in Washtenaw County, until recently moving to Milan. The Milan community embraced her and Guy, and together, they made lasting relationships within the Milan Seniors for Healthy Living and Silver Fox communities. While in Chelsea, Emily was a member of St. Mary Catholic Church and choir.\n\nEmily was devoted to her Catholic faith, her family, and everyone who entered her life. For Emily, no one was a stranger; they were all special friends. Emily thoroughly loved to attend mass, read, sew, knit, garden, and she was an amazing scrapbooker. Most of all, she loved her family and her friends. Behind that humble and quiet demeanor was a fierce competitor and loyal fan to any school, team, or organization with whom her family was associated.\n\nSurvivors include her children, Andrew (Laura) Box of Ypsilanti, MI, Catherine (Robert) Taylor of Howell, MI, and adopted son, Douglas (Marleyn) Eder of Chelsea, MI; her six grandchildren, David Box of Milan, Thomas (Rachel) Box of Dearborn, MI, Taylor (Jake Yenser) Walters of Howell, MI, Courtney and Dru Taylor of Howell, MI, and Adrian Eder of Chelsea, MI. With great anticipation, Emily was excited to be introduced this year to her first great-grandchild, Baby Box (Thomas and Rachel). Emily has one surviving brother, Thomas (Penny) Rathman of Marion, MI, and three surviving cousins: Ann Jamieson of Belleville, MI, Jill Malarney of Hudson, MI, and Jeannie (Mike) Sluys of Wauseon, OH; as well as several nephews and nieces. Among Emily’s friends and family are Judy Burgoyen, Debbie Hilabruk, Kitty Koch, Betsy (Cliff) Kuhn, Evelyn (Robert) Mitchell, and Kay Ridenour. Additionally, Emily and Guy’s extended family included friends from the Country Pub, Knight’s Steakhouse, Milan Coney Island, and Stiver’s Restaurant.\n\nEmily’s family would like to express their deepest appreciation for the love and support they continue to receive, as well as the compassionate care provided by all Michigan Medicine’s medical teams and staff throughout her stay—in particular, to Dr. Pauline Park, Dr. Bradford Wylie, Barbara Kelly (RN), and the staff on the 6th floor B.\n\nServices for Emily are private. Expressions of sympathy may be made in Emily’s memory to the Milan Seniors for Healthy Living. Arrangements by Staffan-Mitchell Funeral Home, Chelsea."
