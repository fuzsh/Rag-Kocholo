        "text": "Blacksmith Roy Keys iron legacy still echoes in Ingrams memory\n\nEDITORS NOTE  This is the 77th of a series of articles marking Kerr Countys sesquicentennial.\n\nBy Irene Van Winkle\n\nWest Kerr Current\n\nThe village blacksmith evokes the image of a hulking, soot-covered man standing in a town square, pounding thick metal rods in front of a roaring inferno with a rhythmic ear-jarring clang as sparks fly in all directions. Hed make swords, lance tips and armor for knights bound for battle, and shoes for the horses.\n\nThe reality in most towns, however, was much less extreme and dramatic, but the memories remain.\n\nIngrams own original village blacksmith certainly was not a large man by any standard  but legend has it that he wore out four anvils in his lifetime. He reckoned hed crafted thousands of brands alone, in addition to the innumerable other implements used in everyday ranch life in the Hill Country.\n\nRoy Willice Key (1892-1992) went off to fight in WWI, and a few years after he came home he began swinging his hammer by a forge. He didnt stop until he retired at 88 years of age, about 55 years after opening up his downtown shop.\n\nThrough the years, he was the subject of numerous stories and interviews, and was even featured on NBC television, but he didnt seem to mind the celebrity.\n\nThe trade he plied for all those years, however, more or less fell into his lap. As he once put it, I was talkin when I shouldve been listening.\n\nRoys daughter Rachel Viola Key Gowan is still chipper as ever at 82 years of age. She lives just down the road from her fathers old blacksmith shop in Ingram with Warren, her husband of more than 50 years.\n\nShe said Roy lived two days past his 100th birthday, 10 years after she had taken him in to care for him.\n\nRoy was born in Willow City, Texas, one of eight children of James Floyd Key (1866-1957) of Moulton, Texas, and his Colorado-born wife, Lydia Malinda Tarlton (1873-1949). His siblings were Fred, Zoe Lee, Ruben, Sitha Vesta, Glynn, Rachel and Sam.\n\nJames worked as a rancher and caretaker, but Viola said that he was not known to be much of a provider, and apparently expected his children to support him.\n\nMy dad had to go to work as a cowboy when he was only 11 years old to earn a living and help the family, she said.\n\nWhen he went to war, hed sent home most of his paychecks so it could go into the bank, he told me. After he got back, he said that most of the money was gone. His father had squandered it all.\n\nJames and Lydia eventually moved to Ingram in their later years and were buried in Nichols Cemetery.\n\nAs a doughboy, Roy worked as a muleskinner in the Army infantry. He was stationed in France, and although he didnt do much shooting, he still had some close calls.\n\nHe wrote a patriotic poem that summed up his feelings, called Decorate My Casket with Red, White and Blue:\n\nWhen we said from Old America,\n\nTell the Kaiser in advance,\n\nThat business will be picking up,\n\nWhen our Sammies land in France.\n\nThey will find us rough and ready,\n\nYou may depend on every one,\n\nWe will make those Germans really think,\n\nThat war has just began.\n\nFarewell dear old America,\n\nIf we never come back to you,\n\nJust decorate our casket\n\nWith Red, White and Blue.\n\nWe are not in this struggle\n\nFor selfish gain or wealth\n\nNeither are we sailing now,\n\nTo Europe, for our health.\n\nKaiser, you had better beat it,\n\nThat is what you will have to do,\n\nYour iron shall be shattered,\n\nIf it takes Red, White and Blue.\n\n Roy W. Key, Co. A 143rd Inf., Camp Bowie.\n\nRoy kept working as a cowboy in the Eldorado area, and then moved to Kerr County in 1921. In an interview done by Suzy Banks of Austin shortly before he died, Roy talked between pauses of chewing tobacco, describing how he came to take up blacksmithing in the first place.\n\nHe said hed been working at a large ranch before his move to Ingram.\n\nI put in 14 years on one ranch, a big ranch ... When I came out of the service, I went back to work on the same ranch. But the fellow that owned it owned three ranches. One with 14 sections, one with eight sections, and one with four sections. I worked on the one with eight sections. While I was in the service, he let that eight-section ranch run down so. I went back there for two years and he wouldnt allow me enough money to really build the place back up where itd pay off. So I quit and moved to Ingram. I moved 1,000 head of goats here with me. I had them up on where Indian Creek comes into Old Ingram.\n\nUnable to keep them because of a cedar break on a hill, Roy decided to sell his goats.\n\nOne day, on his way to the post office, he passed the blacksmith shop, and Roy heard the owner offer to sell him the shop. Offhandedly, Roy said, OK, without taking him seriously.\n\nYou see I thought he was joking, Roy said. The next Sunday he came up to where I was staying and brought his wife with him. We sat around for a good while, then after a bit, he said, Well, Im ready to go to town and make out the papers tomorrow. Id forgotten about what he said, you know, and I said, What papers?\n\nHe said, For my blacksmith shop. I said, I thought you were joking. He said, Oh, no. You bought it.\n\nRoy agreed to pay $750, which was a great deal of money in 1922, the midst of the Depression. He also paid another $500 for the house that went with it. Putting the blacksmith shop on hold for two months, he finished up the shearing hed been doing in Blanco County, and then opened up for business.\n\nRoys first blacksmith shop was near Miss Kittys place in Old Ingram Loop. His second shop was behind the familys later home, one block east of Johnson Creek.\n\nThe Village Blacksmith shop found its final and most well-known spot. It was at the northwest corner of Junction Highway and Main Street, in a rock building that is still standing, just across the street from Woodburys Taxidermy and Neu-Mart. Some of the boards on the outside of the building with brands burned in are still there. Roy had hundreds of them all over the walls, Viola said.\n\nOnce he got going, Roy became well-known for his rock hammers, and for what people then called crowbars  digging tools which had to be sharp and strong enough to cut post holes in the rocky land.\n\nI made between 8,000 and 9,000 brands, Roy said. I had a big ledger. I made a lot of horse brands and cow brands and goat brands. I wouldnt make a brand without the mans name and address and a drawing from him. It didnt take me long to learn to make them do the drawings themselves .... that way, I couldnt make a mistake.\n\nSadly, later, a burglar broke into his home and stole the ledger.\n\nRoy married Gussie Margaret Smith (born 1899), whose father, William, had married twice. Williams first wife, Julia Frances Cook, died in 1892 after bearing him six children. His second wife, Etta Mae Cupps, was much younger than William, and had Violas mother, and five more children, born near a little place called Trickham, Texas.\n\nGussie and Roy had four children: Roy Allen, born in 1920, who died as an infant of whooping cough; then came Roscoe James (1922-1993), who was born on the far end of Indian Creek Road\n\nBy the time the family had moved into Old Ingram, Viola was born in 1925 at the family home, and the youngest child, Harold Gene, came along two years later.\n\nRoy was active in the community, serving on the school board in Ingram, and as a deacon in the Hunt Baptist Church. Reflecting on her own childhood, Viola hand-wrote a little piece for her children called My Memories of the Ingram School, portions of which are excerpted here:\n\nThe day I had waited for had come at last in 1931, she wrote. I was to start school. ... The school was a four-room masonry block building on a hill near the present site of the elementary school. ... My first teachers were Mrs. Mildred Cromes and Mrs. Abbie Lee. The first and second grades were in the same room.\n\nThere was a rock rim which went around the outside of the building starting near the ground but growing more slim and higher from the ground. At recess time we would often walk around the rim facing and holding on to the wall of the school building with our hands, until we fell. We made rock playhouses, jumped rope, played Red Rover, Red Rover and had ball games.\n\nIn 1932, there was a 10-inch rainfall and the ... my (parents) gathered their family together with supplies in the car to spend the night in the school with many more families. We were fortunate for our home was not harmed, as so many families lost their homes.\n\nIt was after this event that Roy built a new blacksmith shop, his second, on higher ground. Viola said that as a tot, she remembered seeing cowboys driving cattle through Ingram. Their home was a busy place, and her mother even helped birth babies in addition to doing all the heavy household work.\n\nIn 1934, a new one-story school building of masonry was erected, Viola continued. Members of the board of Trustees were Ben Mosel, president, Roy Key, secretary and William Stone. Charles C. Craig served as principal of the school from 1934-1950. The new erected building cost $13,800.\n\nWarren said his parents divorced when he was young, and he was raised by his grandmother in Eastland. He went to WWII as a Seabee, setting up sawmills in the Pacific. He had come up to visit the Hill Country, where he and Viola met.\n\nIt took a few years of waiting before Warren got the answer he wanted after his proposal to Viola. Her brother, Harold Gene (1927-1943), was instrumental in convincing her to accept, but Harold never saw the wedding.\n\nAt the age of 15, Harold was working for Jasper Moore, Viola said. He and Starr Ingram were hauling wood for Jasper Moore and the truck went out of control, and he was killed nine miles west of Junction.\n\nViola remembered burning kerosene lamps until electricity (and paved roads) finally came to Ingram while she was at Tivy High School.\n\nWarren and Viola married in 1944 after she graduated. He said that he grew very close to her parents, and considered them like his own.\n\nHe still calls Roy Pops, when talking about him.\n\nWarren was injured in the Pacific, and the couple moved around on various assignments, including Corpus Christi and Rhode Island. It was the first time Viola had ever left home, but she was able to enjoy it.\n\nAfter the war, Warren worked for years as a carpenter, following his fathers trade. He built the home they live in, and many other houses and buildings in the area, including seven filling stations. He also worked for 13 years as a cabinet maker for James Averys Craftsman.\n\nWarren and Violas children -- Warnetta, Benny Roy and Ronnie  all attended Ingram schools, too.\n\nRoy moved to Kerrville after he retired, but lived his last decade with Viola and Warren. Although she said she knew her father loved her, Viola added, shortly before he died, he thanked her. I love this home, and I love you, he said.\n\nThat was the first time he told me he loved me ... it was very healing to my heart, Viola said.\n\nOnce considered a dying trade  except for some farriers  the craft of working metal in one form or another still exists. According to Bill Givens of Givens Metalcrafts in Ingram, even for those who still used a forge, they are not engaged in the same type of work.\n\nWe do more ornamental kind of work. I use a forge, but I dont make the things Roy Key did. He made things for people to use every day  like crowbars and brands, not decorative pieces, Givens said.\n\nIn August, 1982, the first of several Hammerfests was organized as a tribute to Keys lifetime of sharpening crowbars, fashioning supports for wagon wheels and crafting branding irons for hundreds of ranches. It was organized by Rick Ross, who bought the shop from Roy, renaming it Guadalupe Forge, and co-hosted by Givens Metalcrafts, and The Village Blacksmith.\n\nIn 1958, there were more than 8,000 blacksmith shops in the US. Those numbers had tumbled within 30 years to nearly nil, which actually put Roy on a short list  he did work from people in nine counties in later years.\n\nBy the time Hammerfest began, a group of blacksmiths reorganized and had grown to about 2,000 members. Today, there are more than 4,000 members in ABANA (Artists-Blacksmiths Association of North America).\n\nAsked why he stuck so long to that one profession, Roy said, One of the things I like about blacksmithing was it wasnt just one job all the time. Back in the wagon days, when you went to work on a ranch, shoeing horses and mules is the first thing you learned. I knew something about building wagon wheels, any kind of buggy or hack. One of the things I didnt know anything about was about sharpening plows. But I learned.\n\nWhen I first started, people knew I didnt know anything, but they stayed with me and I stayed with them. I turned out to be, I guess, a pretty good blacksmith."
