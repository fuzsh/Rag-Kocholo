(Cairns) Walters. She was a loving wife and mother who was dedicated to her children.\n\nJulia and her husband were founding members of the Malignant Hyperthermia Association of United States (MHAUS) in 1981.

Even on his deathbed, he had that sweet, calm, Larry smile that always warmed the hearts of those around him. I didn’t just lose my husband but truly my best friend and partner in life! He was an amazing man and lived every day of his life to the fullest. I do rejoice in the fact that he will no longer suffer, which he has tremendously in the last 3 years, from the cancer beast that moved into our home. Our son Jasper and I shared his last moments together and it was so good to see him finally out of pain. My heart is broken but I am so blessed that he gave me Jasper, and 33 years of endless love and fun!\n\nLarry grew up in the shadow of the Shrine of the Little Flower Church in Royal Oak and attended the Catholic schools there. He acquired a Master’s degree in his passion in life, Geology, from Wayne State and used that to hold a 34-year career with the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, where he regulated landfills as a dual district supervisor. We met at the State District Office, married in 1991, traveled for 10 years and had our son Jasper (named after a Michigan rock of course) in 2001 who has been the complete joy of our life.\n\nThe Fisher Ridge Cave System that is one of the longest caves in the world was discovered, explored and mapped by Larry and several other cavers. This was the love of his life before he met me! He loved rock collecting and even collected rare copper crystals in Michigan’s Keweenaw Peninsula with other geology friends. The rock theme continued into Rock Climbing, and teaching Geology as an adjunct professor at the University of Michigan Dearborn and Eastern Michigan University. He taught many local people, young and old alike, a love of rocks at the Waterloo Geology Eddy Center for many years.\n\nHe loved reptiles and snakes and cared for several box turtles as pets for over 30 years which gave him the name “Uncle Turtle” by his many nieces and nephews. Larry and I shared a love of all things old and found our dream 1870 historic home in Chelsea and filled it with antiques from our hobby of going to auctions. Trains of all sizes were another passion of his and he held the position of President of the Chelsea Depot Association for several years.\n\nLarry was a one in a million person who had an infectious lifelong childlike wonder of everything around him. He was a little boy in a man’s body and he made life fun for all around him. He never had a mean thing to say about anyone and was very loving, forgiving and patient. I will carry him in my heart forever and look for him at the rainbow bridge in paradise!\n\nFuneral will be held at the Chelsea Depot on Wednesday, May 22, 2024 at 1:00 p.m. with viewing from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Larry would not have wanted flowers, but for donations to go to the Chelsea Depot Association which he loved dearly!\n\nArrangements by Staffan-Mitchell Funeral Home, Chelsea.\n\nKirk Pitman Hansen\n\nof Ann Arbor, Michigan, formerly of Lake Isabella\n\nAge 49, passed away on May 14, 2024.

She was known as Winnie-Sue until she shortened her name to Winn. But to her family, Winnie always fit her best.\n\nIn her early years, she lived with her Grandmother and grew up with cousins and extended family nearby. During her junior year of high school, her beloved Grandmother passed and Winnie moved to Clarkston, MI to live with her mother and step-father. It was there that she met her first love, Jim Hagen. They married in 1955 and had three sons. She enjoyed being home with the boys and they kept her quite busy. But the young family suffered a life-changing loss when Jim tragically died in an auto accident.\n\nWinnie and the boys moved in with relatives until she was able to find a way to support her family. Due to her endless determination, she secured a job as a secretary and rented a house for her and her boys, in Detroit, MI.\n\nIn 1964, she went on a blind date and met the second love of her life, Joseph Parker. They were married a year later and eventually added a daughter to the family. They moved to Chelsea when Joe took a job in Human Resource at the Chelsea Proving Grounds. Winnie went back to taking care of her family for many years until she returned to work as a secretary, also at the Chelsea Proving Grounds.\n\nAt the age of 35, one of the greatest moments in her life occurred – she met her biological father, John Roe. The instant connection they had was a valuable missing piece in Winnie’s life. She and her father had many similarities and they clearly enjoyed each other during the few years they had together. She also happily gained a sister and step-mother.\n\nWinnie and Joe made a lot of wonderful friends through the years and enjoyed hosting their friends and family for dinners as well as boating, playing billiards, euchre and pinochle, dancing and watching movies.\n\nShe nurtured her own hobbies too and for years she roller-skated weekly, rode her bicycle and went cross-country skiing. Her crocheting and knitting skills were excellent and her family benefitted from her creations. She was also an avid reader, craft painter and maintained a strong spiritual faith.\n\nWhen you spent time with Winnie, you would first notice her beautiful smile and sweet, quiet nature. But she also had an excellent sense of humor and the gift of perfect timing. She always enjoyed a good laugh-either with you or at your expense.\n\nWinnie was a grandmother to eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. She adored them all!\n\nShe was preceded in death by her parents, her husband Joseph Parker, her son Barry Hagen, and infant grandson Jeffrey Allen Hagen.\n\nShe is survived by her sons: Daniel Hagen (Pam Greenleaf-Hagen), Michael Hagen (Daniela), daughter: Dianna Kause (Jeff) all of Chelsea and daughter-in-law, Margie Hagen of Dearborn.\n\nGrandchildren: Leslie Hagen (Kevin Doyne and great-grandson Oren) of Hayward CA, Julie Hagen of Ypsilanti, Kelly Hagen (Tony Franklin and great-grandson Enzo) of Pensacola, FL, Vincent Kause (Maggie Seifert) of Lansing, Julia Kause of East Lansing, Isabella and Ava-Reese Hagen of Chelsea.\n\nSister: Jennifer Ellison (Jeff) of Westfield, IN.\n\nPlus, many nieces and nephews.\n\nThe family of Winnie Parker would like to thank the staff and volunteers at Chelsea Retirement Community and Towsley Village for the wonderful care of Winnie and support to the family.\n\nA private celebration of life will be held at a later date.\n\nIn honor of Winnie, donations may be made to Ele’s Place, a center for grieving children and teens. www.Elesplace.org\n\n“How lucky am I to have something that makes saying good-bye so hard?”\n\n-Winnie the Pooh\n\nJason “J” Andrew AtLee\n\nof Ypsilanti, Michigan\n\nAge 43, died Monday, May 13, 2024, from injuries due to a motorcycle accident.\n\nHe was born August 7, 1980, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, the son of Cyrus “Cy” and Rowena May (Beebe) AtLee.\n\nJason graduated from Chelsea High School in 1999.

His early love for soccer turned to football and track in high school. Noah graduated from Chelsea High School in 2016. He made deep friendships competing as a teammate in sports. Playing football as a wide receiver and running track in 300-meter hurdles and high jump gave him the opportunity to experience State finals competitions in both sports with his friends.\n\nNoah enjoyed playing saxophone and participated in “Company C,” a singing and dance ensemble, as well as finding peace in playing the piano at home.

He was also an active member of the Psi Upsilon fraternity (Philanthropy Chair) and Vice President of the Internal Relations Interfraternity Council. He was a proud Spartan and became a campus tour guide.\n\nHe enjoyed volunteering by helping to build homes for Habitat for Humanity through his fraternity. As part of an MSU student abroad program, he worked supporting children at a refugee camp in Greece.\n\nAfter college, Noah moved east to Massachusetts and Connecticut, eventually landing back in the Midwest in Chicago, which he loved like a second MSU home. He worked as a global product manager in the life science industry, which allowed him to blend his engineering and business skills.\n\nNoah had a lifelong passion for reading and travel, immersing himself in new people and cultures. His interest in foreign places took him to around 20 countries providing adventuresome memories and fun stories from travels with family or new friends. In middle school, Noah earned a trip to Japan to attend the Chelsea-Shimuzu Sister City Exchange Program. He traveled to South Africa with fellow incoming freshman MSU classmates, where he met some of his closest friends. His family hosted exchange students from Greenland, Japan and Vietnam.

The formative events of the 60s and 70s inspired articles and books with his colleague and mentor, Bill Henderson: Economic Disparity: Problems and Strategies for Black America and Urban Economics: Processes and Problems.\n\nHe had a significant impact on national urban policy as Visiting Scholar for the U.S. Economic Development Association’s Office of Economic Research, and as Senior Economist and Associate Director of Research of President Carter’s White House Conference on Balanced National Growth and Economic Development. Strategies for regional collaboration and development evolved from his research. His work emphasized regional cooperation as an effective economic development strategy – a concept unheard of at that time.\n\nHis work at The Urban Institute as a Senior Research Associate and Director of its Economic Development Program continued to address national issues through entrepreneurial research and guiding state and local governments to implement effective economic development programs. During this time as a consultant he met Bill Barnes, Research Director at the National League of Cities. For three decades, they co-authored groundbreaking research on regional economies and about the interdependency of the welfare of cities and suburbs. Their contributions catalyzed the vision of the United States as a national system of economic regions.\n\nAs professor and Director of the Center for Urban Studies at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan and as professor and Director of The Urban Center at Cleveland State University, Cleveland, Ohio. Larry was a strong proponent of building partnerships and collaborations among public, private, and nonprofit community sectors, and was frequently a key speaker – locally, regionally, and nationally.\n\nAt Cleveland State University’s Urban Center from 1995 until his retirement in 2010, Larry and colleagues researched and wrote prolifically, with a special focus on the adaptive reuse of sacred landmarks. Larry’s efforts to develop human capital within the Levin College and Urban Center had enduring impact. He had an uncanny ability to identify undergraduate and Ph.D. students with promise and help them achieve their goals. Many now hold leadership roles in the public, private, and nonprofit sectors.\n\nHe served as Editor of Economic Development Quarterly (EDQ) for 10 years overseeing a substantial transition of the journal from a manual publication to an online format.\n\nAfter his retirement he and his wife, Susan, moved to Chelsea, Michigan. He enjoyed visiting his children and grandchildren, fishing, and touring baseball fields with his brothers-in-law. He served his local community by chairing the Chelsea Planning Commission.\n\nLarry died peacefully at home on February 5, 2024. He is survived by his wife, Susan Whitelaw, his daughters, Kathryn Ledebur, of Cochabamba, Bolivia, and Lara Sprenger (Steven), of Islamorada, Florida, and his stepchildren, Guy Downs (Shonnie Becker) of Ypsilanti, Michigan, Shelley Brenner (David) of Chelsea and by eight grandchildren: Elisa Meruvia, Nicholas Radley, Gabriel Downs, Christopher Radley, Sebastian Reinicke, Mia Brenner, Eva Brenner, and Amelia Downs.

He counted himself lucky to be part of two large, close-knit families, and cherished his brothers and sisters, nieces and nephews, cousins and dear friends.\n\nDarcy was born on February 25, 1946, in Sao Paulo, Brazil, to Peter and Marian Stielstra, and grew up in Hartford, Michigan, with his siblings Patricia, Mike, Sally, Chuck, and Scott.

A hunter and fisherman since childhood, he scaled mountains for goats and tracked moose on the tundra with his brother and nephews, and built a 28-foot fishing boat with his friend Tom Emerson, all while continuing to support kids and their teachers as the principal of Peterson Elementary School.\n\nAfter arriving on Kodiak, he fell in love with Marilyn and her sons, and their two unique families turned into one. After twelve years on Kodiak, he said that his life on the island was the longest he’d lived anywhere—he’d found his home—and he was a dedicated member of the community as an educator, fisherman, and storyteller (his performance as Daddy Warbucks in Annie earned the headline: “Kodiak Man Shaves 40-Year Moustache for Art”).\n\nHe took on his battle with pancreatic cancer the same way he took on his life: fiercely and fully, with deep thought and reflection. The first present he gave his kids—the boys as teenagers, and Megan at age five—was a copy of Walden, and he strived to follow his favorite words of Thoreau: “Live in each season as it passes; breathe the air, drink the drink, taste the fruit, and resign yourself to the influence of each.”\n\nBreathe the air today.\n\nWatch the sun come up.\n\nA memorial service will take place at 4 pm AKST on January 24th at St. James the Fisherman Episcopal Church, 421 Thorsheim Street, Kodiak.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations can be made to Island Trails Network, which Darcy hiked three mornings a week.
