        "text": "LEE MACE\n\nLee Mace was born July 30, 1927, at Brumley to Lucian Thomas and Clare Buster Mace. He died June 16, 1985, in a plane crash in Gladstone Cove on Lake of the Ozarks near Gravois Mills. A probe into the fatal crash of his homemade, single-engine airplane, did not disclose any mechanical failure.\n\nTo the residents of the lake area who attended his funeral Thursday, Lee Mace was more than an entertainer. He also was a symbol of economic progress. Perhaps more than anyone else, Lee Mace believed strongly in the future of the Lake of the Ozarks area. He was an early investor in commercial ventures in the area shortly after the lake was built. He pushed relentlessly for progress. Many credit Mace as the driving force behind economic progress in the lake area.\n\nMr. Mace was owner-operator of Lee Mace's Ozark Opry in Osage Beach and he never missed a performance in 32 years, either at home or on the road. He also had a local television show of the same name which aired locally for two decades. Mr. Mace was owner of the Indian Burial Cave, Lakewood Condos, several real estate developments and a recording studio and production company. He was part owner of Modern Sanitation of Osage Beach and was a director at Bank of Lake of the Ozarks.\n\nJim Franklin, president of the Lake of the Ozarks Bank and one of Mace's pallbearers, closed the bank lobby for the funeral and ordered the flat in front of the bank flown at half-mast. It was an appropriate tribute to Mace, a patriotic Christian who loved to perform wholesome country music shows. \"Lee was a Miller County square dancer,\" Franklin said. But in later years Mace became not only a successful entertainer but also a successful businessman, Franklin said. Everything he became involved in prospered.\n\nHe was active in several civic, music and aviation associations, both local and national. Mr. Mace was also a member of the Tuscumbia First Baptist Church, Linn Creek AF & AM, Columbia Valley Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite in Columbia, and the Abou Ben Adhem Shrine Temple in Springfield.\n\nOn August 16, 1950, he was married in Harrison, Ark., to Joyce Williams. In addition to his wife and mother, he was survived by two sisters, Lois Webb of Stillwell, Kan., and Sue Wyrick of Cedar Rapids, Iowa; and several nieces and nephews.\n\nFollowing a funeral service, he was buried in the Gott Cemetery near Ulman. The bass fiddle was Lee Mace's trademark. A black granite headstone was erected in the Gott Cemetery by Holt Monument Co. of Buffalo. The stone was made in St. Cloud Minn. and delivered in two pieces weighing a total of 3,500 pounds. A tracing of a bass violin was supplied to the stone cutters who made the unusual stone.\n\nMAURICE E. MACE FAMILY\n\nMaurice Eugene Mace, son of Claude Mace, deceased, and Mary (Hedge) Mace Bilyeu, Iberia, was born in Springfield, moved to Iberia at age twelve, and attended the Springfield and Iberia Public Schools. Eunice Daffade McKee, daughter of Mary and Albert McKee both deceased, was born in Miller County near Iberia, attended elementary school at Brays District and graduated from the Iberia Academy and Iberia Junior College.\n\nEunice and Maurice were married in 1942, and Maurice was inducted into the army three weeks later. He served three years and was with General Patton's 90th Infantry Division in combat during World War II. He received two injuries and was awarded the Purple Heart and Oak Leaf Cluster. While Maurice was in the Armed Forces, Eunice, having graduated from Knox College, Galesburg, Illinois, taught school in Illinois for three years.\n\nAfter Maurice's honorable discharge from the Army in 1945, the Maces lived in St. Louis three years then moved to the Iberia community. Maurice spent 20 years in Civil service at Fort Leonard Wood and is now retired. Eunice earned her master's degree in Library Science from the University of Missouri, Columbia, and is an administrator in the Waynesville Schools and completing her 34th year in the teaching profession.\n\nThe Maces have three children: Mary Gwendolyn, Maurice Eugene II, and Michael David. Michael was killed in an automobile accident at age 17. Gwen attended Cottey College and graduated from Southwest Missouri State University. She taught school for a few years and is now working with Social Services of Missouri, is married to James Jones, formerly of Plad, and lives in Jefferson City. Eugene graduated from Southwest Missouri State University, is married to the former Denise Taylor of Texas, holds a managerial position as designing engineer with Rubbermaid in Cleburn, Texas, and has four children: Shannon Kay, Michael Joseph, Amanda Susan, and Nicholas Eugene.\n\nThe Maces enjoy horseback and trail riding and like to travel.

She mostly talked in a dialect similar to that of the people of the Southern Appalachians, where her forefathers had lived, and was very interesting to talk with. Roy did many kind deeds for his family and friends unbeknown to others.\n\nRead the book, \"Looking Back With an Old Timer\" by Roy G. Mansfield as told to E.V. York. This is a very interesting and true story of the Mansfield family and Ahart family.\n\nCAPTAIN ROBERT MELVILLE MARSHALL\n\nPlease see article under Transportation, Steamboating\n\nGEORGE MONROE MARTIN\n\nBy Gerard Schultz, 1933\n\nGeorge Monroe Martin, editor and publisher of the Iberia Sentinel, was born at Tavern, Maries County, Missouri, December 5, 1889, a son of James Oliver Martin and Margaret (Rowden) Martin, both of whom were born near Vienna, Missouri, and whose ancestors were native Missourians.\n\nMr. Martin received his education in the public schools of Maries County and the Iberia Academy.

His experience in the journalistic field covers a period of 20 years, having been editor and publisher of the Iberia Sentinel since 1913.

MARTIN FAMILY AND JESSIE LEE PAYNE\n\nBy Jessie Lee Payne, 1981\n\nJohn Wesley Martin and Lennie Wyrick, both native Miller Countians, upon marriage in March 1895, moved to Linn Creek in Camden County, remaining there for 30 years. Mr. Martin held a responsible position in the Watson Mercantile stores in Linn Creek, and served for two terms as Camden County Treasurer.\n\nThe nine children of the martins, all born in Camden County, were: Vesta, Eunice, Lesta, Lucy, and Traber, now deceased, and the four living sisters: Bertha, Hester, Jessie and Nadine.\n\nCrossing the Osage River by wagon on the ferry, the family settled in Bagnell in 1924, where Mr. Martin was employed by the A.M. Pope Lumber Co., and served as Justice of the Peace and two term Mayor.

MARTIN FAMILY\n\nBy Jane (Martin) Hurley, 1981\n\nSeigel Thomas and Letty (Vaughan) Martin were Bagnell residents when Bagnell was a river port and the Osage River was an important freight center in their day. Seigel was the son of Thomas Martin and he was an orphan at 12 years old with a 2 year old sister Nancy Jane. Seigel had outlived both his parents and 2 stepmothers by this age. From then on he worked and was responsible for himself, although his sister was given a home by neighbors. These children did have uncles, but Thomas Martin was a Union soldier and his family was Confederates and the Martin children did not have any contact with their relatives even on the death of their parents.\n\nLetty Martin was the daughter of Stephen and Charity Vaughan and her family background included the earliest settlers in the Bagnell area of Miller county.\n\nSeigel and Letty Martin were the parents of Frederick, Riley, Roy, Charlie, Joe and William and 2 sons who died in infancy. They are buried in the Riley Lamm Cemetery near Bagnell. Her parents, 5 sons and several grandchildren are also buried there. All of these people are deceased although some lived into their 80's.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Martin were young children during the Civil War. This obviously was very important for all of their lives. Mr. Martin's family was shattered. Mrs. Martin's family was more united. They faced the death of 2 children in infancy which wasn't uncommon in those days. They were descent and successful; having 6 sons to help make the living was an asset.\n\nMr. Martin worked at different things, among them, farming, as a lumberman making railroad ties, in the Bagnell Tie Yards, helped on building the Rock Island Railroad's Bagnell Spur and various other things during his life.\n\nWILLIAM M. MARTIN FAMILY\n\nBy Jane (Martin) Hurley, 1981\n\nMr. and Mrs. William M. Martin of the Eldon area were natives of the Lake Ozarks area from birth.

He was born and raised near the town of Bagnell, having worked in the Bagnell Tie Yards in the early 1900's. Mr. Martin is buried at the Riley Lamm Cemetery within a mile of his birthplace. Bessie (Upton) Martin was moved to the Aurora Springs area after being displaced by the Lake at an early age. Mr. and Mrs. Martin were young adults when the Dam was built, having been married during the Great Depression. They and their peers faced many hardships because of this.\n\nWilliam Martin's parents were Seigel and Letty (Vaughan) Martin and his ancestors were the earliest settlers of the Bagnell area of Miller County. Bessie Martin's parents were Solomon and Alice (Sconce) Upton and they were displaced from Camden County by the waters of the Lake. William and Bessie Martin are the parents of Norma, Grace, John, Lena, Paul, Jane, Fay and Anna and one son, Roy, died in infancy.\n\nThe Martins spent most of their lives in the Eldon area. Mr. Martin was employed by the Rock Island Railroad and was a farmer. Mrs. Martin worked at Oberman's and Glaser Bros. Manufacturing Companies.\n\nThe Martins lives have spanned unbelievable changes in their native country. Mr. Martin was the first person to ride a horse across Bagnell Dam. Mrs. Martin remembers the first automobile she ever saw, which was a rather short view since she was helping her father control frightened horses.\n\nHERMAN JOHN MAYER\n\nBy Gerard Schultz, 1933\n\nReverend Herman John Mayer, pastor of St. Lawrence Church at St. Elizabeth, was born near Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, September 17, 1887.

His home was near Kaiser, Mo. in part of the area now know as State Park No. 1. Her home where they were married still stands in a tiny valley between the Dogwood Hills Golf Course and the new Lake of the Ozarks General Hospital.\n\nThe first few years of their married life, they lived in Miller and Camden Counties where he was engaged in farming. They were the parents of five children, two boys and three girls.\n\nWhen preparations for and work began on Bagnell Dam, the family moved into \"Old\" Linn Creek and G.B. worked with the surveyors. This was a very interesting but sad time for the families who were having to give up their homes and move on to higher ground. When this family moved from the valley we lived in a little house on top of the hill overlooking the town that was being submerged by the waters of the Lake of the Ozarks. Every evening Mom would take us girls down into the \"ghost town\" to see how much the water had risen. Little by little we watched the waters cover the peaceful little village that had been home to so many for so long.\n\nIt was time once more for this family to move. This time their home was to be on the Old Maupin Farm near Osage Beach, Mo. The Dam Red-E-Mix plant now occupies the spot where the house once stood. While living here Dad worked for the Highway Department and also at the A.M. Pope Lumber Yard in Osage Beach.\n\nWhile living here the three youngest of the family attended school in the little town of \"New\" Linn Creek. It was during these years that the resorts were springing up around the lake area. The boys in the family helped in the construction of many of the first cabin camps in the Turkey Bend and Osage Beach area. The girls worked in the hotels and cafes. During the time we lied here, Elsie worked very hard along with a few others to get the Harper Chapel Methodist Church reorganized and going again.\n\nIn 1938 with two children still at home, Greene and Elsie moved into a little home on a corner of the Roy Mansfield place. The spot is now home to the families of Bob and Don Hoffman.\n\nThis family can truly be called and is proud to be \"natives of the area\". Four of us are still here. Ralph McDowell lives on the old Mansfield place just across the valley from the Lake of the Ozarks General Hospital. Erma (McDowell) Barnes lives in Camdenton.
