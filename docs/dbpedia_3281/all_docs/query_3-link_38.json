        "text": "Vesta Mullen\n\nA tireless worker on behalf of her extended family, church, and school communities, Vesta has entered her well-deserved eternal rest. Having tenaciously fought multiple debilitating conditions, Vesta asked us in the days after her 96th birthday to “Set me free.” That final wish and prayer has been granted.\n\nSince 1966 a resident of Houghton, NY, Vesta was a lifelong Canadian citizen, and citizen in the Kingdom of God. Born of Loyalist, Scots, and Scots-Irish stock on her grandparents’ farm in Maple Ridge, New Brunswick (NB), Vesta was the eldest of three in a preacher’s family. Her earliest memories—up to the age of six—were from a fishing village, Seal Cove, on the island of Grand Manan in the Bay of Fundy. She spent eight formative years in Marysville, NB; and graduated from high school while in Port Maitland, Nova Scotia (NS).\n\nAfter teaching English at Bethany Bible College (NS) and taking on the many roles expected of a pastor’s wife for nine years in Woodstock, NB, Vesta followed husband Laurence to Houghton, NY. At Fillmore Central School for twenty-five years, she was a dedicated teacher and administrator. She found particular satisfaction in directing the Reading Center, where she served as many as one hundred or more elementary students each year. Much earlier, in 1949, Vesta had begun her teaching career in a one-room (grades 1-8) rural schoolhouse near Moncton, NB, and later taught high school English.\n\nVesta’s Christian faith was deep and unwavering—although never facile or glibly expressed. She wrestled with hard questions till the very end. Naturally reserved—her wry sense of humor and astute understanding of human nature often hidden to others—Vesta expressed her deepest beliefs and values through faithful daily living.\n\nIn the Houghton Wesleyan Church, Vesta served (among other roles) on the Board of Elders, taught Sunday School and led adult Bible studies, and supported the denomination’s world missions program. In retirement, she volunteered along with Laurence as a short-term missionary herself, working with teachers and children both in Russia and the Czech Republic. Wherever she saw a need in the church, she was quick to jump in—no role too humble. Wherever she lived, Vesta was also a leader in an eclectic array of community, service, and professional organizations.\n\nUntil covid closed the border in 2020, she spent every summer of her life at Beulah Camp in NB, Canada: attending worship services; conducting genealogical and historical research; tending her perennial garden; and entertaining life-long friends and relatives.\n\nDevoted to home and family, Vesta was a compulsive multi-tasker. Few meals were ever prepared—few conversations ever held—without some professional, writing, or sewing project(s) simultaneously in process. Skilled in many crafts, she was particularly admired as a seamstress, making many of her own—and the family’s—clothes. Toward the end of her life, she rekindled an earlier interest in oil-painting. She was a musician, card-maker, correspondent, and prolific scrap booker. She loved candles, quilts, houseplants, home-made Christmas decorations, English china, and even—for the last third of her life—her computer. Curious about the world, gifted intellectually as well as artistically, Vesta read constantly and widely, especially in the fields of literacy education; children’s literature; the history of Christianity; and the history of the Maritime Provinces.\n\nMarked by her own mother’s early and sudden death—and the accompanying loss of extended family memory—Vesta felt a strong mandate to preserve her family, spiritual, and cultural inheritance as fully as possible for generations yet to come. In retirement, she researched and wrote copiously. Among other projects, she explored the history of the church tradition in which she and Laurence had been raised. Out of this effort came her 433-page magnum opus—The Communion of Saints—a compendium of insightful and historically-contextualized profiles of 143 pastors and missionaries. At one time or another, she self-published at least a dozen additional volumes of memoir or tributes to others.\n\nIn an era when relatively few women in Eastern Canada attended university, both of Vesta’s parents encouraged her to pursue higher education. She graduated from New Brunswick Teachers College and continued her formal education at the University of New Brunswick (Fredericton) and Eastern Nazarene College in Boston, MA—graduating with a BA in English. She earned an MS in literacy education from SUNY-Geneseo.\n\nIn addition to Laurence, her husband of 73 years, and her many friends, Vesta is survived by her four children and their spouses (Shirley & Paul Mills; Barbara & Richard Pointer; Andrew & Jana Mullen; James & Darice Mullen); eight grandchildren (Katie, Kristy, Julie, Phoebe, Frances, Jessica, Victoria, and Jordan); and nine great-grandchildren (Kate, Aaron, Hutch, Barrett, Bernie, Elodie, Lucia, Oliver, and Asher). She is survived as well by two sisters-in-law (Dana Mullen and Ethel Mullen Forbes; a brother-in-law, Alvin Forbes; and numerous nephews and nieces. She was pre-deceased by her parents, Rev. Fraser and Margaret\n\n(Graham) Dunlop; sister Patye (Glenn) McCrea and brother Wayne (Marguerite) Dunlop. Rest in peace, Vesta, thou good and faithful servant. We hope to join you on the other side.\n\nFamily and friends may gather from 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm and from 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm on Thursday, July 18, 2024, at the Kopler-Williams Funeral Home, 21 N Genesee Street, Fillmore. A funeral service will be held on Friday, July 19, 2024, at 2:00 pm in Houghton Wesleyan Church. Rev. Dr. Wesley Oden will officiate. Burial will be in Brown’s Flat Baptist Church Cemetery, Brown’s Flat, New Brunswick, Canada.\n\nAt Vesta’s request, memorial contributions may be made to the Laurence & Vesta Mullen Endowed Scholarship at Houghton University, or to Fillmore Central School. Those who knew her in the Maritimes might contribute to the Heritage Center/Archives at Beulah Camp.\n\nLenore Paige\n\nLenore August Paige of Fancher Heights died on Monday, May 20, 2024 in the Houghton Nursing and Rehabilitation Facility. She was born on September 25, 1930, in Chicago IL, a daughter of the late Benjamin and Regina Weiss August who were Jewish immigrants who fled Poland in the early 1900’s to escape religious persecution.\n\nAt age 8, her father brought her to Seattle where he worked as a tailor and operated a dry-cleaning shop. As a young woman she loved ice-skating, dancing and swimming.\n\nFamily hardships led Lenore to hard work and self-reliance at an early age. She responded to the chaos around her with a drive to order her world. She developed a love of learning, and became the first woman in her family to pursue higher education, graduating from the University of Washington in 1952 with a B.A. in English and later obtaining teaching credentials as well.\n\nShe taught high school for a few years before making a career switch to office work. Her career spanned the rise of the computer age, and Lenore studied to keep up with advancements. She worked on everything from punch-card readers to tape-storage systems to desktop computers.\n\nAfter retiring she continued to learn new operating systems and programs, doing genealogical research, browsing news, and keeping in touch with family up until she was 91. As an office worker, she did everything from typing and scheduling to bookkeeping and property management. She was employed by architects, by an executive of Western International Hotels as his personal assistant, and by a Canadian property-management firm, among others.\n\nIn 1952 Lenore married Gene F. Paige, and they had three children: Russell, Regina, and Terence. They divorced in 1969. Lenore loved to make baked goods for her family, especially bread.\n\nLenore was most proud of her work with the Washington State Board against Discrimination in the late 1950’s and early 1960’s. She helped expose racial discrimination in housing and business.\n\nShe leaves behind two brothers, Gerald August and George August; her three children; and multiple grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n\nLenore’s ex-husband predeceased her in 1983, as did her oldest brother Irving.\n\nBurial will be in Bikur Cholim Cemetery, Seattle, Washington.\n\nBETTY COOK\n\nA memorial service for Betty Cook, former Houghton resident and Houghton University Biology professor, was held on May 4, 2024 at the Warm Beach Senior Community Center, Stanwood, Washington. Here is the bulletin for the service: https://hwchurch.org/…/Betty-Cook-Memorial-Service…\n\nHere is the service: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUsE6PEDjgo\n\nMemorial gifts may be made to the Arnold and Betty Cook Scholarship Endowment Fund, Houghton University, 1 Willard Avenue, Houghton, NY 14744\n\nGrace Taylor\n\nGrace Taylor of 7375 Route 243, Rushford, went home to be with her Lord and Savior on Friday, April 19, 2024 peacefully in her home. She was born on July 30, 1932 in Phillipsburg, NJ, a daughter of the late Thomas and Lulu Ayers Thatcher. On June 16, 1956 in Stockertown, PA she married Edward F. Taylor Jr. who predeceased her on March 25, 1988.\n\nGrace was a member of the Houghton Wesleyan Church and taught Sunday school for over 25 years.\n\nAn avid fan and supporter of the Genesee Rapids, Grace attended every game and enjoyed passing out candy and making desserts for the team. She also was a fan of all types of high school sports.\n\nGrace enjoyed crocheting, knitting, canning and sewing but most of all she loved her family and serving her Savior, Jesus Christ.\n\nSurviving are her children. Ed (Tracy) Taylor and Cindy-Lu Taylor both of Rushford, four grandchildren, Jennifer (Tony) Miranda, Erin (Greg) Taylor, Brett (Misty) Taylor, Robert (Morgan) Taylor, four great-grandchildren, Aliyana Miranda, Enzo Miranda, August Taylor, Remi Taylor, a sister, Sara-Lu Mullen and several nieces and nephews.\n\nIn addition to her husband and parents she was predeceased by an infant son, Robert Taylor.\n\nFamily and friends may gather from 10:00 am to 11:00 am on Tuesday, April 23, 2024 in the Houghton Wesleyan Church where a funeral service will follow at 11:00 am. Rev. Dr. Wesley Oden will officiate. Burial will be in Fairmount Cemetery, Phillipsburg, NJ on Wednesday, April 24, 2024 at 1:00 pm.\n\nFuneral arrangements are under the direction of the Kopler-Williams Funeral Home, 21 N Genesee Street, Fillmore.\n\nCAROLYN Brown Hale\n\nCarolyn Marie Hale of 3122 Zimmer Road, Town of Wirt, went home to be with her Lord and Savior Jesus Christ on Thursday, April 4, 2024, in Wellsville at the Hart Comfort House. She was born on August 7, 1963, in Owosso, Michigan, a daughter of Robert and Carol Thomas Brown. On November 27, 1982, she married Andrew Wayne Hale who passed on March 31, 2022.\n\nCarolyn was the Executive Secretary to President Lewis at Houghton College and throughout the years held other various positions. She earned a Bachelor of Science from Houghton College in 2008 and a Master of Science from Roberts Wesleyan College in 2010. She was a loyal and supportive military wife and mother during her husband’s service in the Air Force from 1982-2001.\n\nShe was a devote Christian, actively participating in her church and small group. She had a large following on Facebook where she often shared her testimony and her continued faith throughout her fight against cancer. Most knew her for her cheeky coffee memes and inspiring posts. Seeing her witness and testimony for Jesus was an encouragement to many.\n\nCarolyn was an avid camper, loved hunting, anything NASCAR, gardening, and the beach. She was often known for her independence and ability to tackle difficult challenges such as caring for her husband during his battle with ALS and after his passing running a successful Air B&B on their large property in Friendship. It wasn’t uncommon for Carolyn to pack up her camper and head out to various campgrounds in NY and PA with her Labrador retriever, Kimber to spend quality time with family and friends.\n\nCarolyn was a lifetime member of the VFW Auxiliary in Cuba, a member of the Erin Church of the Nazarene in Erin, TN and attended the North Park Wesleyan Church in Cuba.\n\nSurviving are her four daughters, Nicole (Andrew) DeMersman of Henrietta, Elise (Lorin) Hinson of Erin, TN, Aubrey (Matthew) Tranter of Brighton, MI, Lauren (Jake) Anderson of Richmond, VA, six grandchildren, Isabella and Adelyn Hinson, Blake Andrew and Charlotte Tranter, Andrew Jacob and Chole Anderson, her mother Carol Brown, siblings, Sandra Christie (Bill) Warnken, Jennifer (Ron) Nesbitt, and several nieces and nephews.\n\nShe was predeceased by her husband, Andrew Wayne Hale, her father Robert Brown, and brother, Robert (Bob) Brown, Jr.\n\nFamily and friends may gather from 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm and from 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm on Friday, April 12, 2024, at the Kopler-Williams Funeral Home, 21 N Genesee Street, Fillmore.

She was born on January 12, 1925, in Jersey City, NJ, and raised during the “Great Depression.” Though from an uneducated family, she studied and worked hard to graduate from college and nursing school — earning both Bachelor of Science and RN degrees by the young age of 20.\n\nShe married her childhood friend, Gustave Prinsell, on July 27, 1946, in Jersey City. Together with physician husband Gustave, she devoted the early part of her career as a nurse in medical missions at the Kamakwie Wesleyan Hospital in Sierra Leone, West Africa (1957-1964). Her “second career” included volunteer: leadership of the Wesleyan Medical Fellowship for sixteen years as newsletter editor and primary fund-raiser to sponsor Christian missionaries; service to the Houghton Wesleyan Church and community; and spiritual mentoring of Houghton University students, some of whom thought of her as their “2nd mom.” Gustave and Louise were voted by the students as “Grand Marshals” of the 2009 Houghton University Homecoming festivities.\n\nLouise was also a loving wife, mother, and grandmother who instilled strong Christian and family values. She was very giving and caring, always positive and uplifting, with a friendly outgoing personality, witty sense of humor, and radiant cheerful smile — admired and loved by those who knew her. “The Papa Bear,” an autobiography by her late husband Gustave published in 2017, tells more of their strong marriage, personal experiences, friendships, devout Christian faith, and deep love of family.\n\nLouise is survived by: four sons, Jonathan (Dawn) in Orlando, FL, James (Britta) in Plano, TX, Jeffrey (Kim) in Marietta, GA, and Joel (Jill) in Orlando, FL; seven grandchildren, Jeffrey Jr (Jenny) and Eric (Whitney) in Marietta, Michael (Lisa) in Galesburg, IL, Jonathan Jr (Alisha) in Cambridge, ON, and Joy (Chandler) Brothers, Grace, and David, all in Orlando; and seven great-grandchildren, Logan, Landon, Luke, Mary Katherine and Liam, all in Marietta, Caleb in Cambridge, and Juliette in Galesburg. She is predeceased by her only sibling, Charles Bininger Jr, and her beloved husband of 75 years, Gustave, who died on July 13, 2022, at 100 years old.\n\nA visitation will be held at the Kopler-Williams Funeral Home, North Genesee Street, Fillmore on Friday, April 5, 2024, from 2:00 to 6:00 pm. A funeral service will be held at the Houghton Wesleyan Church on Saturday, April 6, 2024, will begin at 1:00 pm, followed by the burial at Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Houghton.\n\nIn lieu of flowers or other remembrances, the family respectfully requests and deeply appreciates that memorials, if desired, be made to the “Dr. Gustave and Louise Prinsell Scholarship” at Houghton University, One Willard Avenue, Houghton, NY 14744; (585) 567-9340. Here is the link to her service. Here is the funeral bulletin.\n\nTimothy Fuller\n\nIn loving memory of Timothy Richard Fuller, his family shares with deep sadness his peaceful passing in his sleep, likely from a known heart condition, on the morning of June 9, 2023. Tim was a beloved husband, father, grandfather, and friend to many. His kindness and gentleness were only exceeded by his faith in Christ and love for his family. All who knew and loved Tim know how much he will be missed as we celebrate the remarkable, devoted, and faithful life he lived.\n\nBorn May 20, 1957, in Syracuse, NY, Tim quickly developed a love for many things that would persist throughout his life, including his family, baseball (particularly the New York Mets), singing, Christian faith, and education. He graduated from Houghton College (now Houghton University) in 1979, attaining a degree in history while also discovering a passion for Christian higher education and meeting the woman he would be married to for nearly 44 years, Carol. Tim and Carol returned to Houghton in 1980 where Tim began his work in admissions and recruitment. He served Houghton students and the campus community for 27 years as a recruiter and Vice President for Enrollment Management, a role in which he developed the skill set to enter into consulting, beginning with Credo Higher Education in 2007 and eventually opening his own successful firm, Fuller Higher Education Solutions, in 2020.\n\nThroughout his career, Tim devoted himself to the success of Christian institutions of higher education, becoming a beloved leader, guide, and friend to many college and university presidents, in organizations like the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities, the National Association of Christian College Admissions Personnel, and the Association for Biblical Higher Education, and with colleagues across North America. His expertise made him sought after the first time; his compassion and sense of humor made him sought after for a lifetime.\n\nAs proud as he was of his career accomplishments, Tim was ever prouder of his family. He loved the team he formed with his beloved Carol, his teammate in life and in managing the Fuller household. He loved his children, Rebecca (Christopher), Daniel (Kristin), and Jonathan (Abby), who with their spouses and families hope to carry on Tim’s legacy of deep care, corny dad jokes, and devotion to their family. Of the many titles he held over the years, his favorite may have been “Grampy”, a role he thrived in as grandfather to Stephen, Ella, Eden, Liliana, Amos, Ruby, and Jackson. You could always find one of them in Grampy’s lap, searching for golf balls with him, or snuggled up while they took selfies together or watched whatever game was on TV. All of his surviving family, including his sister, Marilyn, and brother, Jonathan, cannot fathom life without the bright light Tim provided them.\n\nIn death, Tim is reunited with his cherished parents, Lillian and Richard Fuller, and united for the first time with his eldest brother, Stephen, who died at birth. We also anticipate Tim is already holding down the bass section in a choir singing joyful music and organizing a heavenly fantasy baseball league.\n\nBill Getty\n\nWilliam “Bill” John Getty Jr of 9317 Sand Hill Road went home to be with his Lord and Savior on Tuesday, August 15, 2023 in Buffalo General Hospital. He was born on December 29, 1951 in Buffalo, a son of the late William and Lois Goress Getty Sr.\n\nBill was a member of the Houghton Wesleyan Church and a former HVAC technician for Houghton College. He enjoyed watching trains and spending time with his grandchildren.\n\nSurviving are his children, Lisa Speta of Fillmore, Sara Getty of Blair, NE, William John (Crystal) Getty III of Pittsburg, PA and six grandchildren, Jordan, Jesse, Zachary, Ayden, Harley and Paul.\n\nIn addition to his parents he was predeceased by his brother, Paul David Getty on September 2, 2016.\n\nFamily and friends may gather from 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm on Tuesday, August 22, 2023 at the Houghton Wesleyan Church, 9712 NY-19, Houghton, where a funeral service will follow at 4:00 pm. Rev. Dr. Wesley Oden and Pastor Paul Shea will co-officiate.

Andrews II who predeceased her on March 9, 2017\n\nGladys was always an avid reader and chose to pursue her Bachelor’s Degree in English from Houghton College. Coming from the small town of Painesville, Ohio, and not being sure if she could even afford a college education, she felt incredibly appreciative of her parents’ sacrifices to make it possible for her to attend Houghton College. She continued on to earn her Master’s Degree in Education in Buffalo, NY. Gladys worked as an elementary school teacher while supporting John’s dream of obtaining his PhD from MIT. During this time they began their family and Gladys gave up teaching to become a full time homemaker and a most nurturing and devoted mother to her four children.\n\nThe family moved several times over the years due to John’s career. John was an adventure and travel enthusiast which became a big part of the family’s lives. While visiting China in 1986, John and Gladys found out by telephone that they’d be new grandparents. Gladys’ voice was full of joy with the news. She loved and adored her grandchildren and was always eager to spend time with them and care for them. Gladys was dearly loved and a great blessing to her friends and family.\n\nAs a strong believer and seeker of God’s Truth, Gladys would always find a family church and bible study to attend wherever their current home was. Eventually they settled between two homes, one in Watchung, NJ and the other in Houghton, NY where Gladys felt blessed to be a part of the Women’s Bible Study group. Throughout her life, she spoke fondly of her precious Houghton memories as this was the place where she’d felt most at peace and at home.\n\nSurviving are three children, David Andrews of Sacramento, CA, Carolyn McKeon of Basking Ridge, NJ, and James Andrews of Vine Grove, KY; eight grandchildren; and two great grandchildren.\n\nIn addition to her parents and her husband of 58 years she was predeceased by a baby sister at birth, and her son, John M.

Evangeline and Harold celebrated their 70th year of marriage in June.\n\nBesides his immediate family, he is survived by his sisters, Jane Dempster, Norma Curtis, and Dorothy Grant, as well as multiple beloved nieces and nephews, many of whom considered him their father figure.\n\nThough not able to finish his education after the 8th grade as he left to help contribute to his large family, Harold made sure that his children would be afforded the opportunity to attend college by coming here to work for Houghton College. All five of his children had that educational opportunity.\n\nEarly in his career, he worked as a lumberjack until he found an apprenticeship as a print maker and linotype operator, first in the Syracuse Publishing House in Syracuse then as a printer for the New Milford Times in New Milford, Connecticut before getting an opportunity to come to Houghton College, where he worked from 1964-1994 in the College Press as a linotype operator and later as the Quick Print operator.

Twice Harold was voted as staff member of the year for the college, once in the 70’s and once in the 90’s, showing his influence over the decades.\n\nHis influence was also felt in the Houghton community, which he was proud to be a part of. He was a lifetime member of the Houghton Volunteer Fire Department, holding positions over the years including captain of the ambulance crew, captain of the snorkel, Assistant Fire Chief, and Fire Chief in the mid- 70’s.\n\nWith his wife, Evangeline, Harold often opened their home to students and young persons in need, who often lived with them for periods of time; he considered them part of his family.

In his later years, he also attended the Genesee Rapids games. He loved fly-fishing in the Catskills and hunting locally; making many jealous of his hunting prowess.\n\nAs New York State Commissioner of Clan Grant for many years, Harold could be seen attending Celtic festivals across the state, discussing his clan history and making friends wherever he went. He was overjoyed when he was able to visit his Clan Grant territory in Scotland twice in his lifetime.\n\nSurviving in addition to his wife are their children David and Molly Wenke Grant of Hawthorne, Florida; Vicki and Earl Grant-White of Houghton, Michael and Donna Hartman Grant of Honeoye, Valerie and Michael Smith of Caneadea, and Rebecca and Larry Griffin of Sterling, Virginia.\n\nHarold was also very enamored of his 19 grandchildren and 29 great grandchildren; often telling them, “Make me proud” whenever he said good-bye to them.

He had a spirit of goodness that could only be gifted by the Holy One. He was our “Zekers”, “Zeke-man”, and “Zeke-in-nator sweet potater”. He loved “shake a leg” to make him smile, video chats, legos and magic tricks with big bro and sis, hangin’ and gamin’ with his bigger big bros, being sung to, doted and loved on by his bigger sisters, “ugga-muggas”, and rockin’ in the “mama chair” gazing up at mom or dad.

She was a longtime resident living independently in Houghton, having relocated from Eastern New York State in 1952, to accept a position on the Houghton College staff.\n\n​Mary was the youngest of four children born to Raymond and Edna (Clark) Boomhower, in Catskill, NY. Her three older brothers, Edmund, and twins, Arthur and Albert “Don” Boomhower, predeceased her, as did her parents. She is survived by sisters-in-law, Marion Boomhower of Los Angeles, and Phyllis Boomhower of Catskill, and by her nephew, Timothy (Melody) Boomhower of Efland, North Carolina. She leaves several grand-nieces and nephews.\n\n​Mary graduated from SUNY Cobleskill with an AA degree in nutrition and worked for the Houghton College food service for the first 25 years. In the late 1970s the college began contracting with outside vendors to provide board plans, and Mary was offered the opportunity to retool and become part of the administrative support staff as a secretary/administrative assistant to several academic departments. With trepidation, she followed that path and flourished.\n\nShe was a loved, respected, and valued member of the college support staff where she served for 45 years, retiring in 1997. In 1998, President Daniel Chamberlain established the Mary Boomhower Staff Excellence Award, which is still given annually from nomination by peers and faculty to one staff member who exemplifies the criteria for which Mary was known: strong work ethic, integrity, willing and loyal spirit, and dedication to serving others.\n\n​Mary had varied hobbies and interests: she was a birder, of sorts, who loved domestic and wild birds and always had a parakeet to keep her company as a lifelong single person. She was known for her exceptional and intricate needlework wall art, widely distributed Christmas batches of homemade peanut brittle, commitment to her women’s Bible study, and her quiet, guileless demeanor.\n\nShe was a devoted parishioner at Houghton Wesleyan Church and continued her lifelong support of her home church, the Full Life [Wesleyan] Church in Catskill. Mary touched many lives in the community by her humble, gracious, kind way of living and loving those in her orbit. The sorrow of her loss gives way to the Blessed Hope by those of shared faith. Her friends call her Blessed for the godly, selfless, and faithful example she has modeled for us.\n\n​She will be buried near her parents in the Catskill Rural Cemetery on Monday, November 8, at 11:00 a.m. Pastor Craig Paczkowski of Full Life Church will officiate the graveside service. Then on Saturday, November 13, at 11:00 a.m. Pastor Wes Oden and the Houghton Wesleyan Church will host a celebration of Mary’s life.

Then from 1968 until 1985 when he retired, he was a probation officer for Cattaraugus County. On occasion, he brought a probationer home while waiting for an appropriate placement to open.\n\nIn 1964, Warren decided to buy a pop-up camper and the family enjoyed many wonderful vacations together. Each summer he would add a new improvement to the camper, and it soon became a deluxe pop-up camper. He enjoyed watching tennis, playing table games, writing, and photography. Warren was also an avid reader, interesting storyteller, and writer. He wrote a short note about each book he read including his reaction to it. He wrote several articles for the local paper and poems about his days in Lebanon. He committed several books of the Bible and long passages to memory, including Romans and Hebrews, following a monthly review plan to keep them fresh in his mind.\n\nHe began running in his 40’s.

He and family were fortunate to share his last days in person and Zoom calls, singing, telling stories, and praying.\n\nDick was born in Plattsburgh, New York on New Year’s Eve 1936 to Homer J. Fero, DDS & Mildred S. Fero. The family moved to Houghton, New York where his father became the Dentist for the community and college there.\n\nAs a teenager, Dick dreamed of becoming a “crack pilot”. Like many family members, he enrolled and began studies at Houghton College. But, he finished his degree in Psychology at Alfred University then joining the US Air Force as a B52 crew member. Still pursing his dream, he left the Air Force for the US Army.\n\nBased in California, he returned to New York on leave, meeting the daughter of his parents’ college friends. Edith & Alvin Densmore, DDS, had known Dick’s parents at Houghton College and now resided in neighboring Perry, New York where “Al” practiced Dentistry. Dick proposed to Annette and the two were married on October 31, 1964 in Mt. Morris with a reception at the Glen Iris Inn in Letchworth State Park.\n\nNext, Dick traveled to Vietnam as a US Army Advisor to the South Vietnamese. The young couple was fortunate to meet in Hawaii for their honeymoon. Upon returning, Dick finally realized his dream to fly completing the US Army’s new helicopter school in Fort Rucker, Alabama. He returned to Vietnam for a second tour.\n\nDick’s US Army Aviation career took him to Savannah, Georgia, Seoul, Korea, and then to Shelbyville, Indiana as the Advisor to the Indiana National Guard. After a brief final assignment at Fort Hood, Texas, Dick retired from the US Army and accepted his next assignment as Personnel Director at W.S. Major Hospital where he spent the next nine years.\n\nIn Shelbyville, Dick began his commitment to community service joining many organizations and became a fervent Rotarian. He took on leadership roles in the Shelbyville community that were sometimes difficult. But Dick stayed focused on doing the right thing for the Shelbyville community. He served many organizations and boards with mission-like commitment, including the Shelby County Public Library & Foundation and Shelbyville Aviation Board. He spent an extremely rewarding 20+ years with the sheltered workshop, Shares Inc., finding work projects for clients and chaperoning annual trips.\n\nDick’s involvement in the community built an inner strength that motivated him to pursue political office, a surprise to some family members. He served as Shelby County Republican Chairman and was then elected to three terms as a City of Shelbyville Common Council Representative. Never deterred by work to meet an objective, Dick walked streets and neighborhoods meeting residents and asking for their vote. Dick truly believed in doing what he felt was right for the City of Shelbyville.\n\nIn 2014, Dick and Anne celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary with family at the Glen Iris Inn in NY. And last year, they moved to a retirement village in Indianapolis.\n\nThree weeks ago, Dick was so pleased to have a long visit with his granddaughter, Ellen Fero, who is a Freshman student-athlete and pursuing a degree in Psychology at Indiana State University.

She also served as Chairman of the Division of History and Political Science for much of that time. She taught and mentored many students, where she was often referred to as a “firm but fair” teacher.

He attended Houghton College and became an Air Cadet in 1942. He graduated in absentia in 1943 after he was called into training for active service in the Army Air Force.\n\nFollowing extensive training as a bombardier he traveled by Liberty ship to Naples, Italy, then by truck to Grotagglie Army Air base in southern Italy. Assigned to the 15th Air Force, 449th Bomb Group, 717th Squadron, he and his crew flew in large formations of four-engine B-24 heavy bombers on 30 missions. Their targets included southern Germany and German-occupied Austria, as well as the Po River valley in northern Italy.

Visitation will take place on Saturday, September 2, 4-7pm at Kopler-Williams Funeral Home in Fillmore, NY. The service will take place at the church on Sunday, September 3, at 2pm at Houghton Wesleyan Church.\n\nMedical missionary and world traveler, Dr. Storer William Emmett, embarked on his final journey Friday, August 25, 2017. Storer, referring to himself as Tody Will, was born on September 9, 1932 in Crystal, Maine, a son of the late Stora and Elva Main Emmett. On September 1, 1956 in Old Town, Maine he married Wilma Monroe, who survives.\n\nWhen he was still a young boy, the family moved to Old Town, Maine where Storer became very active in community and church life. He joined his first church choir at age 13.\n\nHigh school accomplishments included being a track star, playing on the football team (resulting in becoming a champion church supper eater for necessary weight gain), participating as a valued member of the debate club, playing cello in the orchestra, and earning the top academic honor of his high school class. His greatest high school accomplishment, however, was courting his childhood sweetheart and bride to be, Wilma Monroe.\n\nStorer was saved at a young age and felt God’s call to medical missions as a teen. With this focus in mind, he worked toward attending a good medical school and was accepted to Johns Hopkins in 1954 following his bachelor degree work at the University of Maine.\n\nAfter completing advanced training in medicine and surgery, Storer and Wilma, along with their daughter, Bethany, left on their first missionary voyage to work at a mission hospital in Southern Rhodesia during the fall of 1960. Dr. Emmett also served as a medical officer for the government of Southern Rhodesia. Soon after arriving in Rhodesia, Storer was ordained by the Reformed Baptist Alliance of Canada to enhance his opportunities to administer to not only physical needs but also spiritual needs.\n\nThe next missionary voyage took Storer, Wilma, and their four children to Haiti in August 1968. He worked as a doctor and frequently performed emergency surgeries at the Wesleyan hospitals throughout Haiti. His other ministries included traveling and preaching the gospel to churches all over the country.\n\nDr. Emmett journeyed next to Houghton, NY where he spent 13 years as a family practitioner with the Northern Allegany Medical Group. During this time he also served as the physician for Houghton College. Always having a heart for missions, Storer, soon after arriving, established the Houghton Medical and Dental team returning to serve the people of rural Haiti on short term mission trips.\n\nIn 1988, Storer and Wilma, traveled to Sierra Leone on their third missionary journey. Dr. Emmett worked at the Kamakwie Hospital and ministered to the physical and spiritual needs of the people there for three years.\n\nStorer’s final missionary journey as a full time worker for Wesleyan World Missions was to Zambia near Victoria Falls coming almost full circle to where he began his medical mission work.\n\nDuring retirement, Dr. and Mrs. Emmett spent several months at a time serving in Haiti, Zambia, or Sierra Leone as needed. Storer also became the director of the Wesleyan Medical Fellowship to encourage and increase awareness of medical missions. His quarterly newsletters were always highly anticipated and enjoyed. In appreciation of his 16 years as director, the Wesleyan Church presented Dr. and Mrs. Emmett with a trip to Myanmar where he was able to visit and participate in yet another medical clinic for which he was instrumental in founding.\n\nOne of Dr. Emmett’s great loves was gardening. He had a garden and planted a tree everywhere he lived. Storer loved the beauty (despite his color blindness) and creative expression afforded by the hobby. This past summer saw hours of enjoyment of his flower garden at his new and final home in Cooperstown, NY.\n\nSurviving in addition to his wife are their children, Bethany (Bob) Harter, Esther (Will) Slauson, Bill (Sandy) Emmett and Faith (John) Fisk; his grandchildren, Brittany Harter (Ben) Keith, William Slauson, Wesley Slauson, Kendra (Andrew) Emmett-Goldwasser, Rebekah (Philip Tumbaga) Harter, Kira Emmett (Tyler) Logan, Kasey Emmett, Christianna Fisk and Alexi Fisk; great grandchildren Caleb Keith and Seth Keith; nieces Cathy Emmett (Joe) Stewart, Stephanie Emmett (Johann) Paschalis, and nephew Joshua (Angie) Emmett and cousins.\n\nFamily and friends may gather from 4:00 to 7:00 pm on Saturday, September 2, 2017 at the Kopler- Williams Funeral Home, 21 N.
