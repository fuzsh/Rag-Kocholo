        "text": "She was born Vesta Maurine Coward on 26 March 1925 in Detroit, Michigan, the only daughter of Percy A. & Mildred J. (Paterson) Coward. She had three siblings, Thomas, Richard, and James. In 1940 her father was an inspector in an automobile factory (per U.S. census). She attended school in Dearborn, Michigan, including graduating from Fordson High School where she was a member of both the student council and the girl’s field hockey team.\n\nVesta attended Wayne State University (Biographies differ, one stating she graduated, and a second stating she left college prior to completion to serve in the military during WWII, the latter probably being accurate). When the United States military deemed her too young, she became a radio operator with the Royal Canadian Air Force (from 1943 to 1945).\n\nVesta M. Coward married 19 November 1945 to Albert L. Roy, son of Leo A. & Marie Laudia (Geoffroy) Roy. Albert’s father Leo was a Lowell City Councilor and from 1946-1947 Mayor. In the early to mid 1950s Albert and Vesta Roy lived in Lowell, Massachusetts. Vesta worked while Leo attended optometry school. The Lowell Sun newspaper (1983) stated that “she was a special insurance agent, a job which helped finance her husband’s college education.”\n\nBy 1958 Alfred Roy had graduated and was working as an optometrist. They moved to Salem, New Hampshire about 1963. In 1976 she was president of the Optometrists Association Auxiliary.\n\nWhile living Lowell, Vesta was greatly involved in local charitable organizations. She was chosen to be the grand regent of the local chapter of the Catholic Daughters of America and was also president of the Seton Guild. She waited until her children were grown before becoming active in politics.\n\nVesta M. Roy was Salem New Hampshire’s supervisor of checklists, and served on the town’s Board of Selectmen (apparently only in 1977 as that is the only year she is shown pictured in the town report). Note: Vesta M. Roy was not the first woman selectman of Salem. Bessie M. Morrison (Mrs. Henry) became Salem NH’s first woman selectman in 1969.\n\nAfter serving as the first woman Rockingham County Commissioner, she became a state representative for Salem. In 1976 she was a candidate for the Republican nomination for governor’s councilor, District 3 (she lost that one-time Executive Council attempt to Dudley Dudley). She served as a state senator for four terms (1979-1986) and in 1982 was the first woman president of the Senate.\n\nAn article in the 2 December 1982 Springfield Union newspaper noted another first–that “over the past two days, New Hampshire has had three governors. Former Senate President Robert Monier, R-Goffstown was acting governor until midnight Tuesday when his term expired. Secretary of State William Gardner then became acting governor and presided over a meeting of the five-member Executive Council. His term lasted about 15 hours until [Vesta] Roy was elected Senate president [on December 1, 1982]. At age 57, she became the first (acting) woman governor of New Hampshire.” The article notes that John Sununu “who was standing outside in the hall…lobbied heavily [for her selection as Senate President].”\n\nHer political philosophy was quoted in one of her political advertisements: “fiscally conservative, but a moderate when we consider social service issues.” (i.e. she supported programs developed in communities with private support instead of relying on state and federal funding).\n\nShe had many other non-elected political jobs. In 1976 Vesta was also a delegate to the National Republican convention. In 1977 Vesta was co-chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Committee, and also she was chairman of the NH State Dinner to highlight the National Republican Governors Conference at Mt. Washington. She also served as a campaign advisor to Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, and George H. W. Bush during their presidential campaigns.\n\n-New Hampshire Woman Firsts-\n\n. First Woman Rockingham County Commissioner\n\n. First NH Woman Senate President (1982-1986)\n\n. First NH Woman Governor (acting), never sworn in. [1]\n\n[1]For a period of weeks, Roy served as the first woman acting governor after the illness, then death of Democratic Gov. Hugh Gallen, who had lost his re-election bid to John Sununu. “Acting governor” is a constitutional position created for the case when a governor dies in office or resigns. In New Hampshire the President of the Senate is the designee. Traditionally acting governors largely refrain from exercising most gubernatorial powers other than for routine items or those required because of some emergency. As acting governor, Vesta Roy proclaimed “a state of mourning” for Gallen, that continued until January 5, 1983–the date he would have stepped down as Governor.\n\n=====PARTIAL GENEALOGY OF VESTA M.
