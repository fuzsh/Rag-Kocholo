        "text": "Julia Ann McCarthy was born May 19, 1895 in Oswego, Oswego County, New York,\n\nthe middle child of Mr. and Mrs. George McCarthy. On September 15, 1900, Julia and her\n\ntwo sisters, Florence and Georgia were placed in the Oswego Orphanage Asylum by order\n\nof a F. Farrar of New Haven Township, Oswego County, New York. Julia stayed in the\n\norphanage until March 29, 1902 when she was listed as being discharged from the Oswego Orphanage Asylum, record does not say into whose care she was discharged into.\n\nBetween 1902 - 1903, Julia was adopted by Frank and Stella Tollerton Smart, of\n\nDaysville, Richland Township, Oswego County, New York, at that time her name was\n\nchanged to Vesta Lucretia Smart. In photographs taken by Stella around the time of\n\nthe adoption, Vesta always looked sad and lonely. She used to tell stories about her\n\nchildhood to her grandchildren, we were told that she was abused when she was at the\n\norphanage, being hit, beaten and on one occasion, being thrown down a flight of stairs by\n\nthe Matron at the orphanage.\n\nAlthough Vesta knew her biological father, George McCarthy, was still living in the area\n\nin Mexico, Oswego County, New York, and had even seen him walking down the street\n\non one occasion, they never spoke to one another and never saw each other the rest of\n\ntheir lives. George McCarthy died in Mexico, New York on October 10, 1930, he is\n\nburied in Daysville Cemetery, the same cemetery Vesta is buried in.\n\nBeing a baby of under 3 years of age, her sister Georgia McCarthy was adopted right\n\naway, adoption date being November 14, 1900, adopted by an unknown family. Vesta\n\nnever saw her baby sister again. Florence McCarthy was discharged from the orphanage\n\nthe day before Vesta, but orphanage papers do not tell whose care she was discharged\n\ninto. Florence McCarthy married a man by the name of Jack Buckley and they lived in the\n\ncity of Oswego, New York and owned a bar or a restaurant there. Although Vesta knew\n\nof her sisters whereabouts, she always told her Grandchildren that, by orders of her\n\nhusband, George Cates, she was not allowed to see her sister because of the kind of\n\nbusiness Florence and Jack were running. Family information on Florence McCarthy\n\nBuckley is not known.\n\nVesta grew up to be a lovely young lady, and caught the eye of a man 3 years her junior.\n\nGeorge Frederick Cates was from the Mexico, New York area, it is not known exactly\n\nhow they met, but love letters that started in 1916 between the couple were found by their youngest Granddaughter in their home in 1997, give some clues to their courtship. George and Vesta were married at her parents home in Daysville on October 09, 1917. In 1921 a daughter was born to them, an only child, Florence Stella Cates, she was named for Vestas sister Florence McCarthy, and her adoptive mother, Stella Tollerton Smart.\n\nVestas adoptive father, Frank Smart, died May 26, 1923 of a heart attack in Syracuse,\n\nNew York while selling his poultry at the Farmers Market with his son-in-law, George\n\nCates. Stella Tollerton Smart married a very short time later, November 28, 1923, to her\n\nnext door neighbor, William Duncan Hardie, a 68 year old widower. Stella moved into\n\nWilliams house and it was there, after his death on August 31, 1933, that George, Vesta\n\nand daughter Florence moved to in 1934, to be able to take care of her ailing mother.\n\nGeorge and Vesta worked the farm started by William Hardie, and by 1936 they opened a\n\nsmall grocery store that included a Texaco gas station. Florence was married on May 15,\n\n1938, her 17th birthday, to Clarence Pete Litts.\n\nThrough out Vestas diary, she refers to herself as having heart attacks, when she was 80 years of age, her heart was checked and she had only expected damage for a person of her age. She was however diagnosed as having epilepsy, a form of which, the doctor explained, could have caused her to feel like she was having a heart attack. Vesta died at home at the age of 85 years, on November 19, 1980, just 5 months and 15 days after her husband George had died of prostate cancer.\n\nLove Letters of\n\nVesta Lucretia Smart & George Frederick Cates\n\nSpelling has not been corrected from the way it was written.\n\nDear Vesta, Mexico, New York - July 6, 1916\n\nThot I'd take up some of my spare time in writing. Hope you had a good time the\n\nfourth. I would have like to went with you but I just couldn't. But I did get around to go\n\nto the lake a few minutes. My folks got home the fourth at night had a good time they\n\nsaid.\n\nI will try and be over Sunday evening if it is alright with you. Don't believe I can\n\nget away Saturday evening because we are busy haying it and it is late when we get thru\n\nchores. Believe me I'll be glad when haying time is over, then we can take in the picnics\n\nand shows. Well guess this will be all for this time. Write. Tom Cats as Guy told you, or\n\nfor short, Geo. C Mexico, NY R. D. 2 P. S. It is 9:30 or I would write more and I am tired and sleepy. Will try and do more next time.\n\nDear George, Pulaski, New York July 10, 1916\n\nI received your letter Saturday - so I will write a few lines in reply.\n\nWe had a lovely time the fourth. We left home at eight and joined some friends in\n\nPulaski. We went straight to Adams and the crowd there was immense. We then went to\n\nHenderson Harbor where we ate dinner. It is just lovely there. We drove along beside the\n\nwater for a long way. The roads were fine, state roads all the way.\n\nClaude Calkins and his family and John Manwarren and family and ourselves made\n\nquite a picnic party. From there we went up to Sackett's Harbor and saw the parade, some\n\nsoldiers, sailors and the campfire girls. And a number of clowns in costume, it was a pretty\n\nsight. We left there and went back thru Watertown, there was a ball game there and a\n\nballoon ascention but it was over on some fairground and we didn't bother to look it up.\n\nWe went on thru to Adams and watched a ball game between Adams and Oswego.\n\nPapa and Florence and I went down to the field together to see it.\n\nWe then went up to the home of an uncle of papa's and ate supper and left for\n\nhome at 7:30, got here at nine with no accidents at all. I thot we had quite a trip and a\n\nvery good time.\n\nWe didn't go to Pulaski Friday evening, went to Mexico shopping instead. I guess\n\nwe are going to Pulaski this Friday evening as mother has invited a friend to go with us.\n\nWell I guess I will close and go to work as I have plenty to do. We will begin\n\nhaying this week I think. I suppose you have yours nearly done.\n\nWell I must say good-bye this time. Vesta\n\nDear Vesta, Sauk City, Wisconsin - September 28, 1916\n\nThot I drop a line to let you know that we were getting closer to Montana. We are\n\nabout 300 miles from St. Paul, Minnesota. We had one blow out today about 12 o'clock,\n\ngot it fixed and run about 5 miles and got stuck in the mud. Car dropped down into a rut\n\nin to the axle and had to get a team to draw us out. It has rained here in Wisconsin for\n\nfour days straight and is raining out now. The roads are something fierce. The soil is black\n\nas coal and slippery as ice.\n\nDown in Ohio it was so dry that dust was about 3 in. deep all over. We have a tent\n\nso we keep dry and warm. We see lots of cattle thru here and a few sheep. Will see more\n\nsheep and horses as we get west farther.\n\nWish you were along to see the country, would have some fun. I'll bet the lady in\n\nthe telephone office is glad that I have gone so that she won't have to ring 12872 so much.\n\nWe have traveled about all day and have gone only about 46 miles. Went 100 miles\n\nyesterday thru mud almost to the hub. I had to shovel the car out of the mud last night.\n\nWe get stuck about every day. Roads were good till we got to Chicago. But we sure get it\n\nnow. Haven't struck very much Parrie land yet.\n\nWe all enjoy the country although it is muddy. Don't see any state roads thru this\n\ncountry. Guess this will be all this time.\n\nWrite to George Cates Edwards, Montana Care of W. Cates\n\nP. S. I will be there before I get your answer.\n\nDear Vesta, Edwards, Montana - October 12, 1916\n\nWe have at last reached Edwards, Montana and I thot I would drop you a letter to\n\nlet you know that I had not forgotten you. Received your letter and was sure surprised to\n\nhear of some of the news that were on those clippings.\n\nWe got here Tuesday Oct. 10 and I have beginning living a western life. We are\n\nonly 50 miles from a railroad or telephone lines and the only thing you can see around here\n\nis sage brush, buttes (or small mountains) and once in a while a sod shanty. See quite a lot of game such as coyote, jack rabbit and antelope. I haven't been out a hunting yet, but am going before long.\n\nWe had a fine trip up here, camped every night and cooked our own meals most of\n\nthe time. We run out of gas only once and that was in the eastern part of Montana. I\n\nwalked six miles to town after two gallons of gas that time. People around here don't think\n\nnothing of walking ten or twelve miles, but believe me when I walked to town and back\n\nafter that gas, 12 Mi. I was ready to sit in the car and ride. My limbs haven't got thru\n\naching yet.\n\nWe get our mail here twice a week so that isn't so bad. They most always go to\n\ntown saddle horse after the mail. The post office is only about three miles from here so it\n\ndon't take long to mail a letter.\n\nHave you saw Guy lately. Tell him when you see him that he had better come up\n\nto this country where he can learn to ride broncs and shoot coyotes.\n\nWell guess I will have to quit writing because it bed time 9:45. Write and tell the\n\nnews.\n\nGeorge Cates Edwards, Montana P. S. Excuse all the mistakes because I have wrote\n\nin a hurry. Will try and do better next time. Tell your father he ought to get his potatoes in\n\nNorth Dakota where they are only 80 cents a bushel.\n\nDear Vesta, Edwards, Montana - October 29, 1916\n\nReceived your letter today and was glad to hear from you. Also was glad and\n\nthank you at the same time for those clippings that you cut out. Because I do like to hear\n\nabout the old times back there.\n\nYou wanted me to locate Edwards. It is in the eastern part of Montana and 50\n\nmiles north of Sumatra our nearest railroad station. Edwards isn't on the map because it is\n\nto small a place. I am staying with my uncle on his ranch. He has lots of horses so I ride\n\nmost of the time looking the country over. I can see the snowy mountains from here, they\n\nare ninety miles away and are covered with snow year round. As you look at them they\n\nseem to meet the sky.\n\nI haven't been hunting much lately but have seen antelope, coyote and jack rabbits\n\nwhile riding. I shot a few jack rabbits and cotton tails a while back. But I have got lazy\n\nand don't like to pack a gun.\n\nThe coyotes have taken quite a few chickens around here this fall. They go into the\n\nhen houses along towards morning and do there raiding and it is pretty hard to get them in\n\nthe morning around here. Because no one gets up till 8 or 9 o'clock.\n\nA coyote is an animal that is about the size of a small dog and they are grayish\n\ncolor in the winter and ground like color in the summer.\n\nThe people around here are mostly new settlers from all states and are well\n\neducated people. You never see a bum around here. The people are mostly homesteaders\n\nand they run cattle and sheep for a living. They don't raise much crops because there is no market for their product.\n\nThere is a fellow that lives a little ways from here that came into this country four\n\nyears ago a drunken sheepherder without a cent, that is now worth between twenty and\n\ntwenty five thousands dollars. Going some isn't it?\n\nThis country is all right if you have a nice little girl to help you hold down a homestead. But this going out and holding down a homestead three years alone isn't what it's cracked up to be. Well guess I will close and retire.\n\nWrite soon, From a fitful and trusted companion, good night. George Cates\n\nP. S. When I come back in the spring have some good places to go because I am going to\n\ntake father's car and we are going to have one good time, believe me. Oh say, how about\n\nthat trip next fall?\n\nDear Vesta, Edwards, Montana - November 6, 1916\n\nHave got a few minutes to spare so thot I'd drop a few lines to let you know I was still in Montana. I have quit ranching and have gone to working in a store here in\n\nEdwards. I have been here about a week now and I like it first rate. I suppose Clough\n\nmakes his regular trips yet on the road peddling.\n\nWere there many over to that party you were going to have? I would have like to\n\nhave been there to help you have a good time. Did you go out Halloween night and did\n\nanyone molest you people? Out here people like to go to bed like they ought to Halloween\n\nnight because it is so far from one shack to the another that they would be all tired out\n\nbefore they could get to the first shack.\n\nWould like to be out there some Sunday. We could take a ride and have a good\n\nold chat once again but the winter will go quickly and then I may come back to New York\n\nto live. Oh say! Has Edna announced her man and have you heard when she intends to get married. Guess I will come back before long because every one will be married and then my chances will be shot. Don't you think so?\n\nYou wanted me to send down a piece of sage brush, I never thought of it when I\n\nwas out hunting. But I will try and think of it next time and send you a piece.\n\nTell Clough when he comes along that he ought to have his store up here where\n\nthings are double what they are there. The post office is right in the store where I am\n\nworking so I don't worry about going after my mail anymore. Say I could write better if\n\nthey weren't so many people around me. But I guess you can make this out in time if you\n\nstudy hard enough on it.\n\nGood night. Write, Your George Cates Edwards, Montana\n\nDear Vesta, Edwards, Montana - November 23, 1916\n\nReceived your letter yesterday and was glad to hear from you. Wish I were out\n\nthere to help you sing those new songs that you have just got. Believe me it would not\n\ntake us long to learn them because as you know it is easy for me to sing those ragtime\n\nsongs or about our lord. How they can ramble?\n\nIt hasn't rained since I came into Montana and it is pretty dry around here. We had\n\na cold snap about a week ago and it was twenty below zero for about three days. Guess\n\nyou would have to go some to beat that back there in the first part of November wouldn't\n\nyou? I didn't happen to freeze write, but guess I froze my ear a little. But I was tickled I\n\ndidn't freeze any more than that. I slept nights in a printing shop thru the cold snap and it\n\nwas up in the top of it, where I bumped my head on a nail every time I raised up.\n\nIs there any good shows in Pulaski this fall? And have you been to many. I would like to be there to see some good shows for awhile. I haven't seen a show since I cam into Montana, but I have seen lots of other things that are just as interesting as shows.\n\nI am intending now to go to Roundup, Montana after awhile. It is about a hundred\n\nmiles from here and is a mining town.\n\nYou wanted me to tell you the size of Edwards, it has got me, one store, one\n\nblacksmith shop and one printing office. It is a pretty small place but they do lots of\n\nbusiness here.\n\nI think when I come back in the spring that I will farm it at home till I begin to\n\nfarm it for myself and that will be as quick as WE make up our minds.\n\nGuess that there is no more news so will close hoping to hear from you soon.\n\nYours, George Cates Edwards, Montana\n\nP. S. I was sure glad to get those clippings and thank you very much for cutting them out.\n\nDear Vesta, Edwards, Montana - December 6, 1916\n\nDon't know whether it's my turn to write or not but to make sure I am going to\n\nwrite, so here goes.\n\nWe are having a western blizzard out today and I am spending the most of my time\n\nby the fireplace reading, smoking, or whether I am watching the other fellows smoke.\n\nI suppose you had a good time Thanksgiving day. I took in a party at night that is\n\nabout seven miles from here. Another fellow and I rode horseback. I wish you could have\n\nbeen here to rode horseback. It was sure a good sport and we had a good time.\n\nI expect to leave this country and go west about a hundred miles to a place called\n\nRoundup, Montana. This place called Roundup is quite a nice little city so I have heard\n\nand it is a railroad center. So I figure that ought to be quite a swell town or city.\n\nI have been a little sleepy today, guess it is because I got up fifteen minutes early. I\n\ngot up fifteen minutes to eight this morning and I generally get up at eight. But sometimes\n\nit is 8:30 o'clock. People in this country believe in getting up very early or going to bed\n\nvery late.\n\nWish I were back there to take another ride behind our horse Jack wouldn't it seem\n\ngood? Have to call him our horse you know because it probly will be ours. Yours and\n\nmine, if all our plans make good.\n\nWell if you have any new plans let me hear them. Not much news so I will close.\n\nWrite soon. George Cates\n\nP. S. Write to George Cates Roundup, Montana Care of Walter G. Cates\n\nDear Vesta, Roundup, Montana - December 29, 1916\n\nReceived your letter a while back and was glad to hear from you. We got here in\n\nRoundup about a week ago all o.k. and had Christmas dinner at my uncle's place.\n\nI haven't been out hunting lately but think in a few days that I will go over in\n\nmountains after bob cats. The Bow mountains (or foothills to the Rockie's) are only about\n\na mile away and they say they are full of bob cats and jack rabbits. I wish you could go\n\nalong to because it would please me to see a bob cat chase you. Of course I wouldn't let\n\nhim hurt you on a bet you know.\n\nHow is Guy now days and do they like it at Mexico in the store. I think that I\n\nwould rather farm it wouldn't you?\n\nTrains have been eight and nine hours late from the east for quite a while on\n\naccount of the weather. It has been 30 and 32 below zero here for about ten days now and no hopes of it warming up any. Don't suppose you are having such cold weather back\n\nthere?\n\nNew Years night wish I was back there with you, would have some fun. Guess this\n\nis all this pencil will write so good night.\n\nWrite soon, George Cates Roundup, Montana\n\nDear Vesta, Roundup, Montana - January 17, 1917\n\nReceived your letter a short time ago and was glad to hear from you, also pleased\n\nto get the paper clippings. I have been working here in Roundup for about ten days back\n\nand like my work o.k.\n\nHave you been to any shows lately and are they having any good ones? Think\n\nmaybe I will be back between now and spring and then I figure you and I will take in a\n\nfew. And sing a few songs on Sunday nights again.\n\nWe are having good weather here now, no snow on the ground and I haven't saw a\n\ncutter since I came into Montana. I suppose there is good sleighing there.\n\nI saw some people from New York today that came out here since I came and\n\nfrom the way they talk, they like New York better than they do Montana.\n\nI only have to work eight hours a day, begin at eight and quit at five so I have lots\n\nof time to smoke and look the town over. Get up about six in the morning and eat\n\nbreakfast then read a story before I go to work. But just the same I miss my dear little girl\n\nback east and wish I was there to take you for a ride behind Jack. Again getting late.\n\nWrite. Your devoted George Cates\n\nDear Vesta, Mexico, New York - May 22, 1917\n\nEnclosed you will find a bill for your birthday present. I forgot to give it to you\n\nbefore I left Sunday night. Will explain next Sunday night why I didn't buy anything. Am\n\nin a hurry so I will close.\n\nYours, George Cates\n\nDear George, Pulaski, New York - June 29, 1917\n\nWell this looks very much like concert weather doesn't it? Father has gone to see if\n\nhe can find a horse. We went down to Gib Robbins' last night, took the puppy with us.\n\nHe's not as large as his mother.\n\nWould like to have you come over Sunday and take dinner with us, as we are\n\ngoing for an auto ride afterwards. We will have dinner at twelve o'clock sharp so we can\n\nhave a longer time to enjoy a trip. We will expect you unless we hear from you. Be sure\n\nand come early.\n\nFather and I went to Syracuse Tuesday, George went with us. I stayed at Mrs.\n\nBeley's and in the afternoon she took me to the Savoy Theater where we saw Freckles\n\nplayed in the movies. It was certainly great, I enjoyed it so much. There were two others,\n\none a comic play, the other scenery along the Great Lakes to Winnepeg. But Freckles beat\n\nthem all.\n\nWhat have you been doing this week? I've been sewing and I have a lot more piled\n\nahead yet. Don't know when I'll get it done.\n\nNow dear, don't disappoint us - we'll look for you Sunday morning.\n\nGive my regards to your people. Lovingly yours, Vesta\n\nDear Vesta, Clay, New York - August 12, 1917\n\nWell here I am located for a few days or more and have worked the team couple of\n\ndays.\n\nWish you were here today we would go over to Long Branch and buy a few ice\n\ncream stands out if they would trust us and take a boat ride. Suppose you had a good trip\n\nThursday going after your Aunt.\n\nThe old man (or papa) went to the city yesterday with chickens and came back\n\naround where I was working. He said that they wanted teams in Parish on good roads. So\n\nRoy and I are going to put our teams out there if they try to put it on us hard here. It's a\n\ngood job so far but some of the other teamsters say that it is going to be harder later. I\n\ncouldn't think of any news this time so have wrote on 'teaming it'. Our horse Barney has\n\nstood it pretty good so far, his neck isn't quite so sore.\n\nWrite to George Cates Clay, NY R. F. D. Care of Roy Cates\n\nP. S. Better burn this or people will think I never saw a school house. But I have\n\nbecause I go by one everyday I go to work. Ha.\n\nHave to excuse all the mistakes and writing I'll try to do better. My poor old hand\n\nshakes or I could do better now. But if you follow the lines with your glasses and you can\n\nread it maybe.\n\n~ Diary of Vesta Smart Cates ~\n\n1932\n\nJanuary 1, 1932 - Friday, Cloudy with a strong east wind, snowed hard all p.m. turning to\n\nrain late in evening.
