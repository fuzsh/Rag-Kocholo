        "text": "March has traditionally been Women’s History Month. The National Women’s History Alliance has set the theme for 2019 as “Visionary Women: Champions of Peace & Nonviolence.”\n\nThey honor women who have led efforts to end war, violence and injustice, and pioneered the use of nonviolence to change society.” Two New Hampshire women immediately come to my mind.\n\nOur own New Hampshire State Senator, Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) introduced a bill, along with Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R- WV) in October of 2017 called the Women, Peace and Security Act, that was signed into law. Senator Shaheen is the only woman on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The press release announcing this law goes on to say:”We need female representation on the world stage that accurately reflects the makeup of communities directly impacted by violence and armed conflict,” said Shaheen.”\n\nSenator Shaheen was the FIRST woman to be elected (but not to serve) as Governor of New Hampshire, when she did from 1997 to 2003. [The first woman to serve as New Hampshire’s governor, Vesta M. Roy, was acting governor for 7 days, from December 30, 1982 until January 6, 1983, after Governor Hugh Gallen died before his successor, Governor-elect John H. Sununu, could be inaugurated.] Senator Shaheen was born Cynthia Jeanne Bowers, daughter of Ivan & Belle Bowers in St. Charles, Missouri. She has a master’s degree from the University of Mississippi.\n\nThe second woman who comes to mind for peace work is Lucia True Ames Mead (1856-1936). Lucia was an author, lecturer and peace activist. She was born in 1856 in Boscawen, New Hampshire, and married in 1898 to Edwin Doak Mead.\n\nShe died in 1936. Lucia’s entire life was devoted to the international peace movement. She was also a strong proponent of women’s suffrage, and equal rights for all. She was a direct descendant of Robert Ames/Eames of England and Boxford MA whose wife, Rebecca Eames, was accused in 1692 of witchcraft.\n\n—WOMEN IN WARTIME—\n\nIt would seem a far cry from women who supported peace to those who served in war time, yet truly it is not. When the United States entered the World War I conflict, many peaceful women chose to work to support that effort.\n\nFor the past two years I have written extensively on the lives of New Hampshire women during World War I. My theme for 2018 was National Women’s History Month: NH WOMEN & WORLD WAR I. These stories are worth reading for they cover a variety women, from nurses to telephone operators, many firsts in New Hampshire, along with teachers and women at home who did their part.\n\n–OTHER NOTABLE WOMEN–\n\nSince last year’s National Women’s History Month I wrote about many talented and exceptional women who need to be included here:\n\nAshland New Hampshire’s famed Miniaturist Painter: Bertha Loraine (Webster) Starr (1886-1966)\n\nPortsmouth NH Executive Secretary and Named Bridge Honoree: Sarah Mildred Long (1916-2004)\n\nDerry New Hampshire’s Premier Woman Poultry Farmer: Celia (Gardner) Whitney (1895-1974)\n\nClairvoyant and Treasure Hunter of Lebanon, New Hampshire: Nellie M. (Lewis) Titus (1864-1957)\n\nMother of Forensic Science, Legal Medicine Professor, Criminologist, Philanthropist, Bethlehem NH Summer Resident: Frances Glessner Lee (1878-1962)\n\n—UPCOMING STORIES—\n\nI have several stories in the works for 2019 about fascinating women in New Hampshire’s past. Each story is quite time-consuming, for you my readers know I like to “get it right” before I publish.\n\nHoping each of my readers, and especially those who blog, will think of a lovely woman in their lives or past and write about them, or just share a story about them with a friend.\n\nFootnote: The photograph at the very top of the page is my grandmother, Addie (Ryan) Manning holding me (the blog editor) in her arms."
