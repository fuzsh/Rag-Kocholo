        "text": "2012 reasons:\n\n“Received the most nominations. LSSU was surprised at the number of nominations this year for “amazing” and surprised to find that it hadn’t been included on the list in the past. Many nominators mentioned over-use on television when they sent their entries, mentioning “reality” TV, Martha Stewart and Anderson Cooper. It seemed to bother people everywhere, as nominations were sent from around the US and Canada and some from overseas, including Israel, England and Scotland. A Facebook page – “Overuse of the Word Amazing” – threatened to change its title to “Occupy LSSU” if ‘amazing’ escaped banishment this year…\n\n“It’s amazing that you haven’t added that word to your list over the years. Totally, absolutely, really amazing. Not quite astounding, but still amazing.” – Charles Attardi, Astoria, New York\n\n“Although I am extremely happy to no longer hear the word ‘awesome’ used incorrectly and way too often, it appears to me it is quickly being replaced with ‘amazing.’ Pay attention and you will no doubt be amazingly surprised to find that I am right.” – Gregory Scott, Palm Springs, California\n\n“People use ‘amazing’ for anything that is nice or heartwarming. In other words, for things that are not amazing.” – Gitel Hesselberg, Haifa, Israel\n\n“Every talk show uses this word at least two times every five minutes. Hair is not ‘amazing.’ Shoes are not ‘amazing.’ There are any number of adjectives that are far more descriptive. I saw Martha Stewart use the word ‘amazing’ six times in the first five minutes of her television show. Help!” – Martha Waszak, Lansing, Michigan\n\n“Banish it for blatant overuse and incorrect use…to stop my head from exploding.” – Paul Crutchfield, Norwich, Norfolk, United Kingdom\n\n“The word which once aptly described the process of birth is now used to describe such trivial things as toast, or the color of a shirt.” – JP, Comox, British Columbia, Canada\n\n“Anderson Cooper used it three times recently in the opening 45 seconds of his program. My teeth grate, my hackles rise and even my dog is getting annoyed at this senseless overuse. I don’t even like ‘Amazing Grace’ anymore. – Sarah Howley, Kalamazoo, Michigan\n\n“The word has been overused to describe things only slightly better than mundane. I blame Martha Stewart because to her, EVERYTHING is amazing! It has lost its ‘wow factor’ and has reached ‘epic’ proportions of use. It’s gone ‘viral,’ I say! ‘I’m just sayin’!’- Alyce-Mae Alexander, Maitland, Florida\n\n2023 reasons:\n\n“Not everything is amazing; and when you think about it, very little is,” a dissenter explained. “This glorious word should be reserved for that which is dazzling, moving, or awe-inspiring,” to paraphrase another, “like the divine face of a newborn.” Initially banished for misuse, overuse, and uselessness in 2012. Its cyclical return mandates further nixing of the “generic,” “banal and hollow” modifier—a “worn-out adjective from people short on vocabulary.”\n\nFrom the whimsy of “Valleyspeak.” Where it was amusing, this word now appears regularly in print and broadcast: Detroit Free Press, New Yorker, Newsweek, the latter using it to describe a baseball pitcher.\n\nGiven a one-year moratorium in 1984, when the Unicorn Hunters banished it “during which it is to be rehabilitated until it means ‘fear mingled with admiration or reverence; a feeling produced by something majestic.” Many write to tell us there’s no hope and it’s time for “the full banishment.”\n\n“Overused and meaningless.’ My mother was hit by a car.’ Awesome. ‘I just got my college degree.’ Awesome.” — Robert Bron, Pattaya, Chonburi, Thailand\n\n“That a mop, a deodorant or a dating service can be called ‘awesome’ demonstrates the limited vocabularies of the country’s copywriters.” — Tom Brinkmoeller, Orlando, Florida\n\n“The kind of tennis shoes you wear, no matter how cute, don’t fit the majestic design of the word.” — Leila Hill, Damascus, Maryland\n\nI find it preposterous to believe that all these writers are observing truly awesome performances, people or events on such a widespread scale. – Elnora S. Vader, Escanaba, Michigan\n\nOnline publications invite us to “join the conversation,” which is usually more of a scream-fest. Gayle from Cedarville, Michigan wonders if “debate has become too harsh for our delicate sensibilities. Now we are all encouraged to have a ‘conversation,’ and everything will somewhat be magically resolved.”\n\n“Over the past five years or so, this word has been increasingly used by talking heads on radio, television and in political circles to describe every form of verbal communication known to mankind. It has replaced ‘discussion,’ ‘debate,’ ‘chat,’ ‘discourse,’ ‘argument,’ ‘lecture,’ ‘talk’….all of which can provide some context to the nature of the communication. Perhaps the users feel that it is a word that is least likely to offend people, but I consider it to be imprecise language that, over time, dumbs down the art of effective discourse.” – Richard Fry, Marathon, Ontario, Canada\n\n“Used by every media type without exception. No one listens.” – Richard Seitz, Charleston, Illinois\n\n“Have one, start one, engage in one. Enough.” – Fred Rogers, Houston, Texas\n\nWe are invited to “join the conversation if we want to give an opinion. This expression is overused and it is annoying. Thanks for listening, eh.” – Debbie Irwin, Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada\n\nWord-watchers have been calling for the annihilation of this one for several years.\n\n“Used today in reference to widespread destruction or devastation. If you will not banish this word, I ask that its use be ‘decimated’ (reduced by one-tenth).” – Allan Dregseth, Fargo, North Dakota\n\n“I nominate ‘decimate’ as it applies to Man’s and Nature’s destructive fury and the outcome of sporting contests. Decimate simply means a 10% reduction – no more, no less. It may have derived notoriety because the ancient Romans used decimation as a technique for prisoner of war population reduction or an incentive for under-performing battle units. A group of 10 would be assembled and lots drawn. The nine losers would win and the winner would die at the hands of the losers – a variation on the instant lottery game. Perhaps ‘creamed’ or ’emulsified’ should be substituted. – Mark Dobias, Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan\n\n“The word is so overused and misused, people use it when they should be saying ‘annihilate.’ It’s so bad that now there are two definitions, the real one and the one that has taken over like a weed. – Dane, Flowery Branch, Georgia\n\n“‘Decimate’ has been turned upside down. It means ‘to destroy one-tenth,’ but people are using it to mean ‘to destroy nine-tenths.’ – David Welch, Venice, Florida\n\nMore than one nominator says the use of ‘epic’ has become an epic annoyance.\n\n“Cecil B. DeMille movies are epic. Internet fallouts and opinions delivered in caps-lock are not. ‘Epic fail,’ ‘epic win’, ‘epic (noun)’ — it doesn’t matter; it needs to be banished until people recognize that echoing trite, hyperbolic Internet phrases in an effort to look witty or intelligent actually achieves the opposite.” – Kim U., Des Moines, Iowa\n\n“Over-use of the word ‘epic’ has reached epic proportions.” – Tim Blaney, Snoqualmie, Washington\n\n“Anything that this word describes in popular over-usage is rarely ever ‘epic’ in the traditional sense of being heroic, majestic, or just plain awe-inspiring.” – Mel F., Dallas, Texas\n\n“Standards for using ‘epic’ are so low, even ‘awesome’ is embarrassed.” – Mike of Kettering, Ohio\n\n“I’m sure that when the history books are written or updated and stories have been passed through the generations, the epic powder on the slopes during your last ski trip or your participation in last night’s epic flash mob will probably not be included. This may be the root of this epic problem, but it seems as if during the past two years, any idea that was not successful was considered an ‘epic-fail.’ This includes the PowerPoint presentation you tried to give during this morning’s meeting, but couldn’t because of technical problems. Also, the ice storm of ‘epic proportions’ that is blanketing the east coast this winter sure looks a lot like the storm that happened last winter.” – DV, Seattle, Washington\n\nOne nominator says, “what originally may have been a term for a stockbroker’s default is now abused by today’s youth as virtually any kind of ‘failure.’ Whether it is someone tripping, a car accident, a costumed character scaring the living daylights out a kid, or just a poor choice in fashion, these people drive me crazy thinking that anything that is a mistake is a ‘fail.’ They fail proper language!”\n\n“Fail is not a noun. It is not an adjective. It is a verb. If this word is not banned, then this entire word banishment system is full of FAIL. (Now doesn’t that just sound silly?)” – Daniel of Carrollton, Georgia\n\n“When FAILblog.org went up, it was a funny way to view videos of unfortunate people in unfortunate situations. The word fail is now used by people, very often just to tease others, when they ‘FAIL.’ Any time you screw up in life — a trip up the stairs, a bump into a wall, or a Freudian slip, you get that word thrown in your face.” – Tyler Lynch, Washington, Iowa\n\n“Misused. Overused. Used with complete disregard to the ‘epic’ weight of the word. Silence obnoxious reality TV personalities and sullen, anti-establishment teenagers everywhere by banishing this word.” – Natalie of Burlington, Ontario, Canada\n\n“It has taken over blogs, photo captions, ‘status’ comments. Anytime someone does something less than perfect, we have to read ‘FAIL!’ The word has failed us all.” – Aaron Yunker, Ishpeming, Michigan\n\nAs one might expect, this phrase received the most nominations this year. If Congress acts to keep the country from tumbling over the cliff, LSSU believes this banishment should get some of the credit.\n\n“You can’t turn on the news without hearing this. I’m equally worried about the River of Debt and Mountain of Despair.”- Christopher Loiselle, Midland, Michigan\n\n“(We’ve) lost sight of the metaphor and started to think it’s a real place, like with the headline, ‘Obama, Boehner meeting on fiscal cliff’.” – Barry Cochran, Portland, Oregon\n\n“Tends to be used however the speaker wishes to use it, as in falling off the fiscal cliff, climbing the fiscal cliff, challenged by the fiscal cliff, etc. Just once, I would like to hear it referred to as a financial crisis.” – Barbara Cliff, Johnstown, Pennsylvania\n\n“Continually referred to as ‘the so-called fiscal cliff,’ followed by a definition. How many times do we need to hear ‘fiscal cliff,’ let alone its definition? Please let this phrase fall off of a real cliff!” – Randal Baker, Seabeck, Washington\n\n“Fiscal cliff, fiscal update, fiscal austerity…whatever happened to ‘economic’ updates? Fiscal has to go.” – Dawn Farrell-Taylor, Ontario, Canada\n\n“Makes me want to throw someone over a real cliff,” – Donna, Johnstown, New York\n\n“If only those who utter these words would take a giant leap off of it.” – Joann Eschenburg, Clinton Twp., Michigan\n\nThe ubiquitous ‘Green’ and all of its variables, such as ‘going green,’ ‘building green,’ ‘greening,’ ‘green technology,’ ‘green solutions’ and more, drew the most attention from those who sent in nominations this year.\n\n“This phrase makes me go green every time I hear it.” – Danielle Brunin, Lawrence, Kansas\n\n“I’m all for being environmentally responsible, but this ‘green’ needs to be nipped in the bud.” – Valerie Gilson, Gales Ferry, Connecticut\n\n“Companies are less ‘green’ than ever, advertising the fact they are ‘green.’ Is anyone buying this nonsense?” – Mark Etchason, Denver, Colorado\n\n“If something is good for the environment, just say so. As Kermit would say, ‘It isn’t easy being green.’” – Kevin Sherlock, Hiawatha, Iowa\n\n“If I see one more corporation declare itself ‘green,’ I’m going to start burning tires in my backyard.” – Ed Hardiman, Bristow, Virginia\n\n“This spawned ‘green solutions,’ ‘green technology,’ and the horrible use of the word as a verb, as in, ‘We really need to think about greening our office.’” – Mike McDermott, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n\n“‘A phrase used to defuse any ill feelings caused by a preceded remark,’ according to the Urban Dictionary. Do we really need a qualifier at the end of every sentence? People feel uncomfortable with a comment that was made and then ‘just sayin” comes rolling off the tongue? It really doesn’t change what was said, I’m just sayin’.” – Becky of Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan\n\n“I’m just sayin’…’I’m not sayin”’…Actually, you ARE saying…A watered-down version of what I just said or intended to say….SAY what you are saying. DON’T SAY what you aren’t saying.” – Julio Appling, Vancouver, Washington\n\n“Obviously you are saying it…you just said it!” – Catherine Wilson, Granger, Indiana\n\n“And we would never have known if you hadn’t told us.” – Bob Forrest, Tempe, Arizona\n\n“When a 24-hour news network had the misguided notion to brand this phrase as a commentary segment called, ‘Just sayin’, I thought I was going to retch.” – Casey Conroy, Pleasant Hill, California\n\nNominations concerning the economy started rolling in as the 2009 list was being put together last year, i.e. “bailout.” They kept coming this year, in these trouble economic times. ” South Park ” warned us about what would happen if we angered The Economy.\n\n“Overused and redundant. Aren’t ALL times ‘these economic times’?” — Barb Stutesman, Three Rivers, Michigan\n\n“In this economy, we can’t afford to be wasteful … In this economy, we all need some security … In this economy, frogs could start falling from the sky … In this economy, blah blah blah … Overused for everything from trying to market products as inexpensive to simply explaining any and all behavior during the recession.” – Mark, Milwaukee, Wisconsin\n\n“When someone prefaces a statement with ‘in this economic climate,’ its starts to sound like a sales pitch, or just an excuse on which to blame every problem. And if a letter or e-mail message from your employer starts with this phrase, usually it means you’re not getting a raise this year.” – Dominic, Seattle, Washington\n\n2008 reasons:\n\n“This pointless phrase, uttered initially by athletes on the losing side of a contest, is making its way into general use. It accomplishes the dual feat of adding nothing to the conversation while also being phonetically and thematically redundant.” – Jeffrey Skrenes, St. Paul, Minnesota\n\n“It means absolutely nothing and is mostly a cop out or a way to avoid answering a question in a way that might require genuine thought or insight. Listen to an interview with some coach or athlete in big-time sports and you’ll inevitably hear it.” – Doug Compo, Brimley, Michigan\n\n“It seems to be everywhere and pervade every section of any newspaper I read. It reminds me of ‘Who is John Galt?’ from ‘Atlas Shrugged.’ It implies an acceptance of the status quo regardless of the circumstances. But it is what it is.” – Erik Pauna, Mondovi, Wisconsin\n\n“Only Yogi Berra should be allowed to utter such a circumlocution.” – Jerry Holloway, Belcamp, Maryland\n\n“This is migrating from primetime ‘reality television’ and embedding itself into otherwise articulate persons’ vocabularies. Of course it is what it is … Otherwise, it wouldn’t be what it would have been!” – Steve Olsen, Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada\n\n2023 reasons:\n\nBanished in 2008 for overuse, misuse, and uselessness: “pointless,” “cop-out,” “Only Yogi Berra should be allowed to utter such a circumlocution.” Its resurgence prompted these insights: “Well, duh.” “No kidding.” “Of course it is what it is! What else would it be? It would be weird if it wasn’t what it wasn’t.” “Tautology.” “Adds no value.” “Verbal crutch.” “Excuse not to deal with reality or accept responsibility.” “Dismissive, borderline rude.”\n\n“It implies supernatural powers — such as the ability to change the weather or levitate. Most new jobs pay less than the lost jobs to ensure stratospheric CEO compensation and nice returns on investments. I respectfully propose a replacement term that is more accurate — job depleters.” – Mark Dobias, Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan\n\n“One of the most overplayed buzz terms of the 2012 presidential campaign. Apparently ‘lowering unemployment’ doesn’t have the same impact.” – Dennis Ittner, Torrance, California\n\n“Since jobs are only created by demand, consumers are the real job creators.” – Scott Biggerstaff, Redlands, California\n\n“It’s been overused and pigeon-holed into political arguments left, right, and center to the point that I don’t believe it has any real meaning.” – Adam Myers, Cumming, Georgia\n\n“To belong to this tax-proof club, you don’t have to create a single job. All you need to do is be rich. In fact, many people who call themselves ‘job creators’ make their money by laying off people.” – S. Lieberman, Seattle, Washington\n\n“Uttered by every politician who wants to give big tax breaks to rich people and rich businesses …” – Jack Kolars, North Mankato, Minnesota\n\n“If these guys are capitalists, as claimed, they are focused on reducing expenses and maximizing profit. Jobs are a large part of expenses. So, if anything at all, they minimize employment to maximize profits. Up is down, black is white. Job creators are really employment minimizers.” – Bob Fandrich, Fredericksburg, Virginia\n\n““Usually used in politics, this typically means that someone or some group is neglecting its responsibilities. This was seized upon during the current administration and is used as a cliché by all parties … Republicans, Democrats, Independents, Libertarians, Tories, Whigs, Socialists, Communists, Fashionistas …” – Mike Cloran, Cincinnati, Ohio\n\n“I’m surprised it wasn’t on your 2012 list — were you just kicking the, um, phrase down the road to 2013?” – T. Jones, Ann Arbor, Michigan\n\n“I thought that perhaps you weren’t ready to deal with it. You just kicked that can down the road.” – Rebecca Martz, Houston, Texas\n\n“I would definitely like to kick some cans of the human variety every time I hear politicians use this phrase to describe a circumstance that hasn’t gone their way.” – Christine Tomassini, Livonia, Michigan\n\n“Much the same as ‘put on the back burner,’ these two phrases still have heat and are still in the road. Kick this latest phrase down the road.” – Michael F. Raczko, Swanton, Ohio\n\n“I can’t turn on the TV any more without being informed that can-kicking has occurred. What’s wrong with the word ‘postpone’?” – Kathryn, West Chester, Ohio\n\nThe 30-year anniversary of this hilarious 1983 Michael Keaton movie seems to have released some pent-up emotions. It received nearly as many nominations as “selfie” and “twerk” from coast to coast in the U.S. and Canada, mostly from men.\n\n“It was a funny movie in its time, but the phrase should refer only to the film, not to men in the real world. It is an insult to the millions of dads who are the primary caregivers for their children. Would we tolerate calling working women Mrs. Dad?” says Pat, of Chicago, Illinois, who suggests we peruse the website captaindad.org, the manly blog of stay-at-home parenting.\n\n“I am a stay-at-home dad/parent. And if you call me ‘Mr. Mom,’ I will punch you in the throat. – Zachary, East Providence, Rhode Island\n\n“Society is changing and no longer is it odd for a man to take care of his children. Even the Wall Street Journal has declared, “Mr. Mom is dead” (Jan. 22, 2013). I think it is time to banish it.” – Chad, St. Peters, Missouri\n\nThe misuse of this reflexive pronoun has been nominated for more than a decade and was banned in 1990. “Please see Mr. Keating (Lincoln Savings and Loan) or myself for any large unsecured loan that you need,” should be “see Charles Keating Jr. or me.” What’s the dodge behind the overuse of myself? The diminishment of personal responsibility? Avoidance of incrimination by self-indulgence? The 1990 worldwide censure failed miserably. Empirical evidence gathered from the press, radio, television (including S-Span) and eavesdropping suggests that myself is disproportionately displacing me in routine usage. The displacement ration is estimated at 5000:1 and maybe expressed, and recalled, if not entirely misunderstood, as E=mc2. E (big Error) = m (me) c (compromised)2 Although no comparable formula had yet been developed, “yourself” and “himself” are fast following “myself” into the helix of misuse. The reflexive pronoun has become a reflex. It appears to be overused or misused by all those who fear being labeled self-serving. It should be termed the “compromise” pronoun. It may also be termed a “refuge pronoun” for those seeking to avoid personal responsibility and any for of accountability and prosecution.\n\n“Boofy, Weenie and myself saw another flying saucer last night.” Incorrect Use “.” (Ed.: You should check the dictionary for yourself.) – Helen Larson, Creighton, Nebraska\n\nAnd its variations — We received many nominations for this annoying abbreviation that refers to Sept. 11, 2001, the day terrorists attacked and killed thousands in New York, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania.\n\nThose who sent nominations said they were in no way trying to make light of the day’s events, or the subsequent events. Most of them asked if finding a ‘cute’ abbreviation for the day makes the attacks any easier to accept. “Last year, we had Y2K and 24-7. This year, we have 9-11. This new digital language (digitalk?) should be banned no later than 1-1-Y2K-2 … Do we refer to the Chicago Fire as 10-8 because it occurred on Oct. 8, 1871? How about the sinking of the Titanic – it is not called 4-14. A tragic event of such proportion should not be confused with a telephone number. The name will be remembered as long as there are people who can read.” – nominator from Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan.\n\n“I can’t believe people are abbreviating the worst act of war this country has seen since Pearl Harbor. I’ve never heard anybody refer to the attack on Pearl Harbor as Twelve-Seven, or 12-7.” – nominator from Colorado Springs, Colorado. “It was September 11.” — nominator from Ishpeming, Michigan. “It’s overused and sounds ridiculous when used to represent what happened on September 11. – nominator from Madison, Wisconsin. “It’s worse when people play on the ambiguity with ‘911’ in the emergency phone number context.” – nominator from Los Angeles, California.\n\nLSSU got a head start on this one last spring, when it burned a snowman named Mr. Polar Vortex during its 44th annual Snowman Burning.\n\n“Wasn’t it called ‘winter’ just a few years ago? — Dawn Farrell, Kanata, Ont., Canada\n\n“Enough with the over-sensationalized words to describe weather!” — A. Prescott, Oshawa, Ontario, Canada\n\n“I think most, if not all can agree that we would prefer to avoid the polar vortex in the future, both in name and in embodiment.” — Christine Brace, Westminster, Maryland\n\n“What happened to ‘cold snap’? Not descriptive enough?” –Trevor Fenton, Edinburgh, United Kingdom\n\nKenneth Ross of Glastonbury, Connecticut, and Bob Priddy of Jefferson City, Missouri, were among many who saw this storming in last January.\n\n“Less than a week into the new year and it’s the most overused, meaningless word in the media,” said Ross.\n\nPriddy noted that it quickly jumped from the weather forecast to other areas, as he said he knew it would: “Today’s St. Louis Post-Dispatch editorializes about a ‘political vortex.’””\n\nAs being dangerously misleading and over emphatic statements. RETARD means “to gradually make smaller. I know that my daughter’s brain will not get smaller. I also know that with proper stimulation she will be able to learn and to understand much more than we believe possible. Give the mentally handicapped a little help by banishing a very old word which we no longer apply in today’s society. – Christa Buchan of Regina, Sack. Canada. TERMINAL ILLNESS is not “terminal” until the point of death. “Because of a serious illness – the active phrase of which is usually fatal – I am now living with a ‘chronic illness.’ It is being successfully treated but cannot be cured.”\n\n“A friend, as I was recovering, encouraged me to look at words as the symbols they are. He pointed out that until the point of death a disease isn’t terminal but only life threatening. I have found this picture easier to live with. Many people with serious illnesses might help themselves a lot if they could only appreciate how words can affect them.” – E. Delores Dickey, Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada\n\n“People have taken pictures of themselves for almost as long as George Eastman’s company made film and cameras. Suddenly, with the advent of smartphones, snapping a ‘pic’ of one’s own image has acquired a vastly overused term that seems to pop up on almost every form of social media available to us … .A self-snapped picture need not have a name all its own beyond ‘photograph.’ It may only be a matter of time before photos of one’s self and a friend will become ‘dualies.’ LSSU has an almost self-imposed duty to carry out this banishment now.” – Lawrence, Coventry, Connecticut and Ryan, North Andover, Massachusetts\n\n“Named ‘Word of the Year’ by Oxford Dictionary? Give me a break! Ugh, get rid of it.” – Bruce, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada\n\n“Myselfie disparages the word because it’s too selfie-serving. But enough about me, how about yourselfie?” – Lisa, New York, New York\n\n“It’s a lame word. It’s all about me, me, me. Put the smartphone away. Nobody cares about you.” — David, Lake Mills, Wisconsin\n\nDayna of Rochester Hills, Michigan, laments how many people observe “Selfie Sunday” in social media, and Josh of Tucson, Arizona, asks, “Why can’t we have more selflessies?””\n\nSo the word that received the most nominations this year was already banished, but today it is being used differently than it was in 1999, when nominators were saying, “I am SO down with this list!” Nominations came from across the country.\n\n“Currently, it is being overused as the first word in the answer to ANY question. For instance, “How did you learn to play the piano?” Answer: “So my dad was in a classical music club …” – Bob Forrest, Tempe Arizona\n\n“Tune in to any news channel and you’ll hear it. The word serves no purpose in the sentence and to me is like fingernails on a chalkboard. So, I submit the extra, meaningless, and overused word ‘so.’” – Scott Shackleton, Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan\n\n“Politicians, especially, are using this word when asked a question and not answering said question. It is used by all parties in Canada’s Federal election. – Karen Newton, Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada\n\n“Frequently used to begin a sentence, particularly in response to a question, this tiresome and grammatically incorrect replacement for “Like,” or “Um,” is even more irksome … It hurts my ears, every single time I hear it! – Thomas H. Weiss, Mt. Pleasant, Michigan\n\n“So it’s getting really annoying. So can we please put a stop to this?” – David G. Simpson, Laurel, Maryland\n\n“It has become widespread to the point of an epidemic,” said a sickened John from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nOverused by many in conversation, especially teenagers. ‘I am SO not into that.’ ‘That outfit is SO not you.’ “It’s used too much and not in the right context.” – Lissa Sanchioni, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada\n\nA word that has expanded from describing someone who may actually have a stake in a situation or problem, now being overused in business to describe customers and others.\n\n“Often used with ‘engagement.’ If someone is disengaged, they’re not really a stakeholder in the first place. LSSU, please engage your stakeholders by adding this pretentious jargon to your list. – Gwendolyn Barlow, Portland, Oregon\n\nHarley Carter of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, says he has heard it with another word popular in business-speak, “socialize,” which means to spread an idea around to see what others think of it. “We need to socialize this concept with our ‘stakeholders.’”\n\n“Dr. Van Helsing should be the only stake holder,” says Jeff Baenen of Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nnominated by many, including John from Medicine Hat on Lindy Thorsen’s CBC radio show out of Regina, Saskatchewan. “It’s used as a weasel-word, as in, ‘There might be some synergy between our companies,’ instead of ‘We want to make some money off of you.’ It’s one of those words that’s used by salespeople the way a parrot uses profanities – they blather away without a clue as to its meaning.” – Gervase Webb, London, England.\n\n“A favorite of politicians and bureaucrats, and used to make one sound smart. It comes from the Greek sunergos, which means ‘working together.’ Why not just say that? I’ll bet most people using the word can’t define it.” – Ken Marten, Hamtramck, Michigan\n\n“It’s a blanket term used by people so they won’t have to actually articulate their business case in a meaningful way.” – T. Conte, Woodstock, Ontario, Canada\n\nCassidy of Manheim, Pennsylvania said, “All evidence of Miley Cyrus’ VMA performance must be deleted,” but it seems that many had just as much fun as Miley did on stage when they submitted their nominations.\n\n“Let’s just keep with ‘shake yer booty’ — no need to ‘twerk’ it! Hi ho, hi ho, it’s away with twerk we must go.” – Michael, Haslett, Michigan\n\nBob of Tempe, Arizona says he responds, “T’werk,” when asked where he is headed on Monday mornings.\n\n“I twitch when I hear twerk, for to twerk proves one is a jerk — or is at least twitching like a jerk. Twerking has brought us to a new low in our lexicon.” – Lisa, New York, New York\n\n“Time to dance this one off the stage.” – Jim, Flagstaff, Arizona\n\n“The fastest overused word of the 21st century.” – Sean, New London, New Hampshire\n\n“The newest dictionary entry should leave just as quickly.” – Bruce, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada\n\n“Often used to describe the spreading of items on the Internet i.e. ‘The video went viral.’ It is overused. I have no objection to this word’s use as a way to differentiate a (viral) illness from bacterial.” – Jim Cance, Plainwell, Michigan\n\n“This linguistic disease of a term must be quarantined.” – Kuahmel Allah, Los Angeles, California\n\n“Events, photographs, written pieces and even occasional videos that attracted a great deal of attention once were simply highly publicized, repeated in news broadcasts, and talked about for a few days. Now, however, it is no longer enough to give such offerings their 15 minutes of fame, but they must be declared to ‘go viral.’ As a result, any mindless stunt or vapid bit of writing is sent by its creators whirling around the Internet and, once whirled, its creators declare it (trumpets here) ‘viral!’ Enough already! If anything is to be declared worthy enough to ‘go viral,’ clearly it should be the LSSU Banished Words list for 2011!” – Lawrence Mickel, Coventry, Connecticut\n\n“I knew it was time when the 2010 list of banished words appeared in Time magazine’s, ‘That Viral Thing’ column.” – Dave Schaefer, Glenview, Illinois\n\n“I didn’t mind much when ‘viral’ came to mean an under-handed tactic by advertising companies to make their ads look like pop culture. However, now anything that becomes popular on YouTube is suddenly ‘viral.’ I just don’t get it.” – Kevin Wood, Wallacetown, Ontario, Canada\n\n“Every time I see a viral video on CNN or am asked to ‘Let’s go viral with this’ in another lame e-mail forwarded message, it makes me sick.” – Lian Schmidt, Bandon, Oregon\n\n“When this little dyad first came into use at the start of the financial crisis, I thought it was a clever use of parallelism. But it’s simply overused. No ‘serious’ discussion of the crisis can take place without some political figure lamenting the fact that the trouble on Wall Street is affecting ‘folks’ on Main Street.” – Charles Harrison, Aiken, South Carolina\n\n“The recent and continuing financial failings are not limited to ‘Wall Street,’ nor should one paint business, consumers, and small investors as ‘ Main Street .’ Topeka (where I work), and Lawrence (where I live), Kansas, have no named ‘ Main Street .’ How tiresome.” – Kent McAnally, Topeka, Kansas\n\n“I am so tired of hearing about everything affecting ‘ Main Street .’ I know that with the ‘Wall Street’ collapse, the comparison is convenient, but really, let’s find another way to talk about everyman or the middle class, or even, heaven forbid, ‘Joe the Plumber.’” – Stacey, Knoxville, Tennessee\n\n“Stands for ‘You Only Live Once’ and used by wannabe Twitter philosophers who think they’ve uncovered a deep secret of life. Also used as an excuse to do really stupid things, such as streaking at a baseball game with YOLO printed on one’s chest. I only live once, so I’d prefer to be able to do it without ever seeing YOLO again.” – Brendan Cotter, Grosse Pte. Park, Michigan\n\n“Used by teens everywhere to describe an action that is risky or unconventional, yet acceptable because ‘you only live once.’ Who lives more than once?” – P.P., Los Angeles, California\n\n“Just gives people, especially teens, a reason to do stupid things. I find it annoying and I’m pretty sure I’m not alone here.” – Daniel, Hickory, North Carolina\n\n“Only a real yoyo would use the term ‘yolo.’” Sandra McGlew, White Lake, Michigan"
