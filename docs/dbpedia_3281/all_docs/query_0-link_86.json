I am a traditional birthworker, mother, medicine woman, forest farmer, student midwife, and birth photographer. I am dedicated to providing and teaching true informed consent, advocacy, and genuine autonomous support. I am supportive of all births without judgment of any kind. The birth you seek matters to me! If there‚Äôs something I can‚Äôt help with, I can refer to others. When I'm not doing anything birthy, I love to indulge in earthy things all around me. Whether that's being outdoors, making healing remedies for my family, or cooking from scratch. I'm learning how to sew and practicing more yoga as I learn. We are going back to the Nordic lifestyle where we live on the road in our RV and travel the world, going where we feel called or to visit family. I gave birth to four children of my own but have found myself being a mother to many. I love to read and play football with my family, and I'm a huge foodie! I love to try new things and live for experiences."
