The Netviewer Iberian location in Barcelona is to serve the domestic Spanish market, as well as Portugal and Central and South America. Managing director Victor Melendro, who previously headed up the Webex business in Spain, is now building Netviewer sales from a base of more than 200 customers in Spain and Latin America.

At the start of October, Netviewer also established a subsidiary in the northern Italian city of Milan. Manager Martina Trentini and her team already look after 200 customers, including Cassa Centrale, Siemens, Diamante S.p.a., and BMW.

"Our 11,000-plus customers are based in 45 countries worldwide. The strong international demand for our products provides us with a solid economic base from which to develop our most important regional markets via own subsidiaries. With our teams in Spain and Italy, we expectantly and optimistically look south. Next year we will expand to the north with a new subsidiary in Scandinavia", states CEO Dr. Andreas Schweinbenz.

A round of capital financing backs this growth: In recent months, Swiss private equity company Invision and TVM Capital have invested nine million euros in Netviewer in order to successfully drive rapid international expansion.

Netviewer recently gained its ten-thousandth customer, the UK company Advantage Focus Partnership, one of the world's largest business-travel management organizations. The company uses web collaboration to explain its online reservation system to customers and prospects and to train employees across the country.

The current Deloitte ranking once more acknowledges Netviewer as one of the fastest growing technology companies in Germany: Netviewer ranked sixth in the Fast50 Ranking, which was published in October.
