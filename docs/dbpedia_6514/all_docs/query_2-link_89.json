Prof. Dr. Nguyen Thi Ha Supervisor (s) Dr. Duong Thi Bich Ngoc Supervisor’s Signature Abstract: The Ba Vi National Park (Vietnamese: Vườn quốc Gia Ba Vì) is a national park found 48 km (30 mi) west of Hanoi, Vietnam. The recreation center is 10,815 ha (26,720 sections of land) in the region and is situated in the Ba Vi mountain extend. The recreation center has rich and different tropical and subtropical types of greenery. Ba Vi National Park is situated in Ba Vi District of Hanoi and two regions of Hoa Binh Province, to be specific Luong Son and Ky Son. This study paper identifies the significant changes in forest conservation and sustainable tourism how the area has responded to the land-use changes implies the conversion of forest zone to tourism including the impact, the effect on local people, tourist area, and demand from the government to benefit from the Ba Vi National park. A total of 55 tourist respondents in Ba Vi National Park were selected to answer the survey questionnaire and employed a non-probability convenience sampling. The result revealed that the tourist and local communities significant expectation towards forest conservation policy and sustainable tourism in response to land-use change is that “Good practices of waste management can help maintain the forest conservation” with the highest mean with a value of 4.64 and SD of 4.16 and significant challenges face by both policymakers and tourist are lack of awareness of the local communities on some of the importance of protecting the forest and keeping up to the polices created to ii preserve the forest. The study recommends more ways of creating visual awareness to the local people and tourist too on the importance of conserving our forest and possible ways of sustainable tourism regarding the land use in Ba Vi and controlling the deforestation, illegal logging, and over demand of land for infrastructural development in the forest zone.

INTRODUCTION 1.1. Background of the study Forest is played an important role for humans, animals, and plant survival involving the air we breathe to the wood we make use of it. Forest serves as habitats for human, animals and a plant which it acts an essential role in watershed protection, prevent soil erosion and mitigation of climate change currently faced by the world which shows that the importance of forests cannot be underestimated. Based on statistic the figure over 2 billion people rely on forests for shelter, livelihoods, water, food, building materials, timbers, papers, medicines, etc. forest serve as a home for 80% of the world’s terrestrial biodiversity, and are main sources of livelihood for many different human settlements which include 60 million indigenous people. Forest is regarded as the world’s largest storehouses of carbon which it provides ecosystem services that essential for human survival and welfare such as absorbing harmful greenhouse gasses which influence climate change (mainly in tropical forests such a quarter of a trillion tons of carbon is stored in the above and below-ground biomass) (WWF, 2019). Forest conservation policy is a law made in the protection and preservation of forest regions in the world to avoid illegal activities including deforestation and logging. The forest conservation policymakers are combat in reducing deforestation in the fight against loss of forest and climate change impact in the country but without a solid foundation in good governance and consistent policies such as forest conservation policy will not be achieved. Based on international bodies worldwide community continued to struggle to halt deforestation and the related loss of biodiversity in as much billions of dollars in foreign support in the fight against the challenges and strengthening regulations, deforestation has proven to be huge challenges to developing tropical countries and are the main habitant to world’s most valuable remaining forests (Marusiak, 2012). 2 Based on sustainable tourism in response to land-use change, the tourism industry and environmentalists may customarily be unusual partners, the expanding change of land away from its regular state into impractical uses may bring about the two turnings out to be partners in the battle to ensure staying characteristic scenes. This organization is introduced around a proposed manageable harmonious connection between regular asset preservation and the intensity of ecotourism goals. Under this cooperative relationship, ecotourism goals advantage as upgraded intensity from the insurance of value regular assets while the preservation of common assets is progressively esteemed because these assets are acknowledged as the establishment of the ecotourism business and the driver of every monetary advantage related with ecotourism. This applied paper surveys this relationship and graphically delineates the advantageous relationship, including the numerous digressive feasible results of biodiversity, flood control, water quality, carbon sequestration, and social legacy preservation that originate from the expanded motivating forces ecotourism brings to normal asset protection (B. Bynum Boley and Gary T. Green, 2016). The controversy regarding the impact of tourism on the global climate and the tourism industry is both a potential casualty of just as a noteworthy supporter of environmental change. The travel industry can be undermined by anticipated changes in the worldwide atmosphere. The previous research has talked about the differing effects of environmental change on the tourism industry including the tourism industry request, goal decision, and regularity. The ongoing examination has recognized the potential negative effects of environmental change on ecological and the tourism industry subordinate financial long-haul manageability in environmental change–delicate locales, for example, seaside zones, winter sports districts, and coral reefs. For instance, analysts address that a worldwide temperature alteration could prompt the decay of customary hotels in specific areas as they expect the appeal of goals would be bitten by bit moved towards higher scopes and heights. Specialists likewise called attention to that not exactly 50% of the current ski resorts would be continued inside a couple of decades in Switzerland. Likewise, various investigations 3 tended to the basic effects of environmental change on sea shore/island tourism goals. (Ju Hyoung Han, Min Jae Lee & Yun-Seop Hwang, 2016). Vietnam is a country that has abundant natural resources for many tourism activities and a niche market which implies the country has significant potential to become the market leader in adventure and Tourism activities, for example, Ba Vi National Park is situated in the Ba Vi District of Hanoi and two regions of Hoa Binh Province, to be specific Luong Son and Ky Son. The area has picture scenes with excellent lakes, streams, mountains, timberlands, and conventional Vietnamese towns. Ba Vi has pulled in guests with social, profound, biological, network-based, unwinding, and gathering visits. Some tourism lobbyists insisted that tourism has contributed to the social, economic, and cultural development of the local communities by preserving the tourist areas but the issue of balancing the forest conservation and land-use change has grown to develop more changes. However, Ba Vi National Park has subsequent development of infrastructure threaten by Land use change and forest conservation policy as the demand for better and recreation avenues from the government to the local communities which has to lead to demand for landuse change involving deforestation, destroying local houses, ponds, etc which are part of the local cultural heritage. Tourists are fond of enjoying nature, culture, environmental conservation activities. In other to balance the forest conservation project and sustainable tourism in response to land-use change in Ba Vi National Park which will educate the local communities’ importance of balancing both without expectation. Moreover, the operation of the conservation project in response to landuse change lay more emphasis on which will produce benefits and support in a sustainable tourist. The protected areas are significant for the development of the tourism area in Ba Vi National Park. This study is conducted to identify the conservation policy, sustainable tourist, and expectation toward the land-use change system in 4 aspects, environmental, community, socio-economic, and safety, and security. This study also identifies the most significant challenges faced regarding forest conservation policy, land-use 4 changes, and tourist and communities' expectations of the policy and changes in Ba Vi National Park. The poor operation of the conservation program and land change how it has affected the tourist and communities which can generate positive feedback and recommendations. As the world tend to evolved demand for land use from local communities, industries, a government institute, Tourism, and infrastructure contribute to the destroying of the forest, wildlife, and environment in which has led to the conservation of forest and importance of conserving our forest cannot be overemphasized and has become a national problem is essential to tackle and balance the demand for land use with perfect coordination between forest department, communities, government and other program related to conservation of forest which implies “ All hands must be on the desk” in other to combat inappropriate forest deforestation and illegal land use in the world (k. V Pawar and Ravi V. Rothkar, 2015) 1.2. Problem Statement Ba Vi National Park of Ba Vi District has emerged as a new tourism destination for its famous view, mountain, rich natural resources, forest, inter-tuda habitats, along diversified culture. Since tourism is still developing in the Ba Vi District, the growth of this Tourism brings an impact on the environment specifically on forest conservation in response to land use management in Ba Vi National Park. The European Enterprise and industry believed that “to achieve long term sustainability it needs to balance between sustainability in economic, environmental and sociocultural terms.” Hence, tourist destinations like Ba vi national Park should follow these practices. Tourists and local communities expect sustainable tourism in the Ba Vi can trigger the growth of local businesses at the same time maintaining land use management and the beauty of the forest resort for the next generation to enjoy. A well- operating transportation, forest conservation policy, and sustainable tourism sector is vital to the well- being of land-use site, however, poor services can hinder sustainable tourism and forest conservation programs. On the other hand, good 5 tourism services can be a big vital role in tourist satisfaction and land use management. 1.3. Objective 1. To determine the activities of the forest conservation program and tourist perception toward the land-use change. 2. To the analysis of the forest conservation suggestion and resource toward the mitigation of land use in Ba Vi National Park 3. To evaluate the economic benefit of tourists and progressive conservation programs in Ba Vi National Park. 1.4. Research question 1. How do the activities of forest conservation programs affect the land-use change impact? 2. How the suggested solutions in response to land-use change are sustainable? 3. What is the environmental benefit of sustainable tourists in response to landuse change? 1.5. Significance of the study This research proved to be significant because Ba Vi National Park is a fastdeveloping tourist destination in the north of Vietnam and therefore provides us with a working framework of what tourism principles are most valuable in ensuring and balancing a sustainable tourist and forest conservation policy. This research is also beneficial to the land use and forest resort site because if the services and operation are swift and performing well it would result in tourist satisfaction and generate more positive feedback to the local communities and others. To balance benefit, there must be sustainable management of Tourism and forest conservation sit. This study would serve as a beneficial opportunity for knowledge from previous studies and researchers to the author himself. This will contribute to a baseline reference for cognitive researchers, professors, and students. Furthermore, it would serve as exploring explanations and awareness about the importance of sustainable Tourism and forest conservation in Ba Vi District, which can help to manage the land use and it impacts 6 on the environment which will encourage everyone to become allies of our Mother Earth to engage him or her in behavior that can help towards sustainability and conservation goals. 1.6. Scope and Limitations The scope of this study is at the Ba Vi National Park, Ba Vi district. This research study is focused on the forest conservation policy and sustainable tourism response to land-use change in terms of the environment, community, socio-economic, safety, and security and also focus on the problem that local communities and tourist facing in the study site. Thus, this study will reveal the changes and impact of forest conservation policy and how the land-use change how contributed to the sustainable tourist by distributing a questionnaire and observing. This study is only for use on the present forest conservation policy in response to land-use change in Ba vi National Park, Ba Vi District, Vietnam. It was expected to face some challenges in finishing this study. All of the changes involved either direct or indirect in completing the study. One of the limitations was that the local communities and Tourists were not interested in participating in the study. Waiting for the availability of both local communities and tourist people for the survey is also a limitation and due to the impact of COVID 19 fewer foreign tourists. The length of time of the study was limited due to a series of procedures for at least 55 participants. The language barrier also a big challenge because not all Local people and tourists were non-native English speakers. 1.7. Definition Term The following defined to provide a clearer understanding of the terminologies included in the study; Forest conservation - Forest conservation as the name recommends is the perverting and the security of the forest zone. Sustainable tourism - Sustainable tourism is a tourism sector that assesses its current and future monetary, social and ecological effects, tending to the requirements of guests, the business, nature, and host networks. 7 Land-use change - Land-use change could be further explained as the conversion of a piece of land's use by humans, from one purpose to another. For example, land may be converted from cropland to grassland. Capacity Building- the activities, resources, and support that increase the skills and abilities of the people and community groups to take actions efficiently and effectively to lead the development of their communities. Environmental Conservation – is an action that is intended to initiate, conserve, or enhance good relations with nature.
