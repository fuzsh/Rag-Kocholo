        "text": "HBS worked with me to get everything set up in a way that works best for us with new hardware. They even sourced and ordered parts that are unusual for us. Any dealer looking for a DMS should call HBS Systems.\n\nHBS Systems is very easy to use and easy to get around in. The custom financials make it easy to look at all 13 locations on one consolidated screen, and if needed, I can look at each location for further analysis.\n\nWe changed to HBS systems after being on another system for 28 years. The training and support have been awesome! The experience was smooth and efficient. The Service Management feature is excellent!\n\nThe attention our business got right out of the gate set the bar extremely high, and our training was phenomenal. We immediately benefited from the real-time updates that are crucial when handling our rental customers. NetView Active Desktop allowed us to quickly see our available inventory, status of machines in service, and better understand demand for future planning all on one screen.\n\nThe team is easy to do business with and always a phone call away. If I ever do have a problem, it’s resolved. We’ve used HBS Systems since 1994 and I don’t see us ever switching.\n\nHBS Systems customer service is over the top. They have provided training to our team to train new employees and I’d recommend any dealership to look at HBS."
