The map is updated every second.\n\nPlease note that the map is not real-time video. However, the position itself is real-time.\n\nISS ground track\n\nThis map shows the ground track of the International Space Station's next orbit. The crosshair marks its current position.\n\nThe blue sections of the ISS' track indicate when the space station is in the earth's shadow. The red sections mark when the ISS is sunlit."
