        "text": "CMS evaluation and architecture\n\nEvaluation of 'Brightspot' as technical content experience platform. The system stood out for its scalability and internationalization capabilities but also offered huge flexibility in creating an architecture that suites a complex list of requirements from various stakeholders from many teams within Citrix that needed to be connected to the system. As a product owner it was my responsibility to collect the requirments and create the architectural concept for editorial and developers.\n\nResponsive Websites\n\nAs product owner I worked together with product team stakeholders, web designers and developers on collecting and in detail defining all components that are used throughout all product websites within the system. Main focus has been on multi device readiness but also keeping a consistent design approach and the same functionalities on all sites.\n\nLocalization\n\nIn order to meet the requirements to be globally ready for multiple countries and languages I introduced a completely new top level domain and internationalization concept to the organisation. With separating country specific content elements from commonly used elements we went with a language first approach and therefore were able to be highly scalable and introduce product websites to new countries within days.\n\nLanding page templates for marketing users\n\nRiskmethods was not happy with the complex structure of their marketing automation processes. There has been a wild mix of templates for emails, landing pages with all kinds of (sometimes really bad) designs and none of them could have been considered as benchmark as well.\n\nWebsite Relaunch Project\n\nIn this role I worked with the team to define the technical and business goals and lead the design process with its iterations. Finally the technical evaluation was done for the content management system and we worked with an agency to implement the website on Typo3, a highly scalable open source CMS system. The architecture was build with international scalability as a key requirement. Other main goals have been focus on easy web form management and testing readiness. As Netviewer had a performing website in place we needed to make sure that the new page will ideally perform better when launched. For that reason we decided to soft launch the site and iteratively send traffic to the sites whilst permantetly observing the performance and adjust the website content as needed. Several tools like website surveys, usability testing and A/B testing helped to outperform the older website and finally launch the whole project successfully within a project duration of only 5 month in 7 languages."
