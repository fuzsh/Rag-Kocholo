Im trying to get a solid overview (which does not exist) of our lan, primarily using (my eyes,reason :) )and CDP neighbors.\n\nHowever the 3com switches of course does not respond to cdp neighbors.\n\nWhat is the smartest way to decide what is on the other end of a fiber on a Gig interface of a 3560? (i mean which 3com switch). i know the ip address of the 3coms' management interfaces and i bellieve i somehow can put arp and spanning tree info, into use (?)\n\nWhat is \"best practice\" for documenting a non-cisco-Lan (in the absence of CDP)?\n\nThank you for any help!\n\nHi, I dont have any 3Com switches on my network but when I am trying to located a device I often use these commands on the switch\n\n\"show IP arp xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\"\n\n\"show mac-address address xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx\"\n\nIf you use the mac-address command it should show you which port that device is on. Also from the cmd in DOS you might try nslookup command to get host names that might help you identify some units.\n\nHTH"
