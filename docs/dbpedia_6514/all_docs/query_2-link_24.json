        "text": "Results\n\nInitial scoping\n\nThe findings of our scoping of the screen-sharing aspects of Attend Anywhere and 11 widely used videoconferencing applications are summarised in Table . Originally, a third method of reviewing action plans in the form of Google Docs and a telephone call was considered; however, this method was deemed to be far inferior to videoconferencing and was therefore rejected.\n\nTable 1\n\nApplicationFree version?Diverse operating system compatibility?Diverse device compatibility?aUser-friendly?bMore in-app features relative to Attend Anywhere?cAttend AnywhereYesYesYesYesN/AZoomYesYesYesYesYesTeamViewerYesYesYesNoNoMikogoYesYesYesNoNoSkypeYesYesYesYesNoZohoYesYesYesYesNoNetviewerNoNoNoNoNoGoToMeetingYesYesYesNoNoCisco WebExNoYesYesYesYesAnyMeetingYesYesNoNoNoLivestormNoYesYesYesNo\n\nTwo applications capable of screen-sharing in the context of a video-consultation were identified for further investigation: Attend Anywhere and Zoom.\n\nAttend Anywhere is a Google Chrome-based virtual clinic software promoted by NHS Scotland to increase healthcare service accessibility16.\n\nZoom requires a one-time download and log-in. It has unique in-application features, including recording, in-app file transfer, and remote control, which offers the host/participant control of other’s mouse/keyboard17.\n\nParticipants and arrangements for sessions\n\nWe recruited ten participants: five patient colleagues and five friends and family with a range of ages and using a range of devices (see Table for details). The sessions, which lasted between 30 and 60 min, were conducted by O.H. who was at the time based in British Columbia, Canada, while the participants were situated in the UK, Canada, or Switzerland.\n\nTable 2\n\nParticipant IDAgeDevice usedAUKCAR PPI group?P161Macbook AirNoP226Microsoft Surface ProNoP320Macbook ProNoP428Macbook ProNoP555iPhone 6 PlusNoP640iMac DesktopYesP775Dell DesktopYesP860iPad Mini 3YesP950iMac DesktopYesP1074iMac DesktopYes\n\nOverview of findings\n\nWe identified two themes (summarised in Table ):\n\nTechnical aspects with sub-themes about functionality and connectivity, features of the videoconferencing softwares, and user-friendliness.\n\nPotential for delivery of care.\n\nTable 3\n\nThemesSub-themesTechnical aspects○ Feasibility and connectivity○ Features of the videoconferencing software○ User friendlinessPotential for routine care○ Comparison to past experience○ Willingness to use○ Convenient but not such a good assessment\n\nWe describe our findings below with brief quotes from our field notes to highlight key points. A table with illustrative examples from our notes is in Supplementary Table 1.\n\nTechnical aspects: functionality and connectivity\n\nEight out of ten participants were able to view the action plan through screen-sharing on both applications. The participant using the iPhone 6 plus was unable to see a picture on their screen using Attend Anywhere and was therefore unable to review the action plan, even after a second try. She was, however, able to review the plan on Zoom. Furthermore, the iPad Mini’s VoiceOver feature (used by a participant with visual problems), which typically reads the screen aloud, was unable to translate the contents of the shared screen using either system. The Asthma UK action plan is available both as a ‘PDF’ and a plain text version; neither worked with VoiceOver.\n\nThere were some connection problems with both systems. For example, Attend Anywhere ‘froze’, and required the user to ‘go through the introduction screens again’ to repair the call.\n\nTechnical aspects: features of the videoconferencing software\n\nBoth softwares facilitated screen-sharing and provided in-meeting chat, which allowed users to send text messages to each other. File sharing and text chat were, however, unsuccessful in both applications when used through the iPhone 6 Plus and VoiceOver on the iPad Mini.\n\nZoom facilitated file sharing directly within the app, enabled recording of interactions, and allowed the participant to edit documents on the host’s screen using the remote control feature. The expediency of file sharing with Zoom was appreciated by some, but other participants, while recognising its usefulness, did not consider it provided overall increased benefit. One participant stated that they were satisfied with Attend Anywhere, which enabled them to ‘talk to a nurse over the line’ and ‘forward the action plan by email after the consultation’.\n\nMost participants liked being able to record consultations, noting that it could help consolidate information delivered during the review, though others pointed out that the action plan was already a summary of what was discussed. Even with the action plan summary, ‘additional points’ may have been discussed that could be usefully reviewed in a recording.\n\nAttend Anywhere does not allow the ‘patient’ to edit the document. This was the first software used and initially most participants did not mind this lack of functionality; it was enough to ‘be able to see the document being completed’. However, after trying the function in Zoom, participants identified several benefits of using the collaborative remote control feature. Some thought it would encourage them to ‘take ownership’ and participate in the revision of their action plan. Others felt that editing the document with the clinician improved communication, avoided misunderstandings, and ensured that the doctor or nurse ‘picked up everything that was said’. One participant thought that the ‘process would go a lot quicker if they could help edit the document’. This function did not work with VoiceOver.\n\nTechnical aspects: user friendliness\n\nDespite the technical limitations of both videoconference systems, most participants found them simple to navigate once opened. Some found it troublesome to access Attend Anywhere due to its sole compatibility with Google Chrome, which was not their default browser. On the other hand, other participants found Zoom’s one-time download requirement off-putting and appreciated Attend Anywhere’s simplicity, primarily because of its web-based nature that was perceived as easier for a ‘non-technical user’. There was a need for clarity about using the link—one participant was waiting for the researcher to call.\n\nOne participant explained that the content and layout of Attend Anywhere’s interface that was explicitly part of the NHS was an important factor for them. Features such as the NHS logo made it look ‘more official’, which helped them to ‘trust that it was real’. In contrast, others found that Zoom functioned better ‘despite the same internet connection’. VoiceOver proved to be more compatible with Zoom: Attend Anywhere ‘described very little’, whereas VoiceOver described the features available in the Zoom toolbar.\n\nPotential for routine care\n\nSome participants voiced opinions about the potential for using screen-sharing in real-life consultations.\n\nPotential compared to past experience\n\nSome participants who had received action plans in the past found very little difference between an online and a face-to-face consultation approach. The technology did not help the visually impaired patient overcome the problem of not being able to read a print action plan.\n\nPotential willingness to use\n\nNine of the ten participants said they would use video-conference software again. Some were very positive describing it as ‘a really great idea’ and commenting that being able to see the healthcare professional made it ‘feel like a consultation’ and that it was ‘much better than doing it over the phone’. Some considered that knowing the healthcare professional was an advantage suggesting that ‘it would be fine if it was with my asthma nurse that I’ve seen for years’.\n\nPotentially convenient but not such a good assessment\n\nMost participants liked the screen-sharing approach because it increased accessibility (for example, if their mobility was compromised), efficiency, and offered convenience that ‘outweighed the fact that they were not in the room with the healthcare professional’. Many of the participants observed that assessment of their condition would be more difficult, so it might be less suitable during periods of ill health when there was concern that ‘something else going on with my health’ that might be overlooked in a video-consultation. In contrast, one participant observed that a video-consultation could be a ‘life-saver’ if they had an acute attack in a remote location and needed advice on ‘what to do next’.\n\nDiscussion\n\nOnline screen-sharing was a practicable approach to joint completion of asthma action plans. Both softwares had some technical limitations: Zoom needed to download a piece of software, Attend Anywhere only worked with Chrome. Attend Anywhere had less functionality than Zoom, for example, not allowing the ‘patient’ to edit the action plan, but some found the NHS badging reassuring. Joint editing of an action plan (as was possible with Zoom) was considered to encourage participation and improve communication. Many participants observed that it was comparable to a live situation and considered that it offered a convenient, accessible, and efficient option.\n\nThe study has some strengths and limitations. A strength of this study was the practical trial of technology and the semi-structured feedback interviews, which allowed for a detailed evaluation of practical issues and other features concerning online review of action plans. Technology constantly develops, and we recognise that the systems we tried will have changed and additional functionality may now be available, though we are not aware that screen-sharing is being promoted as a feature in software designed for healthcare consultations suggesting that our findings may still be relevant.\n\nThe variety of ages, backgrounds, and technological abilities of study participants provided a multiplicity of perspectives. The sample size was small, but data saturation was achieved with respect to the key aim of exploring practical feasibility. Only one action plan was edited in the study, so the results may be different for other plans. A further limitation of the study is that the discussions were not recorded, which precluded reviewing and checking the accuracy of notes.\n\nFinally, although our participants offered some opinions about the suitability of screen-sharing for joint completion of action plans in routine care, this was not a core aim of this study and participants were not recruited to represent the range of asthma patients—indeed half the participants did not have asthma. Their comments should be considered as offering ideas for exploration in a future study.\n\nThe Model for Assessment of Telemedicine applications provides a structure for assessing the efficacy and standard of care offered by telemedicine applications. The three elements are preceding considerations, multidisciplinary assessment, and assessment of transferability18, and these are considered in turn in our interpretation of our findings\n\nBoth applications used in this study facilitated the remote provision of action plans for the majority of participants, and most subjects found the approach to be comparable to a live situation. Furthermore, barriers to implementation were minimal as both applications are mature and used in real life; indeed Attend Anywhere is currently available for use in healthcare consultations in the UK and Australia. There is a long-standing precedent for the use of telephone consultations in asthma reviews11. Video-consultations are a relatively recent innovation enabling visual clues, which may improve rapport and communication19. Clinicians share the screen in face-to-face consultations as a strategy to involve patients in their healthcare20; our study shows that ‘screen-sharing’ in a video-consultation to complete an action plan is possible.\n\nAction plans completed as part of a self-management discussion improves health outcomes of people with asthma, and participants noted that the online approach had the potential for time and cost-efficiency, convenience, and accessibility, which may facilitate implementation. From an organisational viewpoint, assessment of how an online approach would fit into routine practice would be needed before it was introduced. In the context of the UK, almost all action plans are provided by nurses, and almost all are delivered in face-to-face consultations21, with slow adoption of remote alternatives. This, however, has changed overnight with the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. The requirement for social distancing means that practices are adopting video-consultations to avoid face-to-face contact, and the widespread adoption of video-calling to maintain social contact during pandemic lockdowns means greater public familiarity with the technology22. Asthma UK’s advice that people with asthma should have an action plan will require remote strategies including potentially shared completion of an online plan.\n\nOverall, participants were amenable to the screen-sharing approach, but broadening the compatibility of Attend Anywhere to include other web-browsers and expanding its feature profile may enhance user friendliness. Socio-cultural, ethical, and legal aspects were not evaluated in this study and are areas for future research.\n\nNHS firewalls would be very unlikely to allow practices to use Zoom for consultations—especially if it allowed patients to control the mouse/keyboard on an NHS computer. Attend Anywhere is approved in the NHS, but the functionality does not permit editing or transferring the completed plan to the patient for saving locally—or printing, though our participants were not too concerned by this. The need to upgrade NHS technology infrastructure to overcome practical barriers to video-consulting (such as lack of bandwidth, interruptions to communication, no web-cams) has been described previously20.\n\nIn conclusion, joint completion of action plans using screen-sharing technology was feasible, with only a few (potentially remediable) practical problems. Attend Anywhere is approved and available within the NHS but has less functionality than Zoom; neither had considered the needs of people with visual problems. Most participants appreciated the screen-sharing and did not feel it diminished their discussion about the action plan. These findings suggest that this may be a fruitful approach for a further study—made more urgent by the imperative to develop remote consultations in the face of a global pandemic."
