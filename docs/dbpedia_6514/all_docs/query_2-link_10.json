We also acknowledge the territories of First Nations around B.C. and are grateful to carry out our work on these lands.\n\nWe recognize that we operate on land that was never legally ceded and we acknowledge that in order to better understand our role as emergency communications professionals and colleagues, it is important that we invest in lifelong learning about the rich history of the many traditional lands our sites are on.\n\nWe are committed to developing and fostering relationships with Indigenous communities to advance Reconciliation. Acknowledging that we are still in the early stages of our journey, we actively support our employees in their personal Truth and Reconciliation learning and encourage expressions of Indigenous culture in the workplace."
