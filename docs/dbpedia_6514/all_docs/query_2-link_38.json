INOC no longer exists in this form.\n\nInput/output\n\nSee I/O.\n\nInstance\n\nIn statistical analysis, the single occurrence of a phenomena or event.\n\nInsulator\n\nA material that is highly resistant to electrical and/or thermal conduction.\n\nInsured Burst\n\nThe largest burst of data above the insured rate that will be temporarily allowed on a PVC and not tagged by the traffic policing function for dropping in the case of network congestion. The insured burst is specified in bytes or cells. Compare with maximum burst. See also insured rate.\n\nInsured Rate\n\nThe long-term data throughput, in bits or cells per second, that an ATM network commits to support under normal network conditions. The insured rate is 100 percent allocated; the entire amount is deducted from the total trunk bandwidth along the path of the circuit. Compare with excess rate and maximum rate. See also insured burst.\n\nInsured Traffic\n\nTraffic within the insured rate specified for the PVC. This traffic should not be dropped by the network under normal network conditions. See also CLP and insured rate.\n\nIntegrated IS-IS\n\nRouting protocol based on the OSI routing protocol IS-IS but with support for IP and other protocols. Integrated IS-IS implementations send only one set of routing updates, making it more efficient than two separate implementations. Formerly referred to as Dual IS-IS. Compare IS-IS.\n\nIntegrated Service Digital Network\n\nSee ISDN.\n\nIntegrity\n\nIn networking, a desirable condition where the information received is exactly equal to the information sent.\n\nIntelligence\n\nThe ability of a system to use general information to respond appropriately to specific events.\n\nInterarea Routing\n\nTerm used to describe routing between two or more logical areas. Compare with intra-area routing.\n\nInterdomain Policy Routing\n\nSee IDPR.\n\nInterface\n\n1. Connection between two systems or devices. 2. In routing terminology, a network connection. 3. In telephony, a shared boundary defined by common physical interconnection characteristics, signal characteristics, and meanings of interchanged signals. 4. The boundary between adjacent layers of the OSI model.\n\nInterface Message Processor\n\nSee IMP.\n\nInterference\n\nUnwanted communication channel noise.\n\nInterim Local Management Interface\n\nSee ILMI.\n\nInterior Gateway Protocol\n\nSee IGP.\n\nInterior Gateway Routing Protocol\n\nSee IGRP.\n\nIntermediate Routing Node\n\nSee IRN.\n\nIntermediate Session Routing\n\nSee IRS.\n\nIntermediate System\n\nSee IS.\n\nIntermediate System-to-Intermediate System\n\nSee IS-IS.\n\nInternational Code Designator\n\nSee ICD.\n\nInternational Data Number\n\nSee X.121.\n\nInternet\n\n1. The worldwide system of linked networks that is capable of exchanging mail and data through a common addressing and naming system based on TCP/IP protocols. 2. Any group of linked networks capable of exchanging electronic mail and data using a common protocol.\n\nInternet Address\n\nAn address that identifies a communication entity on an internet.\n\nInternet Node Address\n\nIn AppleTalk, the combination of network and node address that uniquely defines an AppleTalk protocol running in a device that is currently active.\n\nInternet Protocol\n\nSee IP.\n\nInternet protocol\n\nAny protocol that is part of the TCP/IP protocol stack. See TCP/IP.\n\nInternet Research Steering Group\n\nSee IRSG.\n\nInternet Research Task Force\n\nSee IRTF.\n\nInternet Router\n\nA router that uses the rules of one or more Network Layer protocols to forward packets between networks.\n\nInternet Society\n\nSee ISOC.\n\nInternet Socket\n\nIn AppleTalk, the combination of network, node and socket\n\nAddress\n\naddress that uniquely identifies a software process that is using AppleTalk protocols to communicate.\n\nInternetwork\n\nCollection of networks interconnected by routers and other devices that functions generally) as a single network. Sometimes called an internet, which is not to be confused with the Internet.\n\nInternetworking\n\nGeneral term used to refer to the industry that has arisen around the problem of connecting networks together. The term can refer to products, procedures, and technologies.\n\nInternetwork Packet Exchange\n\nSee IPX.\n\nInteroperability\n\nAbility of computing equipment manufactured by different vendors to communicate with one another successfully over the network.\n\nInter-Switching System Interface\n\nSee ISSI.\n\nIntra-area Routing\n\nTerm used to describe routing within a logical area. Compare with interarea routing.\n\nInverse ARP\n\nInverse Address Resolution Protocol. Method of building dynamic routes in a network. Allows an access server to discover the network address of a device associated with a virtual circuit.\n\nI/O\n\ninput/output.\n\nIP\n\nInternet Protocol.
