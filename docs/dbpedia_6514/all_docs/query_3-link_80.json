        "text": "I/Dispatcher provides complete capabilities for call-taking, dispatching, and resource management. It features dialogue and map-based views of calls, events, and units and automatically recommends and routes resources based on location, availability, skills, and more. With I/Dispatcher, call-takers, dispatchers, and supervisors can verify calls, create events, and dispatch and monitor resources quickly and confidently.\n\nThrough interfaces to external systems, users can automate event creation from alarms; run queries on records and external databases; communicate in real time with field personnel via mobile computers, smartphones, radios, and more; and track and monitor AVL and GPS-enabled units and personnel for better resource management, situational awareness, and personnel safety.\n\nA subset of I/Dispatcher, I/Calltaker supports call entry, event creation, and automatic call routing for organizations that separate call-taking and dispatching functions. An add-on component, I/AutoDispatch identifies and schedules dispatching of units for non-emergency situations, balancing workload and optimizing resources for planned jobs."
