        "text": "(i) General Remarks\n\nThe overriding objective of the ITLR is the creation of a reliable and expandable lexical resource that facilitates the study of Indian and Indo-Tibetan Buddhism as well as the investigation of many texts and ideas transmitted via Indic and Tibetan sources that are not exclusively Buddhist. Designed as a digital platform for researchers from the fields of classical Indology, Tibetology, and Buddhology, the ITLR accumulates and stores lexical items that are the products (or by-products) of research carried out within the framework of selected projects devoted to the investigation of Indian and Indo-Tibetan Buddhist literature, and that in many cases end up tucked away in scholarly footnotes. It intends to provide scholars with information about lexical items of various kinds, and in the long term will be able to provide the necessary infrastructure for collaborative research and other forms of cooperation, including cooperation between traditional and modern academics. It aims to become a digital treasury of reliable lexical data that serves the broader scholarly community interested in Indic and Tibetan compositions and thought.\n\nOne of the special features of the ITLR is that it attempts to provide for the individual Sanskrit Headwords equivalents in other Indic languages and in Tibetan, together with attestations in the form of references to primary and/or secondary sources. This is also the case for fixed enumerative sets (known in Tibetan as chos kyi rnam grangs) inasmuch as both the occurrence of the set as such as well as the bilingual individual items are verified and backed up by sources.\n\nThe fact that the ITLR is an Indo-Tibetan lexical resource has consequences for both its structure and content:\n\nTo begin, the database’s point of departure, namely, the Headword, is in Sanskrit. In accordance with the linguistic situation of Buddhist Sanskrit texts, Headwords from classical Sanskrit as well as Headwords from the different varieties of hybrid Sanskrit, especially those assessed by Franklin Edgerton (1953) as belonging to ‘Buddhist-Hybrid Sanskrit,’ are taken into consideration. Equivalents of Sanskrit terms in other Indic languages may be included as well, though not as independent Headwords.\n\nSecond, the database attempts to provide Tibetan equivalents for the Headword whenever possible. Contributors are also encouraged to add equivalents from other non-Indic Buddhist languages (e.g., Chinese) whenever this might be desirable or necessary from an Indological and general Buddhological perspective.\n\nIn terms of its concept, nature, structure, content, scope, target, and not least the degree of accuracy and reliability strived for, the ITLR database is unique. It does not duplicate any existing online or offline Indo-Tibetan lexical source/resource. In general, scholars engaged in the study of Indo-Tibetan Buddhist texts and ideas lack a Sanskrit-Tibetan lexical resource that caters to their needs and is sufficiently reliable—be it traditional or modern, electronic or printed, accessible online or offline. The raison d’être of the ITLR database is to redress the situation and try to fill this gap. Some traditional Sanskrit-Tibetan lexicons are indeed available, or rather what may be more fittingly characterized as bilingual lists of words (i.e., skad gnyis shan sbyar), such as those by mDo-mkhar-ba Tshe-ring-dbang-rgyal (1697–1763), Mi-pham rNam-rgyal-rgya-mtsho (1846–1912), and dMu-dge bSam-gtan (1914–1993). But these works (a) are riddled with scribal and other errors, particularly in their Sanskrit sections, partly because they are often based on older lexicographical lists which in turn also contained numerous errors, (b) have not been thus far properly edited, (c) as a rule provide no sources, and (d) occasionally contain falsely ‘reconstructed’ and thus ‘ghost’ Sanskrit words. Thus, these skad gnyis shan sbyar sources are actually unusable as they now stand. The ITLR, however, does not disregard these sources, but attempts, whenever possible, to (a) record the Sanskrit-Tibetan correspondence found in them under the section “Tibetan Rendering/s of the Skt Headword: In Sources with Bi/Multilingual Attestations” (which is second in the rank of sources for bilingual attestations), (b) cross-check against other Sanskrit sources and ensure that the word exists and is correct, and (c) point out any errors (if detected) and propose corrections.\n\nThe ITLR also integrates, whenever applicable, the lexical entries in the Sanskrit-Tibetan lexicons known as the Mahāvyutpatti and Madhyavyutpatti (≈ sGra sbyor bam po gnyis pa), and likewise attempts to correct mistakes of various kinds found in the existing editions. While the entries in the Mahāvyutpatti have been incorporated into one of the database’s four categories (i.e., Word/Term/Phrase, Personal Name, Place Name, and Title of Scripture/Treatise), an attempt has been made to retain one of the special features of the Mahāvyutpatti, namely, its thematic or topical categorization. This has been realized through the section “Enumerations,” which reflects what the Tibetan scholarly tradition attempted to achieve through a type of literature called ‘numerical lists of key Dharmic terms or concepts’ (chos kyi rnam grangs). The ITLR also relies on modern Sanskrit-Tibetan lexical works, particularly indices, which serve as secondary sources for bilingual Sanskrit-Tibetan attestations for the ITLR. To date, several indices have been considered, selected in order to cover different literary genres and philosophical directions, namely, the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya (Hirakawa 1978), the deity list of the Vajrāvalī (Mori 2009), the Saṃvarodaya (Tsuda 1974), and the Suvarṇaprabhāsottama (Nobel 1950). Here, too, errors are pointed out and addressed by the ITLR editors. Other indices have been occasionally considered as well.\n\nModern dictionaries have additionally been taken into consideration. These include J. S. Negi’s impressive sixteen-volume Tibetan-Sanskrit Dictionary (Negi 1993–2015)—which is of immense value owing to its citation of short pertinent texts in context—and, owing to their nature and scope, widely used Sanskrit dictionaries—such as the seven-volume Sanskrit-German dictionary (Böhtlingk & Roth 1855–1875, often referred to as the Petersburger Wörterbuch = PW) and A Sanskrit-English Dictionary (Monier-Williams 1899 = MW). Given that the latter, however, do not particularly focus on Buddhist terms and do not contain Sanskrit-Tibetan correspondences, other dictionaries such as Edgerton’s Buddhist-Hybrid Sanskrit Dictionary (BHSD) have been consulted. It is to be noted, however, that Edgerton was not really interested in the study of Buddhist texts and ideas as such, let alone the study of Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, and chose to focus rather on the linguistic aspect of what he called ‘Buddhist-Hybrid Sanskrit,’ thus categorically disregarding anything that he considered to be pure ‘Classical Sanskrit’ lexemes even when they expressed fundamental or key Buddhist concepts (e.g., nirvāṇa). He selectively took over only terms that he considered ‘Buddhist-Hybrid Sanskrit’ and mentions Tibetan renderings of words from the Mahāvyutpatti only occasionally.\n\n(ii) The Structure of the ITLR Entries\n\nThe ITLR is generally structured around four main lexical categories: (a) Word/Term/Phrase, (b) Personal Name, (c) Place Name, and (d) Title of Scripture/Treatise. Each of these four categories is structured slightly differently. The category “Word/Term/Phrase,” for example, is broken down into the following subentries.\n\n“Headword” (Sanskrit). If not a phrase, the Headword is in the stem form (in the case of nouns) or in the root form (in the case of verbs).\n\n“Grammatical Information.” Includes information such as gender, parts of speech, etc.\n\n“Taxonomical Labels.” It should be noted that these labels have not been considered obligatory and merely serve as an orientation aid.\n\n“Variant.” Records variant forms of the Headword.\n\n“Non-Sanskrit Indic Language.” Records Indic, in particular Middle Indo-Aryan (e.g., Pāli), variants of the Headword.\n\n“Tibetan Rendering/s of the Skt Headword.” This subentry is further divided into three subcategories that relate to the sources, which are arranged according to their level of authority: (i) “In Tibetan Translations with Available Skt,” (ii) “In Sources with Bi/Multilingual Attestations,” and (iii) “In Tibetan Translations with no Available Skt or in Autochthonous Works without Bi/Multilingual Attestations.”\n\n“Chinese Rendering/s of the Skt Headword,” with the same three subcategories as in (6). This subentry has not been widely implemented for the sake of limiting the scope of the ITLR.\n\n“Modern Rendering/s” (of the Headword). To date, priority has been given to English, but renderings into other languages such as German or French are occasionally supplied.\n\n“Key Information.” When applicable, succinct information related to the Headword, which cannot be gathered from the modern rendering alone, is provided.\n\n“Occurrences in Primary Sources: Indic.” Passages found in Indic sources that contain the Headword are provided. The cited textual passage may contain a definition, explanation, or description of the Headword, or be the locus classicus of the Headword, or contain a rare or remarkable occurrence of it, and it may be in the original language (usually Sanskrit, but occasionally Pāli) and/or in its translation into one of the classical Buddhist languages (mostly Tibetan, but occasionally Chinese), and occasionally also in its translation in a modern language (usually English, but occasionally German or French).\n\n“Occurrences in Primary Sources: Tibetan Autochthonous Works.” Records, when applicable, citations from passages containing definitions, explanations, descriptions, locus classicus, and other meaningful occurrences of the Headword found in indigenous Tibetan works (i.e., works that are not translations from the Sanskrit).\n\n“Discussions in Secondary Sources.” This subentry provides summaries of or references to previous research on the Headword.\n\n“Paryāya.” Includes metonymous words that refer to the Headword, with their Tibetan renderings, based on Abhidhāna (mNgon-brjod) literature. To date no information has been recorded in this category.\n\n“Enumerations.” Records, when applicable, fixed sets of items occurring in Indo-Tibetan sources (e.g., 5 skandhas). This subentry has been included because it retains the usefulness of traditional ways of arranging key terms and concepts.\n\n“Subclassifications.” Records ways the Headword (e.g., name of a Buddhist school) has been subclassified.\n\n“Analogies.” Records and explains analogies used in Indic and Tibetan sources, which are often not self-explanatory.\n\n“General Remarks.” Contains information that cannot be included in any of the other subentries.\n\nEach of the above subentries do not necessarily contain data. They allow, however, an ITLR entry to constantly grow in size and improve in quality. All of the information given is backed up by primary or secondary sources or references. When information stems from the contributors/editors themselves, they are referred to as the source.\n\n(iii) Planned Future Development of the ITLR\n\nThe ITLR aspires to become a major repository of accurate and reliable lexical data and related information. In the coming months and years, the number of published entries will steadily increase, and published entries will be revised when necessary and enlarged whenever possible. In order to facilitate input into the ITLR, the Khyentse Center has been inviting scholars as short- or long-term ITLR fellows. Regular ITLR Editorial Retreats serve to advance the publication of entries."
