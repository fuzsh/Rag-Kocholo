        "text": "Today, exactly 10 years ago, I officially moved to Karlsruhe (Germany). I reflected on this journey in Germany and I decided to write this article about it.\n\nI would like to start where I am today. I am still living in Karlsruhe, married, having two lovely twin sons (4 years old) and working in the energy sector again since one year. I love my life and am very thankful for both my private and working-life. At EnBW I work in an extremely exciting initiative, where we are creating a state of the art and top class customer service experience! In our agile environment I am working on creating the optimal environment for our colleagues feeling trusted, be able to use their strenghts, grow and with this create great outcome for our customers!\n\nEarlier this year I established my purpose (version 1.0) \"creating positive environments where people can connect, reflect and grow\". This is definitely the core of who I am and I am so happy that at my current job, I can live up to my purpose daily! This is such a blessing!\n\nBut where did it start in 2010, well, the start was not that easy. I followed my heart for the love of my life. Leaving behind my family, friends and my great Management Traineeship and colleagues at Alliander in the Netherlands. I came to Germany without having any certainty, just a feeling that this was the right way to go.\n\nAt the beginning I had - no job, and no network at all in Karlsruhe or generally in Germany and on top of that, I was not feeling confident enough in the German language to apply for a job in German. In the first weeks I sent out many application letters (without finding any vacancies which fitted) for jobs fitting to my background and had no success. I was very impatient with myself and thought what can I change. What could I do differently?\n\nI changed course, thinking what do I have, what others might not have in Karlsruhe. This lead me to languages. I could bring English, Dutch and Swedish to the table and when searching with this in mind, I found a job ad for \"Corporate Sales Representative\" at Netviewer. At the end of August I went to an application day and I got the job! I had great colleagues and although sales was not fitting to my background, it went very well.\n\nIn the meantime I asked myself, how do I create and later expand my network here. I created an account on Xing (today I have over a thousand contacts) and was soon approached by Wilhelm with the question if I wanted to organize a Dutch \"Stammtisch\" in Karlsruhe! Of course I said yes and this was a great way to both feel connected to my home country and language and in the meantime get to know more people in Karlsruhe. In parallel I also wanted to improve my German to be able to apply for a job and work in the german language. I had a great teacher and for about half a year I went to her for private german lessons twice a week at 7.30 am.\n\nAutumn 2011 Robert, a top manager from 1&1, came to the Dutch Stammtisch and after a nice long talk he said to me \"I have the feeling that sales is not your calling\". He connected me to Verena, the Head of HR at 1&1 and we had a great meeting. There was an immediate connection and although there wasn't an open position which fitted perfectly to my background she connected me to my later boss Joachim and he hired me as a Program Manager in a Software Development Department. Here, my Agile Journey started and my love for working in agile structures and leading by agile principles and values was born. It was a great time working in the Hosting Deparment of 1&1 working with colleagues from Karslruhe, Berlin and Bucharest on a daily basis.\n\nAt that time I was contacted by Sibylle asking me if I was interested in joining EWMD (European Women Management Development Network) and there a new part of my network started. I become chairwoman of a local group in our region and learned a lot from many women in management positions in different companies and experience levels.\n\nUntil my parental leave in 2016 I was in several positions in our Product Development Division (in the meantime our software department transformed towards a product development division). I always cared for topics like leadership (development), agility, transformation and culture and with the management team which I was a part of, we created an agile organisation in which I learned a lot! I was also asked to be first \"people lead\" within our division (caring for people primary).\n\nI was two years on parental leave and learned a great deal about parenting, twins, bi-lingual upbringing and topics like organizing and flexibility were brought to a different level!\n\nIn 2018 it was an interesting question, where do I return within the company. I had several options, which was great for me, since I could really choose what I wanted to do! I moved to HR. I wanted to move to another perspective and also share what I learned in product development and decrease the gap between HR and Business. I had the chance to work with many great people on topics like leadership principles, culture, agility in our organization as well as employee lifecycle products with our HR-Departments in six different countries (Philippines, USA, UK, Romania, Spain and other offices in Germany).\n\nDue to several changes in the organization, early 2019, I had the feeling that there wasn't an optimal fit between the company and my personal goals and values any longer. Then something interesting happened, as if it was a sign, during January and February I met several people from EnBW (Energy Company) at local agile meetups and they were all very enthusiastic about the company. I had a contact, Flo(rian), which I met a couple of years before and we met for a coffee. We were working on simular projects. I found an open job position at EnBW and asked him if he knew anything about it and he told me that the boss of this position was a good colleage of him. He connected us and I went for a coffee with Corinna. Within an hour and one cup of coffee, I had the feeling - this will be my next boss and company. After a formal application it came as I hoped and I started at 1.8.2019 at EnBW as a Manager Digital Transformation.\n\nAfter a year I can say that I met so many great people within EnBW and Yello, work on interesting topics matching my purpose, have a lot of freedom, creation space and responsibility and enjoying and learning a lot. I am working with my boss instead of for her and together with the other #SMAZ colleagues we really can achieve a lot! In parallel I am part of the Agile Coach Community, the Transformation Community and have the chance to really contribute in many areas for the company!\n\nThis is where I am today. I have seen many different areas over the past ten years - sales, software development, product development, HR and currently working in customer service. This helps me to see and understand things from different perspectives - both from a personality side as well as from a professional and technical side."
