Examine the provided samples, which demonstrate the necessary changes.\n\n2. Make the necessary changes to the user exits for each of the previously-\n\nmentioned modules.\n\n3. Assemble and link the user exits into the Tivoli NetView load library. The\n\nsource for the $NMNVC macro is provided to allow the\n\nassembly of the modules.\n\nNote: The source code for the above exits can be found in the supplied\n\ndsnpref.NMC2.CC2DSAMP library. The names are NMXITCI and\n\nNMDSIX nn. The $NMNVC macro can be found in the supplied\n\ndsnpref.NMC2.CC2DMAC library.\n\n** This is still correct. **\n\n-"
