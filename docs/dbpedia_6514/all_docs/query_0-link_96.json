The purpose of this retrospective study was to compare cranial thoracic intervertebral disc herniations in German Shepherd dogs and other large breed dogs (control group). Medical records at the Ontario Veterinary College were searched for German Shepherd dogs and other large breed dogs that had magnetic resonance imaging studies including the T1-T9 region. For each dog and each disc space from T1-T9, three variables (compression, disc degeneration, and herniation) were recorded and graded based on review of sagittal T2-weighted images. Twenty-three German Shepherd dogs and 47 other large breed dogs met inclusion criteria. The German Shepherd dog group had higher scores than the control group for compression (P = 0.0099) and herniation (P < 0.001), but not disc degeneration (P = 0.97). In the German Shepherd dog group, intervertebral discs T2-T3 and T4-T5 had an increased risk for compression and T3-T4 had an increased risk for compression and herniation. Findings from this study indicated that German Shepherd dogs may be more likely than other large breed dogs to have spinal cord compression due to cranial thoracic disc herniations. Imaging of the cranial thoracic spine, including T2-T3, is recommended for German Shepherd dogs with T3-L3 neurological signs.

No skin lesions were found. There was no clinical evidence of the presence of tumour elsewhere in the body and so the spleen was considered to be the primary site. The dog was clinically normal 6 months after splenectomy.\n\nMultifocal Aspergillus terreus discospondylitis in two German shepherd dogs.\n\nPubMed\n\nBerry, W L; Leisewitz, A L\n\n1996-12-01\n\nMultifocal fungal (Aspergillus terreus) discospondylitis was diagnosed in 2 German shepherd dogs. In one dog, the aetiology was established by means of fluoroscopic-guided disc aspiration, cytology and culture of disc material and urine. Disseminated aspergillosis was confirmed at necropsy and A. terreus cultured from numerous organs in this dog. The aetiology in the other dog was not established until therapeutic failure forced surgical curettage of disc material from which the fungus was cultured. Ketoconazole therapy failed to effect an improvement, and at necropsy, disease was localised to the spinal column, with A. terreus cultured from the affected discs and associated vertebrae. Immunodeficiency was suspected in both cases. In the case of disseminated disease a reduced lymphocyte blastogenic response was demonstrated. Reduced IgA was shown in both cases. The German shepherd breed seems to be predisposed to Aspergillus infections and IgA deficiency.\n\nCombined pituitary hormone deficiency in german shepherd dogs with dwarfism.\n\nPubMed\n\nKooistra, H S; Voorhout, G; Mol, J A; Rijnberk, A\n\n2000-10-01\n\nIn German shepherd dogs pituitary dwarfism is known as an autosomal recessive inherited abnormality. To investigate whether the function of cells other than the somatotropes may also be impaired in this disease, the secretory capacity of the pituitary anterior lobe (AL) cells was studied by a combined pituitary AL stimulation test with four releasing hormones (4RH test) in four male and four female German shepherd dwarfs. In addition, the morphology of the pituitary was investigated by computed tomography. The physical features of the eight German shepherd dwarfs were primarily characterized by growth retardation and stagnant development of the hair coat. The results of the 4RH test confirmed the presence of hyposomatotropism. The basal plasma TSH and prolactin concentrations were also low and did not change upon stimulation. Basal plasma concentrations of LH were relatively low and responded only slightly to suprapituitary stimulation. With respect to the plasma FSH levels there was a clear gender difference. In the males plasma FSH concentrations remained below the detection limit throughout the 4RH test, whereas in the females the basal plasma FSH levels were slightly lower and there was only a small increase following suprapituitary stimulation, compared with the values in age-matched controls. In contrast, basal and stimulated plasma ACTH concentrations did not differ between the dwarfs and the controls. Computed tomography of the pituitary fossa revealed a normal sized pituitary with cysts in five dogs, an enlarged pituitary with cysts in two dogs, and a small pituitary gland without cysts in the remaining dog. The results of this study demonstrate that German shepherd dwarfs have a combined deficiency of GH, TSH, and prolactin together with impaired release of gonadotropins, whereas ACTH secretion is preserved. The combined pituitary hormone deficiency is associated with cyst formation and pituitary hypoplasia.\n\nTemporary remission of disseminated paecilomycosis in a German shepherd dog treated with ketoconazole.\n\nPubMed\n\nBooth, M J; van der Lugt, J J; van Heerden, A; Picard, J A\n\n2001-06-01\n\nDisseminated mycosis caused by Paecilomyces varioti in a female German shepherd dog presented with chronic forelimb lameness is described. Radiographs of the swollen carpal joint revealed geographic lysis of the radial epiphysis. Diagnosis was based on cytological demonstration of fungal hyphae and chlamydiospores, as well as fungal culture of fluid obtained by arthrocentesis. Temporary remission was characterised by markedly improved clinical signs and laboratory parameters, following treatment with ketoconazole. The dog was euthanased 9 months after the initial diagnosis, following the diagnosis of multifocal discospondylitis. This appears to be the longest described period of temporary remission obtained with treatment in dogs with paecilomycosis. Clinical, clinicopathological and necropsy findings of this disease in another German shepherd dog are briefly described.\n\nIleocecocolic volvulus in a German shepherd dog\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJavard, Romain; Specchi, Swan; Benamou, JÃ©rÃ´me; Lapointe, Catherine; Deffontaines, Jean-Baptiste; PlantÃ©, JÃ©rÃ´me; dâAnjou, Marc-AndrÃ©\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis report describes an ileocecocolic volvulus in a German shepherd dog with risk factors of previous abdominal surgeries and concurrent chronic enteropathy. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) with multiplanar reformatting was more sensitive than abdominal radiographs or ultrasound to obtain a diagnosis, because of the presence of a âwhirl-signâ on CT. A combination of colopexy and cecopexy was succesfully used to treat the patientâs condition. PMID:25392556\n\nFacet joint geometry and intervertebral disk degeneration in the L5-S1 region of the vertebral column in German Shepherd dogs.\n\nPubMed\n\nSeiler, Gabriela S; HÃ¤ni, HansjÃ¼rg; Busato, AndrÃ© R; Lang, Johann\n\n2002-01-01\n\nTo evaluate the possible association between facet joint geometry and intervertebral disk degeneration in German Shepherd Dogs. 25 German Shepherd Dogs and 11 control dogs of similar body weight and condition. Facet joint angles in the caudal portion of the lumbar region of the vertebral column (L5-S1) were measured by use of computed tomography, and the intervertebral discs were evaluated microscopically. The relationship between facet joint geometry and disk degeneration was evaluated by use of statistical methods. German Shepherd Dogs had significantly more facet joint tropism than control dogs, but an association with disk degeneration was not found. However, German Shepherd Dogs had a different facet joint conformation, with more sagittally oriented facet joints at L5-L6 and L6-L7 and a larger angle difference between the lumbar and lumbosacral facet joints, compared with control dogs. A large difference between facet joint angles at L6-L7 and L7-S1 in German Shepherd Dogs may be associated with the frequent occurrence of lumbosacral disk degeneration in this breed.\n\nCharacterization of the dog agouti gene and a nonagouti mutation in german shepherd dogs\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKerns, Julie A.; Newton, J.; Berryere, Tom G.\n\nThe interaction between two genes, Agouti and Melanocortin-1 receptor (Mc1r), produces diverse pigment patterns in mammals by regulating the type, amount, and distribution pattern of the two pigment types found in mammalian hair: eumelanin (brown/black) and pheomelanin (yellow/red). In domestic dogs (Canis familiaris), there is a tremendous variation in coat color patterns between and within breeds; however, previous studies suggest that the molecular genetics of pigment-type switching in dogs may differ from that of other mammals. Here we report the identification and characterization of the Agouti gene from domestic dogs, predicted to encode a 131-amino-acid secreted protein 98 percent identicalmoreÂ Â» to the fox homolog, and which maps to chromosome CFA24 in a region of conserved linkage. Comparative analysis of the Doberman Pinscher Agouti cDNA, the fox cDNA, and 180 kb of Doberman Pinscher genomic DNA suggests that, as with laboratory mice, different pigment-type-switching patterns in the canine family are controlled by alternative usage of different promoters and untranslated first exons. A small survey of Labrador Retrievers, Greyhounds, Australian Shepherds, and German Shepherd Dogs did not uncover any polymorphisms, but we identified a single nucleotide variant in black German Shepherd Dogs predicted to cause an Arg-to-Cys substitution at codon 96, which is likely to account for recessive inheritance of a uniform black coat.Â«Â less\n\nDelayed growth in two German shepherd dog littermates with normal serum concentrations of growth hormone, thyroxine, and cortisol.\n\nPubMed\n\nRandolph, J F; Miller, C L; Cummings, J F; Lothrop, C D\n\n1990-01-01\n\nFour German Shepherd Dogs from a litter of 10 were evaluated because of postnatal onset of proportionate growth stunting that clinically resembled well-documented hypopituitary dwarfism in that breed. Although 2 pups had histologic evidence of hypopituitarism, the remaining 2 pups had normal serum growth hormone concentration and adrenocorticotropin secretory capability, and normal adrenal function test and thyroid function study results. Furthermore, the initially stunted German Shepherd Dogs grew at a steady rate until at 1 year, body weight and shoulder height approximated normal measurements. Seemingly, delayed growth in these pups may represent one end of a clinical spectrum associated with hypopituitarism in German Shepherd Dogs.\n\nThe leukemia inhibitory factor receptor gene is not involved in the etiology of pituitary dwarfism in German shepherd dogs.\n\nPubMed\n\nHanson, J M; Mol, J A; Leegwater, P A J; Kooistra, H S; Meij, B P\n\n2006-12-01\n\nPituitary dwarfism in German shepherd dogs is characterized by combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD) and intrapituitary cyst formation. Activation of the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-LIF receptor (LIFR) signal transduction pathway results in a similar phenotype in (transgenic) mice. We therefore assessed the role of the LIFR in the etiology of pituitary dwarfism in German shepherd dogs. A polymorphic microsatellite marker (UULIFR) was used to analyze the segregation of the LIFR gene in 22 German shepherd dogs from 4 pedigrees, each including one dwarf. There was no allelic association between UULIFR and the dwarfism phenotype. Based on our findings LIFR was excluded as a candidate gene for CPHD.\n\nVisualization of Genome Diversity in German Shepherd Dogs.\n\nPubMed\n\nMortlock, Sally-Anne; Booth, Rachel; Mazrier, Hamutal; Khatkar, Mehar S; Williamson, Peter\n\n2015-01-01\n\nA loss of genetic diversity may lead to increased disease risks in subpopulations of dogs. The canine breed structure has contributed to relatively small effective population size in many breeds and can limit the options for selective breeding strategies to maintain diversity. With the completion of the canine genome sequencing project, and the subsequent reduction in the cost of genotyping on a genomic scale, evaluating diversity in dogs has become much more accurate and accessible. This provides a potential tool for advising dog breeders and developing breeding programs within a breed. A challenge in doing this is to present complex relationship data in a form that can be readily utilized. Here, we demonstrate the use of a pipeline, known as NetView, to visualize the network of relationships in a subpopulation of German Shepherd Dogs.\n\nConcurrent central diabetes insipidus and panhypopituitarism in a German shepherd dog.\n\nPubMed\n\nRamsey, I K; Dennis, R; Herrtage, M E\n\n1999-06-01\n\nThis report describes a German shepherd dog that was presented with proportionate dwarfism and coat changes typical of hypopituitarism but that was also profoundly polydipsic and polyuric. Investigations established a diagnosis of concurrent central diabetes insipidus. Treatment with desmopressin was successful in managing the polyuria and polydipsia.\n\nComputed tomographic method for measurement of inclination angles and motion of the sacroiliac joints in German Shepherd Dogs and Greyhounds.\n\nPubMed\n\nSaunders, Fritha C; Cave, Nick J; Hartman, Karl M; Gee, Erica K; Worth, Andrew J; Bridges, Janis P; Hartman, Angela C\n\n2013-09-01\n\nTo develop an in vivo CT method to measure inclination angles and motion of the sacroiliac joints in dogs of performance breeds. 10 German Shepherd Dogs and 12 Greyhounds without signs of lumbosacral region pain or neurologic problems. CT of the ilium and sacrum was performed in flexed, neutral, and extended hind limb positions. Lines were drawn on volume-rendered images acquired in the flexed and extended positions to measure motion of the ilia relative to the sacra. Inclination angles of the synovial and ligamentous components of the sacroiliac joints were measured on transverse-plane CT images acquired at cranial and caudal locations. Coefficients of variance of measurements were calculated to determine intraobserver variability. Coefficients of variance of measurements ranged from 0.17% to 2.45%. A significantly higher amount of sacroiliac joint rotational motion was detected for German Shepherd Dogs versus Greyhounds. The cranial synovial joint component had a significantly more sagittal orientation in German Shepherd Dogs versus Greyhounds. No significant differences were detected between breeds for x- or y-axis translational motion or caudal synovial or ligamentous joint component inclination angles. The small amounts of sacroiliac joint motion detected in this study may buffer high-frequency vibrations during movement of dogs. Differences detected between breeds may be associated with the predisposition of German Shepherd Dogs to develop lumbosacral region signs of pain, although the biological importance of this finding was not determined. Future studies are warranted to compare sacroiliac joint variables between German Shepherd Dogs with and without lumbosacral region signs of pain.\n\nUreteral obstruction secondary to disseminated penicilliosis in a German shepherd dog\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAcierno, Michelle M.; Ober, Christopher P.; Goupil, Brad A.; Olson, Erik J.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAbdominal ultrasonographic evaluation of a 2-year-old male German shepherd dog evaluated for weight loss demonstrated a right ureteral mass with ipsilateral hydronephrosis, hypoechoic splenic nodules, and hypoechoic and rounded lymph nodes. A fungal mat extending from the renal pelvis into the ureter secondary to disseminated Penicillium was confirmed at necropsy. PMID:27928169\n\nDisseminated Geosmithia argillacea infection in a German shepherd dog.\n\nPubMed\n\nGrant, David C; Sutton, Deanna A; Sandberg, Christina A; Tyler, Ronald D; Thompson, Elizabeth H; Romanelli, Anna M; Wickes, Brian L\n\n2009-03-01\n\nWe report a systemic mycosis in a German Shepherd dog caused by Geosmithia argillacea. Although this etiologic agent microscopically resembles a Penicillium species, and is histopathologically compatible with members of the genus Aspergillus, morphologic features and molecular characterization clearly separate it from these genera. This appears to be the first report of disseminated disease by this species in humans or animals. In vitro antifungal susceptibility testing suggests resistance to amphotericin B and voriconazole and susceptibility to caspofungin, itraconazole, and posaconazole.\n\nImmunohistochemical evidence for expression of fast-twitch type sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA1) in German shepherd dogs with dilated cardiomyopathy myocardium.\n\nPubMed\n\nSummerfield, Nuala; Peters, Mary E; Hercock, Carol A; Mobasheri, Ali; Young, Iain S\n\n2010-04-01\n\nDilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is one of the most common acquired canine heart diseases. It is particularly common in large and giant breed dogs. Although a great deal is known about the clinical progression and manifestations of the disease, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. One widely held belief is that calcium-handling abnormalities are critically involved in the disease process. This study investigates the changes in expression of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) isoforms in DCM myocardium from German shepherd dogs. Affected tissue samples were obtained from German shepherd dogs with DCM, euthanized for intractable congestive heart failure while normal myocardial tissue samples were obtained from German shepherd dogs, euthanized for non-cardiovascular reasons. Tissue microarrays containing normal and DCM myocardium samples were prepared, immunostained with SERCA1 and SERCA2 antibodies and analyzed. We were able to demonstrate, for the first time, that while there is little change in the expression of the cardiac isoform (SERCA2), there is clear expression of the fast-twitch skeletal muscle isoform SERCA1 in the myocardium of dogs diagnosed with DCM. We propose that SERCA1 expression is evidence of a natural adaptive response to the impaired Ca2+ handling thought to occur in German shepherd dogs with DCM and heart failure.

The frequencies of patella alta and patella baja have not yet been determined. The objectives of this study were to determine the frequency of patella alta and to determine reference values to the position of the vertical patella according to two modified techniques of the Insall-Salvati method in a group of 65 German shepherd dogs (115 stifle joints). The upper limits of reference values for the normal vertical position of the patella were 1.79 and 2.13, depending on the method of measurement. A high prevalence of patella alta was observed in the group of German shepherd dogs. A correlation was demonstrated between the classification of dogs' joints in the patella alta group and the multiplied risk of canine hip dysplasia (CHD) through the estimation of odds ratios. Dogs with patella alta were healthy dogs that did not exhibit orthopaedic problems in the stifle joints. The results revealed that the risk of CHD is twice as high in dogs with higher patellar ligament length to patella length ratio.\n\nTorsion and volvulus of the transverse and descending colon in a German shepherd dog.\n\nPubMed\n\nHalfacree, Z J; Beck, A L; Lee, K C L; Lipscomb, V J\n\n2006-08-01\n\nA German shepherd dog was presented two months after surgery for correction of acute gastric dilatation volvulus. The dog had been diagnosed with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Radiographs revealed marked gaseous distension of one loop of intestine with a generalised increase in intestinal gas content. A 360 degrees anticlockwise rotation of the descending and transverse colon, around the longitudinal axis of the mesocolon, was diagnosed at exploratory coeliotomy. The transverse and descending colon appeared uniformly necrotic and an end-to-end colo-colic resection and anastomosis was performed. The dog initially made satisfactory postoperative progress but was euthanased on the third postoperative day after it developed an intestinal intussusception.\n\nCloning, characterization, and physical mapping of the canine Prop-1 gene (PROP1): exclusion as a candidate for combined pituitary hormone deficiency in German shepherd dogs.\n\nPubMed\n\nLantinga-van Leeuwen, I S; Kooistra, H S; Mol, J A; Renier, C; Breen, M; van Oost, B A\n\n2000-01-01\n\nAbnormalities in the genes encoding Pit-1 and Prop-1 have been reported to cause combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD) in mice and humans. In dogs, a similar phenotype has been described in the German shepherd breed. We have previously reported that the Pit-1 gene (POU1F1) is not mutated in affected German shepherd dogs. In this study, we report the isolation and mapping of the canine Prop-1 gene (PROP1), and we assessed the involvement of PROP1 in German shepherd dog dwarfism. The canine PROP1 gene was found to contain three exons, encoding a 226 amino acid protein. The deduced amino acid sequence was 79% and 84% homologous with the mouse and human Prop-1 protein, respectively. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, PROP1 was mapped to canine chromosome 11. Further mapping with a canine radiation hybrid panel showed co-localization with the polymorphic DNA marker AHT137. Sequence analysis of genomic DNA from dwarf German shepherd dogs revealed no alterations in the PROP1 gene. Moreover, linkage analysis of AHT137 revealed no co-segregation between the PROP1 locus and the CPHD phenotype, excluding this gene as candidate for canine CPHD and providing a new spontaneous model of hypopituitarism. Copyright 2000 S. Karger AG, Basel\n\nCharacterization of naturally developing small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in 16 German shepherd dogs.\n\nPubMed\n\nWillard, M D; Simpson, R B; Fossum, T W; Cohen, N D; Delles, E K; Kolp, D L; Carey, D P; Reinhart, G A\n\n1994-04-15\n\nSixteen German Shepherd Dogs were found, via quantitative microbial culture of intestinal fluid samples, to have small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (IBO) over an 11-month period. All dogs were deficient in serum IgA. Consistent clinical signs suggestive of an alimentary tract disorder were not observed. Serum cobalamin determinations were not helpful in detecting IBO. Serum folate concentrations had variable sensitivity and specificity for detecting dogs from which we could culture > or = 1 x 10(5) bacterial/ml from intestinal fluid samples in the nonfed state. Histologic and intestinal mucosal cytologic examinations were not useful in detecting IBO. Substantial within-dog and between-dog variation was found in the numbers and species of bacteria in the intestines. The difficulty in diagnosing IBO, the variability in organisms found in individual dogs on repeated sampling, the likelihood that intestinal fluid microbial cultures failed to diagnose IBO in some dogs, and the potential of IBO to be clinically inapparent were the most important findings in this study.\n\nAlternative classification and screening protocol for transitional lumbosacral vertebra in German shepherd dogs\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground Lumbosacral transitional vertebra (LTV) is a common congenital and hereditary anomaly in many dog breeds. It predisposes to premature degeneration of the lumbosacral junction, and is a frequent cause of cauda equina syndrome, especially in German shepherd dogs. Ventrodorsal hip radiographs are most often used in diagnosis of LTV in screening programs. In this study, value of laterolateral lumbar spine radiographs as additions to ventrodorsal radiographs in diagnosis of LTV, and characteristics of LTV and the eighth lumbar vertebra (L8) in laterolateral radiographs were studied. Additionally, computed tomography (CT) features of different types of LTV were elucidated. Methods The ventrodorsal pelvic and laterolateral lumbar spine radiographs of 228 German shepherd dogs were evaluated for existence and type of LTV. Morphology of transverse processes was used in classification of LTV in ventrodorsal radiographs. The relative length of sixth (L6) and seventh (L7) vertebrae (L6/L7) was used in characterization of these vertebrae in laterolateral radiographs. CT studies were available for 16 dogs, and they were used for more detailed characterization of different types of LTV. Non-parametric Ï2 statistics, generalized logit model for multinomial data, and one-way analysis of variance was used for statistical analyses. Results In all, 92 (40%) dogs had a LTV, the most common type being separation of first spinous process from the median crest of the sacrum in 62 dogs (67% of LTV). Eight dogs had eight lumbar vertebrae. Those dogs with LTV had longer L7 in relation to L6 than dogs with normal lumbosacral junctions. When L6/L7 decreased by 0.1 units, the proportion of dogs belonging to the group with L8 was 14-fold higher than in the group with normal lumbosacral junctions. L8 resembled first sacral vertebra (S1) in length and position and was therefore classified as one type of LTV. With CT it was shown that categorizing LTV, based on shape and visibility of\n\n3D visualization of Thoraco-Lumbar Spinal Lesions in German Shepherd Dog\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nAzpiroz, J.; Krafft, J.; Cadena, M.\n\n2006-09-08\n\nComputed tomography (CT) has been found to be an excellent imaging modality due to its sensitivity to characterize the morphology of the spine in dogs.

Worldwide, potential breeding dogs are evaluated for CHD using radiographically based screening schemes such as the nine ordinally-scored British Veterinary Association Hip Traits (BVAHTs). The effectiveness of selective breeding based on screening results requires that a significant proportion of the phenotypic variation is caused by the presence of favourable alleles segregating in the population. This proportion, heritability, was measured in a cohort of 13,124 Australian German Shepherd Dogs born between 1976 and 2005, displaying phenotypic variation for BVAHTs, using ordinal, linear and binary mixed models fitted by a Restricted Maximum Likelihood method. Heritability estimates for the nine BVAHTs ranged from 0.14-0.24 (ordinal models), 0.14-0.25 (linear models) and 0.12-0.40 (binary models). Heritability for the summed BVAHT phenotype was 0.30 Â± 0.02. The presence of heritable variation demonstrates that selection based on BVAHTs has the potential to improve BVAHT scores in the population. Assuming a genetic correlation between BVAHT scores and CHD-related pain and dysfunction, the welfare of Australian German Shepherds can be improved by continuing to consider BVAHT scores in the selection of breeding dogs, but that as heritability values are only moderate in magnitude the accuracy, and effectiveness, of selection could be improved by the use of Estimated Breeding Values in preference to solely phenotype based selection of breeding animals.\n\nSternal Cleft Associated with Cantrell's Pentalogy in a German Shepherd Dog.\n\nPubMed\n\nBenlloch-Gonzalez, Manuel; Poncet, Cyrill\n\n2015-01-01\n\nA 5 mo old male German shepherd dog weighing 15.5 kg was presented with an abdominal wall hernia and exercise intolerance. Physical examination showed a grade II/VI systolic heart murmur and an area of cutaneous atrophy overlying a midline supraumbilical wall defect. Thoracic radiography, computed tomography, and ultrasound examination revealed a congenital caudal sternal cleft, a supraumbilical diastasis rectus, and a patent ductus arteriosus. Exploratory surgery confirmed defects of the pars sternalis of the diaphragm and caudoventral pericardium and a persistent left cranial vena cava. Those findings were compatible with Cantrell's pentalogy. Surgical treatment included ligation of the patent ductus arteriosus through the sternal cleft, diaphragmatic reconstruction with paracostal extension of the diaphragmatic defect, pericardial and linea alba appositional reconstruction, and primary approximation of the sternal halves. Growth and exercise activity were normal 10 mo after surgery. The discovery of a midline cranial abdominal wall, pericardial, diaphragmatic, or sternal defect should prompt a thorough examination to rule out any possible associated syndrome. Cantrell's pentalogy presents various degrees of expression and is rare in dogs. Management involves early surgical repair of congenital anomalies to protect the visceral structures. The prognosis in dogs with mild forms of the syndrome is encouraging.\n\nCortisol and Secretory Immunoglobulin A Response to Stress in German Shepherd Dogs\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSvobodovÃ¡, Ivona; ChaloupkovÃ¡, Helena; KonÄel, Roman; BartoÅ¡, LudÄk; HradeckÃ¡, Lenka; JebavÃ½, LukÃ¡Å¡\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe aim of the study was to determine whether cortisol and secretory Immunoglobulin A (sIgA) could be used as an indicator of acute stress in both young and adult dogs. Seventeen German shepherd puppies were exposed to the Puppy test (challenge test) at the age of seven weeks. This test has been routinely used to assess the future working ability of potential police dogs. In addition, ten adult females were subjected to 4 minutes of defense training under stressful conditions. Saliva was collected from the puppies and adult females before testing and 20 minutes after the start of testing, using a cotton swab held for 1â2 minutes in each dog's mouth. Cortisol concentrations increased after the test compared to the control sample both in puppies and the adult females. However adult females showed a significant decrease in sIgA after defense training while puppies showed a tendency of increase in sIgA. We propose that salivary cortisol could be used as an indicator of stress in puppies during early ontogeny. It is not yet clear whether sIgA could be used as a useful indicator of short-term stress in dogs.

Direct empirical behavioral assessments of such differences, however, are rare and have produced mixed results. One area where breed differences are often assumed is olfaction, where German Shepherds, hounds, and Labradors are commonly used for odor-detection work, whereas toy breeds and brachycephalic dogs, such as Pugs, are not. Choice of breed for scent detection work, however, may be driven more by historical choices than data. In this article we directly assessed the ability of German Shepherds, Pugs, and Greyhounds to acquire a simple olfactory discrimination, and their ability to maintain performance when the target odorant was diluted. Our results show that contrary to expectations, Pugs significantly outperformed the German Shepherds in acquiring the odor discrimination and maintaining performance when the odorant concentration was decreased. Nine of 10 Greyhounds did not complete acquisition training because they failed a motivation criterion. These results indicate that Pugs outperformed German Shepherds in the dimensions of olfaction assessed. Greyhounds showed a general failure to participate. Overall, our results highlight the importance of direct behavioral measurement of assumed behavioral breed differences.

Retrospective case control study. Two hundred three German Shepherd dogs (GSDs); 138 police dog visits by 74 dogs and 138 pet (control) dog visits by 129 dogs. Medical records of all GSDs seen in the emergency service (ES) at the University of Pennsylvania Veterinary Hospital from July 2008 to July 2010 were reviewed. The recorded diagnoses from police GSD ES visits (defined as a new problem or new episode of a recurrent problem) were compared to those of randomly chosen pet GSD ES visits. There were significantly more intact male police GSDs than pet GSDs. Police GSDs were significantly younger than pet GSDs. The most common presenting complaint in both groups was gastrointestinal disease (eg, vomiting, diarrhea, gastric dilatation and volvulus). Pet GSDs were significantly more likely to present for geriatric conditions (eg, central nervous system disease, cardiovascular disease, and neoplastic conditions). Orthopedic issues were significantly more common in police GSDs. Police GSDs are more likely to present for orthopedic injuries and less likely to present for geriatric diseases. Gastrointestinal disease is not unique to the working GSD and was equally represented in both populations. Preventative measures for all GSDs should focus on minimizing gastrointestinal disease. Preventive strategies focusing on physical fitness and conditioning as well as selective breeding programs may help reduce orthopedic injuries in police GSDs.

Here, we show that a loss-of-function mutation in KIT recapitulates the coat color phenotypes observed in other species. A spontaneous white spotting observed in a pedigree of German Shepherd dogs was mapped by linkage analysis to a single locus on CFA13 containing KIT (pairwise LOD = 15). DNA sequence analysis identified a novel 1-bp insertion in the second exon that co-segregated with the phenotype. The expected frameshift and resulting premature stop codons predicted a severely truncated c-Kit receptor with presumably abolished activity. No dogs homozygous for the mutation were recovered from multiple intercrosses (P = 0.01), suggesting the mutation is recessively embryonic lethal. These observations are consistent with the effects of null alleles of KIT in other species.

The missense mutation SOD1:c.118G>A is associated with this pathology in several dog breeds, including the German Shepherd Dog (GSD). The aims of the present study were to develop a tool for the rapid screening of the SOD1 mutation site in dogs and to evaluate the association of the polymorphism with DM in the German Shepherd breed. Two different techniques were compared: a minisequencing test and a real-time pcr allelic discrimination assay. Both approaches resulted effective and efficient. A sample of 47 dogs were examined. Ten subjects presented the symptoms of the illness; for one of them the diagnosis was confirmed by postmortem investigations and it resulted to be an A/A homozygote. In another clinically suspected dog, heterozygote A/G, the histopathological examination of the medulla showed moderate axon and myelin degenerative changes. GSD shows a frequency of the mutant allele equal to 0.17, quite high being a high-risk allele. Because canine DM has a late onset in adulthood and homozygous mutant dogs are likely as fertile as other genotypes, the natural selection is mild and the mutant allele may reach high frequencies. A diagnostic test, easy to implement, may contribute to control the gene diffusion in populations. The SOD1:c.118G>A mutation could be a useful marker for breeding strategies intending to reduce the incidence of DM.\n\nEstimated breeding values for canine hip dysplasia radiographic traits in a cohort of Australian German Shepherd dogs.\n\nPubMed\n\nWilson, Bethany J; Nicholas, Frank W; James, John W; Wade, Claire M; Thomson, Peter C\n\n2013-01-01\n\nCanine hip dysplasia (CHD) is a serious and common musculoskeletal disease of pedigree dogs and therefore represents both an important welfare concern and an imperative breeding priority. The typical heritability estimates for radiographic CHD traits suggest that the accuracy of breeding dog selection could be substantially improved by the use of estimated breeding values (EBVs) in place of selection based on phenotypes of individuals. The British Veterinary Association/Kennel Club scoring method is a complex measure composed of nine bilateral ordinal traits, intended to evaluate both early and late dysplastic changes. However, the ordinal nature of the traits may represent a technical challenge for calculation of EBVs using linear methods. The purpose of the current study was to calculate EBVs of British Veterinary Association/Kennel Club traits in the Australian population of German Shepherd Dogs, using linear (both as individual traits and a summed phenotype), binary and ordinal methods to determine the optimal method for EBV calculation. Ordinal EBVs correlated well with linear EBVs (r = 0.90-0.99) and somewhat well with EBVs for the sum of the individual traits (r = 0.58-0.92). Correlation of ordinal and binary EBVs varied widely (r = 0.24-0.99) depending on the trait and cut-point considered. The ordinal EBVs have increased accuracy (0.48-0.69) of selection compared with accuracies from individual phenotype-based selection (0.40-0.52). Despite the high correlations between linear and ordinal EBVs, the underlying relationship between EBVs calculated by the two methods was not always linear, leading us to suggest that ordinal models should be used wherever possible. As the population of German Shepherd Dogs which was studied was purportedly under selection for the traits studied, we examined the EBVs for evidence of a genetic trend in these traits and found substantial genetic improvement over time. This study suggests the use of ordinal EBVs could increase the\n\nBilateral epididymal sperm granulomas following urethrostomy in a German shepherd dog.\n\nPubMed\n\nBatista-Arteaga, M; Santana, M; Lozano, O; NiÃ±o, T; Alamo, D; RodrÃ­guez, F\n\n2011-08-01\n\nBilateral enlargement of both epididymes was observed in a 6-year-old German shepherd dog following a pre-scrotal urethrostomy. Testicular parenchyma showed regular structure, and the spermatogenesis and the steroidogenic functions were not modified. However, macroscopic examination of the tail and the body of both epididymes exhibited multiple white and well-delimited foci. Histopathological study of the epididymes confirmed the development of granulomas associated with extravasated spermatozoa. Urethrostomy caused a severe stenosis of the penile urethra, favouring the retention of urine at the urinary bladder. The retrograde pressure exerted by the distension of the urinary bladder could have allowed the urine to reach the prostatic urethra and the deferent ducts and, finally, the epididymes, causing irritation and rupture of the mucous layer of the epididymal duct, the consequent sperm extravasation and the development of sperm granulomas. We speculate that the inadequate surgical resolution of the urethral calculi caused the bladder distension, the subsequent retrograde flow of urine and the development of the lesions.

Herein, SNP profiles for 197 GSDs were generated using the Affymetrix v2 canine SNP array for a genome-wide association study to identify loci associated with four diseases: pituitary dwarfism, degenerative myelopathy (DM), congenital megaesophagus (ME), and pancreatic acinar atrophy (PAA). A locus on Chr 9 is strongly associated with pituitary dwarfism and is proximal to a plausible candidate gene, LHX3. Results for DM confirm a major locus encompassing SOD1, in which an associated point mutation was previously identified, but do not suggest modifier loci. Several SNPs on Chr 12 are associated with ME and a 4.7 Mb haplotype block is present in affected dogs. Analysis of additional ME cases for a SNP within the haplotype provides further support for this association. Results for PAA indicate more complex genetic underpinnings. Several regions on multiple chromosomes reach genome-wide significance. However, no major locus is apparent and only two associated haplotype blocks, on Chrs 7 and 12 are observed. These data suggest that PAA may be governed by multiple loci with small effects, or it may be a heterogeneous disorder.

We investigated whether cortisol extracted from dog hair reflected the levels of activity and stress long-term, during weeks and months. Hair samples from in total 59 German shepherds were analysed. Samples for measuring cortisol concentrations were collected at three occasions and we complemented the data with individual scores from the Canine Behavioural Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ). Generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) results showed that hair cortisol varied with season and lifestyle: competition dogs had higher levels than companion, and professional working dogs, and levels were higher in January than in May and September. In addition, a positive correlation was found between the cortisol levels and the C-BARQ score for stranger-directed aggression (r = 0.31, P = 0.036). Interestingly, the factor \"playing often with the dog\" (r = -0.34, P = 0.019) and \"reward with a treat/toy when the dog behaves correctly\" (r = -0.37, P = 0.010) correlated negatively with cortisol levels, suggesting that positive human interactions reduce stress. In conclusion, hair cortisol is a promising method for revealing the activity of the HPA-axis over a longer period of time, and human interactions influence the cortisol level in dogs.\n\nA follow-up study of neurologic and radiographic findings in working German Shepherd Dogs with and without degenerative lumbosacral stenosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nSteffen, Frank; Hunold, Katharina; Scharf, Gernot; Roos, Malgorzata; FlÃ¼ckiger, Mark\n\n2007-11-15\n\nTo identify radiographic abnormalities associated with degenerative lumbosacral stenosis (DLSS) in German Shepherd Dogs (GSDs) and determine whether specific radiographic abnormalities could be used to identify dogs at risk of developing DLSS. Cohort study. 33 GSDs working as police dogs. Results of physical, neurologic, and orthopedic examinations were used to identify dogs with DLSS. Survey radiography of the lumbosacral junction was performed, and radiographs were compared with radiographs obtained 3 years earlier. DLSS was diagnosed in 15 of the 33 (45%) dogs. Thirteen of the 15 dogs with DLSS and 14 of the 18 dogs without DLSS had radiographic abnormalities of the lumbosacral junction. Twenty-two (67%) dogs were able to perform unrestricted duties, including 3 dogs with suspected DLSS. Six (18%) dogs had been excluded from active duty during the period of surveillance because of DLSS. Significant progression in specific clinical and radiographic signs was detected, but multiple logistic regression analysis did not identify any radiographic signs that could be used to predict the development of DLSS. Results suggested that survey radiography cannot be used to predict development of DLSS in working GSDs.\n\nHair cortisol varies with season and lifestyle and relates to human interactions in German shepherd dogs\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRoth, Lina S.

Using 454 pyrosequencing, we assessed the effects of pre- and postnatal probiotic supplementation (Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC533 (La1)) and analysed whether administration of the probiotic strain influenced fecal microbiota composition in a placebo controlled double-blinded study. The bitches were treated with probiotics or placebo during last trimester of pregnancy and until their puppies were 8 weeks old, the puppies received the same treatment as their mothers between 3â12 weeks of age. Samples from bitches were collected at pregnancy day 42, partum, 4 weeks postpartum and 7 weeks postpartum and from puppies at the age 4 weeks, 7 weeks, 12â13 months and 15â18 months. Serum IgA, total serum IgE, fecal IgA and IgG antibody responses against canine distemper virus were analysed by ELISA in order to detect any immune stimulating effects of the probiotic strain. Analysis of the fecal microbiota composition showed that the predominant phyla were the same in 7 weeks old puppies as in pregnant and lactating bitches (Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, Bacteroidetes). Proportions among different bacteria as well as diversity varied from 7 weeks old puppies up to 15â18 months of age. Litter mates had a more similar fecal microbiota compared to unrelated dogs and 7 weeks old puppies were more similar to their mothers than to unrelated bitches at 7 weeks postpartum but not at partum. We observed a change in the relative abundance of different bacteria during lactation, and an increase in diversity from pregnancy to end of lactation. The microbial diversity was affected by living area where dogs living in big cities had higher diversity compared to dogs living at the\n\nA case of disseminated mycosis in a German shepherd dog due to Penicillium purpurogenum.\n\nPubMed\n\nZanatta, R; Miniscalco, B; Guarro, J; GenÃ©, J; Capucchio, M T; Gallo, M G; Mikulicich, B; Peano, A\n\n2006-02-01\n\nThe genus Penicillium is among the most common contaminant fungi in the environment. Around 15 species are known to cause opportunistic human mycoses, in immunocompromised patients. Until now, Penicillium purpurogenum has been involved in only three human cases of pulmonary diseases but no infections in animals have been reported. Most disseminated mycoses in dogs are caused by members of the genus Aspergillus, with the predisposing factors in these cases being difficult to define. The case reported here involved a 4-year-old female German shepherd dog (GSD) with forelimb instability and back pain. Clinical examination showed hyperthermia, generalized lymphadenomegaly and kyphosis. Radiological findings of the spine revealed areas of discospondilitis involving thoracic and lumbar vertebrae. Microscopic observations of fine needle aspiration biopsies (FNAB) of lymph-nodes showed regular, septate, branching fungal hyphae. Itraconazole therapy was started but the subject died six days later. Disseminated necrotic areas were detected in enlarged lymph-nodes, liver and spleen. Vertebral granulomas within lytic areas in T10-T11 and L2-L3, were observed. Cultures inoculated with samples obtained from lymph-node FNAB and bioptic material from necropsied organs revealed the presence of pure cultures of Penicillium, subsequently identified as P. purpurogenum. Apart from female GSD's suspected predisposition to disseminated mycoses described in literature, no other predisposing factors were ascertained in this case.\n\nEvaluation of the rostral projection of the sacral lamina as a component of degenerative lumbosacral stenosis in German shepherd dogs.\n\nPubMed\n\nSaunders, Harvey; Worth, Andrew J; Bridges, Janis P; Hartman, Angela\n\n2018-05-20\n\nTo determine the association between a greater rostral projection of the sacral lamina and clinical signs of cauda equina syndrome (CES) in German shepherd dogs (GSD) with presumptive degenerative lumbosacral disease (DLSS). Retrospective cohort study. One hundred forty-three GSD (125 police dogs and 18 pet dogs) presenting for either CES or prebreeding evaluation. Fifty-five were classified as affected by CES and diagnosed with DLSS, and 88 were classified as unaffected on the basis of clinical and imaging findings. The position of the rostral edge of the sacral lamina was measured from radiographs and/or computed tomography (CT) scans. This position was compared between affected and unaffected dogs. In dogs that underwent both radiography and CT scanning, the agreement between sacral lamina localization using each imaging modality was determined. Owners/handlers were contacted to determine whether dogs subsequently developed clinical signs compatible with CES at a mean of 29 months (unaffected). The sacral lamina did not extend as far rostrally in affected dogs, compared to unaffected dogs (P = .04). Among the 88 dogs unaffected by CES at initial evaluation, 2 developed clinical signs consistent with CES at follow-up. Rostral projection of the sacral lamina, previously proposed as a potential risk factor in dogs with CES due to lumbosacral degeneration, was not associated with a diagnosis of DLSS in this study; the opposite was true. Rostral projection of the sacral lamina may not be a predisposing factor in the development of CES due to DLSS in GSD.

However, concerns for the health and welfare of the GSD have been widely aired and there is evidence that breed numbers are now in decline in the UK. Accurate demographic and disorder data could assist with breeding and clinical prioritisation. The VetCompass TM Programme collects clinical data on dogs under primary veterinary care in the UK. This study included all VetCompass TM dogs under veterinary care during 2013. Demographic, mortality and clinical diagnosis data on GSDs were extracted and reported. GSDs dropped from 3.5% of the annual birth cohort in 2005 to 2.2% in 2013. The median longevity of GSDs was 10.3Â years (IQR 8.0-12.1, range 0.2-17.0). The most common causes of death were musculoskeletal disorder (16.3%) and inability to stand (14.9%). The most prevalent disorders recorded were otitis externa ( n Â =Â 131, 7.89, 95% CI: 6.64-9.29), osteoarthritis (92, 5.54%, 95% CI: 4.49-6.75), diarrhoea (87, 5.24%, 95% CI: 4.22-6.42), overweight/obesity (86, 5.18%, 95% CI: 4.16-6.36) and aggression (79, 4.76%, 95% CI: 3.79-5.90). This study identified that GSDs have been reducing in numbers in the UK in recent years. The most frequent disorders in GSDs were otitis externa, osteoarthritis, diarrhoea, overweight/obesity and aggression, whilst the most common causes of death were musculoskeletal disorders and inability to stand. Aggression was more prevalent in males than in females. These results may assist veterinarians to offer evidence-based advice at a breed level and help to identify priorities for GSD health that can improve the breed's health and welfare.\n\nAge-related changes in the articular cartilage of the stifle joint in non-working and working German Shepherd dogs.\n\nPubMed\n\nFrancuski, J V; RadovanoviÄ, A; AndriÄ, N; KrstiÄ, V; BogdanoviÄ, D; HadziÄ, V; TodoroviÄ, V; LazareviÄ MacanoviÄ, M; Sourice Petit, S; Beck-Cormier, S; Guicheux, J; Gauthier, O; KovaceviÄ FilipoviÄ, M\n\n2014-11-01\n\nThe aims of this study were to define age-related histological changes in the articular cartilage of the stifle joint in non-chondrodystrophic dogs and to determine whether physical activity has a positive impact on preservation of cartilage structure during ageing. Twenty-eight German shepherd dogs were included in the study. These dogs had no evidence of joint inflammation as defined by clinical assessment, radiology and synovial fluid analysis (specifically absence of synovial fluid serum amyloid A). The dogs were grouped as young working (n Â¼ 4), young non-working (n Â¼ 5), aged working (n Â¼ 13) and aged non-working (n Â¼ 6) animals. Gross changes in the stifle joints were recorded and biopsy samples of femoral and tibial articular cartilage were evaluated for thickness; chondrocyte number, density, surface area and morphology; isogenous group morphology; tidemark integrity; subchondral bone structure; presence of proteoglycans/ glycosaminoglycans; and expression of type I, II and X collagens. The major age-related changes, not related to type of physical activity, included elevated chondrocyte density and thinning of tibial cartilage and increased chondrocyte surface area in the superficial and intermediate zone of the femoral cartilage. There was also expression of type X collagen in the femoral and tibial calcified and non-calcified cartilage; however, type X collagen was not detected in the superficial zone of old working dogs. Therefore, ageing, with or without physical activity, leads to slight cartilage degeneration, while physical activity modulates the synthesis of type X collagen in the superficial cartilage zone, partially preserving the structure of hyaline cartilage. 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

As shepherds and guarding dogs are most commonly used to curb carnivore attacks on grazing livestock, evaluation and improvement of these practices becomes an important task. We addressed this issue by studying individual leopard (Panthera pardus) attacks on sheep and goats in 34 villages near Golestan National Park, Iran. We obtained and analyzed data on 39 attacks, which included a total loss of 31 sheep and 36 goats in 17 villages. We applied non-parametric testing, Poisson Generalized Linear Modelling (GLM) and model selection to assess how numbers of sheep and goats killed per attack are associated with the presence and absence of shepherds and dogs during attacks, depredation in previous years, villages, seasons, ethnic groups, numbers of sheep and goats kept in villages, and distances from villages to the nearest protected areas. We found that 95.5% of losses were inflicted in forests when sheep and goats were accompanied by shepherds (92.5% of losses) and dogs (77.6%). Leopards tended to kill more sheep and goats per attack (surplus killing) when dogs were absent in villages distant from protected areas, but still inflicted most losses when dogs were present, mainly in villages near protected areas. No other variables affected numbers of sheep and goats killed per attack. These results indicate that local husbandry practices are ineffectual and the mere presence of shepherds and guarding dogs is not enough to secure protection. Shepherds witnessed leopard attacks, but could not deter them while dogs did not exhibit guarding behavior and were sometimes killed by leopards.

In this study we aimed to estimate and compare the genetic diversity of four native Italian shepherd dog breeds: the Maremma, Bergamasco, Lupino del Gigante and Oropa shepherds. Therefore, some cosmopolitan dog breeds, which have been widely raised in Italy for a long time past, have also been considered to check possible influence of these dog populations on the Italian autochthonous breeds considered here. A total of 212 individuals, belonging to 10 different dog breeds, were sampled and genotyped using 18 autosomal microsatellite loci. We analyzed the genetic diversity of these breeds, within breed diversity, breed relationship and population structure. The 10 breeds considered in this study were clearly genetically differentiated from each other, regardless of current population sizes and the onset of separate breeding history. The level of genetic diversity explained 20% of the total genetic variation. The level of H E found here is in agreement with that found by other studies. The native Italian breeds showed generally higher genetic diversity compared with the long established, well-defined cosmopolitan dog breeds. As the Border Collie seems closer to the Italian breeds than the other cosmopolitan shepherd dogs considered here, a possible utilization of this breed to improve working performance in Italian traditional working shepherd dogs cannot be ignored. The data and information found here can be utilized in the organization of conservation programs planned to reduce inbreeding and to minimize loss of genetic variability.\n\nThe Shepherds' Tale: A Genome-Wide Study across 9 Dog Breeds Implicates Two Loci in the Regulation of Fructosamine Serum Concentration in Belgian Shepherds.\n\nPubMed\n\nForsberg, Simon K G; Kierczak, Marcin; Ljungvall, Ingrid; Merveille, Anne-Christine; Gouni, Vassiliki; Wiberg, Maria; Lundgren Willesen, Jakob; HanÃ¥s, Sofia; LequarrÃ©, Anne-Sophie; Mejer SÃ¸rensen, Louise; Tiret, Laurent; McEntee, Kathleen; SeppÃ¤lÃ¤, Eija; Koch, JÃ¸rgen; Battaille, GÃ©raldine; Lohi, Hannes; Fredholm, Merete; Chetboul, Valerie; HÃ¤ggstrÃ¶m, Jens; Carlborg, Ãrjan; Lindblad-Toh, Kerstin; HÃ¶glund, Katja\n\n2015-01-01\n\nDiabetes mellitus is a serious health problem in both dogs and humans. Certain dog breeds show high prevalence of the disease, whereas other breeds are at low risk. Fructosamine and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) are two major biomarkers of glycaemia, where serum concentrations reflect glucose turnover over the past few weeks to months. In this study, we searched for genetic factors influencing variation in serum fructosamine concentration in healthy dogs using data from nine dog breeds. Considering all breeds together, we did not find any genome-wide significant associations to fructosamine serum concentration. However, by performing breed-specific analyses we revealed an association on chromosome 3 (pcorrected â 1:68 Ã 10-6) in Belgian shepherd dogs of the Malinois subtype. The associated region and its close neighbourhood harbours interesting candidate genes such as LETM1 and GAPDH that are important in glucose metabolism and have previously been implicated in the aetiology of diabetes mellitus. To further explore the genetics of this breed specificity, we screened the genome for reduced heterozygosity stretches private to the Belgian shepherd breed. This revealed a region with reduced heterozygosity that shows a statistically significant interaction (p = 0.025) with the association region on chromosome 3. This region also harbours some interesting candidate genes and regulatory regions but the exact mechanisms underlying the interaction are still unknown. Nevertheless, this finding provides a plausible explanation for breed-specific genetic effects for complex traits in dogs. Shepherd breeds are at low risk of developing diabetes mellitus. The findings in Belgian shepherds could be connected to a protective mechanism against the disease. Further insight into the regulation of glucose metabolism could improve diagnostic and therapeutic methods for diabetes mellitus.\n\nDisseminated opportunistic fungal disease in dogs: 10 cases (1982-1990).\n\nPubMed\n\nWatt, P R; Robins, G M; Galloway, A M; O'Boyle, D A\n\n1995-07-01\n\nMedical records of 10 dogs in which fungal infection was diagnosed between 1982 and 1990 were reviewed. In each dog, infection was determined to be caused by a single species of fungus, either Aspergillus terreus, Penicillium sp, Paecilomyces sp, Chrysosporium sp, or Pseudallescheria boydii. Nine dogs were German Shepherd Dogs; 1 was a German Shepherd Dog cross, and 9 were females. The most common clinical signs were signs of neck or back pain (9 dogs), weight loss (7 dogs), anorexia (6 dogs), pyrexia (6 dogs), paresis (3 dogs), and paralysis (3 dogs). All 10 dogs had evidence of multiple sites of diskospondylitis. Urine sediment was examined in 6 dogs, and all 6 had fungal hyphae. Urine samples from these dogs produced a medium to heavy pure growth of fungi when placed on Sabaraud's medium. Predisposing causes were not identified in any of the dogs. Four dogs were euthanatized immediately after diagnosis because of paralysis or paresis. The other 6 dogs were treated, and 4 of the 6 received itraconazole. One dog was euthanatized for an unrelated problem after 21 months of treatment; 1 dog was still alive after 4 years of continuous treatment with itraconazole. The other 4 dogs were euthanatized because of eventual paralysis or paresis. Our results suggest that German Shepherd Dogs are predisposed to infection with opportunistic fungi, possibly because of a specific inability to mount an effective response. This predisposition needs to be further studied.\n\nMeasurement of messenger RNA encoding the alpha-chain, polymeric immunoglobulin receptor, and J-chain in duodenal mucosa from dogs with and without chronic diarrhea by use of quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays.\n\nPubMed\n\nPeters, Iain R; Helps, Chris R; Calvert, Emma L; Hall, Edward J; Day, Michael J\n\n2005-01-01\n\nTo examine the difference in expression of messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts for polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (plgR), alpha-chain, and J-chain determined by use of quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) assays in duodenal biopsy specimens obtained from dogs with and without chronic diarrhea. Biopsy specimens of the proximal portion of the duodenum were obtained endoscopically from 39 dogs evaluated because of chronic diarrhea (12 German Shepherd Dogs and 27 non-German Shepherd Dog breeds); specimens were also obtained from a control group of 7 dogs evaluated because of other gastrointestinal tract diseases and 2 dogs that were euthanatized as a result of nongastrointestinal tract disease. Dogs were anesthetized, and multiple mucosal biopsy specimens were obtained endoscopically at the level of the caudal duodenal flexure by use of biopsy forceps; in 2 control dogs, samples were obtained from the descending duodenum within 5 minutes of euthanasia. One-step QRT-PCR was used to quantify the level of expression of transcripts for the housekeeper gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, plgR, alpha-chain, and J-chain in duodenal mucosal tissue. There was no significant difference in the level of expression of any transcript among non-German Shepherd Dog breeds without diarrhea (control group), non-German Shepherd Dog breeds with chronic diarrhea, and German Shepherd Dogs with chronic diarrhea. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Results indicated that the susceptibility of German Shepherd Dogs to chronic diarrhea is not a result of simple failure of transcription of the key genes that encode molecules involved in mucosal IgA secretion.\n\nA review of official data obtained from dog control records generated by the dog control service of county cork, Ireland during 2007\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground There are no peer reviewed data on dog control records from an official agency in Ireland. In order to address this, a total of 2,669 official dog control service records generated during 2007 by Cork County Council dog control service were reviewed. Results Over 70 percent of records related to unwanted dogs and dogs not under their owners control. Stray dogs were collected by the service regularly throughout the year but with notable increase in voluntary surrenders by owners from January through to April. The majority of dogs collected or surrendered were male (2:1 ratio), of medium size, described as having a friendly temperament and were not wearing a neck collar. The Crossbreed and Greyhound breeds were more frequently collected as strays, while Greyhounds and German Shepherds were more frequently voluntarily surrendered by their owner. Restricted breeds such as Pit Bull terriers, German Shepherds and Rottweilers were more frequently reported by members of the public for aggressive behaviour while the only restricted breed reported for biting or snapping was the German Shepherd. Conclusions Routine recording of dog control services in County Cork provide data on responsible dog ownership including the licensing of breeds, and surrender of owned dogs and the collection of stray dogs. Data capture and utilisation of dog control services by local authorities has potential to inform policy on responsible dog ownership and education programmes.

Investigation of pattern recognition receptor (PRR) function has suggested that defective responses might occur in AF-affected GSD. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether canine PRR genes are involved in determining susceptibility to AF in this breed. Chromosomal location and coding sequences for NOD1, NOD2, TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6 and TLR9 were determined and microsatellite markers identified for each gene. Microsatellite genotyping of 100 control GSD and 47 AF-affected GSD showed restricted allelic variation for AHT H91 (associated with TLR5) and REN216 NO5 (associated with both TLR1 and TLR6) compared with non-GSD dogs. Genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms identified in canine TLR1, TLR5, TLR6 and NOD2 genes failed to show any significant associations between PRR polymorphisms and AF. The highly restricted PRR genotypes seen in GSD are likely to have resulted from selective breeding and might influence innate immune responses in this breed.\n\nEvaluation of serum cobalamin concentrations in dogs of 164 dog breeds (2006-2010).\n\nPubMed\n\nGrÃ¼tzner, Niels; Cranford, Shannon M; Norby, Bo; Suchodolski, Jan S; Steiner, JÃ¶rg M\n\n2012-11-01\n\nAltered serum cobalamin concentrations have been observed in dogs with gastrointestinal disorders such as exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) or gastrointestinal inflammation. The aims of the current study were 1) to identify breeds with a higher proportion of dogs with a decreased serum cobalamin concentration, 2) to determine whether dogs with such decreased concentrations tend to have serum canine trypsin-like immunoreactivity (cTLI) concentrations diagnostic for EPI, and 3) to compare the number of submissions for serum cobalamin analysis by breed to the American Kennel Club (AKC) breed ranking list of 2009. In this retrospective study, results of 28,675 cobalamin tests were reviewed. Akitas, Chinese Shar-Peis, German Shepherd Dogs, Greyhounds, and Labrador Retrievers had increased proportions of serum cobalamin concentrations below the lower limit of the reference interval (<251 ng/l; all P < 0.0001). Akitas, Chinese Shar-Peis, German Shepherd Dogs, and Border Collies had increased proportions of serum cobalamin concentrations below the detection limit of the assay (<150 ng/l; all P < 0.0001). Akitas, Border Collies, and German Shepherd Dogs with serum cobalamin concentrations <150 ng/l were more likely to have a serum cTLI concentration considered diagnostic for EPI (â¤2.5 Âµg/l; all P â¤ 0.001). The breed with the highest proportion of samples submitted for serum cobalamin analysis in comparison with the AKC ranking list was the Greyhound (odds ratio: 84.6; P < 0.0001). In Akitas and Border Collies, further investigations are warranted to clarify if a potentially breed-specific gastrointestinal disorder is responsible for the increased frequency of decreased serum cobalamin and cTLI concentrations.\n\nGastroesophageal junction of Anatolian shepherd dog; a study by topographic anatomy, scanning electron and light microscopy.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlsafy, M A M; El-Gendy, S A A\n\n2012-03-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to cast a spotlight on the topography and to point out the clinical importance of the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) in Anatolian Shepherd dogs. Nine Anatolian Shepherd dogs were used to study the morphology of the GEJ. The esophagus was appeared has a portion within the thoracic cavity while no portion of the esophagus presented within the abdominal cavity that documented the absence of the intra-abdominal portion in all studied dogs. The topographic anatomy, scanning electron and light microscopic examinations revealed that the gastroesophageal junction was located at the level of the phrenico-esophageal ligament (PEL) inside the esophageal hiatus. Our results were distinguished the morphology of the esophageal and gastric cardiac mucosa at the level of the gastroesophageal junction by the scanning electron micrographs. The light microscopical examination was explained the PEL attached to the esophageal side in one dog and to the gastric cardiac side in three dogs.\n\nIntraocular osteosarcoma in a dog.\n\nPubMed\n\nvan de Sandt, R R O M; BoevÃ©, M H; Stades, F C; Kik, M J L; Kirpensteijn, J\n\n2004-07-01\n\nA 10-year-old German shepherd dog was presented with unilateral uveitis and hyphaema.

Previously, a genome-wide significant risk locus on canine chromosome 27 for CAD was identified in German shepherd dogs (GSDs) and Plakophilin-2 (PKP2) was defined as the top candidate gene. PKP2 constitutes a crucial component of desmosomes and also is important in signalling, metabolic and transcriptional activities. The main objective was to evaluate the role of PKP2 in CAD by investigating PKP2 expression and desmosome structure in nonlesional skin from CAD-affected (carrying the top GWAS SNP risk allele) and healthy GSDs. We also aimed at defining the cell types in the skin that express PKP2 and its intracellular location. Skin biopsies were collected from nine CAD-affected and five control GSDs. The biopsies were frozen for immunofluorescence and fixed for electron microscopy immunolabelling and morphology. We observed the novel finding of PKP2 expression in dendritic cells and T cells in dog skin. Moreover, we detected that PKP2 was more evenly expressed within keratinocytes compared to its desmosomal binding-partner plakoglobin. PKP2 protein was located in the nucleus and on keratin filaments attached to desmosomes. No difference in PKP2 abundance between CAD cases and controls was observed. Plakophilin-2 protein in dog skin is expressed in both epithelial and immune cells; based on its subcellular location its functional role is implicated in both nuclear and structural processes.

Evidence is presented that the colour is due to the dominant yellow allele (Ay) of the agouti locus. Two other frequent colours are white spotting, due to the piebald allele (sp), and the chinchilla allele (ch). Two rarer colours are the agouti wolf-grey wild type (A+) and a light fawn with a blue facial mask, due to the dilution allele (d).\n\nDog sperm head morphometry: its diversity and evolution.\n\nPubMed\n\nSoler, Carles; Alambiaga, Ana; MartÃ­, Maria A; GarcÃ­a-Molina, Almudena; Valverde, Anthony; Contell, JesÃºs; Campos, Marcos\n\n2017-01-01\n\nDogs have been under strong artificial selection as a consequence of their relationship with man. Differences between breeds are evident that could be reflected in seminal characteristics. The present study was to evaluate differences in sperm head morphometry between seven well-defined breeds of dog: the British Bulldog, Chihuahua, German Shepherd, Labrador Retriever, Spanish Mastiff, Staffordshire Terrier, and Valencian Rat Hunting dog. Semen samples were obtained by masturbation and smears stained with Diff-Quik. Morphometric analysis (CASA-Morph) produced four size and four shape parameters. Length, Ellipticity, and Elongation showed higher differences between breeds. MANOVA revealed differences among all breeds. Considering the whole dataset, principal component analysis (PCA) showed that PC1 was related to head shape and PC2 to size. Procluster analysis showed the British Bulldog to be the most isolated breed, followed by the German Shepherd. The PCA breed by breed showed the Chihuahua, Labrador Retriever, Spanish Mastiff, and Staffordshire Terrier to have PC1 related to shape and PC2 to size, whereas the British Bulldog, Valencia Rat Hunting dog, and German Shepherd had PC1 related to size and PC2 to shape. The dendrogram for cluster groupings and the distance between them showed the British Bulldog to be separated from the rest of the breeds. Future work on dog semen must take into account the large differences in the breeds' sperm characteristics. The results provide a base for future work on phylogenetic and evolutionary studies of dogs, based on their seminal characteristics.\n\nDog sperm head morphometry: its diversity and evolution\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSoler, Carles; Alambiaga, Ana; MartÃ­, Maria A; GarcÃ­a-Molina, Almudena; Valverde, Anthony; Contell, JesÃºs; Campos, Marcos\n\n2017-01-01\n\nDogs have been under strong artificial selection as a consequence of their relationship with man.

We localized the recessively inherited defect by a genome wide approach to a region on chromosome 9 with a lod score of 9.8. The region contains LHX3, which codes for a transcription factor essential for pituitary development. Dwarfs have a deletion of one of six 7 bp repeats in intron 5 of LHX3, reducing the intron size to 68 bp. One dwarf was compound heterozygous for the deletion and an insertion of an asparagine residue in the DNA-binding homeodomain of LHX3, suggesting involvement of the gene in the disorder. An exon trapping assay indicated that the shortened intron is not spliced efficiently, probably because it is too small. We applied bisulfite conversion of cytosine to uracil in RNA followed by RT-PCR to analyze the splicing products. The aberrantly spliced RNA molecules resulted from either skipping of exon 5 or retention of intron 5. The same splicing defects were observed in cDNA derived from the pituitary of dwarfs. A survey of similarly mutated introns suggests that there is a minimal distance requirement between the splice donor and branch site of 50 nucleotides. In conclusion, a contraction of a DNA repeat in intron 5 of canine LHX3 leads to deficient splicing and is associated with pituitary dwarfism.\n\nA Contracted DNA Repeat in LHX3 Intron 5 Is Associated with Aberrant Splicing and Pituitary Dwarfism in German Shepherd Dogs\n\nPubMed Central\n\nVoorbij, Annemarie M.

PMID:22132174\n\nUnusual injury pattern in a case of postmortem animal depredation by a domestic German shepherd.\n\nPubMed\n\nTsokos, M; Schulz, F; PÃ¼schel, K\n\n1999-09-01\n\nA case is presented of a 38-year-old woman with skeletization of the head, neck, and collar region and a circumscribed 26-cm x 19-cm defect on the left chest with sole removal of the heart through the opened pericardium but undamaged mediastinum and lungs. The injuries showed V-shaped puncture wounds and superficial claw-induced scratches adjacent to the wound margins that have been described as typical for postmortem animal depredation of carnivore origin and derived from postmortem animal damage by the woman's domestic German shepherd. The circumscribed destruction of the left chest with unusual opening of the pericardium is explained by the physiognomy of the muzzle of the German shepherd and differs from previous reports. Any case presented as postmortem animal mutilation should be viewed with skepticism and undergo a full autopsy.\n\nA genealogical survey of Australian registered dog breeds.\n\nPubMed\n\nShariflou, Mohammad R; James, John W; Nicholas, Frank W; Wade, Claire M\n\n2011-08-01\n\nBreeding practices were analysed for 32 registered dog breeds representing very small registries (120 Central Asian shepherd dogs) through to very large registries (252,521 German shepherd dogs) in Australia. The vast majority (91%) of registered kennels in Australia that were sampled did not regularly employ either close breeding or popular sire usage in their kennels and the weighted mean inbreeding coefficient of Australian pedigree dogs was <5%. Australian breed mean inbreeding coefficients ranged from 0% (Central Asian shepherd dog) to 10.1% (Bichon Frise). Breed effective population sizes ranged from 26 (Ibizan hound) to 1090 (Golden retriever), comparable with other species of domesticated animals. The relatively low levels of inbreeding suggest that pedigree dog disorders are unlikely to arise frequently from the use of popular sires or close breeding in Australian registered dog breeds. It is possible that deleterious allele fixation might be driven by founder effects, genetic drift or adverse selection practices, which were not assessed in this analysis. European popular sire definitions should be revisited for rare breeds. Copyright Â© 2011.

The goal was to determine possible reproductive hormone specificities related to the GSD breed. Furthermore, the effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA)-treatment in non-pregnant Beagles and of progesterone supplementation in pregnant Beagles on the hormone concentrations were examined. Mean concentrations of progesterone and prolactin were not different in the non-pregnant Beagles compared with those seen in non-pregnant GSD, except at days 50-60, when progesterone concentrations were found to be higher in Beagles (p < 0.05). Mean progesterone concentrations in pregnant Beagles at days 50-60 after ovulation (day 0) were higher (p < 0.05) than in GSD at that time, but not at earlier time periods. Prolactin concentrations were higher (p < 0.05) in Beagles throughout pregnancy compared with those in the GSD. Mean relaxin concentrations were numerically but not significantly lower in GSD than in Beagles throughout pregnancy. A 10-day oral MPA treatment did not affect progesterone or prolactin secretion in normocyclic non-pregnant Beagles. Medroxyprogesterone acetate serum concentrations were approximately 3.9 ng/ml during treatment and decreased to 0.42 and 0.021 ng/ml within 5 and 15 days after end of treatment, respectively. Intramuscular progesterone supplementation from days 30 to 40 in pregnant Beagles resulted in higher concentrations of progesterone in the 36- to 45-day time periods; prolactin and relaxin concentrations were not significantly affected during or after treatment compared with administration of placebo. The results suggest a tendency towards deficient luteal function in the short-cycle GSD bitches previously studied, which in pregnancy may reflect the observed decreased prolactin\n\nPolymorphisms in the TLR4 and TLR5 gene are significantly associated with inflammatory bowel disease in German shepherd dogs.\n\nPubMed\n\nKathrani, Aarti; House, Arthur; Catchpole, Brian; Murphy, Angela; German, Alex; Werling, Dirk; Allenspach, Karin\n\n2010-12-23\n\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is considered to be the most common cause of vomiting and diarrhoea in dogs, and the German shepherd dog (GSD) is particularly susceptible. The exact aetiology of IBD is unknown, however associations have been identified between specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and human IBD. However, to date, no genetic studies have been undertaken in canine IBD. The aim of this study was to investigate whether polymorphisms in canine TLR 2, 4 and 5 genes are associated with IBD in GSDs. Mutational analysis of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR5 was performed in 10 unrelated GSDs with IBD. Four non-synonymous SNPs (T23C, G1039A, A1571T and G1807A) were identified in the TLR4 gene, and three non-synonymous SNPs (G22A, C100T and T1844C) were identified in the TLR5 gene. The non-synonymous SNPs identified in TLR4 and TLR5 were evaluated further in a case-control study using a SNaPSHOT multiplex reaction. Sequencing information from 55 unrelated GSDs with IBD were compared to a control group consisting of 61 unrelated GSDs. The G22A SNP in TLR5 was significantly associated with IBD in GSDs, whereas the remaining two SNPs were found to be significantly protective for IBD. Furthermore, the two SNPs in TLR4 (A1571T and G1807A) were in complete linkage disequilibrium, and were also significantly associated with IBD. The TLR5 risk haplotype (ACC) without the two associated TLR4 SNP alleles was significantly associated with IBD, however the presence of the two TLR4 SNP risk alleles without the TLR5 risk haplotype was not statistically associated with IBD. Our study suggests that the three TLR5 SNPs and two TLR4 SNPs; A1571T and G1807A could play a role in the pathogenesis of IBD in GSDs. Further studies are required to confirm the functional importance of these polymorphisms in the pathogenesis of this disease.\n\nMicrosatellite loci analysis for the genetic variability and the parentage test of five dog breeds in South Korea.\n\nPubMed\n\nKang, Byeong-Teck; Kim, Kyung-Seok; Min, Mi-Sook; Chae, Young-Jin; Kang, Jung-Won; Yoon, Junghee; Choi, Jihye; Seong, Je-Kyung; Park, Han-Chan; An, Junghwa; Lee, Mun-Han; Park, Hee-Myung; Lee, Hang\n\n2009-06-01\n\nTo investigate the population structure of five dog breeds in South Korea and to validate polymorphic microsatellite markers for the parentage test, microsatellite loci analyses were conducted for two Korean native dog breeds, Poongsan and Jindo, and three imported dog breeds, German Shepherd, Beagle and Greyhound. Overall genetic diversity was high across all dog breeds (expected heterozygosity range: 0.71 to 0.85), although breeds differed in deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). Significant reduction of heterozygosity in the Poongsan and Greyhound breeds was caused by non-random mating and population substructure within these breeds (the Wahlund effects). The close relationship and high degree of genetic diversity for two Korean native dog breeds were substantial. The mean polymorphism information content value was highest in Jindos (0.82) and Poongsans (0.81), followed by Beagles (0.74), Greyhounds (0.72), and German Shepherds (0.66). Accumulated exclusion power values, as an indication of marker validity for parentage tests, were varied but very high across breeds, 0.9999 for Jindos, Poongsans, and Beagles, 0.9997 for Greyhounds, and 0.9995 for German Shepherds. Taken together, the microsatellite loci investigated in this study can serve as suitable markers for the parentage test and as individual identification to establish a reliable pedigree verification system of dog breeds in South Korea. This study also stresses that the population subdivision within breeds can become an important cause of deviation from HWE in dog breeds.\n\nHypospadias Is Not Rare in Dogs: Five New Cases, a Retrospective Study, and a Review of the Literature.\n\nPubMed\n\nSwitonski, Marek; Dzimira, Stanislaw; Aleksiewicz, Roman; Szczerbal, Izabela; Nowacka-Woszuk, Joanna; Krzeminska, Paulina; Deska, Tomasz; Nizanski, Wojciech\n\n2018-06-13\n\nHypospadias, the abnormal position of the urethral orifice, is considered a rare congenital malformation of the reproductive organs in male dogs. We present 5 new cases of hypospadias - 2 of the penile type in German Shepherd Dogs and 3 perineal types in a Bavarian Mountain Hound, a French Bulldog, and an American Staffordshire Terrier. Other abnormalities (rudimentary or underdeveloped penis, incompletely formed preputial sheath, and bilateral cryptorchidism) were also observed. Molecular analysis of all cases revealed the presence of Y-linked genes (SRY and ZFY). Cytogenetic and histological analysis could be performed for only 2 cases: a normal male sex chromosome complement (78,XY) and spermatogenetically inactive testicles were observed. A retrospective search for hypospadias in 19,950 medical records of male dogs from a single veterinary clinic in Poland (2006-2017) was also performed. Altogether, 10 reports of penile hypospadias were found (0.05%). The majority of the reports concerned German Shepherd Dogs (8 cases among 1,511 male dogs of this breed), and thus, the estimated incidence of hypospadias in this breed was 0.5%. Moreover, we performed a review of 26 cases of canine hypospadias reported in the years 2004-2017.
