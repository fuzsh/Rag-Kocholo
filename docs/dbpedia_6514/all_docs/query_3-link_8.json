        "text": "Net Viewer describes itself as an opportunity for users to expand their ability to surf the Web. This program gives users a wealth of options for customizing their Internet experience, but many of these may hinder and not help Web surfing.\n\nNet Viewer instantly tries to help users get familiar with the program. Two windows immediately open up, one being Net Viewer, and another providing helpful tips to getting started. Net Viewer has a basic interface that looks a little dull, since it lacks sleek graphics. It includes a large empty area for showcasing saved Web sites and a short bar of icons for various commands above that. Users are shown a list of the different windows they have saved once they begin, up to 50, in fact. In addition, there are filters and queries that can be run once the Web sites begin piling on top of one another.\n\nWhile the program does easily and intuitively open multiple Internet Explorers, the additional options are quite confusing. The query option has many boxes and parameters that will not make sense to most users and will probably go unused. The program does offer helpful tips to move forward for those intent on using Net Viewer, but this isn't a program most users will pick up in a few quick sessions.\n\nNet Viewer is a program with a limited appeal to online surfers. Most Web browsers allow users to open multiple windows and save them as favorites. This 45-day trial's lone unique feature, its filters and queries, prove so confusing that we cannot recommend this download except to users with a lot of patience and knowledge on the subject."
