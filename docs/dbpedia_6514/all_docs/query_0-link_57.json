Do the\n\nfollowing:\n\n1) Stop the snmpd daemon\n\n2) From a Unix prompt, get the output of hostname <enter>.\n\n3) Find out what is the ip address that is associated with this ip address.\n\n4) Add the following line to \"snmpd.conf\" with the ip address. For example:\n\nsmux 0.0 \"\" 123.456.789.011\n\n5) Restart the snmpd daemon and make sure any errors are gone. The exception\n\nerror should no longer appear in the \"snmpd.log\" (the other 2 lines are ok).\n\n6) Now turn off logging so the file won't fill up:\n\n7) Remark out all the logging lines in the \"snmpd.conf\" file.\n\n8) Stop and restart the snmpd daemon.\n\nIn case you are using a 3rd party app that uses SNMP with this native snmpd,\n\nturning off logging will only mean that the server will stop logging to the\n\nsnmpd.log file, but the 3rd party app will still report errors in case there\n\nare any problems with SNMP communication.\n\nThe SMUX multiplexer needs to be aware of itself in order to succesfully\n\nsend the information about the SNMP queries and traps.\n\nWithout this information, the SNMP system processes will generate warnings,\n\nsince they are operating 'in the dark'.\n\n\"raver\" <b...@pobox.com> wrote in message\n\nnews:cabbe869.02010...@posting.google.com...\n\n\n\non www.google.com I found this discussion about your problem\n\n\"\n\nHi Leslie,\n\nno box has an ATM-Adapter but on the falling box the muxatmd daemon is\n\nstarted.

There may be several.\n\nI would turn on the logging level in snmpd to 3 so you can get a trace of\n\nall activity.\n\nTrapgend is a SMUX peer, which requires entries in the snmpd.peers file to\n\nmatch those in snmpd.conf, otherwise the open will be rejected with the\n\nsort of message you see here. But I don't know how you could get a logon\n\nfrom trapgend with a community name of \"risc6000public.1.1\" since it is\n\nhard coded internally as \"nv6000\", so this looks like a failure from some\n\nother process/daemon trying to open a connection to snmpd.\n\nJames Shanks\n\nTivoli (NetView for UNIX) L3 Support\n\n\"Brunschede, Gerd\" <Gerd.Br...@HIK.FZK.DE> on 01/13/99 09:29:46 AM\n\nPlease respond to Discussion of IBM NetView and POLYCENTER Manager on\n\nNetView <NV...@UCSBVM.UCSB.EDU>\n\nTo: NV...@UCSBVM.UCSB.EDU\n\ncc: (bcc: James Shanks)\n\nSubject: AuthenticationFailure\n\nHi,\n\nI have a strange problem and need some help.\n\nWe have four SP-Nodes with exactely the same /etc/snmpd.conf-file.\n\nThe same Community-Names are defined on the Nodes and the server.\n\nOn the Nodes I have started the trapgend und the snmpd.\n\nOnly on one node I get the Event-message\n\nIncorrect Community Name (authenticationFailure Trap) public\n\nIf I look to the file /usr/tmp/snmpd.log I see the following message\n\nEXEPTIONS: simpleOpen rejected (badIdentity): risc6000public.1.1 (SMUX\n\n127.0.0.1.2230+6)\n\nWhere does this come from and how can I solve this problem?\n\nThanks in Advance\n\nGerd Brunschede\n\nForschungszentrum Karlsruhe GmbH\n\nHIK\n\nHermann-von-Helmholtz-Platz 1\n\n76344 Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen\n\nTel.: +49 7247 82-5637\n\nFax: +49 7247 82-4972\n\ne-mail: gerd.br...@hik.fzk.de\n\n\"\"\"\n\nLaurent CROUX"
