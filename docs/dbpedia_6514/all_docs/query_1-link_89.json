        "text": "With Accessory Software’s InfoMan, a tool that I recently reviewed, you can manage contacts, scheduled events, notes, and emails.\n\nWith Accessory Software’s Net Viewer, a tool that I am going to review right now, you can save web addresses and manage saved web addresses; you can also use the tool to save and manage email addresses.\n\nNet Viewer provides support for Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8. Little time and effort will go into getting Net Viewer up and running on a PC powered by any of these Windows editions. You will just have to complete a simple, standard installation procedure. Even novices will quickly get Net Viewer up and running on their PCs.\n\nPlease note that Net Viewer is not free, it is only free to try. When you’re done with the installation and you launch the application, you are asked to purchase a license or activate your Net Viewer copy if you already purchased a license. If you don’t want to purchase a license just yet, you can use the Net Viewer trial version for free for 30 days.\n\nAfter that you will be asked to sign into a Net Viewer database. The nice thing here is that Net Viewer comes with a sample database. By loading this sample database the application’s interface will be populated with info and thus you will get a quick idea of what can be done with Net Viewer. Speaking about Net Viewer’s interface, it must be noted that the interface features multiple styles. From the Options menu, the Windows Styles submenu, you can access lots of styles for Net Viewer’s interface.\n\nFrom a functionality point of view, you can expect to get the following from Net Viewer: save website addresses (bookmarks); organize saved addresses in groups; manage bookmarks from Net Viewer’s user friendly interface; separate location for websites with passwords; manage lists; save and manage email addresses; import favorites from your web browser; save webpages for offline viewing; and more.\n\nAs mentioned above, Net Viewer is free to use for a trial period of 30 days.\n\nPlease note that alongside Net Viewer there’s a free Net Viewer Lite version.\n\nSave web addresses (bookmarks), save email addresses, and then conveniently manage them from Net Viewer’s styles-rich interface."
