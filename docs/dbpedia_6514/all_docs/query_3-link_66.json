        "meta_description": "The goal of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department is to make Charlotte one of the safest large cities in America. To do that, we continually advance strategies that prevent crime. We find ways to engage the community in taking steps that help minimize opportunities for victimization. We explore appropriate policy direction with the Mayor and City Council. We seek solutions to the complex community problems that contribute to crime and disorder. And we enforce the laws and arrest the people who break them. The officers, staff and volunteers with the CMPD take very seriously their duty to provide citizens with professional, innovative and effective service. Community safety is a shared responsibility and we are committed to working in partnership with neighborhood residents and business owners as well as other local, state and federal agencies to reduce crime and increase safety.​",
