Netviewer Customer Success Story: Cipio Partners June 2006 Cipio Partners __________________________________________________________ From offices in Munich, London and San Jose, private equity firm Cipio Partners manages a global investment portfolio of more than 50 companies.

Netviewer Customer Success Story: Cipio Partners June 2006 ::: The solution Cipio carried out an extensive market analysis of available web collaboration applications to find the so- lution that would best meet the firm’s requirements.
