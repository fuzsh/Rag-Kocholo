Find out about our mission statement and philosophy and get the answers to some frequently asked questions. Bet you don't know how many agencies we serve! We'd like you to know all there is about how to report a fire and what different questions you may be asked if you were to report a medical emergency or report a crime.\n\nWe have an extensive community education program that teachers, seniors and neighbors will be interested in and we'd like you to know that we serve populations with special needs and comply with ADA requirements.\n\nWe are a CALEA Accredited Public Safety Communications Center, initially accredited on March 23, 2002 and re-accredited every 3 years. We are currently in the process of being re-certified for the eight time in 2023.\n\nWe encourage you to contact us with your comments, and hope you check our links to other 9-1-1 Centers, government sites and interesting Public Safety pages.\n\nIf you would like to compliment a 911 center employee please use the \"Compliments\" link on the left side of this page."
