        "text": "As the daughter of one of Hollywood’s richest citizens, Peggy Lloyd could have had an “easy living” kind of a life. Yet, she stubbornly chose to become her own, independent woman, and fought tooth and nail to make a decent living in Hollywood for herself and her children.\n\nEARLY LIFE:\n\nGloria Gabrielle Freeman was born on April 15, 1925, in Los Angeles, Califronia, to single mother Gloria Freeman. Her father (whatever his name was) was allegedly from Nebraska and her mother from Pennsylvania. Miss Freeman gave up Gloria for adoption soon after birth. She was put in a Pasadena orphanage.\n\nPeggy was adopted at the age of 5 by Harold and Mildred Lloyd. Harold Lloyd was a famous comedian, and the richest man in Hollywood – he was a shrewd investor and canny businessman. They already had two children, a son, Harold Lloyd Jr. and a daughter, Mildred Gloria, whose companion Gloria was destined to become.\n\nThey renamed her Marjorie Elisabeth, she was nicknames Peggy almost from day one.\n\nPeggy lived the high life as Lloyd’s daughter – she was chauffeured to school in a limo, and the family lived in the fabulous Lloyd estate (Green Acres, one of the first mansions in Beverly Hills) that had it’s own nine hole golf course and an Olympic sized pool. In 1930, after the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby, Lloyd became paranoid about the safety of his own children. As Gloria Lloyd later said to a journalist:\n\n“That was a scary time because we were old enough to know what was going on. We had two guards outside of our room with guns in holsters. Nice guys – they made fun for us children. But they used to go with us wherever we went, even to the tennis court. One taught me how to rollerskate. We weren’t allowed to go many places. So it was a very sheltered childhood.”\n\nBy all accounts, Harold and Mildred, as parents, were generous to the point of overindulgence. I quote Gloria’s independent obituar:\n\n“The children even had a private zoo. But Harold insisted they learn the value of money. At 13, Gloria and her friends had a lemonade stand on Benedict Canyon Drive. They charged a dime a glass, but Mildred made sure they gave the profits to the church.When Gloria and Peggy were students at UCLA. Lloyd ran the family on strict Victorian lines. Drinking was forbidden. Pocket money was limited to $30 a month while the girls were at college, and they were expected to travel there by bicycle.\n\n“As we grew up we had to be heavily chaperoned. It seems a little strange now, but we went out on dates with the chauffeur and the governess. Boyfriends came to the estate and were screened by Clementine, our housekeeper for 45 years. We felt like a Hollywood royal family.”\n\nPeggy attended Westlake School for Girl and, as mentioned in the quote, enrolled into UCLA and USC, majoring in art.\n\nDespite the family’s wealth, Peggy wanted to work and carve her own mark on the world. Being a very beautiful woman, it was only natural that she try her hand in modeling. Soon, Peggy was all over the papers, modeling clothes and advertising for this and that. In 1943, she landed a role in Cover girl, and started her career in Hollywood, the town where she was practically royalty.\n\nCAREER:\n\nAgain, I quote some of the previous posts about her movie career:\n\nHer first credit is Cover Girl, a now classic Rita Hayworth/Gene Kelly Technicolor musical. While today remembered primarily a springboard for the two stars (Gene Kelly, loaned out from MGM; finally got the treatment he deserved at his home studio after this movie, and Rita crawled out of the B movies and supporting role sin A movies and got her due with Gilda and other great movies), it’s a fun, sweet movie nonetheless. Rita is simply enchanting, and Gene, while his character is somewhat of a jerk, redeems himself with his superb, athletic dancing. A great and breezy way to pass an hour and a half!\n\nPeggy was one of 14 cover girls who appeared in it. The others were Betty Jane Hess, Eileen McClory, Dusty Anderson, Jinx Falkenburg, Cecilia Meagher, Anita Colby, Francine Counihan and so on.\n\nAfter her death, Peggy was featured in an American Masters episode about her father, where she talked about their relationship and how was it to growing up in such an environment.\n\nPRIVATE LIFE:\n\nIn 1946, Peggy made it in the California debutante book, along with her sister, Gloria, and Shirley Temple.\n\nPeggy married movie producer Almon Bartlett “Bart” Ross on April 17, 1948. Ross was born on July 5, 1923, making him just two years older than Peggy. His father was a well known doctor in Beverly Hills. Their son David Lloyd Ross was born on May 26, 1950. They separated and divorced in 1953. In 1954, Bart married Erin Considine, another daughter of well heeled showbiz parents (her mother was Carmen Pantages, of the Pantages dynasty, and her dad director John Considine Jr.). That marriage did not last either, and he married lastly to Mary Carmenla Clark in 1961. He died in 1970.\n\nAfter her divorce, Peggy refused to return to the Lloyd’s house, and instead took an apartment with a friend and started a career as a Hollywood gossip columnist. She had to learn everything from a scratch, but Peggy was a smart, sharp woman and quickly paved her own way. She was proud to be able to support her son all on her own.\n\nPeggy had a one sided crush on society columnist Jim Copp. One of her first dates after her divorce were Don Taylor (then freshly divorced from Phyllis Avery) and Bob Fullerton. She let her hair down, driving in a fiee truck around town with her friend Ginny Simms. In late 1953 and early 1954, she had a serious romance with Dick Ogden, but he left her and she carried a torch for several months afterwards. Peggy dated first Harry Crocker and then Herbert Hirschmoeller for a brief time in the 1955, and then met her next husband, a young actor Robert, “Bob” Patten.\n\nThey married on March 3, 1956, in Las Vegas. Patten was born on October 11, 1925 in Tacoma, Washington. He came to Hollywood in 1925 and was to become a major character actor in showbiz. The real marriage lasted only 8 months, and her friend Betty Plant even testified that Patten told her he could not stand Peggy any more, since he disliked “good wives”. They won a divorce in December 1956, and afterwards Peggy found out she was pregnant. This did not change her decision about her marital state – they did not remarry. Their son Robert Patten Jr. was born on August 3, 1957 in Los Angeles.\n\nAs Harold Lloyd’s daughter, Peggy was very active socially. She knew everybody who was somebody from the movie colony, and was a good friend with Charlie and Oona Chaplin, giving many interview about the couple. Peggy also gave many soirees at her home in San Fernando Valley, hosting many a famous people. She was on good terms with her sister and brother, and the only child who remained in normal contact with the elder Lloyd and Mildred.\n\nI was very impressed by Peggy, as she became a publicist and refused all help from Harold for financial support. She candidly told a reported that “I am over 21 and mom and dad are not responsible for my mistakes.” Bravo for Peggy! A very down to earth, normal millionaire’s daughter! Peggy later worked in a variety of other jobs: as a talent scout for a radio DJ, restaurant hostess, bookkeeper for an advertising agency and saleswoman.\n\nPeggy tried to find her birth mother in about 1972, as reported by the Los Angeles Times. This started a trend in the papers, where adopted children seeker the truth about their birth parents. I don’t know how exactly it transpired, but Peggy met with her birth mother, then known as Dorothy Callison.\n\nPeggy did not remarry and lived the rest of her days in California.\n\nMarjorie Elisabeth Lloyd died on November 18, 1986, from lung cancer in Newport, Orange County, California.\n\nHer former husband Bob Patten died in 2001. The last surviving Lloyd sibling, Gloria, died in 2012.\n\nMost female models in the 1940s and 1950s served their due for a few years and happily gave up their jobs for marriage and family. Jean Colleran was one of the few models that lasted more than a decade and became a powerhouse in the industry.\n\nEARLY LIFE:\n\nJean Pershing Colleran was born on September 7, 1918 to Michael Colleran and his wife, Jeannette Hemmings, in Manhattan, New York City, New York. She was one of four children – her older siblings were Walter M. and Blanche M., her younger sibling was John R.\n\nJean’s mother was an England native who immigrated to the US and married Michael in the early 1910s.\n\nJeannette stayed connected to her family in England, and the children went overseas at least twice to visit their grandparents and other relatives. Jeannette’s sister, Maizie, also came to New York at some point, and was living with the family in 1940, along with her son Michael Eby (named after Jeannette’s husband).\n\nJean attended George Washington high school in her birth city, and later became a talented artist and sculptor studying at the Art Students League in Manhattan. She started modeling while still a schoolgirl, in 1936. Due to her exquisite face, she was quick to become a leading model by the time she was 20 years old. She even purchased her own home and lived in Riverdale, New York, for a time, while her parents lived in Kew Garden Hills, Long Island.\n\nCAREER:\n\n{Since their career were more or less the same, I am repeating this from the post about Betty Jane Hess.}\n\nHer one and only credit is Cover Girl, a now classic Rita Hayworth/Gene Kelly Technicolor musical. While today remembered primarily a springboard for the two stars (Gene Kelly, loaned out from MGM; finally got the treatment he deserved at his home studio after this movie, and Rita crawled out of the B movies and supporting role sin A movies and got her due with Gilda and other great movies), it’s a fun, sweet movie nonetheless. Rita is simply enchanting, and Gene, while his character is somewhat of a jerk, redeems himself with his superb, athletic dancing. A great and breezy way to pass an hour and a half!\n\nJean was one of 14 cover girls who appeared in it. The others were Betty Jane Hess, Ceceilia Meagher, Dusty Anderson, Jinx Falkenburg, Helen Mueller, Anita Colby, Francine Counihan and so on.\n\nPRIVATE LIFE:\n\nMany of the high fashion models of that time married very well. In fact, I’m sure that more models married millionaires than chorus girls and Hollywood actresses! From the 14 Cover girls, several of them married upwards.\n\nJean was a refreshing change from his rule. While the other capitalized on their faces and bodies, Jean remained devoted to her high school sweetheart, Robert Foster Fuchs. Foster was born to Herman and Josephine Fuchs in 1916 in New York (I guess he changed his surname to Foster at some point).\n\nTheir wedding, held on August 1943 in Beverly Hills, turned into a media extravaganza since all of the 14 cover girls attended it. And they all kissed the groom! On a funny note, of all the eligible bachelorette girls, the 5 year old model, Cheryl Archer, caught the bouquet! The couple honeymooned in Florida before Robert was off to Europe to fight in WW2.\n\nFoster got his moment of fame, being married to one of the foremost models in the country. A touching story about Foster was featured in the papers in November 1944 – after not seeing his wife for more than a year, he dozen off during a movie screening on the French-German battle line. When he was awoken by the whistle of a GI, the first thing he was was Jean’s face, looking down at him (they were watching Cover Girl), and he was sure he was still dreaming! Very sweet!\n\nI have no information about what happened to Foster, but I assume he returned from the war and the couple resumed their apple pie marriage. Jean’s Hollywood career never going off the ground, and she worked in New York from then on.\n\nShe was still an active model in 1953, by the time most of her peers were already married and retired from modeling. She was even featured in a newspaper article in 1950 where she reminisced about the old days, saying how everything was much cheaper in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Jean was a very savvy woman, saving money by making her own facials, buying nylon hair extensions (as opposed to those made out of real hair which are much more expensive), and made her own false eye lashes! To quote Jean on how to make them:\n\n“Just knot short pieces of your own hair on one longer strand, trim them, and curl out and mascara the hairs. Then glue them on the lashed just like any other false eyelashes.”\n\nIn 1958, Jean decided to take matters into her own hands:\n\nBabs Ferguson, formerly with Hartford Agency, and Jean Colleran Foster, former model, have formed a new firm, Foster-Ferguson Agency, to provide advertising agencies and film firms with models for commercials. The new firm is at 141 East 44th St., New York. The agency will provide both male and female models, providing screening service before sending models to casting directors.\n\nSo, Jean ended up being a successful businessman too! What a lady! One of her most famous protegees was Martha Stewart, who modeled when she was just barely out of her teens); Virginia Booker, Frances Huff (who was romanced by the Maharaja of Baroda), and the list goes on. The agency was still working in the 1960s.\n\nJean married her second husband, Daniel Lynch, sometime in in the 1960s. The marriage was terminated, either by his death or divorce, in cca early 1970s.\n\nJan married her third husband, Francis Cruthers, in the late 1970s. Crithers was an interesting man, as his obituary notes:\n\nHero firefighter Francis Cruthers, who rose through the ranks to become chief of the Fire Department of New York, and later saw his son reach the same position, died yesterday at 73 following a long illness.\n\nCruthers became chief of department, the highest-ranking uniformed position, in 1978 and remained in that post until his retirement in 1981. His son Frank served as chief in 1996 and 1997 and is now an assistant chief with the department.\n\nThe two are the only father and son to serve as chiefs, a department spokesman said.\n\nFollowing a stint in the army, where he parachuted into Normandy on D-Day, Cruthers joined the department in 1949.\n\nHe served in all five boroughs and was cited twice for heroism.\n\nCruthers was named Bronx borough commander in 1973 and was promoted to head of the Bureau of Fires in 1976. He held that position, now called head of Bureau Operations, until his appointment as chief.\n\nCruthers is survived by his wife, Jean, four children and 10 grandchildren.\n\nFrom this link\n\nJean did not remarry after Cruthers’ death, and lived for a long time in Southampton, New York. Later, she went on to live with her nephew and niece Joe and Leeanne Healey in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.\n\nJean Cruthers died on April 14, 2011 in Florida.\n\nTop New York models/cover girls in the 1940s. They were stunningly beautiful and each had her own unique brand of charm. Yet, just the same, Betty Jane Hess was just one of the many cover girls that tried Hollywood but failed to make grades as actresses.\n\nEARLY LIFE:\n\nBetty Jane Hess was born on February 3, 1921 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to John N. Hess and Jessie W. Stroup. She was the youngest of three children – her older brother was John R. Hess, and her older sister was Mary Louise Hess. Her father worked as a demonstrator and her mother was a housewife. They married just before 1910.\n\nShe grew up in Pittsburgh, and attended high school there. She entered modeling quite young, in 1938, when she was barely 17 years old. As most beginners in the field, she competed in many pageants and slowly worked her way from Pittsburgh to New York.\n\nPretty soon, Betty was one of the highest paid Harry Conover models. She modeled for Chesterfield cigarettes and frequently worked with illustrator. She even scored a Life magazine cover.\n\nBetty hit Broadway and appeared in “Hold on to your hats“, a revue with Al Jolson in the lead. As one of the “ladettes”, she was noticed by a unnamed Hollywood scout and scurried to the West coast to try a career in movies.\n\nCAREER:\n\nBetty’s Hollywood career came out as a very thin one, but hey, at least she has one credit!\n\nHer one and only credit is Cover Girl, a now classic Rita Hayworth/Gene Kelly Technicolor musical. While today remembered primarily a springboard for the two stars (Gene Kelly, loaned out from MGM; finally got the treatment he deserved at his home studio after this movie, and Rita crawled out of the B movies and supporting role sin A movies and got her due with Gilda and other great movies), it’s a fun, sweet movie nonetheless. Rita is simply enchanting, and Gene, while his character is somewhat of a jerk, redeems himself with his superb, athletic dancing. A great and breezy way to pass an hour and a half!\n\nBetty Jane was one of 14 cover girls who appeared in it. The others were Jean Colleran, Ceceilia Meagher (both whom of I hope to profile in this blog), Dusty Anderson, Jinx Falkenburg, Helen Mueller, Anita Colby, Francine Counihan and so on.\n\nBetty Jane toured extensively with Cover Girl, passing over many a city. It was noted that she refuses the swanky hotel accommodation when they passed Pittsburgh so she could stay with her family (her parents, brother and sister all lived together in 1940).\n\nYet, Betty chose family over career and gave up movies for good afterwards.\n\nPRIVATE LIFE:\n\nBetty was often seen in the newspapers due to her active social life and stormy love life. On a interesting note, Betty Jane was a passionate lover of ice cream but absolutely hated sea food 😦\n\nBetty entered the media worlds in the late 1930s, as a young model in New York. Her first beau was Giuseppe Vittelli, a young Italian actor, who just joined a stage show in September 1940 when they started dating.\n\nBy 1941, Betty had moved on to greater plains, and dated Alexis Thompson, a wealthy sportsman famous as a old school, elegeant playboy. It was a very tumultuous relationship that lasted for several months, with lots of ups and downs. They broke up, got gether again, broke up again and so on goes the circle. They broke up for good in August 1941 after several months of pushing if forwards/backwards. She was also seen with Tom Cassara, who was known around town for dating showgirls. In September she was allegedly seen with George Hale, the famous showman.\n\nBetty wasted no time in moving on and married Harry Bleich, a Wall Street sugarbroker, at the Little church Around the Corner in October 1941. Harry was a member of the affluent Illinois Bleich family (his cousin was actress Mary Bovard, profiled on this blog in 2013). Harry was drafted into the Navy in 1942. Betty got massive publicity when she went on to appear in Cover Girl, and was in the papers almost monthly in 1942 and 1943.\n\nBetty gave birth to a son, John North Bleich, on May 22, 1945. Her second child, daughter Susan Bleich, was born in August 1946.\n\nSadly, that marriage hit a rough patch and they were separated by the end of the decade. Quite probably this was one of many “wartime marriages” when women married servicemen they would never have married in a normal circumstances. Most of these marriages failed without a hitch after the end of the war, but this one was not over… yet.\n\nDuring her separation from Bleich, Betty Jane dated Sy Devore, the Tailor to the stars, in 1956. In 1959, she was the best gal of Hollywood producer Dick Krakauer.\n\nBy early 1960s, the Bleichs were reconciled and lived together until Harry’s death in 1972. In 1974, Betty remarried to Marshall Duffield. Marshall was an very interesting man, today primarily known as a USC all american quarterback. He was born in Salt Lake City in 1911 and moved to Santa Monica with his family in 1914. He graduated with honors from USC and was nominated for a Rhodes scholarship, but, in his own words:\n\n“The Rhodes examination was scheduled for the same day as the final game of our 1930 season and I couldn’t have deserted the team, even if I’d wanted to,” he said years later of abandoning his plum academic chance to study at Oxford University.\n\n“Maybe it would have been better if I had,” he added candidly. “We got beaten 27-0.”\n\nAfter USC, Duffield dabbled briefly in politics, announcing his candidacy for Santa Monica mayor and Los Angeles Board of Education, and briefly attended law school. He worked as an assistant movie director and in 1933 married a starlet, Dorothy Lee. They divorced two years later.\n\nDuffield next worked for an import-export business and just before World War II founded his Duffield Distributing Co. of Culver City, which handled beverages.\n\nDuring World War II, Duffield served as commander of the Navy minesweeper Starling, shipping out four weeks after his marriage to Donna Maguire of Los Angeles.\n\nReturning to his business after the war, he expanded from five employees in 1946 to 150 with a sales volume of $10 million in 1957 when he sold the company.\n\nDuffield then moved to Orange County and became president of the Newport Shoreside Co. boating concern, vice president of the Bayside Village trailer park and owner and general manager of the Duffield Lincoln-Mercury dealership in Long Beach.\n\nBetty and Marshall lived peacefully and happily in Orange County until his death in 1990 at the age of 79. Betty never remarried. In her later years shared fun times and travel with Howard Marvin. She generally lived a glamorous life and was well liked by her friends.\n\nBetty’s older son John North Bleich died on January 18, 2001, aged only 56. Sadly, her parents, brother, sister and nephew all preceeded her in death.\n\nBetty Jane Duffield died on March 14, 2008, in California.\n\nBeautiful Virginia played the anti-femme fatale, or the good girl, in several top film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s, and achieved a level of recognition that was not too shabby. Sadly, she left movies to become a housewife in the early 1950s.\n\nEARLY LIFE:\n\nVirginia Ellen Houston was born on April 24, 1925 in Wisner, Nebraska, to Marcus M. Huston and Agnes Kane. Her father was born in 1897 and married her mother sometime in the late 1910s. In 1920, they were living in Illinois, but moved to Agnes’ native Nebraska in the early 1920s.\n\nThe family moved to Omaha, Nebraska not long after her birth. She made her stage debut at the age of 5 in a production of Helen of Troy. Virginia attended a catholic all girls, Duchesne school, and was acting in the drama department. She was just 12 years old when she decided to become an actress (after visiting Los Angeles).\n\nHer mother was a typical stage mother, and pushed Virginia into trying to become a star and developed a master plan for her success. Virginia stuck to the master plan and became a fixture in the Omaha public life. Except appearing in school plays, she was active in the local radio station and even acted in the prestigious Omaha Community playhouse (where Dorothy McGuire and Henry Fonda acted early in their careers).\n\nHer younger brother Randy was born in 1942. In 1945, she decided to go acting full time. She could not decide between going to New York to act on Broadway or to go to Hollywood. In the end, Hollywood and the stories of making a quick buck won out. So, Virginia, her mother and brother were off to California.\n\nThey roomed in a small hotel room in Beverly Hills while Virginia made the rounds of movie studios. Due to her resemblance to Joan Fontaine, she was rejected by Darryl Zanuck and almost gave up. Luckily, Charles Feldman, a successful agent, saw her in the Romanoff nightclub, like what he saw, signed her, and finally nabbed her a contract with RKO studios due to her melodic voice.\n\nCAREER:\n\nVirginia set the prototype of most of her future roles in Nocturne, a decent film noir with George Raft. Lynn Bari was the dark and dangerous femme fatale and Virginia was the blonde good girl. While it’s pretty standard to say Raft was not a great actor, his charm and charisma make him an adequate film noir hero. Virginia’s soft spoken manner was perfectly in tune with the role, and she is one of the better things to remember from the film.\n\nOut of the Past remains Virginia most durable role and her best known movie. An all around superb film, with Robert Mitchum in the lead, directed masterfully by Jacques Tournouer, it remains one of the staples of the noir genre. While Virginia was overshadowed by Jane Greer, who was absolutely first class as the femme fatale Kathie Moffat, her career would have been much poorer were it not for this role.\n\nFlamingo Road is one of the so called carnival movies, with a past-40 Joan Crawford trying to act like she’s a fresh faced, naive dancer. While Crawford’s age does ruin the feeling of the movie a bit, generally it’s a well acted, well made film dealing with some topics highly actual even today.\n\nIn a sea of B westerns, The Doolins of Oklahoma stands out as a above notch piece of work. Not only is the cast a very good one, but Zachary Scott as the main character is a study in grey morality – a bank robber who can show kindness and compassion to others.Virginia is the typical decorative good girl.\n\nWomen from Headquarters is a woman empowerment movie about female police officers. Like many movies of the genre, it’s no master piece, but solely the theme makes it an interesting watching experience. Virginia, Barbara Fuller and Frances Charles make quite a trio!\n\nWhile it did not endear her to the large masses like a true hit film, Virginia still struck career gold by playing Jane in one of Lex Barker’s Tarzan movies, namely Tarzan’s Peril . Let’s be realistic, it’s just another entry into the Tarzan series, and thus nothing to call a great film, but it is not a disgrace in her filmography. It’s certainly well made and decently acted, but that is about it. As a plus, actresses who played Jane are something akin to Jame Bond actresses, no matter what they did for the rest of their career, at least they will be featured on every “Actresses who acted in Tarzan movies” list, and, to some degree, remembered.\n\nVirginia marched on. The Highwayman, a moody, dark retelling of the famous Alfred Noyes poem, is a movie that many who saw it as children will never forget. It’s got everything a movie needs: a touching, tragic story, decent actors (I am a sucker for Wanda Henrdix, who plays the female lead!) and a great cinematographer. Flight to Mars is a typical low budget 1950s SF movie. Predictable, with no big names and barely-there script, recommended only for the hard core fans of the genre.\n\nSudden Fear is Virginia second best movie, right after Out of the past. A unusual but very good film noir, it’s one of the few noirs that gives precedent to an older woman – Joan Crawford was nearing 50 when she played the role with special gusto (we need more movies like this, with more roles for women past 40 – just when they become great actresses, the roles dry up! Another great movie with a great role for an older woman is White Heat, with Margaret Wycherly whipping up everybody else in the cast!).Virginia, as usual, plays the good girl, and the bad girl is played by Gloria Grahame (who excelled in these types of roles!).\n\nKnock on Wood, a decent Danny Kaye movie, proved to be Virginia’s last hurrah. Too bad. She only made one more appearance on the The Ford Television Theatre TV series, and then settled into comfortable retirement as the wife of a wealthy real estate broker.\n\nPRIVATE LIFE:\n\nVirginia was no means a typical starlet. Not only more delicate looking and regal than the typical starlet, she was never in the papers for reasons of private life and so on. When somebody wrote about her, it was because of her career. It was also often noted that her mother and baby brother, Randy, lived with her.\n\nVirginia developed a crush on the star of Out of the past, the jaded, cynical Robert Mitchum. As anyone who saw Mitchum in movies can attest, while not handsome, he had a gritty, powerful charm that was very alluring to women. He was a married man with three children, but that did not stop him from having a devil-may-care lifestyle, drinking, doing drugs (mostly marijuana) and womanizing. Yet, he swiftly brushed Virginia aside as she was too small a fish to end up on his repertoire, and he was hunting for bigger fish to fry (yep, the man dated some pretty impressive actresses, like Ava Gardner, Jean Simmons and Joan Crawford, all of them more famous than Virginia). Despite this, Virginia was enthralled with Bob until the filming ended, and even some time afterwards.\n\nFor a brief time in mid 1946, Hollywood was sure that Virginia would marry Frank Latimore, young 20th Century-Fox actor, but the broke up before the year was out.\n\nLittle else was written about Virginia’s love life in the papers. What we do know is that, on August 12, 1952, Virginia married wealthy real estate agent, Manus Paul Clinton. Clinton was born on June 17, 1923. Their daughter, Pamela Ann, was born on September 3, 1954. Virginia retired from movies and the couple lived in Beverly Hills.\n\nIn 1953, Virginia gave an interview to Lydia Lane, the famous beauty columnist, where she made it pretty clear how ill suited she was for the highly hectic Hollywood life. She said how her stomach was often in knots during filming, and she could not eat properly as a result. In order to maintain her strength, she drank a strong beef concentrate with an egg thrown in it. Sometimes, her anxiety would get so intense she would feel she was about to faint. She could reverse the process and not faint by doing a form of self hypnosis, where she would imagine nice things and tell herself calming words. After reading this, I was glad that she gave up movies for marriage. She did not seem the type to take the extra wattage needed to become a hard core actress (imagine Bette Davis doing this!). Similarly “weak willed” actresses, many of them quite talented, often ended up in the gutter (Frances Farmer, Gail Russell), so Virginia’s story was not that a bad at all.\n\nVirginia and Manus divorced sometime in the early 1960s.\n\n1966 was a very tough year for Virginia. Her former husband married his second wife, and she gave birth to a long awaited son who bore his father’s name. Her own father died in September of that year at the age of 69.\n\nVirginia never remarried, and lived the rest of her days in Beverly Hills.\n\nVirginia Clinton died on February 28, 1981, in Santa Monica, California. Her former husband died in 1989.\n\nVirginia Hewitt was an incredibly beautiful model who never made it in Hollywood. Same old same old? Yes, but she was one of the few lucky ones who got their big break on TV, landing a role in a highly popular series of the 1950s, and later branched into other venues.\n\nEARLY LIFE:\n\nVirginia Hewitt was born on November 28, 1925, in Shreveport, Louisiana to Leland James Hewitt and Ethel Roloson. She was the youngest of three children: her older sister Etheda was born in 1920, her older brother, James, in 1923.\n\nThe family moved quite a bit during her childhood, and were living in Ada, Pontotoc, Oklahoma in 1930. They moved to rural Missouri in the mid 1930s, and by 1940, they were living in Louisiana, Pike, Missouri, where Virginia attended high school.\n\nA stunningly beautiful girl with a perfectly sculpted face and an elegant bearing, it was no surprise that she chose to become a model. She started modeling upon graduation, and moved to Kansas City, Missouri. She dabbled as an actress in small theatrical production on the side. It was during ashow that a talent scout approached Virginia and asked her to try her hand in Tinsel Town. In 1947, she and her sister left for Hollywood.\n\nCAREER:\n\nAlthough she was uncredited in My Dear Secretary, Virginia actually had a decent role in it, appearing in about three scenes and her character actually had at least a marginal importance in the film. Virginia was so beautiful that my breath stopped when the camera followed the contours her face – so perfectly sculpted, like a Venus statue!\n\nAnyway, My Dear secretary is a nicely done, funny battle of the sexes comedy with some great acting bits. The star of the movie are not the leads (although they are “very much” charming), but Keenan Wynn, who has all the best one liners and delivers them with a impeccable comic timing. The man is a genius, to put in succinctly.\n\nIt was that role that brought her to the attention of producer Mike Moser, who was about to bring a space adventure to the small screen. Soon, she was signed to appear on Space Patrol, her claim to fame. Virginia played Carol Karlyle, daughter of the Secretary General of the United Planets who, when she wasn’t helping Corey (portrayed by World War II flier Ed Kemmer) battle an assortment of evil-doers in the 30th Century, was trying to lure him into matrimony. It remains by far her most popular role.\n\nThe series opened a few new doors for her, both in movies and TV. She appeared in The Flying Saucer, a low budget, very trashy B class 1950s SF about flying saucers in Alaska. Need I say more? This movie was not meant to be a good one, and of course it’s not even close to being one. This mind numbing feast is not for those who want some quality entertainment. Virginia has a small role at that, so it’s not even worth watching to see her pretty face.\n\nBowery Battalion, featuring the Bowery brothers, is a much better fare, and a real example of how low budget movies can actually turn good despite the lack of funding. The People Against O’Hara, a solid Spencer Tracy movie, was her last foray into Hollywood.\n\nVirginia got married and quit acting for the time being. She only had a brief foray into episodic roles in the UK in the early 1970s – The Guardians, Thirty-Minute Theatre and Adam Smith are mostly forgotten series today. Virginia never acted after that.\n\nPRIVATE LIFE:\n\nUnlike many starlets, Virginia was not a newspaper staple in the late 1940s when she crashed Hollywood, and got no media recognition whatsoever until her Space Patrol days. There is little information about her in the papers and just a few photos.\n\nAs far as her talents go, Virginia was an amateur writer who wrote articles and even got published several times in some papers and magazines. Her true dream when she came to the West coast was to become an writer first and actress second.\n\nVirginia was described several times by her co stars as a ladylike, elegant woman who was nice to everybody, but always at a distance, not too friendly, with a touch of an ice queen about her. Her cool blonde looks complimented that image well.\n\nVirginia started dating her Space Patrol co star, Lyn Osborne, in early 1952. Osborne was often connected to other actresses in the media (he dated Piper Laurie, Rita Moreno, Barbara Withing, model Christine Marlowe and the list goes on) but Virginia was his one true lady love. He fell like a ton of bricks for her.\n\nYet, the story did not continue the as one would expect. Instead of getting married to Lyn, Virginia met and was swept of her feet by Ernest Meer, a Viennese born architect working as interior designer for the rich and famous Californians. Virginia soon left Lyn to be with Ernst – Lyn took the blow extra hard. There was some tension on the set due to this – Lyn verbally lashing out on her and Virginia hiding behind her cool exterior to hide the distress. Luckily, they managed a more or less a professional front and the filming continued without a hitch after the first few tiffs.\n\nDespite the bitter sweet ending of their relationship, Virginia cared deeply for Lyn for the rest of her days, saving all of his love letters, notes and photos of them together in a special memory box. Eventually they resumed their friendship, and she was devastated upon his early death in 1958 (after an unsu ccessful operation).\n\nShe and Meer married on December 31, 1953, and she used the artistic talent to help him in business. The two then began to design some of the better-known chandeliers around Los Angeles, including the spectacular one in the Cecil B. DeMille Room at the old Hollywood Brown Derby. They owned the world famous Courant showroom.\n\nVirginia and Meer divorced in the 1970s. Virginia never married again, and lived for a brief time in the UK before returning to Los Angeles. Meer married Patricia V. Font in 1981, divorced her in 1985, and married Irina K Maleeva in 1985.\n\nVirginia Hewitt Meer died on July 21, 1986, in Los Angeles, California from cancer. Meer died in 1987.\n\nBarbara Barondess is one of those people whose life story can easily serve as a movie script. A versatile, vivacious woman who gave up movies for marriage – as most of the girls did – she nonetheless rose again as a prominent interior decorator and acting coach. Quite a feat for someone who was born in 1907!\n\nEARLY LIFE:\n\nBarbara Barondess was born on July 4, 1907, in New York City, to Benjamin Brandes and his wife, the former Stella Sirkis. She came from a wealthy Russian Jewish family which made it’s fortune in lumber trade. The family moved back to Russia after being persuaded by Barbara’s grandfather. They lived in Shitomir, Ukraine, where her younger sister, Rosalie , was born in 1911. Hard times befell on the family in 1914 when the Russian revolution stated – they were both Jews and capitalists. Her father was shot in the throat the same day Barbara was shot in the shoulder. He survived due to an emergency operation, but was unable to speak normally for the rest of his life.\n\nHer sister Lucienn was born on May 16, 1919. Afterwards, the family fled to Poland where Benjamin and Barbara were arrested and imprisoned. Barbara was eventually released and joined her mother and two sisters (who had crossed the border separately). Her father remained in custody for close to a year and a half while the family struggled to prove that Barbara was an American citizen. Her mother argued to authorities that at the time she and her husband were born, the Ukraine was part of Poland and therefore they were Polish citizens. Eventually, the family was allowed to leave for the United States.\n\nThey settled in New York where the girls attended school – Barbara went to Erasmus High School. She started working in a bank at the age of 16. While working by day, Barbara attended night classes at New York University. At the age of 19, she entered a beauty contest and won the title of “Miss Greater New York” which in turn led to a role in the stage play Gay Paree . Barondess went on to appear on Broadway in a handful of parts, including Crime (1927) and, most notably, the ingénue role in Topaze (1929), . The recognition she received from these plays landed her a chance to try her luck in Hollywood in the mid 1920s.\n\nCAREER:\n\nBarabra appeared in several silent movies, All Aboard, Summer Bachelors, The Sorrows of Satan. The Reckless Lady , A Kiss for Cinderella but made no splashes in the sea of Hollywood starlets, warranting her no fame nor fortune.\n\nHer career really started in 1932, when she made her sound movie debut in Rasputin and the Empress. Notable mostly for getting the colorful Barrymore family in one movie, it’s still a stodgy, over the top piece of work with a totally distorted history. Her second feature was Luxury Liner, an interesting if flawed account of a passengers aboard a (yep, you guessed it), a luxury liner!\n\nSadly Barbara’s next two features, Soldiers of the Storm and When Strangers Marry are very hard to get and moslty considered lost today, so we have no idea what kind of movies they are. Barbara had a credited role in Hold Your Man, a Clark Gable/Jean Harlow movie. This one is an unusual one – what starts as a typical rom com with Gable as a con man and Jean as a gun moll turns into a touching drama about life choices and change. Harlow is superb in the movie, as a woman who undergoes a major transformation, never an easy feast for any actor playing such roles. The Devil’s Mate, her next movie, is considered lost.\n\nQueen Christina is such a tour de force movie that it needs no introduction for anyone at least marginally interested in classic movies. Barbra continued appearing in credited roles, but small ones and in small movies. Eight Girls in a Boat, made just months before the code went into effect, dealt with teenage pregnancy and had a charming female lead in Dorothy Wilson, a WAMPAS Baby Star. Unknown Blonde is a movie about a con man who almost frames his own daughter (unknowingly, of course). The movie is worth watching if nothing than for Edward Arnold, a fine actor, in the lead role. Change of Heart was a level up for Barbara, as a gentle slice of life drama about young people starting their professional lives in New York. It’s interesting see and contrast it with the way New York functions today in movies and series. The movie also features the perennial movie couple, Janet Gaynor and Charles Farrell. Beggar’s Holiday is a lost movie about a woman falling in love with an embezzler.\n\nThe Fountain has an impressive cast (Brian Aherne, Paul Lukas, Ann Harding) but not much else going for it – as an adaptation of a stage piece, it’s stilted, formulaic and often too slow. A must for Ann Harding fans (I love the actress, she was such a kind but strong personality) but hardy recommended for anyone else. The Pursuit of Happiness is a happy-go-lucky, charming movie with Charles Lederer in the lead.\n\nBarbara downgraded to uncredited roles after that. The Merry Widow is a Lubitsch classic, but not worth a notch for her career. Life Begins at Forty is a mild movie, a perfect showcase for the comedic talents of Will Rogers. People Will Talk is another comedy, this time with Charles Ruggles/Mary Boland comedy duo, dealing with martial squabbles in a lighthearted way. Diamond Jim is a very good biographical film – no wonder, when you have Edward Arnold and Jean Arthur in the leads and Preston Sturges as the director! A Tale of Two Cities, from 1935, still remains the best adaptation of Dicken’s classic novel, in large part thanks to Ronald Colman impeccably playing the dual main roles.\n\nBarbara managed to revive her career enough to get credited roles again. Easy Money gave her a meaty roles of a bride trying to set her wayward husband straight. The film is is a crime movie with an unusually intricate plot dealing with insurance fraud, not something Hollywood covers every day. Sadly, it remains one of many well made but obscure movies from the 1930s. Lady Be Careful, her next feature, is another movie completely forgotten today. The Plot Thickens is a delightful detective movie with the Inspector Piper/Hildegarde Withers sleuthing team. James Gleason plays the Inspector, and is matched every step of the way by the indomitable Zasu Pitts playing Miss Withers. There is plenty of 1930s dry humor and wit in this one!\n\nMake a Wish is a type of a movie Deanna Durbin excelled in – with a juvenile lead whose mischievous nature pushed him/her into various adventures and misadventures, mostly concerning their matchmaking skills. Instead of Deanna we have child star Bobby Breen, and the objects of his matchmaking are his widowed mother, playing by soprano Marion Claire (her only film role) and Basil Rathbone (known today as the ultimate Sherlock Holmes). Fit for a King is a good enough comedy with Joe E. Brown and Paul Kelly as the funny guy/straight guy pair.\n\nBarbara left her pursuit of movie stardom afterwards, and made only one feature, Emergency Squad, a solid, fast paced action film from 1940. Barbara turned to other revues and managed quite a career outside the limelight.\n\nPRIVATE LIFE:\n\nBarbara was a society butterfly who mingled with the elite of both the East and the West coasts. She knew everybody in Hollywood in the 1920 and 1930s, and afterwards was a doyenne of New York society in the 1940s and 1950s. She later switched to Palm Beach, Florida, in the 1960s and 1970s. Any way you put it, her social life was HIGHLY impressive.\n\nBarbara was featured to some degree in the papers, but generally not to much. She gave a beauty hint in 1933:\n\nUpon finishing work I very carefully remove all screen make up with cold cream, soap and water. Afterwards I run in just a little cold cream because I like the highlights this gives to one’s face. I use only lipstick for street.\n\nUnlike many starry eyed girls who land in Hollywood and expect miracles to happen, Barbara was a hard bitten realist. Years after her experiences as a minor actress, she said:\n\n“In those golden years of Hollywood, women were treated like disposable Kleenex. My experience started at MGM in 1933. I made two dozen pictures in five years and my hair color changed in each one. We had nothing to say about our appearance. I had to lose weight, although I was a size 8. The strain of the working conditions was almost beyond endurance. I don’t know how we survived making Eight Girls in a Boat (1934) for Paramount. We had to jump into a cold lake 20 times for a take.”\n\nBarbara’s first husband was theatrical producer Irving Jacobs whom she wed in 1929 in New York while working as an model/Broadway actress. The marriage fell apart by the time she came to Hollywood in 1932.\n\nBarbara met Douglas MacLean shortly after she came to Hollywood. He was separated from his second wife, actress Lorraine Eddy. Before Eddy he was married to the east coast socialite Faith Cole. Soon they were a constant duet, and in February 1938 eloped to Tijuana, Mexico and got married. They lived in Beverly Hills, in a hotel. Barbara was a good friend of many famous actors, like Gary Cooper, Clark Gable and Douglas Montgomery.\n\nBarbara and Douglas wanted a baby badly, but at first she was unable to conceive, and when she did get pregnant in 1943, she suffered a miscarriage. Sadly, in the end, no children were born out of the marriage.\n\nBarbara enrolled at UCLA, studying art and design. By 1940 she started an secondary career as an interior decorator, designing homes for celebrities like Garbo, Norma Shearer, Gail Patrick, Errol Flynn, Gary Cooper, Jane Wyman and Ronald Reagan. She was so successful that she expanded her business to the East Coast, opening a branch in New York in the mid-40s. Barondess later branched out into fashion, designing and manufacturing clothing, and even added cosmetics manufacturing to her growing empire.\n\nBarbara’s soaring career as a n interior decorator and fashion designer ruined her marriage to MacLean in cca 1947. They divorced in 1948, after ten years of marriage. Her next beau was Roger Dann, a French singer. He gave her a diamond ring, but it did not last long.\n\nBarbara re-meet Phillip Reed, whim whom she went to school on the East coast, and the two started dating in July 1948. They broke up in early 1949. That year she also dated a fabolously wealthy Spanish, Alfred De Vega.\n\nBarbara also dabbled in real estate. She was the owner the apartment where Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe spent some of the happiest days of their brief marriage.\n\nIn 1952, Barbara married Nathaniel Rouvell. The marriage made front page news and it was not surprising that their separation a few months later spread like forrest fire among the press. They divorced in 1953. At the divorce proceeding she claimed that Nathaniel criticized her constantly but never constructively and was always dissatisfied with everyhing she did.\n\nBarbara married her fourth husband, a wealthy Pal Beach man, ladies’ apparel executive Leonard Knaster, in 1955. He divorced his previous wife in 1952. They divided their time between Palm Beach and New York. As many wealthy dames, Barbara was looted from a chunky part of her jewelry collection in 1957. The marriage did not last – they divorced in 1974. Barbara never married again.\n\nIn 1984 she founded a non profit organization to help theatrical professionals move on in their chosen areas. She produced several off Broadways plays. Among the alumni of the school is the notable actor Morgan Freeman.\n\nBarbara Barondess died on May 31, 2000 in New York.\n\nEllen Hall, unlike most of the girls featured here, has her own Wikipedia site! This is highly indicative of the fact that she had some minor success in the film industry despite being completely obscure today.\n\nEARLY LIFE:\n\nEllen Jeane Johnson was born on April 18, 1923, in Los Angeles, California, to Ella Hall and Emory Johnson. Her older brother Richard was born on January 27, 1919. her younger sister, Diana Marie, was born in October 27, 1929.\n\nShe came from an acting family – both her parents and maternal grandmother, May Hall, were thespians. Yet, the only one who ever made true waves was her mother, Ella, a well known actress in the 1920s. Born in New York, she came to Hollywood in the early days of silent films. Her father was originally from San Francisco but left the city for Los Angeles pretty early, in 1913, to have his luck in the burgeoning film industry.\n\nHer mother retired from movies in 1933, and her parents divorced sometime in the 1930s. With her pedigree, it was not wonder that she started acting at a very tender age of seven. She made her movie debut in 1930, and started doing theater work very early, in about 1935. She migrated to New York in 1937 and had several theater roles on and off Broadway.\n\nIn 1940, Ellen was living with her mother, brother sister and grandmother in Los Angeles and attending high school. Ella worked as a saleswoman to support the family. Her film career started in full that year, and some success awaited her.\n\nCAREER:\n\nEllen made her debut in an absolute classic, All Quiet on the Western Front, when she was just a 7 year old child. This is nothing unusual for offspring of thespians families, but what is unusual is that her mother decided upon a path of education for her instead of a child actress career.\n\nEllen was already a seasoned theater player when she hit movies again, this time in 1941 at the age of 18. The movie was The Chocolate Soldier, a charming Nelson Eddy/Rise Stevens operetta.\n\nIn 1943 Ellen finally came into her own. She was never to become a star, not an A class actress, but worked steadily in B class movies for more than 6 years from than on and achieved enough success to play leads.\n\nHer first lead was in Outlaws of Stampede Pass, a more than decent Johnny Mack Brown western. She continued the trend by appearing in the very next Mack western. Both times the played the female lead and the romantic interest, but they were not the same characters. Seems like Mack Brown was a James Bond before the first Bond movie was even made!\n\nEllen made a foray into A class movies in Up in Arms, playing the Goldwyn girl, but it was back to B-s right after with Voodoo Man, a decent enough Monogram horror with a superb horror cast (Bela Lugosi, George Zucco, Lionel Barrymore). Ellen play the role of Lugosi’s wife, a woman dead for 22 years who he is trying to revive with the help of a voodoo priest. In a nutshell, she’s the reason everything happens in the movie, a pivotal point. Quite flattering, considering that other cuties like Louise Currie and Wanda McKay.\n\nIt was back to westerns after that. Lumberjack, Range Law Call of the Rockies and Brand of the Devil are the four movies that constitute the pinnacle of Ellen’s career. Always playing female leads in solid B class western series, and acting opposite some western heavyweights (Johnny Mack Brown again, William Boyd as Hopalong Cassidy, a character rarely surpassed in terms of popularity in the genre, and Smiley Burnette). While this was never the way to the A class, Ellen seemed content to being a working actress.\n\nAfter such a nice strike, Ellen was set aback to the uncredited tier in more prestigious movies, often a scanerio that happened to western heroines and B movie stars (kings in their tier, and paupers in the tier up). Here Come the Waves is a mediocre Bing Crosby/Betty Hutton musical. Definitely not a movie for those with any artistic or intellectual aspirations, it’s a piece of fluff that works due to the leads and their unique brand of charisma. Having Wonderful Crime, a Thin Man wannabe movie trying to mix sophisticated comedy with crime, falls short on several accounts, but is raised from total mediocrity by the ever charming Carole Landis.\n\nEllen’s last big movie was Wonder Man, with Danny Kaye, where she was one of the Goldwyn Girls. Cinderella Jones, a below average romantic comedy did nothing for nobody, including the leads, Joan Leslie and Robert Alda.\n\nIt was back to westerns and credited parts again. Thunder Town, one of the Bob Steele western movies, is unfortunately not among his best. While a very capable actor with an unique hard stare, Steele looks a bit worn out in the film and even the cameraman tried to “skip” any close ups. The next was Lawless Code, a western so deeply forgotten today it’s not even rated on IMDB, and the plot looks like one hot mess.\n\nEllen evaded westerns for a short time with Bowery Battalion, a Bowery boys movie, and one of their more valiant efforts. While the low budget constrains have to leave their mark, the gags are good enough to make it a enjoyable experience. Ellen then had a few appearances in the well kn own western series The Cisco Kid, with Duncan Renaldo and Leo Carrillo.\n\nHer very last movie effort came in 1952 with The Congregation, a completely lost movie.\n\nPRIVATE LIFE:\n\nEllen mostly made the paper due to her acting skill and not really any publicity stunts. Her large acting family was always mentioned whenever she made the news, her mother being the most prominent star of the yesteryear.\n\nEllen married Lee Langer on December 3, 1944, in Los Angeles, California, just as WW2 was ending (Lee attained the rank of captain). Langer was born on Ferbuary 3, 1919 in Illinois to Alex Langer and his wife, Sophia Rice.\n\nThe couple lived first in Los Angeles, and them moved to San Diego. As far as I can tell, they had no children and Ellen enjoyed a quiet retirement.\n\nLanger died on February 24, 1995. Ellen moved to Washington state after his death.\n\nEllen Jeane Langer died on March 24, 1999, in Bellevue, Washington.\n\nWith over 30 movies to her (un)credit, Diana Mumby, a pretty and talented chorus girl, worked regularly in Hollywood for almost 10 years, and had a much better track records than many of her contemporaries.\n\nEARLY LIFE:\n\nDiana Sootheran Mumby was born on July 1, 1922, in Detroit, Michigan, to Gerald Mumby and Gladys Wright. Her father was an English RAF officer, and her mother a born and bred New Yorker. Her parents divorced not long after her birth, and she was shuffled between her father who lived in England and her mother, who moved to Los Angeles.\n\nIn 1930, Diana and her mother (who attended college but did not graduate and worked as a nurse) lived in Los Angeles with a lodger. Gladys remarried to Mr. Johnson sometime in the 1930s,but they were living apart by 1939. Diana attended high school in Los Angeles and graduated in 1940, still living with her mother at the time.\n\nShe started her career as a chorus girl not long after graduation. She became an Earl Carroll girl and dancer for several years before getting into movies.\n\nCAREER:\n\nDiana spent most of her career in musicals, not surprising considering she was originally a dancer, and was never ever credited, despite being a Hollywood fixture for at least 8 years.\n\nSince she has a rather big filmography, consisting of 33 movies, and can be easily divided into three stages.\n\nDiana originally made her movie debut in a 1940 movie, A Night at Earl Carroll’s, where she played one of the chorines, but that did not warrant a movie career and after that she did not act for four years, working as a dancer in the interim.\n\nShe truly started to act in 1944, and until 1946 she appeared exclusively in musicals. We have Up in Arms (AGAIN!), where she was a Goldwyn girl, the slight but charming Two Girls and a Sailor, It’s a Pleasure a typical Sonja Henie movie (no brains, but skating), Earl Carroll Vanities, one of those musicals with a hugely implausible story that are just simply fun to watch, the exotic and breezy A Thousand and One Nights (that type of a movie was a huge hit with the audiences that did not have easy access to all the information and photos about the faraway lands that we have today), the foul mouthed George White’s Scandals, the so obscure we don’t know what to say about it An Angel Comes to Brooklyn, the silly and slightly amusing Cinderella Jones, a Danny Kaye classic The Kid from Brooklyn, a three-girls-seeking-husbands movie, Three Little Girls in Blue, and a witty and sharp but ultimately forgotten musical The Thrill of Brazil.\n\nWhat to say about this string of movies? While not bad at all, it is clear that she missed all the big, famous musical and settled somewhere in the musical mid tier, but at least she worked regularly and paid her bills.\n\nThus starts the second part of Diana’s career, where she got out of the musical cave and steered more towards straight drama and comedy movies. She kicked it high by appearing in The Razor’s Edge, one of Tyrone Power’s best movies, and generally one of the best movies of that year. More than a film about social problems, it’s a story of a man’s search for meaning, something much deeper than his social standing and his material wealth.\n\nOut California Way is a low budget western, one of many, many many such movies. Winter Wonderland is a forgotten Disney mumbo jumbo. A Song Is Born was a short veer back into the musical arena, but it was back to drama and crime movies in Alias Nick Beal, the Faust story with a modern twist and a superb cast with Ray Milland and Audrey Totter. Air Hostess was a typical light fare with three female leads trying to navigate their complicated professional/love lives. Beauty on Parade is an obscure drama about unfulfilled lives and wasted potentials serves as a good illustration of the husband/wife relationships back in the day.\n\nLet’s Dance is a Fred Astaire musical, and that fact alone elevates it to a very high level of movie making. Let’s be realistic, any movie with Fred in it is worth more than some better movies with lesser names today. The movie is far from a work of art, but fits the bill of an entertaining, fluffy film very well. Fred and Betty Hutton were a very interesting pair: he was technically flawless and very graceful, but she had the pizzazz and the magnetic pull that pried all eyes to her. Fred really has to work hard to keep the attention off of Betty, a refreshing change to his usual dominance on the dance floor.\n\nDiana continued the line with Bowery Battalion, the good enough entry of Bowery boys comedy series, The Lemon Drop Kid one of Bob Hope’s better 1950s comedies, and finally I Can Get It for You Wholesale, the prototype of the serious, theatrical, glossy 1950s dramas (featuring Susan Hayward, who next to Lana Turner was the queen of such roles).\n\nG.I. Jane was an unusual but highly diverting musical, just one of the many forgotten gems in the Hollywood low budget vaults. The Model and the Marriage Broker is an unjustly overlooked George Cukor movie. It has much to offer and an interesting choice of thespians – with Thelma Ritter being the absolute queen of the cast! The Las Vegas Story is a formulaic crime movie of the 1950s, using the ever lasting love triangle cliche to get together Jane Russell, Victor Mature and Vincent Price.\n\nA Fool and His Honey is a comedic short of no great merit, Something to Live For, a George Stevens drama, is a somber, dark movie showing complex people in complex relationships – but it’s very predictable and has too many holes in the plot. Up next: when you have a movie called Aaron Slick from Punkin Crick, I think everybody can guess what kind of a movie it is. While not the worst movie ever made, it’s still a muddling mess.\n\nSound Off is a pedestrian Mickey Rooney musical, and We’re Not Married! boasts such an impressive cast that even the mediocre quality of the movie can’t hamper it down. I mean, Ginger Rogers, Marilyn Monroe and Mitzi Gaynor all int he same movie, priceless!\n\nDiana took a hiatus after this, and returned in 1955 with Son of Sinbad, just one of the many “adventure on the high seas” that overcrowded the 1950s. Coincidentally, her last movie was also the last movie of Humphrey Bogart, The Harder They Fall, a superb study of the behind-the-scenes of the boxing world in the 1940s.\n\nPRIVATE LIFE:\n\nDiana was a seasoned chorus girl who hit the papers before she hit the movies, appearing in the Florentine gardens and in various musical revues as early as 1941.\n\nIn 1944, MGM contract player Lorraine Miller sued a distributor for using her photo and labeling it as Diana’s photo and circulating it amogn the GI-s. How did this happen I have no idea, as Diana herself was a very attractive woman who surely did not need a stand-in for any pin-up poses she did (as a testament to her pin up prowess, she was in the Yank Cover Weekly).\n\nIn 1945 she was voted the Prettiest girl in the world and by her fellow pin up girl/chorines, no less! Truly, Diana had the perfect look for the 1940s/1950s pin up girl – a pleasing, round face and a lean, elegant figure.\n\nIn late 1945 Diana married Richard Allord, who was married to Marie McDonald for a brief time in 1940. The marriage proved to be equally brief, ending in 1946. She wasted no time in looking for a beau, and came very close to getting married to millionaire Eddie Torres in November 1946.\n\nDiana married James Carlos Hernandez on September 30, 1951. Born in New York in 1920 to Frank Hernandez and Edna Considine, he attended college while living in Westchester, New York, and served his country in WW2. Their son, James Carlos Hernandez, was born on September 4, 1954.\n\nDiana and James divorced in September 1968. Hernandez died in 1998.\n\nDiana Mumby died on may 19, 1974 in Westlake, California.\n\nThe stunning blonde amazon was a short lived Hollywood extra, following suit of many other Goldwyn girls.\n\nEARLY LIFE:\n\nMay Florence Lundin was born on February 9, 1922, in Los Angeles, California, to Carl Ludin and his wife, Selma Lenden. Both of her parents were born in Sweden. Her older sister, Gerda, was born in California in 1918.\n\nFlorence grew up in Los Angeles. Her parents separated sometime during the the 1930s. In 1940, Florence lived with her mother, sister and brother-in-law (Keith Garrick) and nephew in Los Angeles and worked as a model.\n\nShe trained as a stenographer at J C Fremont high school and was dancing as a junior hostess at Hollywood Canteen when discovered by MGM’s Ida Koverman (Koverman was Louis B. Meyer’s secretary and a very influential woman). She signed a contract with M G M and the following day was loaned out for Up in Arms.\n\nCAREER:\n\nFlorence had a very, very minor career. She appeared in only four movies, all uncredited.\n\nShe made her movie debut long before she was noticed by Ida Koverman, in 1941, by appearing in Hitchhike to Hell, an exploitation movie. Needless to say, it’s a low quality work of dubious reputee, and it is even possible that Florence appeared in more of these movies to cash in some loot.\n\nHer first proper movie was Broadway Rhythm, where she played a autograph seeker. A imdb reviewer wrote nicely of the movie:\n\nA pleasing enough entertainment, working primarily as a pageant of various MGM specialty acts – impressionists, contortionists, nightclub acts, tap-dancers, as well as the standard musical theatrical numbers. The film isn’t a musical in the traditional sense, as all the musical numbers are in the contest of an actual performance (some done toward the camera). It’s much more in the tradition of a 1960s-70s variety TV show.\n\nIn other words, it’s a typical bread and butter musical with the “it was always there but you never saw it” theme. For a newcomer like Florence this was not the worst way to start a career.\n\nBeing a tall and shapely Teutonic maiden, Florence was cast a one of the Goldwyn girls in Up in Arms. Again, I am not writing any more about this movie. Obviously a huge number of nice looking girls appeared in it, and Florence was just one of the masses.\n\nFlorence’s last appearance was in Meet the People.A modest film with no big production values, it’s far from a very good movie but it fits the bill of a mid tier musical. Lucille Ball and Dick Powell aretypically good in the leads, plus is features some other MGM musical stock actors and actresses like Virginia O’Brien, Bert Lahr and June Allyson.\n\nAfter this, Florence got divorced and probably left Hollywood.\n\nPRIVATE LIFE:\n\nFlorence hit the papers before she even made a proper movie debut. Due to her “Scandinavian blond” good looks, she was a sought after girl about town as early as 1940. She dated noted songwriter Garwood Van, but hit the jackpot when she was noticed by Franchot Tone. She happily let the two men vie for her affections. Franchot won out, but he was a all around charmer, dating Peggy Moran at the same time. Franchot, ever the perfect gentleman, used to wine and dine Florence at the Beachcomber’s, a famous sea food restaurant in Los Angeles. Predictably, it did not last long.\n\nFlorence married actor Robert Conway in 1941. He was born on June 12, 1908 in Chicago, Illinois as Robert Anderson.\n\nFlorence gave birth to twin daughters, Jeannette Kathryn Andersen and Judith Anne Andersen on April 27, 1942. Sadly, her marriage to Andersen was a very troubled one, and they separated in September 1943. She went back home to her mother Selma, and never returned. They divorced in 1944.\n\nI have no idea what happened to Florence afterwards. IMDB lists her death on January 23, 1961, but I could not find any Florence, born on February 9, 1922, who died on that day. There is a whole list of women named Florence born on February 9, 1922 who died at a later date, ranging from 1980s until 2000s, and our Florence could be any of these women.\n\nWhat I do know is that Florence’s sister, Gerda Garrick, died on 2000. Her former husband, Robert Conway, died in 1969.\n\nAnother Goldwyn girl that never broke from the uncredited tier. Nothing new here, but Virginia Cruzon was so much more – she was a true and blue working gal who supported not only herself but her mother and seamlessly switched to a career in the oil industry after her Hollywood years were over.\n\nEARLY LIFE:\n\nVirginia Monroe was born on May 25, 1921, in San Francisco, California to Albert Harold Monroe and Mabel Maude Babb.\n\nShe had four older brothers and sisters: a unnamed sister, who was born in 1908 and died a few months later in 1909, Phyllis Morine, born in 1909, Muriel Nadine, born in cca. 1913, Harold Richard Monroe, born in 1916.\n\nHer parents divorced not long after her birth. In 1930, she was living in the house of Garfield Stanley Kirkpatrick, with her mother acting as his housekeeper.\n\nVirginia attended high school in Los Angeles, but completed only the first two grades before dropping out to try her hand at the showbiz career. She worked as a usher at the Grauman’s Chinese Theater and graduated to a chorus girl not long after. She worked for five, six years before becoming a Goldwyn Girl (she was also an Earl Carroll girl for a brief time), and then got into movies.\n\nFILMOGRAPHY:\n\nVirginia had two breaks into movies before she finally settled into it (but she never did get any credits). Her first experience was in George White’s 1935 Scandals. For ambitious chorus girls who wanted to taste the movie life, George White’s movies were paradise. A man well known for his taste in women, and, much like Busby Berkeley, George White made lavish musicals featuring a large number of dancers. Also like Berkeley, his movies had a paper thin plot, the lead was normally a Mary Sue and characters were mostly one dimensional. The above mentioned movie is no different, it’s pure escapist fare you watch once and forget soon after. The charismatic lead, Alice Faye, lends the movie a warm flavor but it’s not a top achievement.\n\nFast forward to 1941, and to Virginia’s second movie, Ziegfeld Girl. Co directed by Busby, top notch production values and with several huge stars in the cast, what could go wrong? Nothing did go wrong, but it’s most definitely not a legendary movie well known to the masses like Gone with the wind. And then again a hiatus from the industry.\n\nVirginia made the cusp of her filmography in 1944/45. Up in Arms was her last Goldwyn girl appearance. As mentioned several times of this site, it’s a fluffy, happy go lucky movie, perfect for a Sunday afternoon viewing, with very charming leads (Danny Kaye and Dinah Shore).\n\nHaving Wonderful Crime was one of Carole Landis’s last worthwhile movies. She would die three years after the movie was released, in 1948, but the rest of her filmography is dismal to say at least. While this movie is no big work of art, it’s still a decent screwball comedy. Some gags are repetitive and hardly funny, but Carole Landis is superb in her role, and George O’Brien is as good as usual in his stock role. The story of course, expects a total suspension of belief on the side of the viewer, but that is to be expected from a WW2 comedy.\n\nA Thousand and One Nights is the movie that gave the people what they wanted – exotic escapism. it’s full of colors, fancy costumes and endearing musical numbers. Characters come and go, there is no structure of indeed a decent plot, but who cares? it’s not that kind of a movie to start with. Conrel Wilde and Evelyn Keyes make a handsome couple.\n\nVirginia had more of the same by appearing in George White’s Scandals. Nothing more needs to be added. A typical George White movie with Virginia in the chorus.\n\nShadowed was a run of the mill Columbia crime quickie. One Sunday Afternoon isd a movie that tries to chew more than it can swallow – why? Because it’s a remake of “Strawberry blonde“, a superb movie with James Cagney, Rita Hayworth and Olivia de Havilland. Need I mention that surpassing one of these thespians is hard work, but surpassing all three is down right impossible. Cagney owns the rough but lovable Irishman stereotype and nobody, but nobody could put him in shade. Dennis Morgan, the lead in One Sunday Afternoon, was always a passable actor bu tno big talent (he was a great singer, but actor? Meh). Janis Paige and Dorothy Malone, while very good actresses in their own right, do not peg down the roles sufficiently. The end result is a pale remake, completely overshadowed by it’s older brother.\n\nEmergency Wedding was a bright spot on Virginia’s filmography. It’s a low key, funny, gentle movie about male-female relationships and the meaning of work in one’s life. The cast is made out of highly reliable actors and actresses that never achieved huge fame – Larry Parks, Barbara Hale, Willard Parker, Una Merkel and so on. Great comedic moments, good romantic tension, a clear message, it’s a movie that shows what was so right with Hollywood in the 1950s.\n\nVirginia retired from movies after this.\n\nPRIVATE LIFE:\n\nVirginia came into the media spotlight after Ziegfeld Girl. The movie had some extensive publicity, with the Ziegfeld girls from the movie wearing the newest fashions and doing tours all over the US. A brilliant press agent send Virginia and Myrna Dell to New York for the festivities to promote the movie, and claimed both never set foot outside Los Angeles county. Since Virginia was born in San Francisco, it’s clear what a fad that was.\n\nThe press was also inventive in her life story: she was depicted as a poor girl working in a factory who was pushed out of that mundane life by a talent scout who started pulling strings to have her become a chorine. Not quite true – in 1940, her official occupation was being a photo model, not a factory worker!\n\nVirginia continued to appear in variety and revue shows even after her movie career started, and supported her mother all the while. She appeared as a in Ken Murray’s Blackouts several years in a row, proving her mantle as a comedienne.\n\nVirginia’s first known beau was producer Robert “Bob” Sherwood. Nina Orla was also vying for his attention, but Virginia won hands down.\n\nVirginia married Rex W. Whaley, a movie splicer, on May 29, 1944 . Whaley was born in Oklahoma in 1918 and since the 1930s lived in Los Angeles where he raised his three younger sisters with the help of an aunt.\n\nVirginia gave up movies not long after for started working for the Chevron Oil Company. She and Rex resided in Glendale in 1955. They divorced in 1956.\n\nVirginia married Stephen H. Sanders on April 26, 1957. Their daughter Virginia Jocelyn Sanders was born on June 3, 1958. They divorced in February 1968.\n\nVirginia retired from Chevron Oil Company in 1988, and moved to Lamarie, Wyoming to enjoy her golden years.\n\nVirginia Sanders died on August 21, 2010, in Lamarie, Wyoming."
