        "text": "ST. GEORGE — Casting calls are not so common this far out into the desert, but it seems Kevin Costner is no longer just branding cowboys on TV, he’s claiming the entire landscape as part of his brand with a new feature film series “Horizon: An American Saga,” and the films require hundreds of extras.\n\nThe first installment of the saga will debut at the Cannes Film Festival on May 19, and later be introduced to the world in theaters on June 28. Casting coordinators Jessie Vanatta and Maryellen Aviano are searching for actors who can film ASAP to wrap the second installment. Filming for the third installment will begin in August, Vanatta said.\n\nWho can apply?\n\nThe casting call encouraged all ethnicities and all ages to apply, but Vanatta said ages 6 and up are ideal. She also said family units are “great,” and if applying together can submit just one application.\n\nNo experience is required, but the casting department does need to be notified of previous experience on the first installment of “Horizon: An American Saga,” and the respective roles played.\n\n“This info is very important in case we have matching scenes as well as brand new scenes,” the call stated.\n\nIt also mentioned a “special abilities” category, where those who have horseback riding experience, blacksmithing, or other work with livestock can specify. The call emphasized that safety should always be first, and asked applicants to be honest.\n\n“Filming days can be long and typically take place outdoors, usually from sun up to sundown with super early reporting times, hot/dirty/dusty sets, animals working, and locations are usually outside of town so must have reliable transportation,” the call stated.\n\nCompensation\n\nGeneral extras are eligible for $150 for 12 hours, and an overtime amount will kick in after 12 hours, Vanatta said. Applicants who are selected for special abilities will be paid at a higher rate depending on the scenes required.\n\nVanatta said one day or multiple days of work are available.\n\nHow to apply\n\nApplications can be sent by email to HorizonFilmExtras@gmail.com with the subject line “St. George Extra.”\n\nPer the casting call, emails should include the following to be considered:"
