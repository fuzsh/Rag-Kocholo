        "text": "The award aims to encourage and give visibility to quality home entertainment Dvd and Blu-Ray from around the world. The competition is open to Dvd and Blu-Ray released between March 2014 and March 2015 of important films made prior to 1985 (at least thirty years ago) and thus generally in line with the festival’s theme. The awards are divided into five categories: Best Dvd 2014/2015, Best Blu-Ray 2014/2015, Best Special Features (bonus), Best Rediscovery of a Forgotten Film, Best Series/Best Box.\n\nThe jury (Lorenzo Codelli, Alexander Horwath, Lucien Logette, Marc McElhatten, Paolo Mereghetti, Jonathan Rosenbaum)\n\nFinalists\n\nPalmares 2015\n\nBEST DVD (THE PETER VON BAGH AWARD)\n\nTHE HOUSE OF MYSTERY/LA MAISON DU MYSTÈRE\n\n(France/ 1921-1923, Alexandre Volkoff), Flicker Alley, LLC and The Blackhawk Films Collection\n\nTHE HOUSE OF MYSTERY, starring the redoubtable Ivan Mosjoukine, is one of the most outstanding film serials of any era–thrillingly inventive and distinctively different from Feuillade or Gaston Ravel–and the only serial of the three produced by Albatross known to have survived. Peter von Bagh brought this film to Bologna during his early years as artistic director of Il Cinema Ritrovato, and it remains a shining example of analogic restoration.\n\nBEST BLU-RAY\n\nTHE CONNECTION: PROJECT SHIRLEY VOL. 1\n\n(USA/1961, Shirley Clarke), Milestone Film & Video\n\nPORTRAIT OF JASON: PROJECT SHIRLEY VOL. 2\n\n(USA/1967, Shirley Clarke), Milestone Film & Video\n\nORNETTE: MADE IN AMERICA: PROJECT SHIRLEY VOL. 3\n\n(USA/1984, Shirley Clarke), Milestone Film & Video\n\nMilestone’s laudable dedication to preserving and disseminating the work of one of the pioneers of the New American Cinema, the indefatigable Shirley Clarke, is a painstaking labor of love that deserves top recognition. This company is doing something exceptional: restoring each title on film, distributing each title on film, and releasing continuing anthologies of shorts and features digitally.\n\nBEST DVD SERIES / BEST BOX\n\nCAMERA OBSCURA: THE WALERIAN BOROWCZYK COLLECTION\n\n(Poland-France/1959-1975), Arrow Films\n\nAn exemplary box set that displays impeccable research and thoroughness. The transfers are fantastic and even the choices made in subtitling are graphically superior compared to most of the releases we have considered. This edition of Arrow Films is a model of generosity, imagination, and intelligence in its groundwork and presentation. A work of art in itself.\n\nBEST REDISCOVERY OF A FORGOTTEN FILM (ON DVD)\n\nLES HAUTES SOLITUDES\n\n(France/1974, Philippe Garrel), RE:VOIR Vidéo\n\nAn experimental film, both humane and desperate, LES HAUTES SOLITUDES re-emerges from a forgotten past thanks to the excellent edition of Re-Voir Video. Garrel meets the challenge of filming Jean Seberg without any need for words or a story, thanks to the sweet tenderness of a camera that has managed to explore the face of a very famous actress in the past, and in 1974, at the time of the filming, on the edge of alcoholism and depression. He is able to disclose all her deepest secrets. A bold, must-see film.\n\nBLÁZNOVA KRONIKA/A JESTER’S TALE\n\n(Czechoslovakia/1964, Karel Zeman), Second Run DVD\n\nKarel Zeman is finally back. BLÁZNOVA KRONIKA is one of his works where all the peculiarities of his style are harmoniously mixed: life and dream, comedy and drama, naïveté (actual or presumed) and poetry, highlighted by the special effects. This film, unknown for too many years, testifies to the unique personality of one of the most talented Czech filmmaker of the second half of the 1900s.\n\nBEST SPECIAL FEATURES\n\nLES BLANK: ALWAYS FOR PLEASURE\n\n(USA/1968-2005), The Criterion Collection\n\nYum, Yum, Yum! It is a real pleasure to enjoy 22 “recipes”, cooked, spiced up, and served by chef-filmmaker Les Blank (1935-2013). An astonishing output produced in total independence from 1968 to 2005, restored in 2K. Blank takes Flaherty-style journeys to Creole and Cajun communities, Texas and New Orleans’ jazz-lands, Flower Power, and beyond. A booklet, interviews, outtakes, and glimpses of unfinished projects bring back to life “the chronicler of what America is all about at its best,” as his old pal Werner Herzog describes him.\n\nSPECIAL MENTION\n\nTHE MARCEL PEREZ COLLECTION\n\n(Italia-USA/1911-1921, Marcel Perez) Undercrank Productions (Dvd)\n\nTHE MACK SENNETT COLLECTION. VOLUME ONE\n\n(USA/1909-1933) Flicker Alley, Keystone Films, LLC; CineMuseum, LLC (Blu-ray)\n\nPERSONAL CHOICES\n\nThe jurors would like to stress that none of us is in a position to know all the important DVD and Blu-Ray releases, even though all of us have encountered important examples, some of which were not nominated for awards but deserve in any case to be far better known. So five of us have selected one or more personal favorites that he would like to recommend. (Although Mark McElhatten wasn’t able to attend the festival this year, and decided not offer a personal selection, he was an active member of the jury, and even furnished many of the above notes.)\n\nLorenzo Codelli: Maclean Rogers’ I’LL WALK BESIDE YOU (UK/1943) and Carol Reed’s THE STARS LOOK DOWN (UK/1939), Renown Pictures (both DVDs).\n\nLucien Logette: LE BONHEUR EST POUR DEMAIN (Les documents cinématographiques, on DVD) is a lost film, unseen since 1962, the only feature of Henri Fabiani, a documentarist once known but subsequently forgotten. This is one of the only treatments of the working class in the French cinema of this period, and it implicitly anticipates the social upheavels that would come soon afterwards.\n\nAlexander Horwath: ERSTER WELTKRIEG ARCHIV EDITION.\n\nDvd 1: DAS ALTE EUROPA AM VORABEND SEINES UNTERGANGS.\n\nDvd 2: AUFMARSCH DER ARMEEN (1900-1915) Deutsches Filminstitut, Absolut Medien;\n\nLES CROIX DE BOIS (Francia/1932, Raymond Bernard), Pathé Distribution;\n\nTHE BATTLES OF CORONEL AND FALKLAND ISLANDS (GB/1927, Walter Summers), BFI\n\nJ’ACCUSE (Francia/1919, Abel Gance), Lobster Films\n\nPaolo Mereghetti: RENÉ VAUTIER EN ALGÉRIE – Éditions les Mutins de Pangée.\n\nJonathan Rosenbaum has selected CHARLEY VARRICK/DER GROSSE COUP, an exceptional German Blu-Ray released by Koch Media GmbH of Don Siegel’s neglected and beautifully structured heist thriller of 1973, with extras that include a remarkably intelligent and detailed making-of documentary by Robert Fischer."
