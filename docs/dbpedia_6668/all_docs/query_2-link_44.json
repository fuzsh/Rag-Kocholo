        "text": "Pettingell retires from the mill he has built up, leaving it in the hands of nephew Helmore. A widow looking for a rich husband brings him into high society, but the socialites make fun of him and his Yorkshire manners. All his new friends desert him when the uninsured mill burns down, so he marries his likable housekeeper and goes back to work rebuilding the mill. Good performance by Pettingell helps this otherwise standard comedy."
