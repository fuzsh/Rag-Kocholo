        "text": "Uber Eats #superbowl 2024 TVC is easily one of my favourites üòÇüòÇ David and Jennifer's \"Like I could forget 10 years of my life!\" is hilarious... And Beckham and Posh Spice's, \"Paprika gal?\" is downright funny. This is such a great time of the year for creativity. Excellent (and sometimes terrible!) films for sure. But also some of the activations (Doritos on the Luxor!), and moment marketing (2023 Carters Inc. billboard!). Let the action begin ü•Åü•Åü•Å #advertisingandmarketing #brandbuilding #\n\nI have ‚Äúmy‚Äù table in a few bars and restaurants. When that table is taken by someone else, I feel robbed just as I would if someone stole an actual, legal possession of mine. Ever had that feeling? On the other hand, I feel absolutely no attachment to the Uber car I rode in yesterday. I barely remember it. So why do you feel attached to your Spotify history and your social media profiles but not to the Uber cars you ride in? It's called psychological ownership and it is the key to client retention and loyalty. Spotify and EasyJet do this extremely well.

Granted, there are many aspects to this that just won‚Äôt allow it for an operational business model in pizza delivery at this time, but it does afford some key insights. * can the tech be refined for safety, environmental friendliness, and operational ROI. * could this concept be applicable to either business or societal issues where time is of the essence and the operational cost is acceptable. * what can be done to make the jet pack idea improved for safety? Segway arrived at key safety features for its Segway machines, can this jetback become more innovative. * do humans actually need to be in the jet pack? Why not humanoid robots, which could offer more potential of what item/expertise is delivered. The only way to truly innovate is to try something, sometimes that innovation is not understand by the masses on the first go, but it is needed to refine the bigger picture or even determine that a concept may need shelved. #innovation #techadvancements #frontiertech #emergingtech #flybyjetpack #dominospizza\n\nIt sounds like you're looking to build and grow your insurance agency effectively!
