        "text": "June Clyde was likable, but this British movie was basically uninteresting. What caught my attention was the production company - George Smith Productions. They made 40+ films in the 30s and I've barely seen any of them, which might make it the British company I've seen the lowest percentage from for that decade. This is my 3rd, and all I've rated the same low score, which makes me think it's not such a big deal that I have a big gigantic hole in their filmography."
