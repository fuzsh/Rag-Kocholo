        "text": "With “Wolf Creek 2,” the director Greg McLean returns once more to remind us that the back of beyond — in this case, the Australian outback — is a perilous destination for unwary tourists. But those of us who championed its 2005 precursor, the artfully petrifying “Wolf Creek,” neither need nor want reminding. Like Neil Marshall’s “The Descent,” another crazy-good frightener released in America the following year, “Wolf Creek” deserved to stand alone, a uniquely moody and melancholy blood bath.\n\nEven more inadvisable was the decision (whether made by Mr. McLean or his backers) to transform the mercurial psychopath Mick Taylor (a truly menacing John Jarratt) into a roguish cartoon. His once-terrifying bonhomie tamed, Mick has been reimagined as a chortling, xenophobic butcher who enjoys a singalong of “Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport” and dismembers his victims with the help of Patsy Cline’s “I Fall to Pieces.”\n\nThis diminishment continues with a plot (by Mr. McLean and Aaron Sterns) that involves little more than Mick’s terrorizing one innocent backpacker after another (though Ryan Corr is spunkily effective as a wily captive with above-average escape skills). Gone is the emphasis on Mick’s creepy mining-camp lair; in its place is the open road, where Mr. McLean stages a series of slick car chases — and a nod to Steven Spielberg’s “Duel” — with a brio that completely displaces the original film’s despairing chills."
