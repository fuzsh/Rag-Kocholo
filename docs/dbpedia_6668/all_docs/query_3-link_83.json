        "text": "Dusty Springfield\n\nAllmusic Biography : Britains greatest pop diva, Dusty Springfield was also the finest white soul singer of her era, a performer of remarkable emotional resonance whose body of work spans the decades and their attendant musical transformations with a consistency and purity unmatched by any of her contemporaries; though a camp icon of glamorous excess in her towering beehive hairdo and panda-eye black mascara, the sultry intimacy and heartbreaking urgency of Springfields voice transcended image and fashion, embracing everything from lushly orchestrated pop to gritty R&B; to disco with unparalleled sophistication and depth. She was born Mary OBrien on April 16, 1939, and raised on an eclectic diet of classical music and jazz, coming to worship Peggy Lee; after completing her schooling she joined the Lana Sisters, a pop vocal trio which issued a few singles on Fontana before dissolving. In 1960, upon teaming with her brother Dion O Brien and his friend Tim Feild in the folk trio the Springfields, OBrien adopted the stage name Dusty Springfield; thanks to a series of hits including \"Breakaway,\" \"Bambino,\" and \"Say I Wont Be There,\" the group was soon the U.K.s best-selling act.\n\nAfter the Springfields cracked the U.S. Top 20 in 1962 with \"Silver Threads and Golden Needles,\" the group traveled stateside to record in Nashville, where exposure to the emerging American girl-group and Motown sounds impacted Dusty so profoundly that in 1963 she left the Springfields at the peak of their fame to pursue a solo career. Her first single, \"I Only Want to Be With You,\" boasted a dramatic sound and soulful melody worthy of a Phil Spector hit, and it quickly reached the British Top Five; it also fell just shy of the Top Ten in the U.S., where it became the first major record from a U.K. act other than the Beatles since the Fab Fours launch of the British Invasion. Her biggest American Top Ten hit, \"Wishin and Hopin,\" was the first in a series of Springfield smashes from the pen of songwriters Burt Bacharach and Hal David; she would subsequently cover Bacharach/David classics including \"Anyone Who Had a Heart\" and \"I Just Dont Know What to Do With Myself,\" surpassed only by Dionne Warwick as the finest interpreter of the duos songs.\n\nAdditionally charting with hits including \"Stay Awhile\" and \"All Cried Out,\" by the end of 1964 Springfield was arguably the biggest solo act in British pop, winning the first of four consecutive Best Female Vocalist honors in NME; that same year, she also created a political furor after she was deported from South Africa for refusing to play in front of racially segregated audiences. Returning to England, in 1965 Springfield hosted the television special The Sound of Motown, a show widely credited with introducing the Sound of Young America to the their British counterparts, and continued racking up smashes like \"Losing You,\" \"Your Hurtin Kinda Love,\" and \"In the Middle of Nowhere\"; in 1966, she scored her biggest international hit with the devastating ballad \"You Dont Have to Say You Love Me,\" which topped the U.K. charts and reached the Top Five in the U.S. The soundalike \"All I See Is You,\" another heart-wrenching evocation of unrequited love, soon reached the British Top Ten as well; it was followed, however, by the Bacharach/David-penned \"The Look of Love,\" a bossa nova-inflected classic positively radiating with dreamlike sensuousness.\n\nBy 1968, however, Springfields commercial fortunes were on the decline -- in the wake of psychedelia and the Summer of Love, \"girl singers\" were now widely perceived as little more than fluff. In response, she signed to the American label Atlantic, traveling to Memphis to record with producers Jerry Wexler, Tom Dowd, and Arif Mardin; the resulting album, issued in early 1969 as Dusty in Memphis, remains her masterpiece, a perfect marriage of pop and soul stunning in its emotional complexity and earthy beauty. Although the classic single \"Son of a Preacher Man\" cracked the Top Ten on both sides of the pond, the album itself was nevertheless a commercial failure, as was its fine 1970 follow-up, A Brand New Me, recorded in Philadelphia with the input of the songwriting/production team of Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. After completing 1972s See All Her Faces, Springfield relocated from London to New York City, eventually settling in Los Angeles; there she signed to ABC/Dunhill and recorded 1973s Cameo, another critical success which like its predecessors made virtually no impact on the charts.\n\nA projected follow-up, Longings, was abandoned prior to its completion, and apart from singing backup on Anne Murrays Together album, Springfield spent the mid-70s outside of music while battling substance abuse problems. She finally resurfaced in 1978 with the Roy Thomas Baker-produced It Begins Again, followed a year later by Living Without Your Love; both attracted little notice, although the non-album single \"Baby Blue\" was a minor British hit in 1979. Apart from a handful of soundtrack contributions, Springfield was silent until returning to London in 1982 to record White Heat, an album firmly grounded in the prevailing synth-pop sound of its times; again, despite good critical notices, a comeback failed to materialize. She would release just a handful of singles over the next few years, including the 1984 Spencer Davis duet \"Private Number,\" the 1985 ballad \"Sometimes Like Butterflies,\" and a 1987 collaboration with Richard Carpenter, \"Something in Your Eyes,\" which became a minor success in the U.S.\n\nUpon returning to California in 1987, Springfield was contacted to collaborate with techno-pop innovators the Pet Shop Boys on a duet titled \"What Have I Done to Deserve This?\" The single was a global blockbuster, peaking at number two in both the U.S. and the U.K., and it introduced her to a new generation of listeners; Pet Shop Boys Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe also agreed to produce a handful of tracks for 1990s Reputation, which became Springfields best-selling new album since her 60s-era peak. The follow-up, 1995s country-influenced A Very Fine Love, was recorded in Nashville; during sessions for the album, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and after months of radiation therapy the illness was believed to be in remission. By the summer of 1996, however, the cancer had returned, and on March 2, 1999, Springfield died at the age of 59; just ten days later, she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Includes tracks such as Springfields devastating cover of \"Will You Love Me Tomorrow.\" If shed never recorded another LP, Springfield would still have been a legend, based on the contents of this one release.

Besides the two hit title tracks, Dusty covers various American soul and pop tunes that usually rank at least equal to the originals, in some cases totally outclassing them. In particular, she improves upon \"24 Hours From Tulsa,\" \"Anyone Who Had a Heart,\" \"You Dont Own Me,\" and \"When the Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes.\" The production is the most credible approximation of the Phil Spector wall of sound ever managed in the U.K., with full brass and strings, soulful female backup choruses, and pounding piano and drums. Also includes a first-rate Springfield original, \"Somethin Special.\" Album: 3 of 41\n\nTitle: Dusty\n\nReleased: 1964-10\n\nTracks: 15\n\nDuration: 43:55\n\nScroll: Up Down Top Bottom 25% 50% 75%\n\nSpotify Allmusic Wikipedia AlbumCover 1 All Cried Out (03:04)\n\n2 I Wish Id Never Loved You (03:38)\n\n3 Can I Get a Witness (02:45)\n\n4 Summer Is Over (03:45)\n\n5 Dont Say It Baby (02:25)\n\n6 Guess Who?

Standouts include the cover of Bacharach-Davids \"I Just Dont Know What to Do with Myself\" (a British hit), \"All Cried Out,\" and the epic ballad \"Summer Is Over,\" which foreshadows the style shed use on her later hit \"You Dont Have to Say You Love Me.\" Album: 4 of 41\n\nTitle: Evârythingâs Coming Up Dusty\n\nReleased: 1965\n\nTracks: 21\n\nDuration: 55:30\n\nScroll: Up Down Top Bottom 25% 50% 75%\n\nSpotify Allmusic Wikipedia AlbumCover 1 Wonât Be Long (03:22)\n\n2 Oh No!

The British version also appeared as a gatefold, filled with a series of beautiful photographs and extensive notes. More to the point, this second album presented a more mature Dusty Springfield, doing songs by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley, Randy Newman and co., although all of the material here -- even \"Who Can I Turn To,\" from the musical The Roar of the Greasepaint -- still has a soulful edge. Moreover, she scales new heights of passion on Rod Argents \"If It Dont Work Out\" and the ethereal \"Thats How Heartaches Are Made,\" and seems close to bursting her lungs on Gerry Goffin and Carole Kings \"I Cant Hear You.\" A little more than half of this album -- mostly the up-tempo numbers -- was recorded with her on-stage backing group the Echoes, and they have a nice, lean band sound that was also a departure from the lushly orchestrated, outsized production of her early singles sides. The whole record comes off as perhaps the greatest Motown album that was never made by Motown, and has a pleasing unity in its British form that the U.S. version lacks. Evrythings Coming Up Dusty has been reissued twice on CD, first in 1990 from BGO Records and again, in 1998, from Philips Records in England, augmented with eight bonus tracks, all songs that she recorded in September of 1964 with producer Shelby Singleton and arranger Ray Stevens, most of which turned up in America on the Ooooooweeee! album, but three of which were unreleased in England until the issue of the Philips CD.

But whether shes covering songs by Goffin-King (\"Oh No! Not My Baby,\" \"I Cant Hear You\"), Burt Bacharach (\"Long After Tonight Is Over\"), Randy Newman (\"Ive Been Wrong Before\"), or Ragavoy and Russell (\"It Was Easier to Hurt Him\"), she makes it come out in her most alluring R&B style. There are a few breaks in the mood, like a less than compelling \"La Bamba\" and a rendition of \"Who Can I Turn To\" thats close in spirit to Dionne Warwick at her poppiest, but generally Springfield is consistently superb here, even elevating Rod Argents \"If It Dont Work Out\" in an achingly soulful rendition. The 1999 Mercury reissue contains a trio of tracks never before issued in the U.S. \"Doodlin\" and \"Packin Up\" are lively enough, and the latter features an uncredited guitar solo, a first on a Springfield record and a fine counterpoint to her lusty, shouted performance, but the real jewel is her poignant, lyrical rendition of \"Thats How Heartaches Are Made.\" Album: 7 of 41\n\nTitle: Golden Hits\n\nReleased: 1966-10-07\n\nTracks: 10\n\nDuration: 28:05\n\nScroll: Up Down Top Bottom 25% 50% 75%\n\nAlbumCover 1 All Cried Out (03:05)\n\n2 All I See Is You (03:23)\n\n3 I Just Dont Know What To Do With Myself (03:04)\n\n4 I Only Want to Be with You (02:36)\n\n5 In the Middle of Nowhere (02:49)\n\n6 Little by Little (02:20)\n\n7 Losing You (03:03)\n\n8 Stay A While (01:58)\n\n9 Wishin and Hopin (02:54)\n\n10 You Dont Have To Say You Love Me (02:50)\n\nAlbum: 8 of 41\n\nTitle: Where Am I Going?\n\nReleased: 1967\n\nTracks: 15\n\nDuration: 39:59\n\nScroll: Up Down Top Bottom 25% 50% 75%\n\nSpotify Allmusic AlbumCover 1 Bring Him Back (02:15)\n\n2 Dont Let Me Lose This Dream (02:26)\n\n3 I Cant Wait Until I See My Babys Face (02:41)\n\n4 Take Me for a Little While (02:23)\n\n5 Chained to a Memory (02:37)\n\n6 Sunny (01:55)\n\n7 (They Long to Be) Close to You (02:27)\n\n8 Welcome Home (02:40)\n\n9 Come Back to Me (02:05)\n\n10 If You Go Away (03:52)\n\n11 Broken Blossoms (02:43)\n\n12 Where Am I Going?

The LP cover is great -- a black-and-white photo of a smiling Springfield with wide-brimmed hat, mini skirt, and a comic book quotation in psychedelic off-pink and orange asking Where Am I Going? The music inside, with strings and orchestration, is a relentless delight. The Pat Williams arrangement of Bobby Hebbs \"Sunny\" with conductor Peter Knight reveals a touch of the James Bond riff, a definite sign of the times. One can hear the wondrous voices of Madeline Bell and Lesley Duncan, the backing vocals blending perfectly with the orchestration in songs like \"I Cant Wait Until I See My Babys Face\" and \"Dont Let Me Lose This Dream.\" \"Where Am I Going?\" is as perfectly surreal as its title suggests -- imagine Julie Andrews in The Sound of Music twirling around in the windmills of Springfields mind. This is not the driving pop of \"I Only Want to Be with You\" or \"Wishin & Hopin,\" this is symphonic adult contemporary. \"They Long to Be Close to You\" is the serious and dramatic blues that the Carpenters aspired to develop. \"Welcome Home\" is out-of-this world rhythm & blues told with authority. It and other tracks from Where Am I Going? puts Springfield in that elite class reserved for the best of Janis Joplin, Etta James, and Ella Fitzgerald -- female vocalists who found notes in niches of songs that were unavailable to lesser mortals. While Springfield was filling the airwaves in America with \"The Son of a Preacher Man\" toward the end of 1968, a band called Vanilla Fudge had \"Take Me for a Little While\" on the U.S. charts, but their disc was issued in July of 1967 and their success in the States was a delayed reaction. Dusty Springfield takes that great composition and turns it into snappy pop with an amazing vocal. Add \"If You Go Away\" and the musicians on these grooves take the listener on a wild ride running the gamut of genres without disrupting Where Am I Going?s flow. This is a tremendous and often forgotten masterpiece in the repertoire of Dusty Springfield which deserves more attention. It truly is the record which keeps on giving.

As was the case with several of her 1960s albums, it explored a bunch of directions besides soul and rock, some well, some not so well. The cover of Erma Franklin/Big Brothers \"Piece of My Heart\" (titled \"Take Another Little Piece of My Heart\" here for some reason) was excellent and would have been way up to par for inclusion in Dusty in Memphis, and \"Aint No Sun Since Youve Been Gone\" was pretty storming blue-eyed Motown-styled soul. On the other hand, the covers of Charles Aznavours \"Who (Will Take My Place)\" and Bacharach-Davids \"This Girls in Love with You\" put her forth as an interpreter of popular ballad standards that could have been done for the most mainstream cabaret gig. The readings of Randy Newmans \"I Think Its Going to Rain Today\" and the more obscure, but beautiful and lilting, \"Morning\" fell between the polar extremes, and were quite worthy. John Paul Jones, who was only just joining Led Zeppelin at the time, arranged a couple of the hotter cuts (\"Piece of My Heart\" and \"Aint No Sun Since Youve Been Gone\"). All but two of the songs were reissued on the Rhino collection Dusty in London, a 24-track survey of her British sessions from 1968-1971.

The idea of taking Englands reigning female soul queen to the home of the music she had mastered was an inspired one. The Jerry Wexler/Tom Dowd/Arif Mardin production and engineering team picked mostly perfect songs, and those that werent so great were salvaged by Springfields marvelous delivery and technique. This set has definitive numbers in \"So Much Love,\" \"Son of a Preacher Man,\" \"Breakfast in Bed,\" \"Just One Smile,\" \"I Dont Want to Hear About It Anymore,\" and \"Just a Little Lovin\" and three bonus tracks: an unreleased version of \"What Do You Do When Love Dies,\" \"Willie & Laura Mae Jones\" and \"That Old Sweet Roll (Hi-De-Ho).\" Its truly a disc deserving of its classic status.

One of those was the bossa nova-influenced title track, and she does another bossa nova-flavored number, \"Come for a Dream,\" co-written by Antonio Carlos Jobim. As always there were some really straight orchestrated pop ballads, like \"I Start Counting,\" and something that sounded like an attempt to emulate whatever was happening at Motown at the moment (\"Girls It Aint Easy\"). There were also some deep soul-speckled outings (the 1969 single of Tony Joe Whites \"Willie & Laura Mae Jones,\" Goffin & Kings \"That Old Sweet Roll (Hi-De-Ho)\"), and some half-decent cuts from early-seventies singles that Ellie Greenwich and Jeff Barry helped write (\"What Good Is I Love You,\" \"Nothing Is Forever\"). Eight of the tracks are on Rhinos compilation of 1968-71 British recordings, Dusty in London; all but one (\"Girls Cant Do What the Guys Do\") of the six remaining tracks appears as one of the bonus cuts on Rhinos reissues of Dusty in Memphis and A Brand New Me. If you live in the US, picking up all of these Rhino reissues, rather than hunting for the See All Her Faces album, seems like the way to go.

Springfield reinvents Van Morrisons \"Tupelo Honey,\" including a verse not among the enclosed lyrics nor heard on Morrisons familiar FM radio hit. What you can hear is a carefulness, not from the singer, but from the production team who worked in different degrees with the 1972 and 1975 Grass Roots. There is nothing disposable here, nothing of the throwaway nature found on portions of those Grass Roots discs. \"Learn to Say Goodbye\" is a masterpiece of tortured soul. Thankfully, it was included in the ABC movie of the week Say Goodbye, Maggie Cole and got some additional exposure, but for the label that brought \"Joy to the World\" by Three Dog Night to the multi-platinum level, ABCs failure to break this potential hit is glaring. Hugo Montenegro -- the man responsible for 1968s \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" theme -- co-wrote this, and it is superb. While Helen Reddy was filling the airwaves with \"Delta Dawn\" and \"Leave Me Alone (Ruby Red Dress),\" it was prime time for Dustys \"Learn to Say Goodbye\" or the brilliant opening track \"Who Gets Your Love\" to rescue radio listeners. That Lambert and Potter piece is outdone by their \"Breakin Up a Happy Home\" which follows. This is pure Philly sound, and with the help of Hal Blaine, Michael Omartian, and the everpresent Vanetta Fields and Clydie King, it is simply amazing that this album didnt get more attention. When Dusty Springfield takes on \"Easy Evil\" by frivolous songwriter Alan ODay -- the man who wrote \"Rock & Roll Heaven\" and sang \"Undercover Angel\" -- you understand she can do no wrong here. The production and the performance is top notch. \"Mamas Little Girl\" sounds like it inspired Gamble & Huffs Elton John hit \"Mama Cant Buy You Love,\" which came six years after this, the brilliance of Gamble and Huff clearly influencing Steve Barri and company. The choice of material is wonderful; David Gates \"The Other Side of Life\" shows how a song of his can blossom outside of the confines of his hit group, Bread. All 12 titles are sublime pop, some of the best Lambert and Potter youll find anywhere. What a hook they wrote for this artist with \"Comin and Goin,\" and what heart! It moves and grooves like one of those album tracks you wish was beat into your head on a daily basis by Top 40 radio. Ashford & Simpson can be very proud of \"I Just Wanna Be There\"; Springfield just claims the tune as her own, with horns and backing vocals creating the wave for her magical voice to ride. Audiences can get caught up in the hit records of an artist, and often they fail to seek out the material they never got familiar with. Universals Hip-O label has re-released Cameo under the new title Beautiful Soul with additional tracks. It hopefully will get people to hear Dusty Springfield take Willie Hutchisons \"Who Could Be Loving You Other Than Me\" to another realm. Just a wonderful, wonderful record.

A partial collaboration with the Pet Shop Boys, it proved to be her most satisfying record in 15 years and sold better than anything that shed released since the 60s. The late-80s synth pop sound melded perfectly with Springfields still very expressive, powerful, and soulful singing -- Dan Hartman handled the producing chores on four of the cuts, Andy Richards on one, and the album has a unified sound, at once airy and dense, soaring and deep. The best cuts, however, are the five produced (and, in all but one case, written) by Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe of the Pet Shop Boys. Much as Robert Fripp may have been put on this earth first and foremost to produce the Roches, Tennant and Lowes collaborations with Springfield are as satisfying and unified and whole as she ever achieved working with Jerry Wexler, Thom Bell, and Roland Chambers 20 years earlier. She seems to reach that much higher and also that much deeper inside of herself on \"In Private\" and \"Daydreaming\" to much subtler effect; those cuts are very much of a piece with her best work on the Dusty in Memphis, A Brand New Me, and Cameo albums, just later links in the same chain, and their effect is to leave the listener breathless and delighted with their sheer beauty as recordings, as well with as her performance.

Indeed, the performances and the songs here stack up favorably next to, say, Brand New Me, her early-70s intersection with Philly soul. One song here, \"Where Would I Be?,\" which features a duet with Daryl Hall, got a little play for being in the movie While You Were Sleeping, but otherwise, sad to say, this album passed relatively unnoticed for most of the public. The sounds are fairly diverse, including relatively subdued songs such as \"You Are the Storm,\" showing the softer side of her singing, but Springfield is at her best going full-out, backed by strings and a full band, as on \"Roll Away\" and \"Lovin Proof,\" which make this a very fine album, indeed.

This single-disc compilation covers her peak commercial years and includes her glorious signature tune, âSon of a Preacher Man,â as well as her exhausted, perfectly sung, and emotionally wrenching version of âYou Donât Have to Say You Love Me,â among other odds and ends from the mid- to late 60s.

Instead, its a neo-two-fer, containing ten songs written by Bacharach and David, and ten written by Goffin & King. This, of course, contains some big hits and signature songs -- \"Wishin and Hopin,\" \"Anyone Who Had a Heart,\" \"That Old Sweet Roll (Hi De Ho)\" -- but its not really a compilation for the casual listener; its for those who love Dusty and like to hear some of her best material in a different context. This context happens to make a lot of sense, and the end result is very enjoyable, but it may not be necessary for most listeners.

While the size of this set makes it a little impractical for fans who just want the hits, anyone who wants to dig deeper into her career will discover that she was one of the most consistent interpretive singers of the 60s, capable of sweet girl group pop, lush orchestral pop, and blue-eyed soul. Bypassing her early records with the Springfields and starting with her solo career in 1963, Anthology hits all the high points and features a number of fine, forgotten gems as well, making it essential for serious fans of Dusty, 60s pop, and blue-eyed soul.

(The major omission is \"The Windmills of Your Mind,\" a U.S. Top 40 hit, which was on Atlantic.) The more questionable elements on the album are the sequencing and the choice of mono and stereo takes. These problems are interrelated: if the compilation producer had opted for a chronological sequencing, the drastic aural differences between the early mono tracks and the later gimmicky, extreme (and, in at least one case, apparently fake) stereo tracks would not have been such a constant distraction to the listener. (So many tracks, even from as late as 1967, are in mono, that you wonder why they didnt just make the whole album mono.) And Springfields stylistic evolution would have been more coherent, too. Why, for example, put the 1968 \"Son of a Preacher Man\" its full stereo, American R&B-style; glory, as the fifth track, then follow it with the 1964 \"I Just Dont Know What to Do With Myself,\" in boxy mono with orchestral accompaniment? Of course, you can re-sequence the album on your CD player, but you shouldnt have to.

Atlantic chose to release only 1968-71 material that was recorded in the U.S., meaning that quite a few tracks she recorded in Britain during this time went unreleased stateside. This collects 24 of those songs Springfield recorded in the U.K. between 1968 and 1971, only a few which had appeared in the U.S. before. Although this is not as soul- and R&B-oriented; as the material Atlantic recorded with her in America during this era, in truth its not always that far removed in sound and spirit from what youll hear on the Atlantic albums Dusty in Memphis (1969) and A Brand New Me (1970). You cant get much more soulful than \"Piece of My Heart,\" for instance, a good cover of which leads off the collection. Overall, though, it takes in a broader range of pop styles than Springfield did with her American/Atlantic recordings, from covers of the Rascals (\"How Can I Be Sure\") and Goffin-King (\"Wasnt Born to Follow\") to Charles Aznavour, Leon Russell, Jimmy Webb, Bacharach-David, and Antonio Carlos Jobim. Most of its taken from the British albums Dusty Definitely (1968) and See All Her Faces (1972), and its lower on standout performances than the familiar Atlantic albums are. The singing is almost always involved and committed, but sometimes the material is pedestrian. The highlights are very good, however, including Randy Newmans \"I Think Its Going to Rain Today,\" the beautiful string ballad \"Morning,\" and the bossa nova spiced \"See All Her Faces.\" This is worth hearing if you like Springfield a lot; just dont gear up for an extraordinarily consistent or essential listen.

There are notable omissions, such as \"Son of a Preacher Man\" or anything from Dusty in Memphis, but that does not belong to the Universal Recording group that released this album -- consequently, this only concentrates on Phillips-era recordings, and its a pretty good snapshot of that time which, after all, gave Dusty her very biggest hits.

Dusty : Allmusic album Review : As part of a Universal Earbook series that was launched in 2006, Dusty Springfields 2000 box set Simply Dusty was reissued in a new format. It still contained the four CDs and 98 tracks of the original set, but this time it was packaged within a nearly LP-sized hardback coffee table book. If you have the original box, its certainly an indulgence, as youre basically paying quite a bit (about $100) for larger-sized artwork and more durable, handsome packaging; even if you dont have the original box, its a bit of an indulgence, considering how high the price is. Viewed simply for its music and visual appeal, however, its quite good (and one of the better of the first batch of titles in the Earbook line), the many photos and illustrations of record sleeves benefiting from having been blown-up to a much larger size. The music is for the most part quite good as well, containing all the familiar hits and many high-quality LP tracks, B-sides, and unissued-at-the-time items that -- though theyre mostly available elsewhere (a 1966 BBC cover of the folk standard \"Poor Wayfaring Stranger\" being a notable exception) -- are quite satisfying and not all that easy to track down in other formats. \"For the most part\" is a crucial qualifier here: the decline in the quality of the material is sharp in the last half of the set, becoming especially precipitous on disc four, though that CD does include her 1987 comeback hit with the Pet Shop Boys, \"What Have I Done to Deserve This?\" To be harsh, if the sets intention was to be a survey of Springfields most significant work, you could cut most of disc four out with barely any loss at all, its primary purpose being to make the anthology a career-spanning one rather than a selective best-of. Still, for the serious Dusty fan, this makes for a nice display on the mantle piece (in addition to containing much classic music), with detailed track-by-track notes included in the book.

Whether through an act of sneaky subversion or not, Dusty Springfields entry in the series is quite the worthwhile exception. It focuses almost wholly on rarities that will be an appreciated supplement to the library of even the dedicated Springfield collector. All of the tracks date from 1967-71, and only two of them -- the hits \"Son-of-a Preacher Man\" and \"The Look of Love\" -- could be considered familiar and easily obtainable. The rest are an assortment of songs that were not released in the U.S. at that time, whether they appeared only on U.K. albums or singles, or on the now hard-to-find The Legend of Dusty Springfield box set. Over half of the 16 tracks were previously unissued in the U.S., and three songs from her early 1970 sessions with Gamble-Huff appear here for the first time anywhere. Most important of all, the music is worthwhile, and pretty much up to the standard of her better material from the late 1960s and early 1970s, widely available or otherwise. Its pretty diverse as well, taking in quality soul covers (Barbara Acklins \"Am I the Same Girl\"), Gamble-Huff originals (from the discarded 1970 sessions), lush orchestrated pop (\"The Colour of Your Eyes\"), cool jazz (David Frishbergs \"Sweet Lover No More\"), pop (\"Spooky\"), and even bossa nova (Antonio Carlos Jobims \"Meditation\") and pop-folk (\"Morning Please Dont Come,\" a 1970 single with her brother Tom Springfield).

After she signed to Dunhill in 1972, Springfield relocated to California to cut the material, and, appropriately these are Californian productions of their time, filled with studio pros (Larry Carlton, Hal Blaine, Bernard Purdie, Joe Venuto), a warm lush production, and soft rock, written by such songwriters as Alan ODay, David Gattes, Melissa Manchester, and Ashford and Simpson. In other words, this is not the Dusty of Dusty in Memphis and A Brand New Me, although a cover of Van Morrisons \"Tupelo Honey\" has an appropriate Southern flair and Ashford & Simpsons \"I Just Wanna Be There\" is smoothly seductive. All this means that some fans will not warm to this and, admittedly, some of the music is a little slight, but it works on two different levels. First, its simply a good pop artifact, evoking its era with high-class performances and classy productions, appealing to the kind of listener that finds \"Learn to Say Goodbye\"s status as the theme from the ABC Movie of the Week Say Goodbye, Maggie Cole to be a virtue. More importantly, this finds Springfield exploring more adventurous material, particularly on Longing, where she tackles Janis Ians \"In the Winter\" and Margie Adams lesbian love song, \"Beautiful Soul.\" Therefore, this compilation winds up being as a historical exercise, both for Springfield diehards and early-70s fanatics, but itll please both camps equally, since theyll both find its flaws somewhat charming.

Opening with Dusty Springfields cover of the Supremes \"When the Love Light Starts Shining Thru His Eyes,\" the songs cross several decades of releases, though stick principally to the 1960s and early 70s, when Springfield was in top voice. The result might just as easily be called \"the best of the best\" of Dusty Springfield, with state-of-the-art sound as well, using the best masters as they existed circa 2003; and if the annotation is minimal, this is music that can easily speak for itself, and loudly -- her rendition of \"Mr. Dream Merchant\" is worth the price of admission by itself, for those who havent heard it. Oh, and this is one European release that wont be showing up in the U.S. as a domestic release, owing to the split in ownership of Springfields masters in the U.S. after 1969.

Its not a conventional best-of, although it has most of Dusty Springfields hits; its not a rarities compilation, although it has a good number of rare or at least obscure cuts. Instead, its neither one nor the other. All but the most affluent and forgiving of Springfield fans are not apt to be pleased at the prospect of shelling out for a few peripheral rarities they may not have, surrounded by quite a bit of stuff they likely already have several times over. And really, the rarities arent all that mind-blowing, consisting primarily of some previously unissued remixes; the stereo soundtrack version of \"The Sweet Ride\"; the mono version of \"Nothing,\" which has an alternate vocal; the \"first-time mono release\" of \"Standing in the Need of Love\"; the full-length version of \"Heartbeat,\" previously issued in the U.K. only in edited form; a mono version of \"If Wishes Could Be Kisses,\" again with an alternate vocal; \"I Just Dont Know What to Do with Myself\" with a different vocal; and a mono mix of \"I Cant Wait Until I See My Babys Face\" with additional background vocals. All this noted, the Dusty Springfield fan who wants the hits plus some stuff thats relatively unfamiliar will like this, though American listeners will miss \"Wishin and Hopin,\" presumably not included on this U.K. release because it was not a hit in Britain, though it was a big 1964 smash in the States. Besides most of the hits, there are a lot of good to great LP cuts and B-sides, mostly though not exclusively from the 1960s and early 70s. Some of the off the beaten track items, like \"Summer Is Over,\" are among the finer things she did; others, like her cover of Gloria Jones soul stormer \"Heartbeat\" and the theme for the film The Corrupt Ones, manage to be obscure, good, and unusual all at once. Its well sequenced and covers most of the important bases of her style, though its not quite something that can be recommended as the first or second Dusty Springfield release that belongs in your collection."
