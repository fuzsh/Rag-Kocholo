The comic featured strip cartoons with stories about the TV favourites of the day, including Muffin the Mule and Larry the Lamb as well as Mr Pastry. Printed in full colour, the cartoon is entitled \"Mr Pastry's Sportsday by Richard Hearne\" with the words: \"TV Mini-Book No. 4\" and a price of 6D. The illustrations are by TV Comic regular Lunt Roberts, a contributor to Punch and the Daily Mail, best known for his illustrations of Richmal Compton's Just William books.\n\nThe cartoon tells of the day Mr Pastry and his friends Mr Timblethwaite and Mortimer decided to do something to \"help British sport\". Mr Pastry has invented a machine called 'The Pastry Self Starter' which he persuades Mr Timblethwaite to try, but unfortunately he is catapulted through the air and gets stuck on top of a church spire.\n\nNext Mr Pastry ties a rope to an old kettle for throwing the hammer, but he ends up with the rope wrapped tightly around his throat! Mr Timblethwaite wraps the rope around all three of them. Mortimer then tries, and sends the kettle into the air, knocking an unsuspecting PC Catchem to the floor. Mr Pastry and his friends now run a race - with the policeman in pursuit! They run into Farmer Hayseed's field where prize bull Billy gives chase. Now PC Catchem is running away too and they all leap a high hedge together, landing in a river, swiftly followed by the bull! Finally, the bull is led back to his field, and the three receive a telling off from the law!\n\nCelebrity Crazy Cricket - 10 minutes\n\nShort film of a 1950s celebrity cricket match played by stars of the day.
