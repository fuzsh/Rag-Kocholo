        "text": "Hammer horror fans are familiar with the aptly-named supporting actor Michael Ripper, who has died aged 87, one of the stalwarts of that most commercially successful of all British film companies. In fact, he appeared - rather than featured or starred - in more Hammer pictures than any other performer.\n\nShort and stocky, with a big head and bulging eyes, Ripper was often the victim of Draculas, mummies, Frankenstein monsters and werewolves. In The Mummy's Shroud (1967), he was dropped from a window by the mummy, while in The Curse Of The Werewolf (1961), as a drunk, he was thrown into the same prison cell as the powerfully snarling werewolf (Oliver Reed).\n\nIn the early 1950s, Ripper, once a heavy smoker, developed a thyroid condition for which he had to have an operation. \"When I came out of it, I could only talk in a whisper,\" he recalled. \"It got a little better, of course, but I didn't really sound like a human being - so all I could do was horror.\"\n\nApart from the period Hammer movies, he popped up in a plethora of British pictures, as all sorts of servants, pub landlords, petty crooks and coppers. Mainly, however, his blunt looks, cast him as a low-ranking army officer, notably as the nervous soldier guarding the pulsating radioactive blob in X The Unknown (1956), and the sergeant in Quatermass II (1957), one of three feature film spin-offs from the Nigel Kneale BBC television series, Quatermass, in which Ripper was a regular.\n\nRipper was born in Portsmouth, where his father worked in the Admiralty. By the age of 14, he had already decided to leave school and become an actor. His understanding parents allowed him to study at the Central School of Speech and Drama, from which he graduated at 16 and joined Folkestone rep.\n\nWhile working in the theatre, Ripper made his screen debut in a \"quota quickie\" called Twice Branded (1935), starring James Mason in his second film. Shortly before the war, after a dozen or more of such justifiably forgotten films, many of them directed by P Maclean Rogers, he was invited to the Gate theatre, Dublin, where Rogers had become a producer. It was there that the 27-year-old played Hamlet. After the war, he returned to England, where he appeared regularly in films, especially those by the producer-director team of Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat.\n\nAmong them was The Story Of Gilbert And Sullivan (1953), in which Ripper played Sullivan's manservant, and Albert, the cheeky stable lad, in The Belles Of St Trinians (1954).\n\nIn Laurence Olivier's Richard III (1955), Ripper was Forrest, the second murderer, who stuffs the corpse of the Duke of Clarence (John Gielgud) in a barrel of malmsey, and one of the \"bloody dogs\" who kills the young princes in the Tower of London. A few years later, in The Anatomist (1961), he was the grave-robbing Hare, supplying corpses to Dr Alastair Sim. Among his other films of the 60s was The Secret Of Blood Island, as an evil Japanese soldier, The Reptile, The Plague Of The Zombies, and Dracula Has Risen From The Grave.\n\nOn television, Ripper impressed as the patient chauffeur-confidante of married Wendy Craig's admirer in Butterflies (1978) and, more recently, he was the seen-it-all porter of the Drones club in the Jeeves and Wooster series. One of his last roles was as oldtimer Tony Bonaparte, in No Surrender (1985), an effective parable of the Northern Ireland conflict.\n\nRipper is survived by his third wife and a daughter by his first marriage."
