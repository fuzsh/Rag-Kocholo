Read through the list and then let us know how many of them you’ve seen!\n\nJoseph Smith: The Prophet of the Restoration\n\nThis hour-long film, released in 2005, depicts the life and legacy of Joseph Smith.

Monson\n\nThis video biography of President Thomas S. Monson’s life highlights some of his great memories and experiences. Included in this video are interviews with President Monson, family members, and friends. Available to watch on the Church’s website.\n\nMan’s Search for Happiness\n\nThis movie debuted at the 1964 New York World’s Fair to a viewership of over five million. The production has since been updated twice. Available to watch on the Church’s website.\n\nMr. Kruger’s Christmas\n\nMr. Kruger’s Christmas was produced in 1980 by Bonneville Communications, a Church entity. The film featured Hollywood leading man Jimmy Stewart. According to movie producer Michael McLean, Stewart, a Presbyterian, agreed to the role and fulfilled a lifelong dream of his by conducting the Tabernacle Choir as part of the film.\n\nJohnny Lingo\n\nJohnny Lingo premiered in 1969. The short film was produced by the BYU Motion Picture Department and was based on a Woman’s Day magazine article called “Johnny Lingo’s Eight Cow Wife” by Patricia McGerr, a Catholic. Only two professional actors were brought in, Francis Urry to play Trader Harris, and Blaizdell MaKee for the title role of Johnny. Everyone else was played by locals in Hawaii where the film was shot. Mohana was played by BYU-Hawaii student Naomi Kahoilua. You can watch it now on Deseret Video+.\n\nThe Mountain of the Lord\n\nThis 75-minute film produced to commemorate the centennial of the Salt Lake Temple, which was dedicated April 6, 1893. The film aired between sessions of general conference on Saturday, April 3, 1993. Available to watch on Deseret Video+.\n\nLegacy\n\nAlso released in 1993, Legacy tells the epic pioneer history of the Church. Kieth Merrill, Legacy’s writer and director, said, “Legacy gives us the emotional dimension of Church history. Our goal was to capture the spirit of sacrifice, the spirit of faith, and the spirit of the people and make them real. Through Legacy we can be totally swept away in time and space as we meet early members of the Church—trek with them across the prairies, cry with them as they bury their dead, and rejoice with them as they marry and have children. These were real people who lived and breathed, who worried and cried, and who loved and laughed.”\n\nThe Testaments: Of One Fold and One Shepherd\n\nReleased in 2000, this film depicts events from the life and ministry of Jesus Christ as recorded in the New Testament and the Book of Mormon. The story culminates with a portrayal of the resurrected Savior's visit to the ancient Americas as seen through the eyes of a fictional family. It lasts approximately 65 minutes. The DVD is available at Deseret Book.\n\nMeet the Mormons\n\nMeet the Mormons, released in 2014, is the first movie in Church history to have a theatrical release. And it was created without a formal script, according to director Blair Treu.\n\n“We wanted to tell our own stories, to get to know families from the rank and file of the Church and observe the impact of the gospel in their lives,” Treu told Newsroom at the time of the movie’s release. “We created free-flowing stories, keeping it authentic, to show who we are as a result of living our beliefs.”\n\nTreu also said the movie was historic in the history of Church filmmaking: “It’s monumental! It’s a whole new direction we never thought would happen, and here it is.”\n\nThe full movie is available on YouTube.\n\n17 Miracles\n\nAs part of the Willie Handcart Company, Levi Savage (played by Jasen Wade) feared that leaving late in the season would lead to despair and death. What he came to find out is that for every tragedy, there is a multitude of miracles. Based on unbelievable actual events, 17 Miracles will open your eyes to the stories of the Mormon Pioneers as you have never seen them before.

The DVD is available at Deseret Book.\n\nThe Cokeville Miracle\n\nOn May 16, 1986, in the small ranching community of Cokeville, Wyoming, David and Doris Young took an elementary school hostage for several hours before detonating a bomb inside a classroom that held every teacher and student in the school. In the wake of the madness, Ron Hartley, whose children were inside the classroom, must fight his skepticism and unbelief as he hears eyewitness accounts from the students about miraculous, heavenly intervention during the crisis. The DVD is available at Deseret Book.\n\nThe Saratov Approach\n\nThe Saratov Approach is the extraordinary, untold story of Elders Travis Tuttle and Andrew Propst and their week-long abduction in Saratov, Russia. On what seemed like any other day during their two-year missions, Elders Tuttle and Propst are approached by Nikolai to meet a friend. But then the missionaries experience the unimaginable—kidnapped, beaten, and held for ransom for nearly a week—on the other side of the world in Saratov, Russia. While their family, friends and the world pray for their safe return, Tuttle and Propst are tested physically, emotionally and—most of all—spiritually. Available on Deseret Video+.\n\nThe Best Two Years\n\nElder Rogers has only a couple of months to go on his mission, but his testimony and zeal for missionary work has suffered from hardships he experienced in letters from home. He is now only serving out his time with as little effort as possible when he is given a “greenie” from Oklahoma as a junior companion. Elder Calhoun has the enthusiasm, innocence, and naiveté of a new missionary. We follow the elders from the day of Elder Calhoun’s arrival to the day of Elder Rogers’ departure. The movie is humorous, but also heartfelt as we witness Elder Rogers rediscover his testimony through the simple but unshakable faith of Elder Calhoun. The DVD is available at Deseret Book.\n\nThe Errand of Angels\n\nSet in the scenic mountains of Austria, The Errand of Angels is the story of Sister Rachel Taylor, an enthusiastic new missionary who faces the challenges of struggling to learn a different language, eat foreign cuisine, and find common ground with a difficult companion.
