        "text": "I’ve enjoyed these recent weeks. That’s not to say I haven’t enjoyed all the weeks of my life so far, and that’s 3,848 of them thus far, just that recovering ability after some form of disability will always make you feel happier than before. When COVID hit I started to film myself for several weeks, staging my scenes, splitting off phases of work, moving cameras around to make things happen logically and then cycling a couple of miles to deliver them to Natalie to edit the results. It’s what you do in business when you are self-employed and want to keep your work flowing and your business going. Thankfully, we were able to regroup after not too long, still a few weeks though. My broken ribs resulting from mindless violence was quite a different thing. For a few weeks, it was the unknown unsettledness that impacted me. Any violating of another no matter how it’s done is to disorient them intentionally in an attempt to cause a loss of direction. I think of these periodic life-encounters occur for different reasons and I consider them to be periodic shunts and shoves in life in all of its elements to separate the new abnormal and reestablish normality so as not to lose too much of the ground we up until that point stood firm and strong on. In my world, it put a temporary halt on all that I aimed for for over two and more decades. Of course, I did lose ground in several ways, not knowing whether I would or could regain what was lost was one thing but hoping for a full recovery and restoration of my former happiness and more importantly than that my contentedness and the impetus good health empowers you with to work. These last few weeks I have felt those elements I lost or saw slow down gently returning.\n\nBut we learn what we may not have known before. I feel more aware than ever that craft and handwork, more specifically manual work if you will, and all that that entails is more critical to our life enjoyment than ever. Returning to physical work after a prolonged and forced stop is definitely undervalued generally but the powerful ‘drug’ of working and then working with your own hands is a most comlete therapy in and of itself. The single most important ingredient in my life at various points where illnesses have stopped me has been the promise of working again. And yet talking to most people about ‘going back‘ to work on a Monday after a weekend off and I will always be met with a very negative comment. This morning I quite simply ‘looked forward’ (What a strange term that is) to arriving at work. I looked forward to writing, to drawing, to flipping the wood I bought yesterday, to sharpening my planes and the workout of planing my wood using hand planes. I know that my work as a hand tool woodworker means I will physically work ten times harder (and smarter) than a machinist who will spend most of the time waiting to catch the wood on the outfeed while the saw and planer does all the physical work. Most people would consider this the more advanced way. That’s the exact opposite to me who cannot wait to get to working at the bench and getting my materials ready for the project.\n\nMost people think being self-employed at least gives you a goodly level of freedom to do something called “be your own boss” or “work for yourself.” In my world of making it has always meant working twice as many hours in a given work week and then too working for a dozen or more ‘others‘ than a single boss-person. Truth is a percentage of those boss people will think that they are buying you lock stock and barrel and will often therefore tend be unreasonable, argumentative and indeed just plain awkward. Eventually, though, you can read the signs and pick and choose for reasonableness. You will read those you might work for according to their volunteering into a partnership of cooperation––a collaborative endeavour that disfavours the old way of buying labour in an employee to make for you as in the entitled of the past paying and even bargaining a pittance for an artisan to do fine work at minimal cost.\n\nOver the recent weeks, I have spoken about the progress regarding my personal healing after an aggressive attack on me. We refer to brain chemistry like dopamine more frequently than in times past, referring to it as the ‘feel-good‘ chemistry and whereas these days it’s a common enough term, these word would seldom if ever be used as part of our common language. Apparently, we receive a flooding release of dopamine into and through our brains when we achieve something that’s particularly important to us. This unseen but felt something rewards our efforts in whatever sphere the stimulation comes. When I’m actively involved making I notice that different phases have a very positive affect on me. The first comes with the initial idea for a project. This will be a concept of creativity that I thought up or adopted/adapted from another source that then promped an action to record that start-point be it a search in a book or on the internet, a drawing made as black lines on the white of a page or the lifting of the first tool or the wood we to start making with or from. The next phase is the excitement that produces energy as the energising power of making. This excitement-inducing energy flexes the muscle we need to work with and then the muscle of the brain to expand the idea in an unfolding way within the pace we can measure ourselves out into. Sustainability is as important to any maker as any runner or athlete. For this we need work stamina, our ability to keep going when things get harder and the distance of completion seems too hard. We all know the significance of reaching the halfway point and seeing the distance ahead shortening. This too releases chemistry to us in the sense of the critical anticipation we feel for an end result coming into sight. By now we are beginning to feel the impulse from our achieving results. The quality of achievement should be recognised and not just passed over. Compare it to a diet when the goal was better health, loss of weight and such. On the first day, there is nothing to be seen. In or around 1984/5 my specialist consultant in the hospital (I was hospitalised because of severe internal bleeding in my gut) spoke to me in my hospital bed and told me the disease I had was incurable and I possibly had eighteen months before he would remove my colon. I changed my diet and felt no better…persevered and a week later I went from being bedridden to walking steadily. Six months past I was a new man. It took two weeks for the effect of my new diet to start to kick in. Fruit and veg did the trick for me but cutting meat and dairy magnified the endeavour a hundredfold. The phases I speak of here were working for me back in the 1980s. At each point, after some endeavour, I found myself building on the successes. That is how the chemistry of work works."
