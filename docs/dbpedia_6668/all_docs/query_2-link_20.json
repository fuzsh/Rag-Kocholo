The Roosevelts, renowned for their political activism and their role in trust-busting (which significantly impacted the Whitney family's wealth), stand in stark contrast to the reserved Whitneys, who are determined to avoid scandal of any kind.\n\nThe story follows Quentin as he navigates the pressures of familial expectations, personal ambition, and the looming shadow of war. Through a mix of historical events and artistic interpretation, the musical delves into themes of heroism, love, and the impact of war on individuals and their families. Quentin weaves together dramatic scenes, emotional soliloquies, and powerful musical numbers to create a moving portrait of a young man caught between personal desire and duty, love and loss, and the enduring question of how to make one's mark in the shadow of a powerful legacy.\n\nDouglas J Cohen\n\nDoug received the 2010 Fred Ebb Award for Musical Theatre Songwriting and won two Richard Rodgers Awards for writing book, music, and lyrics for NO WAY TO TREAT A LADY (produced twice off-Broadway resulting in over 100 productions worldwide; an upcoming NY commercial production in-the-works through producer Larry Hirschhorn) and THE GIG (O’Neill National Music Theatre Conference, Manhattan Theatre Club Stage II, Goodspeed, York Theatre Company concert on CD and reading in conjunction with the Noël Coward Prize, and Sacramento Music Circus).

Everything is a big song and dance when I’m around. That’s one reason children have always responded well to me! I started babysitting at 12, and continued to nanny into my 30s, making strong connections with every family. After graduating Randolph Academy for the Performing Arts, I became a drama, music, and dance teacher, as well as a director for children’s musicals.\n\nI have since honed my skills of teaching music and drama for babies, children, and youth. I founded Dramagination - a very creative acting class for ages 3-12 where kids can follow their instincts, gain confidence, and practice their dramatic techniques. Directing full scale musicals with children became one of my favourite parts of my job, fostering a safe space to learn and perform, and creating lasting memories for everyone involved.\n\nI specialize in developing children’s creativity - where children invent characters, stories, and worlds, and I help them to collaborate and turn their ideas into fully realized productions.\n\nI trained in Toronto, and have since worked in this field in New Brunswick, England, Switzerland and Vancouver. I’m really excited to bring my offerings to York Region and beyond!\n\nGet A Clue\n\nGet a Clue is a horror murder mystery comedy musical that's actually scary but still pretty funny.\n\nLoosely based on the Clue game and movie, a group of teens get locked in the attic of a very creepy old house while a party rages downstairs.

The Finellis Musical In the 1990s, Tony Finelli, an Italian-American from New York was a star in Europe. He found fame starring in ELVIS: The Musical and together with his ever-present manager, Jürgen Drahtseil, turned that initial success into an international singing career. In 1997, at the height of Tony's fame, his manager was approached by an 'Italian concert promoter' regarding a big concert for Tony in Sicily. The 'promoter' revealed himself to be an undercover agent working for the German CIA (Verfassungsschutz) leading a secret sting operation to arrest 'Mr. Big' (Godfather of the Gambaretto Mafia Family) who was under investigation in Berlin for both tax evasion, and money laundering. In over their heads and caught between the Mafia and the German CIA, Tony and Jürgen were faced with the choice of either going to prison for Mr. Big or having both of their families murdered by the mob.\n\nOn the day Tony and Jürgen are released from prison, no one meets them at the gate. Tony returns to his home wanting to rebuild his life. Unbeknownst to Tony, his Russian wife Tina had filed for divorce shortly before his release. The former model and stewardess' reputation had been ruined by the scandal surrounding Tony's arrest. Alone with two children and no income, Tina turned their mansion into a bed and breakfast. Now as the owner of Tony's former home, she lives there with their two daughters, Lola and Lena, now 27 and 20 years old. Tony's parents, Pete and Bea Finelli as well as his ancient, Sicilian grandmother 'Nonna' live in their own apartment upstairs. Four generations of Finellis are living under one roof. Recently, the maintenance man in Tina's boarding house quit. Out of love for his family, Tony Finelli, the proud peacock, swallows his pride and takes over the janitor's job, hoping to rebuild his life, restart his career and reconnect with Tina and his children. Like a clumsy Phoenix trying to rise from the ashes, Tony, the eternal optimist, sets out on a very bumpy journey to reclaim his life, rebuild his career, and win back the love and respect of his family -- and with the help of his one-time nemesis Agent Schmitt, finally rid his life once and for all of Mr. Big.\n\nTony's extraordinary journey from a star, to jailbird, to janitor and back to the top of the entertainment game, is the stuff of legend and the story of The Finellis.\n\nNoel Katz is a composer and lyricist.

We want to put on productions that stretch the imagination, that bring smiles to peoples faces and help to make people walk away with new thoughts and new ideas. We hope to put on new productions in Canada and hope to reimagine shows that have been so important to the makeup of Torontos performance world.\n\nWe are committed to the practice of color-conscious casting. We recognize that considerations of race, including how race and ethnicity shape society and the stories we tell, are vital components to the casting process. Also critical to the casting process are audience perceptions of race on stage and in film. We strive to craft performances in ways that respect, care for, and honor individuals, cultures, and communities of color. Furthermore, we recognize that the practice of white-washing erases culturally and racially specific stories and experiences. White-washing takes away opportunities from people of color and reinforces the dangerous notion of white superiority. Therefore, we reject this practice. In light of this, we seek to be inclusive and color-conscious not only in our casting but also in the material we choose to stage.\n\nManuele Adrian Mizzi\n\nJamaican-Italian tenor, Manuele Adrian Mizzi discovered his love for performing at a very young age.
