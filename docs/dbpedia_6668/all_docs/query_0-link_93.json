        "text": "Category Archives: The Zahl File\n\nBY LOVE POSSESSED — PART TWO\n\nPart two of Paul Zahl's essay on the novel By Love Possessed and its screen adaptation:\n\nA NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET (Part Two)\n\nArthur Winner's “nightmare on Elm Street” begins when a Roman Catholic\n\nlady friend of Marjorie Penrose attempts to convert him to the true\n\nchurch in the setting of a rose garden that bears remorseful memories of his\n\naffair with Marjorie, the wife of his law partner. This Mrs. Pratt\n\ncorners Arthur Winner and very skillfully, and craftily, turns the\n\nconversation in the direction of his past sins, which Marjorie has\n\napparently confessed to her. Just when the Man of Reason thinks he is,\n\nas usual, in quiet control of things, Mrs. Pratt harpoons him. She spears him straight to the heart: “Thou art the man”. Arthur\n\nWinner is only saved from complete humiliation by the appearance, in\n\nthe underbrush, of a snake!\n\nFrom this point on, the humbled hero of By Love Possessed is so fully\n\nde-constructed that he has no choice but to take his famous literary\n\nwalk from the steps of Christ Church (Episcopal), where he has been\n\nushering at the Sunday morning service and where he is to become the\n\nnext Senior Warden, over to the crucial Detweiler House, then past the\n\nCourthouse and the Christ Church again, past his law office, past\n\nthe Union League Club (moribund and soon to close), past the\n\nstorefronts of Main Street and beyond, up the street where the old\n\nfamilies of Brocton used to live, right up to the entrance of the house\n\nin which he was born and where his mother still lives, to make his\n\ngreat and ever remembered (for those who read the book) entrance,\n\ncalling upstairs to his aunt, his mother, and his wife.\n\nThis is Arthur's nightmare, a universal dereliction of disillusionment,\n\nby which he must catch at hope in a new way. I, for one, find the last\n\nfive pages of By Love Possessed satisfying, real, and ennobling. They\n\ntook me by surprise. I think about them every day.\n\nHow does the movie version envisage the emotionally overwhelming finish\n\nof the book? The answer is, not very well. As Cozzens himself\n\nremarked, in his journal entry describing his second viewing of the\n\nmovie in Williamstown, the script writer had collapsed some characters,\n\nand had to diminish the inwardness of the book. So much of this novel\n\nis inner dialogue, inner qualifyings, inner voices of contradiction,\n\nand association; inner asides, both cruel and kind. Thus the\n\ncascading, baroque language of the book is lost in the movie. Of\n\ncourse it is lost. The visual image is not the same as the written\n\nword.\n\nIn its ambitious attempt to put this complicated story in a narrative\n\nwithout flashback, into a linear tale which takes you somewhere, the\n\nmovie fails. I don't see how anyone would really dissent from that\n\njudgment. By Love Possessed The Movie flattens everything out. It\n\nhas only its story to tell, brick by brick, or step by step. No one\n\nhas gotten inside the story and then developed it cinematically, either\n\nthrough the composition or the editing. The building and billowing\n\nmood of the book, and also the philosophy of resignation that the book\n\nembodies: they're not on film.\n\nOnly in two sections, so far as I can see, do the director and crew get\n\nunder the story, to what it is really about — which is the shipwreck\n\nof love that attempts to possess, the forms of love that try to possess\n\nthe loved object. Loving that possesses the lover, and thus is about\n\nthe lover rather than the beloved — whether it be the love of a parent\n\nfor a child, of a husband for a wife, of a high-school girlfriend for\n\nher selfish boyfriend, of an old patrician man for his reputation in\n\nthe town, or, in a case so important to this novel, of a “responsible”\n\nolder sister for her feckless younger brother — possessive love makes\n\ncatastrophes of human relationships. The book is about the victory, in\n\nutter failure, of a man who overcomes the possessiveness of love in\n\norder to, well, live, and then, counter-intuitively, love. That man is\n\nArthur Winner. What Arthur Winner stumbles on, you might say, is the\n\nvictory of resignation, the acquiescence of defeat which results in a\n\nsimple solution of simply taking the next step in good faith.\n\nOnly in two sections of By Love Possessed The Movie is the deeper\n\ninterest of this material expressed visually. There's a lot more\n\nfootage outside of these two sections, but it has an almost indifferent\n\nquality of detachment (the wrong kind), which is not philosophical\n\ndetachment but rather, “I think we'd better film this thing as quickly\n\nas possible, grin and bear it, and get our product into theaters while\n\npeople can still remember reading the book a couple years ago.”\n\nThe one section of the film that catches some fire is the scene of\n\nMarjorie Penrose (Lana Turner) coming on strong to Arthur Winner (Efrem\n\nZimbalist, Jr.) in the Victorian “wedding cake” summer house behind his\n\nhome in Roylan, the little enclave just outside Brocton where the\n\nprofessional families live. This is a memorable scene in the book,\n\npersuasively underlined by thunder and lightning, the last heat of\n\nsummer in the autumn leaves, and the very beautiful garden building in\n\nwhich the conversation takes place. The set dressers here, the sound\n\neffects and music, the roll of the fallen leaves, the effective and\n\ndramatic lighting, and the two performances themselves all come\n\ntogether to evoke the spirit of the book. I guess there is nothing\n\nparticularly cinematic to see, neither in the camera movements nor in\n\nthe editing. But the technicolor style, with that swirling music, kind\n\nof takes your breath away. For five minutes. I imagine James Gould\n\nCozzens was pleased with this scene. The message of the scene( if it\n\ncould be put into words?): A nice and ordered Georgian garden with a\n\ndecorous Victorian summer house, and it's all about to be ruined, by a\n\nlove that possesses its demoniacs.\n\nThe second and for my money the only other sequence in By Love\n\nPossessed The Movie that works, is the opening credits. They are very\n\ngood. Why very good? Because they capture, in just a few expertly\n\nedited exterior shots and one long pan, the emotional, geographical\n\ncontext of the story, this story of one man's struggle to find the\n\nanswer to the question of how and also why it can be possible to live\n\nin the presence of hope. The camera shows two churches around the town\n\nsquare, one Episcopal, one “mainstream” Protestant; the Court House;\n\nthe Union League Club, dying home to the old and increasingly few first\n\nfamilies of Brocton; and a few old and tired 19th Century mansions\n\nstill in use. It feels a little like the main square of Columbus,\n\nOhio, tho' smaller; or the main square of Columbus, Georgia, about the\n\nsame size. Then, at the end of the credits, as “Directed by John\n\nSturges” flickers on, and off, you see Arthur Winner, briskly but not\n\nhurriedly, calmly but not unconcerned, striding, or rather, simply\n\nwalking, across that “Brocton Square”.\n\nThe credits for By Love Possessed The Movie capture the atmosphere the\n\nbook projects. They are the high point of the film.\n\n“Ain't that peculiar? (Peculiar as can be)”: The story is fully\n\ncaptured in “second unit” work, with not a word spoken nor any\n\nexposition offered.\n\nThere is a lot you could say about this. We have a book that is\n\npossibly great — its controversy never diminished its claim, not\n\nself-made, to gravity. By Love Possessed, I repeat, is a grave and\n\nserious book. We also have a movie version that was probably produced\n\nsimply and almost only to capitalize financially on the popular success\n\nof the novel. And so the movie tells its story, the best it can,\n\nhaving to cut the inwardness of the source, the complexity of the plot,\n\nseveral important characters, and certainly the religious concerns of\n\nthe source. (The Episcopal church in Brocton, together with its young\n\n, well educated, and sincere if inexperienced Rector, The Reverend\n\nWhitmore Trowbridge, S. T. D., figures importantly in By Love Possessed;\n\nand Cozzens's depiction of a Sunday service of Morning Prayer is\n\nabsolutely the last word in clinical portraits of what they are\n\nactually like. I know what they are like.) There is nothing\n\ncontroversial in the movie version — no anti-Catholicism, no “Uncle\n\nToms”, no intolerant remarks about New York lawyers from the failing,\n\nunsteady patriarch Noah Tuttle, none of that! Only the references to\n\nsex have been kept, but even there, oddly enough, the better sex is in\n\nthe book and describes a happily married couple making love.\n\nHere I close. Let me confess something. I love this movie! It's not\n\nvery good; it is actually boring; the camera set-ups and pacing are\n\nperfunctory; the actors sleep-walk through their parts, with the\n\nexception of Efrem Zimbalist, Jr., who does convey the vulnerable\n\nactuality of Arthur Winner; and the conclusion is rushed and overly\n\nhappy. (The ending of the book is hopeful, but not happy.) Yet I love\n\nthis movie.\n\nWhy? Because it connects in visual form with some of the constructions\n\nmy imagination had made on the basis of the words. The town, the lead\n\ncharacter, the meeting by night in the summer house, the gushing,\n\noceanic music — these are there, right up in front of you.\n\nIf Orson Welles had made this, it would have been a completely\n\ndifferent result. It would not have been the book at all. Or it would\n\nhave really been the book. If John Ford had made it . . . well, John Ford never would have made it.\n\nAs it is, we have John Sturges's big but little piece of work. Although\n\nI will probably keep the novel with me until the day I die, and though\n\nI make no claims for the turgid tired movie it spun off, I will probably still keep the movie under my pillow, for the next six months.\n\nPROMISES, PROMISES\n\nMy friends Mary and Paul Zahl made a lightning raid on New York City recently (from Florida!) to see the Broadway revival of Promises, Promises. Here is Paul's report on the show:\n\nLITTLE NOT BIG, THEREFORE BIG\n\nI think critics make a mistake when they bring ideology to a production\n\nof the theater. In the case of the new revival of the 1968 musical Promises, Promises\n\nby Burt Bacharach and Hal David, with book by Neil Simon, a lot of\n\nideology has flowed out on paper. A lot of energy has flown, for\n\nexample to the performance of Sean Hayes, the lead actor, and whether\n\na gay actor can portray a non-gay hero.\n\nEnergy has also flown to the attitudes, within the story, concerning\n\nrelationships in the work place between men and women, attitudes that\n\nare supposedly typical of the 1950s and early 1960s and no longer of\n\ntoday. (The musical was written and first performed in 1968, although\n\nit is closely based on Billy Wilder's 1960 film The Apartment, which he co-wrote with I. A. L. Diamond.)\n\nAs I say, a lot of present-day ideology has become involved in the\n\ncritical reception of this Broadway revival of Promises, Promises. No\n\nmatter that, however, Variety reports that Promises, Promises is a\n\ncommercial success. The weeknight performance my wife Mary and I\n\nrecently attended was sold out, not one empty seat; and the audience\n\nwas overwhelmingly appreciative, interrupting the show frequently and\n\noffering the cast a long standing ovation at the end.\n\nFor myself, Promises, Promises is a little story, about a “little guy”\n\nwho wins the girl — because he really loves her and doesn't use her —\n\nand therefore a big story. In drama, so goes my notion, when a\n\npersonal story is well and compassionately told, that story becomes a\n\nbig story. On the other hand, attempting to weight a personal story\n\nwith ideology, especially pre-conceived ideology, diminishes the\n\nattempt.\n\nPromises, Promises narrates the disillusionment of a “little guy” at\n\nConsolidated Life, whose crush on a “little” fellow employee turns out\n\nto be a crush on the mistress of his married boss. C. C. Baxter's sweet\n\nand selfless crush on his “angel in the centerfold” ( reluctant\n\nmistress to the unscrupulous Mr. Sheldrake) is crushed in the first\n\nact, and on Christmas Eve! However, when Miss Kubelik tries to commit\n\nsuicide out of her own disillusionment with Sheldrake — after a sorry\n\ntryst in C. C.'s apartment — things both fall apart and come together.\n\nBaxter shows real love for his true love, who seems hopelessly and all\n\nthe time in love with another man. With the merciful intervention of a\n\nkind and honest doctor who lives next door, together with C. C.'s urgent\n\nrising to the occasion of her overdose, Miss Kubelik rises from the\n\ndead, or the near dead.\n\nThis love from a real and kind man, C. C.\n\nBaxter, as compared with the cynicism and selfishness of boss\n\nSheldrake, touches her, and finally wins her heart. The curtain “clinch” is credible, unsentimental, and very, very touching. It is\n\nmade even more credible by the reprise, this time with a positive\n\nvibe, of Bacharach and David's famous song “I'll Never Fall in Love\n\nAgain”.\n\nWhy does the audience cry at the end? Why was the applause sustained\n\nand very loud? Why did the people leave moved, and happy? I think\n\nit's because the love of C. C. Baxter and Fran Kubelik is a universal\n\nstory enacted within a particular case. C. C. wins Fran. He saves her\n\nlife, both physically and emotionally; and at the very moment when her\n\nlong, passionate, hopeless affair with Sheldrake is exposed — at the\n\nvery moment! This is a little story about little people. It is\n\ntherefore big. Why? Because it's about everybody. Everybody knows\n\nabout the little guy. Almost everybody, male and female, is now or has\n\nat some point been the little guy. It comes with being born.\n\nThere are a lot of theatrical touches to Promises, Promises that are\n\nworthy of comment. The notorious Christmas Party song entitled “Turkey\n\nLurkey Time” is a number people seem either to hate or love. Mary and\n\nI happen to love it. I think we could say we LOVE it. “Turkey\n\nLurkey Time” is just so unusual. Is it about men being turkeys? Mary\n\nthinks so. Is it about the Christmas turkey, soon to lose his head?\n\nWell, yes. Is it a song about the sheer euphoria of Christmas revelry\n\nand drunkenness? Yes, too. Is it a smashing production number with\n\ngreat ensemble dancing and an unpredictable finish? Yes, that, too.\n\nAnyway, “Turkey Lurkey Time” has to be seen and heard to be believed;\n\nand I, for one, am still singing it. (I made a mistake in the lobby at\n\nthe end, as we were leaving the theater. I was too cheap to buy the T-shirt of “Turkey Lurkey Time”, with snowflakes against a brown\n\nbackground. Heaven: and I missed it.)\n\nThen there is the unexpected moment of compassion for the “villain”,\n\nJ. D. Sheldrake. He sings a song entitled “Wanting Things”, about his\n\ncompulsion for wanting things he cannot have. The subject of the song\n\nis what theology calls “concupiscence”. As he tolls his confession,\n\nshadows of the several women in his life, all in scarlet but\n\nhalf-hidden by the lighting, approach him, then slowly walk away, and\n\nvanish. The number is haunting, and also even-handed. No person is\n\ncompletely a villain.\n\nThe producers of Promises, Promises have added two songs from the\n\nBacharach-David repertoire to their revival of the show. One of them,\n\n“A House Is Not a Home”, has to be one of the great American pop\n\nsongs. Both lead characters, Fran and Chuck (C. C.), sing it in\n\nseparate contexts, at different points in the narrative. It is almost\n\nunbearably affecting. The actress Katie Finneran (above) also has a star turn\n\nas Marge MacDougall, the woman Chuck picks up in a bar on Christmas\n\nEve just after he has learned the truth about Fran's affair with\n\nSheldrake. Critics of the show who panned it otherwise, mostly for\n\nideological reasons of one kind or another — you can adore Mad Men\n\nbut you can't say a good word about Promises, Promises — loved Katie\n\nFinneran's extraordinary scene. You have to agree with the critics\n\nabout the scene, and the actress. But it's also true that Sean Hayes,\n\nthe lead, reveals a comic brilliance and timing as C. C. Baxter; and\n\nKristin Chenoweth has a lovely voice and compelling stage presence.\n\n(To me the actress seems a little petite for the role, given the\n\nslightly tough persona she is supposed to have.)\n\nTwo other things to mention:\n\nThe character of Dr. Dreyfuss is played by Dick Latessa (above, with Chenoweth and Hayes), who puts this\n\nrole on the map. Dr. Dreyfuss is the physician/wise man/priest of the\n\nplay and even invokes God, sincerely, in a moment of crisis. Also, the\n\nnumber, “Where Can You Take a Girl?”, which is reprised twice by an\n\nenthusiastic quartet of young executives, is comic and even slapstick.\n\nWe would wish to believe that the kind of thinking expressed in the\n\nsong doesn't take place any more. But it does, whatever one's moral\n\njudgments are. It's just that today the targets are not “secretaries” but “part-time staffers”, or “interns”, or “campaign workers”, of both\n\nsexes. “Where Can You Take a Girl?” is a spoof. Everyone in the\n\naudience laughed, even if they didn't quite want to.\n\nVisually, the play is saturated in early '60s office decor. (Think\n\nkidney-shaped ash trays.) The art direction reminded me of Frank\n\nTashlin's 1957 Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?. But the props don't overwhelm the story and the music. The\n\nchoreography is terrific. The dancers and their costumes look right to\n\nthe period, and they're not small bodies. Yet there are also not too\n\nmany of them. The high points of the dancing occur at the very\n\nbeginning of the play and during “Turkey Lurkey Time”. (As far as I am\n\nconcerned, you could almost rename the show “Turkey Lurkey Time”, that\n\nsong is so eccentric and memorable.)\n\nMary and I had a blast. It's rare you do something on an impulse —\n\nlike getting on a plane within a few hours of deciding to go, with the\n\nsole purpose of seeing one show you hope you're going to like — and it\n\nworks. Promises, Promises works. It works on almost every level. If\n\nyou are going to take offense — at anything — on purely ideological\n\ngrounds, I guess you could infer something you didn't like. That may\n\nbe true of almost any piece of popular art. But I think it would be\n\ndoing an injustice, here, to the combined talents of Billy Wilder and\n\nI.A.L. Diamond, of Burt Bacharach and Hal David, of Sean Hayes and\n\nKristin Chenoweth, Dick Latessa and Katie Finneran; and of Neil Simon.\n\nTogether they bring together a story of a little yearning man and a\n\nlittle beat-down woman (Kerouac's understanding of a “beat-ness”),\n\nwhose love affair becomes a big story.\n\nJOAN-GIRL\n\nVISIONS OF THE JOAN-GIRL\n\nby Paul Zahl\n\nOn January 9th, 1951 Jack Kerouac had a vision in St. Patrick's\n\nCathedral on Fifth Avenue in New York City. He wrote the vision down that night and sent it to Neal Cassady. It was published in 1995 in the Selected Letters 1940 – 1956, edited by\n\nAnn Charters, and is found on pages 281-293.\n\nThe letter hit me with a wallop, because it contradicts the reputation\n\nKerouac has earned for misogyny. The letter is a religious vision concerning women, and also men, which\n\nembodies a catharsis of feeling and rue, on the part of the visionary, for the feelings of contempt that\n\ngoverned most of Kerouac's treatments of women in his work.\n\nIt is made even more worthy of attention by the fact that four months\n\nlater, in a letter dated May 22nd,\n\nKerouac told Cassady to “pay no attention” to what he had written about\n\nwomen in January. He “regressed”, in other words. And he never quite came back to this universal chord.\n\nIn New Testament scholarship — to make an abrupt cross-reference — such textual “taking back” of an earlier testimony suggests the\n\nauthenticity of the original statement. In other words, if St. James\n\nin the New Testament writes that he has concerns about some of the\n\nteachings he finds in the letters of St. Paul, this tells the modern\n\nscholar that the “odd” assertions from St. Paul concerning grace and\n\nlaw really did issue from the man himself. St. James wouldn't\n\ncriticize St. Paul, that is, unless there had really been something\n\nthere for him to criticize. Similarly, if Jesus enunciates something\n\nvery radical, such as “My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?”\n\nwithin the context of a work that wants to make him All-Glowing and\n\nTom-Terrific, then the fact that this saying of Jesus has not been\n\ndeleted means that it was so strong in the memory of witnesses that\n\nlater interpreters could not have cut it if they tried.\n\nSimilarly, Kerouac on January 9th, 1951 experienced something very\n\nreal, for him. The fact that he becomes uncomfortable with it in on\n\nMay 22nd strengthens its veracity as a real dream, a real “touching of\n\nthe foundations of his soul” (his words).\n\nThis letter, which is quite sublime in its writing in my opinion, is\n\nworth quoting at length. I will do so with some interstitial personal commentary. A short summing-up, of this loaded,\n\nsurprising material from the “Beat” pioneer, will follow. There are two further things to mention, before you read Kerouac's\n\nletter.\n\nIt is a vision, his letter. It bursts over and upon him, and he is not\n\nexpecting it. It is completely accidental, in fact, since he ducked\n\ninto St. Patrick's only to find a place to take shelter from the\n\nbusy-ness of Midtown. He did not know he would get caught up in a\n\nreligious service, or novena. The letter recounts his vision, linked to\n\na statue he sees and studies and thinks about. It is a vision which\n\nobserves; and in observing one particular woman, seated in a pew in\n\nfront of him, he begins to think about his wife, and then about his\n\nview of women in general, and finally, about men, in general.\n\nSecondly, Kerouac's letter is emotional. Everything begins to happen\n\nwhen he starts to cry. He is not able to explain his tears. Yet he\n\nmoves thereby beyond the “aesthetic” (his word) to the sub-rational.\n\nThat's when the “work” of the vision takes place. This is to say that\n\nthe “aesthetic” carries him to the “emotional”, and it is an awesome\n\nthing.\n\nNow, dear Reader, if you are willing and ready, Behold:\n\nTO NEAL CASSADY\n\nJan. 9, 1951\n\n(Richmond Hill, N.Y.)\n\nDear Neal,\n\nTo continue. A new experience has touched the foundation of my soul since I wrote you the last words last night . . .\n\nKerouac sets the scene:\n\nI came into the Cathedral not only to get out of the bitter cold, but because, moments before, I had stood in Grand Central Station looking around with a futile sorrow for a place to sit and think. All there was — marble floor, rushing crowds, dime lockers, bleak seatless spaces and bright vast corners. What a thing men have let themselves in for, in this New York!\n\nI hurried out in the cold and cut up 5th Avenue, past the (yes) Yale Club and past Harcourt Brace (yes) and swore and cursed; and cut right by the Doubleday Book store without deigning to go in and see if they had my book [i.e., his first published novel, The Town and the City] on\n\ndisplay . . .\n\nAs you know, St. Patrick's is a Gothic cathedral, copied after Rheims or Chartres or whichever, with a rectory in the back, and a big department store across the street on 50th street. I . . . ducked . . . into the side entrance of the church.\n\nNow our hero must begin to “let go” of his “renegade Catholic” baggage,\n\nand also his heavy personal baggage:\n\nAt first I sneered as all the commonplace “renegade Catholic” thoughts came to me in regimental order but soon I was lost in real sweet contemplation of what was going on . . .\n\nI put away all my worries of where to get a job, how to get to California next month, what to do about my poor wife whom I had been torturing in my subtle way lately, and just merely sat thinking in church . . .\n\nKerouac suddenly invokes Dietrich Buxtehude!\n\n. . . so that you see . . . my first thoughts were superficial, or let's\n\njust say “aesthetic.”\n\nThen something happens:\n\nFrankly, Neal, I don't know when it happened; when it was I began crying . . .\n\nIt is as if the writer's ears now become opened, together with his eyes. He begins to take in what is actually going on around him.\n\nA tall athletic young priest was cutting up to make a sermon; simultaneously I noted how much the crowd had thickened; and before I knew it I was in the middle of a fullblown church service. Since I was in the church utterly given over to pure meditation I obediently kneeled, or stood, or sat at the young priest's behest and followed everyone else in so doing. He made several cryptic remarks evidently having to do with the novena everyone was on, and then began a sermon.\n\nNote that Kerouac has the reaction that many visitors to a church\n\nservice have when the parish “announcements” are being made. He describes them as “cryptic”. And so they are! (I have always tried\n\nto teach young ministers to make as few announcements as possible in\n\nchurch. Announcements disenfranchise visitors and give the impression of the\n\nchurch membership being a kind of club, with “cryptic” sharings. In\n\nmost parishes, however, announcements grow, and Grow, and GROW. For my\n\nmoney, they are a sign of fading vision.)\n\nThe priest now begins to speak. At first Kerouac misunderstands what\n\nis being said.\n\nHe began talking about how “every ambitious woman wants to see her child become successful in industry, in a profession, in some constructive field.” I slapped the side of my head in despair; for by this time my meditations had carried me far from this modern competitive world into thought of a simple and medieval character. I almost sneered. Then I noticed he was starting out this way for greater punch, because then he said, “What were the thoughts of the Virgin Mother on that first Christmas night with regard to her little son? For she knew, only poverty, humiliation and suffering could save him and she knew he was come for strange reasons into the world.”\n\nAnd from there on this fine young priest made a beautiful sermon about the advantages of humility and piety in the invisible world that will surmount the pride and decadence of the visible. I agreed with him. I almost applauded . . .\n\nAt this point Kerouac starts to think about the Virgin Mary. His\n\nattention is caught by a newly dedicated and consecrated statue in the\n\nCathedral, of the Virgin Mary with her dead son — the pieta, in other words.\n\nAnd now I must tell you of the Virgin Mary . . . I was just staring at\n\nwhat I think was a brand new statue of the Virgin Mary holding her Son in her arms after the\n\ncrucifixion . . .\n\nI was amazed to see so many young girls, shopgirls, kneeling around it at the white rail. I couldn't believe my eyes when saw first one, then another, then all of them reach out, touch the statue, touch the red flowers, and bow their heads . . .\n\nKerouac now associates to his wife. He begins to think concretely\n\nabout his most personal relationship, and his role in it. This is where, in my opinion, the letter gets really interesting.\n\nSuddenly I remembered what was wrong between my wife and myself in the past days; she'd said she felt like a “frog” sometimes in the midst of sexual intercourse. I remember it had irritated me . . . Also she never considered herself worth touching when she had a period. Most of all I thought of her — on the impetus of seeing a girl exactly like her [my emphasis] in the pew in front of me — with head bowed, kneeling,\n\na shawl over her . . . humble head, and I almost cried to think of it.\n\nI saw how all of earthly life, with its gutty sufferings, really passes\n\nlike a river through the body of a woman while the man, unknowing of these things and “clean”, just cuts along arrogant. I saw how it is the woman who gives birth, and suffers, and has afterbirths dragged out of her, and navel cords snipped and knotted, and bleeds — while the man boasts of his bloody prowesses . . .\n\nI had even been annoyed at the poor girl lately because she conducted long secret meditations of her own in the bedroom while I “wrote”. “What are you thinking about?” I'd ask slyly. What's going on in her great soul now? I'd ask myself sarcastically. Bah, bah, bah, and all that; as if, and certainly BECAUSE I was a “writer”, she, a mere girl, could not possibly have a soul like mine worthy of hours and of deep contemplation.\n\nKerouac is recognizing the validity of someone other than himself.\n\nIf I had been a little boy of Galilee, and seen the humble women in shawls kneeling at the temple, what would I have thought of Miss Rheingold [i.e., a sexy woman on a billboard advertising beer] . . .? No,\n\nI saw that the girl has a soul . . . For if the burden on earth… could be lifted from one woman, then it may be lifted for another, or to be more precise, the burden is already lifted because the Virgin Mary was [this is a\n\nreference to the Assumption of Our Lady]; just as our sins are expiated by the sacrifice of the great Lord Jesus, without any of us having to be crucified on a cross.\n\nKerouac now sums up what he has seen, in the form of the “Joan-girl” in\n\nfront of him. Joan is the first name of his wife.\n\nNo, the tall, humble Joan-girl in front of me, kneeling with bowed head, was a woman who dearly and sincerely prayed for the deliverance of her soul.\n\nFinally, or almost finally, Kerouac considers “men”, and the vain-glory of the male. He writes through the eyes of child, “a little boy of Galilee”:\n\nI further noticed that there were no young men in the church, only old ones; and I knew they were all out making money or being hoodlums with all their might. If I had been a little boy of Galilee . . . what would I have thought of the go-getter in his Brooks Brothers suit hurling himself through a revolving door with that arrogant scowl? I would have thought he was a scribe, or a pharisee, or a thief. If I had been a little boy of Galilee, and seen the old men praying at the Star, what would I have thought of the be-spatted executive hurrying from a conference. I would have thought he was Caesar. This is our world.\n\nA touching word comes out on prayer:\n\nI wished that the church was not only a sanctuary but a refuge for the poor, the humiliated, and the suffering; and I would gladly join in prayer . . . everybody kneeled: I gladly joined in; no other power on this earth could make me gladly kneel, or even stand up. Did I ever tell you about the time I was in the Navy madhouse and the Admiral of the Fleet came in? — I was the only one who didn't stand up, all the other nuts did . . .\n\nKerouac's letter to Neal Cassady dated January 9th, 1951 concludes with a sort of “coda”, which I find personally touching, and\n\nsatisfying. He changed his behavior toward his wife! It didn't last — as our\n\nmoments of loving inspiration seldom do — but the vision “became flesh”. For a day, at least, it became flesh. Here is how it went:\n\nIn the subway everybody was going home to rest, instead of gathering in the Final Church of Eternal Joy, and I felt bad to see it . . . But when I came home I loved my wife, and kissed her tenderly, as she kissed me . . .\n\nGoodnight, sweet prince.\n\nJack\n\nFrom an historical point of view, a “lit-crit” point of view, this\n\nletter is significant because it documents a temporary change of attitude on\n\nthe part of this American legend toward women.\n\nKerouac's attitude toward women is sometimes summed up in his\n\ntossed-off remark, “Pretty girls make graves”. As a poet immersed later in Buddhism, he was desirous, like\n\nSiddhartha, of avoiding re-birth. “Pretty girls”, therefore, he regarded as the pathway to birth, the\n\nbirth of babies who were metaphysically understood to be reluctant reincarnations of earlier, failed lives. Kerouac's view of birth, therefore of sex, and therefore of women, was not different in principle from George Harrison's in his mid-career\n\nlyric, “Keep me free from birth”.\n\nBut the result in Kerouac's case was an artist's attraction-repulsion\n\nto women that has damaged his critical reception. He is judged harshly for his\n\nsuspicion of one half of . . . earthkind.\n\nHere, however, in this discursive 1951 meditation in church, his thoughts are drawn in a different direction. His observations,\n\nthrough the eye and through the ear, draw him into an association with\n\nthe “Joan-girl” — his own specific wife — and then a judgment on men,\n\nas “scribes, pharisees, and thieves”, which exist in a different zone. I hope that your reading of the letter has offered a kinder, gentler\n\nKerouac.\n\nThere is something else, though.\n\nKerouac's vision that day came to him in connection with tears. Something “got through”, but it was in connection with tears. I wonder sometimes why people cry in church. Happens all the time. People who are “normally” well- and tightly- put together, “lose it”\n\nduring the singing of a hymn, or an illustration in a sermon, or\n\nsomething they see out of the corner of their eye. It's as if you go “out of your mind” for a minute, or “come to your senses”, or are “touched” in a deep uncovered emotional part of you. As I say, this seems to happen all the time.\n\nIt happened to me the other night. Just like it happened to Kerouac — but it was me and not him.\n\nI stumbled across something I only dimly remembered. It was on\n\nYouTube, and I stumbled over something I only dimly remembered. It was the last two minutes or so of an 'X-Files' episode entitled “The\n\nPost-Modern Prometheus”. I remembered it as a kind of visual 'send-up' of the James Whale\n\nUniversal horror movies I loved so much as a child. In “The Post-Modern Prometheus”, a “Frankenstein's-Monster” is located,\n\nby Mulder and Scully, and saved by them. The ending, however, I had not remembered.\n\nIt takes place in a crowded nightclub, and Cher takes the stage — at\n\nleast a look-alike — and belts out the song “Walking in Memphis”. Not only does the 'Monster', who is seated at a table in the front row,\n\ntogether with Scully and Mulder, jump right up and dance ecstatically\n\nto the song — that EXCELLENT song. But then Mulder beckons to Scully to join him on the\n\nfloor. Our frosty and usually confused “couple” get the message, of the song\n\nand of the place. They dance together, romantically and intimately, and touchingly.\n\n“Frankly, Neal, I began to cry.”\n\nI began to cry. Really cry. All choked up. Tears of joy, tears of feeling — feelings actually about my own wife,\n\nmy own “Joan-Girl”.\n\nThen I decided to write this piece.\n\nIdeas seem to come this way. You don't control them, or muster\n\nthem up, or command them to appear.\n\nThey come up through the emotions.\n\nBut it's often the eye that gets the ball rolling.\n\nINTO THE MYSTIC\n\nA few days ago I was driving with my friends Mary and Paul Zahl from Kayenta, Arizona, to Moab, Utah. We were going up to Moab to track down the locations where John Ford shot parts of Wagon Master (and other films.)\n\nOn the way, Paul suggested we make a detour to see the fabled Valley Of the Gods, a large basin surrounded by mesas and dotted with odd rock towers. My instinct was to proceed directly to Moab, but Paul's instinct was stronger so we set off on a dirt road into the valley.\n\nIt was a good road, of red clay — or would have been a good road if it hadn't been raining recently. The rain had turned it into glass. My big Navigator, in four-wheel-drive, kept losing traction on it, threatening to slide over the embankments on sharp turns. It was a little scary, but the car handled it all very well.\n\nThen, at the end of the road, we found ourselves driving straight towards the nearly sheer face of a tall mesa. There was, improbably, a road leading up the side of the mesa in a series of hair-raising switchbacks. The maps we had said the road was paved, and it was, but only in parts. The other parts were wet dirt — something we discovered too late.\n\nI started up the road, which is called the Moki Dugway — seen above in better weather conditions than we faced — and we all soon realized that we had made a big mistake. But I also realized that trying to turn the car around on such a road would probably be more dangerous than proceeding up it.\n\nSo we proceeded up it, at a snail's pace, with our hearts in our throats. I hugged the side of the mesa on the sharp curves, honking and hoping we wouldn't meet any oncoming traffic. There were no shoulders to speak of for most of the way, only terrifying drop-offs. If the Navigator's tires ever lost traction on the slippery dirt sections, it would have meant a certain flaming fiery death for all of us.\n\nBelow is a picture Mary took with her iPhone during the ascent. She took it upside down, as it happened — the condition of our stomachs at the time.\n\nFor a while it seemed as though the road would never end, but it finally did, on top of the mesa, where we were presented with . . . a winter wonderland. An endless plateau covered in snow, dotted with cedars, new snow falling gently on it all.\n\nIt was like a vision of peace and grace, granted to us after our ordeal.\n\nI couldn't get this extraordinary experience out of my mind. The next morning I had what felt like a revelation — I felt we had been led supernaturally to the Moki Dugway, where we reenacted, in a sense, the climactic scenes of Wagon Master, when the Mormons take their wagons up the side of a precipitous cliff, where wagons were not meant to go, in order to reach their promised land.\n\nI became convinced that John Ford himself had been riding with us on our climb up the mesa, having decided that we would not just have a leisurely meander up to Moab to gawk at his sublime locations for Wagon Master, but drive right into the heart of the movie. Mystical as it may sound, I think that's exactly what we did.\n\nTHE PREACHER FROM THE BLACK LAGOON\n\nIt occurs to me that many people who have been following Paul Zahl's posts for this site (collected in The Zahl File) may not know that he is a world-famous preacher, or have had a chance to hear one of his sermons.\n\nWell, here's your chance:\n\nWhat Is Love?\n\nThis sermon was preached at All Saints Episcopal Church in Chevy Chase, Maryland on a Sunday in 2009. I doubt if you've ever heard a sermon quite like it before. More than a few mainstream Christians have reacted to sermons of Paul's like this the way the human figures are reacting to the Creature in the poster above. They just seem to miss the point.\n\nWALKING IN MEMPHIS\n\nSome thoughts by Paul Zahl (of The Zahl File) on Jack Kerouac and his connection to Michael Curtiz's costume epic The Egyptian. Huh? Read on:\n\nThe 1954 Hollywood movie The Egyptian, a big picture, with Jean Simmons\n\nand Michael Wilding, among many others, is hard to find — all but impossible\n\nto find, in fact, until the days of Internet magic. (It's available on a Korean DVD.) It was produced by\n\nDarryl F. Zanuck and directed by Michael Curtiz. Curtiz had directed\n\nseveral big pictures, including Casablanca and Mildred Pierce, not to\n\nmention The Walking Dead and Mystery of the Wax Museum.\n\nThe Egyptian tells the story of a young doctor in Ancient Egypt —\n\nmeaning Thebes, Memphis, and Luxor — who is ensnared pitifully by a\n\ntemptress known as the “Woman of Babylon”, completely loses his\n\nself-respect, together with everything he owns as well as his post as\n\nPhysician to Pharaoh, and finally recreates himself as a\n\nhealer wandering throughout the Ancient World. He prospers, only to return home\n\nto lose his true and loyal love, played by Jean Simmons, and to become\n\ncaught up in the failed but sublime One God movement of the Pharaoh\n\nAkhenaten. In a touching scene that works dramatically and\n\ncinematically, Sinuhe, the doctor, is converted to monotheism. After\n\nall his sad experience of life, Sinuhe seeks monastic solitude in the\n\ndesert, a sadder man but much wiser.\n\nThe Egyptian is pretty good. The sets are gorgeous, the camera is\n\nfluid and assured, the acting (with the exception of Gene Tierney, who\n\nis miscast as Pharaoh's sister) confident if a little wooden, and the\n\nmatte paintings and miniatures convincing. Personally, I like the\n\nreligion of the film, with Akhenaten's confession of his universal faith\n\ngoing down well, with pathos, at the end. Some might say that The\n\nEgyptian is suffused with '50s-style religion in this country, but that\n\nwould be unfair. The film is so anchored in the pessimistic views —\n\ni.e., life as an exercise in dreamy futility, with loss — of the\n\nauthor of the original best-selling book, that Akhenaten's “witness” in\n\nthe last scene but one, comes off as credible, and for me even\n\nhopeful. The novel on which The Egyptian is based, incidentally, was\n\nwritten in the Finnish language by Mika Waltari. In the days of our\n\nfathers and mothers, Waltari's novel was an international sensation.\n\nWaltari's father, incidentally, was a Finnish Lutheran pastor. It was the Finnish Lutherans, of course, who brought us The Flying Saucer Of Love.\n\nHere's the thing:\n\nJack Kerouac saw The Egyptian in a movie theater when it first came out.\n\nHe hated it!\n\nThe vehemence of Kerouac's response to this relatively standard\n\nHollywood production is surprising. I read his armchair review, which occurs in Some of the Dharma (page\n\n124), three years ago and was impressed by his very negative reaction. Here is what he wrote:\n\nWITH 'THE EGYPTIAN' Darryl Zanuck has purveyed a teaching of\n\nviciousness and cruelty. They present him with a gold cup at banquets for this. The\n\nauthor, Mika Waltari, is also guilty of the same teaching of viciousness and\n\ncruelty. You see a scene of a man choking a woman under water. Both these men\n\nare rich as a consequence of the world's infatuation with the forbidden murder,\n\n— its daydreams of maniacal revenge by means of killing and Lust. Men kill\n\nand women lust for men. Men die and women lust for men. Men, think in solitude;\n\nlearn how to live off your sowings of seed in the ground. Or work 2 weeks a\n\nyear and live in the hermitage the rest of the year, procuring your basic foods\n\nat markets, and as your your garden grows work less, till you've learned to live\n\noff your garden alone.\n\nQUIETNESS AND REST THE ONLY ESCAPE.\n\nThe secret is in the desert.\n\nNow, Ain't that Peculiar! The Egyptian tells the story of a man\n\ndisillusioned by romantic love — in the first half he loses his whole\n\nself, his deepest self, to the wily and nefarious siren of Babylon.\n\nThe Egyptian envisions his then turning aside from the world, and\n\nbecoming a kind of medical “gentleman of the road”, a Sal Paradise of\n\nthe ancient Mediterranean. With Kerouacian pessimism, Sinuhe observes\n\nthe fruitlessness of human endeavor, and does so over and over again.\n\nFinally, back home in Thebes — I love writing those words — he\n\nbecomes enlightened by Akhenaten, the Sun (One) worshiper, who reveals\n\nto him that God is the whole of Reality, and that Forgiveness, of all\n\nthings, is at the core of that Reality. There is something like\n\npantheism here, together with absolving Christianity, and the the name\n\n“Jesus Christ” is invoked on the end-title. How could Kerouac not have\n\nresponded positively to this, given his Christo-Buddhism, or\n\nBuddhist-Christianity, or however you want to call his personal\n\nsynthesis?\n\nBut he didn't like the film. He focused completely on the Woman of\n\nBabylon sequence, with its subtle, slightly-off-frame drowning of the\n\nSiren — she survives — and the “lust of the eye” and lust of the body\n\nwhich drives the story at that point. Biographers of Jack Kerouac\n\nwould probably observe in these comments his suspicion of entrapping\n\nwomen and entrapped men, his frequent equation of greed and lust, and\n\nhis persistent failed efforts to choose celibacy on Buddhist grounds\n\n— “Men . . . learn how to live off your sowings of seed in the ground [my emphasis].”\n\nI want to guess that Kerouac got stuck on the performance by Bella\n\nDarvi as Nefer, the Woman of Babylon, and did not consider the enduring\n\nTreue of Jean Simmons' character, nor the emphatic world-renunciation\n\nby Sinuhe, which begins and ends The Egyptian.\n\nWhat his impassioned observations do tell us, and they read as sober\n\nand non-Benzedrined, is that Kerouac was touchy about violence. This\n\nis the man who would brawl in bars, mad-drunk, and then write\n\nremorseful exhortations to the whole world to Be Kind. He was also a\n\nman who loved women, but suspected them, and their “designs”, through\n\nand through, with the exception of Gabrielle, his mother.\n\nTake a look at The Egyptian. It's a good movie. Sure, it's too long.\n\nAnd to be sure, there's not one word of humor. But the liturgical\n\nscenes, with their ethereal religious chants praising “Beauty” (I\n\nthought I could hear Lionel Ritchie's “You are so Beautiful”) — which\n\nwork! — and especially the obeisances, including Jean Simmons's, on the\n\nsteps of the temple of the One (Sun) God, are sincerely reverent, and\n\naffecting.\n\nYou could compare the scene of Pharaoh's archers breaking into the\n\nTemple of Aten with the Roman breach of the Temple in Nicholas Ray's\n\nThe King of Kings. The latter is bloody and sensationalistic (like the “Civil War” cards little boys loved in the '60s, by the same people who\n\ndid the “Mars Attacks” cards) — the former, sympathetic and pitiful.\n\nMy irony for today is this:\n\nJack Kerouac should have liked The Egyptian. The title character, take\n\naway the toga, is the man himself.\n\nMaybe he walked out before the end. The editor of this blog taught me never to\n\ndo that.\n\nSOME OF THE MOONRISE\n\nDrunk late at night in 1955, Jack Kerouac watched Frank Borzage's Moonrise on TV, and wrote this poem about it, in his notebook of religious meditations eventually published as Some Of the Dharma:\n\nDUMB POEM CALLED “MOONRISE”\n\nA snake in a pond\n\nSlithers out of harm\n\nSeeking the frond\n\nOf the heavenly farm.\n\nJeb was your Paw\n\nForevermore\n\nAnd this is the law\n\nOf love and gore.\n\nThe blood of the bear\n\nIs soaking in the swamp,\n\nSuch heavenly air\n\nOverhangs his pomp.\n\nGive yourself up\n\nTo the sheriffs of truth,\n\nFear no hound pup\n\nNo karma of tooth\n\nFor your sweet smile\n\nAnd meditations desperate\n\nAre wine to the senile\n\nAnd love to degenerate\n\nFace the shroudy kitchen\n\nOf the sea of the night\n\nAnd make a pretty kitten\n\nOf all this abounding blight\n\n(Written after watching, drunk, Dane Clark on\n\nTV in movie MOONRISE) —\n\nSome cloth has that sin rip\n\nThis doesnt\n\nMy friend Paul Zahl (of The Zahl File) drew my attention to this. He writes:\n\nThis is Kerouac's little riff on a surprising movie, with its\n\nProphet of Grace Sheriff and its Recluse of Wisdom Rex Ingram, its\n\ninsight about dogs, and its unsensational, unforgettable scene on a\n\nvery small ferris wheel.\n\nI think I could preach three sermons arising from stanza four, and another two about the movie's not having “that sin rip”. I'm not sure they'd be received all that well — but maybe on a park bench some day, as in Moonrise. Kerouac, watching a late night movie on television and\n\ndrunk, manages to capture the theme of the film. Does “blood”-destiny have to determine the outcome of a life? Or can other\n\nthings, like love (the shaky and vulnerable heroine), a wise man for\n\nfather-figure (the Rex Ingram character “Mose”, who knows what's really\n\nup before anyone else does, and who gives his hounds the dignity of\n\nbeing called “Mr. Dog” and means it) . . .\n\n. . . and a philosopher-sheriff, the\n\nlikes of whom I have never seen depicted in a movie — sort of a\n\nsmall-town “zen-detective” (the phrase is Thornton Wilder's) — who is\n\nable to convey a concrete quality of grace in unsentimental terms. Can\n\nthe “sin rip” (Kerouac's phrase, not the movie's) be mended? Mended in\n\nbelievable terms, in a way that could actually happen?\n\nKerouac takes karma, and a dog's bite andfaithfulness,\n\nand the cabin kitchen at the end; and the swamp of the beginning and\n\nmiddle; and comes up with a . . . kitten. All while drunk!\n\nONE STEP BEYOND — DON'T GO THERE\n\nPaul Zahl (of The Zahl File) offers another meditation on an extraordinary bit of American culture from days gone by, the T. V. series One Step Beyond. If you don't remember it, or never saw it, Paul suggests that you might do well to keep it that way, just for your own peace of mind:\n\nEXCRUCIATING — BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE . . .\n\nby Paul F. M. Zahl\n\nWay Out, Roald Dahl's television show, was the ugly one, the ghoulish\n\none, the cruel one.\n\nTwilight Zone was the high end of these early television gems of the fantastic — moralistic and righteous, at times redemptive and even hopeful.\n\nChrist got at least two positive mentions in the Rod Serling scripts,\n\nand the team effort showed in the artful results.\n\nBut in between, in between the cruelty of Roald Dahl and the justice of\n\nRod Serling, came the observing eye of . . . John Newland.\n\nNewland is barely remembered today, but in the late 1950s and early\n\n1960s (and even into the 1970s) he produced, directed, and acted in\n\nscores and scores of television shows, mostly in the supernatural or\n\nthriller line. Speaking of Thriller, Newland directed “Pigeons from\n\nHell” for that great series, scaring us all where it counts — early\n\nchildhood — and leaving us with that tender scar forever.\n\nNewland's big achievement was hosting three seasons of a series concerning the\n\nparanormal. The series was entitled One Step Beyond. It was created by Merwin Gerard and consisted of\n\nthirty-minute 'docu-dramas' of supposed instances of possession,\n\nghostly presence, telepathy, and predictions of dreadful futures.\n\nI have been watching One Step Beyond since the day it was birthed, in\n\n1959. Almost all of the shows have been on video since the beginning,\n\nas they were somehow in the public domain. And now — there is a God\n\n— Paramount has released the first season of One Step Beyond in\n\nsplendid condition. Oh, and the music, especially the theme called\n\n“Fear”, written by Harry Lubin, is the ultimate science-fiction/horror\n\ntheme. Anyone who is reading this would recognize it instantly. (I\n\nlisten to it right before bedtime every night. Mary loves it, too.)\n\nBut what has come to me in recent viewings, with an almost stunning\n\npower, is a sort of personal truth about the inner spring of these\n\ntight dramas. It is a truth about the supernatural in general, and it\n\nsprings from its source. These stories, with few exceptions that I can\n\nsee, are about love lost or love gone wrong. Someone has lost someone,\n\nand is desperate with grief. He or she is completely naked to the\n\npossibility of contact. Or someone has done somebody wrong, and the\n\nguilt is killing them. Or, even, somebody hates somebody else, and the\n\nhate gets objectified, in some kind of paranormal occurrence.\n\nBelow are some examples of what I am talking about. (“The Dead Part Of\n\nthe House” is available on the official Paramount DVD release (above), the\n\nrest are available for download or viewing through YouTube or related\n\nsites.)\n\nSeason One, Episode Nine: “The Dead Part of the House”\n\nA widower hates his nine-year-old daughter because she survived an\n\naccident that killed her mother.\n\nHe resents his little girl. And she knows it, and the child is\n\nperishing for love, in front of his eyes.\n\nShe develops three ghostly friends, and in a benign move, these\n\nsupernatural friends are able to bring her father to his senses.\n\nPhillip Abbott plays the father and conveys an irrational paternal\n\nhatred, based on a love for his wife gone awry, that is painful to\n\nwatch, in the extreme. The little girl is entirely sympathetic, and so\n\ncompletely shaken. Moreover, the child's kind aunt is powerless over\n\nher brother.\n\nIt is Tennessee Williams, as far as I am concerned, on a claustrophobic\n\n'50s television set, yet completely unself-conscious.\n\nSeason Two, Episode Seven: “The Open Window”\n\nA painter of fashion models — his current model is played by Louise Fletcher —\n\nobserves a woman in an apartment across the way preparing to commit\n\nsuicide. She has been rejected romantically and her little\n\nblack-and-white four-walled world is killing her. Her disconcerting\n\nmonologue and preparations, overheard and observed, have several\n\nantecedents in theater and movies. But the television camera closes in\n\non her, with dissection. It is impossible to watch. And it's only\n\n1960!\n\nAs for the denouement, you'll have to see it yourself. But it's not\n\nreally about the genre, it's about human attachment severed and love\n\ntorn to shreds. How did Newland, who produced and directed, get this\n\nout at an early hour Friday night? I don't think anybody at the\n\nnetwork or the sponsor must have seen it as serious, because it was\n\nabout, uh, ESP. But it was very serious.\n\nSeason Two, Episode 20: “Who Are You?”\n\nA little girl wakes up in her bed and doesn't recognize her parents.\n\nHer parents are loving, devoted, and dear. She runs away and finds the people she believes to be her parents. They, for their part, are living in a total darkness of grief, having\n\nlost their own little girl recently.\n\nThe little girl we are watching is possessed of the spirit of the\n\nother, dead little girl. And she is horrified by the attentions of her natural parents. And her grief-stricken 'real' parents are horrified by her.\n\nThis child is totally lost, but alive and real, a whole self of\n\nyearning.\n\nWhen “Who Are You?” is over and the implications of the first 20\n\nminutes — these shows are all 29 minutes long — begin to sink in, the\n\nsituation becomes excruciating.\n\nIn short, don't watch this.\n\nJust two more examples, but they can be multiplied by a score of others:\n\nSeason Two, Episode 32: “Delia”\n\nHere is a humdinger, which begins so quietly and prosaically that the\n\nmiddle section takes you completely by surprise.\n\nA vacationing American man is trying to recover from a second lousy\n\nmarriage, and is drinking in a bar on a quiet island off Mexico. Another American, a sexy divorcée, at a table nearby, invites him\n\nover. She is beautiful and the kind of woman most men would love to\n\nmeet under such circumstances. But he turns her down. He is\n\nimpossible.\n\nHe takes a self-pitying walk down to the beach, and half way down,\n\nmeets an extremely beautiful, refined, and quite un-sexy woman sitting\n\nalone by a tree. She knows all about him, connects with him instantly\n\n— as he with her — and they are completely and in a single minute one\n\nin love forever. She is the lost and final love eternal, with eternal\n\neyes and never-ending smile.\n\nHe exits for a moment, comes back — and she is gone.\n\nHe spends the rest of his life searching for her, and ends up back on\n\nthe island, where he awaits her return, and drinks himself to death.\n\nI won't give away the ending.\n\nThis little parable is the ultimate dream of romance between a man and\n\na woman. Drink to me only with thine eyes. I will spend my life\n\nawaiting your return. And die in the process.\n\nAfter you see “Delia” once, it becomes impossible to watch it again.\n\nGet thee behind me. (Get thee to a nunnery)\n\nHe should have stayed with the giving brunette. Hélas, he didn't.\n\nSeason Two, Episode 33: “The Visitor”\n\nThis one is a celebrated episode. It starred Joan Fontaine, with Warren\n\nBeatty, in either his first or second appearance ever.\n\nIt concerns a woman in older middle-age who has left her husband,\n\nagainst his will, for the bottle; and has pulled herself completely\n\nwithin herself at their cozy mountain get-away. A nice fire is burning\n\non a snowy night, there's plenty of money, and there's a bar full of\n\nwhisky. But a young man knocks at the door, his car having broken down\n\nin the snow, and he is trying to get to the hospital where his young\n\nwife is having a baby. He cannot get there.\n\nWho he is and why he is there and what he has come to do? All is\n\nrevealed, neatly and affectingly.\n\nAgain, this is about love gone wrong, about malice as the consequence of hurt,\n\nabout grief causing people to go mad — and all on a minuscule set, with one\n\ncamera, two actors, and dread, with heart.\n\nDon't see this one either.\n\nI watch these episodes of One Step Beyond and have to tell myself not\n\nto watch any more. They are saturated with grief. They are fistfuls of loss and love that\n\nis separated, by the curtain of death, from fulfillment, even promise.\n\nYes, there is compassion — and none whatever of the ghoulish joy in\n\nkarma that Way Out featured every time. I would call these instances\n\nof Baby-Boomer television masterpieces of wrecked emotion, and love's\n\nattachment snapped forever.\n\nHow come these are so powerful — if “excruciating” means powerful? I would like to finish this article by trying to say why.\n\nIn the first place these are completely uncompromised one-act plays.\n\nThe camera prowls around — I honestly think of Rossellini and the\n\ninquiring camera, maybe even the camera as protagonist, though I fear\n\nthat sounds pretentious. (I invoked Tolstoy once in a conversation\n\nwith Joe Dante, and he suddenly started to look at me coolly. I sure\n\nwanted to withdraw that particular comment.) Yet it is true that John\n\nNewland's camera moves around a lot, in interior spaces about the size\n\nof a closet most of the time. In addition, his close-ups, which are\n\nnumerous, completely fill the screen. These are intimate dramas —\n\nthey are about one or two, or at the most three, characters. The\n\npeople's faces are tortured. They are anguished. The unflinching\n\nclose-ups mostly record grief and separation. What are ghosts\n\nin these stories other than objectified presences of love become\n\nunattainable? Thus the excruciating atmosphere of One Step Beyond.\n\nThere is one other thing:\n\nWhen I was eight and nine years old and saw shows like this, I\n\ndefinitely connected with the fear and dread. But\n\nI didn't really get the truth. The psychology was completely at the\n\nedges, or rather, out of the question.\n\nI just knew, to my bones and my nerve ends, that something serious was\n\ngoing on.\n\nToo serious.\n\nTwilight Zone, which saved the day, was more distanced somehow. It\n\ndidn't raise the resistance that was raised by One Step Beyond.\n\nNeither could I have appreciated The Glass Menagerie. (Still can't\n\nwatch the last act.)\n\nMy advice to you, dear reader, is Skip This One. Sit It Out.\n\nIt's too close to home. Take away the supernatural part of it, and\n\nthere is only human loss.\n\nOder — and I truly wish I had done this when I was president of a\n\ntheological seminary — show “Delia'”and “The Dead Part of the House”\n\nto a class for future ministers on . . . pastoral care. In the church,\n\nand in the frayed and hungry world around us, you're going to encounter\n\nquite a few Delias and a whole directory full of The Dead Parts of\n\nHouses.\n\nTHE THEATER OF GARDENS\n\nHere's another piece by Mary Zahl about gardens — getting into the nuts and bolts of the way a garden works and how that contributes to what it means:\n\nLOOKING AT THE HOUSE AND GARDEN RELATIONSHIP\n\nby Mary Zahl\n\nReflecting on what is happening visually in what I consider good\n\nresidential garden design, whether my own or someone else’s, I have to\n\nstart with the relationship of the house to the garden. For good or\n\nill, the house is the most important structure in the landscape. That\n\nmakes creating an effective relationship between the two all the more\n\ndifficult if the house is a) not particularly attractive, and b) not\n\ndesigned to open up to the outside visually.\n\nThe first point is staring me in the face as I look at much of the\n\nresidential architecture around me: In Central Florida, most new\n\nhousing is the big-box-with-a-roof look in stucco, the older houses are\n\none-story cinderblocks, and the terrain is pretty flat for both. Only\n\nwhere there are established large trees (live oaks!), is there much\n\nhope for a satisfying complimentary landscape design. The photo above shows a typical single-story Central Florida home graced with majestic live oaks.\n\nThe second point came home to me vividly in the last house we lived in,\n\na church-owned rectory situated next to a parking lot. This was an\n\nattractive two-story colonial stone house from the outside. But from\n\nthe inside, the only views out from the living areas were of the\n\nparking lot. Even the screen porch had this vantage! We might as well\n\nhave been living in a house with no windows, apart from some of the\n\nfiltered light. I found it depressing.\n\nWhen designing a garden, one of the primary tasks is to go into the\n\nhouse and look out from the key windows and doors. I ask the clients\n\nwhere they like to sit, and it is almost always in a room with a view\n\nof the garden. Most gardens end up being a stage set, which means they\n\nshould look as attractive as possible as much of the year as possible\n\nfrom the inside. Above is a garden in Birmingham, Alabama, as seen from a favorite indoor spot of the clients.\n\nAnyone who has a swimming pool understands that it\n\nshould be beautiful to look at, because it may seldom be used for what\n\nit was intended.\n\nThen, working on paper, I draw center lines out from each of those\n\nimportant vistas, and try to make the garden’s axes work from them.\n\nNot only is this the classic design principle we inherited from the\n\nAncients, but an adaptation of this axial approach is what makes the\n\ngreatest gardens of the world — many in England — work so well:\n\nI am often reminded of a friend’s explaining to me that Balanchine was\n\nsuch a great choreographer because he never abandoned the classical\n\nprinciples, but found creative ways to interpret them. This same idea\n\nis at work in the best English gardens, such as Sissinghurst or\n\nBarnsley House. That's Sissinghurst Garden in the photo above, in Kent, England, designed by Harold Nicholson and\n\nVita Sackville-West, among the first to combine strong geometric lines\n\nwith profuse planting, a marriage of two elements and two personalities\n\nthat matched them.\n\nThe challenge for me as a garden designer is to stick\n\nto classical principles of axes and proportion with a huge variety of\n\nresidential architectural styles. Above, the “axis” of a garden in Birmingham.\n\nThis is where the plants and the quality of hard materials come in.\n\nPlanting needs to soften and “warm up” the geometry. Materials should\n\nage as quickly as possible to do the same, which is why natural stone\n\nor brick or pots are always preferable. Geometry alone makes for a\n\ncold garden. A profusion of plants with no geometry or relationship to\n\nthe house’s architecture is too chaotic for my tastes, and makes for a\n\nless integrated whole, and actually a less peaceful atmosphere\n\nyear-round. Getting that balance right for the client’s taste is the\n\nbiggest challenge I have. Well, that, and creating something that\n\ndoesn’t die!\n\nBelow, an example of strong geometry and natural materials softened by planting in a Birmingham garden:\n\nFinally, to go a step further, I want the views to be so appealing that\n\nthey actually draw the owner out into the garden. This is my unstated\n\ngoal: to create a gardener — or at least someone who is drawn into\n\nnature and away from the computer or television — to a place that might\n\nfeed their soul.\n\nBelow, an inviting space for sitting in a small courtyard garden in Birmingham:\n\nI'm struck by Mary's comparison of the garden to a stage set, something that must work first as seen through the “proscenium arches” of a house's apertures — windows, doors, porch frames. The same is true for a theatrical set, once the curtain rises, or for the shots in a movie. All these “sets” must be pleasing in themselves but also invite us to enter them — literally in the case of gardens, imaginatively in the case of stage or screen. A stage set or a shot in a film, like a garden, can't just offer us a pretty picture — it must have a spatial quality which lures us into it, makes us want to inhabit it. Only then, as with a garden, can it work its real magic.\n\n[Photos by Mary Zahl, who also designed all the Birmingham gardens pictured above.]\n\nHELLO, MR. CHIPS\n\nPaul Zahl, the Preacher From the Black Lagoon (see The Zahl File), revisits a commercial disaster from days gone by — the 1969 version of Goodbye, Mr. Chips:\n\nA MOVIE WITH SOUL\n\nby Paul Zahl\n\nI am beginning to know James Hilton's books and the movies made of\n\nthem, such as Lost Horizon, in two wonderful versions; Random Harvest,\n\nwhich is an almost perfect elegy to selfless love; and Goodbye, Mr.\n\nChips, also in two wonderful versions.\n\nThe second version of Chips, which bombed in 1969 (with the exception\n\nof Pauline Kael's memorable praise), is an interesting case of a film\n\nthat more or less disappeared after its initial showing, became almost\n\nnotorious for its over-dubbed and stream-of-consciousness songs, and\n\nco-starred the now less-remembered English pop star Petula Clark.\n\nA personal interest in James Hilton, together with an interest in the\n\nEnglish playwright Terence Rattigan, led me to this movie recently,\n\nwhich was released on DVD last January. And yes, it is an odd\n\ncollection of things — a familiar drama (or so it seems at first) of\n\nlife in an English boarding school; a use of idyllic outdoor long shots\n\nand zoom effects that are like ads for Tab, or even Coke, back in the\n\n'60s; spectacular and also heavily edited musical numbers within a\n\nstory concerning a Latin master of the 1920's; and in the heart of it,\n\nright at the core of it, a love story that rings completely true.\n\nIn short, this is a movie with soul, which is also greater than the sum\n\nof its parts.\n\nAfter watching two versions of Terence Rattigan's The Browning Version,\n\nboth of which were filmed on the same location (i.e., Sherborne School\n\nin southern England) as the 1969 Chips, I felt saturated with this\n\nelite context. (The first version of The Browning Version, with Michael Redgrave, is illustrated above.) Is there much left to say, after these two persuasive\n\nworks, about the introversion and disappointments of prep school\n\nteachers of Latin and Greek? Well, Rattigan must have believed there\n\nwas, because he took a familiar story, Hilton's novella of Brookfield\n\nSchool, and batted it straight into the stratosphere.\n\nHis script, which now focusses almost completely on the love story of\n\nMr. Chipping, played by Peter O'Toole, and the unlikely love of his\n\nlife, played by Petula Clark, is literary and beautiful, full of\n\nClassical allusions yet uncontrived. When Rattigan puts the Ancient\n\nGreek maxim “Know thyself”, together with the God Apollo, at the\n\nturning point of the story, it is fully apt and touching and true.\n\nHe also writes a scene between the two meant-for-each-other lovers,\n\nfilmed by the Victorian greenhouse at Syon House on the Thames, which\n\nis as affecting a proposal of marriage — it is basically she who\n\nproposes to him, yet with no tenor of forwardness — as anything of its\n\nkind on film. Incidentally, I write as someone who has performed\n\nhundreds of marriages and who gladly embraces Lloydville's title, Preacher From the Black Lagoon.\n\nHow does a movie acquire soul? We have an impressive script by a\n\nmaster, Terence Rattigan. We have a great theme from James Hilton: the\n\ntransformation in real time and life that is effected by a devoted\n\nwoman in relation to a shy misunderstood schoolmaster, and the\n\nconsequent effect of the couple's marriage on an entire community,\n\nBrookfield School, petty, political, and witchy. Yet these two\n\nelements don't fully account for the movie's soul, which means you\n\nstart crying by the middle of act two and can't stop until way after\n\nthe end.\n\nI think there are two other things that make Chips something like a\n\ngreat movie, although probably not a great movie in the way of\n\ncinematic art. The first is its visual style, which, as I said, is\n\nfull of long shots of the heroine and hero, with flowers in the\n\nforeground; constantly changing colors to mirror the emotions of the\n\nleads; many zooms from high up (God's eye!); and basically the most\n\naccomplished style of the kind of thing Dan Curtis was doing in his\n\nmade-for-television horror movies of the same era: a little arty,\n\nconsciously 'visual', and plain pretty. It works here and you probably\n\nwouldn't alter a thing. Thus the sequence at Pompeii and Paestum works\n\nbecause the honey-colored marble of the sublime ruins matches the early\n\nlove of the surprizing surprized couple.\n\nThe second added thing in this wondrous movie is the music. The songs\n\nare by Leslie Bricusse, who wrote “Stop the World, I Want To Get Off”;\n\nand the instrumentation is by John Williams. The songs were considered\n\nforgettable when Goodbye, Mr. Chips first opened, without much for\n\ntunes. Yet they are mostly sung by Petula Clark and Peter O'Toole as\n\nnarrations rather than lip-synch performance. They are internal\n\nmonologues. They are therefore true to life. Petula Clark's song\n\n“Apollo”, for example is subtle and everything that the word “nuanced”\n\nis now supposed to mean. And I will guarantee something to the readers\n\nof this blog: If you see Chips and do not go straight to YouTube or\n\niTunes and listen to “Fill the World With Love”, over and over again,\n\nyou had better check to see if you still have a heart. To be honest\n\nwith you, now that I know what that Bricusse-composed school hymn means\n\nin light of the powerful story in which it figures so prominently, I\n\ndon't ever want to sing anything else again. (Maybe “Be True To Your\n\nSchool” by the Beach Boys, but nothing more, ever again.)\n\nSo, here is a movie with soul. Goodbye, Mr. Chips from that hinge year\n\n1969 is hard to explain. It's got Hilton in the first stratum,\n\nRattigan in the second, sublime if ever so slightly cheesy visuals, and\n\nintrospective songs that work, partly because they do not overwhelm the\n\nother elements.\n\nThere is a fifth element, however, one more thing, to add. There is\n\nPeter O'Toole and Petula Clark. These actors were made for each\n\nother. Clark embodies a kind of heroine that you rarely see any more.\n\n(I married one 36 years ago.) She loves her husband, supports him\n\nwith everything she has and thus brings out qualities in him that he\n\nnever knew he had, and she's humble while having a kind of luminosity\n\n— a word like “nuanced” which suffers from over-use — or inner\n\nspiritual strength that is contagious in this self-absorbed world.\n\nKatherine Brisket, which is the name of Clark's character, is the\n\nstrongest entity in the entire movie. Yet her life's work is love.\n\nThat is why the bull's eye center of Goodbye, Mr. Chips is the scene\n\nwhen Mrs. Chipping takes the entire student body and faculty to a new\n\nand noble level as she leads them, not by design, in the school hymn\n\n“Fill the World With Love”. This is not dumb! It completely works.\n\nNo wonder O'Toole's character falls in love with her, defends her, and\n\nestablishes an unforgettable rock of a life with her.\n\nGoodbye, Mr. Chips is now available on a beautiful DVD, its soundtrack\n\nalso available on a connoisseur's three-disc CD from Film Score\n\nMonthly.\n\nOh, and I just took a look at Joanna, made one year earlier in England\n\nwith Donald Sutherland and Genevieve Waite (and Rod McKuen — listen to\n\nthe warm) in order to get some perspective on the period. Odd isn't\n\nit: I loved Joanna back then, and thought Chips was dumb. Now I love\n\nChips and think Joanna is the queen of dumb.\n\nTOMBS OF THE BLIND DEAD\n\nA report by Paul Zahl about a strange, haunted museum in St. Petersburg, Russia:\n\nThis past August, I slipped away for an afternoon from the tour group I\n\nwas helping to lead in Russia and the Baltics. I slipped away in order\n\nto see a weird museum in St. Petersburg.\n\nI had heard heard of it before, and its original form under the\n\nSoviets, the notorious Museum of Atheism. Until a few years ago,\n\nRussian young people used to be taken to the former St. Isaac's\n\nCathedral in Leningrad/Petrograd/St. Petersburg to witness a\n\nState-operated exhibition displaying the folly, ignorance, and\n\nwickedness of Christianity, with side-exhibits on Buddhism, Animism,\n\nJudaism, Islam, and the Greek and Roman Gods.\n\nAfter perestroika, the Museum was dismantled and St. Isaac's became a\n\nRussian Orthodox cathedral again. The exhibits persist, however, in\n\na big old gray crate of a building about three blocks away. To visit\n\nthe 'Museum of Religion' today, is to have a fascinating window on the\n\nSoviet assault on religion, in general, and Christianity, in\n\nparticular. And there is a lot to say about this, in that a whole new\n\ngeneration of Western atheists would love this place, with its\n\noverwhelming assumption that religion is a matter of competing\n\nbelief-systems with no judgments possible concerning the possible\n\ntruth-superiority of one system over against any another.\n\nI could go on about the sociological, cultural, and even the\n\ntheological implications of St. Petersburg's Museum of Religion in the\n\nYear of Our Lord 2009. But that's not what really drew me to the\n\nMuseum.\n\nWhat drew me to the Museum of Religion, located three blocks away from\n\nits original Russian Orthodox/Stalinist home, were the visuals, the\n\nabsurd visuals, which I hoped, and guessed, would be there.\n\nAnd they were there!\n\nYou pay your entrance fee and immediately notice that there are five\n\ntimes more guards in this museum than there are visitors. Once, Soviet\n\n'confirmation' classes would have crowded the place, together with\n\nmasses of foreign tourists bussed over. Today there is no one there at\n\nall. Today's Museum of Religion is not deemed as interesting as\n\nyesterday's Museum of Atheism. But it's the same material.\n\nYou go up a tiny staircase — have to be pointed in the right direction\n\nby one of the half-dozen guards who are looking at you like fresh meat\n\n— and then enter a series of small rooms that display the Origin of\n\nChristianity and move directly into a series of four or five rooms on\n\nRussian Orthodoxy. None of the guards spoke English, but one of them\n\nspoke German so I got the lay of the land from her. The room on Jesus\n\nemphasized his teachings, with a small dose of messianism. In each\n\nsmall room concerning Orthodoxy, paintings of episodes in Russian\n\nOrthodox history were set up, together with liturgical vessels and\n\naltar crosses and vestments. There was a mannequin of an Orthodox\n\npriest — really ragged and dusty and gross. There was an amazing\n\npainting of an Orthodox monk wandering in the snow looking like a\n\ncharacter from one of the “Blind Dead” movies as abducted by aliens, a\n\ngreen Village of the Damned gleam streaming from both of his eyes.\n\nThis is the Tolstoyan religious hermit depicted as insane man.\n\nThere was another shocking painting nearby, from around the time of the\n\n1905 Revolution (i.e., the time of The Battleship Potemkin), depicting Nicholas and\n\nAlexandra protected by a holy beam of light coming down from Christ and\n\nthe Father and Mary in heaven. The Tsar and Tsarina are surrounded by\n\npriests and martyrs, who are being shot at by squads of Reds, who are\n\nin turn being given money by Jews. The image is shocking and violent,\n\nand also apocalyptic.\n\nInterestingly to me as a Christian, one item in the rooms dedicated to\n\nRussian Orthodoxy stood out with a moving and unquestionable\n\nintensity. It is a marble statue, about four feet high, of Jesus naked\n\nand bound, being led to his crucifixion. He is muscular and intrepid,\n\nbut helplessly under restraint. It is a beautiful image. It leaped out\n\nof its “wax museum” surroundings.\n\nIncidentally, I kept thinking of Professor Lampini's “Chamber of\n\nHorrors” in House of Frankenstein, and also of Will Rogers' hay-seed\n\nwax museum of American heroes in Steamboat 'round the Bend. The people\n\nwho assembled the Russian exhibit on religion probably didn't know\n\nmuch about what they were exhibiting, except that it all needed to be\n\nas ugly as possible. To see it in the Summer of 2009, now tatty in the\n\nextreme, and filthy, is extremely cool.\n\nBut wait, I'm not finished. The Museum has a section on\n\nProtestantism. Behold, another manikin!: this time, of a “Reformed\n\nPastor”. But it's mistaken. The cassock is right, and the preaching\n\ntabs, but the figure is wearing a large pectoral cross. Reformed\n\nministers, at least until very recently, have not worn crosses around\n\ntheir necks. Heaven forfend! And there's a Hogarth engraving of an\n\n18th Century church that has the complete wrong title. On the other\n\nhand, the “attitude” of the exhibit is nowhere near as vehement in\n\nrelation to Protestantism as it is in relation to the Russian National\n\nChurch. Protestantism comes across as being a rare and relatively\n\nenlightened bird.\n\nSpeaking of birds, the room on Animism is great. There is a statue of\n\na big black bird, I think a Polynesian deity, with yellow and red\n\nfeathers. They are coming unglued, so you start to sneeze as soon as\n\nyou enter the room. But there are no other visitors to hear you or\n\nnotice. Since I had brought no Kleenex, I was glad to be sneezing\n\nalone. One of the feathers that had come off and was lying on the\n\nfloor was too small to be of any aid.\n\nOne final item, and then a postscript. The attempt at constructing a\n\nBuddhist meditation area or temple — no words can do this justice —\n\nwas delightful. There were a couple of small statues of the Buddha, on\n\na wooden platform about six inches off the ground in the center of the\n\nroom. Overhead were a couple of scarves or pashminas, intended to be\n\ndrapes, but they were blowing in the wind because the Museum's fans\n\nwere on. That was it. I was just wishing for a little background\n\nmusic by Enigma.\n\nAll in all, the Museum of Religion in St. Petersburg is a relic of\n\nfascinating persistence in the aftermath of an historical earthquake in\n\nRussia, and in the world even. Is it anti-religious? Well, yes, as\n\nthe attitude is that of competing, fantastic, and anthropomorphic\n\nattempts to represent the Unrepresentable. It reflects what religious\n\nstudies departments in American universities used to call “phenomenology”, which is the idea that religion has got to be studied\n\npurely in relation to its surface manifestations, rather than in\n\nrelation to the possibility of actual or possible transcendence. So\n\nyes, the Museum of Religion is anti-religious.\n\nBut it is also a Museum which has been demoted. It is definitely not\n\nthe Museum of Atheism. The cue cards to each room, which my\n\nunrehearsed and unexpected guide explained to me in German, try to\n\nsound objective. But they are just reporting on what fools these\n\nmortals be. (Oh, and only in the room devoted to the French Revolution\n\ndoes the visual material really go over the top, and this in its\n\nsatirizations of Roman Catholicism. In this room, we are really in the\n\nspirit of Robespierre and 1793.)\n\nWhat appealed to me primarily in this messy nut-house of an exhibit\n\nhall was its absurdity — the misconceived manequin of a Presbyterian\n\nclergyman, the feathers-and-all large Polynesian bird (looking like the\n\nmonster in The Giant Claw), the hagiographic and extreme-polemical\n\npainting of the martyred Nicholas and Alexandra, and the sudden\n\noverwhelming appearance of the real thing: Jesus in white marble,\n\nbound, humble, decided, suffering, pitying and to be pitied yet\n\nwordlessly strong. The “camp” value of the place, which is out of\n\nBilly Wilder's One Two Three (remember “We Have No Bananas” in\n\nRussian?), is high. The sadness of its exhibits with many more warders\n\nthan visitors is also pathetic in the real sense. And yet the flashes\n\nof insight, both negative to organized religion and positive to bound\n\nmartyrs — and hermits of the forest — are really there.\n\nI left, a little bewildered, a little amused,\n\na little moved, as I said “Auf wiedersehen!” to my new Russian\n\nguard/guide, who may have picked up her German during the Siege of\n\nLeningrad. I thought to myself: this is the kind of thing that the SS envisioned when they\n\ngave orders that the Jewish Ghetto in Prague be turned into an open-air\n\nmuseum after its inhabitants had been liquidated — a “time-capsule” of\n\na vanished people and a vanished way of life, which people of the\n\nfuture could inspect and wonder at. Today, however, the Ghetto in\n\nPrague is the symbol of an entirely different kind of confidence, and\n\nthe tables are turned utterly. I thought these things as I heard the\n\nbells of St. Isaac's, just three blocks away, and observed the hundreds\n\nand hundreds of people crowding to get in — and not just tourists from\n\noverseas, but Russian citizens. As Jack Kerouac said, “The world is\n\nbig enough to right itself.”\n\nPostscript\n\nIf you enjoyed this piece, go over to YouTube and connect with Sergei\n\nEisenstein's silent film of 1927 entitled October. It is also called\n\nTen Days That Shook the World. In the fourth segment of the YouTube\n\nversion, when General Kornilov's army is approaching St. Petersburg,\n\nEisenstein creates a montage on the theme of God. When the soldiers\n\nare being enjoined, by reactionaries, to fight “For God and for the\n\nState”, the director edits together a series of images of God.\n\nHe starts with Jesus; then goes to the mosque in St. Petersburg, which\n\nstill looks like it did when Eisenstein's photographer Edward Tisse\n\nshot it in the silent era; then shows the Buddha, incense billowing\n\naround him this time, not a pashmina; then our Polynesian Giant Claw (I\n\nreally think it's the same statue.); then some tribal African statues;\n\nthen some spooky dangling hands from one of those statues; then a few\n\nreally horrible and very Pagan religious images. There it is! In\n\nEisenstein's film exists the direct origin of the now staggeringly\n\nretro Museum of Religion. That's what it was really all about: a\n\nfrontal and absolute ideological rejection of religion as being\n\nanything other than competing disasters of projection and morbidity,\n\ncarrying the planetary virus of idolatry — religion as systematic\n\nput-down of the humanity of the human race.\n\nI want to tell Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris about this movie, not to\n\nmention this museum.\n\nTHE MYSTERY OF GARDENS\n\n[Photo by Mary Zahl]\n\nMary Zahl, the wife of Paul Zahl (see The Zahl File), is a renowned\n\ndesigner of gardens — serious, amazing gardens. She was kind enough\n\nto send along this report of a recent trip she made to Charleston, S.\n\nC., revisiting the place where her career and vocation as a garden\n\ndesigner got kicked into higher gear by a terrible natural disaster:\n\nLast week I was in Charleston, S. C., speaking on garden design to the\n\nCharleston Horticultural Society. It was my first 'official' return to\n\nthe garden scene there after leaving in 1992. In my talk, I was\n\nreflecting on twenty years of designing gardens, mostly residential.\n\nWhat was particularly apt about this timing was that it was in\n\nCharleston that my work in this field took a giant step forward, both\n\nin scope and volume. There was one reason why: Hurricane Hugo came\n\nthrough the Low Country on September 21, l989, leaving countless\n\ndevastated gardens that, in turn, became the jump-start for my career.\n\nHurricane Hugo was the only real disaster I have lived through. What\n\naffected me the most and lasted the longest was the sheer ugliness of\n\nit all: giant trees uprooted or snapped off, huge piles of debris for\n\nweeks on end, dried up places which had been shady and green, general\n\nchaos everywhere. Even the birds and butterflies disappeared. It was\n\ndepressing, and hard to summon the energy that was needed to put life\n\nback on track.\n\nBut, as my work meant bringing a little beauty and order into lives\n\nsurrounded by ugliness and disorder, my eyes were opened to the\n\nimportance of what I was doing. 'Garden design' became more than an\n\nend in itself; with a cleared and freshly planted garden, I saw hope\n\nreturn and anxiety decrease in those I was helping.\n\nBefore this experience, I had struggled with whether or not I was doing\n\nsomething 'important' with my work. I loved flowers, and loved being\n\nout in the garden, and even helping bring to life something that my\n\nclients could not do for themselves. But it felt like the icing on\n\nlife's more serious cake. Through this experience, I had a little\n\nwindow into the power of art/beauty to feed the soul.\n\n[Photo by Mary Zahl]\n\nIt still feeds mine, after all these years. Just strolling through\n\nthis garden of Frances and Milton Parker in Beaufort, S. C., last week\n\n(seen in the photos above) took my breath away with its serenity and creative energy, two apparent\n\nopposites. I wanted to sit — for hours if I could — and take it in.\n\nIt lives in my mind's eye, just as the paintings we saw this summer at\n\nThe Hermitage in St. Petersburg do.\n\nPaul and I were recently watching Warren Beatty's movie Reds. The\n\nstruggle of the main character, John Reed, was between his art as a\n\nwriter (Ten Days that Shook the World) and his passion to get\n\ninvolved in the political situation in Russia. His wife begged him to\n\nstay at home and help the revolution by being the writer/artist he was,\n\nbut he went abroad to be a part of the action. He died there at a\n\npremature age. I personally wish he had valued his art more.\n\nTHE FLYING SAUCER OF LOVE\n\nHere's a second report from Dr. Paul (of The Zahl File) on a strange place he went and a strange thing he saw on his travels this summer:\n\nFINNISH MODERN . . . EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE MARTIANS\n\nby Paul (“Famous Monsters”) Zahl\n\nLast month, my wife Mary and I led a group of friends into Helsinki's Rock Church, as it is now called in English. It is the Temppeliaukioin the Finnish language.\n\nThis\n\nis a Lutheran parish church not far from downtown that is now\n\ncelebrated as being one of the most innovative worship spaces in\n\nEurope. It was excavated and constructed in 1969 within a hill of rock\n\nand is now surrounded by a beautiful square of townhouses. The Rock\n\nChurch was designed by two brothers, Timo and Tuomo Suomalainen. It\n\nwas dubbed initially and locally as the “Anti-Devil Defense Bunker” but\n\nis now treasured and loved. It is a working church and the location for\n\nmany concerts, especially on its prized organ. When we walked in,\n\nSibelius's Violin Concerto was being played.\n\nBut I was interested in seeing the church for a somewhat different reason:\n\nIt looks just like a flying saucer. As a matter of fact, it could be a flying saucer.\n\nWhen\n\nyou look down on the Rock Church from the square above, it appears to\n\nbe a saucer of light bursting from the ground, or, conversely,\n\nembedding itself in the ground. It especially resembles the\n\nearth-craft touching down on Altair IV in Forbidden Planet, not to mention the Martian saucer in Invaders from Mars,\n\nand even more to the point, it is a lookalike for the saucers that\n\nhide beneath the sea and within the earth, in the odd Canadian move\n\nfrom 1977 entitled Starship Invasions.\n\nIn other words, this is the coolest church in Christendom. It requires a shout-out!\n\nCan\n\nwe stop and think for a sec about what the Rock Church is saying? It\n\nis saying there is something precious buried within a rockpile just\n\noutside the city. Whether the precious thing is coming out, bursting\n\nout; or whether it is burying itself, embedding itself in granite, is\n\nunclear. But it is definitely rooted in the earth. It could not be\n\nmore rooted.\n\nIs it preparing to be a “sleeper cell”, like the alien machines in the Steven Spielberg version of War of the Worlds? Or is it emerging from centuries of frozen sleep below the Arctic ice cap, as in The Atomic Submarine, from 1959? (Just so you know, ahem, The Criterion Collection has done up the\n\nlatter in a box set, together with three other classics related to it, like\n\nCorridors of Blood.)\n\nWhat is it doing in our midst? We don't know.\n\nBut there is something here. Whatever religion is\n\nor could be, it is embedded in the nature of things. It is not so\n\nhigh, quoting the Bible, that we can't reach up to it, nor is it so\n\nlow, that we can't reach down to it. But it is here, to be\n\ndiscovered within the nature of things. It is in the root of a man,\n\nand of the earth. The Rabbi Jeshua said, “The kingdom of God is within\n\nyou.” He did not spell out what he meant exactly. Many people have\n\nthought about this, and sought to fill in the blanks. Nobody knows for\n\nsure what he was intending. But whatever it is, it is here. It's an\n\nopen secret. “Take A Look Around” (Sergio Mendes and Brazil '66).\n\nIf\n\nyou see what is really here, what is in front of you and above you and\n\nbelow you, you're probably looking at it.\n\nWe can even get high-brow for a moment. Goethe has a beautiful passage in Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship in which he describes the nature of religion as understood within a utopian school for children. The children look up in order to express reverence. They look aroundin order to observe the natural world, their environment. And they look down in\n\norder “to recognize humility and poverty, mockery and despite, disgrace\n\nand wretchedness, suffering and death, to recognize these things as\n\ndivine; nay, even on sin and crime to look not as hindrances, but to\n\nhonor and love them as furtherances of what is holy.” [Photo by Mary Zahl]\n\nI think the lesson of the Rock Church, which is a world-class architectural site on account of its perfect resemblance to\n\nan alien flying saucer, is this: the truth is here, embedded in rock,\n\nunerodable through fashion or time, right in the marrow of the earth\n\nand hearts, digging in or breaking out, and filled, just filled, with\n\nlight.\n\nTWO PAINTINGS IN DISTANT PLACES\n\nI traveled a thousand miles north to Wyoming this summer, but mardecortesbaja contributor Paul Zahl (see The Zahl File) and his wife Mary ranged even further afield, leading a religious-themed tour to Russia. (Mary and Paul are personable folks, and Dr. Zahl is a widely respected scholar of religion, so they're much in demand for such tours.) Paul was kind enough to send some reports of his adventures, of which this is the first:\n\nEL GRECO IN THE TWILIGHT ZONE\n\nby Paul Zahl\n\nIn the movie Russian Ark there is a scene in which an\n\naristocratic French visitor to The Hermitage Museum at St. Petersburg\n\nlectures a young Russian of the early Nineteenth Century concerning a\n\npainting by El Greco (above.) So moved is the Marquis by this painting that he\n\nkneels in adoration before it. He explains to the young Russian that\n\nthe picture bears the image of the founders of Christianity, St. Peter\n\nand St. Paul. The scene in Russian Arkis moving and\n\nbeautiful.\n\nLast month, my wife and I took a group to see the very\n\npainting in person. It is in a room full of El Grecos, but it stands\n\nout for its warmth and the humility of one of the figures. The picture\n\nalso tells a story familiar to many: the tension between humility and\n\ngrace, represented by El Greco's depiction of St. Peter; and doctrine\n\nand the authority of the truth, represented by St. Paul.\n\nThe picture was painted by El Greco between 1587 and 1592. St.\n\nPeter is on the left, an old and humbled man of soft features and\n\ntenderness. You could approach him and tell him almost anything about\n\nyourself. He is somewhat sad, sympathetic, and modest. The observer\n\nhas to look very carefully to notice that Peter is carrying the key to\n\nthe kingdom in his left hand. But that is in shadow, almost obscured.\n\nSt. Paul, on the other hand, while not arrogant, is a person\n\npossessed of his Idea. With his left hand, his left fore-knuckle\n\nactually, he directs our attention to the Word, the Bible before him.\n\nWith his right hand, Paul reasons. His features are ascetic,\n\nconvinced, sincere, a little detached from persons, but possessed of\n\nhis Idea.\n\nEl Greco observes these two great men — I thought of\n\nRossellini's television movie entitled The Acts of the Apostles (above),\n\nwhich treats the same men in somewhat the same way — as two sides of\n\none thing, the Christian faith. There is even a kind of yellow barrier\n\nbetween them in the painting, emphasizing their difference.\n\nMy wife immediately noticed the doctrinal character of the St.\n\nPaul, his cerebral, reasoning attitude. It is unmistakable. He is\n\nreasoning with the viewer, on the basis of a written text. St. Peter,\n\non the other hand, is 'reasoning' with us on the basis of a shattered\n\nwisdom, what Dostoevsky called the 'strongest instrument, the humility\n\nof humbled love'. (I know it is pretentious to quote Dostoevsky, but\n\nhis words are apt just the same.)\n\nThere are few visitors today to this painting by El Greco who do\n\nnot identify with Peter at the expense of Paul.\n\nBut wait, There's something else:\n\nA week later, Mary and I were in the National Gallery of\n\nStockholm, and there it was (good God!) — the same painting, by the same\n\nartist, in a room also full of El Grecos. But it was different. The\n\npainting had the same subject, composed the same way, with the same\n\ncolors, but something was . . . well, wildly different.\n\nSomething had happened to St. Paul. He had lost weight, his\n\nfeatures were pinched, and his hair . . . it was a mess. It was uncombed — what little there was of it was all\n\nover the place.\n\nWhat came to my mind was the episode of\n\nThriller,\n\nthe old Boris Karloff television series, entitled “The Cheaters”. At\n\nthe end of the episode, a selfish man begins to see himself, through\n\ncursed spectacles, as he really is. The makeup artist, Jack Barron,\n\nfirst shows the man losing his hair and looking himself but bewildered.\n\nThen we see the man grinning diabolically, with hideous scars on his\n\nface and just a few tufts of hair. Finally, we see the man become a\n\nsort of demon from hell, to which he is soon dragged by the very devil\n\nhimself. Fun little episode for schoolboys on a Monday night at nine\n\nway back then.\n\nThe comparison seems right, however. What has happened to St.\n\nPaul? His convinced, convicted authority in the Hermitage\n\nversion has become transformed into a sort of 'wild man',\n\n'I-just-came-out-of-the-forest-with-Robinson-Crusoe' persona. The\n\nApostle has entered the Twilight Zone but hasn't come back. Or he is\n\nlike the character in a Stephen King story, who is awakened too soon\n\nfrom a forty-billion-mile journey to a distant planet. Everything's\n\nright but everything's wrong.\n\nI have looked up the Stockholm version of “St. Peter and St.\n\nPaul” and found nothing on this weird difference. I can't believe it\n\nhas gone unnoticed. But it is disturbing.\n\nA final thought on El Greco's two St. Pauls. The kind of\n\ndoctrinal Christianity embodied by the Hermitage Paul, text-weighted\n\nand cerebral, is superannuated. You see it today and you run. The\n\npainter seems to have understood this instinctively. His later St.\n\nPaul has sort of gone crazy. “Grandfather, we need to get you to the\n\nhospital.” This Paul is not Diogenes, an old man of self-contained\n\nde-constructing wisdom. He is a street-crazy — maybe inspired, like the\n\nhomeless man in Ordet, who has faith enough to raise the dead,\n\nbut you wouldn't take your child to him for a blessing.\n\nOr, maybe he\n\nis “The Howling Man”, of\n\nThe Twilight Zone (above), who is in fact no longer\n\nbenign at all.\n\nI don't know which of these two possibilities is the Stockholm\n\nSt. Paul. But if the Stockholm Paul is the confessional Protestant of the two,\n\nSt. Peter is looking pretty good by comparison. And wasn't Senator Kennedy a good\n\nadvertisement for that side of the enterprise? [Editor's Note: Paul has elaborated Mary's insight about the portrait of St. Paul into a very provocative meditation. St. Paul wrote some of the greatest and most radical spiritual treatises of\n\nall time, and they were a cry from the heart against law as a spiritual tool — but what he wrote was still theology, and all theology seems to have a\n\ntendency to decompose into law, to be parsed for “rules” which can be\n\nused to oppress instead of bless. A spooky thought occurred to me while reading Paul Zahl's piece — maybe the Stockholm portrait of St. Paul was once an exact copy of the\n\none in the Hermitage and has decomposed over time, like the portrait of\n\nDorian Gray, reflecting the historical misuse of St. Paul's letters. The\n\nTwilight Zone, indeed!]"
