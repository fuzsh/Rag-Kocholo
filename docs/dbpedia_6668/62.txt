Bill Owen and Leslie Dwyer are a couple of dust men -- trash collectors for the Americans -- who are given a book as a reward by an old lady. As soon as it vanishes, up pops an American who claims he's willing to pay five thousand pounds for an American collector. And so round it goes.

Directed by Maclean Rogers, he had directed an earlier version of this in 1936, starring the author of the piece, Wally Patch. The title may proclaim otherwise, but the situations, jokes, and performances are moldering, and Rogers is not the director to pull anything fresh out of anything. With Joy Nichol, Bill Shine, Dandy Nichols, and Tony Quinn.
