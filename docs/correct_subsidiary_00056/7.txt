Xoom

Xoom offers international transfers which can be sent around the world, to bank accounts or for cash collection through an agent network. In some countries you can even have cash delivered to your recipient‚Äôs door.

Xoom‚Äôs ability to send payments for cash collection makes this an attractive service for people who need to get money to someone without access to a bank account, supplementing PayPal‚Äôs other peer to peer payment services.

Zettle ‚Äî which was previously called iZettle ‚Äî offers payment solutions for ecommerce and physical sellers across a range of European countries.

Simility

Simility services include merchant solutions to stop fraud while giving good customers a better experience when shopping online. There are also solutions for financial service organizations looking to detect and reduce fraud.

As a giant in ecommerce and online transactions, it makes sense for PayPal to take an interest in a company offering products to make ecommerce safer ‚Äî building the capabilities of both PayPal and Simility at the same time.

Chargehound

Chargehound lets merchants reduce chargeback fraud by automating online dispute processes. Services are mainly automated but more complex cases can be reviewed manually, which allows companies to save time on straightforward disputes while resolving more complex ones with a human touch.

PayPal‚Äôs decision here reflects the fact that ecommerce sales are continuing to grow, but merchants need to protect their margins to remain competitive ‚Äî something reducing fraud can help with.

Happy Returns

Happy Returns offers an easy return process for customers shopping online which can also save companies money. Customers can take unwanted items to a network of Return Bars ‚Äî physical locations where returns are aggregated and passed back to merchants.

PayPal merchants can offer Happy Returns as a return option for free, allowing them to compete against large ecommerce sites which offer their own physical return points.
