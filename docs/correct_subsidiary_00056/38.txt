Who Runs eBay at the Moment?

The CEO of eBay is Jamie Iannone, which took up the position in April 2020 from Devin Wenig. Before joining eBay, Jamie was the CDO (Chief Digital Officer) at Walmart. His work involved overseeing the company’s eCommerce business, but he also had initial experience in different leadership positions at other eCommerce and technology companies — for example, Digital Products, Barnes & Noble, and SamsClub.com.

What is eBay’s Original Story?

eBay’s story started in 1995 when Pierre Omidyar, the founder, established AuctionWeb, an online auction platform. Pierre, a computer programmer, was passionate and committed to building an online marketplace that would allow people to purchase and sell products to one another directly. The most attractive thing about his idea was that it wouldn’t require intermediaries, as is the case with auction houses and traditional retailers.

When Pierre launched AuctionWeb, it was a small website he operated from his computer. But it evolved fast and attracted more users who started purchasing and selling goods. Pierre adopted the name eBay in 1996 because it was more marketable and memorable.

As eBay continued to grow, Omidyar knew that he needed to hire more staff to cope with the site’s rising demands. He brought on Meg Whitman as CEO in 1998. And eBay went public under her leadership the following year. This feat made it one of the most successful initial public offerings (IPOs) in history at the time.

eBay’s growth hasn’t slowed since then. In fact, it has surpassed its initial plan on online auctions, which has steered it into becoming a fully-developed eCommerce platform. You can buy and sell different types of products ranging from electronics, cars, fashion, and even real estate.

How did Pierre Omidyar Establish eBay?

Pierre Omidyar established eBay in 1995 by building a website. He named it AuctionWeb. During this phase, he relied on his impeccable computer programming skills. Peter had a background in computer science, had previously worked for Apple, and developed software for the Macintosh.

Peter started the site as a personal project and put a broken laser pointer up for auction as a test. You may not believe this, but the laser pointer sold for $14.83 to a collector of broken laser pointers! And this first sale laid the foundation to form eBay.

The company started expanding beyond its initial focus on auctions to include fixed-price listings and other e-commerce features. eBay went public in 1998, and its success transformed Peter into a billionaire and a distinguished figure in the tech industry.
