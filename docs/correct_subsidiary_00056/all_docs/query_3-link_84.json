Consumers can apply online for the PayPal Extras MasterCard® or the eBay MasterCard®.\n\n“We are pleased to deepen our relationship with these dynamic businesses and continue to meet the evolving needs of PayPal and eBay cardholders for convenient and safe payment solutions and valuable rewards,” said Tom Quindlen, executive vice president and CEO, Retail Cards, Synchrony Financial. “PayPal is at the forefront of digital payments and we look forward to building on our decade of adding greater value and simplicity to cardholder transactions.”\n\nIn addition to exclusive offers, PayPal Extras and eBay MasterCard cardholders are automatically enrolled in program rewards and can earn points for purchases, including the opportunity to build rewards faster for every dollar spent on eBay and PayPal, and at gas stations and restaurants. For added convenience, all accounts are automatically integrated with the PayPal Wallet, which provides access to a suite of applications and tools that simplify checkout and include available special financing options for shoppers with participating merchants.\n\n“The PayPal credit card program helps to drive sales for merchants and adds greater purchasing power and rewards for customers,” said Steve Allocca, Vice President and General Manager, PayPal Credit. “Synchrony has a deep understanding of the industry and shares our customer focus and commitment to payments innovation.”\n\nSynchrony Financial works with retailers to provide credit and loyalty programs and account management solutions for their customers. The PayPal Smart Connect account is issued by Synchrony Bank. Each chip-enabled PayPal Extras MasterCard® and eBay MasterCard® account has no annual fee, and is issued by Synchrony Bank pursuant to a license by MasterCard International Incorporated.\n\n###\n\n*Subject to Terms and Conditions\n\nAbout PayPal\n\nAt PayPal, we put people at the center of everything we do.
