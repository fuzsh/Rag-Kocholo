        "text": "Why did eBay decide to buy PayPal? In 2002, eBay acquired the payment platform Paypal for a total value of $1,500,000,000. The acquisition made perfect sense as more than 70% of eBay auctions accepted PayPal payments. In addition, 25% of auctions paid via PayPal. eBay wanted to simplify online buying/selling, and integrating a payment platform in their company would facilitate that. Why was this acquisition so interesting? eBay didn’t pay a single dime for PayPal. Yes, you heard me right, no money exchanged hands to complete the purchase of PayPal. How is it even possible? eBay acquired all of the outstanding shares of PayPal in a tax-free, stock-for-stock transaction using a fixed exchange ratio of 0.39 eBay shares for each PayPal share. eBay did not pay any money for the deal, as their shares paid for it. The true beauty of this deal is that it clearly outlines how companies can create solutions to complete business acquisitions without relying on cash. Believe it or not, you can do this even with small companies, not only huge publicly listed entities. Creativity is key. Want to learn more about it?
