It wasa wild west and PayPal was one of the first payment solutions to try and civilise it.\n\nPayPal was formed when two companies, Confinity and X.com, merged. Elon Musk, of Tesla and SpaceX fame, was CEO of this combined company for a time. As he would in the future, he zoned in on the vision of PayPal’s future and terminated all other operations that were deemed unnecessary.\n\nThat didn’t go down well with PayPal’s board members, who got rid of Musk in October 2000. He had been CEO for less than 12 months. The lack of faith from the board would sit with Musk during his next ventures, where he ensured he had complete control.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAfter Musk left, Peter Thiel took over as CEO as guided PayPal towards its 2002 IPO. PayPal provided its platform to all websites, but the bulk of its transactions were conducted on eBay. A few months after the IPO, eBay agreed to acquire PayPal for $1.5 billion.\n\nFor the next decade, PayPal coexisted inside eBay’s rather tumultuous world, in which the e-commerce platform tried to expand into every internet business, acquiring Skype and a range of classified advertising networks.\n\nIn that time, PayPal spent $800 million to acquire Braintree and Venmo, bolstering its position as a provider of financial services. And as eBay started to feel the effects of a decade of muddled leadership, PayPal looked at a future beyond the e-commerce platform, but first it would need to separate.\n\nIn 2015, eBay announced it would spin out PayPal as a separate entity. Several major eBay shareholders pushed for the split, as they had with the Skype sale in 2009. eBay held a minority stake in the new company, but has since divested almost all shares in the company.\n\nPayPal missed many opportunities that came with a growing network of e-commerce platforms struggling to make payments safe and secure. If not tied to eBay, PayPal may have partnered with Amazon, Alibaba and retail giants like Walmart, but platforms either built their own solution or partnered with non-competitive affiliates.\n\nIf separate, it may have also been more influential in the growth of contactless payments. Google and Apple both built out their own systems, and PayPal has been effectively shut out of that market.\n\nStill, PayPal has grown significantly since the break, almost doubling revenue and monthly active users. It has integrated One Touch with over seven million merchants and Venmo continues to attract a younger generation of users.\n\nPayPal has also made significant acquisitions in the past two years, in the form of iZettle and Honey, bought for $2.2 billion and $4 billion, respectively. It has also launched PayPal Credit.\n\nIn 2021, it launched a new “Super-app”, combining payments, savings, bills, crypto, shopping, and other financial items into one single experience. The app is part of PayPal’s attempt to branch out from its payments platform and make users more sticky.\n\nWe have collected data and statistics on PayPal.
