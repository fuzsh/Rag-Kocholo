        "text": "You must complete a 5-10 minute online questionnaire to determine your business’s eligibility. Your application may take longer to complete if your identity cannot be automatically verified.\n\nOnce the questionnaire is complete, estimated loan terms can be customized by adjusting the loan amount and duration to compare the costs of financing.\n\nOnce you select your desired terms and complete your application, if approved, you will be prompted to electronically sign a contract including bank instructions so that payments can be debited weekly from your business checking account.\n\nPayPal Business Loan has weekly payments that are withdrawn from your business's bank account automatically. You provide account information and select your preferred payment day when you sign the loan contract. Automatic repayment will occur weekly on a day you choose. You won’t be able to adjust how often a payment is made.\n\nYes, you can make a one-time payment or even pay your loan in full using your business’s bank account. There is no early repayment fee. Simply, login to your PayPal Business Loan portal account and select the “One-Time Payment” tab from the top menu to set up your payment.\n\nYou can set up a one-time payment using your existing repayment business bank account linked with your PayPal Business Loan account or alternatively you can also add a new business bank account to make a one-time payment."
