Form 13-Fs, which institutions must file to report their holdings, are due 45 days after the end of calendar quarters, and have now come in from 1Q24. We like to review the 13Fs of the major activist investors, including Carl Icahn, Trian Fund Management, Jana Partners, and ValueAct Holdings, among others, to determine their core holdings and new purchases. Activist investing has evolved in recent years and is now less about generating a short-term return on an underpriced stock and more about achieving long-term returns through an active management/investor partnership. Activists have made progress in the past year with high-profile investments into blue-chip companies such as Fedex and Union Pacific. According to Vickers, here are recent new purchases and key holdings of activist investors and other high-profile money managers such as Warren Buffet of Berkshire Hathaway and Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors LLC.\n\nPeople Also Watch\n\nSQ Block, Inc.\n\n68.10\n\n+0.15%\n\nSHOP Shopify Inc.\n\n63.16\n\n+0.08%\n\nV Visa Inc.\n\n265.46\n\n-1.37%\n\nCRM Salesforce, Inc.\n\n247.63\n\n+0.11%\n\nBABA Alibaba Group Holding Limited\n\n75.27\n\n-1.66%\n\nMA Mastercard Incorporated\n\n443.69\n\n-1.12%\n\nZM Zoom Video Communications, Inc.\n\n58.87\n\n-0.47%\n\nNVDA NVIDIA Corporation\n\n117.93\n\n-2.61%\n\nADBE Adobe Inc.\n\n551.00\n\n-1.05%\n\nPLTR Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\n28.58\n\n-0.21%\n\nABNB Airbnb, Inc.\n\n147.99\n\n+0.76%\n\nROKU Roku, Inc.\n\n62.55\n\n-0.35%\n\nUBER Uber Technologies, Inc.\n\n67.31\n\n+1.58%\n\nCRWD CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\n\n304.96\n\n-11.10%\n\nAMD Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\n151.58\n\n-2.69%\n\nSNOW Snowflake Inc.\n\n129.85\n\n+0.01%"
