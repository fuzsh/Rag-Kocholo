        "text": "Xoom at PayPal: A deep-dive into the brand inside the payments giant, and why it might sell\n\nPayPal is reportedly looking to sell remittance player Xoom, but how has it handled the company since it acquired it eight years ago, and how does Xoom stand in the market?\n\nLast week, reports broke that PayPal was looking to sell its remittance arm Xoom amid increasing pressure from activist investor Elliott Management. This would see the company sell a brand that it first acquired in 2015, back when Xoom itself was a publicly traded company. Then, PayPal paid $890m for Xoom.\n\nAlthough not yet confirmed by the payments and ecommerce giant, the move comes just a month after the retirement of former Xoom CEO John Kunze, who has continued to play a role at Xoom as a PayPal brand over the last eight years.\n\nHowever, it appears to have been some time since Xoom saw notable investment from its parent company. With the exception of a single announcement in January of this year about the extension of Visa Direct support for Xoom, the company has not announced any new features or been mentioned on a PayPal earnings call since 2020. Its social media accounts have also remained dormant since 2021.\n\nDespite this, the company remains a relatively strong player and, with the right investment, could prove a key challenger as both long-established and newer players grapple with the ongoing digitisation of the remittance market. But where does it sit, and how has it diverged from PayPal’s other offerings? We take a look in this detailed report.\n\nTopics covered:\n\nXoom before the acquisition\n\nXoom since PayPal\n\nPayPal since Xoom\n\nPayPal’s lack of investment in Xoom\n\nXoom’s position in the remittance market\n\nXoom’s pricing versus competitors\n\nXoom’s potential as a standalone player\n\nLucy is Head of Content & Editor-in-Chief at FXC Intelligence, overseeing all content and taking deep dives into the trends and data driving changes in payments.
