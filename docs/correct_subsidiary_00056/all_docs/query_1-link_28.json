Or YouTube. Or SpaceX, LinkedIn, and Yelp.\n\nThe payments company — launched as Confinity in 1998 by Peter Thiel, Max Levchin, and Luke Nosek — grew to become a Silicon Valley giant. It was acquired by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion in a deal that altered Silicon Valley history and helped spawn the careers of some of tech's most famous names.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers.

Its software helps other companies and agencies like law enforcement find patterns in large swaths of data.\n\nHow it's related to PayPal: Thiel founded Palantir after PayPal's sale to eBay, and the idea for the company was born out of Thiel's experience dealing with credit card fraud at PayPal.\n\nJoe Lonsdale, who worked as a finance intern at PayPal while still in college at Stanford University, is also a Palantir cofounder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAffirm was launched by Max Levchin, a PayPal cofounder.\n\nWhen it was founded: 2013\n\nWhat it does: Affirm offers instant lines of credit to customers shopping online, allowing them to buy a product and pay for it over time. The company raised a $500 million Series G round last month.\n\nHow it's related to PayPal: Affirm is the brainchild of Max Levchin, one of the original PayPal founders. The company launched out of Levchin's startup incubator, HVF — Levchin took over as CEO in 2014.\n\nLevchin founded the company along with a team that includes Nathan Gettings, who also cofounded Palantir.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFertility tracking company Glow was also born out of Levchin's startup incubator.\n\nWhen it was founded: 2013\n\nWhat it does: Glow makes a family of apps that use data science to help track periods, ovulation, fertility, pregnancy, and children's' growth.\n\nHow it's related to PayPal: Glow was also founded in Levchin's HVF startup incubator, and Levchin now serves as executive chairman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYouTube's founders worked together at PayPal during the early days.\n\nWhen it was founded: 2005\n\nWhat it does: YouTube is a platform for hosting and sharing videos. It was sold to Google in November 2006.\n\nHow it's related to PayPal: Founders Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim were all early employees at PayPal.\n\nWhen PayPal sold to eBay for $1.5 billion, it sparked a \"healthy competition\" among the company's alumni, early YouTube investor Roelof Botha told Business Insider earlier this year. When it came time for YouTube to sell, the team intentionally chose a price of $1.65 billion — 10% more than what eBay sold for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElon Musk founded SpaceX after working at PayPal.\n\nWhen it was founded: 2002\n\nWhat it does: The goal of SpaceX, short for Space Exploration Technologies, is to make space flight cheaper and eventually colonize Mars.\n\nHow it's related to PayPal: In 1999, Musk launched an online banking company called X.com. That company merged with Thiel's Confinity in 2000, then became PayPal in 2001. Musk was briefly PayPal CEO before being replaced by Thiel. But when PayPal sold, Musk netted $165 million from the deal, which he used to start SpaceX.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk was an early investor in and cofounder of Tesla.\n\nWhen it was founded: 2003\n\nWhat it does: Tesla manufactures electric vehicles, batteries, and solar panels.\n\nHow it's related to PayPal: Musk was an early Tesla investor and cofounder. He became CEO in 2008.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk launched The Boring Company after becoming irritated by Los Angeles traffic.\n\nWhen it was founded: 2016\n\nWhat it does: The Boring Company builds underground tunnels with the intention of housing high-speed transit systems to reduce traffic in cities.\n\nHow it's related to PayPal: Musk initially proposed The Boring Company in a white paper in 2013 and launched the company three years later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk also created OpenAI and Neuralink.\n\nWhen they were founded: 2015 and 2016, respectively\n\nWhat it does: OpenAI is an artificial intelligence research lab, while Neuralink's goal is to make computers that can be implanted in people's brains.\n\nHow it's related to PayPal: Musk founded both companies to fight against what he sees as the dangers of AI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLinkedIn was founded by early PayPal exec Reid Hoffman.\n\nWhen it was founded: 2002\n\nWhat it does: LinkedIn is a social network for professionals.\n\nHow it's related to PayPal: Hoffman was an executive vice president at PayPal in its early days.
