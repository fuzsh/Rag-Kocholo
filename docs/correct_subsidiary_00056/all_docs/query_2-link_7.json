        "text": "Saeed Al Hasan, PMP\n\nSaeed Al Hasan, PMP\n\nChallenge Limits With AI | Govt Initiatives & Smart Solutions | We’re Hiring!\n\nPublished Jul 22, 2023\n\nThe eBay business model revolves around a marketplace where buyers can bid on items or purchase them directly from sellers. eBay is an online marketplace that allows people to buy and sell goods. The company was founded in 1995 and has since grown to become one of the world’s largest e-commerce platforms, with millions of users in over 190 countries.\n\nIn addition to its marketplace, eBay also offers other services to its users, such as payment processing, financing, and advertising. The company makes money through various revenue streams, including fees from sellers, advertising, and partnerships with other companies. eBay has a diverse customer base, including individuals and businesses of all sizes.\n\nThe company also has partnerships with various retailers and technology companies to expand its reach and offerings. eBay faces competition from other online marketplaces, such as Amazon and Alibaba, as well as traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. Despite this, eBay has continued to grow and evolve its business model to stay competitive in the e-commerce market.\n\nA brief history of eBay and The Reason Behind Their Success\n\neBay was founded in 1995 by Pierre Omidyar, a French-born computer programmer. The company’s initial goal was to create a platform where individuals could buy and sell items to each other directly. However, Omidyar quickly realized that the real potential of the platform was in its ability to facilitate auctions. This allowed people to bid on items, driving up their prices and giving sellers the opportunity to earn more money for their goods.\n\neBay’s unique business model proved to be incredibly successful. By 1997, the company had over one million registered users, and it continued to grow at an impressive rate. In 1998, eBay went public and became a publicly-traded company.\n\nOne of the key reasons behind eBay’s success was its low fees. Unlike traditional brick-and-mortar auction houses, which often charge high commissions, eBay only charges a small fee for each listing. This made it an attractive option for both buyers and sellers. Additionally, eBay’s online platform made it easy for people to search for and bid on items, even if they were located far away from the seller.\n\nAnother reason behind eBay’s success was the way it embraced the internet and leveraged its capabilities. By allowing sellers to list their items online and enabling buyers to bid on them, eBay created an efficient and accessible marketplace that appealed to a wide range of users.\n\nIn the early 2000s, eBay expanded its business by acquiring a number of other companies. In 2002, the company acquired PayPal, a popular online payment platform, which allowed eBay users to easily and securely make payments for their purchases. In 2005, eBay acquired Skype, a popular internet-based communication platform that allowed users to communicate with each other in real time. These acquisitions helped to strengthen eBay’s position as a market leader and further enhanced its appeal to users.\n\nToday, eBay is one of the largest and most successful online marketplaces in the world. With over 182 million active users and millions of items listed for sale, it remains a popular destination for both buyers and sellers. While the company continues to face competition from other online marketplaces, its unique business model and strong brand recognition have helped it to maintain its position as a leader in the industry.\n\nWho Owns eBay\n\neBay is now a publicly-owned company, with the majority of its shares held by mutual fund holders at 49.23%. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest institutional shareholder with a 10.77% stake, followed by BlackRock Fund Advisors with 5%. Individual stakeholders own 11.33% of eBay, while other institutional holders own the remaining 39.83%.\n\neBay Mission Statement\n\neBay’s mission statement is “to provide a global online marketplace where practically anyone can trade practically anything, enabling economic opportunity around the world.”\n\nHow eBay makes money\n\neBay makes money through the fees that it charges users for listing and selling items on its platform. It also generates revenue from advertising and through its payment processing services. Additionally, eBay has a growing e-commerce business that allows it to sell products directly to consumers. These various streams of revenue allow eBay to continue to grow and expand its business.\n\nCategorically, eBay makes money in these ways:\n\nFees from listing and selling items on the platform;\n\nAdvertising fees from eBay’s marketing services;\n\nRevenue from subsidiaries*.\n\n*While PayPal can be considered a subsidiary of eBay, the company decided on September 30, 2014, to “spin off PayPal into a separate publicly traded company.”\n\nA few other ways that eBay makes money, as well as a breakdown of the above categories, are given below:\n\nListing fees: eBay charges sellers a fee to list their items for sale;\n\nFinal value fees: eBay collects a percentage of the final sale price when an item sells;\n\nPromoted listings: eBay charges sellers an additional fee to have their listings appear higher in search results and other prominent locations on the site;\n\neBay Plus subscription: eBay offers a paid subscription service called eBay Plus, which provides customers with additional benefits such as free shipping and exclusive deals;\n\nAdvertising: eBay generates revenue through the display of product ads leading to external online retail websites;\n\nStubHub: eBay owns the online ticket marketplace StubHub, which makes money through listing and transaction fees;\n\nOther ventures: eBay also generates revenue through its investments in and partnerships with other companies.\n\nFees from listing and selling items on the platform\n\neBay makes money from fees charged to users for listing and selling items on its platform. These fees are typically a percentage of the final sale price and vary depending on the item’s category and the seller’s status on the platform. For example, a standard seller may be charged a 10% fee for selling a piece of clothing, while a power seller (a high-volume seller with a good reputation on the platform) may be charged a lower fee of 6%. These fees provide a significant source of revenue for eBay.\n\nAdvertising fees from eBay’s marketing services\n\neBay makes money from advertising fees by charging advertisers for the ability to promote their products on eBay’s platform. This allows advertisers to reach a large audience of potential customers who are actively using eBay to search for and buy products. When a user clicks on an advertiser’s ad, the advertiser is charged a fee, which generates revenue for eBay. Additionally, eBay may offer additional marketing services, such as featured listing placements or promotional emails, for which advertisers can pay additional fees.\n\nRevenue from subsidiaries\n\neBay makes money from its subsidiaries, such as StubHub, by earning a portion of the revenue generated by these businesses. StubHub is an online ticket marketplace that allows users to buy and sell tickets for sports, music, and other live events. When a user buys a ticket on StubHub, the company charges a fee for its services. This fee generates revenue for StubHub, and since eBay owns StubHub, a portion of that revenue goes to eBay as well. In this way, eBay can generate additional revenue by leveraging the success of its subsidiary companies.\n\neBay Customer Segments\n\neBay’s customer segments consist of:\n\nBuyers: These are individuals or businesses that use eBay’s platform to purchase goods from sellers;\n\nSellers: These are individuals or businesses that use eBay’s platform to sell goods to buyers;\n\nAdvertisers: These are businesses that use eBay’s platform to promote their products to a large audience of potential customers.

This can lead to customer dissatisfaction and damage eBay’s reputation;\n\nLimited control over pricing: Since eBay’s platform is an open marketplace, sellers are free to set their own prices for the goods they offer. This means that eBay has limited control over pricing and may be unable to offer the lowest prices for certain products;\n\nReputation for low-quality goods: In the past, eBay has been associated with low-quality goods and counterfeit items, which can damage its reputation and make it less appealing to buyers;\n\nChallenges in managing subsidiaries: eBay owns a number of subsidiaries, such as StubHub, which can add complexity to the company’s operations and make it difficult to achieve synergies and efficiencies.\n\neBay Opportunities\n\nExpansion into new markets: eBay has a strong presence in many markets around the world, but there are still many potential markets where the company could expand. For example, eBay could look to enter emerging markets with large and growing populations, such as India and Indonesia, or expand its presence in existing markets by offering new products or services;\n\nExpansion into new product categories: eBay offers a wide variety of goods, but there are still many product categories where the company could expand. For example, eBay could look to offer more services, such as home cleaning or appliance repair, or expand into new areas, such as groceries or home furnishings;\n\nPartnerships and collaborations: eBay could look to partner with other companies or organizations to expand its reach and offer new products or services. For example, eBay could partner with retail chains to offer in-store pickup for online orders, or collaborate with manufacturers to offer exclusive products or discounts;\n\nSubsidiaries and acquisitions: eBay could look to grow through acquisitions or the expansion of its existing subsidiaries. For example, the company could acquire other online marketplaces or e-commerce platforms to expand its reach, or invest in its subsidiaries, such as StubHub, to grow those businesses.\n\neBay Threats\n\nIntense competition: eBay faces intense competition from other online marketplaces and e-commerce platforms, which can make it difficult for the company to differentiate itself and maintain its market share. These competitors may have competitive advantages in areas such as product selection, pricing, delivery speed, or customer service, which can make it difficult for eBay to compete;\n\nChanges in consumer behavior: The e-commerce industry is rapidly evolving, and consumer behavior is constantly changing. If consumers shift away from using online marketplaces like eBay in favor of other shopping channels or platforms, eBay’s business could be adversely affected;\n\nEconomic downturns: Economic downturns can lead to reduced consumer spending, which can impact eBay’s business. If consumers are more cautious about their spending during an economic downturn, they may be less likely to buy and sell goods on eBay’s platform, which could impact the company’s revenue and growth;\n\nReputation and trust: eBay’s reputation and the trust of its users are crucial to the company’s success. If eBay fails to protect its users’ personal information, resolve disputes effectively, or prevent the sale of counterfeit or low-quality goods, its reputation could be damaged, and users may be less likely to use the platform;\n\nRegulatory risks: As a large and influential company, eBay is subject to regulatory scrutiny and may face fines or other penalties if it fails to comply with relevant laws and regulations. This can be a significant risk for the company and can damage its reputation.\n\nConclusion\n\neBay is a successful online marketplace that allows buyers and sellers to easily connect and conduct transactions. The company’s business model is based on generating revenue through fees charged to sellers and advertisers, and it also leverages its subsidiaries to generate additional revenue. eBay has strengths, such as a large and active user base, but it also faces competition and regulatory risks. The company has opportunities for growth, such as expansion into new markets and product categories, but it must also address threats to maintain its success.\n\n#productmanagement #productmanager #strategy #mision #vision #itconsulting #business #ai #chatgpt #machinelearning #ml #saudiarabia #dubai #startups #saas #projectmanager #seniorproductmanager #portfoliomanagement #consultants #businessdevelopment #chatbot\n\nHelp improve contributions\n\nMark contributions as unhelpful if you find them irrelevant or not valuable to the article.
