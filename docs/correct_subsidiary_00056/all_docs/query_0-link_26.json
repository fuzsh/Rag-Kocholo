        "text": "The relationship between PayPal and eBay shaped the way online transactions have been handled for years on this platform. But as online commerce evolved, so did the dynamics between these two giants; though that left some of us confused, asking Can you still use PayPal on eBay?\n\nThis article traces the journey of eBay and PayPal, from their integration to their eventual business separation, and how this has impacted both sellers and buyers. With the recent inclusion of Adyen, eBay’s payment landscape is set for another transformative phase.\n\nWant to streamline your eBay bookkeeping? Learn what ecommerce financial management software can do for you!\n\nContents:\n\n1. What happened to PayPal and eBay\n\n2. PayPal on eBay for sellers\n\neBay’s Managed Payments for sellers\n\nA step-by-step guide to Managed Payments\n\n3. How to get detailed transaction data from your eBay account to your accounting software\n\n4. PayPal on eBay for buyers\n\nWhat payment methods does eBay offer buyers?\n\nWhat happened to PayPal and eBay\n\nPayPal and eBay had a long-standing relationship that underwent several significant changes over the years. Let’s look at the major shifts in cooperation and where those companies stand today.\n\nAcquisition of PayPal\n\nIn 2002 eBay acquired PayPal, but at the time PayPal had already established itself as the preferred payment method for many eBay users and sellers. The acquisition aimed to streamline the buying and selling process on eBay.\n\nFor several years after the acquisition, PayPal was heavily promoted as the primary payment method on the platform. It provided a safe and efficient way for buyers and sellers to transact, especially in the early days of online commerce when trust was a significant concern.\n\neBay and PayPal business split\n\nIn 2015, eBay spun off PayPal into a separate publicly traded company. While they became independent companies, they maintained a close business relationship, with PayPal continuing to be a primary payment option for eBay transactions.\n\nTransition to Adyen\n\neBay announced in 2020 that it would transition to a new primary payment processor, Adyen, an Amsterdam-based payment company. Adyen is a backend payment service whose portfolio includes big names like Uber, Netflix, and Spotify. Unlike PayPal, Adyen doesn’t have a distinct presence on eBay checkout. In other words, you don’t see a pay button named Adyen as they manage eBay’s payments on the backend rather than the frontend.\n\nThe transition was part of eBay’s strategy to improve user experience by intermediating payments on its platform, which would give eBay more control over the transaction process and a smoother checkout experience for the users. The transition period ended in July 2023, which means all payments are now managed on the backend by Adyen.\n\nDoes that mean there’s no PayPal on eBay anymore? We’re about to find out.\n\nPayPal on eBay for sellers\n\nTraditionally, if you were a seller on eBay, all your payout would be made to your PayPal account and then transferred to your bank account, but since the transition to Adyen hapenned, that’s no longer possible. What’s more, there was a button to integrate your eBay account with your PayPal account – that’s also gone, so essentially, from a seller’s point of view, a PayPal account isn’t part of business operations anymore. What you’ll find instead is eBay’s new integrated system: eBay Managed Payments.\n\neBay’s Managed Payments for sellers\n\neBay’s Managed Payments system represents the company’s shift towards handling the end-to-end payment process on its platform. Instead of relying primarily on PayPal or other external payment gateways, eBay’s Managed Payments offers a more integrated transaction experience.\n\nA step-by-step guide to Managed Payments\n\nStep 1. Sellers need to register for Managed Payments at the setup stage (it’s a mandatory requirement). During registration, sellers provide details like a bank account for payouts and information for identity verification. eBay provides sellers with a centralized dashboard that includes sales, fees, and payouts, making it easier to track and manage their business regardless of the payment solution chosen by the buyers – all transactions can be found on a single dashboard.\n\nStep 2. Once registered, sellers can list items as they usually would. When a buyer makes a purchase, they choose from the payment methods provided, and eBay processes the transaction. For international sales, eBay manages currency conversion, making it easier for sellers to reach a global audience without the complexity of handling multiple currencies.\n\nStep 3. After a successful transaction, eBay processes the payment and holds the funds. There’s no need for sellers to log into another platform (like their PayPal account) to manage or transfer their money. eBay directly deposits the funds into the seller’s bank account, typically within 2 business days of payment confirmation, depending on the seller’s payout schedule.\n\nAdditional information. Instead of paying separate eBay fees for listings and PayPal fees for payments, sellers are charged a single fee by eBay that covers both the listing and the payment processing.\n\nWith Managed Payments, refund and claim processes are handled directly within eBay, simplifying the resolution process.\n\nDon’t have an eBay store but thinking of opening one?

You can still easily pay with PayPal or PayPal Credit for goods purchased on eBay. And that’s absolutely correct – the major shift to Adyen doesn’t delete PayPal as a payment option for buyers.\n\nWhat payment methods does eBay offer buyers?\n\nAdyen, as a backend payment software, can support over 300 different payment methods (PayPal included). eBay selected the payment solutions that they wish to offer to their customers, and they include:\n\nCredit card;\n\nDebit card;\n\nApple Pay;\n\nGoogle Pay;\n\nPayPal;\n\nPayPal Credit.\n\nIn addition to these primary payment methods, depending on the category and country of sale, sellers may also choose to accept:\n\nChecks;\n\nMoney orders;\n\nCash on pickup;\n\nWire transfer.\n\neBay PayPal dilemma: Closing thoughts\n\nThe eBay-PayPal saga is a testament to how business relationships can evolve in the face of changing market dynamics and user preferences. While PayPal was once synonymous with eBay transactions, the shift towards Adyen indicates eBay’s push for a more streamlined, in-house payment process. However, the continued presence of PayPal as an option for buyers ensures that familiar payment methods remain, even as the platform adopts new strategies.\n\nAs the ecommerce world continues to change, the adaptability and forward-thinking approach of platforms like eBay will undoubtedly shape the future of online transactions."
