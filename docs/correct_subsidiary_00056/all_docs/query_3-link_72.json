        "text": "Since its inception in 1995 (just one year after Amazon), eBay has capitalized on the obsession we have for both online shopping and selling. But for those who run a business buying and selling items on eBay, reconciling accounts can get messy at the best of times.\n\nFor eBay, all payments and purchases were previously routed via Paypal, a subsidiary of eBay. Reconciling all transactions across the two platforms was time-consuming, causing inaccuracies, challenges with dispute resolutions, and delays in funds.\n\nTo resolve these issues, there is now eBay Managed Payments: eBay’s new payment system.\n\nWhat is eBay Managed Payments?\n\nIn 2015, Paypal and eBay broke apart, with Paypal becoming its own business entity outside of eBay. For the past 5 years, you’ve still been able to utilise Paypal as part of your eBay experience.\n\nHowever, that’s set to change. eBay Managed Payments replaces Paypal with a new way for sellers to manage their eBay business.\n\nAccording to eBay’s Managed Payments FAQ section:\n\n“Managed Payments is the new way to do business on eBay […] all sellers will eventually be required to have eBay manage their payments in order to keep selling on eBay.”\n\nYep, you read that right. As a seller, you now have no choice but to opt in to eBay Managed Payments.\n\nSo, how will this impact you as a seller?\n\nThe good news is, it should make life easier with consolidated fees, customized reports, refunds and returns, labels, simplified protections and tax documentation, all accessible through your eBay account hub.\n\nIf these changes concern you, you’re not alone. Even eBay’s former CEO Devin Wenig admitted that ’the devil will be in the execution’. It remains to be seen how well it rolls out.\n\nHow Does eBay Managed Payments Work?\n\neBay wants to keep all of your transactions within their platform. The idea behind this is that their internal platform is more streamlined, saving you time and money. This in-house system means you can sell and get paid all in one place.\n\nRather than funds being routed via Paypal and incurring additional fees, eBay manages the transactions between the seller and buyer. Sellers have access to their own ‘Seller Hub’ where you can track sales, obtain invoicing information, schedule payments and more.\n\nPros And Cons Of Using eBay Managed Payments\n\nIs eBay Managed Payments worth it?\n\nWhile eBay is always working towards a ‘ customer-centric’ system, the reality is that it may work better for some businesses than others. To give you an easy overview, here are some pros and cons to consider.\n\nPros of Using eBay Managed Payments:\n\nAutomatic funds transfer: Forget the old model of having to move funds to Paypal and then into your bank account. With eBay Managed Payments, your bank account is linked to the platforms, and balances are directly deposited.\n\nMore Payment Options: Credit cards, debit cards, gift cards, Paypal, Paypal Credit, Google Pay and Apple Pay are all accepted. This helps to reduce the risk of cart abandonment by ensuring that your customers are catered to, regardless of their preferred payment method.\n\nBetter Seller Protection: Rather than Paypal managing disputes as a third party, sellers are now able to manage this directly through eBay. This gives you more control in the complaints process.\n\nSimpler Fee Structure: There are zero third party fees when using eBay Managed Payments. You’ll just pay a nominal fee to eBay for each item sold and listed.\n\nStreamlined Refunds And Returns: With no fees lost to a third party, you can refund up to 100% of the purchase price on returns. These can be done simply via eBay.\n\nEasier Order Management: Easily track your sales via the introduction of a single order number for each sale. This also improves your ability to track your stock levels.\n\nSame Great Shipping Options: eBay’s Managed Payments global shipping program ensures you can still easily ship internationally. Customers’ taxes and import/export fees are taken care of for you.\n\nCons of Using eBay Managed Payments:\n\nDelayed Funds: It can take between 2-4 days for funds transferred from eBay to hit your nominated account. Some sellers have reported delays of up to 7 days.\n\nAdditional Fees: An added transaction fee of $0.25 per listing, per order now applies in addition to a payment processing fee of 2.7% of total order value.\n\nShipping Delays: If you’re a seller that does not ship until funds have been received, then the delayed payments can impact your turnaround and create a poor buyer experience. While you can try to mitigate this by advising longer turnaround times in your listing, this may turn off buyers who want their goods ASAP.\n\nNo Charity/Donation Options: There will no longer be an option to add a charitable donation to your sales at check-out.\n\nWhat Will eBay Managed Payments Cost Me As A Seller?\n\neBay Managed Payments Fees are, in a word, simpler.\n\nA fixed fee of just 30c per listing applies in addition to the standard post-sale fee. This is determined via a variable percentage from the total amount of the sale. This percentage varies by category and eBay store tier.\n\nAvoiding Paypal’s additional fees means sellers will make a saving when compared to their pre-managed payment days.\n\nIs eBay Managed Payments Worth It?\n\nIn short, yes.\n\nThere’s no doubt there are still some teething issues following the enforced migration to eBay Managed Payments. Testimonials from sellers are both positive and negative with some eBay Managed Payments forums going into detail on the challenges they have faced during the transition period.\n\neBay maintains its positive standpoint and shared one seller’s perspective in detail outlining:\n\nA saving of over $1200 of Paypal fees compared with the same time last year.\n\nAn easy-to-use payments portal.\n\nSales records numbers for easily tracking purchases.\n\nThe 30c saving per listing compared with the previous system.\n\nStreamlined funds transfer.\n\n33% boost in sales due to multiple payment options.\n\nSeller Danny Hone summed it up by saying ‘with Managed Payments, eBay is moving toward the retail standard. It is going to be a much better eBay when you fast forward two years down the line.’\n\nThe advantages appear to outweigh the downsides, and eBay’s Managed Payment reviews reflect this.\n\n‘With Managed Payments, eBay is moving toward the retail standard. It is going to be a much better eBay when you fast forward two years down the line.’\n\nWhat If I Prefer Paypal - Should I Leave eBay?\n\nIt may seem shocking to some that eBay is making such a huge shift in the way things have been done for over 20 years.\n\nThe reality is that the majority of online marketplaces already operate this way. eBay has been the hold-out.\n\nWhen we compare Managed Payments to Paypal in the eBay space, taking into account all the pros and cons and our inherent resistance to change, Managed Payments still comes out on top.\n\nThere will always be fees and challenges involved in selling on someone else’s platform. It’s just unavoidable. Regardless, eBay remains one of the easiest, most effective and most inexpensive ways to sell your goods.\n\n‘eBay remains one of the easiest, most effective and most inexpensive ways to sell your goods.’\n\nAs Payability points out, it would be madness to depart eBay. Setting up your own site and integrating Paypal isn’t a viable solution. eBay simply draws too much traffic to be ignored.\n\nFor continued ecommerce success, selling on multiple marketplaces (with some that still offer Paypal) is a better solution than leaving eBay altogether.\n\neBay Managed Payments Payout Schedule\n\nArguably, the reconciliation and accounts aspect of a business is nobody’s favourite task, particularly if you have income streams from multiple platforms. The schedule for eBay Managed Payments is completely customizable to suit your needs.\n\nSchedule your payments daily as funds arrive, or weekly on a day chosen by you. As per eBay’s FAQ section: ‘Once a payout is initiated, funds will be available in your bank account per normal bank processing times, typically within 1-4 business days.’\n\nIf you’ve ever wasted countless hours trying to reconcile your bank account against your sales summaries, you need an intuitive and intelligent solution.\n\nTo save yourself time and unnecessary stress, these transaction summaries can be delivered straight into Xero or QuickBooks Online with A2X. Here, your scheduled payments and summaries are easily matched and reconciled.\n\nHow To Account For Your eBay Managed Payments Settlements\n\nIf shifting from Paypal to eBay Managed Payments has you feeling uncomfortable about a new way of doing things, A2X can help.\n\nThere has never been a better time to upgrade your accounts process.
