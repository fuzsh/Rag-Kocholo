        "text": "Answer by David O Sacks, Original COO and Product Leader of PayPal, on Quora\n\n1. eBay risk.\n\nPayPal had a huge platform dependency on eBay, a site with its own competing payment solution.\n\neBay transactions generated two-thirds of PayPal's payment volume at the time of the acquisition. The off-eBay volume was growing faster, but would still require many years to overtake the on-eBay volume. Also, much of the off-eBay volume was acquired through the activities of eBay merchants on their own websites, so losing eBay as a customer acquisition channel might have ruined the off-eBay business as well.\n\nIt's important to realize that losing even half the eBay volume might have destroyed PayPal as a business (in 2002). Payment businesses are all about achieving scale. Most have razor-thin margins and large fixed costs so you need huge volumes to make the model work. (This is the problem with most payment startup ideas; people don't realize how big they have to get before they work at all.)\n\nOne thought experiment we engaged in was this: if we were running eBay Payments, could we think of ways to beat PayPal? We were arrogant enough to believe that we could, but not so arrogant to believe that eBay would never figure any of these things out.\n\nAfter all, eBay owned the platform and the checkout line. In hindsight, it's a miracle they didn't thrash PayPal.\n\n2. Visa and MasterCard risk.\n\nThe card associations had a dim view of PayPal, which they saw as a potential future rival that was operating in a grey area of their rules.\n\nThis risk was magnified by the eBay risk, because eBay was ginning up the card associations (through its relationship with Wells Fargo ) to clamp down on PayPal for supposed infractions. If either Visa or MasterCard shut down PayPal, it would destroy the product's value proposition because merchants want to offer a super-set of payment options.\n\nA subtle way for Visa and MasterCard to squash PayPal would have been to categorize all PayPal payments as \"quasi-cash\" (a form of currency), which has huge fees associated with it. Avoiding this categorization was a constant battle. To this day, you can see the result of our negotiations with the card associations in the \"Send Money\" flow on PayPal, which asks the user to categorize what the money is being sent for. Quasi-cash is one of the options; not surprisingly, users never check it. From a UI perspective, this was an ideal outcome; we were always concerned that it was subject to change.\n\n3. Legal risk.\n\nPayPal had begun to be used by a substantial number of online gambling sites. Although this was perfectly legal at the time, a number of state attorneys general (including Eliot Spitzer) were looking to make a name for themselves by investigating whether PayPal was \"aiding and abetting\" online gambling.\n\nIn conjunction with the eBay acquisition, PayPal announced that it was prohibiting these transactions. This was inevitable even without the acquisition, but as a stand-alone company PayPal would have been an easier target for politically-minded prosecutions.\n\nWe already had some experience with this: the State of Louisiana had previously shut down PayPal for a week due to the arbitrary decision of some bureaucrat (I forget why). This was reversed, but the legal issues seemed never ending.\n\n4. Psychological factors.\n\nThe team had been run down by years of fighting the \"PayPal Wars.\" Today, PayPal is a massive company that faces none of the risks above, but at the time the outcome was far from assured. The alternative to an acquisition was continued fighting on all of these fronts with a somewhat exhausted team. Today, because of PayPal's success, it's easy to look back and say that we should have gone for it, but at the time it certainly seemed like a tough slog.\n\n...\n\nAnswer by Keith Rabois, Internet entrepreneur, investor, and contrarian, on Quora\n\nThere were two key reasons we decided to sell to eBay:\n\na) Peter and Roelof studied eBay's core marketplace and came to the conclusion that it was stagnating. This was our core market, and we had no alternative markets of sufficient scale that were likely to succeed in a sufficiently short time horizon. (The rest of the world was still enamored with eBay, but we had unusual data insight into their performance and while eBay still had another year or two of international growth, PayPal was less baked into those markets.) As with most public companies, our market cap was primarily driven by prospects for growth over the next decade, so our stock would have been punished severely if we had decelerated in revenue as a result of eBay's decline.\n\nb) eBay was on a relentless campaign to artificially conscript buyers into using eBay Payments instead of paying with PayPal. Although we had defeated these initiatives over the past 12 months, we were not confident that we could succeed forever or that the government would intervene. (Reid had a pithy means of describing the challenge: Just because someone shoots five bullets at you and misses ... does not preclude the sixth one from killing you.)\n\nWhy did PayPal sell to eBay?: originally appeared on Quora: The best answer to any question.
