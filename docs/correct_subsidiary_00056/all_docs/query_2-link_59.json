        "text": "In January, John Donahoe, the C.E.O. of eBay, declared that he and his company’s board were resoundingly opposed to the idea, floated by Carl Icahn, the activist investor, to spin off PayPal. The payments company benefitted from being part of eBay in at least three ways, he said: it signed up eBay buyers and sellers as customers without significant marketing costs; it used data about eBay transactions to improve its own products; and it used eBay’s capital for investments. “Separation may seem like a compelling concept at first blush, but when you separate two highly intertwined and highly performing businesses, it creates significant distraction and dissynergies,” Donahoe concluded.\n\nNow, eight months later, eBay’s board, including Donahoe, has changed its mind. In a press release, eBay said that the board had reviewed the company’s options and concluded that, as independent companies, PayPal and eBay could each focus more on their individual goals and move more quickly; besides, the company said, eBay and PayPal are getting less important to each other over time. (Icahn wrote on Tuesday on his Web site, “We are happy that eBay’s board and management have acted responsibly concerning the separation—perhaps a little later than they should have, but earlier than we expected.”)\n\nThe turnabout seemed jarring because Donahoe’s earlier comments against separation had seemed so emphatic. Then again, a lot has changed since January—especially over the past month. In September, Apple announced a new payment system called Apple Pay that will let people use their phones to pay for items in brick-and-mortar checkouts; Stripe, a privately held payment startup that competes with PayPal, was included on a list of early Apple partners, while PayPal wasn’t. Later in the month, Alibaba went public and reiterated its plans to expand more aggressively into the U.S. and Europe; this came after Stripe and Alibaba’s payment service, Alipay, struck a deal in June to let Chinese buyers use their Alipay accounts to pay for things using Stripe. Meanwhile, Google and Amazon are building up their own, older payment services, and other competitors, like Square, are edging into PayPal’s business.\n\nMax Levchin, who co-founded PayPal and has invested in Stripe, told me in an e-mail that he feels the spin-off is “a smart move.” He pointed out that the payments industry has changed rapidly over the past several years. “While eBay and PayPal together took advantage of some of those opportunities better than others, many niches were simply too hard to reach,” he said. First, startups like Stripe and Square impinged on PayPal’s business (as did Venmo and Braintree, which PayPal now owns); now, with bigger companies like Apple getting more aggressive, he said, “The competition from both startups and big companies is only going to get more intense.”\n\nThe fact is, much of Donahoe’s early reasoning for keeping the companies together has become much less relevant. In the early years that eBay owned PayPal, eBay transactions still made up most of PayPal’s business, but by 2008 that figure had fallen to about fifty per cent, and today it stands at about thirty per cent. PayPal certainly still benefits from its eBay ties—as Donahoe emphasized back in January—but, in interviews with various press outlets on Tuesday, he added that the percentage of PayPal’s business from eBay is expected to drop below fifteen per cent in three years.\n\nThis means that it's increasingly important for PayPal to focus on other sources of growth. That will surely include persuading other retailers to partner with it—perhaps Alibaba, for instance, as it continues its westward expansion. If merchants were wary of joining up with PayPal when it was part of eBay, a competitor, they might be more eager to work with PayPal as an independent company. PayPal, too, should be more able to aggressively pursue partnerships with companies that compete with eBay, without having to worry about the impact on eBay’s business. As Denee Carrington, an analyst at the research firm Forrester told me, “They can focus on doing what’s best for Paypal without being constrained by doing what’s best for eBay.”"
