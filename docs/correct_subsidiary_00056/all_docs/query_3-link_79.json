You have to sign up for a managed payments account, and provide a checking account where your payouts will be deposited.\n\nhttps://pages.ebay.com/seller-center/service-and-payments/managed-payments-on-ebay.html\n\nBuyers can still use PayPal to pay for purchases, but you will have to create your PayPal account on paypal.com to do that.\n\n@recyclerblue_69\n\nPay Pal is no longer an option for sellers.\n\nYou have to sign up for Managed Payments, providing a checking account and the last 4 of your SSN.\n\nWithout that, you won't get paid.\n\nHave a great day.\n\nWhy this is is because the contract for PayPal to process payments expired and wasn't renewed.\n\nAYDEN is eBay's payment processor now and after they process your payment they give the proceeds to eBay for disbursement. eBay removes the sales tax and the final value fee from your payment and the balance is deposited in your checking account. It's been like this for many years.\n\nThis sucks, i don't want ebay to have my checking account information, by what i can see i dont seem to have any option. Is there no other way to get paid except to give them my checking account infor?\n\n@yogiboy4747 wrote:\n\nThis sucks, i don't want ebay to have my checking account information, by what i can see i dont seem to have any option.

Many have opened an eBay-only checking account.\n\nHi everyone,\n\nDue to the age of this thread, it has been closed to further replies.
