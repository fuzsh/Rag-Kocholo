        "text": "Cheques and Balances(Sheets) : PayPal Business Model\n\nWelcome to the second edition of Cheques and Balance (Sheets). Given the warm reception the first one had (BoAt Business Model), I thought why not do one the first week of every Month. And this month we shall talk about the business model of a FinTech company that has been around before even the term FinTech - PayPal\n\nPayPal is one the most well-known and successful fintech companies in the world. But not many know how they make money. In this article, we will take a look at PayPal's business model and explore their revenue sources. We will also discuss how they have been at the forefront of Fintech right from the start, how they continue to innovate to date and what are some risks with the business.\n\nHistory of PayPal\n\nPayPal is one of the most well-known and successful fintech companies in the world, known for its ease of transferring money from anywhere in the world over the internet. But that was not how the company started out. Paypal was set up by Peter Thiel, Luke Nosek and Max Levchin, in December 1998 as Confinity, on the premise that consumers and businesses needed a low cost and easy system to pay as an alternative to the slow and cumbersome cheque. And from there, they merged and demerged with eBay, acquired a slew of innovative companies and now offers a full stack of financial services, from payments, credit to buy/selling and HODLing crypto as well for 34 Million Merchants and 392 Million Consumers across 200 markets.\n\nIn the 90s, the internet was quite infamous for fraudulent transactions. And buying online meant either you expose yourself to hackers who’d steal your financial identity, or fly by night operators who’d promise you to world only to dupe you later. The wild west days of the Internet. PayPal identified the opportunity in the problem, and started working towards building a system that would make payments secure, while also guaranteeing that merchants held up to their end of the bargain.\n\nThey did the first by encrypting the details that customers entered on their side, exposing only their email IDs to the outside world when making a payment. And that had the added advantage that every time a consumer wanted to make another payment, they wouldn’t have to enter their accounts details or card numbers all over again, opting instead to enter their email id associated with their PayPal accounts.\n\nTo ensure that bad actor merchants were weeded out, Paypal would enter into an agreement that only upon receipt of their goods and services would the money be released to the merchants. And if there were disputes with the product delivered, PayPal would make it easy for the consumers get back their refund. The fair actors agreed to the terms, as most merchants are used to living with some amounts of accounts receivable in their business. But the bad actors got queasy with such agreements opting out of it instead. Building trust in the system.\n\nAnd from there, the company went on to acquire a bunch of financial service apps, like Braintree and Venmo, cementing their brand as a sound tech company that provides financial services (remember this was before FinTech as a term was coined).\n\nIn Pic: Timeline of Paypal’s achievements in the first decade – Founded in 1998; eBay Partnership 2000 ; Lists on Nasdaq 2002 and subsequently acquired by eBay for $1.5B ; Surpasses first Millions users in 2006, and reached 150 Million by the end on the first decade\n\nIn Pic: Second Decade timeline- 2013 acquires Braintree and Venmo; 2014 splits with eBay; Enter cross border payments in 2015 with Xoom acquisition; Venmo processes $1B payments in a month for the first time in 2016\n\nIn Pic: COVID year- 2019 305M active users; 2020 tie up with grocery delivery, ramp up mobile wallets to encash cheques, growth of 65%; 2021 $1.5T payments processed\n\nWhat problems does Paypal solve for ?\n\nNow that we know the basics of what it is that PayPal set out to do, lets see how they solve their customers problems. But before that, who does PayPal consider as their customers? Because PayPal is a 2 sided platform facilitating transactions between merchants and their consumers, they each count as PayPal’s customers. And they each have unique requirements that PayPal caters to.\n\nFor merchants\n\nFor merchants, PayPal aims to outsource all the headache associated with transacting online, so that business owners can focus on doing what they do best. Build better products/solutions and grow their business.\n\nThe services to merchants involve\n\n1. Get Paid Online : Without having to worry about what is your customers preferred payment mode\n\n2. Send and Spend money : Withdraw funds for day-to-day expense or to pay your vendors\n\n3. Added Security : Protect businesses from Frauds and minimize claims and chargebacks\n\n4. Payment Buttons : For small merchants who do not have a website, provide payment buttons to collect money\n\n5. Integrate with Platforms : Integrate payments with platforms like Shopify to grow the reach of your business\n\n6. Report and Monitor : Know your business better with Paypal’s reporting tools\n\nFor consumers\n\nWe Indians would remember how cumbersome it was to send money to someone instantaneously over the internet prior to UPI. You’d need their bank account details, which were so long and hard to remember, you’d need to authenticate yourself at several stages, and what’s more, wait 2 days for the funds to reflect in the recipients account.\n\nThis was in the late 2000s. Now imagine what things must have looked like back in the late 90s?\n\nAdd to it, this was the period when commerce over the internet was trying to make its way into mainstream shopping habits.\n\nBut there were a lot of concerns around safety and security, added to the complexity.\n\nPayPal sat here, providing users a way to send money and get refunds, via their email ids!\n\nWith time, they allowed for consumers to transact amongst each other, enter the mobile payments space, and subsequently with their acquisition of Xoom also provided remittances services. And in 2020, started building up their BNPL offering too!\n\nCross border problem\n\nThe acquisition of Zoom in 2015 was very strategic for Paypal. Up until then they were mostly present only in US and some countries in the European region, especially UK. Making inroads into other regions, especially Asia had been on their radar for a while, but they couldn’t seem to identify the right opportunity.\n\nOne data point from their users demographics would’ve shown the rising number of people of foreign origin, especially people from Mexico, India, the Philippines, China and Brazil using their app. This also meant that they’d find a need for sending money back home to their loved ones. And Xoom did exactly that, with a significant presence in the above mentioned markets.\n\nNow, if digital payments had a number of problems, cross border had ten fold those. Not only was it slow and cumbersome, but the number of middlemen involved in the process! And not every bank/fintech had the capability to process cross border payments.\n\nAll this at a time, when the likes of Alibaba was letting small Chinese merchants sell their wares globally, with the only thing holding them back being the ability to accept payments from people across their borders!\n\nSide Note: I honestly feel if PayPal had just focussed on cross border payments in India and not tried competing with existing wallets like PayTM, and then UPI, they would still be around a major player in the Indian market.\n\nHow do they earn money ?\n\nPayPal has numerous revenue streams from both Individual consumers and merchants. Such as collecting transactions fees, subscription fees for premium features offered to business, the sale of card readers, business loans, referral fees on cashback rewards, interchange fees, interest on cash advances etc. Lets find out what each of these means.\n\nTransaction Fees\n\nIn the financial services space this is typically known as Merchant Discount Rate (MDR). A cut of the total transaction volume, that banks, payment processors and card networks take in order to facilitate the transactions.\n\nSubscription Fees\n\nFor merchants to open and set up a Paypal account is free. But if they want access to advanced features then they are charged a subscription fee. Services include\n\n1. Ability to accept any card network payments\n\n2. Chargeback and Dispute resolution\n\n3. Logistics support\n\n4. Enabling BNPL or instalment options to the consumers of the merchant\n\n5. Providing merchants with cash advances to lower their cash cycles\n\n6. Access to Virtual terminal\n\n7. Acceptance of international payments\n\nBy the way, the cash advances given to the merchants also earns a healthy Annualised percentage Rate of 15-30%, adding another source of revenue to PayPal.\n\nConsumer Transaction Fees\n\nWhile setting up and sending money to another PayPal account is free of cost there are some transactions which will cost consumers. These are\n\n1. Paying using cards and not the PayPal wallet\n\n2. International payments\n\n3. Instant transfer to bank accounts\n\n4. Buying selling cryptocurrencies or other digital assets\n\nWhat is their secret sauce to Innovation?\n\nIts been over two decades, and PayPal is still hailed as an innovative Fintech company. They’ve been through the dotcom boom, the great financial collapse, and possibly another wave of bubble, and ye their innovation edge is sharp as ever. How have they managed that feat, all while profitably growing their venture?’\n\nAbility to identify trends\n\nThe biggest reason is probably acceptance. “We are working to lead a responsible transition to the digital economy, but we also know that no single company, organization or institution can do it all alone. It will require cooperation and collective action among all stakeholders, above and beyond the current level of engagement” as their CEO mentioned in their 2021 Annual Report. This has led them to take a collaborative approach with regulators, which providing a transparent mechanism of demonstrating the trends their data is projecting.\n\nNow PayPal has over 408M users, and a each user generated 45+ transactions, all of which are rich with data. These data points, are then fed back to identify what consumers and merchants want before they can vocalise it.\n\nThis led them to launching 8 new products by the last quarter of 2021 alone, with more in the pipeline!\n\nIn Pic : A slide from Paypal’s investor presentation for the year end of 2021, showcasing their new product and service launches\n\nStrategic Acquisitions\n\nBut occasionally it may not be possible to build all of these innovations in house, given the various constraints. This is where having an eye on potential upstarts really helps, and PayPal has executed this quite well. They have made 25 investments, and invested in 61 companies, since 2001. With their fund size totaling $190M!\n\nAll of these, in just 4 major segments : Payments, e-Commerce enablers, Cybersecurity and now Web3 with a promise for more to come. And they do have healthy free cashflow to make good on that promise (grew 9% YoY)\n\nWhat are some risks to Paypal?\n\nDecreasing take rates and transaction margins\n\nPayPal’s Take rate since 2020 has been slowly but surely declining, as have the transaction margins. This implies greater competition, which is bringing down their pricing power. So PayPal would need more transaction volumes in the future to maintain same level of revenue; or alternately add new customers and their incremental TPV to their top line much faster. And we all know how expensive it is to go out and get new customers.\n\nIn the below 3 pics: Graphs showcasing the declining Take rates, Transaction margins, and increasing customer acquisition costs, as per their financial report\n\nBut before we leave this section, a brief on what we mean by take rate. Take Rate is a term that came up in the platform world, which refers to the fees the platform or marketplace charges sellers and third parties for the transactions they do on the platform. In fact Take Rate became a bone of contention when Epic Games took Apple to court for their 30% cut of transactions performed on the app store.\n\nStock repurchase increasing\n\nPayPal’s Free Cash Flow has gone up 9% Year on Year. This means their business is getting optimised to be able to give out more cash despite their increasing scale. But that’s good news right, why is it under risks ?\n\nIdeally, when free cash flow inceases companies tend to diversify their assets. Some of them acquire, some of them invest it back in R&D, and in case both these options are exhausted, companies pay their stockholders back for the trust they placed. This is done either through dividend payouts, or stock repurchases. And PayPal has been repurchasing stocks the last 2 years, a lot.\n\nThis seems like a warning bell to me. Maybe they have lesser avenues to acquire or invest in new innovative companies? But that can’t be true, given how aggressively VCs have been finding and funding Fintechs. So probably, PayPal is not able to compete with VCs when it comes to the game of numbers and valuations ?\n\nSo, what is your take on PayPal?"
