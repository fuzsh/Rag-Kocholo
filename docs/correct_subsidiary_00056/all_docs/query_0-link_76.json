        "text": "One of the most well-known internet acquisitions of 2002 was when eBay Inc EBAY announced it was acquiring PayPal Holdings Inc PYPL. Investors who bought eBay shares on the day the deal was announced have done quite well for themselves.\n\nWhat To Know: eBay announced it was acquiring online payment company PayPal on Aug. 18, 2002. The deal valued PayPal at $1.5 billion six months after the company completed its initial price offering.\n\nThe acquisition united a company used as a partner of eBay and was said to help the companyâ€™s revenue and user growth.\n\nThirteen years after the acquisition, eBay spun off PayPal to shareholders and completed a public listing of the company. PayPal can still be used by eBay customers, but is not the only option for the online auction company.\n\nRelated Link: EBay Looking Into NFT Marketplace, How The Auction Site Could Gain More Monetizable Users\n\nInvesting $1,000 In eBay: Shares of eBay closed at $56.24 after the PayPal acquisition was announced.

These splits brought the total eBay shares up to 29.70 and 59.40, respectively.\n\nEBay shareholders received one share of PayPal for each eBay share they owned at the time of the July 20, 2015 spin-off.\n\nThe $1,000 purchase of eBay shares would not be made up of 59.40 shares of eBay and 59.40 shares of PayPal.\n\nThe eBay shares are valued at $4,000.59 based on a share price of $67.35.
