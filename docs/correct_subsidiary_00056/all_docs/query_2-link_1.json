        "text": "Who owns eBay? eBay is a publicly traded company, which means its shareholders own it. The largest shareholders of eBay Inc. by May 2023 were institutional investors like State Street Corporation, The Vanguard Group, and BlackRock. eBay’s co-founder, Pierre Omidyar, still holds a massive chunk of the company. But he no longer has an active role in its management.\n\neBay Detailed Ownership\n\nLet’s explore below the top individual shareholders and the institutional shareholders of the company, as well as its current owners.\n\nTop eBay Individual Shareholders\n\nSome of the leading individual shareholders at eBay were:\n\nPierre Omidyar: The eBay co-founder owns less than 1% of the company’s outstanding shares. His precise number of shares is not yet in the public domain, but word has it that his shares are not significant enough, which eliminates him from being a beneficial owner. Of course, this is according to SEC rules. Additional individual shareholders include:\n\nThe former eBay president Jeffrey Skoll;\n\neBay board member, Thomas Tierney;\n\nA former eBay CFO and interim CEO, Robert Swan;\n\nA former eBay board member, Fred Anderson.\n\nTop eBay Institutional Shareholders\n\nThe leading institutional shareholders at eBay include:\n\nCapital World Investors;\n\nThe Vanguard Group, Inc.;\n\nState Street Corporation;\n\nBlackRock, Inc.;\n\nFidelity Research & Management Company LLC.\n\nWho Runs eBay at the Moment?\n\nThe CEO of eBay is Jamie Iannone, which took up the position in April 2020 from Devin Wenig. Before joining eBay, Jamie was the CDO (Chief Digital Officer) at Walmart. His work involved overseeing the company’s eCommerce business, but he also had initial experience in different leadership positions at other eCommerce and technology companies — for example, Digital Products, Barnes & Noble, and SamsClub.com.\n\nWhat is eBay’s Original Story?\n\neBay’s story started in 1995 when Pierre Omidyar, the founder, established AuctionWeb, an online auction platform. Pierre, a computer programmer, was passionate and committed to building an online marketplace that would allow people to purchase and sell products to one another directly. The most attractive thing about his idea was that it wouldn’t require intermediaries, as is the case with auction houses and traditional retailers.\n\nWhen Pierre launched AuctionWeb, it was a small website he operated from his computer. But it evolved fast and attracted more users who started purchasing and selling goods. Pierre adopted the name eBay in 1996 because it was more marketable and memorable.\n\nAs eBay continued to grow, Omidyar knew that he needed to hire more staff to cope with the site’s rising demands. He brought on Meg Whitman as CEO in 1998. And eBay went public under her leadership the following year. This feat made it one of the most successful initial public offerings (IPOs) in history at the time.\n\neBay’s growth hasn’t slowed since then. In fact, it has surpassed its initial plan on online auctions, which has steered it into becoming a fully-developed eCommerce platform. You can buy and sell different types of products ranging from electronics, cars, fashion, and even real estate.\n\nHow did Pierre Omidyar Establish eBay?\n\nPierre Omidyar established eBay in 1995 by building a website. He named it AuctionWeb. During this phase, he relied on his impeccable computer programming skills. Peter had a background in computer science, had previously worked for Apple, and developed software for the Macintosh.\n\nPeter started the site as a personal project and put a broken laser pointer up for auction as a test. You may not believe this, but the laser pointer sold for $14.83 to a collector of broken laser pointers! And this first sale laid the foundation to form eBay.\n\nThe company started expanding beyond its initial focus on auctions to include fixed-price listings and other e-commerce features. eBay went public in 1998, and its success transformed Peter into a billionaire and a distinguished figure in the tech industry.\n\neBay’s History of Ownership\n\neBay has had several changes in ownership over the years. Here are some of the core events in eBay’s history of ownership:\n\n1995: Pierre Omidyar founds the company;\n\n1998: eBay goes public in an IPO, raising $63.5 million and valuing the company at more than $2 billion;\n\n2002: eBay acquires PayPal for $1.5 billion;\n\n2005: eBay acquires Skype, for $2.6 billion;\n\n2008: eBay reveals plans to branch off PayPal into a separate publicly traded company;\n\n2015: eBay completes PayPal’s branch off into a separate publicly traded company;\n\n2019: Elliott Management, an activist hedge fund, took a 4% stake in eBay and pushed for changes to the company’s strategy;\n\n2020: eBay sold StubHub, a ticket resale platform, to Viagogo for $4.05 billion;\n\n2021: eBay sold the Classifieds Group, which included several online classified advertising sites, to Adevinta for $9.2 billion in cash and stock.\n\nToday, eBay is a publicly traded company, which means it has no majority shareholder. As of May 2023, the largest individual shareholder is Thomas J. Tierney, with a 0.76% stake in the company. And the largest institutional shareholder is Vanguard Group Inc., with a 7.36% stake.\n\nWhat is the eBay Brand Worth?\n\nAccording to the annual ranking of the world’s most valuable brands by Brand Finance, eBay’s brand value was $11.2 billion in 2021. With this ranking, the company became the 76th most valuable brand globally.\n\nIt’s important to understand that a brand’s value often fluctuates over time based on various factors, such as increased competition, changes in consumer buying habits, and market conditions. Further, different organizations may have varying methods of valuing a brand, which means their estimates of a brand’s worth are likely to vary.\n\nWhat Else Is There to Know About eBay?\n\nHere are some quick facts and information about eBay:\n\neBay is a global e-commerce platform. It links connects buyers and sellers from different parts of the world. Also, it allows users to buy and sell a wide range of items, as mentioned above. These items include electronics, fashion, collectibles, and more;\n\neBay has over 190 million active buyers and 20 million active sellers globally. These numbers make it one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the world;\n\neBay was founded in 1995 by Pierre Omidyar as an online marketplace for auctions. It has since evolved into a full-fledged e-commerce platform that allows users to buy and sell goods using fixed-price listings, as well as auctions;\n\neBay operates in over 190 markets worldwide, and it has localized websites in more than 20 countries. The company also offers international shipping services, and these allow buyers and sellers to transact across borders;\n\neBay generates revenue primarily through transaction fees charged to sellers. But it also generates revenue through advertising on its platform. The company’s revenue in 2020 was $10.3 billion;\n\neBay owns several other e-commerce businesses. For example, StubHub is a platform for buying and selling event tickets, while Classifieds Group is a network of online classifieds sites;\n\neBay has faced criticism and legal challenges over the years due to various issues, such as counterfeit goods and fraudulent transactions. The company has taken steps to address these issues. Some of these are; implementing measures to prevent fraud and collaborating with law enforcement agencies to fight counterfeit goods.\n\nWhat is the IPO Story of eBay?\n\neBay’s initial public offering (IPO) was one of the most successful in history. It marked a turning point for the company and solidified its place in the tech industry. Here’s a brief overview of eBay’s IPO story:\n\neBay went public on September 24, 1998. Its initial offering price was $18 per share. Previously, the company had planned to price the shares at $14 to $16. But strong investor demand pushed the price up;\n\nFrom the IPO, the company raised $63.5 million for eBay. And with 3.5 million shares sold to the public. At the end of the first day of trading, the stock price had risen to $53.50, which gave the company a market capitalization of over $2 billion;\n\neBay’s IPO was considered a success, not just because of the high initial valuation. But because it indicated that the market was open to e-commerce businesses. At the time, many investors were skeptical of the potential the Internet had as a viable business platform;\n\nFollowing the success of eBay’s initial public offering, its founder, Pierre Omidyar, became a billionaire almost overnight.
