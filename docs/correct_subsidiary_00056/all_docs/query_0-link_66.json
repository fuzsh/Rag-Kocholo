        "text": "E-commerce behemoth eBay is officially abandoning online payments system PayPal after 15 years, opting for a new service that’s expected to deliver benefits to sellers.\n\neBay announced that it would stop working with PayPal in 2020 and transition to Adyen, an Amsterdam-based payments company, later that year.\n\nAdyen’s customers include tech industry giants Uber, Netflix, and Spotify.\n\nAdyen primarily provides back-end payments services, like credit card processing, and won’t have a visible presence at the eBay checkout, unlike the “pay with PayPal” button.\n\neBay users will continue to have the option of using PayPal until 2023, but it will effectively be relegated to “second-class status”.\n\nPayPal has been eBay’s main payments provider since 2003. In the same year, eBay acquired PayPal in a deal valued at $1.5 billion.\n\neBay and PayPal parted ways in 2015 and become separate public companies, but maintained close business ties.\n\nThe announcement that eBay is officially breaking away from PayPal marks the end of one of the tech industry’s “most storied partnerships”.\n\nWhy eBay abandoned PayPal\n\neBay says it’s moving from PayPal to Adyen in order to “improve its customer experience” by intermediating payments on its marketplace.\n\n“In doing so, eBay will manage the payments flow, simplifying the end-to-end experience for buyers and sellers,” the company said in a statement.\n\nIt seems that the main motivation for the switch from PayPal to Adyen is enhanced user experience.\n\neBay says that the ecommerce landscape is becoming increasingly competitive and users expect to be able to both shop and checkout on the site on which they transact.\n\nSo rather than completing payments through an external provider like PayPal, eBay wants to keep everything in-house and on-site with Adyen.\n\nAdyen’s service extends to more than 150 currencies and over 200 methods of payments, which provides increased flexibility for eBay users.\n\nWhat it means for sellers\n\neBay says that it’s focussed on improving customer experience, but what does the shift to Adyen mean for sellers?\n\nCosts for sellers mostly the same\n\nUnder the new 'managed payments' system, sellers pay 12.9% eBay fees per sale + 30 cents, as opposed to the old system where they'd pay 10% eBay fees, 2.9% Paypal fees + 30 cents. So the fees are the same as before on most items, although eBay's cut does change slightly between product categories and may be higher than this.\n\neBay says sellers will also benefit from a more simplified pricing structure and more predictable access to funds.\n\nA central place to manage business\n\nIt sounds as though eBay is working on an integrated business dashboard for sellers to manage all aspects of their online stores in one place.\n\nIn a statement, the company said it is “working on solutions to provide sellers with information about their eBay business, inclusive of payments information, in one place so that sellers can easily track and manage all of their transactions and customer interactions on eBay”.\n\nAs promised, eBay has been rolling out a range of new tools for sellers, including a new listing tools and the ability to add product videos. The company is continually adding to these to improve sellers' capabilities, so it pays off to keep checking back and making sure you're using functionalities to their full advantage.\n\nGreater reach and more sales\n\nThis is a bold claim for eBay to make. But the company believes that the switch to Adyen will allow sellers to “reach more buyers and improve conversion”.\n\neBay says that offering buyers a greater range of payments options and currencies will allow sellers to reach more potential customers.\n\nAlso, having greater flexibility and a more streamlined process at the checkout may reduce cart abandonment rates and increase conversions.\n\nThe legitimacy of this claim is yet to be tested, but eBay seems confident that by making shopping easier for buyers, it will make business better for sellers.\n\nPayPal to remain as a payment option\n\nSellers that rely on PayPal to conduct business on eBay don’t have to worry about being left behind.\n\nPayPal will remain as a payment option on eBay until July 2023, allowing plenty of time for sellers to transition to the new system.\n\neBay says that “PayPal will remain an important partner”.\n\nIt seems that PayPal will continue to have a place on eBay, it will just be less prominent.\n\nSharing more data\n\nIt will be business as usual for sellers on eBay during the transition process.\n\nHowever, eBay says that sellers should expect to provide them with “some additional payments-related data and transition to a new relationship with eBay that includes integrated payments capabilities”.\n\nNew terms, which came into action on 1 June 2021, say the new payment system is compulsory, and that the company has the power to limit or remove listings from sellers who refuse to use it.\n\nThis won’t happen immediately, but eBay expects that the transition for sellers will occur prior to July 2021.\n\nWith an estimated 25 million sellers on eBay, this transition will take some time to complete.\n\nReaction to the eBay-PayPal breakup\n\nThe move from PayPal to Adyen has, for the most part, been met with uncertainty within the eBay community.\n\nSellers have shared concerns about eBay potentially taking control of their money, fees, and sharing payments-related data with a foreign company.\n\nThe lack of detail in eBay’s public statement seems to have left sellers feeling unsure and concerned about the changes.\n\nIt has also given rise to unfounded speculation around eBay’s plans and intentions. However, some eBay users are choosing to “hold off judgement” until more information becomes available.\n\nAlternatives to PayPal on eBay\n\neBay and PayPal have been joined at the hip for the best part of 15 years. Even when the companies parted ways in 2015, they struck a deal that required eBay to conduct 80% of transactions via PayPal.\n\nIn the same year, eBay also told sellers that they would no longer be able to use alternative payment processing services Skrill (formerly Moneybookers), ProPay, and Paymate.\n\nThis is why the announcement that eBay is breaking away from PayPal is so significant and, perhaps, why many sellers are upset about it.\n\nPayPal is familiar and reliable.\n\nSellers don’t have to abandon PayPal on eBay as the service will still be available until at least July 2023.\n\nFor those who want to try an alternative to PayPal on eBay, there isn’t much to choose from.\n\neBay says that it allows:\n\nCredit and debit card transfers\n\nPayment upon pickup\n\nIt restricts access to:\n\nBank-to-bank transfers (bank wire transfers and bank cash transfers)\n\nChecks\n\nMoney orders\n\nOnline payment services: Allpay.net, CertaPay, hyperwallet.com, Fiserv, Nochex.com, XOOM\n\nHowever, there are very few verified reviews of these alternative services online, suggesting that most sellers have been opting for PayPal.\n\nAlso, some of these alternative online services are restricted to specific countries. For example Allpay.net only works in the United Kingdom and parts of Europe, and CertaPay is only available in Canada.\n\nThe news that Adyen’s service extends to more than 200 payment methods could mean that eBay is about to become more flexible for buyers and sellers.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nIt can be! It is a multi billion dollar industry estimated to be worth over 266 billion by 2027 so there is absolutely room to tap into the market and make a profit.\n\nYes, as of 2023, eBay accepts PayPal and you can use it to pay for your items on eBay. To pay with PayPal, all you have to do is select PayPal as your payment method at checkout and enter your account information. You can use PayPal to pay for eBay items as a member or guest.\n\nOn eBay, different categories affect the type of payment that is accepted. Generally, in most categories, credit cards, debit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and PayPal are accepted and checks, money orders, and bank wire transfers aren’t allowed for most eBay purchases.\n\nAbout the author\n\nSimon Slade\n\nCEO of SaleHoo Group Limited\n\nSimon Slade is CEO and co-founder of SaleHoo, a platform for eCommerce entrepreneurs that offers 8,000+ dropship and wholesale suppliers, 1.6 million high-quality, branded products at low prices, an industry-leading market research tool and 24-hour support.\n\nView profile\n\nThanks for the feedback!
