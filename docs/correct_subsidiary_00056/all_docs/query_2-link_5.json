        "text": "Although auctions constitute the bulk of eBay sales, fixed-price sales also comprise a significant share of transactions. The company, which caters to individuals and small businesses, is a market leader in e-commerce worldwide. eBay is headquartered in San Jose, California.\n\nHow eBay works\n\neBay relies on its users to self-regulate the trading community through a feedback system that lets buyers rate sellers on transactions. Formerly, sellers also could leave negative feedback on buyers, but this feature was removed in 2008.\n\nIn theory, the eBay system ensures that unscrupulous vendors are exposed and lose the trust enjoyed by reputable sellers. In practice, some vendors have received poor ratings through no fault of their own (for example, because of problems with package deliveries). Simultaneously, other vendors have garnered good ratings for a short period before setting up cybercrime scams to defraud customers.\n\neBay offers educational resources for best-practice trading to help sellers get the ratings they deserve. eBay also lists categories of potentially prohibited items. The company sanctions would-be traffickers in goods that may be illegal or offensive.\n\nIn 1998, eBay went public, with shares listed on the Nasdaq exchange under the ticker symbol EBAY. Also in 1998, the eBay Foundation was formed.\n\neBay weathered the dot-com bust of the early 2000s in part because it relied on transaction fees rather than advertising revenue. The company also used the tumultuous time to grow, adding new product features and expanding internationally.\n\n2000–2020: Appetite for acquisitions (and loss thereof)\n\neBay kicked off a long acquisition spree with its purchase of the digital payments platform PayPal in 2002. The acquisition was logical because many eBay users were already using PayPal to complete transactions for the platform.\n\neBay in 2004 acquired a 25% minority stake in Craigslist—the mother of all garage sale platforms. The intent was to enable the two companies to share synergies in the form of expertise, resources, and creativity.\n\neBay also acquired the online rentals platform Rent.com in 2004. In 2005, the auctions platform purchased the online comparison shopping site Shopping.com as well as Gumtree, a global classified listings site. All of these acquisitions aimed to expand eBay’s online presence to new e-commerce markets.\n\neBay made another major purchase in 2005 when it acquired the Internet communications company Skype. In 2007 eBay also bought StubHub, positioning itself as the world’s largest online marketplace for entertainment event tickets.\n\nMost of eBay’s acquisitions were later divested:\n\nSkype was sold in 2009 at a loss to private investors. (In 2011, Microsoft acquired Skype in a deal worth $8.5 billion.)\n\nRent.com was sold in 2012 to the advertising and media company Primedia.\n\nPayPal was spun off into an independent company in 2015.\n\nAlso in 2015, eBay divested its minority stake in Craigslist.\n\nGumtree was sold in 2020 to Adevinta, a Norway-based online secondhand marketplace.\n\nAlso in 2020, the company sold StubHub to the multinational ticket exchange platform Viagogo.\n\n2020s: Committed to tech innovation\n\neBay has continued to add new tech features to its platform throughout its history. Organized around the idea of “tech-led reimagination,” the company began supporting sales of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in 2021.\n\nTo increase its exposure to NFT sales, eBay in 2022 acquired KnownOrigin, a platform that enables buying and selling of NFT-based digital collectibles. Also in 2022, eBay announced the launch of a series of eco-conscious NFTs through a partnership with the green NFT platform OneOf.\n\nIn 2023, eBay began integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into its platforms, launching a “magical listings” tool that enables sellers to upload a product photo to the eBay app and use AI to add the product’s details.\n\neBay controversies\n\neBay has a long history that’s not without controversy. The platform has faced issues ranging from counterfeit goods to concerns over user privacy and fraud:\n\nCounterfeit goods distribution. Several European manufacturers have sued eBay, charging that it was complicit in the distribution of counterfeit goods because it took commissions on sales without imposing adequate controls on the transactions. Some luxury fashion houses in France sued eBay for damages, with the first judgment of €20,000 being levied against the company in June 2008.\n\nMassive data breach. eBay in 2014 reported that hackers raided its infrastructure to access the records of approximately 145 million users. The data breach leaked users’ passwords, email addresses, birth dates, mailing addresses, and other personal information, raising serious concerns about eBay’s data handling practices.\n\nFraudulent bidding. eBay has struggled to combat fraudulent practices like shill bidding—the practice of bidding on your own items to raise the auction price. The company has attempted to address fraudulent bidding by, in some cases, filing lawsuits against alleged offenders.\n\nThe positive side\n\nThe eBay platform features many tools to support both buyers and sellers. The company also aims to positively impact communities through the eBay Foundation. Since its founding, eBay has channeled a portion of its profits back into local community causes around the world.\n\neBay in 2006 joined the United Nations Global Compact, the largest voluntary corporate responsibility initiative worldwide. According to eBay, the commitment demonstrates the company’s “belief in the power of business to drive positive social and environmental impact.”\n\neBay also organizes eBay Main Street, a global grassroots action network for public policy issues that affect e-commerce. A key focus of the Main Street initiative is to inform and protect small business sellers and consumers, according to the initiative’s website.\n\neBay’s value proposition—the efficient sale and transfer of goods and services from seller to buyer, and helping find new homes for pre-owned goods that might otherwise end up in landfills—is certainly a positive one. As the company stated in its 2023 Impact Report, “Creating a more sustainable future has been a cornerstone of eBay for more than 25 years. As longtime champions of recommerce and the circular economy, we are leading the way toward a healthier planet and a more inclusive economy.”"
