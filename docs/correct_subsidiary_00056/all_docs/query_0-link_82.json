        "text": "I agree and continue to be amazed at the public anger directed at paypal. However, like most people, if you don't use paypal it's hard to do business on ebay and they're well aware of that. IMO that's the reason they don't give a rat's **bleep** how much people hate them. But a funny thing happened yesterday. I called ebay checking on a matter having to do with my account, no big deal but I did want it corrected. As the lady was helping me I just asked her if ebay owned paypal. She said no then wanted to know why I asked and I said \"I'd better not say I know ya'll are close\" The lady kind of laughed quietly and then said \"another satisfied customer huh? And that set me off telling my story and lining up lawsuits with the Mississippi Attorney Generals office, basically alot of stuff no one wants to hear unless they can relate. Anyway, she mentioned quietly that it seems doing business on ebay is about to become much easier with little emphasis on paypal. Apparently they're tired of hearing everyone complain to so they're about to either let someone else in or create their own deal. Either way if it comes through ebay you know they'll take care of you and make paypal second team. That tickles me to death and I cannot wait to close my paypal account\n\n\"Horrible Idea\" is RIGHT!!!!! It's more like fraud! I listed an item which sold last Sunday, 9-11-11. The buyer happened to live 40 miles away, so rather than waste money to ship it, ( it weighed 400 lbs.) the buyer and I met half-way and made the transfer.(half hour drive for each of us) He was delighted and happy with his purchase, and after a half hour of exchanging \"war stories\", we both went happily on our way. He even posted a comment on EBay that night how happy he was. I figured funds would be available within 3 days. BUT, I seen on my Pay-Pal account that funds wouldn't be available to me untill Oct. 2nd!!!! I called them and spoke to someone that appeared to be \"Not Of This Country\", and asked why I have to wait so long, when the customer already has the item, is very satisfied, and notified EBay as such. She told me that without a \"shipping label\", they could NOT confirm shipping. I told her to call the guy up and confirm it then. She says they don't encourage \"hand delivery\" and without a shipping label, a seller has to wait for 21 days!!!!!! BULL!!!! That was NOT listed anywhere that I could find. This person I spoke with seemed to be \"Blindered\" in the way she tried to answer my questions, as she kept repeating herself, like she was reading the answers from a screen or print. I even called EBay, and they told me that it was up to PayPal to confirm shipment. They have a flaw in their system to deal with the off-chance that a buyer is from the same area, and will not admit it, all they want is to keep your money as long as possible to earn interest from it AFTER they charge you for the transfer.\n\nSo here I sit with NOTHING, while the buyer is using the item to make money, EBay has charged me $94.00 to sell the item, PayPal deducted $36.00 bucks from the buyers payment, and all I have is a promise that my funds will be available 3 weeks AFTER everyone else involved is paid and happy. Never again my friend........"
