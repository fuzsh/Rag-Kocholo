        "text": "PayPal made its biggest ever acquisition today by buying Swedish fintech startup iZettle for $2.2 billion, the financial technology company that offers payments via smartphones and other financial products in Europe and Latin America.\n\nThis news comes after iZettle announced that it was planning an IPO, but cofounder Jacob de Geer decided to go in a different direction and said: \"Late in the IPO process, PayPal got in touch and showed a serious interest in iZettle.\n\n\"By joining the PayPal family we'll become iZettle with superpowers and jump on a fast track to realise our vision.\" The fintech aims to generate $165 million in revenue in 2018, but what will PayPal's acquisition mean for iZettle.\n\nHere's a summary of other PayPal acquisitions into the fintech space over the years and with that, see if iZettle will be able to achieve its goals and raise the money it needs to expand to more countries.\n\nBraintree and Venmo\n\nBraintree is currently a division of PayPal and provides mobile and web payment systems for e-commerce companies. After being founded in 2007 by Bryan Johnson, Bill Ready took over as CEO and soon after, the startup acquired Venmo for $26.2 million.\n\nIn 2013, PayPal acquired Braintree for $800 million and the fintech then announced that they would expand to Australia, Europe and Canada. Later, the company expanded to Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia.\n\nWhat this already shows is that PayPal can open up avenues for fintech startups and boost revenue by helping them expand to other countries. Braintree's most successful online customers include Uber and Airbnb and today, has become one of the best companies for merchant account services and payment processing.\n\nVenmo, that PayPal also acquired as part of the Braintree deal, is also a significant player in the payments industry. While Venmo's payment volume only represents a small part of PayPal's mobile service, it is a fast growing platform despite competition from the likes of large corporations like Apple.\n\nPaydiant\n\nIn 2015, PayPal took on Apple Pay again after acquiring payments startup Paydiant for $280 million in order to create mobile wallet applications. Paydiant's clients include Subway, Best Buy and MCX, a group of retailers led by Walmart.\n\nWhile Paydiant has always been popular in traditional stores, its acquisition ensured that it became a valid competitor against Apple and Google and PayPal could do the same for iZettle - offering the opportunity to grow within the mobile wallet space.\n\nXoom Corporation\n\nPayPal acquired Xoom Corporation for $890 million back in 2015 while it was still part of eBay and the payments company used the startup to target emerging markets India and China as important growth territories.\n\nThe digital money transfer and remittance provider allows customers to send money, make payments and reload mobile phones from the US to 70 different countries and was founded in 2001.\n\nModest\n\nIn order to expand into a niche branch of e-commerce called contextual commerce, PayPal acquired the fintech Modest, which enables online merchants to drag and drop buy buttons to web pages and mobile apps to where consumers may see their products and purchase them there, without leaving the page.\n\nThis ties into iZettle's mantra of simplifying payments and Modest worked with Braintree to ensure that online merchants have the tools needed to embed buy buttons wherever they see fit as well as supporting back-end payment processing.\n\nTIO Networks\n\nPayPal acquired Canadian payments platform TIO Networks in 2017 for $233 million to make moves in the bill payments space by using the startup's own cloud based payment platform.\n\nHowever, because of a data breach, the payments giant suspended Tio Networks after further vulnerabilities were found in the service.\n\nSwift Financial\n\nIn 2017, PayPal paid $183 million to buy Swift Financial, which was founded in 2006 and at the time of the acquisition, had given funding over 20,000 small businesses.\n\nPayPal has made a total of 13 acquisitions in over 20 years, but has not disclosed the values for all of the company. iZettle is the biggest acquisition that the payments giant has made to date."
