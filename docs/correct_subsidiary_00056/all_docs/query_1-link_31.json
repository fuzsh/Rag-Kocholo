        "text": "Your rights to access, correction, deletion, and restriction to use or share your Personal Information.\n\nUnder applicable data protection law, you have certain rights to how your Personal Information is collected, stored, used and shared.\n\nWe recognize the importance of your ability to control the use of your Personal Information and provide several ways for you to exercise your rights to access (right to know), correction, deletion (erasure), and to restrict certain information (right to opt out of sharing and right to limit use and disclosure of sensitive personal information).\n\nWe will not deny you services, charge you different prices, or provide you with a different level of service solely for exercising your privacy rights. If you are a California resident, learn more about how we have handled your Privacy Rights.\n\nHow do you exercise your rights?\n\nIf you, or an authorized agent, want to exercise any of your rights relating to your Personal Information, contact us or submit your request from your account settings. If you have a PayPal account, you can exercise your privacy rights by accessing “Data and Privacy” from account settings in the PayPal app.\n\nIf you, or an authorized agent, want to exercise any of your rights relating to your Personal Information in your Fastlane profile, contact us or submit your request from your Fastlane profile management portal.\n\nEven if you do not have a PayPal account (for example, where you use Pay without a PayPal account), you can submit a request for access, correction, or deletion of your Personal Information by contacting us at the number provided in our Contact Information section.\n\nIf you or an authorized agent submit a request, we’ll first need to verify who you are before we can respond to your request. We may ask you to provide us with information necessary to reasonably verify your identity before responding to your request. We will compare the information you submit against our internal business records to verify your identity. If we can’t verify your identity, we will not be able to fulfill your request. If we deny your request in whole or in part, you may have the right to appeal the decision. In such circumstances, we will provide you with information regarding the appeals process.\n\nYour right to request a copy of the Personal Information. If you want to make a request to know about the data we’ve collected about you in the past 12 months, you have choices:\n\nLog in to your PayPal or Xoom account or Fastlane profile management portal and submit a request\n\nCall or contact us and request that we provide you with the data we’ve collected.\n\nYour right to correct your Personal Information:\n\nLog in to your PayPal or Xoom account or Fastlane profile management portal and correct information you previously added. For example, you can edit your addresses in your settings\n\nCall or contact us and request that we correct specific information\n\nYour right to delete your Personal Information:\n\nLog in to your PayPal or Xoom account or Fastlane profile management portal and delete information you previously added. For example, you may delete your non-primary addresses in your settings\n\nCall us or contact us and request that we delete specific information\n\nClose your PayPal or Xoom account or Fastlane profile\n\nIf you close your PayPal or Xoom account or Fastlane profile or request that we delete Personal Information, we still need to keep some Personal Information as explained in How long does PayPal store your Personal Information section so we can:\n\nComplete a transaction, provide goods or services you requested, or comply with our promises to you in the user agreement or other contract you have with us\n\nDetect and prevent malicious, fraudulent, or illegal activity\n\nProtect your (or another person’s) legal rights, including the right to free speech\n\nManage our internal business processes that are reasonably related to your expectations when using our Services\n\nComply with laws and other legal or governmental processes\n\nCalifornia also offers a right to opt out of “Selling” and “Sharing” Personal Information. Global Privacy Control setting is a browser setting that notifies website owners of users' privacy preferences regarding selling or sharing their personal information. PayPal does not respond to these settings because we do not sell or share data. Some Personal Information collected, processed, or disclosed by a financial institution are subject to federal laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Consumers may read our Consumer Privacy Notice for more information about their rights under US federal law.\n\nUnderstanding your choices\n\nYou can control how Personal Information is collected or disclosed, as well as how we communicate with you. Here are some of the ways you can customize your choices.\n\nChoose how we collect Personal Information\n\nYou may choose to limit the Personal Information you provide when our apps or Services request it. To help make choices that are right for you, it’s important to understand that Personal Information helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you. Also, some Personal Information is required for our Services to function at all.\n\nFor example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to. If you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if shared your contacts. Another example is creating an account or Fastlane profile with us. If you choose not to provide information that is required for an account or Fastlane profile to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account or Fastlane profile for you.\n\nChoose how linked accounts collect and use Personal Information\n\nIf you link your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your Personal Information is collected, used, and shared by them. Read the third parties’ privacy policies to see the choices they offer you.\n\nYou can control which third-party services you link to your account and what Personal Information they can collect about you. For example, to manage the permissions, go to the Security settings in your PayPal account.\n\nChoose what we disclose with other Users\n\nSome Personal Information may be seen by other Users. You may be able to adjust or turn off this setting in the privacy section in your account settings.\n\nChoose how we communicate with you\n\nYour choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered. Some messages are considered optional, and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts or Fastlane profile with us. We use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even phone calls or paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences.\n\nYou can click the unsubscribe link in a PayPal or Fastlane marketing email, opt out of a text message by replying “STOP,” or turn off notifications on your device. You can also change your account’s notification settings or the notification preferences on your device.\n\nYou won’t be able to opt out of messages that are considered necessary for the Services, such as digital receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account or Fastlane profile's status. You may be able to decide how we send those messages, such as by email, phone, text message, or a notification on your mobile device."
