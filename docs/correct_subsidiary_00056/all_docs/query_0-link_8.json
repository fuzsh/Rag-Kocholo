        "text": "Why have PayPal and eBay become separate companies? Weren’t they already separate?\n\nPreviously, PayPal and eBay were related as members of the eBay Inc. corporate family of companies. Within this corporate structure, PayPal already was operating as a separate, stand-alone company. Now, eBay and PayPal are no longer part of the same group of companies. Separation makes it easier for both PayPal and eBay to grow their own businesses and provides each company with new market and partnership opportunities that would have been more difficult to pursue while part of the combined corporate family.\n\nWhat does the separation of PayPal and eBay mean to me?\n\nWe’re committed to maintaining a quality relationship with our customers. We’ve made updates to the PayPal User Agreement to keep the same customer experience in place. eBay will continue to work with PayPal for payments, refunds and holds. This is in line with how PayPal and eBay have worked together in the past.\n\nWhy were changes made to the PayPal User Agreement and Privacy Statement?\n\nWe update our User Agreement and Privacy Statement regularly to make sure they’re up to date with our relationships with our customers, the nature of our business, our privacy practices, and even changes in applicable laws. With PayPal and eBay separating, some of the current updates to the PayPal User Agreement and Privacy Statement also reflect the changed relationship between the companies\n\nWhen did the PayPal updates take effect?\n\nChanges to PayPal’s User Agreement and Privacy Statement took effect on July 1, 2015.\n\nWhat were the changes that PayPal made to its User Agreement and Privacy Statement?\n\nA number of updates were made. Some of these updates reflect the changing nature of PayPal’s relationship with eBay. Although we’ll no longer be part of the same group of companies, we'd like to continue providing customers with the same great services and experiences they've come to expect. For example, the Privacy Statement describes PayPal’s sharing of account information with eBay and other third parties for purposes of fraud prevention and risk management, customer service, shipping, and legal compliance. As has always been the case, third parties will not be able to use this information for their marketing purposes without a customer’s express consent.\n\nWhy does PayPal share customer data with third parties?\n\nWe don’t rent or sell our customers’ information to third parties for their own purposes. As stated in our Privacy Statement, we share data with third-parties for purposes such as fraud prevention and risk management, customer service support, shipping, legal compliance, managing our business, and delivering our services. For example, just like most banks or financial/payment service providers, PayPal works with third-party service providers who provide important functions that allow us to be an easier, faster, and safer way to make payments. We need to share data with them from time to time so that services our customers have requested can be delivered. As has always been the case, third parties aren’t able to use this information for their marketing purposes without a customer’s express consent.\n\nIn what instances will my personal information be shared between PayPal and eBay?\n\nThe Privacy Statement update reflects, among other things, the changing nature of the relationship between PayPal and eBay and how they will work together to continue providing the experiences that customers have come to expect. For example, PayPal will share account information with eBay and other third parties for purposes of fraud prevention and risk management, customer service, shipping, and legal compliance. As has always been the case, third parties will not be able to use this information for their marketing purposes without a customer’s express consent."
