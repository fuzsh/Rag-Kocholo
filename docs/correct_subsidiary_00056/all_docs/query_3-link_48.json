Apart from creating some of the biggest companies in tech, they all share a common résumé line item: they've all worked at PayPal.\n\nMany of PayPal's early employees went on to become major names in tech and the venture capital world, founding, funding, and otherwise developing successful companies. This elite group came to be known as the \"PayPal Mafia,\" a nickname that gained popularity after Fortune featured the term in a 2007 piece along with a photo of some of the members dressed in gangster attire.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nMembers of the group include Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and Reid Hoffman, along with over a dozen others. Here's a rundown of the most prominent members of this exclusive group and what they're up to over two decades later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeter Thiel: PayPal's founder and the so-called \"don\" of the PayPal Mafia\n\nPeter Thiel cofounded the company that would become Paypal — called Confinity — in 1999 alongside Max Levchin and Luke Nosek. Confinity was launched as a developer of security software for hand-held devices like the PalmPilot, but it later pivoted toward digital money transfers.\n\nThiel served as CEO of PayPal until October 2002, when eBay acquired the company for $1.5 billion. Thiel's 3.7% stake was worth a $55 million, according to SEC filings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThiel went on to cofound Founders Fund, a venture capital firm that has helped launch companies like SpaceX and Airbnb.\n\nThiel, now a billionaire with a net worth of over $11 billion, according to Bloomberg, cofounded the big data analysis firm Palantir in 2003. He was the first major outside investor in Facebook and contributed early funding to Yelp and LinkedIn, along with a number of other ventures launched by his PayPal peers. Thiel's also a partner of Founders Fund, a venture capital fund based in San Francisco.\n\nThiel has also drawn criticism in recent years for his support of President Donald Trump and for secretly funding Hulk Hogan's lawsuit against Gawker Media, which resulted in the company shutting down Gawker and selling the company's assets.\n\nAfter facilitating talks between Trump and now Sen. JD Vance, Thiel gave a record-breaking $15 million to Vance's campaign, the largest donation ever given to a single senate candidate.\n\nThiel later told The Atlantic he was taking a break from politics. Business Insider later reported that he served as an FBI informant.\n\nWhile his and Trump's relationship has reportedly soured, Trump's recent announcement of Vance as his vice president pick has put Thiel back to playing kingmaker.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMax Levchin: PayPal cofounder and Chief Technology Officer.\n\nMax Levchin is sometimes called the \"consigliere\" of the PayPal Mafia — in \"The Godfather,\" a consigliere is an advisor to the boss.\n\nLevchin made significant contributions to PayPal's anti-fraud efforts. Together with PayPal technical architect David Gausebeck, he helped create the Gausebeck-Levchin test, an early version of a CAPTCHA for commercial applications.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLevchin now serves as the CEO of Affirm.\n\nAfter PayPal was bought by eBay, Levchin founded a media-sharing service called Slide that was later bought by Google. He was also an early investor in Yelp — at one point he was the company's largest shareholder — and he served as chairman of Yelp from its founding in 2004 until July 2015.\n\nHe founded fintech company Affirm, which allows consumers to finance online purchases at the point of sale and pay for them over time. Affirm went public in 2021, raising $1.2 billion in its IPO. Levchin is also the chairman of Glow, a fertility-tracking app that helps users improve their odds of conceiving.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKen Howery: PayPal cofounder and CFO from 1998 to 2002.\n\nAfter eBay bought PayPal, Howery stayed on as eBay's director of corporate development until 2003. After PayPal's acquisition, he served as cofounder and partner of Founders Fund alongside Peter Thiel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowery recently served as US ambassador to Sweden.\n\nHe was appointed by former President Trump in January 2019 and confirmed September of that year.\n\nHowery is active in several nonprofits and serves as a founding advisor to Kiva, an organization that facilitates loans to low-income entrepreneurs. Kiva was founded in part by Premal Shah, PayPal's former product manager.\n\nHowery is reportedly still good friends with Elon Musk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElon Musk: founder of (the other) X.com, which merged with Thiel's Confinity to become PayPal\n\nIn 1999, Elon Musk founded a payments company called X.com, which merged with Thiel's Confinity in 2000. He briefly served as CEO of PayPal before he was ousted by the board in September 2000 and replaced with Thiel. But as the company's largest shareholder, he still walked away from the PayPal sale to eBay with a cool $165 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk is currently the world's richest person, per Bloomberg's Billionaires Index.\n\nPerhaps the most well known of all the members of the PayPal mafia now, Musk's estimated net worth is $270 billion.\n\nSince his PayPal days, Musk has moved on to oversee companies like Tesla, SpaceX, the Boring Company, and Neuralink. He's also bought Twitter and renamed it to X, after buying back the X.com domain name from PayPal.\n\nMusk is also publicly supporting a presidential candidate for the first time after announcing his endorsement of former President Donald Trump minutes after the assassination attempt at Trump's Pennsylvania rally. The billionaire reportedly plans to pledge $45 million each month to America PAC, which supports Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLuke Nosek: PayPal cofounder and vice president of marketing and strategy.\n\nNosek was also reportedly the person who clued in Peter Thiel to cryogenic preservation, which Thiel has since invested in heavily.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNosek explored angel investing.\n\nIn 2005, Nosek joined Thiel and Howery as a partner at Founders Fund. In 2017, Nosek left Founders Fund to launch investment firm Gigafund, which helped raise money for SpaceX.\n\nNosek invested in Musk's SpaceX and was also named a board member. He also joined the board of ResearchGate, a platform where scientists and researchers can ask questions, follow topics, and review one another's papers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoelof Botha: PayPal's director of corporate development, vice-president of finance, CFO\n\nBotha went to school to be an actuary. He said he never planned to get into tech, but when he saw the opportunity in Silicon Valley, his intuition told him it was where he needed to be.\n\nHe started as PayPal's director of corporate development, went on to become vice-president of finance, and later served as CFO.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBotha is now a partner at venture capital firm Sequoia Capital\n\nBotha is now considered one of the top tech investors in the world.\n\nSequoia Capital has has funded tech giants like Apple, Google, YouTube, and Instagram.\n\nBotha as served on the board at more than a dozen companies, including Square, EventBrite, and Weebly, 23andMe, Tumblr, Instagram, and YouTube.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReid Hoffman: board of directors at PayPal, COO\n\nLinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman served on the board of directors when PayPal was founded.\n\nHe eventually joined the company full-time as PayPal's COO. In a New York Times interview, Peter Thiel referred to Hoffman as PayPal's \"firefighter in chief,\" noting that there were many fires that needed putting out in the company's early days.\n\nWhen PayPal was acquired by eBay, Hoffman was the company's executive vice president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHoffman cofounded LinkedIn and is one of Silicon Valley's most prolific angel investors.\n\nHoffman was an early investor in Facebook, Flickr, Care.com, and many more.
