        "text": "Who owns Venmo? Acquired in 2013, PayPal has owned Venmo ever since. The company was launched in 2009 by two friends, Andrew Kortina and Iqram Magdon-Ismail; however, Venmo’s ownership has shifted ever since, at least twice, to two different companies, lastly being acquired by PayPal LLC.\n\nLike Google Pay and Cash app, Venmo is an American mobile payment app for transferring or sending money between friends and families. In 2021, Venmo processed a total of $230 billion payment and made approximately $850 million, an almost 90% increase from what it made in 2020. Venmo is currently being used by over 80 million people, most of whom are based in the United States. Although PayPal is the current owner of Venmo, it wasn’t the first to acquire the mobile paying company, as Braintree first acquired it in 2012, just three years after its launching. Less than a year later, PayPal became the owner of Braintree, indirectly becoming the owner of Venmo.\n\nInitial Owners\n\nVenmo has gone through the hands of many, as it seems. However, the initial owners of the paying app were Andrew Kortina and Iqram Magdon-Ismail, two friends who were frustrated by how traditional point-of-sale systems were. This frustration arose while they were trying to help their friend open and smoothly run her yogurt store. Here is brief information about the initial co-founders of Venmo.\n\nWho is Andrew Kortina?\n\nA co-founder of Venmo, a well-known provider of mobile payments, is Andrew Kortina. On October 3, 1984, he was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. With a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Arts in Economics, Kortina left Princeton University in 2006. After graduating, he worked as a software developer at a couple of firms until founding Venmo with his college roommate Iqram Magdon-Ismail in 2009.\n\nVenmo was primarily developed due to Kortina’s economic and computer science training. He is well knowledgeable in financial services and payment systems, as well as software development and user experience. He has also been a proponent of using technology to improve people’s financial lives and has spoken publicly about his vision for the future of payments.\n\nWho is Iqram Magdon-Ismail?\n\nIqram Magdon-Ismail is a successful businessman and entrepreneur best known for co-founding Venmo, a mobile payment service that changed how individuals send money to one another.\n\nIqram, born and reared in New York, earned an electrical and computer engineering degree from Drexel University. In 2009, he and his college classmate Wilkins Mullins co-founded Venmo after spending a few years working in the computer sector. Due to its user-friendliness and social features, which let users log transactions and share payments with friends lightheartedly, the app immediately became well-liked.\n\nIqram is a well-known speaker and supporter of entrepreneurship and his work with Venmo. He frequently makes appearances at conferences and other gatherings to talk about his experience and give tips to budding business owners. Iqram is also a community activist and philanthropist. Education, healthcare, and environmental protection are just a few of the causes and groups he supports.\n\nIqram has received various honors and recognition for his achievements as an entrepreneur and his dedication to changing the world, including his inclusion on Forbes’ 30 Under 30 list in 2012.\n\nInitial Investments\n\nThe well-known mobile payment software Venmo was initially funded and invested in by various venture capital firms and angel investors in addition to its original co-founders. Early Venmo investors include companies like:\n\nIA Ventures\n\nFounders Fund\n\nAngel investor, Dave Morin\n\nAngel investor, Zach Klien\n\nBetaworks\n\nLerer Hippeau\n\nLerer Hippeau\n\nOne of the venture capital firms that invested in Venmo was Lerer Hippeau. A venture capital company headquartered in New York, Lerer Hippeau focuses on investing early in tech startups. The company is known for funding ground-breaking and disruptive startups, and it has contributed to the expansion and development of numerous prosperous businesses, like Venmo. Venmo was launched successfully, thanks to Lerer Hippeau’s funding, ultimately resulting in its acquisition by PayPal in 2013.\n\nBetaWorks\n\nThe digital wallet and payment platform Venmo received funding from Bestwork, a private investment company. The funding allowed Venmo to reach a wider audience, enhance its products and services, and increase the number of users. Venmo could compete with other online payment systems thanks to this investment and maintain its position as a simple, practical, and safe method of money transfer and payment for goods and services.\n\nThese investors supported Venmo’s development and gave the funds it needed to expand and advance. Venmo established a strong foundation and experienced early success thanks to its early support, which ultimately resulted in its acquisition by PayPal in 2013.\n\nBraintree’s Acquisition of Venmo\n\nVenmo, a well-known mobile payment software, was purchased by Braintree, a technology business that offers online and mobile payment solutions, in 2012. The merger represented a significant turning point for both companies and had a long-lasting effect on the payment processing market.\n\nIn 2009, Andrew Kortina and Iqram Magdon-Ismail created Venmo, which quickly became well-known for its ease of use and social features. The software soon became one of the most popular mobile payment apps in the United States because it made it simple for users to split payments and share transactions with others.\n\nOn the other hand, Braintree was a technology firm that offered commercial clients internet and mobile payment options. The business was established in 2007, and has ever since a proven track record of providing its clients with creative and dependable payment options.\n\nTo increase its presence and capabilities in the mobile payment industry, Braintree bought Venmo in 2012. With Venmo providing the user interface and social features and Braintree supplying the infrastructure, the acquisition combined two complementary businesses.\n\nAs a result of the acquisition, Venmo became a subsidiary of Braintree, and the two companies continued to operate as separate entities. However, they worked closely to integrate their services and offer a comprehensive payment solution for businesses and consumers.\n\nThe acquisition of Venmo by Braintree was a significant turning point for the payment processing industry, with a lasting impact on how people pay each other. Today, Venmo remains one of the most widely used mobile payment apps in the United States, and Braintree continues to be a leading provider of online and mobile payment solutions.\n\neBay Was Once The Owner of Venmo\n\nFrom 2002 to 2015, eBay, owned by Pierre Omidyar, was the mother company and owner of PayPal, the paying app. This meant that PayPal acquired Venmo under the ownership of eBay, so the then-mother company was the owner of Venmo, Braintree, and PayPal. However, this ended when eBay and PayPal went their separate ways in 2015. This ultimately removed Venmo from the ownership of eBay to become owned only by PayPal.\n\nPayPal’s Indirect Acquisition Of Venmo\n\nPayPal, the online payment giant, expanded its mobile payment capabilities in 2013 by acquiring Braintree. Braintree was a payment platform that provided technology for mobile and web-based payment systems. At the time of acquisition, Venmo, a popular peer-to-peer payment platform, was a subsidiary of Braintree. This acquisition allowed PayPal to integrate Venmo’s platform into its system, providing a seamless and secure way for users to send and receive money.\n\nThe acquisition of Braintree and Venmo was a strategic move by PayPal, allowing the company to tap into the growing mobile payment market. Venmo’s peer-to-peer payment platform was especially appealing, as it had gained a solid following among millennials and Gen-Zers who favored its user-friendly interface and social features. By integrating Venmo into its system, PayPal could offer its users a new and innovative way to send and receive money, which ultimately helped the company stay competitive in a rapidly changing marketplace.\n\nWith Venmo’s popularity on the rise, PayPal’s acquisition of Braintree allowed the company to gain a significant foothold in the mobile payment market. Venmo’s peer-to-peer payment platform made it easy for users to split bills, pay friends, and make other transactions, all by tapping their mobile devices. This streamlined process was a significant advantage for PayPal, allowing the company to offer its users a faster and more convenient way to send and receive money.\n\nHow PayPal And Venmo Work Together\n\nPayPal, the leading online payment company, acquired Venmo in 2013. Since then, PayPal has controlled Venmo, managing its operations and determining its policies. PayPal uses its expertise and resources to make Venmo more user-friendly and secure.\n\nVenmo operates as a separate entity within the PayPal group of companies, with its branding, website, and app. However, PayPal has integrated Venmo into its ecosystem, making it easier for users to transfer funds between their Venmo accounts. This integration also provides users with a more comprehensive suite of financial services, including the ability to make payments and receive money through PayPal and Venmo, withdraw money to their bank accounts, and access their funds through debit cards linked to their accounts.\n\nPayPal has also been actively working on expanding Venmo’s reach by adding new features and partnerships to make it more accessible to a broader audience.

Additionally, PayPal has been working on expanding Venmo’s international reach, making it easier for users to send and receive money across borders.\n\nOverall, PayPal’s acquisition of Venmo has helped to bring the popular peer-to-peer payment platform to the next level. By leveraging PayPal’s expertise and resources, Venmo is now more user-friendly, secure, and accessible to a broader audience.\n\nHow Venmo Operates Under PayPal’s Ownership\n\nPayPal owns Venmo.

PayPal is a publicly traded company, and information about its largest shareholders can be obtained from various financial websites and resources. The top shareholders of PayPal and Venmo include a mix of institutional investors, mutual funds, and investment firms, such as Vanguard Group Inc., BlackRock Inc., and State Street Corporation.
