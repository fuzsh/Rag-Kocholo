        "text": "Problems checking out or paying generally fall into one of the following categories:\n\nTemporary glitch -- try again later.\n\nBrowser issue -- try another browser. Try disabling your ad blocker on checkout pages or PayPal's sign in page. If using Firefox, try disabling Enhanced Tracking Protection. Try checking out using the eBay app.\n\nDevice issue -- try another device to rule out problems with a particular device or firewall.\n\nProblem with the seller's eBay account; in some cases the seller has not set up the account to accept payment from the buyer or from the buyer's location. Particularly the case when the seller is new to selling or located in another country than the buyer. Must be fixed by the seller.\n\nProblem with the buyer's eBay or PayPal account; similar to problems with the seller's account. In some cases PayPal needs additional documentation or the accounts need to be linked or verified, or the buyer needs to create a PayPal account as there are limits to the number and amount of transactions that can be completed as a guest without registering. Must be fixed by the buyer.\n\nIf you are having problems signing in to PayPal, try disabling your ad blocker or other browser add-ons; if you are using Firefox, try disabling Enhanced Tracking Protection using the shield icon to the left of the page address. Sometimes trying another browser altogether can help.\n\nProblem with a particular payment method or card -- in that case trying a different card, or switching between using PayPal or entering a credit card into eBay's checkout might help. Also worth trying to pay using a bank account tied to a PayPal account or a cash balance in a PayPal account, if possible.\n\nProblems with PayPal involving minimum payments -- notably when total transaction is less than a dollar. In some cases, adding a donation or combining items may raise the cost above the minimum amount necessary.\n\nNetwork issue -- problems that cause an \"Access Denied\" error message are often caused by a network blockage of one kind or another. As a temporary workaround, try completing checkout using a laptop or phone when not connected to the usual wifi network. Try checking out without using a VPN.\n\nSite issue -- try checking out using ebay.ca or ebay.co.uk. If you have already committed to purchase an item, be sure to go through your Purchase History page to avoid making multiple commitments to purchase the same item on different sites.\n\nIf you are buying from multiple sellers, try to purchase from each seller individually in case a problem with one seller is holding up the transaction."
