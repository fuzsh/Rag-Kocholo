All you need to do is get the item weighed to determine how much you need to pay (a lot of larger branches have self-service tills now in addition to the manned tills, so you can do this yourself if you like), purchase the postage label you need to use and affix it to the parcel. Once that's done you can drop the parcel off, although you should retain the receipt as it will have the tracking number on it, and you will need to upload the tracking number against the item you have just posted out so as to ensure that eBay marks the item up as having been despatched."
