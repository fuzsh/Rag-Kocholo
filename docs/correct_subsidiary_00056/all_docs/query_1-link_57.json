        "text": "Challenge\n\nPayPal’s fraud rate is between 0.17 and 0.18 percent of revenue.2 While this number is well below the industry average of 1.86 percent,2 it still represents over 1 billion dollars a year in losses for the firm.\n\nTo identify emerging fraud patterns in real-time, PayPal needed to process and analyze more data faster. PayPal sought to quickly build a real-time decision-making platform that was highly effective while minimizing end-user friction. The platform merged big data with real-time processing, such as customer enrollment, payment, invoicing preferences, and profile data.\n\nScaling the amount of data processed, however, introduced challenges that included a large primary index, hundreds of petabytes of data, and a requirement to double the online transaction processing (OLTP) rate from 3.5 to 7 million transactions per second. PayPal determined that the massive amounts of data it was collecting was dragging down its existing database. The legacy database could not deliver results without a deterioration in performance. PayPal needed a cost-effective IT strategy that would allow their infrastructure to scale horizontally, while also ensuring that performance and uptime did not suffer. In 2015, they chose Aerospike and its NoSQL database system.\n\nSolution\n\nPayPal’s infrastructure supported over 4,000 database instances, 100 petabytes of data, and 32 percent data storage growth each year. However, as data volumes in its fraud decision-making platform grew each year, so did the size of the primary index. Once the memory capacity in a node was exhausted, it could no longer store new data, even if storage capacity was still available. Scaling out to additional nodes came at a significant cost, including upfront hardware costs, staff to manage the nodes, and increased power consumption. In order to keep database node counts down, PayPal continually looked for ways to increase the density per node.\n\nAerospike’s database is designed with a patented Hybrid Memory Architecture™ (HMA) that delivers a fundamentally different approach from traditional databases. To deliver predictable performance up to petabyte scale, Aerospike is built explicitly to leverage the hardware advancements of flash (SSD) storage and persistent memory instead of relying on DRAM. Using Aerospike allowed PayPal to scale with higher storage density and fast SSDs, while storing only the primary index in memory for fast data access.\n\nIn 2019, PayPal began to look at next-generation memory and storage options to increase their overall storage density and reduce their DRAM costs using Aerospike. When Intel® Optane™ persistent memory (Intel® Optane™ PMem) launched, Aerospike had already optimized its software to take advantage of the new PMem modules. Intel Optane PMem delivers a unique combination of affordable large capacity and non-volatility. 2nd Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors are designed to take advantage of Intel Optane PMem in servers.\n\nAerospike’s HMA now offers the option to store the primary index in Intel Optane PMem instead of DRAM. Since Intel Optane PMem is available in 128, 256, or 512 GB modules at a lower cost per GB than DRAM, PayPal was able to significantly increase the memory capacity of each node. With more room for the primary index, they could now build smaller clusters with denser nodes. This greatly reduced the need to scale out, while still maintaining the high performance PayPal expects.\n\nPersistence is an additional benefit PayPal gained by storing the primary index in Intel Optane PMem. With indexes in DRAM, a system restart required scanning data from storage to rebuild the index, but with indexes persisted across restarts, the entire system can now be restored and back online in a fraction of the time. Faster server restarts support PayPal’s requirements for high uptime and better reliability.\n\nMore recently, a multiyear collaboration between Intel and Aerospike has resulted in further optimizations that include the option to store data (not just indexes) in Intel Optane PMem as well.\n\nResult\n\nPayPal now has a total of 2,000 Aerospike servers, including 200 high-density servers with 2nd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors and Intel Optane PMem. The company expects continued growth, and by scaling its infrastructure with these new technologies, PayPal lowered TCO through DRAM reduction, while maintaining extremely fast application response and low latency. Additional benefits include:\n\n4X increase in storage per node (from 3.2 to 12 TB)1\n\n2X reduction in servers1\n\n30 percent reduction in costs per cluster1\n\n12X reduction in re-indexing time1\n\nBased on PayPal’s initial projected fraud data size of 50 TB in 2015 with its legacy in-memory system, the Aerospike HMA, Intel® processors, and Intel Optane PMem allowed PayPal to achieve the following:\n\n30X reduction in the number of fraud transactions missed by improving SLA adherence to 99.95% up from 98.5%1\n\n8X reduction in server footprint: from 1,024 servers down to 1201\n\nCosts reduced by 3X: USD9 million hardware cost savings projected from USD12.5 million down to USD3.5 million1\n\n5X throughput improvement: from 200K to 1M transactions per second1\n\nAs PayPal’s annual projected data is expected to grow 32 percent, Aerospike and Intel Optane PMem enable the PayPal fraud solution to cost effectively scale. PayPal can continue to meet 99.95 percent fraud calculation SLAs. PayPal also benefits from slashed node restart times, improved query performance, and data consistency, plus maintaining consistent high availability 24/7 (99.99 percent uptime).\n\nFraud prevention is an important area of investment for PayPal. The company has successfully used real-time decision-making with robust fraud prevention models for more than a decade. However, fraudsters are constantly changing their patterns and uncovering new ways to take advantage of the system. As a result, PayPal must continuously find ways to improve fraud detection accuracy and decrease fraud detection time. PayPal continues to work with Aerospike and Intel to advance approaches to detect and stop fraud with higher decision confidence."
