Acknowledgement of Country

We would like to acknowledge the Woiwurrung people of the East Kulin nations whose land we live, work and learn on every day, and whose sovereignty has never been ceded. We acknowledge and respect their continuing culture, among the oldest living cultures in human history, and the contribution they make to the life of this city and this region. We recognise their continuing connection to land, waters and culture and pay respects to Elders, past, present, and emerging.
