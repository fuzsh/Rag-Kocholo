As a teacher, I reflect on my lessons and actively seek feedback from my supervisors in order for me to effectively evaluate my teaching practice. I believe self assessment is an important aspect of the teaching profession for improved practice.

Throughout my teaching rounds I have consistently;

Personally reflected on my lessons, noting areas of strength and areas for improvement.

Sought supervisors' feedback and advice for future improvement.

Discussed my lessons with other teachers for their opinions and suggestions.

Asked supervisors for written lesson reviews so I am provided with detailed feedback that I can review for my improvement.
