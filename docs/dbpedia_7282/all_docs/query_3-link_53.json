        "text": "At this stage, we have not assigned teachers to grade levels for next year. There are no guarantees that teachers currently teaching at certain grade levels will be teaching there next year, as the leadership team need to take into consideration a range of factors including the different experience of our teaching staff and teacher preferences before this allocation is completed.\n\nThe school always sets out to create classes that have:\n\n*A balance of academic levels\n\n(children at, above and below the level)\n\n* A balanced social and behavioural mix\n\n(children who will get on well together with as little interruption as possible)\n\n*As you can imagine the process of grade placement is extremely tricky and time consuming. What is in the best interests of all our children, the school and families is paramount.\n\nProcess:\n\n* Children have been asked by their teachers to nominate children they would like to be with in 2020. During the process the teachers will ensure that every child is with at least one of these.\n\n*Classroom teachers will rank children according to ability and highlight behavioural / social concerns along with any relevant information they have gathered throughout the year. All of this information will then be used to develop the 2020 classes with the use of Class Creator, a program that assists with the formulations of balanced grades.\n\n*Specialists will check the lists for any anomalies and then the leadership team will then confirm grade placements.\n\n*In the second last week of term, children and their new teacher will have two opportunities to visit their 2020 classroom. The children and new teacher will complete an activity in this session notifying parents of their\n\nnew grade.\n\nWe do appreciate your trust in our professionalism in these regards.\n\nOn Tuesday 8th October, our girls 3/4 All Star Hoop Time team competed in Regional Finals at Mill Park Basketball Stadium. We had already lost our superstar coach in Mr. Brunelli which meant Mr. Godfrey got the call up to coach for the day. We came up against some very tough opponents and found some teams were just too strong for us. The girls never gave up and fought out all of their games to the end. The experience was invaluable and I was very proud to see the way the girls improved throughout the tournament. We were able to push some teams to their limits and be very competitive. Unfortunately we did not advance any further, but it was a great effort from all involved.\n\nCongratulations to the team on the day, Emily S, Poppy, Alba, Ainsley, Emma, Amelia and Emily B who did a great job as the emergency stepping in. Thank you also to Grace R and Maddi B for all of your efforts as part of the All Star team this year. I look forward to seeing you all back at Hoop Time tryouts in 2020!\n\nMr Ben Godfrey\n\nOn Thursday 19th September RGLPS celebrated the annual Hot Dog Footy Day. The school was awash with colour as the students showed their support for their favourite sporting teams!\n\nA competitive goal kicking competition took place at recess with prep-grade 2 students competing to kick the most amazing goals. 25 grade 3-6 students tried their luck against a strong breeze and acute angles to kick some fantastic goals!\n\nThe day concluded with the third annual ‘teachers vs students’ touch football match. In 2017 and 2018 the teachers were victorious, but with many of teachers from the star-studded teams of the past not available for selection there were nerves brewing in the staffroom. The students were full of confidence, coming off an RGLPS football District premiership for the first time in over 20 years. They were out to get the first student win with more than 30 grade 6 students putting up their hand to compete.\n\nThe game started with the students on fire, they kicked the first goal of the game and had the crowd behind them. The teachers lacked intensity and effort, they thought it was just all going to happen for them… it didn’t. The students continued to up the pressure for the next five minutes before a rumoured-to-be-injured Mr Peters entered the game and put on a performance unmatched by that of any other teacher. He was everywhere you looked, students couldn’t get the ball without worrying about Mr Peters tailing them. With the intensity lifting the teachers started to band together, Ms Lobos was intercepting everything on the half-back line. Mr Anderson was kicking goals never before seen on the football field. Ms Brewerton and Ms Lin were instrumental in stopping any attack from the students. Mrs Stavridis displayed a ferocity in her attack at the ball that would get her a game in the AFLW. Ms Wilson patrolled the forward line like a lifeguard patrols a pool, she was there for the ball every time the teachers needed her. Ms Mahon was the all-rounder showing off her newfound footy skills after the year of teaching prep PE. As usual, Mr Brunelli took all the credit without doing too much and was the self-proclaimed best-on-ground.\n\nThe students fought well, they showed all the RGL values and the teachers couldn’t be prouder of them… but it was always going to be three in a row for the teachers. Maybe next year kids?\n\n2019 International Competitions and Assessments for Schools (ICAS) Results\n\nA big congratulations to all students who participated in the online ICAS this year.\n\nThe results for Digital Technologies, Science and the Spelling Bee ICAS have now been released.

This is the ‘Light it Red for Dyslexia’ campaign, by the Code Read Dyslexia Network.\n\nThe Code Read core values are to create a better future where people impacted by dyslexia are:\n\nAcknowledged through early identification, understanding and inclusion\n\nSupported with evidence based teaching and access to assistive technology and accommodations\n\nEmpowered with equal access to opportunity (codereadnetwork.org)\n\nStatistically between 1:10 – 1:5 have some form of Dyslexia. That means in a class of 25 there would be at least 2-5 students. Early identification and team work are the key to help any Dyslexic child.\n\nFreya Wilson in 5/6F has designed and produced a ‘Dyslexic Awareness’ ribbon to help promote Dyslexia awareness this month, and to raise money for our school to purchase C-Pens. If you would like to support her cause, there are ribbons for sale at Reception. If you would like to support the Code Read Dyslexia Network donations can be made through getonboard.raisely.com ‘Rosanna Golf Links Primary School’. All money donated on this website goes towards Code Read Dyslexia Network and is a tax deduction.\n\nIf you suspect something is affecting your child’s learning you can:\n\nTalk to your child’s classroom teacher and the teacher in charge of learning support at school. Your child’s learning is a team effort.\n\nContact SPELD and get testing done.\n\nGet onto Learning difficulties Australia to find a tutor near you.\n\nAsk your child how they best learn and make a plan with your child’s classroom teacher/tutor/psychologist on how to teach/help your child learn.\n\nCelebrate your child’s successes whatever they are, and encourage them to use the unique way in which their brain as a Dyslexic works.\n\nUse the following useful sites:\n\nCode Read Network Dyslexia https://codereadnetwork.org\n\nSPELD http://www.speldvic.org.au\n\nAustralian Dyslexia Association https://dyslexiaassociation.org.au/code-read-dyslexia-network/\n\nLearning Difficulties Australia https://www.ldaustralia.org\n\nLiz Dunoon https://www.dyslexiadaily.com/blog/hi-my-name-is-liz-dunoon/\n\nhttps://thetenminutetutor.com/who-is-liz-dunoon/\n\nNESSY https://www.nessy.com\n\nFitzroy Readers https://www.fitzprog.com.au\n\nWe’re turning our event from bland to GRAND this year by adding an explosion of colour.
