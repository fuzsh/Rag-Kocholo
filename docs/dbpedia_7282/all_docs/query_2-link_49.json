        "text": "In October 2022, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, MD, released the office’s first-ever Surgeon General’s Framework for Workplace Mental Health and Well-Being.\n\nThe results of APA’s 2023 Work in America Survey confirmed that psychological well-being is a very high priority for workers themselves. Specifically:\n\n92% of workers said it is very (57%) or somewhat (35%) important to them to work for an organization that values their emotional and psychological well-being.\n\n92% said it is very (52%) or somewhat (40%) important to them to work for an organization that provides support for employee mental health.\n\n95% said it is very (66%) or somewhat (29%) important to them to feel respected at work.\n\n95% said it is very (61%) or somewhat (34%) important to them to work for an organization that respects the boundaries between work and nonwork time.\n\nFortunately, the majority (77%) of workers reported being very (36%) or somewhat (41%) satisfied with the support for mental health and well-being they receive from their employers, and more than half (59%) strongly (22%) or somewhat (37%) agreed that their employer regularly provides information about available mental health resources. Further, 72% of workers strongly (30%) or somewhat (42%) agreed that their employer helps employees develop and maintain a healthy lifestyle.\n\nOne female, full-time employee from the West summed up her positive workplace experience as follows:\n\nMy direct supervisor is amazing at respecting time boundaries and being mindful of my workload. He encourages me to manage my schedule in a way that is best for my wellness.\n\nImprovements are still needed\n\nAlthough some survey results show positive developments, the data also reveal the need for improvements. In fact, 55% of workers strongly (21%) or somewhat (34%) agreed that their employer thinks their workplace environment is a lot mentally healthier than it actually is, and 43% reported worrying that if they told their employer about a mental health condition, it would have a negative impact on them in the workplace.\n\nWorkplace stress also remains at a concerning level, with 77% of workers having reported experiencing work-related stress in the last month. Further, 57% indicated experiencing negative impacts because of work-related stress that are sometimes associated with workplace burnout, such as:\n\nemotional exhaustion (31%)\n\ndidn’t feel motivated to do their very best (26%)\n\na desire to keep to themselves (25%)\n\na desire to quit (23%)\n\nlower productivity (20%)\n\nirritability or anger with coworkers and customers (19%)\n\nfeelings of being ineffective (18%)\n\nSurvey data show that many workers are not getting the breaks from this stress that they both need and want. Only about one-third (35%) reported that their employer offers a culture where breaks are encouraged. Only two-fifths (40%) reported that their employer offers a culture where time off is respected, and only 29% reported that their employer offers a culture where managers encourage employees to take care of their mental health.\n\nThe reality of workplace mental health supports\n\nOnly 43% reported that their employer offers health insurance with coverage for mental health and substance use disorders.\n\nOnly about one-third (35%) reported that their employer offers a culture where breaks are encouraged.\n\nOnly 29% reported that their employer offers an employee assistance program.\n\nOnly 21% reported that their employer offers meeting-free days.\n\nOnly 17% reported that their employer offers 4-day work weeks.\n\nOnly 15% reported that their employer offers company-wide mental health days.\n\nOnly 12% reported that their employer has people on-site who have received mental health training.\n\nFor employers, a failure to provide the mental health and well-being support that workers are seeking could harm talent recruitment and retention. Among workers overall, 33% said they intend to look for a new job at a different company or organization in the next year. Among those workers who said they are unsatisfied with the mental health and well-being support offered by their employer, that number rose to 57%.\n\nPsychological science informed the development of the conceptual framework for the U.S. Surgeon General’s Framework for Workplace Mental Health and Well-Being. The framework emphasizes the foundational role that workplaces should play in promoting the psychological health and well-being of workers and our communities as a whole, and lays out five essentials for pursuing workplace mental health and well-being:\n\nProtection from harm (including security and safety)\n\nConnection and community (including social support and belonging)\n\nWork-life harmony (including autonomy and flexibility)\n\nMattering at work (including dignity and meaning)\n\nOpportunity for growth (including learning and accomplishment)\n\nAPA’s 2023 Work in America Survey tracks the surgeon general’s five essentials, as well as the central core principles of worker voice and equity, all with an eye toward promoting an equitable, productive, and psychologically healthy future of work.\n\nThe majority (59%) of those who were not at all or not very satisfied with their job described their workplace as toxic. Further, 58% of those who reported a toxic workplace also reported that they intend to look for a new job at a different company or organization in the next year, compared with only 27% of those who did not report a toxic workplace.\n\nToxic workplaces are associated with diminished psychological well-being\n\nThose who reported a toxic workplace were more than twice as likely to report that their overall mental health was fair or poor (58%) than those who did not report a toxic workplace (21%). Likewise, more than three-quarters (76%) of those who reported a toxic workplace also reported that their work environment has a negative impact on their mental health, compared with fewer than one-third (28%) of those who did not report a toxic workplace.\n\nThose who reported a toxic workplace were more than three times as likely to report having experienced harm to their mental health at work, compared with those who did not report a toxic workplace (52% vs. 15%, respectively). In addition, 77% of those who reported a toxic workplace also reported that their employer thinks their workplace environment is mentally healthier than it actually is, compared with 49% who did not report a toxic workplace.\n\nToo many customer/client/patient service providers are experiencing some form of verbal abuse at work\n\nAlmost one-quarter (24%) of respondents said someone within or outside their organization had yelled at or verbally abused them at work within the past 12 months. More than a quarter of those who work in person reported some form of verbal abuse (26%), which is significantly more than those who work remotely (18%). In addition, close to one-third (31%) of those who do customer/client/patient service reported some form of verbal abuse, compared with just under one-quarter of manual laborers (23%) and office workers (22%) who reported the same.\n\nLikewise, close to one in five (19%) reported having experienced bullying at work. Unfortunately, the percentage was significantly higher among those living with a disability (27%) than among those without a disability (15%). And when it comes to physical violence, approximately one in 10 manual laborers (12%) reported that someone within their organization displayed physical violence toward them, whereas about one in 20 office workers (5%) reported the same.\n\nDiscrimination in the workplace is still common\n\nFundamental to the surgeon general’s framework is the principle that employees should be protected from discriminatory workplace practices. However, more than one in five (22%) indicated witnessing discrimination in their current workplace and 15% reported experiencing discrimination. In addition, nearly one-third (28%) reported having witnessed slights, insults, or jokes that devalued the identity or negated the thoughts and feelings of others based on their identity or background. Further, 19% said they were targets of such behaviors.\n\nThe discrimination being experienced was not limited to race, ethnicity, or gender. For example, one respondent, a full-time, female employee from the South, stated that the aspects of her job that have a negative impact on her overall happiness, mental health and well-being are:\n\nAge discrimination, no room for growth, favoritism.\n\nMost workers are generally satisfied with their workplace relationships\n\nEncouragingly, 89% of respondents said they are very or somewhat satisfied with their relationships with their coworkers, and 86% indicated they are very or somewhat satisfied with their relationships with their managers or supervisors.\n\nSimilarly, 82% said their workplace fosters positive relationships among coworkers, and 79% indicated that their workplace fosters positive relationships between managers and the people they manage. Moreover, most workers (81%) indicated that their workplace provides opportunities for collaboration and teamwork.\n\nUnfortunately, one in five (20%) strongly or somewhat disagreed with the statement, “when I’m at work, I feel like I belong.” Black (23%) and Hispanic (22%) workers were more likely to feel a lack of belonging than their Asian (14%) colleagues.\n\nInterestingly, only 10% of upper management employees did not feel a sense of belonging, compared with 19% of individual contributors, 22% of middle management, and 25% of front-line workers. This finding raises the question of whether it may be difficult for those in upper management to understand and relate to the lack of belonging felt by a quarter of front-line workers.\n\nCertain groups feel unsupported because of their identities\n\nClose to one-third (30%) of workers said they feel their workplace does not support them because of an aspect of their identity, such as race/ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, ability status, age, etc.\n\nThis perceived lack of support was more common among workers ages 18–25 (45%) and 26–43 (34%), compared with workers who were 44 and older (11%–25%). Black and Hispanic workers were more likely to report feeling a lack of support from their employers (39% and 34%, respectively) than their White (27%) counterparts. In addition, the perceived lack of support due to identity was higher in LGBTQ+ workers (38%) compared with non-LGBTQ+ workers (29%).\n\nMany workers are achieving satisfactory work-life harmony, but there is too little respect for time off\n\nThe surgeon general defines work-life harmony as the integration of work and nonwork demands through the human needs of autonomy and flexibility. Work-life harmony involves, among other things, the amount of control one has over the “how, when, and where” one does their work.\n\nWork-life harmony is associated with psychological well-being\n\nApproximately eight out of 10 respondents (81%) reported being either very (42%) or somewhat (40%) satisfied with the amount of control they have over how, when, and where they do their work. Importantly, those who reported satisfaction with their level of control were much more likely to report that their overall mental health level is good or excellent (79%) compared with those who reported being unsatisfied with their level of control (44%).\n\nSimilarly, those who reported satisfaction with their level of control were much less likely to report that their work environment has a negative impact on their mental health (32%) compared with those who reported being unsatisfied with their level of control (62%).\n\nWork-life harmony also involves having enough flexibility to mitigate conflicts between work and home life. Workers who said they did not have the flexibility to keep their work and personal life in balance were more likely to report that their work environment had a negative impact on their mental health (67%) compared with those who did have that flexibility (23%).\n\nWhen asked to list two or three things about her current job that have a positive impact on her mental health, happiness, and well-being, one female, full-time worker from the South stated:\n\nI have control over my day-to-day activities and can set my own agenda for each day. There is paid sick leave if I need it. There is time off for holidays where I can rest and rejuvenate myself.\n\nCertain job characteristics and demographics are associated with work-life harmony\n\nThose who work in hybrid or remote arrangements were more likely to be satisfied with the how, when, and where they do their work (85% and 89%, respectively) than those who work in person (77%). Remote workers reported being slightly more likely to have enough flexibility at work to be able to keep their work life and personal life balance (75%) than hybrid (67%) or in-person workers (66%). Further, those ages 18–25 are more likely to agree that they do not have enough flexibility at work to be able to keep their work life and personal life in balance compared with those in older generations (41% vs. 26% of workers 44–57, 28% of workers 58–64, and 24% of workers 65+).\n\nOther workplace and personal characteristics were also associated with satisfaction with the how, when, and where work is done. For example, office workers were more likely to be satisfied (86%) than those in manual labor (77%) or customer/client/patient service (76%). Those at for-profit organizations were more likely to be satisfied (83%) than those at nonprofit organizations (73%). Those in upper management were more likely to be satisfied (93%) than those in middle management (81%), front-line workers (76%), or individual contributors (78%). Finally, those living with a disability were less likely (77%) than those without a disability (84%) to be satisfied with this aspect of work.\n\nToo many workers experience a lack of respect for their time off\n\nUnfortunately, more than one-quarter (26%) of respondents strongly or somewhat agreed with the statement, “my employer does not respect my personal boundaries.” Further, fewer than half of respondents (40%) reported that their employer offers a culture where time off is respected. Those who do office work were almost twice as likely (48%) than those who do manual labor (25%) to report respect for time off.\n\nSimilarly, a female, part-time employee from the West said:\n\nRespecting my boundaries and not calling me on my two days off to come in to work just because they need a body. I need those two days for personal reasons and will not budge. Also they are flexible if I need time off for doctor appointments and things like that.\n\nTammy Allen, PhD, a psychology professor at the University of South Florida in Tampa, offers advice regarding how employees should respond if their employer wants them to check email on their personal time or vacation.\n\n“Expectations should be aligned with the nature of the job and based on a mutual understanding between the employee and the boss. If the understanding is violated (e.g., you’ve agreed upon no emails on Sundays and the boss consistently expects emails to be answered on Sundays), then a discussion about realignment may be needed. You can discuss the importance of establishing boundaries and the importance of detachment from work to enable recovery from work for your health and well-being, which allows you to be at your best for the organization.”\n\nRead more: Workers crave autonomy and flexibility in their jobs\n\nWorkers want to matter at work and want their work to have meaning\n\nThe surgeon general points out that people want to know they matter to those around them, which includes a sense of dignity and meaning. Indeed, 95% of respondents said that it is somewhat or very important to them to feel respected at work.\n\nMattering at work and meaningful work are associated with psychological well-being\n\nFortunately, 78% strongly or somewhat agreed with the statement, “I feel valued at work” and 87% strongly or somewhat agreed with the statement, “the work I do is meaningful.”\n\nThose who reported not having meaningful work were much more likely to report that they were typically tense or stressed out during their workday (71%) than those who reported having meaningful work (45%).\n\nWorkers want and need opportunities for growth\n\nThis essential from the surgeon general’s framework is based on the human needs for learning and accomplishment. These needs are consistent with the survey results. The overwhelming majority of workers (91%) said it was very or somewhat important to them to have a job where they consistently have opportunities to learn, and 94% said it was very or somewhat important to them to have a job where they get a sense of accomplishment.\n\nAlthough most workers are satisfied with their opportunities for growth, there is room for improvement\n\nAlmost three-quarters of respondents (74%) indicated they are very or somewhat satisfied with the opportunities for growth and development at their place of work. Over three-quarters of respondents (79%) said that they are very or somewhat satisfied with the opportunities they have to be innovative or creative in their work. More than two-thirds (70%) strongly or somewhat agreed with the statement, “I feel I can reach my highest potential at my current place of work.”\n\nOpportunities for growth are associated with psychological well-being\n\nWorkers who were somewhat or very satisfied with their opportunities for growth and development more often reported good or excellent mental health (79%) than those who were unsatisfied (52%). Further, workers who lacked opportunities for growth and advancement were also more likely to typically feel tense and stressed out during their workday (66% vs. 42%).\n\nCertain demographic and organizational characteristics associated with satisfaction regarding opportunities for growth and development\n\nMen were more likely to report being satisfied with growth and development opportunities (77%) than women (71%). Higher-income workers ($125,000+) also were more likely to report satisfaction with growth and development opportunities (79%) than workers making less than $50,000 (68%).\n\nWorkers in for-profit settings were more likely to report satisfaction with growth and development opportunities (76%) than those in nonprofit organizations (65%). Those who reported working for an organization with equity, diversity, and inclusion policies were more likely to report being satisfied with opportunities for growth and development (78%) than those in organizations without such policies (64%). Those who reported working for an organization with racial or ethnic diversity in senior leadership were more likely to report being satisfied with opportunities for growth and development than those in organizations without such diversity (77% vs. 68%, respectively).\n\nOverall, those who were satisfied with their opportunities for growth and development were far more likely to report being very or somewhat satisfied with their jobs (96%) than those who were not (64%).\n\nThe research was conducted online in the United States by The Harris Poll on behalf of APA among 2,515 employed adults. The survey was conducted April 17–27, 2023.\n\nData are weighted where necessary by age, gender, race/ethnicity, region, education, marital status, household size, full-time/part-time employment, employment sector, industry, household income, and propensity to be online to bring them in line with their actual proportions in the population.\n\nRespondents for this survey were selected from among those who have agreed to participate in our surveys. The sampling precision of Harris online polls is measured by using a Bayesian credible interval. For this study, the sample data is accurate to within ±3.1 percentage points using a 95% confidence level. This credible interval will be wider among subsets of the surveyed population of interest.\n\nAll sample surveys and polls, whether or not they use probability sampling, are subject to other multiple sources of error which are most often not possible to quantify or estimate, including, but not limited to coverage error, error associated with nonresponse, error associated with question wording and response options, and postsurvey weighting and adjustments."
