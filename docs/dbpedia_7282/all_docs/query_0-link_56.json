        "text": "Banks should consider document type, purpose, relevant issues\n\nBy Scott Birrenkott\n\nQ: What Name Should Banks Use for Customers When Completing Documents?\n\nA: The name that should appear, and be signed, on documents depends on a few things. Primarily, the type of documents being signed, the purpose for which the customer’s name is appearing, and any relevant rules.\n\nTypically, a customer has a single, consistent name which will appear on documents, disclosures, and other communications and match their signature. However, there are scenarios where this is not the case. A customer might use inconsistent capitalization, or go by different names, such as a “nickname,” or perhaps use their middle initial in some situations, or a “Jr.” or “Sr.” designation. There may also be situations where a customer changes their name, either because of a marriage, or other situation — such as a change in identity or gender transition — and a change from an individual’s “deadname.”\n\nBanks should consider how various types of documentation can be affected. For example, if opening a checking account, the specimen signature is important to verifying transactions on the account. If a customer provides a specimen signature which does not match the signature they intend to use on checks, that can result in a question as to whether certain items are authorized. For this reason, the signature card should match the name the customer intends to use when authorizing transactions and should be updated if a change occurs.\n\nWhen entering into a contract, best practice would be using the customer’s legal name, as provided by customer. The customer should sign in a manner by which they intend to be bound. There are no specific standards for a signature, other than that it reflects the party’s intent to be bound. For example, a customer might sign in a manner different from the way their name otherwise appears on documentation, such as whether they use a middle initial in their signature or not. Or how they capitalize their signature, or whether they are able to sign their name at all and perhaps can only make a mark or symbol such as a checkmark or “X.”\n\nBanks must consider whether the documents properly identify its customer, and whether the signature affixed to the document reflects a valid contract. In this regard, it is ultimately a matter of policy and preference, but a best practice recommendation would be for the bank to be consistent in how the name appears throughout all the documentation, and the signature itself.\n\nHowever, when it comes to Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) financing statements, there are specific rules which must be followed. This article does not delve into the specifics, but banks should consider that for filing UCC financing statements, the filing should reflect the debtor’s exact name as required by Wis. Stat. section 409.503.\n\nFor any questions regarding customer names, accuracy of UCC financing statements, or other topics, contact WBA legal.

As the largest gathering of bank leaders in the state, this year’s event will focus on bringing leaders “All In” for the benefit of their bank, community members, and industry.\n\nExecutive-Level Education\n\nEach year, WBA’s Bank Executives Conference is regarded as the state’s premier gathering of banking professionals and national experts — the 2023 event\n\nwill be no different!\n\nIn combining programming tailored to the specific needs of banking leaders in Wisconsin with various trending topics sure to impact our industry, bankers will have the opportunity to arm themselves with the resources and knowledge to remain relevant and resilient for years to come.\n\nThis year’s opening general session on February 9 will feature Virginia Heyburn, director of research, insights, and advocacy at Engage fi, LLC. As innovation and technology remain at the forefront of our industry’s efforts to engage individuals in the financial services, Heyburn will highlight the possibilities of FinTech partnerships as banks look to develop new revenue channels and reach customers in today’s world of rapidly changing competition.\n\nAfter the general session, WBA will host its first FinTech Showcase. Bankers can expect to see eight FinTech products, ranging from solutions for digital banking and artificial intelligence (AI) to security, demonstrated live by various companies including Accrue, La Macchia Group, DocFox Inc., Kapitalwise, Inc., KlariVis, LemonadeLXP, Sequertek, and Zogo Finance. Following short presentations, bankers will have the opportunity to connect with these exhibitors, and more than 60 others, to learn more about their solutions and how FinTech will bring the bank into the future.\n\nOn Friday, February 10, four-time bestselling author and renowned futurist, Brett King will present the keynote session “The Big Shift: How Customer Behavior & Technology Will Change the Future of Retail Financial Service.” King, voted as American Banker’s Innovator of the Year in 2012 and a regular contributor to The Huffington Post, will highlight why customer behavior is so rapidly changing and why banks must reinvent themselves or face irrelevancy.\n\nWith over ten hours of general and breakout sessions spread across the three days — there will certainly be something of interest for every bank leader. For more details on programming and to view the full agenda, please visit wisbank.com/bec.\n\nNetworking\n\nAttendees will also have various opportunities to connect with their banking peers, WBA Associate Members, and WBA staff throughout the conference.\n\nIn addition to kicking off the conference on Wednesday evening with a networking reception in the exhibitor Marketplace, bankers are invited to arrive early on February 8 for various “banker-only” peer group discussions. The optional peer groups, beginning at 2:30 p.m., are specifically targeted at CEOs, CFOs, credit and lending professionals, and those in operations.\n\nRecognition\n\nWBA looks forward to recognizing various bankers who have been “All In” for their communities and for their industry — despite the unpredictability of the last several years.\n\nIn selecting the unifying theme “All In” for this year’s conference, the Association recognizes that the unity and commitment leaders and bankers across the state have, and will continue to, demonstrate are critical to the prosperity of the industry and communities all WBA-member banks serve. In this, it is important that bankers not only reflect upon their successes of the past year but look ahead to what possibilities are in store.\n\nThe conference will feature a special luncheon on February 9 during which several bankers who have dedicated a lifetime of service to the industry will be inducted into WBA’s 50- and 60-Year Clubs. In addition, the Wisconsin Banker Foundation (WBF), the Association’s non-profit arm, will present its prestigious Financial Education Innovation Award to a WBA-member bank that, during the 2021–2022 fiscal year, demonstrated unique efforts to enhance the financial capability of consumers in their community.\n\nThat evening, WBA will recognize a bank CEO or president (or an individual who has recently retired from these positions) who has made an outstanding effort throughout their career in service to their bank, to their community, and to the banking profession as the 2022 Banker of the Year.\n\nRegistration\n\nBanking leaders regularly prove their commitment to our industry by way of their active involvement, efforts to embrace evolution, and often tenure of service. WBA’s Bank Executive Conference builds upon these important steps by providing bankers with resources, connections, and ideas for action.\n\nRegistration for WBA’s annual conference is open now!

We look forward to seeing you Wednesday, February 8–Friday, February 10 at the Kalahari Convention Center in Wisconsin Dells!\n\nWisconsin REALTORS® Association\n\nBy Michael Theo, WRA President and CEO\n\nWith insights from Dave Clark, economist with Marquette University\n\nAfter two straight years of record home sales, the Wisconsin existing home market slowed significantly in 2022. This was a result of both declining demand and continued weak housing supply. Demand slowed in part because the economy weakened slightly in the first half of the year. Specifically, the real (inflation adjusted) GDP fell 1.6% in Q1 of 2022, and it slowed 0.6% in Q2 before rebounding by 2.9% in the third quarter. Still, the labor market remained at full employment which likely presented the National Bureau of Economic Research from classifying the slowdown as an official recession. What really slowed demand was the rapid decline in housing affordability. In October of 2021, a Wisconsin buyer with median family income qualified to buy 201% of the median priced home in the state, assuming a 20% down payment and the remainder financed by a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at the rates that existed at that time. Just 12 months later, that same buyer would only qualify to purchase 136% of the median priced home. Although median family income was estimated to have grown by 6.2% over that 12-month period, that was offset by a 6.1% increase in the median housing price, and a more than doubling of the 30-year fixed rate mortgage, from 3.07% in October 2021 to 6.90% in October 2022. Weakness on the supply side only exacerbated the problem with total listings in October 2022 down 24% compared to that same month in 2021. Overall, through the first 10 months of 2022, home sales were off their 2021 pace by 11.2%. Even though sales have weakened significantly, this remains a strong sellers’ market with just 2.6 months of available supply in October 2022, which is well below the six-month benchmark that signals a balanced housing market.\n\nOne reason the mortgage rate rose so quickly is because inflationary expectations, which lenders must consider when extending long-term credit to homebuyers, have increased in the past year. That is, inflation is no longer viewed as transitory. As a result, the Fed has taken decisive action to slow the economy and reduce inflation. The Fed’s primary tool to slow inflation is to increase the short-term federal funds rate, which is the rate that member banks lend to each other to cover overnight reserve shortfalls. Specifically, the upper limit of the federal funds target range rose from near zero (i.e., 0.25%) at the beginning of 2022 to 4% by early November. The good news is that there has been some slight improvement in headline inflation, which peaked in June 2022 at 9.1% and fell to 7.7% by October. Hopefully that trend continues. Still, inflation remains well above the Fed’s target inflation rate of 2% and the Fed has indicated that it intends to keep raising short term rates until inflation is under control, even if its actions lead to recession. Given that the U.S. and Wisconsin labor markets are currently at full employment (i.e., both were under continue its upward movement of the federal funds rate. Until inflationary expectations are lowered, mortgage rates will remain elevated and affordability will remain low. This, combined with tight inventories, will constrain the housing market in 2023.\n\nNationally, policymakers need to maintain their focus on the inflation problem. Clearly the Fed is committed to controlling inflation, but Congress and the Biden Administration need to avoid exacerbating the inflation problem through irresponsible spending practices. While there is little that local policymakers can do to stimulate the demand side of the housing market, they can help set the stage for new construction once the housing sector begins to improve. This includes lowering the regulatory burden and helping to foster growth in training in the building trades.\n\nFounded in 1909, the Wisconsin REALTORS® Association (WRA) is one of the largest trade associations in Wisconsin. It represents and provides services to more than 15,000 members statewide. WRA’s goal is to promote the advancement of real estate in Wisconsin and provide cutting-edge tools to help REALTORS® enjoy a successful career and be competitive in their market.\n\nWisconsin Grocers Association\n\nBy Brandon Scholz, WGA President and CEO\n\nFor grocers, it has been an incredible gauntlet from the beginnings of the pandemic in 2022 to the peek over the 2023 precipice.\n\nThe challenges created for grocers and their suppliers as the pandemic lodged itself into the daily business operations have only continued to create hurdles for the industry.\n\nAs most grocery store shoppers know, not all shelves are full of their favorite products — shoppers have had to deal with substitutes or alternatives.\n\nThroughout all these topsy-turvy, head-spinning challenges, there is one common denominator that bears most of the blame for what drives grocers crazy.\n\nWorkforce.\n\nSimply put, there are not enough people available to fill the jobs open today, nor in the years to come. Reports have suggested the workforce population in Wisconsin is flat and likely to decline. Forward Analytics notes Wisconsin’s youth population has declined 4.3% since 2010 and says a decline in the state’s under-18 population will causes economic problems. That same report forecasts that by 2030, the working population will be down by 130,000 people.\n\nGrocers, convenience stores, and retail businesses report there simply is not a pool of people in the workforce that can fill the gaps. And, for those who want to suggest otherwise that all is good because unemployment is low and UI applications are down, that’s not necessarily the case.\n\nThere are all sorts of reasons why the workforce is running on empty. During the pandemic, people chose not to work; were let go by employers who couldn’t keep their doors open; received state and federal assistance to make up for their non-employment status; as well as other factors.\n\nConfounding the employment factor is the regressive impact of inflation that has chewed up most all the incredible and eye-popping increasing in wages and benefits.\n\nRolling into 2022, with the government giving assurances that the economy was in good shape (inflation not withstanding), the expectations were that people would come back to their jobs, or any job.\n\nNot so. Didn’t happen. Not only did people not show up, but the pool of prospective employees was more like a very small pond.\n\nThe forecast for 2023 doesn’t look much better. You may find grocers taking down a checkout lane and adding a self-checkout stand to help their customers move through the end of their shopping experience.\n\nWhat’s the solution? Wisconsin needs to bring people back to Wisconsin to work here. The question is how.\n\nLet’s target quality of life issues in Wisconsin and focus legislative, employer, and community efforts on several key areas. Good businesses, strong communities, safe streets and less crime, daycare, housing, public transportation, and good schools are key components of attracting new workers to Wisconsin.\n\nThese changes will require funding solutions, regulatory relief, and legislative initiatives in local, county, and state governments.\n\nGrocers and their customers are resilient. They’ve proved it since the pandemic started. It doesn’t mean that things are hunky dory, but we’re approaching critical mass. Changes must be made to solve our workforce crisis.\n\nWinsight Grocery Business notes that inflation, technological advances, and the pandemic have influenced grocery shopper habits. It’s a common sight to see shoppers using smartphones to look up sales, product information, loyalty apps, and more.\n\nWhile these changes have become common place for the customer, they are not long-term solutions for the retail world.\n\nIt starts with the workforce and quality of life.\n\nThe Wisconsin Grocers Association represents nearly 1,000 independent grocers, retail grocery chain stores, warehouses and distributors, convenience stores, food brokers, and suppliers. Wisconsin grocers employ over 50,000 people with more than $1 billion in payroll and generates more than $12 billion in annual sales in Wisconsin resulting in approximately more than $800 million in state sales tax revenue.

At the same time, Wisconsin hospitals and health systems, 95% of which are nonprofit, continue providing a variety of services and filling social and public health gaps across the state, but ongoing strains on resources, finances, and workforce are posing unprecedented challenges to fulfilling these missions.\n\nWell-documented burnout caused job vacancy rates to increase in 13 of 17 Wisconsin hospital professions in 2021, by double digits in seven of those. Higher vacancies have forced hospitals to increasingly rely on very costly temporary staffing. According to the American Hospital Association, hospitals’ use of contract temporary labor increased 132% for full-time and 131% for part-time staff last year.\n\nAs reported in our 2022 Workforce Report, citizens over the age of 55 make up 28% of the country’s population but account for 57% of health care spending — trends mirrored here. As health care needs increase with the aging population, demand for Wisconsin’s health care workforce will also increase while its supply is expected to diminish. An aging population also means more health care is covered by Medicare, which reimburses Wisconsin hospitals at 23% below what it costs to provide care. Medicare now comprises nearly 50% of Wisconsin hospitals’ “payer mix” and is growing.\n\nThe CDC estimates that 41% of U.S. adults either delayed or avoided non-COVID medical care during the early stages of the pandemic. Patient volumes have rebounded since their COVID-induced plunge in 2020, but many of those patients are sicker, more resource- and cost-intensive with longer, often unreimbursed, lengths of stay.\n\nHospitals are not immune to the impacts of historic inflation, which has caused sharp spikes in labor, drugs, and medical supplies costs. Wisconsin hospitals have experienced a $580 million annual increase in labor costs and $1.6 billion annual increase in supply costs since 2019. We reported in October that supplies and services remain the largest expenses for Wisconsin hospitals, up 14.7% since 2019. The ability to simply recoup these costs by raising prices has essentially disappeared, yet health insurance premiums continue rising. According to a recant Kaiser analysis, in the past year, the CPI for hospital services rose 3.4%, compared to 7.7% for all good and services and a whopping 20.6% for health insurance.\n\nSoaring inflation coupled with diminished resources caused drastic declines in Wisconsin hospital and health system operating margins in the first half of 2022, falling to 0.4%. Total margins dropped well into the red at -11.9%.\n\nDespite these new realities, Wisconsin’s hospitals remain committed to delivering quality care for everyone, while still subsidizing negative margin services (hospice, home health, behavioral health, long term care, others) that would not otherwise exist in many communities. Responsible stewardship has helped Wisconsin hospitals manage through the pandemic, but its lingering damage is posing serious and ongoing challenges.\n\nEstablished in 1920, Wisconsin Hospital Association (WHA) advocates on behalf of its 140-plus member hospitals and health systems to enable the delivery of high-quality, high-value care across Wisconsin.

For the construction industry, the hope is that 2023 will bring an increase in owner confidence to invest in construction projects, lower interest rates to make project financing possible, leveling of material prices and availability to minimize bid price increases and material delays, and an ample supply of employees, willing and able to work building Wisconsin.\n\nIn 2022, U.S. total construction starts rose 11% (through September) with increases in all major sectors: private residential 13%, private nonresidential 11%, and public sector, including transportation, 7%. The Architectural Billing Index for September reflects that architectural billings are up slightly over 2021, a good sign of new projects to come, and the Dodge Momentum Index is up over 25% from October 2021. Manufacturing, water supply, and commercial construction saw the largest increases in 2022 with power, office, and transportation at levels lower than or equal to 2021. As historical trends demonstrate, growth in the different construction segments can vary widely each year. In 2023, federal funding is anticipated to spur growth in some markets that were down this past year.\n\nTransportation, manufacturing, and energy projects are forecasted to be strong in 2023 due in part to three major investments made at the national level. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) signed in November 2021 authorized an additional $550 billion above baseline infrastructure spending to fund the interconnected transportation network and supports expansion of broadband, bridge repair, and clean energy transmission and power upgrades. The Chips+ Act funds investment in domestic manufacturing of semiconductors. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 includes a major expansion of tax credits (and direct payments to municipalities, non-profits, and tribes) for investment in projects that increase energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions.\n\nDespite the ongoing concerns about a housing shortage, particularly for accessible housing, it is forecasted that both multi-family and single-family housing will fall for at least the first half of 2023 due to rising interest rates. The post-pandemic shift from retail to e-commerce and office work to employee preference for hybrid work leaves ongoing uncertainty in the retail and office sectors but leads to increased demand for e-commerce/distribution and decentralized office locations.\n\nThe availability and cost of building materials in 2022 was particularly challenging for contractors as they strived to keep bid price increases at a minimum. Between April 2020 and September 2022, steel increased 91%, plastic construction products 56%, and copper and brass mill shapes 54%. While these increases in construction inputs are remarkably high, the good news is that the prices have been rapidly falling since Q1 of 2022, giving optimism to contractors and owners alike. While material costs and supply chain challenges increased between April 2020 and April 2022, they are stabilizing; unlike the challenge of finding workers. Wisconsin, like the rest of the Midwestern states, has close to no population growth, making worker shortages once again the #1 challenge for construction, and every other industry.\n\nWisconsin’s construction industry contributes not only to the quality of life we enjoy but is an important stimulator for the economy. Every $1 spent within the construction industry produces an economic impact of $1.81. Every $1 million spent within the construction industry generates 12 jobs on average (7 within construction and 5 in other sectors) and over $690,000 in wages. We look to 2023 with optimism and are prepared to work with other industry leaders as we Build Wisconsin Together.\n\nThe Construction Business Group promotes and protects the construction industry. We ensure fair contracting laws are followed on public construction projects. We work cooperatively with contractors, employees and public entities by educating them on fair contracting laws, monitoring projects for fair contracting compliance, and identifying and helping to resolve compliance issues.\n\nWisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce\n\nBy Kurt R. Bauer, WMC President and CEO\n\n2022 felt a lot like the Carter years of the late 1970s. That period was marked by runaway inflation, spiking interest rates, high crime, energy insecurity, and the Cold War. Add to the mix a lingering governmental legitimacy crisis caused by Watergate, and the blow to both our national psyche and international prestige caused by the Iranian hostage crisis (and the failure of the Desert One rescue mission).\n\nAll of the above created a widespread belief that America was in decline.\n\nI see a lot of parallels to what happened then and what is happening now. For example:\n\nInflation is the highest it has been since the 1970s;\n\nInterest rates are rising; Crime is rampant in big cities;\n\nThe cost of energy is way up and its reliability is in question;\n\nWe face a new Cold War with not only Russia, but with China as well;\n\nDistrust in government and other institutions is way up; and\n\nWe saw an incredibly chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\nThe difference between 40 years ago and now is that many of the problems we face today are self-inflicted by wrongheaded policies. When President Carter gave his “malaise speech” in 1979, the U.S. didn’t have the technology to affordably extract oil and gas from the vast deposits of shale found in North America, which meant we were at the mercy of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\n\nHydraulic fracturing changed all that and as a result, the U.S. was a net exporter of oil and gas in 2019 and 2020. But, not today because the Biden Administration’s energy policy is to rapidly (I would argue recklessly) transition away from fossil fuels by thwarting the investment, exploration, extraction, refinement, and transportation of domestically produced coal, oil, and natural gas. As a result, energy prices are rising, which drives inflation because energy is the common ingredient in everything that is made, grown, and transported. That is why energy is often referred to as the master resource. Without reliable and affordable energy, countries cannot prosper. The U.S. is no exception.\n\nWhat we are doing is unprecedented. In the history of the world, I can’t think of another nation that had access within its borders to an incredibly valuable natural resource, but decided not to use it. Instead, the U.S. is begging other nations, including unfriendly and/or autocratic regimes like Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, to sell us the energy we are capable of producing ourselves. Not to mention that the U.S. is dependent on China for the production of much of what goes into or otherwise constitutes “green” energy, like batteries, wind turbines, and solar panels.\n\nLooking ahead, I am not optimistic because if you keep doing what you are doing, you are going to keep getting what you got. According to Gallup, 81% of Americans said before last fall’s mid-term elections that they were dissatisfied with the direction of the country. Despite that, President Biden’s party performed unexpectedly well, which will embolden him to stay the course.\n\nAs a result, energy inflation could very well tip the U.S. into a recession in 2023. It will certainly continue to hurt Wisconsin’s two signature industries — manufacturing and agriculture — because both consume a lot of energy.\n\nOddly, the saving grace may be the workforce shortage. As has been well documented, Wisconsin has a demographically induced labor shortage caused by a combination of several decades of below replacement birthrates and outmigration patterns.\n\nI recently asked an economist from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago if there can be a recession without a spike in the jobless rate. The economist smiled wryly and answered with an emphatic no. So even with high inflation, tangled supply chains, and rising interest rates, unemployment in Wisconsin is only 3.3%, up slightly from a record low of 2.8% last spring.\n\nIt’s a paradox. The labor shortage is keeping many Wisconsin businesses from growing, but it may also help buoy the economy in a downturn.\n\nFounded in 1911, Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce (WMC) is the combined state chamber of commerce, state manufacturers’ association, and state safety council. With nearly 3,800 members, WMC is Wisconsin’s largest business association representing employers of all sizes and from every sector of the economy.\n\nWisconsin Farm Bureau Federation\n\nBy Kevin Krentz, WFBF President\n\nIt’s often said, you have to be an optimist to be a farmer. While there is a lot to be thankful for as we head into 2023, there are also a lot of concerns lingering for Wisconsin farmers who experienced a year of great turmoil and change. But alas, it’s time to look ahead to a new year.\n\nThe past year brought a war in Ukraine, severe drought pockets in the western portion of the U.S., intense market volatility, as well as inflation that we haven’t experienced in 40 years. These have drastically complicated the commodity markets in the U.S.\n\nAt the farmgate, we have seen increased prices for the commodities we produce, but like other industries, we also experienced increased costs for everything from tractor parts to seed and fertilizer. In general, there is optimism for 2023 because of the global demand for products, but there also is skepticism among farmers.\n\nFarmers are good at controlling what we can control. Many farmers use forward contracts on both production and purchased inputs or protect their margins through insurance or hedging. Through good management, we also need to nurture our crops and care for our livestock. Balancing business needs is a major focus and seems to get more complicated by the year.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the current annual inflation rate for the U.S. for the 12 months ending October 2022 stands at 7.7%. Generations of farmers have not experienced rates at this level. Add to that the supply chain challenges that have affected equipment purchases and building expansions, and we have some large stress points within the agricultural community.\n\nHigher interest costs and current land prices also make it challenging for beginning farmers to enter the industry, which will continue the trend of consolidation.\n\nLike many other industries, another issue farmers and agribusinesses face is a severe lack of employees. The BLS also reports that Wisconsin’s October unemployment rate was at 3.3%. Labor shortages will continue to drive innovation and automation as farms find ways to become more efficient with limited workers. Once politics settle, a focus on immigration reform will be revisited.\n\nOur state’s farmers not only supply locally but are a large part of the global food supply.\n\nFarm Bureau has long advocated for reducing trade barriers globally and will continue to do so. The current geopolitical environment will continue to change our trade maps moving forward, but U.S. farmers can compete with other global food producers when presented with barrier-free trade.\n\nOn the consumer front, food prices are constantly a focus and talking point. Some of the higher costs at the farm level are being passed to customers at the grocery stores. This is driving the demand for certain products and consumers wanting to know where and how their food is grown and raised.\n\nWithin the consumer conversation, we are continuously evaluating our practices when it comes to conservation. However, in order to be sustainable, we cannot regulate farms out of business. Farmers must be able to afford to adapt to the ever-changing government regulations and industry requirements while being able to try new things that might better our resources. Wisconsin farmers are some of the most progressive at this throughout the country. We have made great progress and will continue to lead innovation.\n\nWisconsin agriculture consists of 64,100 farms on 14.2 million acres and annually contributes $104.8 billion to our state’s economy. Much of which is spent within the state’s rural communities.\n\nWisconsin Farm Bureau has advocated for farmers for more than 102 years and as farming continues to adapt to feed the world, Farm Bureau will continue to adapt to support our farmers.\n\nEvery year, through our grassroots process, Farm Bureau voting members at the county level bring forth policy that guides our organization at the local, state, and national levels on issues affecting our members. There is no shortage of topics to be discussed for our farmers.\n\nAs a new year and political cycle begin, you can expect many of these topics to be discussed.\n\nThere is optimism for the new year because, by nature, farmers are hopeful people. We will see what the truth holds in the next 12 months as 2023 unfolds.\n\nWisconsin Farm Bureau Federation is the state’s largest general farm organization, representing farms of all sizes, commodities and, management styles. There are more 46,000 members that belong to WFBF. Voting Farm Bureau members annually set the policy the organization follows, and are involved in local, state, and national affairs, making it a true grassroots organization."
