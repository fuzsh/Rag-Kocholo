Being its inaugural year, it just has Year 7 students this year with lots of enrollments booked in for 2025 and beyond.\n\nI had the pleasure of meeting all the Year 7s throughout the day and most of the teachers after school. The focus for the students was Adobe Character Animator as a creative way to enhance presentations and Photoshop to help develop their digital literacy and communication skills.\n\nAfter school, I worked with most of the school staff and introduce them to Adobe Express which we are hoping will soon be back available for all Victorian Department of Education students.\n\nI would like to thank Assistant Principal Angela Roberts for organising this day of digital creativity."
