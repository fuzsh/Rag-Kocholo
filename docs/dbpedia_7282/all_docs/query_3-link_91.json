        "text": "<strong>Dear</strong> <strong>Members</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>Loyola</strong> <strong>College</strong> Community, <strong>1234</strong>: <strong>Thursday</strong> <strong>10</strong> <strong>June</strong> 20<strong>10</strong> In <strong>the</strong> last fortnight we have been saddened by a student accident that occurred at <strong>the</strong> <strong>College</strong> which resulted in extensive injuries to one <strong>of</strong> our Year 11 students, Stephen Callinan (11MMCB). When such events occur <strong>the</strong> community rallies to provide support and I am very grateful to everyone who has sent cards and emails expressing <strong>the</strong>ir support and indicating that <strong>the</strong>y are praying with us for Stephen. Each day <strong>the</strong> St Ignatius Chapel has been filled with staff, students and members <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> community as we have ga<strong>the</strong>red for <strong>the</strong> Novena prayer for Stephen. The Callinan family are very grateful for all <strong>the</strong> prayers and support as we all continue to pray that Stephen will be able to make a full recovery. Working Bee I wish to thank <strong>the</strong> parents and students who attended <strong>the</strong> recent working bee. The gardens around <strong>the</strong> newly renovated science laboratories were upgraded and are looking wonderful. My thanks to Mr Kelly (<strong>College</strong> Gardener) and Sam Bonello one <strong>of</strong> our <strong>Loyola</strong> students who is engaged by <strong>the</strong> <strong>College</strong> under <strong>the</strong> Australian School Based Apprenticeship in Horticulture, for overseeing <strong>the</strong> development <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> area toge<strong>the</strong>r with Mr Tony Romano from <strong>the</strong> LPFA. Canonisation <strong>of</strong> Mary MacKillop I am delighted to announce that Victoria Eley (11KGKK) will represent <strong>Loyola</strong> <strong>College</strong> at <strong>the</strong> canonisation ceremony <strong>of</strong> Mary MacKillop in mid October this year. Eight Year 11 students were interviewed as part <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> process and I thank <strong>the</strong>m for <strong>the</strong>ir interest. Congratulations to Victoria. I am sure we all look forward to hearing <strong>of</strong> her experiences on her return. Capital Development There are currently two projects underway in this area. Redevelopment <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> Old <strong>Loyola</strong> Courtyard commenced last week. This project includes <strong>the</strong> redesign and concreting <strong>of</strong> walking paths in <strong>the</strong> courtyard area. The next phase will see <strong>the</strong> redevelopment <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> current paved area and finally <strong>the</strong> upgrading <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> gardens. It is hoped that this project will be completed by <strong>the</strong> end <strong>of</strong> this year."
