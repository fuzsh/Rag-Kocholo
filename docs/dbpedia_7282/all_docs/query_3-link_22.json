        "text": "It was an honour to be invited back this weekend to run some online digital workshops for a number of Vietnamese students who have been part of the 2024 Virtual CampConnect by the Pacific Links Foundation.\n\nFocusing on young people affected by trafficking, the Virtual CampConnect program transforms lives by enhancing life skills, boosting self-awareness, imparting new knowledge, opening up opportunities, and providing supportive networks.\n\nI’ve been running these workshops annually since 2020 and always feel thrilled to teach the participants new digital skills. This year, the workshops centered on using Gen AI tools within Adobe Express to create short video stories.\n\nIn broken English, a comments in the chat by a participant was …\n\nThis is the first time I have known Adobe with so many experiences. Adobe will greatly assist me in my life. Thank you very much.\n\nAvailable via Amazon from July 7, 2024\n\nCreativity in Education, Generative AI, and the Future of Education stand as crucial subjects for both educational leaders and classroom teachers. This book delves into these vital topics, offering a conversational and easily accessible style of writing, while bolstering its points with references and real-world anecdotes from prominent academics and seasoned educators.\n\n_______\n\nThis book draws together Tim’s understanding of future directions in technology as well as his deep understanding of what students need in our classrooms. It is essential reading for all teachers (Dr Helen Hughes, Executive Coach and former Principal).\n\n_______\n\nmammothlearning.co\n\nAs we venture into the era of Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI), his book raises excellent questions that educators at the cutting edge need to consider. What roles should creativity, AI and alternative forms of assessment play in a system traditionally resistant to change? Tim’s insights offer a timely contribution to this pivotal discussion. His work is a rich resource, balancing theory and practical examples for any educator interested in the future of education (Peter Hutton Director & Co-Founder Future Schools).\n\nI am sure ‘The Best Way to Learn is to Make’ will be a book that is worth having in the hands of teachers – new and old. It is full of Tim’s experience and insights. It is so good that some of his solid gold ideas and advice are now in print (Rev. Tim Costello AO Executive Director of Micah Australia, former CEO of World Vision Australia).\n\nClick here for more information.\n\n______\n\nOn Thursday 27th June 2024, I was invited to work with the Year 11 Innovative Solutions class at Parade College in Melbourne. We started by looking at some of the new Gen AI features within Photoshop as well as some of the other AI features that have been available within Photoshop for a number of years.\n\nThen I introduced the students to the power and variety of multimedia creation options found withing Adobe Express.\n\nParade teacher Kali Potter has been working with Adobe Express in a number of her classes to help enhance her student’s presentation skills. She has also been encouraging her colleagues to integrate it within their classes as well as the school admin team to come up with some creative Adobe Express magic for the school newsletters.\n\nFind out more about how to use Adobe Express in any curriculum area via here.\n\nOn Thursday 13th June, about 400 students from a variety of South Australian schools took part in the 2024 Big Day In event at The University of Adelaide. I was delighted to be back at this event as the opening keynote presenter after not being involved since 2019.\n\nProfessor David Lewis, Acting Executive Dean, Faculty of Science, Engineering & Technology – University of Adelaide welcomed the students and opened the event. The printed description of my presentation was …\n\nChances are, you’ll experience a variety of jobs throughout your life & ideally, some of them will be\n\nyour dream jobs at different points. Regardless of the shape your future career takes, there are\n\nessential skills crucial for achieving success. Dr. Tim Kitchen, who has held various dream jobs\n\nsuch as being a teacher, school administrator, university lecturer, author & consultant, currently\n\nserves as Adobe’s Education Specialist for the Asia Pacific region. In this session, he will delve into\n\nresearch on the most critical skills for thriving & guide you on developing these skills using the free\n\nAdobe applications accessible to all K-12 schools worldwide.\n\nOn 12th June 2024, my colleague Eric Drew and I ran an Adobe Day at Norwood International High School in Adelaide. The focus of this event was Adobe Express, Character Animator and Premiere Pro for about 80 Year 9, 10 & 11 media students.\n\nThe students were new to Adobe Express and learned how to use it to create a quick video stinger to introduce a more lengthy video project that they could be working on with Premiere Pro. They were also shown how to ethically and effectively use Adobe Express as a way of obtaining Adobe Stock assets and create Gen AI enhanced images. They were also introduced to Character Animator as a way of creating quick and effective video content.\n\nMost of the students were experienced with Premiere Pro, so I spent some time with them sharing tips and tricks that are used by professional video editors.\n\nI would like to thank Norwood International High School Teacher David Fawcett for organsing this event.\n\nThe very impressive Adelaide Botanic High in the heart of the CBD and Scotch College at the base of the Adelaide hills hosted two opportunities for South Australian Teachers to do the Adobe Creative Educator (ACE) level 1 course this week.\n\nSince the commencement of the special ANZ version of the ACE course in May 2023, 618 teachers have complete this version of level 1. The course is about the importance of creativity in all areas of the curriculum. It provides teachers with an opportunity to hear from experts in this area from around the globe as well as use Adobe Express to create a digital portfolio and poster to document what they learn.\n\nThe ACE level 1 course can be completed on-demand through the Adobe Education Exchange course – Creativity for All but it takes about 3 hours. If you would like to do a more condensed version that has localised content, click here to register for the next in-person or online opportunity.\n\nI would like to thank my colleague Eric Drew for helping me with these events.\n\nOn Tuesday 11th June, 2024 my colleague Eric Drew and I spent most of the day with the delightful Year 4 to 6 students from Seaton Park Primary School in Adelaide. Deputy Principal Esther Williams heard that I was visiting South Australia that week as asked if I was available to visit her school to help introduce Adobe Express to her students and staff.\n\nI gave the students a challenge to work in a small group to help promote one of the 17 United Nations Sustainability Development Goals in a short video using a variety if Adobe Express tools.\n\nThe students worked really well, especially considering the software was new to them. It was great seeing their collaboration, problem solving & creativity skills in action throughout the day. Here are some of the stories they came up with using their Chromebooks & Adobe Express …\n\nOn Friday 7th June, 13 Year 10 design students and 2 teachers from Braybrook College visited the Adobe Melbourne office as part of an ABCN My Career Rules program.\n\nAdobe has been partnering with ABCN for about three years to help them with their vision for all young Australians to reach their potential in the future world of work, regardless of socio-economic background.\n\nJon Barrie, David Huynh and I were the industry mentors and we were asked a number of great questions from the students about how we got into working for Adobe and what other jobs have we done in the past.\n\nThe My Career Rules program gives students the opportunity to prepare questions and interact with a professionals from specific jobs and industries, opening their minds to careers that reflect the current workplace. Providing a link between classroom learning and the real world of work, it aims to reinforce messages about the skills and mindsets needed to make a successful career in the future workplace.\n\nThe students also enjoyed working with a few of the Adobe Creative Cloud applications that they have access to thanks to an enterprise agreement between Adobe and the Victorian Department of Education.\n\nI would like to thank Catherine Morris from ABCN as well as Braybrook College teachers Loc Nguten and Rolando Garay-Matziaris for organising this event.\n\nIn its first year of existence, Brinbeal Secondary College is one of the newest schools run by the Victorian Department of Education. Being its inaugural year, it just has Year 7 students this year with lots of enrollments booked in for 2025 and beyond.\n\nI had the pleasure of meeting all the Year 7s throughout the day and most of the teachers after school. The focus for the students was Adobe Character Animator as a creative way to enhance presentations and Photoshop to help develop their digital literacy and communication skills.\n\nAfter school, I worked with most of the school staff and introduce them to Adobe Express which we are hoping will soon be back available for all Victorian Department of Education students.\n\nI would like to thank Assistant Principal Angela Roberts for organising this day of digital creativity.\n\nOn the 24th May, I had the pleasure of running a workshop and being part of a panel at the Viewbank College STEAM Futures Conference 2024.\n\nThe panel was focused on AI and the Future of School Education and also included Victoria’s Lead Scientist Amanda Caples, the president of Science Technology Australia Prof Sharath Sriram (RMIT), Dr. Sean Gallagher is the founder of Humanova and a leading expert on the future of work in Australia, Anam Javed from Victorian Academy of Teaching and Leadership and Veena Nair, STEAM Head – Viewbank College.\n\nFacilitated by Sharon Grimes (Principal of Viewbank College), it was a fascinating discussion from this very esteemed group of STEAM experts. I felt very honoured to be invited to be part of this session and contribute some of my thoughts about how Gen AI is fast becoming a normal part of life therefore should be considered a normal part of education.\n\nThe workshop was represented by teachers and students from a about six different school around Melbourne and focused on the way AI is features in a range of Adobe applications to make creativity accessible for all.\n\nI would like to congratulate Veena Nair (STEAM Head – Viewbank College) and her team for organising such a great event."
