        "text": "Proxy statement summary\n\nCompensation highlights\n\nShareholder engagement and “Say on Pay”\n\nWe have a long history of strong shareholder support for our Board’s pay-for-performance philosophy, as accomplished through our executive compensation design and decisions. From 2011 to 2022, support for our “Say on Pay” proposal averaged 94.2%, with the lowest level of support being 92.9% in 2011 and 2012. In recognition of this continued support as well as input from engagement with institutional shareholders, for 2022, our Board maintained a consistent executive compensation design and in applying its pay-for-performance philosophy, decreased the overall pay to Mr. Moynihan by approximately 6%. Compensation for that year’s other named executive officers also decreased between approximately 5% and 7% based on 2022 performance.\n\nLeading up to our 2023 annual meeting, two U.S. proxy advisory firms recommended—for the first time ever—that their subscribers vote “against” our “Say on Pay” proposal. We believe these recommendations contributed significantly to the lower support received in 2023, as some of our institutional investors follow the voting recommendations of these firms and some others are influenced by their analyses and recommendations. In total, of the approximately 5.7 billion votes cast at the meeting, 69.1% favored our “Say on Pay” proposal.\n\nIn light of the result of our 2023 “Say on Pay” vote, which differed significantly from our prior history, and in order to ascertain the reasons for the decline, we intentionally refocused our 2023 and early 2024 shareholder engagements more directly on our executive compensation program and disclosures than in prior years. We specifically solicited input on our executive compensation program as part of our engagement agenda, welcoming dialogue from those who both supported and did not support our “Say on Pay” proposal last year. Our Lead Independent Director and our Compensation and Human Capital Committee Chair played a central role in these discussions. For more information about our shareholder engagement, see ”Shareholder engagement” on page 37 and “Compensation discussion and analysis—Executive summary” on page 54.\n\nOverall, investors expressed their understanding and support for our compensation program and structure and its alignment with the tenets of Responsible Growth. We focused on listening to shareholders to understand why they voted against “Say on Pay” last year, and to confirm their expectations of an appropriate response to regain support.\n\nWe received specific input on two key areas that contributed to a lower “Say on Pay” vote result in 2023: 1) one-time awards and 2) transparency in the pay decision process. This input, along with a range of perspectives and suggestions received during our shareholder engagement, informed the Committee as it implemented enhancements to our 2023 compensation program and disclosures. For details on our responsive actions, see “Compensation discussion and analysis—What we heard and how we responded” on page 55.\n\n2024 PROXY STATEMENT\n\n5\n\nProposal 1: Electing directors\n\nIdentifying and evaluating director candidates\n\nOur Board oversees the business and affairs of the company through active and independent oversight of management. To carry out its responsibilities and set the tone at the top, our Board is keenly focused on its composition, its leadership structure, and succession planning. The Board regularly reviews its composition, and through its Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee identifies and recommends director candidates for nomination using a director selection process that has been reviewed with our primary bank regulators. The Board, in coordination with its committees, also regularly considers Board leadership succession planning and committee membership composition.\n\nBoard composition\n\nOur Board believes directors should possess high personal integrity and character, demonstrated management and leadership ability, extensive experience within our industry and across sectors, and the ability to exercise sound and independent judgment in a collegial manner. Our Board:\n\nIn addition, the Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee follows applicable regulations in confirming that our Board includes members who are independent, possess financial literacy and expertise, understand risk management principles, policies, and practices, and have experience in identifying, assessing, and managing risk exposures.\n\nKey considerations informing the Board’s approach\n\nDirector experience, skills, and expertise. When evaluating and identifying director candidates, the Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee considers the experiences, skills, and expertise that are critical to the Board’s ability to provide effective oversight of the company and are directly relevant to our business, strategy, and operations. The Committee seeks candidates with experiences, skills, and expertise in financial services and other global, highly complex and regulated industries, strategic planning and business development, business operations, marketing and distribution, technology, cybersecurity, risk management and financial controls, human capital management, corporate governance, and public policy.\n\nDirector diversity. Our Board views diversity, including diversity of thought, perspective, and experience, as a priority. Through the Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee, the Board regularly assesses its diversity and seeks representation across a range of attributes when identifying and evaluating director candidates. The Committee demonstrates this commitment to diversity by requesting the inclusion of diverse candidates in its consideration of potential directors in its work with third-party search firms. (See information on the next page for the Committee’s engagement with external search firms.) When evaluating director candidates, the Committee reviews available or self-identified information regarding each candidate, including, but not limited to, professional qualifications, experience, and expertise as well as race, ethnicity, gender, nationality, national origin, sexual orientation, military service, and other diverse characteristics.\n\nDirector time commitment. Our Board understands the time commitment involved in serving on the Board and its committees. Through the Committee, the Board evaluates whether candidates and serving directors are able to devote the time necessary to discharge their duties as directors, taking into account their primary occupations, memberships on other boards, and other responsibilities.\n\nIn 2022, at the Committee’s recommendation, our Board amended its policy on outside board service set forth in the Corporate Governance Guidelines. The revised policy limits the maximum number of public company boards on which a director on our Board may serve to four public companies (including our Board) and specifies that any public company chief executive officer who serves as a director on our Board may not serve on the boards of more than two public companies (including our Board).\n\n2024 PROXY STATEMENT\n\n9\n\nCorporate governance\n\nIndependent board leadership\n\nOur Board is committed to objective, independent Board leadership. It believes that independent board oversight involves not only having a properly defined independent board leader, such as a strong Lead Independent Director when the Chair is the CEO, but also having robust governance structures that promote active oversight. Our Board embraces multiple, interlinked practices that support the Board’s effective functioning as a whole and engender strong and objective Board oversight. These practices include:\n\n• Regular reviews of our Board leadership structure and governance practices, taking into account contemporaneous shareholder and stakeholder perspectives;\n\n• A robust, well-defined, and transparent Lead Independent Director structure that applies when our Chair is not an independent director and that empowers the Lead Independent Director with extensive authority and responsibilities. The Lead Independent Director’s comprehensive authority and responsibilities are formalized in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, are regularly reviewed, and give our Lead Independent Director significant authority with respect to the operation and functioning of the Board, and engaging directly with stakeholders;\n\n• Active leadership, involvement, and influence by the Lead Independent Director. The Lead Independent Director regularly convenes and presides over executive sessions of our independent directors outside the presence of management and our CEO, and develops topics for discussion during these closed sessions. In addition, the Lead Independent Director holds regular discussions with our other independent directors in between Board meetings, meets with our CEO at least monthly and with other members of management at least quarterly, has regular calls with our primary bank regulators, and plays a central role in overseeing and participating in shareholder engagement efforts;\n\n• A Board composed of diverse, experienced, and skilled directors, all of whom stand for election annually and all of whom are independent aside from the CEO. Each standing committee of the Board is presided over by an independent chair and is composed entirely of independent directors. Under this approach, independent directors are empowered and entrusted with oversight of critical issues that are within the purview of these committees; and\n\n• A robust Board and committee formal self-evaluation process and thoughtful director succession practices as described on pages 28 and 10, respectively, of this proxy statement.\n\nWe believe these practices, coupled with our Board’s other governance processes, provide for strong, independent Board leadership and effective engagement with, and oversight of, management.\n\nOur Board leadership structure\n\nOur Bylaws provide that our Board has the flexibility to determine the Board leadership structure best suited to the needs and circumstances of our company and our Board. This Bylaw provision was ratified by our shareholders at a 2015 special meeting called solely for that purpose. Our shareholders reaffirmed their support for allowing this flexibility by voting against shareholder proposals seeking Bylaw amendments requiring an independent Chair at each of our 2017, 2018, and 2023 annual meetings of shareholders. At least annually, our Board, in coordination with our Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee, deliberates on and discusses the appropriate Board leadership structure, including the considerations described above.\n\nOur Board’s optimal leadership structure may change over time to reflect our company’s evolving needs, strategy, and the operating environment; changes in our Board’s composition and leadership needs; and other factors, including the perspectives of shareholders and other stakeholders. The Board evaluates the Board’s leadership structure at least annually to determine what, if any, changes are appropriate based on the then-existing needs and circumstances of our company and our Board and input from shareholders and other stakeholders. If at any time the Board’s review of its leadership structure resulted in the conclusion that an independent Chair would best serve the interests of our shareholders based on the company’s needs and circumstances at that time, the Board would appoint an independent Chair.\n\nUnder our Board’s current leadership structure, we have a Chair and a Lead Independent Director. Our Board, through its annual assessment, with input from shareholders, believes that the existing structure continues to be the optimal leadership framework at this time.\n\nOur Lead Independent Director, Mr. Nowell, exemplifies objective, independent Board leadership and effectively engages with and oversees management. Mr. Nowell leads the other independent directors in providing objective oversight of management, reviewing the CEO’s performance, determining and approving CEO compensation, helping to establish our company’s long-term strategy and regularly assessing its effectiveness, and serving the best interests of our company and our shareholders by overseeing management’s work to create long-term value. He is joined by our Chair, Mr. Moynihan, who, as CEO, serves as the primary voice to articulate our long-term strategy and Responsible Growth. Mr. Moynihan brings deep experience and leadership in and knowledge of the financial services industry, our company, its businesses, and our focus on Responsible Growth. He is a global leader who is helping drive progress toward the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDG), including serving on (and formerly chairing) the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) International Business Council, which is leading efforts on standardization of UN SDG disclosures, and is chair of the Sustainable Markets Initiative.\n\n26\n\nBANK OF AMERICA\n\nCorporate governance\n\nAreas of focus—characteristics of highly effective boards\n\nResearch previously commissioned by the Board identified a broad set of characteristics frequently identified with highly effective boards. Those characteristics were grouped into the five key categories set forth below; the Board’s formal annual self-evaluation was organized around these five categories.\n\nComposition. Through the self-evaluation process, our Board identifies qualities, relevant skills, and experiences of potential director candidates that are consistent with the company’s current strategy and Responsible Growth, that allow the Board to effectively perform its risk oversight responsibilities, and that add to the Board’s diversity. Our Board also assesses its overall director recruitment and succession planning processes, committee composition, and its optimal size.\n\nBoard culture. Our Board considers its role in setting the standard for the company’s culture and values, including by evaluating interactions among directors and with members of management. Directors assess the effectiveness of the Board in establishing a collegial and collaborative dynamic that promotes open discussion and debate, values independent judgment, and emphasizes accountability. Directors also assess how they interact with management and challenge and hold management accountable.\n\nFocus. During the formal annual self-evaluation process, our Board and committees consider their effectiveness in performing key oversight responsibilities in a number of areas, including strategy, risk, environmental and social sustainability, and management talent and succession planning. They evaluate the sufficiency of information received and the time spent in these areas and provide input on additional information and resources desired to support their oversight responsibilities. Throughout the year, directors also regularly reassess their oversight focus by engaging in dialogue with management, soliciting input from shareholders and other stakeholders, and receiving third-party perspectives on the competitive environment, opportunities for growth, macroeconomic trends, and geopolitics.\n\nProcess. As part of the formal annual self-evaluation process, directors review overall Board and committee structure, the allocation of meeting time, cadence of meetings, and other meeting processes. Through the annual and ongoing year-round evaluation processes, directors have provided input on process enhancements to allow ample time during meetings for discussion, debate, and in-depth review of key topics and trends, and to facilitate focus on specific strategic topics. In addition to the Board’s formal self-evaluation process, each director also has the opportunity to meet with and provide input to management, our Lead Independent Director, and the committee chairs through a combination of executive sessions and one-on-one meetings.\n\nInformation and resources. Through the self-evaluation process, our Board and committees assess the quality of meeting materials and presentations and the overall amount and type of information, education, and training opportunities they receive both from management and outside advisors and experts. Our directors continue to highlight the need for clear, comprehensive, and concise information to effectively support their oversight responsibilities, including understandable and streamlined materials that identify key issues. They also have provided information about additional resources, including opportunities to hear from third parties, that they believe will support their oversight responsibilities.\n\nEnhancements made in response to formal Board self-evaluations\n\nOur directors and management work together to respond to the Board and committees self-evaluation results. In response to the formal and informal components of the Board’s self-evaluation processes in 2023, we have:\n\nComposition\n\nContinued to support directors’ discussion and decision-making on Board succession planning and committee membership, including a focus on future needs and alignment with the company’s strategy.\n\nBoard culture\n\nProvided more opportunities for our Board to interact with senior management and emerging talent, both formally and informally, to strengthen relationships and support the Board’s talent and succession planning responsibilities.\n\nFocus\n\nEnhanced discussion about areas of emerging risk at Board and Enterprise Risk Committee meetings, including in-depth reviews of key topics such as climate risk, risks arising from the macroeconomic environment, and technology and cybersecurity risks, including artificial intelligence.\n\nAdded more frequent discussions on environmental topics at the Board and committee level including regular updates on implementation of the company’s sustainability initiatives and climate activities and updates on new climate disclosure requirements.\n\nConducted analyses and implemented changes in certain compliance risk oversight responsibilities to better coordinate and enhance Audit Committee and Enterprise Risk Committee oversight.\n\nProcess\n\nEnhanced the structure of strategic planning sessions to facilitate directors’ and managements’ thorough review and discussion of the company’s strategy and address topics identified by directors as desired areas of increased focus, including related to current economic conditions, the company’s balance sheet, emerging technology, and the geopolitical environment.\n\nAdapted Board and committee meeting structure, process, practices, and agendas to enhance our directors’ ability to perform their oversight responsibilities by providing ample time during Board and committee meetings for discussion, debate, in-depth reviews, questions, and executive sessions.\n\nInformation\n\nand resources\n\nContinued to streamline meeting materials to better highlight important information, while maintaining completeness, and providing timely updates, as needed. Continued to enhance presentation materials to better facilitate dialogue between management and committee members.\n\nProvided educational opportunities and third-party perspectives on topics where directors have indicated outside expertise is desired, including artificial intelligence, the macroeconomic environment, and the geopolitical environment.\n\n2024 PROXY STATEMENT\n\n29\n\nCorporate governance\n\nDirector education\n\nDirector education is vital to the ability of directors to fulfill their roles, and supports Board members in their continuous learning. The Board encourages directors to participate annually in external continuing director education programs, and our company reimburses directors for their expenses associated with this participation. Our directors also attend forums and conferences convened by our primary banking regulators.\n\nContinuing director education is also provided during Board and committee meetings and other discussions as part of the formal meetings and as stand-alone information sessions outside of meetings. Among other topics, during 2023, our Board heard from our primary banking regulators, a research academic, a technology company chief executive officer, a former leader in the U.S. military, a senior researcher from a global policy think tank and research institute, outside counsel, and from management on numerous subjects, including generative artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, the macroeconomic environment, and the impact of geopolitical conflict to global economies, risk management, climate and sustainable finance, human capital management and diversity and inclusion, and many related topics.\n\nAll new directors also participate in our director orientation program during their first six months on our Board. New directors have a series of meetings over time with management representatives from all of our business and staff areas to review and discuss, with increasing detail, information about our company, industry, and regulatory framework, as well as compliance training. Based on input from our directors, we believe this gradual on-boarding approach over the first six months of Board service, coupled with participation in regular Board and committee meetings, provides new directors with a strong foundation in our company’s businesses, connects directors with members of management with whom they will interact and oversee, and accelerates their effectiveness to engage fully in Board deliberations. Directors have access to additional orientation and educational opportunities upon acceptance of new or additional responsibilities on the Board and in committees.\n\nCEO and senior management succession planning\n\nOur Board oversees CEO and senior management succession planning, which is formally reviewed at least annually; three such planning sessions were held in 2023. Our CEO and our Chief Human Resources Officer provide our Board with recommendations and evaluations of potential CEO successors, and review their development progress. Our Board reviews potential internal senior management candidates with our CEO and our Chief Human Resources Officer, including the qualifications, experience, and development priorities for these individuals. Directors engage with potential CEO and senior management successors at Board and committee meetings and in less formal settings to allow directors to personally assess candidates. Further, our Board periodically reviews the overall composition of our senior management’s qualifications, tenure, and experience.\n\nOur Board also establishes steps to address emergency CEO planning in extraordinary circumstances. Our emergency CEO succession planning is intended to enable our company to respond to unexpected position vacancies, including those resulting from a major catastrophe, by continuing our company’s safe and sound operation and minimizing potential disruption or loss of continuity to our company’s business and operations.\n\nBoard meetings and attendance\n\nDirectors are expected to attend our annual meetings of shareholders and our Board and committee meetings. Each of our incumbent directors and nominees attended at least 75% of the aggregate meetings of our Board and the committees on which they served during 2023. In addition, all of the directors serving on our Board at the time of our 2023 annual meeting attended the meeting, other than Ms. Hudson, who was unable to attend for health reasons.\n\nOur independent directors regularly meet privately in executive session without our Chair and CEO or other members of management present, and held 11 such executive sessions in connection with Board meetings in 2023. Our Lead Independent Director leads these Board executive sessions.\n\n30\n\nBANK OF AMERICA\n\nCorporate governance\n\ntalent and innovative technology in order to better manage cybersecurity risk. Employees across the company also play a role in protecting the company from cybersecurity threats and receive periodic training and education on cybersecurity-related topics. More information regarding our company’s risk management policies and practices, including our Board’s oversight of cybersecurity and information security risk, are described under “Compliance and Operational Risk Management” in the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our 2023 Form 10-K.\n\nWe believe our holistic, ongoing Board and committee risk oversight process provides for consistent and effective oversight of current and emerging risks facing our company and demonstrates our commitment to a culture of rigorous risk management and compliance.\n\nCompensation governance and risk management\n\nKey practices in compensation governance and risk management\n\nCompensation governance\n\nOur Compensation and Human Capital Committee follows processes intended to promote strong governance of our pay-for-performance philosophy. The Committee regularly reviews: (i) company performance; (ii) our executive compensation strategy, approach, trends, and regulatory developments; and (iii) other related topics, as appropriate. Each year, the Committee reviews, and makes available to our Board, an executive compensation statement, or “tally sheet,” for each executive officer. The tally sheets reflect each executive officer’s total compensation, including base salary, cash, and equity-based incentive awards, the value of prior restricted stock unit awards (including the status of achieving any performance goals), qualified and nonqualified retirement and deferred compensation benefit accruals, and the incremental cost to our company of the executive’s perquisites. The Committee uses this information to evaluate all elements of compensation and benefits provided to an executive officer. The Committee also annually reviews market pay practices, including compensation benchmarks at our primary competitor group, to evaluate market trends and competitive pay levels for our executive officers. For additional information, see “2023 Competitor group” section on page 72.\n\nAnnually, the Committee reviews with our Board its compensation decisions (including cash and equity-based incentive awards, if applicable) for executives who report directly to our CEO. With respect to the CEO’s compensation, the Committee makes a recommendation that is further reviewed and approved by the independent members of the Board. The CEO does not participate in Committee or Board deliberations about his compensation. Additionally, for our Chief Risk Officer and Chief Audit Executive, the Committee’s pay recommendations are further reviewed and approved by our Board’s Enterprise Risk Committee and Audit Committee, respectively.\n\nExecutive officers do not engage with the Committee in setting the amount of their own individual compensation. During annual performance reviews for executive officers other than our CEO, the Committee considers our CEO’s perspective and incentive award recommendations before approving compensation for each of these executive officers. In addition, the Committee considers the performance of our various lines of business, business segments, and functions, as well as performance feedback from our Chief Human Resources Officer and our independent control functions (Corporate Audit, Risk and Compliance, Finance, Human Resources, and Legal).\n\nThe Committee has the sole authority and responsibility under its charter to approve engaging any compensation consultant it uses and the fees for those services. The Committee retained Farient Advisors LLC (Farient Advisors) as its 2023 independent compensation consultant. Farient Advisors’ business with us is limited to providing independent executive and director compensation consulting services. Farient Advisors does not provide any other services to our company. For 2023, Farient Advisors provided the Committee external market and performance comparisons, advised the Committee on senior executive, CEO, and director compensation, assisted in evaluating program design, and assisted with other executive and director compensation-related matters. In performing these services, Farient Advisors met regularly with the Committee without management and privately with the Chair of the Committee.\n\nThe Committee may delegate to management certain duties and responsibilities regarding our benefit plans. Significant Committee delegations to management include authority to: (i) the Management Compensation Committee to direct the compensation for all of our employees except for our CEO and his direct reports; and (ii) the Corporate Benefits Committee to oversee substantially all of our employee benefit plans. See “Compensation governance structure” on the next page.\n\n34\n\nBANK OF AMERICA\n\nCorporate governance\n\nIndependent control function feedback. In addition to reviewing the individual incentive compensation awards for executive officers and other senior executives who report directly to the CEO, the Committee also reviews the outcomes of our control function feedback process and individual incentive compensation awards for certain highly compensated employees. As part of its governance process, the Committee meets with the heads of our independent control functions and business lines to discuss their feedback on the pay-for-performance process, including how risk management and conduct matters were factored into compensation decisions.\n\nThese processes and reviews, in combination with risk management and clawback features, are key components of our compensation programs. These programs are designed to appropriately hold employees accountable, while balancing risks and rewards in a way that does not encourage excessive or imprudent risk-taking or create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our company.\n\nHedging policy. Under our Code of Conduct and other policies, all Bank of America directors, executive officers, and certain other designated insiders are prohibited from hedging, speculative trading, or trading in derivative securities with respect to Bank of America securities. They may not engage in short sales and trading in puts, calls, prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars, or exchange funds, and other options or derivatives with respect to our securities. All other employees may not engage in any such transactions other than transactions that hedge against an existing long position in our securities if the shares underlying the position are readily available for sale or delivery. No employee may hedge the value of outstanding restricted stock units or other equity-based awards, and such awards may be forfeited or recouped for violation of our anti-hedging and derivative transactions policies.\n\nAdditional corporate governance information\n\nMore information about our corporate governance can be found on our website at http://investor.bankofamerica.com under the heading “Governance,” including our: (i) Certificate of Incorporation; (ii) Bylaws; (iii) Corporate Governance Guidelines (including our related person transactions policy and our Director Independence Categorical Standards); (iv) Code of Conduct (that applies to the required individuals associated with the company for purposes of the respective rules of the SEC and NYSE) and related materials; and (v) composition and charters of each of our Board committees.

Depending on the nature of the communication, the correspondence either will be forwarded to the director(s) named or the matters will be presented periodically to our Board. The Corporate Secretary or the secretary of the designated committee may sort or summarize the communications as appropriate. Communications that are personal grievances, commercial solicitations, customer complaints, incoherent, or obscene will not be communicated to our Board or any director or committee of our Board.\n\nAny shareholder who wishes to recommend a director candidate for consideration by our Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee must submit a written recommendation to our Corporate Secretary. For our 2025 annual meeting of shareholders, the Committee will consider recommendations received by October 15, 2024. The recommendation must include the information set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. See above for information on how to obtain a copy of our Corporate Governance Guidelines.\n\nCommunications should be addressed to our Corporate Secretary at Bank of America Corporation, Bank of America Corporate Center, 100 North Tryon Street, NC1-007-56-06, Charlotte, North Carolina 28255.

We are also financing emerging technologies that we believe will be critical to achieving net zero by 2050, such as bioenergy, including sustainable aviation fuel, electric vehicle infrastructure, carbon sequestering and removal, and sustainable agriculture.\n\nClimate-related risk management\n\nWe use risk identification, measurement, and monitoring tools to drive policies, processes, and testing efforts to manage and mitigate exposure to climate-related risk. We have incorporated climate considerations into our Risk Framework and Risk Appetite Statement. We conduct enhanced due diligence and take additional measures to identify, evaluate, and mitigate environmental and social risks for certain clients, business activities, industries, sectors, and geographies through a client- and deal-specific process that considers portfolio-level credit, operational, reputational, and other risks, including climate risk.\n\nMore details on our approach to addressing the clean energy transition and managing risk in our financing activities can be found in our 2023 TCFD Report, our Environmental and Social Risk Policy Framework, our 2023 Annual Report, which accompanies this proxy statement, and in our Board’s response to Proposals 6 and 7 starting on page 100.\n\nBeing a great place to work\n\nCentral to Responsible Growth is being a great place to work for our teammates. We deliver on this commitment by fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace so our workforce reflects the communities we serve, attracting and developing exceptional talent, expanding our benefits and resources to support the physical, emotional, and financial wellness of our teammates and their families, recognizing and rewarding performance, and providing a competitive starting wage. To promote transparency, accountability, and continued progress, we hold ourselves accountable each year by using third parties to validate equal pay for equal work and by asking our workforce to tell us how we are doing in our Employee Satisfaction Survey, which includes a diversity and inclusion component. Our focus on being a great place to work is highlighted in the Human Capital Management update in our 2023 Annual Report, which accompanies this proxy statement.\n\nBuilding a diverse and inclusive workplace that mirrors the clients & communities we serve\n\nWe believe that our diversity makes us stronger, and our leaders embrace diversity and inclusion as integral to our business success. Our commitment starts at the top with oversight from our Board and CEO and extends to all teammates. Each management team member has aspirational diversity goals that are specific to the business, subject to our quarterly business review process, used as part of talent planning, and included in scorecards reviewed by the Board. Management team members cascade these aspirational goals across their organizations to support engagement and accountability across the company. We hold all managers responsible for driving an inclusive work environment and a diverse workforce that mirrors the clients and communities we serve. We also provide opportunities for managers to sponsor and support rising talent to continue building our workforce.\n\nOur Global Diversity & Inclusion Council was established more than 20 years ago and continues to promote aspirational diversity goal setting, which is embedded in our performance management process at all levels of the organization. The global council sponsors and supports business, operating unit, and regional diversity and inclusion councils to provide alignment to enterprise diversity and inclusion strategies and aspirational\n\n42\n\nBANK OF AMERICA\n\nResponsible Growth: Growth that is Sustainable\n\ngoals. Membership on the council consists of senior executives from every line of business, every region, and our local markets, and the council has been chaired by Mr. Moynihan since 2007. Our Chief Diversity & Inclusion and Corporate Social Responsibility Officer partners with our CEO and management team to drive our diversity and inclusion strategy, initiatives, programs, and policies.\n\nTransparency and accountability. We hold ourselves accountable for increasing diverse representation, including by disclosing our employment metrics and measuring progress across top management levels. We have built robust analytics and put processes in place at all levels of the company, including our top three management levels, to drive progress and accountability. And we report on our progress by including a Human Capital Management update section in our Annual Report to provide key information on our progress in being a great place to work, as well as by routinely disclosing our company’s EEO diversity statistics.\n\nRecruiting and developing talented teammates\n\nA key aspect of Responsible Growth is attracting and retaining exceptional talent from around the world to our company. This starts with how we recruit new employees and extends to the many ways we support their professional development and career growth. We have built a diverse pipeline of candidates for positions at all levels of the company, including leadership positions, as demonstrated in our published workforce diversity metrics. In addition to our rigorous candidate review policy, our longstanding practice of using diverse slates to grow diversity at senior levels of the company—which was formalized into a policy—has helped to drive strong progress toward our aspirational goal for our workforce to mirror the clients and communities we serve at all levels of the company. Our latest measures show improvement in the diversity of our leadership, management, and global workforce:\n\n(2)\n\nU.S. only\n\nTo help drive a culture of inclusion, we have developed and provide employees with access to a range of voluntary programs and resources focused on building understanding and driving progress in the workplace, including our series of courageous conversations and inclusion learning and development programs that provide teammates with opportunities to discuss topics central to who we are as individuals, including racial equality, economic opportunity, gender, sexual orientation, disability status, military service, mental health, and more.\n\nStudents join us from more than 400 universities for entry level opportunities through our highly competitive campus program. As part of our commitment to a diverse and inclusive workforce, we hired from more than 30 Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). In addition, we’ve developed partnerships with 34 community colleges to collaborate on a career readiness curriculum for careers in financial services and connect to diverse talent. In 2023, we onboarded more than 1,900 full-time campus hires (44% women and 62% people of color) into entry-level programs and hired more than 1,600 U.S. teammates with a military background. In 2023 we also provided more than $68 million to workforce development organizations that are providing critical skills-training, work experience, and support to help individuals from low- and moderate- income communities obtain and succeed in family-sustaining jobs. We have now surpassed our aspirational goal of attracting and hiring 20,000 teammates from low- and moderate- income communities. We work with more than 90 external partners, including nonprofit organizations, to identify talent and expand our impact. We focus on recruiting diverse talent, including military and veterans, LGBTQ+ individuals, and people with disabilities.\n\nWe are investing in teammates’ career growth and success through The Academy at Bank of America, our award-winning onboarding, education, and professional development organization established in 2017. For our leaders and managers, we offer a range of development programs that provide assessments, professional coaching, strategies, and tactics to help leaders progress in their careers and strengthen our leader pipeline for future roles.\n\nPromoting physical, emotional, and financial wellness\n\nWe provide employees with access to leading benefits and programs that help teammates be well—physically, emotionally, and financially. This is core to our values and to Responsible Growth, and we continue to evolve our benefits and programs over time to meet teammates where they are in their career and personal lives. Recent highlights of our benefits and programs that support the physical, emotional, and financial wellness of our teammates are described in more detail in our 2023 Annual Report.\n\n2024 PROXY STATEMENT\n\n43\n\nResponsible Growth: Growth that is Sustainable\n\nPhysical wellness. To help our employees be physically well, we offer health insurance plans that provide access to virtual care, condition management, and specialty programs and tools that help employees know how to prevent illness and maintain wellness. We have held medical premiums flat for U.S. employees earning less than $50,000 for the 11th year in a row. For the seventh straight year, employees earning between $50,000 and less than $100,000 saw nominal premium increases. We also continued to enhance access to care across the company, through nearsite health centers, vaccination clinics, and wellness screenings in many of our U.S. locations.\n\nEmotional wellness. Helping our teammates be emotionally well means providing resources to help handle stress, manage conflicts and adversity, and deal with grief in positive, healthy ways.\n\nRecognizing and rewarding teammate performance\n\nOur pay-for-performance compensation approach strives to recognize and reward performance with competitive and fair pay at all levels of our company. We believe our pay-for-performance approach—combined with our focus on workforce representation—will continue driving the advancement and representation of women and people of color in our company.\n\nWe are committed to equal pay for equal work. We maintain robust policies and practices that reinforce equal pay for equal work, including reviews with oversight from our Board and senior leaders. For over 17 years, we have conducted rigorous processes and analyses with outside experts to examine individual employee pay before year-end compensation decisions are finalized, and we adjust compensation where appropriate. In 2023, our review of equal pay for equal work demonstrated that we continue to compensate our employees fairly and equitably. Results of this review showed that compensation received by women globally, was on average more than 99% of that received by men in comparable positions. In the U.S., compensation received by people of color was on average more than 99% of that received by non-people of color employees.\n\nEqual pay for equal work commitments\n\nWe strive to pay our employees fairly based on market rates for their roles, experience, and individual performance, and we regularly benchmark against other companies both within and outside our industry to help confirm our pay is competitive. We have a standard U.S. practice that restricts the solicitation of compensation information from candidates during our hiring process to ensure we consider new hires based on their individual qualifications and experiences, rather than how they may have been previously compensated.\n\n44\n\nBANK OF AMERICA\n\nRelated person and certain other transactions\n\nThe related person transactions policy in our Corporate Governance Guidelines sets forth our policies and procedures for reviewing and approving or ratifying any transaction with related persons (directors, director nominees, executive officers, shareholders holding more than 5% of our voting securities, or any of their immediate family members or affiliated entities). Our policy covers any transactions where the aggregate amount involved will or may be expected to exceed $120,000 in any fiscal year, our company is a participant, and a related person has or will have a direct or indirect material interest.\n\nUnder our related person transactions policy, our Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee must approve or ratify any related person transactions, and when doing so, consider: the related person’s interest in the transaction; whether the transaction involves arm’s-length bids or market prices and terms; the transaction’s materiality to each party; the availability of the product or services through other sources; the implications of our Code of Conduct or reputational risk; whether the transaction would impair a director’s or executive officer’s judgment to act in our company’s best interest; the transaction’s acceptability to our regulators; and in the case of an independent director, whether the transaction would impair his or her independence or status as an “outside” or “non-employee” director.\n\nOur Board has determined that certain types of transactions do not create or involve a direct or indirect material interest on the part of the related person and therefore do not require review or approval under the policy. These include transactions involving financial services, including: loans and brokerage; banking, insurance, investment advisory, or asset management services; and other financial services we provide to any related person, if the services are provided in the ordinary course of business, on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable services provided to non-affiliates, and comply with applicable law, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Federal Reserve Board Regulation O.\n\nA number of our directors, director nominees, and executive officers, their family members, and certain business organizations associated with them are or have been clients of our banking subsidiaries. All extensions of credit to these persons have been made in the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time in comparable transactions with persons not related to our company and did not involve more than the normal risk of collectability.\n\nOccasionally, we may have employees who are Immediate Family Members of our executive officers, directors, or director nominees. The son of Mr. D. Steve Boland, an executive officer, and the brother of Dr. Zuber, a director and nominee, are each employed by the company in non-executive, non-strategic positions, and each received compensation in 2023 of approximately $185,000 and $470,000, respectively. Dr. Zuber’s brother’s compensation is primarily commissions based. The methodology through which his compensation is calculated is consistent with that used for other financial advisors in similar roles. The compensation and other terms of employment of both Mr. Boland’s son and Dr. Zuber’s brother are determined on a basis consistent with the company’s human resources policies.\n\nOur company and Mr. Moynihan are parties to an aircraft time-sharing agreement, as disclosed in prior proxy statements and approved by our Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee in December 2010. In addition, the company and each of our executive officers have entered into nonexclusive aircraft time-sharing agreements. These agreements provide a means under Federal Aviation Administration regulations for our executive officers to reimburse the company for incremental costs of permitted personal travel on our company’s aircraft. To the extent such aircraft usage exceeds the dollar threshold in our related person transactions policy, it will be reviewed for approval or ratification by our Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee.\n\nBased on information contained in separate Schedule 13G filings with the SEC, each of Warren E. Buffett/Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (Berkshire Hathaway), BlackRock, Inc. (BlackRock), and The Vanguard Group (Vanguard) reported that it beneficially owned more than 5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2023 (see “Stock ownership of directors, executive officers, and certain beneficial owners” on the next page). In the ordinary course of our business during 2023, our subsidiaries provided and are expected to continue to provide financial advisory, sales and trading, treasury, and other financial or administrative services to Berkshire Hathaway, BlackRock, and Vanguard and their subsidiaries.\n\nThese and other routine business transactions between the companies were entered into on an arm’s-length basis and contain customary terms and conditions. Our company and its subsidiaries may also, in the ordinary course, invest in BlackRock or Vanguard funds or other products or buy or sell assets to or from BlackRock or Vanguard funds and separate accounts.\n\n2024 PROXY STATEMENT\n\n47\n\nDirector compensation\n\nDirector compensation\n\nOur director compensation philosophy is to appropriately compensate our non-management directors for the time, expertise, and effort required to serve as a director of a large, complex, and highly regulated global company, and to align the interests of directors and long-term shareholders.\n\nAnnual payments are made after the directors are elected by shareholders. Directors who begin their Board or committee chair service other than at the annual meeting of shareholders receive a prorated amount of annual compensation. Mr. Moynihan receives no compensation for his services as a management director.\n\n2023 Director pay components\n\nThe primary elements of 2023 annual compensation and incremental awards for our non-management directors, all of whom are independent, are provided in the table below. Incremental awards recognize additional responsibilities and the time commitment of these critical Board leadership roles.\n\nIncremental awards for board leadership\n\nAnnual award components\n\nNon-\n\nmanagement\n\ndirectors\n\n($)\n\nLead\n\nIndependent\n\nDirector\n\n($)\n\nAudit &\n\nEnterprise Risk\n\nCommittee chairs\n\n($)\n\nCompensation and\n\nHuman Capital &\n\nCorporate Governance,\n\nESG, and Sustainability\n\nCommittee chairs\n\n($)\n\nCash Award\n\n120,000 75,000 40,000 30,000\n\nRestricted Stock Award\n\n270,000 125,000 N/A N/A\n\nThe annual restricted stock award in 2023 was made pursuant to the Bank of America Corporation Equity Plan (BACEP). The number of restricted shares awarded is equal to the dollar value of the award divided by the closing price of our common stock on the NYSE on the grant date, rounded down to the next whole share, with cash paid for any fractional share. The annual restricted stock award is subject to a one-year vesting requirement. If a director retires before the one-year vesting date, a prorated amount of the award vests based on the number of days the director served during the vesting period before retirement. Any unvested amount of the award is forfeited. Following the BACEP’s amendment and restatement, effective April 25, 2023, dividends accrue during the one-year vesting period and are paid when the award vests. Prior to April 25, 2023, dividends were paid on the award when they were paid on shares of our common stock.\n\nDirector compensation review\n\nOur Compensation and Human Capital Committee annually reviews and periodically recommends updates to the director compensation program to our Board for approval. The Committee’s recommendation takes into account our director compensation philosophy, changes in market practices, and consultation with the Committee’s independent compensation consultant, Farient Advisors.\n\nAs disclosed in our 2023 proxy statement, following the Committee’s 2022 review, our Board approved: for all non-management directors, a $20,000 annual cash award increase to $120,000 and a $20,000 annual restricted stock award increase to $270,000; for our Lead Independent Director, a $25,000 incremental annual cash award increase to $75,000 and a $25,000 incremental annual restricted stock award increase to $125,000. These changes took effect as of our 2023 annual meeting of shareholders and are reflected in the table above. No changes were made to the form or amount of director compensation as part of the 2023 review.\n\nDirector deferral plan\n\nNon-management directors may elect to defer all or a portion of their annual restricted stock or cash awards through the Bank of America Corporation Director Deferral Plan (Director Deferral Plan). When directors elect to defer their restricted stock award, their stock account is credited with stock units equal in value to the restricted stock award and subject to the same vesting requirement applicable to restricted stock awards to directors. Each stock unit is equal in value to a share of our common stock but because it is not an actual share of our common stock, it does not have any voting rights. When directors elect to defer their cash award, they may choose to defer into either a stock account or a cash account. Deferrals into a stock account are credited with dividend equivalents in the form of additional stock units and deferrals into the cash account are credited with interest at a long-term bond rate. Following retirement from our Board and depending on the director’s selection, a non-management director may receive the stock account balance (to the extent vested) and cash account balance in a single lump-sum cash payment or in a series of cash installment payments.\n\n50\n\nBANK OF AMERICA\n\nCompensation discussion and analysis\n\n1. Executive summary\n\na. Shareholder engagement & “Say on Pay” results\n\nWe have a long history of strong shareholder support for our Board’s pay-for-performance philosophy, as accomplished through our executive compensation design and decisions. From 2011 to 2022, support for our “Say on Pay” proposal averaged 94.2%, with the lowest level of support being 92.9% in 2011 and 2012. In recognition of this continued support as well as input from engagement with institutional shareholders, for 2022, our Board maintained a consistent executive compensation design and in applying its pay-for-performance philosophy, decreased the overall pay to Mr. Moynihan by approximately 6%. Compensation for that year’s other named executive officers also decreased between approximately 5% and 7% based on 2022 performance.\n\nLeading up to our 2023 annual meeting, two U.S. proxy advisory firms recommended—for the first time ever—that their subscribers vote “against” our “Say on Pay” proposal. We believe these recommendations contributed significantly to the lower support received in 2023, as some of our institutional investors follow the voting recommendations of these firms and some others are influenced by their analyses and recommendations. In total, of the approximately 5.7 billion votes cast at the meeting, 69.1% favored our “Say on Pay” proposal.\n\nIn light of the result of our 2023 “Say on Pay” vote, which differed significantly from our prior history, and in order to ascertain the reasons for the decline, we intentionally refocused our 2023 and early 2024 shareholder engagements more directly on our executive compensation program and disclosures than in prior years.\n\nExecutive Compensation Engagements\n\nWe value the views and input of our shareholders. Input received from our shareholder engagement is critical to how we drive progress in our corporate governance practices, including our executive compensation program. Generally, we engage with our investors year-round through targeted, active outreach and responsiveness to inbound inquiries.\n\nWe targeted our 2023 and early 2024 outreach efforts and actively solicited input from shareholders on our executive compensation program and disclosures. We specifically solicited input on our executive compensation program as part of our engagement agenda, welcoming dialogue with those who supported and those who did not support our “Say on Pay” proposal last year. During 2023, into early 2024 we reached out to 84 institutional shareholders, representing approximately 79% of institutionally held shares,(1) and held a total of 72 meetings with 46 shareholders. We also solicited input from the two U.S. proxy advisory firms and held multiple meetings with each over this period.\n\nOur Lead Independent Director, Mr. Nowell, and our Compensation and Human Capital Committee Chair, Ms. Lozano, played a central role in these discussions. Mr. Nowell and Ms. Lozano actively led 41 of our shareholder engagement meetings as well as two of the meetings with the U.S. proxy advisory firms.\n\nOverall, investors expressed their understanding and support for our compensation program and structure and its alignment with the tenets of Responsible Growth. We focused on listening to shareholders to understand why they had voted against “Say on Pay” last year, and to confirm their expectations of an appropriate response to regain support.\n\nWe received specific input on two key areas that contributed to a lower “Say on Pay” vote result in 2023: 1) one-time awards and 2) transparency in the pay decision process. This input, along with a range of perspectives and suggestions received during our shareholder engagement, informed the Committee’s decision to implement enhancements to our 2023 compensation program and disclosures. For details on “What we heard and how we responded” see page 55.\n\n54\n\nBANK OF AMERICA\n\nCompensation discussion and analysis\n\niii. Stock ownership & retention requirements\n\nOur stock ownership and retention requirements align executive officer and shareholder interests by linking the value realized from equity-based awards to sustainable company performance. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines require:\n\nMinimum shares of common stock owned\n\nRetention Chief Executive Officer 500,000 shares 50% of net after-tax shares received from equity-based awards retained until one year after retirement Other Executive Officers 300,000 shares 50% of net after-tax shares received from equity-based awards retained until retirement\n\nIn light of our policy, we expect new executive officers to be in compliance with these requirements within five years. Full-value shares and units owned, awarded, or deemed beneficially owned are included in the stock ownership calculations; PRSUs are included only when earned and stock options are not included. All named executive officers are in compliance with their ownership requirements. Our Code of Conduct prohibits our executive officers from hedging and speculative trading of company securities. See the “Hedging policy” section on page 36 for more information on our hedging policy and rules.\n\n6. Other compensation topics\n\na. Results for performance restricted stock units\n\nPRSUs have been a component of our executive compensation program since 2011. PRSUs require recipients to re-earn awards over the performance period based on achievement of established performance standards and help align management with shareholder interests. Since 2013, PRSUs have been based 50% on three-year average ROA and 50% on three-year average growth in adjusted TBV standards. Our practice is not to make discretionary adjustments to PRSU results for the impact of legacy litigation, fines, and penalties, or impairment charges, which have contributed to outcomes for PRSU payouts since their introduction.\n\nThe 2021 PRSUs completed in 2023 were re-earned at 100% of the target opportunity based on ROA results of 92 bps and adjusted TBV results of 11.09% (compared to 100% target opportunity based on 2021 PRSU performance standards set at ROA results of ≥ 80 bps and TBV results of ≥ 8.5%)(1). We did not adjust the calculation of these performance metrics to reflect the FDIC special assessment and BSBY cessation charges in fourth quarter 2023. See the description of the 2021 PRSUs and vesting terms following the “Grants of plan-based awards table” on page 74 of our 2022 proxy statement.\n\nThe maximum payout opportunity is 100% for all outstanding awards.\n\nThe award terms for these PRSUs provide for the calculation of performance results at the conclusion of each calendar year in the performance period. As a result, the performance results above may differ from the results reported under GAAP in our company’s audited financial statements.\n\nThree-year Average ROA was the average “return on assets” for the three calendar years in the performance period. For this purpose, “return on assets” was determined at the conclusion of the year based on the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) at the conclusion of each year definition and, to the extent necessary, normalized to exclude the material effects of changes in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and related regulations adopted after the first day of the performance period.\n\nThree-year Average Growth in Adjusted TBV was the average year-over-year percentage change in “adjusted tangible book value” for the three calendar years in the performance period. For this purpose, “adjusted tangible book value” for each year equaled our total common shareholders’ equity, less (a) the impact of any capital actions approved (or not objected to) by the Federal Reserve Board and/or approved by our company’s Board, and less (b) the sum of the carrying value of: (i) goodwill and (ii) intangible assets excluding mortgage servicing rights; adjusted for (iii) deferred tax liabilities directly related to: (i) and (ii). Each year-over-year percentage change was measured after the conclusion of each calendar year using the beginning balance as of January 1 and the ending balance as of December 31 of that year and, to the extent necessary, was normalized to exclude the material effects of changes in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and related regulations adopted after the first day of the performance period.\n\n2024 PROXY STATEMENT\n\n71\n\nCompensation discussion and analysis\n\nb. 2023 Competitor group\n\nOur Compensation and Human Capital Committee periodically reviews compensation practices of competitors to evaluate market trends, pay levels, and relative performance in executive compensation, but without any formulaic benchmarking. The Committee constructs a peer group that best reflects the unique complexity of our business. Given our size and scale, we consider five primary competitors and eleven leading financial institutions. All U.S. peers are used for CEO pay-for-performance benchmarking analysis:\n\nInformed by discussions with our shareholders, our Compensation and Human Capital Committee assessed our competitor group in 2023 with support from our independent compensation consultant, Farient Advisors. To include appropriate companies from a competitive and strategic perspective, the Committee evaluated companies by criteria including industry, size, and business characteristics. For the leading financial institutions (previously referred to as leading international financial institutions), the Committee determined a more well-rounded group of seven U.S. and four international institutions representing the business segments in which we operate, including banking, credit card, and wealth management, would be useful for pay-for-performance analysis.\n\nThe updated 2023 competitor group is provided below.\n\n2023 Competitor Group Primary competitors Leading financial institutions\n\n• Citigroup\n\n• Morgan Stanley\n\n• American Express\n\n• HSBC\n\n• Goldman Sachs\n\n• Wells Fargo\n\n• Barclays\n\n• PNC\n\n• JPMorgan Chase\n\n• BlackRock\n\n• Truist\n\n• Blackstone\n\n• UBS\n\n• Capital One\n\n• U.S. Bancorp\n\n• Deutsche Bank\n\nGeneral industry peers. From time to time, the Committee also reviews executive compensation for a leading group of global companies headquartered in the U.S. spanning all industries to get a general perspective on compensation practices for companies of similar size and global scope. For 2023, these general industry peers were: Alphabet, Apple, Chevron, Cisco, Coca-Cola, Exxon Mobil, Home Depot, IBM, Intel, Johnson & Johnson, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, PepsiCo, Pfizer, Procter & Gamble, Verizon, and Walmart.\n\n2023 competitor group updates (reflected above). The Committee did not make any changes to the primary competitors. The Committee amended the leading financial institutions competitors to better balance international and U.S. peers, adding American Express, BlackRock, Blackstone, Capital One, PNC, Truist, and U.S. Bancorp and removing BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse, and Royal Bank of Canada. In addition, the Committee added Alphabet, Apple, Home Depot, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft to the general industry peers and removed Abbott Laboratories, AT&T, ConocoPhillips, General Electric, and Philip Morris International.\n\nc. Retirement benefits\n\nWe provide our named executive officers the opportunity to save for their retirement via employee and employer contributions to qualified and nonqualified defined contribution plans on the same terms as other U.S.-based salaried employees. These plans help us attract and retain key people by providing a means to save for retirement.\n\nCertain named executive officers also participate in various frozen qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans. For more information about these plans, see “Pension benefits table” and “Nonqualified deferred compensation table” on pages 81 and 82, respectively.\n\n72\n\nBANK OF AMERICA\n\nExecutive compensation\n\n2023 All other compensation table\n\nFor certain amounts reported in the “Summary compensation table” and this table, the incremental cost to us in providing the benefits differs from the out-of-pocket cost and is determined as follows:\n\nBenefit\n\nDetermination of incremental cost\n\nBenefit, tax, and financial advisory services\n\nDetermined using a method that takes into account our actual direct expenses (such as rent, applicable compensation and benefits, and travel) paid with respect to our employees who provide benefit, tax, and financial advisory services to our named executive officers and other eligible executives.\n\nUse of corporate aircraft\n\nFor corporate-owned or leased aircraft, determined using a method that takes into account variable costs such as landing fees, aircraft fuel expense, and plane repositioning costs. Since we use our aircraft primarily for business travel, we do not include the fixed costs that do not change based on usage, such as crew salaries and the acquisition costs of corporate-owned or -leased aircraft. For aircraft provided by a third-party vendor, determined using a method that takes into account the contracted per-hour costs, fuel charges, segment fees, and taxes, as well as a proportional share of the monthly management fee and insurance costs. Aggregate incremental cost, if any, of travel by the named executive officer’s spouse or guest when accompanying the named executive officer also is included.\n\nAll use of our corporate aircraft by our named executive officers in 2023 was consistent with our policy. In late 2017, we amended our policy to require Mr. Moynihan to use only corporate aircraft for all business, commuting, and personal flights. We generally do not consider amounts related to business- and/or business-development related flights as compensation to Mr. Moynihan, and we consider the amounts related to Mr. Moynihan’s required personal and commuting use of our corporate aircraft to be necessary business expenses for reasons of security, personal safety, and efficiency. However, SEC rules require that we include in the “Summary compensation table” the value of certain flights or portions of certain flights as a perquisite.\n\nTherefore, the amount shown for Mr. Moynihan for use of corporate aircraft primarily reflects the aggregate incremental cost to our company for: (i) elements of business- and/or business-development related flights and (ii) all personal flights taken for non-commuting, non-business purposes. Under his aircraft time-sharing agreement, during 2023 Mr. Moynihan reimbursed our company for certain incremental costs of flights on our corporate aircraft for commuting purposes. Mr. Moynihan is responsible for his own taxes on any imputed income resulting from his personal use of our corporate aircraft.\n\nThe tax equalization and related fees amount shown for Mr. Koder represents tax equalization payments and related preparation fees for trailing income from restricted stock units granted prior to April 1, 2019. The agreement providing for tax equalization rights was entered into prior to Mr. Koder’s appointment as an executive officer and his relocation to the United States.\n\nThough included in the “Summary compensation table” as “All other compensation,” this table does not include any incremental cost to us for certain meals received by named executive officers while working in the office, any travel expenses to attend company meetings by named executive officers’ spouses or guests, cybersecurity benefits, or any other incidental event-related expenses incurred during the year.\n\nNeither the amounts noted in the “Summary compensation table” nor those noted in this table include any amounts for personal benefits provided to our named executive officers for which we believe there is no aggregate incremental cost to us, including assistance with travel arrangements and use of corporate-owned or -leased apartments and vehicles, and travel by spouses or guests on corporate or third-party vendor aircraft and the use of ground transportation and shared lodging when accompanying an executive traveling for a business-related purpose.\n\n2024 PROXY STATEMENT\n\n75\n\nExecutive compensation\n\nPension benefits table\n\nThe following table provides information regarding the retirement benefits our named executive officers may receive under our defined benefit pension plans in which they participate, all of which have been frozen (meaning that benefits are no longer accruing for compensation or service after the plan freeze date).\n\nPension benefits in 2023\n\nThe following describes the material features of our pension plans in which the named executive officers participate.\n\nQualified pension plan. During 2023, Messrs. Moynihan, Borthwick, and Athanasia each participated in one of the legacy components of The Bank of America Pension Plan (Legacy Pension Plan). The component plans are cash balance pension plans where notional cash balance accounts grow based on notional credits. As of June 30, 2012, participants no longer receive compensation credits or years of credited service under the Legacy Pension Plan.\n\nParticipants in the legacy Fleet component plan continue to receive notional interest credits based on the one-year U.S. Treasury Note yield, subject to a minimum annual rate of 3.25%. Participants in the legacy Bank of America component plan continue to receive notional interest credits based on the 10-year U.S. Treasury Note yield for their post-2007 accounts and notional investment credits based on selected investment choices for their pre-2008 accounts.\n\nAll participating named executive officers are vested under the Legacy Pension Plan and can receive their cash balance account in a lump-sum, or an actuarial equivalent form of benefit.\n\nNonqualified pension plans. During 2023, certain named executive officers held accounts in one or more of the following:\n\n•\n\nThe Bank of America Pension Restoration Plan (Legacy Pension Restoration Plan)\n\n•\n\nRetirement Income Assurance Plan for Legacy Fleet (Legacy RIAP)\n\n•\n\nFleetBoston Financial Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (Legacy Supplemental Retirement Plan)\n\nThe Legacy Pension Restoration Plan and Legacy RIAP provide benefits for qualified pension plan participants whose retirement benefits were reduced due to IRS limits on qualified plans. These plans were frozen, at the same time the qualified plan was frozen, effective June 30, 2012. Each participating named executive officer’s nonqualified pension plan benefits are fully vested and payable as either a lump-sum or annual installments over a period of up to 10 years beginning in a year after termination (other payment options may be available for legacy benefits).\n\nMr. Moynihan’s Legacy Supplemental Retirement Plan benefit is equal to a percentage of final average compensation (based on compensation previously frozen in 2005), reduced by benefits from the legacy Fleet component of the Legacy Pension Plan, and the Legacy RIAP. Mr. Moynihan’s participation in the Legacy Supplemental Retirement Plan was frozen at his request effective December 31, 2005, and he elected this benefit to be payable as a lump-sum payment determined using the actuarial assumptions in effect under the Legacy Pension Plan in 2005.\n\n2024 PROXY STATEMENT\n\n81\n\nExecutive compensation\n\nLegacy supplemental plan. Messrs. Moynihan and Athanasia each have an account under the FleetBoston Financial Corporation Executive Supplemental Plan (Legacy Supplemental Plan), which is a nonqualified retirement savings plan that allowed deferrals above the IRS limits on qualified plans. This plan was closed to contributions in 2004. Payments are made in a lump-sum or up to 15 annual installments beginning in the year of termination of employment or any later year elected by the participant, but not beyond the year in which the participant turns 65.\n\nLegacy ESA plan. Mr. Athanasia has a nonqualified deferred compensation account that was established prior to FleetBoston’s merger with Bank of America Corporation and funded by employer contributions (Legacy ESA Plan). This plan was closed to contributions in 2004. Upon his termination of employment, Mr. Athanasia will be paid in equal installments over a one-year restrictive covenant period, unless he terminates due to death or disability.\n\nPotential payments upon termination or change in control\n\nWe do not have any agreements with our named executive officers that provide for cash severance payments upon termination of employment or a change in control. In addition, since 2002, we have maintained the Bank of America Corporation Corporate Policy Regarding Seeking Stockholder Approval of Future Severance Agreements (the Severance Agreement Approval Policy). Under our Severance Agreement Approval Policy, we will not enter into employment or severance agreements with our executive officers that provide severance benefits exceeding two times base salary and bonus (as defined under the Severance Agreement Approval Policy), unless the agreement has been approved by our shareholders.\n\nPotential payments from equity-based awards\n\nOur equity-based awards to our named executive officers include standard provisions that cause awards to vest or be forfeited upon termination of employment, depending on the reason for termination. These provisions for awards granted in 2023 are described in more detail on page 76, and those details can be found for awards granted in prior years in our prior proxy statements.\n\nIn general, our awards provide for continued payments on the original schedule after certain types of termination of employment, subject to the following conditions, as applicable in individual award agreements:\n\nAwards to our named executive officers under the BACEP are generally designed to be paid per schedule if an executive’s employment is terminated without “cause” or for “good reason” within two years after a change in control. This change in control treatment is often referred to as “double trigger” vesting, because it requires both: (i) a change in control and (ii) a subsequent involuntary termination (either by our company without “cause” or by the executive for “good reason”). The BACEP does not provide our executive officers “single trigger” vesting upon a change in control.\n\nIf a named executive officer is terminated for “cause,” our equity-based awards provide that the awards will be forfeited.\n\nThe following table shows the value of equity awards that would have been payable, subject to the non-compete or compliance with covenants, as applicable, for a termination of employment as of December 31, 2023. For this purpose, restricted stock units were valued at our closing price as of December 29, 2023, which was $33.67 per share. Due to a number of factors that affect the nature and amount of any benefits provided upon termination of employment, any actual amounts paid or distributed may vary from the amounts listed below. Factors that could affect these amounts include the time during the year of any such event, any accrued but unpaid cash dividend equivalents and related interest, and the price of our common stock.\n\n2024 PROXY STATEMENT\n\n83\n\nProposal 3: Ratifying the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm for 2024\n\nOur Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention, and oversight of our independent registered public accounting firm, and is involved in the selection of the firm’s lead engagement partner who is subject to a mandatory, regular rotation and who may provide services to our company for a maximum of five consecutive years. In selecting and approving a lead engagement partner, the Committee relies on relevant succession criteria established by management and the Committee, interactions with prospective candidates, assessments of their professional experience, and input from our company’s independent registered public accounting firm. The Committee also engages in an annual evaluation of the independent registered public accounting firm. It considers, in particular, whether the retention of the firm is in the best interests of our company and its shareholders, taking into account the firm’s quality of service, the firm’s institutional knowledge and experience, the firm’s international capabilities, the firm’s sufficiency of resources, the quality of the communication and interaction with the firm, and the firm’s independence, objectivity, and professional skepticism. The Committee also considers the advisability and potential impact of selecting a different independent registered public accounting firm.\n\nAfter assessing the qualifications, performance, and independence of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), which has served as our company’s independent registered public accounting firm since 1958, the Committee believes that retaining PwC is in the best interests of our company. The Committee has appointed PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm to audit the 2024 consolidated financial statements of Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries. Although it is not required to do so, our Board is asking shareholders to ratify PwC’s appointment. If our shareholders do not ratify PwC’s appointment, the Committee will consider changing our independent registered public accounting firm for 2024. Whether or not shareholders ratify PwC’s appointment, the Committee may appoint a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time if it determines that such a change is appropriate.\n\nPwC has advised the Committee that it is an independent accounting firm with respect to our company and its affiliates in accordance with the requirements of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.\n\nRepresentatives of PwC are expected to be present at our annual meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement if they choose, and are expected to be available to respond to appropriate shareholder questions.\n\nPwC’s 2023 and 2022 fees. PwC’s aggregate fees for professional services rendered in or provided for 2023 and 2022, as applicable, were:\n\n2023 2022 ($ in millions)\n\nAudit fees\n\n56.7 55.5\n\nAudit-Related fees\n\n6.4 7.0\n\nTax fees\n\n5.5 5.9\n\nAll other fees\n\n0.0 0.0\n\nTotal fees\n\n68.6 68.4\n\nAudit fees. Audit fees relate to the integrated audit of our consolidated financial statements, and internal control over financial reporting, including disclosures presented in the footnotes to our company’s financial statements (for example, regulatory capital, among other disclosures). Audit fees also relate to the audit of domestic and international statutory and subsidiary financial statements, the review of our interim consolidated financial statements, the issuance of comfort letters and SEC consents, and services provided in connection with certain agreed-upon procedures and other attestation reports. Audit fees are those billed or expected to be billed for audit services related to each fiscal year.\n\nAudit-related fees. Audit-related fees cover other audit and attest services, services provided in connection with certain agreed-upon procedures and other attestation reports, financial accounting, reporting and compliance matters, benefit plan audits, and risk and control reviews. Fees for audit-related services are those billed or expected to be billed for services rendered during each fiscal year.\n\nTax fees. Tax fees cover tax compliance, advisory, and planning services and are those billed or expected to be billed for services rendered during each fiscal year.\n\nAll other fees. During 2023 and 2022, all other fees consisted primarily of amounts billed or expected to be billed for the company’s engagement of PwC to provide technical subscription services rendered during each fiscal year.\n\n88\n\nBANK OF AMERICA\n\nAudit Committee Report\n\nAudit committee pre-approval policies and procedures\n\nOur Audit Committee annually pre-approves a list of services that PwC may provide without obtaining the Committee’s engagement-specific pre-approval and sets pre-approved fee levels for such services. The pre-approved list of services consists of audit services, audit-related services, tax services, and all other services. All requests or applications for PwC services must be submitted to members of our corporate audit function or tax function to determine if they are included within the Committee’s pre-approved list of services. The Committee or the Committee chair must specifically approve any type of service that has not been pre-approved. The Committee or the Committee chair must also approve any proposed service that has been pre-approved but has fees that will exceed the pre-approved level. All pre-approvals by the Committee chair must be presented to the full Committee at its next meeting. The Committee or the Committee chair pre-approved all of PwC’s 2023 fees and services.\n\nAudit Committee Report\n\nOur Audit Committee is composed of five Board members. Our Board has determined that all Committee members are independent under the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) listing standards, our Director Independence Categorical Standards, and applicable U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and regulations. Our Board has also determined that all Committee members are financially literate in accordance with NYSE listing standards and qualify as “audit committee financial experts” as defined by SEC rules. The Committee’s responsibilities are stated in a written charter adopted by our Board.\n\nManagement is responsible for preparing and the overall reporting process with respect to our company’s consolidated financial statements, and, with the assistance of our company’s internal corporate auditors, for establishing, maintaining, and assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), our company’s independent registered public accounting firm, is responsible for planning and conducting an independent audit of our company’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the United States Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and for expressing an opinion as to the conformity of these financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. The Committee’s responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes.\n\nThe Committee annually evaluates PwC’s qualifications, performance, and independence. The Committee also oversees the performance of the corporate audit function managed by our Chief Audit Executive. The Committee has reviewed and discussed with management and with PwC our company’s audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our company’s internal control over financial reporting, and PwC’s evaluation of our company’s internal control over financial reporting. In addition, the Committee has discussed with PwC the matters that independent registered public accounting firms must communicate to audit committees under applicable PCAOB standards.\n\nThe Committee has also discussed and confirmed with PwC its independence from our company, and received all required written disclosures and correspondence required by the PCAOB Ethics and Independence requirements. The Committee has evaluated and concluded the non-audit services provided by PwC to our company do not impair PwC’s independence.\n\nBased on the reviews and discussions referred to above, and discussions with the Committee’s independent disclosure counsel, the Committee recommended to our Board that the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the related footnotes be included in our company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nSubmitted by the Audit Committee of the Board:\n\nSharon L. Allen, Chair\n\nJosé E. Almeida\n\nArnold W. Donald\n\nDenise L. Ramos\n\nMichael D. White\n\n2024 PROXY STATEMENT\n\n89\n\nBackground\n\nThe BACEP was last amended and approved by shareholders in 2023 with more than 94% of shareholder votes cast in favor of the amendment, which included the addition of 75 million shares available for grant. Under the Plan, we have reserved a number of shares of our common stock for issuance to employees (including executive officers) as equity-based awards in the form of restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs), stock options, and SARs and for issuance to non-employee directors as restricted stock awards. The BACEP is currently scheduled to expire on April 24, 2033.\n\nIn March 2024, our Board approved the amendment and restatement of the BACEP to increase the number of common shares available to grant, subject to the approval of our shareholders at the annual meeting.\n\nImpact of the amendment and restatement based on information as of March 1, 2024\n\nAs of March 1, 2024, under the current authorization, there are approximately 67 million shares of common stock available for grant as equity- based awards under the BACEP. Based on our current grant practices, these shares would last less than one year, while the current BACEP term has nine years remaining. We believe it is appropriate to increase the number of shares of our common stock available for awards under the BACEP so that our company can continue the practice of granting deferred equity-based awards in lieu of cash.\n\nWe estimate the total dilutive effect of the BACEP and our legacy stock plans on our shareholders (sometimes called “overhang”) resulting from the amendment and restatement would be approximately 5.3%, with the incremental overhang resulting from the requested share increase equal to approximately 1.3%. The overhang is calculated as follows, in each case as of March 1, 2024:\n\nBased on data available as of December 31, 2023, our level of overhang was lower than the average for our primary competitor group. Additionally, our rate at which we grant equity awards relative to shares of our common stock outstanding (sometimes referred to as “run rate”) was below the average run rate for our primary competitor group on a one-year and three-year average basis. If the proposed amendment and restatement is approved, we expect the pool of requested shares to last approximately one year, assuming we maintain similar grant practices as over the past two years and assuming, hypothetically, our current stock price remains constant.\n\nThe number of shares remaining available for grant under the BACEP as noted in the previous table differs from those reported as of December 31, 2023 because that information does not take into account year-to-date grants during 2024 for the 2023 performance year.\n\nInformation regarding the number of shares remaining available for grant as required by SEC disclosure rules are discussed in detail in this proposal under “Additional information” on page 96.\n\nThe list of companies included in our primary competitor group is detailed under “2023 Competitor group” on page 72.\n\nPurpose of the Plan\n\nThe Plan, and the proposed amendment and restatement of it, is intended to serve a critical role in our pay-for-performance compensation program and is necessary for us to comply with the regulatory landscape in certain jurisdictions. In addition, our Board believes that equity-based awards aid in our ability to attract, retain and motivate our employees and are the most direct way to align employee interests with those of shareholders. As part of our pay-for-performance practices, more than 100,000 employees receive variable incentives. More highly compensated employees receive a portion of their variable incentive as deferred RSUs. The portion of the variable incentive deferred as equity-based awards generally increases with compensation levels according to a predetermined deferral grid. RSUs are also a significant component of the Sharing Success stock awards that have been or will be made to approximately 97% of employees in March 2024. Most Sharing Success awards are in the form of company common stock, providing the opportunity to further share in our company’s long-term success. The RSU awards are a key\n\n2024 PROXY STATEMENT\n\n91\n\npart of our pay-for-performance philosophy, and in many cases are required by law, rule, and regulation. In addition, our executive officers receive PRSUs that must be re-earned by meeting specific performance criteria, as described on page 68 for awards granted in February 2024. Equity awards granted to employees are subject to cancellation and clawback features which encourage appropriate behavior and manage risk in our compensation program; these features are described on page 70. Granting RSU awards that include deferral, cancellation, and clawback features is a key risk-balancing mechanism in our pay-for-performance compensation program, and serves to align employee interests with shareholder interests while complying with regulatory requirements.\n\nThe value of RSUs tracks the price of our common shares. Compensation expense is in the compensation and benefits expense line of the income statement.\n\nThe Plan, and the proposed amendment and restatement of it, is intended to be the company’s vehicle for delivering deferred equity-based awards. Since April 2021, the amount of common stock awarded has averaged approximately 110 million shares each year, which includes approximately 23.3 million shares to be granted in March 2024 under the Sharing Success award program leaving approximately 43 million shares remaining for future awards. The Board has determined to increase the shares of our common stock available for awards under the Plan by 100 million shares to enable the granting of Plan awards in the future. The alternative would be to increase the use of deferred cash awards, which we believe would reduce alignment with shareholder interests. Therefore, the Board recommends the amendment and restatement to increase the number of shares of common stock available for awards under the Plan.\n\nIn addition, the company has and continues to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount at least equal to the value of stock-settled equity awards as they are recognized into capital. These share repurchases offset the net new shares of common stock delivered under the BACEP. The company currently intends to continue this repurchase practice. The company’s common stock repurchases are subject to required regulatory and Board approvals.\n\nThe additional 100 million shares to be authorized under the BACEP would allow our company to continue current grant practices for approximately one year.\n\nOverview of the amendment and restatement\n\nThe following is a summary of the material terms of the proposed amendment and restatement and is qualified, in its entirety, by reference to the terms of the BACEP. A copy of the BACEP, approved by the Board in March 2024, is attached to this proxy statement as Appendix B. The only proposed material change to the Plan is an increase by 100 million shares to the number of shares available for awards under the Plan. There are no proposed changes to the shareholder-friendly design features of the Plan, summarized on page 90. The proposed amendment and restatement will become effective only if the BACEP is approved by our shareholders.\n\nNumber of shares\n\nThe BACEP, as last approved by shareholders in 2023, provides that the aggregate number of shares of our common stock available for grants of awards under the Plan from and after January 1, 2015 will not exceed the sum of (i) 450 million shares, plus (ii) any shares that were subject to an award as of December 31, 2014 under the BACEP, if such award is canceled, terminates, expires, lapses or is settled in cash for any reason from and after January 1, 2015, plus (iii) effective upon April 24, 2019, 150 million shares, plus (iv) effective upon April 20, 2021, 115 million shares, plus (v) effective upon April 25, 2023, 75 million shares. As of March 1, 2024 there were approximately 67 million common shares available for future awards under the BACEP. The amendment and restatement, if approved by shareholders, would increase the number of shares available for awards by 100 million shares, to approximately 167 million shares estimated based on information available on March 1, 2024.\n\nUnder the BACEP, each award, whether granted as a stock option, SAR, restricted stock share or RSU, counts against the available share pool as one share for each share awarded.\n\nThe share re-use provisions under the BACEP do not include any “liberal share counting” features for stock options or SARs. Shares used to cover the exercise price of stock options or to cover any tax withholding obligations in connection with awards of stock options or SARs will continue to be unavailable for awards under the BACEP. In addition, the total number of shares covering stock-settled SARs or net-settled options will be counted against the pool of available shares, not just the net shares issued upon exercise. The BACEP does allow shares withheld to cover any tax withholding obligations in connection with awards of restricted stock or RSUs to again be available for future awards under the BACEP. Shares covered by awards will also continue to be available for awards if and to the extent (a) the award is canceled or forfeited or (b) the award is settled in cash.\n\n92\n\nBANK OF AMERICA\n\nAdministration\n\nThe Compensation and Human Capital Committee (Committee) administers the BACEP. To the extent permitted by law, the Committee may designate an individual or committee (which need not consist of directors) to act as the appropriate committee under the BACEP for granting awards to employees who are not “officers” under Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Under the BACEP, the Committee has authority with respect to the following:\n\nThe Board will continue to administer grants of restricted stock under the BACEP to non-employee directors.\n\nEligibility\n\nEmployees of Bank of America and its subsidiaries may participate in the BACEP, as selected by the Committee. Eligible employees are those employees of Bank of America and its subsidiaries who have made, or are expected to make, important contributions to our business, as determined by the Committee, including persons employed outside the United States. Approximately 195,000 employees are expected to be eligible to participate. However, as mentioned above, the Committee in its discretion selects which employees will receive any awards. The BACEP also provides for awards of restricted stock to non-employee directors as part of our director compensation program. All 12 of the non-employee directors nominated for election at the annual meeting are eligible to receive these restricted stock awards. As noted elsewhere in this proxy statement, as part of our director compensation program, our Board grants restricted stock to directors on the day of their election or appointment as a director. Any director nominee that receives at least a majority of votes cast at the annual meeting will be elected at the annual meeting and will be eligible to receive the restricted stock award as part of their 2024-2025 director compensation. In the event this proposed amendment and restatement does not receive at least a majority of the votes cast at the annual meeting, and the amendment and restatement does not become effective, there are enough common shares remaining for issuance to grant directors elected at the annual meeting the 2024-2025 restricted stock award.\n\nTypes of awards\n\nThe BACEP permits awards of stock options, SARs, restricted stock shares and RSUs to employees and restricted stock shares to non-employee directors, all of which are described in more detail below.\n\nAwards of stock options and SARs. The BACEP provides for the grant of options to purchase shares of our common stock at option prices which are not less than the fair market value of a share of our common stock at the close of business on the date of grant. (The fair market value of a share of our common stock as of March 1, 2024, was $34.35.) The BACEP also provides for the grant of SARs to employees. SARs entitle the holder upon exercise to receive either cash or shares of our common stock or a combination of the two, as the Committee in its discretion may determine, with a value equal to the difference between: (i) the fair market value on the exercise date of the shares with respect to which a SAR is exercised; and (ii) the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant.\n\nAwards of options under the BACEP, which may be either incentive stock options (which qualify for special tax treatment) or nonqualified stock options, are determined by the Committee. No more than an aggregate of 450 million shares may be awarded as incentive stock options under the BACEP. The terms and conditions of each option and SAR are to be determined by the Committee (or its designees) at the time of grant.\n\nOptions and SARs granted under the BACEP will expire not more than 10 years from the date of grant, and the award agreements en"
