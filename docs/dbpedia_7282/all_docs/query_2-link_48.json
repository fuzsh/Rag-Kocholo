Whether an employee chooses to drink socially is a decision of the individual.\n\n(e) No State employee will have his job security or promotion opportunities jeopardized by his request for counseling or referral assistance.\n\n(f) The confidential nature of medical records of employees with drinking problems will be preserved in the same manner as all other medical records.\n\n(g) Sick leave will be granted for the purpose of participating in public and private treatment and rehabilitation programs which have been approved by the South Carolina Department of Mental Health.\n\n(h) Employees may voluntarily seek counseling and information on an entirely confidential basis by contacting agencies designated to provide such services.\n\nHISTORY: 1962 Code Section 1-42.3; 1972 (57) 2810.\n\nSECTION 8-11-120.

Mandatory state agency furlough programs; consultation and guidance services.\n\nIn a fiscal year in which the general funds appropriated for a state agency are less than the general funds appropriated for that agency in the prior fiscal year, or in a fiscal year in which an agency that is funded by other funds projects other funds collections to be less than in the prior fiscal year, or whenever the General Assembly or the Executive Budget Office implements a midyear across-the-board budget reduction, agency heads may institute employee furlough programs of not more than ten working days in the fiscal year in which the deficit is projected to occur.\n\nThe furlough program must be:\n\n(1) inclusive of all employees in an agency or within a designated department or program regardless of source of funds or place of work, including all classified and unclassified employees in the designated area; or\n\n(2) based upon pay band for classified employees and based upon pay rate for unclassified employees within the agency or designated department respectively.\n\nIf the state agency will incur costs for overtime under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act, law enforcement employees and correctional employees may be exempted from a mandatory furlough. Employees who provide direct patient or client care and front-line employees who deliver direct customer services may be exempted from a mandatory furlough. The mandatory furlough must include the agency head. Constitutional officers are exempt from mandatory furlough. Scheduling of furlough days, or portions of days, shall be at the discretion of the agency head, but under no circumstances should the agency close completely.\n\nDuring this furlough, affected employees shall be entitled to participate in the same state benefits as otherwise available to them except for receiving their salaries. As to those benefits that require employer and employee contributions including, but not limited to, contributions to the South Carolina Retirement System or the optional retirement program, the state agencies, institutions, and departments are responsible for making both employer and employee contributions if coverage would otherwise be interrupted; and as to those benefits which require only employee contributions, the employee remains solely responsible for making those contributions.\n\nPlacement of an employee on furlough under this provision does not constitute a grievance or appeal under the State Employee Grievance Procedure Act.\n\nIn the event the reduction for the state agency, institution, or department is due solely to the General Assembly transferring or deleting a program, this section does not apply. The implementation of a furlough program authorized by this section shall be on an agency-by-agency basis. Agencies may allocate the employee's reduction in pay over the balance of the fiscal year for payroll purposes regardless of the pay period within which the furlough occurs. In the event that an agency implements both a voluntary furlough program and a mandatory furlough program during the fiscal year, furlough days taken voluntarily shall count toward furlough days required by the mandatory furlough.\n\nThe Department of Administration shall promulgate guidelines and policies, as necessary, to implement the provisions of this section. State agencies shall report information regarding furloughs to the Office of Human Resources of the Department of Administration.\n\nThe Office of Human Resources of the Department of Administration must provide consultation and guidance to each state agency implementing a furlough or reduction in force regarding the long term career development of its employees and the potential financial benefit of implementing a furlough program or reduction in force.\n\nThe provisions of this section do not apply to employees of those state agencies or institutions covered by Section 8-11-193, and Section 8-11-193, rather than this section continues to apply to those employees in the manner provided by law.\n\nHISTORY: 2009 Act No. 8, Section 1, eff May 6, 2009.\n\nSECTION 8-11-193.

The furlough must be inclusive of all employees regardless of source of funds, place of work, or tenure status, and must include employees in classified positions and unclassified positions as well as agency heads. Scheduling of furlough days, or portions of days, shall be at the discretion of the agency or individual institution. During the furlough, affected employees shall be entitled to receive the same state benefits as otherwise available to them except for receiving their salaries. For benefits which require employer and employee contributions including, but not limited to, contributions to the South Carolina Retirement System or the optional retirement program, institutions will be responsible for making both employer and employee contributions during the time of the furlough if coverage would otherwise be interrupted. For benefits which require only employee contributions, the employee remains solely responsible for making the contributions. Placement of an employee on furlough pursuant to this section does not constitute a grievance or appeal under the State Employee Grievance Act. In the event an institution's reduction is due solely to the General Assembly transferring or deleting a program, this section does not apply. The implementation of a furlough program authorized by this section shall be on an institution by institution basis.\n\nHISTORY: 2008 Act No. 353, Section 2, Pt 1.A.1, eff July 1, 2008.\n\nSECTION 8-11-194.

However, a furlough only may be authorized by unanimous consent of the board and only as a last resort alternative to a reduction in force of state employees. Furloughs may be authorized for the time considered necessary by the board but may not exceed ten days in a fiscal year nor more than two days in a pay period. No furlough may be authorized before January fifteenth of the fiscal year in which the deficit is projected to occur.\n\n(B) If the Budget and Control Board authorizes a furlough, to the extent practical it must be statewide in nature and inclusive of all employees regardless of source of funds, place of work, or tenure. The furlough must include employees in classified positions and unclassified positions as well as agency heads.\n\n(C) Employees placed on furlough are on leave without pay status, without a break in service, with full continuation of all insurance benefits, and with continuing accumulation of sick and annual leave benefits.\n\nHISTORY: 1995 Act No. 145, Part II, Section 23, eff June 29, 1995.\n\nCode Commissioner's Note\n\nAt the direction of the Code Commissioner, reference in this section to the former Budget and Control Board has not been changed pursuant to the directive of the South Carolina Restructuring Act, 2014 Act No. 121, Section 5(D)(1), until further action by the General Assembly.\n\nSECTION 8-11-196.

If the employee further reduces the amount of the leave carried over to forty-five days or less, forty-five days is the maximum amount of unused annual leave the employee may accumulate.

Such employees shall be entitled to accumulate up to the maximum accumulation allowed state employees. These provisions shall not obligate the school to provide monetary compensation for unutilized days accumulated beyond the maximum allowed state employees.\n\nHISTORY: 1962 Code Section 1-91.9; 1962 (52) 1691; 1972 (57) 2525; 1974 (58) 2172; 1982 Act No. 405, Section 3; 1985 Act No. 201, Part II, Section 78.\n\nSECTION 8-11-620.

Upon termination of state employment and participation in the Teacher and Employee Retention Incentive Program, a lump-sum must be paid for unused leave, not to exceed forty-five days, unless a higher maximum is approved pursuant to Section 8-11-610, and without regard to the earned leave taken during the calendar year in which the employee retires.\n\n(4) No lump-sum for unused leave of a state employee must be paid following the termination for any reason from state employment of that employee if, while employed, that employee received a service retirement benefit on account of previous service under retirement systems established in Chapters 1 and 11 of Title 9.\n\n(B) A retired member of the South Carolina Police Officers Retirement System who is hired by the State, a state agency, institution of higher learning, board, commission, or school that is a governmental unit of this State is not eligible for a lump-sum payment for unused leave provided pursuant to subsection (A) of this section.\n\nHISTORY: 1962 Code Section 1-91.10; 1962 (52) 1691; 1972 (57) 2525; 1974 (58) 2172; 1976 Act No. 621 Section 1; 2002 Act No. 356, Section 10, eff July 1, 2002; 2005 Act No. 153, Pt II, Section 1.A, eff July 1, 2005; 2016 Act No. 202 (S.381), Section 1, eff June 3, 2016.\n\nEditor's Note\n\nThe Teacher and Employee Retention Incentive Program, Section 9-1-2210, was repealed by 2012 Act No. 278, Part I, Section 16, effective July 1, 2018.\n\nSECTION 8-11-630.
