        "text": "Page Content\n\n​​School principals must establish a Student Support Group (SSG) for every child and young person in Out-of-home care.\n\nWhat is a Student Support Group?​\n\nThe Student Support Group represents a partnership in the educational planning process between:\n\nthe parents/guardians/carers of the student\n\nthe parent/guardian/carer’s advocate\n\nthe teacher/s\n\nthe principal or nominee (to act as chairperson)\n\nthe student (where appropriate).\n\nThe aims of the Student Support Group are to:\n\nensure that those with the most knowledge of, and responsibility for the student, work together to establish shared goals for the student's educational future\n\nplan reasonable adjustments for the student to access the curriculum\n\nprovide educational planning that is ongoing throughout the student's life\n\nmonitor the progress of the student.\n\nThe Student Support Group is responsible for:\n\nidentifying the student’s needs\n\ndetermining any adjustments to be made to the curriculum, teaching and learning\n\nplanning an appropriate educational program\n\ndeveloping a personalised learning and support plan\n\ndiscussing the plan with teachers and providing support to implement the learning plan\n\nproviding advice to the principal concerning the additional educational needs of the student and what may be required to meet these needs\n\nreviewing and evaluating the student’s program once per term, and at other times if requested by any member of the group.\n\nSee the following guidelines for the Student Support Group, including the templates for personalised learning and support planning:\n\nStudent Support Group - Guidelines for Schools and Families\n\nTemplate 1 - Understanding the Student\n\nTemplate 2 - Goal setting\n\nTemplate 3 - Recording achievement\n\nTemplate 4 - Program evaluation\n\nRole\n\nThe Student Support Group is responsible for:\n\ndeveloping an Individual Education Plan for each student\n\nmonitoring a student's progress in line with the Individual Education Plan Guidelines.\n\nSee ​Individual Education Plans.\n\nAim\n\n​​The aim of a SSG is to:\n\nhelp plan programs that address a child's individual needs for positive achievement, engagement at school and their ability to learn\n\nsupport attendance and establish shared educational and social goals.\n\nWhat is the purpose of a Student Support Group?\n\nThe SSG brings together the people responsible for the wellbeing and education of the student in out-of-home care.\n\n‘(The Student Support Group) ensures that those with the knowledge and responsibility for the child or young person work together to support engagement, attendance and achievement, and establish shared educational and social goals. This group also monitors and evaluates the child\n\nor young person’s progress2’.\n\nHow frequently should an SSG be held?\n\nThe initial SSG should be held within the first week of the student being enrolled at the school and following this, meetings should occur at least twice per year, but more frequently if required.\n\nWho should attend?\n\nThe following is a list of relevant people that may attend SSGs:\n\nMembers should include:\n\nThe case manager from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and/or a Community Service Organisation (CSO) or an Aboriginal Community-Controlled Organisation (ACCO)\n\nA teacher, year level coordinator, the Learning Mentor and Principal or Vice Principal\n\nStudent wellbeing staff member and/or student support services officer\n\nThe child or young person (where age-appropriate)\n\nThe carer or child or young person’s parent\n\nOther relevant support services\n\n“ My role is to always be there for the student. It's all about personal connections. I make sure that I find something endearing about each child, and let them know it. It's important to keep giving positive messages.” - Rob, Viewbank Secondary College.\n\nWhat should happen during meetings?\n\nAttendees should provide information about the student that will support him/her in their education. Attendees identify the child or young persons’ strengths and needs and utilise the SSG to develop an Individual Education Plan (IEP). The group devises strategies to optimise student wellbeing and achievement and to address potential barriers and challenges to engagement.\n\nFurther, it is important that the Learning Mentor is able to advocate for the student, and/or that the student is included and involved in the discussions, likely to have ideas about what might work better for them.\n\nWhat are some best practice tips in running a SSG meeting?\n\nThe Principal or other nominee from the school should assume the role of meeting Chair.\n\nThe Chair should:\n\nprepare the agendas and facilitate meetings\n\nensure that the meeting follows the agenda within the allocated time\n\ntake minutes and document/disseminate key actions amongst participants in a timely manner\n\nmembers should respect each other’s views, knowledge and expertise, and collaborate as a team to meet the best of the student\n\ncarers are likely to have the greatest understanding of the child and young person, and it is integral that their meaningful participation is supported. Members should consider the language and terminology used during meetings to ensure that all members, in particular carers and students,are informed, comfortable and have the capacity to equally participate\n\nregular meetings should be scheduled in advance to ensure the availability of all members\n\nadditional meetings should be held on as-needed basis, if requested by group members to discuss particular matters in a more timely fashion\n\nmeetings should provide opportunities for reflection and creative problem-solving.\n\nHow it should operate\n\nA school must hold at least one meeting a year, with extra meetings held at the request of the DHS case manager, parent, guardian or caregiver.\n\nThe purpose of a meeting is to:\n\nidentify the needs and strengths of the child\n\ndevelop a plan to support attendance\n\naddress management issues\n\ndevelop strategies to enhance achievement\n\ncommunicate responsibilities to the child\n\ncommunicate what the school expects from them and how it can support them.\n\nTo record and document SSG meetings, use the Student Support Group Meeting Record (doc - 64kb)\n\nFor more information, see Resources.\n\nBack to top\n\nLast Update: 05 October 2021"
