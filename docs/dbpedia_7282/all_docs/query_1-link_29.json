And we want more people to try it out and experience the benefits firsthand\n\nAchieve 3 badges during the Challenge - 50 points Grow your skills and challenge yourself! (Note max of 100 points given for badges earned in April)\n\nIndividual Encourager Points\n\nWhen someone signs up and logs their first ride for the Challenge, they are asked to identify whether someone in particular encouraged them. If they identify you as their encourager, then you get points - 100 points if the person you encouraged is new to riding (they have rarely been on a bike in the last 12 months, if at all), and 50 points if they already ride (regularly or occasionally). So get your colleagues riding, smiling and taking part in the Challenge too!"
