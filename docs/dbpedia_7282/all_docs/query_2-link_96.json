        "text": "Responsible Individuals Responsible Officer Policy Owner Primary Contact\n\nSee Contacts Table above\n\nDefinitions\n\nActively at Work\n\nEmployees must be physically present, working, and able to work the full scheduled appointment hours for the foreseeable future. They must not be on any form of leave of absence, including, but not limited to, vacation, personal leave, FMLA, or sick leave.\n\nBase Pay\n\nAppointment salary which includes augmentation (if continuous). A temporary augmentation, shift differential, lump sum payments, bonuses, etc., are not considered base pay.\n\nContinuous Service\n\nService commencing on the employee's most recent date of hire with the University of Minnesota in an appointment of 75 percent or greater, with an appointment term of nine months or more, and ending on the employee's last day of employment. The employee must be in a continuous appointment (or temporary one provided the employee transferred to a temporary appointment within their seniority unit from a continuing appointment without a break in service). This period is non-continuous if it is broken by a voluntary termination of employment - no matter how brief. Periods of leave of absence, disability, part-time service, or involuntary layoff (if less than two years) would bridge periods of continuous service. Such permitted periods in which eligible service was not performed, however, do not count toward the number of years of service credited under the plan.\n\nTo obtain a year of continuous service, the employee must work at least 1,560 hours (i.e., an employee on a 12-month appointment could take a 3-month leave of absence and the year would still count, while an employee on a 9-month appointment taking the same 3-month leave of absence would lose credit for that year). If the employee has at least 1,560 hours in the final year, they must be employed on the anniversary date to count as a year of service.\n\nA student appointment in 2xxx or any of the 95xx classifications will not be credited and will be considered a break in service. Employment prior to any appointments in the 2xxx or 95xx classifications is not credited. Service credit would begin with the resumption of non-student, non-professionals-in-training employment.\n\nIf an employee changes appointments between one employee category to another (e.g., P&A to Civil Service), the service will be considered continuous as long as there is no break longer than two pay periods.\n\nLayoff Rights\n\nLayoff rights for civil service and labor-represented employees include bumping rights, priority for rehire, Regents Scholarship eligibility, and the University's six-month health care extended benefits which is normally available to employees with three or more years of continuous service.\n\nYear of Service\n\nA 12-month period in which the employee worked at least 1,560 hours in an appointment term of nine months or more and in an appointment of 75 percent time or greater. One full year of service is credited for each anniversary from the employee's most recent hire date through the last day of employment.\n\nWeek of Pay\n\nOne week of pay is equal to the employee's regular hourly rate times the number of hours per week (maximum of 40) the employee was regularly scheduled to work as of the last day of employment.\n\nResponsibilities\n\nDivision/Department\n\nDirects employee receiving a layoff notice to this policy, procedure, and appendices.\n\nManages the layoff process for the employee.\n\nEnters appropriate data into the Human Resource Management System (HRMS).\n\nEmployee\n\nProvides timely notice to the division/department of the choice to accept the terms of Layoff Severance Program for Civil Service and Union-Represented Staff Employees.\n\nFollows appropriate procedures.\n\nContacts area unemployment office for more information as desired.\n\nOffice of Human Resources\n\nDirects employee receiving a layoff notice to this policy, procedure, and appendices\n\nHistory\n\nAmended:\n\nSeptember 2016 - Comprehensive Review, Minor Revision. 1. Simplifies language for clarity and removes repetitive language. 2. Moves more detailed clarifications on COBRA and benefits to FAQ or definitions. 3. Remove reference to same-sex domestic partners.\n\nAmended:\n\nMarch 2010 - Clarification was made to the requirement that the employee must be actively at work on the last day of employment.\n\nAmended:\n\nMay 2008 - Policy converted to the new University-wide format for administrative policies. Title was changed to Layoff Severance Program for Civil Service and Union-Represented Staff Employees, formerly Civil Service and Represented Bargaining Unit Staff Layoff Severance Program.\n\nAmended:\n\nJune 2005 - (1) Rule of 75 elimination effective July 1, 2005 for AFSCME Unit 6 members;\n\n(2) The Civil Service Staff Layoff Severance Program and Bargaining Unit Staff Layoff Severance Program were combined into the Civil Service and Represented Bargaining Unit Staff Layoff Program.\n\nAmended:\n\nFebruary 2003\n\nAmended:\n\nApril 2003 - (1) Minor edits to clarify language.\n\n(2) Rule of 75 elimination effective April 30, 2003 for civil service staff; effective May 8, 2003 for IBEW Local 292 members; and Effective June 3, 2003 for AFSCME Unit 7 members whereby if the sum of the employee's full years of continuous University service and age on the last day of employment was 75 or greater, then the University medical and/or dental coverage was continued until the last day of the month in which the employee became eligible for Medicare of other group coverage, whichever came first;\n\n(3) eligibility criteria added requiring (a) an appointment term of nine months or greater on the issue date of the layoff notice and (b) employment through the effective date of layoff;\n\n(4) exclusion added making employees on hourly appointments ineligible for the program;\n\n(5) requirement added whereby the employee, in exchange for participating in program, agrees to not reapply for or be rehired for University employment for a period equal to the number of weeks of severance pay received; and\n\nAdopted:\n\nSeptember 2002 - The Civil Service and Bargaining Unit Staff Layoff Program was divided into two separate documents, Civil Service Staff Layoff Severance Program and Bargaining Unit Staff Layoff Severance Program.\n\nAmended:\n\nMarch 1995, May 1994, and March 1994\n\nAdopted:\n\nAugust 1993 - U of MN Layoff/Non-Renewal Program for Civil Service and Professional and Administrative Employees.\n\nAmended:\n\nMarch 1993, August 1992, and November 1991\n\nAdopted:\n\nAugust 1991 - Voluntary Retirement/Health Benefits Program; Termination/Severance Program\n\nEffective:\n\nSeptember 2002"
