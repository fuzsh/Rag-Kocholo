        "text": "Insecurity exercise for today: Compliment yourself for anything good that you do throughout the day. Since we insecurity addicts rarely think anything we’ve done as good, pay attention to your actions and see them clearly. At first, that’s really hard to do. It’s like looking at your reflection in the mirror and that reflection only sneers contempt. I used to look at my life through shit-colored glasses; everything was tinged and dirty. I never saw myself doing anything “just right,” even my own kindness. I’d do something nice but think I should help more, do a better job, stop being so hungry for praise; never satisfaction in a job well done. There was always that vicious inner voice bitching at me. I didn’t realize it at the time, but that eternally cruel voice in my head was an insecurity addiction. Just like a substance addiction, my brain was wired to believe every cruel self hatred attack I could dream up. So this exercise helps break the cycle of Never Enough. You probably won’t feel any difference at first, even think your self compliments are a blasphemous lie. But keep doing it. It’s like learning a new language. Persistent repetition is the key.\n\n𝐀𝐧𝐱𝐢𝐞𝐭𝐲 𝐢𝐬 𝐚𝐧 𝐚𝐝𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧, please don’t read this if you are weak-hearted. When I used to prepare for my 𝐂𝐀 𝐟𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐞𝐱𝐚𝐦, I would have prepared for 18 hours a day for months together but when exams came closer, the nervousness stroked in so much that I would want to vomit, or find it difficult to breathe, unable to eat and unable to sleep, the gastric issue would not let me study till I vomit it out. Elders called it “Pitta dosha” After writing my exam, I would be fine. Again, on the exam day, the process repeats. And this went on for the groups I wrote. With an increasing number of attempts the problem on the day of the exam remained the same. I used to tell myself, it’s an exam, once I clear it, everything will be alright. And yes, once I cleared my exam, the anxiety issue just went away. We all celebrated by saying - 'All is well that ends well'. What I did not realise is that stress and anxiety became a part and parcel of my life subconsciously that now I was craving for it. The lesson I learnt was only if you stress and feel anxious you will be successful else you are not serious. It became an addiction. An addiction that assured me that no work can be done with perfection until you do not stress or remain anxious. A young girl in me who would pull off the mike and speak out loud as a teenager, could no more even eat food unless that speech was done. The pettish feeling in my stomach was a pattern telling me I would ace it only if I were going through this. I can’t have it any other way. It took my friends and family to sit me down and tell me that my behavior was not normal. It was okay till exams because it was a part of my life, but it is not okay anymore. Now there was a need for damage recovery as this cannot be a normal way of living. And I started working on it. I no longer wanted to react but only respond. I would not lie on this platform; I still am working on it. I am not over this stage yet. I still feel breathless when I have to decide things while in reality, I could do it calmly with grace. Many people make fun of me, saying why do you stress so much, it's so negative. But my journey is mine and not for anyone to judge. 𝐓𝐨 𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐬𝐭𝐮𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬, if you feel the same as I did, if you are in the same boat, once you are done with your exams, I would request you to analyse this pattern and break it before it becomes an addiction in your life. It’s really hard to get out of this. You have two choices, either party hard and tell yourself that it was simply a phase. Or 𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐩𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐫𝐨𝐰 𝐢𝐭 𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭 𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐨𝐟 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐥𝐢𝐟𝐞 before it becomes an 𝐚𝐝𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧. It takes guts to put down the vulnerable side, but if it even helps one student right now, all I know is your parents are going to shower me with blessings and that I need the most right now! #CA #ACCA #CMA #CFA #CPA\n\nI hate to be the one to tell you, but you're probably an addict. I know, because it takes one to know one. 🧐 But you're not addicted to what you probably worry about. It's deeper than some bad habits, regretful behaviors and substance abuse. It's an addiction to filling a void where self love should be. In the words of Yung Pueblo: \"I was never addicted to one thing, I was addicted to filling a void within myself with things other than my own love.\" ( go buy his books, they are all amazing) Look, I'm not an addiction therapist, but I've learned a thing of two about this addiction to filling the void, both from the dozens of clients I've helped through this, as well as my own lived experience. I too was caught up in this trance of unworthiness for decades, until the pain of filling the void with things that don't really help got too painful. Eventually I asked for help. I did the hard inner work. I got better. But it's not a one and done thing. It requires vigilance and daily practice of making choices in alignment with the person you want to be. It requires daily reminders to love yourself. But you also don't have to navigate this alone. You have options. You have support. DM me if this resonates with you, and let's talk about it. Also, i'm going to try to do more video moving forward. Let me know what you think of this format in the comments below! I'm rooting for you.\n\n#VALIDATION / #APPROVAL #ADDICTION Approval addiction is a term used to describe the unhealthy need for validation and acceptance from others. It is a #psychological condition that can have a negative impact on an individual's self-esteem and overall well-being.... By definition, seeking Validation is the desire to have someone else's approval or agreement with what you say, believe, or do. Unlike narcissism, validation addiction happens primarily because of crippling insecurity, bad self-image, low self-esteem, self-hatred, distorted thinking or believing they are not enough. Validation addicts aren't capable of handling a normal, healthy relationship most of the time. According to Karyn Hall, PhD: “Validation is the recognition and acceptance of another person's thoughts, feelings, sensations, and behaviors as understandable. Self-validation is the recognition and acceptance of your own thoughts, feelings, sensations and behaviors as understandable.” The three types of validation are emotional, behavioral and cognitive. #Cognitive Validation is reading minds and finding patterns. #Emotional validation is identifying and clarifying emotions. #Behavioural validation is acknowledging and understanding the behaviour patterns. These are used as therapies in counseling. But when individuals get addicted to seeking validation for whatever they do, wherever they go, it affects concentration, focus, also it increases attention seeking behaviour, and goes to the extent of mental/ emotional disturbances, mental suffocation- affecting relationships . #Narcissists seek endless validation, attention, and praise to compensate for low self-esteem, confidence, and a perceived lack of acceptance. These struggles are often a result of early childhood #trauma and #attachment issues. Typically, the narcissist did not receive enough love as a child. Quite often when we look externally for validation it's because we aren't sure we are enough. We need others to tell us that what we are doing is okay, or that we are accepted. Validation addiction puts you at risk for #depression, #anxiety, #burnout and #anger. How to Stop Being Addicted to Approval : Try Self Assertiveness #conviction Learn to Set #HealthyBoundaries. Seek Approval From Yourself First. #selfapproval Limit Social Media Exposure. Think About What YOU Want. Learn to #LoveYourself. 1. Working on the relationship we have with ourselves is the first step to getting better at self-validating. 2. Start noticing when you're doing something for approval versus really wanting to. When you've been putting your needs last for so long, it often becomes unclear what you're doing to make others happy versus because you really want to. 3. CONNECT AND BE WITH YOUR #AUTHENTIC SELF\n\nWHEN HABITS BECOMES ADDICTION “Habits are a result of a mental activity but addiction affects mental stability”* There is a thin line between our habits and getting addicted to things. Habits are activities we love doing to an extent it becomes part of us, our brain becomes used to it. You might ask , “ Do we love every part of our habits?” No, there are bad habits also, which we are conscious of, in control and the effects it has on us are mostly negligible. Procrastination, sleeping late and taking soda are few bad habit we all struggle with. Bad habits when left uncheck leads to ADDICTION. Addiction is a chronic disease of the brain, that we unconsciously can't control and are the extreme form of our habits. We get addicted to substance like drugs, caffeine and foods. Certain behaviors when practiced overtime also leads to compulsive addiction like gambling, masturbation, and the use of the internet. How can I overcome my Addiction? Becoming an addict is easy when you ignore your bad habits - That's the PROGRESSION. - Tame your habits at the early stage.. LEARN being disciplined - Look for new addiction: The best practical way to get over an addiction is by finding a new positive addiction. A) Watching Porn > Watch videos on YouTube on self improvement. B) Excessive Soda Intake > Taking water Devise more positive addiction that can bring you closer to self improvement. You can become addicted to improving yourself, chasing your dreams and achieving your GOALS. I'm counting on you.

People can turn to substances to cope with intense feelings of stress. Research has also shown that stress can actually cause epigenetic changes that influence the development of addiction and mental health conditions. These reactions mean stress can trigger changes that affect how your genes are expressed. Stress like the loss of a job, the death of a loved one, or a global pandemic can increase the risk of developing an addiction or relapsing. Additionally, stress plays an integral role in the brain’s reward system. The reward system is a complex combination of electrical signals and chemicals, like dopamine, in the brain. The reward system can be triggered by a number of different things, like eating something delicious or talking with friends. The brain learns to seek pleasurable activities that trigger the reward system, which in turn floods your body with feel-good chemicals. Drugs can trigger these same reward pathways, often resulting in a more powerful and long-lasting feeling of pleasure. When you are stressed, you can crave that feeling even more than you normally would. Over time, the reward threshold becomes higher — you need more of the same substance to produce the same feelings. Stress can trigger cravings, leading you to indulge in drinking or drugs. When you are unable to access that substance, you may go through withdrawal, triggering more stress and cravings."
