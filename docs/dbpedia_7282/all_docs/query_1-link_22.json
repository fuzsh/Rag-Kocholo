She is passionate about assisting students to reach their dream, especially females, who have an interest in STEM. Veena is always open to new ideas and ways to ensure that her students are receiving the best education that can be provided so that they can improve society. The knowledge that she has in her area of expertise has been recognised by those in the higher education area and peer organisations.”\n\n“I have known Veena for several years, during which time we collaborated on numerous STEM related initiatives. Most prominently, Veena was one of the first teachers in Victoria to grasp the RAMP (Robotics, Automation and Mechatronics Program) which I founded. She became an ambassador who drove the success of the program. Veena is an enthusiastic, passionate and very organised individual who works around the clock to ensure her students are at the forefront of technology. Her pedagogy has impressed many colleagues in the higher education sector with her ability to inspire students to never give up and always strive to make the impossible, possible! ”"
