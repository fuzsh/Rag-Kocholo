        "text": "U.S. Commission on Civil Rights\n\nSharing the Dream: Is the ADA Accommodating All?\n\nChapter 4\n\nSubstance Abuse under the ADA\n\nIt has been reported that 10 percent to 25 percent of the American population is sometimes on the job under the influence of alcohol or some illicit drug. The social and economic costs of substance abuse in America are staggering. In a report issued in 1998 by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and the National Institute on Drug Abuse, it is estimated that the cost of alcohol and drug abuse for 1995 was $276.4 billion, of which $166.5 billion was for alcohol abuse and $109.8 billion was for drug abuse.\n\nTitle I of the Americans with Disabilities Act specifically permits employers to ensure that the workplace is free from the illegal use of drugs and the use of alcohol, and to comply with other federal laws and regulations regarding drug and alcohol use. At the same time, the ADA provides limited protection from discrimination for recovering drug abusers and for alcoholics.\n\nThe following is an overview of the current legal obligations for employers and employees:\n\nAn individual who is currently engaging in the illegal use of drugs is not an individual with a disability when the employer acts on the basis of such use.\n\nAn employer may not discriminate against a person who has a history of drug addiction but who is not currently using drugs and who has been rehabilitated.\n\nAn employer may prohibit the illegal use of drugs and the use of alcohol at the workplace.\n\nIt is not a violation of the ADA for an employer to give tests for the illegal use of drugs.\n\nAn employer may discharge or deny employment to persons who currently engage in the illegal use of drugs.\n\nEmployees who use drugs or alcohol may be required to meet the same standards of performance and conduct that are set for other employees.\n\nEmployees may be required to follow the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 and rules set by federal agencies pertaining to drug and alcohol use in the workplace.\n\nWHEN ARE DRUG USERS COVERED UNDER THE ADA?\n\nThe ADA provides that any employee or job applicant who is currently engaging in the illegal use of drugs is not a qualified individual with a disability. Therefore, an employee who illegally uses drugs whether the employee is a casual user or an addict is not protected by the ADA if the employer acts on the basis of the illegal drug use. As a result, an employer does not violate the ADA by uniformly enforcing its rules prohibiting employees from illegally using drugs. However, qualified individuals under the ADA include those individuals:\n\nwho have been successfully rehabilitated and who are no longer engaged in the illegal use of drugs;\n\nwho are currently participating in a rehabilitation program and are no longer engaging in the illegal use of drugs; and\n\nwho are regarded, erroneously, as illegally using drugs.\n\nA former drug addict may be protected under the ADA because the addiction may be considered a substantially limiting impairment. However, according to the EEOC Technical Assistance Manual on the ADA, a former casual drug user is not protected:\n\n[A] person who casually used drugs illegally in the past, but did not become addicted is not an individual with a disability based on the past drug use. In order for a person to be substantially limited because of drug use, s/he must be addicted to the drug.\n\nWhat Is a Current Drug User?\n\nThe definition of current is critical because the ADA only excludes someone from protection when that person is a current user of illegal drugs. In her testimony before the Commission, Nancy Delogu, counsel to the Institute for a Drug-Free Workplace, stated, There is insufficient law on the issue right now and it is causing great difficulty for employers to determine exactly when they may take discipline against an employee.\n\nMark Rothstein, professor of law and director of the Health, Law and Policy Institute at the University of Houston, concurred with Ms. Delogu, testifying before the Commission that the EEOC should engage in some sort of interpretive statement and, after consulting with experts in the rehabilitation community,\n\ncould offer guidance that would be very helpful to employers in this area such as stating a particular length of time that an individual must be stable and making progress or require certification of an individual who had a substance abuse problem from some professional that they were making good progress before they would be covered [by the ADA], because . . . employers are having a difficult time making a determination. The courts have been reluctant to set out specific time periods, and this is an area that has caused a great deal of concern.\n\nThe EEOC has defined current to mean that the illegal drug use occurred recently enough to justify the employer's reasonable belief that drug use is an ongoing problem. The EEOC Technical Assistance Manual on the ADA provides the following guidance:\n\nIf an individual tests positive on a drug test, he or she will be considered a current drug user, so long as the test is accurate.\n\nCurrent drug use is the illegal use of drugs that has occurred recently enough to justify an employer's reasonable belief that involvement with drugs is an ongoing problem.\n\nCurrent is not limited to the day of use, or recent weeks or days, but is determined on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe Circuit Courts of Appeals have held that a person can still be considered a current user even if he or she has not used drugs for a number of weeks or even months. For example, in Zenor v. El Paso Healthcare Systems, Ltd., the court held that the employee, a pharmacist, was a current user because he had used cocaine five weeks prior to his notification that he was going to be discharged. In Salley v. Circuit City Stores, Inc., the court noted that it knew of no case in which a three-week period of abstinence has been considered long enough to take an employee out of the status of current user.\n\nIn Shafer v. Preston Memorial Hospital Corp., the court considered the ADA claim of a nurse who was stealing medication to which she had become addicted. While the hospital investigated the matter, the nurse was put in drug rehabilitation. The day after she finished her inpatient drug rehabilitation, she was notified that she had been terminated for gross misconduct involving the diversion of controlled substances.\n\nIn concluding that the plaintiff was still a current illegal drug user, the court noted that the ordinary or natural meaning of the phrase currently using drugs does not require that a drug user have a heroin syringe in his arm or a marijuana bong to his mouth at the exact moment contemplated. Rather, according to the court, someone is a current user if he or she illegally used drugs in a periodic fashion during the weeks and months prior to discharge.\n\nCan Enrolling in a Rehabilitation Program Provide ADA Protection?\n\nA question sometimes arises as to whether a drug addicted employee who breaks the company rules can, before being disciplined, enroll in a supervised drug rehabilitation program, and then claim ADA protection as a former drug addict who no longer illegally uses drugs. In her testimony before the Commission, Nancy Delogu stated:\n\nIt is causing great difficulty for employers to determine exactly when they may take discipline against an employee who may have had a disciplinary problem, tests positive or admits to a substance abuse problem, comes into rehabilitation for maybe 30 days. The employer waits until the employee returns to the work force and then says, All right, now we're going to talk about the problems we have, and the employee says, Hey, I'm disabled, I'm now covered by the ADA. . . . This provision actually serves as something of a disincentive to employers to offer rehabilitation and other services to employees before addressing any substantive performance problems.\n\nThe EEOC Technical Assistance Manual on the ADA states that such claims made by an applicant or employee will not be successful:\n\nAn applicant or employee who tests positive for an illegal drug cannot immediately enter a drug rehabilitation program and seek to avoid the possibility of discipline or termination by claiming s/he is now in rehabilitation and is no longer using drugs illegally. A person who tests positive for illegal use of drugs is not entitled to the protection that may be available to former users who have been or are in rehabilitation.\n\nNotwithstanding the EEOC's clear language, employees still attempt to use the argument in courts. When they do, the employer will argue and usually with success that the employee is a current user despite his or her recent admission into a drug rehabilitation program.\n\nFor example, in Collings v. Longview Fibre Co., the employer fired several employees for using illegal drugs at the facility. In their ADA lawsuit, seven of the eight plaintiffs said they had either completed drug rehabilitation programs or were in the process of rehabilitation at the time they were fired, so they were not current users. Some of the plaintiffs even took drug tests shortly after they were discharged to prove they were not currently using illegal drugs.\n\nThe court said current use was not limited to the use of drugs on the day of, or within a matter of days or weeks before the employment action in question. Rather, said the court, the provision is intended to apply to the illegal use of drugs that has occurred recently enough to indicate that the individual is actively engaged in such conduct. The plaintiffs were held to be current users and, despite the fact that they had entered or had completed a drug rehabilitation program, were not protected by the ADA.\n\nReasonable Accommodation for Drug Addicts\n\nThe duty to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals with disabilities is considered one of the most important statutory requirements of the ADA. If a recovering drug addict is not currently illegally using drugs, then he or she may be entitled to reasonable accommodation. This would generally involve a modified work schedule so the employee could attend Narcotics Anonymous meetings or a leave of absence so the employee could seek treatment.\n\nWHEN ARE ALCOHOL USERS COVERED UNDER THE ADA?\n\nIndividuals who abuse alcohol may be considered disabled under the ADA if the person is an alcoholic or a recovering alcoholic. Courts have usually held that alcoholism is a covered disability. For example, in Williams v. Widnall, the court flatly stated, without discussion, that alcoholism is a covered disability.\n\nSome courts have questioned whether alcoholism should automatically be designated as a covered disability. For example, in Burch v. Coca-Cola, the court held that alcoholism is not a per se disability and found that the plaintiff's alcoholism was not a covered disability because it did not substantially limit any of his major life activities. Similarly, in Wallin v. Minnesota Department of Corrections, the court suggested that it would analyze alcoholism on a case-by-case basis and noted that the plaintiff had not presented evidence that his alcoholism impaired a major life activity. Moreover, both Burch and Wallin are consistent with the United States Supreme Court's ruling in Sutton v. United Airlines, Inc., which stated clearly that an individualized inquiry will be conducted to determine whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity. As the Court explained in Sutton:\n\nA disability exists only where an impairment substantially limits a major life activity, not where it might, could, or would be substantially limiting if corrective measures were not taken. Second, because subsection (A) [of 42 U.S.C. 12102(2)] requires that disabilities be evaluated with respect to an individual and be determined based on whether an impairment substantially limits the individual's major life activities, the question whether a person has a disability under the ADA is an individualized inquiry.\n\nEven though courts may determine that alcoholism is a covered disability, the law makes it clear that employers can enforce rules concerning alcohol in the workplace. The ADA provides that employers may:\n\nprohibit the use of alcohol in the workplace;\n\nrequire that employees not be under the influence of alcohol in the workplace; and\n\nhold an employee with alcoholism to the same employment standards to which the employer holds other employees even if the unsatisfactory performance or behavior is related to the alcoholism.\n\nThe EEOC Technical Assistance Manual giving further guidance on the ADA provides that employers are free to discipline, discharge or deny employment to an alcoholic whose use of alcohol adversely affects job performance or conduct to the extent that s/he is not qualified. The manual elaborates with the following example:\n\nIf an individual who has alcoholism often is late to work, or is unable to perform the responsibilities of his/her job, an employer can take disciplinary action on the basis of the poor job performance and conduct. However, an employer may not discipline an alcoholic employee more severely than it does other employees for the same performance or conduct.\n\nFor example, if an alcoholic employee and a non-alcoholic employee are caught having a beer on the loading dock, the employer cannot fire the alcoholic employee while giving the other employee only a written warning. In Flynn v. Raytheon Co., the court dealt with this precise issue. It held that even though an employer can enforce its rules against intoxication on the job, it could not selectively enforce its rules in a way that treats alcoholics more harshly. In short, whatever policies the employer enacts must be uniformly applied.\n\nReasonable Accommodation for Alcoholics\n\nThe duty to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals with disabilities is considered one of the most important statutory requirements of the ADA. Reasonable accommodation for an alcoholic would generally involve a modified work schedule so the employee could attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, or a leave of absence so the employee could seek treatment. In Schmidt v. Safeway, Inc., for example, the court held that the employer must provide a leave of absence so the employee could obtain medical treatment for alcoholism.\n\nThe ADA does not require an employer to provide an alcohol rehabilitation program or to offer rehabilitation in lieu of disciplining an employee for alcohol-related misconduct or performance problems. In Senate proceedings, Senator Daniel Coats (R-IN) asked Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA), the ADA's chief sponsor, Is the employer under a legal obligation under the act to provide rehabilitation for an employee who is using . . . alcohol? In response, Senator Harkin stated, No, there is no such legal obligation. The Senate report echoes Senator Harkin's response that reasonable accommodation does not affirmatively require that a covered entity must provide a rehabilitation program or an opportunity for rehabilitation . . . for any current employee who is [an] alcoholic against whom employment-related actions are taken for performance or conduct reasons.\n\nThe EEOC has held that federal employers are no longer required to provide the reasonable accommodation of firm choice under Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act. Firm choice generally entails a warning to employees with alcohol-related employment problems that they will be disciplined if they do not receive alcohol treatment. The EEOC's rationale is that the Rehabilitation Act was amended in 1992 to apply ADA standards, and that the ADA does not require an employer to excuse misconduct for poor performance, even if it is related to alcoholism. In EEOC's Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship statement, the EEOC reiterated that an employer has no obligation to provide firm choice or a last chance agreement as a reasonable accommodation.\n\nMoreover, an employer is generally not required to provide leave to an alcoholic employee if the treatment would appear to be futile. For example, in Schmidt v. Safeway, Inc., the court said an employer would not be required to provide repeated leaves of absence (or perhaps even a single leave of absence) for an alcoholic employee with a poor prognosis for recovery. And in Fuller v. Frank, the court held that the employer was not required to give an alcoholic employee another leave of absence when alcohol treatment had repeatedly failed in the past.\n\nFinally, an employer generally has no duty to provide an accommodation to an employee who has not asked for an accommodation and who denies having a disability. In Larson v. Koch Refining Co., the court dealt with this precise issue and held that the employer had no obligation to provide accommodation to an employee with alcoholism when the employee did not ask for an accommodation, and in fact expressly denied having an alcohol problem.\n\nBlaming Misconduct on Alcoholism\n\nCourts routinely hold that employees cannot blame misconduct on alcoholism. For example, in Renaud v. Wyoming Department of Family Services, the court noted that even if alcoholism is assumed to be a disability, the ADA distinguishes between alcoholism and alcoholism-related misconduct. The court determined that the employer could lawfully terminate the employee (a school superintendent) for coming to work drunk, even though he claimed the conduct resulted from his alcoholism.\n\nIn Labrucherie v. Regents of the University of California, the court stated it was not discriminatory to fire an employee because he was incarcerated after his third arrest for drunk driving. The court noted that a termination based on misconduct stemming from a disability, rather than the disability itself, is valid.\n\nLikewise, in Maddox v. University of Tennessee, the university fired an assistant football coach after his third arrest for drunk driving. During the arrest, the assistant coach was combative and would not take a Breathalyzer test. The employee claimed that he was discriminated against based on his alcoholism because his drunk driving was a result of the alcoholism. The court agreed with the university that the misconduct could be separated from the alcoholism and that the assistant coach was properly terminated due to the misconduct.\n\nIt is clear that an employer does not, as a reasonable accommodation, have to forgive misconduct because the misconduct resulted from alcoholism. In Flynn v. Raytheon Co., the lower court noted that an employee who broke the company's policy prohibiting being under the influence of alcohol in the workplace cannot belatedly avail himself of the reasonable accommodation provisions of the ADA to escape discipline for his misconduct. The First Circuit also noted that the ADA does not require an employer to rehire a former employee who was lawfully discharged for disability-related failures to meet its legitimate job requirements.\n\nDIRECT THREAT POSED BY SUBSTANCE ABUSE\n\nThe defense of direct threat is one that is raised frequently by employers in dealing with issues of substance abuse. The ADA defines direct threat as a significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by reasonable accommodation. The ADA permits employers to require, as a job qualification, that an individual not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals in the workplace. Moreover, an employer may institute such a requirement even if an employer s reliance on such a qualification might screen out or tend to screen out or otherwise deny a job or benefit to an individual with a disability.\n\nThe determination that an individual with a disability poses a direct threat shall be based on an individualized assessment of the individual's present ability to safely perform the essential functions of the job. In determining whether an individual would pose a direct threat, the factors to be considered include:\n\nthe duration of the risk;\n\nthe nature and severity of the potential harm;\n\nthe likelihood that the potential harm will occur; and\n\nthe imminence of the potential harm.\n\nEvidence used in making the determination may include information from the individual, including the individual's experience in previous similar situations, and the opinions of doctors, rehabilitation counselors, or physical therapists who have expertise in the specific disability or who have direct knowledge of the individual.\n\nMoreover, the EEOC has emphasized, in its Interpretive Guidance on Title I of the ADA, that an employer may not deny employment to an individual with a disability merely because of a slightly increased risk. The risk can only be considered when it poses a significant risk, i.e., high probability of substantial harm; a speculative or remote risk is insufficient.\n\nEEOC v. Exxon Corporation\n\nIn EEOC v. Exxon Corporation, the courts were forced to analyze the ADA's direct threat defense and how it interacts with the business necessity defense. With respect to substance abuse and the ADA, courts have generally recognized an employer's prerogative to formulate and rely upon safety-based job qualifications, even though they may screen out individuals with disabilities.\n\nIn Exxon, the EEOC brought suit against Exxon on behalf of several employees, alleging that the company's blanket policy of prohibiting individuals who have ever been treated for drug or alcohol abuse from working in safety-sensitive designated positions (approximately 10 percent of Exxon's positions) violated the ADA. The EEOC argued that the company's policy was invalid on its face because it did not provide, as mandated by ADA regulations, for an individualized assessment of whether former drug abusers were qualified to work in any of the designated safety-sensitive positions.\n\nThe company countered by claiming that the ADA does not require an individualized assessment of an employee's risk of relapse where such an assessment would be impractical or impossible. The company argued that the risk of relapse for rehabilitated substance abusers is too great to permit them to work in the designated safety-sensitive positions, and that the inability to predict a relapse makes individualized assessments futile.\n\nThe U.S. District Court found that the ADA permits an exception to the individualized assessment ordinarily required under the law. The court relied on the ADA's emphasis on protecting employers from the risks posed by recently rehabilitated employees, and on other employment discrimination statutes that permit blanket exclusions where safety is an issue and the employer has reason to believe that all of the disqualified employees would be unable to perform safely.\n\nIn its appeal, the EEOC relied on its Interpretive Guidance to argue that employers must meet the direct threat defense:\n\nWith regard to safety sensitive requirements that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability or a class of individuals with disabilities, an employer must demonstrate that the requirement, as applied to the individual, satisfies the direct threat standard . . . in order to show that the requirement is job-related and consistent with a business necessity.\n\nThe Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals examined the text of the ADA and held while direct threat focuses on the individual employee and examines the specific risk posed by the employee's disability, business necessity addresses whether the qualification standard can be justified as an across-the-board requirement. The court determined that while Exxon's blanket across-the-board policy might exclude individuals with disabilities without an individualized analysis as to whether they could perform the essential functions of the position, this exclusion was appropriate if the employer could demonstrate that it is justified by business necessity.\n\nThe Exxon case generated significant debate during the Commission's ADA hearing. Nancy Delogu, counsel to the Institute for a Drug-Free Workplace, said it was important to resolve the issue. She testified:\n\nAlcoholism and substance abuse are chronic conditions for which the risk of relapse cannot be well . . . predicted. And for certain very, very highly safety-sensitive positions, those which have no . . . direct supervision and for which a lapse in judgment could lead to a catastrophic error, employers wish to be able to exclude those employees from those positions. Whether they're required to transfer them to another position would certainly be something open to a policy debate, but currently this is quite a concern.\n\nKenneth Collins, formerly the manager of the Employee Assistance Program at Chevron Corporation and currently vice president for Value Options, the nation s second largest provider of behavioral health care services, testified that the Chevron Corporation conducted a study on accident rates of its workers. The study concluded that workers who had completed Employee Assistance Program-monitored substance abuse rehabilitation had no more on-the-job or off-the-job accidents than did the regular Chevron population. Mr. Collins testified:\n\nIt certainly is my position based on my experience and the research done within Chevron and at other similar oil companies who have tightly structured employee assistance programs that, in fact, you can return individuals to highly safety-sensitive positions and not expose the company to increased risks of accidents or errors in judgment. But that is premised on having a rigorous follow-up program [which involves weekly follow-up testing].\n\nThe Exxon case suggests that an employer should carefully consider the context in which medical guidelines will be used; i.e., will medical guidelines be used as a basis for formulating job qualifications for safety-based reasons, or will they be used to assess, during a medical examination, whether an individual poses a direct threat. The ruling in Exxon suggests that an employer's reliance on medical guidelines may be more defensible when they are used to formulate a broad-based qualification than to assess an individual case.\n\nSome experts suggest that partly because of the publicity surrounding notorious cases like Exxon, companies can become too quick to designate a position as safety sensitive. Mark Rothstein, professor of law and director of the Health, Law and Policy Institute at the University of Houston, testified before the Commission that some employers have indeed been overly inclusive in the process of determining which positions are safety sensitive:\n\nI think some employers have an overly broad view of what a safety-sensitive position is and have . . . declared many jobs permanently unavailable to individuals who have ever had any sort of substance abuse problem, no matter how many years in the past. And I think that these policies are not substantiated by the scientific evidence and I think are directly counter to the purposes of the ADA.\n\nMr. Rothstein testified that while he thought a blanket policy was understandable in the Exxon case, he thought it ill-advised to adopt a basically irrebuttable presumption that anyone who has ever had a substance abuse problem should be barred for his or her lifetime from engaging in an activity that the employer deems to be safety sensitive. To illustrate his point, Mr. Rothstein referred to the case of Knox County Education Association v. Knox County Board of Education.\n\nIn Knox County, the Sixth Circuit upheld the drug testing of school personnel, including principals, teachers, aides, secretaries, and bus drivers, on the ground that because these individuals play a unique role in the lives of children, all the positions were deemed to be safety sensitive, including the people who worked in the office. Mr. Rothstein testified:\n\nIt seems to me that if you broaden the concept of safety sensitive as far as that court and applied it in the workplace, now you're basically saying that anyone who ever had a minor substance abuse problem in college 25 or 30 years ago, they're now barred from who knows how many jobs. That strikes me as not being based on any good facts or any good policy.\n\nEllen Weber, director of the national office of the Legal Action Center, a law and policy office that specializes in alcohol, drug, and AIDS issues, concurred with Mr. Rothstein. She testified before the Commission, We . . . agree to a great extent with . . . what Mr. Rothstein has said with regard to the issues of employers overly expanding the list of safety-sensitive jobs to which people are rejected from blanketly.\n\nPRE-EMPLOYMENT INQUIRIES ABOUT DRUG AND ALCOHOL USE\n\nAn employer may make certain pre-employment, pre-offer inquiries regarding use of alcohol or the illegal use of drugs. An employer may ask whether an applicant drinks alcohol or whether he or she is currently using drugs illegally. However, an employer may not ask whether an applicant is a drug abuser or alcoholic, or inquire whether he or she has ever been in a drug or alcohol rehabilitation program. Indeed, the EEOC has provided extensive guidance of what can and cannot be asked through its Enforcement Guidance titled Pre-employment Disability-Related Questions and Medical Examinations.\n\nAfter a conditional offer of employment, an employer may ask any question concerning past or present drug or alcohol use as long as it does so for all entering employees in the same job category. The employer may not, however, use such information to exclude an individual with a disability, on the basis of a disability, unless it can show that the reason for exclusion is job related and consistent with business necessity, and that legitimate job criteria cannot be met with a reasonable accommodation.\n\nDRUG TESTING\n\nAn employer may conduct tests to detect illegal use of drugs. The ADA does not prohibit, require, or encourage drug tests. Drug tests are not considered medical examinations, and an applicant can be required to take a drug test before a conditional offer of employment has been made. An employee also can be required to take a drug test, whether or not such a test is job related and necessary for the business.\n\nAn employer may refuse to hire an applicant or may discharge or discipline an employee based upon a test result that indicates the illegal use of drugs. The employer may take these actions even if an applicant or employee claims that he or she recently stopped illegally using drugs.\n\nTests for illegal use of drugs also may reveal the presence of lawfully used drugs, i.e., prescription medications. If a person is excluded from a job because the employer erroneously regarded him or her to be a drug abuser, currently using drugs illegally, and a drug test revealed the presence of a lawfully prescribed drug, the employer would be liable under the ADA. There was testimony at the Commission's ADA hearing to suggest that this problem should be examined more closely to see if it is leading to costly and unnecessary litigation in the workplace. Nancy Delogu told the Commission:\n\nWith drug abuse in the workplace and the number of individuals who are subject to drug testing, anyone who ever has a positive drug test, theoretically, can claim to be perceived as disabled by his or her employer or would-be employer. As a result, many cases have been brought, and many which are quite frivolous based on a positive drug test. The employer is going to do whatever they are going to do and then the employee says, Well you saw me as disabled and I'm going to sue. Unfortunately, that's an issue of fact that requires usually lengthy discovery and litigation costs before that can be resolved.\n\nTo avoid such potential liability, the employer would have to determine whether the individual was using a legally prescribed drug. An employer may not ask what prescription drugs an individual is taking before making a conditional job offer; however, an employer may validate a positive test result by asking about an applicant's lawful use of drugs or for other possible explanations for the positive test result. Alternatively, the EEOC Technical Assistance Manual on the ADA suggests:\n\n[O]ne way to avoid liability is to conduct drug tests after making an offer, even though such tests may be given at anytime under the ADA. Since applicants who test positive for illegal drugs are not covered by the ADA, an employer can withdraw an offer of employment on the basis of illegal drug use.\n\nMark Rothstein, professor of law and director of the Health, Law and Policy Institute at the University of Houston, endorses this EEOC recommendation. He testified at the Commission's ADA hearing:\n\nThis is a problem that can be avoided very simply by employers who defer drug testing until the post-offer stage, that is the pre-placement stage when there are no restrictions on inquiries regarding medical conditions or substances that could cause cross-reactivity. The reason that many employers don't want to . . . defer the testing until the post-offer stage is they think it's cheaper to screen out workers or potential workers on the basis of a positive drug test than it is to review their r sum's and applications and references and to actually look at the individual. And that may well be true, but I think that's a rather unconvincing reason to me, at least, for subjecting individuals to this violation of their privacy that Congress otherwise said was impermissible."
