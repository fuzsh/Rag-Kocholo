        "text": "Working across Washington\n\nI spoke with the Washington Association of Prosecuting Attorneys about public safety and justice in Washington communities, including my office’s efforts to combat the opioid epidemic, the Sexual Assualt Kit Initiative, and our proposed Cold Case Unit.\n\nIn December, I met some of my office’s recently hired employees and had the privilege of learning about the diverse perspectives and expertise they bring to the AGO. Not only do they bring lots of invaluable work experience, they also have wide-ranging interests outside of work, including carpentry, aviation, volunteer work and travel.\n\nI visited the University of Washington – Tacoma where I spoke about the federal litigation my office has undertaken to protect the rule of law and hold powerful interests accountable. I did this by discussing the first travel ban, how it harmed Washingtonians, my standing to bring the suit, as well as my legal arguments. I also talked about DACA and the public charge rule. I am proud to show students – and possibly future attorneys – how the power of law can be a tool for good, and why it is an important tool to bring a voice to the voiceless.\n\nI spoke with the Center for Human Services about the impact the opioid crisis has on Washington’s human services programs. I also explained actions my office has taken against Purdue Pharma and the three largest opioid distributors, as well as what Washington is doing to help tackle this opioid epidemic.\n\nI had the opportunity to sit down with AARP on New Day NW to talk about scam robocalls. We discussed who’s most affected, common types of calls, and steps people can take to verify if the call is real, what to do if victimized by a scammer, and why citizens should report scam calls.\n\nI had the honor of speaking at the Companis Healthy Communities Biennial Celebration of 25 years of non-profit volunteer organizing. I spoke with them about how my own volunteer opportunities with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps led to some of my most memorable experiences and lessons. As a community volunteer, I learned that listening is central to social justice, and that the law and courts not can only can give the marginalized a voice, but give them justice. I also spoke about my office’s community outreach, as well as our federal litigation against the travel ban and in defense of Dreamers.\n\nI spoke at an event called “Meaningful Movies” — one of a series of public screenings of movies and documentaries often focusing on social justice and other meaningful topics. I spoke about my office’s involvement with litigation and policies related to Japanese-American internment. Moreover, how it relates to the travel ban attempted by the Trump Administration. I also spoke about the important civil rights lessons learned from Fred Korematsu, the subject of the events documentary.\n\nThis year marks the 30th anniversary of the Centennial Accord, a document signed by then-Gov. Booth Gardner and tribal leaders affirming tribal sovereignty and setting out new structure for communication and problem-solving between governments. I had the opportunity to speak to Washington tribal leaders at their annual meeting with the state under the Accord. I shared my office’s work on areas of mutual interest, such as our lawsuit challenging a federal effort to weaken the Endangered Species Act, as well as issues of particular importance to our tribal partners, such as supporting the legal defense of the Indian Child Welfare Act and the Native American Voting Rights Act. I also shared about my office’s first-of-its-kind Tribal Consent and Consultation Policy, centered on obtaining free, prior and informed consent before my office takes certain actions that could impact tribes. I’m grateful for the opportunity to continue to strengthen our relationships with Washington’s tribal nations.\n\nI was given the opportunity to speak at a Veterans Appreciation Luncheon at the Bellingham Technical College. The Bellingham Tech Foundation recently funded a new veteran resource center that provides free food, a space to meet, computers, printing and tutoring for veterans in the community. I shared the various ways my office works to honor and protect our veteran consumers and help them access legal assistance."
