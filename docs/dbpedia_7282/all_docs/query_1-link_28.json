        "text": "The purpose of this handbook is to provide students with comprehensive information about the Senior School, including considering their post-secondary and the variety of subjects Viewbank College offers to students. Students need to carefully plan their courses and make informed decisions about their goals.\n\nThe new Senior Certificate offers choice in future pathways for students. As part of the certificate, students can access the traditional VCE, a Vocational Major certificate and the Vocational Pathways Certificate. Whatever choice is made by students, these years of study are a great challenge for students in Years 10, 11 and 12 to really test their capacity as learners and establish their best opportunity for achieving quality pathways beyond the College. Senior students need to prioritise time and effort into achieving success in their Senior Certificate.\n\nIn terms of considering a study course, the best advice is to choose studies:\n\nwhich the student really enjoys;\n\nin which the student achieves success and already has a sense of learning confidence;\n\nwhich enhance the student’s special skills or talents; and\n\nwhich are prerequisites for future study, apprenticeships or work.\n\nStudent decision-making will be well supported. It is important for parents to discuss options with their student, but there will be counselling advice from a variety of people in the College including Assistant Principals, Heads of House, House Leaders and Pathways Counsellors. Each student will be provided with course counselling to explore all options.\n\nViewbank College has high expectations of all students in the Senior School to achieve their best. We have a teaching staff committed to assisting every student to achieve personal success. Students undertaking VCE studies should understand that the keys to success are:\n\nA desire to give their best effort\n\nA strong commitment to their studies\n\nDetermination and perseverance when things become difficult\n\nA commitment to seeking help and advice from House Leaders or Wellbeing staff when needed\n\nEstablish sound work habits and set priorities for both their College commitments and those beyond the College.\n\nVCE is very much about planning and working towards post-secondary training and beyond and requires considerable study time outside of school hours. Consider any commitment to casual work and balance this with study, social time and leisure.\n\nI wish every student, in Years 10, 11 and 12 undertaking the journey through the Senior years, to find it an enjoyable learning challenge that results in personal success. Students can expect to be tested academically, and along the journey, may feel tested in their resolve. However, they need to know that the College will support them to achieve their best. It is our wish that when they leave us, they leave as successful learners with fond memories of their time spent at Viewbank College.\n\nMs Sharon Grimes"
