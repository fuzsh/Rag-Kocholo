They have dedicated themselves to working towards an outcome of ensemble creation and performance across nine months, never faltering, but keeping their eyes on their performance goal.\n\nInstead, that goal in 2021 taught us that great shows are not made in the last minute, but in every rehearsal stroke of the bow, in every sung note found or lost, in every explosion of the physical as the cast honed their skills week by week.\n\nNothing was lost. Every moment, every learning gained by artists young and older involved in the Spectacular was a moment to be kept forever. Nothing was lost because this work will feed each and every one of us to our future goals.\n\nToday change is the constant, but this too will pass.
