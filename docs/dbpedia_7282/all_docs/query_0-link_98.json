        "text": "UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\n\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\nDivision for the Purpose of\n\nAppointing Independent Counsels\n\nEthics in Government Act of 1978, As Amended\n\nDivision No. 94-2\n\nFINAL REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT COUNSEL\n\nIn Re:\n\nALPHONSO MICHAEL (MIKE) ESPY\n\nDONALD C. SMALTZ\n\nIndependent Counsel\n\nwww.oic.gov\n\nFiled January 30, 2001\n\nPublished October 25, 2001\n\nWashington, DC\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nEvery criminal investigation or prosecution is a team effort and, given its scope and scale, this investigation and its resulting prosecutions against almost two dozen defendants in four venues demanded a particularly talented, dedicated, and hard-working team. While it is impossible to identify everyone whose contributions aided the effort, I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the many dedicated people who worked with me, often for very long hours and with modest compensation, to bring our efforts to successful fruition. Many of these people were required to relocate from their homes for extended periods of time, and so their families, including mine, also deserve acknowledgment of, and appreciation for, their many sacrifices.\n\nAn Independent Counsel office is by statute ad hoc. Its size and duration are determined by the scope of its jurisdictional mandate and the extent of the criminal conduct uncovered. It offers its employees no expectation of a \"career path\" or even a defined term of employment. The investigative agents, attorneys, and staff who volunteer to work for the Office of the Independent Counsel interrupt their career paths and forego future opportunities otherwise available - a significant sacrifice. Moreover, both the OIC and they personally may become the object of political polemics, a tactic frequently employed by opponents of the investigation.\n\nNotwithstanding these drawbacks, this investigation attracted an outstanding array of legal talent from around the country, from both the public and private sectors. I was particularly fortunate in being able to enlist a large number of highly experienced former and current federal prosecutors, both as staff and as advisors. All of my senior trial counsel had substantial trial experience as federal prosecutors. Overall, about two-thirds of the Office's attorneys were current or former prosecutors.\n\nAt the apex of the attorney staff were my successive Deputy Independent Counsels, Charles G. Bakaly, III, Theodore S. Greenberg (team leader for United States v. Sun-Diamond Growers of California, United States v. Tyson Foods, Inc., and United States v. James Lake), and Robert W. Ray (team leader for United States v. Archibald R. Schaffer, III and United States v. Jack L. Williams). My immediate right-hand assistants were the Counsellors to the Independent Counsel, first Theodore S. Greenberg and then William F. Fahey (team leader for United States v. Ronald H. Blackley), followed by Robert W. Ray, and thereafter Jacob S. Frenkel (co-team leader for United States v. Alvarez T. Ferrouillet, Jr./John J. Hemmingson).\n\nMy Chief Appellate Counsel throughout the investigation was Charles M. Kagay, whose service included significant trial court briefing in addition to appellate matters and who also undertook primary responsibility for drafting this final report, a daunting task given the breadth of the investigations.\n\nThe trial attorneys for our numerous cases included Adrienne R. Baron, Barry Coburn (team leader for United States v. Five M Farming Enterprises, Inc., et al.), Michael R. Davis, Jacob S. Frenkel, Wil Frentzen, Joseph P. Guichet, Trent B. Harkrader, Joe M. Hollomon (team leader for United States v. Norris J. Faust, Jr.), Roscoe C. Howard, Jr., Benjamin B. Klubes, Mark J. Krum (team leader for United States v. Henry William Espy, Jr.), Kathleen M. Nicolaides, William S. Noakes, Jr., Robert O'Neill (team leader for United States v. Richard Douglas), Eduardo G. Roy, Joseph F. Savage (team leader for United States v. Crop Growers Corporation), and David Schertler. Other attorneys who worked on the investigative, trial support, and appellate tasks of the Office included Bruce A. Abbott, Walter F. Becker, Jr., James L. Brochin, Mark S. Brodin, George D. Brown, Blanche L. Bruce, Kimberly S. Davis, Roberto Iraola, Stephen R. McAllister, Charles P. Murdter, Nathan J. Muyskens, Allen L. Neelley, Jan Patterson, Henry H. Rossbacher, David Smith, Elizabeth Taylor, George Van Cleve, Thomson von Stein, L.C. Wright, and Tracy W. Young. Paul S. Rosenzweig provided valuable input in the creation and review of this Report. I was also extremely fortunate to be advised on an as-needed basis by a group of very experienced attorneys serving without compensation under the title of Advisory Independent Counsel - Leighton M. Anderson, Joseph F. Barletta, Anthony R. Corso, Don DeGabrielle, Stephen H. Jigger, Steve Mansfield, George B. Newhouse, Jr., Daniel J. O'Brien, Melvyn H. Rappaport, and Michael I. Spiegel.\n\nThe backbone of this office's investigative efforts was a staff of extremely capable investigative agents. The largest group of these agents came from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and worked under the guidance of Mark B. Codd, Supervisory Special Agent, who provided skilled leadership and sage counsel throughout his tenure. The agents included J. T. Burns (who worked on the investigation from beginning to end), Peggy Campane, John R. Cantalupo, Margaret Carmichael, Brian K. Cosgriff, Cynthia A. Falls, Francis X. Gaughen, Mark A. Grisham, Alexis Hatten, E. Leo Martinez, Carolyn Murphy, and Lawrence J. Welk. The United States Department of Agriculture Office of Inspector General also contributed a major contingent of special agents, headed by Supervisory Special Agent Kim Widup, whose indefatigable determination was contagious and whose highly skilled services spanned the entirety of the investigation through the conclusion of all prosecutions. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) agents included Neal H. Hasheider, Derrick N. Hurst, Don Meeks, Stacy Rubey-deGuerrero, and Pam Taylor. Investigators from other agencies, who contributed a multiplicity of talents, included Arthur L. Wicks, Ronald DiStefano, and Stephen C. Dodge of the U.S. Customs Service; Leonard Thill of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); David P. Cyr of the U.S. Postal Service; Ray Gregson and John D. Fort of the U.S. Treasury Department/Internal Revenue Service; and retired F.B.I. agents James T. Burns, Jerry Marsh, Richard O'Connell, Lewis L. Small, and Robert E. Smith.\n\nThe efforts of the attorneys and investigators could not have been as efficient and effective as they were without the continual support of an excellent staff of legal assistants. The corps of paralegals was ably and tirelessly headed by Barbara P. Schultz, and included David L. Dunleavy, Rosemary A. Ficalora, William L. Hurlock, Jacob D. Kortz, John A. Kruger III, James Lagomarsino, James D. Manclark, William S. McNish, Brett L. Shelton, Kerry A. Stehn, Josephine J. Tao, Carly B. Tolchin, Ruth M. Vogelsang, and Denise E. Washington. The law clerks and legal interns serving our effort included David S. Hochman, Michael C. Petronio, Lisa A. Rich, Lisa Stern, and Diane E. Wolf.\n\nThe work of this office also depended vitally on a talented troop of accountants, auditors, and financial analysts supporting our efforts. Neill W. Freeman, Laurence A. Mills, Ellen Faun, Fred Smolen, and James F. Chadbourne III, provided expert forensic accounting services. Alvin A. Brown of the USDA and Michelle Biess also provided accounting support. Leonard Thill of the SEC provided accounting expertise in securities matters. Philip J. Rooney from beginning to end supplied the accounting support and related advice necessary to the administration of the office.\n\nA small number of exceptionally skilled professionals provided essential trial preparation, evidence presentation, and information dissemination services. Providing jury consulting services were Dr. Donald E. Vinson, Steve Paterson, and Norma Silverstein; Lorrie Messinger and Gayle Mumm assisted in the preparation of demonstrative trial exhibits of complex evidentiary materials. Public response advisors included Eric Dezenhall and Andy Shea; and William P. Kucewicz provided editing vital to the completion of this Report.\n\nNo law office can function without its executive support staff, and we were particularly fortunate in attracting dedicated and capable workers to fill these crucial positions. I particularly want to acknowledge the indispensable assistance of my most talented, tireless, and absolutely dedicated confidential assistant Janice M. Drake, who also functioned as my secretary, confidant, press officer, and shepherd for the Final Report. The role of confidential assistant was also briefly and ably filled by Mae Chauvin, who also contributed as a trial assistant. Elizabeth Ray and Peggy Thume exhibited total dedication and commitment as they assisted in a variety of roles throughout the investigations and trials, and in the preparation of the Final Report. The other helpful and highly effective members of the secretarial staff included Eileen B. Aarons, Delores \"Tiesha\" Banks, Christine L. Brown, Judy Buechner, Danielle L. Cannata, Lauren C. Davis, Angie R. Drehsler, Ann Fisher-Durrah, Frank E. Gillen, Ann T. McLean, Gwendolyn Shuler, Ruth Marion Tichenor, and Avis C. Wilson. Ably supporting their efforts was a clerical staff, including Clifton Z. Dameron, Carol Ann Daniel, Eric J. Dominitz, Frances D. Johnson, Ramona R. Kerley, Thomas A. Kertscher, Joshua E. Miller, David Tillotson, and Christopher von Stein.\n\nThe efforts of the above personnel would not have been possible without a well-run home office in Alexandria, Virginia (with occasional satellites when necessary). Fortunately, we were served by experienced administrative personnel who kept this support structure running at high level of efficiency at all times. The head of this effort was the office administrator, a role filled successively and always capably by Carol McCreary-Maddox, Kerry A. Stehn and, since April 1998, Margaret B. Jackson, assisted for a time by Lauren Daniel Thomas. The satellite offices were administered in New Orleans, Louisiana, and Jackson, Mississippi, by Luis Jeffrey Martorell, and in San Francisco by Ruth Vogelsang. The office's computer network was ably managed at different times by Emmanuel S. Vouvakis, William L. Hurlock, James D. Manclark, Josephine J. Tao, and, for the past three years, James A. Reid, Sr., who also bore the responsibility for maintaining the Office's website. Finally, no office of this scale can function without the jack-of-all-trades who can make everything work whenever and wherever as needed. The absolutely indispensable Calvin S. Holt, Jr., whose duties and responsibilities far exceeded his Property Manager title, most ably fulfilled that role in each of our various offices.\n\nFinally, I wish to acknowledge and publicly thank those citizens who served as jurors. The grand juries in San Francisco, New Orleans, and Jackson, Mississippi worked patiently and thoughtfully in consideration of the evidence behind the indictments we obtained in those cities. In particular, the grand jury in the District of Columbia labored tirelessly in anonymity to perform its vital investigatory functions from October 1994 through April 1998. This body, so essential to any meaningful investigation, met on a weekly basis, sometimes as frequently as four days a week, to hear testimony and review documentary evidence. Its patience, insightful countenance, and instructive comments contributed significantly to our efforts. Similarly, the citizens who served as petit jurors for our numerous trials deserve recognition for the time and thoughtful effort they gave as essential participants in our system of justice.\n\nI am immensely grateful to all of these people for their dedication and their hard work. I am both pleased and proud to have worked in association with the people in my office for an extended period of time. To each and every one, I extend sincere thanks and congratulations for a job well done.\n\nDon Smaltz\n\nIndependent Counsel\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nORDER\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nA.

INTRODUCTION\n\nIn 1961, with regard to proposed legislation governing the receipt of gratuities by government officials, President John F. Kennedy stated:\n\nNo responsibility of government is more fundamental than the responsibility of maintaining the highest standards of ethical behavior by those who conduct the public business. There can be no dissent from the principle that all officials must act with unwavering integrity, absolute impartiality and complete devotion to the public interest. This principle must be followed not only in reality but in appearance. For the basis of effective government is public confidence, and that confidence is endangered when ethical standards falter or appear to falter.\n\nIt is axiomatic that the Federal laws and regulations controlling the receipt of gifts by federal employees and officials implement a fundamental principle of public service - that federal officials should not use their public office for their own personal gain or give the appearance that they are not carrying out their official duties with complete impartiality. The public's trust in the fairness and justice of federal decision-making is irretrievably compromised when federal officials take gifts from those whose conduct they regulate and oversee.\n\nIf a public official accepts a gratuity - a gift given for or because of an official act - it calls into question the impartiality of his judgment on matters that affect the giver. A public official's breach of legal and ethical standards - standards that prohibit the receipt of gifts from those whom his decisions may affect - undermines the confidence American citizens must have in the integrity of their political leaders.\n\nGift-giving to a public official by those whose conduct he regulates is pernicious behavior in any context. In matters of public health and safety it is especially troubling. The United States Department of Agriculture is primarily responsible for the quality and safety of the Nation's food supply, particularly meat and poultry. In 1906, Upton Sinclair's famous book The Jungle illuminated the corruption of public meat inspectors and unsanitary conditions in the meat packing industry. In response, Congress established a federal meat inspection system and enacted one of the most stringent anti-gratuity provisions on the books. For nearly a century, every federal meat and poultry inspector has known that the Federal Meat Inspection Act, 21 U.S.C. § 622, signed into law by President Theodore Roosevelt, prohibits the receipt of all gifts, even such seemingly token items as a Christmas turkey. The safety of the American food supply, and the integrity of those who ensure its safety, is that important.\n\nBut if a poultry inspector on his daily rounds is so constrained, how much more important is the integrity of the Secretary of Agriculture whose decisions have nationwide impact? As a high public official, the Secretary of Agriculture is obliged to perform his job in a manner that is free from self-enrichment, free from corruption, and free from even the appearance of self-enrichment and corruption. Public officials are trustees for the American citizenry - they owe America their honesty, their loyalty and their impartial service.\n\nPerhaps the gravest concern arising from the receipt of gratuities by high public officials is the uncertainty it creates in the public mind. Typically, nobody really knows why a public official decides a matter one way or another. In a 1957 review of conflicts of interest, the House Judiciary Committee observed:\n\nMore troublesome than outright bribery, however, because of the obscurity of its motivation and the subtlety of its effect, is the practice of modern lobbies indiscriminately to befriend influential officeholders. In its sophisticated form, this activity never includes a request for a favor, but limits itself to the extension of amenities and courtesies in the form of free transportation, hospitality, and adjuncts to \"gracious living.\" The sole visible object appears to be the establishment of the amiability of the lobbyist and his client. (1)\n\nThis observation rings especially true when a public official is charged with balancing conflicting goals and duties - for example, both ensuring the safety of the American food supply and promoting agricultural business development. When a public official receives gifts from a regulated business and later makes a decision affecting that business, the American public can only speculate, from the outside, whether the gifts received played any role in the decision made. The gratuities laws are designed to eliminate that uncertainty - the Nation should not be left to wonder whether its chief food safety official made decisions based upon principle or upon self-interest.\n\nWhen public allegations that Secretary Espy solicited and received gifts from agricultural interests he regulated first arose, the allegations raised a justifiable concern that Espy's decisions were subject to improper influence. Did Espy's receipt of more than $12,000 in gifts from Tyson Foods, Inc., the world's largest meat and poultry processor, affect his decision on safe poultry handling label regulations that would have cost Tyson more than $30 million? Was the more than $14,000 that Sun-Diamond Growers of California, one of America's largest agricultural cooperatives, spent to Espy's benefit a factor in his decision to support Sun-Diamond's continued use of methyl bromide on its crops, notwithstanding the contrary recommendation of the Environmental Protection Agency? The American public should not have to entertain these questions, but Espy's actions brought them front and center.\n\nThe anti-gratuities statutes also protect those regulated entities that truly desire to conduct their business in an above-board, lawful manner. When a high public official solicits gifts from those he regulates, even when there is no particular decision regarding that business pending before him, he places the donors in an untenable position. Declining to provide the requested gift risks alienating the federal official, but giving the gift flies in the face of the public interest, if not the criminal law. Such was the dilemma faced by the president of Quaker Oats, a company with $180 million of business before the Department of Agriculture, when Espy (whom he had met only once) called him to ask for the gift of two valuable basketball tickets. An executive of Mondavi Winery, who was seeking to enlist Espy's support on a variety of issues, found himself in the same bind when Espy's advisor called him to ask that Espy be given some wine.\n\nThe Office of Independent Counsel (OIC) investigated all these allegations relating to Espy's conduct, and all other matters related to its jurisdiction that arose from the investigation. In the end, it brought numerous indictments for unlawful gratuities, lying and concealment before federal agencies, fraud, and related offenses. These efforts resulted in 15 convictions (of which nine were concluded by pleas) and two successful civil prosecutions, although Espy himself was acquitted of all charges.\n\nThere was, in the end, never any doubt that Espy and his family and friends had taken gifts of substantial value from those whom Espy regulated. Espy's principal defense, and the defense of those who had given gifts to Espy, was that the OIC could not prove that the gifts had been given with the intent to influence any particular, specific decision. Even though the evidence was ample to establish that the gifts were given to Espy for and because of his official position, in the case of Espy the jury was not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that they were given for or because of a specific official act.\n\nAt bottom, the Office's investigation illustrates the destruction of the public trust arising from the actions of a high public official who places private gain before public interest. As this Report details, Espy directly and indirectly received from various agriculture businesses gifts valued at more than $30,000; his chief of staff concealed payments he received under the table from his former agricultural clients; his girlfriend solicited and received a valuable scholarship, employment, and travel and entertainment; his brother received approximately $50,000 in illegal campaign contributions because he could facilitate access to the Secretary; and Espy and many of the donors and recipients concealed these gifts from the American public.\n\nIn short, this investigation showed how our leaders can be compromised in their decision-making obligations and how others used unlawful means to influence public policy. Espy gained substantial personal benefit, receiving a multitude of gifts from persons and entities whose conduct he was supposed to impartially regulate. The donors, in return, gained access to Espy; the influence this gave them over his decisions can never be measured. The integrity of the federal decision-making process, the potential safety of the American food supply, and the American public's trust in the impartiality of government all suffered.\n\nA. Summary of Investigation\n\nThe Office of Independent Counsel's (OIC) investigation into the receipt of gifts and gratuities by former Agriculture Secretary Alphonso Michael Espy revealed a pervasive pattern of improper behavior by Secretary Espy and his top aide, and by persons and companies regulated by or with business before the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The investigation disclosed that, among other offenses, companies with financially important matters pending before USDA gave Secretary Espy - either directly or via members of his family or his girlfriend - numerous gifts in an effort to garner his favor. (A complete list of gifts OIC found Espy to have received from agricultural interests appears at Section II.A.)\n\nOIC's investigation culminated in the return of a 39-count indictment against Espy, charging multiple violations arising out of his acceptance of things of value from persons and entities regulated by USDA, his concealment of these gifts from the public, and other abuses of his office. The indictment charged that he had received more than $30,000 in gifts and benefits from agricultural interests. At trial, Espy did not dispute receipt of the gifts, but he argued that these gifts did not affect the decisions he made and that he did not have the criminal intent required for a conviction. After a two-month trial, the jury found former Secretary Espy not guilty on all counts.\n\nAll told, OIC charged thirteen individuals (including Espy) and six business entities (2) with criminal violations regarding the provision of gifts and gratuities to the former Secretary of Agriculture, the concealment of gratuities from federal investigators, and/or related offenses. Of these, 14 were convicted of or pleaded guilty to one or more offenses (3), and four were acquitted of all charges (4); one person was placed into a pre-trial diversion program (5). OIC also instituted civil prosecutions against two corporations (6) and referred several matters to other federal enforcement agencies. (7)\n\nIn addition to the gratuities given directly to Espy and his girlfriend, the investigation focused on election campaign contributions given to the account of Espy's brother, Henry Espy. The donors were persons and companies regulated by the Department of Agriculture who saw Henry Espy's campaign debt, and Secretary Espy's personal concern over that debt, as an avenue to gain the Secretary's favor. Beyond the impropriety of seeking to gain an advantage before a governmental agency in this manner, many of these contributions and related activities were substantively illegal under the election laws and other federal statutes. The illegal contributions exceeded $50,000. Consequently, this area of the investigation resulted in several prosecutions and convictions.\n\nThe investigation further disclosed that Secretary Espy's chief of staff, Ronald Blackley, accepted money from persons with business before USDA and concealed this fact from the public, and that Mississippi farmers with ties to Secretary Espy defrauded USDA of federal subsidies. This part of the investigation resulted in criminal convictions of Blackley and several persons and one corporation he had represented.\n\nOIC's investigation led to a number of significant prosecutions. The investigation of Crop Growers Corporation, then the second-largest private seller of federal multi-peril crop insurance, led to the first indictment and conviction in an Independent Counsel proceeding of a publicly-held company and resulted in the largest fine, $2 million, secured by any Independent Counsel up to the time. OIC's prosecution of John J. Hemmingson, Crop Growers' chief executive officer, and Alvarez T. Ferrouillet, a Louisiana lawyer who chaired an effort to retire the congressional-campaign debt of Secretary Espy's brother Henry, was the first to charge and convict individuals for money laundering in connection with illegal federal-election campaign contributions. OIC's investigation later led to the first conviction in approximately 100 years for giving a gratuity to a sitting Cabinet member, with the guilty plea of Tyson Foods, Inc., the nation's leading poultry producer. The plea resulted in a $4 million criminal fine and a $2 million payment toward OIC's investigative costs. The prosecution of Sun-Diamond Growers of California, a large, multi-crop agricultural cooperative, resulted in a Supreme Court decision clarifying the scope of the federal gratuities statute. The civil actions OIC brought against Smith Barney, Inc. and Robert Mondavi Corporation, Inc. were apparently the first instances in which an Independent Counsel resolved charges through civil litigation.\n\nIn total, OIC collected more than $10 million in criminal fines, civil recoveries, and restitutionary orders for the United States Treasury. OIC also referred three matters to the Department of Justice for prosecution and one matter to the Federal Election Commission for civil disposition, resulting in the recovery of an additional $560,000 for the United States.\n\nB. Background Information\n\nThe focus of the investigation was Secretary Espy, and the setting in which he was scrutinized was the Department of Agriculture. The following briefly sets forth pertinent background information regarding both.\n\n1. The United States Department of Agriculture\n\nThe United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), founded in 1862, became a Cabinet-level department in 1889. The duties of USDA include the regulation and inspection of the United States food supply, the improvement and promotion of agricultural development and production in the United States, and the promotion of United States agricultural products in foreign countries. In 1993, USDA consisted of more than 43 different agencies and subagencies, (8) and had an annual operating budget in excess of $65 billion, representing 4.3 percent of the total federal budget. Its payroll of more than 112,000 staff employees was exceeded only by four other federal agencies (the Departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, Treasury, and the Veterans Administration). USDA has offices or committees in nearly every county in the United States and personnel stationed around the world.\n\nThe USDA departments of particular relevance to the Independent Counsel's investigation were the following:\n\nThe Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS): FSIS, the public-health agency within USDA, is responsible for ensuring that the nation's commercial supply of meat, poultry, and egg products is safe and correctly labeled and packaged. It inspects all raw beef, pork, lamb, chicken, and turkey sold in interstate and foreign commerce, and it regulates production and distribution to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. It also provides laboratory-analysis services to inspect samples of meat and poultry products for disease, contamination, or other forms of adulteration.\n\nThe Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS): AMS directs and monitors a range of activities in the areas of commodity promotion, market news, agricultural transportation, and product inspection and grading; it also procures food for domestic food-distribution programs. AMS further acts to divert commodities or food products from normal channels of commercial trade to relieve market surpluses, primarily through government purchases, whenever the Secretary of Agriculture determines such a diversion is necessary.\n\nThe Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC): FCIC, in cooperation with various private insurance agencies, provides farmers and ranchers federally subsidized crop insurance to protect against crop loss resulting from floods, drought and other natural disasters.\n\nThe Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS): ASCS administers farm price support programs and conservation cost-sharing programs.\n\nThe Secretary of Agriculture, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, administers USDA. The Secretary is ninth in line of succession to the Presidency.\n\n2. Alphonso Michael Espy\n\nIn late 1992, President-elect Clinton chose Alphonso Michael Espy, a Mississippi Congressman, to serve as the Secretary of Agriculture in his administration.\n\na. Biographical Information\n\nEspy was born November 30, 1953 in Yazoo City, Mississippi, a town located in the Mississippi Delta. His grandfather had founded a chain of more than two dozen funeral homes; his father had worked as a USDA county extension agent in Arkansas during the 1930s and 1940s and had later joined the family funeral-home business in Mississippi. Espy graduated from Yazoo City High School and earned a B.A. degree in political science from Howard University in Washington, D.C. in 1975. In 1978, he received a law degree from University of Santa Clara Law School, near San Jose, California.\n\nUpon graduating from law school, Espy returned to Mississippi, where he obtained an appointment as the managing attorney at Central Mississippi Legal Services. In 1980, Espy became an Assistant Secretary of State and Director of the Mississippi Public Lands Division, a position he held for the next four years. From 1984 to 1985, Espy served in the Mississippi Attorney General's office as an Assistant Attorney General in the Consumer Protection Division.\n\nIn 1983, Espy first entered the political arena as coordinator in Mississippi's Second Congressional District for a candidate for Attorney General. The following year, Espy served on the Democratic National Committee's Rules Committee. In 1986, Espy ran for Congress in Mississippi's Second Congressional District.\n\nThe Second Congressional District of Mississippi, geographically one of the larger districts in the United States, is primarily rural, and agriculture is its main industry. The district borders the Mississippi River and is approximately 275 miles long and up to 180 miles wide. It has an estimated population of just under 500,000.\n\nRunning on a campaign of reform, Espy defeated two-term incumbent Republican Congressman Webb Franklin by a margin of 52 percent to 48 percent and became Mississippi's first black congressman since Reconstruction. Espy was reelected three times, soundly defeating his opponents in the 1988, 1990 and 1992 elections. In the House of Representatives, Espy served as a member of the House Agriculture Committee, the House Select Committee on Hunger, and the Budget Committee. He also served with then-Governor William Jefferson Clinton of Arkansas on the Lower Mississippi Economic Delta Commission and on the Democratic Leadership Council.\n\nEspy was an early supporter of Arkansas Governor Clinton in his successful 1992 presidential bid. Following the November elections, Espy actively sought the Cabinet position of Secretary of Agriculture, and he eventually obtained the approval of President-elect Clinton. After his confirmation by the Senate, Espy resigned from Congress and was sworn in as Agriculture Secretary on January 22, 1993.\n\nA divorced father of two, Espy dated Patricia S. Dempsey, an administrative assistant for an accounting firm in Georgetown and subsequently for the D.C. Aids Education and Training Center in Washington, D.C., throughout his term as Secretary of Agriculture. Dempsey met Congressman Espy through a mutual friend, and the two began dating in February 1992. Dempsey and Espy lived together for most of the period from October 1992 through June of 1993 and shared some expenses, as well as an American Express Card account. Dempsey and Espy continued to date until November of 1995, at which time their relationship apparently ended. Dempsey became a focal point for several matters investigated by OIC, as she was the recipient of gifts and a scholarship from entities regulated by USDA. For a time she worked for a consulting firm lobbying Espy on a variety of issues, and in that position she intervened with Espy's staff on several occasions.\n\nAnalysis of Espy's financial documents revealed that his annual expenses increased more than his income after he left Congress to become Secretary of Agriculture. Although his total income rose from $96,068 in 1992 to $100,172 in 1993, certain of his expenses, particularly credit card and consumer-loan payments, increased by nearly $30,000 in 1993. In addition, Espy's total debt rose from nearly $300,000 at the end of 1992 to almost $400,000 at the end of 1993 as the result of increased mortgage loans, unsecured loans, and credit card debts. Thus, the things of value he received from agricultural interests could well have been beyond his means had he been personally obligated to pay for them with his own resources.\n\nb. Secretary Espy's Knowledge of Ethical Constraints\n\nAs a Congressman, Espy had been subject to federal rules and laws prohibiting the receipt of gifts in certain circumstances. Although these rules became more restrictive during his tenure in Congress, they were always more lenient than those imposed on the Executive Branch. When Espy entered Congress, the applicable ethics rules allowed members to receive gifts valued up to $100 per year from each person having a direct interest in legislation before Congress. The rules allowed outside sources to pay for travel, food, and lodging for a member, spouse, his dependants if the congressman \"substantially participated\" in an event. Members also were permitted to receive honoraria up to $2,000 per event for speaking engagements. However, many of the congressional rules changed effective January 1, 1991, when bans on honoraria, the solicitation of things of value from \"prohibited sources,\" and the acceptance of things of value from prohibited sources, with certain specified exceptions, took effect.\n\nAlmost immediately upon his selection as Secretary of Agriculture, Espy received a variety of memoranda designed to make him aware of the ethical regulations that applied to his new position in the executive branch. Specifically, he received materials regarding the prohibitions against gifts to public officials and the requirements regarding financial disclosure.\n\nFor example, on December 29, 1992, within one week of his nomination to the post of Secretary of Agriculture, Espy received a memorandum from Vice President-elect Albert Gore's chief of staff summarizing the federal ethics rules. The memorandum informed incoming administration officials that the ethics rules required financial disclosure through annual financial disclosure reports (government form SF-278) and that the rules forbade acceptance of gifts from prohibited sources, with a few exceptions (such as gifts under $20). On the same date, Espy also received a memorandum from the transition counsel specifically regarding inaugural events and gifts. The memorandum warned:\n\nAs the Inaugural approaches, it is important that presidential designees be aware of the federal rules governing the receipt of gifts by executive branch employees - including attendance at receptions, parties and other events.\n\nAdditionally, on January 22, 1993, the day Espy was sworn in as Secretary of Agriculture, a personnel assistant at USDA gave him a copy of the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch and told him that \"it was a book he should read.\" The document stated the ethical regulations regarding the receipt of gifts by executive-branch officials. These rules generally forbade the acceptance of things of value from prohibited sources, except for gifts of less than $20 value, gifts given solely out of friendship, and other minor exceptions. The rules defined a \"prohibited source\" as any person or organization that seeks official action by, does business with, or is regulated by a federal employee's agency, or that has interests that may be substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of the employee's official duties.\n\nEspy does not appear to have considered the executive branch's ethical restraints significant. On an April 2, 1993 plane flight, for example, Espy discussed the executive branch's ethical restraints with Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner. Secretary Espy stated (in Administrator Browner's words) that he thought the tougher ethical standards put in place by the Clinton administration were \"a bunch of junk\" and that, in ethics matters, he was going to conduct himself as he had in Congress.\n\nC. Initial Allegations and Investigations\n\nAllegations of Espy's official improprieties first appeared in a March 17, 1994 Wall Street Journal article entitled \"Tyson Foods, With a Friend in the White House, Gets Gentle Treatment From Agricultural Agency.\" (9) Tyson Foods, Inc., the nation's largest poultry producer and also a pork and beef processor, is based in Arkansas, the home state of President Clinton. Exploring the apparent close ties between Tyson Foods and President Clinton, the article reported that the company was a major Clinton supporter, having flown him on its aircraft and contributed to his gubernatorial campaigns. Further, according to the article, President Clinton had received $22,000 for his presidential campaign from Tyson Foods executives and board members. The article also alleged that Tyson Foods had received very favorable treatment from Clinton during his tenure as Governor of Arkansas.\n\nWith regard to USDA, the article first noted that Don Tyson, chairman of Tyson Foods, had recently entertained Patricia Jensen, an Assistant Secretary of USDA, in his skybox at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville during a college basketball game. The article quoted Jensen, who was under consideration to become the USDA official in charge of meat and poultry inspection, as saying that she felt she was being \"looked over\" by Tyson.\n\nThe article then disclosed that Espy \"acknowledged meeting with Tyson Foods lobbyists 'all the time,'\" that Tyson Foods earlier in 1994 had feted Espy at a Dallas Cowboys football game, and that company executives had contributed $4,000 to Espy's brother's unsuccessful campaign for Congress. At the same time, the article alleged, Tyson Foods was enjoying very favorable treatment from USDA in several aspects of USDA's regulation of poultry and meat: \"Few corporations in America have stronger personal ties to Bill Clinton than Arkansas-based Tyson Foods, Inc., and few have fared better in their dealings with his Agriculture Department.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal article specifically mentioned that a USDA \"blitz\" of surprise sanitation inspections of meat-packing facilities over the previous year had bypassed chicken processors, including Tyson Foods' 66 plants. It also reported that USDA had favored Tyson Foods' position in a dispute over a California regulation regarding whether to permit poultry frozen at or above zero degrees Fahrenheit to be labeled \"fresh.\" The article added that Espy had ordered USDA employees working on a \"zero tolerance\" fecal-matter policy for chicken processing (similar to one he had partially imposed for red meat), to drop the initiative and turn over their work, including information on computers, to an Espy aide.\n\n1. Investigation by the Office of Inspector General, USDA\n\nThe Wall Street Journal article caught the attention of USDA's Office of Inspector General (OIG). OIG is a separate agency within USDA charged with preventing and detecting fraud and abuse in USDA programs and operations and providing security protection for the Secretary and Deputy Secretary. OIG investigates alleged or suspected violations of federal criminal law relating to the employees, programs and operations of USDA and may refer matters to the Department of Justice (DOJ). OIG is headed by the Inspector General, who reports directly to the Secretary of Agriculture.\n\nThe article prompted OIG to interview Assistant Secretary Jensen on March 21, 1994. Jensen was responsible for USDA's Marketing and Inspection Services, which included the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS). She was prohibited by federal law (21 U.S.C. § 622) from receiving gifts from a firm regulated under the Federal Meat Inspection Act, such as Tyson Foods.\n\nJensen informed OIG agents that she met Jack Williams, a consultant for Tyson Foods and the Mid-American Dairymen Association (MADA), in late 1993. At Williams's invitation, she traveled on January 31, 1994 to Kansas City, Missouri to address MADA and, the next day, to Fayetteville to visit Tyson Foods. Jensen said that, while in Fayetteville, she attended a basketball game between the University of Arkansas and Vanderbilt University, using a ticket that Archibald Schaffer, Tyson Foods' director of Media, Public and Governmental Affairs provided to her through Williams. At the game, she met Don Tyson and, after a brief conversation, sat at the front of Tyson Foods' skybox to watch the game. Jensen said she insisted on paying for the ticket, and ultimately mailed a personal check to Williams for $13, the value of the ticket according to Williams.\n\nJensen said that, on the morning after the game, she gave a speech to representatives of the Arkansas Poultry Federation and toured Tyson Foods' facilities. She then flew to Nashville, Tennessee, where she met up with Williams, who obtained their boarding passes for the flight to Washington, D.C. She received an upgrade to first class on the flight and sat next to Williams. She assumed Williams arranged her upgrade through a frequent-flyer program but was unclear about the details.\n\nOn March 22, 1994, the day after their interview with Jensen, OIG agents interviewed Williams. Williams said he represented issues before governmental agencies and Congress as a lobbyist for various industrial clients, including Tyson Foods. He then confirmed that he gave Jensen a ticket to the basketball game in Fayetteville and provided her upgrade to first class on the flight from Nashville to Washington, D.C., using his frequent-flyer upgrade stickers. Williams said that Jensen sent a check to him as reimbursement for the basketball game and that he endorsed the check to Tyson Foods. Williams stated that he offered to upgrade Jensen as a token of his goodwill, not as a bribe, and that in his view the \"stickers\" had no real value to him. He said he did not submit an invoice to Tyson Foods for the cost of the upgrade.\n\nOIG Agents asked Williams if he knew anything about Espy attending a Dallas Cowboys football game with Don Tyson (an incident that had been reported in the Wall Street Journal article). Williams replied that he did not know whether Espy had gone to Dallas and attended a football game, except for what he had heard through rumor and news reports. (10)\n\nOn March 22, 1994, on the basis of the information provided by Jensen and Williams, OIG formally opened an investigation regarding \"Gratuities to USDA officials by Tyson Foods, Inc., Springdale, AR.\" As to the allegations regarding Tyson Foods providing football tickets to Espy, OIG concluded that any substantial investigation of Espy should be handled by DOJ and therefore did not open a formal investigation into this matter. OIG agents decided, however, to meet with Espy to question him generally about the items raised in the Wall Street Journal article, to determine if there was a basis to refer the matter to DOJ.\n\nOn March 22, 1994, OIG informed USDA Counsel and Deputy Secretary Richard Rominger of its need to meet with Espy to discuss the Wall Street Journal allegations at a mutually convenient time. Two days later, OIG informed DOJ's Public Integrity Section of the status of its investigation of Jensen and of its intention to interview Espy. DOJ suggested some questions to ask Espy.\n\nOn April 1, 1994, OIG agents interviewed Espy in his office. The agents first informed Espy of the status of the Jensen investigation and then asked him about the Dallas football game that the Wall Street Journal article had reported. Espy said that a week of official travel concluded on Friday, January 14, 1994, in Lubbock, Texas. The USDA personnel traveling with him returned to Washington, but Espy remained in Texas for the weekend. Espy stated that he paid for his own hotel and meals and that on Sunday, January 16, 1994, he attended the Dallas Cowboys-Green Bay Packers playoff game at Texas Stadium. Espy acknowledged that Tyson Foods provided him with a skybox ticket and that he watched the game from its skybox, but he said nothing about his girlfriend meeting him in Dallas and accompanying him to the game as a guest of Tyson Foods. (11)\n\nEspy further stated that after his office received an inquiry from a reporter for The Wall Street Journal regarding the game, he asked one of his assistants to determine the value of his ticket. The day after The Wall Street Journal printed the article reporting his attendance at the game, Espy reimbursed Tyson Foods $68 for the cost of his ticket.\n\nAfter the discussion of the Dallas trip, the agents asked Espy if he had received any other tickets or things of value from outside sources. Espy stated he was limiting his response to his acceptance of things from Tyson Foods. He said that in late spring 1993, after speaking at two graduation ceremonies in Mississippi, he traveled to Arkansas, where he spoke to the Arkansas Poultry Federation, and then traveled to a Tyson Foods management training center in Russellville, Arkansas, where he had dinner and stayed the night. Espy explained that he received a call the next day from the White House requesting his presence at a dinner being held for the Cabinet, and that because there were no available airline facilities Tyson Foods flew him back to Washington National Airport in its corporate jet. Espy stated that he had USDA reimburse Tyson Foods for the lodging and the equivalent of a first-class fare for the jet. Espy did not identify anyone else as accompanying him to Russellville.\n\nDuring the April 1, 1994 interview, Espy consulted certain documents which he did not show the OIG agents and which the agents presumed were official USDA trip itineraries. Espy was asked to provide copies of all itineraries in support of the two trips discussed, and Espy agreed. The agents informed Espy that they would prepare a memorandum following the interview and forward it to DOJ and that the information he provided would be enclosed with the memorandum. A week later, OIG agents received the itineraries from Espy's office. As the agents had not seen the original itineraries, they were unaware that Espy had directed his staff to redact the copies provided to exclude all references to Tyson Foods and Espy's girlfriend. (12)\n\nOn April 19, 1994, OIG's Assistant Inspector General for investigations formally referred to DOJ both the Jensen investigation and the Espy inquiry. The referral relayed the relevant facts and the information provided by Espy and stated in pertinent part:\n\nWe are asking that you determine whether the Federal Meat Inspection Act is applicable to the actions of these two officials. We also understand that even if you find that the act is not applicable, the conduct may fall under the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch (5 C.F.R. 2635). Thus, we believe that these public integrity questions involving two of the highest officials of this Department can only be resolved with your prompt guidance and advice.\n\n2. Investigation by the Department of Justice\n\nOn April 25, 1994, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), under the direction of DOJ's Public Integrity Section, initiated an investigation into the matters OIG had referred. The investigation differed from a typical Department of Justice investigation. It was narrowly focused, compulsory process was not used to obtain documents and testimony, and agents were specifically instructed to limit their inquiries. The Public Integrity lawyers instructed the agents to be concerned only about the \"receipt of tickets.\" There was no apparent reason for so limiting the investigation and for not invoking normal investigative techniques and procedures. The Independent Counsel Statute, which limits the scope of preliminary DOJ inquiries, in particular prohibiting the use of compulsory process, was not then in effect, but DOJ nevertheless adhered to the statute's restrictions. (13)\n\nThe FBI interviewed approximately 50 persons, including Espy, Williams, Espy's girlfriend, Patricia Dempsey, and numerous witnesses from USDA, Tyson Foods, and other agricultural interests. Information gathered during these interviews confirmed that Tyson Foods had provided Espy and Dempsey with tickets and limousine service to attend the 1994 Dallas Cowboys-Green Bay Packers playoff game. Witnesses further confirmed that Espy, with Dempsey, had attended a party at the Tyson Foods management training center in Russellville, Arkansas and had flown back to Washington, D.C. on a Tyson Foods aircraft in late Spring 1993.\n\nThe DOJ investigation also uncovered new information. Credible evidence suggested that Espy had accepted other, previously undisclosed gifts. These included tickets to the 1993 National Football League Super Bowl championship game in Atlanta, Georgia; tickets to a 1993 National Basketball Association finals game in Chicago, Illinois; tickets to the 1994 Academy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles, California; and a $500 contribution to a 1993 birthday party for Espy.\n\nFBI agents also heard assertions by senior USDA officials at FSIS, the agency responsible for food safety and inspection, that they had been ordered in March 1993 to stop working on the \"zero tolerance\" inspection system for poultry they had been developing and to destroy all work produced to date on the matter. The two members of Espy's immediate staff who purportedly delivered the halt order, Counselor to the Secretary Kimberly Schnoor and Chief of Staff Ronald Blackley, told agents that they did not issue such an order.\n\nThe FBI and DOJ disagreed sharply on the handling of the additional matters disclosed in the course of the investigation. Some FBI agents complained about restraints placed upon them by DOJ Public Integrity attorneys; they wanted authority to conduct a broader investigation into whether Espy received gifts from entities other than Tyson Foods and to pursue the \"zero tolerance\" issue. Internal DOJ memoranda state that, at a June 7, 1994 meeting between DOJ and FBI, Public Integrity lawyers wanted to complete the investigation as to \"all known gifts\" and decline further inquiry. FBI agents wanted to keep the case open while they continued to investigate what they believed to be evidence of additional gifts from other sources.\n\nThe outcome was that DOJ authorized the FBI to conduct limited inquiries for three more days. These limitations on breadth and time limited the FBI's ability to examine and evaluate the facts fully and increased the likelihood that false statements Espy and others made to investigators would paint a distorted view of the facts. (14)\n\nThe Public Integrity Section subsequently closed the investigation, despite the FBI's confirmation that Secretary Espy had received several things of value, and despite open questions surrounding other gifts and the order to FSIS to halt work on its \"zero tolerance\" plan. In a memorandum to the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, dated June 24, 1994, the DOJ Public Integrity Chief declined prosecution of Espy for his receipt of gifts from Tyson Foods, stating in part:\n\nI hereby decline prosecution and close the investigation of Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy for violating the bribe/gift provision of the Meat Inspection Act, 21 U.S.C. § 622. . . . Secretary Espy did violate the statute. However, in light of the de minimis nature of the violation; the disproportionality of the mandatory minimum sentence required by the statute as applied to this activity; and my firm belief that no amount of further investigation will make this case more likely than not to result in a conviction, I have decided to decline. . . .\n\nPublic Integrity's decision to close the investigation was reversed by the then Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, on June 30, 1994. In a memorandum to the file, she expressed concern that DOJ would decline at a time when the reauthorization of the Independent Counsel Act had been passed by Congress and was awaiting the President's review. However, neither Public Integrity nor any other arm of DOJ conducted any further investigation. Instead, the Attorney General chose to seek the appointment of an Independent Counsel when the Independent Counsel Statute was reenacted effective June 30, 1994. (15)\n\n3. The Attorney General's Application for Appointment of an Independent Counsel\n\nThe Independent Counsel Statute, 28 U.S.C. § 591 et seq., provided special procedures for the investigation of certain top executive officials (including Cabinet members such as the Secretary of Agriculture), presidential campaign committee officers, and, in certain circumstances, members of Congress. It specified the circumstances under which the Attorney General would conduct preliminary investigations of these persons and, when appropriate, seek the appointment of an Independent Counsel to investigate their actions.\n\nThe Statute's first enactment in 1978, and its subsequent reenactments, contained a \"sunset\" provision that provided for its expiration after five years. After the statute expired in December 1992, Congress did not reenact it until June 1994. The Clinton administration supported renewal of the statute; Congress held hearings in 1993 but was unable to reach agreement. In May 1994, the Senate passed an Independent Counsel Statute that paralleled previous Independent Counsel Statutes, with certain modifications (e.g., extending the statute to cover Congress and imposing various fiscal controls on an Independent Counsel). The House passed the bill on June 21, 1994. President Clinton signed the legislation into law on June 30, 1994 and stated:\n\nRegrettably, the statute was permitted to lapse when its reauthorization became mired in a partisan dispute in the Congress. In fact, the IC [independent counsel] statute has been in the past and is today a force for governmental integrity and public confidence.\n\nOn August 8, 1994, Attorney General Janet Reno filed an application for the appointment of an Independent Counsel to investigate Secretary Espy with the division of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for the purpose of appointing Independent Counsels (Special Division). (16) The application requested appointment of an Independent Counsel with authority to investigate whether \"any violations of federal criminal laws were committed by Secretary of Agriculture Alphonso Michael (Mike) Espy, and to determine whether prosecution is warranted.\" After noting that the source of the allegations against Espy was the press report of March 17, 1994, the application stated:\n\nInvestigation developed evidence that Secretary Espy accepted gifts from Tyson Foods in the course of two separate trips, one to Arkansas in May 1993 and one to Texas in January 1994. The gifts fall into the categories of entertainment, transportation, lodging and meals. In total, the gifts amount to at least several hundred dollars in value.\n\nIn addition to the alleged gifts from Tyson Foods, the Department's investigation also included preliminary reviews of other instances in which Secretary Espy allegedly received gifts from organizations and individuals with business pending before the Department of Agriculture.\n\nIn the application, the Attorney General specifically identified two applicable criminal statutes: the Meat Inspection Act, 21 U.S.C. § 622, (17) and the gratuities statute, 18 U.S.C. § 201(c). (18) With regard to the former, she wrote:\n\nSection 622 is a strict anti-gratuity statute which prohibits any Department of Agriculture employee or officer with responsibilities under the Meat Inspection Act from accepting any gift from any person engaged in commerce, without regard to the intent of the donor or the donee. . . . [T]he acceptance of non-trivial gifts of entertainment, transportation, lodging and meals by a Department of Agriculture official who has responsibilities under the Meat Inspection Act, from an entity that is subject to regulation by the Department of Agriculture, falls within the purview of the statute.\n\nAs to the gratuities statute, 18 U.S.C. § 201(c), she wrote that it:\n\nrequires proof that a gift was given for or because of official acts. No evidence has been developed during the investigation suggesting that Secretary Espy accepted the gifts as a reward for, or in expectation of, his performance of official acts.\n\nThe Attorney General recommended that the Division grant the Independent Counsel broad jurisdiction that extended not only to Espy's acts but also to violations of any federal law by any organization or individual developed during the Independent Counsel's investigation and connected with or arising out of that investigation. (19)\n\n4. White House Inquiry\n\nOn August 10, 1994, two days after the Attorney General made her application to the Special Division, the White House publicly announced that it would ask the Office of Government Ethics to conduct an inquiry into the allegations of Espy's misconduct. Instead of requesting an Office of Government Ethics investigation, White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta asked White House Counsel Lloyd Cutler to conduct an inquiry.\n\nPanetta later testified that the purpose of the White House Counsel's inquiry was not to establish whether Espy had committed criminal or ethical violations but to provide information to the White House about whether Espy had engaged in conduct that might create an appearance of impropriety and violate the standards for the Cabinet established by the White House. Panetta stated that he gave periodic reports of the White House Counsel's inquiry directly to President Clinton.\n\nThe White House Counsel conducted little, if any, independent investigation of the facts. He relied primarily on press reports to define the scope of inquiry and on Espy's lawyers to establish the facts. Espy's counsel asserted to White House Counsel that the allegations of wrongdoing were baseless, principally on the theory that Espy had reimbursed many of the gifts after public disclosure and had not performed any favors for the gift-givers.\n\nThe White House soon became aware of allegations concerning Espy's personal use of a USDA-leased Jeep in Mississippi and his girlfriend's receipt of a scholarship from Tyson Foods. As the White House had not previously been aware of these two matters, Panetta informed Espy he wanted to discuss them.\n\nOn Friday, September 30, 1994, Panetta asked Espy to meet him in the Chief of Staff's office at the White House. Those present included Panetta, Espy, Espy's personal counsel, and the new White House Counsel Abner Mikva. Panetta confronted Espy with the allegations regarding Dempsey's scholarship from Tyson Foods. Espy told Panetta that he was aware Dempsey had received the scholarship, that she had mentioned it to him at the time, and that, although he had expressed some concern about it, no steps had been taken either to decline the scholarship or to pay it back to Tyson Foods. Espy further told Panetta that Dempsey did not compete in any way for the scholarship and that he understood a Washington, D.C. lobbyist for Tyson Foods had arranged it.\n\nPanetta asked Espy about the Jeep that Espy had leased while in Congress and for which USDA had since assumed the lease payments. Panetta was concerned that there was no apparent connection between the use of the vehicle in Mississippi and USDA business. Espy answered that, although it was located in his old congressional district, he was using the vehicle for purposes related to his duties as Secretary of Agriculture. Espy also stated that he had approval of USDA counsel for that use. Espy did not disclose to Panetta that he had represented to USDA counsel that the Jeep was to be used only in the Washington, D.C. area, and that counsel had approved its use in Washington, D.C. solely in lieu of a chauffeured limousine.\n\nPanetta asked Espy whether there were any other matters about which the White House should be concerned. Espy responded that there were not.\n\nPanetta considered Espy's responses with respect to the scholarship and the Jeep inadequate and told Espy that he would expect Espy to resign on the following Monday morning. Panetta and White House Counsel Mikva then went immediately to President Clinton, informed him of what they had learned in the meeting, and told him they recommended that Espy resign. The President concurred in the recommendation. On October 3, 1994, Espy submitted his resignation to the President, effective December 31, 1994.\n\nOn October 11, 1994, Mikva submitted a report on the Espy inquiry to the President. The report indicated that the President had asked Mikva to examine two questions in light of the Standards of Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch, 5 C.F.R. Part 2635: \"(1) whether the President should direct that any further action be taken with respect to Secretary Espy's conduct; and (2) what actions should be taken to ensure that similar incidents are avoided by other Members of the Cabinet.\" The report reviewed the applicable ethical regulations and recounted White House Counsel's understanding of the background facts related to Espy's conduct. Although the report purported to be a \"review of these matters under the Standards of Conduct,\" it did not reach any conclusions regarding whether Espy had violated any of those standards. It stated that in light of Espy's resignation (effective December 31, 1994), his recusal from meat and poultry issues for the two months remaining in his tenure, his reimbursement for the things of value he had received, and the institution of further methods to review his travel, the White House Counsel felt that no further actions should be taken at that time.\n\n5. Allegations of Additional Improprieties\n\nAt about the same time that the Special Division was considering the Attorney General's request for the appointment of an Independent Counsel and that White House Counsel was investigating Espy, the press began to report a series of new allegations against the Secretary, many of which would ultimately be examined by the Independent Counsel. The following table summarizes the major publicly-reported events that OIC investigated:\n\nDate Publication Allegation August 7, 1994 Chicago Star Tribune Espy solicited a ticket for a Chicago Bulls playoff game from the President of Quaker Oats. (See discussion at Section II.A.4.) August 7, 1994 Des Moines Register Sun-Diamond executive threw a lavish party for Espy. (See discussion at Section II.C.2.b.)

Appointment of the Independent Counsel\n\nOn September 9, 1994, thirty days after the Attorney General filed her application for appointment of an Independent Counsel, the Special Division appointed Donald C. Smaltz to the position. Smaltz was a 57-year-old California trial lawyer who had begun his career as a federal prosecutor, first in the United States Army, where he served as Captain in the Judge Advocate General's Corps, and later as an Assistant United States Attorney and Special United States Attorney in Los Angeles, California. He had been in private practice for 30 years, specializing in white-collar criminal defense and complex civil litigation. (20)\n\nOne week after the Independent Counsel was appointed, Espy issued a press release explaining that he had been an extremely busy Secretary with an \"impressive record of accomplishments.\" He said he was releasing his travel schedules, news stories, speeches and a variety of other materials to provide a detailed account of his \"official activities\" while Secretary of Agriculture. Acknowledging that he may have been \"inattentive\" to the appearance of impropriety, he flatly asserted that he had \"not violated any laws or ethics regulations\" and had \"cooperated fully with the USDA's Inspector General, [and] with the FBI.\" (21)\n\nPart of the Special Division's function is to specify an Independent Counsel's jurisdiction, and the jurisdictional grant in this instance tracked the Attorney General's request. It gave to the Independent Counsel the full power, independent authority, and jurisdiction to the maximum extent authorized by the Independent Counsel Reauthorization Act of 1994 (22)\n\n[to investigate] whether Alphonso Michael (Mike) Espy, Secretary of Agriculture, committed a violation of any federal criminal law, other than a Class B or C misdemeanor or infraction, relating in any way to the acceptance of gifts by him from organizations or individuals with business pending before the Department of Agriculture;\n\n[to investigate] allegations or evidence of violation of any federal criminal law, other than a Class B or C misdemeanor or infraction, by any organization or individual developed during the Independent Counsel's investigation referred to above and connected with or arising out of that investigation;\n\nto seek indictments and to prosecute any organizations or individuals involved in any of the matters described above;\n\nto fully investigate and prosecute the subject matter with respect to which the Attorney General requested the appointment of independent counsel . . . and all matters and individuals whose acts may be related to that subject matter, inclusive of authority to investigate and prosecute federal crimes . . . that may arise out of the above described matter, including perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses.\n\nThe Attorney General's application for the appointment of an Independent Counsel referred specifically to Espy's receipt of gifts in possible violation of 18 U.S.C. § 201(c), the general gratuities statute, and of 21 U.S.C. § 622, the gratuities provision of the Meat Inspection Act. It also recommended that the Independent Counsel's jurisdiction extend not only to Espy's acts, but also to organizations and persons involved in those acts and, further, to violations of federal criminal law connected with or arising out of the investigation.\n\nThe Special Division's definition of the Independent Counsel's jurisdiction did not limit the range of possible offenses into which the Independent Counsel could inquire. The Special Division adopted the grant that the Attorney General proposed, and the Independent Counsel's jurisdiction extended to Espy's receipt of gifts, to the giving of the gifts, and to other criminal violations arising out of and in connection with the investigation. This broad authority gave the Independent Counsel both the power and the responsibility to look at a wide range of possible offenses touching on the receipt of gratuities, including mail and wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343, and 1346; salary supplementation under 18 U.S.C. §§ 209 and 216(b); false statements to government officials under 18 U.S.C. § 1001; false recording of the gratuities under 15 U.S.C. § 78m(b)(2); failure to report receipts as required by ethical regulations; and other violations of ethical regulations to the extent such violations offend other criminal statutes. Later referrals of related matters compelled the Independent Counsel to address a variety of violations of other possible criminal statutes, such as the federal election laws. During the OIC's investigation, the Attorney General and the Special Division referred a total of five related matters to the Independent Counsel for investigation.\n\nOn September 14, 1994, shortly after the Independent Counsel's appointment, the Attorney General referred as related matters the two allegations that\n\n(a) Secretary Espy hosted a fundraising dinner, attended by agricultural lobbyists, the purpose of which was to retire the campaign debt of his brother; and\n\n(b) Debts of Secretary Espy, including an automobile loan, were paid by a government contractor.\n\nThe investigation of these two matters is discussed in Sections II.E.1.f and II.C.1.c, respectively.\n\nOn October 20, 1994, the Attorney General referred to the Independent Counsel a third related matter - the allegation that\n\nSecretary Espy was improperly influenced by Tyson Foods to intervene, in February 1993, on behalf of U.S. poultry producers in a dispute involving the labeling of chicken shipped from the United States to Puerto Rico.\n\nThe investigation of this matter is discussed in Section II.A.1.b.(3).\n\nOn April 1, 1996, upon the Independent Counsel's request and over DOJ's objection, the Special Division referred to OIC, as a fourth related matter, the investigation of\n\nany application, appeal, or request for subsidy made to or considered by the United States Department of Agriculture, for which Secretary of Agriculture Alphonso Michael (Mike) Espy and/or his Chief of Staff Ronald Blackley intervened in the application, approval, or review process.\n\nThe investigation of this matter is discussed in Section II.F.\n\nOn October 15, 1996, the Attorney General referred to OIC, as a fifth related matter, the allegation that\n\nRichard Douglas [the executive of Sun-Diamond Growers of California who had given gifts to Espy] may have obtained a mortgage loan in 1993 by making false representations and submitting false writings and documents to a broker and a lender.\n\nThe investigation of this matter is discussed in Section II.G.1.\n\nEarly on in the investigation - in January 1995 - OIC requested the Attorney General to refer either as a related matter or as an expansion of its jurisdiction the authority to investigate Tyson Foods' gifts to other public officials. The Attorney General refused this request. The matter is discussed in Section II.A.1.d. The Independent Counsel sought one additional referral from the Special Division concerning irregularities in Espy's congressional campaign account, which the panel denied on June 12, 1998. The circumstances of this request are discussed in Section II.G.2.\n\nAn Independent Counsel's statutory powers include conducting grand-jury proceedings and other investigations, participating in civil and criminal court proceedings and litigation, and appealing any decision in any case in which the counsel participates in an official capacity. 28 U.S.C. § 594(a)(1)-(3). An Independent Counsel has authority to obtain immunity for witnesses and to consult with the United States Attorney in the district where crimes were allegedly committed. His powers include \"initiating and conducting prosecutions in any court of competent jurisdiction, framing and signing indictments, filing informations, and handling all aspects of any case, in the name of the United States.\" He appoints employees, requests and obtains assistance from DOJ, and may accept referral of matters from the Attorney General, if the matter falls within the Independent Counsel's jurisdiction as defined by the Special Division. He is required, except to the extent inconsistent with the statute, to \"comply with the written or other established policies of the DOJ respecting enforcement of the criminal laws.\" 28 U.S.C. § 594(f). He has \"full authority to dismiss matters within [his] prosecutorial jurisdiction without conducting an investigation or at any subsequent time before prosecution, if to do so would be consistent\" with DOJ policy. 28 U.S.C. § 594(g). (23)\n\nII. THE OFFICE OF INDEPENDENT COUNSEL'S INVESTIGATION\n\nA. Gifts Solicited or Received by Secretary Espy\n\nThe Independent Counsel's original mandate centered on allegations that Secretary of Agriculture Alphonso Michael Espy received gratuities from agricultural interests, in particular from Tyson Foods, Inc. The Office of Independent Counsel (OIC) undertook a thorough inquiry into all things of value Espy received from persons and entities that had an interest in Espy's official actions and, more generally, in actions of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). In the course of its investigation, OIC uncovered a wide variety of benefits conferred on Espy, and indirectly on him through his girlfriend Patricia Dempsey or members of his family, by representatives of companies subject to USDA regulation who had significant issues awaiting resolution.\n\nThe things of value that Espy received from agricultural interests while in office, and the companies whose agents gave or facilitated the giving of things of value while they had matters before him, are set forth chronologically in the following table:\n\nDATE THINGS OF VALUE SOURCE 1/5/93 Dinner at Mr. K's Restaurant in Washington, D.C. (estimated value $123) Sun-Diamond Growers of California 1/6/93 Dinner at Twenty One Federal Restaurant in Washington, D.C. (estimated value $73) Sun-Diamond Growers of California 1/13/93 Dinner at Le Mistral Restaurant in Washington, D.C. (estimated value $50) Sun-Diamond Growers of California 1/18/93 Four Presidential Inaugural Dinner seats ($6,000 value) Tyson Foods, Inc. 3/14/93 Hartman luggage / dinner at Steamers Restaurant in Bethesda, Maryland (estimated value $2,427) Sun-Diamond Growers of California 5/13/93 $3,100 cash to Secretary Espy's girlfriend for a trip to Greece International Nut Council (through Richard Douglas) 5/14-16/93 Tyson birthday party in Russellville, Arkansas, including airfare, meals, lodging and entertainment (estimated value $2,556) Tyson Foods, Inc. 6/7/93-3/95 Employment for Secretary Espy's girlfriend at EOP as \"Seminar Planner and Staff Associate\" from June 1993 to March 1995 (total compensation of $63,861) The EOP Group, Inc. 6/18/93 Two tickets to Chicago Bulls-Phoenix Suns 1993 NBA championship game in Chicago (face value $95) Quaker Oats 7/6/93 Lunch barbecue from Sutton Place Gourmet in Washington, D.C. (estimated value $75) Sun-Diamond Growers of California 9/11-12/93 U.S. Open tennis tickets and limousines in New York City for Secretary Espy and his girlfriend (estimated value $4,446) Sun-Diamond Growers of California 9/18/93 Three tickets to Congressional Black Caucus Foundation Annual Awards Dinner in Washington, D.C. (estimated value $1,500) Morgan Stanley 9/26-29/93 Weekend stay at Greenbriar Resort in West Virginia (cost $569) American Crop Protection Association (through Michael O'Bannon of EOP) 10/29/93 Six bottles of wine (retail price $187) Robert Mondavi Winery 11/10/93 Two tickets to Washington Bullets-New York Knicks NBA game in Washington, D.C. (estimated value $222) Sun-Diamond Growers of California 1/4/94 $1,200 per-semester (8 semesters) college scholarship to Secretary Espy's girlfriend (total value $9,600 (of which $1,200 was paid)) Tyson Foundation 1/15-16/94 Weekend trip to Dallas, Texas, including airfare, limousines and tickets to Dallas Cowboys-Green Bay Packers NFL playoff football game (estimated value $2,271) Tyson Foods, Inc. 1/17/94 Waterford crystal bowl (estimated value $173) Sun-Diamond Growers of California 1/29/94 Dinner at the Ritz-Carlton in Atlanta, Georgia (estimated value $50) Sun-Diamond Growers of California 1/30/94 One NFL Super Bowl ticket (cost of $2,200) Oglethorpe Power/The EOP Group, Inc./Smith Barney 1/30/94 Four NFL Super Bowl tickets (cost of $857) Fernbank Museum 3/8/94 Dinner at Kinkead's Restaurant in Washington, D.C. for Secretary Espy and his girlfriend (estimated value $207) Robert Mondavi Winery 3/11/94 Dinner at Ca'Brea Restaurant in Los Angeles, California (estimated value $77) Sun-Diamond Growers of California 4/1/94 $10,000 in contributions to the Henry Espy for Congress Committee Sun-Diamond Growers of California/Richard Douglas\n\nEspy's counsel maintained at trial that some donors of these gifts were personal friends of Espy. Similarly, Espy appeared, in his own mind at least, to have justified the receipt of many of these things of value on two grounds: that they were given to his girlfriend Patricia Dempsey, not directly to him or a blood relation, and that some of the immediate donors were his friends - in particular Richard Douglas of Sun-Diamond Growers and Michael O'Bannon of the EOP Group. In his diary, he explored possible \"book themes\" to explain his legal difficulties, including the following: \"My errors - reliance on non-blood relationships (Pat) reliance on friendship exception Richard Douglas, O'Bannon.\"\n\nThe \"friendship exception\" is a reference to regulations promulgated by the Office of Government Ethics that specifically recognize \"gifts based on a personal relationship\" as an exception to the general regulatory prohibition on receipt of any gifts over $20 in value from prohibited sources. 5 C.F.R. § 2635.204(b). The regulations provide that such exceptions apply to enforcement of the gratuities statute, 18 U.S.C. § 201(c)(1)(B). 5 C.F.R. § 2635.202(b). However, the regulations make clear that this friendship exception is limited:\n\nGifts based on a personal relationship. An employee may accept a gift given under circumstances which make it clear that the gift is motivated by a family relationship or personal friendship rather than the position of the employee. Relevant factors in making such a determination include the history of the relationship and whether the family member or friend personally pays for the gift.\n\n5 C.F.R. § 2635.204(b).\n\nEspy's acceptance of these gifts was not protected by the friendship exception because the gifts were given for business purposes and paid for by businesses either regulated by or having matters before USDA. It is immaterial that the person who presented the gifts on behalf of the companies happened to be Espy's personal friends. Espy either knew or willfully ignored the source of the expensive gifts he received.\n\n1. Gifts from Tyson Foods, Inc.\n\nOf all the entities investigated by OIC, Tyson Foods, Inc. was the largest and best connected to President Clinton. It had direct entree to the White House through its chairman, Don Tyson, a longtime supporter of President Clinton, and its chief counsel, James Blair, was described in a White House memo as the President's \"close personal friend.\" Blair had an office at the corporate headquarters of Tyson Foods in Springdale, Arkansas.\n\nIn December 1992, while still a congressman, Espy sought Don Tyson's help in being appointed to the new Clinton administration cabinet. After Espy's appointment, Don Tyson and other Tyson Foods officials subsequently sought to maintain direct access to and influence with Espy through a pattern of gift-giving, which began immediately before Espy was sworn in as the Secretary of Agriculture and continued until shortly before publication of the March 17, 1994 Wall Street Journal article that reported on these activities. During Espy's first year in office, Tyson Foods gave Espy, Espy's girlfriend, and Espy's relatives things of value worth a total of more than $12,000 for or because of official acts performed or to be performed by the Secretary.\n\na. The Donors\n\nIn 1993 and 1994, Tyson Foods was the world's largest fully integrated producer, processor and marketer of poultry-based food products. Its market share of chicken products sold in the United States was approximately 23%. It also had a smaller beef and pork division. The company's integrated operations included breeding and rearing chickens and hogs, harvesting seafood, and processing and marketing poultry, beef, pork and seafood. The company processed approximately 3.9 billion pounds of consumer poultry and 518 million pounds of consumer beef and pork during fiscal 1994. Tyson Foods' annual sales in 1993 and 1994 were approximately $5 billion, with beef and pork operations accounting for approximately 10% of its business.\n\nTyson Foods in 1993 and 1994 owned and operated approximately 60 poultry processing plants, 18 of which also processed beef and pork products, in 17 states and three foreign countries. USDA inspected all of Tyson Foods' slaughtering and processing facilities and pervasively regulated their operations. The company noted in its annual 10-K report for 1994:\n\nThe Company's poultry, beef, pork and Mexican food-based processing facilities are . . . subject to extensive inspection and regulation by the United States Department of Agriculture.\n\nAs Tyson Foods' main lines of business were food processing and distribution, it had an obvious reason to maintain Espy's receptive ear. The company was subject to extensive USDA regulation in its everyday operations. Tyson Foods routinely had numerous matters pending before USDA - matters that could and did substantially affect the company's operations. During Espy's tenure as Secretary of Agriculture, pending USDA policy issues had the potential to affect more than $100 million of Tyson Foods' business.\n\nDon Tyson, chairman of the Board of Directors, owned or controlled approximately 90% of the voting shares of the company. Don Tyson was a friend of and political contributor to Bill Clinton when he was Governor of Arkansas and when he ran for the presidency of the United States. Don Tyson's son, John H. Tyson, was president of the Beef and Pork Division and a director of Tyson Foods in 1993.\n\nArchibald R. Schaffer III was Tyson Foods' director of Media, Public and Governmental Affairs. In this capacity, Schaffer acted as the company's principal spokesperson and was responsible for overseeing all of Tyson Foods' dealings with and lobbying of government officials, supervising all contacts with the press and administering all public-relations efforts. His duties included reviewing official comments that Tyson Foods' technical department submitted to government agencies regarding proposed legislation and regulations. He was also the primary contact between Tyson Foods and two trade associations to which it belonged, the National Broiler Council and the Arkansas Poultry Federation. Schaffer reported directly to John Tyson and supervised Tyson Foods' Washington, D.C. lobbyist, Jack Williams. Don Tyson testified that he expected Schaffer and his predecessor to advise him on the legalities of his dealings with government officials, and in this respect Schaffer had let him down.\n\nJack L. Williams, a registered lobbyist, represented Tyson Foods' interests before various governmental agencies, including USDA. Williams reported to Don Tyson, John Tyson and Schaffer. He submitted monthly invoices for \"Legislative Liaison Services\" to Tyson Foods, including a flat fee for services rendered and a non-itemized amount for \"additional Washington expenses\" that varied from month to month and that Schaffer reviewed and approved. Williams also represented other clients before USDA.\n\nThe National Broiler Council (NBC), a trade association for the poultry industry, described itself as \"representing the producers/processors of 95% of the broiler chickens consumed in the United States.\" Its purpose was to promote poultry products and maintain a legislative liaison presence with regulatory authorities and Congress. The $165,000 in annual dues paid by Tyson Foods, nearly twice those of the next-largest member, comprised 8% of the NBC's annual budget, making Tyson Foods the trade association's largest and dominant member.\n\nThe Arkansas Poultry Federation (APF) was a trade association that represented the interests of the poultry industry in Arkansas before federal, state and local government entities. Its membership consisted of poultry processors, feed manufacturers, commercial egg producers and others. Each member company paid up to a maximum $15,000 in annual dues; in each of 1993 and 1994, Tyson Foods, the largest dues-paying member, paid $45,000 reflecting the three companies it controlled.\n\nThe Tyson Foundation, Inc., an entity separate from Tyson Foods, was formed in 1969 as a not-for-profit Arkansas charitable corporation funded with Tyson Foods stock. It was organized, in part, to provide college scholarships to needy students who resided in the vicinity of Tyson Foods' operating facilities. As the Tyson Foundation stock increased in value, the foundation developed into a significant charitable education enterprise, with assets in 1995 valued in excess of $15 million.\n\nAfter the 1992 presidential election, Mississippi Congressman Espy approached John Rogers, president of C.B. Rogers, Inc., a large Mississippi poultry company, seeking an introduction to Don Tyson. Espy was interested in being nominated as Secretary of Agriculture or Commerce in the Clinton administration. Because of his position as chairman of one of the world's largest poultry companies and his reputed relationship with the President-elect, Don Tyson appeared to be in an advantageous position to influence the new administration's selection of the Agriculture Secretary. Rogers agreed to arrange the meeting. Shortly thereafter, Espy, Ronald Blackley (Espy's Congressional district agricultural representative and future Chief of Staff), Rogers, and Rogers's wife flew in Rogers's private plane from Mississippi to Little Rock, Arkansas to meet with Don Tyson.\n\nJohn Tyson met the group at the airport in Arkansas. Espy, Blackley, Rogers and John Tyson then traveled to Little Rock for lunch, where Don Tyson joined them. During lunch, Rogers told Don Tyson that Espy wanted to be a Cabinet member and urged him to use his influence with the President-elect to assure that Espy be considered. Espy then informed Don Tyson of his qualifications for the post and solicited his assistance.\n\nAfter he became Secretary of Agriculture, Espy occasionally met Don and John Tyson, primarily at social gatherings and events, and the Tysons made use of such occasions to lobby Espy on matters of interest. Espy's most frequent contact with Tyson Foods, however, came through lobbyist Williams, with whom he frequently met to discuss policy matters affecting Tyson Foods. Espy's calendar reflects that he met with Williams on at least the five following scheduled dates: February 3, 1993; March 11, 1993; January 25, 1994; February 16, 1994; and March 9, 1994. Williams also was known to show up unannounced "
