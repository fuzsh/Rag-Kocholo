        "text": "Pre 1770\n\nIndigenous History\n\nTamien-speaking indigenous communities, later known as the Ohlone, live in villages in what is now Mountain View. A large earthern mound created by the local tribes (near the present-day Monta Loma neighborhood) serves as a ceremonial and cultural center for the area.\n\n1777\n\nSpanish Colonization\n\nMost of the South Bay becomes part of the lands of Mission Santa Clara de Asis. Indigenous peoples are relocated to Mission Santa Clara and other nearby missions, where disease kills much of the population and traditional culture and autonomy is subverted.\n\n1821\n\nMexican Independence\n\nMexico wins independence from Spain and Alta California becomes a territory of the newly established nation.\n\n1833\n\nMission Secularization\n\nThe Spanish-era mission system is secularized (disestablished), with the intention of turning over mission lands to indigenous peoples who had survived the mission-era. Most lands are granted to Hispanic Californio families.\n\n1842\n\nRancho Pastoria de las Borregas\n\nThe Mexican government grants the 8,800-acre Rancho Pastoria de las Borregas (ranch of the lambs pasture) to Franciso Estrada and his wife, Inez Castro. Estrada builds the first permanent home in what is now Mountain View, near what is now Central Expressway and Rengstorff Avenue. After Estrada dies in 1845, ownership passes to Inez’s father, Mariano Castro.\n\n1844\n\nRancho Posolmi\n\nA 1,700-acre Rancho Posolmi is granted by the Mexican government to Lupe Ynigo, one of the few local Native Americans to be granted a rancho. The rancho is named after a Ohlone village once located in the area. This area later became Moffett Field.\n\n1850\n\nOld Mountain View\n\nA stage coach service begins on El Camino Real and a stop is established near Grant Road, creating a center of activity for the surrounding area and leading to the establishment of a settlement soon to be named Mountain View.\n\n1854\n\nMountain View is Named\n\nJacob Shumway, store keeper and the town’s first postmaster, is credited with the naming of Mountain View. Mountain View School District is formed.\n\n1860\n\nShipping on the Bay\n\nMountain View’s San Francisco bay shoreline becomes a center of local economic activity. Henry Rengstorff, John G. Jagels and Charles Guth build docks and warehouses to ship the region’s produce and supplies. Their landings were located on land now part of Shoreline Park, the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge, and Moffett Field.\n\n1861\n\nCastro Family History\n\nLand for Mountain View Cemetery is donated by Maria Peralta de Castro (now the location of Pioneer Memorial Park)\n\n1864\n\nCastro Street\n\nThe San Francisco San Jose Railroad begins service (now operated by Caltrain) with a station one mile from the original town of Mountain View on El Camino Real. The town of New Mountain View, also known as Mountain View Station, is established near the train stop and Castro Street becomes the new community’s downtown. The Castro family is given a “flag stop” station near their home, known as Castro Station, in compensation for the railroad running through their rancho lands. Castro Station remains in operation until its replaced by San Antonio Station in 1999.\n\n1867\n\nSaint Joseph Church Established\n\nSaint Joseph Catholic Church opens as a satellite of Mission Santa Clara. A small chapel near the banks of Stevens Creek on El Camino Real in the original town of Mountain View serves as the church’s home until it relocates to its present location at the corner of Church and Hope streets in 1905.\n\n1869\n\nWhisman School District\n\nHenry Rengstorff leads efforts to form the Whisman School District, serving students in what is now northern Mountain View. The district is named after local stagecoach line operator John Whisman. The first Whisman School was located on Stierlin Road (now N. Shoreline Boulevard) on land donated by Rengstorff.\n\n1879\n\nYuen Lung settles in Mountain View\n\nChinese immigrant Yuen Lung settles in Mountain View. He opens a store on the corner of Villa and View Streets. Over time, other Chinese and Japanese owned businesses cluster around the area, which becomes known as “Chinatown”.\n\n1900\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2002\n\n100th Anniversary\n\nThe City of Mountain View celebrates the 100th anniversary of its incorporation with events throughout the year, culminating in the dedication of Centennial Plaza and a replica of Mountain View’s Southern Pacific Depot, originally built in 1888 and demolished in 1959.\n\n2007\n\nSchmitz Family Lose their Farm\n\nAfter two decades tending the last working farm in Mountain View, the Schmitz family lose the lease on their 15-acre farm on Grant Road. The property is developed in 2010 with 53 single family homes and the farm’s historic windmill is relocated next to the Rengstorff House. The development of the farm leaves just one agricultural property in Mountain View, a 9-acre apricot orchard on Whisman Road.\n\n2008\n\nKhan Academy Founded\n\nKhan Academy started by Salman Khan with headquarters in Mountain View khanacademy.org. The mission of the nonprofit educational organization is to provide a free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere.\n\n2014\n\nMinimum Wage Approved\n\nOn October 9 the Mountain View City Council approves establishing a minimum wage in the City of Mountain View of $10.30 per hour effective July 1, 2015, with annual adjustments for inflation on January 1 of each following year. The City Council also adopts a goal of reaching a $15.00 per hour minimum wage by 2018.\n\n2016\n\nRent Stabilization Program\n\nA voter approved measure establishes the City of Mountain View’s Rent Stabilization Program, which implements measures to stabilize the community by reducing rental housing turnover in certain rental units.\n\n2016\n\nHeritage Park Opens\n\nHeritage Park opens on Rengstorff Avenue. The park features the historic Immigrant House, a circa 1880 cottage originally located in Downtown Mountain View. It is restored to commemorate the many immigrant farmworkers that came to Mountain View during its agricultural heyday.\n\n2020\n\nCOVID-19\n\nThe COVID pandemic shuts down businesses and schools on March 16 by order of the Santa Clara County Health Department. Remote work, mask wearing and learning on Zoom become the standard way that people, workers and students connect. The guidelines remain in effect for months as the disease spreads throughout the country. Four blocks of Castro Street close to automobile traffic to accommodate outdoor dining.\n\n2021\n\nCOVID-19 Vaccines\n\nA two-part vaccine for COVID becomes available, with free vaccinations available at the Community Center. Long lines form at the center as Mountain View residents are eager to get their shots.\n\n2022\n\nPedestrian Mall on Castro Street\n\nOn October 25, 2022, City Council adopts an ordinance to establish a pedestrian mall on Castro Street between the West Evelyn Avenue and California Street.\n\nThe implementation of the Castro Street Pedestrian Mall will be a two phased approach. The first three-five years is known as the interim plan and is designed to strengthen the layout of the space, provide clear standards/ guidelines, and identify interim infrastructure needs. The second phase is the long-term visioning of Castro Street as a pedestrian mall."
