        "text": "The Arrington Bridge III wetland mitigation project is located on a 57.40 acre site three miles southwest of Goldsboro in western Wayne County, NC. One unnamed channelized drainage feature that traverses the site exhibited diminished habitat value as a result of past and on-going agricultural activities. RES identified the site as having potential to help meet the compensatory mitigation requirements for wetland impacts in hydrologic unit 03020201 of the Neuse River Basin.\n\nThis project involves the restoration and enhancement of 41.24 acres of wetlands that had been disturbed by historic mining, agricultural activities, and active cattle grazing. The project presents 29.37 acres of wetland restoration and 11.87 acres of wetland enhancement, generating 32.51 Wetland Mitigation Units (WMU’s). This mitigation project is the third of three phases. Due to its location and improvements, the project provides numerous ecological and water quality benefits within the Neuse River Basin. While many of these benefits are limited to the project area, others, such as pollutant removal and improved aquatic and terrestrial habitat, have more far-reaching effects.\n\nThe objective for this restoration project was to restore a continuous bottomland wetland system and enhance the hydrology of existing wetlands. The design was based on reference conditions, USACE guidance (USACE, 2005), and criteria developed during this project to achieve success. Initial site design included the construction of three slough habitats to increase surface water storage and include patches of habitat more typical of reference Cypress-Gum Swamps. Through coordination with the Interagency Review Team (IRT) and the Seymour Johnson Air Force Base (SJAFB), it was requested that the restoration design minimize standing water features that attract birds. Therefore, the slough features and Cypress-Gum Swamp wetlands have been removed from the design and the restoration plan is now exclusively bottomland hardwood forest. Additional project objectives include restoring native vegetation, ensuring hydraulic stability, and eradicating invasive species.\n\nThe Beaver Island Habitat Rehabilitation and Enhancement Project (HREP) is in Clinton County, Iowa, between the cities of Camanche and Clinton, in Pool 14 on Upper Mississippi River. The project area is comprised of interconnected backwaters, secondary channels, wetlands, and floodplain habitat. The complex of backwaters and wetlands has historically provided spawning, nursery, and overwintering habitat for fish and feeding and resting habitat for migratory water birds.\n\nDuring the project, RES was focused on timber stand improvement such as tree releases, girdling, restoration of native floodplain forest vegetation and other interspersed tree plantings. The treatment areas are located on the downstream half of Beaver Island, which is in Navigation Pool 14 near Clinton, Iowa spanning from river mile 516 to 513. In total, this task order included approximately 123 acres of enhancement area.\n\nAs a sub to Red Bison, LLC, RES staff performed all Timber Stand Improvement work, including identification and marking of all trees to be cut or girdled and all free and geometric thinning to release desirable trees. RES staff also supported sourcing of plant material and transportation of plants from shore to the island, as well as conducted all plant layout and recorded GPS locations for approximately 4,000 containerized native trees and shrubs. RES also served as the contractor’s on-site quality control manager during TSI and planting activities.\n\nFunding for this HREP was provided by The Upper Mississippi River Restoration (UMRR) Program. Authorized by the Water Resources Development Act of 1986, the UMRR is the first environmental restoration and monitoring program undertaken on a large river system in the United States.\n\nThe BHP Terrebonne Biodiversity and Resiliency Projects employ cypress swamp plantings and marsh terrace creation – both proven ecological restoration approaches that improve the quality of lands and waters that support human, animal, and marine populations, especially along Louisiana’s fragile, eroding coastline.\n\nThese projects maintain the values of the ecosystem as larger-scale public projects in the state’s coastal master plan come online over time. Once completed, the projects will restore 125 acres of wetlands, with an estimated economic value of $1.2 million per year, 280 tons of carbon sequestered per year, and the elimination of up to 265 pounds of phosphorus and 10,600 lbs of nitrogen each year to improve water quality in those areas.\n\nThe projects will be the first two listed in America’s Wetland Conservation & Restoration Registry. This Registry is an inventory and reporting of private projects, consistent with Louisiana’s coastal master plan, that has been completed or planned and available for private sponsorship and funding.\n\nAs an integral partner in the project, RES is restoring the historic Cypress-Tupelo Swamp habitat through the planting of 30,000 restorative cypress trees, plus invasive species management, with the goal set on bringing the area back to its historic state. Additionally, RES designed, permitted, and is constructing a 25-acre marsh terrace with 5,000 cypress trees and 35,000 marsh grass plugs. Our team is committed to the project through five years of monitoring, mapping, and reporting along with annual drone flights to demonstrate project success.\n\nRES was awarded the contract for the largest Permittee Responsible Mitigation (PRM) ecological mitigation project to date, to restore an approximately 17,000-acre area as part of the North Texas Municipal Lake Project.\n\nThe environmental mitigation is one important component of the North Texas Municipal Lake Project, an approximately 16,500-acre reservoir being built in Fannin County to provide critical new water services to the 13 cities in the District. RES will provide complete stewardship of the mitigation site, from design and implementation through monitoring and maintenance over the next 20+ years, in accordance with the environmental permit for the lake project. The permit requires that NTMWD offset the unavoidable environmental impacts of building the lake by restoring and permanently protecting wetlands, forests, grasslands, and streams at the mitigation site.\n\nThe mitigation plan encompasses over 6,800 acres of wetland restoration and enhancement on the Riverby Ranch in Fannin and Lamar Counties, which will provide wildlife habitat and improve water quality in North Texas and Oklahoma. As part of the project, RES will restore or enhance over 369,000 linear feet (70 miles) of streams and plant more than five million trees. In addition, RES will restore or enhance over 3,000 acres of native grasslands and over 2,600 acres of forests. RES will maintain full-time onsite staff living on the Riverby Ranch property as well as provide full project management of design, construction, and monitoring of the site to ensure the restoration project is successful.\n\nThe Buffalo Branch project is located within an agricultural watershed in Johnston County, North Carolina, approximately four miles North of Selma. The project involved the restoration and protection of streams in the Buffalo Creek watershed, with the overall goal of restoring and enhancing a stream/wetland complex located within the Neuse River Basin (below Falls Lake). Found within USGS HUC 03020201, a Targeted Local Watershed (TLW), the watershed is characterized by 44 percent agricultural land use area, and identified as a high priority watershed for projects that address flow restoration, reduction of impoundments, and buffer restoration. Before restoration and enhancement, the site consisted of cattle pastures and wooded areas, a mix of pines, hardwoods, and invasive species. Channels were severely degraded to a point where they no longer accessed their floodplain, lacked riparian buffers, allowed livestock access, and failed to support aquatic life. Our team’s work entailed the restoration of natural stream characteristics, such as stable cross sections, platform, and in-stream habitat. The floodplain areas were hydrologically reconnected to the channel to provide a natural exchange and storage during flooding events. In addition to the stream restoration, mitigation design preserved and enhanced the hydrology of six wetland seeps, two linear and four hillside, in the project area. Benefits of our efforts included stream banks erosion prevention and a reduction of in-stream sedimentation and nutrients, restoring the riparian buffer with native vegetation, ensuring hydraulic stability, and treating invasive species. The Buffalo Branch Stream Mitigation project is located in the southern portion of the TLW and includes streams that discharge into Buffalo Creek (303d listed). Due to its location and improvements, the project provided numerous ecological and water quality benefits within the TLW and Neuse River Basin.\n\n2019 Award Winner – Best Restored Beaches from the American Shore and Beach Preservation Association (ASBPA)\n\nThe Caminada Headland Beach and Dune Restoration Project is part of a restoration and protection of beach and dune habitat through the direct placement of approximately 5.4 million cubic yards of sandy material from Ship Shoal (an offshore borrow source). The fill material was barged to a staging area near the mouth of West Belle Pass, then pumped via a pipeline for placement on the shoreline.\n\nThis project created and enhanced over 300 acres of beach and dune, reinforcing almost six miles of barrier headland habitat, while reducing the impacts of storm events on Port Fourchon and LA Highway 1, a vital hurricane evacuation route for Fourchon and Grand Isle. The restoration project also provided important habitat for nesting shorebirds as well as migratory birds. RES’ role on this project was to install native species on the recently formed project features. Our nursery sourced seed stock from the USDA NRCS Plant Materials Center and had state plant material certification with the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry.\n\nUnder the State’s direction, RES planted 75,970 four-inch containers of bitter panicum (Panicum amarum) and 30,338 one-gallon containers of sea oats (Uniola paniculate). Site conditions were loose sandy beach, where all mobilization was conducted via land-based routes.\n\nHeat stress on plants was particularly a difficult obstacle for this project. Due to the heat, RES opted to perform multiple deliveries throughout the planting period bringing only enough plants that they could plant each day. Due to the adaptive planting techniques utilized by RES, this large-scale planting effort was very successful, and the mortality of the newly planted vegetation was drastically reduced.\n\nThe Chagrin River Watershed Partners (CRWP) and the City of Kirtland sought a qualified design-build contractor to complete the design and restoration construction of a streambank stabilization project along the East Branch Chagrin River.\n\nCRWP and the City applied for funding from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio EPA) Section 319(h) Nonpoint Source grant program to procure design-build services, in order to develop an innovative Natural Channel Design and streambank bioengineering approach to address significant channel impairments along the project reach.\n\nWhile the impetus for the project was the protection of Wisner Road and adjacent infrastructure from rapid bank erosion, our restoration design is multi-faceted and will reestablish equilibrium conditions that efficiently transport water and sediment, reverse systemic erosion, provide enhanced ecological value, restored in-stream habitat, and fisheries, and improved site aesthetics. RES achieved this with a combination of strategically placed in-stream structures and innovative bioengineered bank treatments that replicate the natural stabilization processes in order to regain channel stability and restore the lost functions and values of a robust stream system.\n\nOur approach relied on rebuilding the toe of the slope, prior to grading eroded banks back to a stable angle of repose. Bank reinforcement included the application of composite revetment, a layered bioengineered bank treatment of rock, geotextile, soil, and live woody cuttings. RES constructed the composite revetment in combination with two rock riffles to strategically direct flow, narrow and deepen the existing channel, and establish stable meander geometry. These structures act as a catalyst for deep center channel development, provide a localized reduction in shear stress, and lead to the development of stable streambanks, pool/riffle habitat, diverse bedforms, and in-stream habitat. Along an adjacent meander bend, a flood bench was reconstructed, using a combination of materials salvaged on-site. These materials included on-site rock and riprap, stream gravel, large timber, and woody debris to create a natural toe-of-slope treatment, called toewood revetment. Toewood revetment mimics the natural recovery processes in riverine systems and provides prime resting and feeding habitats for Salmonids. RES designed, permitted, and constructed the project, completed in June of 2020.\n\nThe Compass Point Mitigation site is located in Yadkin County, approximately 4.5 miles northeast of Boonville. The project presents 5,304 linear feet (LF) of stream restoration and enhancement generating cool stream mitigation Units (SMU) along three unnamed tributaries that drain directly to the Yadkin River within Cataloging Unit 03040101, 12-digit United States Geological Survey (USGS) HUC 030401011001, and North Carolina Department of Water Resources (NCDWR) sub-basin 03-07-02. The current State classification for the Yadkin River at this location is Class C (NCDWQ 2011).\n\nThe project’s total easement area is approximately 165 acres within the overall drainage area of 271 acres. Water quality stressors currently affecting the Project include livestock production, agricultural production, and lack of riparian buffer. Grazing livestock have historically had access to most stream reaches within the Project. The lack of riparian buffer vegetation, deep-rooted vegetation, and unstable channel characteristics have contributed to the degradation of stream banks throughout the project area.\n\nThe project provides numerous ecological and water quality benefits within the Yadkin River Basin by applying an ecosystem restoration approach. The restoration approach at the reach scale of this project will have the greatest effect on the hydraulic and geomorphology function of the system but will benefit the upper-level functions (physiochemical and biology) over time, and in combination with other projects within the watershed. Buffer improvements filter runoff from agricultural fields, thereby reducing nutrient and sediment loads to the channel. Livestock exclusion fence was installed along the easement boundary. The widening and restoration of the riparian areas will also provide wildlife corridors throughout the Project area. Benefits to be accrued from these activities include improved water quality and terrestrial and aquatic habitat. Stream construction was completed in May 2020.\n\nSince 2010, RES, previously E Sciences, has provided environmental engineering support to the City of Pompano Beach and the CRA. RES has conducted several projects under this contract, including the following:\n\nSabal Golf Course Brownfield Cleanup\n\nThe City engaged RES to complete a contamination assessment and facilitate cleanup activities on this contaminated golf course. Using historic assessments compiled by others, RES conducted additional assessments, developed the remediation plan and bidding scope, and assisted the City with hiring a contractor to implement the remediation. RES provided consulting and oversight throughout the remedial activities and the follow-up regulatory coordination and reporting. This $1M cleanup was completed within two months (over holidays) for the City to maximize the financial benefits of the Brownfields program. The project was approved for conditional closure.\n\nPalm Aire Lakes Water Quality Assessment\n\nRES prepared a water quality “snapshot” of the lakes within Palm Aire Country Club for the City. This project was conducted to support the City’s potential acquisition of the stormwater lakes and to assist the City in determining if they were discharging pollutants into an adjacent SFWMD canal. The parameters analyzed were selected based on historical land and FDEP rules.\n\nCorner of Atlantic Avenue/West Dixie Highway\n\nThis assemblage includes numerous parcels owned by the CRA and adjacent properties owned by others. RES conducted Phase I and Phase II ESAs on the multiple parcels. The Phase I ESA revealed RECs related to historical land uses, such as dry cleaners, gasoline stations, blueprints and photostat businesses, auto sales, and service centers with historic underground storage tanks and lumber yards. The site was determined to be contaminated by the historic dry cleaner.\n\nRES prepared a site development evaluation for this property, guiding the CRA on how the presence of contamination could impact site redevelopment and setting forth strategies for minimizing the impact of contamination on construction, designing the site to minimize the impact of construction and site development, and reducing potential risks.\n\nDixie Highway NEPA Evaluations\n\nOur team conducted NEPA evaluations on two segments of Dixie Highway within the City to support the City’s applications to the Federal Highway Administration for infrastructure improvements, including improving safety for alternative modes of transportation, landscape and streetscape improvements, and access to transit.\n\nCommunity Gardens Parcels\n\nRES evaluated the suitability of three vacant, CRA-owned parcels for use as community gardens for a local school. The community gardens will be used to teach children about agriculture and healthy food choices. Vegetables grown on these lots will be used to provide fresh vegetables for families and children in the community. Incremental sampling methodology was used for soil assessment at this site resulting in several thousands of dollars in savings for the CRA.\n\nMartin Luther King Boulevard NEPA Review\n\nRES prepared the Type I and Programmatic Categorical Exclusion Checklist and Memo for this streetscape improvement project between NW 31st Avenue and Powerline Road. This project is one segment of a planned, multi-city education corridor partially funded through the FDOT Local Agency Program (LAP). The environmental review included coordination with the State Historic Preservation Office regarding a potentially historic site and an inventory of community and cultural resources.\n\nSW 36th Avenue Pedestrian Bridge Path LAP Project Design and Permitting\n\nIn addition to the work conducted under this CRA contract, RES assisted with the environmental permitting for a pedestrian path project for the City. Tasks included conducting field assessments of wetland and tree impacts, assisting with permit application packages, and coordinating with the permitting agencies and FDOT.\n\nBlanche Ely and Adjacent Parcels\n\nRES assessed this property, which consists of 27 parcels in the CRA. Historic land uses such as dry cleaners, an automotive repair facility, and a UST were identified as RECs. Phase II testing indicated the presence of chlorinated solvents at this property. RES further assisted the CRA in determining the best way to utilize the information in the context of the CRA’s plans for future redevelopment.\n\nMallek Property\n\nRES performed a Phase I and Phase II ESA of multiple acres of urban land being purchased by the Pompano Beach CRA to evaluate potential environmental concerns. The Phase I ESA revealed the possible presence of historic USTs and contamination associated with the historical land use. Phase II services included a geophysical survey, and soil and groundwater testing. A UST was discovered during the Phase II ESA. RES guided the CRA on the proper regulatory course of action to remove the UST and move forward with the purchase and redevelopment of the Site.\n\nBroward Community & Family Health Center\n\nRES prepared Environmental Information and Documentation to satisfy Health Resources and Services Administration grant application requirements. The project was conducted to support the potential redevelopment of CRA parcels with a much-needed community health care facility. The documentation was required for the grant applicant to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act.\n\nSince 2008, RES has contracted with the City of Fort Lauderdale to offer continuous environmental engineering assistance across three consultant selection procedures. The contract’s breadth provides ample opportunities for RES to support the City in various endeavors. Below are highlights of completed projects:\n\nTarpon River Restoration\n\nA rupture in a 54” sanitary sewer force main in the Rio Vista neighborhood caused significant raw sewage and sediment-laden sewage discharges into the Tarpon River. This event threatened the river’s Class III water status, which supports fish consumption, recreation, and a healthy aquatic ecosystem.\n\nUpon engaging RES, the City initiated a comprehensive assessment and restoration plan. RES utilized vibracore technology to extract sediment cores for visual characterization and analysis, pinpointing areas of contamination. Additionally, a benthic survey employing a “go-pro” camera documented the river bottom and assessed submerged vegetation.\n\nWith the USACE, FDEP, and Broward County, RES facilitated streamlined permitting processes to expedite restoration efforts. Regular updates were provided to the City and residents to ensure transparency. RES also assisted in the procurement process and selection of restoration contractors.\n\nFollowing meticulous restoration work and compliance inspections, the project is now successfully concluded, safeguarding the ecological integrity of the Tarpon River and its surrounding community.\n\nBonnet House Greenway Access\n\nThe City enlisted RES to conduct an environmental assessment for a proposed greenway from Birch State Park, through Bonnet House Museum and Gardens, to North Birch Road. Key objectives included creating connectivity from Sunrise Boulevard to the island community south of Bonnet House, integrating users into the mangrove forest experience, maintaining distance from Bonnet House activities, and preserving parking and landscaping.\n\nThe evaluation aimed to support a grant application under the National Park Service Rivers, Trails, and Conservation Assistance Program. RES was tasked with finding ways to minimize environmental impacts while designing the greenway.\n\nRES proposed an alternative layout that would reduce impacts on mangroves by shifting the greenway to disturbed upland areas in the southern section. This adjustment would also lessen impacts on landscape trees and preserve parking areas at Bonnet House. Additionally, design features like elevated boardwalks and permeable pavement were suggested to mitigate environmental impacts further.\n\nIsle of Palms Seawall 15 Replacement and Climate Change Adaptation\n\nRES provided critical support to the City to replace 900 feet of seawall along the west side of Isle of Palms Drive. Rising sea levels have led to overtopping of the existing seawall, causing flooding on adjacent land and roads. The project’s primary goal is to elevate the seawall to mitigate the impacts of climate change and protect the shoreline.\n\nThe City enlisted RES to conduct a comprehensive benthic survey to inform the design and permitting process. This involved identifying seagrasses and gathering data on their size, density, incidental species, and substrate conditions. RES worked closely with design engineers to secure regulatory permits and provided input to streamline the construction procurement process on behalf of the City.\n\nRES delivered the survey report ahead of schedule and under budget, demonstrating efficiency and expertise. After construction completion, RES conducted a post-construction survey to fulfill environmental permit requirements and ensure regulatory compliance.\n\nNational Environmental Policy Act Statutory Worksheets\n\nThe City actively pursues Community Development Block Grants from HUD to enhance neighborhood living standards. RES plays a crucial role by conducting environmental reviews and preparing NEPA Statutory Worksheets for various projects falling under categorical exclusions, such as decorative street name posts, entryway monuments, brick paver crosswalks, decorative lighting, and landscaping.\n\nThis process entails close coordination with environmental regulatory agencies, including the State Historic Preservation Office, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The Statutory Worksheet includes a Determination section with three options. If the project doesn’t necessitate mitigation for statutory compliance or formal permits, it qualifies for Exempt status.\n\nUpon assessing the proposed property usage changes, it was determined that the project warranted a higher level of review as a Categorical Exclusion. RES has successfully prepared these Statutory Worksheets for numerous projects across the City, ensuring compliance and smooth progression of neighborhood enhancement initiatives.\n\nNPDES Permitting Support\n\nRES assisted the City in preparing its TMDL Prioritization Plan and Assessment Program, fulfilling Year 1 requirements of their NPDES MS4 permit. In Year 2, RES began pollutant load analysis and reviewed monitoring data to assess stormwater system improvements’ impact and ensure permit compliance. Additionally, RES is currently working on the City’s BPCP, collaborating with stakeholders for effective reporting and cost savings, scheduled for submission with the Year 3 annual report. Ongoing NPDES support, including annual reports and SOP reviews, is also provided by RES to ensure compliance with permit requirements.\n\nOther projects performed under this contract include:\n\nFort Lauderdale Executive Airport Endangered Species Surveys, Permitting and Relocation\n\nFormer Transfer Station\n\nLas Olas Circle Site Assessment\n\nSistrunk Boulevard\n\nFire Station #49 Emergency Response\n\nOpinion of Post Closure Costs, Wingate Landfill\n\nWingate Landfill Burrowing Owl Relocation\n\nFXE Proposed U.S. Customs and Border Protection Facility\n\nPhase I/II Environmental Site Assessments\n\nFXE Fuel Spill Regulatory Assistance\n\nFort Lauderdale Low-Level Bridges\n\nFire Station #46\n\nHUD Environmental Documentation and Area-wide Floodplain Management Eight-Step Decision-Making Process\n\nBenthic Surveys for Sylvan Lake Canal and Seminole River Canal\n\nSouth Middle River Improvement Environmental Evaluation\n\nGrace Community Development Environmental Assessment\n\nStatutory Worksheet – Community Redevelopment Agency Resurfacing Projects\n\nThe goal of this Permittee Responsible Mitigation (PRM) project was to provide off-site compensation for unavoidable project-related impacts to both streams and wetlands resulting from the construction of a proposed petrochemicals complex project (Complex Project). The Complex Project is within the Upper Ohio Watershed (HUC 05030101) and under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Pittsburgh District.\n\nThe mitigation activities associated with the PRM Site were performed along three headwater tributaries of South Fork Cross Creek at RES’ Cross Creek Restoration Site. The tributaries were designated as high-quality warm water fisheries (HQ-WWF) (PADEP, 2014). Successful execution of the PRM resulted in restoring and enhancing the functions and values of the sites’ streams, wetlands, and riparian corridors.\n\nThe site’s restoration efforts utilized a combination of channel relocation, instream enhancement, floodplain restoration, and riparian corridor enhancement. Restoring the channel pattern and floodplain promotes the spread of high flow storm events to a reconnected floodplain, reducing excessive shear stress values that would otherwise frequently mobilize bed substrate and cause severe bank erosion. Subsurface log and rock structures were utilized to re-establish grade control throughout the systems and improve vertical bed stability. The installed structures promote the re-establishment of bed sediment and provide improved habitats for both fish and macroinvertebrate communities. Furthermore, structural improvements have enhanced large woody debris (LWD) and fine carbon retention, providing additional food sources and unique niches that promote the establishment of unique biotic communities. The re-establishment of stream habitat and floodplain diversity has provided new, improved habitats for amphibians and re-established historic wetland plant communities. In addition, floodplain restoration efforts have improved hydrologic connectivity, water storage capacity, restoration of the streams’ hyporheic zone, and biogeochemical cycling by re-establishing the hyporheic zone.\n\nRES was awarded a Greened Acre Retrofit Program (GARP) grant to implement the Darien Crossing Regional Stormwater Retrofit (Darien Crossing) on a parcel owned by the Philadelphia Industrial Development Corporation (PIDC). The GARP program is a component of the Philadelphia Water Department’s (PWD) innovative Green City, Clean Waters Program, adopted in 2011 as Philadelphia’s plan to reduce stormwater pollution currently entering its combined sewer system through the use of green infrastructure. Darien Crossing is located within the very active stadium district in South Philadelphia, provides PWD a large-scale green stormwater project at a high-profile, highly-visible, impervious-dominated part of the City. The project provided a unique opportunity for RES to develop an innovative solution that addressed PWD’s programmatic goals while maintaining the preferred land use of PIDC and the surrounding stakeholders.\n\nUsing the space from a demolished portion of an existing warehouse, RES installed an enormous underground stormwater management basin. The basin was designed to capture and store stormwater minimizing combined sewer overflows at the PWD system.\n\nThe system was capped with new parking and landscaping, which will be used and enjoyed aesthetically by visitors to both Lincoln Financial Field and Citizens Bank Park.\n\nDesign and permitting, along with demolition for the project, was completed by the close of 2019. Construction began in January 2020. Excavation of the site was completed in phases due to the size constraints of the parcel. The SMP was installed, and the finished work (curbing/paving/landscaping) has been initiated with a projected end date of Fall 2020. Additionally, RES executed a long-term lease agreement with PIDC to operate and maintain the facility for 45 years post-construction. PIDC and other project stakeholders will benefit from significantly reduced stormwater fees after the implementation of the project.\n\nThe Forest Preserve District of DuPage County in the Chicago metro region owns more than 9,000 acres of highly urbanized, yet resource-rich forested and riparian land.\n\nIn the mid-90s, most county residents had little understanding of ecosystem health and restoration – issues that were plaguing the District. To create a plan for improving ecological conditions in 70 natural areas of the District, RES ecologists inventoried the plant communities and developed recommendations to restore healthy systems to woodlands, stream corridors, and savannas.\n\nSome were controversial at the time. Such as removing buckthorn from public park properties. (This socio-ecological issue became national news – and halted buckthorn removal and savanna restoration in the Cook County Forest Preserves for 5 years – in the late 90s before a moratorium was lifted in 2002.)\n\nDuPage County preserve management recommendations have been followed for more than 20 years now, and natural resources in the District (and beyond) are significantly, measurably improved – and awarded.\n\nThe DuPage County Natural Areas Management Program (NAMP) has been used, not only throughout the District to improve ecosystem health, but also as a guideline for ecosystem management throughout the Chicago metropolitan area.\n\nIn 2012, RES collected high-resolution aerial imagery of the Lower DuPage River to identify locations of woody invasive plants for eradication.\n\nTwenty years after field inventory for the DuPage NAMP, this new imagery is assisting the District in assessing trouble spots and continuing to lower O+M costs in high-quality natural areas.\n\nRES embarked on a comprehensive surface reclamation project for a 180-acre site previously utilized for mining copper, gold, and silver. The Flambeau Mine, subject to significant public scrutiny, necessitated meticulous planning and design for its transformation.\n\nBefore surface reclamation, the mine underwent a closure process involving backfilling with a mixture of waste rock and limestone to neutralize acidity. A naturally occurring clay layer was then applied over the neutralized waste rock, followed by the redistribution of salvaged topsoil to approximate the original contours.\n\nOur team developed meticulous surface grading and planting plans aimed at restoring native plant communities and effectively managing surface drainage. Situated along the Flambeau River, the site initially encompassed old fields and woodland patches, which were enhanced in diversity through the reclamation process.\n\nWe implemented a phased approach to planting, introducing ten native communities ranging from wetlands to upland prairie and savanna. Various live plant installation and seeding strategies were employed to accommodate the complex planting plan and high species diversity, including hydro-seeding, drilling, cyclone seeding, hand seeding, transplanting, hand plugging, and live staking.\n\nApproximately 150 acres were successfully restored to natural conditions, with an additional 30 acres reserved for the development of a light industrial park, utilizing existing infrastructure from the mine.\n\nTo manage stormwater runoff effectively, we designed a natural biofilter complex that cleansed runoff onsite and restored wetland habitat, augmenting the biodiversity of the reclaimed area. This bioengineered system, strategically positioned at the convergence points of surface drainages, ensured that rain and snowmelt runoff underwent filtration before discharge into the Flambeau River. Additionally, proactive planning facilitated the isolation of runoff from the proposed industrial park to facilitate future stormwater discharge permits.\n\nSince its restoration, the Flambeau Mine site has become a cherished public asset. Nearby schools utilize the site as an outdoor classroom, while residents of neighboring communities enjoy recreational trail systems. Through the implementation of ecological landscape design principles, we successfully transformed the closed mine site into a coveted community resource.\n\nIn 2021, the Town of Dauphin Island secured funding from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Gulf Environmental Benefit Fund (NFWFGEBF) to restore a coastal marsh habitat in Graveline Bay. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) identified the project as a priority in the Alabama Barrier Island Restoration Assessment Report in 2020. The goal of the project was to restore marsh habitat and the associated species that were lost because of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.\n\nAfter Coastal Dredging Company, Inc. dredged approximately 270,000 cubic yards of sand to create 60 acres of marsh mounds, we installed vegetative plantings to restore the ecological integrity of the marsh. Our team planted more than 87,000 marsh plants covering 60 acres. Plant species included Saltmeadow Cordgrass, Smooth Cordgrass, and Black Needlerush. 600 cubic yards of recycled oyster shell from the Alabama Coastal Foundation recycling program were placed on the northern shoreline of the restored marsh by Coastal Dredging Company, Inc.\n\nBack-barrier marsh ecosystems are important, because they provide a diverse habitat for fish and wildlife and protect island and inland habitats during coastal storm events. The completed project provides coastal resilience for the community, which includes new habitat for coastal birds, fish, shellfish, and various other wildlife native to the region. Over the next several years, the marsh plants will begin to grow and fill in the marsh mounds on site. The project will be monitored by the Dauphin Island Sea Lab for the next three years.\n\nThe living shoreline restoration project at Project GreenShores Site II in Pensacola Bay aimed to enhance shoreline habitat, mitigate erosion, and promote ecological sustainability by implementing innovative techniques. By constructing breakwaters to reduce wave energy, this project formed reef and salt marsh habitats, covering approximately 6 to 8 acres of salt marsh and 4 acres of reef along the urban shoreline of Pensacola, Florida. The restoration efforts provide critical erosion control and green armoring for this specific area while promoting the overall health of Pensacola Bay.\n\nTo complete this project, the Florida Dept. of Env. Protection tasked RES with growing and installing a substantial number of plants. Close to 152,000 plants were custom grown at RES’ Pointe-Aux-Chene nursery, meticulously nurtured to ensure their adaptation to the local saltwater conditions. The plant composition for this restoration included 112,100 salt-hardened Smooth Cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) plugs and 39,750 Black Needlerush (Juncus roemerianus) 4-inch containers. Our staff carefully selected these species for their ability to thrive in the designated areas and contribute to the restoration goals.\n\nThe installation process involved strategic placement of the plant species in their respective habitats. The Black Needlerush was installed within the high marsh mounds, situated at +2-foot NAVD to +1.25-foot NAVD, while the Smooth Cordgrass was installed in the low marsh areas, ranging from +1-foot NAVD to 0.0-feet NAVD. RES utilized specialized equipment to facilitate the vegetative installation, including an 18-foot deck-over airboat and a 30-foot Carolina Skiff. This machinery was chosen for its maneuverability and efficiency in navigating the waterways and ensuring precise planting.\n\nWithin a commendable 10-day period, RES completed the entire planting process, showcasing the efficiency and dedication of our team. To ensure proper documentation and quality control, all final plant materials were recorded using drone footage, capturing the transformed shoreline comprehensively. These records were then reviewed and approved by the project engineer, attesting to the successful implementation of the restoration project.\n\nThe living shoreline restoration project at Project GreenShores Site II is a testament to the commitment of RES and its partners to environmental preservation. It highlights the significance of collaborative efforts in creating sustainable and resilient ecosystems. The completed project will not only provide crucial shoreline protection but also foster diverse habitats, contributing to the overall health and ecological balance of Pensacola Bay.\n\nRES is providing stream restoration credits to Prince George’s County Maryland Clean Water Partnership (CWP) program. The CWP is a Public-Private Partnership formed to meet the US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Clean Water regulatory requirements. The projects delivered through this contract will be enrolled as part of Prince George’s County Bay TMDL Action Plan, with the associated nutrient reductions credited toward compliance with the Bay TMDL. To date, RES has designed four projects totaling 26,838 LF of restored channel and has completed construction on one. These four projects generate approximately 568 Impervious Acre Credits for Prince George’s County.\n\nThe first project designed and constructed under this contract was the Hillmeade Stream Restoration Project. This project restored 2,862 LF of degraded channel along Horsepen Branch and unnamed tributaries. Horsepen Branch is located in a wooded parcel surrounded by a golf course and single-family residential areas and is traversed by multiple utilities. At the terminus of the project area, Horsepen Branch drains approximately 473 acres of suburban development.\n\nTo execute this project RES performed existing site assessments and geomorphic surveys. Using this data along with Natural Channel Design philosophies and published reference data RES designed a bankfull channel that provided stable banks and frequent floodplain connectivity. Additionally, RES ensured that there were no offsite floodplain rises and performed all necessary hydrologic and hydraulic modeling. RES acquired all state, federal and local permits necessary to execute the proposed work.\n\nUpon completion of the design and permitting phases of the project, RES’ construction staff used a team of subcontractors and in-house construction crews to execute the project. Construction began in June 2020 and was substantially complete by August 2020. During construction, RES’ design staff remained an integral part of the team making frequent site visits, attending multiple site meetings, and ensuring the proper execution of the design. RES expects that the restoration work completed will deliver at least 211 lbs per year of Total Phosphorus (TP) reduction.\n\nRES partnered with the Maryland Association of Soil Conservation Districts and the Irvine Nature Center to apply for funding from the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays Trust Fund Capital Improvement Grant. The proposal was awarded funding to complete the Irvine Nature Center Stream and Wetland Restoration Project. RES managed and oversaw design, planning, and permitting services which were provided by Biohabitats. Additionally, RES provided construction, invasive control, and planting services. The project also received funding for boardwalks, observation decks and interpretive signs, all which will enhance the visitors’ experience and provide educational opportunities for those who visit the Irvine Nature Center.\n\nThe Irvine Nature Center is part of the Jones Falls Watershed. The goal of the project was to transform what was most recently drained agricultural land back into functional wetlands supported by restored streams. RES performed restoration services to 1,381 LF of its waterways and created 60.6 acres of wetlands on the Irvine Nature Center premises. The project was constructed in four phases.\n\nIn the Eastern Phase RES installed one wetland and restored 594 LF of stream.\n\nIn the Northern Phase RES installed three wetlands and restored 419 LF of stream.\n\nIn the Western Phase RES restored 434 LF of stream.\n\nIn the Central Phase RES installed one wetland and restored 34 LF of stream.\n\nA series of mulch access roads were installed to allow access to each of the phases and were dismantled upon completion. Erosion and Sediments Controls consisted of hardwood matting, temporary bridges, filter log, silt fence, and super silt fence. Pump around systems were installed, as needed, and dismantled per the plans with each phase. Three boulder grade control structures, two downed log structures, 273 LF of riffle, 100 LF of floodplain riffle, and 77 LF of cascade were installed. RES installed approximately 2,000 LF of berm which aided in the creation of the 60.6 acres of wetland. The site was stabilized with hardwood mulch and coir matting.\n\nRES and Biohabitats were committed to implementing creative and environmentally friendly practices throughout this project. To minimize the import of outside materials, dirt generated from the grading efforts of the wetlands was utilized to construct the berms. The berms themselves serve twofold, aiding in the wetland creation while also adding to the Nature Center’s already extensive network of trail systems. RES was allowed to incorporate any cleared trees into the pools of the wetlands to serve as habitat structures. Wood chips that were brought into the site for the mulch access roads were dismantled and reused as the required sediment control to cover all disturbed and graded areas. Planting of the site was completed in Fall 2017 and consisted of 2,183 trees and shrubs.\n\nStorm Water Solution Magazine “Top-Ten Stormwater & Erosion Control Projects for 2013″\n\nThe Jack Smith Creek Stormwater Wetlands (JSCSW) project was a partnership between the City of New Bern, North Carolina State University (NCSU), North Carolina Ecosystem Enhancement Program (NCEEP), and the North Carolina Clean Water Management Trust Fund. RES (formerly Carolina Environmental Contracting prior to 2020 acquisition by RES) was selected to construct a stormwater wetland that currently captures and treats runoff from more than 1,000 acres of both residential and commercial properties in New Bern. This project was significant due to not only the volume of stormwater that it can now accommodate but because it is the largest manmade wetland constructed in the state of North Carolina.\n\nThe design of the JSCSW incorporated a multi-cell treatment approach that moves the water through various cells, adjustable weirs and culverts to maximize water quality improvements as these best management practices (BMPs) remove contaminants while the stormwater travels through the various systems. Each cell was constructed differently to maintain various depths and velocities. These differences among the cells will maximize the diversity in the wetland community to encourage a varied habitat for the better long-term viability of both flora and fauna.\n\nThe project consisted of 25 acres of constructed wetlands, more than 10 acres of preserved wetlands, and 2.3 acres of enhanced wetlands. Over 7,000 of the stream was incorporated into the wetland cells. Work included clearing, grubbing, and grading the wetlands. Nine culverts were installed, three with flap gates. Two concrete water control systems, one vinyl sheet pile weir, rock spreaders, and inlet and outlet pools were included in the design to maintain grade control. A permanent maintenance road was constructed and a pump berm was incorporated in the design to assist with the magnitude of high stormwater flow.\n\nOver 150,000 native wetland plants, trees and shrubs were planted upon completion of construction that will act as filtering components and also will provide extensive habitat for fish and wildlife.\n\nThis large-scale project was the first of its kind in the state due to the unique nature of the project, the partnership with NCSU and NCEEP, the management of the project, the high visibility of the project due to its innovation, and the large quantity of clearing and grading.\n\nFor more than 20 years, RES provided expert consulting and restoration services to the Jackson County Iron Mine. RES services ranged from permitting to construction of the restoration design, annual maintenance of restored ecosystems and compliance monitoring.\n\nRES assisted in the permitting of an open pit taconite mine that was planned to create a pit nearly one mile long, one-third of a mile wide, and more than 350 feet in depth, centered in Black River Falls State Forest. The project moved toward its ultimate reclamation phase, which commenced long before the mine’s closure.\n\nThe ecologically focused restoration plan provided detailed and comprehensive phasing for restoration activities, accommodating ongoing mining activities and the continuing generation of mine wastes. In the early phases of reclamation, RES saw the need for on-site research and developed a native seed nursery on the mine site to propagate local genetic seed stock of native grasses and forbs.\n\nUsing this seed source, RES directly seeded a 312-acre tailings basin to create a dry prairie community. Nearly 620 acres of waste-rock dumps were configured and hydro-seeded with native seed stock. Following, the mine’s 43-acre rail yard and processing plant were removed and covered with native sandy soils and restored to prairie.\n\nTo stabilize mine wastes and reduce contaminant dispersal, RES used deep-rooted prairie vegetation, which significantly reduced internal leaching and the potential for groundwater contamination.\n\nRestoration techniques encouraged the natural incursion of native plants and wildlife from the surrounding rare plant community known as pine/oak barrens. Because the adjacent state forest encompasses one of the larger Wisconsin populations of the federally endangered Karner Blue Butterfly, RES designed and constructed habitat restoration for this rare species.\n\nNow, a new county park occupies the former mine site. With a 350-foot deep lake, a swimming beach, and an extensive trail system, Lake Wazee has become a vacation destination and a top-rated scuba diving lake.\n\nIn all, RES restored 1,340 acres to native prairie and pine/oak barrens, which at the time made it the most extensive restoration in Wisconsin, among the largest mine reclamation projects of its kind in the U.S., and a national model of successful reclamation.\n\nLockport Prairie Nature Preserve (Lockport, IL) and Prairie Bluff Nature Preserve (Crest Hill, IL) contain a rare ecosystem, a wet-mesic dolomite prairie. This habitat is critical to the survival of the federally endangered Hine’s Emerald Dragonfly (HED). When our team arrived on site, areas of invasive species were causing disruptions in groundwater and the functionality of aquatic ecosystems. The floristic quality of the prairie had been in steady decline for years, which impacted HED habitat.\n\nRES, the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), and Will County Forest Preserve District (WCFPD) took a collaborative approach to planning the installation. We worked together to determine the appropriate ratio and diversity of seed, plugs, and trees at each site to ensure a successful project.\n\nOur team performed invasive species control through selective tree/shrub removal, hand pulling, prescribed burning, mowing, and herbicide applications. Due to the sensitivity of the site and the potential impact on the HED, there was no use of mechanical equipment at Lockport Prairie. In addition to completing the majority of the work by hand, 35 acres of cattails were treated via a wicking application. We used this technique to prevent damage to native herbaceous understory and avoid contamination of the water that flows through the HED habitat.\n\nWe collected seed at Lockport Prairie which we grew into plugs and then installed on site to preserve the local genetics in areas that did not regenerate with native cover. In order to promote the connectivity of Lockport Prairie and Prairie Bluff, we disabled agricultural drain tiles throughout the site to restore the natural hydrology. The restoration of the hydrology will promote infiltration which will discharge at the base of the bluff at Lockport Prairie.\n\nThis project, which was completed in 2024 provides unique recreational opportunities for the residents of Will County.\n\nMammoth North Solar is the first phase of the Mammoth Solar project, one of the largest solar projects in the United States. Mammoth Solar North is estimated to generate 400-megawatt (MW) of energy and provide enough clean energy for 75,0000 households.\n\nIn 2020, RES was contracted by Doral Renewables to develop a Vegetation and Soil Management Plan (VSMP) and a Landscape Screening Assessment. These were designed to meet local pollinator-friendly requirements and comply with Pulaski and Starke Counties’ vegetation requirements and the Project’s Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP).\n\nOur experts conducted a thorough desktop review of the site and performed an on-site investigation to inform the VSMP. This included recommendations on soil preparation, seed mixes, arrangement, and soil management techniques. Local ordinances required that the facility be screened from viewsheds while enhancing biodiversity, wildlife foraging, and habitat. To meet these requirements, we provided a Landscape Screening Assessment that included a design mix of tree and shrub species including native trees, shrubs, and a tallgrass prairie planting.\n\nThe VSMP provided Doral Renewables and SOLV Energy, the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) Contractor, with expert guidance on establishing and maintaining native, pollinator-friendly vegetation for a large-scale solar facility. The vegetation installed will resist invasive species, prevent erosion, reduce flooding, and maintain growing heights that will avoid shading the solar arrays—significantly reducing project costs over time. The inclusion of pollinator species will also generate key benefits for endangered species and fulfill a crucial habitat need.\n\nIn 2021, our team conducted preconstruction temporary- and permanent-seed installation on approximately 2,225 acres. Seeding in advance of the construction has enabled the early establishment of perennial species. These species helped to stabilize the soil during construction and provided the foundation for the long-term vegetative community under the solar arrays after construction. We worked directly with SOLV Energy to install and manage vegetation during construction. Since the installation, our team has paid close attention to managing stormwater and erosion in the areas installed with perennial vegetation.\n\nIn 2023, RES contracted directly with the owner, Doral Renewables, to install nearly 13 miles of landscape screening on site. To accomplish this, we utilized more than 4,000 trees and shrubs and 150 acres of pollinator habitat seed mix. Nearly half of the trees and shrubs were grown in-house at one of RES’ nurseries.\n\nLivestock Grazing\n\nRES partnered with subcontractor, Bope Farm Services, LLC, to manage grazing activities on site. A mixture of sheep, llamas, donkeys, and livestock guardians manage the site. The sheep manage the grass while the llamas, donkeys, and livestock guardians protect the sheep from ground and aerial predators. In addition to overseeing grazing, Bope Farm Services, LLC also provides mowing and herbicide services.\n\nProject Highlights\n\nThe project received the Dual Use Plan of the Year Award at the North American Agrivoltaics Awards Ceremony in 2024\n\nComprehensive vegetation planning, installation, and management of native, perennial, and pollinator habitat species on 2,225 acres\n\nContracted directly with the Owner for VSMP and Landscape Screening Assessment development, landscape screening installation and maintenance, and long-term vegetation management\n\nContracted with project EPC to install and manage vegetation during construction\n\nSWPPP-compliant project\n\nShawnee RC&D, a regional non-profit, was concerned about the impact woody invasive species (bush and Japanese honeysuckles, autumn olive, and multiflora rose) were having on the quality of natural woodlands in southern Illinois, particularly in the Shawnee National Forest.\n\nTo assist in locating and mapping these alien invaders, RES collected aerial imagery in a 100-square-mile project area using both a high-resolution, multi-spectral aerial camera and complementary geo-referenced oblique aerial photography.\n\nCollection of the imagery was completed in mid-November, strategically timed to seasonal phenology – shortly after the deciduous trees lost their leaves, but before the woody invasive shrubs had lost their foliage.\n\nProcessing of the multi-spectral imaging involved methods to ortho-rectify, color balance, mosaic, and stack imagery into four bands including red, green, blue, and near-infrared.\n\nThe near-infrared band displays the green leaves of the invasive species as the color red, which is particularly valuable for identifying the target species beneath the leaf-off forest canopy.\n\nThe imaging process was augmented by on-the-ground field inspections conducted by a RES ecologist in coordination with a GIS/remote sensing specialist. Data were used to “train” the GIS software to reliably recognize the targeted plant species on the imagery.\n\nThrough testing and ground confirmation, we determined that a spectral enhancement technique known as Normalized Vegetation Index which uses the red and near-infrared bands produced the most accurate mapping results.\n\nRefinement and calibration produced maps of very high reliability. Thus, through a least-cost process, RES was able to give agency staff highly precise maps complete with coordinates of thousands of individual plants – facilitating their eventual removal in an eradication program.\n\nBeginning in 2018, RES provided full delivery stream restoration services along Mardella Branch in Baltimore County, MD. This project is one of six that RES implemented under Maryland State Highway Administration’s Full Delivery Stream Restoration Services contract to help meet SHA’s total daily maximum load (TMDL) requirements.\n\nThe project was broken down into two distinct reaches (North and South) divided by Offutt Road and totaling 2,881 LF. This project was designed utilizing a Natural Channel Design (NCD) approach while also facilitating more frequent floodplain access during high-flow events. In addition to substantial nutrient pollution reduction, the Mardella Branch restoration generated co-benefits including greater floodplain reconnection, wetland generation, and habitat and biodiversity recruitment post-construction. RES’ responsibility included site selection and coordination with private landowners, design, permitting, construction, and long-term monitoring.\n\nDuring construction RES utilized mulch and deckmat access roads to limit overall ground disturbance and over compaction of subsoils. Having been involved in the site development allowed for a high-use of site-generated materials; all of the trees that were removed for construction were utilized in the creation of stream structures and additional access paths, and the existing streambed material was utilized in the stream pool and riffle areas. Instream structures and features that were implemented included imbricated toe protection, log sills, log drops, toe wood, live lifts, riffle and pool combinations, and the creation of oxbow wetland within portions of the abandoned stream channel.\n\nThe Mardella Branch watershed continues to be rapidly developing with yearly increases in the overall impervious area upstream of this site; the implementation of the RES approach will result in the reduction of 392 pounds of phosphorus, 851 pounds of nitrogen, and 68 pounds of sediment per year for this watershed.\n\nThis project required close coordination with several interested project participants and entities including the property owners, SHA, Baltimore County, Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE), the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), and various subcontractors and suppliers. As this stream has a Use III designation and closure period from October 1 through April 30, RES’ coordination and logistics among the project participants allowed for successful and on-time delivery.\n\nThis Permittee-Responsible Mitigation (PRM) project was designed to mitigate for a new pipeline with unavoidable impacts to 450 acres of wetlands in Eastern Louisiana, within a Wildlife Management Area managed by Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries. Restoration of the PRM tracts, contained entirely within the Maurepas Swamp, was coordinated to support proposed freshwater introductions sponsored by various state and federal agencies.\n\nThe Maurepas Swamp has been in a steady state of decline since the 1920’s and 1930’s when most of the area was heavily logged for cypress timber. The implementation of diversions and facilitated drainage had increased stagnation of the swamp areas within the Lake Maurepas basin. The lack of freshwater inflow over time has gradually decreased the nutrient load and hampered the growth of forested habitats.\n\nThe PRM project sites are in areas that were historically composed of primarily old growth cypress-tupelo swamps with some hardwood component on the ridges of the interior. Restoration and preservation under the PRM covered enhancing 485 acres of bottomland hardwood habitat and 67 acres of cypress/tupelo swamp, and rehabilitating 85 acres of cypress/tupelo swamp. These activities were coordinated with a number of stakeholders, including the ESACE New Orleans District and Louisiana Department of Natural Resources Office of Coastal Management, to best support the landscape-scape restoration goals for the swamp, and included a donation of land by RES of 7,039 acres of forested wetlands to Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries for inclusion within the Maurepas Swamp Wildlife Management Area.\n\nRES was selected as subcontractor to Shooter and Lindsey, Inc. to aid in a portion of the reclamation and restoration of 100 acres of previously inaccessible and ecologically distressed parkland as part of the Eastern Glades project at Memorial Park.\n\nOur team planted more than 50,000 aquatic plants, comprised of more than 20 different native species, in the shallow areas of the five-acre Hines Lake near the boardwalks. These native aquatic species support 1.5 acres of emergent wetlands. The species planted in Hines Lake were specifically chosen due to the numerous benefits they provide this ecosystem. The fruit of these plants provides food for waterfowl and other bird species, while the flowers attract bees and other insects, such as dragonflies. These plants also provide aquatic habitat that helps promote and sustain wildlife, including frogs, ducks, and fish. In addition to the numerous benefits to the biota of the area, these plants also play an integral role in stormwater management, cleaning the stormwater that flows through the Lake on its way to Memorial Park’s largest tributary, Buffalo Bayou. For example, Pickerelweed has a dense, mat-like root system that can trap and hold sediment in place and withstand heavy flooding, helping to prevent erosion. Other species planted within Hines Lake, include, but are not limited to, Arrow Arum, Smooth Rush, Softstem Bulrush, Powdery Flag Thalia, Watershied, and Maidencane.\n\nIn addition to planting native aquatic plants, our experienced crew, led by a certified herbicide applicator, performed invasive management via herbicide application to ensure that native plants have the best chance of survival.\n\nProject Highlights\n\nPlanted over 50,000 aquatic plants in the shallow areas of the 5-acre Hines Lake and near the boardwalks, creating 1.5 acres of emergent wetland\n\nInstalled 20 different native wetland species\n\nProvides stormwater management and aquatic habitat for local biota\n\nManaged invasive species via herbicide application\n\nThe Minnesota Zoological Garden (the Zoo) hired RES to provide an ecological restoration and management plan (RMP) to use as a tool for improving and preserving ecological health of their lands and waters. We worked closely with Zoo staff to develop a stewardship vision and goals, focus the plan on improving biodiversity and ecosystem health, and integrate the restoration work into the visitor experience. The resulting long-range RMP, which Minnesota’s Clean Water, Land, and Legacy Amendment supported with funds, includes a natural resource inventory to document the current state of plant communities and animal habitats, revisions to land cover mapping, development of management units and restoration tasks, and a budget for implementation.\n\nIn developing the plan, we divided the Zoo’s 485 acres into three areas: outdoor exhibits, the built environment, and the 282-acre natural area. The Zoo’s vision for its natural environment is to establish the full spectrum of habitats indigenous to the region, from oak forest to oak savanna and prairie, and various wetland communities. Within the natural area, there are 16 different land cover types, representing plant and open water communities. Unusual wetland habitats are present: vernal pools and northern rich fen. Preserving and increasing the diversity, functionality and beauty of these rare wetlands and other critical natural resources is a critical goal of the RMP.\n\nThe RMP also provides instructions for adaptive, long-term management. This includes annual ecological monitoring reports to document and assess restoration progress and provide specific recommendations for subsequent management efforts.\n\nWith incorporation of the RMP, the Minnesota Zoo can use its extensive wild spaces as living exhibits to demonstrate land stewardship. The plan will make the Minnesota Zoo a showcase for ecological restoration and contribute to the conservation of native Minnesota plant and wildlife communities. The plan serves as a guide for citizen science endeavors and as an educational backdrop for the School of Environmental Studies.\n\nThe Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) provided a Project Development and Environment (PD&E) Study to evaluate improvement alternatives for the NASA Causeway Bridge. The existing bascule bridge is approximately 54 years old and consists of two separate structures approximately 2,993 feet long, accommodating eastbound and westbound traffic. The bridge is currently the only passage for space freight moving between the processing facilities in Titusville and the Kenedy Space Center/Cape Canaveral Space Force Station launch pad. The bridge has failed safety inspections, and a key concern with the space freight is the carrying capacity of the bridge, as well as the horizontal and vertical navigational clearances, which are pivotal to the transportation of oversized freight, at times exceeding 40-60 feet in height above mean high water. The PD&E Study produced the required engineering, environmental, and National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) documentation and clearances to proceed to the Design Phase. The PD&E and Design Phases were overlapped to condense the overall project construction schedule to address safety/functional concerns.\n\nRES’ staff conducted field evaluations, including seagrass/benthic surveys, collected and analyzed data for wetlands, protected species, and essential fish habitat, and prepared a Natural Resource Evaluation Report documenting potential impacts with each of the project alternatives. Work also included participation in public meetings and hearings. Both phases of the project required close coordination with NASA and federal and state regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Coast Guard, the National Marine Fisheries Service, and the St. Johns River Water Management District.\n\nHighlights\n\nAgency coordination included SJRWMD, FDEP, USFWS, USCG, NMFS, NASA, and Space Florida. ​\n\nSeagrass surveys and evaluation of Essential Fish Habitat. ​\n\nWorked with design engineers to prioritize avoidance and minimization of seagrass impacts.​\n\nCoordinated with NASA, SJRWMD, and NMFS to negotiate using an offsite mitigation project and excess water quality treatment to offset secondary impacts to seagrass habitat and wetland impacts.\n\nRES is developing the proposed the Newark Slough Wetland Mitigation Bank (Bank) on approximately 65.4 acres of property along the San Francisco Bay in Newark, Alameda County, California. This former tidal marsh habitat was manipulated for the production of salt, with the native soil and restorable connection to tidal hydrology still intact. As a result, RES believes the property offers a great opportunity to restore tidal wetlands and endangered species habitat consistent with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Tidal Marsh Recovery Plan and other regional plans covering the San Francisco Bay shoreline.\n\nThe Bank is proposed to provide mitigation for including tidal wetlands under Section 404/401 of the Clean Water Act as well as the State’s Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act. In addition, the Bank will offer conservation credits for saltmarsh harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys raviventris), and Ridgway’s rail (Rallus obsoletus) (formerly known as the California clapper rail, and Rallus longirostris obsoletus). The Bank is currently being reviewed by the Interagency Review Team (IRT) members, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB), and USFWS.\n\nRestoration of the Bank property will rehabilitate the former mosaic of tidal wetlands, mudflats, and previously existing channels. Wetland functions such as short-term storage of water, energy dissipation, moderation of groundwater discharge, nutrient cycling, organic matter export, retention of particulates, removal of elements/compounds, and maintenance of plant and animal communities will be restored as a result of the project. The rehabilitation of the Bank property will also improve the connection to adjacent existing tidal marsh habitats and improve the ability for sensitive wildlife species to travel between natural landscape blocks along the San Francisco Bay shoreline.\n\nAvailable Credit Types\n\nDownload service area maps and KMZ files below:\n\nSaltmarsh harvest mouse | KMZ\n\nRidgway’s rail | KMZ\n\nTidal marsh and non-wetland waters | Tidal marsh KMZ | Non-wetland waters KMZ\n\nThe Nookachamps Wetland Mitigation Bank (“Bank”) is a 282-acre site along the Skagit River in Skagit County, Washington. Many of the historic forest and wetland habitats in the Skagit River floodplain had been replaced with agricultural uses. As a result, off-channel sloughs, floodplain wetland, and riparian habitats were limited and severely degraded along most of the lower Skagit River.\n\nThe main ecological goal of the Bank is to enhance and restore these much-needed habitat types within the Skagit River system and re-establish the critical functions of wetlands and riparian habitats within the historic floodplain. Before the restoration activities, the Bank site was actively farmed in row crops, was hydrologically disconnected from the Skagit River, and provided limited wildlife habitat and wetland functions.\n\nThe Bank now consists of a mosaic of 241 acres of re-established floodplain wetlands, floodplain forest, open water channels, and riparian habitats. Historic habitats, hydrologic regimes, and connectivity to the river have been restored through grading, the planting of native vegetation, and the installation of habitat features such as woody debris. The restoration activities at the Bank have successfully enhanced degraded habitats within the Skagit River Basin, resulting in improvements to critical water quality and hydrologic functions. The Bank is also within critical habitat for Puget Sound Chinook salmon and bull trout, thus providing important off-channel rearing habitat for Skagit River salmonids.\n\nThe implementation of the Bank was developed in coordination and partnership with federal, state, local, and tribal entities. An Interagency Review Team approved the mitigation bank comprised of representatives from EPA, USACE, the Washington State Department of Ecology, and the Skagit River System Cooperative representing the Sauk Suiattle Indian Tribe and the Swinomish Indian Community.\n\nProject Highlights\n\nWithin Water Resource Inventory Area (WRIA) 3\n\nProvides habitat for Puget Sound Chinook Salmon and Bull Trout (no salmonid conservation credits at this time)\n\nRestored habitats include channel/palustrine emergent (PEM) wetlands, palustrine scrub-shrub (PSS) wetlands, palustrine forest (PFO) wetlands and riparian floodplain forest habitat Delete riparian floodplain forest, channels, and floodplain wetland\n\nService Area\n\nThe wetland credit service area extends within Water Resources Inventory Area 03 (WRIA 03), located in the Lower Skagit River Basin, but is not all-encompassing, as shown in the service area map (link below).\n\nBuffer mitigation may be used within Skagit County as approved on a case-by-case basis.\n\nApproving Agencies\n\nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers\n\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency\n\nWashington Department of Ecology\n\nCity of Mount Vernon\n\nSkagit County\n\nSkagit River System Cooperative\n\nAvailable Credit Types\n\nDownload service area maps and KMZ files below:\n\nWetlands | KMZ\n\nRES was retained by the Columbia Land Conservancy and AKRF to perform a Natural Resource Inventory (NRI) and Program Suitability Plan (PSP) for the future North Bay Recreation Area in Hudson, New York. The Columbia Land Conservancy, working with and on behalf of the City of Hudson and in partnership with Columbia County, requested a conceptual master plan for the site to include passive recreational trails, restored and protected areas of habitat, picnic areas, an outdoor events space, a kayak/canoe launch in the North Bay, a possible outdoor sculpture space, and a boardwalk and viewing platform.\n\nSituated along the Hudson River, the site includes an existing 20-acre capped landfill, approximately 120 acres of surrounding land with brownfield industrial remnants, and significant habitat. The site contains a Class 1 stream-fed freshwater marsh, which is affected by the tidal influxes of the Hudson River and is part of the larger Stockport Creek and Flats area, which has been deemed by the State of New York as a significant coastal fish and wildlife habitat. The Stockport Creek and Flats Habitat provides irreplaceable spawning areas for fish and critical nesting and feeding areas for waterfowl during seasonal migrations.\n\nFrom the NRI of the North Bay site, RES created a series of overlay maps. The overlay maps graphically represented the findings from the NRI and were compared and weighed against the master plan program goals and were communicated visually through a Program Suitability Plan (PSP). The PSP formed the foundation from which the master plan was derived by classifying different zones of the site from most to least suitable areas for development. The PSP also identified potential areas of habitat restoration while exploring opportunities for making larger physical and symbolic regional connections to the adjacent Greenport Conservation Area, The Hudson River Valley, The Catskill Mountains, and surrounding neighborhoods, schools, and parks within the City of Hudson.\n\nNorth Bay Village (NBV), an island community, is developing a new Civic Park, which is funded by two grants, the first from Florida Inland Navigation District (FIND) and the second from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) Land and Water Conservation Fund (L&WCF) grant, totaling over $900,000. RES was assigned to the project by an NBV Commissioner, due to our experience with living shorelines and Biscayne Bay permitting regulations.\n\nRES is responsible for environmental site analysis, engineering, and permitting of this unique living shoreline and public waterway access project. To expedite permitting, RES performed a benthic survey under an initial task order before project design authorization, which mapped the locations and quality of seagrasses, corals, and benthic resources in the project area. RES worked with the multi-disciplinary project team, including landscape architects, civil/structural/coastal/environmental/electrical engineers, planners, scientists, stakeholders, and university advisors to develop a hybrid living shoreline plan that avoided all seagrass resources and minimized the project footprint to expedite permitting of in-water features. The grants require the project to include a non-motorized boating dock for public access, a picnic area with a pavilion, a nature trail with signage, lighting, landscaping, and a bike rack. Replacement of the existing seawall and a children’s splash pad were additions to the project during project implementation and approved by the Village Commission.\n\nThe living shoreline is designed to be resilient to meet the Village’s new seawall code, which requires adaptation to sea level rise and includes structural stabilization for this island community, which currently consists entirely of seawall/bulkheads at the waterfront edge. Innovative design elements such as the living seawall panels/cap fascia with ecological concrete and textured biophilic face were developed during the project design by RES, the coastal and structural engineers, ecological concrete manufacturers, Village staff, as well as an advisory team from University of Miami Civil Engineering department. Environmental permitting is the critical pathway for the construction of the living shoreline and ADA-accessible floating kayak dock. RES has worked with the project design team to streamline the design and permitting timeline to meet grant requirements. The living shoreline design is prepared to self-mitigate to environmental resources, subject to agency approval.\n\nConstruction is planned for late 2024.\n\nRecipient of a 2017 Bubba Award for Best Stream Restoration, presented by the Chesapeake Stormwater Network\n\nIn 2012, Anne Arundel County Department of Public Works (DPW) contracted RES’ Angler Construction division to restore approximately 3,000 linear feet of main-stem stream, 900 linear feet of tributary drainages and seven acres of wetlands on the North Branch of Cypress Creek. The restoration utilized many techniques to manage the stormwater discharge in the main channel and its tributaries while creating floodplain wetlands that transition to tidal waters and removing significant pollutant load from the upstream impervious area.\n\nThe project design created an open water and shallow wetland feature to attenuate stormwater flows and reduce peak discharges through the system. Additionally, regenerative stormwater conveyances were installed to convey flow from road-based culverts. The main channel was restored to flow out of the headwater wetland into a single thread channel that conveys flow through rock and log step pools into an anastomosed or DA-type channel, which is a stream with multiple channels and islands. The middle reaches along the North Branch were excavated and filled to create floodplain wetlands. Old dam embankments were lowered, repaired, and graded to impound shallow water in the wetlands. The transition from the floodplain wetlands to the tidal channel section was reconstructed as an E-type channel to provide a gradual riffle that reconnected the tidal channel to its floodplain. This riffle allows for fish passage from the tidal area into the floodplain wetland impoundments and as far upstream as the headwater wetland.\n\nStructures installed by RES included:\n\nFifteen cobble weirs\n\nFifteen sandstone outfalls\n\nSix floodplain grade control structures (cobble/sandstone mix)\n\nFour log grade control structures\n\nNine boulder cobble cascades\n\nSix log/ boulder step-pools\n\nOver 25,000 native plants added to the habitat creation throughout the project site. A diversity of plant species was used to create both upland and wetland habitat.\n\nRES was awarded the Paxton Creek Sediment Reduction MS4 project by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) in the summer of 2020. This project marked the second time PennDOT procured sediment reduction for MS4 compliance through a turnkey, performance-based contract known as ‘design-build-operate-maintain.’ RES guaranteed the turnkey delivery of over 800,000 pounds of sediment reduction, the equivalent of 5,400 linear feet of stream and five acres of wetland restoration.\n\nIn a unique approach, PennDOT collaborated with three municipal partners, Capital Region Water, Susquehanna Township, and Lower Paxton Township, to implement Best Management Practices (BMPs) to generate sediment reduction benefits for all parties involved. RES was responsible for siting, designing, permitting, acquiring property interests, constructing, inspecting, operating, and maintaining the BMPs within the project scope. The ultimate goal was to demonstrate improved water quality in urbanized area sediment-impaired waterways within the Paxton Creek watershed.\n\nRES obtained the rights to implement three separate projects within the search area, strategically selecting the most cost-effective locations. The selection process considered the portion of the Paxton Creek watershed covered by the three municipal partners. To ensure adherence to established standards, RES was required to prepare a pollutant reduction plan and calculate sediment reduction using the Chesapeake Bay Protocol, a framework based on an expert panel.\n\nThrough this collaborative effort between RES, PennDOT, and the three municipal partners, the Paxton Creek Sediment Reduction MS4 project aims to significantly reduce sediment pollution within the watershed, improving water quality and meeting regulatory compliance requirements.\n\n“My office actually looks out over a little gully here, and when it would rain, it would be a chocolate milk log flume. 810 feet deep of just ripping, I mean, absolutely ripping water. Now [post restoration] when it rains, it’s this wonderful meandering clear stream. I mean, it worked literally, like overnight,”\n\nTim Schaeffer, Executive Director of the Fish and Boat Commission\n\nThe Pennsylvania Statewide Bat Conservation Bank is the first U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS)-approved species Conservation Bank of its kind in Pennsylvania. Over the course of three years, RES collaborated with the USFWS Pennsylvania field office to select a site, develop a crediting methodology, and finalize the first endangered species conservation banking instrument in the State. The purpose of the Pennsylvania Statewide Bat Conservation Bank (Bank) is to provide and protect high-quality self-sustaining bat habitat to offset statewide impacts to the federally listed Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis) and its habitat. This objective supports the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (87 Stat. 884, as amended; 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), which was enacted to ensure the protection of endangered species such as the Indiana bat. This objective is also consistent with the policies described in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Mitigation Policy (46 FR 7644-7663, January 23, 1981) and Guidance for the Establishment, Use, and Operation of Conservation Banks (68 FR 24753, May 8, 2003). Conservation banking creates a collaborative incentive-based approach where habitat for listed species is treated as an asset rather than a liability.\n\nBy permanently protecting high-quality forested habitat in a critical Indiana bat habitat zone, the Pennsylvania Statewide Bat Conservation Bank provides an advance compensatory mitigation mechanism to support the Endangered Species Act and the relevant federal mitigation initiatives. The Bank is located within the known range of the Indiana bat and includes more than 438 contiguous acres of high-quality habitat used by two Indiana bat maternity colonies. Although Indiana bats have experienced significant population declines due to a malady known as white-nose syndrome, the Indiana bat maternity areas in Washington and Greene Counties persist. The maternity area includes three partially conjoined maternity colonies consisting of primary and alternate roost trees and the surrounding 2.5-3-mile foraging habitat (USFWS 2016).\n\nIn addition to providing extremely high-quality bat habitat, the Pennsylvania Statewide Bat Conservation Bank site abuts two known Biodiversity areas identified by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and hosts the Mixed-Mesophysic Forest Target Plant Community, an extremely rich terrestrial community type on deep soils in protected concave coves or lower slopes only in Greene County, PA. The Site also includes the known range of one endangered plant Nuttall’s Hedge-nettle (Stachys cordata) and special concern plant species Single-headed Pussy-toes (Antennaria solitaria), American Beakgrain (Diarrhena americana), and Leaf-cup (Smallanthus uvedalius).\n\nThe Pleasant Point Living Shoreline Project in Norfolk protects adjacent properties, reduces erosion, and filters pollutants from the water.\n\nWith the primary focus on the eastern branch of the Elizabeth River, where the shoreline was quickly eroding, the project’s goal was to restore the natural wetland system by providing a nature-based solution to repair and protect the shoreline.\n\nThe project involved the installation of 370 linear feet of stone sills, sand backfill, 12 linear feet of 24″ RCP pipe, a new endwall, and planting trees, shrubs, and grasses.\n\nAs a result of this project, 270 linear feet of shoreline were protected, 185 linear feet of shoreline were restored, and 0.14 acres of created tidal wetlands were established. These restored wetlands will provide aquatic animals and plants with habitat, ultimately improving the local ecosystem’s health.\n\nHowever, the project had its challenges. Working almost entirely in the water and around the tide schedule with minimal stockpile area posed significant logistical challenges for the crew. Additionally, the work was performed along a highly traveled residential roadway, which further complicated the project’s execution. The crew had to carefully plan material deliveries and work around the daily tide schedule. Due to the limited stockpile area, the crew staged material in the water, making the project more challenging.\n\nDespite these challenges, the Pleasant Point Living Shoreline Project was successfully completed, providing a sustainable solution to shore protection and enhancing the local ecosystem’s health.\n\nIn 2023, the project was recognized by the Heavy Construction Contractors Association (HCCA) for an Excellence in Infrastructure Award\n\nFeatured in National Geographic, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and other major outlets, Prairie Crossing is a nationally acclaimed model of conservation development. Home sites are clustered to preserve surrounding agricultural and natural area open space. To emulate functions and aesthetics of the historic landscape, RES restored over 200 acres of prairie, wetland, and agricultural hedgerow communities that had occupied the site prior to settlement.\n\nIn 1989, RES became involved in early phases of the project – focusing on planning, field studies and approvals. Ground-breaking was in 1994, and the bulk of our construction and planting activities were accomplished by 1996. Natural areas management services continue, and significant native landscape design and construction work for model homes and the Prairie Crossing Campus of Northwestern Memorial Hospital were ongoing from 2001 through 2003.\n\nOne of the main features of the native landscape at Prairie Crossing is the treatment of stormwater runoff. We designed a series of measures to reduce stormwater volumes and associated pollutant loads (nitrogen, phosphorus, sediment, road salt, etc.) through an innovative stormwater management concept. This was the first major installation of the our Stormwater Treatment Train™ (STT), a system composed of open swale stormwater conveyance, upland prairie biofiltration, wetlands, and a man-made lake. Working in combination, these methods increase opportunities for pollutant removal through biological and mechanical means while significantly reducing the rate and volume of stormwater runoff.\n\nAnother unique feature of Prairie Crossing is its working organic farm, operated by a resident farm family on-site. The Prairie Crossing Farm was one of the first parts of the community to be established and remains at its heart. Based at an old farmstead with several houses, barns, and outbuildings, the farm consists of 100 acres in organic food production.\n\nIn addition, we stabilized over 1,500 linear feet of Lake Aldo Leopold shoreline at Prairie Crossing, which has created an ideal habitat for desirable emergent aquatic vegetation that attenuates wave energy and stabilizes soils. These measures, combined with biofiltration provided by the STT, have resulted in exceptional lake water quality. Swimmers, anglers, and four Illinois state-threatened fish species enjoy the clean, clear water. Prairie Crossing has been the recipient of 14 awards for environmental restoration and planning.

The project area is comprised of a single easement located along Hauser Creek and two unnamed tributaries. The project is located between two sections of the overall 27-acre DMS Mockingbird site, and upstream of the closed out DMS UT to Hauser Creek project. The DMS Catbird site is in an adjacent catchment to the east. The streams proposed for restoration have been historically impacted by livestock production, agricultural practices, and a lack of riparian buffer.\n\nGoals for the project include an increase to hydrologic function and restoration to ecological function within the existing stream and riparian corridor and protecting these features in perpetuity. These will be accomplished by returning the existing streams to stable conditions by constructing an E/C type stream with appropriate dimensions and pattern, reconnecting Hauser Creek to the floodplain, and backfilling the abandoned channel. In-stream structures will be installed for vertical stability and to improve habitat, where necessary. Buffer improvements will filter runoff from the surrounding pasture lands. The project presents 3,144 LF of stream restoration and enhancement, generating 2,918 Warm SMUs. Construction was completed in May 2020.\n\nRES orchestrated the development of the Preserve to mitigate wetlands for the Seneca Meadows Landfill expansion. This project encompassed restoring 1,100 acres of wetlands, grasslands, and savanna. A decade of RES monitoring and maintenance will precede stewardship by the Montezuma Audubon Center.\n\nThe Preserve met IBA criteria, hosting at-risk species like Black terns, Pied-bill Grebes, American Bitterns, and wintering Short-eared Owls. Other supported species include the Common Gallinule, Wilson’s Snipe, Marsh Wren, Bobolink, Savannah Sparrow, and Northern Harrier. The sighting of Dickcissels attracted birders regionally.\n\n“Black terns have joined a growing list of species considered ‘vulnerable’ that have been sighted at the Seneca Meadows Wetland Preserve, a restored wetland and grassland site nominated as a New York Important Bird Area.”\n\nAudobon.org, Vulnerable Wildlife Find Refuge at Landfill-Owned Wetland Preserve\n\nIn 2007, IESI, owner of New York’s largest landfill, needed expansion, foreseeing an impact on 70+ acres of forested wetland. RES proposed a 1,100-acre wetland project, surpassing the standard mitigation ratio. The adjacent Dove Farm property became the Seneca Meadows Wetland Preserve.\n\nRES crafted the vision, designed plans, facilitated public meetings, and obtained permits. The plan included forested wetland restoration, Black Brook re-meandering, and enhancement of drained farm fields into IBA-quality areas.\n\nStarting in 2008, restoration professionals prepared and planted the site. RES formulated Integrated Pest Management and Invasive Species Management Plans, crucial for ecological balance.\n\nNative seeds were sourced locally and grown in Taylor Creek Restoration Nurseries. Field crews seeded 450 acres, planted 225,000 native plugs, and added 10,500 trees and shrubs. Continuous monitoring ensures ecosystem health.\n\nThe Preserve, vital within the Montezuma Wetlands Complex, accommodates hundreds of thousands of migrating birds. It offers educational opportunities through Audubon’s nature center and seven miles of trails, enriching the experience for visitors and birds alike.\n\nThe Stone Creek mitigation site is located approximately 14 miles southeast of Smithfield and contains three parcels totaling 161-acres in Johnston County, NC. The site involves the restoration and enhancement of unnamed tributaries to Mill Creek. The site was identified by RES as having potential to help meet the compensatory mitigation requirements for stream impacts in hydrologic unit 03020201 of the Neuse River Basin.\n\nThis proposed site will result in significant ecological improvements including water quality improvement, habitat restoration and a decrease in non-point source pollution from stormwater and agricultural practices. The site is located in the Mill Creek Watershed, a Targeted Local Watershed (TLW) and supports many of the Neuse River Basin Restoration Priorities Plan (RBRP) and Neuse Regional Watershed Plan (RWP) goals.\n\nMany of the project design goals and objectives, including restoration of riparian buffers to filter runoff from agricultural operations and improve terrestrial habitat, and construction of in-stream structures to improve habitat diversity, will address the degraded water quality and nutrient input from farming that were identified as major watershed stressors in the 2010 Neuse RBRP.\n\nThe conceptual design presents 5,886 linear feet of stream mitigation generating 4,547 Stream Mitigation Units (SMU). In addition to the stream restoration, the site could potentially provide nutrient offset mitigation and riparian buffer mitigation through the NC Division of Water Resources (DWR) Neuse Riparian Buffer Mitigation program. The buffer and nutrient offset mitigation will be developed through a separate banking instrument.\n\nRES is spearheading a critical environmental mitigation initiative for the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet’s (KYTC) Mountain Parkway Widening project in Wolfe County, Kentucky. This project focuses on mitigating ecological impacts through stream restoration within a compressed timeframe, aligning with the KYTC’s schedule demands.\n\nIn response to KYTC’s roadway widening initiative, RES was tasked with securing a mitigation site and developing a comprehensive Mitigation Plan for permitting. This required expedited action, with all necessary steps completed within approximately 12 months. The site selected by RES encompasses 644 acres at the headwaters of Straight Creek. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) approved this site for permittee-responsible mitigation in June 2021.\n\nThe approved Mitigation Plan will restore 50,194 linear feet of stream to generate 13,428 Ecological Integrity Units (EIUs). These units are essential to compensate for environmental disturbances caused by the parkway expansion. The plan encompasses re-establishment, rehabilitation, and enhancement of stream and wetland areas to ensure sustainability and long-term environmental benefits.\n\nThe project faced significant challenges, including the need for a mineral title search, which revealed a severance of mineral rights affecting the project’s credit generation potential. In collaboration with the legal firm Fox, Wood, Wood, & Estill, RES successfully reunited the mineral rights with surface ownership through a court-issued Default Judgment, thus enabling the full scope of mitigation efforts.\n\nDuring the project’s permitting phase, a revision in the Waters of the U.S. (WOUS) definition identified more streams requiring mitigation. RES expanded the mitigation area within the Straight Creek site to accommodate these changes, ensuring compliance and additional environmental preservation.\n\nPermits were obtained by July 2022, and the parkway construction began in August 2022. RES initiated restoration efforts at Straight Creek in October 2022, with completion expected by June 2024. This will be followed by post-construction success monitoring to assess the impact of ecological restoration.\n\nThe Stream Mitigation for the Mountain Parkway Widening Project exemplifies RES’s commitment to environmental stewardship. It highlights the company’s ability to navigate complex regulatory environments and logistical challenges to deliver timely and effective ecological solutions. This project serves as a model of efficient environmental mitigation aligned with large-scale infrastructure developments.\n\nWhen RES assessed the IDNR-designated Illinois Natural Area remnant on the private property of the Stronghold Retreat Center, the landowner understood their role as steward of this ecological jewel. In response, the Retreat Center engaged RES to conduct a comprehensive Natural Resource Inventory and Ecosystem Management Plan for the historic 326-acre property.\n\nThe property occupies picturesque, forested bluff lands of the Rock River in Northern Illinois, featuring unique savanna and hill prairie communities harboring some of the state’s most rare biological diversity. Investigations included mapping of natural and cultural features, and floristic quality and ecosystem health assessments.\n\nAmong the plan’s goals is the stewardship of healthy and attractive ecological settings that will continue to provide a naturally beautiful and inspirational setting for the Stronghold environmental education, and camp and retreat activities.\n\nThe plan also integrates ecosystem management principles into the site’s sustainable timber management program, balancing the need to protect critical habitat for regional and migratory songbirds and other wildlife, and important educational and recreational opportunities.\n\nIn the process of ecological restoration planning, RES developed an extensive geospatial database using high-resolution aerial imagery and remote sensing for conducting field investigations and as a tool for long-term management and education.\n\nRES’ geospatial team used both bare earth and first return LiDAR datasets to better understand the natural resources and cultural history of the 326-acre Stronghold property. Situated along the scenic bluffs of the Rock River, this property includes an IDNR-designated Illinois Natural Area and has a diverse and rich combination of karst, cultural, and vegetation resources. These were explored and mapped quickly and accurately with the help of State of Illinois LiDAR data.\n\nSixteen sinkholes of various sizes, ten historic quarries, numerous historic trails, and other cultural impacts were easily detected and mapped using a bare earth digital elevation model (DEM) along with 2-foot generated contours and shaded relief visualization. Hydrologic features such as drainages and erosion gullies were also mapped.\n\nWith the predominance of woodlands in this area, the Canopy Height Model derived from the first return LiDAR provided tremendous insight into the current forest structure and the historical impacts that created it. This led to the important discovery, collaborated with historical aerial photos, of former agricultural fields that were clearly visible in both the canopy height model and the surface DEM.\n\nThese findings greatly improved the delineation of vegetation communities and guided the restoration plans. The LiDAR data provided flexibility in generating derivative map products, such as contours at multiple intervals, slope, shaded relief, and elevations which greatly improved understanding and communication.\n\nIn 2020, RES completed stream restoration design and construction services along Tarnans Branch in Anne Arundel County, MD. This project was submitted as part of the 2017 Maryland State Highway Administration (SHA) Full Delivery Stream Restoration Services RFP, to help meet SHA’s total daily maximum load (TMDL) requirements.\n\nThe project required the restoration and stabilization of 4,421 LF of a degraded and unstable stream channel as well as the restoration of a 4.54-acre wetland floodplain. This project was designed utilizing a hybrid of natural channel design and floodplain reconnection "
