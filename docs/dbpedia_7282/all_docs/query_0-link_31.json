        "text": "🟢 Why Getting Your Dream Job Doesn't Matter 🟢 Last weekend, a client told me something. “If I don’t land a Summer 2025 investment banking internship, all the work over the past 2 years would’ve been a waste.” I can see where he was coming from. I used to think like this too. During my recruitment cycle, this “all or nothing” mindset gave me the fuel I needed to do what was required. But it also magnified any sign of failure and made me question my self-worth when things didn’t go as planned. This made it hard to move forward. I was continually haunted by the thought that what I was doing might not even be worth it…that it would all end in failure. ➡ What I missed was that the true reward wasn’t the job, the internship, or the offer. ✅ It’s the person I became through pursuing those things. ✅ The person who can overcome the tsunami of “No’s” that comes with high-finance recruiting. Like in a video game where, to level up, experience points must be earned. Each failure filled up my experience bar. The more I failed, the faster I leveled up. ✍ The math was simple. If, for example, 5% of people trying for Investment Banking actually got it. Then all I needed to do was gain enough experience such that I was in the 95th percentile of ‘players’. Meaning… 🚫 I needed to collect more “No’s”, receive more rejections, and experience more failures than 95% of people. 🚫 ----- I asked my him: “Have you pushed yourself and gotten out of your comfort zone over the past 2 years?” “Yes” “Have you worked harder than you ever have?” “Yes” “Have you learned from your mistakes?” “Yes” “Then the time wasn’t wasted. YOU learned, YOU improved and YOU got better.” The job market is efficient. 💪 As you level up, you’ll naturally unlock opportunities previously out of reach. Focus on leveling up, on doing what the previous version of you couldn’t or wouldn’t. And take pride in your progress, however minute it might seem. 🤩 The rest, as they say, will follow. #investmentbanking #finance #financestudents #financejobs #privateequity #careerdevelopment #students #internships\n\nHey folks, if you're looking for jobs, beware. Many companies post positions that aren't really available, trying to look like happening places to work. The \"dream\" salary you were promised when you got out of school is often less likely to be there than you were told. They said the same things when I graduated 25 years ago. The reality is, you need to work your way up just like your parents did. College alone isn't enough to demand a $90k/year job right away; you need experience to back it up, and summer internships aren't sufficient. So, settle in, find a company you like, and learn everything you can. Remember, as Dave Ramsey wisely says, \"Financial peace isn't the acquisition of stuff. It's learning to live on less than you make, so you can give money back and have money to invest. You can't win until you do this\" (Ramsey Solutions). It's not just about the money you earn, but how wisely you manage and save it. Leverage every opportunity to learn and grow. You might be better served with a few years of amazing experience then a few extra bucks those first years out of school. With that said don't let companies bully you into poverty level wedges.

Tell you something you don’t know…right?! 🤣🤣🙈 I don’t mean I, need help…what I mean is can you help me achieve something awesome?🤔🤩 I want to build a bit of a list of firms that currently have, or will have later in the year, internships, grad schemes and the like. What would be even better (selfishly, but there is valid reasoning) would be to know about firms that are #Sussex based, or national firms that have local offices. Why? I’m going to attend a few Careers events in local educational settings later this year, I’m also going to look at delivering Financial Education sessions and I would love to be able to raise awareness of our industry as a career choice. If I do this though, I need to be able to inform about options. I’m looking for firms in both General Insurance and Financial Services, so that my fellow Sussex CII (IIS) Council Members James Hoad & Ben Woodman and I, can work together to provide opportunities for the next generation. Any help here would be gratefully appreciated🥰 And just to clarify, I am not going to start posting pics of my my dinner everyday🤣🤣 #opportunities #career #GeneralInsurance #Financialservices #careers #financialeducation #together\n\n⭐ A practice is only as good as its people, whether that’s administrative office staff or financial advisors. 🏆 In a competitive landscape, finding quality talent isn’t always easy. However, recruitment is an effective and rewarding strategy to meet your growth goals, and there’s no shortage of recruiting strategies financial advisors can use to attract top talent to their firm. ✔ TARGET NEW TALENT: Consider reaching out to nearby universitites that offer relevant degrees and CFP programs. ✔ LEVERAGE EXISTING NETWORKS: Ask for leads from family, friends and fellow practices. ✔ CONSIDER DEVELOPING AN INTERNSHIP PROGRAM: Internships are a great way to judge a potential entry-level candidate’s skills and cultural fit. ✔ ATTEND EVENTS: Connect with other industry professionals through networking events. Momentum Wealth Partners offers advisors a variety of services and materials to help make the recruiting and onboarding process as smooth as possible, including complimentary recruiting support from our Business Development Team.

For Barron's Advisor, our Managing Director of Wealth Management Services Erin Voisin, CFP®, EA, MS, CDFA®, ChFC® explained how EP’s program is helping to lay the foundation for a new generation of wealth management professionals, while sharing how her experience as an intern shaped her career. She wrote, “So how do we attract, train, and retain young talent? I offer my experience as an answer. I went to college leaning toward a degree in psychology because I’m naturally a people person, albeit one who enjoys working with numbers. Then I got the opportunity to intern at a large insurance company. Between working with the software and seeing my first financial plan come to life in a meeting, a lightbulb went off. I realized this is what I wanted to do.” Read the full article here: https://hubs.la/Q02l4BZl0 #wealthmanagement #financialprofessionals #nextgeneration\n\n“Your journey is yours alone, and it's worth every step.” Meet Michelle Lockner who has completed work experience at Morgan Stanley and BNP Paribas, Spring Weeks at JP Morgan and HSBC, Internships at JP Morgan and Standard Life Aberdeen and successful converted to a Graduate analyst role at JP Morgan. Here are her Top tips to secure a role: 1) Be yourself. When applying, there’s a real opportunity for you to just be yourself. Employers value this - it’s what sets you apart! 🏄♂️ 2) Be proactive. Take every opportunity to enhance your application. While securing a spring week, internship, or placement is beneficial, it’s not the only path. Utilize all aspects of your university experience - volunteering, part-time work, joining societies, participating in committees and pursuing personal projects. These diverse activities offer valuable examples for interviews. Remember, skills are transferable, and your ability to articulate them is what truly matters! 🚴♀️ 3) Explore organizations like Rare Recruitment, upReach and SEO London (to name a few!) for tailored support and resources. They offer mentorship, training programs, and networking opportunities to boost your application and stand out. 🏢 4) Apply early! I would always recommend to apply as soon as possible, to maximize your chances. Of course, the quality of your application is equally important! 💻 5) Maintain a personal tracker for all your applications. Juggling multiple timelines can get overwhelming, so having a system in place will keep you organised and ensure you don't miss any important deadlines. Also, it’s a great way to stay focused and motivated throughout the application process (if you need one, feel free to DM me - I’ve got a few handy templates to share!) 📅 Things she’d tell her younger self: 1) Don’t internalise rejections. You can sometimes feel like there’s something wrong with you or your application, but sometimes it’s just not the right fit and that’s okay! Rejection = redirection. 🛫 2) Don’t compare. Everyone’s journey is different. Your path may not follow the same linear trajectory as others, but that's what makes it uniquely yours. Embrace the twists, turns, and detours along the way; they're all part of your growth and story. Trust in your abilities, stay resilient, and keep forging ahead with confidence. Your journey is yours alone, and it's worth every step. 🏋♀️ Feel free to reach out to her and ask any further questions you may have.\n\n🌟Day 25/75 Days- Discover Your Next Career Chapter! 🌟 \"Success isn't the key to happiness.
