        "text": "All charges for incoming undergraduate students are assessed based on when they will begin their studies at the University:\n\nFall entrants (those beginning their studies in August): charges assessed in mid-July\n\nSpring entrants (those beginning their studies in January): charges assessed on a rolling basis, beginning in mid-November\n\nIf you do not complete the Online Health Insurance Process to waive the UR Student Health Insurance Plan before the charges are assessed, you will be automatically enrolled in the plan and charged the cost of the plan. (Your external insurance plan must meet these criteria in order for you to waive coverage in the University-sponsored plan.)\n\nTo avoid this charge on your bill, make sure to complete the Online Health Insurance Process to waive coverage by July 1 (for fall entrants) and as soon as possible after enrolling (for spring entrants).\n\nPayment is due by the tenth of the month, unless otherwise specified. You (and your authorized family or friends) will receive an email notification to view your student account before your bill is due. To authorize a third party to view your bill and access the online payment option in UR Student, view this tutorial and video.\n\nThe University offers a monthly payment option, which consists of four monthly payments for each semester. The payment due dates are August 10, September 10, October 10, and November 10 for the fall semester and December 10, January 10, February 10, and March 10 for the spring semester.\n\nYou must elect the monthly payment option at the start of every semester. A $25 administrative fee will be charged to your student account each semester when this plan is chosen. Learn more on the Bursar's website.\n\nOnline: You can view and pay your bill in UR Student. (View this tutorial and video on how to access your bill.)
