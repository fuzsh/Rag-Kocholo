Is the graduate/non-credit course required to meet the minimum education requirements of my position?\n\nIf yes – taxable\n\nIf no – read next question\n\n2. Is the graduate/non-credit course part of a program of study that will qualify me for a new trade or business?\n\nIf yes – taxable\n\nIf no – read next question\n\n3. Will the graduate/non-credit course maintain or improve skills required, appropriate or helpful to my current position?\n\nIf yes – non-taxable\n\nIf no – read next question\n\n4. Is the graduate/non-credit course required as a condition to retain my current position or pay rate?\n\nIf yes – non-taxable\n\nIf no – taxable\n\n*For the course to qualify as a tax exempt job-related course, the answers to the first two questions must be “No”, and the answer to either the third or fourth question must be “Yes”.\n\nGraduate tuition assistance benefits and/or tuition reimbursement for non-credit courses that exceed $5,250 in a calendar year are taxable wages unless the course satisfies the requirements for a tax deductible job-related course under IRS rules. Generally, a job-related course will satisfy these IRS requirements if it maintains or improves skills for the individual’s present job, or if the course meets the employer’s express requirements for retaining the job, and the course is not part of a program that will qualify the individual for a new trade or business.\n\nIf you believe that your proposed graduate level course(s) and/or non-credit course(s) satisfies the requirements for a tax deductible job-related course under IRS rules, follow these instructions:\n\nFor the employee tuition waiver benefit, answer all the applicable questions on the online Employee Tuition Waiver application available in HRMS.\n\nFor the tuition reimbursement benefit, complete the “University of Rochester Graduate Tuition Waiver/Reimbursement Tax Exemption Form” on pages 5 of the Employee Tuition Reimbursement application.\n\n(Employees can use the information above to determine whether or not a course is taxable).\n\nFor taxable tuition benefits:\n\nApplicable Federal and State income taxes and FICA taxes (approximately 41.35% of the taxable tuition amount) will be deducted from the employee’s paycheck when the waiver is approved or the reimbursement is paid to the employee. In addition, the taxable income will be reflected on the W-2 for the calendar year when the actual tuition benefit is posted to the student’s account or reimbursed to the employee.\n\n1. Add up the amount of tuition benefits you are receiving for the graduate course and/or non-credit courses you will be taking during the winter/spring semester/quarter.\n\nExample: 2 courses for $3,330 each- $3,330 + $3,330 = $6,660\n\n2. Deduct $5,250 from the total amount of graduate tuition benefits for the semester/quarter. This new total is the taxable amount of your employee tuition benefits for the current semester/quarter.\n\nExample: $6,660 – $5,250 = $1,410.00\n\n3. Multiply the taxable amount by 41.35% (the approximate rate of tax for Federal and State income taxes and FICA taxes). This new total is roughly equal to the amount of taxes that will be deducted from your paycheck(s) during the current semester (tuition waiver) or the amount your reimbursement will be reduced (tuition reimbursement).\n\nExample: $1,410 x 41.35% = $583.04 (Estimated deduction from your paycheck (tuition waiver) or amount your benefit will be reduced (tuition reimbursement).\n\n4. Then, if you are taking more courses in another semester (summer or fall), add up the amount of tuition benefits for the graduate courses you will be taking during that semester/quarter.\n\nExample: 2 courses for $3,330 each- $3,330 + $3,330 = $6,660.\n\nIf you have already received graduate tuition benefits over $5,250 during the calendar year, this entire total is the taxable amount of your employee tuition benefits for that semester/quarter.\n\n5. Multiply the taxable amount by 41.35% (the approximate rate of tax for Federal and State income taxes and FICA taxes). This new total is roughly equal to the amount of taxes that will be deducted from your paycheck(s) during that semester (tuition waiver) or the amount your tuition benefit will be reduced (tuition reimbursement).\n\nExample: $6,660 x 41.35% = $2,753.91 (Estimated deduction from your paycheck (tuition waiver) or amount your benefit will be reduced (tuition reimbursement)."
