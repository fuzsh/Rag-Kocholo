        "text": "On March 19, 2021, Governor Newsom signed into law the California Legislature passed Senate Bill (“SB”) 95[1], codifying at Labor Code section 248.2 new obligations on employers to provide COVID-19 Supplemental Paid Sick Leave to employees who are unable to work or telework for certain qualifying reasons. SB 95 entitles a new employee to this leave retroactive to January 1, 2021[2] and effective through September 30, 2021.[3],[4] This requirement takes effect on March 29, 2021.\n\nI. New Employer Obligations to Provide COVID-19 Supplemental Paid Sick Leave\n\nEmployers must now provide paid leave to employees for reasons related to COVID-19. SB 95 provides rules for: (1) which employees are eligible; (2) the qualifying reasons for the leave; (3) the amount and level of compensation for the paid sick leave benefit; (4) the obligation to retroactively apply the new obligations; and (5) employer notice requirements.\n\nA. Employee Eligibility for COVID-19 Supplemental Paid Sick Leave\n\nUnder Labor Code section 248.2, employers that employ more than 25 employees[5], including schools and non-profits, must provide COVID-19 Supplemental Paid Sick Leave to any employee who is unable to work or telework due to one of the qualifying reason discussed in the next section.[6]\n\nAs a result, any employer that employs more than 25 employees should immediately begin to prepare a COVID-19 Supplemental Paid Sick Leave policy that will provide the paid leaves discussed herein to qualified employees.\n\nB. Qualifying Reasons for COVID-19 Supplemental Paid Sick Leave\n\nIn order for an employee to qualify for COVID-19 Supplemental Paid Sick Leave, the employee must be unable to work or telework because the employee is:[7]\n\nSubject to a quarantine or isolation period related to COVID-19 as defined by an order or guidelines of the State Department of Public Health (“CDPH”), the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”), or a local health officer who has jurisdiction over the workplace.[8]\n\nAdvised by a health care provider to self-quarantine due to concerns related to COVID-19.[9]\n\nExperiencing symptoms of COVID-19 and seeking a medical diagnosis.[10]\n\nCaring for a family member[11] who is subject to a quarantine or isolation order or guidelines described above, or who has been advised to self-quarantine by a health care provider.[12]\n\nCaring for a child[13] whose school or place of care is closed or otherwise unavailable for reasons related to COVID-19 on the premises.[14]\n\nAttending an appointment to receive a vaccine for protection against contracting COVID-19.[15]\n\nExperiencing symptoms related to a COVID-19 vaccine that prevent the employee from being able to work or telework.[16]\n\nWhile the new law does not expressly provide a qualifying reason for employees excluded from the workplace as a result of a “close contact” exposure in the workplace, the law allows an employer to require that an employee use COVID-19 Supplemental Paid Sick Leave for such purpose.[17]\n\nC. Benefits under COVID-19 Supplemental Paid Sick Leave\n\n1. Leave Amounts\n\nEmployees who qualify to receive COVID-19 Supplemental Paid Sick Leave will be entitled to up to 80 hours of such paid leave if they are full-time employees.[18] Part-time employees will be entitled to a prorated amount of such leave based on their normally scheduled work hours over a two-week period.[19]\n\nCOVID-19 Supplemental Paid Sick Leave is intended to supplement, and not run concurrent with, paid sick leave entitlements provided to employees under the state paid sick leave law.[20] Specifically, Labor Code section 248.2 states that “[a]n employer shall not require a[n] employee to use any other paid or unpaid leave, paid time off, or vacation time provided by the employer to the covered employee before the covered employee uses COVID-19 [S]upplemental [P]aid [S]ick [L]eave or in lieu of COVID-19 [S]upplemental [P]aid [S]ick [L]eave.”\n\n2. Compensation for Leave\n\nEmployees who qualify to receive COVID-19 Supplemental Paid Sick Leave will be compensated for each hour of such leave at their “regular rate of pay” up to $511 per day and $5,110 in the aggregate.[21],[22]\n\nD. Retroactive Application of Paid Leave Obligations\n\nThe paid leave obligations are retroactive to January 1, 2021.[23] Employers must calculate and be prepared to compensate employees who took leave between January 1, 2021, and the date that the employer adopted a COVID-19 Supplemental Paid Sick Leave policy.\n\nWhile Labor Code section 248.2 requires employers to provide a retroactive payment upon the oral or written request of the employee[24], employers may consider adopting a more proactive approach by calculating employees’ qualified leave usage and providing the required compensation.\n\nEmployers that elect not to take a more proactive approach should note that the retroactive payment must be paid on or before the next full pay period after the employee’s request.[25]\n\nRegardless of the approach taken by employers to comply with the retroactive application of the paid leave obligations, the employer may count the retroactive COVID-19 Supplemental Paid Sick Leave provided against the total amount of COVID-19 Supplemental Paid Sick Leave to which the employee is entitled.\n\nE. Employer Notice Obligations\n\nThis new law also requires employers to post or electronically submit a model notice related to COVID-19 Supplemental Paid Sick Leave. The Labor Commissioner has prepared a model notice that employers may use to satisfy the notice requirements concerning employee entitlement to COVID-19 Supplemental Paid Sick Leave, which is available here: https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/2021-COVID-19-Supplemental-Paid-Sick-Leave.pdf.[26]\n\nAs some schools and non-profits may have employees who work remotely, the model notice should be posted in a prominent location at all school and non-profit worksites and facilities and the model notice should also be sent by email to ensure that teleworking employees receive such notice in a timely manner.\n\nII. Interaction between COVID-19 Supplemental Paid Sick Leave and the American Rescue Plan Act (“ARPA”)\n\nThe recently-enacted ARPA provided for an extension of payroll tax credits to employers that voluntarily provide Emergency Paid Sick Leave (“EPSL”) to employees between April 1 and September 30, 2021.\n\nIn the section below, we explain how the obligations set forth under Labor Code section 248.2 interact with the ARPA so that employers may use federal relief to offset some, if not all of the costs, incurred as a result of the new obligations related to the provision of COVID-19 Supplemental Paid Sick Leave.\n\nA. Qualifying for the Receipt of Such Tax Credits\n\nWhile employers are eligible to receive payroll tax credits, in order to qualify for receipt of such credits under the ARPA, the employer must provide its employees EPSL leave between April 1 and September 30, 2021 for each of the qualifying reasons provided for under the ARPA.\n\nThe ARPA expanded the qualifying reasons for which an employee may receive EPSL and employers may receive payroll tax credit, supplementing the five (5) qualifying reasons initially provided for under the FFCRA[27] with three (3) new qualifying reasons.\n\nAs a result of the expansion, if an employer wants to receive a payroll tax credit, it must provide its employees paid leave if they are unable to work or telework because the employee is:\n\nSubject to a Federal, State, or local quarantine or isolation order related to COVID-19;\n\nAdvised by a health care provider to self-quarantine related to COVID-19;\n\nExperiencing COVID-19 symptoms and is seeking a medical diagnosis;\n\nCaring for an individual subject to an order described in (1) or self-quarantine as described in (2);\n\nCaring for a child whose school or place of care is closed (or child care provider is unavailable) for reasons related to COVID-19;\n\nObtaining immunization related to COVID–19; or\n\nRecovering from any injury, disability, illness, or condition related to such a COVID-19 immunization’ after medical diagnosis; or\n\nSeeking or awaiting the results of a diagnostic test for, or a medical diagnosis of, COVID–19 and such employee has been exposed to COVID–19 or the employee’s employer has requested such test or diagnosis\n\nAs provided above, the first seven (7) qualifying reasons for expanded EPSL closely align with the qualifying reasons for COVID-19 Supplemental Paid Sick Leave provided for under Labor Code section 248.2, but the eighth (8th) qualifying reason provided for under ARPA is absent from the Labor Code.[28] Below is a chart comparing the specific statutory language used to describe the qualifying reasons for COVID-19 Supplemental Paid Leave required under Labor Code section 248.2 and the paid leaves for which an employer may qualify for payroll tax credit under the ARPA:\n\nReasons obligating an employer to provide employee COVID-19 Supplemental Paid Sick under SB 95 Reasons for which an employer would be entitled to receive a payroll tax credit if it elects to provide employees EPSL under the American Rescue Plan Act The employee is subject to a quarantine or isolation period related to COVID-19[29],[30] The employee is subject to a Federal, State, or local quarantine or isolation order related to COVID-19 The employee has been advised by a health care provider to self-quarantine due to concerns related to COVID-19 The employee has been advised by a health care provider to self-quarantine related to COVID-19 The employee is experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 and seeking a medical diagnosis. The employee is experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and is seeking a medical diagnosis. The employee is caring for a family member who is either: (1) subject to a quarantine or isolation period related to COVID-19; or (2) who has been advised by a health care provider to self-quarantine due to concerns related to COVID-19 The employee is caring for an individual that is either: (1) subject to Federal, State, or local quarantine or isolation order related to COVID-19; or (2) has been advised by a health care provider to self-quarantine related to COVID-19. The employee is caring for a child whose school or place of care is closed or otherwise unavailable for reasons related to COVID-19 on the premises. The employee is caring for a child whose school or place of care is closed (or child care provider is unavailable) for reasons related to COVID-19; The employee is attending an appointment to receive a vaccine for protection against contracting COVID-19. The employee is obtaining immunization [i.e., vaccination] related to COVID–19 The employee is experiencing symptoms related to a COVID-19 vaccine that prevent the employee from being able to work or telework. The employee is recovering from any injury, disability, illness, or condition related to such a COVID-19 immunization’ after ‘medical diagnosis’ The employee is seeking or awaiting the results of a diagnostic test for, or a medical diagnosis of, COVID–19 and such employee has been exposed to COVID–19 or the employee’s employer has requested such test or diagnosis\n\nGiven that Labor Code section 248.2 now requires that employers provide COVID-19 Supplemental Paid Sick Leave for the first seven (7) qualifying reasons, employers may consider providing their employees paid leave for the eighth (8th) qualifying reason for expanded EPSL in order receive payroll tax credits for the provision of such leave between April 1 and September 30, 2021.\n\nB. Misalignment of Effective Dates for Paid Leaves under the American Rescue Plan Act and SB 95\n\nEmployers that are considering providing EPSL to employees voluntarily in order to qualify for the payroll tax credits should note that the timing of the paid leaves under the ARPA and Labor Code section 248.1 do not align, and that the misalignment may cause issues with the administration of such leaves. Under the ARPA, in order for an employer to qualify for payroll tax credits, it must provide qualified full-time employees up to 80 hours of leave to be used between April 1 and September 30, 2021.[31] However, under Labor Code section 248.2, employers must provide qualified employees COVID-19 Supplemental Paid Sick Leave up to 80 hours of leave effective January 1, 2021.[32] Because of the misalignment of effective dates for two leaves, employers that wish to receive payroll tax credits under the APRA will need to provide additional leave to employees who have used COVID-19 Supplement Paid Sick Leave between January 1 and March 31, 2021, as under ARPA all full-time employees must have 80 hours of expanded EPSL available to use on April 1, 2021.\n\nEmployers should contact a certified public accountant (“CPA”) or tax counsel in order to evaluate whether the receipt of the payroll tax credits is worth the time and expense of administering a leave program that will require that the employer provide employees additional paid leave rights on April 1, 2021.\n\nAs a result of these new leave rights, a school or non-profit that employs more than 25 employees should immediately begin to develop a policy to provide COVID-19 Supplemental Paid Sick Leave as required by SB 95. Employers should also begin calculating leaves provided to employees after January 1, 2021 in order to determine which prior employee leaves may qualify for payment under Labor Code section 248.2.\n\nLiebert Cassidy Whitmore attorneys are familiar with obligations set forth in Labor Code section 248.2 and the operation of that law in conjunction with provisions of the ARPA.
