No public school, charter school or school district will be held accountable for any other accountability group consisting of fewer than 30 students as long as the \"all student\" accountability group includes at least 30 students for that school year.\n\nFor purposes of determining adequate yearly progress, only the performance of continuously enrolled students in grades 3-8 shall be included for consideration.\n\nAn accountability group shall be deemed to have made adequate yearly progress on an accountability performance criterion specified in paragraph (14) of this subdivision if:\n\nthe superintendent of the school district or the principal of the charter school has submitted the required student data files to the commissioner pursuant to paragraph (bb)(2) of this section or section 119.3(b) of this Title in the timeframe and format specified by the commissioner; and\n\nfor accountability groups consisting of 40 or more students, either:\n\nthe participation rate for the current year equals or exceeds 95 percent; or\n\nthe weighted average of the current year and prior year participation rates equals or exceeds 95 percent;\n\nfor accountability groups consisting of 30 or more students:\n\nthe accountability group met or exceeded, or did not differ significantly as determined by the commissioner, from the annual measurable objective for that criterion; or\n\nthe accountability group met or exceeded, or did not differ significantly as determined by the commissioner, from an annual performance target established by the commissioner and the accountability group met or exceeded the third performance indicator at that grade level, as defined in paragraph (15) of this subdivision.\n\nA public school, charter school or school district shall be deemed to have made adequate yearly progress on a performance indicator specified in paragraph (15) of this subdivision if:\n\nthe superintendent of the school district or the principal of the charter school has submitted the required student data files to the commissioner pursuant to paragraph (bb)(2) of this section or section 119.3(b) of this Title in the timeframe and format specified by the commissioner; and\n\nthe \"all students\" accountability group in the school or school district at the applicable grade levels or high school cohort met or exceeded the performance indicator and, for elementary and middle levels, and beginning in 2005-2006 for the elementary-middle level, 80 percent of students enrolled on all days of the science test administration, who did not have a significant medical emergency, received valid scores.\n\nFor each school year, public schools, school districts, and charter schools in which no students or, pursuant to subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph fewer than 30 students, participate in the required State assessments for English language arts or mathematics, or in which the majority of students are not continuously enrolled, shall conduct a self-assessment of their academic program and the school learning environment, in such format and using such criteria as may be prescribed by the commissioner. Such self-assessment shall not be required of those schools and school districts for which the commissioner shall conduct a review of the performance of the school or school district in accordance with subparagraph (viii) of this paragraph. The superintendent of the school district or principal of the charter school shall review the self-assessment(s) and make a recommendation to the commissioner, in such format and according to such timeframe as the commissioner may prescribe, as to whether the school or school district has made adequate yearly progress. The commissioner shall consider the self-assessment, board recommendation and any other relevant information in determining whether the school or school district made adequate yearly progress.\n\nThe school accountability status of public schools, school districts, and charter schools serving grades 1 and/or 2, but not grade 3 or higher, (hereafter referred to as \"feeder schools\") will be determined using backmapping. In school districts with such feeder schools and in school districts that accept grade 3 students from feeder schools by contract, the grade three State assessment results for each feeder school student will be attributed to the feeder school as well as to the school or charter school in which the student took the assessment. The student's results will be attributed to a feeder school only if the student was continuously enrolled in the feeder school from the date prescribed by the commissioner on which the BEDS forms are required to be completed until the end of the school year in the highest grade served by the feeder school. In a district, if all schools serving grade three make adequate yearly progress in a given year, all feeder schools served by the district will be deemed to have made adequate yearly progress. If one or more schools enrolling students from a feeder school fail to make adequate yearly progress on a criterion set forth at subparagraphs (14)(iii) and (vi) of this subdivision, the commissioner will aggregate the district's grade three results on that criterion by feeder school and determine whether each feeder school made adequate yearly progress on that criterion. If a feeder school fails to make adequate yearly progress on the same criterion for two consecutive years, the school will be designated as a school in Improvement (year 1).\n\nDifferentiated Accountability for Schools.\n\nExcept as provided in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, beginning with the 2009-2010 school year and thereafter, public schools, and charter schools that receive funds under title I, that failed to make adequate yearly progress (AYP) pursuant to this subparagraph shall be designated into accountability phases and phase categories as follows:\n\nAccountability phases.\n\nImprovement phase.\n\nA school that fails to make AYP for two consecutive years on the same accountability performance criterion in paragraph (14) of this subdivision or the same accountability indicator in paragraph (15) of this subdivision shall be designated in the next school year as a school in Improvement (year 1) for that accountability performance criterion/accountability indicator.\n\nA school that is designated as a school in Improvement (year 1) that fails to make AYP on the same accountability performance criterion or accountability indicator for which it has been identified shall be designated in the next school year as a school in Improvement (year 2) for that accountability performance criterion/accountability indicator.\n\nCorrective action phase.\n\nA school that is designated as a school in Improvement (year 2) that fails to make AYP on the same accountability performance criterion or accountability indicator for which it has been identified as a school in Improvement (year 2) shall be designated in the next school year as a school in Corrective Action (year 1) for that accountability performance criterion/accountability indicator.\n\nA school that is designated as a school in Corrective Action (year 1) that fails to make AYP on the same accountability performance criterion or accountability indicator for which it has been identified shall be designated in the next school year as a school in Corrective Action (year 2) for that accountability performance criterion/accountability indicator.\n\nRestructuring phase.\n\nA school that is designated as a school in Corrective Action (year 2) that fails to make AYP on the same accountability performance criterion or accountability indicator for which it has been identified shall be designated in the next school year as a school in Restructuring (year 1) for that accountability performance criterion/accountability indicator.\n\nA school that is designated as a school in Restructuring (year 1) that fails to make AYP on the same accountability performance criterion or accountability indicator for which it has been identified shall be designated in the next school year as a school in Restructuring (year 2) for that accountability performance criterion/accountability indicator.\n\nA school that is designated as a school in Restructuring (year 2) that fails to make AYP on the same accountability performance criterion or accountability indicator for which it has been identified shall be designated in the next school year as a school in Restructuring (advanced) for that accountability performance criterion/accountability indicator.\n\nPhase categories.\n\nImprovement phase. Schools designated in Improvement shall be assigned to a category upon entry into the phase as follows:\n\nBasic:\n\nschools that fail to make AYP for one accountability group within one accountability performance criterion, but not the all students group; or\n\nschools that fail to make AYP for one of the accountability indicators, but met the accountability performance criterion.\n\nFocused:\n\nschools that fail to make AYP for more than one accountability performance criterion, but not the all students group; or\n\nschools that fail to make AYP for more than one accountability student group within an accountability performance criterion, but not the all students group.\n\nComprehensive:\n\nschools that fail to make AYP for the all students group on any accountability performance criterion; or\n\nschools that fail to make AYP for every accountability group, except the all students group, within an accountability criterion for which there are at least two accountability groups other than the all students group; or\n\nschools that fail to make AYP for an accountability performance criterion and for an indicator.\n\nCorrective Action or Restructuring phase. Schools designated in Corrective Action or Restructuring shall be assigned to a category upon entry into the phase as follows:\n\nFocused:\n\nschools that fail to make AYP for one of the accountability indicators, but met the accountability performance criterion; or\n\nschools that fail to make AYP for more than one accountability performance criterion, but not with the all students group; or\n\nschools that fail to make AYP for one or more accountability groups within an accountability performance criterion, but not the all students group.\n\nComprehensive:\n\nschools that fail to make AYP for the all students group on any accountability performance criterion; or\n\nschools that fail to make AYP for every accountability group, except the all students group, within an accountability performance criterion for which there are at least two accountability groups other than the all students group; or\n\nschools that fail to make AYP for an accountability performance criterion and for an accountability indicator.\n\nThe commissioner shall designate a school’s overall accountability status as the most advanced phase for which it has been identified on an accountability performance criterion/accountability indicator and, within that designated phase, shall assign the highest category, provided that such category may not be reduced in a subsequent year of a phase.\n\nUpon a finding of exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances, the commissioner may delay for a period of one year the designation of a school under this paragraph.\n\nSpecial transition provisions for schools in operation during the 2008-2009 school year and for schools under registration review. Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph:\n\nfor each public school that was in operation during the 2008-2009 school year and for each charter school that was in operation and received funds under title I during the 2008-2009 school year, the commissioner shall designate the school's accountability phase and phase category for the 2009-2010 school year, based upon the school's accountability status for the 2008-2009 school year and the school's adequate yearly progress (AYP) status for the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 school years;\n\nnotwithstanding the provisions of clause (a) of this subparagraph, a school that is identified for registration review pursuant to paragraph (9) of this subdivision during a school year in which it is designated as a school in Improvement or Corrective Action shall, in the next school year, be designated as a school in Restructuring (year 1)/Comprehensive and shall be subject to the requirements of subclause (iv)(c)(2) of this paragraph.\n\nRemoval from accountability designation. A school that makes adequate yearly progress for two consecutive years on the accountability performance criterion/accountability indicator for which it has been identified shall be removed from accountability designation for that accountability performance criterion and/or accountability indicator.\n\nInterventions.\n\nImprovement phase schools.\n\nSchool quality review. Each school upon initial designation for the Improvement phase shall participate in a school quality review, to include at a minimum a self-assessment of the educational program, using quality indicators in a form and content prescribed by the commissioner. The school quality review shall focus on the accountability group(s) for each accountability performance criterion and/or accountability indicator for which the school has been identified.\n\nSchool improvement plan. A school improvement plan, in such format as may be prescribed by the commissioner, shall be developed based on the school quality review and cover a two year period. The plan shall:\n\nbe formally approved by the board of education (in New York City, approved by the chancellor or chancellor's designee) no later than three months following the designation of the school in the Improvement phase and shall be subject to the approval of the commissioner, upon request;\n\nbe implemented no later than the beginning of the next school year after the school year in which the school was identified or immediately upon approval of the board of education if such approval occurs after the first day of regular school attendance;\n\nbe updated annually and, as so updated, approved by the board of education and implemented no later than the first day of regular student attendance of each year that the school remains in improvement. If, in the second year of improvement, the school fails to make AYP with a different accountability group for which the school is subsequently designated for improvement or is subsequently designated for improvement for a different accountability performance criterion or indicator, the school shall modify the plan consistent with the highest accountability category and also address the additional group(s), criterion or indicator;\n\nfor a school designated as Improvement/Basic, the plan shall also include a description of activities and timeline for implementation. The district shall be responsible for oversight and support of the plan;\n\nfor a school designated as Improvement/Focused, the plan shall, consistent with State law, also include one or more of the actions set forth in section 6316 (b)(3)(A)(i-x) of the NCLB, 20 U.S.C. section 6316(b)(3)(A)(i-x) (United States Code, 2006 Edition, Volume 13; Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Stop SSOP, Washington, DC 20402-0001; 2008; available at the Office of Counsel, State Education Building, Room 148, Albany, NY 12234), in accordance with a written report by the school quality review team; and\n\nfor a school designated as Improvement/Comprehensive, the plan shall, consistent with State law, also include all of the actions set forth in section 6316 (b)(3)(A)(i-x) of the NCLB, 20 U.S.C. section 6316(b)(3)(A)(i-x) (United States Code, 2006 Edition, Volume 13; Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Stop SSOP, Washington, DC 20402-0001; 2008; available at the Office of Counsel, State Education Building, Room 148, Albany, NY 12234), in accordance with a written report by the school quality review team. Such report may include a recommendation that the school engage the services of a content area consultant.\n\nOn-site review.

The review shall focus on the accountability group(s), accountability performance criterion and/or indicator for which the school was identified. The district shall be responsible for oversight and support of the plan;\n\nfor a school designated as Improvement/Comprehensive, the school shall be required to participate in an intensive on-site review that shall be conducted by a school quality review team, with district representation, appointed by the commissioner. The review shall focus on the systemic issues at the school that have caused the school to be designated for Improvement. The district shall be responsible for oversight and support of the plan.\n\nCorrective action phase schools.\n\nCurriculum audit. Except as provided in paragraph (9) of this subdivision, each school, upon initial designation for the Corrective Action phase, shall participate in a curriculum audit to assess the school’s educational program. The curriculum audit shall be in a form and content prescribed by the commissioner and shall focus on the accountability group(s) for each accountability performance criterion and/or accountability indicator for which the school was identified. The school shall be assisted by a school quality review team, with district representation, appointed by the commissioner.\n\nCorrective action plan. A corrective action plan, in such format as may be prescribed by the commissioner, shall be developed and cover a two-year period. The district and school quality review team shall provide oversight and support for implementation of a corrective action plan. The plan shall:\n\nbe formally approved by the board of education (in New York City, approved by the chancellor or chancellor's designee) no later than three months following the designation of the school in the Corrective Action phase and shall be subject to the approval of the commissioner, upon request;\n\nbe implemented no later than the beginning of the next school year after the school year in which the school was identified or immediately upon approval of the board of education if such approval occurs after the first day of regular school attendance;\n\nbe updated annually and incorporate the findings of the audit and any other action required to be taken by the district pursuant to this subclause and, as so updated, approved by the board of education and implemented no later than the first day of regular student attendance of each year that the school remains in corrective action. If, in the second year of corrective action, the school fails to make AYP with a different accountability group for which the school is subsequently designated for corrective action or is subsequently designated for corrective action on a different accountability performance criterion or indicator, the school shall modify the plan consistent with the highest accountability category and also address the additional group(s), criterion or indicator;\n\ninclude, to the extent consistent with State law, at least one of the actions set forth at section 6316(b)(7)(C)(iv)(I-VI) of the NCLB, 20 U.S.C. section 6316(b)(7)(C)(iv)(I-VI) (United States Code, 2006 Edition, Volume 13; Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Stop SSOP, Washington, DC 20402-0001; 2008; available at the Office of Counsel, State Education Building, Room 148, Albany, NY 12234). The district shall identify and provide the support(s) required to implement any new curriculum, including professional development;\n\nRestructuring phase schools.\n\nAssessment of educational program. Each school shall participate in an assessment of the educational program by a joint intervention team appointed by the commissioner which shall include district representation and may include a distinguished educator.

A two year restructuring plan shall be developed and implemented by the district, focusing on the subgroup(s) for the accountability performance criterion and/or accountability indicator for which the school was identified. The district shall provide oversight and support for the plan, with the assistance of the Department. Such restructuring plan shall require the school to make fundamental reforms, such as significant changes in the staff, governance, or organization and may include a plan to close or phase out the school, and shall:\n\nbe formally approved by the board of education (in New York City, approved by the chancellor or chancellor's designee) no later than three months following the designation of the school in the Restructuring phase and also shall be subject to the approval of the commissioner; and\n\nbe implemented no later than the beginning of the next school year after the school year in which the school was identified or, to the extent practicable, immediately upon approval of the board of education if such approval occurs after the first day of regular school attendance.\n\nDistinguished educator. In addition to, and notwithstanding the provisions of, subclauses (1) and (2) of this clause, a school designated as Restructuring/Comprehensive shall cooperate with a distinguished educator assigned by the commissioner. The distinguished educator shall also provide oversight of the restructuring plan and shall serve as an ex-officio member of the board of education. All plans are subject to review by the distinguished educator who shall make recommendations to the board of education. The board shall implement such recommendations unless it obtains the commissioner’s approval otherwise.\n\nEach improvement, corrective action and restructuring plan, and each updated plan, shall be developed, to the extent appropriate, consistent with section 100.11 of this Title.\n\nThe commissioner may require that any plan, or subsequent modification of a plan, be submitted for prior approval.\n\nSupplemental education services. Each local educational agency that receives title I funds shall make supplemental education services available to eligible students who attend a school designated in Improvement, Corrective Action or Restructuring pursuant to this paragraph, consistent with section 120.4 of this Title.\n\nTitle I public school choice.
