        "text": "I start with this overview in order to ask two related fundamental questions – do we really need another book on boys’ education and what is it about boys that seems to have generated this interest (or some would say business) among academics, the general public and media in general?\n\nExtended editorial introduction to a double special issue on boys and schooling. Adopting a developmental perspective on boyhood, the editors frame these special issues on boys&#39; education by reviewing research on their experience of schooling. In particular, they endeavor to illuminate boys&#39; agency and opportunities they can find in schools for resistance to restrictive masculine regimes."
