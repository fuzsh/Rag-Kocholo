Up to 100 <strong>Victoria</strong>n government schools will be revamped with stateof-the-art design and technology and, statewide, schools will benefit from a $50 million maintenance funding boost under the new school building fund announced this week. The Building Tomorrow’s Schools Today Fund will be established from the sale of the Snowy River Hydro scheme and is aimed at transforming school infrastructure to meet the needs of the 21st century. Under the agreement, <strong>Victoria</strong> will sell its 29 per cent share of the renewable energy provider, worth more than $600 million, with the proceeds going towards environmental projects, a program to increase Snowy River flows and the school building fund.

Visiting design experts, the State Government and school communities have highlighted the importance of school design in catering for different learning styles. International design expert Prakash Nair, who recently worked with the Department of <strong>Education</strong> & Training’s regional directors, said page 8 school design could support and inspire student learning. “The reality is that the design of learning environments is a complex assignment,” he writes in his book The Language of School Design: Design Patterns for 21st Century Schools. “The ability to be creative is the essential ingredient for success in the 21st century.” Eastern Metropolitan Region regional director Dr Jim Watterston said contemporary education initiatives should focus on the development and implementation of a program of personalised learning for all students. “That will not happen for a child who sits all day behind a desk while sitting in rows with other students,” he said. “Schools and classrooms need to functionally promote exploration, collaboration and interest so, therefore, design is crucial. “Given space, relevant technology Print Post Approved PP336110/00002 ISSN 1323-5915 This newspaper can be recycled page 3 and flexibility, students can take their learning in unexpected and unconventional directions that will ensure engagement and excitement.” Dr Watterston said this week’s announcement of The Building Tomorrow’s Schools Today Fund provided schools with a world of opportunities. “The massive opportunity that has been presented with this huge investment of funds for school buildings will enable a large number of schools to have the unexpected opportunity to match their pedagogy with facilities that enhance and complement their work,” he said. “We have a chance to ‘think outside of the box’ to improve student learning in ways that have not previously been considered. “We can move tired and old facilities into a new era of learning spaces that will assist in maintaining <strong>Victoria</strong> at the cutting-edge of public school education in the western world.” Glen Waverley Secondary College in the Eastern Metropolitan Region, the Maryborough <strong>Education</strong> Centre and Strathmore Secondary College’s space science centre are among the innovative projects incorporating cutting-edge technology. Dr Watterston hoped to see more projects of this nature as a result of the new fund. “This fund will enable schools to reconsider their whole reason for being,” he said. “It will provide an opportunity to plan stimulating learning adventures in spaces that allow students to explore, create and develop. “This is a once-off opportunity that will excite teachers and school administrators while at the same time making an investment in public school education that will pay dividends for many generations to come.” Thumbs up: <strong>Education</strong> Services Minister Jacinta Allan, Member for Mount Waverley Maxine Morand, Premier Steve Bracks, <strong>Education</strong> and Training Minister Lynne Kosky and Innovation and State and Regional Development Minister John Brumby at this week’s announcement of the Building Tomorrow’s Schools Today Fund.
