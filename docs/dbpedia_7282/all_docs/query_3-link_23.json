        "text": "Welcome to the newsletter for week 5 of remote learning. Like you all, I am so pleased to be writing with the news that our return is now just around the corner. I am extremely grateful for the support of all the RGLPS families who have helped slow the spread of COVID – 19 by supporting a remote learning program that has allowed us to return to school earlier than expected. The Victorian Chief Health Officer has advised that it is now safe for students and teachers to return to school in a two staged approach and we continue to ask for your support to ensure that we keep our students, staff and community safe during this transitional time.\n\nBefore I continue I would like to thank the RGLPS staff for their dedication and commitment during this extremely challenging time. It has been amazing to step into a school and see such a swift transition into remote learning and I cannot underestimate the significant learnings that our staff have undertaken. While this has been a challenging and difficult time, it has also provided us with the opportunity to learn new ways of working with our students, our families, our colleagues and our communities. One of the exciting tasks ahead is to work together to ensure what we have learnt is captured and refined.\n\nSchools will commence a staged return from remote and flexible learning from Tuesday 26 May 2020.\n\nTo support all school staff to prepare for the transition, Monday 25 May will be a pupil-free day. This is important to enable the planning necessary to ensure the successful transition back to school can be completed.\n\nThe return to school will take place in two stages.\n\nStage 1: 25 May – 5 June\n\nIn the first stage, students in Prep, Grade 1 and Grade 2 will return to school from Tuesday 26 May.\n\nRemote and flexible learning will continue for all students in grades 3 to 6 until Tuesday 9 June.\n\nDuring Stage 1, the existing model of on-site schooling for students who cannot be supervised at home and vulnerable children will remain in place.\n\nStage 2: from 9 June\n\nAll other grades and year levels will return to school from Tuesday 9 June. All students will be expected to attend school as normal.\n\nThe greatest risk of transmission of COVID – 19 is between adults and as such we will be taking every precaution necessary to avoid close contact between adults. We believe that we can maintain safe drop off and pick up from school without staggering times if we follow some new safety requirements. We ask that all children with a surname commencing with the letters A – L use the front gate on Interlaken Parade and all children with a surname commencing with the letters M – Z use the back gate on Finlayson Street. We will monitor this and make alterations if they are necessary. Staff will be standing at the gate to support students into the school. The advice we have received from the Victorian Chief Health Medical Officer will also place restrictions on access to the school site for anyone other than immediate school staff and students. It is also important to avoid gathering in a group outside of the school. I thank you for your continued cooperation and patience.\n\nPlease note that enhanced cleaning of the school will remain in place for the remainder of term 2 and term 3. This will include frequent cleaning of high touch points and other surfaces throughout the day. Students will also be encouraged to wash their hands frequently and hand sanitizer will be available in all classrooms.\n\nWe will also stagger our break times to decrease the number of students using the grounds. To safely supervise students we will continue to have 90 minutes of break times for the students however, these will be staggered into shorter breaks across the school day.\n\nWhile our teachers are busy preparing a range of remote learning activities for students to complete, we understand that some students and families are coping with remote learning better than others. If your child is struggling or feeling overwhelmed, please make any necessary adjustments to the timing and amount of remote learning tasks that your child completes on a day to day basis. Given all the COVID-19 uncertainty, we understand that there are days when it will not be suitable for children to complete all the tasks assigned. As parents, you are in a better position to monitor your child’s wellbeing needs than teachers who are on the other end of a computer. Please use your parental judgment about when it might be appropriate to ease up on the remote schooling workload.\n\nTo support with some students feeling overwhelmed, teachers are now archiving Seesaw activities on a weekly basis to remove the backlog of incomplete activities your child sees when they login to Seesaw. This means that each week will start with a fresh batch of activities for that week.\n\nDear Parents,\n\nIt would appear that our students are fitness crazy! I am so proud to announce that we are currently coming FIRST IN AUSTRALIA for the RH Sports Fitness Challenge! Thank you to those parents who have encouraged their child to head out into the sunshine and do the activities. In case you have not seen the challenges, three of the activities are for two minutes (Basketball Bounce, Tennis Ball Wall Catch and Skipping Rope) and the final activity is how many metres can you walk/run in 20 minutes. The competition runs until the end of May and students may enter scores as many times per day as they like J It really is so wonderful to see our kids rallying around RGLPS during this time and having something to be part of and look forward to. The website is https://sites.google.com/view/rhsportsfitnesschallenge/home\n\nLet’s keep up the effort and win the free sports equipment for our school!\n\nMr Peters.\n\nPE and Sports Coordintor"
