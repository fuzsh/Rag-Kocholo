        "text": "PDB Art testimonial videos\n\nViewbank College, Melbourne\n\nIn the 2021 PDB Art project, Dr Onisha Patel from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research worked with teachers and students at Viewbank College, Melbourne to teach them about the importance of proteins and molecular structure. In this video, Onisha, along with teachers and students from Viewbank College, discuss the project and their experiences of using science to inspire art.\n\n2020 student testimonials\n\nIn this video, students involved in the 2020 PDB Art project discuss what they learnt and what inspired them in this project.\n\nQuotes:\n\nFrom students:\n\nI was surprised how you can make a scientific diagram more artistic.\n\nI think the exploratory nature of science and the curiosity that is involved in art, put together, make a really good combination.\n\nIt has made me consider the possibility of pursuing a career that combines art with science.\n\nI feel quite proud about seeing my art in an exhibition - I’ve never had that before.\n\nThe best part of the project was being able to have science and art together and not isolating each subject, having everything combined.\n\nUntil I did this project I wasn’t clear on how science and art were connected, I had never thought about it before - but this project opened my eyes.\n\nFrom teachers:\n\nThe project adds value to the student’s studies - by forging greater connections between Art and Science they strengthen the knowledge in both subjects.\n\nOne student went on to study Biology and has combined this with her artistic interests.\n\nFrom the public:\n\nExcellent work - Fusion of art and science. What a great collaboration.\n\nVery visually stunning, but also really interesting ideas behind some of the pieces! Love it.\n\nSo much talent! I wish I'd had the opportunity to do a project like this when I was doing Arts at school. Keep up the good work!"
