        "text": "Andy Ellison, President and CEO\n\nWhat kind of person opens a new bank in 2008 as the American economy was descending into the Great Recession?\n\nAnswer: A person not afraid of hard work, who believes deeply in the community and building a strong team; a leader with a vision to create more than a bank for clients and those who choose to be part of this new venture of Mountain View Bank of Commerce.\n\nSo the story begins… Colorado native and CU-Boulder graduate, Andy Ellison – along with Stephen Faillaci-- teamed up in 2006 to embrace a dream in spite of many challenges raising $8-million dollars in initial capital to launch Mountain View Bank of Commerce.\n\n“I knew early on that we could serve our clients in many ways in addition to banking,” Andy says. “We’re able to give advice and direction on a number of topics, especially financial guidance. Mountain View is here to do more, to be more – that’s our responsibility as a community bank.”\n\nWith hard work and quality service has come reward; Mountain View grew through the Great Recession, doubled in size over the past five years, and looks to double again in the next five. To accommodate this growth, Mountain View moved to a new home at 120th Avenue and Pecos in Westminster with more space in a great location to provide our individualized service to even more clients.\n\nMountain View’s community service has also flourished over the years. Andy speaks with pride about the bank’s Make A Difference (MAD) days where the staff, divided into three teams, donates half-a-day, twice a year – while on the clock – to give back, “We’ve worked on behalf of kids, the elderly, animal causes – you name it, our people have lent a helping hand to non-profits region-wide.”\n\nIn 2018, An opportunity arose that is especially close to Andy’s heart. “We worked with CU-Boulder and Realities for Children Boulder County to provide a full-ride scholarship for a young woman living in foster care who otherwise would not even be considering college. I’m so proud that the bank can help change the future for this young lady and her family for generations to come. I want to do more of that, where Mountain View can make a true difference in peoples’ lives.”\n\nAndy and Mountain View have both grown in the last 10 years, and his current focus is how best to help his team members become better leaders. “I want to build something that will outlast me, that everyone can be proud of for decades to come. My passion is to develop team members’ leadership skills to provide the best service possible to our clients . . . to always be looking for ways to make real contributions.”"
