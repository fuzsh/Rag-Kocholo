        "text": "An atmospheric collection characterised by cathartic confessionals, the Like A Prayer album still held space for Cherish, a breezy pop cut that became one of Madonna’s most-loved singalongs. The “Queen Of Pop”, however, has since revealed her own reservations about its durability, even as fans continue to hold it close to their hearts…\n\nListen to the best of Madonna here.\n\nMadonna’s song Cherish has an uncertain genesis\n\nWhat we do know about Cherish is that it is co-credited to Madonna and Patrick Leonard. The Michigan-born producer had already helmed the success of the “Queen Of Pop”’s megahit 1986 album, True Blue, and he was back on a similar brief for 1989’s Like A Prayer.\n\nBest Madonna Albums: Her Studio Discography, Ranked, Reviewed\n\nMadonna Album Covers: All 14 Studio Artworks, Ranked And Reviewed\n\nMadonna’s Super Bowl Halftime Show: The Full Story\n\nMadonna has said she wrote Cherish “in a superhyper-positive state of mind that I knew was not going to last”, and it’s likely that she first worked on the track in 1988, when she was appearing on Broadway in David Mamet’s Hollywood satire, Speed-The-Plow. With her marriage to Sean Penn coming under strain and certain critics challenging Madonna’s move into acting, she may have been right about her fleeting mindset at the time, yet Like A Prayer would emerge as an artistic triumph that gave a two-finger salute to the naysayers while asserting its creator as an artist who could be measured in a broader context than just her phenomenal record sales.\n\nCherish was a production triumph from Patrick Leonard\n\nAlthough Like A Prayer offered some majestic pop highs – not least its anthemic title track – the album is anchored by many reflective, sombre moments. With obvious inspiration from the doo-wop standards of the 50s and the tight harmonies of the 60s girl groups, Cherish has an upbeat, simplistic lyric and a razor-sharp melody that offers considerable light in an album of shade.\n\nSynths, keyboards and even the obligatory 80s saxophone all build on the sugary track, which provides clear evidence of the importance of production to the best Madonna songs. The “Queen Of Pop” has an instinctive grasp of how to hit the crowd-pleasing marks, but the layered production hooks of a maestro such as Patrick Leonard create a package that’s often greater than the sum of its parts. The pair had an easy working partnership, and Leonard has revealed how fast things fell into place in the studio.\n\n“I would put something together, usually just on piano, and then she would come in at about 11, we’d mess around with whatever needed to be messed around with, she’d write a lyric, she’d sing it, and the next day we would do another song, one a day,” he told Music Business Worldwide. “She didn’t sing the songs on Like A Prayer more than once, ever. There were no re-takes, there was the demo vocal and that was the record. It was absolutely extraordinary.”\n\nCherish was a global smash hit\n\nReleased on 1 August 1989, Cherish was the third single lifted from Like A Prayer, and it vaulted up the Billboard Hot 100, landing at No.2 while also topping the US adult contemporary listings (Madonna would become the top singles artist of that chart in 1989). In the UK, the song peaked at No.3, and it went Top 5 elsewhere in Europe and Australia. Although Cherish was cut to four minutes for single release, an extended mix was also issued, stretching the track to a little over six minutes.\n\nIn markets where physical sales still drove chart performance, the idea of issuing an unreleased song as the single’s B-side was a canny one – Supernatural had been recorded for Like A Prayer but was eventually left off the tracklist. The funky cut would later feature on the HIV and AIDS fundraising album Red Hot + Dance. Cherish also appeared as a collectable 12” picture disc in the UK and is one of Madonna’s rarer records.\n\nA famous photographer directed the Cherish promo video\n\nThe late Herb Ritts had photographed the True Blue album cover and worked extensively with Madonna in the mid-80s. The “Queen Of Pop” persuaded him to put down his regular camera and try the moving image instead for Cherish, and Ritts’ black-and-white masterpiece, featuring the singer amid a shoal of mermen, led to more music-video commissions for, among other stars, Chris Isaak (Wicked Game) and Tina Turner (Way Of The World).\n\nOne of the best Madonna promo videos, the clip was filmed on a freezing-cold Paradise Cove Beach, in Malibu, California, in July 1989, but, despite the chilly conditions, there was a noticeable warmth between Madonna and one of the models. The star would go on to date merman Tony Ward, and he would appear in the following year’s controversial Justify My Love video.\n\nCherish has rarely been performed live\n\nAlthough it endures longer than the “Queen Of Pop” may herself have imagined, Cherish has only been performed live by Madonna on one tour, appearing in the setlist for the legendary Blond Ambition Tour of 1990, in a sequence that recreated the mermen concept of the video. Despite remaining a firm fan favourite, there wasn’t a sign of it during her greatest-hits tour, Celebration, of 2023 to 2024, and there might be a reason for this.\n\n“The songs that I think are the most retarded songs I’ve written, like Cherish… end up being the biggest hits,” Madonna once said. With as many hits as she has had, she is allowed to let the odd one slide.\n\nBuy Madonna box sets, vinyl and more at the Dig! store."
