My parents' response was to buy me a Star of David only slightly smaller than the hood ornament on our Buick.      A cross, as any fan in the early 1980's knew, was the essential accouterment of those determined to dress like Madonna. But I was 8 and not brazen enough to borrow one surreptitiously from a friend. I was also vaguely concerned about being struck down by a higher power. To make matters worse, I was not permitted to wear black, the color Madonna donned from head to toe in her ''Lucky Star'' music video. (''There will be plenty of time to wear black when you're an adult,'' my mother said.) When I tied my hair back with a scrap of fabric, as Madonna often did, my mother employed the Yiddish word for rag and advised, ''Take that shmatte off your head.''",

My parents' response was to buy me a Star of David only slightly smaller than the hood ornament on our Buick.\n\nA cross, as any fan in the early 1980's knew, was the essential accouterment of those determined to dress like Madonna. But I was 8 and not brazen enough to borrow one surreptitiously from a friend. I was also vaguely concerned about being struck down by a higher power. To make matters worse, I was not permitted to wear black, the color Madonna donned from head to toe in her \"Lucky Star\" music video. (\"There will be plenty of time to wear black when you're an adult,\" my mother said.) When I tied my hair back with a scrap of fabric, as Madonna often did, my mother employed the Yiddish word for rag and advised, \"Take that shmatte off your head.\"\n\nHence my devotion to Madonna was expressed solely in my bedroom, that pastel cocoon of wicker and whispers where I danced among the Cabbage Patch Kids and sang \"Like a Virgin.\" Never mind that I didn't know what a virgin was. When I danced to Madonna, I felt as if I were 18, not 8.\n\nLike countless girls of my generation, I was captivated by her style (the fingerless gloves, the navel-baring shirts, the armloads of bracelets, the forbidden cross) and awed by her cocky defiance of gender conventions. Never had we seen someone so bold, so powerful, so sexually aggressive who was not a man. At times she was crass. At times she was mean. But she made us consider the kind of women we wanted to be.\n\nOn Tuesday, Madonna's 10th studio album, \"Confessions on a Dance Floor,\" will be released in the United States. MTV's Web site began playing an advance copy late last week and last month the station showed the premiere of \"I'm Going to Tell You a Secret,\" a documentary about Madonna's 2004 Re-Invention world tour and trip to Israel. Visitors to the recently revamped Madonna.com site can find links to her new MySpace.com page and a toll-free number to call and confess their \"secrets.\"\n\nHere's mine: after more than 20 years of discovering unsung heroes in the women around me -- mentors and friends who are tough and sexy in ways that do not require peroxide and cone bras -- I still love Madonna.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
