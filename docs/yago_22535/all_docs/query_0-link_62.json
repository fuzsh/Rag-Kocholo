        "text": "The faces started appearing one by one on the huge video screens as the solemn intro of “Live to Tell” started to play.\n\nAll people Madonna knew and loved. Who had died of AIDS.\n\nAs she sang, the screens started zooming out to show more and more faces of people with AIDS, until it became a sea of faces—not famous people with the disease, just people.\n\nAnd then those faces faded gently away before a dedication “to all the bright lights” lost to the disease.\n\nMadonna came up in the club scene of New York City in the early 1980s, when the sound of the decade was still forming itself.\n\nDuring her recent Celebration Tour, I watched her tear through some of these early hits: “Everybody,” “Burning Up,” and “Into the Groove.”\n\nFor “Holiday,” the mood suddenly turned dark.\n\n…the song ended with one lone dancer left lying on the floor, covered with a jacket.\n\nThis must have been what it was like to be part of that club scene in the ‘80s.\n\nPeople getting sick with a mysterious disease, named by those four infamous letters, and dying.\n\nMadonna knew her share of people who succumbed to AIDS—friends, mentors and cocreators.\n\nIt was powerful and moving to see her segue from performing her club songs, to paying tribute to the people who vanished from the scene she came up in.\n\nTake a look at the lyrics of “Live To Tell.” Words like:\n\nHope I live to tell\n\nThe secret I have learned\n\nTil then it will burn inside of me\n\nAnd:\n\nWill it grow cold\n\nThe secret that I hide?\n\nWill I grow old?\n\nTo be able to turn those lyrics around and tell the story of people with a then-fatal disease, who often stayed in the closet in shame and were pariahs after they came out, was extraordinary and deeply human.\n\nI’m a little too young to have lived in the fear those gay men felt in the club scene in the ‘80s.\n\nBut I do remember it happening.\n\nPeople thought they could get infected from toilet seats. Some funeral homes wouldn’t take bodies with the infection.\n\nPeople with AIDS often were ostracized from their families, shamed for who they loved and for having the disease that would kill them.\n\nBut we should never forget our forebears and the price they paid in trying to build a better future.\n\nIn contrast with the dark queer history in “Live to Tell,” Madonna’s performance of “Vogue” that night was a queer celebration.\n\nThere were videos showing all manner of LGBTQ celebrations and protests. It was a beautiful nod to the start of voguing in ballroom culture.\n\nSince 1990, there’s been controversy over cultural appropriation in “Vogue.”\n\nI understand all that. But when that song came out, I had no way of knowing about ballroom culture or any of that.\n\nI was a gay kid on the edge of turning 16 with no self-awareness, waiting in my bedroom for the song to come on the radio so I could mimic Madonna’s poses in the mirror.\n\nI didn’t know what it meant—what moved me to dance like that.\n\nAnd that there was a place for people like me who could (badly) dance and strike a pose. That song was a burst of joy, some strange magic, and I can still feel that decades after I figured myself out.\n\nFor a few hours, with thousands of other people dancing around me, it was as if Madonna was telling us:\n\nLet the author know that you liked their article with a “Green Thumb” Upvote!\n\nViews: 156"
