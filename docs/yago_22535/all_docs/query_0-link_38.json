        "text": "Credits\n\nWritten by Madonna and Mirwais Ahmadzaï\n\nProduced by Madonna and Mirwais Ahmadzaï\n\nProgramming and keyboards by Mirwais Ahmadzaï\n\nMusic shares an almost identical beat with 'Never Young Again', a song that features on Mirwais' album Production.\n\nAlbum\n\nSingle\n\nThe lead-off single from the Music album was released worldwide on August 21, 2000. It immediately conquered the charts and became #1 in 25 countries, including the US, UK, Canada, Australia and Italy. It's Madonna's twelfth and most recent #1 in the US Billboard Hot 100, confirming her once again as the best selling female artist ever.\n\nThe single was also Madonna's longest running dance hit, holding on for 5 consecutive weeks to the #1 spot of the Hot Dance chart. Music was certified Platinum, selling over a million copies (her fourth platinum single in the US). It received nominations for 'Record of the Year' and 'Best Female Pop Vocal Performance' at the 2001 Grammy Awards.\n\nThe release of the single and the album was pushed back because of Madonna's pregnancy with Rocco. However, on May 27, 2000 an illegal copy of the song leaked onto the Internet (her first of many to suffer this fate). In a few days it spread all over the web through forums and Napster. Madonna's spokesperson Liz Rosenberg reacted that the material was \"stolen work in progress\", though the final version mostly resembled the leaked demo.\n\nThis single gave fans a good impression of Madonna's new style. With collaborator Mirwais she experimented with electronica-beats and vocoders. Funny detail, the male-sounding voice in the beginning of the song is in fact Madonna's voice heavily transformed.\n\nVideo\n\nThe video was shot in LA by Swedish director Jonas Åkerlund and premiered on MTV and VH1 on August 22, 2000. It features Madonna in a fur coat, with cowboy hat and golden medal, together with friends Niki Haris and Debi Mazar. The girls are escorted in a golden limousine, driven by British comic Ali G. He takes them to a club, where the girls enjoy a female strip act.\n\nHowever inconsequent with other music videos, MTV censored out parts of this strip act. In the middle of the song there's an animated part with Madonna as some kind of superwoman, flying through the sky, trashing her old song titles and DJ-ing at a party. Reason for the inclusion of this animation (and the reason why Madonna's seen sitting most of the time) was probably to hide her pregnancy.\n\nTour\n\nAfter a stunning 90 minutes show, ending with a steaming Holiday, Madonna gave the audience Music as encore. She, Niki and Donna danced from corner to corner, then the whole dancing crew gave a magnificent dance show, resembling the Grammies 2001 performance. 'Here we go!' Mo shouted as they all started doing deep-knee bends (16 in a row!), while the crowd danced under a rain of golden snippets. Maddy knows how to end a show in style!\n\nHoliday and Music were such a perfect ending of the Drowned World Tour that Madonna decided to place them again together at the end of the setlist for the Re-Invention Tour. This time Music came first, with Madonna in her Scottish kilt climbing on top of a cubicle staircase, which hosted Stuart Price as the DJ in the middle. Price re-invented the song into a cool remix. Naturally there was a groovy dance routine with all of the dancers.\n\nMadonna opened the last segment of the Confessions Tour with mixing The Trammps' 'Disco Inferno' with her own Music, turning it into the hedonistic Music Inferno. After a montage of old videos and an intro with rollerskating dancers, Madonna appears on stage in a classy white suit, channeling the legendary Tony Manero character, played by John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever. She dances her way to the end of the catwalk and does the famous disco guns choreography while the rollerskaters do amazing tricks. A vocoder plays the chorus of Where's The Party and the whole audience gets boogie'ing to the infectious beat. Definitely a highlight of the show for many fans!\n\nMusic is the only song that was included in all first 4 tours of the Millennium. Fitting the theme of the Old School segment on the Sticky & Sweet Tour, the vibe for Music got very 'Street'. After the introduction with a sample of 'Last Night a DJ Saved My Life', we're served to a mash-up of Music and Fedde le Grand's 2006 club hit 'Put Your Hands Up For Detroit'. The screens open up like giant doors of a metro and belt out a horde of dancers who join Madonna in a high energy dance routine. All are wearing colourful outfits; Madonna looks very street too in her purple hotpants and rainbow belt. As she sings one of the 'never wanna stop' lines, the music stops abruptly and Madonna screams orgasmically \"Please don't stop!\" Then they continue in a fast pace towards a grand finale. Except that it's only halfway through the show..."
