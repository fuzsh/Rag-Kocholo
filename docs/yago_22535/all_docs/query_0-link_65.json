        "text": "Ooo, I love questionnaires!\n\nFAVOURITE SONG\n\nThere's loads but in the end it has to be Like A Prayer. I keep coming back to it and it still amazes me.\n\nMOST LOATHED SINGLE\n\nLove Don't Live Here Anymore.\n\nI don't hate it, I don't think there's a Madonna-single I do hate, but it's one of the few I'm extremely indifferent about. And the others are originals so this one loses..\n\nOh, I forgot about Bedtime Story.. that one doesn't do a thing for me at all.. but at least it got a nice vid and was original.\n\nFAVOURITE ALBUM\n\nAmerican Life. No doubt about it.\n\nMOST HATED ALBUM\n\nDoes Evita count? It's not neccesarily bad but I can't really listen to it as a whole.\n\nOtherwise I'm Breathless, same story..\n\nFAVOURITE/WORST VIDEO\n\nFavourite: Like A Prayer\n\nWorst: Again Love Don't Live Here Anymore comes to mind. It's just bland. There might be worse offenders but this one came to mind. Though it might seem that way I don't have much against the song though!\n\nFAVE ALBUM SLEEVE/WORST ALBUM SLEEVE\n\nFavourite: She has quite a few epic ones! I loved all albumart for Confessions, the logo, pics in the limited edition, brilliant.\n\nWorst: Hard Candy. It has grown on me a bit but compared to her past ones it's not all that.\n\nFAVE IMAGE AND ERA\n\nAs mentioned earlier I loved the Confessions-look, but later down the campaign it lost it's brilliance. Overall I think the Ray Of Light-one was the most consistant era.\n\nHer infront of the burning crosses in Like A Prayer will remain the ultimate video-image though.\n\nFAVE MOVIE/WORST MOVIE\n\nI think Evita's the only Madonna-movie I ever saw.. o, plus her two docus..\n\nOut of those I'd say In Bed With..'s the best, and Evita's the worst. (It was beautifully made but after about 30 minutes I got tired of them bursting into singing every other second, though I usually like musical movies).\n\nMOST UNDERRATED/OVERRATED SONG\n\nI'll limit this to singles, because otherwise I'll be spending ages..\n\nUnderrated: Burning Up, Dress You Up, This Used To Be My Playground, You'll See, Human Nature, The Power Of Goodbye, Love Profusion\n\nOverrated: Holiday, Justify My Love, Take A Bow, Ray Of Light, Music\n\nFAVE BALLAD/ WORST BALLAD\n\nFavourite: Nothing Fails and Crazy For You. All American Life-ballads were pretty damn great. You'll See is criminally underrated as well.\n\nWorst: Love Don't Live Here Anymore again??\n\nThere's probably a few 'non-songs' on Evita as well, and I'm probably overlooking some bland albumtrack.\n\nFAVE CONTROVERSY\n\nVery hard. I don't really rate controversy for the sake of it...\n\nI guess the real question is: favourite action that caused controversy..\n\nThat would be the original American Life-video, it was brilliant. But I didn't like the reason it had to be cancelled, and I don't rate the fact it's controversial.. I just like the video a lot.\n\nI guess I can't really answer the question.\n\nFAVOURITE TOUR\n\nReinvention, hands down.\n\nFAVOURITE SONG\n\nHung Up. While I adore her older stuff, and the slow ones, this song is just so infectiously fun that it makes me happy every single time it comes on. You can't ask for much more from a song than that, really. And also, at a time when everyone was ready to write her off, she came back and blew everyone away.\n\nMOST LOATHED SINGLE\n\nHate is a strong word, but I can't stand Dear Jessie. Or American Pie (dire)\n\nFAVOURITE ALBUM\n\nAmerican Life - it has somehow gotten better with age, and I don't think I'll ever get bored of it. The fact that it's so underrated is both a shame and cool that it's a bit of a secret gem, loved by the people that have actually gotten into it. Although Music comes very close.\n\nMOST HATED ALBUM\n\nI'm Breathless is pretty crap.\n\nFAVOURITE/WORST VIDEO\n\nFavourite: Frozen - it's so simple but captures the song perfectly, and was an amazing way to kick off a brilliant campaign.\n\nWorst: I'm not a fan of live videos and she's had a fair whack of them.\n\nFAVE ALBUM SLEEVE/WORST ALBUM SLEEVE\n\nFavourite: Confessions is a perfect depiction of the disconess that lies within\n\nWorst: Something To Remember and Bedtime Stories are really dull.\n\nFAVE IMAGE AND ERA\n\nVogueing - she looked stunning, and the whole image took on a life of its own which I love. Although in more recent terms - her on the Dance Dance Revolution showing the dancers how it's done is also very amazing.\n\nI loved Ray Of Light as an era on the whole, it seems so fresh and natural.\n\nFAVE MOVIE/WORST MOVIE\n\nDoes Truth Or Dare count? Because it's my favourite, by a mile. I've seen Swept Away and it is indeed, foul.\n\nMOST UNDERRATED/OVERRATED SONG\n\nImpressive Instant, Nothing Fails and X-Static Process are sorely underrated.\n\nHoliday and Ray of Light are not as biblically amazing as many make them out to be.\n\nFAVE BALLAD/ WORST BALLAD\n\nFavourite: Nothing Fails, although I love Drowned World/Substitute For Love and Frozen.\n\nWorst: Well I cannot stand Voices, anyway. And the Evita stuff.\n\nFAVE CONTROVERSY\n\nI'm not too sure - a lot of people brand her as 'controversial' when she really isn't being so, like saying her outfits are controversial (snore). I did love it in Truth Or Dare when they got threatened for the sexual content and she didn't give a shit.\n\nFAVOURITE TOUR\n\nConfessions for style, Reinvention for substance.\n\nThat was not easy!"
