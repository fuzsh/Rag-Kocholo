DavidEye]\n\nAaronSuperior\n\nFlyingCloudPassenger said:\n\nHmmm, interesting. I never knew she'd have so many unreleased stuff.\n\nOne that stands out is \"By Alien Means\" (1988) written and produced by PRINCE , what's this one like? I never heard about this one.\n\nMust have been done around the time of Love Song, may have that bad ass Camille sound...!\n\nAnyone want to describe it or something?\n\nAnd funny but a while back, I think before the internet, I heard about Funk Of A THousand Years...and I thought, man, that must be an awesome song! But never heard from that until this thread, weird.\n\nFunk Of A Thousand Years is one of the supposed Madonna/Prince tracks that was going to be in From Dusk Til Dawn. It wasn't. It was confirmed false by PP employees, as a joke that another PP employee had started in Prince circles. I had passed this tidbit on to the madonnacatalog site, and it was included there for years (it may still be) until I corrected it.\n\nBy Alien Means is a Prince track from around 1988/1989, and he supposedly gave it to her after seeing her Blond Ambition show in 1990. I believe, at the time, it was either going to be a one-off single (or various artists compiliation track). The rumor of it resurfaced again for the Erotica album.\n\nFrom what I've gathered, no Prince fan or Madonna fan has ever heard the song, in any form (as either a Prince or Madonna outtake).\n\nAaronMaximus\n\nDavidEye said:\n\n\"Laugh To Keep from Crying\" (1980)\n\n\"Crimes Of Passion\" (1980)\n\n\"Ain't No Big Deal\"(1982) demo version\n\n'Stay\" (1982) demo version\n\nreleased on Pre-Madonna (and In The Beginning)\n\n\"Shake Your Head\"(1982)\n\ni believe it's actually \"Bang Your Head (Let's Go To Bed)\" and it was with Ozzy Osbourne. i *believe* this came out as a duet between Ozzy and someone like Lita Ford, but i'm not sure.\n\n\"Sidewalk Talk\" (1983) demo version\n\nturned up later as a Jellybean track, with Madonna and Catherine Buchanan on vocals\n\n\"Desperately Seeking Susan\" (1984) unreleased song recorded for the movie of the same name\n\nfalse. this refers only to Into The Groove. and even incorrectly at that, as she had written the song for another singer (with the title of \"Get Into The Groove\") before she was going to use it as her own.\n\n\"Warning Signs\" (1984) recorded for the 'Vision Quest' soundtrack\n\nand another song \"Lies In Your Eyes\". both have been available on bootlegs, though one of them sounds to have another singer doing lead vocals.\n\n\"Spotlight\" demo (1987)\n\nactually, this is from 1986. it was a True Blue outtake that got remixed by Jellybean for YCD.\n\n\"By Alien Means\" (1988) written and produced by PRINCE\n\nMadonna's version is post-1990, though. the story that goes along with it is that he gave it to her after seeing Blond Ambition.\n\n\"Love Song\" with Prince (demo) (1988)\n\ni imagine that the demo refers to whatever tape Prince gave her to work on initially. they traded it back and forth over the months, until it was complete. there probably isn't an actual \"demo\" of them doing it together, as they never worked on it in the studio together.\n\n\"Possessive Love\" (1988) offered to Marilynn Martin\n\nreleased, i believe.\n\n\"Dog House\" (1989) outtake from 'I'm Breathless' project\n\nwas inspired by Brenda Lee's track from the *other* Dick Tracy soundtrack that was out at the time. \"You're In The Dog House\" it was called, i think.\n\n\"Vogue\" (1989) demo contains controversial lyrics\n\nhas a \"doesn't matter if you're straight or gay\" instead of \"black or white\"\n\n\"Dick Tracy\" (1989) outtake from 'I'm Breathless' project\n\ndon't know about this. she does sing a completely different, Stephen Sondheim version of \"Back In Business\" in the film, though.\n\n\"Get Over\" (1991) offered to Nick Scotti\n\nand released by him, also.\n\n\"Erotica\" demo (1992) has a darker S&M theme than the released version\n\nmost likely the one with alternate lyrics that came with the Sex book.\n\n\"Goodbye To Innocence\" (1992)\n\nreleased on \"Just Say Roe\" .. and turned up as a b-side for Secret in Mexico, i think. is the basis for \"Up Down Suite\"\n\n\"Queens Pearls\" (1992)\n\nis this the Jose & Luis track? or was that \"Queen's English\". or something like that. i have a remix of their song that she gave them on some rare Maverick promo sampler, that has background vocals by Madonna.\n\n\"These Boots Are Made For Walking\" (1992)\n\ndon't believe this was ever recorded. it was intended for 1993, and she had a whole campaign planned around it, but Billy Ray Cyrus came out with his version just as she was getting ready to do it. she was extremely pissed and scrapped the whole thing.\n\n\"This Used To Be My Playground\" demo (1992)\n\nthere's also the movie version, approx. 7 minutes long. the instrumental of the movie version showed up on the import CD single, but alas, the beautiful full length vocal version has never been released.\n\n\"Jitterbug\" (1992)\n\nrefers only to her scene dancing the jitterbug in A League Of Their Own\n\n\"Just A Dream\" (1993)\n\ngiven to Donna Deloray, I believe. and released. I believe.\n\n\"\"I'd Ratha Be Yo' Lover\" (1994) an alternate version of \"I'd Rather Be Your Lover\" features a rap by Tupac Shakur\n\nsome say this is a fake.\n\n\"Love Won't Wait\" (1994)\n\ngiven to, and released by, Gary Barlow.\n\n\"Freedom\"(1994)\n\non the Carnival! various artists album.\n\n\"Something's Coming Over Me\" (1994) early version of \"Secret\"\n\nthe original version she wrote with Shep Pettibone, i imagine.\n\n\"I Want You\" remix (1997) unrleased remix by Junior Vasquez\n\nbut very very easy to find, in both full length and edit form on any filesharing service.\n\n\"Love Won't Wait (remix) (1997)\n\ni think it's a remix of the Gary Barlow version.\n\n\"To Have And Not To Hold\" remix by Goldie (1998)\n\nseriously doubt that. he was one of those pricks going around in 1998 telling anybody who'd listen that he'd turned her down to work on the album or remixes.\n\nthere is, however a track that she did with... ummm... what was his name. Robert Miles? he did that track \"Children\" in approx. 1996. Sky Fits Heaven sounds a lot like it.\n\n\"Can't You See My Mind\" (2002)\n\nthis is a completely different song. one in her stable of remix DJ's (i forget who, probably Rauhofer or Calderone) mentioned that he was doing a remix for this song. and that it wasn't Die Another Day\n\n\"Forbidden Fruit\" (2002) offered to Jessica Simpson\n\nand to be released on her forthcoming album.\n\nalso, there's that track she gave to Kylie for a b-side that never did turn up. forget the title though.\n\n[This message was edited Tue Sep 9 23:25:46 PDT 2003 by AaronMaximus]\n\n[This message was edited Tue Sep 9 23:27:33 PDT 2003 by AaronMaximus]"
