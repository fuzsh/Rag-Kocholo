I thought the hook of the song is very catchy and the layer of accoustic guitar in the song adds a touch of poignancy.\n\nPost by prenatt1166 on\n\nUU-BRU Internet Radio\n\nFor Week Ending November 5, 1994[/color]\n\n(Rank This Week, Last Week, Artist, Title)\n\n01 01 Boyz II Men - I'll Make Love To You\n\n02 03 Madonna - Secret\n\n03 08 Eagles - Get Over It\n\n04 05 Gloria Estefan - Turn The Beat Around\n\n05 06 Bon Jovi - Always\n\n06 02 Sheryl Crow - All I Wanna Do\n\n07 07 Elton John - Circle Of Life\n\n08 04 Luther Vandross & Mariah Carey - Endless Love\n\n09 11 Pretenders - I'll Stand By You\n\n10 10 4PM - Sukiyaki\n\n\"Secret\" spent 3 weeks at #2, landing at #17 for 1994.\n\nwww.keystonehighways.com/uubru1994.html\n\n\"Secret\" is one of 13 songs by Madonna to peak at #2 on my chart. No other act has peaked at #2 with more than 4 times.\n\nwww.keystonehighways.com/uubruhistory.com\n\n:)\n\nPost by blfdguy1 on\n\n\"Secret\" was Madonna's 14th of 21 #1's on my chart. Love the song, love the video and the remix is hot, too!\n\nNovember 5, 1994\n\n01 02 Secret - Madonna\n\n02 01 100% Pure Love - Crystal Waters\n\n03 03 I'm The Only One - Melissa Etheridge\n\n04 06 I'll Stand By You - Pretenders\n\n05 07 Turn The Beat Around - Gloria Estefan\n\n06 04 Basket Case - Green Day\n\n07 08 You Gotta Be - Desree\n\n08 11 I Alone - Live\n\n09 12 Interstate Love Song - STP\n\n10 14 Another Night - Real McCoy\n\n\"Secret\" spent 6 weeks at #1, but I can't find my yearend chart for 1994 :( but did sneak in at #97 for 1995\n\nPost by halo19 on\n\nNot my fav. Madonna single, but this would probably be in a top 10 list if I had one. One of the few songs that I can say that I recall from when they were released that is from around 10 years or longer ago.\n\nPost by crash46 on\n\nThis is probably the first Madonna song that I really enjoyed (I also like \"This Used To Be My Playground\", but I actually heard \"Secret\" first). Just about all her songs from here on out have been nothing short of excellent. Just about.\n\nDidn't this song move like 30-8 in its second week? I got sick of her songs doing that so often. The radio would slam her songs at me non stop and I'd be burned out on them before I could give myself a fair chance to like them.\n\nPost by ðŸ…³ðŸ…¸ðŸ†‚ðŸ…²ðŸ…¾ on\n\nThis song was really well-done. Madonna's voice was amazing. That guitar in the song is a real focal point. And the mid-tempo beat.\n\nAnd that black and white video was a lot of fun.\n\nJunior Vasquez's remixes were excellent.\n\nPost by bubblepop15 on\n\nI hate when people start talking about singers moving on to new project so early.\n\nI haven't even heard COADF, but I love Madonna's R&B sound.\n\nI don't think she would ever do another R&B record...\n\nThis song is on fiyah\n\nPost by Ky on\n\nzak said:\n\nOne of Madonna's best tracks, its so smooth. I'm suprised it was a first single though as its very kind of low-key\n\nI really couldn't appreciate a low-key song as much back then. I didn't dislike it. Now I really like it.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nAwesome song, and it shot from 30-9-4 and peaked at 3 in the US.\n\ncrash46 said:\n\nThis is probably the first Madonna song that I really enjoyed (I also like \"This Used To Be My Playground\", but I actually heard \"Secret\" first).

I used to like her a lot, but I can barely stand her now.\n\nAnd more than 4 years since I posted this topic. Time really flies.\n\nPost by esoteric76 on\n\nThis and Frozen are like sister tracks, with Frozen being the slightly darker, gothic-lite sister. (or whatever I'm trying to say).\n\nI remember being obsessed with Secret when it came out, and listening to it and the remixes endlessly. It has aged really well."
