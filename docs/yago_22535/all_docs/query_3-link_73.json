        "text": "What an exceptional first write-up and accompanying graphic @RJF. If this is an indication of what is to come, we are in for a deeply satisfying couple of months!\n\n@Pop Life opens their excellent post with a good point about the context of this album and the consumption of it - 'you had to be there' indeed. (As a sidenote, the reference to longboxes made me laugh. How strange to think of that transitional period where CDs had to be packaged in dimensions similar to their vinyl counterparts to make the new format more familiar. Here we are some three decades later and a non-physical format is the most popular way to listen to new music. Madonna's career as a recording artist has traversed all of this). It speaks volumes about the quality of her output that Madonna has collected fans at different points during her 40 years, but I do wonder if the older albums will be less readily embraced by younger ears simply because the music reflects a time furthest removed. I will have a lot of thoughts on 'Like A Virgin' when that inevitable early elimination comes.\n\n'I'm Breathless' is not an album I return to often, but it is a pleasant experience when I do and I can happily listen to it from start to finish which I cannot say about 'MDNA'. The Sondheim connection is quite incredible in retrospect, an indication of how Madonna's then unmatched celebrity status enraptured literally everyone she came in contact with. Outside of the immortal 'Vogue', 'Sooner Or Later' is the best song as Madonna steps into the role of smoky torch singer with surprising aplomb. @Maki mentions this album having less of Madonna's individual stamp than others, which rightly places it at the back end of the rate, but I give full credit to how impressive the Ciccone/Leonard collaboration was here. They pivoted from the adult pop of 'Like A Prayer', already a clear progression of their skills, to a postmodern simulacra of 1930s jazz and swing with ease. The songs fit the brief of the 'Dick Tracy' project perfectly, delivering half their originals in hypersaturated cartoony technicolor ('Hanky Panky', 'Cry Baby') and the rest in a very convincing evocation of the era. 'He's A Man' conjures some genuine drama over its nearly five-minute length, whilst the languid (if slightly meandering) 'Something To Remember' is deserving of the second life it received later in the decade on the compilation of the same name.\n\nAnd of course, 'Now I'm Following You (Part II)' gave us this deliciously absurd remix coda:\n\n'Dick, that's an interesting name.\n\nDick. Dick. Dick-dick-dick-dick-dick...\n\nMy bottom hurts just thinking about it!'\n\nNext level allyship!\n\nx\n\nI knew this would exit first (although I would have been fine with MDNA as well) but it does house ‘Vogue’, and I’m partial to ‘Something to Remember’, ‘Hanky Panky’ and ‘Sooner or Later’. The rest can rot.\n\nI remember when I was a baby gay and first discovering her discography and being a bit obsessed with this one though. I even wrote this strange, fan-fictionesque story that starred my group of friends. The main villain was one of my besties, and I had her sing ‘Back in Business’ with her army of raptors (??) during our climactic showdown. Note that I had not done drugs at this point. I even made a burnt CD as a sort of soundtrack with that one on there. I wonder if any of them still have a copy somewhere…\n\nBut yes. I think the most interesting thing about this album is that it displays the absolute power she was wielding at that time. To go from the first truly acclaimed album of her career and then…this. It took balls. Which we all know Mom has in spades.\n\nWhat an exceptional first write-up and accompanying graphic @RJF.

And I definitely applaud her for being so experimental and releasing something wildly unexpected relatively early on into her career. It's just that the songs themselves... aren't that good for the most part. But that can also be said for \"MDNA\" which should definitely leave next.\n\nAlso, did I mention that \"Vogue\" is an 8/10 on a good day? kii"
