        "text": "August 19, 2022 – Today, Madonna has released her 50-track career spanning compilation album FINALLY ENOUGH LOVE: 50 NUMBER ONES – available now on both streaming and physical format. The collection, curated by Madonna, is in celebration of her historic milestone as the first and only recording artist to have 50 #1 hits on any single Billboard chart when she topped the Dance Club Songs chart for the 50th time.\n\n50 NUMBER ONES spans her entire dance club chart reign with dozens of remixes by the world’s top producers. In addition to fan favorites, the collection also includes a selection of rare remix recordings, with more than 20 being officially released for the first time or making their commercial/digital debut. The collection is now available digitally along with a 3-CD version. A limited-edition, 6-LP version on red and black vinyl sold out in pre-orders. The 16-track edition, FINALLY ENOUGH LOVE, is also now available in physical format. New album merchandise is available at Madonna’s official store.\n\nAdditionally, the Madonna x Yellowpop LED neon sign collection is available exclusively at Yellowpop.com.\n\nMadonna celebrated its release last week with a roller disco party at DiscOasis in Central Park, New York. Madonna and Nile Rodgers reunited for the event and spoke to the audience about making Like A Virgin together. Questlove served as DJ for the event, spinning Madonna hits & disco classics all night while guests danced and skated under the stars.\n\nThese new collections will mark the first album releases to be part of the newly announced partnership between Madonna and Warner Music Group, which will feature an extensive series of catalog releases across her groundbreaking career.\n\nExpect more surprises to be revealed later this year around the celebration of Madonna’s 40 years in music.\n\n--\n\nBoasting more than 220 minutes of remixes, FINALLY ENOUGH LOVE: 50 NUMBER ONES flows in mostly chronological order, showcasing the many musical reinventions that made Madonna an international icon, from 1983’s “Holiday” to 2019’s “I Don’t Search I Find,” with remixes by some of the biggest and most influential DJs of all time including Shep Pettibone, William Orbit, Honey Dijon, and Avicii.\n\nOn several songs, Madonna is joined by other incredible artists, including Britney Spears (“Me Against The Music”); Justin Timberlake and Timbaland (“4 Minutes”); and Nicki Minaj (“Bitch I’m Madonna.”) Each remix was newly remastered for the collection by Mike Dean, who produced Madonna’s two most-recent studio albums, Rebel Heart (2015) and Madame X (2019).\n\nBoth of these new collections also highlight You Can Dance, Madonna’s first ever remix collection. Celebrating 35 years this year, You Can Dance has sold more than five million copies worldwide and is still the second best-selling remix album of all time. The collection also pays homage to “Everybody,” Madonna’s first single, celebrating its 40th Anniversary on October 6. Madonna redesigned the album’s chronology by picking three edits from You Can Dance, including “Into The Groove”, “Everybody” and “Physical Attraction,” which reflects the underground club vibes that inspired her first recordings as a Sire artist.\n\nAlong with those rarities, these albums also introduce versions that are seeing their first ever official release, including the “Alternate Single Remix” of “Keep It Together,” the “Offer Nissim Promo Mix” of “Living For Love,” and more.\n\nExpect more surprises to be revealed later this year around the celebration of Madonna’s 40 years in music."
