        "text": "Amidst the whirlwind of her preparations for The Celebration Tour (which has now been delayed as she was hospitalized with a severe infection), Madonna has managed to keep the music flowing in 2023. The iconic pop singer has been steadily dropping new singles recently, collaborating with superstars like The Weeknd and Sam Smith.\n\nBut there's more to her musical output this year than meets the eye. In between her high-profile ventures, Madonna has been quietly gifting her most devoted fans with a series of exciting new projects. While these projects may not have made headlines, they are a testament to the singer's never-ending release schedule and the utility of her back catalog.\n\nThroughout 2023, Madonna has discreetly launched not one, not two, but six distinct albums. But these are not your conventional collections of all-new material. Instead, they are remix compilations, each focusing largely on one or two songs and featuring at least five (but most have many more) reworkings. Some albums revolve around a single hit, while others divide an EP or full-length album into multiple tracks. In a few instances, the albums even include semi-rare tunes previously found only on international deluxe editions of her past albums.\n\nThe rollout of these remix albums began in March, with Madonna releasing four of them in rapid succession. Kicking off the spree on March 3 was the nine-song remix album for “Ray of Light.” Just six days later, on March 9, came the Burning Up/Physical Attraction EP. On March 17, fans were treated to the \"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\" remix collection, followed by an album featuring nine different versions of \"Nothing Really Matters\" on March 31.\n\nForbesMiley Cyrus Matches Mariah Carey On The Billboard Charts\n\nIn April, Madonna didn't slow down, delighting her fans with American Life (The Remixes), an eight-track album released on the twenty-first of that month. After that, the focus shifted slightly, with the pop sensation turning her attention to her new singles, \"Popular\" with The Weeknd and Playboy Carti, and \"Vulgar\" with Sam Smith. Both tracks performed well on several Billboard charts, with \"Popular\" maintaining its strong presence to this day.\n\nMid-July saw Madonna return to the remix format with Hollywood (Remixes), which debuted on streaming platforms on July 14.\n\nThese remix EPs and albums cater to dance aficionados and super fans, offering them multiple takes on the same song. The releases sometimes include not just one remixer's reworking but several variations on the same track, including extended editions and other specific renditions.\n\nThese remix albums aren't designed to propel Madonna back up the charts; instead, they serve a different purpose. Their primary aim is to breathe new life into her back catalog, a venture she has been busy with for several years now. For Madonna, these releases satisfy her die-hard followers, while also keeping her music generating royalties as she concurrently works on other new projects, such as additional singles and her highly anticipated tour."
