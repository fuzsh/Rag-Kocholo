        "text": "BAY CITY, MI — Recognized as the best-selling female recording artist of all time today, Madonna’s hit discography began with a self-titled debut album released on this date 40 years ago: July 27, 1983.\n\nFour decades later, Madonna’s pop music career has included more than 300 million albums sold worldwide and all the fame that’s followed her as a result. That globe-spanning life, though, began here in Bay City, where she was born in 1958 and raised before her family departed for the Rochester Hills region in the 1970s.\n\nBut the 64-year-old cultural icon hasn’t been completely absent from Bay City in the years since that debut album — which featured hit singles such as “Borderline” and “Lucky Star” — launched her ascent to pop culture icon status.\n\nIn fact, next month marks the 20-year anniversary since Madonna was spotted in a beloved store in her hometown, where she purchased $7.83 worth of candy.\n\nThe exchange happened about 4 p.m. Wednesday, Aug. 6, 2003. That’s when Madonna reportedly bought a bag of Red-Hot Dollars — which feature raspberry-flavored gummies — from St. Laurent Brothers, a longtime favorite stop for candy lovers on Bay City’s East side.\n\nStaff there said the singer showed up wearing a dusty-blue tank top and a beret while fashioning her blonde hair in a ponytail. She was accompanied by film director Guy Ritchie, who was her husband from 2000-08.\n\n“Once I realized it was her, I was in shock,” then-St. Laurent Brothers clerk Kristi L. Loiselle told The Bay City Times in 2003. “I was, like, ‘Oh my gosh.’ You don’t really see anything else around you. You don’t really notice any other customers after that.”\n\nMadonna and Ritchie were accompanied by “a muscular man” who followed the couple inside and later drove them away, Loiselle said in 2003.\n\nMadonna returned to her hometown again, eight years later, following the March 2011 death of her grandmother, Elsie Mae Fortin.\n\nMadonna attended a pre-funeral gathering at Gephart Funeral Home, staff told The Bay City Times/MLive at the time. Stories and photos focused on her appearance in Bay City were published by international media outlets and Madonna-centric blogs alike.\n\nWhile those Bay City sightings happened more than a decade ago, locals continue to celebrate Madonna’s legacy in the mid-Michigan community.\n\nAs recently as this March, the Bay County Historical Museum hosted an event where attendees watched Madonna music videos and the film, “Smelly Little Town.” The 26-minute documentary follows the performer’s sometimes contentious relationship with her hometown, which she called the “smelly little town in northern Michigan” during an NBC interview in 1987.\n\nStill, locals recognize several landmarks that tie Madonna to Bay County. There is the old Visitation Catholic Church, where her parents married each other; the old Mercy Hospital, where she was born; and Calvary Cemetery, where Madonna’s mother is buried along with other family members.\n\nMadonna’s place as a Bay City native was set in stone — almost literally — in October 2020, when an artist created a mural of the pop star on the downtown City Market wall along Adams Street.\n\nMadonna this year continues to make news, outside of her hometown.\n\nFamily members in February announced her brother, Anthony Ciccone, died at age 66.\n\nThat news came about three weeks after Madonna was featured as a presenter at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards, which generated conversation about the singer, who defended herself when viewers remarked negatively about her changed physical appearance.\n\nAlso in February, Madonna announced a new world tour in part to celebrate the 40-year anniversary of the release of her first album. However, that tour was postponed last month after a bacterial infection resulted in her hospitalization.\n\nShe later released a statement that she was “on the road to recovery” and planning to resume the tour in October. While the concert date remains postponed, Ticketmaster continues to sell tickets for her planned stop at Little Caesars Arena in Detroit.\n\nWant more Bay City- and Saginaw-area news?
