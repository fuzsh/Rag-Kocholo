        "text": "Madonna is still busy performing nearly nightly on her Celebration Tour, which has taken her around the world and played to thousands upon thousands of adoring fans for months. As she continues the greatest hits trek, the pop superstar has another reason to celebrate as one of her most recent releases reaches a special milestone.\n\nFinally Enough Love: 50 Number Ones by Madonna has now lived on the U.K. albums chart for 52 weeks. The compilation is her latest set to spend an entire year on the ranking of the most-consumed full-lengths in the major music market, and it joins a growing list of highly successful projects from the Queen of Pop.\n\nThe remix compilation barely makes it to that one-year anniversary, though. Finally Enough Love hits 52 weeks as it returns to the ranking, coming in at No. 100. It previously topped out at No. 3 in 2022 when it was released.\n\nFinally Enough Love is Madonna’s milestone tenth album to spend at least one year on the U.K. ranking of the biggest projects. It’s also her most recent new placement on the tally.\n\nCurrently, Madonna’s longest-charting title on the U.K. albums ranking is another that’s focused on only her best-known and most-loved singles. The Immaculate Collection has thus far spent 363 weeks on the chart.\n\nMadonna has seen four releases hit 100 weeks on the U.K. albums chart. Coming in behind The Immaculate Collection are Like a Virgin (152 weeks), Ray of Light (138 weeks), and her self-titled debut (125 weeks). True Blue is close to that mark, as it’s lived on the ranking for 90 weeks, though it may never reach that milestone, as it hasn’t been seen on the list for some time."
