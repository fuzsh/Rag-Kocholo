Lyrics from Animelyrics.com

itsunoma ni ka yume no naka de futari KISU o shiteita no

mitsumeatte zutto mae kara kokoni ita you ni

Lyrics from Animelyrics.com

Before I knew, we were kissing inside a dream

We were gazing to each other as if we had been there all the time

Lyrics from Animelyrics.com

doukashiteru ne hen na kimochi asa yake ga me ni shimiru

aoi RIARU mune no oku ni umarete...

Lyrics from Animelyrics.com

I have a strange feeling, as if the dawn light pierced through my eyes

and gave birth to a real blue inside my chest

Lyrics from Animelyrics.com

* KAN chigai shinai de to furi ha ratta nukumori ni

hikareteku jibun ga sukoshi KOWA katta kara

koi ja nakute ii nante mayowasete gomen ne

kitto sono fun watashi mo setsunaku naru no ni

Lyrics from Animelyrics.com

*I don't want to give you a wrong impression, but after breaking away from you

I, overwhelmed, was still feeling your warmth so I got a bit scared

It would be better not to fall in love, I'm sorry to confuse you

That's certainly going to hurt me as well though

Lyrics from Animelyrics.com

kono mama de irareru no nara futari II tomodachi yo ne

dakedo kokoro ha kokyuu no tabi katachi o kaeteku

Lyrics from Animelyrics.com

If we keep this way we are going to be good friends

but the shape of my heart is going to change whenever I breath

Lyrics from Animelyrics.com

kagami no mae de utsushite miru tameraiya toma doi o

nan no tame ni chigau watashi sagasu no...

Lyrics from Animelyrics.com

Standing before the mirror I can see reflected my indecission and insecurity

Why am I trying to be someone different from myself?

Lyrics from Animelyrics.com

wakare giwa kata koshi ni kawashita shisen no imi ha

hito koto de subete o ushinau kamo shirenai

koi ja nakute ii nante katte na ii wake ne

ashita attara donna kao sureba ii no yo

Lyrics from Animelyrics.com

The glance we shared in the time of our split means

that all could be lost with a single word

It would be better not to fall in love, that's a good selfish excuse

I wonder how should I face you if I met you tomorrow?
