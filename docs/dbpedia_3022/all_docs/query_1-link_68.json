        "text": "Year 70 of the Cosmic Era. The Coordinators, a group of genetically enhanced humans, have moved into colonies orbiting the Earth. But that hasn't quieted the tensions between them and regular humans; the conflict soon escalates into a full-scale war. On the neutral colony of Heliopolis, Kira Yamato, and his friends are going to school and just being kids. But when the ZAFT commando forces attack, Kira's life changes forever.\n\nLeft with no choice, he and Federation officer Murrue Ramius are thrown into battle in a prototype mobile weapon, which Kira christens \"GUNDAM.\" Now, Kira must defend himself and his friends from his own people. For, unknown to anyone else, Kira is a Coordinator. And the enemy he faces on the battlefield is his childhood best friend, Athrun!\n\n[Source: Right Stuf]\n\nIn the first short, Lowe Gear and the Junk Guild make a stop at an mobile suit parts auction on Earth where Lowe purchases a head taken from a modified BuCUE suit which, when attached to the arm of his Red Frame Astray, acts as a dual beam saber. Lowe tries to decrypt some combat data contained in the head, but is shortly engaged by, and goes into combat with, several ZAFT suits including a CGUE DEEP Arms. In the second short, Blue Frame pilot Gai Murakamo engages and, with the help of his fellow Serpent Tail mercenaries, traps a GINN High Mobility Type. He then faces off with the legendary Edward Harrelson, who pilots a Sword Calamity Gundam and has just finished destroying a fleet of ZAFT ships.\n\n[Source: Anime News Network]\n\nThree TV movies made from Mobile Suit Gundam Seed series.\n\nThe Empty Battlefield (Kokuu no Senjou)\n\nThe Far-Away Dawn (Harukanaru Akatsuki)\n\nThe Rumbling Sky (Meidou no Sora)\n\nMuch like the Mobile Suit Gundam theatrical movies, the Gundam Seed: Special Edition movies are intended to be an override of the story from the TV series.\n\nThese episodes are in fact a complete recap of all 50 episodes of the TV series and were first shown on television in Japan. The Special Edition episodes feature some new scenes and tweaks to previously animated scenes. The first special, The Empty Battlefield, which was episodes 1 to 21 of the series, was aired in two parts on Japanese TV in March 2004, followed by the next special, The Far-Away Dawn, which was episodes 22 to 40, in July 2004. The final special, The Rumbling Sky, which was episodes 41 to 50. While the story is overall unchanged, there are a few minor changes. In addition, several scenes are re-animated and re-dubbed.\n\n[Source: Wikipedia]\n\nAfter the second battle of Jachin Due, with its terrible toll of lives on both sides, the Earth Alliance and ZAFT signed a cease-fire treaty at the ruins of Junius Seven. The treaty, however, did not necessarily resolve the root of the conflict between the Naturals and Coordinators.\n\nC. E. 73 · 10. Cagalli Yula Athha, who has become the Orb representative, is visiting the newly established PLANT “Armory One” of ZAFT at L4 with Athrun Zala (using the pseudonym “Alex Dino” in public). She came to have a secret meeting with Supreme Council Chairman Gilbert Durandal, having concerns about some disturbing movements on both sides that has begun to re-surface.\n\nJust then, the alarm blares.\n\nApparently, a mysterious group caused a destructive activity aimed at the launch ceremony of the new battleship “Minerva.” The group then, taking advantage of the confusion, rob the new MS “Gundams” just before their roll-out.\n\nCagalli is at loss with the fight happening again before her eyes. To protect Cagalli, Athrun grabs her and jumps into the cockpit of a “ZAKU Warrior,” and fights with the hijacked 3 Gundams, Chaos, Gaia, and Abyss. But Athrun is cornered by them, outnumbered and excelled in spec.\n\nAt the last extremity, another new MS jumps in between both parties.\n\nIt is Impulse Gundam, piloted by Shin Asuka.\n\n[Source: GundamInfo]\n\nC.E. (Cosmic Era). An era in which there are human beings called Coordinators, born with superior physical and mental abilities thanks to genetic modification, and humans called Naturals who are born naturally. With their respective existence at stake, the ideological clash between Coordinators and Naturals escalated into war using armed force.\n\nAlong the way, the Destiny Plan was proposed, which would forcibly assign a role to each individual and create a world free of competition. But amid the fighting, this Destiny Plan was rejected in order to protect humanity's aspirations and future freedom.\n\n[Source: GUNDAM.INFO YouTube Channel]"
