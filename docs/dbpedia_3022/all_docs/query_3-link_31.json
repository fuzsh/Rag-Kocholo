        "text": "The NCAA Tournament selection committee revealed its top 16 seeds Saturday, giving us an early look at how March Madness might unfold on Selection Sunday on March 17. These seeds are subject to change as teams finish up the regular season before starting conference tournament play.\n\nThis weekend marks the eighth time the committee has published its top 16 seeds in mid-February. None of their selections have ever missed the NCAA Tournament. Per 247Sports' research, the accuracy level for No. 1 seeds has been particularly strong. In each of the six tournaments to follow a seeding reveal, at least three of the four teams projected as No. 1 seeds kept their No. 1 seed designation on Selection Sunday.\n\nAnd of the five No. 1 seeds to drop, only one has fallen beyond the No. 2 seed line: 2017 Baylor, which slid to a No. 3 seed. All top four seeds were selected in the same order by all 12 committee members for the first time in history.\n\n30% off annual VIP membership!
