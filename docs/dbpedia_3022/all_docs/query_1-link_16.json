Burn them to cinders!\n\nUnleash your true power that was sealed away!!\n\nBursting through the black smoke above\n\nA scarlet titan descends upon us!!\n\nThe light shines bright, and explosions ring out loud\n\nWith one resolute swing of your blade, drive them away!\n\nYou can change, I know you can change\n\nInferno Combination!\n\nNever give up, that’s right, never give up\n\nDon’t you ever stop, don’t you ever stop, Sol Gravion!\n\nSoar through the sky! Break right through them!\n\nNow, let your crimson flames roar bright!\n\nSmash them apart! Burn them to cinders!\n\nUnleash your true power that was sealed away!!\n\nThe people run screaming for their lives\n\nBut a steel titan stands tall as their shield\n\nAnd if within, they were to fear the pain\n\nThen this world would be consumed by these devils\n\nYou can win, I know you can win\n\nInferno Combination!\n\nDon’t give up, so please don’t give up\n\nNever turn and run, never turn and run, Sol Gravion!\n\nPierce through the dark! Cleave through your foes!\n\nFly high, and protect the Earth’s future!\n\nFace them down! And take back what’s ours!\n\nBring back the future that was stolen from us!!\n\nSoar through the sky! Turn them into scrap!\n\nLet your crimson flames roar bright, and punch right through them!\n\nSmash them apart! Burn them to cinders!\n\nUnleash your true power that was sealed away!!\n\nThe tranquil silence is torn apart\n\nAs the world is plunged into flames…\n\nTake the fist you raised in anger, and give it purpose\n\nLet the fire within you burn again\n\nLet your blood boil, don’t hold it back\n\nAnd no-one will ever stop you again\n\nTo bring the light through to the unseen dawn\n\nYou must be the fangs for those who have none!\n\n“Sol Graviton Nova!!”\n\nRun, without fear in your heart\n\nUntil you reach that scarlet goal\n\nLet the climactic moments burn in your flames\n\nGravion!\n\nSo gather up the fragments of your shattered hope\n\nLet the star within you shine again\n\nExpose the fates that bind you together\n\nSo you never have to wander alone again\n\nTo protect the futures of the weak and vulnerable\n\nYou must be the shield for this world, this era!\n\n“Graviton Inferno Slash!”\n\nRun, and let your love be realized\n\nUntil scarlet victory is yours\n\nSlam them with every last bit of your power\n\nGravion!\n\nCast aside the peaceful escape you sought\n\nAnd plunge yourself back into the eye of the storm\n\nRun, without fear in your heart\n\nUntil you reach that scarlet goal\n\nLet the climactic moments burn in your flames\n\nGravion!\n\nThe horizon quivers in the breeze\n\nAre the flames still burning, I wonder?\n\nThough you tremble, you stand at the entrance to this world\n\nAnd until you know how we feel, you mustn’t die\n\nFor your wings are those of a\n\nValkyrie, appearing before the wounded soldiers\n\nValkyrie, a mythical bearer of love descends upon us\n\nWe will cross over the rainbow to guide your soul onwards\n\nValkyrie, even if you defy fate itself\n\nValkyrie, even if your tears threaten to rip you apart\n\nValkyrie, know there is no life that does not glow in dawn’s light\n\nI love you…\n\nSo clad yourself in shining armor, and soar into the sky,\n\nValkyrie, on the wings of goodbye\n\nWhat are your eyes set upon now?\n\nWho is it your lips call out to?\n\nWe’ve kept singing, believing we’ll meet again\n\nUntil it’s all been made right, until we’ve given all we have to give\n\nFor your wings are those of a\n\nValkyrie, appearing before the fallen soldiers\n\nValkyrie, a mythical bearer of love descends upon us\n\nTo make sure you won’t fade away into that deep blue sky\n\nValkyrie, all this sadness we have gathered\n\nValkyrie, that we bear in our hands is our truth\n\nBut even in these ruins, we take the seeds of our rebirth\n\nTo the eastern sun\n\nWith all our love, with all our love, clear and pure\n\nValkyrie\n\nWe will cross over the rainbow to guide you\n\nValkyrie\n\nAnd as you soar through the azure sky\n\nAnd the stormy winds of time lash at your cheeks\n\nKnow we will love you, we will love you, forevermore\n\nValkyrie, Valkyrie\n\nSo take that breath, and let’s go and choose our own future\n\nValkyrie, I have found the wind that blows\n\nValkyrie, and though one day we will part\n\nValkyrie, know there is no life that does not glow in dawn’s light\n\nWe still live\n\nSo clad yourself in shining armor, and soar into the sky,\n\nValkyrie,\n\n(Valkyrie, Valkyrie…)\n\nOn the wings of goodbye\n\nI love you…\n\nI love you…\n\nI love you…\n\nI love you…\n\nA dream lies crushed, shattered in clenched fists\n\nBut those same hands shed blood in its name\n\nAnd wings that cannot fly may as well be chains\n\nIf their weight just keeps you pinned down\n\nWhen those young eyes have known nothing but loss\n\nThey choose to see the stars that never seem to fade\n\nThe fires we tend within ourselves\n\nBlaze brighter as we do\n\nIt’s our destiny to keep those flames alive\n\nAnd let their light illuminates memories past\n\nOf times when kindness was all we knew\n\nWhat’s lost is mourned, but then in time replaced\n\nDo we all exist just to be forgotten…?\n\nThe new day comes, like the sky spreading its wings\n\nThough when we wake, we may find it all a bitter illusion\n\nIf hurting others without the slightest thought\n\nIs what it means to “live” in this world\n\nThen your unfading presence is my only truth\n\nSo let’s leave our mark here\n\nA brilliant, fleeting vestige of the scars we bear\n\nThe fires we tend within ourselves\n\nBlaze brighter as we do\n\nIt’s our destiny to keep those flames alive\n\nAnd let their light illuminates memories past\n\nWhen we could all be kind\n\nIf hurting others without the slightest thought\n\nIs what it means to “live” in this world\n\nThen your unfading presence is my only truth\n\nSo let’s leave our mark here\n\nA brilliant, fleeting vestige of the scars we bear"
