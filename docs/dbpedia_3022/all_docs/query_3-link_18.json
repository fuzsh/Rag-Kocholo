        "text": "Secret world seeds are world seeds which have been discovered as secret easter eggs that generate worlds with strange or unique features. Unlike regular world seeds, which affect only the usual world structure, secret seeds can produce worlds with characteristics that would not be attainable through normal world generation, i.e., they can affect the game's mechanics while playing in that world. For instance, they may change enemy statistics and behavior, item drops, graphics, theme music and more.\n\nSecret seeds use unique world-generating mechanics that differ from normal seeds. Using a secret seed overrides the normal use of seeds as a source of randomness and two worlds created via the same secret seed will not necessarily be identical.\n\nThere are currently eight different secret seeds, and loading in any one of these eight secret seeds will award the player with the achievement A Rare Realm, on PC, Console, and Mobile versions.\n\nDrunk world[]\n\nMain article: Drunk world\n\nSeeds:\n\n​05162020\n\n​5162020\n\nThis seed references May 16, 2020, which is Terraria's 9th birthday and the release date of 1.4.0.1. It invokes a highly extraordinary world generation referred to in the source code as drunkWorldGen.[1] It has therefore come to be referred to by the Terraria community as drunk world.\n\nIn this seed, both Evil biomes will generate, as well as both variants of any ore that comes in two varieties. The Guide is replaced by the Party Girl as the starting NPC, and the Dungeon entrance is now generated under a Living Tree painted brown.\n\nWhile generating[]\n\nGeneration descriptions and tips become random numbers that change every tick (except when \"Placing traps\").\n\nThe background shows a Glowing Mushroom biome, with clouds that resemble Redigit's head. The moon moves backwards and resembles a smiley face (see Trivia). Once the world finishes generating, it is possible to go back to the main menu with these effects still visible.\n\nThe outline of the progress bar rapidly flashes between Corruption and Crimson.\n\nThe Console Title music plays, instead of the normal Title Screen theme.\n\nThe Terraria logo spins out and disappears along with the version number.\n\nThe time of day is always night, and it never turns day.\n\nWorld icons[]\n\nThe world icon of a drunk world shows a tree infected with both world evils.\n\nPre-Hardmode world icon.\n\nHardmode world icon.\n\nNot the Bees[]\n\nMain article: Not the bees\n\nSeeds (not case sensitive):\n\n​not the bees\n\n​not the bees!\n\nThis seed generates a world dominated by bee-themed biomes and bee-related items and structures.\n\nMost of the world is replaced with the Jungle biome, with Hive and Honey Blocks found in abundance, and Larvae spawn throughout the world. The starting NPC is the Merchant instead of the Guide. He will sell the Furnace as per usual in the Jungle.\n\nWhile generating[]\n\nWhile generating, all generation descriptions say \"Generating bees\".\n\nWorld icons[]\n\nThe world icon of Not the Bees world is a Rich Mahogany surrounded by Bees.\n\nPre-Hardmode Corruption world icon.\n\nPre-Hardmode Crimson world icon.\n\nHardmode Corruption world icon.\n\nHardmode Crimson world icon.\n\nFor The Worthy[]\n\nMain article: For the worthy\n\nSeed (not case sensitive): for the worthy\n\nThis special world's features aim to drastically increase the difficulty of the game.\n\nAll enemies' contact damage, health and coin drop rates are increased, in addition to the world difficulty multiplier, by their standard amount in a normal world. After that, the damage is increased by another 33.33*1/3 (33.33%).[2] Damage from ranged attacks is typically left unchanged. Bunnies (even placed) are replaced with Explosive Bunnies, and all Demons are replaced with Voodoo Demons. The Demolitionist replaces the Guide upon entering the world for the first time.\n\nThere are also many other changes to world generations and game mechanics. For instance, some water pools throughout the world are replaced with lava. Pots and trees may drop lit Bombs that shortly explode, instead of their usual items. Skyware Chests are replaced with locked Gold Chests but they still have their respective loot. Sky Crates can't be fished until skeletron is defeated.\n\nBosses also receive changes to size and/or AI that make battles much more difficult.\n\nWorlds with this seed will use an upscaled world difficulty, so Journey > Classic, Classic > Expert, Expert > Master, and Master > Legendary. The Legendary difficulty is a secret difficulty only available on this seed and on the Zenith seed, though what it specifically does is yet to be confirmed. With this upscale, there's no way to have a For The Worthy World in Journey Mode without map editors, since when you put it in Journey Mode, it is scaled to Classic.\n\nWhile generating[]\n\nThe world generation screen messages are spelled backwards.\n\nWorld icons[]\n\nThe world icon of a \"For the worthy\" world is a Yellow Willow tree.\n\nPre-Hardmode Corruption world icon.\n\nPre-Hardmode Crimson world icon.\n\nHardmode Corruption world icon.\n\nHardmode Crimson world icon.\n\nCelebrationmk10[]\n\nMain article: Celebrationmk10\n\nSeeds (not case sensitive):\n\n​celebrationmk10\n\n​05162011\n\n​5162011\n\n​05162021\n\n​5162021\n\nThis seed celebrates Terraria's tenth birthday, May 16, 2021.\n\nThe player's spawn point is on the beach of one Ocean. Andrew the Guide, Whitney the Steampunker, Yorai the Princess, Amanda the Party Girl, and an Angora Town Bunny will also spawn there and a Party immediately starts. A majority of the world is painted in bright colors.\n\nItems in chests always have a \"best\" modifier such as Menacing or Legendary.\n\nTwo unique enemies can be encountered in this seed:\n\nThe Jungle Mimic can be found in the Hardmode Jungle.\n\nGolden Slimes can rarely spawn.\n\nThe chance of obtaining rare items such as the Rod of Discord and developer items is substantially increased, the Traveling Merchant always sells 2 extra items, and the Princess sells rare items such as the Slime Staff and Discount Card.\n\nWhile generating[]\n\nThe text on the loading screen is pink.\n\nUnderground hallow theme replaces the normal title theme\n\nWorld icons[]\n\nThe world icon of a Celebration world is a Pink Sakura tree with a bowknot.\n\nPre-Hardmode Corruption world icon.\n\nPre-Hardmode Crimson world icon.\n\nHardmode Corruption world icon.\n\nHardmode Crimson world icon.\n\nThe Constant[]\n\nMain article: The Constant\n\nSeeds (not case sensitive):\n\n​constant\n\n​theconstant\n\n​the constant\n\n​eye4aneye\n\n​eyeforaneye\n\nThis seed is part of the crossover with Klei Entertainment's Don't Starve Together.\n\nIt introduces hunger and darkness mechanics that make the early game especially challenging. Marble biomes with statues and Spider Caves will generate on the surface, and Cacti will damage the player.\n\nThe entire game uses a dark shader that gives the game a gloomier look. Items exclusive to the Don't Starve crossover content are more likely to drop.\n\nWhile generating[]\n\nThe game adds \"Generating wavy caves\" as one of its messages.\n\nA constant shader which significantly darkens the screen will be applied.\n\nWorld icons[]\n\nThe world icon of a Constant world is an Evergreen from Don't Starve.\n\nPre-Hardmode Corruption world icon.\n\nPre-Hardmode Crimson world icon.\n\nHardmode Corruption world icon.\n\nHardmode Crimson world icon.\n\nNo traps[]\n\nMain article: No traps\n\nSeeds (not case sensitive):\n\n​no traps\n\n​notraps\n\nWhen using this seed, the standard \"Placing Traps\" generation message is replaced with the message \"Not Placing Traps.\" However, the name and the message are a trick; this seed actually generates an incredibly high volume of traps.\n\nThese include standard Dart Traps, explosives, and Boulder Traps. In addition, this seed features more deadly variants of Boulders, including the pink Bouncy Boulder.\n\nMany of the traps in this seed are wired to statues. As these include critter and enemy spawning statues, as well as decorative statues, this is a useful seed to visit for statue collection.\n\nWorld icons[]\n\nThe No Traps world icon appears normal, except the base of the tree is connected to a wire.\n\nPre-Hardmode Corruption world icon.\n\nPre-Hardmode Crimson world icon.\n\nHardmode Corruption world icon.\n\nHardmode Crimson world icon.\n\nDon't Dig Up[]\n\nMain article: Don't Dig Up\n\nSeeds (not case sensitive):\n\n​don't dig up\n\n​dont dig up\n\n​dontdigup\n\nThis seed flips the usual order of player progression through biomes by having the player spawn in the Underworld.\n\nThe center of the Underworld now consists of an island of Ash with Ash Trees and Ash Grass, devoid of any lava or Hellstone. With the exception of Lava Slimes, which do not drop lava on death, regular Underworld enemies are replaced by surface enemies as long as the player remains on the island. Beyond it, the Underworld is as normal. Underworld critters will also spawn on the island once a town is built.\n\nMimics now spawn in pre-Hardmode, but drop pre-Hardmode chest loot. Mimics drop their standard loot in Hardmode.\n\nOre generation is inverted, with low-tier ores appearing close to the Underworld and higher-tier ores becoming increasingly common closer to the surface. Hardmode ores when generated follow this pattern as well.\n\nSimilarly, the world layers are inverted for fish dependent on layers. For example, a Dirtfish can be caught in what would otherwise be caverns despite it being a surface/underground fish.\n\nThe Underground layer closely resembles the Cavern layer in a normal world, consisting mostly of stone and containing mostly pockets of lava, with water only appearing very close to the Surface.\n\nA number of weapons, such as the Ice Bow, Keybrand, Magic Dagger, and Unholy Trident can be found at a different point of progression than usual, and have their stats and rarity rebalanced to match. The Aqua Scepter for example is dropped by Duke Fishron, deals 108 base damage, and has Yellow rarity. The Bubble Gun meanwhile is found in Dungeon chests, deals 6 damage, and has Light Green rarity.\n\nThere is a Glowing Mushroom biome immediately above the player's spawn. The Truffle is unable to spawn here in Hardmode, and still requires an artificial Glowing Mushroom biome to be built at the Surface level. Standard underground Glowing Mushroom spawns, including the Truffle Worm, can only be found in the usual underground pockets higher up.\n\nFallen Stars can be found by breaking pots, and do not disappear during the day unless on the Surface. They are also sometimes carried by slimes.\n\nThe Guide is replaced by the Tax Collector, and the Bestiary entry for the Tortured Soul is automatically filled. The Guide will still move in when there's an available house.\n\nThe Dryad does not sell Purification Powder, and the Steampunker sells neither the Clentaminator nor any Solutions.\n\nThe Surface is entirely covered by either The Corruption or The Crimson, depending on which world type was chosen during generation. Stone on the outer edges of the map are also replaced.\n\nThe Surface has a much higher spawn rate than normal, making survival for early players much more difficult. Jungle-tier equipment in pre-Hardmode and Adamantite/Titanium equipment in Hardmode is advisable.\n\nNormal Grass now grows and spreads on dirt blocks in underground and cavern layers, and surface plants like trees, Sunflowers, and Daybloom can grow and be placed on it. A layer of natural 'Underground Forest' generates in the Cavern above the Glowing Mushrooms and between the Underground Snow and Underground Jungle.\n\nThis Underground Forest is filled with Minecart Tracks that span most or all of its width as well as large horizontal caverns, easing horizontal exploration for the player.\n\nThe Underground Snow, Underground Jungle, and Underground Desert behave like their surface equivalents close to the Underworld, with the surface music playing, surface plants growing, surface events happening, and surface enemies spawning. Underground Jungle enemies also spawn in every layer as well, however.\n\nUnderground Corruption and Crimson enemies such as Clingers and Ichor Stickers can spawn on the surface come Hardmode.\n\nShould The Hallow be forcibly introduced to the surface, crystals shards can grow on various hallowed blocks, such as pearlsand.\n\nUnusually, Hallowed Grass can't overtake the grasses of Evil Biomes, and will instead be taken over by them. This is different than usual, wherein Hallowed Grass can overtake the grasses of Evil Biomes.\n\nThere is no sun and therefore no natural light on the Surface, and the skybox is a star field with shooting stars. The Surface remains pitch-black even when the moon is overhead, and Fallen Stars always fall, but disappear on impact. When a star falls, it can collide with the player, dealing lethal damage in the process.\n\nDay and night-specific enemies, such as Surface slimes, Zombies, and Demon Eyes, spawn at all times of day.\n\nEnemies that normally can only spawn in the outer thirds of the world, such as King Slime and Goblin Scout, can spawn anywhere.\n\nCrossing above the top border of the world now results in the player's death, resulting in unique death messages.\n\nThe Dungeon, Jungle Temple, Living Trees, and any Pyramids are all painted either red or purple, depending on the world evil.\n\nThe Jungle Temple generates on the Surface.\n\nLiving trees appear dead with barren, leafless branches. They retain their underground rooms, but Living Wood chests are either absent or replaced with chests made of the world's evil wood.\n\nSurface trees do not generate with leaves.\n\nCloud Blocks and Sunplate Blocks on Floating Islands are replaced with Lesion Blocks or Flesh Blocks. Floating Islands also contain a water fountain of the world evil.\n\nSurface enemies will spawn in the center of the Underworld during a Blood Moon, and Eerie will play over the Underworld music.\n\nSurface weather events like Rain and Blizzards can occur underground. Invasions also occur underground.\n\nEnemies that are normally exclusive to the Underground Crimson and Underground Corruption, such as Ichor Stickers and Clingers, will instead spawn on the Surface in Hardmode, and Souls of Night will also appear from enemies killed on the surface.\n\nNPC happiness is disabled, and NPCs with shops will always sell pylons so long as there is at least one other NPC nearby. This is likely because the whole game taking place underground would cause too many problems for NPCs who don't like underground biomes.\n\nWhen entering Hardmode, the Hallow will appear on one of the outer edges, but will not extend to the Surface. This can sometimes result in a very small amount of natural Hallow if it appears on the same side as the Jungle.\n\nSince Remix worlds have no sun, the Solar Eclipse event is instead announced with the message \"The horrors have arrived!\"\n\nWhile generating[]\n\nThe Terraria logo rotates and flips upside down.\n\nThe background becomes a field of stars with shooting stars streaking through it.\n\nCorruption music plays, even if the world is crimson.\n\nWorld icons[]\n\nThe world icon of a Don't dig up world is an Ash Tree.\n\nPre-Hardmode Corruption world icon.\n\nPre-Hardmode Crimson world icon.\n\nHardmode Corruption world icon.\n\nHardmode Crimson world icon.\n\nZenith seed/Get fixed boi/Everything seed[]\n\nMain article: Get fixed boi\n\nSeeds (not case-sensitive):\n\n​get fixed boi\n\n​getfixedboi\n\nThis seed is a combination of the No traps, Not the bees, Drunk, Celebration, Constant, Remix, and For the Worthy secret seeds.\n\nAs with the Remix seed, the player spawns in the Underworld on a flat plain with ash grass and Ash trees, and a Glowing Mushroom biome immediately overhead. The biome encompasses the bottom portion of the map, and is painted in rainbow colors.\n\nAbove the Underground layer, the world will be comprised of half Crimson and half Corruption. The positioning of the biomes is dependent on the world seed.\n\nGem Critters will spawn in the center of the Underworld, similarly to the spawning of Bunnies and Squirrels on the surface. Note that these critters can't be crafted into food at a Cooking Pot, but can be sold for a reliable way to make money.\n\nAndrew the Tax Collector, Whitney the Steampunker, Yorai the Princess, a Party Girl, and Slimestar the Diva Town Slime will also spawn there and a Party immediately starts. When the Party ends at the beginning of the first night, all of them will instantly die.\n\nHeart and Star pickups are randomly replaced with their counterparts from the Christmas and Halloween events. However, they will always be their seasonal variant during their respective events.\n\nThe Steampunker does not sell the Clentaminator or any of its solutions.\n\nCrispy Honey Blocks generated due to the Not the Bees seed changes behave similarly to Hellstone, causing the Burning debuff on contact and having a chance to release Lava when destroyed. This includes when placed by the player or when created by honey contacting lava.\n\nInstead of fighting the Mechanical Bosses one by one in Hardmode, a new Zenith-world-exclusive boss called Mechdusa must be fought instead, spawning after the Ocram's Razor has been used, showing the message \"Mechdusa has awoken!\", replacing a natural or intentional spawn from either of the three bosses separately. Mechdusa essentially is and looks like the amalgamation of all three mechanical bosses, shaped into a single creature, resembling a gorgon from Greek mythology, with the Destroyer as its body and Skeletron Prime serving as its head with the Twins being sprung out of its eye sockets. Despite being spawned as such, all three parts of Mechdusa still possess their own independent health pool, but total up to having the most health out of any boss at a staggering 273,000 HP starting at Classic Mode, beating the Moon Lord's 145,000 HP. The AI of the Mechdusa is also a combination of all three bosses' AI models, with the priority being Skeletron Prime > The Twins > The Destroyer (?). As mentioned before, one cannot spawn each Mechanical Boss individually using their summoning items in a world generated by the Zenith seed. In reverse, Ocram's Razor cannot be used in non-Zenith worlds and thus Mechdusa cannot spawn anywhere but in Zenith worlds. To craft one Ocram's Razor, all three of the Bosses' summoning items have to be combined, one each, at an hardmode anvil. Waiting for a natural spawn or using the Ocram's Razor is the only way of ever defeating the Mechanical bosses in a Zenith world, posing a greater challenge to game progression as a whole. When defeated, Mechdusa guaranteed drops the Zenith-world-exclusive weapon called the Waffle's Iron, along with the bosses' respective Treasure Bags, along with their Relics and a chance for Master Mode-exclusive pets if fought in Expert Mode or higher. Additionally, if defeated for the first time, the player will unlock the \"Mecha Mayhem\" achievement as Mechdusa is the amalgamation of all three mechanical bosses.\n\nThough the Zenith world does use the hunger and darkness damage systems from The Constant, it does not use the shader.\n\nWorlds with this seed will use an upscaled world difficulty, so Journey > Classic, Classic > Expert, Expert > Master, and Master > Legendary. The Legendary difficulty is a secret difficulty only available on this seed and on For The Worthy seed (and is displayed as such in the world selection page), though what it specifically does is yet to be confirmed beside a further enemy HP and damage increase. with this upscale, there's no way to have a Zenith World in Journey Mode without map editors, since when you put it in Journey Mode, it is scaled to Classic.\n\nWhile Generating[]\n\nAll text will be backwards except for the text \"Not Placing Traps\". The same text appears when generating a No Traps seed.\n\nThe logo will be flipped upside down and the background will be replaced with a field of stars like it is in the Remix seed.\n\nThe cursor will be changed to a face made out of two stars and a moon as it is in the Drunk seed.\n\nFalling stars can be bounced off the cursor which makes the same sound as the Meowmere's projectiles.\n\nDifficulty Boss Mechanics (WIP):[]\n\nThe Eye of Cthulhu spawns a group of Servants of Cthulhu multiple times during its second phase, and reflects projectiles when transforming into its second phase.\n\nQueen Bee's Larvae spawn throughout the world. However, due to the usual lack of an Underground Jungle biome, she will usually be enraged when spawned.\n\nEater of Worlds' segments now split into Eaters of Souls.\n\nThe Brain of Cthulhu's final phase forcibly flips your camera upside-down, as though you're using a gravitation potion that can't be toggled off, and you also now cannot see the brain you are able to hit on the mini map.\n\nSkeletron's head reflects projectiles while it's spinning in the first phase, and when the hands have been destroyed, he'll constantly summon Dark Casters to assist him during the fight.\n\nThe Wall of Flesh summons Fire Imps during the battle which shoot high-velocity fireballs - these fireballs, unlike the fireballs of normal imps, are indestructible.\n\nThe Twins, The Destroyer and Skeletron Prime are replaced entirely by Mechdusa, with the summon items for the three regular bosses being completely unusable in Zenith worlds.\n\nPlantera's hooks create thorns wherever they grasp that deal damage when touched, but can be destroyed by attacking them.\n\nGolem is much smaller than normal, like in For the worthy. Also, the light sources get destroyed [Confirmation Needed].\n\nTime of day has no bearing on whether Empress of Light enters her enraged form; instead, her enraged form will only appear if she is summoned on the world's surface.\n\nMoon Lord shoots out Moon Boulders, which behave similarly to the Bouncy Boulder.\n\nUnique Enemy Behaviors (WIP):[]\n\nA notably higher portion of Zombies will spawn as the arm-carrying variant instead.\n\nLarge Eaters of Souls and Crimera much more common.\n\nMost Demons will spawn as Voodoo Demons instead.\n\nThe web attack of Spider enemies will create large spreads of cobweb blocks where they land when Hardmode is entered.\n\nGlobal spawn rates are drastically increased on the Surface.\n\nWorld icons[]\n\nThe Everything Seed world icon is a glitchy tree. Improper icons the same as the drunk world icon but upside down, these icons will appear if the worlds were edited (using map editors and had the zenithWorld attribute enabled but has the drunkWorld and/or remixWorld attribute disabled.\n\nWorld icon.\n\nPre-Hardmode improper world icon.\n\nHardmode improper world icon.\n\nNotes[]\n\nThe seed being randomized can lead the game to create a drunk world or a Celebrationmk10 world without specifying the seed, but the chances of it to happen are very low (1/2147483648 (0.000000047%) for the drunk world, 1/1073741824 (0.000000093%) for the Celebrationmk10 seed).\n\nThis is due to the random seed being a random number between 0 and 2147483647; the random seed can match the one needed for one of these secret seeds. The chances are doubled for the Celebrationmk10 seed due to the fact that two seed numbers trigger the secret seed.\n\nThe Remix seed will make it much easier to obtain the achievement Rock bottom, an achievement that normally requires you to dig all the way down to the underworld, and then reach the bottom. PC, Mobile, Console, and Old Chinese versions only.\n\nAll boulders will explode into smaller additional boulders when they crash into a wall (excluding bouncy boulders).\n\nBringing a weapon that has changed game progression to or from the Remix or Zenith seeds will cause the weapon to be changed in that world appropriately.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThe smiley-faced moon seen during the generation of a drunk world is a reference to an astronomy hoax that was said to happen the same day Journey's End released on PC.[3][4]\n\nUnlike the other secret seeds, the drunk world and Celebrationmk10 seeds are interpreted as numbers, so any number of 0s can be added in the front (e.g. 000005162020 for the drunk world). In addition, there are numerous unintended strings that generate these two secret seeds (due to the use of the CRC-32 algorithm[5]), such as:\n\nDrunk world (case-sensitive):\n\n​now aunt brush\n\n​Joke Disappear Horizon\n\n​disapprove stiff solution\n\nCelebrationmk10 (case-sensitive):\n\n​Thirst of dress\n\n​engineer governor reproduction\n\n​inform Representative yorai\n\nIf a modified world were to have 2 or more active secret seeds at the same time, the icon for it would follow this priority: Drunk world > For the worthy > Not the bees > Celebrationmk10 > The Constant.\n\nHistory[]\n\nDesktop 1.4.4: Added three secret seeds no traps, don't dig up and get fixed boi\n\nDesktop 1.4.3:\n\nAdded secret seed theconstant.\n\nWorlds using special seeds now have unique icons in the World Select menu to better tell them apart.\n\nDesktop 1.4.2.3: Added secret seed celebrationmk10.\n\nDesktop 1.4.0.5:\n\nChest loot is now replaced by Angel Statues instead of Dirt Blocks in \"For the worthy\" and the chance for this to occur was lowered from 20*1/5 (20%) to 6.67*1/15 (6.67%).\n\nGlowing moss biomes are now 50% larger than normal in \"For the worthy\".\n\nDesktop 1.4.0.3: Added secret seed for the worthy.\n\nDesktop 1.4.0.1: Introduced secret seeds 5162020 and not the bees.\n\nConsole 1.4.0.5.4.1: Introduced with changes up to Desktop 1.4.0.5.\n\nSwitch 1.4.0.5.5: Introduced with changes up to Desktop 1.4.0.5.\n\nMobile 1.4.0.5.0: Introduced with changes up to Desktop 1.4.0.5."
