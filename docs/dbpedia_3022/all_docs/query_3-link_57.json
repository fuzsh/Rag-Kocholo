        "text": "Vary your protein routine.\n\nWhat foods are in the Protein Foods Group?\n\nProtein Foods include all foods made from seafood; meat, poultry, and eggs; beans, peas, and lentils; and nuts, seeds, and soy products. Beans, peas, and lentils are also part of the Vegetable Group. To learn more, visit the Beans, Peas, and Lentils page.\n\nEat a variety of protein foods to get more of the nutrients your body needs. Meat and poultry choices should be lean or low-fat, like 93% lean ground beef, pork loin, and skinless chicken breasts. Choose seafood options that are higher in healthy fatty acids (called omega-3s) and lower in methylmercury, such as salmon, anchovies, and trout.\n\nIf you are vegetarian or vegan, the advice to eat meat, poultry, and seafood does not apply to you. Vegetarian protein options include beans, peas, lentils, nuts, seeds, and soy products.\n\nHow much food from the Protein Foods Group should I eat daily?\n\nThe amount of protein foods you need depends on your age, sex, height, weight, and physical activity. The amount can also depend on whether or not you are pregnant or breastfeeding.\n\nMost Americans eat enough from the Protein Foods Group but need to select leaner varieties of meat and poultry. They may also need to increase the variety of protein foods selected and choose meats less often.\n\nFind the right amount for you by getting your MyPlate Plan. For general guidance by age, see the table below.\n\nWhat counts as an ounce-equivalent in the Protein Foods Group?\n\nThe following examples count as 1 ounce-equivalent from the Protein Foods Group:\n\n1 ounce of meat, poultry or fish\n\n¼ cup cooked beans\n\n1 egg\n\n1 tablespoon of peanut butter\n\n½ ounce of nuts or seeds\n\n¼ cup (about 2 ounces) of tofu\n\n1 ounce tempeh, cooked\n\nThe table below lists amounts that count as 1 ounce-equivalent in the Protein Foods Group towards your daily recommended amount.\n\nMore about the Protein Foods Group\n\nThe table below lists amounts that count as 1 ounce-equivalent in the Protein Foods Group towards your daily recommended amount. Note: Click on the title row to expand the table. If you are on a mobile device, you may need to turn it to see the full table.\n\nWhy is it important to select a variety of choices from the Protein Foods Group?\n\nProtein foods provide nutrients important for maintaining your health and body.\n\nMany Americans get the right amount of protein needed from meat, poultry, and eggs, but do not meet the recommendations for seafood or nuts, seeds, and soy products. Meeting this can help increase the amount of important nutrients your body needs, like unsaturated fats, dietary fiber, and vitamin D. It also helps limit the amount of sodium and saturated fats from you get from processed meat and poultry.\n\nWhy is it important to eat a variety of seafood each week?\n\nSeafood contains a range of nutrients, notably the omega-3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA. Eating about 8 ounces per week of a variety of seafood, the amount recommended for many adults, as part of a healthy diet, can support health. Some types of fish, such as salmon and trout are also natural sources of vitamin D, a nutrient that many people don't get enough of.\n\nSeafood varieties commonly consumed in the United States that are higher in EPA and DHA and lower in a type of mercury, in the form of methylmercury, include salmon, anchovies, sardines, Pacific oysters, and trout. The amount of recommended seafood varies based on age, weight, and level of physical activity. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency provide joint advice to limit methylmercury exposure from seafood for women who might become pregnant or who are pregnant or lactating and young children. See Advice About Eating Fish for more information.\n\nFood Group Gallery\n\nCurious about the foods in the Protein Foods Group? What does a one-ounce equivalent of protein foods look like?
