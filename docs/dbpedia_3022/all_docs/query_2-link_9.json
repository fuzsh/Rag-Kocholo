When Cosini rises to leave, he finds himself limping, now so aware of the theoretical complexity of bipedal locomotion that he can no longer do what was once natural. The predicament of Svevo’s hero resembles that of anyone today who would write literary history, or any history predicated on causality so abridged as to be easily articulable. Indeed, apropos another academic discipline that has stalled before the difficulty of synchronizing the complex, Clifford Geertz named “the hallmark of modern consciousness . . . its enormous multiplicity.”1 Anthropologist or historian, we are now so cognizant of the manifold subtleties of cultural artifacts, their genealogies, and our interpretations of them that we hardly know where literally or figuratively to begin tracing their trajectory. Cosini only hopes to walk across the room. The literary historian must circumambulate his subject’s entire edifice. Literary history’s charge to us was once ambitious but straightforward. It was to tell a story that combined other stories— our fiction, 1\n\n2 Introduction\n\npoetry, and plays— with their moment in time, and thus model history. It was by necessity a hybrid genre, encompassing criticism, biography, and intellectual or social historiography but organized under and by a narrative of progress. We are now more skeptical about the utility of history and narrative. Indeed, the illusionary coherence with which we now indict any narrative, but perhaps especially the historical, is a sign of how far the assumptions of literary modernism, already apparent in the nineteenth century, have undermined the foundations of many arenas of knowledge. So axiomatic is our skepticism that a book even as casually structured and argued as the present one, purporting to narrate something as elusive as literary history, must either coyly renounce the aims it pursues (by insisting, for instance, that history has nothing to do with the past but still signifies something) or install an apology as a coda. I do the latter. I am interested in how something called modern Japanese literature coalesced, and I believe answers can be found in the archive. But at the same time (here comes the apology) I understand that no resulting literary history claims durable authority. For while each subsequent attempt will doubtlessly add to the immense inventory of how and why writers write what they have, the accounting is never total as long as one deduction only begs another to amend it. The search in Western literary history for a chain of determined causes and effects in modernity is, in Japan, often a search for West–East influences and effects and just as quixotic. The generation of Japan’s literary historians who sought something definitive to say about Japan’s century and a half of print culture, including Hirano Ken, Nakamura Mitsuo, Isoda Kōichi, and Etō Jun, is gone. We are left with kasō bungakushi: hypothetical literary history whose subject is no longer always literature but its systems (seido), ranging from the now unfashionable busywork of sorting writers into schools (Naturalist, Proletarian, Neo-Perceptionalist, New Third Generation, etc.) to the hypercommercialized business of awarding prizes to new and not so new writers.2 That is not to say that all pretensions to literary history have to be bracketed as contingent because history itself is. Things do not have to be fully true to still be true. Just because René Wellek conceded that our attempts at evolutionary history have failed, this does not mean that any sort of history is futile or misleading.3 But to be true, the arguments of a literary historian have to reconcile with an enunciable theory of the historical, a word I prefer to history because an attribute is easier to live with than an entity, and much less messy philosophically. I am aware that our current reduction of history is the consequence of our modern abandonment of a certain kind of metaphysics.4 Whether we are right about\n\nModern, Japanese, Literary, History 3\n\nthat, though, hardly matters: what should be obvious in our present time of undoing is the “need to resist the understandable suspicion that codified literary history is a bankrupt enterprise. The truth is that we cannot escape from it and, even if we could, should not.”5 The historical is commonly construed nowadays as radically subjective in determination. In Michel Foucault’s words, it is “the most cluttered area of our memory.” But that subjectivism nonetheless constitutes a real, insofar as history “is equally the depths from which all beings emerge into their precarious, glittering existence.”6 The question of the historical and the real is deferred to speculating what that depth could be: psychology, sets of discourses, even as ineffable a thing as the human spirit. Literary history without the question of just how “beings emerge” would be as tedious as literature itself without that same inquiry. What we modern beings are is a matter of social practices that, while conditional and variable, are the product of a logic as well as accident. My working assumption in this book is that the history of modern Japanese literature may be impossible to tell without taking note of the odd quirks of individual novelists, but that it also obeys what we understand as the form (read history) of culture in a modern nation-state that has preserved certain institutions and habits of its non-Western past. Literature and so too literary history are themselves integral parts of Japanese modernity and therefore also partake of a worldwide developmental model if with identifiably Japanese elaborations of that model. This is an uneasy cohabitation, and its fragility plagues those who attempt the history of modern Japanese literature. To the extent that we have learned culture—“that complex whole,” in E. B. Tylor’s definition, “which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society”7— is not a vulgar production of social or economic relations, we are also tempted to retreat into a naïve ethnography of Japanese literature that never queries how our categories of study are themselves the legacy of the same history we pursue. These two temptations are why the history of modern literature in Japan, like in many places, is a history of prose fiction. This book will have relatively little to say about poetry or drama. It is with modernity and not just Japanese modernity that public and private life are integrated in ways that call for a literary genre that encompasses both historiography and biography. Novels do not succeed if their characters are no more than symbols of some collectivity or if their characters live in some purely private inaccessible space. A deceptively simple genre in some ways, the novel\n\n4 Introduction\n\nendorses a complex historical process but within a surprisingly stable and coherent structure because of, as has been observed of the novel in English, “its unrivaled power both to formulate, and to explain, a set of problems that are central to early modern experience.”8 That said, the structures of many Japanese novels in this regard do not correspond with what readers raised on their Western equivalents might expect. Japanese history since the early seventh century CE has been so shaped by its interrogative responses to the significance of the foreign models imported or imposed (Chinese, Korean, Euro-American) that its novels will inevitably trace a singular history.9 More important is a far briefer history than literate Japan’s millennium-plus: that of the opportunities or accommodations that literature has pursued or been consigned to within Japan’s prison-house of modernity. My history of modern literature in Japan is not the result of an arbitrary periodization. I believe in modernity as a distinct and describable episode, and one I suggest in the last chapter that has come to an end and a beginning. Despite the modern period’s brevity, two of the three truly major events in all of Japanese history— the 1868 Meiji Revolution (usually referred to as the Meiji Restoration) and the Second World War in the mid-twentieth century— occurred within it. Western modernity, now over three hundred years old, registered that moment when the word modern came to mean “now,” but defining the modern is harder than dating it, and so it is in Japan. It has been identified with the rise of a self-conscious subjectivity and with our status as objects of technological modernization; with rationality and faith in progress, the rise of capitalism and the ascendancy of the bourgeoisie and with the critique of those ideas as an inevitable ensemble; with an attitude toward historical chronology that posits origins and with life as a sense of the fleeting and ephemeral that lacks historical reference; with structures and with their impossibility; with a structure of feeling toward contemporary reality and with social orders where feelings mean nothing; with the contradiction of being both individuals and interrelated. The modern has been linked with the sureness of scientific truth and the honesty of both madness and the imagination; with a split between some meanings that are firmly anchored to their referents and those that are not; with Enlightenment values and the efficiency of Auschwitz; and with both the empowerment and containment of human potential. These definitions, gleaned from thinkers as diverse as Baudelaire, Marx, Darwin, Dewey, Nietzsche, and Foucault, were once intended to be only descriptive of modernity in the West. Moving beyond Europe and its colonies, the\n\nModern, Japanese, Literary, History 5\n\nnature of the modern has to become more complex if only because so much of it is grafted upon places and cultures whose own histories interact with it both well and badly. To be sure, many cogent observers have identified Japanese modernity, whether native or borrowed, in terms cognate with those used in and for the West. Fukuzawa Yukichi argued across his oeuvre that civilization (bunmei) commences with doubts generated within the self, but he was only the first to note critical subjectivity as indispensable to it. More materially, all that Japan aspired to since 1868—W. G. Beasley’s wish list was “constitutions, conscript armies, factories, Western-style novels and art”10 — has long been analyzed as congenitally related desires embodying universal, not merely Western, values. If since the 1950s, the notion of a non-Western modernity largely congruent with the West’s experience has been replaced by that of modernization, it is only because world events such as the Chinese Revolution, decolonization and the Cold War required, in Jürgen Habermas’s words, a term that “dissolves ‘modernity’ from its modern European origins and stylizes it into a spatio-temporally neutral model” amenable to ideological machinations.11 It is nonetheless impossible to speak of modernization without the model of modernity, destined to be imprecisely derived worldwide since modernity is a process of local subjectification as well as rationalization. In Japan, we can find many examples of modernity (kindaisei) defined as a functional model, which is to say a society with certain sets of features that largely coincide with those found in Euro-American societies. One of Japan’s leading literary historians, Miyoshi Yukio, defines modernity for Japan in just such terms as the period (jidai) of capitalist and democratic civil societies that prize notions of human liberty and freedom and the dignity of the individual.12 But this model is best illustrated by the descriptions of Japanese modernity/modernization produced by the 1960 Hakone Conference, at which Japanese and foreign scholars (largely American) came together to describe the rise of modern economic production, social rationalization, and enfranchisement in Japan and implicitly elsewhere in the non-Western world via a model largely devoid of historical determinism. At the time, dialectical materialism was an ideal dangerously Marxist in its implications given the worldwide stakes of the Cold War and the local challenge to American hegemony. In hindsight, historian Victor Koschmann concludes with little effort that the Americans were in Hakone on a political mission fueled by values and ideology even as they seemed eager to promote a “value-free” definition of modernization.13 For a conference strikingly devoid of insights from cultural or literary studies, one contribution was telling: Katō\n\n6 Introduction\n\nShūichi’s characterization of the lists of features to be found in modern societies (urbanization, a high degree of use of inanimate energy, mass communications, etc.) as akin to the symptoms of a disease. Katō, an important figure in postwar literary circles as well as a trained physician, recommended that his fellow conferees consider these symptoms’ “relationship in a syndrome so as to obtain a complete picture.”14 John Whitney Hall, the dean of the American scholars gathered at Hakone, responded that “the syndrome of symptoms described in our revised list . . . serves then to isolate a process of change and a condition of society,” an isolation that in Hall’s view exempted the Hakone Conference’s work from political ideology.15 Do we know better now? There are many ways we can reconstruct the ideological work performed at Hakone, such as the twentieth-century imperative to move from an earlier Orientalist discourse on the uniqueness of the West to one which insisted just as vigorously on the necessity that Japan draw from the well of whatever made Western modernity modern. But in retrospect another reconstruction might be Foucault’s clever critique of the idea of a symptom in the first place. In Europe in the eighteenth century, the same century that gave rise to the suprahistorical vision that enabled the practice of literary history, medicine codified the “uniquely privileged” observation of symptoms to know the invisible disease itself, leaving “the essence of the signified— the heart of the disease” “entirely exhausted in the intelligible syntax of the signifier.” The literary work in literary history is no more history than the “cough, fever, pain in the side, and difficulty in breathing” are pleurisy: but they are all we can see, or read. Just as “the blueing of the nails is an unfailing announcement of death,” the new lyric or story presents change but is not change, which is invisible.16 Despite the tendency of modernization theory to downplay it, modernity— including its literary configurations—has a geopolitical history equally unseen aside from its presumed indications. It is, if nothing else, a term for the “modes of social life or organization which emerged in Europe from the seventeenth century onward and which subsequently became more or less worldwide in their influence.”17 It is a history that in Japan occurred for the most part subsequent to Europe’s but before the rest of East Asia’s. It is also a history that unfolded at a geographical periphery, two facts related to each other. Just as modernity in Europe was reaching maturity (or decadence, in the view of some), Japan was grappling with structures and attitudes willed from what, while perhaps not too accurately termed a feudal past, certainly contested key features of basic modernization. These are features that, following sociologist Anthony\n\nModern, Japanese, Literary, History 7\n\nGiddons and others, I find in Japanese novels and stories to be the primacy of sexual or friendship relations over those of kinship, the proliferation of abstract systems across time and space, and the widespread fear no longer of nature or a god’s wrath but instead the fragile (un-)certainties of modernity itself. It is a basic question whether any setting outside Europe and its immediate offspring can sponsor modernity independent of the West’s historical precedent. If the impetus for modernity comes from without, as it did in a Japan genuinely threatened by the West, then the dependency of the periphery on the center denies it the vital requisite of agency, the self-fashioning so important to how we understand modernity. Under the threat of foreign encroachment, native systems were not at stake so much as the defense of the realm. Japanese were well aware of the Opium Wars and the subsequent infringements on Japan’s own sovereignty represented by Commodore Matthew Perry’s arrival in 1853. In the realm of modern Japanese literature, this question of authenticity has typically been asked within the ongoing debate over Japanese literature’s originality versus its mimicry of foreign exemplars. One answer is pessimistic: while Japan can have the world’s fastest trains or safest streets, the intellectual project of modernization, though not without its successes (affluence, democracy, scientific breakthroughs, Nobel Prizes in Literature, etc.), is seen as inherently contradictory and disappointing because it could not have been spontaneous. But some answers have been less fatalistic. During the Second World War, a cohort of Japanese intellectuals linked their empire’s forced eviction of the Western colonial powers with an overall critique of a modernity perceived, too, as a colonial ploy. Unfortunately, Japan’s own colonialism was built, brick by brick, upon that same indicted modernity. More successful in the view of some has been the accommodation of a peripheral modernity with what is, in effect, a newer idea of just what modernity may mean— or rather, a definition that emphasizes less the functional model that the Hakone Conference endorsed and more a specific, historical product that is recognizable not so much by its resemblance to older, pre- or proto-modern features but to the uncanny talent of dominant social agents and institutions to manage change, defuse crises, and accommodate changing international conditions. How Japan accomplished this is no mystery. It has happened elsewhere, too. This modernity counts among its indicators the emergence of the subject and the Foucauldian sciences of order that both produce and limit that subject. But it is also attested in the consolidation of the individual to the authority of the modern nation-state and the irony of a people increasingly permitted physical\n\n8 Introduction\n\nand intellectual liberties at the same time the repressive powers of society are internalized and consolidated. It has been cited as evidence of Japan’s so-called incomplete modernity that a fully individuated citizenry never emerged, or that its state never fully converted its power into the logic of that citizenry’s everyday life. But that is not so much incomplete as it is what Japanese modernity— yes, fully formed— is. Japan’s modern success is also said to have achieved great material benefits and social entitlements despite (and occasionally because of) being non-Western. However, that view, in addition to being patronizingly Orientalist, fails to see that in Japan, as elsewhere, the specific things and rights in which those achievements are found also express how power is exercised within its modernity. One aim of this book is to reexamine certain key conjunctions in the history of Japan’s modern literature where we can excavate just how literary texts came to embody emerging, dominant or resistant strategies of power in society. My attempt here is to map modern Japan’s “governing metaphors” in two senses: how the terms of literary language were policed by the state (“state” being convenient shorthand for coordinated institutions of central authority), and how those terms themselves exercised their own power, governing in turn various critiques of the state or its logic. As Hayden White remarked, echoing Nietzsche, every discipline has to be defined in large measure by what it forbids its practitioners to do, as well as what it may enable.18 Two early efforts at writing literary history in modern Japan illustrate how the project was imbricated with modern Japanese society and governance from the start. Literary historiography is an enterprise launched in and by modernity, commencing in the West’s eighteenth century. With the formation of modern nation-states in Europe, literary history was outfitted with the enabling new technology of modernity. If we differentiate literary history from literary criticism by declaring the former concerned with literature as creation and the latter with it as an institution, then literary history joins a host of other contemporary projects dedicated to the construction and not just description of cultural legacies as part of modernity’s architecture with the reorganization of postmonarchial Europe into nations requiring, among other things, literary pedigrees. By the nineteenth century the genre had become truly popular. Hippolyte Taine’s 1863 History of English Literature was a best seller in its day. With the injection of the ideas of Hegel and the Schlegels, it became self-consciously intellectual, a ground for the rehearsal of ideas on race, dialectics, and the pedagogy of modern citizens. Later, Marx, Darwin, Spengler, Weber, Adorno, and, in our\n\nModern, Japanese, Literary, History 9\n\nown time, Foucault and Geertz lent further grand designs to a literary practice that was, until the late twentieth century, generally a triumphant narrative: a description of transitions from one state of affairs to another propelled by a chain of causes and their effects. In this developmental model, the early history of the novel has to start with something that is not the novel (diaries, newspapers, the epic) and then proceed, with the confidence of inevitability, to the feat of modern prose fiction. Nietzsche’s The Birth of Tragedy is a good example: it is literary history with a plot, a protagonist in the form of an immaterial Zeitgeist. Like all literary histories in the West that owe something to the genre’s impetus under Romantic thought, Nietzsche’s was riveted by origins. Like other literary histories governed by a belief in historically inevitable nationhood— certainly the case in Japan— it needed to culminate in the satisfactory account of a great national classic in the past and the potential of a nation’s great modern novel in the present. Literary history often had its telos in the heralded moment of a country’s national unification, or definitive separation from a colonial power’s own cultural hegemony. “We study literature in a discipline,” writes Timothy Brennan, “with roots in a philological tradition first formulated with ideas of nations in mind, in the very period when modern nation-states were first being formed.”19 The ideological work of literary history was to confirm that each of its canonized texts embodies the national culture’s singular, splendid history. In Japan, that work meant a focus on junbungaku (pure literature), a term coined in the late nineteenth century to counter the alien tradition of kanbungaku (writing in Chinese) and gesaku (frivolous literature) at home that fairly dominated the first half of that century. At the same time, literary history was dogged by the accusation that it failed to explain aesthetic achievement adequately. If a literary history did not account for genius, then it proved Benedetto Croce’s contention that the genre was impossible to begin with since every work of art was unique and therefore could not be categorized or generalized. There was indeed an aporetical problem with literary history at the level of the modernity it attempted to theorize. As a kind of representational narrative, its own claims to realism were always as problematic as those made by the novels it sought to explain. Other assaults on literary (and not just literary) historiography identified other knotty contradictions. Do texts produce the classifications they are placed within, or the other way around? Is there a closed hermeneutic circle between texts and the concepts that organize them (or are organized by them)? What is the relationship between a historical process and the values that are alternatively credited for\n\n10 Introduction\n\nbeing its result, or cause? The greatest charge of literary history’s implausibility came when the genre was effectively left for dead in the West after attacks from Russian formalism and its scholastic heir, New Criticism. By the late— and increasingly Sophist— twentieth century, the only new literary histories being written were avowedly postmodern and paralyzingly ironic. (I have the 1987 Columbia Literary History of the United States and the 1989 New History of French Literature in mind.) In his influential 1970 essay “Literary History and Literary Modernity,” Paul de Man argued that literature, history, and modernity were all hopelessly incompatible words. Modernity would forsake the notion of history; literature, with its “obsession with a tabula rasa, with new beginnings” would be equally antithetical.20 This and other skeptical ideas that insinuated themselves into the common sense of literary scholars was the death warrant of traditional literary history. Where it survives, it is largely an antihistory, not much more than a record of ruptures and discontinuities, all of which are as suspect as the unities and continuities they have replaced. Still, habits persist. Lawrence Buell surveys three examples of American literary histories and concludes that all share the same unexamined convention: the concept of the literary work as a sociogram, defined as “the encapsulated formation of a work’s significance as historical artifact and national product.”21 The same is observed of recent literary historiography in Japan. Kamei Hideo points out that while a turn away from analysis of a work’s content has served to disengage the significance of a work from its moment, the concomitant turn toward structure in the work has rejoined the two.22 Such coincidences are not guaranteed. While the rise and fall of literary history in the West influenced Japan, its own literary history traces a markedly different path. Literary historiography in Japan started in the late 1870s with government tracts such as the Ministry of Education’s Nihon kyōiku shiryaku (A Brief History of Japanese Learning, 1877) and Taguchi Ukichi’s Western-influenced Nihon kaika shōshi (A Short History of Japanese Civilization, 1877–82), but it was never rendered wholly cynical, as happened in the West. It is a continuing process for reasons that have to do with the distinct track not only of Japanese literature but of Japanese modernity and its present-day residual effects. Those reasons comprise my prolegomenon for writing literary history today. The emerging modern Japanese state’s first attempt to tell the story of its country’s literature, Nihon kyōiku shiryaku, was prepared with Philadelphia’s 1876 Centennial International Exhibition in mind; the audience was the world. It takes a Sinocentric, Confucianist approach. It begins with little reference to\n\nModern, Japanese, Literary, History 11\n\nliterature but eventually declares that Japanese bungaku, in the sense of scholarship, is essentially kanbungaku writings in Chinese. Medicine, for example, is regarded as bungaku, since it teaches the proper conduct of one’s life. Japanese literature is advertised as a particularly talented branch of Chinese culture (kangaku), but a branch nonetheless. But even this earliest example of literary historiography in modern Japan cannot be understood properly without knowing it was initially proposed— by an English employee of the ministry, David Morley— for the benefit of visitors to Philadelphia who might think Japan has no claim to a literature.23 Or more precisely, without the benefits that Westernization was conferring, ten years into state-sponsored modernization, on a tradition that once may have valued the lyric over prose but now celebrated the practical (jitsugaku) over the poetic. The earliest example of Japanese literary history after the Meiji Revolution is seldom read without attention to a West that challenged it. For the Ministry of Education, the West was an adversary to be impressed in part to defuse its threat; for Taguchi Ukichi (one of the most important figures in Meiji Japan for economics as well as historiography), the West was a place that, like China before it, could provide Japan with intellectual vigor even as it menaced it with military and commercial prowess. Taguchi’s Nihon kaika shōshi is much more than a history of Japan and its culture. Published in six substantial volumes from 1877 (when Taguchi was only twenty-three) to 1882, it surveyed Japanese civilization from its origins to the start of the Meiji era. Like those histories that followed, his Shōshi relied not only on the writings of Tokugawa-period (1603–1868) historians such as Rai Sanyō and Arai Hakuseki, but on Western predecessors Henry Thomas Buckle (History of Civilization in England), Herbert Spenser, Thomas Macaulay, and John Stuart Mill. For Taguchi, literature, per se, was always a dialectical play between two forms of writing: jō (sentiment, what we might now call the subjective) and chi (knowledge, or the objective). But for literature to progress in Taguchi’s estimation, it had to privilege chi over jō, prose over poetry, and the lives of the common people over those of the elites. Both views were not wholly contrary to that expressed in the Shiryaku or indeed the predominant opinion of the Japanese intelligentsia ten years into Meiji, a period when national concerns remained fixed on Japan’s existential competition with the Western powers. Taguchi, writing under the combined influence of Western modernity and Confucianism adapted over the Tokugawa period to accommodate an emerging native humanism, defined literature (bungaku) as “the manifestation of\n\n12 Introduction\n\nthe human soul” (hito no kokoro no kenzō nari).24 In this context, traditional definitions of bun (literature) were significantly reworked. Long opposed to bu (weapons), bun was the pre-Meiji term for what would become bungaku, and it was essentially a Sinitic, nominally Confucian concept. Bun— better understood as learning or scholarship— was proximate to the concept of the Way (Chinese tao). As Hayashi Razan succinctly puts it, “Where there is the Way, there is Bun; where there is no Way, there is no Bun.”25 In short, bun was instrumental. It referred to the intellectual and ethical means for keeping men in good order. More specifically, it referred to the study of the practical means of government.26 The source of this knowledge, and therefore the principal idiom of bun, was the Chinese classics and their commentaries. The rise of kokugaku (national learning) in the mid- to late Tokugawa began to challenge this worldview, and in the Meiji period the definition of bun (soon bungaku) underwent a revealing and decisive shift. It was not until half a dozen years into the Meiji period that the term bungaku appeared in print, and it was not until the late 1880s that the word came to be used predominantly in the sense that it is today, that is, as imaginative writing.27 It is an irony of history that Western terms for literature were rendered into Sinitic Japanese with the morpheme gaku, or, “learning.”28 Prior to the Meiji period and in keeping with the Chinese organization of knowledge, literature was everything but fanciful prose. By the end of the Meiji period, classics such as the Man’yōshū, Genji monogatari, and Kōshoku ichidai otoko, once uta (poem), monogatari (narrative), and ukiyozōshi (popular fiction), respectively, were all subsumed under the omnibus of literature (bungaku).29 In 1890, when bungaku was defined as “all proper knowledge and all proper emotions” that make us human, the term had obviously traveled far from neo-Confucian definitions of bun in the Tokugawa period.30 But its transformation was not done. In his 1908 novel Gubinjinsō (Poppies), Natsume Sōseki (1867–1916) qualified what Japanese today call bungaku as pure (jun) literature, since the term still retained Tokugawa nuances of all knowledge, not simply that garnered or conveyed via what was awarded, or relegated, to the faculty of imagination. But more significantly, by Sōseki’s time, just what was bungaku was a more unruly matter than definitions in the few early literary histories. To draw the fuller picture, this book attends to matters of the day not immediately literary at all. This turn in the episteme of the literary from bun to bungaku was facilitated by the evolving taxonomy of academic knowledge within the confines of Japan’s\n\nModern, Japanese, Literary, History 13\n\npreeminent institution of higher learning, Tokyo Imperial University. In 1887, the university established the curricular and research divisions of English literature (Igirisu bungaku ka) and German literature (Doitsu bungaku ka). In 1889, a French literature unit (Furansu bungaku ka) joined them. This is important to note since Japanese intellectuals who, beginning in the 1880s, were using the word bungaku in terms congruent with those in England (literature), Germany (Literatur) and France (littérature) were institutionally linked with Tokyo Imperial University. Like so many words of the day, such as kenpō (constitution), keizai (economics), geijutsu (art), and so forth— Sinitic vocabulary expediently coined for an age of modernization and therefore signs of a hybrid modernity— bungaku was another index of what has been called the bastard child (otoshigo) of mid-Meiji’s drive toward Westernization.31 Tsubouchi Shōyō (1859–1935), author of the 1886 theoretical manifesto Shōsetsu shinzui (Essence of fiction) was one such Tokyo Imperial University graduate. That his work was so entitled instead of “Essence of Literature [bungaku]” had something to do with how his alma mater deployed these terms. In the mid-Meiji period, bungaku referred to the classics of Chinese and Japanese literature but not yet to modern fiction, a genre for which shōsetsu was reserved but not yet subsumed under the -gaku of bungaku, an addition that literary historian Isoda Kōichi declared an irony of history a century later.32 Shōyō and others of his generation were ambivalent about the worth of fiction and literature, as the varied career of his protégé and collaborator Futabatei Shimei (1864–1909) illustrates. Vacillating between a government career and his ambitions as a novelist, Shimei’s résumé recalls the diverse and not always consistent meaning of the word bungaku. From the start, bungaku was deemed necessary for Japanese modernity but also critical of it, as Shimei’s own Ukigumo (Floating Clouds, 1887–89), often hailed as Japan’s first modern novel, attested, with its story of a bureaucrat both educated and rendered superfluous by the Meiji state. This ambiguity was evident by the late 1870s and in works of literary history such as the Shiryaku and the Shōshi, both of which attempted to resolve it through the regulatory work of literary history (bungakushi). At stake was not only Japan’s reputation as a civilized nation but the definition of its proof, a national modern literature. Was it to be, in the spirit of the first decade of the Meiji period, a branch of practical learning? Or alternatively, was it to be like the great imaginative works of Western literature, objects of envy in Japan? Our twentieth-century sense of the word bungaku is the legacy of Japanese literary history’s efforts early in the Meiji period but culminating in the\n\n14 Introduction\n\nlast decade of the nineteenth century. British philologist and Tokyo Imperial University professor Basil Hall Chamberlain might have been able to claim in the early 1880s with some justification that the Japanese, in their frantic “pursuit of the advantages of the material side of European civilization” were exhibiting a “disdain for everything poetic, or even literary.”33 But that was to change soon enough, as the Japanese extended their work in building a new nation-state to literature. If true that nations are most appropriately distinguished by the way they are imagined, then Japanese intellectuals and officialdom made full use of their country’s past and present hoard of literary texts to guide just how and where that imagination would be cultivated. There was ample precedent. The Meiji period was when many of Japan’s national traditions were variously invented, systematized, and ideologized as state apparatuses. There was, for example, philologist and lexicographer Ueda Kazutoshi’s German-influenced theory of Japanese as a national language (kokugo), a parallel with a national citizenry (kokumin) and a nation-state (kokka). Still, we do not conjure out of thin air. Historian Mary Elizabeth Berry has shown, citing a great deal of premodern fiction, that there was a firm grasp of “‘our country,’ regularly identified with ‘our people,’” by the turn of the eighteenth century.34 Ethnologist Orikuchi Shinobu used the new word kokubungaku (national literature) in talking about the earliest Japanese written records and their mention of “marvelous visitors” (marebito) a millennium earlier.35 The question of a nation-state (kokka) may be another matter, but the Japanese were always going to be a nation on account of “the fatality of language and the necessity of citizenship in the modern world.”36 Just how they did so is what made them less than fully commensurate with the rest of the world. Perhaps what we do instead of constructing our traditions is remember and promote them selectively, and here is one role that modern literary history in Japan has played. The nomination of a national literature was the direct product of a national literary history (kokubungakushi), not the other way around. To illustrate how this happened, and with what consequences, it is useful to look at the 1890 Nihon bungakushi (History of Japanese Literature) written by Mikami Sanji and Takatsu Kuwasaburō, classmates of Ueda Kazutoshi at Tokyo Imperial University. This work, like Taguchi’s decades earlier, cannot be discussed without reference to Western literary history in addition to the burgeoning Japanese cultural nationalism. Taine and H. M. Posnett influenced Mikami, and his Nihon bungakushi shared with them Spencerian ideas of social organization and, more importantly, the belief in a national literature as the expression of Taine’s\n\nModern, Japanese, Literary, History 15\n\ntroika of race, milieu, and moment. In his own somewhat tautological phrasing, Mikami defined a national literature as “something through which the country’s people [kokumin] express the nation’s unique thought [shisō], emotion [kanjō], and imagination [sōzō] in the written form of its national language [kokugo].”37 There were local reasons for why and how these ideas found fertile ground. Mikami and his colleagues were heir to eighteenth-century kokugaku, in which Japanese literature, in the process of differentiating it from Chinese literature, was endowed with ineffably Japanese characteristics derived from or parallel to equally ineffable ethnic, cultural qualities. The preface to Nihon bungakushi makes clear its debt to the Meiji discourse of practical learning when it declares its objective to be the demonstration, based on scientific research, of the use of literature (bungaku no kōyō) and the value of literary history (bungakushi no kachi). The authors insist theirs is the first true literary history in Japan, however hastily it was written. They had to familiarize themselves with the discipline of literary history in the West as well as confer with other writers and intellectuals in Japan to produce an amalgam to explain and evaluate the development of literature in Japan and its writers’ styles. The end result of the “unprecedented . . . comprehensive organization” of their history is to prove, they hope, that Japan’s literature is in no way inferior to any other nation’s— and that it is destined to rise “like the morning sun” even farther.38 Literary history, the authors argue, is subsumed under historiography in general and therefore comes in two varieties: world history and national history. If what makes a Japanese literary history literary is its narrative of “the origins, development and transformation of literature,” what makes it national is its restriction to those phenomena told historically within the context of a single nation.39 Indeed, a national literary history is also the history of a nation; a national literature rises and falls with the history inseparable from each nation’s “innate signs of vigor.” Literary history, then, is a part of the history of civilization (bunmeishi), even if literary history, to be truly historical, must note what is low and vulgar as well what is as high and refined. Literary historians must take notice of political, social, religious, and other contexts of writing in addition to the writing itself. It is vital, Mikami and Takatsu insist, that Japan, too, have its narrative history of a rich literature, a history that will deepen the love of the Japanese citizenry (kokumin) for their country. Unlike the earlier Shiryaku, Nihon bungakushi does not regard writing in Chinese (kangaku) as properly Japanese literature. Moreover, it departs from\n\n16 Introduction\n\nthe Sinitic view of the literary as essentially the poetic when its authors declare they focus on prose writing above all other genres. “Fiction,” they rule, “is simply one variety of elegant literature [bibungaku]. It would be impossible to speak of the proper progress of literature had it not developed in tandem with rational disciplines [ribungaku] such as history, philosophy and political science.”40 Moreover, Nihon bungakushi— whose second volume was planned as a textbook— has an explicitly pedagogical purpose. Japanese literature needs to be taught in the schools lest literature be thought of as a frivolous plaything (ganrōbutsu): like the endorsement of fiction, a necessary conceit for both Japanese literature’s modernity and its vital role in the collateral construction of the nation-state. In the first chapter of Nihon bungakushi Mikami and Takatsu categorically define the object of their history as literature (bungaku). All that is literary, they stipulate, must satisfy four conditions. It must have an identifiable style derived from the talent (myō) of each writer. It must demonstrate human thought, sentiment, and imagination. It has to edify and entertain. Lastly, it is required to speak to great numbers of people, not few. At the same time the literary is to be differentiated from other types of writing. Of course literature has relationships with such things as jurisprudence and ethics, but just as in recent times Japan has seen the increasing differentiation of labor occupations, for example, so have scholarly discourses witnessed their own necessary fragmentation. Aesthetics and political economy are naturally literary to the extent they are expressed in language, but Mikami and Takatsu note that universities specialized these sorts of writing institutionally. The authors insist what makes literature distinct is the requirement it possess omoshirosa, “interest,” “charm” or “pleasure.” When we read law, we are interested merely in the meaning the words can supply us. But when we read literature, the words must somehow be an end in themselves. That is by no means a decadent goal, they quickly add, for it is only via pleasure that literature can hope to successfully improve kokumin no seishin, the “spirit of the national citizenry.”41 This is true, they concede, of literature in all nations. But that is not to say that all national literatures are alike. Hegel had already accounted for cultural differences in terms of just how aware each evolving nation was of its spirit (Geist). Were each nation’s sentiments, climate, geography, language, and customs alike, then so would be their literatures, and we would be saved the need for national literary histories. Each country has its national distinctiveness (kokumin kokuyu no tokusei), and Mikami and Takatsu give examples of how the Japanese diverged from the Chinese in the past and the West at present. They say it is the\n\nModern, Japanese, Literary, History 17\n\nburden of literary history to explore and elucidate these differences fully. In this sense, then, literary history must be at the same time the history of civilizations. Mikami and Takatsu declare, in other words, that their literary history expresses the national distinctiveness of their country and that its utilitarian function is to further national achievement through its pedagogy. For them, Japanese literary history is conceived as a national allegory. The dialectical nature of the evolution of literature, passing through encounters with various foreign cultures and drawing strength from each, is much the same story told of the Japanese nation as a whole at this time. Indeed, kokubungaku (national literature), a neologism that had won out by the third decade of the Meiji period over such competitors as wabungaku ( Japanese literature), was developed as a codified disciplinary regime of texts in lockstep with other material and discursive systems of the Meiji nation-state, all of them to some degree a conflation of culture (bunka), race (jinshu) and populace (minzoku). Modernization, it may be said generally, transforms agrarian societies and their structures with the notion of culture, a new form of identity largely cognate with nationality, and requires the kind of literacy, education, and construct of cultural homogeneity that literary history is precisely charged with supplying. Critics and theorists in the West, such as Fredric Jameson, though they have on occasion exempted “great eastern empires” (one supposes Japan), have regarded non-Western literature, particularly those genres developed from “western machineries of representation, such as the novel,” as invariably national allegories due to the absence of what Jameson, for one, regards as the crucial absence of a subjective split between the public sphere and the individual.42 While such a view fails to satisfactorily account for the various morphologies of the modern Japanese novel, I agree with Jameson that the history of the modern novel outside the West, even in great Eastern empires, cannot be written without taking the presence and authority of the West into account, and in ways that point to a pressure on non-Western intellectuals to tell their stories coordinate with the exigencies of the histories their nations, emergent or otherwise, face. Any literary history today must explore contexts, conventional or otherwise, but contexts overlap if not neatly coincide with discourses of national identity and distinctiveness. This is hardly literary history’s unique claim. If the question in Western Europe is the correlation between the rise of the novel and the rise of the middle class, then for a history of the novel in modern Japan we must additionally inquire: what is the correlation between the rise of shōsetsu (fiction) and the rise of the modern national subject (Nihonjin)? The assumptions\n\n18 Introduction\n\nand processes at work in nineteenth-century Japan were hardly unique, or even rare. Historian of American literature Larzer Ziff notes that in the early decades of the Republic, the literary was coextensive with political culture, “even as literature was coextensive with knowledge.”43 The two were rapidly divided in a rupture repeated a hundred years later in Japan’s Meiji period. Just why this should be so in two modern(-izing) nations so different in their histories is one of the problems I explore in this book, and I state as a preface that the modern, whether it migrates between regions of the globe or evolves independently and similarly, has been observed to take roughly parallel interests in the morphology of its discourses, among them that of the literary. Language and writing have tended to be organized in comparable ways in modern nation-states. Any literary history other than the simply taxonomical has to ask why. It is neither radical nor original to argue that the history of modern literature is inextricably linked with the history of the modern in general, though for a variety of reasons some historians have sought to inoculate these histories from each other. Literary history always requires something other than literature itself. As René Wellek observed, literature’s history is the only one that can be that of something else. However discontinuous we may believe history to be, at some point we are forced to organize it, or as Jameson made a maxim after complaining about the necessity of doing so, “We cannot not periodize.”44 What a history of texts always entails are fewer diachronic narratives and more synchronic descriptions: con-texts. The historicity of a novel is not the same as its historical context, nor will it do to declare that literature has an historical context, which is close to meaningless since that includes everything temporally contingent or variable, infinite to the point of being indescribable. Just what narrower range of context the literary historian chooses is motivated by any one or combination of the factors David Perkins has enumerated: “tradition, ideological interests, the aesthetic requirements of writing a literary history, the assertions of authors and their contemporaries about their affinities and antipathies, the similarities that the literary historian observes among authors and/or texts, and the needs of professional careers and the politics of power in institutions.”45 Without context there is no interpretation, though interpretation need not decide what a work is about. Rather, the goal always remains “to appreciate what plural constitutes it,” as Roland Barthes put it.46 Our reflex has been to establish a work of literature as evidence of something else, be it the author’s life or his milieu. This instrumentality of literature is now often blamed for\n\nModern, Japanese, Literary, History 19\n\nmisunderstanding how literature, always a social practice, is less a second-order representation than an active agent in how the contradictions of lived reality are lived and how the social relations that produce such contradictions are guaranteed reproduction. Just which contexts to choose is the rub. Historicisms multiply whenever we minimize the distinction between texts and con-texts. The old story is told of Japanese ceramics experts being summoned to the Victoria and Albert to appraise the value of the museum’s tea bowls, but being unable to do so since the curators had unwittingly discarded the original boxes upon which key information of provenance, and so forth was noted.47 None of this is really new. Quintilian said, “Not only what we say and how we say it is of importance, but also the circumstances under which we say it.”48 But just what constitutes a circumstance has changed. Thanks to the vogue of New Historicism and its cultural poetics of a generation ago, few contexts strike us any longer as too farfetched; anecdotes generate their own synecdochal auras of totality. If we now believe that literary texts and nonliterary texts circulate inseparably in complex networks, it is in part because some historiographical practices are energized by a free-fall faith in the power of contingency to explain everything. To say that texts are historically embedded and must be studied in the full range of their specificity sounds intuitively right but does not get us far. A better map is required. There may be “no escape from contingency,”49 but we are trapped within it with other, less casual things. Foucault noted that modern ethnology established a dichotomy between structure (the thinkable) and event (unthinkable, irrational). The event is an absolute contingency, which for better or worse led to its rejection (and that of history too) by the mainstream of modern anthropology. Foucault’s reaction was: let’s distinguish among events and be sure to “differentiate the networks and levels to which they belong.”50 He had his own problems with an insufficient theory of the historical, but there is more here than in the toolbox of many literary historians. The danger, noted by Hayden White, is that we uncritically ascribe to (real) events a “coherence, integrity, fullness, and closure of an image of life that is and can only be imaginary.”51 Still, these insights have on occasion been taken literally, if ironically. There may indeed be a world of factual chaos out there for which belief in contingency is an attractive antidote, but there are others. Carrying historically contingent contextualism too far is a risk in literary history. Contextual explanations can never be conclusive, if only because the path that runs from event to text, from anecdote to novel, is too faint to mark. Too often the context (for example, exorcism) of a text (Lear) locks the work of\n\n20 Introduction\n\nart in an effective structure of necessity which has to guarantee its effects even before it has been enacted. When Stephen Greenblatt ruled that the “task of understanding then depends not on the extraction of an abstract set of principles, and still less on the application of a theoretical model, but rather on an encounter with the singular, the specific, and the individual,” he in no way freed himself from the need of principles or a theoretical model to know what is meant by “the singular, the specific, and the individual.”52 Everything ends up sewn neatly with no loose threads at its plainest, or circular at its cleverest. One alternative is to really abandon our affection for causes and effects and simply describe correspondences between texts and events. Some of the events I discuss are anointed in Japanese history as jiken (major incidents). Others are hardly of note. Other histories by other people, using a similar method, could be written with reference to different events marking either crises replete with the ambiguities, rhetoric and ideological dodges that works of literature have laid bare, or crises that works of literature themselves have created. In any case, correspondences between these events and history are less relations than they are articulations, the construction of one set of relations out of another. This is still a theory of contexts, but not as background. They are what Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari reserved the metaphor of “rhizomes” for, assemblages of interactions. A context has to be defined as a structured field within which texts have varying near and far linkages with other social and material practices, none of which is predictable beforehand. The project of reconstructing this kind of historical context has nothing to do with literary history’s hope for grasping a whole society in its presumed reality. That is a romantic (and Romantic) ambition that literary historians of Japan (whether Japanese or not) have clung to long and tightly. One problem plaguing Japanese literary historiography has been the belief that Japan’s modern literature is radically estranged from context, and therefore, its history from contextualism. “The distinguishing characteristic of the modern Japanese novel,” wrote Nakamura Mitsuo, “is the fact that it developed in a manner quite removed from the context of the surrounding environment. This applies not only to the novel or to literature alone, but is characteristic of everything which has ever gone by the name of ‘culture’ from the Meiji period until our own day.”53 But it is impossible for anything we would want to deem cultural to develop free of context. Self-appointed guardian of literary studies Harold Bloom may want to dismiss cultural criticism as “astonishing garbage,”54 but the articulations between literary text and the rest of modern Japanese culture are where we discover how\n\nModern, Japanese, Literary, History 21\n\nthat culture allows its people both to overcome the contradictions they face in their lives and to make sure the means of social production are guaranteed reproduction. The Rise and Fall of Modern Japanese Literature voices my objection to Nakamura’s view by suggesting that the contexts in which modern Japanese literature developed were not wholly arbitrary. The relationship between text and context is tautological, but not entirely. The history of modern Japanese literature is coordinate with how the exercise of power— on behalf of the state and against it— was woven in ways both Japanese and generically modern. To prove that, I discuss Japanese authors and works: some canonical but some not. In addition I write about contexts bearing on Japanese literature but not themselves literature: newspaper journalism, theater, the influence of Western fiction, and that of the fine arts. Ralph Cohen spoke for a generation of literary historians when he called “inadequate a conception of literature . . . that takes no account of paintings that include writing or illustrate writing, that disregards the music in sung prayers and oratorios, that sees no relation between Descartes’ Meditations and the meditative poem or Shaftebury’s and Mandeville’s dialogues and the development of the novel, between the narratives of criminals and the parodies of affairs of state.”55 But there is also talk of things not yet found in Japanese literary histories: stock exchanges, spinning mills, the writing of constitutions, television, theories of multiple personalities, and handheld digital pets. I think about Korea, boogie-woogie music, and a serial murderer, all parts of Roland Barthes’s plural. I do not aim to be either conclusive or exhaustive. Neither do I intend to let the literary dissolve within a grab bag of culture, as did the 2009 A New Literary History of America. Still, with David Perkins, I believe that the “contextual explanation of literary texts rests ultimately on faith, on an intuition.”56 I mean to sketch a surface best graphed by reference to how Japanese literature has been shaped in ways congruent with how the nation evolved from an oligarchic state to a constitutional monarchy; from an industrial-militarist power to a modern, democratic and rich capitalist nation; and now, in the early twenty-first century, into something upon whose precipice we stand and are barely peering into and can only name at the risk of soon looking foolish. I place my book amid other recent histories of modern Japanese literature and acknowledge my debt to them while explaining why I have added another. One could easily account for the many literary histories that continue to be written in Japan, or by foreign scholars of it, by noting how relatively late the\n\n22 Introduction\n\ngenre came to Japan. Japan might be allowed at least a good century and half of literary historiography before it, too, finds the practice depleted or déclassé. I suggest that Japanese literary histories, such as those by Donald Keene, Katō Shūichi, and Konishi Jin’ichi, continue to be written because the history of Japanese modernity, whether it is over or not, continues to press certain issues more insistently than is done in the West. Keene, Katō, and Konishi are informative and useful; each proceeds from a different repertoire of reading, but they share a commitment to the canon as a measure of literary merit and to the construction of a chronological line that embeds that canon sequentially. ( Japanese literary history’s ever-present adjunct, the nenpyō [chronological table], retains its influence today.57) Each of their histories accepts Jameson’s demand for periods, and within each period a pyramid of literary value. Each has appeared in both English and Japanese. Undergraduates regularly consult them, and they are what The Rise and Fall of Modern Japanese Literature will be compared to. I, along with my predecessors, accept canons as inevitable as long as we continue to print, teach, and critique some works and not others. I also accept the commonsense deployment of a forward chronology, since writers can be cognizant only of what comes before them, not after. But then we part company. In 1991, the government-funded National Institute of Japanese Literature dedicated its annual international conference to the theme of Japanese literary history. The highlight of those three days was the unprecedented appearance before the audience of all three scholars who had recently made literary history in Japan so popular: Keene, Katō, and Konishi. I was in the audience. Each was asked why he decided to write a literary history. Keene replied he wanted to give his readers something with eiensei (permanence). His literary history was one, he believed, that would not require amendment. It would be the truth of modern Japanese literature rather a cultured appreciation of it. This is the naïve dream of some historians: to fix and make a sure record of the past. David Perkins has pointed out the obvious, that “partisanship and simplification are very common in literary histories.”58 Keene’s history of Japan’s modern literature, Dawn to the West, uses language that leaves no doubt of the author’s confidence. Masamune Hakuchō (1879–1962) is “unendearing”; Satomi Ton (1888–1983) is a “lightweight . . . immoralist.” The “truths” of Kamura Isota (1897–1933) are dismissed as “insufficient,” while Mishima Yukio’s (1925–70) Kamen no kokuhaku (Confessions of a Mask, 1949) was somehow never “fully understood.” While these views were in dispute at the time that Keene voiced them and even more so today, he was not inclined to revisit them.\n\nModern, Japanese, Literary, History 23\n\n“Once I completed a chapter and moved on to the next one,” Keene wrote, “the temptation has been to think with relief that I ‘disposed’ of it.”59 Keene’s ambition for the longevity of his literary history was unsurprisingly met with incredulity at the conference, from his fellow panelists especially. But I wish to defend Dawn to the West— not on the grounds of its advertised permanence but for opposite reasons. While Keene’s history may be the least erudite of the three, it is also the most promising because it opened the door to the demonstrable multiplicity of reception and interpretation. Even Keene, in his rhetoric, admits to a certain problem with ascertaining the value of the books and stories he discusses. He uses more than one yardstick in measuring literariness, and with that multiplicity falls apart any hope of the evaluation of literature being unitary now or ever. Throughout Dawn to the West he refers to “the Japanese reader” and “the Western reader.” Leaving aside the question of just what these archetypes are or how they have been arrived at, Keene treats his readerly categories as if he were neither, or rather both, having unobstructed access to the minds of the Japanese and those of us not. There is the Japanese reader, the Western reader, and then there is Donald Keene, the voice of the presiding literary historian/judge who would forgo talk of his own particular perspective in order to render permanent verdicts. Of Shimazaki Tōson (1872–1943), Keene writes that his “Spring [Haru, 1908] has little appeal for Western readers, but Japanese readers . . . can be stirred by the youthful hopes of the Meiji past.”60 Just how Keene knows this is irrelevant. The point is that by positing the existence of two novels entitled Haru by Tōson— one for us and one for them—Keene places the determinant of a text’s worth not in the words themselves, or the author’s intent, but in the reception of the text by its variegated readers. Keene is torn in two directions: Keene as belletristic arbiter and Keene as amateur anthropologist eager to point out how often unique and incomparable experiences of Japanese and Western reading can be. The obvious critique aside, this latter insight of Keene’s should be encouraged. His intuition saves his literary history from the datedness and naïveté of earlier times. His solipsistic dichotomy of the Japanese reader and the Western reader, though heir to Orientalist canards, leads to the possibility of literary history that is no longer an encyclopedic catalog of great works, but instead a self-conscious and even humble investigation into the sociology of reading within a given linguistic and cultural milieu at a given time. In effect this would be a study of reception, by which I mean a study of literacy, its technologies, and its telos.61 “Consciousness and subjectivity are unrepresentable,”\n\n24 Introduction\n\nwrites Fredric Jameson, “only situations of modernity can be narrated.”62 The history of literary modernity has to be interdisciplinary and drawn on knowledge far beyond the ken of the narrowly literary. Given the vast charge of such a study, it has to be strategically interrogative rather than confidently narrative. What previous literary histories have done may be incomplete or prejudiced, but that invites us to do something else. My own effort, The Rise and Fall of Modern Japanese Literature, argues that the course of Japan’s modern literature is no passive reflection of its national, cultural modernity, but instead one of the technologies that actively produced it. At the same time, remembering that a novel, in the words of Edward Said, “is neither a frigate nor a bank draft,”63 I mean to explore the particular and often autonomous work of art. It is there, in the work of metaphor, that the vitality as well as the strictures of the modern is possible. But governing metaphors reminds us that the state and its array of apparatuses are no strangers to rhetoric and how it rules our everyday lives and the imagination of something, which is not everyday. “Literary history cannot simply be a genealogy of what has been written,” writes one Japanese critic; “it has to include the gulf between the written and what is not.”64 One scholar has stated, “Twentieth-century Japanese fiction has been plagued by a dearth of imagination.”65 That is not true. No modern society can be without a cultural life that is not its expression but its fantastical complement; it is there to compensate for the real and virtual insufficiencies of an otherwise totalized modern life. The metaphors for modernity that literature supplies us are the rhetoric through which perception is conditioned, generated, and go on to govern. The chapters that follow argue that the imagination plays an intrinsic role in the history of modern Japan. They look not just at what modern Japanese literature says, but at what it does and for whom. The gaps in my survey are many. Writing in the early twenty-first century, Kawanishi Masaaki spoke for the field when he said the history of modern Japanese literature is a hundred and twenty years old, dated from Shimei’s Ukigumo and divided neatly in two by defeat in the Second World War.66 I devote little attention to either. Japan is home to two Nobel Prize winners in literature, but neither laureate gets his own chapter. Some clamor for an “entirely new ‘Japanese literary history’” that accounts for the imaginative power of anime and manga in media and society.67 One critic has attempted it with movies and rock music, another with baseball.68 A valiant attempt was made to tell its ancient history as the embodiment of moe, an affect only recently discovered in present-day euphoric attachments to stuffed toys or action figures.69 This is none of those. I will soon be lectured\n\nModern, Japanese, Literary, History 25\n\non all my omissions, but that is why literary history, despite its much-heralded death, persists. Half a century ago the journal New Literary History asked its own existential question: “Is Literary History Obsolete?” But then, just what is this excited, resuscitated talk today of “world literature,” if not the yearning to write literary history all over again? The “modern,” wrote Henri Lefebvre, “is a prestigious word, a talisman, an open sesame, and it comes with a lifelong guarantee.”70 He might have said so of “literary” and “history” too. We all know about the West’s enchantment with Japan since Marco Polo called it “the land of gold” and Jonathan Swift a “flying island.” More contemporary voices would have us believe Japan is the first nation to make it to the finish line of history. My claims for Japan will be exceptionalist because they are not; The Rise and Fall of Modern Japanese Literature is my motion to forge the four words “modern, Japanese, literary, history” into something ordinary but compelling as the constellation moves forward in our own time to surprise us, all over again, with the yet unimagined novelty of modern Japanese literature after its rise, fall and now what is arriving to take its place.\n\n1 Bird-Chasing Omatsu\n\nIt is 1868, before the boy-emperor Mutsuhito’s new patrons have moved his throne from Kyoto but after rebel troops fighting in his name have occupied the shogun’s seat in Edo. The civil war will not be over until the middle of the following year, but the Tokugawa military’s tent administration (Bakufu), in and around Edo Castle since 1603, has already been renamed the Eastern Capital in anticipation of the emperor’s arrival. The local population is unsure whether to pronounce the new name “Tōkyō” or “Tōkei,” and they wouldn’t be entirely certain until the turn of the following century, but that is only one sign of the confusion that reigns in former Edo. Soldiers are encamped in the streets of what would later be called Ginza but with none of its department stores yet, just freak shows (misemono), street merchants, fortune tellers, town criers (yomiuri), and gambling parlors (tekkaba). There, a young woman, beautiful but of the untouchable caste (hinin), sings songs from door to door for small coins in a form of begging euphemistically known as “bird-chasing” (torioi), referring to the practice of dispersing harmful birds from fields with noise. Bird-chasing, along with so much street activity (such as hawking 27\n\n28 Chapter One\n\nnewspapers and cross-dressing in public), would be outlawed by the new government by the end of the first decade of the Meiji period. This young woman, Omatsu (a name with all the plebian airs of “Molly”), never earns much but her good looks attract admirers. A soldier, Hamada, falls in love only to be swindled out of two hundred silver coins by Omatsu, who is still seeing another lover, fellow untouchable Ōsaka Kichi. Next to fall victim is clothing store clerk Chūzō. Infatuated with Omatsu, he is cheated out of money— actually, his employer’s— by Omatsu in cahoots with her mother and Kichi. More intrigue follows when Omatsu and Kichi head west to Kichi’s hometown of Osaka, worried that the authorities are in pursuit. When a fellow criminal betrays them, Kichi is captured just outside Tokyo and imprisoned. But Omatsu escapes only to run into Chūzō, who, fearing his employer’s wrath, has fled Tokyo meaning to commit suicide. Omatsu sees her opportunity. She says she deserves to die as well, and that it must be fate that has brought them together for a double suicide (shinjū). But, Omatsu adds, what’s the hurry? You still have some money left, so why not live as husband and wife? At least for a few months, until the cash runs out? Chūzō pledges his love to Omatsu. Fleeing further west to skirt the civil war, Chūzō falls ill. Omatsu nurses him, but their money is pilfered and they have to depend upon the kindness of a merchant, Sadajirō. Sadajirō suggests to Omatsu that she could earn a good living if she came to work for him as a geisha. Omatsu sees another opportunity. Dumping the ailing Chūzō, she follows Sadajirō only to realize that she has sold herself into virtual sexual slavery. Sadajirō confesses that he had been trailing her and Chūzō, and that it was he who stole the last of their money. He is in fact the notorious criminal Sakuzō, and he means to keep Omatsu for himself. Resisting him, Omatsu tumbles into the sea and is lost beneath the waves. Until, that is, a passing steamer rescues her. Making her way to the home of Chūzō’s father, Omatsu pretends to be his legal daughter-in-law who therefore is entitled to financial support. Worried that Chūzō will show up and expose her charade, she feigns illness until she judges the coast clear, and only then tells Chūzō’s parents that, alas, their son is dead. Buddhist pieties pour out of her. Surely now, she says to the father, you can have no doubts my story is true. Chūzō’s family is convinced until Hamada storms into the house. He calls Omatsu a liar and declares her a dokufu (literally a “poison woman,” but more broadly, murderess) and tells the parents the real story in lieu of the false one they’ve heard from their pretend daughter-in-law. Soldiers arrive and take\n\nBird-Chasing Omatsu 29\n\nOmatsu away, not to prison but to Hamada’s own house, where, still smitten, he devotes himself to her despite her low birth. “We are all brothers,” he lectures her. Since they parted, Hamada has risen in the world, achieved all his worldly ambitions, and even wed the daughter of a powerful provincial lord. But his success is incomplete without Omatsu by his side. It may be wrong for a samurai to love a criminal, and an untouchable one at that, but love is shian no hoka— “blind.”1 Omatsu sees more opportunity. Yes, she says, I have always desired you, too. More than two years of bliss follow, with Omatsu more beautiful than ever and looking as if mushi mo korosazaru— she wouldn’t kill a flea.2 Karma intervenes again, however, and Kichi, after his release from jail, is hired as a servant by Hamada and so crosses paths with his former accomplice. I have always, Omatsu tells the resurfaced Kichi, desired you. They hatch a plot against Hamada’s legal wife, after whose departure the two lovers are free to lead a life of debauchery under Hamada’s roof. Eventually, complications from their plot against Hamada’s wife wrongly implicate Hamada himself. After he is hauled off to jail and commits suicide there, Omatsu and Kichi take his household valuables and head for Tokyo, where they hope to dwell undetected. But karma dictates otherwise. On their way east to the capital, they run into Sakuzō, who declares his intention to take Omatsu back from Kichi. When Kichi is killed in the ensuing struggle, Omatsu sees still more opportunity and goes to live with Sakuzō. She takes advantage of an unattended hunting rifle one day and tries to shoot him, but his angry pursuit of her is halted when a large bear eats him. The animal turns toward Omatsu. She runs and falls into a ravine, where an itinerant priest rescues her. Impressed by providence, she resolves to follow the Way of the Buddha and becomes the priest’s disciple. Convinced that her beauty has been the cause of her downfall, she deliberately disfigures herself with tongs drawn from a fire. For years she studies the holy sutras in a remote mountain village. But once a poison woman, always a poison woman. Longing for the big city, one night Omatsu sneaks into the priest’s quarters intending to pocket enough money to return to Tokyo. When the priest awakes she pretends to be there to satisfy her carnal desires with him. The offended priest orders Omatsu out of the village, whose people beat her savagely as she leaves. Penniless, and with a face whose deliberate scars are festering and swollen, Omatsu turns to petty crime, resulting in her arrest and punishment all over again. Resolved to find her mother, she is caught in a terrible blizzard while making her way to Tokyo. As luck would\n\n30 Chapter One\n\nhave it, she runs into a now healthy and prosperous Chūzō. He gives her a little money as an act of compassion, enough to return her to the city and her mother, and even to pay for some medicine, but to no avail: her condition worsens, and on 9 February 1878, she dies, “running wildly like a mad dog,” a fate in keeping with what is declared “the beastly nature of a beautiful woman” (bijo no jushin).3 This is a true story, though truth, its definitions, and antonyms are what I explore in this chapter. My reading will be less interested in Omatsu as a female criminal at the start of Japanese literary modernity than it will be in the negotiation of the actual versus the imaginary in early Meiji. The account I start with here is distilled from a wildly successful woodblock book printed by entrepreneur Ōkura Magobei in 1878 in his relatively new publishing operation, Kin’eidō, the same year that fountain pens and orchids as well as poison women were all the rage in Japan.4 The story might be absurd, but so is Henry Fielding’s picaresque Tom Jones. Technically the format was that of a gōkan: an illustrated, woodblock-printed kusazōshi (picture book) but bound in smaller format. Once denigrated by writer Tamenaga Shunsui (1790–1844) as playthings (gangu) for women and children,5 they served as a vehicle for popular fiction in the late Tokugawa period, often incorporating what we would consider “news.” First written in kana syllabary, later with Sino-Japanese graphs glossed phonetically for reading by women and children, gōkan were soon the most widespread of gesaku writing and in time built the mainstay readership of modern fiction. Their success was not without resistance, however: famed male writer Uchida Roan (1868–1929) commented in 1912 on how uncomfortable the sight of women reading still made him.6 The appearance of Torioi Omatsu kaijō shinwa (The New Maritime Tales of Bird-Chasing Omatsu) sparked a major revival of the genre, producing “the first best-seller made by a newspaper.”7 Shinwa was written in three volumes over approximately forty days by dramatist and gesaku writer Kubota Hikosaku (1846–98), who had been born into the family of a shogunal vassal (bakushin) only to slide down the social register after the Meiji Revolution. He worked various jobs: as a bureaucrat, assistant to kabuki dramatists, a hack journalist, a machiai (brothel) proprietor and finally, a tea ceremony devoteé and tutor.8 His Shinwa was overseen, however, by Kanagaki Robun (1829–94), a gesaku writer of humble origins who rose rather than fell in life, from being the son of a fishmonger to reach in time the upper echelon of the cultural establishment through ambition and hard work. Shinwa was illustrated by Yōshū Chikanobu and after it went on sale on 20 February 1878, sold an impressive eight thousand\n\nBird-Chasing Omatsu 31\n\ncopies.9 It was sold without proper binding just to keep up with demand.10 It cost a little over twelve sen, roughly the price of a good gyūnabe (beef bowl)— a relatively high price in part because of the expense of woodblock printing, which cost one yen per ten lines at the time.11 In the following years, dozens more gōkan attempted to replicate Shinwa’s success, and many did quite well, especially once the use of metal type after the early 1880s brought costs and prices down. Shinwa was noteworthy in other ways. It was based, more or less, on a series of fourteen newspaper installments. No article had ever been serialized at such great length. Two or three parts had been the rule. They ran from 10 December 1877, to 11 January 1878 under the working title Torioi Omatsu no den (The Account of Bird-Chasing Omatsu) and with only one anonymous illustration. Unlike the gōkan, the newspaper version was meant to be read rather than viewed,12 and for that reason it has been lauded as epochal (kakkiteki) in literary history.13 It was the first time a newspaper led readers to a novel, if we may use the term loosely. Close examination reveals that Shinwa is already unusual for a gōkan. Sino-Japanese characters are provided with phonetic glosses to ease reading, and the illustrations and the text do not always match up. It may seem odd that Omatsu’s exploits were reported as news, upstaging the 1877 Seinan War (also known as the Satsuma Rebellion), but that is what weekly news magazines still do. The history of Japan’s newspapers, per se, is not long, if we follow Albert Altman’s definition of the medium as a “periodical in publication, mechanical in reduplication, available to all readers willing to pay the price, miscellaneous in content, timely in material, and published by a going concern.”14 Preceded in the early seventeenth century by kawaraban (handbills that “effortlessly crossed the fluid borders of science, magic, astrology, folk belief, political/moral ideology, literature, poetry, and religion”15), its proper history begins with the modern arrival of foreigners in Japan, who had their own periodicals in their restricted settlements. The Nagasaki Shipping List and Advertiser commenced in 1861; and in his 1881 book, Young Japan, foreign journalist John Reddie Black tells the story of explaining to a storeowner in 1872 that he needed to stock newspapers every day; the proprietor did not realize the news constantly changed,16 though in hindsight we might say he had a point. Initially the press was an interest of the state and soon its arm. As early as 1857, Emperor Kōmei was listed as a subscriber to the Illustrated London News.17 The first Japanese-language newspaper was the Kanhan Batabia shinbun, a\n\n32 Chapter One\n\ntranslation of a Dutch paper published in Java and sponsored by the Bakufu six years before the revolution. The first paper to use metal type was the 1869 Yokohama mainichi shinbun, a project underwritten by the Kanagawa prefectural governor. The Tōkyō nichinichi shinbun had most of its print run purchased by the treasury (Ōkurashō),18 just as the Foreign Ministry subsidizes today’s Japan Times. But the newspapers did not lack for readers. When train service started in 1872, newspapers were there for sale in the stations. Passengers were soon reading them on board. By 1873, there was a boom in newspaper publishing when the government counted seventy-nine nationwide. Newspapers around the world were key in the development of national modernity, not only because they began to make transparent the heretofore invisible workings of government, but because “the temporal distance between reader and event is bridged by the technology of instantaneous dispersal of news— which makes possible a relatively small temporal gap between reader and event.”19 The development of a national postal system started in 1871, and newspapers enjoyed free delivery for a decade. Local libraries, which prohibited reading aloud along with smoking and conversation, were built and reading rooms (shinbun jūransho) were set aside for newspapers, even in the prisons for the rising numbers of inmates who could read. This and the rationalization of publishing costs helped the Japanese, already highly literate, constitute a national readership united by the distribution of news and magazines. Newspapers, along with the telegraph, railroads, and steamships, meant that the face-to-face communications of the Tokugawa period were rapidly replaced with media that spread and accelerated contact between individuals and groups. Newspapers soon replaced the Tokugawa period’s for-profit lending libraries (kashihon’ya) as the source of reading materials for the public. With the start of subscription home delivery in 1877, “the public acquired the habit of reading a fixed amount of printed material each day.”20 The proliferation of newspapers in early the Meiji period, coupled with the introduction of inexpensive one-yen enbon editions of books at the start of the Shōwa period (1926–89), was the signature event in the creation of a national readership for fiction in Japan. The audience for Kubota’s Torioi Omatsu no den and the later Shinwa may have constituted the first modern readership in Japan by virtue of its scale,21 and it is not so far-fetched to think Omatsu’s wide-ranging travels had something to do with the marketing of the newspaper outside Tokyo. That Shinwa appeared first in the newspapers and only later as a book points to how differently a story would be received as a collective news experience in lieu of a private literary\n\nBird-Chasing Omatsu 33\n\none. “As the book page yields the inside story of the author’s mental adventures,” noted Marshall McLuhan, “so the press page yields the inside story of the community in action and interaction.”22 Serialized reports, each approximately two columns in length and in time run for as long as six months, were an early form of media narrative dubbed tsuzukimono or tsuzukibanashi (continuing stories). They were defined by Nakamura Mitsuo as “writings in a documentary vein in a fictional form,” indicating a telling generic confusion,23 or what Michael McKeon, speaking of seventeenth-century England, called the “double epistemological charge” of news to be historically objective yet “demystified as a ‘romance’ convention in disguise.”24 Despite the fact that these tsuzukimono have to be regarded as news journalism (kiji) common at the time— the Omatsu no den installments were the same length as more unambiguous news items— these are held to be the precursors to the newspaper fiction (shinbun shōsetsu) securely in place by the end of the nineteenth century. Like Omatsu’s, the most popular were soon reissued as books that sold as genre hybrids (from our point of view) of news and entertainment. Shinwa, for example, retains the precise details of time, amounts of money, and people’s ages but is also replete with the sorts of punning and other wordplay associated with gesaku and not news. In 1885, an essay published in the Yomiuri shinbun by journalist Katō Hyōko under his penname Renga Kanjin already noted the debt that fiction owed to newspapers’ problematic precedent of publishing tsuzukimono in a medium dedicated to news: A newsman would be ashamed to publish tawdry or lewd tsuzukibanashi. He can only take what is interesting or meritorious from what his reporters [tanbōsha (poorly educated, underpaid menials)25] have managed to learn and, venturing into neither libel [hiki] nor obscenity, turn it into fiction or light frivolity, and hardly earn accolades from readers. As one person has said, these long stories resembling fiction are better published in reserved literary sections of the newspaper, than mixed with articles in the miscellany pages [zappō ran]. . . . But since our Yomiuri shinbun cannot print fiction as news, in the coming year we will create a separate section for it.26\n\nBut no sooner than 1886 the Yomiuri stopped publishing tsuzukimono and replaced them with the generically secure shinbun shōsetsu, making the transitional genre a brief one. Fiction in newspapers is first attributed to the roman-feuilleton found in the\n\n34 Chapter One\n\nParisian press in the first half of the nineteenth century. By the 1860s, it had reached the Anglo-Saxon world, where the press was largely regional rather than national as in France and Japan. In any case, the practice did not last long there. But it has continued to the present day in Japan. It is debated whether Shinwa should be called Japan’s first shinbun shōsetsu— Iwata Yasohachi no hanashi (The Story of Iwata Yasohachi, 1875) and Kinnosuke no hanashi (The Story of Kinnosuke, 1878) are also mentioned as possibilities. But Iwata was written in an oldfashioned, early-nineteenth-century style and serialized in only two parts, while one contemporary observer judged Kinnosuke to be “seventy percent fiction, thirty percent fact”27— so much fiction making needed, perhaps, to drive home the point that moral didacticism was still required. Literary history reflexively awards the title of first shinbun shōsetsu to the somewhat later Konjiki yasha (The Gold Demon, 1897–1902) by Ozaki Kōyō (1868–1903), even while opinion concedes that shinbun shōsetsu is the original “foundation of our national literature” (kokumin bungakuteki kiban).28 But histories of modern Japanese literature never begin the development of the modern novel in Japan here, in 1885, with the relegation of the fictional to its own newspaper pages. That landmark development has to wait until Futabatei Shimei’s Ukigumo two years later, when generalizations such as Edward Seidensticker’s that the “obsessively, gnawingly intellectual” “single theme” of modern Japanese literature is the “identification of modernism with individualism” might ring true.29 As Ozaki Hotsuki notes, the standard narrative of modern Japanese literary history starts with Shimei because there it locates the germination of the kindai jiga (modern self). But in doing so, that history is “chased into a dead-end alley” and rendered a history of “the superfluous man” (yokeisha).30 Mainstream literary history in Japan has only in recent decades looked at newspapers and their readership, but no subsequent single theme in Seidensticker’s estimation would have been possible without them. Tsuzukimono were long disparaged as reading fit only for “cats and foxes,” a euphemism for “geishas and prostitutes.”31 Literary historians might categorize Shinwa as Tokugawa-period, not modern, literature on the basis of a convoluted plot. But they overlook the interest of the state and media in just how the work circulated as fiction or not fiction. In part this may be the consequence of the fact that reports of unambiguous news— details of the Seinan War, for instance, and ominous developments on the Korean peninsula— had appeared in newspapers in serialized formats of similar size and design. An emphasis on war reportage may have retarded the development of newspaper fiction in Japan.32 In any case,\n\nBird-Chasing Omatsu 35\n\nmost literary historians take the appearance in the mid-1880s of experimental fiction penned by a new elite trained in Western languages and literatures as the origin of Japanese literary modernity. Impressed by the colloquial and mimetic nature of European fiction, the intelligentsia more or less adapted it for their own language and milieu. The tsuzukimono and the tales of murderesses they so often related led some to define the genre as synonymous with female criminality and were sometimes judged too journalistic to be serious literature. They tended to report names, dates, and locations precisely rather than veil them to avoid shogunal censure, as was the practice in earlier times. Alternatively, they were judged too plainly holdovers of late Tokugawa, premodern gesaku. While literary historian Honma Hisao, for example, praised Shinwa as somewhat better than other early Meiji accounts of dokufu, it too, like others, “was nothing more than the unique product of an amateurish [sarushibaiteki] and transitional time.”33 It was the much later literary historian, Kamei Hideo, who saw the tsuzukimono had a different topology and chronology than had Tokugawaperiod literature, replete with the accuracy of detail part of the disciplinary discursive regimes Japanese modernity would impose.34 Like newspapers in the West, they provided a metonym for what modern life was and aspired to be. The fact newspapers matter so little to us today registers not only the rise of digital media, but raises the question of whether we still live in modernity. Omatsu’s adventures, told not only in newspapers and books but on the stage, in popular ballads (kudoki), and woodblock prints, is where modern literary history arguably begins, counter the claims of scholars like Kitagawa Tetsuo that the Shinwa “is far from what modern literature would be.”35 Rinbara Sumio has argued that tsuzukimono debuted in the popular press (koshinbun; small newspapers) as “the first self-consciously literary works after the revolution that had as their background an awareness of the new age.”36 My Shinwa précis contains a few references to a rapidly changing, modernizing, early Meiji Japan, such as steamships and new medicines. There are more, specifically in the area of changing law, with references to the 1868 Charter Oath of Five Articles (Gokajō no goseimon) that acknowledged some rights for commoners. Drafted to quell potential opposition to the new government, the Charter Oath declared that “all absurd customs of olden times shall be abandoned,” including social and class prejudice,37 and its force then and in subsequent Japanese law has made it vaguely comparable to the English Magna Carta.38 Much is made in Shinwa of the legal emancipation of the untouchable caste in 1871, permitting someone like Omatsu to marry into the samurai class; to the reformed criminal code of\n\n36 Chapter One\n\n1868 that treats Kichi far more lightly in the age of bunmei kaika (civilization and enlightenment) by replacing the hot-water ordeals (kugadachi; yugishō) and judgments by fire (higishō) with more benign punishments; to the overnight success of entrepreneurs like Chūzō, free to practice an entrepreneurial capitalism discouraged under neo-Confucianism; and to the lowering of travel restrictions to allow the movement up and down the archipelago that Omatsu and company enjoyed. But despite the opportunities a modern, liberal Japan offers Omatsu, she avails herself of few. Time and again she reverts to her nature (sujō) as an untouchable member of her criminal caste. Here, as in the early English novel, questions of truth are aligned with questions of virtue or its lack. The didactic reversal of Omatsu’s evil (aku) is part of a broader dialectical reversal because the formalistic requirements of fiction contest the genre’s privilege to represent the world. “The novel has a definitional volatility,” according to Michael McKeon, “a tendency to dissolve into its antithesis, which encapsulates the dialectical nature of historical process itself at a critical moment in the emergence of the modern world.” A novel has to explain and solve problems at the same time, and while the story of Omatsu is certainly not the first work in Japanese literary history to do so, it is the first to do so amid a modern state’s anxiety over the attempt. Frankly, it fails in the attempt— no problems are really solved— in part because it is only awkwardly that “dynamic model of conflict”39 with an unstable and shifting border between the true and the false, that novels are held to be. Mimesis in fiction is historically a social relation, and in Shinwa it is facilitated through the instrumentality of textual features. Earlier gesaku made explicit reference to contemporary events, but just because those events are modern ones does not make the genre itself modern in the sense we might use that word. In Tsubouchi Shōyō’s 1885 Shōsetsu shinzui, traditionally taken as the manifesto for modern Japanese literature, the author makes an interesting parenthetical remark. He suggests that the written language of the kusazōshi, if properly reformed, could constitute the basis of a modern Japanese novelistic idiom. Shōyō notes, almost incidentally, that Japan’s easily legible koshinbun had in recent years begun serializing “miscellaneous reports” (zappō) called tsuzukimono that approach what a modern fiction style for Japan might be. He notes approvingly that the tsuzukimono used Tokyo diction to describe things that, though fanciful, also “deal with matters in, for the most part, a factual manner” and so qualify as realistic— Shōyō’s most desired goal. Theories that have sought to account for the emergence of modern Japanese fiction in\n\nBird-Chasing Omatsu 37\n\nthe mid-1880s posit a parallel binarism: one of continuity and change and the other native versus foreign, both borrowed from the larger discourse of Western Orientalism and Japanese historical-area studies. We are told, for example, that Japanese long before the modern era were writing novels, that the psychological insights of Murasaki Shikibu (973?–1014?) or the social consciousness of Ihara Saikaku (1642–93) had evolved, even teleologically, into prose genres cognate with those of early modern and modern Europe. The flip side of this argument is that modern Japanese literature traces its nature to an eager encounter with the West and its novels. Historical surveys of the makers of modern Japanese fiction are filled with anecdotes of youthful discoveries of Fielding, Turgenev, Balzac and von Hoffman, as native genius sought selfhood, realism and individuality. In this narrative, the cultural achievements of the West forcibly impose themselves on a culture more or less primed for such ideas. That this binary is devoid of any dialectical or materialist analysis belies the fact that an Orientalist essentialism insinuates itself into modern Japanese literary history, regardless of approach. At the same time, these arguments are not entirely wrong. One American scholar of modern Japanese literature declared that in the late Tokugawa and early Meiji periods, “virtually nothing happened to women who did not reside in the few square miles encompassed by the licensed quarter of Japan’s major cities.”40 Japanese scholarship has never been this myopic, but where it has attempted to accommodate Omatsu within an account of literary modernity, it has done so on the basis of her highly gendered, errant behavior.41 The early Meiji period is remarkable for its many celebrated female thieves and murderers in accounts collectively known as dokufumono, the poison women stories, whose origins ar"
