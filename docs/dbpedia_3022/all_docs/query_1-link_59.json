        "text": "An easy Japanese rice seasoning perfect for sprinkling over sushi rice, noodles, meats and salads. Add savoury umami flavour with our base Nori Komi Furikake recipe or amp it up with your favourite spices or seasonings to make your own custom blend.\n\nWhy We Love This\n\nRice will never be boring again with furikake in the house! It’s our favourite seasoning to go from plain white rice to a tasty meal in two seconds flat.\n\nWhether you sprinkle it straight over rice bowls, mix it through onigiri rice balls or sprinkle over homemade sushi, it’s literally sushi rice’s best friend.\n\nIt’s not just great for rice though. Use it as a seasoning for noodle dishes like udon or tantanmen ramen. Or sprinkle over grilled meats like chicken, steak, fish or tofu. Even simple steamed veggies or crispy fries get a delicious flavour boost from a sprinkling of furikake.\n\nFurikake is becoming more widely available in Asian groceries or supermarkets. However, store-bought furikake usually contains additives, preservatives and/or MSG. When you make homemade furikake, you know exactly what’s in it.\n\nRelated: Gomashio Sesame Salt / Toasted Sesame Seeds\n\nWhat is Nori Komi Furikake?\n\nFurikake (ふりかけ – pronounced “foo-ri-ka-keh”) means ‘sprinkle’ and is traditionally used a rice seasoning or “all purpose” seasoning in Japan. As popular as salt and pepper in the West, it’s savoury with a hint of sweetness, and is a great way to add crunch and a delicious umami flavour to your finished meal.\n\nThere are lots of varieties of furikake seasoning originating from different regions across Japan.\n\nNori komi furikake is a basic blend made from a base of crushed or sliced nori seaweed blended with sesame seeds, sugar and salt. It’s naturally vegan / vegetarian friendly, too!\n\nOther varieties of furikake can include extra seasonings such as bonito flakes, dried salmon, powdered fried egg, miso powder, or shiitake mushroom powder for extra flavour. Some will even have a zing of spice from chilli flakes or shichimi togarashi spice blend.\n\nWhat You’ll Need\n\nNori Seaweed – This is a type of dried and roasted seaweed common in Japanese cuisine, most notably as the seaweed layer on sushi. Look for it in the international isle of bigger supermarkets, your nearest Asian grocer or buy nori online. You can use regular sushi nori sheets or seasoned nori ‘chips’ (usually smaller pieces made for snacking) for extra flavour. Simply cut, slice, or crumble up with your fingers into small portions that mix well with the rest of the ingredients.\n\nSesame Seeds – We use an even mix of white and black sesame seeds for colour, texture and nutty savoury flavour.\n\nSalt – Regular table salt is fine, but feel free to use sea salt, Himalayan salt, black lava salt, smoked sea salt or any kind of flavoured salt that would work harmoniously with the rest of the ingredients.\n\nSugar – This adds sweetness and depth to the savoury notes in this seasoning. Feel free to omit if you prefer.\n\nWandercook’s Tips\n\nToast the Sesame Seeds – This adds an extra savoury nutty depth of flavour to the seasoning. Or try swapping the sesame seeds for toasted rice powder.\n\nFAQs\n\nVariations\n\nMake it Spicy – Add chilli flakes, wasabi powder or shichimi togarashi chilli powder.\n\nMake it Herby – Add dried shiso (perilla leaf) powder or kelp powder.\n\nMake it Earthy – Add dried shiitake mushroom powder or miso powder.\n\nMake it a Gift – Furikake is a tasty gift to spoil the foodies in your life!\n\nSprinkle homemade furikake over these amazing recipes!"
