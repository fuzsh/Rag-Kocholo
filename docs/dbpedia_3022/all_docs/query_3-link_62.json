        "text": "Our partners at Advanced Remarketing Services return a higher percentage than any other vehicle processing entity. On a monthly basis, between 84% and 87% of the gross revenue generated from vehicle sales comes to Habitat for Humanity.\n\nThe higher return helps make a more positive impact on communities across the country, which may be why Forbes has recognized Habitat for Humanity as one of the best charities to donate your car or other vehicle for two years in a row.\n\nFrom 2019-2023, your vehicle donations helped generate more than $72 million for affordable homes.\n\nAll the auctions and direct buyers used by Habitat are licensed, insured and bonded in the states where they operate. By signing the title directly to Advanced Remarketing Services, you are legally transferring ownership of your vehicle to Habitat for Humanity.\n\nWhen your title is received and your vehicle is picked up, you are no longer responsible for the vehicle.\n\nAbout half of our cars are sold to licensed dealers at wholesale auctions and are reused for transportation. The other half are typically transported to auto salvage yards where all reusable car parts, batteries, tires and fluids are removed. Vehicles that can be recycled are crushed, shredded and recycled into steel.\n\nHabitat receives funds for each donated vehicle, although a car sold at auction generally generates more revenue than one that is recycled. Every donation makes a difference and the families that partner with us are extremely grateful for your help.\n\nMany of the vehicles donated to Cars for Homes to raise funds to help build homes are sold directly to licensed auto recyclers. These recyclers are crucial environmental stewards and help to ensure end-of-life vehicles are processed safely and in environmentally friendly ways.\n\nRecycling cars keeps a huge amount of steel out of landfills. According to the National Material Company, more than 80 million tons of steel are recycled each year in North America. For every ton of steel recycled, 2,500 pounds of iron ore, 1,400 pounds of coal and 120 pounds of limestone are conserved.\n\nCars recycled properly can play a big role in reducing carbon emissions in the automotive manufacturing industry because recycling reduces the need to refine new materials. Recycling steel also saves the equivalent energy to power about 18 million households for a year.\n\nDonating your vehicle to Cars for Homes is a win for the community and the environment.\n\nHere are some basic things you should be prepared to know and provide for the donation:\n\nValid car title, free of liens\n\nYear, make and model\n\nVIN\n\nBody type\n\nMileage\n\nCondition\n\nDate the vehicle was last driven\n\nThis is not a complete list. For a full list of vehicle donation needs, please go to the donation wizard and start your donation."
