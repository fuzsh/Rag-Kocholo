Swipe up or down to open the White Balance tools, then select a setting from the menu.\n\nThere are two White Balance tools:\n\nTemperature: Make the colors in your photo cooler (more blue) or warmer (more orange).\n\nTint: Add a green or pink color tint to your image.\n\nWhen you’ve chosen a tool, swipe left or right to adjust the setting.\n\nThe example above shows how you can cool down or warm up colors using Temperature. Warming up the colors is perfect for enhancing your sunset photos.\n\nTemperature is also useful for correcting warm or cool color casts. In the photo below, the snow appears blue. To fix this, increase the Temperature to warm up the colors and make the snow appear white.\n\nThe next example shows how you can use the Tint setting to bring out the greens in a photo. This is great for boosting the colors in your photos of leaves.\n\nWhen you’ve finished using the White Balance tool, tap the checkmark to apply your edits.\n\n2.3 Details\n\nThe Details tool brings out the texture and fine detail in your iPhone photos. This tool works well on photos with an interesting texture, such as rust, wood grain, peeling paint, etc.\n\nIn the Snapseed Tools, tap Details. Swipe up or down, and select the setting you want to change.\n\nIn most cases, Structure produces better results. The Sharpening tool often reduces the quality of your image by introducing grain. If you do use Sharpening, use it in moderation.\n\nLike the other Snapseed tools, swipe across the screen to adjust the setting.\n\nWhen using the Details tool, zoom in to see your adjustment more clearly. To zoom in, place two fingers on the screen, then pinch outwards (drag your fingers apart). While zoomed in, check your adjustment hasn’t introduced quality issues such as grain.\n\nThe Details tool is fantastic for giving your texture photos the wow factor. But keep in mind that it won’t improve all of your pictures.\n\nFor example, you wouldn’t want to bring out the texture in a portrait photo. This would make the person’s skin look bad, and make them look a lot older!\n\n3. Modify Individual Edits\n\nBefore we explore more Snapseed editing tools, you’re going to discover an incredible feature of this app.\n\nSnapseed uses “non-destructive editing.” That means you can delete or modify any individual edit at any point in the future.\n\nAfter you’ve applied some edits to a photo, tap the Edit History icon (square with a curved arrow) at the top of the screen. Then tap View Edits in the menu.\n\nAt the bottom right you’ll see the edit stack. This contains all of the edits you made, with the latest edit at the top of the stack. Tap any edit in the stack to reveal three options.\n\nUse the Trash icon to delete that edit from your photo. Tap the Sliders icon to modify the edit. This opens up the editing tool where you can change the settings you originally applied.\n\nThe Brush icon opens up the masking options. Masking allows you to apply the edit to selected parts of the image. You’ll learn about masking and selective editing in section 6 of this tutorial.\n\nWhen you tap an edit in the stack, the edits above it are temporarily removed from your image. But you can bring these edits back by tapping them in the stack.\n\nWhen you’ve finished modifying edits, tap the back arrow at the top right to exit the Edit History screen.\n\n4. Improve Composition\n\nIn this section, you’ll learn how to improve the composition of your photos with Snapseed editing tools. The Crop, Rotate and Perspective tools help you turn an amateur snapshot into a high-quality professional image.\n\nOpen your photo in Snapseed, then tap Tools.\n\n4.1 Crop\n\nThe Crop tool lets you cut away the edges of your image. It’s like cutting off the edges of a printed photo with scissors.\n\nCropping removes distracting elements or empty space from the edges of the frame. It can also improve composition and emphasize the essential aspects of the photo.\n\nIn the Snapseed Tools, tap Crop. Select an aspect ratio, e.g. Original, Square, 4:3, etc. Or select Free if you prefer to crop without being restricted to particular dimensions.\n\nIn the example below, the Square aspect ratio is selected. A square crop removes the empty space at the bottom of the image, placing more emphasis on the child and birds.\n\nDrag the corner handles to adjust the crop position. Tap the checkmark to complete the edit.\n\nNow, cropping might sound simple. But learning which parts of the image to crop out, and which to keep, is more complex. To create the most striking compositions, you must learn the art of cropping.\n\nIn this video, you’ll master the hidden art of cropping your photos to create more eye-catching compositions.\n\nJoin my iPhone Editing Academy course and discover how to create beautiful masterpieces through editing.\n\n4.2 Rotate\n\nNothing screams unprofessional, amateur photography more than a horizon that isn’t straight.\n\nBut don’t worry if you didn’t hold your iPhone perfectly level when taking a photo. The Rotate tool in Snapseed makes it easy to straighten your image.\n\nIn the Snapseed Tools, tap Rotate. Snapseed analyzes your image and attempts to automatically rotate and straighten it.\n\nSometimes Snapseed doesn’t get the rotation right. Or it doesn’t automatically rotate your photo. To rotate your photo manually, drag your finger over the image. Use the gridlines to help you get the image straight.\n\nWhen you rotate a photo, the tilted edges get cropped. Check that you’re not going to lose any important elements from the edges of the frame. If you’re happy with the edit, tap the checkmark.\n\nThe Rotate tool is perfect for straightening horizons in your landscape photos. But you can use it to fix any photo where the important elements aren’t level.\n\n4.3 Perspective\n\nThe Perspective tool offers more ways to straighten elements and correct perspective problems.\n\nOne of the most common perspective problems occurs when you tilt your iPhone upwards. For example, if you shoot a tall building, the vertical lines don’t appear straight. Instead, they converge toward the top of the image.\n\nLearn how to use the Perspective tool in this video from my iPhone Editing Academy course. These techniques turn your ordinary images into incredible photos that you’ll be proud to share.\n\nJoin my iPhone Editing Academy course and become an expert at using apps to enhance your iPhone photos.\n\nIn the example below, I shot the door with the iPhone tilting slightly up. So the vertical lines don’t appear parallel.\n\nTo fix this, open the Snapseed Tools, and tap Perspective. Select the Tilt option beneath your image.\n\nTo correct the vertical perspective, drag down over your photo until the lines become parallel. To correct horizontal perspective, drag left or right. Tap the checkmark when you’re done.\n\nWhen adjusting perspective, be aware of the black areas that appear around the edges. Snapseed will automatically fill in these empty space. It uses pixels from the surrounding area to fill in the gaps.\n\nIf the edges of your image are fairly plain, such as sky, grass or sea, it usually does a good job of filling these gaps. But if the edges have a lot of detail, you may not get good results.\n\nSo when applying perspective correction, always check the edges of your image. If the results aren’t good, undo the edit and try again. Or crop the edges of your photo using the Crop tool.\n\n5. Clean Up Your Photos For Flawless Edits\n\nIn this section, you’ll discover two Snapseed photo editing tools for creating flawless images.\n\nThe Healing tool removes unwanted objects from your photos. And the Portrait tool is perfect for enhancing your portrait photos.\n\n5.1 Healing\n\nThe Healing tool in the Snapseed app lets you easily remove unwanted objects from your photos.\n\nIt’s perfect for removing small objects, spots, and blemishes. You’ll get the best results when the object you want to remove is surrounded by plain detail, such as skin, sky or sea.\n\nIn the Snapseed Tools, tap Healing. Pinch outwards with two fingers to zoom in on the object you want to remove.\n\nUse your finger to brush over the object. The area you brush over appears highlighted in red. When you release your finger, the highlighted object gets replaced with pixels from the surrounding area.\n\nIf the result isn’t perfect, tap Undo (curved back arrow) at the bottom of the screen. Then try brushing over the object again. Sometimes it can take a few attempts to get a great result.\n\n5.2 Portrait\n\nYou’ve seen how the Healing tool can remove blemishes in portrait photos. But you can take your portrait photo editing further in the Snapseed app.\n\nThe Portrait tool is an amazing tool for enhancing your portrait photography. Use it to brighten faces, create smoother skin, and make eyes sparkle.\n\nIn the Snapseed Tools, tap Portrait. Select a preset beneath your image, e.g. Spotlight 1, Smooth 1, etc. This is only a starting point for your edit, so don’t worry if your image doesn’t look perfect yet.\n\nNext, swipe up or down to access the Portrait tools: Face Spotlight, Skin Smoothing, and Eye Clarity.\n\nSelect the option you want to change, then drag left or right to adjust the setting. Here’s what each setting does:\n\nFace Spotlight: Brighten your subject’s face, while making their surroundings slightly darker.\n\nSkin Smoothing: Make your subject’s skin appear smooth and flawless.\n\nEye Clarity: Make your subject’s eyes sparkle.\n\nBe especially careful not to overdo the skin smoothing and eye clarity. You still want your subject to look natural after editing.\n\nIn this section, you’ll discover the hidden power of selective photo editing. Selective editing tools let you edit different parts of your photo separately.\n\nThe ability to edit your photos selectively is incredibly powerful. Mastering these tools will take your Snapseed editing to a whole new level.\n\n6.1 Brush\n\nThe Brush tool gives you ultimate control over selectively adjusting brightness and color. It’s perfect for photos where different parts of the scene need brightening or darkening.\n\nIn the example below, the original image (left) was edited using the Brush tool (right). The rocks were brightened, the clouds darkened, and the sunset colors made more vibrant.\n\nIn the Snapseed Tools, tap Brush.\n\nIf you don’t see the brush tools beneath your image, tap the Brush icon at the bottom of the screen. Select the Dodge & Burn brush to brighten or darken certain areas of your photo. Tap the up or down arrows to adjust the tool’s value.\n\nA minus value darkens the image, while a plus value brightens it. Use your finger to brush over the areas you want to adjust. In the example above, +5 was used to brighten the rocks in the foreground.\n\nIn the examples below, I used the Dodge & Burn brush at -5 to darken the clouds. Then I used the Saturation brush at +5 to make the orange colors slightly more vibrant.\n\nTo see which areas you’ve adjusted, tap the Eye icon. Any areas that you’ve brushed over appear highlighted in red.\n\nIf you made a mistake, you can erase your edits. Tap the up or down arrows until the value is set to Eraser. Then brush over the red areas to remove your edits. Switch off the Eye icon to hide the red highlight.\n\nThis video from my iPhone Editing Academy course shows you how to use the Brush tool to add dramatic clouds to your photos.\n\nJoin iPhone Editing Academy to discover how to make full use of Snapseed’s professional selective editing tools.\n\n6.2 Selective\n\nThe Selective Tool lets you edit different colors in your photo individually. After selecting a particular area of color, you can adjust its brightness, contrast, saturation or structure.\n\nThis tool is useful when you want to apply different types of adjustment to different colored areas.\n\nIn the Snapseed Tools, tap Selective. Tap on the area of color you want to adjust. This adds an adjustment point (small circle) to your image. In the example below, the adjustment point is on the orange roof tiles.\n\nPinch in or out with two fingers to adjust the scope of the selection. The areas that will be affected by your edits appear highlighted in red.\n\nNow, swipe up or down to access the four adjustment tools. From top to bottom, the letters stand for Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, and Structure. Select a tool, then drag left or right to adjust the setting.\n\nOnly the area of the color you that you selected will be affected by the edit.\n\nTo edit a different colored area, tap the + icon at the bottom of Snapseed. Then tap on the image to position your new adjustment point.\n\nPinch to change the size of the selected area. Swipe up or down to choose a tool. Then swipe left or right to adjust the setting.\n\nYou can add as many adjustment points to different colored areas as you like. Tap the Eye icon to view your image without the adjustment points. When you’re happy with your Snapseed edit, tap the checkmark.\n\n6.3 Masking\n\nMasking allows you to apply any Snapseed edit selectively.\n\nWith masking, you could apply saturation, brightness, or warmth to only certain areas of your photo.\n\nYou could bring out detail in a textured subject, while leaving the rest of the image untouched.\n\nOr you could turn a photo black and white, while keeping the main subject in color.\n\nSo how does masking work in the Snapseed photo editor? It’s actually very simple.\n\nFirst, you apply your adjustment to the entire image. Then you use the Mask tool to apply that edit selectively.\n\nIn the video below, you’ll learn how to use Snapseed’s Mask tool for ultimate control over selective editing.\n\nJoin my iPhone Editing Academy online course to discover how to harness the full power of the Snapseed photo editing app.\n\nIn the example below, you’ll discover how to use masking to create a black and white image with a pop of color.\n\nIn the Snapseed Tools, select Tune Image. Set the Saturation to -100, then tap the checkmark.\n\nDon’t worry that the entire image is black and white. You’ll now use the Mask tool to apply the effect selectively.\n\nTap the Edit History icon (square with a curved arrow) at the top of Snapseed. Select View Edits.\n\nIn the edit stack, tap Tune Image, then tap the Mask tool (brush icon).\n\nIn the masking window, ensure the Eye icon is switched on. This helps you see which areas you’ve selected by turning them red.\n\nBrush over the area that you want in black and white. In this case, we want everything to be black and white, except for the girl. Zoom in to ensure you make an accurate selection around the edges of your subject.\n\nIf you make a mistake, you can erase it. Tap the down arrow at the bottom of the screen to set the value to zero. The Mask tool then works as an eraser. Brush over the red highlight to remove it.\n\nWhen you’re done, tap the Eye icon to remove the red highlight. The areas you selected will appear black and white. Tap the checkmark to apply the edit. Then tap the back arrow to exit the Edit History screen.\n\nYou can use this technique to apply any edit or effect to selected parts of your photo.\n\n6.4 Vignette\n\nThe Vignette tool allows you to subtly darken or brighten the inner or outer parts of your image. It’s most commonly used to darken the outer edges of a photo.\n\nIf vignetting is overdone, it can ruin a photo. But when used carefully, a vignette helps to draw the viewer into the image and toward the main subject.\n\nIn the Snapseed Tools, tap Vignette.\n\nDrag the blue circle to the area you want to keep bright. You can change the size of the vignette area by pinching in or out with two fingers.\n\nSwipe up or down to open the vignette tools: Outer Brightness and Inner Brightness. These let you control the brightness of the areas inside and outside the vignette area.\n\nBy default, Outer Brightness is set to -50. A minus number darkens the image, while a plus number brightens it. To adjust brightness, swipe left or right. The brightness value appears at the top of the screen.\n\nIn the example above, the Inner Brightness is set to +30 to brighten the area around the child. The Outer Brightness is set to -50 to darken the edges of the image.\n\nThis combination draws the viewer’s eye to the more important, brighter part of the scene. It also darkens the sky, making it more dramatic.\n\n7. Change The Mood With Snapseed Filters\n\nSnapseed filters let you quickly change the look and feel of your photo. With a single tap, you can change the mood of your image or add an artistic touch.\n\nEach filter is fully customizable, making Snapseed one of the best filter apps for iPhone.\n\nLet’s take a look at the Vintage filters for this demonstration. These filters offer an easy way to create faded, vintage-style edits. In the Snapseed Tools, tap Vintage.\n\nTap on the different colored gradients beneath your image to try out the range of vintage filters. To customize the filter, swipe up or down, then select a tool from the menu. Swipe left or right to adjust the setting.\n\nTo add a subtle blur around the edge of your image, tap the Blur icon at the bottom of the screen.\n\nOther filter categories to try out include Black & White, Retrolux, Grunge, Noir, and Glamor Glow.\n\nThe Grunge filters are particularly unique as they add grungy textures to your image. You wouldn’t want to apply these filters to every image. But they’re worth experimenting with if you want to get creative.\n\nAll of the filters work in a similar way. Select the filter you want to use, then swipe up or down to access the customizable settings. Use the icons at the bottom of the screen to access more filter options.\n\n8. Use Looks As A Starting Point For Your Edits\n\nThe Looks section of Snapseed contains a collection of preset edits that you apply with a single tap.\n\nIf you’re not sure how to edit an image, trying out some different Looks is a good way to get started. You can then modify the Look to fine-tune the edit.\n\nYou can even create your own Looks based on edits that you’ve made. This is useful if you want to edit several photos using the same or similar effects.\n\n8.1 Apply A Look To Your Photo\n\nTap Looks at the bottom of the screen.\n\nTap on the different Looks beneath your photo to see how they alter the image.\n\nIf you’re happy with the edit, tap the checkmark. To cancel the edit, tap the X. Or customize the Look using the instructions below.\n\n8.2 Customize A Look\n\nTo customize a Look, first apply it to your photo and tap the checkmark.\n\nTap the Edit History icon (square with a curved arrow) at the top of the screen. Select View Edits.\n\nThe edits that make up this Look appear in the edit stack at the bottom of the screen. Tap any edit in the stack for more options.\n\nUse the Trash icon to delete the edit. Tap the Sliders icon to modify the edit. Or tap the Brush icon to apply the edit selectively using masking.\n\n8.3 Create Your Own Custom Looks\n\nDo you often find yourself editing multiple photos using very similar edits? If so, you can save time by creating your own unique Looks.\n\nCreating your own Looks is also a great way to come up with new ideas for editing your photos. You can quickly apply them to new images to see which edit looks best. This is an easy way to test out different edits that you might not have thought of otherwise.\n\nThis video from my iPhone Editing Academy course shows you how to create your own Looks to generate new editing ideas.\n\nJoin my iPhone Editing Academy course and discover fresh ideas for creating spectacular Snapseed edits.\n\nTo create your own Look, first edit your photo using any combination of Snapseed editing tools. When you’re done editing, tap Looks at the bottom of the screen.\n\nSwipe across to the far right of the Looks, then tap the Add Look (+) icon. Type a name for your Look, then tap OK.\n\nYour new custom Look appears in the Looks at the bottom of the screen. You can apply this Look to any photo that needs similar editing in the future.\n\n9. Save Your Snapseed Edit\n\nWhen you’ve finished editing your photo, you’ll need to save it. Saving your Snapseed edit ensures the image gets stored in your iPhone’s built-in Photos app.\n\nTap Export at the bottom of the screen. Snapseed has three saving options: Save, Save A Copy, and Export.\n\nSave overwrites your original photo with the edited version. You’ll no longer see the original unedited image in your Photos app. The photo saves with “non-destructive editing,” so your edits can be removed or modified at any time.\n\nSave A Copy saves your edit as a separate photo. You’ll have both the original and edited versions of the image in your Photos app. The image saves with “non-destructive editing,” so your edits can be removed or modified in the future.\n\nExport saves your edit as a separate photo with permanent changes. Your edits can’t be undone or changed after saving."
