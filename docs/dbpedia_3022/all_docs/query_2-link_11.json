We know some of the outstanding directors and actors, at least those who have become popular in the West. Many of us have marveled at the technical prowess of one or more anime. We, as children or with our children, have gaped at Godzilla and other monsters, thrilled to yakuza and swordplay films, and shivered through some of the J-Horror, and without our children, may even have succumbed to pink films and Roman Porno. If asked, many of us would put the Seven Samurai and Rashomon on any list of all-time best. But there is so much more that we are less familiar with, including the early pioneering works, documentaries, many of the period pieces, comedy and household dramas, films on feminism or minorities, and certainly the production of war films before and during the Pacific War. The studio names are familiar, but not their genesis (and sometimes disappearance). And we do not really know the producers and actors of popular Japanese fare that is rarely seen abroad. So this volume has the double advantage of telling us more about the things we are familiar with, but especially filling in the huge gaps regarding less known directors, actors, and other film personnel; studios; and more typically Japanese genres. This Historical Dictionary of Japanese Cinema goes about its work like others in the series. A good place to start in this case is with the chronology, which stretches further back than may be expected, indeed to the very earliest days of cinema per se, and continues on for well over a century full of important cinematic events, but is also embedded in the broader political world that is referenced in many films. The list of acronyms helps us in reading this and other texts. And the introduction provides the general context. But the bulk of the information comes in the dictionary section, with fairly extensive entries on leading directors and actors, major studios, some filmmaking techniques, assorted cinematic genres, significant historical periods, and several outstanding films. In this case, since Japanese is not a familiar language for nearly all foreigners, the glossary plays a special role in familiarizing us with the related terminology. In the appendixes, the lists of companies and awards, titles of films, and names of individuals give us the original Japanese for all of these. And the bibliography, an amazingly plentiful one, can direct us toward\n\nix\n\nx฀ •฀ EDITOR’S FOREWORD\n\nfurther reading on topics that interest us particularly and also some we hardly realized existed. As hinted above, it is hard to really know Japanese cinema without putting in a lot of effort, much more than most of us can manage, and also without knowing the Japanese language. Over the past decade or so, few have dug deeper than Jasper Sharp, who is a frequent visitor to Japan, having lived there for three years, and otherwise follows events closely from Great Britain, where he lives. During this time, he has written (with Tom Mes) The Midnight Eye Guide to New Japanese Film and more recently Behind the Pink Curtain. He has also contributed to several anthologies and journals, curated film programs and retrospectives, and served on the advisory board of the Journal of Japanese & Korean Cinema. Most important in many ways, along with Tom Mes, he cofounded and helps keep the Midnight Eye website brimming over with information. This historical dictionary is his biggest recent project and certainly a significant contribution to increasing our knowledge of what is, after all, the world’s third biggest film industry, one that everyone should know more about, from the average cinemagoer to those who are fascinated by one facet or another. Jon Woronoff\n\nPreface\n\nThis book is aimed at researchers, students, teachers, and general readers as both an introduction to and overview of the long history of Japanese cinema. It aims to provide an entry point for those with little or no familiarity with the subject, while it is organized so that scholars in the field will also be able to use it to find specific information. For this reason, the introduction and the chronological timeline sections are quite detailed. In themselves, they should provide sufficient background to the length and breadth of Japanese cinema, pointing to specific information that can be found in more detail in the dictionary entries. A single volume focusing on Japanese cinema can never hope to be exhaustive, owing to the long history and sheer scale of production the industry has enjoyed since the arrival of the medium. Japan not only possesses the oldest unbroken film history of a non-Western nation, but also one of the largest; in Asia it is outproduced only by India. As such, a degree of selectivity has been applied to what has been included in the entries section. The choices are weighted in favor of those names and films best known internationally, or that characterize and shed more light on specific eras or genres, while the bibliography aims to provide a thorough review of the research that has already been undertaken on this vast subject and suggest possible fruitful paths still to be followed. No book would ever be possible without the support and patience of a whole host of people. Space constraints preclude me from listing every single one of my friends and family members who have assisted, encouraged, or simply put up with me over the years I’ve been working on this project, and I ask in advance for the forgiveness of those whose names I have neglected to mention here. My utmost love and gratitude of course goes to Michelle Thomas, who, while I have been laboring over these pages, has been preparing for me the greatest gift that anyone could ever give. It also goes without saying that none of this would have been possible without my parents, Ian and Erica Sharp, and I also say thanks to my brother Daniel, my cousin Bridget Simmons, and her partner, Ken Slow, for providing me with a space to sit and write for the brief period during this project when I had no other place to do so.\n\nxi\n\nxii฀ •฀ PREFACE\n\nI would like to thank Richard Chatten and Alexander Jacoby for their early comments on the manuscript. To Alex, I wish to give a double thank-you in conjunction with all the other researchers, journalists, and curators active in the field of Japanese cinema whose work has informed these pages. Specifically, I would like to thank my partners at Midnight Eye; Tom Mes, without whose chance meeting in Holland so many years ago I might never have taken this obsession so far; Martin Mes, for laboring so diligently behind the scenes; as well as Nicholas Rucka, Jason Gray, Roger Macy, Michael Arnold, Dean Bowman, Cathy Munroe Hotes, Eija Niskanen, Don Brown, and all the many others who have contributed over the years. For their friendship and continuing assistance, as much as for their activities in Japanese cinema, I’d like to pay credit to Adam Torel, Alex Zahlten, Roland Domenig, Mark Schilling, Jim O’ Rourke, David Desser, Karen Severns, Koichi Mori, Chris Magee, Junko Takekawa, Lucia Nagib, Jonathan Rayner, Aaron Gerow, and Mark Nornes; the latter two in particular for providing an invaluable forum for discussion and debate about the subject in the form of the KineJapan mailing list. The greatest of them all, to whom my most heartfelt thanks goes, is Donald Richie, the man who started it all. Anyone who has published on Japanese cinema before will know about the problems associated with sourcing images. For this reason, I am particularly indebted to a number of people in the industry who have supplied me with the stills used in this book and have granted permission to use them without charge. With regards to this, I’d like to say an especially big thank-you to the Kawakita Memorial Film Institute, in particular Wachi Yukiko, whose assistance has gone far beyond the call of duty; Ando Momoko of Zero Films; Marie Iida and Kito Yukie of Entertainment Farm; Ono Seiko of Zakka Films; Watanabe Saki of 100 Meter Films; Yamashita Koyo of Image Forum; and Yasui Yoshio of the Planet Bibliotheque de Cinema in Osaka. And finally, I would like to thank Jon Woronoff at Scarecrow Press for suggesting this project and for his enduring advice and patience while I worked on it. As a footnote, it would be a grave oversight to neglect mention of the tragedy that has befallen Japan with the devastating Tôhoku Earthquake and Tsunami, which occurred on 11 March 2011 after the manuscript for this book was already submitted. The longer legacy of the disaster upon the nation’s psyche, economy, and film industry has yet to be felt, but my heart goes out to all those affected by it.\n\nReader’s Note\n\nThis book follows the same format as the other volumes in the Historical Dictionary series. In each dictionary entry, references to other entries are indicated in boldface type or at the end of the entry under See also OTHER ENTRY. Spelling is American English, except for rare cases of official names and titles for which the Japanese have explicitly used other forms, such as the organization Art Theatre Guild. As the subject matter of this book not only presents the reader with a foreign language, but also a foreign writing system, some further explanation is necessary about how Japanese words are transcribed into the Roman alphabet. Transliteration of Japanese words follows the revised Hepburn romanization system, with the use of macrons to denote a long vowel sound (e.g., ô as in “boat” as opposed to o as in “hot”). To prevent confusion, I have used the international spellings for all place-names (e.g., Tokyo and Kyoto as opposed to Tôkyô and Kyôto). The terms “West” or “Western,” although contentious, are used to refer collectively to America and Europe. Similarly, for film companies known outside of Japan, I have opted for the nonmacronized spelling (e.g., Toei rather than Tôei; Toho rather than Tôhô), but have used macrons for the majority of companies whose names are seldom written in English, such as Fukuhôdô, Shinkô Kinema, and Sôzôsha. Some companies that do not have individual entries in the dictionary are included in appendix A, along with their names as written in Japanese script. Companies, government agencies, institutions, or organizations referred to in the entries either by English names or abbreviations, followed by the Japanese-language version italicized in brackets, can also be found in this section. With regard to the names of individual people, I have adhered to the Japanese practice of the family name first followed by the given name, a convention best explained by the example of the brothers Ishihara Shintarô and Ishihara Yujirô. Where individuals mentioned in the text do not have their own dictionary entries, they are listed with the Japanese characters of their names in the relevant section of appendix C (i.e., under “Directors,” “Performers,” or “Other Figures”). Transliteration of names follows the revised Hepburn system used elsewhere, except in the rare cases where the\n\nxiii\n\nxiv฀ •฀ READER’S NOTE\n\nindividual is commonly known under an alternative spelling. For example, Edogawa Rampo should strictly be Edogawa Ranpo, and the manga artist Matsumoto Leiji should be Matsumoto Reiji, although published foreign translations of both these individuals’ work almost exclusively use the former spellings. However, the alter ego of Kitano Takeshi is referred to in the text by the anglicized spelling Beat Takeshi (as opposed to Bîto Takeshi), as the name is borrowed from the English language and the actor–director is also well-known overseas under this screen name. Those individuals who have worked extensively overseas under English names, such as Henry Kotani, Thomas Kurihara, and Shirley Yamaguchi, are listed in the relevant appendixes in accordance with the Japanese name order: as Kotani Henry, Kurihara Thomas, and Yamaguchi Shirley. However, in the case of those individuals who have worked almost entirely within the Japanese industry but have opted to use anglicized names, for example the actor Shishido Jô (Joe Shishido) and the director Iida Jôji (George Iida), the Japanese names are given in the main text with their English variants listed as alternatives in the appendixes. Japanese words such as anime, chanbara, manga, or yakuza that may be unfamiliar to the general reader appear italicized throughout text, unless they are in common usage in the English language or their meaning is commonly understood, such as in the cases of the words Kabuki or Samurai (note also that the words Butoh and Noh are spelled in the commonly used English form instead of in the macronized forms). Italicized Japanese terms, if they do not have their own dictionary entry, appear in the glossary, where the Japanese characters with which they are written are given alongside the definition. Names of film journals or books that occur in the main text are listed under “Selected Japanese Sources” in the bibliography. Individual films are referred to within the text by their English titles, with the transliterated Japanese titles in brackets followed by the director and the year—for example, Life of Oharu (Saikaku ichidai onna, Mizoguchi Kenji, 1952)—unless the information is included elsewhere in the entry. A full list of all films mentioned in the text is provided in appendix B, along with the original title in Japanese characters or kana. For the English-language titles I have drawn heavily from Alexander Jacoby’s A Critical Handbook of Japanese Film Directors: From the Silent Era to the Present Day (2008), which has attempted to redress the problem of the rapidly proliferating number of English titles for the same works by listing the most commonly used or official overseas release titles for the film in question. I have referred to other sources for those films not included in Jacoby’s book, where necessary using my own translations from the Japanese. It should be emphasized that many films produced in Japan have never been released overseas, and a number of those\n\nREADER’S NOTE฀ •฀ xv\n\nthat have, have been subjected to retitling by theatrical or video distributors. In such cases, alternative titles are given at the end of each entry in the list. For anonymously directed works, a particular problem in Japanese cinema’s early years, when directors were typically uncredited, the director’s name is specifically given as unknown, as for example in the case of Ghost Cat of Saga (Saga no bakeneko, unknown, 1916). Where multiple directors are credited, their names are separated by forward slashes; for example, Victory Song (Hisshôka, Mizoguchi Kenji/Tasaka Tomotaka/Shimizu Hiroshi/ Makino Masahiro, 1945). For original Japanese titles and release years, I have drawn heavily from the invaluable online resource, the Japanese Movie Database (JMDB), compiled from the records of the journal Kinema Junpô. Inevitably, there are going to be mistakes in any such source of information, and where I have detected them, I have corrected them. It is also worth mentioning that the JMDB has been infrequently updated since 2004.\n\nAcronyms and Abbreviations\n\nATG AV Bide-rin\n\nArt Theatre Guild Adult Video Nihon Ethics of Video Association (Nihon Bideo Rinri Kyôkai, also NEVA) CERO Computer Entertainment Rating Organization (Tokutei hieiri katsudô hôjin konpyûta entâteinmento rêtingu kikô) CG Computer Graphics CM Commercial Movie (i.e., advertisement film) Eiren Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan (Nihon Eiga Seisakusha Renmei, also MPPAJ) Eirin Commission for the Administration of the Motion Picture Code of Ethics (Eirin Kanri Iinkai) FIPRESCI International Federation of Film Critics (Fédération Internationale de la Presse Cinématographique) JHV Japan Home Video JMDB Japanese Movie Database Kokkatsu International Motion Picture Company (Kokusai Katsuei Kabushikigaisha) MPPAJ Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan (also EIREN).

Throughout this era Japan is governed by the Tokugawa shogunate, officially established by Tokugawa Ieyasu, as an isolated, preindustrial country comprised of over 250 decentralized domains ruled by feudal lords known as daimyô. 1688 The Genroku period begins, a span of several years lasting until 1704, which marks the zenith of the Edo period in terms of economic stability, culture, and internal politics. 1853 The arrival of American Commodore Mathew Perry with his four “black ships” (kurofune) at Uraga Harbor, part of present-day Yokosuka, forces Japan to open up to the outside world after almost three centuries of self-imposed isolation and presages the restoration of the emperor system that begins the Meiji period. 1868 The Meiji period (1868), or Meiji Restoration, begins following the accession of Crown Prince Mutsuhito as the Emperor Meiji to the throne on 3 February 1867 at the age of 14. The period is marked by rapid industrialization in an attempt to make Japan a powerful nation-state in the same mold as those in Europe and America. The era lasts until 1912. 1894 1 august: Declaration of First Sino–Japanese War. The war is fought in Korea and Manchuria and ends with the defeat of Qing dynasty China, with the Treaty of Shimonoseki signed on 17 April 1895. Manchuria, Taiwan, the Pescadores Islands, and the Liaodong Peninsula are ceded to Japan “in perpetuity,” while Korea becomes autonomous from China and a protectorate of Japan, until it is annexed in 1910.\n\nxix\n\nxx฀ •฀ CHRONOLOGY\n\n1895 28 December: In Paris, the Lumière brothers Auguste Marie Louis Nicolas and Louis Jean hold their first public screening of motion pictures filmed and projected to a paying audience, using their invention, the Cinématographe, at the Salon Indien du Grand Café. The date is generally considered as marking the birth of cinema. 1896 17 november: Crown Prince Yoshihito, later the Emperor Taishô, peers into Thomas Edison’s hand-cranked Kinetoscope peep-show device on the first day of private showings, organized by its importer Takahashi Shinji. 25 november: The Kinetoscope is introduced to the general public at Kobe’s Shinkô Club, marking the first time recorded moving pictures are seen by a paying audience in Japan. 1897 9 January: Lumière representative François-Constant Girel arrives in Japan. He shoots a number of short films for his employers before leaving the country. 15 february: The first exhibition of projected pictures for a paying audience is held at the Nanchi Embujô theater in Osaka, organized by the Japanese Lumière representative, Inahata Katsutarô, and marking what is regarded as the beginning of cinema in Japan. 6 March: Arai Saburô holds the first public exhibition of motion pictures in Tokyo at the Kinki-kan theater in Kanda district using one of Thomas Edison’s Vitascope projection devices, setting off an immediate rivalry between the two machines, which looks set to be won, when two days later, on 8 March, Yokota Einosuke gives an exhibition at Tokyo’s Kawakami-za theater using a Lumière Cinématographe acquired from Inahata and then, on 9 March 1897, Kawaura Kenichi of the Yoshizawa Company holds his first Cinématographe show at the Minato-za theater in Yokohama. 1899 Shibata Tsunekichi films Maple Viewing (Momijigari), a recording of a segment of the Kabuki play of the same name starring Ichikawa Danjurô and Onoe Kikugorô, and makes Japan’s first dramatic film, Armed Robber: Shimizu Sadakichi (Pisutoru gôtô Shimizu Sadakichi), featuring Yokohama Unpei as the real-life criminal whose actions are portrayed. 1900 March: The first domestically made projectors are sold by the Yoshizawa Company. 1902\n\nThe Yoshizawa Company opens a London office.\n\n1903 June: Yokota Einosuke and his elder brother Masunosuke establish Japan’s second motion pictures company, the Yokota Brothers Company (Yo-\n\nCHRONOLOGY฀ •฀ xxi\n\nkota Kyôdai Shôkai), later renamed the Yokota Company (Yokota Shôkai). 1 october: The first purpose-built cinema in Japan, the Denki-kan in Tokyo’s Asakusa district, is established by the Yoshizawa Company. 1904 10 february: The Russo–Japanese War begins over the control of Manchuria in China. Russia’s defeat on 5 September 1905 is seen as a major turning point in Japan’s history, the first instance of a non-Western country achieving victory over an established world power. The war provides much of the subject matter for the country’s filmmakers, with camera units dispatched by both the Yoshizawa and Yokota companies.

As well as representing the world’s second largest exhibition market, the country boasts the longest unbroken history of production outside the United States and Europe. The earliest films shot in Japan by resident cameraman Shibata Tsunekichi were produced as early as 1898, within a few years of the first public exhibition of projected motion pictures by the Lumière brothers in Paris, which is held to mark the birth of the medium. Japan’s cinema predates that of Russia, China, and India, and has been able to sustain itself without outside assistance for over a century, unlike the industries of, for example, Australia, Great Britain, and many other European nations, which are largely reliant on outside finance and international coproduction deals. As such, the country’s cinematic output can serve to reorient our understanding of the modern era, presenting a detailed chronicle of the historical and social trends of the twentieth century through an alternate, nonWestern perspective to the dominant voice of Hollywood.\n\nTHE STATE OF THE INDUSTRY In terms of the number of releases, Japan retains one of the largest industries in the world. In 2008, 418 domestically produced films were distributed in Japanese cinemas, as opposed to 388 foreign productions, according to statistics published by the Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan (Nihon eiga seisakusha renmei, or Eiren). This might be down from its peak of over 547 domestic films released in 1960 (with only 216 imported), but nevertheless, there are very few countries outside of America that can sustain such levels of output or enjoy a majority audience for their own products. As a geographically isolated and, on the surface at least, predominantly homogeneous society with a population of 127 million, this is in no small measure attributable to factors of language and culture: foreign releases have traditionally been subtitled rather than dubbed, and many of its performers, stories, and characters are already familiar through a host of other media such as\n\n1\n\n2฀ •฀ INTRODUCTION\n\nmanga, novels, television, video games, and popular music, as well as being drawn from the country’s own rich history and mythology. In 2008, Japanese productions represented 59.5 percent of gross domestic box-office receipts. Although this figure is considerably less than the market share of around the 70 percent mark during the Golden Age of the 1950s (referred to generally as the Second Golden Age, following the first blossoming of Japanese film as an art form in the prewar environment of the 1930s), with a peak of 78.3 percent in 1960, the past decade marks a distinct turnaround from a period of steady decline since the 1970s, when in 1975 foreign imports outgrossed domestic productions for the first time ever, with Japanese films taking only 44.4 percent of overall box office. In terms of revenues, Japanese cinema was seen to be in an irrevocable slump at the turn of the millennium, with the industry’s box office share for the 293 released domestic productions (as opposed to 347 imported films) reaching an all-time low of 27.1 percent in 2002 (a year in which the five top-grossing titles were the Hollywood studio productions Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets; Star Wars: Episode II—Attack of the Clones; Monsters, Inc.; The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring; and Spider-Man). Its resurgence over the past decade might be seen as miraculous, although it must come with some caveats. Although the period saw an overall strengthening of the domestic performance of Japanese productions, the figures are generally weighted by a few select titles, with the majority of releases nowhere near as profitable. The animated films of Miyazaki Hayao have regularly dominated the box office in the years of their releases, and it is worth noting that it was Studio Ghibli’s The Cat Returns (Neko no ongaeshi), though not directed by Miyazaki, that was the top-grossing domestic release of 2002, an otherwise inauspicious year for the Japanese industry. While the decade saw the country’s most consistently popular filmmaker heralded internationally for the first time, with Spirited Away (Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi) winning the Golden Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival and Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards, many of the most successful domestic titles, such as Bayside Shakedown 2 (Odoru daisôsasen The Movie 2, Motohiro Katsuyuki, 2003), Crying Out Love, in the Center of the World (Sekai no chûshin de, ai o sakebu, Yukisada Isao, 2004), and Boys over Flowers: Final (Hana yori dango: Fainaru, Ishii Yasuharu, 2008), were theatrical spin-offs of popular television dramas. Despite recapturing a younger demographic believed lost to Hollywood, such films have attracted considerably less interest in nonAsian markets. The 2000s were the decade that saw television tie-ins reign at the Japanese box office, with the distributor Toho capturing a massive 38 percent of the domestic market for itself by 2008 through such films, distributing all the\n\nINTRODUCTION฀ •฀ 3\n\naforementioned titles as well as theatrical animations for the children’s market featuring popular anime characters like Pokémon and Detective Conan (Meitantai Conan), similarly established in alternate media fields such as video games and manga. As Japan’s largest exhibitor, Toho has also distributed many of the country’s most profitable imported titles, including Avatar (James Cameron, U.S., 2009). There is a general concern, however, that this current situation is not particularly healthy for the industry at large, with smaller or midsized studios and distributors struggling to compete against this near monopoly of the market. Furthermore, though the number of screens in the country grew from 2,524 in 2000 to 3,396 in 2009, the boom in domestic production, particularly in the latter half of the decade, saw many films sitting on the shelves for long periods awaiting distribution. This has resulted in a considerably harsher environment in which to produce more challenging works or to foster a new wave of more artistically ambitious and outwardlooking directors. Taken as a whole, the Japanese film industry has never been reliant on overseas sales; one might argue that the push to promote Japanese cinema at overseas festivals by major studios such as Daiei during the 1950s, which saw the introduction of filmmakers such as Kurosawa Akira and Mizoguchi Kenji to the West, was motivated more by cultural than financial reasons, although the kudos of international recognition for their films would have given the individual studios a competitive edge against their rivals in the domestic market. Still, it seems ironic, given the emphasis placed by the country’s politicians in recent years on promoting its contents industry overseas—with the fields of computer games, manga, and anime all seen as vital contributors not only to Japan’s economy, but to its cultural standing in the world—that its cinema should be becoming, if anything, more insular in its outlook. Cinema is an international medium, with its practitioners participating in a global discourse. The industry’s reliance on commercially safe adaptations, remakes, or tie-ins with other homegrown media has perhaps more serious ramifications in its simple failure to resonate with non-Japanese viewers. It effectively acts as a bar to Japan’s filmmakers contributing to this discourse. There have, however, been a number of more positive trends during the past decade. Anime has had an undeniable influence on the aesthetics and content of numerous Hollywood films in the science fiction and action genres, from The Matrix (Larry Wachowski and Andy Wachowski, 1999) to Avatar (James Cameron, 2009), while Asian horror films, particularly Japanese ones, have been subjected to a series of prominent American remakes and have similarly had a significant bearing on the path of the genre as a whole. The international impact of Ring (Ringu, 1998) and Ju-on: The Grudge (Juon, 2003) resulted in the films’ directors, Nakata Hideo and Shimizu Takashi,\n\n4฀ •฀ INTRODUCTION\n\nbeing successfully courted by Hollywood, becoming the first ever Japanese filmmakers to direct within the U.S. studio system, if one discounts Masuda Toshio and Fukasaku Kinji’s contribution to Twentieth Century-Fox’s war epic Tora! Tora! Tora! (Richard Fleischer, 1970). However, neither Nakata nor Shimizu can be described as having been afforded much in the way of artistic control or choice of material in their American reworkings of their originals films, nor have they expanded their international reputations beyond their niche status as Japanese horror directors. Their effective domestication by Hollywood sits in contrast to other non-American filmmakers of the same generation, such as Mexico’s Alfonso Cuarón and Alejandro González Iñárritu or Brazil’s Fernando Meirelles. This sense of Japanese cinema’s insularity is compounded by the fact that, unlike the majority of national industries, foreign coproductions are a rarity, although recently there have been a number of works by Japanese directors partially financed by other countries, notably the cult titles Machine Girl (Kataude mashin gâru, Iguchi Noboru, 2008) and Tokyo Gore Police (Tôkyô zankoku keisatsu, Nishimura Yoshihiro, 2008), both produced in association with the American distributor Media Blasters. It should be stressed that these are exceptions to the general rule, and furthermore, they are very much geared toward the expectations of Western horror audiences. Meanwhile, major international film festivals such as Berlin, Rotterdam, Venice, and Cannes have continued to play a role in ensuring Japanese cinema’s overseas visibility, with directors including Kawase Naomi, Kitano Takeshi, Kore’eda Hirokazu, Kurosawa Kiyoshi, and Sono Shion enjoying a good degree of critical recognition and exposure to international markets. The works of such auteurist directors are not always so commercially successful domestically, and it is interesting to note that several of Kawase’s films have been financed by European companies, whereas Kurosawa’s most critically regarded title, Tokyo Sonata (Tôkyô sonata, 2008), based on an original script by an Australian, Max Mannix, received funding from Hong Kong and the Netherlands. Such international coproduction arrangements present a possible avenue for Japanese filmmakers to maintain their reputation for reflectiveness, innovation, and social engagement, with works that are just as relevant to global audiences as local ones. Another positive trend has been a flourishing in jishu eiga, or amateur filmmaking, brought about through the increased availability of digital technologies. The proliferation of specialist venues, events, and festivals to showcase such works, both inside and outside of Japan, has resulted in a minor revolution, with its filmmakers defining their own space to create films that in many cases could not exist within the mainstream sector. Motivated by the desire to communicate and a love of the filmmaking process rather than\n\nINTRODUCTION฀ •฀ 5\n\nfinancial gain, it is questionable whether many of its practitioners, reliant on other forms of employment for their income, can maintain the enthusiasm to develop their talents in a more commercial context. Nevertheless, since the late 1970s the field has provided a wellspring of new talent who have gone on to make their living in filmmaking, including a significant number of women directors. Given the inevitable changes in production, distribution, and exhibition patterns brought about by Internet technologies that are certain to have a profound effect on all industries across the world, the jishu eiga community will no doubt play a vital role in the future of Japanese cinema and appreciation of it overseas.\n\nNATIONAL CINEMA AND INDIGENOUS GENRES When attempting to study such industries as Japan’s through the framework of “national cinema,” it is crucial to be aware of the complexities inherent in the term. From its very beginnings, cinema has been a global medium whose resulting output is shaped by such factors as international cross-flows of labor and capital and the influence of individual texts upon one another. Cinema’s very technology originated outside of Japan, and from the moment of its adoption, a great many of the films that circulated were from countries such as France, Germany, and Italy, and of particular importance after 1916, the United States, which came to dominate the market for foreign films following the disruption of the European industry that came with World War I. The word yôga came into use to distinguish this cinema from overseas, which gave Japanese viewers their first glimpses of modern Western life, from the comparative term hôga, used to describe Japanese productions. The terms are still in common usage today, even though over the past century or so, foreign and domestic productions can hardly be described as having existed in separate, mutually exclusive spheres. Cinema’s arrival in the country coincided with a rapid, concerted push for industrialization and modernization, encouraged by the Meiji-era government following the restoration of the emperor and Japan’s opening up to the rest of the world in 1868. The Meiji Restoration marked the end to the self-imposed isolation of the Edo Period and Japan’s birth as a modern nation eager to compete on an equal footing on the world stage. To this aim, it adopted the judicial, political, and educational systems of various European countries, as well as its technologies, with the slogan Wakon yôsai (“Japanese Spirit, Western technology”) the rallying cry of the era. As one such technology, cinema served the dual purposes of bringing the outside world to Japan and allowing the country to redefine itself as a modern\n\n6฀ •฀ INTRODUCTION\n\nnation-state through image and narrative. Still, this international currency of ideas seems to have been very much a one-way process. There are records of the Yoshizawa Company opening a London office as early as 1902, with the company’s president, Kawaura Kenichi, traveling to America to exhibit footage of the Russo–Japanese War and scenes of everyday Japanese life at the St. Louis International Exposition of 1904. However, although little research has been done in the English language about the reception these early images of Japan had in the West, it seems they made little lasting impression, and as is clear from this volume’s bibliography, knowledge outside of Japan about the state of Japanese cinema was severely limited until the 1950s. Due to its cultural, geographical, and linguistic isolation relative to industries with a comparative history and scale of output, Japanese cinema has been viewed as offering an “exotic” alternative to the aesthetic, stylistic, and narrative norms established by Hollywood, its films seen instead as deriving from nativist cultural traditions. Such an essentialist approach is dangerous on several counts. To the foreign observer it can overemphasize differences over similarities and risks reinforcing views of Western cultural dominance by viewing Japan solely in terms of an alien “other,” and indeed it has served exactly this purpose in the past. Conversely, Japanese cultural critics have contributed to the discourses on Nihonjinron (“Theories of Japaneseness”) by arguing the case for its cinema, as with other indigenous art forms, as an outward expression of the mysterious, indefinable quality known as the Yamato damashii, or “Japanese spirit,” a culturally loaded phrase that posits Japan’s uniqueness in the world; this was undeniably the case during the late 1930s, when intellectuals called for a purge of Western influences in favor of a canonization of feudal traditions of austerity and self-sacrifice for the greater national good, usually by recourse to historical period dramas from the premodern period prior to the Meiji era, giving rise to what Darrell William Davis terms the “Monumental Style” in his book Picturing Japaneseness: Monumental Style, National Identity, Japanese Film. The first foreign studies of Japanese cinema, which are covered in more detail in the introduction to the bibliography, gravitated toward auteurist studies of the major directors known in the West and close textual analyses of what were seen as key titles, mainly due to the fact that films that were intended primarily as popular entertainment in Japan were exhibited at film festivals or in specialist art-house venues in Europe and North America. While such approaches, it can be argued, have served as necessary entry points into the subject, the valorization of certain individuals had the unfortunate tendency of overlooking the overall filmmaking climate in which they worked and has acted to some extent as a distraction to a broader understanding of the subject. As Mitsuyo Wada-Marciano argues in Nippon Modern: Japanese Cinema of\n\nINTRODUCTION฀ •฀ 7\n\nthe 1920s and 1930s, previous attempts to posit the early works of Ozu Yasujirô as already somewhat exceptional in terms of content and mise-en-scène ignored the work of other directors such as Shimazu Yasujirô and Shimizu Hiroshi, who worked within the similar genres fostered by the same studio, Shochiku. More elucidating is the study of the studio environment that such figures operated within; the genres these studios cultivated; and how these genres were shaped by cultural, political, and economic factors. Japanese cinema’s long history of production and considerable output has seen films made in a variety of genres. By the Second Golden Age of the 1950s, the major studios had sufficiently established their identities and target markets so that their output could readily be distinguished from their rivals’. By producing their films at their own facilities with staffs of contracted actors, directors, cinematographers, set designers, and other technicians and exhibiting them through their own networks of venues, each studio effectively established its own recognizable style or brand, in which a film by Shochiku, which predominantly produced melodramas and romances appealing to female or family audiences, would promise something different than a film by Toei, which worked in more action-driven fields such as swashbuckling jidaigeki period dramas of yakuza gangster movies. This was not to say there was not an exchange of talent between the studios, in which contracted stars might appear on loan in other companies’ productions or directors would migrate to other studios, nor were the studios’ brands rigidly set in stone. However, the type of film produced by each company was largely defined by the figures that controlled it, such as Kido Shirô at Shochiku and Hori Kyûsaku at Nikkatsu. Furthermore, with cinema going a habitual form of entertainment before the increased permeation of television into the nation’s homes from the late 1950s onward, individual genres also experienced sudden booms in popularity, as studios struggled to increase their share of the market. Auteurist approaches tend to ignore that the two biggest hits of this period were Shochiku’s epic romance What Is Your Name? (Kimi no na wa), directed by Ôba Hideo and released in three installments from 1953 to 1954, and Shintoho’s The Emperor Meiji and the Great Russo–Japanese War (Meiji tennô to nichiro dai-sensô, 1957), directed by Watanabe Kunio, the second Japanese production to be filmed using widescreen technology. These titles have barely warranted a mention in English-language histories of Japanese cinema, yet the success of the latter in particular played a vital role in establishing the widescreen format as the norm in Japan for the next few decades and led to a short-lived postwar boom of similar re-creations of historic modern battles from Shintoho. Any study of genre in Japan must take into account that such staples as the popular action-driven samurai films known as chanbara (swordplay movies)\n\n8฀ •฀ INTRODUCTION\n\nor yakuza movies were not simply transposed from Hollywood Westerns or crime movies, although there certainly may have been foreign influences. The solitary masterless samurai, or rônin, who wanders about from town to town protecting local folk from injustice and feudal oppression certainly has its parallels with the lone outlaw of the Western movie and played as significant a role in Japan’s cinema in articulating concerns about individuality versus group identity and the dangers of authoritarianism as its counterpart did in America. However, the material on which such films were based emerged from local traditions, and the films often addressed more culturally specific concerns (the main exception to this are the films of Kurosawa Akira, whose narratives were either fictional in their basis or, as was so often the case, drew upon foreign sources, which undoubtedly has had a large bearing on their universal popularity and influence). Stories based on real-life Edo-period outlaws such as Kunisada Chûji and Shimizu no Jirôchô have retained an enduring appeal in the nation’s cinema, but the films recounting their mythologized exploits have been formalized along very different lines depending on the era in which they were made, and while they might be seen as epitomizing the jidai-geki genre, by focusing on characters outside of the law, they also can be seen as antecedents to the yakuza film. Meanwhile, while the legend of Chûshingura, or The 47 Loyal Ronin, in which a group of samurai retainers plot to avenge the death of their master, has been filmed on many occasions, films such as Salaryman Chushingura (Sararîman Chûshingura, Sugie Toshio, 1960–1961, two parts), which restaged the legend in a modern-day corporate environment, demonstrate that concepts of genre are not as impervious as one might think. Put simply, many of Japanese cinema’s core genres have been subject to revision and reinvention in accordance with the era in which they were made. At the same time, it is important to bear in mind that Toei’s ninkyô eiga (“chivalry films”) line of yakuza serials, produced during the 1960s, are also very different from the gangster films produced by Nikkatsu during the same period in their mukokuseki akushun (“Borderless Action”) range. Nikkatsu’s films were often hybrids with other genres such as the youth movie (seishun eiga) or even the musical, and directors such as Masuda Toshio have admitted to borrowing wholeheartedly from foreign sources such as Julian Duvivier’s Pepé le Moko (1936) and Jean-Luc Godard’s Breathless (À bout de souffle, 1960). To understand this concept of genre better, the process by which such endemic staples emerged in Japan is worth looking at in a little more detail. As mentioned, the first films produced in the country were shot in 1898, within a very short period of the introduction of cinema technology to Japan, and by the time of the establishment of Nikkatsu in 1909, an industrial scale of\n\nINTRODUCTION฀ •฀ 9\n\nproduction had already been realized. From the start, fictional films were categorized as being of either foreign (yôga) or domestic origin (hôga), but very soon a further division emerged within this latter group between period dramas, or jidai-geki, and contemporary dramas, or gendai geki, the latter drawing upon the Shinpa, or “New School” theatrical movement established in the late 1880s. This distinction survives to this day, although the two categories must be considered far too broad to be described as genres as such. Though barely any of the films made prior to the 1920s survive to this day, many of them having been destroyed in the Great Kantô earthquake of 1923 and even more lost through neglect and the passing of time, contemporaneous accounts describe their technique as primitive, seldom deviating from filming the action from a fixed camera position, as if the spectator were viewing a stage performance. But we can say that there were other ways of categorizing the films other than the period in which they were set. Films in both fields came to be made in comedic and melodramatic veins, while within jidai-geki, for example, films that prioritized athletic scenes of action and sword-fighting as the primary attraction were referred to as chanbara, and films featuring supernatural subject matter might be seen as a precursor to the horror genre. The gendai-geki, meanwhile, came more to be shaped through the active criticism of the Pure Film Movement, which argued for a local cinema more international in its scope that reflected a modern image of Japan by making full use of the tools unique to cinema (close-ups, fades, and the compression of action and narrative cross-cutting through the use of editing) and a less theatrical, more psychologically “realistic” style of acting. The resulting films, of which only Murata Minoru and Osanai Kaoru’s Souls on the Road (Rojô no reikon, 1921) survives, might be best described as direct emulations of American productions but featuring Japanese casts, and it was not until the early 1920s, when the newly formed Shochiku studios began to apply Hollywood techniques to tell stories reflecting the everyday reality of its audiences, that a Japanese cinema emerged that can truly be described as modern.
