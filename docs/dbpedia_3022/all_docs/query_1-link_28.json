        "text": "Many flowers from Japan have lovely and sacred meanings, each bringing their own purpose to those who admire them. Japanese flowers come in various shapes, sizes and colors. Japanese people understand the beauty of their flowers and the country has a plethora of incredible gardens for the public to enjoy. Many of these flowers can be found next to zen gardens. Look through our list to see which flowers speak to you and find a Japanese garden to explore from our guide.\n\n15 Japanese Flower Names + Meanings\n\nAs mentioned, Japanese flower meanings are significant to the culture. We’ve noted the meaning behind each flower, where you can find them, and the time of year each flower blooms. Each flower is unique in its apperance and symbolism, so you’re sure to have fun learning about each one.\n\n1. Himawari (Sunflowers)\n\nThis Japanese sunflower looks very similar to other sunflower types. The Himawaris usually grow in large fields, giving the appearance of a vast yellow sea. There is even a sunflower festival (Himawari Matsuri) that many attend to admire the beauty of these sunflowers.\n\nMeaning: Adoration, loyalty and longevity\n\nWhere you can find them: Hokuryu, Hokkaido Island, Furano Flower Fields\n\nBlooms: Summer\n\n2. Tsubaki (Camellia)\n\nCamellias are evergreen shrubs or small trees with glossy, dark green leaves. The flowers of the shrub are large (usually around 12 centimeters tall) and can vary in color from shades of red to pink. Each blossom has a group of yellow stamens.\n\nMeaning: Humility, discretion and perfect love\n\nWhere you can find them: Along the coast of Southern Japan\n\nBlooms: Spring\n\n3. Ume (Japanese Apricot)\n\nThe blossoms of the Japanese apricot tree are incredibly fragrant, smelling like sweet honey. They are edible and bonsai suitable as well, making for stunning houseplants. The blossom buds are dark pink but fade to a pale pink once fully mature.\n\nMeaning: Elegance, faithfulness and pure heart\n\nWhere you can find them: Commonly seen through the gardens of Japan\n\nBlooms: Early Spring\n\n4. Asagao (Morning Glory)\n\nAs the name says, the morning glory only blooms in the cool, breezy mornings. The base of the plant consists of green shrubbery, and the leaves are heart-shaped. The blossoms look tie-dyed with blue and white streaks.\n\nMeaning: Brief love and bond of love\n\nWhere you can find them: Japanese gardens of Osaka (Sakai)\n\nBlooms: Summer to Early Autumn\n\n5.
