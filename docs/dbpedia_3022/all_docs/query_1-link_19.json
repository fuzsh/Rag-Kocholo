        "meta_description": "\"Lost in Thoughts All Alone\" (Japanese: if～ひとり思う～ if ~Thinking Alone~) is a major musical theme from Fire Emblem Fates which is frequently performed by the character Azura throughout the game's events. The original Japanese song was performed by Renka, who provides Azura's singing voice in the Japanese version of Fates, while the English version was performed by Rena Strober, Azura's English voice actress. In the Heirs of Fate DLC series, Yoshimasa Hosoya and Matthew Mercer, the Japanese and English voice actors of Shigure respectively, sing a fourth verse exclusive to the aforementioned series alongside Azura's respective voice actresses.",
