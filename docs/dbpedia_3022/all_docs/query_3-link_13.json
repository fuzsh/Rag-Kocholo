        "text": "From the succulents lining your kitchen windowsill to a snake plant and monstera deliciosa sitting pretty in the living room, your houseplants are more than just decoration. Not only can houseplants improve your health and overall well-being, they often feel like part of the family — especially when you assign them adorable plant names. No matter the size of your indoor plant collection, we encourage proud plant parents to dream up a name for each of their plant babies.\n\nRefer to your prickly cactus as \"Spike\" or your aloe vera as \"Sunny,\" since it thrives in bright light. Make a pun out of your plant's scientific name, like calling your peperomia plant \"Pepper\" or keep it literal by dubbing your Venus fly trap \"Bug Eater.\" Try a sweet boy or girl name, like Sweetie, Cutie or Dumpling for your best behaved babies (aka low-maintenance houseplants).\n\nWhile some of these names cater to certain plant types, most are pretty or punny enough to fit any your houseplants. Think Minnie or Button for your smallest child, plus Honey or Goldie for leafy plants with subtle yellow stripes. Share a laugh every time you refer to a houseplant as Mr. Plant, Salad or Spaghetti (ideal for a trailing plant). Or, model your plant name after your favorite celebrity — wouldn't you love to meet Elvis Parsley or Morgan Treeman?\n\nIf you're looking to name a group of herbs, tiny succulents or tall houseplants, scroll to our list of names for groups — which includes Gossip Girls and Charlie's Plants. Now, it's time to scroll our list to find the perfect tile to bestow your precious plants.\n\nBest Plant Names\n\nWhen in doubt, you can't go wrong with one of these classic plant names — whether you're inspired by its size and appearance (like its small stems, spiky leaves or unique color pattern), or you prefer a lovable nickname.\n\nBean\n\nBud\n\nButton (small succulent)\n\nCutie\n\nDumpling\n\nElm\n\nHerb\n\nLeaf\n\nLucky (money trees and other Feng Shui plants)\n\nPrickles (cactus)\n\nSpike (cactus or snake plant)\n\nSprout\n\nSunny\n\nSweetie\n\nCute Plant Names\n\nSweet and simple just like your houseplant. Choose a name inspired by its natural color (possibly green, red or yellow) or plant species. Or, play around with a Greek, Spanish or Latin word that translates to something relevant (like Verde, which means green in Spanish).\n\nBugsy\n\nBug Eater (Venus fly trap)\n\nChloe, means \"green shoot\" in Greek\n\nEmerald\n\nEsmeralda, means \"emerald\" in Spanish\n\nFern\n\nFlora\n\nGoldie\n\nHoney\n\nHunter\n\nJade\n\nLily (peace lily)\n\nMinnie\n\nMajesty\n\nNoodle\n\nMinnie\n\nOlive\n\nPearl (string of pearls)\n\nPenny\n\nPepper (Peperomia plants)\n\nRuby\n\nSage\n\nSalad\n\nSucca (succulent)\n\nSylvia/Sylvie, means \"forest\" in Latin\n\nVera (aloe vera plant)\n\nVerde, means \"green\" in Spanish\n\nWillow\n\nFunny Plant Names\n\nYour plant has its quirks and its name should reflect that. There are a few punny monikers to choose from, as well as some that are just plain ironic (which makes them equally as funny).\n\nBill (money plant)\n\nChristofern (fern plant)\n\nDr. Plant\n\nThe Duke or Duchess of Plant\n\nFluffy (cactus)\n\nHot Dog (Dragon fingers)\n\nJustice Plant\n\nLil Plant\n\nMr. Plant\n\nMrs. Plant\n\nMr. Prickles (cactus)\n\nPlanty\n\nPokey\n\nPresident Plant\n\nProfessor Plant\n\nSpaghetti (trailing succulents and ferns)\n\nWoody (indoor tree)\n\nCelebrity Plant Names\n\nTake inspiration from pop culture — musicians, actors, politicians, artists and film characters — with one of these punny takes on a celebrity name. Some group names even work for plant families.\n\nBella Thorn\n\nBlue Ivy\n\nCactus Everdeen (cactus)\n\nCount Plantula\n\nDobby the Houseplant\n\nElvis Parsley (herb plant)\n\nFernie Sanders\n\nFlaura Croft\n\nKate Moss\n\nMegan Thee Plant\n\nMiley Cyprus\n\nMorgan Treeman (indoor tree)\n\nOompa Loompa\n\nOrlando Bloom\n\nShrek\n\nSir Pokes-a-Lot (cactus)\n\nSpice Girls (a group of herb plants)\n\nSnake Gyllenhaal (snake plant)\n\nSpice Girls (a group of herb plants)\n\nSpike Leaf\n\nTree Diddy\n\nTony the Tiger (striped snake plant)\n\nVincent Van Grow\n\nPlant Names for Groups\n\nIf you have more than one plant growing, brainstorm a nickname for all of them. Take inspiration from your favorite movies, TV shows and musicians."
