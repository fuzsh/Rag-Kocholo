Click here to get a copy. (Download)\n\nWriting Flower Words in Japanese\n\nFlower words have a special place in Japanese culture, as well as its written language. When reading or writing about flowers, there are two important things to keep in mind.\n\nThe Word for “Flower” Has Two Kanji\n\nThe word for “flower” in Japanese is hana, and it’s written with this kanji: 花.\n\nThat is, usually. You might also see it written like this: 華.\n\nThe practice of using two kanji for the same word is called 同訓異字 (doukun iji), which roughly means “same reading, different character” and is similar to English homonyms.\n\nBoth of the kanji above are pronounced hana but 華 is more poetic than 花.\n\nYou’re much more likely to see 花, but it’s worth knowing both!\n\nFlowers Names Are Often Written in Katakana\n\nYou might notice that instead of seeing the kanji for a flower, you’re more likely to see a flower name written in katakana.\n\nThere are two main reasons for this.\n\nFirst of all, in academic contexts, animal, insect and plant names are written in katakana, much like Latin names are written in italics in English. This practice simply stuck around, though it’s more common with plant and flower names than animal names.\n\nSecondly, the kanji for many flowers are often quite complicated. Just look at the kanji for azalea: 躑躅. Wow! It’s so much easier to remember ツツジ, isn’t it?\n\nFlowers in Japanese Culture\n\nThe fleeting nature of flowers, especially cherry blossoms, resonates deeply with the Japanese concept of 物の哀れ (mono no aware) — the understanding and appreciation of impermanence. Sakura, and flowers in general, have an important position in Japanese culture.\n\nHere are some of the ways that flowers are celebrated in Japan.\n\nHanakotoba: The Language of Flowers\n\nSimilar to the Victorian language of flowers in the West, 花言葉 (hanakotoba) focuses on individual flower meanings based on appearance, historical context and literary references. Each bloom carries a message, allowing a flower arrangement to tell an entire story.\n\nFor example, cherry blossoms symbolize the ephemeral nature of life, while red camellias represent love or a noble death (depending on context).\n\nIkebana: The Art of Floral Arrangement\n\n生け花 (ikebana), sometimes called 華道 (kadou), is the Japanese art of flower arrangement. It involves arranging flowers, stems and other natural elements in a harmonious and balanced way, often emphasizing asymmetry and negative space.\n\nIkebana practitioners focus on capturing the essence of nature and expressing it through their arrangements, which are often highly stylized and symbolic.\n\nThere are various schools of ikebana, each with its own principles and techniques. No matter which school you follow, though, mastering ikebana is a lifelong pursuit.\n\nFlowers in Rituals and Ceremonies\n\nFlowers are integral to various ceremonies and rituals, from weddings and funerals to temple offerings.\n\nSpecific blooms are chosen for their symbolic meaning. For instance, white lilies symbolize purity at weddings, while chrysanthemums represent longevity and are used in imperial ceremonies.\n\nTea ceremonies have their own type of arrangements, called 茶花 (chabana).\n\nAs you can see, flowers play an important role in Japanese culture and traditions!\n\nPopular Japanese Flowers and Their Meanings\n\nI’ve already mentioned hanakotoba, or the language of flowers. But what exactly are the flowers and their meanings? Here are some of the most common flower meanings in Japanese culture:\n\n桜 (sakura) — Cherry Blossom\n\nSymbolizes: Transience, beauty and impermanence.\n\nPerhaps the most well-known Japanese flower, the beautiful pink flowers remind us to celebrate small moments before they’re gone. The blossoms symbolize the fleeting beauty of life and the arrival of spring.\n\nEvery year, hundreds of people gather for 花見 (hanami), or flower-viewing festivals, to picnic under the falling petals of the delicate cherry flowers.\n\n梅の花 (ume no hana) — Plum Blossom\n\nSymbolizes: Perseverance, renewal and good fortune.\n\nThe hardy plum blossom is known for its perseverance, as it blooms in early spring, even when there’s still snow.\n\nLike the sakura blossom viewings in the spring, plum blossoms are celebrated in festivals called 梅まつり (ume matsuri), which typically take place during the late winter to early spring months when the plum trees are in full bloom.\n\n菊 (kiku) — Chrysanthemum\n\nSymbolizes: Longevity and rejuvenation.\n\nThis flower is often associated with the Imperial Family and the Japanese Emperor, serving as the imperial crest and appearing on official seals and currency.\n\nThe chrysanthemum is also celebrated during the Chrysanthemum Festival, known as 重陽の節句 (choyo-no-sekku), held in September or October. During this festival, people display chrysanthemum flowers and arrangements, and participate in exhibitions, honoring the flower’s symbolism and its connection to Japanese heritage.\n\n菖蒲 ( ayame ) — Iris\n\nSymbolizes: Courage and strength.\n\nThe iris is associated with the Japanese Boys’ Festival, known as 端午の節句 (tango no sekku) or 子供の日 (kodomo no hi), celebrated on May 5th. During this festival, iris leaves are used to ward off evil spirits and the flowers are displayed as decorations to pray for the healthy growth and success of boys.\n\nThe iris also has historical connections to samurai culture, as it was used as a motif in their armor and crests, symbolizing strength, valor and nobility.\n\n椿 (tsubaki) — Camellia\n\nSymbolizes: Honor and gratitude.\n\nThe camellia thrives in various climates and soil conditions, and its enduring nature make it an ideal symbol of both beauty and strength. It’s most well-known as the symbol of the samurai code of honor, 武士道 (bushido).\n\nThe elegant camellia is also used in traditional Japanese tea ceremonies.\n\n彼岸花 ( higanbana ) — Red Spider Lily\n\nSymbolizes: Death, reincarnation and the cycle of life.\n\nThis flower’s striking appearance makes it popular in gardens and landscapes. It’s believed to guide the dead, and its association with death and the afterlife means you’ll frequently see it planted in graveyards, as well. It’s often seen in Japanese media like anime as a symbol of death, like in the image from “Demon Slayer” at the head of this section.\n\nThe higanbana is also sometimes used in traditional medicine and folklore for its medicinal properties and as a protective charm against evil spirits.\n\n紫陽花 (ajisai) — Hydrangea\n\nSymbolizes: Transformation and apology.\n\nHydrangeas are groups of vibrant blue, purple or pink flowers that are often associated with the rainy season for their propensity to bloom in the seasonal showers. The flower’s ability to change color depending on soil acidity adds to its symbolism of change and transformation.\n\nIt’s also used in various rituals and festivals, such as the Hydrangea Festival, known as あじさい祭り (ajisai matsuri), where people gather to appreciate the flowers’ beauty and offer prayers for emotional healing and reconciliation.\n\n百合 (yuri) — Lily\n\nSymbolizes: Purity, innocence and renewal.\n\nLilies are often associated with spirituality and the divine, making them a common motif in religious ceremonies and rituals.\n\nThe lily’s graceful appearance and sweet fragrance have also made it a popular subject in art, literature and poetry, where it’s used to evoke feelings of beauty and serenity.\n\nAdditionally, the lily is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its therapeutic properties.\n\n藤 (fuji) — Wisteria\n\nSymbolizes: Elegance, tenderness and nostalgia.\n\nThe wisteria is admired for its cascading clusters of flowers, which bloom in various shades of purple, blue, pink and white. It’s known as fuji in Japanese, named after Mount Fuji due to its resemblance to the mountain’s cascading slopes when it blooms.\n\nThe striking flower is often featured in traditional Japanese gardens, where it’s trellised to create stunning displays during its blooming season in spring.\n\n向日葵 (himawari) — Sunflower\n\nSymbolizes: Adoration, vitality and longevity.\n\nThe sunflower’s association with the sun and its habit of turning to face the sun throughout the day further reinforces its symbolism of vitality and resilience. Its vibrant yellow petals and distinctive shape evoke feelings of warmth and positivity.\n\nFlower-related Vocabulary in Japanese\n\nBefore we get into more specific flower names in Japanese, it’ll help to know some more general words associated with flowers and gardening.
