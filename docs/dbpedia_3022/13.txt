Here at the TOM Shop, we try to offer a wide variety of Japanese artbooks, manga, light novels, and more. But there's always room to improve! If you have any book-related product requests, submit them below to let us know.

Although we won't be able to respond individually, please know that we'll do our best to honor your requests over time. (Just so long as the books you request end up being available from our suppliers.) Thanks so much for your suggestions!

Survey Deadline: November 10, 2022 (PST)

Please write your requested titles in either romaji, English, or Japanese.
