I would get more translations done if I took more vacations.

From Arai Akino's latest album Sora no Sphere. Fueled 100% by my afternoon coffee. FYI, Haleakalā is actually a volcano found in Hawaii, and the name means "house of the sun". Speaking of Hawaii and vacations, yuzu_mikan and my mom are going there on vacation next month, but I can't go because of work. Injustice!

Original title: Haleakalā

Artist: Arai Akino

Romaji

hoshi wa higashi kara WOO… kieru

kumo no haruka shita ni WOO… nemuru buruu

taiyoo no ie no WOO…

akai kureetaa ni tatsu

ai no sufia e HALEAKALA

toomei no mukoo

oozora e HIGHER

hansha suru WOO… hane yo

WOO…

tane wa ikutsu umi wo WOO… wataru

(2000 MILES AWAY)

gin no hana sakasete WOO… hikaru asa ni

(SILVER SWORDS ARE SHINING)

kaze ga umare WOO…

sekai ga me wo samasu

ai no hitomi ni HALEAKALA

azayaka na in'ei wo

tooi sora e HIGHER

unmei wa WOO… itoshii

ai no hitomi ni HALEAKALA

azayakana in'ei wo

tooi sora e HIGHER

shitte iru WOO… uta ga

CLOUDS ARE GROWING

SUN IS RISING

SKIES ARE SHINING…

English translation

The stars in the eastern sky WOO… disappear

And far below the clouds WOO… lies a sleeping blue

At the House of the Sun WOO…

I stand by the red crater

To that sphere of love HALEAKALA

And beyond the transparent

To the vast sky HIGHER

O, reflecting it WOO… these wings

WOO…

These seeds, how many oceans WOO… will they cross

(2000 MILES AWAY)

When their silver flowers bloom WOO… to shine in the morning light

(SILVER SWORDS ARE SHINING)

A wind will be born WOO…

And cause the entire world to awaken

In that gaze of indigo HALEAKALA

The brilliant shadows

To the distant sky HIGHER

My destiny is WOO… so dear

In that gaze of indigo HALEAKALA

The brilliant shadows

To the distant sky HIGHER

My heart is WOO…

To that sphere of love HALEAKALA

And beyond the transparent

I can hear HIGHER

That familiar WOO… song

CLOUDS ARE GROWING

SUN IS RISING

SKIES ARE SHINING…

That song is so gorgeous, thank you for the translation!

You're very welcome! :)

Hi, I'm from the Akino Arai Message Board... thank you.

I am looking for more Sora no Sphere translations.. I believe I found it before..

Hi there :) Long time no see!

I'm afraid I can't help you. I've only translated this song from that album so far and I'm not sure who else has. Sorry.
