Tsukikage saewatari betsu no yoru e izanau

Sameta tokai no kodou abiru KURAKUSHON[1]

Lyrics from Animelyrics.com

The moonbeams freeze over, inviting us to another night

The horns are exposed to the beat of the cold city

Kodoku yori taikutsu na seijaku wa rabirinsu

KAIRAKU ni mi wo yudanete hitaru yoru wa IRUMINEESHON no umi

Lyrics from Animelyrics.com

A labyrinth has got a silence more tedious than loneliness

Leaving my body for pleasure, this night is gonna shine in a sea of illumination

**Aoi aoi toki ga tokedashita

Hakanaku uwakiagaru mirai

Inochi wa hikari no kazu dake kirameite chiriyuku

Lyrics from Animelyrics.com

** The blue, blue moment has begun to melt

My future rises up fleetingly now

Life glitters as much as light, then it burns off.

Zawameki to kutsuoto ga afurete 'ru KONKOOSU

Mure ni oyogitsukarete naida MONOKURO

The concourse overflows with noises and footsteps

Fallen in monochromy tired of swimming amidst the crowd

Uso wo kazaritatete 'ru biru no SHOW-WINDOW

Yami kara yami ni kiete 'ku shinjitsu wa ase-iro no PRELUDE

Lyrics from Animelyrics.com

The show-windows of the buildings are decorated with lies,

Reality is just a prelude dyed of impatience disappearing from darkness to darkness

***Aoi aoi kokoro tokedashita

Setsunai namida ga furu ame

Inori wa hikari no kazu dake kagayaite chiriyuku

Lyrics from Animelyrics.com

*** My blue, blue heart began to melt

Amidst a rain of painful tears

Life glitters as much as light, then it burns off.
