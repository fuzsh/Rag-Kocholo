These collegiate chapter presi- dents have been chosen by the Executive Board to represent AOII and help keep Fraternity leaders in touch with the needs of our collegiate women.\n\nThe members of this year's CAB are Carrie Brady, Lambda Sigma Chapter (U of Georgia); Aimee Burch, Chi Psi Chapter (California Polytechnic State U); Nicole Chinadle, Alpha Phi Chapter (Montana State U); Stephanie Judy, Delta Omega Chapter (Murray State U); and Carrie Piraino, Lambda Lipsilon Chapter (Lehigh University).\n\nDuring our time together this summer while attending Leadership Institute in Los Angeles, I had the privilege to meet with these outstanding young women. An exciting observation I made was the com- mitment these ambassadors of AOII have to our Fraternity. They are committed to building stronger relationships among chapter members, motivating chapter leaders to strive for the best and strength- ening advisory support\n\nNot only are they committed to effec- tively leading their own chapters, but also they are excited to have the opportunity to work lor the betterment of AOII International Fraternity. As we meet together in September, the CAB will have an opportunity to meet with the Education and Training Committee in order to offer ideas on training sessions for Leadership Academy 2001, give insight about today's hot topics on college cam- puses and recommend educational pro- grams pertinent to college students.\n\nIt is refreshing to me to see the commit- ment many of our collegiate members, such as this vear's CAB members, have to AOII. It is the kind of commitment I hope they carry with them upon graduation. Today's young women are the future of AOII and it is the responsibility of alum- nae like you and me, to instill in our colle- \"lians a lifetime commitment to our beloved Fraternity.\n\nThere are many levels of commitment alum nae can offer regardless of age or loca- tion. Whether it's serving as an adviser, fill- ing out a Membership Information Form, or making a financial contribution, you are making a significant gift to our collegians and to the future of AOII. You are sharing your time, talents and money but, most importantly, you are portraying the liletime connection you maintain as an alumnae member of Alpha Omicron Pi.\n\nThis will be an exciting year for AOII as we dedicate a new home for our Fraternity, present our first Leadership Academy for collegiate chapter presidents, and further refine our volunteer structure. It will be a year of ongoing commitment at ail levels, from collegiate members to alumnae volunteers, as we continue to strengthen the ties of AOII.\n\nFraternally,\n\nCarole Jurenko Jones International President\n\nTo Dragma/FALL 2000\n\nMeet the 2000-2001AOII Chapter CoriSultailtTeam\n\nThis group of terrific young women will spend the next nine months traveling for Alpha Omicron Pi. Whether visiting collegiate chapters or working with new colonies, these women will be providinga valuable service to our chapters. Each has completed two extensive training sessions at AOII Headquarters and attended an NPC sponsored leadership training program. The Fraternity genuinely appreciates the commitment each of these women has made to Alpha Omicron Pi. When one of these consultants visits your chapter during the next few months, please make her feel welcomed.\n\nEthnie Groves\n\nChapter:\n\nChi Delta, U of Colorado- Boulder, English Major Hometown:\n\nRapid Gty, South Dakota\n\nChapter Offices: Chapter President, Recording Secretary, Preference Head (Recruitment), Spirit/Suggestion Chairman, Philanthropy Comm., Public Relations Comm.\n\nActivities:\n\nMarching Band, Flute, Campus Band, Order of Omega\n\nAwards:\n\nScholarship Award, Best Senior Attendance, Mortar Board Outstanding Junior Hobbies:\n\nSpending time with fam- ily and friends, aerobics, movies, hiking, reading\n\nJiU Soost\n\nChapter:\n\nGamma Omicron, U of Florida, Sport Management Major Hometown:\n\nOrlando, Florida\n\nChapter Offices:\n\nNew Member Educator, Philanthropic Chairman, Dance Marathon Chairman, Fundraising Chairman\n\nActivities:\n\nPanhelenic AVP and Intramural Director, Student Alumni Assoc., Rho Lambda, Florida Blue Key,SGA-Director of Environmental Awareness, Intramural Football Officials Coordinator\n\nAwards:\n\nRuby A Award, LC Member of the Year, Panhellenic Director of Y ear\n\nHobbies:\n\nPlaying sports, playing with nephews, reading, cross stitch and crafts\n\nMelissa Parsons\n\nChapter:\n\nOmega, Miami U, Social Work Major\n\nHometown:\n\nDefiance, Ohio\n\nOffices:\n\nChapter President, Scholarship Chairman, Recruitment Chairman Activities:\n\nPanhellenic FVesident, U Honors Program, Golden Key NHS, Butler County Child Assault Prevention Project, U Appeals Board, Mortar Board Awards:\n\nAOII 1998 Woman of Leadership Award, 1999 Perry Award, Miami U Outstanding Chapter President, Greek W oman of the Year -2000, Summa Cum Laude, MGGV Outstanding Area VP\n\nHobbies:\n\nReading, spending time with family & friends, working out, shopping\n\nKealie Frazier\n\nChapter:\n\nRho Omicron, Middle Tennessee State U, History Major Hometown:\n\nJackson, Tennessee\n\nOffices:\n\nPhilanthropic Chairman, Social Chairman Recruitment Comm., Chapter Relations Comm., Awards Chairman\n\nActivities:\n\nRho Chi, Student Ambassador, Student Orientation Assistant, \"Up Til Dawn\" Director Awards:\n\nWho's Who, Greek Woman of the Year, Outstanding Greek Ambassador, MTSU O.S.CAR Recipient, 2000 AOII Collegiate Woman of leadership Hobbies:\n\nTravel, sight seeing, read- ing, enjoying new things\n\nMegan Ehrisman\n\nChapter:\n\nIota, U of Illinois Urbana- Champaign, Advertising Major\n\nHometown:\n\nNaperville, Illinois\n\nOffices:\n\nCOR Chairman, Philanthropy Recruitment Event Co- Chairman, Panhellenic Delegate\n\nActivities:\n\nAmerican Advertising Federation, Greek Intervarsity, Homecoming Comm., SERVE Illinoisfacilitator, Panhellenic Vice President-Development, Board of Sorority Affairs Awards:\n\nDean's List, 2000 Most Outstanding Greek Nominee\n\nHobbies:\n\nRunning, listening to music, movies, reading, travel, spending time with close friends\n\nAre you interested in becoming a Chapter Consultant?

The archives also houses dozens of rose tea cups, sterling silver punch bowls, old To Draginas, treasured scrapbooks, and Stella's trunk. Add a couple of baby grand pianos, a crystal chandelier, a library full of books, a jewelry collection, thousands of photos, artwork and you can only begin to envision the vastness of the memoribilia we have stored in our archives. Before the end of the year, AOII will move into our new fraternity home with expanded room for archival storage and display. It's an exciting time for us as we have more opportunity to properly preserve and protect AOII's heritage. Many great ladies have served as International Historian of our Fraternity. Certainly one of the greatest remains our first, Stella George Stern Perry. We are publishing Stella's inspiring 1936 convention speech as an example of one of the countless treasures we have on hand. Past International President, Nancy Moyer McCain, has been leading our archival preservation for the past 20 years and will turn over the position to Past International President Joan Deathe MacCallum in January 2001. Their excitement about our fraternity's past, present and future is contagious. We invite you to visit our new home and tour AOII's history in the making.\n\nTo Dragma/FALL 2000\n\nBY NANCY MOYER MCCAIN INTERNATIONAL HISTORIAN, RHO (NORTHWESTERN U )\n\nThe Founders of AOII had not met one another that fall day in 1894 when they entered Barnard College. During the next two years, these classmates became devoted friends and determined to perpetuate their friendship in the form of a new woman's fraternity. Thus it was on December 23, 1896, they pledged each other and on January 2, 1897, founded Alpha Omicron Pi.\n\nStella was the Fraternity's first Historian, a lifelong responsibil- ity she faithfully fulfilled. Her home in Brooklyn Heights was the repository for AOII's early memorabilia. Among those treasures is a notebook bearing the tide \"Alpha Omicron Pi.\" The first page is dated January 2, 1897. AOII's Constitution begins on that page and contin-\n\nues on the following ones. Perhaps this is AOII's first arti- fact This collection in Stella's care grew to include an assort- ment of documents, records, photographs and delightful oddments that reveal day-to- day activities and pleasures of those early years. Stella made a significant contribution to this collection. In recognition of AOII's Twenty-fifth Anniversary she, an accomplished author in her own right, wrote The History of Alpha Omicron Pi, 1897-1923, a detailed and won- derfully readable account of the Fraternity's first quarter century. Stella's stewardship of this early archival collection ended at her death in 1956. Her collection\n\nwas transferred to Headquarters.\n\nIt always was Stella's desire that as many AOIIs as possible be\n\nOpposite page, Sigma Chapter (V of California-Berkeley).

Her solution was to take some of the items to conventions where she would set up an exhibit She transported them in a steamer trunk. \"Stella's Trunk\" and its contents became an eagerly anticipated feature of conventions. Just when the custom began has not been determined but we do know it was well established by the 1930s. These historical exhibits at conventions continued until the fragile artifacts showed signs of deterioration. For this reason and also, the possibility of fur- ther damage to artifacts or the\n\npossible loss of the collection, the custom was discontinued after the 1987 convention.\n\nAll the while Stella was accu- mulating and caring for her collection, archival items were piling up at Headquarters. From time to time they were packed and kept in commercial storage. That situation changed in November 1981 when the Fraternity's Headquarters was moved to the first AOII-owned building on Cleghorn Avenue in Nashville, Tennessee. Boxes of archives came from storage and filled a large portion of the cavernous storage space in the\n\nIt top left, an Omega (Miami I ) May Queen; above, a 1052 Frontier Nursing Service visit - AOH's first philanthropy: opposite page.

Organizing these diverse collections began in the early\n\n1980s and continued into the 1990s. Archives were invalu- able for planning both the extensive historical exhibit mounted in the Overlook Boulevard Headquarters in conjunction with the 1993 Nashville Convention at Oprvland Hotel and in prepa- ration for AOH's Centennial\n\nCelebration in 1997.\n\nAlthough the basic organiza- tion is complete, much remains to be done. Since early in the organization process, we have made use ot the amazing archival supplies which preserve, protect and safely store artifacts. New products and processes are being introduced and we are reviewing them with an eye to their use for our collections.\n\nPlanning a new Headquarters has provided the opportunity, at time of construction, to incorporate essential require- ments to assure correct display\n\nand storage facilities. The areas of concern are the Museum and Library on the Main Level and the large storage area on the Lower level. Museum/archives consultants have worked closely with ii- concerning (he s|>ecific requirements lor these areas.\n\nNow that Headquarters is the established repository lor AOII archives, there is need to pro- vide on-going attention to the collections as well as to oversee the use of artifacts. To satisfy both of these needs, Alpha Omicron Pi Foundation has provided a grant to underwrite stall time for the Archives Administrator for 2000-2001. \\ portion of the exhibits will be permanent Others will be specific and change from time to time. The Library will fea- ture books written by AOII authors and books about members of our Fraternity. Bound issues of To Dragma dating to the first issue in 1905 make fascinating reading.\n\nRemember... a visit to AOII IIcadquartcrs includes a trip in\n\ntime to the beginning of AOII!\n\n8\n\nTo Dragma/FALL 20(10\n\nWRITTEN BY STELLA GEORCE STERN PERRY FOR THE OHIO VALLEY DISTRICT CONVENTION, 1 9 3 6 . AMENDED AS REQIIREU IN 1 9 3 9 .\n\nTo Dragma/FALL 2000\n\n9\n\nIhere's so much difference between telling you the story of the early days and writing it to you! I had gready hoped to be with you and to sit in a family group and talk these tilings over. But now that I've only the half-comfort of imagining myself there, I'll try to tell you some of the intimate things about our beginnings, although, of necessity, sketchily.\n\nThose of you who have met the Founders know that we're just \"regular folks\", and will understand, in spite of the glamour that your devotion throws about us and that other radiance thrown, as I write, by our own memories of youth, that back there in the '90s we were just lour regular college girls, very like yourselves.\n\nRemembering our young days, with their many unheroic phases, it amuses us and makes us feel apologetic, too, to appear before you so often as on pedestals.\n\n1 used to say diat, if the clock could turn back and put us four on your campus as students, you'd know the difference only by our clothes. But even the style of our clothes is coming back into fashion (though I hope sleeves will not again get so large that you can carry your luncheons in them, nor skirts so long that they have to have brush-bind- ing to sweep the streets!) They're so much like ours that perhaps you'd accept us without question, and I hope you would bid us to Alpha Omicron Pi.\n\nBut you wouldn't do that if you happened to be looking for anything ostentatious, for we were very simple, not one weahhy and not one valuing very highly the show-window superficialities of life.\n\nWewereexceedinglyfrankand merry, very much alive to enjoy the golden years we were living, vitally interested in every phase of our college life, and in the life around us, men- tally inquisitive and ardently, enthusiastically devoted to one another, to our chosen group of friends, and to the Class of\n\nThai Class, still known - to its members, at least - as \"the great and glorious Class of '98\", explains much of our audacity in starting a new fraternity. It was, and still is, outstanding for its solidarity, its pride in itself, good fellowship and especially, initiative. The Dean said that other classes might get more out of college, but no class could ever put more in than ours did. No space here to tell you the many Barnard tradi- tions and institutions that '98 started; nor would they interest any but Barnardians.\n\nthe classes preceding ours felt themselves to be pioneers and took themselves very, very VEBY seriously. And, as few prep schools were ready with the severe entrance require- ments - and you'd gasp if' I out- lined them to you - most of those students were older than college girls generally are.\n\nBut we in '98 were young. We were the first class of college girls as we now see them to enter Barnard. So, even as freshmen, we were a sensation to our sedate superiors as we\n\ns\n\n3=\n\nYou see, Barnard College was the first separate college for women to be affHiat-\n\ned with a great men's . . . . . university, oflering\n\nthe same entrance examinations, the same University courses under the same faculty and granting the degree not of the College but of the Lniversity. So\n\nwent ahead and merrily made our own traditions, customs and practices with a happy buoyancy.\n\nHowever, we could not be friv- olous, for there were few, if any, rich girls in the entire class,andwehadallgoneto college with definite and prac- tical purposes and an ardor of intention that put earnestness and aspiration in the back- ground of our gay, friendly, advenmrous, varied days, when we were your age.\n\nSo much for the setting.\n\nJNow, we have reason to know well that more than one prominent \"national\" would have eagerly entered Barnard at that time, would have eager- ly welcomed a local group, as ours. Indeed, one such had been at Barnard from the beginning and had taken in all the members of the first tiny, sedate classes.\n\nWhy, then, you will be asking, did we four choose rather to make a new fraternity of our own - surely a more dangerous and difficult task?\n\nI will try to tell you.\n\nIn those days many of the evils still sometimes complained of in fraternity life and many others now happily past or passing - this due, in part, we dare believe, to Alpha Omicron Pi's own attitude - many of those evils were distincdy obvious in the already existing societies. I do not mean to imply for a\n\n'<»%\n\nI 1 1\n\nHi\n\nTo Drapna/FALL 2000\n\nmoment that they were known to be in all of them, or even that we believed diem to exist in all. But they certainly were pretty general. And how to be sure?\n\nWe knew exactly what we wanted and the way to be sure of getting it was to make it, if we could.\n\nWe wanted a society that should continue our compan- ionship through life, and extend the like joys to others, usefully, unselfishly, and with- out pettiness. We wanted to enshrine, sublimate and per-\n\nWe wanted to be sure of a democratic fraternity, democ- ratic in choosing members, democratic in internal govern- ment, so that all members to come must share our responsi- bility and feel bound to exer- cise for themselves the motives that impelled the Founders.\n\nWe especially wanted one with no snobbery, no ostentation, no extravagance, no exclusiveness, no silly \"superiorities\", no triv-\n\ntion to some worthy end, some object of loving kindness that should make our organization to its members an enduring bond of happy mutual labors and to their environment an enrichment.\n\nTherefore, having decided to make that sort of fraternity if we could, we had also to decide,\n\nalways unfailing in its results. Under that sign we were sure of success, and we felt that the aspect of it most lacking and most needed lay in our motto and would give us the means desired to make our secrecy, in its highest usage, not a mystery but a modesty.\n\nOh, 1 do not want you to believe that we ourselves always lived up to our ideal, or that we never failed to act according to our intention. Of course, we fell down some- times. Of course, we made many mistakes. By no means perfect, we had to learn a lot by trial and failure. But we did keep the purpose before us as an end, and I know that Alpha Omicron Pi has ever done so.\n\nNeither do I want you to think for a minute that we saw and foresaw the future that has so wonderfully blest us, that we envisioned the growth in 42 years from four members to almost three times that many thousands. We were not prophets and not really the founders of all this.\n\nThe only True Founder found- ed our purpose and saw the harvest He was to bless from the little seed He Himself had planted. His alone was the vision and to Him alone be your thanks.\n\nOpposite page top left, \"Just Married\" in the 1920s; below left.

And in what aspect of it is it most lacking and most needed?\"\n\nYou know the answer.\n\nThere had been vouchsafed to us for one another the one thing always needed and\n\nTo Dragma/FALL 2000\n\nI 1\n\nBut I will say that, if we did not foresee the future, neither did we fear it. And when in the early years of national life stag- gering difficulties which I can- not now relate, confronted us, they could not frighten nor deter us.\n\nNow, having determined to make this democratic, unos- tentatious, simple society, we climbed up a little winding stair into the stackroom, a small upper chamber of old Columbia Library, a beautiful Gothic building, now demol- ished. This was a little tower room, rarely used, where Anglo-Saxon tomes and ancient vellum manuscripts were stored. We sat in a deep seat built under a mulhoned window of that quiet room, pigeons outside and snow lightly falling, and there, with what emotion you can imag-\n\nine, we pledged one another, at the very beginning of the year f897. (And you were all there,\n\nthough we did not know it!)\n\nSoon afterwards, we used the initiation ritual for the first time on our classmate, Anne Richardson Hall of St. Joseph, Missouri, now Mrs. R. J. Curdy of Kansas Gty.\n\nYou will want to know about our badge.\n\nOne of the first decisions we\n\nmade was to have one emblem\n\nonlv and that a direct reminder\n\nJ\n\nof our essential purpose. We felt that that would give us enough to live up to, and would identify us at least as well as would numerous supplementary- devices. We felt that synthetic coats of arms (besides being mediaeval and out of accord in societies called Greek), shields, sub-mottoes, fraternity jewelry of a general nature, stamped toilet goods and what not, and all other trifles bearing shields\n\n/ 7-\n\n12\n\nTo Dragma/FALL 2000\n\n77\"\n\nand coats of arms, were cheap, childish, and undignified in comparison with one austere, though rich, badge. And we felt that many societies had these things not for intrinsic usefulness but just because others did. By avoiding this foolish conformity we could from the start indicate our determined simplicity.\n\nOne motto, one badge, one bond - and singleness of heart!\n\nWe did not want a design that showed some little object and resembled a breast-pin or brooch or lace-pin, and we did not want one that looked like a school pin or could be mistaken, if not scrutinized, for the badge of many anoth- er society. We wanted a badge that told us why we wore it We therefore chose our monogram.\n\nTheodore B. Starr was the \"Cartier\" of that period and tire Starr designer of insignia the foremost artist of his kind. We engaged Starr and his designer to arrange the pro- portions. We went to see them about it on our bicycles. (Fancy girls going down Broadway and Fifth Avenue on bicycles today!)\n\nOur first step in expansion, which made us \"national\" was the installation of Pi Chapter in New Orfeans. At Newcomb almost identical conditions pre- vailed as at Barnard when we began, that is to say, one entrenched fraternity there and all the others eagerly interest- ed. Pi Chapter's ideals and\n\nreasons for the courageous course of joining a brand-new fraternity were the same as oursinfoundingitWe.cannot overestimate Pi's bravery and loyalty. It was in the summer; only three girls were pledged to begin the new chapter; but these were highly influential girls who were confident of their following. Of these, two were out of town, during an epidemic, when the day of installation came. So I instafled Pi Chapter through one girl, Katherine Reed. We cannot overvalue Katherine andwhatshedidforus.Sheis now head of the French\n\nBres came back to town and Katherine initiated them; and when Newcomb opened we had a real chapter ready. Years ago, lovely Leigh joined our Alpha Omega Chapter, but we have in our ranks her gifted, charming and loyal daughters. In 1939 our bright Adele also became a member of our sacred memorial chapter. These three were indeed on our frontier.\n\nThus, Alpha Omicron Pi start- ed little more than forty years ago with four members and\n\nHumanly speaking, you are all founders of Alpha Omicron Pi today, quite as truly as we were in the beginning.

Next spring, the inaugural Leadership Academy will target training to all our collegiate chapter presidents in the Training center of our new International Headquarters in Brentwood, Tennessee. This expansive training facility is currendy under construction and our chapter presidents will be the first group to utilize our beautiful new home for training. In future years, other chapter offices will be added, and chapters will have input into the process of determining which areas to strengthen within their chapter.\n\nLeadership Academy will provide chapter officers the opportunity to learn more about themselves, to develop leadership skills, and share ideas with other leaders in our organization. Most importandy, it will assist in providing the necessary tools to become more effective leaders.\n\nAlpha Omicron Pi is excited to be able to host this training program in our new fraternity home.

They have proven to be enormously popular with alumnae and collegians because the atmosphere is fun and casual, and the focus is on education, training and sisterhood.\n\nIn its second year, the Stellar Starter program was a resounding suc- cess. Chapters are asked to send a sophomore member identified as an emerging leader, or \"Stellar Starter.\" to LI for training. Their training included \"Leading with Style,\" in which they learned the basic dynam- ics of leadership method- ologies and how to use them in everyday life. Additionally, the basics\n\nof goal mapping were addressed to assist them throughout their college career, professional, and personal life.\n\nSpecific programmirig included a general ses- sion on AOII Ritual and religion. A panel discus-\n\nIntegrity G r o w t h I lonor \"fraditionj\n\nsion explored the link between our Ritual and various religious beliefs and how Ritual meshes with everyday life.\n\nOther sessions focused on etiquette, meeting management, conflict resolution, ethics and values, balancing life and work, and keeping alumnae members moti- vated.

The Foundation granted about $140,000 in awards made possible with your gifts during 1999-2000.\n\n• $51,200 for Educational and Leadership Grants to the Fraternity.\n\n• $22,250 for Scholarships to A01I collegians, graduate students and alumnae. • $43,500 Arthritis Research and the American Juvenile Arthritis Organization. • $23,800 for Ruby Fund Grants to your sisters in dire need.\n\nThe Foundation appreciated your commitment to continue your generous annual gifts while also supporting our new Headquarters Campaign. Annual giving is our opportunity to keep our successful programs strong, and to ensure that AOII is a Fraternity for the 21st century, as well as a Fraternity with a long and cherished history.\n\nTwo years ago the Foundation Board developed our three-year strategic plan. We continue to meet the many goals set by that plan. The support of AJAO (American Juvenile Arthritis Organization) was one of our new goals. We wanted to make AOIIs and others aware that arthritis is not just an \"old person's\" disease.\n\nWith your chapter fundraising efforts in addition to individual gifts, w e have been able to send 6 families to the Arthritis National Education Conferences, as well as young adults aged 18-25. We have also under- writtenseveralyoungadultbreakoutsessions. Thisyearwewillbeginofferingarthritismini-grantsso chapters can get donation credit tlirough the Foundation and still designate their funds to local arthritis chapters.\n\nThe President's Club, recognizing leadership in annual giving, was instituted. The 1897 Club, recognizing new graduates and young alumnae donors' annual support, also was instituted.\n\nOur Ambassador Program enables the Foundation to reach sisters i n all parts o f the country b y sending representatives to local chapters. You can request an Ambassador to attend your Founders' Day, State Day or chapter meeting for a short Foundation presentation.\n\nThe Foundation will be celebrating its Silver Anniversary in 2002! Our goal is to increase the size of our unrestricted endowment to one million dollars and our grant dollars by 100%. We can't do this without your continued support. In addition to your annual support, become a member o f our Second Century Society or make a millennium pledge to our Endowment Fund. Or consider all three!\n\n\"To keep a lamp burning, you have to keep putting oil in it.\" Mother Teresa. That is a good message to remember as we look at financial needs for the coming years. The members of the Foundation thank you for helping to keep the lamp burning and ensuring AOll's financial future.\n\nMEMBER\n\nSISTERS HELPINGENSUREAOII'S FUTURE Dragma/FALL 2000\n\n21\n\nFraternally,\n\nJean E.Sells.
