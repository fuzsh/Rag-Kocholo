Using microphysical and radiative transfer modeling, we show that even at the frigid temperatures in the outer reaches of the solar system, a slab of low porosity methane ice can indeed form by pressureless sintering of micron-sized grains, and it can qualitatively reproduce the salient features of the measured spectra. A good semiquantitative match with the near-IR spectra can be obtained with a realistic slab model, provided the spectra are scaled to a visible albedo of 0.6, at the low end of the values currently estimated from Spitzer thermal measurements. Consistent with previous modeling studies, matching spectra scaled to higher albedos requires the incorporation of strong backscattering effects. The albedo may become better constrained through an iterative application of the slab model to the analysis of the thermal measurements from Spitzer and the visible/near-IR reflectance spectra. The slab interpretation offers two falsifiable predictions (1) Absence of an opposition surge, which is commonly attributed to the fluffiness of the optical surface. This prediction is best testable with a spacecraft, as Earth-based observations at true opposition will not be possible until early next century. (2) Unlikelihood of the simultaneous occurrence of very long spectroscopic path lengths in both methane and nitrogen ice on the surface of any Kuiper Belt Object, as the more volatile nitrogen would hinder densification in methane ice.\n\nVibration-rotation band intensities in the IR spectra of polyatomic molecules\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nEl'kin, M.D.; Kosterina, E.K.; Berezin\n\n1995-01-01\n\nUsing the curvilinear vibrational coordinates for a nuclear subsystem, expressions for the effective dipole-moment operators are derived in order to analyze the vibrational-rotational transitions in the IR spectra of polyatomic rigid molecules. The explicit expressions obtained for the intensities of hot bands allow one to estimate the influence of the vibration-rotation interaction within the framework of the adopted molecular-vibration model.

But the determination structures for the detected bands in the interstellar and circumstellar space are not completely understood so far. For that purpose, the aim of this article is to provide all possible infrared spectra for C{sub 20} and C{sub 60} fullerenes and their hydrogenated fullerenes. Density Functional theory (DFT) is applied using B3LYP exchange-functional with basis set 6â31G(d, p). The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) is found to be capable of distinguishing between fullerenes, mono hydrogenated fullerenes and fully hydrogenated fullerenes. In addition, deposition of one hydrogen atom outside the fully hydrogenated fullerenes is found to be distinguished by forming H{sub 2} molecule at peak around 4440 cm{sup â1}. However, deposition of one hydrogen atom inside the fully hydrogenated fullerenes cannot be distinguished.

The infrared and Raman spectra of DTBHQ were recorded in the region 400-4000 cm -1 and 50-3500 cm -1, respectively. In addition, the IR spectra in CCl 4 at various concentrations of DTBHQ are also recorded. The computed vibrational wavenumbers were compared with the IR and Raman experimental data. Computational calculations at B3LYP level with two different basis sets 6-31G(d,p) and 6-311++G(d,p) are also employed in the study of the possible conformer of DTBHQ. The complete assignments were performed on the basis of the potential energy distribution (PED) of the vibrational modes, calculated using VEDA 4 program.

The molecular geometry, harmonic vibrational frequencies and bonding features of piroxicam in the ground state have been calculated by Hartree-Fock (HF) and density functional theory (DFT) methods using 6-311++G(d,p) basis set. The calculated harmonic vibrational frequencies are scaled and they are compared with experimental obtained by FT-IR and FT-Raman spectra. A detailed interpretation of the vibrational spectra of the title compound has been made on the basis of the calculated potential energy distribution (PED). The electronic properties, such as HOMO and LUMO energies, molecular electrostatic potential (MESP) are also performed.

[Bundesanstalt fuer Materialforschung und -pruefung (BAM), Berlin (Germany)\n\n2001-07-01\n\nIR spectra of a deuterated glass of the composition (in mol%) 16 Na{sub 2}O . 10 CaO . 74 SiO{sub 2} complete earlier spectroscopic studies on water-poor soda-lime-silica glasses. The approved IR spectroscopic method of the deuterium exchange allows a reliable assignment of the hydroxyl bands also in the case of glasses. By spectra comparison the assignment of the IR bands at 3500 and 2800 cm{sup -1} to hydroxyl groups with different hydrogen bonding is verified. The IR band at about 4500 cm{sup -1} is interpreted as both a combination of the stretching vibrations {nu}O-H and {nu}Si-OH and a combination of the stretching vibration {nu}O-H and the deformation vibration {delta}SiOH. The bands at 1763 and 1602 cm{sup -1} are attributed to combination vibrations of the glass network.

The basic spectral properties of the crystals were interpreted quantitatively in terms of the \"strong-coupling\" theory. The model of the centrosymmetric dimer of hydrogen bonds postulated by us facilitated the explanation of the well-developed, two-branch structure of the nu(N-H) and nu(N-D) bands as well as the isotopic dilution effects in the spectra. On the basis of the linear dichroic and temperature effects in the polarized IR spectra of ACN crystals, the H/D isotopic \"self-organization\" effects were revealed. A nonrandom distribution of hydrogen isotope atoms (H or D) in the lattice was deduced from the spectra of isotopically diluted ACN crystals. It was also determined that identical hydrogen isotope atoms occupy both hydrogen bonds in the dimeric systems, where each hydrogen bond belongs to a different chain. A more complex fine structure pattern of nu(N-H) and nu(N-D) bands in ACN spectra in comparison with the spectra of other secondary amides (e.g., N-methylacetamide) can be explained in terms of the \"relaxation\" theory of the IR spectra of hydrogen-bonded systems.\n\nNew Solid-Phase IR Spectra of Solar-System Molecules: Methanol, Ethanol, and Methanethiol\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHudson, Reggie L.; Gerakines, Perry A.; Ferrante, Robert F.\n\n2017-10-01\n\nThe presence and abundances of organic molecules in extraterrestrial environments, such as on TNOs, can be determined with infrared (IR) spectroscopy, but significant challenges exist. Reference IR spectra for organics under relevant conditions are vital for such work, yet for many compounds such data either are lacking or fragmentary. In this presentation we describe new laboratory results for methanol (CH3OH), the simplest alcohol, which has been reported to exist in planetary and interstellar ices. Our new results include near- and mid-IR spectra, band strengths, and optical constants at various ice temperatures. Moreover, the influence of H2O-ice is examined. In addition to CH3OH, we also have new results for the related cometary molecules CH3SH and CH3CH2OH. Although IR spectra of such molecules have been reported by many groups over the past 60 years, our work appears to be the first to cover densities, refractive indices, band strengths and optical constants of both the amorphous and crystalline phases. Our results are compared to earlier work, the influence of literature assumptions is explored, and possible revisions to the literature are described.

Powder X-ray diffraction analysis confirms that MPM crystal belongs to triclinic system with space group P-1. FTIR and FT Raman spectra are recorded at room temperature. Functional group assignment has been made for the melaminium cations and perchlorate anions. Vibrational spectra have also been discussed on the basis of quantum chemical density functional theory (DFT) calculations using Firefly (PC GAMESS) version 7.1 G. Vibrational frequencies are calculated and scaled values are compared with experimental values. The assignment of the bands has been made on the basis of the calculated PED. The Mulliken charges, HOMO-LUMO orbital energies are analyzed directly from Firefly program log files and graphically illustrated. HOMO-LUMO energy gap and other related molecular properties are also calculated. The theoretically constructed FT-IR and FT-Raman spectra of MPM coincide with the experimental one. The chemical structure of the compound has been established by 1H and 13C NMR spectra. No detectable signal was observed during powder test for second harmonic generation.\n\nResonant inelastic X-ray scattering spectra at the Ir L-edge in Na{sub 2}IrO{sub 3}\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nIgarashi, Jun-ichi, E-mail: junichi.igarashi.kiryu@vc.ibaraki.ac.jp [Faculty of Science, Ibaraki University, Mito, Ibaraki 310-8512 (Japan); Nagao, Tatsuya, E-mail: nagao@gunma-u.ac.jp [Faculty of Engineering, Gunma University, Kiryu, Gunma 376-8515 (Japan)\n\n2016-10-15\n\nHighlights: â¢ A theoretical framework of resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) on the basis of the itinerant electron scheme has been developed. â¢ The RIXS theory is applied to iridate Na{sub 2}IrO{sub 3}. â¢ The origins of the multi-peak structure of the excitation spectra found in the RIXS experiment have been assigned to the magnetic and excitonic excitations. - Abstract: We analyze resonant X-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra in Na{sub 2}IrO{sub 3} on the basis of the itinerant electron picture. Employing a multi-orbital tight-binding model on a honeycomb lattice, we find that the zigzag magnetic order is the most stable with sizable energy gap in the one-electron band within the HartreeâFock approximation. We derive the RIXS spectra, which are connected to the generalized densityâdensity correlation function. We calculate the spectra as a function of excitation energy Ï, within the random phase approximation. The spectra consist of the peaks with Ï < 20 meV, and of the peaks with 0.4 < Ï < 0.8 eV. The former peaks are composed of four bound states in the densityâdensity correlation function, and may be identified as the magnetic excitations, while the latter peaks are composed of 16 bound states below the energy continuum of individual electronâhole pair excitations, and may be identified as the excitonic excitations. The calculated spectra agree qualitatively with the recent RIXS experiment.\n\nPCA: Principal Component Analysis for spectra modeling\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHurley, Peter D.; Oliver, Seb; Farrah, Duncan; Wang, Lingyu; Efstathiou, Andreas\n\n2012-07-01\n\nThe mid-infrared spectra of ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) contain a variety of spectral features that can be used as diagnostics to characterize the spectra. However, such diagnostics are biased by our prior prejudices on the origin of the features. Moreover, by using only part of the spectrum they do not utilize the full information content of the spectra. Blind statistical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) consider the whole spectrum, find correlated features and separate them out into distinct components. This code, written in IDL, classifies principal components of IRS spectra to define a new classification scheme using 5D Gaussian mixtures modelling. The five PCs and average spectra for the four classifications to classify objects are made available with the code.\n\nVizieR Online Data Catalog: IRS spectra with features of crystalline silicates (Chen+, 2016)\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nChen, R.; Luo, A.; Liu, J.; Jiang, B.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nSpectra taken by the IRS (Houck et al. 2004ApJS..154...18H) on the Spitzer space telescope (Werner et al. 2004ApJS..154....1W) are now publicly available. These spectra are produced using the bksub.tbl products from SL and LL modules of final SSC pipeline, version 18.18. From the IRS data archive, we found a collection of 16986 low-resolution spectra. The spectra are merged by four slits: SL2 (5.21-7.56 Î¼m), SL1 (7.57-14.28 Î¼m), LL2 (14.29-20.66 Î¼m), and LL1 (20.67-38.00 Î¼m). As crystalline silicates have no features in the SL2 band, we choose the spectra that include all the other three bands: SL1, LL2, and LL1 so that the object has a continuous spectrum from about 7.5-38 Î¼m. In this way, five of the seven infrared complexes of crystalline silicates are covered, i.e., the 10, 18, 23, 28, and 33 Î¼m complexes.

I.; Vandyukov, A. E.; Fuchs, S.; Majoral, J. P.; Caminade, A. M.; Kovalenko, V. I.\n\n2011-11-01\n\nThe FTIR and FT-Raman spectra of the zero generation dendron, possessing five fluorescent dansyl terminal groups, cyclotriphosphazene core, and one carbamate function G0v were studied. The structural optimization and normal mode analysis were performed for G0v dendron on the basis of the density functional theory (DFT). The calculated geometrical parameters and harmonic vibrational frequencies are predicted in a good agreement with the experimental data. It was found that dendron molecule G0v has a concave lens structure with slightly non-planar cyclotriphosphazene core. The experimental IR and Raman spectra of G0v dendron were interpreted by means of potential energy distributions. Relying on DFT calculations a complete vibrational assignment is proposed. The frequency of Î½(N-H) band in the IR spectrum reveal the presence of H-bonds in the G0v dendron.\n\nIR spectral analysis for the diagnostics of crust earthquake precursors\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nR. M. Umarkhodgaev\n\n2012-11-01\n\nFull Text Available Some possible physical processes are analysed that cause, under the condition of additional ionisation in a pre-breakdown electric field, emissions in the infrared (IR interval. The atmospheric transparency region of the IR spectrum at wavelengths of 7â15 Î¼m is taken into account. This transparency region corresponds to spectral lines of small atmospheric constituents like CH4, CO2, N2O, NO2, NO, and O3. The possible intensities of the IR emissions observable in laboratories and in nature are estimated. The acceleration process of the electrons in the pre-breakdown electrical field before its adhesion to the molecules is analyzed. For daytime conditions, modifications of the adsorption spectra of the scattered solar emissions are studied; for nighttime, variations of emission spectra may be used for the analysis.\n\nApplication of FT-IR spectroscopy on breast cancer serum analysis\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nElmi, Fatemeh; Movaghar, Afshin Fayyaz; Elmi, Maryam Mitra; Alinezhad, Heshmatollah; Nikbakhsh, Novin\n\n2017-12-01\n\nBreast cancer is regarded as the most malignant tumor among women throughout the world. Therefore, early detection and proper diagnostic methods have been known to help save women's lives. Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, coupled with PCA-LDA analysis, is a new technique to investigate the characteristics of serum in breast cancer. In this study, 43 breast cancer and 43 healthy serum samples were collected, and the FT-IR spectra were recorded for each one. Then, PCA analysis and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were used to analyze the spectral data. The results showed that there were differences between the spectra of the two groups. Discriminating wavenumbers were associated with several spectral differences over the 950-1200 cm- 1(sugar), 1190-1350 cm- 1 (collagen), 1475-1710 cm- 1 (protein), 1710-1760 cm- 1 (ester), 2800-3000 cm- 1 (stretching motions of -CH2 & -CH3), and 3090-3700 cm- 1 (NH stretching) regions. PCA-LDA performance on serum IR could recognize changes between the control and the breast cancer cases. The diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of PCA-LDA analysis for 3000-3600 cm- 1 (NH stretching) were found to be 83%, 84%, 74% for the control and 80%, 76%, 72% for the breast cancer cases, respectively. The results showed that the major spectral differences between the two groups were related to the differences in protein conformation in serum samples. It can be concluded that FT-IR spectroscopy, together with multivariate data analysis, is able to discriminate between breast cancer and healthy serum samples.\n\nSynoptic Mid-IR Spectra ToO Novae\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHelton, L. Andrew; Woodward, Chick; Evans, Nye; Geballe, Tom; Spitzer Nova Team\n\n2007-02-01\n\nStars are the engines of energy production and chemical evolution in our Universe, depositing radiative and mechanical energy into their environments and enriching the ambient ISM with elements synthesized in their interiors and dust grains condensed in their atmospheres. Classical novae (CN) contribute to this cycle of chemical enrichment through explosive nucleosynthesis and the violent ejection of material dredged from the white dwarf progenitor and mixed with the accreted surface layers. We propose to obtain mid-IR spectra of a new galactic CN in outburst to investigate aspects of the CN phenomenon including the in situ formation and mineralogy of nova dust and the elemental abundances resulting from thermonuclear runaway. Synoptic, high S/N Michelle spectra permit: 1) determination of the grain size distribution and mineral composition of nova dust; 2) estimation of chemical abundances of nova ejecta from coronal and other emission line spectroscopy; and 3) measurement of the density and masses of the ejecta. This Gemini `Target of Opportunity' initiative (trigger K=5- 8 mag, assuming adequate PWFS guide stars exist) complements our extensive Spitzer, Chandra, Swift, XMM-Newton CN DDT/ToO programs.\n\nSugar and acid content of Citrus prediction modeling using FT-IR fingerprinting in combination with multivariate statistical analysis.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSong, Seung Yeob; Lee, Young Koung; Kim, In-Jung\n\n2016-01-01\n\nA high-throughput screening system for Citrus lines were established with higher sugar and acid contents using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy in combination with multivariate analysis. FT-IR spectra confirmed typical spectral differences between the frequency regions of 950-1100 cm(-1), 1300-1500 cm(-1), and 1500-1700 cm(-1). Principal component analysis (PCA) and subsequent partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were able to discriminate five Citrus lines into three separate clusters corresponding to their taxonomic relationships. The quantitative predictive modeling of sugar and acid contents from Citrus fruits was established using partial least square regression algorithms from FT-IR spectra. The regression coefficients (R(2)) between predicted values and estimated sugar and acid content values were 0.99. These results demonstrate that by using FT-IR spectra and applying quantitative prediction modeling to Citrus sugar and acid contents, excellent Citrus lines can be early detected with greater accuracy.

The acquired IR reflection spectra were further transformed into absorption spectra, employing the Kramers-Kronig transformation. Except for the cubic alums, the spectra strongly depend on the crystal face from which they were recorded; this is a consequence of anisotropy. Phonons of a given symmetry (E-species, in tetragonal/hexagonal and B-species, in monoclinic crystals may be resolved without using a polariser. The spectrum may be simplified in the case of an orthorhombic crystal, as well. The longitudinal-optical (LO and transversal-optical (TO mode frequencies were calculated in the case of optically isotropic and the simplified spectra of optically uniaxial crystals.\n\nSimulation of attenuated total reflection infrared absorbance spectra: applications to automotive clear coat forensic analysis.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLavine, Barry K; Fasasi, Ayuba; Mirjankar, Nikhil; Nishikida, Koichi; Campbell, Jay\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAttenuated total reflection (ATR) is a widely used sampling technique in infrared (IR) spectroscopy because minimal sample preparation is required. Since the penetration depth of the ATR analysis beam is quite shallow, the outer layers of a laminate or multilayered paint sample can be preferentially analyzed with the entire sample intact. For this reason, forensic laboratories are taking advantage of ATR to collect IR spectra of automotive paint systems that may consist of three or more layers. However, the IR spectrum of a paint sample obtained by ATR will exhibit distortions, e.g., band broadening and lower relative intensities at higher wavenumbers, compared with its transmission counterpart. This hinders library searching because most library spectra are measured in transmission mode. Furthermore, the angle of incidence for the internal reflection element, the refractive index of the clear coat, and surface contamination due to inorganic contaminants can profoundly influence the quality of the ATR spectrum obtained for automotive paints. A correction algorithm to allow ATR spectra to be searched using IR transmission spectra of the paint data query (PDQ) automotive database is presented. The proposed correction algorithm to convert transmission spectra from the PDQ library to ATR spectra is able to address distortion issues such as the relative intensities and broadening of the bands, and the introduction of wavelength shifts at lower frequencies, which prevent library searching of ATR spectra using archived IR transmission data.\n\nAn IR investigation of solid amorphous ethanol - Spectra, properties, and phase changes\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHudson, Reggie L.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nMid- and far-infrared spectra of condensed ethanol (CH3CH2OH) at 10-160 K are presented, with a special focus on amorphous ethanol, the form of greatest astrochemical interest, and with special attention given to changes at 155-160 K. Infrared spectra of amorphous and crystalline forms are shown. The refractive index at 670 nm of amorphous ethanol at 16 K is reported, along with three IR band strengths and a density. A comparison is made to recent work on the isoelectronic compound ethanethiol (CH3CH2SH), and several astrochemical applications are suggested for future study.\n\nFar IR spectra of Th(IV) halide complexes of some heterocyclic bases\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSrivastava, A.K.; Agarwal, R.K.; Srivastava, M.; Kapoor, V.; Srivastava, T.N.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nThe synthesis and IR spectra of Th(IV) perchlorato, nitrato and thiocyanato complexes of some heterocyclic bases have been reported. Halogens are common ligands in coordination chemistry forming coordinate bonds with metals readily. Metal halogen (M-X) stretching bands show a strong absorption in the far-IR region. Very little information is available on Th-X stretching frequencies. In the present communication, adducts of Th(IV) halide with certain nitrogen heterocyclic bases such as pyridine, Î±-picoline, 2-amino pyridine, 2:4-lutidine, 2:6-lutidine, quinoline, 2,2'-bipyridine and 1,10-phenanthroline were synthesised and characterised. Experimental details are given. Results are presented and discussed.

In view of the chemical functionalities involved, hydrogen bonding plays an important role in this polymerization reaction. Based on the 2DCOS and PCMW2D analysis, the sequence of hydrogen bonding changes accompanying the progress of polymerization and precipitation of solid polymer can be determined. Complementary to the kinetic data derived from the original variable-temperature spectra in a previous publication the results provide a more detailed picture of the investigated solution polymerization.\n\nAdding a dimension to the infrared spectra of interfaces: 2D SFG spectroscopy via mid-IR pulse shaping\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZanni, Martin\n\n2012-02-01\n\nSum-frequency generation spectroscopy provides an infrared spectrum of interfaces and thus has widespread use in the materials and chemical sciences. In this presentation, I will present our recent work in developing a 2D pulse sequence to generate 2D SFG spectra of interfaces, in analogy to 2D infrared spectra used to measure bulk species. To develop this spectroscopy, we have utilized many of the tricks-of-the-trade developed in the 2D IR and 2D Vis communities in the last decade, including mid-IR pulse shaping. With mid-IR pulse shaping, the 2D pulse sequence is manipulated by computer programming in the desired frequency resolution, rotating frame, and signal pathway. We believe that 2D SFG will become an important tool in the interfacial sciences in an analogous way that 2D IR is now being used in many disciplines.\n\nApplication of PCA and SIMCA statistical analysis of FT-IR spectra for the classification and identification of different slag types with environmental origin.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nStumpe, B; Engel, T; Steinweg, B; Marschner, B\n\n2012-04-03\n\nIn the past, different slag materials were often used for landscaping and construction purposes or simply dumped. Nowadays German environmental laws strictly control the use of slags, but there is still a remaining part of 35% which is uncontrolled dumped in landfills. Since some slags have high heavy metal contents and different slag types have typical chemical and physical properties that will influence the risk potential and other characteristics of the deposits, an identification of the slag types is needed. We developed a FT-IR-based statistical method to identify different slags classes. Slags samples were collected at different sites throughout various cities within the industrial Ruhr area. Then, spectra of 35 samples from four different slags classes, ladle furnace (LF), blast furnace (BF), oxygen furnace steel (OF), and zinc furnace slags (ZF), were determined in the mid-infrared region (4000-400 cm(-1)). The spectra data sets were subject to statistical classification methods for the separation of separate spectral data of different slag classes. Principal component analysis (PCA) models for each slag class were developed and further used for soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA). Precise classification of slag samples into four different slag classes were achieved using two different SIMCA models stepwise. At first, SIMCA 1 was used for classification of ZF as well as OF slags over the total spectral range. If no correct classification was found, then the spectrum was analyzed with SIMCA 2 at reduced wavenumbers for the classification of LF as well as BF spectra. As a result, we provide a time- and cost-efficient method based on FT-IR spectroscopy for processing and identifying large numbers of environmental slag samples.\n\nUsing Molecular Modeling in Teaching Group Theory Analysis of the Infrared Spectra of Organometallic Compounds\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWang, Lihua\n\n2012-01-01\n\nA new method is introduced for teaching group theory analysis of the infrared spectra of organometallic compounds using molecular modeling.

The object classes derived from these spectra and from an additional 24 spectra in the literature are compared with classifications based on Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS)/MSX (J, H, K, and 8 Î¼m) colors in order to test the 'JHK8' (Kastner et al.) classification scheme. The IRS spectra confirm the classifications of 22 of the 31 sources that can be classified under the JHK8 system. The spectroscopic classification of 12 objects that were unclassifiable in the JHK8 scheme allow us to characterize regions of the color-color diagrams that previously lacked spectroscopic verification, enabling refinements to the JHK8 classification system. The results of these new classifications are consistent with previous results concerning the identification of the most infrared-luminous objects in the LMC. In particular, while the IRS spectra reveal several new examples of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars with O-rich envelopes, such objects are still far outnumbered by carbon stars (C-rich AGB stars). We show that Spitzer IRAC/MIPS color-color diagrams provide improved discrimination between red supergiants and oxygen-rich and carbon-rich AGB stars relative to those based on 2MASS/MSX colors. These diagrams will enable the most luminous IR sources in Local Group galaxies to be classified with high confidence based on their Spitzer colors. Such characterizations of stellar populations will continue to be possible during Spitzer's warm mission through the use of IRAC [3.6]-[4.5] and 2MASS colors.\n\nMid-IR Spectra of Refractory Minerals Relevant to Comets\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJauhari, Shekeab\n\n2008-09-01\n\nOn 4 July 2005 the Spitzer Space Telescope obtained mid-IR ( 5-40 Âµm) spectra of the ejecta from the hypervelocity impact of the Deep Impact projectile with comet 9P/Tempel 1. Spectral modeling demonstrates that there are abundant minerals present in the ejecta including Ca/Fe/Mg-rich silicates, carbonates, phyllosilicates, water ice, amorphous carbon, and sulfides [1]. However, precise mineralogical identifications are hampered by the lack of comprehensive 5 - 40 Âµm spectral measurements of the emissivity for a broad compositional range of these materials. Here, we present our initial results for 2 - 50 Âµm transmission spectra and absorption constants for materials relevant to comets, including pyrrhotite, pyrite, and several phyllosilicate (clay) minerals. Measuring the transmission of materials over the full spectral range sensitive by Spitzer requires grinding the minerals into submicron powders and then mixing them with KBr (for the 1-25 um region) and polyethylene (16-50 um region) to form pellets. Transmission measurements of sub-micron sulfides are particularly difficult to obtain because the minerals oxidize rapidly upon grinding and subsequent handling unless special care is taken. A detailed description of our sample preparation and measurement technique will be provided to assist other researchers in their attempts to acquire similar spectra.

Because the method is rapid, nondestructive, and requires no sample preparation, it is ideal as a process analytical technique. Prior to implementation, the ATR FT-IR spectrum of the substrate layer pure component and the ATR FT-IR and real refractive index spectra of the surface layer pure component must be known. From these three input spectra a synthetic mid-infrared spectral matrix of surface layers 0 nm to 10,000 nm thick on substrate is created de novo. A minimum statistical distance match between a process sample's ATR FT-IR spectrum and the synthetic spectral matrix provides the thickness of that sample. We show that this method can be used to successfully estimate the thickness of polysulfobetaine surface modification, a hydrated polymeric surface layer covalently bonded onto a polyetherurethane substrate. A database of 1850 sample spectra was examined. Spectrochemical matrix-effect unknowns, such as the nonuniform and molecularly novel polysulfobetaine-polyetherurethane interface, were found to be minimal. A partial least squares regression analysis of the database spectra versus their thicknesses as calculated by the method described yielded an estimate of precision of Â±52 nm.\n\nEffect of second-sphere cation nature on the character of IR spectra of molybdeum(4, 5) cyanide complexes\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nZubritskaya, D.I.; Semenishin, D.I.; Vretsena, N.B.; Chernyak, B.I.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nThe effect of nature of second-sphere cations on IR spectra of molybdeum (4, 5) cyanide complexes is studied. It is found that the increase in the first ionization potential (radius decrease) brings about the increase in the frequency of valent variations Î½ (CN). This proves the possibility of formation of bridge bonds Mo-CN-M in the compounds (M-alkali, alkaline earth or rare earth metal, Cs, Y). The conclusion is made on a considerable effect of the nature of second-sphere cations and oxidation degree of complexing agent atoms on the nature of IR spectra of octacyanomolybdates (4, 5)\n\nIsolated Gramicidin Peptides Probed by IR Spectroscopy\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nRijs, A.

Proofs of the dimer T-like structure distortion in gaseous or matrix-isolated state, as a result of which the difference of the angles between uranyl axes from 90 deg is observed, are given.

Virtually all remotely sensed thermal IR pixels are mixtures of different materials and temperatures. As sensors improve and hyperspectral thermal IR remote sensing becomes more quantitative, the concept of homogeneous pixels becomes inadequate. The contributions of the constituents to the pixel spectral ground leaving radiance are weighted by their spectral emissivities and their temperature, or more correctly, temperature distributions, because real pixels are rarely thermally homogeneous. Planck's Law defines a relationship between temperature and radiance that is strongly wavelength dependent, even for blackbodies. Spectral ground leaving radiance (GLR) from mixed pixels is temperature and wavelength dependent and the relationship between observed radiance spectra from mixed pixels and library emissivity spectra of mixtures of 'pure' materials is indirect. A simple model of linear mixing of subpixel radiance as a function of material type, the temperature distribution of each material and the abundance of the material within a pixel is presented. The model indicates that, qualitatively and given normal environmental temperature variability, spectral features remain observable in mixtures as long as the material occupies more than roughly 10% of the pixel. Field measurements of known targets made on the ground and by an airborne sensor are presented here and serve as a reality check on the model. Target spectral GLR from mixtures as a function of temperature distribution and abundance within the pixel at day and night are presented and compare well qualitatively with model output.\n\nMatrix-isolation FT-IR spectra and theoretical study of dimethyl sulfate\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBorba, Ana; GÃ³mez-Zavaglia, Andrea; SimÃµes, Pedro N. N. L.; Fausto, Rui\n\n2005-05-01\n\nThe preferred conformations of dimethyl sulfate and their vibrational spectra were studied by matrix-isolation FT-IR spectroscopy and theoretical methods (DFT and MP2, with basis sets of different sizes, including the quadruple-zeta, aug-cc-pVQZ basis). Conformer GG (of C 2 symmetry and exhibiting O sbnd S sbnd O sbnd C dihedral angles of 74.3Â°) was found to be the most stable conformer in both the gaseous phase and isolated in argon. Upon annealing of the matrix, the less stable observed conformer (GT; with C 1 symmetry) quickly converts to the GG conformer, with the resulting species being embedded in a matrix-cage which corresponds to the most stable matrix-site for GG form. The highest energy TT conformer, which was assumed to be the most stable conformer in previous studies, is predicted by the calculations to have a relative energy of ca. 10 kJ mol -1 and was not observed in the spectra of the matrix-isolated compound.\n\nAttenuated total reflectance-FT-IR spectroscopy for gunshot residue analysis: potential for ammunition determination.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBueno, Justin; Sikirzhytski, Vitali; Lednev, Igor K\n\n2013-08-06\n\nThe ability to link a suspect to a particular shooting incident is a principal task for many forensic investigators. Here, we attempt to achieve this goal by analysis of gunshot residue (GSR) through the use of attenuated total reflectance (ATR) Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) combined with statistical analysis. The firearm discharge process is analogous to a complex chemical process. Therefore, the products of this process (GSR) will vary based upon numerous factors, including the specific combination of the firearm and ammunition which was discharged. Differentiation of FT-IR data, collected from GSR particles originating from three different firearm-ammunition combinations (0.38 in., 0.40 in., and 9 mm calibers), was achieved using projection to latent structures discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). The technique was cross (leave-one-out), both internally and externally, validated. External validation was achieved via assignment (caliber identification) of unknown FT-IR spectra from unknown GSR particles. The results demonstrate great potential for ATR-FT-IR spectroscopic analysis of GSR for forensic purposes.\n\nManifestation of Crystal Lattice Distortions in the IR Reflection Spectra of Abrasion-Treated ZnSe Ceramics\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSitnikova, V. E.; Dunaev, A. A.; Mamalimov, R. I.; Pakhomov, P. M.; Khizhnyak, S. D.; Chmel, A. E.\n\n2017-07-01\n\nThe Fourier IR reflection spectra of ZnSe ceramics prepared by hot pressing (HP), physical vapor deposition (PVD), and PVD combined with hot isostatic pressing (HIP) are presented. The optical constants of polished and dry-ground specimens were used for comparison. The grinding treatment simulated the erosion of the outer surface of optical elements made of zinc selenide under the influence of solid dust particles and deposits. In the polished specimens residual stresses showed up in the IR reflection spectra of the ZnSePVD and ZnSeHIP ceramics, which had well-defined orientation of grains, but were not present in the spectra of the ZnSeHIP ceramics as a result of mutual compensation of the stresses in the randomly oriented grains of the material. The stresses, which appeared as a shift of the absorption bands calculated by the Kramers-Kronig method, increased significantly after abrasive treatment of the specimens. For all the treated ceramics the intensity of the absorption bands resulting from the anharmonicity of the vibrations in the distorted crystal lattice increased by several times. The last effect also depends on the production prehistory of the ceramics.\n\nSolubility and IR studies of gamma-irradiated arabinoxylan\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nEbringerova, A.; Kacurakova, M.; Hromadkova, Z.; Pruzinec, J.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nThe structural and solubility changes of a water-insoluble arabinoxylan with a low degree of branching was studied after Î³-irradiation by IR spectroscopy and chemical analysis of the polysaccharide and its polymeric fractions. New functional groups like hydroperoxidic, carbonylic and endiolic ones were found after irradiation. The IR spectra shows that the structural changes involved by radiolytic treatment are reflected in the shape of the IR spectra of both polymeric fractions. The ratio of absorbance of the peaks at 1725 and 2920 cm -1 increased with radiation dose.

Vibrational frequencies were calculated for all the conformers of dopamine. Density functional theory was employed to carry out all the computations. The exchange correlation functional B3LYP and the basis set 6-31++G(d,p) were included in DFT calculation. The FTIR and FT-Raman spectra of dopamine hydrochloride were also recorded in the spectral region 400-4000 cm-1 and 50-4000 cm-1 respectively. The normal coordinate analysis was also performed to scale DFT calculated force constants and to calculate potential energy distributions. The detailed vibrational spectral analysis and the assignments of the bands, done on the best-fit basis comparison of the experimentally obtained and theoretically calculated IR and Raman spectra, match quite well indicating DFT calculations as very accurate source of normal mode assignments. The interaction of the most stable conformer of dopamine with HCl was also studied to know the effect of hydrogen bond on its geometry and dynamics. The stability of the dopamine in isolated and protonated forms arising from hyperconjugative interactions was also analyzed by natural bond orbital analysis.\n\nIR spectra and properties of solid acetone, an interstellar and cometary molecule\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHudson, Reggie L.; Gerakines, Perry A.; Ferrante, Robert F.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nMid-infrared spectra of amorphous and crystalline acetone are presented along with measurements of the refractive index and density for both forms of the compound. Infrared band strengths are reported for the first time for amorphous and crystalline acetone, along with IR optical constants. Vapor pressures and a sublimation enthalpy for crystalline acetone also are reported. Positions of 13C-labeled acetone are measured. Band strengths are compared to gas-phase values and to the results of a density-functional calculation.

Here, the predicted FT-IR, FT-Raman and UV-visible spectra by using theoretical B3LYP/6-31G* and 6-311++G** calculations show very good correlations with the corresponding experimental ones. The solvation energies were predicted by using both levels of calculations. The NBO analyses reveal the high stability of the salt by using the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory while the AIM studies evidence the ionic characteristics of the salt in both media. The strong blue colour observed on the K atom by using the molecular electrostatic potential mapped suggests that this region act as typical electrophilic site. The gap values have revealed that the salt in gas phase is more reactive than in solution, as was reported in the literature while, the F13&ctdot;H6 interaction together with the Ksbnd O bond observed by the studies of their charges could probably modulate the reactivities of this salt in aqueous solution. The force fields were computed with the SQMFF methodology and the Molvib program to perform the complete vibrational analysis. Then, the 39 vibration normal modes classified as 26 A'+ 13 Aâ³ were completely assigned and their force constants are also reported.\n\nIR spectral analysis for the diagnostics of crust earthquake precursors\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nUmarkhodgaev, R. M.; Liperovsky, V. A.; Mikhailin, V. V.; Meister, C.-V.; Naumov, D. Ju\n\n2012-04-01\n\nIn regions of future earthquakes, a few days before the seismic shock, the emanation of radon and hydrogen is being observed, which causes clouds of increased ionisation in the atmosphere. In the present work the possible diagnostics of these clouds using infrared (IR) spectroscopy is considered, which may be important and useful for the general geophysical system of earthquake prediction and the observation of industrial emissions of radioactive materials into the atmosphere. Some possible physical processes are analysed, which cause, under the condition of additional ionisation in a pre-breakdown electrical field, emissions in the IR interval. In doing so, the transparency region of the IR spectrum at wavelengths of 7-15 Î¼m is taken into account. This transparency region corresponds to spectral lines of small atmospheric constituents like CH4, CO2, N2O, NO2, NO, and O3. The possible intensities of the IR emissions observable in laboratories and in nature are estimated. The acceleration process of the electrons in the pre-breakdown electrical field before its adhesion to the molecules is analysed. The laboratory equipment for the investigation of the IR absorption spectrum is constructed for the cases of normal and decreased atmospheric pressures. The syntheses of ozone and nitrous oxides are performed in the barrier discharge. It is studied if the products of the syntheses may be used to model atmospheric processes where these components take part. Spectra of products of the syntheses in the wavelength region of 2-10 Î¼m are observed and analysed. A device is created for the syntheses and accumulation of nitrous oxides. Experiments to observe the IR-spectra of ozone and nitrous oxides during the syntheses and during the further evolution of these molecules are performed.

Biostatistics Center\n\n1991-04-01\n\nThe effect of source encapsulation on the energy spectra of {sup 192}Ir and {sup 137}Cs seed sources, both with stainless steel and with platinum encapsulation, was determined from results of Monte Carlo simulation. The fractional scatter dose around these sources has also been determined from Monte Carlo simulation. The platinum-encapsulated {sup 192}Ir source exhibited greater attenuation of the primary spectrum, as expected, and, consistent with this greater attenuation, exhibited more scattered radiation. Significantly less scatter was seen with the {sup 137}Cs source than with either {sup 192}Ir source, as is consistent with the higher-energy photons from {sup 137}Cs.

According to the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, sea buckthorn was originated from H. rhamnoides, which includes five subspecies distributed in China. Confusion and misidentification usually occurred due to their similar morphology, especially in dried and powdered forms. Additionally, these five subspecies have vital differences in quality and physiological efficacy. This paper focused on the quick classification and identification method of sea buckthorn berry powders from five H. rhamnoides subspecies using multi-step IR spectroscopy coupled with multivariate data analysis. The holistic chemical compositions revealed by the FT-IR spectra demonstrated that flavonoids, fatty acids and sugars were the main chemical components. Further, the differences in FT-IR spectra regarding their peaks, positions and intensities were used to identify H. rhamnoides subspecies samples. The discrimination was achieved using principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). The results showed that the combination of multi-step IR spectroscopy and chemometric analysis offered a simple, fast and reliable method for the classification and identification of the sea buckthorn berry powders from different H. rhamnoides subspecies.\n\nTemperature-dependent mid-IR absorption spectra of gaseous hydrocarbons\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKlingbeil, Adam E.; Jeffries, Jay B.; Hanson, Ronald K.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nQuantitative mid-IR absorption spectra (2500-3400 cm -1 ) for 12 pure hydrocarbon compounds are measured at temperatures ranging from 25 to 500 deg. C using an FTIR spectrometer. The hydrocarbons studied are n-pentane, n-heptane, n-dodecane, 2,2,4-trimethyl-pentane (iso-octane), 2-methyl-butane, 2-methyl-pentane, 2,4,4-trimethyl-1-pentene, 2-methyl-2-butene, propene, toluene, m-xylene, and ethylbenzene. Room-temperature measurements of neat hydrocarbon vapor were made with an instrument resolution of both 0.1 and 1 cm -1 (FWHM) to confirm that the high-resolution setting was required only to resolve the propene absorption spectrum while the spectra of the other hydrocarbons could be resolved with 1 cm -1 resolution. High-resolution (0.1 cm -1 ), room-temperature measurements of neat hydrocarbons were made at low pressure (â¼1 Torr, 133 Pa) and compared to measurements of hydrocarbon/N 2 mixtures at atmospheric pressure to verify that no pressure broadening could be observed over this pressure range. The temperature was varied between 25 and 500 o C for atmospheric-pressure measurements of hydrocarbon/N 2 mixtures (X hydrocarbon â¼0.06-1.5%) and it was found that the absorption cross section shows simple temperature-dependent behavior for a fixed wavelength over this temperature range. Comparisons with previous FTIR data over a limited temperature range and with high-resolution laser absorption data over a wide temperature range show good agreement\n\nRotational Isomers, Intramolecular Hydrogen Bond, and IR Spectra of o-Vinylphenol Homologs\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGlazunov, V.

L.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe Î½(OH) stretching-mode bands in solution IR spectra of five o-vinylphenol (o-VPh) homologs in the slightly polar solvents CCl4 and n-hexane were studied. Several rotamers with free OH groups were found in solutions of o-VPh and its methyl-substituted derivatives in n-hexane. The proportion of rotamers in o-VPh homologs with intramolecular hydrogen bonds (IHBs) O-H...Ï varied from 22 to 97% in the gas and cyclohexane according to B3LYP/cc-pVTZ calculations. The theoretically estimated effective enthalpies -ÎH of their IHBs varied in the range 0.20-2.24 kcal/mol.\n\nA new tridentate Schiff base Cu(II) complex: synthesis, experimental and theoretical studies on its crystal structure, FT-IR and UV-Visible spectra.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSaheb, Vahid; Sheikhshoaie, Iran; Setoodeh, Nasim; Rudbari, Hadi Amiri; Bruno, Giuseppe\n\n2013-06-01\n\nA new Cu(II) complex [Cu(L)(NCS)] has been synthesized, using 1-(N-salicylideneimino)-2-(N,N-methyl)-aminoethane as tridentate ONN donor Schiff base ligand (HL). The dark green crystals of the compound are used for single-crystal X-ray analysis and measuring Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) and UV-Visible spectra. Electronic structure calculations at the B3LYP and MP2 levels of theory are performed to optimize the molecular geometry and to calculate the UV-Visible and FT-IR spectra of the compound. Vibrational assignments and analysis of the fundamental modes of the compound are performed. Time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) method is used to calculate the electronic transitions of the complex. A scaling factor of 1.015 is obtained for vibrational frequencies computed at the B3LYP level using basis sets 6-311G(d,p). It is found that solvent has a profound effect on the electronic absorption spectrum. The UV-Visible spectrum of the complex recorded in DMSO and DMF solution can be correctly predicted by a model in which DMSO and DMF molecules are coordinated to the central Cu atom via their oxygen atoms.

Additionally, P3HT-films on silicon substrates have been prepared by spin coating only. The measured IR spectra of the spin coated films allowed for an elaboration of a detailed optical model for P3HT, which has been used to simulate IR reflection-absorption spectra on ITO and Pt substrates. Comparison of simulated spectra with measurements revealed no substrate influence on the IR spectra for the spincoated films. In case of spincoated P3HT-films on ITO-substrate, the obtained IR spectra correspond to simulation data very well up to 6000 wavenumbers. In the electropolymerized P3HT films we have identified residuals of the electrolyte ionic liquid, acting as dopand for P3HT. While IR spectra of the electropolymerized P3HT films on Pt substrate could be explained reasonably well as a superposition of chemically doped P3HT and the ionic electrolyte, the IR spectra of electropolymerized P3HT films on ITO substrates showed strongly deposition-time dependent deviations. These were most likely related to varying properties of the ITO surface between reference and sample measurement due to an interaction of ITO and the electrolyte at the film-substrate interface.\n\nStudies on molecular structure, vibrational spectra and molecular docking analysis of 3-Methyl-1,4-dioxo-1,4-dihydronaphthalen-2-yl 4-aminobenzoate\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSuresh, D.

The equilibrium geometry, harmonic vibrational wave numbers, various bonding features have been computed using density functional method. The calculated molecular geometry has been compared with experimental data. The detailed interpretation of the vibrational spectra has been carried out by using VEDA program. The hyper-conjugative interactions and charge delocalization have been analyzed using natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis. The simulated FT-IR and FT-Raman spectra satisfactorily coincide with the experimental spectra. The PES and charge analysis have been made.

An identification of the newest penem analogs based on their separation from related substances was achieved after the application of first derivative of direct spectra in ultraviolet which permitted elimination of overlapping effects. A combination of experimental and theoretical studies was performed for analyzing the structure and vibrational spectra (FT-IR and Raman spectra) of doripenem, biapenem and faropenem. The calculations were conducted using the density functional theory with the B3LYP hybrid functional and 6-31G(d,p) basis set. The confirmation of the applicability of the DFT methodology for interpretation of vibrational IR and Raman spectra of the newest penem analogs contributed to determination of changes of vibrations in the area of the most labile bonds. By employing the theoretical approach it was possible to eliminate necessity of using reference standards which - considering the instability of penem analogs - require that correction coefficients are factored in.

The ages of these stars range from 11 to 17 Myr. We fit the infrared excesses observed in these sources by Spitzer IRS and the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS) to simple dust models according to Mie theory. We find that nearly all of the objects in our study can be fit by one or two belts of dust. Dust around lower mass stars appears to be closer in than around higher mass stars, particularly for the warm dust component in the two-belt systems, suggesting a mass-dependent evolution of debris disks around young stars. For those objects with stellar companions, all dust distances are consistent with truncation of the debris disk by the binary companion. The gaps between several of the two-belt systems can place limits on the planets that might lie between the belts, potentially constraining the mass and locations of planets that may be forming around these stars.\n\nGas phase UV and IR absorption spectra of CxF2x+1CHO (x=1-4)\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nHashikawa, Y; Kawasaki, M; Waterland, RL\n\n2004-01-01\n\nThe UV and IR spectra of CxF2x+1 CHO (x = 1-4) were investigated using computational and experimental techniques.

These fingerprints can be used for the identification and discrimination of similar liquor products. The comparison of their conventional IR spectra, as the first step of identification, shows that the primary difference in Sauce liquor is the intensity of characteristic peaks at 1592 and 1225 cm -1. The comparison of the second derivative IR spectra, as the second step of identification, shows that the characteristic absorption in 1400-1800 cm -1 is substantially different. The comparison of 2D-IR correlation spectra, as the third and final step of identification, can discriminate the liquors from another direction. Furthermore, the method was successfully applied to the discrimination of a counterfeit Moutai from the genuine Sauce liquor. The success of the three-step IR macro-fingerprint identification to provide a rapid and effective method for the identification of Chinese liquor suggests the potential extension of this technique to the identification and discrimination of other wine and spirits, as well.\n\nRegioselective aromatic substitution reactions of cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes: synthesis and photochemical properties of substituted Ir(III) complexes that exhibit blue, green, and red color luminescence emission.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAoki, Shin; Matsuo, Yasuki; Ogura, Shiori; Ohwada, Hiroki; Hisamatsu, Yosuke; Moromizato, Shinsuke; Shiro, Motoo; Kitamura, Masanori\n\n2011-02-07\n\nIn this manuscript, the regioselective halogenation, nitration, formylation, and acylation of Ir(tpy)(3) and Ir(ppy)(3) (tpy = 2-(4'-tolyl)pyridine and ppy = 2-phenylpyridine) and the subsequent conversions are described. During attempted bromination of the three methyl groups in fac-Ir(tpy)(3) using N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) and benzoyl peroxide (BPO), three protons at the 5'-position (p-position with respect to the C-Ir bond) of phenyl rings in tpy units were substituted by Br, as confirmed by (1)H NMR spectra, mass spectra, and X-ray crystal structure analysis. It is suggested that such substitution reactions of Ir complexes proceed via an ionic mechanism rather than a radical mechanism. UV-vis and luminescence spectra of the substituted Ir(III) complexes are reported. The introduction of electron-withdrawing groups such as CN and CHO groups at the 5'-position of tpy induces a blue shift of luminescence emission to about 480 nm, and the introduction of electron-donating groups such as an amino group results in a red shift to about 600 nm. A reversible change of emission for the 5'-amino derivative of Ir(tpy)(3), Ir(atpy)(3), between red and green occurs upon protonation and deprotonation.\n\nCompletely automated open-path FT-IR spectrometry.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGriffiths, Peter R; Shao, Limin; Leytem, April B\n\n2009-01-01\n\nAtmospheric analysis by open-path Fourier-transform infrared (OP/FT-IR) spectrometry has been possible for over two decades but has not been widely used because of the limitations of the software of commercial instruments. In this paper, we describe the current state-of-the-art of the hardware and software that constitutes a contemporary OP/FT-IR spectrometer. We then describe advances that have been made in our laboratory that have enabled many of the limitations of this type of instrument to be overcome. These include not having to acquire a single-beam background spectrum that compensates for absorption features in the spectra of atmospheric water vapor and carbon dioxide. Instead, an easily measured \"short path-length\" background spectrum is used for calculation of each absorbance spectrum that is measured over a long path-length. To accomplish this goal, the algorithm used to calculate the concentrations of trace atmospheric molecules was changed from classical least-squares regression (CLS) to partial least-squares regression (PLS). For calibration, OP/FT-IR spectra are measured in pristine air over a wide variety of path-lengths, temperatures, and humidities, ratioed against a short-path background, and converted to absorbance; the reference spectrum of each analyte is then multiplied by randomly selected coefficients and added to these background spectra. Automatic baseline correction for small molecules with resolved rotational fine structure, such as ammonia and methane, is effected using wavelet transforms. A novel method of correcting for the effect of the nonlinear response of mercury cadmium telluride detectors is also incorporated. Finally, target factor analysis may be used to detect the onset of a given pollutant when its concentration exceeds a certain threshold. In this way, the concentration of atmospheric species has been obtained from OP/FT-IR spectra measured at intervals of 1 min over a period of many hours with no operator intervention.\n\nFT-IR microscopical analysis with synchrotron radiation: The microscope optics and system performance\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nReffner, J.A.; Martoglio, P.A.; Williams, G.P.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nWhen a Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) microspectrometer was first interfaced with the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) in September 1993, there was an instant realization that the performance at the diffraction limit had increased 40-100 times.

It is shown that the main structural components of their anion network are phosphate chains consisting of PO 4 tetrahedrons and tungstate chains consisting of WO 4 tetrahedrons and of WO 6 octahedrons. These chains are connected by P-O-W bridges into three-dimentional tungstophosphate network, where the ratio of phosphate and tungstate structural units and their polymerization degree change without limits depending on the glass composition.

The liquors at top, middle and bottom of fermentation cellar, possessed the characteristic peaks at 1731 cm -1, 1733 cm -1 and 1602 cm -1, respectively. In the 2D correlation infrared spectra, the differences were amplified. A strong auto-peak at 1725 cm -1 showed in the 2D spectra of the Top Liquor, which indicated that the liquor might contain some ester compounds. Different from Top Liquor, three auto-peaks at 1695, 1590 and 1480 cm -1 were identified in 2D spectra of Middle Liquor, which were the characteristic absorption of acid, lactate. In 2D spectra of Bottom Liquor, two auto-peaks at 1570 and 1485 cm -1 indicated that lactate was the major component. As a result, FT-IR and 2D-IR correlation spectra technology provided a rapid and effective method for the quality analysis of the Sauce liquor.\n\nVibrational spectra and normal co-ordinate analysis of 2-aminopyridine and 2-amino picoline.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJose, Sujin P; Mohan, S\n\n2006-05-01\n\nThe Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and Raman (FT-R) spectra of 2-aminopyridine and 2-amino picoline were recorded and the observed frequencies were assigned to various modes of vibration in terms of fundamentals by assuming Cs point group symmetry.

In this study, a rapid method using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopies coupled with data fusion was established for the discrimination of Boletus mushrooms from seven different geographical origins with pattern recognition method. Initially, the spectra of 332 mushroom samples obtained from the two spectroscopic techniques were analyzed individually and then the classification performance based on data fusion strategy was investigated. Meanwhile, the latent variables (LVs) of FT-IR and UV spectra were extracted by partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and two datasets were concatenated into a new matrix for data fusion. Then, the fusion matrix was further analyzed by support vector machine (SVM). Compared with single spectroscopic technique, data fusion strategy can improve the classification performance effectively. In particular, the accuracy of correct classification of SVM model in training and test sets were 99.10% and 100.00%, respectively. The results demonstrated that data fusion of FT-IR and UV spectra can provide higher synergic effect for the discrimination of different geographical origins of Boletus mushrooms, which may be benefit for further authentication and quality assessment of edible mushrooms.\n\nFT-Raman, FT-IR spectra and total energy distribution of 3-pentyl-2,6-diphenylpiperidin-4-one: DFT method.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSubashchandrabose, S; Saleem, H; Erdogdu, Y; Rajarajan, G; Thanikachalam, V\n\n2011-11-01\n\nFT-Raman and FT-IR spectra were recorded for 3-pentyl-2,6-diphenylpiperidin-4-one (PDPO) sample in solid state. The equilibrium geometries, harmonic vibrational frequencies, infrared and the Raman scattering intensities were computed using DFT/6-31G(d,p) level. Results obtained at this level of theory were used for a detailed interpretation of the infrared and Raman spectra, based on the total energy distribution (TED) of the normal modes. Molecular parameters such as bond lengths, bond angles and dihedral angles were calculated and compared with X-ray diffraction data. This comparison was good agreement. The intra-molecular charge transfer was calculated by means of natural bond orbital analysis (NBO). Hyperconjugative interaction energy was more during the Ï-Ï* transition. Energy gap of the molecule was found using HOMO and LUMO calculation, hence the less band gap, which seems to be more stable. Atomic charges of the carbon, nitrogen and oxygen were calculated using same level of calculation. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Ab-initio HF and DFT (LSDA/B3LYP/B3PW91) calculations have been performed giving energies, optimized structures, harmonic vibrational frequencies, IR intensities and Raman activities. Complete vibrational assignments on the observed spectra are made with vibrational frequencies obtained by HF and DFT (LSDA/B3LYP/B3PW91) at 6-31G(d,p) and 6-311G(d,p) basis sets. The results of the calculations have been used to simulate IR and Raman spectra for the molecule that showed good agreement with the observed spectra. The potential energy distribution (PED) corresponding to each of the observed frequencies are calculated which confirms the reliability and precision of the assignment and analysis of the vibrational fundamentals modes. The oscillation of vibrational frequencies of butadiene due to the couple of methyl group is also discussed. A study on the electronic properties such as HOMO and LUMO energies, were performed by time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) approach. The calculated HOMO and LUMO energies show that charge transfer occurs within the molecule. The thermodynamic properties of the title compound at different temperatures reveal the correlations between standard heat capacities (C) standard entropies (S), and standard enthalpy changes (H).

V.; Minaeva, V. A.; Minaev, B. F.; Grigoras, M.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nWe study the features of the electronic structure and the IR, UV, and visible spectra of a series of triphenylamines substituted with phenylethynyl groups. The analysis is performed at the level of the density functional theory (DFT) and its nonstationary version in comparison with the experimental data of IR and electron spectroscopy. It is shown that, in the excited state, there is a change in the alternation of single, double, and triple bonds in accordance with the character of bonding and antibonding in the lowest vacant molecular orbital. The gradual introduction of additional phenylethynyl groups does not cause frequency shifts in the IR spectra of the molecules under study, but significantly affects the intensity of the corresponding IR bands. A similar effect is also observed in the electronic-absorption spectra of these compounds. This can be used for optical tuning of triphenylamines as promising materials for organic light-emitting diodes and solar cells.\n\nEffect of low-temperature argon matrices on IR spectra and structure of flexible N-acetylglycine molecules\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nStepan'yan, S.G.; Ivanov, A.Yu.; Adamowicz, L.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe influence of the matrix environment on structure and IR spectra of the N-acetylglycine conformers was studied. Based on the FTIR spectra of N-acetyl-glycine isolated in low temperature argon matrices we determined its conformational composition. The spectra bands of main and two minor conformers of N-acetylglycine were identified in the FTIR spectra. The structure of the observed conformers was stabilized by different intramolecular hydrogen bonds. The Gibbs free energies of the conformers (CCSD(T)/CBS method) were performed and population of the con-formers at 360 K were determined. They were 85.3% for the main conformer and 9.6 and 5.1% for the mi-nor N-acetylglycine conformers. We also determined size and shape of the cavities which were formed by embedding of the N-acetylglycine conformers in argon matrices during deposition. It was found that for the planar main conformer the most energetically preferred cavity was formed by substituting of 7 argon atoms. At the same time, bulky minor conformers were embedded in a cavity formed by substituting of 8 argon atoms. Complexation energies as well as the deformation energies of the argon crystal and conformers of N-acetylglycine were calculated. Also we determined values of the matrix shifts of vibrational frequencies of N-acetylglycine conformers.\n\nLO-TO splittings, effective charges and interactions in electro-optic meta-nitroaniline crystal as studied by polarized IR reflection and transmission spectra\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSzostak, M. M.; Le CalvÃ©, N.; Romain, F.; Pasquier, B.\n\n1994-10-01\n\nThe polarized IR reflection spectra of the meta-nitroaniline ( m-NA) single crystal along the a, b and c crystallographic axes as well as the b and c polarized transmission spectra have been measured in the 100-400 cm -1 region. The LO-TO splitting values have been calculated from the reflection spectra by fitting them with the four parameter dielectric function. The dipole moment derivatives, relevant to dynamic effective charges, of the vibrations have also been calculated and used to check the applicability of the oriented gas model (OGM) to reflection spectra. The discrepancies from the OGM have been discussed in terms of vibronic couplings, weak hydrogen bondings (HB) and intramolecular charge transfer.\n\nTheoretical study of IR and photoelectron spectra of small gallium-arsenide clusters\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nPouchan, Claude; Marchal, RÃ©mi; Hayashi, Shinsuke [UniversitÃ© de Pau et des Pays de l' Adour, IPREM/ECP, UMR CNRS 5254 (France)\n\n2015-01-22\n\nRelative stabilities of small Ga{sub n}As{sub m} clusters, as well as their structural electronic and vibrational properties, were computed and analysed using a CCSD(T) reference method since experimental data in this area are sparse or unknown. With the aim of investigating larger clusters, we explored several DFT functionals and basis sets able to mimic the reliable CCSD(T) approach. Among them, the PBE0/SBKJC+sp,d appears as the most efficient to describe the structural and vibrational properties since average differences of about 0.042Ã and 5.1cm{sup â1} were obtained for bond lengths and fundamental vibrational frequencies, respectively for the first small clusters [1] of the series found from our GSAM method [2]. As further test, this model is used in order to investigate and revisit an experimental IR spectrum of Ga{sub n}As{sub m} mixture previously published by Li et al. [3]. More complicated is the difficulty which arises in the electronic description due to the presence of numerous low lying electronic states nearly degenerated to correctly describe the electronic structure. The case of Ga{sub 2}As will be discussed and the photoelectron spectra of the Ga{sub 2}As anion reanalyzed on the ground of our calculations [4] comparatively to the experimental spectra obtained by Neumark and co-workers [5].\n\nStarNet: An application of deep learning in the analysis of stellar spectra\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKielty, Collin; Bialek, Spencer; Fabbro, Sebastien; Venn, Kim; O'Briain, Teaghan; Jahandar, Farbod; Monty, Stephanie\n\n2018-06-01\n\nIn an era when spectroscopic surveys are capable of collecting spectra for hundreds of thousands of stars, fast and efficient analysis methods are required to maximize scientific impact. These surveys provide a homogeneous database of stellar spectra that are ideal for machine learning applications. In this poster, we present StarNet: a convolutional neural network model applied to the analysis of both SDSS-III APOGEE DR13 and synthetic stellar spectra. When trained on synthetic spectra alone, the calculated stellar parameters (temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity) are of excellent precision and accuracy for both APOGEE data and synthetic data, over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios. While StarNet was developed using the APOGEE observed spectra and corresponding ASSeT synthetic grid, we suggest that this technique is applicable to other spectral resolutions, spectral surveys, and wavelength regimes. As a demonstration of this, we present a StarNet model trained on lower resolution, R=6000, IR synthetic spectra, describing the spectra delivered by Gemini/NIFS and the forthcoming Gemini/GIRMOS instrument (PI Sivanandam, UToronto). Preliminary results suggest that the stellar parameters determined from this low resolution StarNet model are comparable in precision to the high-resolution APOGEE results. The success of StarNet at lower resolution can be attributed to (1) a large training set of synthetic spectra (N ~200,000) with a priori stellar labels, and (2) the use of the entire spectrum in the solution rather than a few weighted windows, which are common methods in other spectral analysis tools (e.g. FERRE or The Cannon). Remaining challenges in our StarNet applications include rectification, continuum normalization, and wavelength coverage. Solutions to these problems could be used to guide decisions made in the development of future spectrographs, spectroscopic surveys, and data reduction pipelines, such as for the future MSE.\n\nExperimental and theoretical studies on IR, Raman, and UV-Vis spectra of quinoline-7-carboxaldehyde.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKumru, M; KÃ¼Ã§Ã¼k, V; Kocademir, M; Alfanda, H M; Altun, A; SarÄ±, L\n\n2015-01-05\n\nSpectroscopic properties of quinoline-7-carboxaldehyde (Q7C) have been studied in detail both experimentally and theoretically. The FT-IR (4000-50 cm(-1)), FT-Raman (4000-50 cm(-1)), dispersive-Raman (3500-50 cm(-1)), and UV-Vis (200-400 nm) spectra of Q7C were recorded at room temperature (25 Â°C). Geometry parameters, potential energy surface about CCH(O) bond, harmonic vibrational frequencies, IR and Raman intensities, UV-Vis spectrum, and thermodynamic characteristics (at 298.15K) of Q7C were computed at Hartree-Fock (HF) and density functional B3LYP levels employing the 6-311++G(d,p) basis s"
