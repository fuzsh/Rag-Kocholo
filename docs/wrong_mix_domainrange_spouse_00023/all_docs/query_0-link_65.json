Here, we present the long-term outcome of the trial with particular focus on the impact of genomic risk factors, and we provide a retrospective comparison with patients from the fludarabine-cyclophosphamide-rituximab (FCR) arm of the German CLL Study Group (GCLLSG) CLL8 trial. After a median observation time of 8.7 years (0.3-12.3 years), median progression-free survival (PFS), time to retreatment, and overall survival (OS) of 169 evaluable patients, including 38 patients who did not proceed to autoSCT, was 5.7, 7.3, and 11.3 years, respectively. PFS and OS were significantly reduced in the presence of 17p- and of an unfavorable immunoglobulin heavy variable chain mutational status, but not of 11q-. Five-year nonrelapse mortality was 6.5%. When 110 CLL3 patients were compared with 126 matched patients from the FCR arm of the CLL8 trial, 4-year time to retreatment (75% vs 77%) and OS (86% vs 90%) was similar despite a significant benefit for autoSCT in terms of PFS. In summary, early treatment intensification including autoSCT can provide very effective disease control in poor-risk CLL, although its clinical benefit in the FCR era remains uncertain. The trial has been registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00275015.\n\nGIMEMA CLL0809 Study (BendOfa)\n\nClinicalTrials.gov\n\n2015-01-29\n\nPatients With CLL Relapsing After an Initial Response (CR, PR â¥ 6 Months) Following no More Than Two Prior Treatment Lines; or; Patients With CLL Refractory (SD, PD or CR/PR < 6 Months) Following no More Than Two Prior Treatment Lines\n\nGenomic characterization of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in radiation-exposed Chornobyl cleanup workers.\n\nPubMed\n\nOjha, Juhi; Dyagil, Iryna; Finch, Stuart C; Reiss, Robert F; de Smith, Adam J; Gonseth, Semira; Zhou, Mi; Hansen, Helen M; Sherborne, Amy L; Nakamura, Jean; Bracci, Paige M; Gudzenko, Nataliya; Hatch, Maureen; Babkina, Nataliya; Little, Mark P; Chumak, Vadim V; Walsh, Kyle M; Bazyka, Dimitry; Wiemels, Joseph L; Zablotska, Lydia B\n\n2018-05-02\n\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) was the predominant leukemia in a recent study of Chornobyl cleanup workers from Ukraine exposed to radiation (UR-CLL). Radiation risks of CLL significantly increased with increasing bone marrow radiation doses. Current analysis aimed to clarify whether the increased risks were due to radiation or to genetic mutations in the Ukrainian population. A detailed characterization of the genomic landscape was performed in a unique sample of 16 UR-CLL patients and age- and sex-matched unexposed general population Ukrainian-CLL (UN-CLL) and Western-CLL (W-CLL) patients (nâ=â28 and 100, respectively). Mutations in telomere-maintenance pathway genes POT1 and ATM were more frequent in UR-CLL compared to UN-CLL and W-CLL (bothÂ pâ<â0.05). No significant enrichment in copy-number abnormalities at del13q14, del11q, del17p or trisomy12 was identified in UR-CLL compared to other groups. Type of work performed in the Chornobyl zone, age at exposure and at diagnosis, calendar time, and Rai stage were significant predictors of total genetic lesions (allÂ pâ<â0.05). Tumor telomere length was significantly longer in UR-CLL than in UN-CLL (pâ=â0.009) and was associated with the POT1 mutation and survival. No significant enrichment in copy-number abnormalities at CLL-associated genes was identified in UR-CLL compared to other groups. The novel associations between radiation exposure, telomere maintenance and CLL prognosis identified in this unique case series provide suggestive, though limited data and merit further investigation.\n\nMinimal Residual Disease Assessment Improves Prediction of Outcome in Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) Who Achieve Partial Response: Comprehensive Analysis of Two Phase III Studies of the German CLL Study Group.\n\nPubMed\n\nKovacs, Gabor; Robrecht, Sandra; Fink, Anna Maria; Bahlo, Jasmin; Cramer, Paula; von Tresckow, Julia; Maurer, Christian; Langerbeins, Petra; Fingerle-Rowson, GÃ¼nter; Ritgen, Matthias; Kneba, Michael; DÃ¶hner, Hartmut; Stilgenbauer, Stephan; Klapper, Wolfram; Wendtner, Clemens-Martin; Fischer, Kirsten; Hallek, Michael; Eichhorst, Barbara; BÃ¶ttcher, Sebastian\n\n2016-11-01\n\nPurpose To determine the value of minimal residual disease (MRD) assessments, together with the evaluation of clinical response in chronic lymphocytic leukemia according to the 2008 International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia criteria. Patients and Methods Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival of 554 patients from two randomized trials of the German CLL Study Group (CLL8: fludarabine and cyclophosphamide [FC] v FC plus rituximab; CLL10: FC plus rituximab v bendamustine plus rituximab) were analyzed according to MRD assessed in peripheral blood at a threshold of 10 -4 and clinical response. The prognostic value of different parameters defining a partial response (PR) was further investigated. Results Patients with MRD-negative complete remission (CR), MRD-negative PR, MRD-positive CR, and MRD-positive PR experienced a median PFS from a landmark at end of treatment of 61 months, 54 months, 35 months, and 21 months, respectively. PFS did not differ significantly between MRD-negative CR and MRD-negative PR; however, PFS was longer for MRD-negative PR than for MRD-positive CR ( P = .048) and for MRD-positive CR compared with MRD-positive PR ( P = .002). Compared with MRD-negative CR, only patients with MRD-positive PR had a significantly shorter overall survival (not reached v 72 months; P = .001), whereas there was no detectable difference for patients with MRD-negative PR or MRD-positive CR ( P = 0.612 and P = 0.853, respectively). Patients with MRD-negative PR who presented with residual splenomegaly had only a similar PFS (63 months) compared with patients with MRD-negative CR (61 months; P = .354), whereas patients with MRD-negative PR with lymphadenopathy showed a shorter PFS (31 months; P < .001). Conclusion MRD quantification allows for improved PFS prediction in both patients who achive PR and CR, which thus supports its application in all responders. In contrast to residual lymphadenopathy, persisting splenomegaly does not impact\n\nStimulation of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) Cells with CpG Oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) Gives Consistent Karyotypic Results among Laboratories: a CLL Research Consortium (CRC)h Study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHeerema, Nyla A.; Byrd, John C.; Cin, Paola Dal; Dellâ Aquila, Marie L.; Koduru, Prasad; Aviram, Ayala; Smoley, Stephanie; Rassenti, Laura Z.; Greaves, Andrew W.; Brown, Jennifer R.; Rai, Kanti R.; Kipps, Thomas J.; Kay, Neil E.; van Dyke, Daniel\n\n2010-01-01\n\nCytogenetic abnormalities in CLL are important prognostic indicators. Historically, only interphase cytogenetics was clinically useful in CLL because traditional mitogens are not effective mitotic stimulants. Recently, CpG-oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) stimulation has shown effectiveness in CLL. The CLL Research Consortium (CRC) tested the effectiveness and reproducibility of CpG-ODN stimulation to detect chromosomally abnormal clones by five laboratories. More clonal abnormalities were observed after culture of CLL cells with CpG-ODN than with pokeweed mitogen (PWM)+12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorobol-13-acetate (TPA). All clonal abnormalities in PWM+TPA cultures were observed in CpG-ODN cultures, whereas CpG-ODN identified some clones not found by PWM+TPA. CpG-ODN stimulation of one normal control and 12 CLL samples showed that excepting clones of del(13q) in low frequencies and one translocation, results in all five laboratories were consistent, and all abnormalities were concordant with FISH. Thus, abnormal clones in CLL are more readily detected with CpG-ODN stimulation than with traditional B-cell mitogens. After CpG-ODN stimulation, abnormalities were reproducible among cytogenetic laboratories. CpG-ODN did not appear to induce aberrations in cell culture and enhanced detection of abnormalities and complexity in CLL. Since karyotypic complexity is prognostic and is not detectable by standard FISH analyses, stimulation with CpG-ODN is useful to identify this additional prognostic factor in CLL.

To test this hypothesis, we utilized a long-term primary culture system from bone biopsies that reliably generates a mesenchymal stem cell (MSC). Co-culture of MSC with CLL B-cells protected the latter from both spontaneous apoptosis and drug-induced apoptosis. The CD38 expression in previously CD38 positive CLL B-cells was up-regulated with MSC co-culture. Upregulation of CD71, CD25, CD69 and CD70 in CLL B-cells was found in the co-culture. CD71 upregulation was more significantly associated with high-risk CLL, implicating CD71 regulation in the microenvironment predicting disease progression. In MSC, rapid ERK and AKT phosphorylation (within 30 min) were detected when CLL B-cells and MSC were separated by transwell; indicating that activation of MSC was mediated by soluble factors. These findings support a bi-directional activation between bone marrow stromal cells and CLL B-cells.\n\nIsolation of a novel chronic lymphocytic leukemic (CLL) cell line and development of an in vivo mouse model of CLL.\n\nPubMed\n\nKellner, Joshua; Wierda, William; Shpall, Elizabeth; Keating, Michael; McNiece, Ian\n\n2016-01-01\n\nLeukemic cell lines have become important tools for studies of disease providing a monoclonal cell population that can be extensively expanded in vitro while preserving leukemic cellular characteristics. However, studies of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have been impeded in part by the lack of continuous human cell lines. CLL cells have a high spontaneous apoptosis rate in vitro and exhibit minimal proliferation in xenograft models. Therefore, there is a need for development of primary CLL cell lines and we describe the isolation of such a line from the bone marrow of a CLL patient (17p deletion and TP53 mutation) which has been in long term culture for more than 12 months with continuous proliferation. The CLL cell line (termed MDA-BM5) which was generated in vitro with continuous co-culture on autologous stromal cells is CD19+CD5+ and shows an identical pattern of somatic hypermutation as determined in the patient's bone marrow (BM), confirming the origin of the cells from the original CLL clone. MDA-BM5 cells were readily transplantable in NOD/SCID gamma null mice (NSG) with disease developing in the BM, liver and spleen. BM cells from quaternary serial transplantation in NSG mice demonstrated the presence of CD19+CD5+ cells with Ig restricted to lambda which is consistent with the original patient cells. These studies describe a new CLL cell line from a patient with del(17p) that provides a unique model for in vitro and in vivo studies. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Although initial chemotherapy response rates are high, patients invariably relapse and subsequently develop resistance to chemotherapy. For the moment, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) remains the only potentially curative treatment for patients with CLL, but it is associated with high rates of treatment-related mortality. Immune-based treatment strategies to augment the cytotoxic potential of T cells offer exciting new treatment options for patients with CLL, and provide a unique and powerful spectrum of tools distinct from traditional chemotherapy. Among the most novel and promising of these approaches are chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-based cell therapies that combine advances in genetic engineering and adoptive immunotherapy.\n\nRestricted T cell receptor repertoire in CLL-like monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis and early stage CLL.\n\nPubMed\n\nBlanco, Gonzalo; Vardi, Anna; Puiggros, Anna; GÃ³mez-LlonÃ­n, Andrea; Muro, Manuel; RodrÃ­guez-Rivera, MarÃ­a; Stalika, Evangelia; Abella, Eugenia; Gimeno, Eva; LÃ³pez-SÃ¡nchez, Manuela; SenÃ­n, Alicia; Calvo, Xavier; Abrisqueta, Pau; Bosch, Francesc; Ferrer, Ana; Stamatopoulos, Kostas; Espinet, Blanca\n\n2018-01-01\n\nAnalysis of the T cell receptor (TR) repertoire of chronic lymphocytic leukemia-like monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis (CLL-like MBL) and early stage CLL is relevant for understanding the dynamic interaction of expanded B cell clones with bystander T cells. Here we profiled the T cell receptor Î² chain (TRB) repertoire of the CD4 + and CD8 + T cell fractions from 16 CLL-like MBL and 13 untreated, Binet stage A/Rai stage 0 CLL patients using subcloning analysis followed by Sanger sequencing. The T cell subpopulations of both MBL and early stage CLL harbored restricted TRB gene repertoire, with CD4 + T cell clonal expansions whose frequency followed the numerical increase of clonal B cells. Longitudinal analysis in MBL cases revealed clonal persistence, alluding to persistent antigen stimulation. In addition, the identification of shared clonotypes among different MBL/early stage CLL cases pointed towards selection of the T cell clones by common antigenic elements. T cell clonotypes previously described in viral infections and immune disorders were also detected. Altogether, our findings evidence that antigen-mediated TR restriction occurs early in clonal evolution leading to CLL and may further increase together with B cell clonal expansion, possibly suggesting that the T cell selecting antigens are tumor-related.\n\nBendamustine added to allogeneic conditioning improves long-term outcomes in patients with CLL.\n\nPubMed\n\nKhouri, I F; Sui, D; Jabbour, E J; Samuels, B I; Turturro, F; Alatrash, G; Anderlini, P; Ahmed, S; Oran, B; Ciurea, S O; Marin, D; Olson, A; Patel, K K; Popat, U R; Ledesma, C; Kadia, T M; Ferrajoli, A; Burger, J A; Jorgensen, J L; Medeiros, L J; Bassett, R L; Gulbis, A M\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBendamustine has shown a favorable safety profile when included in chemotherapy regimens for several types of lymphoma, including CLL. This study investigated the long-term effect of adding bendamustine to a conditioning regimen on survival, rate of engraftment, immune recovery and GvHD after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) in CLL patients. These outcomes were compared with the fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR) conditioning regimen. We reviewed the data for 89 CLL patients treated on three trials at our institution. Twenty-six (29%) patients received bendamustine, fludarabine and rituximab (BFR) and 63 (71%) received FCR. Patient characteristics were similar in both groups. Ten (38%) BFR-treated patients vs only two (3%) FCR-treated patients did not experience severe neutropenia (P=<0.001). The 3-year overall survival estimates for the BFR and FCR groups were 82 and 51% (P=0.03), and the 3-year PFS estimates were 63% and 27% (P=0.001), respectively. The 2-year treatment-related mortality was 8 and 23% and the incidence of grade 3 or 4 GvHD was 4% and 10%, respectively. This study is the first to report that addition of bendamustine to alloSCT conditioning for CLL patients is associated with improved survival and lower mortality, myelosuppression, and GvHD.\n\nRichter's transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: a retrospective study reporting clinical data, outcome, and the benefit of adding rituximab to chemotherapy, from the Israeli CLL Study Group.\n\nPubMed\n\nTadmor, Tamar; Shvidel, Lev; Bairey, Osnat; Goldschmidt, Neta; Ruchlemer, Rosa; Fineman, Riva; Rahimi-Levene, Naomi; Herishanu, Yair; Yuklea, Mona; Arad, Ariela; Aviv, Ariel; Polliack, Aaron\n\n2014-11-01\n\nRichter's syndrome (RS) is the rare development of an aggressive lymphoid malignancy in a patient with pre-existing chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Data on RS is sparse and mostly derived from case reports or small series of patients and only a few larger cohorts have been published. The purpose of this large retrospective study was to summarize our national experience with RS in CLL, examine possible risk factors, and analyze relevant demographic, laboratory and clinical parameters, including results of therapy and outcome. We first evaluated data obtained from 119 patients with RS diagnosed during 1971-2010 from 12 medical centers in Israel. The final cohort summarized consisted of 81 patients with RS who developed only diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after exclusion all cases with insufficient data and those who were not DLBCL. Median overall survival from time of diagnosis of RS was 8 months; after applying the Richter score, patients could be stratified into three prognostic groups, while all other clinical and laboratory parameters evaluated had no prognostic significance. Prior therapy for CLL had no impact on RS survival (Pâ=â0.8) and patients with therapy \"naÃ¯ve\" RS and those who had already received chemotherapy prior to developing RS, had the same survival. The addition of rituximab to chemotherapy for RS improved 2 years overall survival from 19% in the chemotherapy alone arm to 42% (P value of 0.001). Although prognosis of patients with RS remains dismal, this retrospective observation provides support for the use of chemo-immunotherapy in DLBCL-RS.

We have learned how the molecular architecture differs not only between affected individuals but also within samples and over time. These insights have catalyzed our understanding of the pathobiology of CLL and point to critical signaling pathways in the development and progression of the disease. Several key driver alterations have been identified, which serve to refine prognostic schemata but also inspire the development of new therapeutic strategies. Ongoing advances in technology promise to further elucidate the molecular basis of CLL, and this knowledge is anticipated to aid us in understanding and addressing the clinical challenge presented by the vast variability in the clinical course of patients with CLL.

All cases were defined by cytochemistry, immunological markers and transmission electron microscopy prior to SEM examination. B-CLL cells showed the well-recognized spectrum of surface architecture described in earlier studies. The majority of cells had moderate numbers of short microvilli, although in a minority, cells with relatively smooth surfaces predominated. In seven of the eight cases of PL-CLL, cells were villous in nature and in this respect similar to CLL cells; however, more cells with dense microvilli were seen. The prolymphocytic cells were recognized by their larger size and in 18 of the 19 cases of B-derived PLL, villous cells predominated. Two cases of T-derived PLL showed variable cell surface morphology ranging from smooth to moderately villous. It appears that B-PLL cells are most frequently villous and display more surface microvilli than B-CLL cells. B-prolymphocytes display the surface features regarded as characteristic for neoplastic B-cells as seen in patients with B-type lymphoma and leukaemia.\n\nLow CLL-1 Expression Is a Novel Adverse Predictor in 123 Patients with De Novo CD34+ Acute Myeloid Leukemia.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Yan-Yu; Chen, Wen-Lian; Weng, Xiang-Qin; Sheng, Yan; Wu, Jing; Hao, Jie; Liu, Zhan-Yun; Zhu, Yong-Mei; Chen, Bing; Xiong, Shu-Min; Chen, Yu; Chen, Qiu-Sheng; Sun, Hui-Ping; Li, Jun-Min; Wang, Jin\n\n2017-10-15\n\nRecent reports state that C-type lectin-like molecule-1 (CLL-1) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is expressed primarily on myeloid cells, but there is still no investigation about its prognostic significance on leukemic blast compartment. Hence, this study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of CLL-1 in 123 patients with de novo CD34 + Non-M3 AML. Multiparameter flow cytometry was used to assess the expression of CLL-1 on immature compartment in AML and control groups. We found that CLL-1 expression level on blast compartment was closely linked to clinical characteristics, treatment response, and survival outcome of patients. Decreased expression of CLL-1 was observed on immature compartment from AML patients as compared with controls (62.6% vs. 86.5%, Pâ<â0.05). Logistic model exhibited that CLL-1 low independently predicted low complete remission rate with an odds ratio of 4.57 (2.53-6.61, Pâ<â0.05). Additionally, CLL-1 expression level at diagnosis was inversely correlated to the residual blast cells (residual leukemia cell) after induction chemotherapy (râ=â-0.423, Pâ<â0.05). Furthermore, multivariate Cox regression model demonstrated that CLL-1 low was still an independent adverse predictor (Pâ<â0.05 for event-free survival, Pâ<â0.05 for overall survival). Notably, CLL-1 low was able to discriminate poor survival patients from intermediate- and favorable-risk groups. Taken together, CLL-1 is a novel prognostic predictor that could be exploited to supplement the current AML prognostic risk stratification system, and potentially optimize the clinical management of AML.\n\nImmunological aspects in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) development.\n\nPubMed\n\nGarcÃ­a-MuÃ±oz, Ricardo; Galiacho, VerÃ³nica Roldan; Llorente, Luis\n\n2012-07-01\n\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is unique among B cell malignancies in that the malignant clones can be featured either somatically mutated or unmutated IGVH genes. CLL cells that express unmutated immunoglobulin variable domains likely underwent final development prior to their entry into the germinal center, whereas those that express mutated variable domains likely transited through the germinal center and then underwent final development. Regardless, the cellular origin of CLL remains unknown. The aim of this review is to summarize immunological aspects involved in this process and to provide insights about the complex biology and pathogenesis of this disease. We propose a mechanistic hypothesis to explain the origin of B-CLL clones into our current picture of normal B cell development. In particular, we suggest that unmutated CLL arises from normal B cells with self-reactivity for apoptotic bodies that have undergone receptor editing, CD5 expression, and anergic processes in the bone marrow. Similarly, mutated CLL would arise from cells that, while acquiring self-reactivity for autoantigens-including apoptotic bodies-in germinal centers, are also still subject to tolerization mechanisms, including receptor editing and anergy. We believe that CLL is a proliferation of B lymphocytes selected during clonal expansion through multiple encounters with (auto)antigens, despite the fact that they differ in their state of activation and maturation. Autoantigens and microbial pathogens activate BCR signaling and promote tolerogenic mechanisms such as receptor editing/revision, anergy, CD5+ expression, and somatic hypermutation in CLL B cells. The result of these tolerogenic mechanisms is the survival of CLL B cell clones with similar surface markers and homogeneous gene expression signatures. We suggest that both immunophenotypic surface markers and homogenous gene expression might represent the evidence of several attempts to re-educate self-reactive B cells.\n\nImmunotherapy in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL).\n\nPubMed\n\nFreeman, Ciara L; Gribben, John G\n\n2016-02-01\n\nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is well known to generate impaired immune responses in the host, with the malignant clone residing in well-vascularized tissues and circulating in peripheral blood but also in close proximity to effector cells that are capable, if activated appropriately, of eliciting a cytotoxic response. These, combined with the fact that this is frequently a condition affecting older patients with co-morbidities often unfit for many \"traditional\" cytotoxic agents with their significant associated toxicities, make CLL an ideal candidate for the development of immunotherapy. The impressive results seen with the addition of a monoclonal antibody, rituximab, to a chemotherapy backbone, for example, is testament to how effective harnessing an immune-mediated response in CLL can be. This review serves to outline the available arsenal of immunotherapies-past and present-demonstrated to have potential in CLL with some perspectives on how the landscape in this disease may evolve in the future.\n\nReduced intensity versus full myeloablative stem cell transplant for advanced CLL.\n\nPubMed\n\nPeres, E; Braun, T; Krijanovski, O; Khaled, Y; Levine, J E; Yanik, G; Kato, K; Mineishi, S\n\n2009-11-01\n\nCLL remains incurable with the standard therapy. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant may be curative. We examined 50 patients with advanced CLL who underwent allogeneic HCT at the University of Michigan between 1996 and 2006. Twenty-one patients received reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) and twenty-nine patients received full-intensity conditioning (FIC) consisting of CY, etoposide and BCNU (n=20) or BU and CY (n=9). RIC recipients were older than FIC recipients (median age 54 vs 51, P=0.009). There were no statistically significant differences between groups in terms of the number of earlier therapies or patients with adverse cytogenetics. There were more unrelated donors in the RIC group 62% than in the FIC group 31% (P=0.030). Despite their older age and greater use of URD, the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 63% in the RIC group as compared with 18% in the FIC group (P=0.006). The primary cause of inferior survival in the FIC recipients was TRM, which was twice as high at day 100 for the FIC group 27% compared with the RIC group 14% (P=0.005). The relapse rate was 15% regardless with the majority of relapses occurring after day 100. These results suggest a favorable outcome for advanced CLL who undergo a RIC regimen compared with FIC.\n\nRelationship between co-morbidities at diagnosis, survival and ultimate cause of death in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL): a prospective cohort study.\n\nPubMed\n\nStrati, Paolo; Parikh, Sameer A; Chaffee, Kari G; Kay, Neil E; Call, Timothy G; Achenbach, Sara J; Cerhan, James R; Slager, Susan L; Shanafelt, Tait D\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThe ultimate cause of death for most patients with newly diagnosed chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and its relationship to co-morbid health conditions is poorly defined. We conducted a prospective cohort study that systematically followed 1143 patients diagnosed with CLL between June 2002 and November 2014. Comorbid health conditions at the time of CLL diagnosis and their relationship to survival and cause of death were evaluated. Collectively, 1061 (93%) patients had at least one co-morbid health condition at the time of CLL diagnosis (median number 3). Despite this, 89% of patients had a low-intermediate Charlson Comorbidity Index score (CCI) at diagnosis. After a median follow-up of 6Â years, 225 patients have died. Death was due to CLL progression in 85 (46%) patients, infection in 14 (8%) patients, other cancer in 35 (19%) patients and comorbid health conditions in 50 (27%) patients. Higher CCI score and a greater number of major comorbid health conditions at the time of CLL diagnosis was associated with shorter non-CLL specific survival, but not with shorter CLL-specific survival on multivariate analysis. In conclusion, CLL and CLL-related complications (infections and second cancers) are the overwhelming cause of death in patients with CLL, regardless of CCI score and number of comorbid health conditions at diagnosis.

It has been shown that CD20 is epigenetically regulated and that histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) can increase CD20 expression in vitro in CLL. To assess whether HDACis can upregulate CD20 also in vivo in CLL, the HDACi valproate was given to three del13q/NOTCH1wt CLL patients and CD20 levels were analysed (the PREVAIL study). Valproate treatment resulted in expected global activating histone modifications suggesting HDAC inhibitory effects. However, although valproate induced expression of CD20 mRNA and protein in the del13q/NOTCH1wt I83-E95 CLL cell line, no such effects were observed in the patients studied. In contrast to the cell line, in patients valproate treatment resulted in transient recruitment of the transcriptional repressor EZH2 to the CD20 promoter, correlating to an increase of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3. This suggests that valproate-mediated induction of CD20 may be hampered by EZH2 mediated H3K27me3 in vivo in CLL. Moreover, valproate treatment resulted in induction of EZH2 and global H3K27me3 in patient cells, suggesting transcriptionally repressive effects of valproate in CLL. Our results suggest new in vivo mechanisms of HDACis which may have implications on the design of future clinical trials in B-cell malignancies.

We used the Mayo Clinic CLL Database to identify patients with newly diagnosed CLL between January 2000 and July 2011. Individuals who developed biopsy-proven RS during follow-up were identified. After a median follow-up of 4 years, 37/1641 (2Â·3%) CLL patients developed RS. The rate of RS was approximately 0Â·5%/year. Risk of RS was associated with advanced Rai stage at diagnosis (P < 0Â·001), high-risk genetic abnormalitites on fluorescence in situ hybridization (P < 0Â·0001), unmutated IGHV (P = 0Â·003), and expression of ZAP70 (P = 0Â·02) and CD38 (P = 0Â·001). The rate of RS doubled in patients after treatment for CLL (1%/year). Stereotyped B-cell receptors (odds-ratio = 4Â·2; P = 0Â·01) but not IGHV4-39 family usage was associated with increased risk of RS. Treatment with combination of purine analogues and alkylating agents increased the risk of RS three-fold (odds-ratio = 3Â·26, P = 0Â·0003). Median survival after RS diagnosis was 2Â·1 years. The RS prognosis score stratified patients into three risk groups with median survivals of 0Â·5 years, 2Â·1 years and not reached. Both underlying characteristics of the CLL clone and subsequent CLL therapy influence the risk of RS. Survival after RS remains poor and new therapies are needed.

This has led to greatly increased response rates and durations of response but not yet improved survival. Advances in the use of prognostic factors that identify patients at high risk for progression have led us to the question whether there is still a role for a \"watch and wait\" approach in asymptomatic high-risk patients or whether they should be treated earlier in their disease course. Questions remain, including, what is the optimal first-line treatment and its timing and is there any role of maintenance therapy or stem cell transplantation in this disease? CLL is a disease of the elderly and not all patients are eligible for aggressive up-front chemoimmunotherapy regimens, so what is the optimal treatment approach for more frail elderly patients? It is highly likely that our treatment approaches will continue to evolve as the results of ongoing clinical trials are released and that further improvements in the outcome of this disease will result from identification of therapies that target the underlying pathophysiology of CLL.\n\nGenetic and cytokine changes associated with symptomatic stages of CLL.\n\nPubMed\n\nAgarwal, Amit; Cooke, Lawrence; Riley, Christopher; Qi, Wenqing; Mount, David; Mahadevan, Daruka\n\n2014-09-01\n\nThe pathogenesis and drug resistance of symptomatic CLL patients involves genetic changes associated with the CLL clone as well as changes within the microenvironment. To further understand these processes, we compared early stage CLL to symptomatic late stage using gene expression and serum cytokine profiling to gain insight of the genetic and microenvironment changes associated with the most severe form of the disease. Patients were classified into low stage (Rai stage 0/I/II) and high stage (Rai stage III/IV). Gene expression profiles were obtained on pretreatment samples using the HG-U133A 2.0 Affymetrix platform. A comparison of low versus high stage CLL revealed a set of 21 genes differentially expressed genes. 15 genes were up regulated in the high stage compared to low stage while 6 genes were down regulated. Analysis of GO molecular function revealed 9 of 21 genes were involved in transcription factor activity. Serum cytokine profiles showed six cytokines to be significantly different in high stage patients. Two chemokines, SDF-1/CXCL12 and uPAR known to be involved in stem cell mobilization and homing were increased in serum of high stage patients. This study has identified therapeutic targets for symptomatic CLL patients. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The choice of treatment is generally based on the existence of biological and genetic factors associated with the prediction of prognosis, individual response to therapy, and duration of remission. About 20% of patients that require treatment have an aggressive disease course and die within a few years, despite early initiation of intensive therapy (poor-risk CLL). Poor-risk CLL can be predicted by the presence of genomic markers, and the quality and duration of response to purine-analogue-based treatment. Within this patient subgroup alternative treatment approaches such as alemtuzumab or new substances such as flavopiridol or IMiDsÂ® should be considered. To date, the only treatment bearing curative potential is allogeneic stem cell transplantation; in contrast to conventional immunochemotherapy, it can provide long-term disease control, even in patients with del 17p or other unfavorable biological and clinical risk factors. The aim of this review was to outline the current strategies for the diagnosis and management of CLL, with a focus on high-risk CLL.\n\nClinical roundtable monograph. New alternatives in CLL therapy: managing adverse events.\n\nPubMed\n\nChanan-Khan, Asher; Kipps, Thomas; Stilgenbauer, Stephan\n\n2010-08-01\n\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a B-cell leukemia mainly affecting older adults. Historically, CLL has been regarded as an incurable disease, and treatment has been confined to cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens. However, prognosis for patients treated with these agents remained poor, prompting the development of new, targeted agents. The introduction of rituximab, a CD20-targeted monoclonal antibody, revolutionized the treatment for this disease. Rituximab in combination with fludarabine improved response rates and length of progression-free survival. The success of rituximab in this setting has prompted the development of many more investigational agents for CLL, including other antibody agents. However, as with any medication, the potential benefit achieved with CLL therapies is mitigated by the safety risk for the patient. These agents have been associated with adverse events such as immunosuppression, reactivation of cytomegalovirus, and infusion-related reactions that can occur with antibody administration. Adverse events can greatly affect the patientâs quality of life and ability to tolerate therapy. Management of adverse events is a critical component of the overall treatment strategy for CLL, particularly in elderly patients. In this clinical roundtable monograph, 3 expert physicians discuss the latest clinical studies evaluating the treatment of CLL, focusing on the adverse events associated with each agent and the potential interventions that can be used to manage their occurrence.\n\nRole of stromal cell-mediated Notch signaling in CLL resistance to chemotherapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nNwabo Kamdje, A H; Bassi, G; Pacelli, L; Malpeli, G; Amati, E; Nichele, I; Pizzolo, G; Krampera, M\n\n2012-05-01\n\nStromal cells are essential components of the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment that regulate and support the survival of different tumors, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In this study, we investigated the role of Notch signaling in the promotion of survival and chemoresistance of human CLL cells in coculture with human BM-mesenchymal stromal cells (hBM-MSCs) of both autologous and allogeneic origin. The presence of BM-MSCs rescued CLL cells from apoptosis both spontaneously and following induction with various drugs, including Fludarabine, Cyclophosphamide, Bendamustine, Prednisone and Hydrocortisone. The treatment with a combination of anti-Notch-1, Notch-2 and Notch-4 antibodies or Î³-secretase inhibitor XII (GSI XII) reverted this protective effect by day 3, even in presence of the above-mentioned drugs. Overall, our findings show that stromal cell-mediated Notch-1, Notch-2 and Notch-4 signaling has a role in CLL survival and resistance to chemotherapy. Therefore, its blocking could be an additional tool to overcome drug resistance and improve the therapeutic strategies for CLL.\n\nRole of stromal cell-mediated Notch signaling in CLL resistance to chemotherapy\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKamdje, A H Nwabo; Bassi, G; Pacelli, L; Malpeli, G; Amati, E; Nichele, I; Pizzolo, G; Krampera, M\n\n2012-01-01\n\nStromal cells are essential components of the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment that regulate and support the survival of different tumors, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

Analysis of DNA mutations grouped the leukemia cases into three categories: evolving (26%), expanding (26%) and static (47%). Thus, approximately three-quarters of the CLL cases had little to no genetic subclonal evolution. However, we identified significant recurrent DNA methylation changes during progression at 4752 CpGs enriched for regions near Polycomb 2 repressive complex (PRC2) targets. Progression-associated CpGs near the PRC2 targets undergo methylation changes in the same direction during disease progression as during normal development from naive to memory B cells. Our study shows that CLL progression does not typically occur via subclonal evolution, but that certain CpG sites undergo recurrent methylation changes. Our results suggest CLL progression may involve developmental processes shared in common with the generation of normal memory B cells.\n\nIbrutinib treatment improves T cell number and function in CLL patients\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLong, Meixiao; Do, Priscilla; Mundy, Bethany L.; Gordon, Amber; Lehman, Amy M.; Maddocks, Kami J.; Cheney, Carolyn; Jones, Jeffrey A.; Flynn, Joseph M.; Andritsos, Leslie A.; Fraietta, Joseph A.; June, Carl H.; Maus, Marcela V.; Woyach, Jennifer A.; Caligiuri, Michael A.; Johnson, Amy J.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBACKGROUND. Ibrutinib has been shown to have immunomodulatory effects by inhibiting Brutonâs tyrosine kinase (BTK) and IL-2âinducible T cell kinase (ITK). The relative importance of inhibiting these 2 kinases has not been examined despite its relevance to immune-based therapies. METHODS. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients on clinical trials of ibrutinib (BTK/ITK inhibitor; n = 19) or acalabrutinib (selective BTK inhibitor; n = 13) were collected serially. T cell phenotype, immune function, and CLL cell immunosuppressive capacity were evaluated. RESULTS. Ibrutinib markedly increased CD4+ and CD8+ T cell numbers in CLL patients. This effect was more prominent in effector/effector memory subsets and was not observed with acalabrutinib. Ex vivo studies demonstrated that this may be due to diminished activation-induced cell death through ITK inhibition. PD-1 and CTLA-4 expression was significantly markedly reduced in T cells by both agents. While the number of Treg cells remained unchanged, the ratio of these to conventional CD4+ T cells was reduced with ibrutinib, but not acalabrutinib. Both agents reduced expression of the immunosuppressive molecules CD200 and BTLA as well as IL-10 production by CLL cells. CONCLUSIONS. Ibrutinib treatment increased the in vivo persistence of activated T cells, decreased the Treg/CD4+ T cell ratio, and diminished the immune-suppressive properties of CLL cells through BTK-dependent and -independent mechanisms. These features provide a strong rationale for combination immunotherapy approaches with ibrutinib in CLL and other cancers. TRIAL REGISTRATION. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01589302 and NCT02029443.

Using deep sequencing of flow-sorted cell populations from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), we established the presence of acquired mutations in multipotent hematopoietic progenitors. Mutations affected known lymphoid oncogenes, including BRAF, NOTCH1, and SF3B1. NFKBIE and EGR2 mutations were observed at unexpectedly high frequencies, 10.7% and 8.3% of 168 advanced-stage patients, respectively. EGR2 mutations were associated with a shorter time to treatment and poor overall survival. Analyses of BRAF and EGR2 mutations suggest that they result in deregulation of B-cell receptor (BCR) intracellular signaling. Our data propose disruption of hematopoietic and early B-cell differentiation through the deregulation of pre-BCR signaling as a phenotypic outcome of CLL mutations and show that CLL develops from a pre-leukemic phase. The origin and pathogenic mechanisms of CLL are not fully understood. The current work indicates that CLL develops from pre-leukemic multipotent hematopoietic progenitors carrying somatic mutations. It advocates for abnormalities in early B-cell differentiation as a phenotypic convergence of the diverse acquired mutations observed in CLL.

Here, we present a simple method for in vitro stimulation of CLL cells that overcomes this limitation. In our unselected patient population, 125 of 132 cases could be successfully stimulated for metaphase generation by culture with the immunostimulatory CpG-oligonucleotide DSP30 plus interleukin 2. Of 125 cases, 101 showed chromosomal aberrations. The aberration rate is comparable to the rate detected by parallel interphase FISH. In 47 patients, conventional cytogenetics detected additional aberrations not detected by FISH analysis. A complex aberrant karyotype, defined as one having at least 3 aberrations, was detected in 30 of 125 patients, compared with only one such case as defined by FISH. Conventional cytogenetics frequently detected balanced and unbalanced translocations. A significant correlation of the poor-prognosis unmutated IgV(H) status with unbalanced translocations and of the likewise poor-prognosis CD38 expression to balanced translocations and complex aberrant karyotype was found. We demonstrate that FISH analysis underestimates the complexity of chromosomal aberrations in CLL. Therefore, conventional cytogenetics may define subgroups of patients with high risk of progression.\n\n[Patient with B-CLL with a history of unrelated hematopoietic cells donation--retrospective analysis of CLL development and implication for the recipient].\n\nPubMed\n\nJindra, P; Å½ejÅ¡kovÃ¡, L; PekovÃ¡, S; NavrÃ¡tilovÃ¡, J; SchutzovÃ¡, M; Vokurka, S; Koza, V\n\n2012-01-01\n\nDonor cell leukemia (DCL) is a relatively rare but well documented complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. So far, publications described only DCL arising de novo in the recipient. In this study, we describe a case of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) developing in a volunteer unrelated donor from the Czech National Marrow Donors Registry (CNMDR) several years after donation. From archival DNA sample, we have retrospectively found that subclinical CLL clone was already present at the time of donation but early death of recipient prevented eventual development of DCL. This case documents well the long period between detection of B-CLL clone and full development of clinical-laboratory symptomatology. The medical and ethical questions posed by an isolated case of detection of hematological malignancy present either only in the donor or only in the recipient are discussed. The case demonstrates the increasing risk of development of various forms of DCL and thus highlights the need for long-term monitoring of stem cell donor, not only in terms of health of donor but also in terms of potential risks for the recipient.\n\nAngiogenic factors in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL): Where do we stand?\n\nPubMed\n\nAguirre Palma, Luis Mario; Gehrke, Iris; Kreuzer, Karl-Anton\n\n2015-03-01\n\nThe role of angiogenesis in haematological malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is difficult to envision, because leukaemia cells are not dependent on a network of blood vessels to support basic physiological requirements. Regardless, CLL cells secrete high levels of major angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF). Nonetheless, it remains unclear how most angiogenic factors regulate accumulation and delayed apoptosis of CLL cells. Angiogenic factors such as leptin, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), follistatin, angiopoietin-1 (Ang1), angiogenin (ANG), midkine (MK), pleiotrophin (PTN), progranulin (PGRN), proliferin (PLF), placental growth factor (PIGF), and endothelial locus-1 (Del-1), represent novel therapeutic targets of future CLL research but have remained widely overlooked. This review aims to outline our current understanding of angiogenic growth factors and their relationship with CLL, a still uncured haematopoietic malignancy. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Standard chemotherapies can induce complete remission in selected patients; however, a majority of patients eventually relapse and succumb to the disease. Thus, the development of novel therapeutics for AML is urgently needed. Human C-type lectin-like molecule-1 (CLL-1) is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein, and its expression is restricted to myeloid cells and the majority of AML blasts. Moreover, CLL-1 is expressed in leukemia stem cells (LSCs), but absent in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which may provide a potential therapeutic target for AML treatment. We tested the expression of CLL-1 antigen on peripheral blood cells and bone marrow cells in healthy donor and AML patients. Then, we developed a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) containing a CLL1-specific single-chain variable fragment, in combination with CD28, 4-1BB costimulatory domains, and CD3-Î¶ signaling domain. We further investigate the function of CLL-1 CAR-T cells. The CLL-1 CAR-T cells specifically lysed CLL-1 + cell lines as well as primary AML patient samples in vitro. Strong anti-leukemic activity was observed in vivo by using a xenograft model of disseminated AML. Importantly, CLL-1 + myeloid progenitor cells and mature myeloid cells were specifically eliminated by CLL-1 CAR-T cells, while normal HSCs were not targeted due to the lack of CLL-1 expression. CLL-1 CAR-T represents a promising immunotherapy for the treatment of AML.\n\nGeneration of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL)-reactive T-cell lines and clones from HLA class I-matched donors using modified B-CLL cells as stimulators: implications for adoptive immunotherapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nHoogendoorn, M; Wolbers, J Olde; Smit, W M; Schaafsma, M R; Barge, R M Y; Willemze, R; Falkenburg, J H F\n\n2004-07-01\n\nAllogeneic stem cell transplantation following reduced-intensity conditioning is being evaluated in patients with advanced B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). The curative potential of this procedure is mediated by donor-derived alloreactive T cells, resulting in a graft-versus-leukemia effect. However, B-CLL may escape T-cell-mediated immune reactivity since these cells lack expression of costimulatory molecules. We examined the most optimal method to transform B-CLL cells into efficient antigen-presenting cells (APC) using activating cytokines, by triggering toll-like receptors (TLRs) using microbial pathogens and by CD40 stimulation with CD40L-transfected fibroblasts. CD40 activation in the presence of IL-4 induced strongest upregulation of costimulatory and adhesion molecules on B-CLL cells and induced the production of high amounts of IL-12 by the leukemic cells. In contrast to primary B-CLL cells as stimulator cells, these malignant APCs were capable of inducing the generation of B-CLL-reactive CD8(+) CTL lines and clones from HLA class I-matched donors. These CTL lines and clones recognized and killed primary B-CLL as well as patient-derived lymphoblasts, but not donor cells. These results show the feasibility of ex vivo generation of B-CLL-reactive CD8(+) CTLs. This opens new perspectives for adoptive immunotherapy, following allogeneic stem cell transplantation in patients with advanced B-CLL.\n\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia: A prognostic model comprising only two biomarkers (IGHV mutational status and FISH cytogenetics) separates patients with different outcome and simplifies the CLL-IPI.\n\nPubMed\n\nDelgado, Julio; Doubek, Michael; Baumann, Tycho; Kotaskova, Jana; Molica, Stefano; Mozas, Pablo; Rivas-Delgado, Alfredo; Morabito, Fortunato; Pospisilova, Sarka; Montserrat, Emili\n\n2017-04-01\n\nRai and Binet staging systems are important to predict the outcome of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) but do not reflect the biologic diversity of the disease nor predict response to therapy, which ultimately shape patients' outcome. We devised a biomarkers-only CLL prognostic system based on the two most important prognostic parameters in CLL (i.e., IGHV mutational status and fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH] cytogenetics), separating three different risk groups: (1) low-risk (mutated IGHVâ+âno adverse FISH cytogenetics [del(17p), del(11q)]); (2) intermediate-risk (either unmutated IGHV or adverse FISH cytogenetics) and (3) high-risk (unmutated IGHVâ+âadverse FISH cytogenetics). In 524 unselected subjects with CLL, the 10-year overall survival was 82% (95% CI 76%-88%), 52% (45%-62%), and 27% (17%-42%) for the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively. Patients with low-risk comprised around 50% of the series and had a life expectancy comparable to the general population. The prognostic model was fully validated in two independent cohorts, including 417 patients representative of general CLL population and 337 patients with Binet stage A CLL. The model had a similar discriminatory value as the CLL-IPI. Moreover, it applied to all patients with CLL independently of age, and separated patients with different risk within Rai or Binet clinical stages. The biomarkers-only CLL prognostic system presented here simplifies the CLL-IPI and could be useful in daily practice and to stratify patients in clinical trials.

This was evidence-based whenever possible, but in cases of low evidence, an expert-based recommendation was formulated with input of the entire working party. The draft guideline was sent to all hematologists in the Netherlands for comment and was subsequently approved. Recommendations were formulated on diagnostic tests and work-up before treatment. Also, recommendations were made for treatment with fludarabine-cyclophosphamide-rituximab, bendamustine-rituximab, chlorambucil with anti-CD20 antibody, ibrutinib, idelalisib-rituximab, venetoclax, and allogeneic stem cell transplantation. In the revised Dutch CLL guidelines, chemo-immunotherapy is still the cornerstone of CLL treatment with novel targeted drugs for specific risk groups. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells also secrete IL-10 and share features of B10 cells, suggesting a possible contribution of CLL B cells to immunosuppression in CLL patients. Factors controlling the emergence of B10 cells are not known. B-cell-activating factor of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family (BAFF) is critical for B-cell maturation and survival, and is implicated in the development and progression of CLL. We sought to investigate the role of BAFF in the emergence of IL-10-producing regulatory B cells in healthy donors and CLL patients. Here, we report that BAFF signaling promotes IL-10 production by CLL B cells in a mouse model of CLL and in CLL patients. Moreover, BAFF-mediated IL-10 production by normal and CLL B cells is mediated via its receptor transmembrane activator and cyclophilin ligand interactor. Our work uncovered a major targetable pathway important for the generation of regulatory B cells that is detrimental to immunity in CLL.\n\nCorrelation of the expression of CD32 and CD180 receptors on CLL cells and MEC1 cell line.\n\nPubMed\n\nTsertsvadze, T; Mitskevich, N; Ghirdaladze, D; Porakishvili, N\n\n2015-03-01\n\nChronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) presents with clonal expansion and accumulation of CD5+CD19+CD23+ cells in peripheral lymphoid organs and tissues and in bone marrow. CLL is supposedly driven by exogenous and/or endogenous (auto)antigen(s) and there is increasing evidence that CLL cells receive microenvironmental signals which support their growth, survival and expansion in vivo. We have previously shown that powerful signals are received by CLL cells through CD180 orphan toll-like receptor. Additional accessory signals could be generated through FcÎ³RII (CD32), since both are expressed on CLL cells as well as on control B cells. Here we studied correlation of the expression of CD32 and CD180 on CLL cells as well as on MEC1 cell line. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from CLL patients and age-matched healthy volunteers were separated, stained with appropriate antibodies to CD19, CD32 and CD180 and analysed by flow cytometry. CD32 and CD180 expression on MEC1 cells was studied at different time-points. The data was statistically analysed using the Mann-Whitney non-parametrical test. Our data indicates that expression of CD32 is significantly increased on CLL cells compared to control B cells as well as in long-term MEC1 cell culture. In contrast, CD180 expression on MEC1 cells significantly decreased throughout 0-96h of MEC1 cell culture. We have recently shown that CD180 ligation can redirect sIgM-mediated signaling from pro-survival to pro-apoptotic. This data indicates that a drop in the expression of CD180 on cycling CLL cells might lead to a weakening of this effect and enhance further survival and expansion of CLL cells in proliferative centres of lymphoid tissues. Since MEC1 cells are derived from a CLL patient with mutated IGVH genes (M-CLL) negative correlation between CD180 and CD32 expression on cycling MEC1 cells could be limited to M-CLL.\n\nOutcomes for Patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) and Acute Leukemia or Myelodysplastic Syndrome\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTambaro, Francesco Paolo; Garcia-Manero, Guillermo; OâBrien, Susan M.; Faderl, Stefan H.; Ferrajoli, Alessandra; Burger, Jan A.; Pierce, Sherry; Wang, Xuemei; Do, Kim-Anh; Kantarjian, Hagop M.; Keating, Michael J.; Wierda, William G.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAcute leukemia (AL) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) are uncommon in CLL. We retrospectively identified 95 patients with CLL also diagnosed with AL (n=38) or MDS (n=57), either concurrently (n=5) or subsequent (n=90) to CLL diagnosis and report their outcomes. Median number of CLL treatments prior to AL and MDS was 2(0â9) and 1(0â8), respectively; the most common regimen was purine analogue combined with alkylating agentÂ±CD20 mAb. Twelve had no prior CLL treatment. Among 38 with AL, 33 had AML, 3 had ALL (1Ph+), 1 had biphenotypic, and 1 had extramedullary (bladder) AML. Unfavorable AML karyotype was noted in 26, intermediate-risk in 7. There was no association between survival from AL and number of prior CLL regimens or karyotype. Expression of CD7 on blasts was associated with shorter survival. Among MDS cases, all IPSS were represented; karyotype was unfavorable in 36, intermediate in 6, and favorable in 12 patients; 10 experienced transformation to AML. Shorter survival from MDS correlated with higher-risk IPSS, poor-risk karyotype, and increased number of prior CLL treatments. Overall, outcomes for patients with CLL subsequently diagnosed with AL or MDS were poor; AL/MDS occurred without prior CLL treatment. Effective therapies for these patients are desperately needed.

We found JAK2 mutation in a patient with CLL and coexisting myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). In this patient, we demonstrated the presence of the JAK2 mutation in CD34(+) progenitor cells, myeloid lineage cells, megakaryocytes, B lymphocytes but not in T lymphocytes. This case represents the first case report of JAK2 mutation in CLL and may also suggest that, JAK2 mutation most likely represents a secondary event from primary gene mutations involving the primitive stem cells which give rise to MPN and CLL. Furthermore, in this case, we believe that we are the first to demonstrate that JAK2 mutation in myeloid and B lymphoid cells but not T lymphocytes in a case of coexisting CLL and MPN.\n\nSalvage therapy for CLL and the role of stem cell transplantation.\n\nPubMed\n\nGribben, John G\n\n2005-01-01\n\nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) remains an incurable disease and, notwithstanding the excellent remission rates now achieved with purine analogs and monoclonal antibodies, the vast majority of patients with CLL are destined to relapse after primary treatment. The management of relapsed CLL patients is then dependent upon a number of factors, most importantly age, performance status, previous therapy administered, the response and duration of response to such therapy, and time from last therapy. Although prior therapy and response to such therapy are important factors in determining next therapy, it is often difficult to determine their importance from published studies. Furthermore, the goal of therapy, whether palliative or aggressive, must also be weighed into the decision when deciding on the next line of treatment. With many potential treatments available, the sequence of treatments and the timing of procedures such as stem cell transplantation remain controversial and are the focus of ongoing clinical trials.\n\nCharacterization of CLL exosomes reveals a distinct microRNA signature and enhanced secretion by activation of BCR signaling.\n\nPubMed\n\nYeh, Yuh-Ying; Ozer, Hatice Gulcin; Lehman, Amy M; Maddocks, Kami; Yu, Lianbo; Johnson, Amy J; Byrd, John C\n\n2015-05-21\n\nMultiple studies show that chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells are heavily dependent on their microenvironment for survival. Communication between CLL cells and the microenvironment is mediated through direct cell contact, soluble factors, and extracellular vesicles. Exosomes are small particles enclosed with lipids, proteins, and small RNAs that can convey biological materials to surrounding cells. Our data herein demonstrate that CLL cells release significant amounts of exosomes in plasma that exhibit abundant CD37, CD9, and CD63 expression. Our work also pinpoints the regulation of B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling in the release of CLL exosomes: BCR activation by Î±-immunoglobulin (Ig)M induces exosome secretion, whereas BCR inactivation via ibrutinib impedes Î±-IgM-stimulated exosome release. Moreover, analysis of serial plasma samples collected from CLL patients on an ibrutinib clinical trial revealed that exosome plasma concentration was significantly decreased following ibrutinib therapy. Furthermore, microRNA (miR) profiling of plasma-derived exosomes identified a distinct exosome microRNA signature, including miR-29 family, miR-150, miR-155, and miR-223 that have been associated with CLL disease. Interestingly, expression of exosome miR-150 and miR-155 increases with BCR activation. In all, this study successfully characterized CLL exosomes, demonstrated the control of BCR signaling in the release of CLL exosomes, and uncovered a disease-relevant exosome microRNA profile.

Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) shows constitutive activity in CLL and is the target of irreversible inhibition by ibrutinib, an orally bioavailable kinase inhibitor that has shown outstanding activity in CLL. Early clinical results in CLL with other reversible and irreversible BTK inhibitors have been less promising, however, raising the question of whether BTK kinase activity is an important target of ibrutinib and also in CLL. To determine the role of BTK in CLL, we used patient samples and the EÎ¼-TCL1 (TCL1) transgenic mouse model of CLL, which results in spontaneous leukemia development. Inhibition of BTK in primary human CLL cells by small interfering RNA promotes apoptosis. Inhibition of BTK kinase activity through either targeted genetic inactivation or ibrutinib in the TCL1 mouse significantly delays the development of CLL, demonstrating that BTK is a critical kinase for CLL development and expansion and thus an important target of ibrutinib. Collectively, our data confirm the importance of kinase-functional BTK in CLL.\n\nIbrutinib in CLL: a focus on adverse events, resistance, and novel approaches beyond ibrutinib.\n\nPubMed\n\nKaur, Varinder; Swami, Arjun\n\n2017-07-01\n\nBruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), a mediator in B cell receptor signaling has been successfully exploited as a therapeutic target in treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL). Ibrutinib is a BTK inhibitor that has shown excellent efficacy in treatment-naÃ¯ve, heavily pre-treated, and high-risk CLL/SLL. With remarkable efficacy, good oral bioavailability, and modest adverse events profile, ibrutinib use is likely to continue to increase. As data with ibrutinib use in CLL matures, concerns regarding adverse events and drug resistance have emerged. New insights into mechanisms of ibrutinib resistance in CLL have uncovered potential therapeutic targets. Several promising novel agents are currently in early phases of development for overcoming ibrutinib resistance in CLL/SLL. We provide a comprehensive analysis of emerging adverse events profile of ibrutinib, summarize our current understanding of ibrutinib resistance in CLL, and review promising novel therapeutic tools to overcome this challenge.\n\nAppearance and Disappearance of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) in Patient with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL).\n\nPubMed\n\nPayandeh, Mehrdad; Sadeghi, Edris; Khodarahmi, Reza; Sadeghi, Masoud\n\n2014-10-01\n\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) are the most common leukemias of the elderly (>43 year). However, the sequential occurrence of CML followed by CLL in the same patient is extremely rare. In our report, a 52-year-old female was diagnosed with CLL (type of bone marrow (BM) infiltration was nodular and interstitial) and was treated with chlorambucil. 64 months after the diagnosis of CLL, she developed CML. She was treated with imatinib (400mg/day). After a few months, signs of CML were disappeared and CLL became dominant. This is first reported case.\n\nThe novel AML stem cell associated antigen CLL-1 aids in discrimination between normal and leukemic stem cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nvan Rhenen, Anna; van Dongen, Guus A M S; Kelder, AngÃ¨le; Rombouts, Elwin J; Feller, Nicole; Moshaver, Bijan; Stigter-van Walsum, Marijke; Zweegman, Sonja; Ossenkoppele, Gert J; Jan Schuurhuis, Gerrit\n\n2007-10-01\n\nIn CD34(+) acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the malignant stem cells reside in the CD38(-) compartment. We have shown before that the frequency of such CD34(+)CD38(-) cells at diagnosis correlates with minimal residual disease (MRD) frequency after chemotherapy and with survival. Specific targeting of CD34(+)CD38(-) cells might thus offer therapeutic options. Previously, we found that C-type lectin-like molecule-1 (CLL-1) has high expression on the whole blast compartment in the majority of AML cases. We now show that CLL-1 expression is also present on the CD34(+)CD38(-) stem- cell compartment in AML (77/89 patients). The CD34(+)CLL-1(+) population, containing the CD34(+)CD38(-)CLL-1(+) cells, does engraft in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice with outgrowth to CLL-1(+) blasts. CLL-1 expression was not different between diagnosis and relapse (n = 9). In remission, both CLL-1(-) normal and CLL-1(+) malignant CD34(+)CD38(-) cells were present. A high CLL-1(+) fraction was associated with quick relapse. CLL-1 expression is completely absent both on CD34(+)CD38(-) cells in normal (n = 11) and in regenerating bone marrow controls (n = 6). This AML stem-cell specificity of the anti-CLL-1 antibody under all conditions of disease and the leukemia-initiating properties of CD34(+)CLL-1(+) cells indicate that anti-CLL-1 antibody enables both AML-specific stem-cell detection and possibly antigen-targeting in future.\n\nSevere pneumonia associated with ibrutinib monotherapy for CLL and lymphoma.\n\nPubMed\n\nKreiniz, Natalia; Bejar, Jacob; Polliack, Aaron; Tadmor, Tamar\n\n2018-02-01\n\nIn recent years, there have been major advances in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) particularly since the development of novel therapeutic agents, mostly \"biological drugs.\" One of the obvious advantages of these agents is the decreased rate of infectious complications occurring during the course of therapy, compared to the use of standard immuno-chemotherapy regimens. Here, we describe 3 patients with CLL and 1 with mantle cell lymphoma who developed severe life-threatening pneumonias, during monotherapy with ibrutinib. The first case was a 70-year-old woman with relapsed CLL who developed bilateral pneumonia with hypoxia 1Â week after starting ibrutinib. She did not respond to broad-spectrum antibiotics and was treated empirically with trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole and improved. In the second case, we describe a 76-year-old woman with relapsed CLL who developed recurrent pneumonia after 3Â years of treatment with ibrutinib. Presuming that ibrutinib was the cause of pneumonitis with secondary infection, it was stopped with subsequent improvement. The third patient a 67Â year-old man died because of severe bilateral necrotizing pneumonia due to invasive aspergillosis and mucormycosis with pulmonary hemorrhage. The fourth patient with relapsed mantle cell lymphoma died because of severe bilateral pneumonia, caused by pseudomonas and candida, despite receiving appropriate antibiotics. From this experience, we hypothesize that the etiology of severe pneumonia associated with ibrutinib treatment is probably multifactorial, involving factors like preexisting immune-suppression, drug induced pneumonitis and infections. We suggest that patients with CLL or other lymphoproliferative disorders with suspected pneumonia during monotherapy with ibrutinib should be very carefully evaluated and need to undergo complete diagnostic workup to establish an exact diagnosis.

These systems, the Rai and the Binet staging, depended entirely on abnormal exam findings and evidence of anemia and thrombocytopenia. Better understanding of biologic, genetic, and molecular characteristics of CLL have contributed to better appreciating its clinical heterogeneity. New prognostic models, the GCLLSG prognostic index and the CLL-IPI, emerged. They incorporate biologic and genetic information related to CLL and are capable of predicting survival outcomes and cases anticipated to need therapy earlier in the disease course. Accordingly, these newer models are helping develop better informed surveillance strategies and ultimately tailor treatment intensity according to presence (or lack thereof) of certain prognostic markers. This represents a step towards personalizing care of CLL patients. We anticipate that as more prognostic factors continue to be identified, the GCLLSG prognostic index and CLL-IPI models will undergo further revisions. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Characteristically, ibrutinib causes CLL cell redistribution from tissue sites into the peripheral blood during the initial weeks of therapy. To better characterize the dynamics of this redistribution phenomenon, we correlated serial lymphocyte counts with volumetric changes in lymph node and spleen sizes during ibrutinib therapy. Kinetic parameters were estimated by applying a mathematical model to the data. We found that during ibrutinib therapy, 1.7% Â± 1.1% of blood CLL cells and 2.7% Â± 0.99% of tissue CLL cells die per day. The fraction of the tissue CLL cells that was redistributed into the blood during therapy was estimated to be 23.3% Â± 17% of the total tissue disease burden. These data indicate that the reduction of tissue disease burden by ibrutinib is due more to CLL cell death and less to egress from nodal compartments.

Previous work has shown expression in peripheral blood (PB) of CLL B cells of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) among CLL patients with an unmutated (UM) profile of immunoglobulin genes and with ongoing class switch recombination (CSR) process. Because AID expression results from interaction with activated tissue microenvironment, we speculated whether the small subset with ongoing CSR is responsible for high levels of AID expression and could be derived from this particular microenvironment. In this work, we quantified AID expression and ongoing CSR in PB of 50 CLL patients and characterized the expression of different molecules related to microenvironment interaction. Our results show that among UM patients (1) high AID expression is restricted to the subpopulation of tumoral cells ongoing CSR; (2) this small subset expresses high levels of proliferation, antiapoptotic and progression markers (Ki-67, c-myc, Bcl-2, CD49d, and CCL3/4 chemokines). Overall, this work outlines the importance of a cellular subset in PB of UM CLL patients with a poor clinical outcome, high AID levels, and ongoing CSR, whose presence might be a hallmark of a recent contact with the microenvironment.\n\nComprehensive genetic characterization of CLL: a study on 506 cases analysed with chromosome banding analysis, interphase FISH, IgV(H) status and immunophenotyping.\n\nPubMed\n\nHaferlach, C; Dicker, F; Schnittger, S; Kern, W; Haferlach, T\n\n2007-12-01\n\nIn CLL data from chromosome banding analysis (CBA) have been scarce due to the low proliferative activity of CLL cells in vitro. We improved the cultivation technique using an immunostimulatory CpG-oligonucleotide DSP30 and IL-2. A total of 506 CLL samples were analysed with CBA and interphase FISH using probes for the detection of trisomy 12, IgH rearrangements and deletions of 6q21, 11q22.3 (ATM), 13q14 (D13S25 and D13S319) and 17p13 (TP53). A total of 500 of 506 (98.8%) cases were successfully stimulated for metaphase generation and are subject to this study. Aberrations were detected in 415 of 500 (83.0%) cases by CBA and in 392 of 500 (78.4%) cases by FISH. CBA detected 832 abnormalities and FISH only 502. Therefore, CBA offers important information in addition to FISH. (1) CLL is characterized mainly by genomic imbalances and reciprocal translocations are rare. (2) A subgroup with complex aberrant karyotype (16.4%) is identified which is associated with an unmutated IgV(H) status and CD38 expression (P=0.034 and 0.02, respectively). (3) Additional abnormalities are detectable providing new biological insights into different CLL subclasses revealing a much more heterogeneous pattern of cytogenetic abnormalities as assumed so far based on FISH data only. Therefore, prospective clinical trials should evaluate the prognostic impact of newly available CBA data.\n\nThree newly approved drugs for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL): Incorporating ibrutinib, idelalisib and obinutuzumab into clinical practice\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSanford, David; Wierda, William G.; Burger, Jan A.; Keating, Michael J.; OâBrien, Susan M.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThree agents have received FDA approval for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) within the last year. Ibrutinib and idelalisib block B-cell receptor signaling through inhibition of BTK and PI3KÎ´ molecules respectively, interfering with several pathways required for leukemia cell survival. Idelalisib has shown efficacy in in the relapsed setting and is currently approved for use in combination with rituximab. Ibrutinib has been studied in patients with relapsed CLL and as frontline therapy. In the relapsed setting, these agents produce durable remissions, and may be preferable to retreatment with chemoimmunotherapy for many patients. Ibrutinib is also effective treatment for patients with deletion 17p and is approved as frontline therapy in this patient group, although it does not appear to completely abrogate this adverse prognostic factor. These agents have a unique side effect profile and longer follow-up is required to further understand tolerability and rare adverse effects. Obinutuzumab is a type-2 monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody which results in direct and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity of leukemia cells. It is approved in combination with chlorambucil, and has shown efficacy in the frontline setting in patients unfit for more intensive chemoimmunotherapy. It produces increased response rates and minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity in comparison with chlorambucil/rituximab and is associated with an advantage in progression free survival but not yet overall survival. These agents underscore our advancement in the understanding of the biology of CLL and will improve outcomes for many patients with CLL.

The infusion of genetically-engineered, autologous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells directed against CD19 expressed by normal and malignant B cells represents a novel approach to cancer therapy. The results of recent clinical trials of CAR T cells in relapsed and refractory CLL have demonstrated long-term disease-free remissions, underscoring the power of harnessing and re-directing the immune system against cancer. This review will briefly summarize T cell therapies in development for CLL disease. We discuss the role of T cell function and phenotype, T cell culture optimization, CAR design, and approaches to potentiate the survival and anti-tumor effects of infused lymphocytes. Future efforts will focus on improving the efficacy of CAR T cells for the treatment of CLL and incorporating adoptive cell immunotherapy into standard medical management of CLL. PMID:27040708\n\nHow I treat CLL patients with ibrutinib.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrown, Jennifer R\n\n2018-01-25\n\nIbrutinib is a transformative therapy for high-risk and relapsed refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. In clinical trials in relatively healthy younger patients, ibrutinib has been well tolerated. As its use has become more widespread in the community, however, its full adverse event profile has emerged and proven more challenging than was initially anticipated. Reports of community-based use have estimated discontinuation rates as high as 40% in the first year of therapy. This article therefore reviews my approach to the evaluation and management of a CLL patient starting on ibrutinib, with the goal of minimizing and managing toxicity to maintain patients on ibrutinib. Key topics discussed include bleeding risk; cardiac complications, particularly atrial fibrillation; drug interactions; and infections.

PAS (5-20 microM) initiated apoptosis within 24 hours, with maximal death at 48 hours asassessed by morphology, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), caspase 3 activation, and annexin V staining. PAS treatment induced Bax proapoptotic conformational change, Bax movement from the cytosol to the mitochondria, and cytochrome c release, indicating that PAS induced apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway. PAS induced approximately 3-fold up-regulation of proapoptotic Noxa protein and mRNA levels. In addition, Noxa was found unexpectedly to be bound to Bcl-2 in PAS-treated cells. PAS treatment of CLL cells failed to up-regulate p53, suggesting that PAS induced apoptosis independently of p53. Furthermore, PAS induced apoptosis in CLL isolates with p53 gene deletion in more than 97% of cells. Normal B lymphocytes were as sensitive to PAS-induced Noxa up-regulation and apoptosis as were CLL cells. However, both T lymphocytes and bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells were relatively resistant to PAS. Our data suggest that PAS may represent a novel class of drug that induces apoptosis in CLL cells independently of p53 status by a mechanism involving Noxa up-regulation.\n\nHyperdiploidy in CLL/SLL: A Rare Cytogenetic Event Associated with Poor Prognosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nDeNicola, Matthew; Pullarkat, Sheeja; Yea, Steven; Rao, Nagesh; Yang, Lynn; Tirado, Carlos A\n\n2014-01-01\n\nHyperdiploidy has been described in a variety of malignancies including acute lymphoblastic leukemia and plasma cell myeloma, in which the abnormality is associated with a very good prognosis. Herein, we describe a 61-year-old female that was diagnosed with atypical chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Initial chromosome analysis of a lymph node specimen showed an abnormal karyotype described as 46-48,XX,add(3)(q12),+16,+mar[cp3]/46,XX[1]. Chromosome analysis of the bone marrow a week later showed a pseudodiploid and normal diploid clone described as: 46,X,-X,-3,-6,+7,+9,-14,-15,+16,+17,+17,+20,-22[1]/46,XX[19]. Concurrent FISH studies of peripheral blood samples using the CLL FISH panel showed nuclei with an extra copy of chromosome 13 and an extra copy of the short arm of chromosome 17. FISH for t(11;14) was negative. These results suggest the presence of an underlying complex hyperdiploid karyotype. Hyperdiploidy is a rare event in SLL/CLL and is usually associated with a poor prognosis.\n\nFDA Expands Approval of Venetoclax for CLL\n\nCancer.gov\n\nFDA expanded the approval of venetoclax (Venclexta) for people with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) to include those whose cancer has progressed after previous treatment, regardless of whether their cancer cells have the deletion 17p gene alteration.\n\nChemokines and chemokine receptors in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL): from understanding the basics towards therapeutic targeting.\n\nPubMed\n\nBurger, Jan A\n\n2010-12-01\n\nChemokines and their receptors organize the recruitment and positioning of cells at each stage of the immune response, a system critically dependent upon coordination to get the right cells to the right place at the right time. Chemokine receptors expressed on CLL B cells are thought to function in a similar fashion, regulating the trafficking of the leukemia cells between blood, lymphoid organs, and the bone marrow, and within sub compartments within these tissues, in concert with adhesion molecules and other guidance cues. CLL cells not only respond to chemokines secreted in the microenvironment, the leukemia cells also secrete chemokines in response to external signals, such as B cell receptor engagement. These CLL cell-derived chemokines facilitate interactions between CLL cells, T cells, and other immune cells that shape the CLL microenvironment. CXCR4, the most prominent chemokine receptor in CLL, is now targeted in a first clinical trial, emphasizing that chemokines and their receptors have become a highly dynamic translational research field.

However, there are now increasingly active treatment options available for CLL patients with favorable toxicity profiles and convenient administration schedules. This raises the critical issue of whether or not attainment of cure remains a necessary goal. It is now less clear that treatment with curative intention and with significant toxicity is required for long-term survival in CLL. In addition, the demonstrated safety and activity of genetically modified chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells present the opportunity of harnessing the power of the immune system to kill CLL cells without the need for SCT. We attempt to define the role of SCT in the era of targeted therapies and discuss questions that remain to be answered. Furthermore, we highlight the potential for exciting new cellular therapy using genetically modified anti-CD19 CAR T cells and discuss its potential to alter treatment paradigms for CLL.

Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) represent the main population in CLL marrow stroma, which may play a key role for disease support and progression. In this study we evaluated whether MSCs influence in vitro CLL cell survival. MSCs were isolated from the bone marrow of 46 CLL patients and were characterized by flow cytometry analysis. Following co-culture of MSCs and leukemic B cells, we demonstrated that MSCs were able to improve leukemic B cell viability, this latter being differently dependent from the signals coming from MSCs. In addition, we found that the co-culture of MSCs with leukemic B cells induced an increased production of IL-8, CCL4, CCL11, and CXCL10 chemokines. As far as drug resistance is concerned, MSCs counteract the cytotoxic effect of Fludarabine/Cyclophosphamide administration in vivo, whereas they do not protect CLL cells from the apoptosis induced by the kinase inhibitors Bafetinib and Ibrutinib. The evidence that leukemic clones are conditioned by environmental stimuli suggest new putative targets for therapy in CLL patients.

Deletions of 17p or mutations of TP53 have been identified as one of the poorest prognostic factors, being predictive of short time for disease progression, lack of response to therapy, short response duration, and short overall survival. The treatment of patients with CLL has improved significantly with the development of chemoimmunotherapy, but this benefit was not pronounced in patients with 17p deletion. We compare various treatment strategies used in these patients, including FCR-like chemoimmunotherapy, alemtuzumab, other antibody combinations, or novel targeted therapies with promising results. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation offers the possibility for long-term disease control in these patients and should be considered early in younger, transplant-eligible patients. The current state of therapy is far from optimal and resources should be applied to studying therapeutic options for patients who have CLL with loss of p53 function.\n\nChange in IgHV Mutational Status of CLL Suggests Origin From Multiple Clones.\n\nPubMed\n\nOsman, Afaf; Gocke, Christopher D; Gladstone, Douglas E\n\n2017-02-01\n\nFluorescence in situ hybridization and immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy-chain variable-region (IgHV) mutational status are used to predict outcome in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Although DNA aberrations change over time, IgHV sequences and mutational status are considered stable. In a retrospective review, 409 CLL patients, between 2008 and 2015, had IgHV analysis: 56 patients had multiple analyses performed. Seven patients' IgHV results changed: 2 from unmutated to mutated and 5 from mutated to unmutated IgHV sequence. Three concurrently changed their variable heavy-chain sequence. Secondary to allelic exclusion, 2 of the new variable heavy chains produced were biologically nonplausible. The existence of these new nonplausible heavy-chain variable regions suggests either the CLL cancer stem-cell maintains the ability to rearrange a previously silenced IgH allele or more likely that the cancer stem-cell produced at least 2 subclones, suggesting that the CLL cancer stem cell exists before the process of allelic exclusion occurs.
