        "text": "I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 17 together.\n\nOn 3 February last, the Health Service Executive published a report, prepared by McKinsey & Co., on the delivery of tertiary paediatric services in this country. This report was commissioned by the HSE at my request in the context of decisions to be taken on the possible relocation of the facilities at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, and of ensuring that paediatric services are provided in the most efficient and effective manner.\n\nThe Mater-Children's University Hospital project was planned a number of years ago with a view to significantly improving the facilities for patients and staff at both hospitals. It was envisaged at that time that paediatric secondary and tertiary services could appropriately be provided at more than one location. However, it is clear from the recent McKinsey report that current best practice suggests that best outcomes for children should be provided by one national tertiary paediatric centre which would also provide all secondary paediatric services for the greater Dublin area.\n\nArising from the recommendations, a joint HSE-Department of Health and Children task group has been established to progress matters and to advise on the optimal location for the new facility.\n\nThe conclusions of the task group will clearly have implications for the scope of the Mater-Children's University hospital project and will inform decisions in relation to how that project is to be advanced. My primary concern is to ensure that we arrive at a solution which is in the best interests of the children of this country.\n\nThe Madden Report on Post Mortem Practice and Procedures contained 50 recommendations. Some of the recommendations, such as the formulation of human tissue legislation, are a matter for my Department. Others, such as an audit of organs retained in hospitals, are a matter for the HSE, and others fall under the aegis of other agencies, for example, the coroners legislation, is a matter for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.\n\nMy officials have met officials from the National Hospital Office, NHO, and have agreed that a national implementation group will be set up by that office to oversee implementation of the recommendations in the report. This group, on which my Department will be represented, will hold its first meeting before the end of this month.\n\nAs recommended in the report, I am establishing a working group to examine issues pertaining to non-paediatric post mortems, that is, babies who died before or at birth, minors and adults. I have asked Dr. Madden to chair the group and will be announcing the full membership shortly.\n\nIn relation to legislation, Dr. Madden's report recommended that \"communication and authorization are vital, and must be enshrined in legislation\". My officials, in consultation with key agencies, are examining the gaps in Irish legislation and they have started work on drafting legislation to address these gaps.\n\nThe heads of a Bill for a new coroners Act have been prepared by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. That Department is examining the implications, if any, Dr. Madden's recommendations will have for this legislation.\n\nEU Directive 2004/23/EC relating to standards of quality and safety of tissues and cells for human application must be transposed into Irish law by 7 April 2006. The regulations that will transpose the directive will deal with the donation of tissues and cells to another living person, but not with procurement or donation for research or clinical investigation.\n\nI recently met with representatives of BreastCheck and they are fully aware of my wish to have the programme rolled out nationally as quickly as possible. For this to happen, essential elements of the roll-out must be in place including adequate staffing, effective training and quality assurance programmes. I have made additional revenue funding of €2.3 million available to BreastCheck this year to provide among other things for the early recruitment and training of staff. BreastCheck is confident that the target date of 2007 for the commencement of roll-out to the west will be met; a more exact date for roll-out will depend on the availability of adequately trained medical and technical staff, particularly radiographers. BreastCheck recently interviewed for a clinical director for the west and is in the process of making an appointment. BreastCheck is also recruiting radiographers and a second consultant radiologist. BreastCheck also recently received planning permission for the static unit at University College Hospital Galway and is now proceeding to tender for the construction of this unit.\n\nAny proposal received by BreastCheck to support the roll-out of its screening programme is carefully examined to assess the extent to which it complies with existing standards. BreastCheck has advised my Department that it has engaged in extensive discussions with the clinic referred to by the Deputy. BreastCheck has conducted an evaluation of this proposal and has concluded that it would not be in a position to provide a population based screening programme in line with BreastCheck service standards. Discussions are ongoing involving BreastCheck and the clinic concerning other options which might enable the clinic to contribute to the introduction of the programme in the west.\n\nBreastCheck has evaluated a number of full field digital mammography systems and has decided that full digital imaging will be used in the roll-out.\n\nIn compliance with the Department of Finance reporting requirements, the Health Service Executive, HSE, provided its best estimate of the end year forecast of Exchequer issues for 2005 on 22 December 2005. This indicated a projected saving of nearly €12 million on non-capital spending and a projected saving of just over €56 million on capital spending. The projected capital saving had previously been identified to the Department of Finance and was included in the Appropriation Act 2005 as a capital carryover from 2005 to 2006.\n\nSubsequent figures submitted by the HSE to my Department on 17 January 2006 for the December 2005 returns to the Department of Finance showed an excess of €53 million on non-capital spending and a saving of over €57 million on capital. On the basis of theses figures, nearly all the capital savings would be required to offset the excess on non-capital spending. Accordingly, the Minister for Finance made no provision for a capital carryover for the HSE in the 2006 Revised Estimates for Public Services and public capital programme.\n\nThe figures provided in January are subject to further revision and the final 2005 figures will be confirmed when the HSE finalises its annual Appropriation Accounts for Vote 40. The HSE is currently working on this and the Appropriation Accounts must be finalised by the end of March. The 2006 capital allocation for the HSE will be reviewed in the light of the final outturn figures for 2005 and, if necessary, a Supplementary Estimate will be taken for 2006.\n\nAs will be apparent from the foregoing, there has been no question of an error in the HSE accounts. I am, naturally, concerned at the significant differences between the December forecast outturn figures and the January estimated outturn figures. Apart from any other considerations, it makes it more difficult to plan and manage 2006 expenditure. However, the final figures will be provided by the HSE later this month.\n\nI recognise that it will take some time for the HSE to introduce a single accounting system throughout the organisation which is capable of providing full dual accounting — the standard Vote accounts — and the income and expenditure accounts operated by the former health boards. However, I am assured by the HSE that its systems are fully capable of accounting for all transactions within the organisation and I expect to see a significant improvement this year in the quality of their in-year expenditure management returns.\n\nOn 1 February I announced, together with the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, details of a major reform programme in undergraduate and postgraduate medical education and training, based on the recommendations in the Report of the Working Group on Undergraduate Medical Education and Training, chaired by Professor Pat Fottrell, and the Report of the Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Group, chaired by Dr. Jane Buttimer. Both reports were published on that date.\n\nThe initial indicative cost of implementing the reform programme approved by the Government is estimated to be in the region of €200 million over the period 2006-10, subject to undertaking further costing studies and an audit of existing and required facilities. In particular, the overall capital requirements in the undergraduate and postgraduate areas will be the subject of detailed appraisal of existing infrastructure and future needs.\n\nAmong the major reforms to be funded at undergraduate level are: a more than doubling of the number of medical places for Irish and EU students over a four year period from 305 to 725; the introduction of a new graduate entry programme for medicine from 2007 as part of the overall expansion of places; curriculum and clinical training developments aimed at enhancing the quality of undergraduate medical education; the development of a new aptitude test for selection for graduate entry to medicine; devising proposals for a new selection mechanism for entry to undergraduate medicine to involve a combination of CAO points and suitability test performance from 2008 at the earliest; and the creation of new academic clinician posts to be jointly funded by the education and health sectors.\n\nAmong the major reforms to be funded at postgraduate level are: improved retention of graduates from Irish medical schools through a range of measures to enhance the quality and attractiveness of postgraduate specialist training; phasing out NCHD posts with limited training value within a feasible and realistic timeframe; better workforce planning to align the numbers of doctors in training with projected consultant vacancies; inclusion in the Medical Practitioners Bill of provisions to assign appropriate medical education and training functions to the HSE and, where appropriate, the Medical and Dental Councils; implementing the training principles to be incorporated into new working arrangements for doctors in training; and the development of research in the health sector.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 30, 80 and 82 together.\n\nThe report of the Lourdes Hospital inquiry, chaired by Judge Maureen Harding Clark, was published on Tuesday last. The inquiry was established by the Government in 2004 following the decision of the Medical Council to remove Dr. Michael Neary from the Register of Medical Practitioners after finding him guilty of professional misconduct.\n\nI am conscious that the last few years have been particularly difficult and traumatic for many former patients of the maternity unit at Drogheda, and yesterday I met with Patient Focus to discuss the findings of the report. The question of compensation will now be considered by my Department in the light of the report's findings and in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Finance, with a view to bringing a proposal to Government.\n\nThis is a damning report and it is clear from the findings that many lessons need to be learned and changes made to ensure that such events do not happen again in Irish hospitals. The findings and recommendations are being examined in detail by my Department which will consult with the Health Service Executive and the various professional regulatory bodies. The recommendations in the report will act as a significant catalyst in the reform agenda. They confirm the appropriateness of the actions being taken in relation to the preparation of the new Medical Practitioners Bill, the reform of the current consultant contract and the changes in management systems within hospitals.\n\nThe forthcoming Medical Practitioners Bill will make continuing professional development and education compulsory. It will also ensure that competence assurance will be given a statutory basis. Furthermore, in the context of the consultant contract talks, the management side have put forward proposals to ensure that consultants work in teams with clear clinical leaders who will ensure that individual clinical practice is in line with best practice.\n\nOne of the many disturbing findings in the report is that the obstetric hysterectomy records of 44 patients are missing and that they were intentionally and unlawfully removed from the hospital with the object of protecting those involved in carrying out the hysterectomies or in protecting the reputation of the hospital. The inquiry is satisfied that a person or persons unidentified, who had knowledge of where records were stored and who had easy access to those records, was responsible for a deliberate, careful and systematic removal of key historical records which are missing, together with master cards and patient charts.\n\nIn relation to the conclusions regarding the deliberate removal of patient records, I have invited the Garda Síochána to examine the report to determine whether further investigation is now warranted.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 78 together.\n\nIn accordance with the Nursing Homes (Care and Welfare) Regulations 1993, a provider must undertake a contract of care in regard to each dependent person and-or a person acting on his-her behalf. This is set out in paragraphs 7.1 to 7.3 of the nursing home regulations. Also, under the Code of Practice for Nursing Homes published by the Department of Health and Children, there are specific requirements in regard to a contract of care; these are set out under section 5 of the code, which is voluntary.\n\nThe HSE, when contracting beds from private nursing homes for the provision of care to clients referred by the HSE, enters into an agreement with the home in relation to all aspects of the contract and service provision.\n\nThe nursing home is required to be registered under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 and the provider must have the necessary skills, knowledge and expertise to provide appropriate care to clients referred by the HSE.\n\nThe provider must undertake, during the term of the agreement, that it will at all times provide care and welfare for each of the patients-clients identified by the HSE in proper accordance with their individual needs and requirements and, more particularly, strictly in accordance at all times with the terms, conditions and obligations contained in the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 and the Nursing Homes (Care and Welfare) Regulations 1993, as amended. Generally, prior to admission a care plan, which will specify the extent of the services required by the patient-client, must be developed by the provider in conjunction with the hospital referring each patient-client and the provider undertakes to implement same. This will include all services considered essential to the maintenance of a person in a nursing home.\n\nThe Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council, PHECC, is responsible for the development of professional and performance standards for the ambulance services and for the accreditation of institutions providing training for ambulance personnel.\n\nThe council conducts national examinations to determine if individuals have achieved the emergency medical technician-paramedic standard suitable for the awarding of the national qualification in emergency medical technology, NQEMT. It also has an assessment process for recognising equivalent qualifications obtained within and outside the State. Almost 2,000 individuals are on its database as having achieved this standard.\n\nMy Department is advised by the council that the NQEMT exceeds the emergency medical technician standards that apply in the UK, North America and Australasia.\n\nThe most significant development in the ambulance sector for many years is the roll-out of the advanced paramedic training programme. The National Ambulance Training School, which operates under the auspices of the Health Service Executive, in conjunction with University College Dublin, is providing training for advanced paramedic candidates on behalf of the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council.\n\nCurrently, emergency medical technicians can administer four drugs to treat pain, chest pain and low blood sugar levels. The programme will ensure that trained personnel can administer a range of additional medications — 19 — which include, for example, cardiac medications.\n\nThe NATS trained 36 advanced paramedics in 2005 and hopes to train a further 48 in the current year. It is envisaged that initial operational deployment of the service will commence during 2006.\n\nMy Department has allocated funding to the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council each year since 2004 to facilitate the rolling out of the training element of the programme.\n\nThe council has also recently established a professional register for pre-hospital emergency care practitioners. The register is similar to the registers already in use for other health care professionals. It is designed to ensure that everyone on the register operates under the standards and guidelines laid down by the council, that they have the skill and competency required to operate at a designated level, that they maintain their skill levels and participate in continuous professional development.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 51, 64, 68, 86 and 111 together.\n\nI am fully committed to the national roll-out of a cervical screening programme in line with international best practice to reduce incidence and mortality from cervical cancer. My Department is in detailed discussions with the Health Service Executive in relation to the most efficient and cost effective way to deliver a national programme. The plan is to have cervical screening managed as a national call-recall programme via effective governance structures that provide overall leadership and direction in terms of quality assurance, accountability and value for money. All elements of the programme — call-recall, smear taking, laboratories and treatment services — must be quality assured, organised and managed to deliver a single integrated service. I am convinced that we must also have in place tailored initiatives to encourage take up among disadvantaged and difficult to reach groups. I made available an additional €9 million to the executive for cancer services development in 2006, including the continuation of preparations for a national programme.\n\nI consider that the programme should be best rolled out in the primary care setting, subject to affordable and acceptable arrangements being agreed. A review of the contractual arrangements for the provision by general practitioners of publicly-funded primary care services is being conducted at present under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission. I have requested that the general practitioner elements of a national cervical screening programme be tabled at these discussions. Any remuneration arrangements agreed must be capable of delivering a high uptake among women. Payments must be primarily based on reaching acceptable targets. The actual costs of the programme will depend significantly on the level of primary care fees, the screening intervals agreed and maximising laboratory efficiencies, including the application of new technologies. I wish to see the programme rolled out as quickly as possible but only when the essential infrastructure, organisation and services are in place that are quality assured and meet international standards.\n\nCervical smear testing is not currently provided by GPs under the scheme for medical card holders. However, where cervical smears form part of recognised protocols for the ongoing treatment of individual patient illnesses, they should be provided free of charge to eligible women under the GMS scheme. Any necessary follow-up treatment is available to all women, including medical card holders, within the public hospital system.\n\nImplementation of the primary care strategy requires the development of new ways of working and reorganisation of the resources already available to the health service, as well as additional investment in order to provide extra capacity. This whole-system approach to implementation means change will be required in many sectors in the health service, and not solely within primary care itself. The estimated cost of implementation of the primary care strategy over an initial period of ten years is contained in the strategy document, Primary Care: A New Direction.\n\nThe strategy estimated the additional staffing costs involved, allowing for the availability of existing staff and taking account of the composition of typical core teams and the associated network professionals, at approximately €615 million per annum for the first 400 to 600 teams. The capital cost, at 2001 prices, of developing a primary care facility was estimated at some €2.5 million for each team, which is approximately €1.27 billion for the first 400 to 600 teams. The strategy also estimated that up to €63 million in once-off costs and running costs of €12.7 million per annum would be required for ICT supports.\n\nIn relation to implementation, an initial group of ten primary care teams have been established nationally, with funding to enable existing staff resources within the public system to be augmented. Funding has also been applied to a range of other initiatives intended to advance implementation. These include: planning and mapping work by the HSE; service developments in specific locations; a review of ICT needs in primary care; support to university departments of general practice and the Irish College of General Practitioners; and research fellowships in primary care.\n\nTo support further implementation of the strategy in 2006, additional revenue funding of €16 million has been provided. Of this funding, €10 million is to support the establishment of 75 to 100 primary care teams nationally. This will enable the provision of 300 additional frontline personnel to work alongside GPs to provide integrated and accessible services in the community.\n\nI have been informed by the HSE that work to establish these primary care teams in development is under way. I understand that the executive will be targeting the funding so as to provide each local health office of the HSE with the potential to develop up to three primary care teams. The executive hopes to focus where possible on areas of disadvantage and with health inequalities in planning for the establishment of these teams.\n\nA sum of €4 million has been provided for the establishment of additional GP training places and €2 million to enhance GP out-of-hours co-ops. This means that, taking into account development funding provided since 2002, €28 million is available in 2006 specifically to support the implementation of the primary care strategy. However, other development funding will also be used to support the delivery of services in line with the principles of the strategy.\n\nThe Deputy will be aware that an investment package of an additional €150 million has been put in place for services for older people and palliative care for 2006 and 2007, of which €55 million was allocated to home care packages. This is a full year cost, €30 million of which is for 2006, during which an additional 2,000 packages will be provided by the Health Service Executive across the country. Some 1,100 packages are provided at present. The priority will be older people living in the community or who are inpatients in an acute hospital who may otherwise require admission to residential care. The home care packages will also be available to those older people who have been admitted to long-term care and who now wish to return to the community.\n\nIt is envisaged that this focus on care in the community for older people will not be confined to 2006 and 2007 but represents a shift away from residential care, as a first option, that will continue into the future. The Deputy will be aware that the Mercer report on the Future Financing of Long-Term Care in Ireland, which was commissioned by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, examined all issues surrounding the financing of long-term care. Following on the publication of this report, a working group chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and comprising senior officials from the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs, was established. The objective of this group was to identify the policy options for a financially sustainable system of long-term care, including improvements in community care, taking account of the Mercer report. This group presented its report to Government, where it is under consideration.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 38, 46 and 110 together.\n\nThe Health Services Executive's National Service Plan 2006 which has been laid before the Houses of Oireachtas, states that there are 53 public acute hospitals with a total of 13,771 beds, inpatient and day places, at October 2005.\n\nAn Agreed Programme for Government includes a commitment to expand public hospital beds in line with the health strategy commitment to increase total acute hospital bed capacity by 3,000 by 2011. Substantial investment in additional bed capacity in acute hospitals has already taken place.\n\nFunding has been provided to open an additional 900 inpatient beds and day places in public acute hospitals throughout the country. The Health Service Executive has informed my Department that 818 of these beds and day places are in place and the remaining 82 beds and day places will come on stream over the coming months.\n\nIn addition, a further 450 acute beds and day places are in various stages of planning and development under the capital investment framework 2005-09. In July 2005, I announced an initiative which will provide up to an additional 1,000 beds for public patients in public hospitals over the next five years. The Estimates for 2006 include €60 million to open new acute hospital facilities some of which will provide additional inpatient beds and day places. These additional inpatient beds and day places will go some way to achieving our commitment in the programme for Government to increase total acute hospital capacity.\n\nMy Department, in conjunction with the Health Service Executive, will be reviewing public capacity requirements in the acute hospital sector in the light of developments since the health strategy was published. My Department is in discussion with the HSE on an assessment to be carried out by them regarding long-term care residential requirements for older people, including respite and intermediate care.\n\nComhairle na nOspidéal published a report of a review of neurology and neurophysiology services in April 2003. The report recommended significant enhancement of these services, including increases in consultant staffing. As part of the Estimates for health services in 2006, additional funding of €3 million was allocated specifically for the further development of neurology and neurophysiology services. My Department is advised by the executive that the development of three new neurology units will commence during 2006, one in the mid-west, one in the north west and one in the south east, with the appointment of multi-disciplinary teams comprising consultant neurologists and support staff.\n\nThe HSE will also be investing in neurophysiology services in 2006, with the development of an innovative teleneurophysiology link between Sligo General Hospital and Beaumont Hospital. This initiative is designed to reduce waiting times for diagnostic testing.\n\nThe established and agreed policy on general practitioner out of hours co-operative services is outlined in the national health strategy Quality and Fairness A Health System for You, which commits to further development of this area. The GP co-operatives provide the means for all patients, both medical card and private, to access appropriate qualified medical care out of hours, including domiciliary visits where deemed appropriate, by dialling a lo-call number. The development of GP co-operatives is being undertaken as part of the overall strengthening of primary care services available to patients and to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, patients care needs are met in the primary care setting.\n\nThe first full out of hours general practitioner co-operative began in the Health Service Executive's south eastern area in 1999 and was adjudged one of the most significant developments in the area of general practice. In 2000, this co-operative service along with that operated in the HSE's north eastern area were independently evaluated and found to be an enhancement of the care available to patients. The evaluations also found that the services provided were held in high regard by both the patient and the service provider.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2005, approximately €105 million has been provided for the development of GP out of hours co-operatives. In 2006 approximately €33 million is available to the HSE, of which €2 million is new funding in the current year. The HSE is at present giving consideration to the further developments to be undertaken on foot of this additional funding. Out of hours co-operatives are now found in part of all HSE areas, providing coverage in part or all of the 26 counties. The geographical areas to be covered by co-operatives and any expansion are decisions for the HSE to make, having regard to the strategic, financial and other issues involved.\n\nSome of the co-operatives have put in place systems to monitor the satisfaction levels of patients using the service and in others independent evaluation on customer reactions are undertaken. In the HSE's western area an independent evaluation of the co-operative, conducted by National University of Ireland, Galway, found high levels of patient satisfaction with the service provided by the doctors and recorded that 30% of survey respondents would have gone to a hospital accident and emergency unit if the service had not been available.\n\nIn the context of their operational responsibility for GP out of hours services I understand that the HSE intends to undertake a review of this service area, and that the terms of reference for this task are under consideration.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 56 together.\n\nThe Government is fully committed to the implementation of the principles contained in the primary care strategy, which provides a template for the reform and development of primary care services over a period of ten to 15 years.\n\nThe chief executive officer of the Health Service Executive has also emphasised the importance of developing primary care services, both as the appropriate service for the delivery of the majority of people's health and social care needs and to complement the services provided by acute hospitals. This is an important priority of the executive and has my full endorsement. The implementation process at operational level is a function of the HSE which, under the Health Act 2004, is responsible for the management and delivery of health and personal social services.\n\nTo support further implementation of the strategy in 2006, additional revenue funding of €16 million has been provided. Of this funding, €10 million is to support the establishment of 75-100 primary care teams nationally. This will enable the provision of 300 additional frontline personnel to work alongside GPs in order to provide integrated and accessible services in the community.\n\nI have been informed by the HSE that work to establish these primary care teams in development is under way. I understand that the executive will be targeting the funding so as to provide each local health office of the HSE with the potential to develop up to three primary care teams. The executive hopes to focus where possible on areas of disadvantage and with health inequalities in planning for the establishment of these teams.\n\nA sum of €4 million has been provided for the establishment of additional GP training places and €2 million to enhance GP out-of-hours co-ops. This means that, taking into account development funding provided since 2002, €28 million is available in 2006 specifically to support the implementation of the primary care strategy. However, other development funding will also be used to support the delivery of services in line with the principles of the strategy.\n\nWider implementation of the primary care strategy will focus on developing new ways of working and of reorganising the resources already available to the health service in line with the service model described in the strategy. This whole-system approach to implementation means change will be required in many sectors in the health service, and not solely within primary care itself.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 107 together.\n\nThe youth homelessness strategy was published on 31 October 2001. The strategy provides a strategic framework for youth homelessness to be tackled on a national basis. The goal of the strategy is \"to reduce and if possible eliminate youth homelessness through preventative strategies and where a child becomes homeless to ensure that he/she benefits from a comprehensive range of services aimed at reintegrating him/her into his /her community as quickly as possible\".\n\nUnder the strategy, the former health boards, now the Health Service Executive, had lead responsibility for implementation of the strategy and they prepared detailed action plans in this regard to address youth homelessness in line with the objectives set out in the strategy. During 2005, my Department requested the HSE to undertake a review of the action plans to ascertain the extent of their implementation. A copy of this report was received on 24 February 2006 and is under consideration by my Department.\n\nI can also advise that a considerable amount of work has been done in this area since the publication of the strategy. This work was undertaken by the youth homelessness strategy monitoring committee, YHSMC, under the chairmanship of the National Children's Office, now part of the recently established Office of the Minister for Children, and representative of the child care policy unit of my Department and other relevant stakeholders.\n\nThe committee identified key areas, which required attention in order to drive the implementation of the strategy in an effective, co-ordinated way, on a nationwide basis. A number of sub-groups were established as follows: The programme of action for children office, a unit within the HSE, agreed to take on the co-ordination and linkages functions within the HSE. The Office of the Minister for Children will continue to deal with cross-sectoral co-ordination issues.\n\nNational guidelines on leaving and aftercare were approved by the YHS monitoring committee and were circulated by my Department to the former health boards in July 2004. The purpose of the guidelines is to assist the HSE in developing its leaving and aftercare policies with the aim of, inter alia, protecting those leaving care who may be vulnerable to homelessness.\n\nThe statistics sub-group recommended the introduction of a new youth homelessness contact form as a way of gathering more reliable and consistent statistics. My Department circulated the form to the former health boards in December 2003 for introduction on 1 January 2004.\n\nThe contact form provides more information than was previously collected, and revised tables on youth homelessness are being included in the interim minimum dataset for 2004. The revised tables include new categories for reasons for homelessness such as a young person abandoned by parent or caregiver, a young person running away from care placement and family dispute or breakdown. The revised tables also examine the reason given for homelessness with the outcome, and the reason given for homelessness with the age of the young person. The full statistics for 2004 have not been compiled yet. The interim minimum dataset for 2003 provides the following reasons for children becoming homeless.\n\nA sub-group was established to look at the education and training objectives of the youth homelessness strategy. Membership of the group included representatives of the statutory and voluntary education and health sectors. It was agreed that there was a need to look at a broad understanding of the homelessness process to understand the potential impact of education and training elements as part of the solution for young people who are homeless. Consideration was given to: the preventive aspect of educational and training interventions; processes to ensure that education and training elements form part of the ongoing support of children and young people who are homeless; and the role of education and training in the prevention and reintegration of children in the care or detention systems.\n\nThe group finalised its report and it was sent to the relevant Departments, the national education welfare board and the Health Service Executive on 21 June 2005.\n\nA sub-group was established to examine information and advocacy in the context of the youth homelessness strategy, with a particular focus on making relevant information more accessible to young homeless people or young people at risk of becoming homeless. The group finalised its report and it was sent to my Department, the Health Service Executive and Comhairle on 21 November 2005.\n\nSince the publication of the youth homelessness strategy, significant progress has been made. Approximately €12 million has been allocated by the Department of Health and Children to the former health boards for the development of youth homelessness services since 2001 and 195 new whole-time equivalent posts have been filled across the Health Service Executive, up to 31 December 2004. Although these posts impact on youth homelessness services, they are not all exclusively dedicated to youth homelessness services. Some 11 new units have opened nationwide and over 42 new or extended services, including aftercare, have been developed around the country.\n\nThe Health Service Executive is responsible for the management and delivery of health and personal social services. In recent years many services have been developed to counter the problem of youth homelessness in the Dublin region. The crisis intervention service for young people out of home is based in the city centre and includes an outreach service, emergency out of hours social work service, reception centre, residential units and a day centre. A director for homelessness was appointed in the former eastern regional health authority, Health Service Executive eastern area, in 2000. I am advised that this is now the role of the national care group manager social inclusion since the establishment of the Health Service Executive.\n\nIn Cork, Liberty Street House became fully operational in 2003, and acts as a focal point for youth homelessness services in Cork. The centre provides a variety of services, including social work, medical, financial services, for young people out of home or in danger of becoming homeless.\n\nServices for homeless children are also provided by the other Health Service Executive areas and generally these are provided as part of the child protection and welfare services. The services provided include units for young people out of home supported lodgings, and the provision of out-reach, leaving and after care services.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 44, 60, 96 and 133 together.\n\nOn foot of the recommendations of the pharmacy review group, approval was given in Government decision S180/20/10/0831 of 21 June 2005 to allow my Department commence drafting new pharmacy legislation by way of two pharmacy Bills. The first Bill is to deal with fitness to practice provisions for pharmacists, the removal of the prohibition, or the derogation, on non-Irish graduates being supervising pharmacists in pharmacies less than three years old, and a stronger statutory basis for the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, PSI.\n\nThis Bill will ensure the highest standards from the profession and ensure the safe and effective delivery of pharmaceutical services to all citizens of the State. It will also update the governance of the PSI, including wider non-pharmacist representation on its council, and modernise the regulations with respect to the registration of pharmacists, including non-EU and EEA graduates while dealing with some matters concerning the delivery of pharmaceutical services in a community setting.\n\nThe second Bill is to legislate for pharmacy practice and the delivery of pharmaceutical services. This Bill will address the regulation of pharmacy and pharmacy services, including issues such as the definition of pharmacy services, the definition of a community pharmacy, enhanced provisions for the inspection of pharmacies, the provision for regulation of pharmacies in respect of matters such as physical conditions, standards, record keeping and promotional activities.\n\nIt is also proposed to deal with general provisions relating to community pharmacy contracts for services, and the remaining recommendations of the pharmacy review group. This will include the recommendation that there should be no beneficial ownership or business interest of any kind between prescribing and dispensing and, in regard to group premises with adjacent pharmacies, contracted pharmacies and general practices should occupy discrete premises, with separate entrances. The Government has accepted this recommendation.\n\nWhile I am not in a position to regulate for ownership or market share, I have agreed to consider the potential conflict of interest issues arising from the development of health centres with adjacent pharmacies, in the context of the second Bill. In the interim, my Department has advised the Health Service Executive to take due care in assessing pharmacy contract applications so that any commercial relationship between a pharmacy contractor and a health centre will not affect the proper provision of services as required under clauses 21, 22(3), 22(4) and 23 of the contract dealing with ownership of pharmacies and beneficial interest.\n\nMy Department is at an advanced stage in drawing up the heads and general scheme of a pharmacy fitness to practice Bill and I intend to take a memorandum to Government in the very near future, seeking approval for the draft heads and general scheme and requesting that the legislation be referred to the Parliamentary Counsel's office for formal drafting of the Bill.\n\nThe study to which the question refers is the Economic Burden of Cardiovascular Diseases in the Enlarged EU, by Leal J, Luengo-Fernández R, Gray A, Petersen S and Rayner M. European Heart Journal, doi:10.1093/eurheartj/ehi733.\n\nI understand that the authors set out to provide an estimate of the economic costs of cardiovascular disease for EU countries. Data were obtained from published studies of health care costs and health service utilisation. It appears that all costs for health care in Ireland were extrapolated from costs in other countries.\n\nIt is unclear how some of costs were estimated, for example, annual loss of earnings or the cost for a day's inpatient care. The data on costs and resource implications were used to estimate the costs of cardiovascular disease.\n\nGiven that the authors may have underestimated the true costs in Ireland, there are question marks about the accuracy of the overall findings as they relate to this country. It is also possible that the authors did not include the costs of services provided in the private sector.\n\nThere has been rapid expansion in cardiology services in Ireland in recent years. The cardiovascular health strategy, Building Healthier Hearts, was launched in 1999. The report makes recommendations about the prevention, treatment and surveillance of coronary heart disease across a number of sectors and the full range of health service activities, in health promotion, primary care, pre-hospital care, acute hospital services and cardiac rehabilitation.\n\nSince 2000 the Government has committed over €60 million towards the implementation of the strategy. This funding has supported a wide range of new regional services and initiatives, which have had a measurable impact on the diagnosis, and treatment of patients with heart disease. More than 800 new posts have been created, including 19 additional consultant cardiology posts.\n\nWe have made progress in addressing the key challenges in the implementation of the cardiovascular health strategy in the following areas: improving population health by supporting intersectoral work for health promotion, to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease and improve quality of life; ensuring equitable access to services by continued provision of resources and support to fully implement outstanding cardiovascular health strategy recommendations to meet the needs of the growing numbers of older people and to provide new treatments for which there is evidence of effectiveness; and improving the quality of services by developing and implementing practice guidelines, the implementation of cardiovascular health information systems, support for clinical audit and for research to enhance the quality of services.\n\nIt appears that the study may not reflect the current level of expenditure and service provision. The study is useful however in drawing to our attention the high costs of cardiovascular disease both in Ireland and at European level, not just the costs of health care but also the costs to the economy and to families and carers.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 104 together.\n\nThe report of the expert group on mental health policy, A Vision for Change, was launched on 24 January 2006. This report is the first comprehensive review of mental health policy since Planning for the Future was published in 1984 and has been accepted by Government as the basis for the future development of mental health policy. The report proposes a holistic view of mental illness and recommends an integrated multi-disciplinary approach to addressing the biological, psychological and social factors that contribute to mental health problems. It proposes a person-centred treatment approach which addresses each of these elements through an integrated care plan, reflecting best practice, and evolved and agreed with service users and their carers. Special emphasis is given to the need to involve service users and their families and carers at every level of service provision.\n\nThis policy envisions an active, flexible and community based mental health service where the need for hospital admission will be greatly reduced. It will require substantial funding but there is considerable equity in buildings and lands within the current mental health system, which could be realised to fund this plan. Therefore, this report recommends that steps be taken to bring about the closure of all psychiatric hospitals and to re-invest the resources released by these closures in the mental health service. The closure of large mental hospitals and the move to modern units attached to general hospitals, together with the expansion of community services, has been Government policy since the publication of Planning for the Future in 1984.\n\nThe programme of investment has already begun with an additional €25 million allocated to the HSE in the Estimates for 2006 for mental health services. Significant capital investment will also be required to implement A Vision for Change for the provision of new and replacement facilities for the mental health services. This has been estimated by the expert group to be of the order of €800 million and much of it could be realised from the value of existing hospitals and lands.\n\nThe Health Service Executive, which has primary responsibility for implementing the recommendations of the expert report has stated that the national mental health directorate within the HSE will immediately establish an implementation group to ensure the recommendations are realised in a timely and co-ordinated manner.\n\nThe Government has agreed the key elements of a scheme for the repayment of long-stay charges for publicly funded residential care. All those fully eligible persons who were wrongly charged and are alive and the estates of all those who were wrongly charged and died since 9 December 1998 will have the charges repaid in full. Draft heads of a Bill for a repayment scheme were submitted to Government in December and approved. The draft heads have been submitted to parliamentary counsel for drafting and it is my intention to have the Bill published in the current parliamentary session and have repayments commence shortly after the Bill is approved and signed into law.\n\nIn the preparation of the legislation there were many complex issues which required clarification. My Department had consultations with a wide range of Departments and agencies to ensure the provisions of the scheme adequately addressed these issues. These provisions included exempting from income tax those who are alive, to allow for repayments to take account of inflation by use of the consumer price index and to allow repayments to living persons and their spouses to be disregarded in means assessment for health and social welfare benefits. Consultations with the probate office of the High Court have also resulted in a streamlined process where a grant of probate is required for an application on behalf of a deceased person. The provisions of the Bill will also provide appropriate safeguards for those who are not in a position to manage their own affairs.\n\nExtensive consultation has also taken place with the oversight committee appointed to provide an independent input into the design and monitoring of the scheme. The committee is fully briefed on all aspects of the scheme and has provided valuable input into the legislative process to date. The scheme will be designed and managed with the aim of ensuring that those who are eligible for repayments receive them as soon as possible and with the minimum possible imposition in terms of bureaucracy. Priority will be given to those who are still alive. Many of those eligible for repayments have already been identified as a result of initial payments made following my announcement in December 2004. In advance of the selection of an outside company, I have requested the HSE to begin to proactively identify and work up the details of repayments due to living persons to enable prompt repayments to be made. The scheme will include an independent transparent and thorough appeals process.\n\nThe Health Service Executive has responsibility for administering this repayment scheme, including the recruitment of an outside company to manage the scheme within the agreed parameters. This outside company will also provide an independent assessment of the amount of repayment due to each applicant under the scheme. It will also help to reassure the public that the scheme is being operated in the most equitable and effective manner possible. The HSE has recently re-advertised a new procurement process for the selection of a company to administer the scheme. As the selection process is by negotiated procedure, it is not possible at this stage to indicate the expected cost of such a company.\n\nAs already indicated, the HSE is undertaking a procurement process to select this outside company. Consideration has been given to the involvement of public sector staff to assist in administering the scheme, albeit not specifically from the Department of Social and Family Affairs. The HSE has informed my Department that the time constraints of the procurement process do not allow for comprehensive consideration of these possible options, which would materially alter the specifications of the tendering documentation due to issue on 6 March.\n\nThe first part of the Deputy's question relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004. Pre-hospital emergency care services in the eastern region are provided by the executive and Dublin City Council through Dublin Fire Brigade. My Department is advised by the executive that a review of command and control arrangements in the eastern region is currently being undertaken by representatives from the executive and Dublin City Council. My Department has requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy on this matter.\n\nWith regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, additional funding of €3 million was allocated specifically for the further development of neurology and neurophysiology services as part of the Estimates for health services in 2006. This funding was provided to allow the Health Service Executive to further progress the implementation of the recommendations made by the former Comhairle na nOspidéal in respect of these services. The Comhairle report, which has been published, recommended significant enhancement of services, including the appointment of additional consultants. While reaching the full complement of consultant posts as recommended will take some time, major improvements in patient care can be achieved in the shorter term through a combination of additional consultant posts and the appointment of a number of clinical nurse specialists and allied health professionals.\n\nMy Department is advised by the executive that the development of three new neurology units will commence during 2006, one in the mid-west, one in the north west and one in the south east, with the appointment of multi-disciplinary teams comprising consultant neurologists and support staff. The HSE will also be investing in neurophysiology services in 2006, with the development of an innovative teleneurophysiology link between Sligo General Hospital and Beaumont Hospital. This initiative is designed to reduce waiting times for diagnostic testing.\n\nResponsibility for the collection and reporting of waiting lists and waiting times now falls within the remit of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF. My Department has, therefore, asked the chief executive of the NTPF to reply to the Deputy directly with the requested information.\n\nData on out-patient waiting times are not collated nationally by my Department. The management of out-patient waiting lists and waiting times is, in the first instance, a matter for the Health Service Executive and the individual hospitals concerned. However, in 2005 I asked the NTPF to examine the needs of patients waiting longest on out-patient waiting lists. As a result, the NTPF set up a number of out-patient pilot projects around the country. The outcome was that approximately 4,400 persons, who had been waiting longest in a number of specialties, received consultations at out-patient level in private hospitals. The NTPF intends to expand their out-patient initiative in 2006.\n\nWith regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, additional funding of €3 million was allocated specifically for the further development of neurology and neurophysiology services as part of the Estimates for health services in 2006. This funding was provided to allow the Health Service Executive to further progress the implementation of the recommendations made by the former Comhairle na nOspidéal in respect of these services. The Comhairle report, which has been published, recommended significant enhancement of services, including the appointment of additional consultants. While reaching the full complement of consultant posts as recommended will take some time, major improvements in patient care can be achieved in the shorter term through a combination of additional consultant posts and the appointment of a number of clinical nurse specialists and allied health professionals.\n\nMy Department is advised by the executive that the development of three new neurology units will commence during 2006, one in the mid-west, one in the north west and one in the south east, with the appointment of multi-disciplinary teams comprising consultant neurologists and support staff. The HSE will also be investing in neurophysiology services in 2006, with the development of an innovative teleneurophysiology link between Sligo General Hospital and Beaumont Hospital. This initiative is designed to reduce waiting times for diagnostic testing.\n\nI am satisfied with progress on preparedness for a possible flu pandemic and with public health actions in response to a possible outbreak of avian flu in Ireland. For the sake of clarity, H5N1 avian flu is primarily a disease of birds. To date, there have been a very small number of human cases of H5N1 infection documented, in situations where there has been very close contact with infected birds. There is no evidence of human to human transmission.\n\nThe Department of Agriculture and Food is responsible for controlling avian flu in birds and mammals other than humans. That Department has put in place a range of measures aimed at maintaining Ireland's avian flu-free status. The health sector's role with regard to avian flu relates to the human health implications that would arise were there to be an outbreak of avian flu in this country. My Department is working very closely with the Department of Agriculture and Food in this context.\n\nThe Department of Agriculture and Food is also an active participant in my Department's influenza pandemic expert group. A sub-group of the expert group has developed guidance documents for use in the event of an avian influenza outbreak in animals in Ireland. Guidance on the investigation and management of suspected human cases of avian influenza has also been developed and circulated within the health system. These guidance documents are available on the HSE health protection surveillance centre website, www.hpsc.ie.\n\nThe overall aims of influenza pandemic planning are to reduce mortality and morbidity and to minimise the resulting disruption to society. In line with information and evidence available internationally, my Department has consistently stated that the consequences of a global pandemic are likely to be serious. Pandemic planning can only mitigate the effects.\n\nI would like to draw a very clear distinction between the current avian flu outbreak and the possibility of a future pandemic influenza in the human population. Experts advise that such a pandemic may arise as a result of the current H5N1 avian flu situation, but this is by no means inevitable. My Department and the Health Service Executive are working closely together on pandemic planning. This work is ongoing on a number of fronts, as follows: the influenza pandemic expert group is updating expert guidance; the pandemic influenza operational response plan is being updated in line with the most up to date expert advice.\n\nThis work is being progressed through working or implementation groups established by the HSE to address actions within the following functional areas — surveillance, health services, public health measures, vaccines and antivirals etc., communications, laboratories and materials management. My Department is a member of the HSE steering group and is also actively involved in the vaccines and antivirals and communications groups. My Department has established a standing interdepartmental committee to consider issues which go beyond the health aspects of an influenza pandemic.\n\nArrangements have been made to procure a stockpile of H5N1 vaccine for key health care workers and other essential workers. My Department is also actively pursuing an advanced purchase order for a pandemic strain vaccine. We are stockpiling 1 million treatment packs of the antiviral drug, Tamiflu. Some 600,000 packs have already been delivered. The remaining 400,000 packs will be delivered this year. Arrangements have also been made to purchase a supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient oseltamivir phosphate powder to treat children aged between one to five years of age. Arrangements are also being finalised for the stockpiling of additional supplies of the other suitable antiviral drug, Relenza.\n\nThe Deputy's question relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive, HSE, under the Health Act 2004. Accordingly, my Department requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to arrange to have this matter investigated.\n\nThe HSE advises that it has a system in place to notify the appropriate authorities with regard to missing children or young people. The largest number of the young people reported missing were residing in the eastern region, where there is an agreed template for reporting such an occurrence to the Garda, who are responsible for investigating. This template includes a photograph and physical description. The following agencies and personnel are also notified: Garda National Immigration Bureau, which monitors overall patterns and provide relevant information to local gardaí; child care manager, for circulation to CCM colleagues nationally; supt. community welfare officer, asylum seekers unit, for flagging on the national social welfare record system; Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, for circulation to other relevant asylum process agencies.\n\nThe child's name is added to the missing persons database in the separate children seeking asylum office. In some Garda districts, there are now regular reviews of missing children. At present the majority of separated children seeking asylum are accommodated in hostel type accommodation. This type of accommodation provides full board but does not include child care supports. Staffing levels reflect the need to meet minimum standards under fire safely legislation and do not include professional child care staff as part of the contract with proprietors. The specific child care and child protection elements of the service are provided by a dedicated social work team.\n\nI can advise that, on 7 December 2005, my office met with the social services inspectorate and the HSE to discuss the issue of accommodation standards for separated children seeking asylum. It was agreed at the meeting that the standards for children in residential care will apply to accommodation for separated children 16 years of age and under. With regard to accommodation for those in the 17 to 18 year age group the same standards will apply, subject to guidance notes which are being drafted by the SSI in consultation with the HSE.\n\nI am also advised by the HSE that currently there are a number of separated children in foster care and these arrangements are very satisfactory in terms of the service provided and the level of support offered to the children who benefit from them. In most cases these placements are taken up by the youngest or otherwise most vulnerable of the client group. In addition, six children are accommodated in a fully registered children's home in Tallaght. These children are cared for by a full, professionally qualified child care staff.\n\nI wish to advise the Deputy that the HSE commissioned a review of services provided to separated children seeking asylum or unaccompanied minors in 2005. I have received a copy of this report which is under examination in my office and in that regard I have asked that an interdepartmental working group be established to consider the issues involved.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 102 and 112 together.\n\nInformation supplied to my Department by the primary care reimbursement service of the Health Service Executive, HSE, for February 2006 indicates there are 1,159,794 persons covered for services under the general medical services scheme who are medical holders, representing approximately 28% of the estimated current national population. This is 14,711 higher than the HSE's figure for January 2006, which represents December 2005 activity. A further 9,984 people currently hold general practitioner, GP, visit cards.\n\nSince 2005 I have made significant improvements to the way in which people's eligibility for medical cards and GP visit cards is assessed. In January 2005, I increased the income guidelines used in the assessment of medical card applications by 7.5%. In June 2005, I simplified the means test for both medical cards and GP visit cards. It is now based on an applicant's and spouse's income after tax and PRSI and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, child care and travel to work. This is much fairer to applicants.\n\nI announced on 13 October 2005 that the income guidelines for both medical cards and GP visit cards would be increased by an additional 20%. This means the income guidelines are now 29% higher than they were at the end of 2004. It will be noted that the income assessment guidelines based for GP visit cards are 25% higher than those used for medical cards. The HSE has publicised these changes to encourage people to apply and has made the application process as simple as possible.\n\nIn December 2005, my Department asked the HSE to take account of the welfare, taxation and other changes announced in the budget on the operation of the income guidelines and to identify any changes which may be required in order to ensure that medical cards and GP visit cards continue to be available to those who need them. The HSE has recently responded and its report is under consideration. My Department and the HSE will continue to monitor the number of cards issued and will examine any further changes to ensure the targets of an additional 30,000 medical cards and the provision of 200,000 GP visit cards are met.\n\nAs the Deputy may be aware, the national childcare investment programme from 2006 to 2010 is being implemented by the newly established office of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with special responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan. This programme builds on the success of the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-06, EOCP, which will conclude in 2007. The new programme aims to provide a proactive response to the development of quality child care supports and services that are grounded in an understanding of local child care needs.\n\nTo achieve this approach arrangements are being put in place with the city and county child care committees, CCCs, to facilitate the initial development stage of applications for grant assistance for child care facilities at local level. Both private and community-not for profit sector child care providers may apply for capital funding under the new programme by completing expression of interest forms, which will be available from their local CCCs. The CCCs will provide the necessary assistance to applicants in developing their application to the pre-appraisal stage.\n\nAt the appropriate stage in the process applications will be forwarded by the CCCs to Pobal, which administers the programme on behalf of the office of Minister of State with special responsibility for children. Pobal will carry out a technical appraisal of the applications and make recommendations to the office. Decisions on the applications will be made by the office within the Department of Health and Children.\n\nPrivate sector child care providers may apply for grant assistance of up to €100,000 towards the capital cost of developing a child care service in a catchment area where there is a demonstrated child care need. An applicant may apply for more than one grant under this scheme provided the subsequent child care facilities are in different catchment areas and subject to an overall ceiling of €500,000 per applicant. In each case, an applicant must provide at least 25% of the total cost of the project. All grant payments will be subject to the relevant criteria having been met, including demonstrated local need, quality of the proposal and value for money. Community-not for profit child care providers may apply for grant assistance up to a maximum of €1 million per project. Expression of interest forms will be available later this month. In the meantime existing applications will continue to be processed.\n\nAs the Deputy will be aware, the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 and the Nursing Homes Regulations 1993 provide for the payment of subvention for private nursing home care for applicants who qualify on both medical and means grounds. General rules for the assessment of means in respect of an application for nursing home subvention are set out in the Second Schedule of the Nursing Homes Regulations 1993 and as amended by the 2005 regulations.\n\nUnder the regulations the Health Service Executive, when considering an application for subvention, carries out a means test which takes into account the means of the applicant and his or her spouse or cohabiting partner, where appropriate, and the assets of the applicant. The means test is carried out by the Health Service Executive and involves looking at the applicant's income for the previous 12 months. Income from all sources is taken into account and is assessed net of PRSI, income tax and the health contribution and the income of a married or cohabiting person is taken to be half the total income of the couple. In assessing an applicant's assets the first €11,000 of such assets is disregarded. The HSE may refuse to pay a subvention if an applicant has assets exceeding €36,000, excluding their principal residence.\n\nOn the principal private residence of an applicant, the HSE imputes an income of 5% of the estimated market value of the principal residence of an applicant for subvention, unless the residence is occupied by a spouse or son or daughter aged less than 21 years or in full-time education or in receipt of a social welfare pension or allowance as set out in the 2005 regulations.\n\nThe HSE may refuse to pay a subvention if the value of the applicant's principal residence is in excess of €500,000 or more, where the residence is located in the Dublin area, or €300,000 or more, where the residence is located outside the Dublin area, and the residence is not occupied by a spouse, a son or daughter aged less than 21 years or in full time education, or a relative in receipt of a social welfare pension or allowance as set out in the 2005 regulations.\n\nThe report of the expert group on mental health policy, A Vision for Change, which was launched on 24 January last, outlines an active, flexible and community-based mental health service in which the need for hospital admission will be greatly reduced. Such a policy would require substantial funding. As there is considerable equity in buildings and lands in the mental health system that could be realised to fund the plan, the report recommends that steps be taken to bring about the closure of all psychiatric hospitals and to reinvest the resources released by such closures in the mental health service. The closure of large mental hospitals and the move to modern units attached to general hospitals, along with the expansion of community services, has been the policy of the Government since the publication of Planning for the Future in 1984.\n\nA Vision for Change recommends that a four-stage process be pursued to effect the closure of psychiatric hospitals. First, the measures required to enable admission to cease should be identified and put in place. Second, admissions to the hospital should be ceased and plans for the relocation of existing patients should be drawn up. Third, plans for the relocation of existing patients should be implemented. Fourth, the hospital should be finally closed. The report emphasises that the process should take place on a phased basis with wards closing sequentially. The Health Service Executive anticipates that the closure of mental hospitals and the reinvestment of the proceeds will take place on a phased basis. It has emphasised that hospitals can close when the clinical needs of the remaining patients have been addressed in more appropriate settings, such as additional community residences, day hospitals and day centres. There will also have to be a substantial increase in the number of the well-trained, fully staffed, community-based and multi-disciplinary community mental health teams, in line with the recommendation in A Vision for Change.\n\nThe Minister for Health and Children is responsible for health policy and will continue to be accountable to the Oireachtas in that regard. The Health Service Executive, which is the national body with statutory responsibility under the Health Act 2004 for the management and delivery of health and personal social services, will be involved in informing the making of policy by the Minister. The 2004 Act, which provided for the establishment of the Health Service Executive on a statutory basis, contains a number of provisions to ensure that the HSE is accountable to the Oireachtas. Under the Act, the Minister for Health and Children is required to lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas the HSE's corporate plan and service plan after he or she has approved it. The HSE's audited financial statements and annual report, as well as the report of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, must also be laid before the Houses. Under the Act the HSE's chief executive is appointed as its accounting officer. This provision requires the establishment of a separate Vote for the HSE for the purposes of the Comptroller and Auditor General Acts 1866 to 1998. Therefore, the chief executive is accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts through the Comptroller and Auditor General for the HSE's appropriation accounts. The HSE is also obliged to prepare a set of income and expenditure accounts for which it is accountable to the Dáil through the Committee of Public Accounts. As accounting officer, the chief executive will be required to attend a meeting of that committee. The 2004 Act also requires that the chief executive must attend an Oireachtas committee to give an account of the HSE's general administration, if requested to do so, and that the chief executive or any other employee of the HSE must attend an Oireachtas committee if requested to do so by the Chairman of that committee. The funding available to the HSE is determined by Government at the conclusion of the annual Estimates process. The HSE's Estimate — Vote 40 — is presented to Dáil Éireann with the Estimates of all Departments and Government offices in abridged form in November of the preceding year.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 140 and 141 together.\n\nGross current funding for the health services has increased by almost €6 billion, or 92%, over the last five years. When the increases required to fund general pay increases, benchmarking and other pay awards, non-pay inflation and increases in drugs costs are taken into account, approximately €1.8 billion has been provided for additional investment in services. The extra investment has provided for significant improvements in our health system across all of the main service areas including acute hospitals, primary care, disability, older people, mental health and child care.\n\nI will outline some of the key achievements. The key goal of the national cancer strategy, which was to achieve a 15% decrease in mortality from cancer in the under-65 age group, was achieved three years ahead of target. There have been significant increases in cancer related services, particularly day care and inpatient treatments. BreastCheck had screened approximately 185,000 women by the end of 2004. The immediate benefits of the implementation of the Building Healthier Hearts strategy are evident. I refer, for example, to the increase of 153% in certain cardiology procedures, including forms of surgery, between 1999 and 2004. There were over 1 million inpatient and day case discharges from acute hospitals in 2005. This is equivalent to the population of Dublin, or to 2,900 patients being discharged every day. Over 38,000 people have been treated under the National Treatment Purchase Fund. The number of inpatient beds and day treatment places in acute hospitals has increased by over 1,100 in the past five years.\n\nSince the end of 2001, there have been increases, in wholetime equivalent terms of 924, or 14.7%, in the number of medical and dental personnel, of 3,449, or 11%, in the number of nurses and of 4,428, or 49%, in the numbers of health and social care professionals. Some 28% of the population was in receipt of a medical card at the end of last year. All people aged 70 and over have had a statutory entitlement to a medical card since July 2001. One of the most significant developments in general practice in recent years has been the advent of out-of-hours general practitioner co-operatives, which allow medical card and private patients to access appropriate qualified medical care out of hours, including domiciliary visits where deemed appropriate, simply by dialling a lo-call telephone number. An initial ten primary care teams have been established under the primary care strategy. The allocation of additional funding for services for older people has allowed for an extra 2,000 home care packages, which constitutes a trebling of the current service. Increases in such funding have also provided for an additional 1.75 million home help hours in 2006 and in excess of 1,325 extra places per week in day or respite care centres. Some 97% of those registered in the national intellectual disability database — 24,078 people — were receiving services in 2005. The relevant figure in 2002 was 91%.\n\nThe current national development plan has provided for significant improvements in capital investment in infrastructure across all health care programmes. The new developments range from major projects to minor capital works such as refurbishment, re-equipping, maintenance and health and safety. Along with some service developments, they underpin the delivery of a modern, high-quality health service across the country. I will make some international comparisons on public health spending. In 2002, which is the latest year for which comparable data is available, Ireland's publicly funded health expenditure per capita was $1,779 in purchasing power parities. This is above the average of 14 of the 15 pre-accession EU member states surveyed in the OECD database. It ranks Ireland eighth among these 14 EU countries in terms of per capita public spending on health. Furthermore, the latest OECD figures indicate that public health expenditure as a percentage of GDP increased by 14.6% from 4.8% in 1997 to 5.5% in 2002. Based on the methodology agreed with the OECD for the calculation of comparable health expenditure statistics, however, it is reasonable to project that Ireland’s public health expenditure as a percentage of GDP for 2006 will be approximately6%, which is a significant improvement and clearly demonstrates the Government’s commitment to the health service.\n\nThe numbers of self-assessed income earners whose main source of income is from non-PAYE sources are set out as follows.\n\nYear\n\nSelf-Employed income earners\n\n2001\n\n208,100\n\n2002\n\n207,000\n\n2003*\n\n210,000\n\n2004*\n\n212,000\n\n2005*\n\n215,000\n\n* Provisional and subject to revision.\n\nThe numbers above have been rounded to the nearest 100 as appropriate. The numbers of income earners for the years 2003, 2004 and 2005 are based on actual data for 2002 projected forward in accordance with macro-economic data relating to actual and expected growth in incomes and employment. A married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.\n\nThe Revenue Commissioners do not have a policy of switching people with mixed PAYE and other income to a self-assessment basis. Whether an individual comes within the self-assessment system is determined by whether they are deemed a \"chargeable person\" under section 950 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. An individual whose income is derived solely from PAYE is excluded from self-assessment. However, an individual having both PAYE and non-PAYE income is strictly within the self-assessment system. For ease of administration, Revenue accepts that an individual whose net income from non-PAYE sources is €3,174 or less will continue to be taxed under PAYE and the non-PAYE income will be \"coded in\" against their tax credits.\n\nSection 14 of the Finance Act 2005 amended the definition of a \"chargeable person\" for self-assessment purposes. This permits Revenue the discretion to look at an individual's gross non-PAYE income when deciding on assessment status.\n\nFor the 2005 tax year and subsequent years of assessment, substantial gross income is defined as gross non-PAYE income of €50,000 or more, for example, gross income from a trade or profession, gross rental income, dividends and distributions or foreign income and so on. An individual with PAYE income who also has substantial gross income from a non-PAYE source, but where this income has been reduced to nil or to a negligible amount because of deductions, losses, allowances and other reliefs, is regarded as a \"chargeable person\" and is required to make a return under the self-assessment system.\n\nExcept as outlined above, there is no change to the practice for individuals whose main source of income is subject to PAYE but who have assessable non-PAYE income of less than €3,174. These individuals can continue to have the liability on such income effectively assessed within PAYE by means of coding in the income against their tax credits. An individual with assessable non-PAYE income of more than €3,174 for any year is regarded as a \"chargeable person\" for self-assessment purposes and must file a Form 11 for that year. There are no indications that this practice has influenced the upward trend in the number of people who are taxed under the self-assessment system.\n\nThe current scheme for tax relief on donations to approved bodies, which includes donations made to charities, is governed by section 848(a) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. The scheme was introduced in the Finance Act 2001 and claims under the scheme arose from 2002 onwards. Arrangements for allowing tax relief for donations depend on whether the donor is a PAYE taxpayer or an individual on self-assessment, or a company. For a PAYE taxpayer, the relief is given on a grossed-up basis to the approved body rather than by way of a separate claim to tax relief by the donor. For example, if an individual who pays income tax at the higher rate gives a donation of €580 to an approved body, the body will be deemed to have received €1,000 less tax of €420. The approved body, such as a charity, will therefore be able to claim a refund of €420 from the Revenue Commissioners at the end of the tax year. Similarly, if a standard rate taxpayer makes a donation of €800 to an approved body, the approved body will be able to claim a refund of €200 from the Revenue Commissioners at the end of the tax year.\n\nIn the case of a donation made by an individual who pays tax on a self-assessment basis and by companies, it is the donor and not the recipient of the donation who claims the relief. For example, if a self-assessed individual who pays tax at the higher rate gives a donation of €1,000 to an approved body, the donor will be able to claim a refund of €420 from the Revenue Commissioners at the end of the tax year. The donation can be claimed as a deduction against the individual's income from all sources. The claim to the relief is made with the individual's normal tax return. There is a presumption that potential donors will be aware of the tax relief available and how it will be applied in particular cases, and that the level of the donation will reflect that knowledge.\n\nThe following figures cover the cost to the Exchequer of the scheme for donations to approved bodies for the years 2002 to 2005, inclusive.\n\nCost to the Exchequer of tax relief on donations to approved bodies under Section 848A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.\n\nYear\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\nPAYE Donors\n\nCost to the Exchequer € million\n\n11.2\n\n21.4\n\n14.8\n\n15.69\n\nNumber of donors\n\n19,743\n\n29,626\n\n29,761\n\n46,396\n\nWith regard to figures for donations by self-assessed donors, the only data available is for the tax year 2002. In that year 5,885 self-assessed donors made claims under the terms of the scheme, at a cost of €5.1 million to the Exchequer. Preliminary information on the tax year 2003 indicates that the figures will be of a similar order. There is no evidence of a reduction in charity revenue, as suggested by the Deputy. The reduction in the amount donated in 2004 compared with 2003 is due to the introduction in the Finance Act 2003 of a maximum limit on the amount of a donation that can attract relief where the donation is made by an individual to a charity or approved body with which he or she is associated. In such a case, where the aggregate of donations to any one charity or approved body in a year is in excess of 10% of the individual's total income, the excess does not attract tax relief.\n\nThe scheme of tax relief for donations to charities and approved bodies was one of the schemes reviewed as part of the internal review of certain tax schemes carried out by my Department in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners last year. The review recommended that no change be made to the structure of the scheme at this stage.\n\nSince my appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs on 29 September 2004, I made the following board appointments. The advisory board of Ireland Aid was established in August 2002. The name of the board was subsequently changed to the Advisory Board for Development Co-operation Ireland in September 2003. In November 2005, the board was reconstituted and the following people were appointed.\n\nI appointed two new members to the advisory board in February 2006.\n\nThe development education advisory committee, DEAC, was set up in 2003 to offer policy advice to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Development Co-operation Ireland on development education and on ways to increase knowledge and understanding of development issues in Ireland. The following members were appointed to the committee in 2005.\n\n* Mercy Ebun Peters resigned on 10 January 2006 and was replaced on 23 February by Ms Angela McCormack, public relations and events management consultant.\n\nIn September 2005, I appointed Ambassador Anne Anderson, Ambassador of Ireland to France, to the Conseil d'Administration — Administration Council — of the Fondation Irlandaise, which formally administers the Irish College in Paris, in place of Ambassador MacKernan, who has since retired. In October 2004, I appointed Ms Maggie Doyle, a Paris based literary agent, to the college's board of management in place of Professor Prionsias Mac Cana, since deceased.\n\nThe Ireland — United States Commission for Educational Exchange, the Fulbright Commission, finances study, research, teaching and other educational activities between Ireland and the United States of America.

Observers also attended on behalf of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, UNHCR, a number of voluntary agencies and individuals active in the field of refugee welfare. The Refugee Agency ceased operation and was integrated in April 2001 into the Reception and Integration Agency, which operates under the aegis of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.

Her claim was disallowed from 23 February 2004 after she was found capable of work by a medical assessor of the Department. She appealed against the disallowance and she was examined by a different medical assessor who also considered her to be capable of work. Her case was then referred to an appeals officer who upheld the decision to disallow disability benefit. She was notified of this decision on 19 January 2005.\n\nThe person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 23 February 2004 until her entitlement to unemployment benefit was exhausted on 21 May 2005. She signed for unemployment credits until 29 October 2005. No application for disability or unemployment payments has been received since that date. The person concerned would not qualify for payment of disability benefit at this time as she does not have the required number of recent reckonable PRSI contributions. However, she will qualify for the award of credited contributions which could help to qualify her for benefit in the future.\n\nDisability allowance is a weekly allowance paid to people with a specified disability who are aged 16 or over and under age 66. The disability must be expected to last for a least one year and the allowance is subject to both a medical assessment and a means test. A disability allowance claim form was issued to the person concerned on 28 February 2006. To apply for same, she should complete the claim form and return it to the Department. Her case will then be examined and she will be notified of the outcome accordingly.\n\nIn the meantime, if her means are not sufficient to meet her needs, the person concerned should contact the community welfare officer at her local Health Service Executive office who will advise her of her possible entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance.\n\nThe five statutory agencies operating under the aegis of my Department are the Pensions Board, the Combat Poverty Agency, Comhairle, the Family Support Agency and the Social Welfare Tribunal. In addition, the Pensions Ombudsman comes under the remit of my Department. Appointments made to these agencies since 1 March 2001 are outlined in the following tables.\n\nThe Pensions Board was established in December 1990 under the Pensions Act 1990. The role of the board is to monitor and supervise the provisions of the Pensions Acts, as amended, relating to occupational pensions and to advise the Minister on all matters relating to its functions and on matters relating to pensions generally.\n\nName\n\nDate Appointed\n\nDermot Quigley\n\n24/09/01\n\nMichael O’Halloran\n\n01/06/02\n\nCarmel Foley\n\n01/06/02\n\nMichael McNulty\n\n16/02/04\n\nWilliam Beausang\n\n21/12/05\n\nKevin Brabazon\n\n21/12/05\n\nRosalind Briggs\n\n21/12/05\n\nRosheen Callender\n\n21/12/05\n\nJulian Caplin\n\n21/12/05\n\nMarie Daly\n\n21/12/05\n\nJohn Dillane\n\n21/12/05\n\nMary O’Donnell\n\n21/12/05\n\nEmer O’Flanagan\n\n21/12/05\n\nMichael O’Halloran\n\n21/12/05 (Reappointed)\n\nTiarnan O’Mahoney\n\n21/12/05\n\nGerry Ryan\n\n21/12/05\n\nDervla Tomlin\n\n21/12/05\n\nAnne Vaughan\n\n21/12/05\n\nMary Wade\n\n21/12/05\n\nFergus Whelan\n\n21/12/05\n\nTom Wright\n\n21/12/05\n\nThe Combat Poverty Agency was established in September 1986 under the Combat Poverty Agency Act 1986.
