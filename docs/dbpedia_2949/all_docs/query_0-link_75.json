        "text": "Pocket Pistols\n\nIn 1785 Thomas Jefferson wrote to his fifteen-year-old nephew, Peter Carr, regarding what he considered the best form of exercise: \"... I advise the gun. While this gives a moderate exercise to the body, it gives boldness, enterprize, and independance to the mind. Games played with the ball and others of that nature, are too violent for the body and stamp no character on the mind. Let your gun therefore be the constant companion of your walks.\"[1]\n\nEvidence exists to show that Jefferson himself was a fair marksman. At twenty-five he noted in his accounts: \"Won shooting 1/6.\"[2] In a later contest, during a muster of Captain Jacob Moon's Albemarle County militia company, he lost 2/6.[3] But as he grew older, Jefferson limited his exercise to horseback riding while restraining his attachment for firearms and hunting.\n\nReferences to ownership of arms and accoutrements may be found throughout his manuscripts and accounts. A cursory compilation shows that he owned a shotgun called a \"two shot-double barrel,\" purchased in France, a number of pistols, and other shoulder weapons. Further evidence that he used these may be found in the columns of his account books. In 1775 he paid to have a pistol repaired; a year later he bought a \"double barrel gun-lock\" for £5-5; in 1799 he had Henry Yost, a Staunton, Virginia, gunsmith, mend his pistols (possibly those he carried for protection when traveling) and, as late as 1817, he was charged eight dollars for having a gun put in order by a Charlottesville repairman.[4]\n\nUnquestionably, the finest arms that Jefferson owned were a pair of Turkish pistols received from the estate of General Isaac Zane in place of a monetary bequest. He described them and, at the same time, modestly alluded to his ability as a pistol shot: \"[T]hey are 20. inch barrels so well made that I never missed a squirrel 30. yards with them.\"[5]\n\n- Text from James A.

(Jefferson to Payne Todd). \"You must now accept a keep-sake from me, which may suit you as a sportsman, better than myself who have ceased to be one. I send by the stage, to be lodged for you at Orange C. H. a box containing a pair of Turkish pistols. they were originally with wheel-locks, which not being convenient, I had locks of the modern form substituted, but so that they can be changed for the former in a moment. they are 20. inch barrels so well made that I never missed a squirrel 30. yards with them. I fixed one in a wooden holster to hang in the loop of the pommel of my saddle to be handily taken out & in ... I had other holsters also made for both to hang them at the side of my carriage for road use; & with locks & staples to secure them from being handled by curious people. one of the wheel locks is a little out of order, and will require a skilful gunsmith to put to rights.\"[12]\n\n1816 December 17. \"Note he [Thomas Jefferson Randolph] has paid Garner 8.D. for having had a gun of mine repaired.\"[13]\n\n1817 January 20. \"Pd.

The other part of your request, for the use of a room for instructing them in the art of dancing, stands on more favorable ground. it's object, is the embellishment, and not the destruction, of the lives of our young citizens, and the Visitors seem to have provided for it in the statute which enacts that one of the elliptical rooms on the middle floor of the Rotunda shall be used for 'schools of instruction in drawing, music or any other of the innocent and ornamental accomplishments of life.' dancing is generally, and justly I think, considered among innocent accomplishments; while we cannot so consider the art of stabbing and pistolling our friends, or dexterity in the practice of an instrument exclusively used for killing our fellow-citizens only and never against the public enemy.\"[19]\n\nFurther Sources"
