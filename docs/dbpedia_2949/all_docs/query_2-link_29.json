Using the ARTIVIVE App, (which is completely free for the user), you can hover over a photo and an interview or clip will play over the picture. Something never done before in a James Bond-themed book.\n\nThe limited first edition book will come with 2 limited edition prints and each copy will be hand-numbered and hand-signed by the author.\n\nWith a foreword by Bond-girl Maud Adams.\n\nPrice: €65 plus shipping\n\nBooks can be bought by contacting the author at chris@distin.de and is also available on Amazon Germany."
