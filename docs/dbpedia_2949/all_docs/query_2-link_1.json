        "text": "Australian First World War poster highlighting the importance of munitions workers to the war effort. The image is divided into two by the title text in red. On the left is a scene from a munitions factory. In the background a man is working at a workbench while in the foreground another worker holds a shell. He is facing towards a scene in the upper right of the poster of two soldiers manning a field gun at the front. The layout is such that it appears the munitions worker is literally loading the gun with the shell he has just manufactured.\n\nOpening Hours\n\n10 am to 5 pm daily (except Christmas Day)\n\nIn preparation for the daily Last Post Ceremony,\n\ngalleries are progressively closed from 3:40 pm.\n\nPublic entrance via Fairbairn Avenue, Campbell ACT 2612\n\nBook your ticket to visit: awm.gov.au/visit"
