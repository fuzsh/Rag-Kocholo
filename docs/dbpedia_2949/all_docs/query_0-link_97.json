        "text": "For it’s Tommy this, an’ Tommy that, an’ “Chuck him out, the brute!”\n\nBut it’s “Saviour of ‘is country” when the guns begin to shoot;\n\nAn’ it’s Tommy this, an’ Tommy that, an’ anything you please;\n\nAn’ Tommy ain’t a bloomin’ fool – you bet that Tommy sees!\n\n“Tommy”\n\n– Rudyard Kipling\n\nMuch like the British soldier of yore, the Indian Jawan of today, and by that I mean all members of our Armed Forces, finds himself being treated in a manner not so dissimilar. Not so much by the common citizenry, who despite being ignorant of matters military and immersed in the daily grind of earning a living, continues to shower him with love and respect. But he is looked on with utter contempt and disdain by those who should know better, vast sections of all three branches of governance- the legislative, executive and judiciary.\n\nIt would also be worthwhile to remember that just like the British Tommy, he isn’t a fool either, and fully understands the chicanery being practiced on him. He is also not fooled when his deeds are praised to high heavens by politicians, especially just prior to elections or when the country is faced with an extraordinary situation that the civil administration is unable to handle, something that has been happening with unfailing regularity over the years.\n\nWhy else would disciplined and patriotic military veterans, who have sacrificed much in service of the nation, take to a relay hunger strike that has been ongoing for over 760 days and counting? Their protest against the Government’s refusal to fully honour its commitment on the award of One Rank One Pension, despite Mr. Modi’s public pronouncements to the contrary, has yet to lose steam. Their anger is further fuelled with the Government’s refusal to disseminate the findings of the One Man Judicial Commission under Justice Reddy that looked into objections raised by veterans, despite the report having been submitted as far back as 26th October last year. Obviously, the Government must have reservations with its findings and therefore has no intention of implementing it. This Government has clearly shown itself to be not just untruthful but also mean-spirited and lacking empathy. For all his political chutzpah it is surprising that Mr. Modi has brought needless opprobrium on himself. If he had fulfilled his promises in toto, at best, it may have resulted in an additional expenditure of two hundred odd Crores annually. Chicken feed, or worse still, mere peanuts, when compared to the Lakhs of Crores in loans it has promised to waive, with respect to farmers and businessmen, sections that are either vote banks or fund elections.\n\nOr take the case of the stopping of free rations for officers posted in peace stations. They were authorized free rations by the 4th CPC as an added incentive keeping in mind that due to the nature of their duty, units could be moved at short notice to remote areas where officers would find it difficult to procure rations. In its wisdom the 7th CPC recommended that this be stopped without assigning any reason. The Government while accepting this recommendation was magnanimous enough to authorize officers ration money in lieu amounting to a princely Rs 95 per day. Interestingly, while Jammu and Kashmir spends Rs 110 per day on feeding convicts, Nagaland goes one better and spends Rs 134 per day for feeding its criminal population in jail. Obviously, magnanimity for the military has a different standard.\n\nAdd to this the manner in which our Honourable Supreme Court is sparing no effort to provide “justice” to the kin of alleged terrorists and insurgents who were gunned down decades ago by soldiers. At a time when neither its’ own writ nor that of the Central or State Government ran in parts of the North East, it was these very soldiers, who at great risk and personal sacrifice, controlled the situation and made it feasible for civilian administration to reestablish itself. Thanks to the Court’s advocacy those soldiers, many of them retired, suddenly find themselves under investigation for their earlier actions. Undeniably, they will soon find themselves entangled in the web of our corrupt criminal justice system that will gorge itself on the little savings that they may have. Today, it is Manipur, can Kashmir be far behind? Retrospective justice seems a wonderful concept especially when delivered from the safety of air conditioned surroundings of Lutyens Delhi decades later, but at what cost? One cannot help but wonder as to what the Supreme Court will do if soldiers now refuse to engage militants because of the consequences they may face at a later date?\n\nOne could go on and on about the myriad odd slights meted out on almost a daily basis. No wonder then that General VP Malik, former Army Chief during Kargil, speaking at the Plenary Session of the India Ideas Conclave 2016 bluntly stated “Throughout my service, I have always believed that the man behind the gun is more important. We have to look after the man behind the gun. There has been a static erosion of soldiers’ status within the government and in society also. This is reflected in the qualitative and quantitative dilution of military rank and file. By taking away its pride, status and making career unattractive, the military is no longer a right choice today, which I believe is neither good for military nor for the nation.”\n\nOff course, the Generals’ word does not carry much weight with either the establishment or Servicemen because one cannot stand up for one’s principles retrospectively and to do so while in service requires moral courage and strength of character. We have unfortunately not produced a General Pierre de Villiers, the French Armed Forces Chief, who recently resigned after President Macron decided to cut the defence budget publicly stating that “In the current circumstances I see myself no longer able to guarantee the robust defence force necessary to guarantee the protection of France and the French people today and tomorrow, and to sustain the aims of our country.” He then reportedly told their Parliamentary Committee on Defence in far more colourful language “I won’t let myself be f****ed like that”.\n\nCan you imagine a senior flag rank officer, let alone a Chief, stand tall and speak up so bluntly? The mind boggles at the thought, more so since most of them aspire to handouts from the Government of the day in the form of a position on the Armed Forces Tribunal, a Governorship or even an Ambassadorship subsequently. Though, they may do well to remember that those Ambassadorships have routinely been held by those from either the IFS (B) feeder or the Stenographers’ cadres.\n\nLittle wonder then that even in what is clearly a jobless economy the Armed Forces continue to be deficient of nearly 15- 20% officers, with even substantial numbers of vacancies in the Training Academies going unsubscribed. What may be an even bigger headache for the government subsequently are the murmurs one is starting to hear for the need for the formation of Service Associations to look after the interest of Servicemen, something that is presently not permitted by the rules. At a time when the Nation is facing challenges, both internally and externally, it is incumbent on the Government to look into the genuine grievances of the military and take corrective action soonest. It would also do well to take the last line of Kipling’s poem seriously."
