First members of the U.S. Navy's Women's Reserve to qualify as instructors on electrically-operated .50-calibre machine gun turrets, these WAVES are now handing along their knowledge to male marksmen in the Naval Air Gunners School at Hollywood, Fla. Thus, literally 'girls behind the man behind the guns,' they deal death by proxy to the Axis when their pupils put into action the lessons they taught. Headline & text quoted from the original caption released with this photograph on 11 April 1944. Official U.S. Navy Photograph, from the collections of the Naval History and Heritage Command.",
