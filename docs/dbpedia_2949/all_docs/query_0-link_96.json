        "text": "Alfred Waud was a sketch artist who worked for Harper’s Weekly magazine at the time of the Battle of Gettysburg. This photograph creates a fascinating juxtopostion between the long-standing artform of sketching and the new technology of the day in photography. It is likely that Alfred Waud and the photograpy team of Alexander Gardner, Timothy O'Sullivan, and James Gibson crossed paths during the Civil War and were aware of each others work. This photograph may have been a professional courtesy between the \"war correspondents\" of the day.\n\nThis photograph depicts two dead Confederate soldiers in the Slaughter Pen. Years of weather and traffic have shifted some of the rocks in this area, but enough has remained unchanged that the location can be easily determined. The terms “Slaughter Pen” and “Devil’s Den” were often used interchangeably following the battle, making some photographs difficult to place based on title alone.\n\nWilliam A. Frassanito, Early Photography at Gettysburg (Gettysburg: Thomas Publications, 1995), 279-286.\n\nThis photograph, taken by Peter Weaver on November 11, 1863, depicts a group of men posing as dead soldiers among rocks in the Slaughter Pen. The two men standing are doctors, posed as if inspecting the “bodies.” The summit of Little Round Top can be seen in the distance.\n\nWilliam A. Frassanito, Early Photography at Gettysburg (Gettysburg: Thomas Publications, 1995), 294-306.\n\nThere were six separate images produced by Gardner and O’Sullivan of this “sharpshooter” on July 5 or 6, 1863. At a time when a single photograph required time and expensive materials to produce, there must have been something about this particular body which captured the photographers’ attention. Notably, the man’s youthful features and the lack of gore on the body present a somewhat sanitized and romanticized version of death at Gettysburg.\n\nLearn more about who the Confederate \"sharpshooter\" may have been on our blog.\n\nWilliam A. Frassanito, Early Photography at Gettysburg (Gettysburg: Thomas Publications, 1995), 268-278.\n\nThis photograph, taken by Alexander Gardner's assistant Timothy O'Sullivan, depicts a dead Confederate soldier at the likely location of his death on the western side of Devil’s Den. The body of this soldier would be moved by the photographers from this location to another one some 40 yards away, where he would become the subject of one of Gettysburg’s most indelible images.\n\nLearn more about who the Confederate \"sharpshooter\" may have been on our blog.\n\nWilliam A.

While the gun propped against the rock would almost certainly not have been used by a sharpshooter, nor is it likely that the soldier fell in this location, this photograph nevertheless presents a powerful narrative of the struggle in and around Devil’s Den on July 2, 1863.\n\nLearn more about who the Confederate \"sharpshooter\" may have been on our blog.\n\nWilliam A. Frassanito, Early Photography at Gettysburg (Gettysburg: Thomas Publications, 1995), 268-278.\n\nThis view of the boulders of Devil's Den shows the western slope of Little Round Top in the distance to the right. This staged photograph was taken more than four months after the battle, by Peter Weaver, on November 11, 1863 and depicts \"dead Confederates\" strewn among the rocks of Devil's Den.\n\nWilliam A. Frassanito, Early Photography at Gettysburg (Gettysburg: Thomas Publications, 1995), 294-306."
