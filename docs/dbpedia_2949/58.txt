The book 'James Bond – Golden Gun on Location' features photos from the collection of Hervé Villechaize on the sets of the James Bond film, The Man With The Golden Gun (1974).

The luxury embossed hardcover book in landscape A4 format was created by Bond fan and collector Chris Distin, and features 240 pages of never-before-seen photos in high-quality offset print, with exclusive interviews and lots of interesting information.

Hervé Villechaize played Francisco Scaramanga’s sidekick Nick Nack in the film, and went on to earn cult status as Tattoo in the US television series Fantasy Island with his signature call "De Plane, De Plane."

He was a man of many talents in front of and behind the camera which included painting and photography.

These never-before-seen photos were taken by Hervé while working on The Man With The Golden Gun, on location in Thailand, Hong Kong and Bangkok and also in Pinewood Studios in the UK, these photos show the sets from Herve‘s perspective.

The book includes photos from the world-famous spiral jump in Bond’s AMC car, to Lazar‘s armoury, there are also candid photos of the cast and crew and pictures of everyday people and everyday life in all of the locations.

This is also the first James Bond book ever to use augmented reality to give a multimedia immersive experience while reading the book. Using the ARTIVIVE App, (which is completely free for the user), you can hover over a photo and an interview or clip will play over the picture. Something never done before in a James Bond-themed book.
