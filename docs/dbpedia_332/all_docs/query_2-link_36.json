But that’s where news podcasts come in, giving listeners a detailed insight into the news, all on their own time schedule.\n\nThough they're presented by experts in their field, news podcasts aren't like just listening to the radio. Podcasts about the news tend to fall into two categories: Short-form podcasts, which are either edited from the news itself, and longer-form podcasts. These longer ones are more like features than straight news, and aim to go beyond the headlines. Ready to take the news everywhere you go? We’ve rounded up our top picks below to help you get stuck in."
