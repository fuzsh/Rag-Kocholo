        "text": "The New Faces of Abortion Rights\n\nDemocrats used to talk about abortion in abstract terms. Now Harris campaign volunteers are getting specific and changing the debate.\n\nDoes Anyone in America Miss Joe Biden as Much as Donald Trump?\n\nThe ex-President is having a very hard time pivoting to Kamala Harris.\n\nSnoop Dogg and American Attitude at the Paris Olympics\n\nAs the 2024 Games come to a close, taking stock of watching Noah Lyles, Nic Fink, Sha’Carri Richardson, and more through NBC’s lens.\n\nNancy Pelosi’s Art of Power\n\nThe former Speaker discusses how she hastened Joe Biden’s decision to drop out, her new memoir, and not getting “doggy doo-doo on your shoe.”\n\nHow Generic Can Kamala Harris Be?\n\nThe Vice-President has answered few direct questions since becoming the presumptive nominee. This is probably good for her campaign, but not for voters.\n\nIn the Age of A.I., What Makes People Unique?\n\nMore than ever, we’re challenged to define what’s valuable about being human.\n\nTrump’s Dangerous Embrace of Bitcoin and the Crypto Bros\n\nHaving suffered a series of legal and regulatory setbacks in recent years, the cryptocurrency industry is pouring millions of dollars into the upcoming election. To what end?\n\nHow “Industry” Made Prestige TV for the TikTok Era\n\nThe show is poised as the inheritor of the prestige TV mantle, but it doesn’t quite look or act like what we’ve come to expect from the genre.\n\nEpisode 1: The Green Grass\n\nA man in Haditha, Iraq, has a request for the In the Dark team: Can you investigate how my family was killed?\n\nEpisode 2: I Have Questions\n\nA trip to a Marine Corps archive reveals a clue about something that the U.S. military is keeping secret.\n\nEpisode 3: Sounds Like Murder\n\nWe travel around the U.S. to find the Marines who were on the ground in Haditha on the day of the killings.\n\nEpisode 4: What They Saw\n\nTwo conflicting stories about what happened that day emerge—one from the Marines involved in the killings, and another from a very different perspective.\n\nUnder Review\n\nPete Rose and the Complicated Legacy of Cincinnati Baseball\n\nThe culture that sheltered Rose from the fallout of his excesses did not extend the same protection to the team’s most talented Black players.\n\nThe Front Row\n\n“It Ends with Us” Showcases Blake Lively’s Wry Grandeur\n\nThis romantic adaptation of a novel by Colleen Hoover, about a businesswoman confronting a legacy of abuse, channels the moods and styles of Hollywood melodramas.\n\nOn Television\n\n“House of the Dragon” Still Hasn’t Caught Fire\n\nThe HBO show’s latest season finale reaffirms Rhaenyra’s right to rule—but her mode of noble restraint, however admirable in a leader, is lethal in a protagonist.\n\nMusical Events\n\nTwo Centuries Later, a Female Composer Is Rediscovered\n\nCarolina Uccelli’s opera “Anna di Resburgo” was remarkably inventive—but it vanished after its première. Teatro Nuovo has brought it back to life.\n\nCultural Comment\n\nHow “The Boyfriend” Distills Gay Romance\n\nThe Japanese dating show captures friendship, heartbreak, and the perils of having a hot roommate.\n\nThe Art World\n\nThe Bad Dream of Surrealism\n\nA hundred years ago, the movement hoped to topple reality and reason. Its true achievements lie elsewhere."
