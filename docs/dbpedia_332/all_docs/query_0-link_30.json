        "text": "“Bat Boy: The Musical” features book by Keythe Farley and Brian Flemming and music and lyrics by Laurence O’Keefe. Based on a story in “The Weekly World News,” “Bat Boy: The Musical” is about a half boy-half bat creature who is discovered in a cave and brought to the home veterinarian, where he is eventually accepted as a member of the family and taught to act “normal.” Bat Boy is happy with his new life, but the narrow-minded people of Hope Falls turn on him after discovering the shocking story of his unholy origin.\n\nMickey Morstad, a third-year master’s directing student, is directing “Bat Boy: The Musical” for his thesis production. “Despite the silly source material, this is a surprisingly powerful musical about trying to fit in and the tragic consequences of dehumanizing others.”\n\nLeading the cast in the role of Bat Boy is Jamie Lennon, a junior BFA theatre studies major. “It’s been an absolute blast to take on the role of Bay Boy,” Lennon said. “I’ve never taken on something like this; it’s very physically demanding.”\n\nKaeli Vondra, a freshman BFA musical theatre major, is making a debut on the Wayne S. Knutson Stage as the town veterinarian’s wife who agrees to take Bat Boy in. “This has truly been a fun and engaging experience as my first show in college,” said Vondra. “I’m excited to show everyone this crazy and lovable show.”\n\nZach Lopez, a senior BFA musical theatre major, is playing a villain for the first time in his career. “Dr. Parker has been a fun challenge for me,” said Lopez. “He does whatever it takes to get what he wants, but underneath is a person who still has motivations and feelings of guilt.”\n\nPerformances are scheduled for 7:30 p.m. April 18-20, and a matinee performance is scheduled for 2 p.m. on Sunday, April 21. Tickets are on sale now and can be purchased from the USD Theatre website.
