        "text": "Bat Boy: The Musical returns to the West End for Halloween concert\n\nFang-tastic newsðŸ¦‡\n\nThe cult classic Bat Boy: The Musical descends on the London Palladium for a Halloween concert.\n\nWith Jordan Luke Gage (Bonnie and Clyde,Heathers) appearing as fans have never seen him before in the transformational title role. Joining him in the star-studded cast are two-time Olivier Award nominee Victoria Hamilton-Barritt (Cinderella, In The Heights), Trevor Dion Nicholas (Hamilton, Next To Normal) and Jodie Steele (Bonnie and Clyde, Heathers). With more cast and creatives to be announced.\n\nEdgar (Gage) is a half boy/half bat creature who is discovered in a cave in a rural American town. The local sheriff brings Bat Boy to the home of the town veterinarian, Dr. Parker (Nicholas), where he is eventually accepted as a member of the family by the veterinarianâ€™s wife, Meredith (Hamilton- Barritt), and teenage daughter, Shelley (Steele). However, resentment and a dreadful secret about his shocking origins threaten to turn the town, and everyone he loves against him.\n\nSet against a backdrop of a small town ravaged by prejudice, the dark comedy explores themes of fear, acceptance and the consequences of othering, questioning what it means to be â€˜normalâ€™.\n\nThe rock horror musical with music and lyrics by Laurence Oâ€™Keefe (Heathers, Legally Blonde) first premiered on Halloween in 1997. Since then, Bat Boy has garnered a devoted following with its award-winning off-Broadway and West End runs and addictive soundtrack.\n\nThe producers Chris Steward and Shanay Holmes for West End Musical Productions and director Dean Johnson (Once, BKLYN) promise a dark, truthful reimagining of the musical.\n\nTo buy tickets for this halloween treat you can visit the LW Theatres website.\n\nHave a look at more shows from this year:\n\nRead more:\n\nTreason the Musical announces initial casting\n\nEmily Williams to lead The Bodyguard tour\n\nHow to listen to Magic at the Musicals"
