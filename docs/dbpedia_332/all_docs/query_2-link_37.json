Find out if his lack of experience could pose a problem.\n\nWhy it matters: Trump, himself a businessman and reality-television star before he entered the White House, announced Vance as his running mate on July 15.

So far, it has not been plain sailing for Vance, who has faced criticism for his views on \"childless cat ladies,\" suggestions that Trump is having second thoughts about him, and unsubstantiated claims that he had sex with a couch.

Immediately afterward, Lyles was seen leaving the floor of Stade de France in a wheelchair.\n\nWhy it matters: Many have questioned why Lyles was allowed to compete at all. He first tested positive Tuesday morning after winning gold in the 100-meter final, according to multiple reports. Unlike the Tokyo Olympics, where a positive Covid test would have resulted in Lyles being isolated, there are no such protocols at the Paris Games. Covid is treated like other respiratory illnesses.
