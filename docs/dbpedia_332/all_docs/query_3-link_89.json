        "text": "JEDDAH: The 2024 novel “The Coin,” is the dizzying debut of Jerusalem-born Palestinian writer Yasmin Zaher, which hones in on the female body, and is written in a stream-of-consciousness narrative style.\n\nTitled after a shekel coin the unnamed female protagonist believes she swallowed as a child, and is rusting and decomposing in her, the novel is essentially about an affluent yet displaced woman’s exploration — on her own terms — of the pain and pleasures of life.\n\nZaher writes about the unraveling, or rather the becoming, of a Palestinian woman who moves to New York City with the hope of starting life afresh as a schoolteacher.\n\nThe coin is “resurrected” here, amid the dirt and poverty that plagues the American city, which the protagonist describes as: “How could the devil be the dream?” It seems to manifest as discomfort, linking the traumas of the past to her present.\n\nThe narrator befriends a homeless, yet elegant man whom she gets embroiled with in a Birkin scam. This is an exploration of the cosmopolitan city life’s obsession with consumerism and materialism, as well as the performative and elitist nature of fashion and wealth.\n\nWith a closet full of designer pieces, the woman’s refined taste in fashion is a ruse to help her navigate societal expectations against the call of her inner self. She asks herself: “I wondered what my true essence would be, if I were solitary, in nature, untamed and unconditioned?”\n\nShe is from Palestine, which she describes as “neither a country, nor the third world, it was its own thing.”\n\nMoving to the Big Apple in pursuit of home and her ideal self, this triggers obsessive cleaning rituals because the city “embraced the dirt like it was an aesthetic.”\n\nAs a woman from a country under occupation, her own body becomes the site of power struggles, a site of cleansing rather than being ethnically cleansed out.\n\nHer protagonist says “the women in my family placed lot of importance on being clean … perhaps because there was little else they could control in their lives.”\n\nThe narrative is mercurial in its depiction of her cleansing rituals that are juxtaposed with glimmers of violent and disturbing psychopathic thoughts, making her not just an intriguing protagonist to read, but an elusive one.\n\nkeywords\n\nDUBAI: Jewelry aficionados in Jeddah now have one more reason to look elegant with the opening of a boutique by Spanish label SUAREZ in the city, marking the luxury brand’s first outpost in the Middle East.\n\nThe boutique in Khayat Center in Jeddah showcases a selection of the label’s collections, including the Tigre De Deusto collection’s tête de bœuf cut emeralds and the Sellos collection’s signature ring, which artfully combines black onyx with a central emerald-cut diamond.\n\nThe in-store offering was curated to cater to Saudi customers, Juan Suarez, Group CEO, told Arab News, before he highlighted Saudi Arabia as a “pivotal market for silent luxury\" as he explained why the country was chosen to host the brand's first Middle Eastern store.\n\n“Each piece is crafted to the highest standards of elegance and craftsmanship. We are committed to offering bespoke designs tailored to their unique preferences, ensuring that each piece holds personal significance and aligns with their individual style.”\n\nOn choosing Jeddah for the first branch in the region, the CEO said the city represents an ideal location for introducing the Suarez collection given its sophisticated clientele, retail environment and discerning customers.\n\nWhat makes the family-owned brand unique is that the owners manage every aspect of the jewellery making process, from the selection of raw materials to the design and production of each piece.\n\n“This hands-on approach ensures that our core values — legacy, craftsmanship, beauty, perfection, and truth — are upheld in every creation,” said Suarez.\n\nHe added: “Our commitment to these values aligns with the importance placed on family heritage and tradition in the Saudi market, where family influences are deeply embedded in purchasing decisions.”\n\nFor the 80-year-old brand, “entering the esteemed Saudi market is of great importance.\n\n“The opening of our boutique in Jeddah represents Suarez’s international expansion and highlights Saudi Arabia as a pivotal market for silent luxury,” said Suarez.\n\nDUBAI: What does art have to do with the Olympics? Qatar Museums, the Gulf nation’s preeminent government institution for art and culture, believes that art is a way to further spur cultural diplomacy and highlight the country’s unique heritage and cultural scene in line with its 40-year participation in the Olympics.\n\nQatar Museums is celebrating the 2024 Summer Olympics with the staging of several exhibitions and public events in Paris, including art shows, book launches and the takeover of renowned restaurant Le Dali at Le Meurice hotel on Rue de Rivoli by Jiwan, an acclaimed restaurant located within Doha’s National Museum of Qatar, highlighting the rich culinary heritage of Qatari cuisine.\n\nThe series of events also includes the launch of the first-ever Arabic translation of writings, “Textes Choisis,” by Pierre de Coubertin, the French historian and visionary widely regarded as the father of the modern Olympic games.\n\nThe project is anchored by two exhibitions curated by Qatar Museums and 3-2-1 Qatar Olympic and Sports Museum: “Olympism: More Than a Dream Exhibition,” recording 40 years of Qatar’s participation in the Olympics since 1984, which runs until Aug. 25; and “Esports: A Game Changer,” which runs until Sept. 8 at the Residence Citeaux in Paris.\n\nThe latter exhibition explores how esports relates to gaming and traditional sports. It takes a sociological look at competitive gaming, defining it in relation to traditional sports and casual gaming, while also looking at its governing organizations and economies. On view are objects and documents that trace the history of esports, including the invention of the first electronic pinball machine almost a century ago and also snapshots of several of competitive gaming’s biggest contemporary stars. The final part of the show explores the future of esports in the gaming landscape and beyond, focusing on its societal, educational, recreational and occupational impacts.\n\nOn view in the “Olympism: More Than a Dream” exhibition is memorabilia, including Qatar’s first-ever Olympic medal, a bronze won by athlete Mohammed Suleiman in the 1,500 meter-running event during the 1992 Barcelona Summer Olympics.\n\nAnother program highlight is the gold medal triumph of the “Golden Falcon,” Mutaz Barshim, who won gold in the high jump event at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.\n\n“In parallel with the Summer 2024 Olympics, the last few weeks witnessed Qatar Museums organizing a spectacular lineup of programs in Paris, affirming our longstanding commitment to cultural diplomacy and role in highlighting Qatar’s history and culture in the international arena,” Mohammed Saad Al-Rumaihi, CEO of Qatar Museums, told Arab News.\n\n“Stemming from the 2014 Cultural Agreement between Qatar and France, the summer program continues the legacy of the Qatar-France 2020 Year of Culture,” he added. “It celebrates a shared passion for sport in both countries, strengthens exchange and highlights Qatar’s offerings internationally.”\n\nThe launch of the Olympism exhibition was attended including Qatar’s Ambassador to France Sheikh Ali bin Jassim Al-Thani, Qatar Football Association President Jassim bin Rashid Al-Buenain and Vice President of the Qatar Olympic Committee Thani bin Abdulrahman Al-Kuwari, as well as the president of the Pierre de Coubertin Family Association, Alexandra de Navacelle de Coubertin.\n\nThe first part of the exhibition displays iconic Olympic artifacts from the museum’s collection, including Muhammad Ali’s left boxing glove from Rome 1960 and the Innsbruck 1964 Olympic torch.\n\nThe second part highlights key milestones in Qatar’s Olympic history, including the country’s debut at the Los Angeles 1984 Summer Olympics and strong presence at the Tokyo 2020 Games.\n\nThe rich artistic program that Qatar Museums is presenting during the Paris Olympics is organized to commemorate the Qatar-France 2020 Year of Culture, a Qatar Museums initiative, and the 2014 Cultural Agreement signed by Qatar and France.\n\nIt is also not the first time that Qatar is supporting the Olympics through culture and art. During the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Qatar presented Bayt Qatar, a hospitality house presenting live music performances, exhibitions and even an outdoor souk. In 2012, Qatar Museums staged a Heya exhibition featuring the creations of 70 Arab sportswomen.\n\nAl-Rumaihi said that these projects shed light on the unique culture of sportsmanship, highlighting “the diverse and vibrant aspects of Qatari sporting culture, and offer a unique opportunity for audiences in Paris and beyond to engage with the nation’s legacy and contemporary achievements.”\n\nDUBAI: Fans gave a warm welcome to Dubai-based Hollywood star Lindsay Lohan at Disney’s D23 fan convention at The Honda Center in Anaheim, California.\n\nOn Saturday, Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis, the stars of the upcoming “Freaky Friday” follow-up, revealed to fans for the first time the sequel’s official title, “Freakier Friday,” expected in cinemas in 2025.\n\nLohan, who wore a black and white Balmain ensemble to the event, took to Instagram to share her excitement. “What a wonderful time I had at @disneyd23 Thank you for the overwhelming response of love and excitement for FREAKIER FRIDAY,” was how she captioned her carousel images from the event.\n\nDirected by Nisha Ganatra and produced by Kristin Burr, Andrew Gunn and Curtis, “Freakier Friday” picks up years after Curtis and Lohan’s characters, Tess and Anna, first endured an identity crisis: Anna has a daughter of her own and a soon-to-be stepdaughter. As they navigate challenges that come when two families merge, they discover that lightning might indeed strike twice.\n\nIn an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Lohan also revealed that “Star Wars: Acolyte” star Manny Jacinto will play Lohan’s character’s husband in the film.\n\n“Manny is lovely. So funny,” Lohan said of her onscreen love interest.\n\nIt was also announced that original cast member Chad Michael Murray will be returning to play Jake in the sequel, fuelling fans’ excitement that they will get to see Lohan and Murray’s characters together 20 years after the original film.\n\nWhile it appears that they won’t be in a romantic relationship, Curtis teased, “Chad is in it. And boy, oh boy, is Chad in it.”\n\n“Freakier Friday” also stars Mark Harmon, Christina Vidal Mitchell, Haley Hudson, Lucille Soong, Stephen Tobolowsky and Rosalind Chao. New cast members include Julia Butters, Sophia Hammons and Maitreyi Ramakrishnan. Executive producers are Nathan Kelly, Ann Marie Sanderlin and Lohan.\n\nAside from Jacinto as Lohan’s onscreen husband, no further details have been released about the roles played by Butters, Hammons and Ramakrishnan — although it is likely at least one of them will be playing Lohan’s daughter and another one may take the part of her almost-stepdaughter.\n\nDUBAI: Saudi designer Honayda Serafi, founder of the label Honayda, made history this week by debuting at New York City’s Saks Fifth Avenue, becoming the first Saudi woman designer to be featured at the luxury department store.\n\nThe collection available at Saks is her spring/summer 2024 Cosmos release, which draws inspiration from the achievements of women in space exploration.\n\nIt showcases bright sky blues and reds, with glamorous sequins and vibrant crystals that echo the shimmering stars. Electric blue taffeta, dark magenta crepe and soft lace create a variety of textures, while body-shaping silhouettes, modernized mermaid cuts and dramatic capes add to the collection’s dynamic character.\n\nThis collection also pays tribute to visionaries such as Syrian scientist Maryam Al-Astrulabi, celebrating their contributions to history.\n\nFrom Priyanka Chopra to Lupita Nyong’o and Adriana Lima, Serafi has dressed many A-listers around the world. Since founding her label Honayda in 2016, Serafi has captured the attention of some of Saudi’s most stylish women and celebrities with her standout designs in elegant and sophisticated silhouettes.\n\nIn 2022, she became the first Saudi designer to showcase her collection at Harrods in London.\n\nOne of her achievements was designing a dress for Princess Rajwa of Jordan’s pre-wedding henna night celebration in May 2023.\n\nThe princess looked radiant in an ethereal white creation with gold embroidery that was inspired by Al-Shaby thobes of the Najd region in Saudi Arabia, where Princess Rajwa — who was formerly known as Rajwa Al-Saif — is from.\n\n“When I first got the call, I was extremely happy and proud to be part of this exceptional and historical moment. What I am especially proud of is communicating the love story between the crown prince and Rajwa in the design itself,” Serafi told Arab News at the time.\n\nIn June, Rajwa attended King Abdullah II’s silver jubilee celebrations in Amman alongside her husband, Crown Prince Hussein bin Abdullah II, in a bespoke gown by Serafi.\n\nIt was a flowy, floor-length gown in a deep red color. It featured intricate, silver embellishments along the cape-like sleeves.\n\n“As the creative director, I am deeply grateful for her trust and encouragement, which serve as a key to unlocking boundless creativity and beauty in my designs,” Serafi previously told Arab News of the continuing relationship with the royal."
