        "text": "PROVIDENCE — The Department of Theatre, Dance & Film at Providence College opens its fall semester with \"Bat Boy: The Musical.\"\n\nBased on a story in The Weekly World News, \"Bat Boy: The Musical\" is a musical comedy/horror show about a half boy/half bat creature who is discovered in a cave near Hope Falls, West Virginia. For lack of a better solution, the local sheriff brings Bat Boy to the home of the town veterinarian, Dr. Parker, where he is eventually accepted as a member of the family and taught to act like a “normal” boy by the veterinarian’s wife, Meredith, and teenage daughter, Shelley. Bat Boy is happy with his new life, but when he naively tries to fit in with the narrow-minded people of Hope Falls, they turn on him, prodded by the machinations of Dr. Parker, who secretly despises Bat Boy. Shelley and Bat Boy, who have fallen in love, run away together from the ignorant townsfolk and have a blissful coupling in the woods, but their happiness is shattered when Meredith arrives and reveals a secret. Soon the entire town arrives and hears the shocking story of Bat Boy’s unholy origin.\n\nAlongside Calitri (associate professor/managing director of theatre), members of the department and guest artists aim to make this mysterious musical a memorable experience for all who attend. Featuring musical direction by Lila Kane, scenic and lighting design by Trevor Elliot (assistant technical director), costume design by Maxine Wheelock (costume shop supervisor), lighting design by Steven McLellan, choreography by Jennifer Hopkins and hair, make-up, prosthetics and wigs by Michael Dates.\n\n\"Bay Boy: The Musical\" will be presented in the Angell Blackfriars Theatre in the Smith Center for the Arts for two weekends, running Oct. 24 to 28 and Nov. 1 to 4. Evening performances will be at 7:30 p.m. Matinees are at 2 p.m.\n\nTickets are $5 for students, $10 for seniors and PC employees, and $15 for adults.
