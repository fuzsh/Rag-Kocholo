        "text": "In our everyday lives, we often tend to think and express ourselves using negative language, the one that is filled with “don’t”, “not”, “can’t”, “won’t”, and all kinds of negative statements. Although most of us do not notice the impact of them––it’s a generations-long trend to communicate with each other––these statements affect our self-image, shape our outlook on life, and predefine our behavior. Whether you’re talking to children, colleagues, or to yourself, being able to put a positive spin on things is a skill worth having.\n\nWhy Use Positive Language?\n\nFrom childhood to adulthood, there are many benefits to using positive language. These include conveying affirmative messages (what to do versus what not to do), helping to instill a positive mindset, and improving our overall well-being.\n\nThe people who are the most aware about using positive language are customer support employees. If you’ve ever talked to a customer support representative, you could have learned a lot from that conversation without even knowing it. Their secret is the language they use. They will rarely say “I can’t help you out, I don’t have enough information”, but rather “Let me put you through to someone who can help you with this issue precisely. Thank you so much for your patience and understanding.”\n\nCan you notice the difference? Don’t worry, you don’t have to start dialing customer service numbers to learn how to speak in a positive, affirmative way. In this article, we will provide you with a detailed guide on positive language: what it is, what its benefits are, and how to use it. We will give you a number of examples and explain how they differ from negative ones.\n\nLet’s dig in.\n\nWhat Is Positive Language?\n\nWords, written or spoken, are the main form of communication for most people, while non-verbal signs such as body posture or facial expression are secondary signs that help contextualize the message. The language we use is shaped and shapes (it’s a circular relationship) our cognition and thoughts.\n\nUsing positive or negative language in our everyday talk––and also in our self-talk––defines the relationship we have with the interlocutor, and it also affects the way we think and feel about ourselves, which leads to subsequent actions.\n\nUnlike restrictive, uninformative, and limiting negative language, positive language is informative, proactive, and helpful. Here’s an overview of some of the most important differences between positive and negative language.\n\nPositive language is a technique of using positive words and affirmative forms to deliver a friendly and supportive tone to your interlocutors––be it customers, colleagues, children, family members, and, of course, yourself.\n\nThe Benefits of Using Positive Language\n\nImproved Self-Perception\n\nWhat kind of words do you use to describe yourself?\n\nDo you think more about the things that you want and can do or things that you can’t and shouldn’t? Positive language can help you improve your self-perception and rewrite your narrative in a similar way to positive affirmations.\n\nPositive words that describe your personality and abilities will help you see yourself in a more empowering, inspiring light. This will help you accept your complexes and love yourself the way you are; focus on your strong sides; understand how great is your unique personality while liberating yourself from self-limiting beliefs; and help you unleash your full potential for achieving what you truly deserve.\n\nNegative language is a part of a fixed mindset and the belief that not much can be done to improve your life and broaden your abilities. It’s based on living in a comfort zone and avoiding unpleasant and unknown experiences instead of dealing with them.\n\nPositive language supports the concepts of a positive mindset and a growth mindset and the belief that anything is possible if you work hard enough and if you have a clear idea of what to do. And that’s exactly what positive language gives you: motivation, positive self-perception, and character strength.\n\nImproved Mood and Wellbeing\n\nBecause our language impacts our thoughts, and our thoughts impact our emotions, a simple switch from negative or neutral language to positive one can do tremendous change for our mood and overall well-being.\n\nNegative language reflects a negative attitude and mood, whereas positive language communicates a supportive, confident, and cheerful attitude.\n\nInspiration for Others\n\nUsing positive language in your everyday communication can inspire others around you to think positively and work hard to achieve their goals, too. Positive language gives you a leadership role in your environment, and this type of personality becomes an inspiring role model for the people around you.\n\nWhen you communicate in a positive, uplifting, affirmative language, you not only create a friendly atmosphere and set the bright mood, you also keep people motivated and excited to help.\n\nImproved Workplace Environment\n\nPositive language at the workplace can have immense benefits on the relationship quality between colleagues, company’s mission, team effectiveness, and the connection between employers and employees.\n\nFurthermore, when you go to a job interview, the type of language you use can play a crucial role in whether you’ll be accepted or not because it reflects your intentions, enthusiasm, and eagerness to solve a certain problem. Your skillset can match the job description, but your language can reflect ambiguity, uncertainty, and a lack of initiative. Positive language, on the other hand, communicates determination, proaction, and self-confidence.\n\nIt’s “I’m not sure...”, “Well, I wouldn’t do this and that...”, “I might react…” versus “I know/I will figure out how to solve this problem”, “If you can give me an hour, I will look into this...” that makes a difference. Which ones do you choose?\n\nImproved Child-Parent Relationship\n\nBy using positive language, you are modeling positive behavior to your children. Being constantly criticized with instructions like “Stop doing that...”, “You can’t do this...”, “This is not how it’s done...”, etc. leads children to feel bad and defensive, get frustrated, confused, and lose the freedom–and curiosity–to explore this world in their own way.\n\nPositive language, on the other hand, encourages children to take responsibility for their actions, make appropriate choices on their own and boost their self-esteem. It allows children to focus and learn from the positive behaviors instead of focusing on negative ones.\n\nExamples of Positive Language\n\nChoosing the right words, both spoken and written, and communicating them in the way that motivates and inspires action can turn any difficult conversation and challenging situation into something good. Positive language isn’t about staying away from negative, difficult topics or sharing unpleasant news with a forced smile–it’s about using language that reassures, inspires, and gives alternatives.\n\nLet’s look at these examples.\n\nTips for Implementing Positive Communication\n\nYou’ll need to be very focused and mindful of the words you use on a daily basis in order to restructure your language. You can start by avoiding negative words and rephrasing certain statements like “No problem!” or “I can’t find it!”. Soon enough, as your mind slowly rewires for positivity, you’ll start using positive language naturally.\n\nWhile some elements will take a little practice, especially your speech given its fast and sometimes spontaneous pace, here are some simple tips you can implement right away:\n\nReword phrases that have negative words like “can’t”, “won’t”, “don’t”, “stop”, “shouldn’t” and also those beginning with negative prefixes such as -un, -in, -ir ( (inconvenient, unpleasant, incompetent, irresponsible, etc).\n\nWhen communicating that something can’t be done, instead of apologizing, offer an alternative. This helps the conversation move forward and creates a solution-oriented atmosphere.\n\nKeep an attitude of gratitude and notice the small things even in unpleasant situations. When faced with negative feedback or feeling stuck, search for an opportunity to grow. This will help you maintain a bright, positive tone and outlook.\n\nUse kind words––they serve as tension breakers. In the same way, saying compliments, expressing gratitude, or asking someone what you can do to make a situation better can go a long way.\n\nKeep your body language positive. Smile when you are talking and maintain an open body posture. When you are feeling stressed, do some breathing exercises to calm yourself down, try to keep your body relaxed, and speak slowly (otherwise, your interlocutor will feel stressed and anxious as well)."
