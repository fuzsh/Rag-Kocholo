Bat Boy is happy with his new life, but when he naively tries to fit in with the narrow-minded people of Hope Falls, they turn on him, prodded by the machinations of Dr. Parker, who secretly despises Bat Boy. Shelley and Bat Boy, who have fallen in love, run away together from the ignorant townsfolk and have a blissful coupling in the woods, but their happiness is shattered when Meredith arrives and reveals a secret. Soon the entire town arrives and hears the shocking story of Bat Boy's unholy origin.\n\nFull Story (from Wikipaedia)\n\nAct I\n\nIn the fictional town of Hope Falls,Â West VirginiaÂ three teenageÂ spelunkers; Ron, Rick and Ruthie Taylor discover the Bat Boy, a deformed humanoid creature. Bat Boy attacks Ruthie and is taken captive by Rick and Ron (âHold Me Bat Boyâ).\n\nRuthie is taken to the hospital and the Bat Boy is placed in the care of Sheriff Reynolds who brings him to the home of local veterinarian Dr. Parker. Meredith, Parkerâs wife, agrees to take him in (âChristian Charityâ).\n\nShelley, the Parkers' teenage daughter, is repulsed by the Bat Boy and infuriated by his constant screaming but Meredith pities him and christens him with a new name; Edgar (âUgly Boyâ). Rick Taylor, Shelleyâs boyfriend, arrives and, infuriated by Edgarâs presence, threatens to kill him with a knife (âWhatcha Wanna Do?â). This upsets Shelley and Meredith makes Rick leave. Meredith attempts to comfort Edgar (âA Home For Youâ).\n\nMeanwhile, the Mayor of Hope Falls and the local ranchers are worried by their cattle which are dying inexplicably. The rumours of the discovery of a Bat Boy lead them to believe he must be preying on the cattle (âAnother Dead Cowâ).\n\nDr. Parker returns home and is about to euthanize Edgar when Meredith intervenes. Meredith begs Parker not to kill Edgar and he consents when she agrees to sleep with him. Parker celebrates what he sees as an upturn in his failing marriage and feeds Edgar animal blood (âDance With Me Darlingâ).\n\nAt the hospital Ruthie is delirious from her injuries, but her mother promises the Sheriff will kill the Bat Boy or be fired (âMrs. Taylorâs Lullabyâ).\n\nWith the help of Meredithâs patient teaching and Dr. Parkerâs secret feedings of blood Edgar learns speech, etiquette and how to dress and obtains a high-school equivalency diploma (âShow You A Thing or Twoâ).\n\nThe town council implore Dr. Parker to prevent the reviled Edgar from attending the upcomingÂ revival meeting. Parker protests, insisting Edgar is not a threat to anyone, but is pressured into giving his word that Edgar will not attend the revival (âChristian Charity (Reprise)â)\n\nEdgar begs the Parkers to let him go to the revival (âA Home For You (Reprise)â) and Meredith eventually relents. Incensed by Meredith undermining his word, Dr. Parker grabs her aggressively and Edgar instinctively attacks him. Meredith runs to comfort Edgar over her husband, leaving Parker humiliated and furious. Parker begins to devise a way to destroy Edgar and save his marriage to Meredith; he taunts a hungry Edgar with a live rabbit and Edgar struggles with his feral urges to kill. Just as it seems Edgar is overcoming his hunger, Parker draws blood from the rabbit and Edgar eats it. Parker gives Ruthie Taylor a lethal injection in her hospital room, intending to blame her death on Edgar (âComfort and Joyâ).\n\nAct II\n\nAt the revival meeting Reverend Hightower offers a faith healing (âA Joyful Noiseâ). Meredith, Shelley and Edgar arrive and Edgar volunteers himself for the faith healing. The town are disgusted by his presence but Edgar implores them to accept him (âLet Me Walk Among Youâ). The townsfolk are won over by Edgarâs eloquence and civility and embrace him (âA Joyful Noise (Reprise)â).\n\nDr. Parker arrives at the revival and reveals Ruthie has died, blaming her death on Edgar. The townsfolk are furious and, once again, turn on Edgar. In the ensuing struggle Edgar attacks Rick Taylor; under the pretense of tending to his wounds Dr. Parker administers Rick with a lethal injection to serve as further proof that Edgar is dangerous. The townsfolk form a mob, led by Parker, and pursue Edgar into the woods.\n\nIn the woods Shelley and Meredith look for Edgar. Together they decide that they will run away from Hope Falls and Dr. Parker. Shelley tells Meredith she is falling in love with Edgar and Meredithâs horrified response causes Shelley to run away deeper into the woods (âThree Bedroom Houseâ). There she meets Edgar and the two comfort each other and confess their love for each other. The Greek God of natureÂ PanÂ arrives to preside over the union of Edgar and Shelley, with the help of the woodland creatures (âChildren, Childrenâ).\n\nRon Taylor, determined to get revenge for his brother and sister, searches the slaughterhouse for Edgar. The mob mistake the noise coming from the slaughterhouse as a sign of Edgarâs presence and Mrs. Taylor sets fire to the slaughterhouse, inadvertently burning her remaining child to death. The Sheriff asks Doctor Parker to placate the mob but, instead, he whips them into a bloodthirsty frenzy and the hunt for Edgar resumes (âMore Blood/Kill The Bat Boy!â).\n\nBack in the woods Edgar is hungry for blood and begs Shelley to leave him for her own safety. Instead Shelley offers her arm to Edgar for him to feed on (âInside Your Heartâ). Just as he is about to bite, Meredith arrives and reveals she is Edgarâs mother.\n\nOvercome with grief and shame Edgar kills a cow and runs away to the cave where he was discovered. Incensed at Dr. Parkerâs betrayal and Meredithâs deceit, Edgar pledges to kill the pair of them and embrace his inner beast (âApology To A Cowâ).\n\nThe mob arrives at the cave as do Parker and Meredith. Together they reveal to the town that Edgar was the result of an experiment gone wrong; a young Parker accidentally spilled a prototype pheromone on Meredith which caused him to go mad and sexually violate her. As Meredith ran home in tears, the pheromone also attracted a colony of bats that violated her as well. Nine months later she gave birth to Shelley and Edgar. Repulsed by the deformed Edgar, Meredith asked Parker to kill him, but he could not and instead left him at the mouth of the cave where the bats adopted him.\n\nEdgar begs Parker to kill him, but he cannot; so Edgar reveals that he slept with Shelley. Furious and overcome with grief Parker slits his own throat causing Edgar to leap upon him and feed, whilst Parker stabs him in the back. Meredith tries to intervene but is stabbed as well and the three fall to the ground, dead (âFinale: I Imagine Youâre Upset/I Am Not A Boyâ).\n\nIn the aftermath Shelley and the townsfolk reflect on the tale and the lessons they have learned (âHold Me Bat Boy (Reprise)â).\n\nMusical Numbers\n\nREVIEW SCORECARD\n\nrave\n\n-\n\nfavourable\n\n1\n\nmixed\n\n2\n\nunfavourable\n\n5\n\npan\n\n8\n\nACT ONE\n\nHold Me, Bat Boy - Full Company\n\nChristian Charity - Sheriff, Meredith, Shelley\n\nUgly Boy - Shelley\n\nWatcha Wanna Do? - Rick, Shelley\n\nA Home For You - Meredith, Bat Boy\n\nAnother Dead Cow - Townsfolk\n\nDance With Me, Darling - Parker\n\nRuthie?s Lullaby - Mrs. Taylor\n\nShow You a Thing or Two - Full Company\n\nChristian Charity (Reprise) - Sheriff, Parker, Townsfolk\n\nA Home for You (Reprise) - Bat Boy\n\nComfort and Joy - Full Company\n\nACT TWO\n\nA Joyful Noise - Rev.
