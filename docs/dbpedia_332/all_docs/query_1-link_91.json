        "text": "Bat Boy: The Musical is a ridiculous, heartfelt musical comedy/horror show about a half-boy, half-bat. Based on a June 23, 1992 “true story” in the Weekly World News about a half-boy, half-bat, dubbed “Bat Boy”, who grew up living in a cave in the West Virginia Hills, and then brought into the sleepy town of Hope Falls, which intrigues the inhabitants. Even though Bat Boy is taught to act like a “normal” boy, will his happiness be shattered when the town discovers the shocking secret of his unholy origin?\n\n#batboy\n\n30 minutes before showtime. ALL late seating is at the discretion of the house manager and is not guaranteed once the performance has begun.\n\nJoin us year round by getting season tickets for our Mainstage and Stage 2 shows. Pick and choose which shows you want to see, or get a golden ticket and come to every event!"
