        "text": "Our new Digital 2022 Global Overview Report – published in partnership with We Are Social and Hootsuite – reveals that most of the connected world continues to grow faster than it did before the pandemic.\n\nBig stories in this year’s report include:\n\nDouble-digit growth in social media users\n\nBig gains for YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok\n\nNew insights into the world’s social media preferences\n\nThe rise of social commerce\n\nSignificant increases in the cost of social media ads\n\nSome uncomfortable truths about advertising\n\nWe’ve also got a look back at the first ten years of the Global Digital Reports series.\n\nAt almost 8,000 words, this article’s a bit of a beast, so get yourself comfortable, and prepare for a full-on feast of facts and figures.\n\nBest-in-class data\n\nAs always, I’d like to start by saying a very big thank you to the world-class data partners who’ve made this year’s reports possible, especially:\n\nGWI\n\nStatista\n\nGSMA Intelligence\n\nApp Annie\n\nSemrush\n\nSimilarWeb\n\nLocowise\n\nSkai\n\nImportant notes\n\nJust before we get into the numbers, I’d like to encourage all readers to review our detailed notes on data, to understand how changes in data sources and methodologies may impact this year’s numbers.\n\nAlerts to highlight include:\n\nInternet users: delays in reporting due to COVID-19 may mean that figures for “year-on-year change” represent change over periods of more than one year.\n\nSocial media users: big changes in platform reporting mean that various numbers included in this year’s reports are not directly comparable with figures for the same data points featured in our previous reports. Where we’ve been able to calculate representative growth figures, we’ve included those growth figures within this year’s reports, but where we haven’t included growth figures, it’s likely that any comparisons with historical data will deliver incorrect values. As a result, please avoid comparing social media users and advertising audience figures in this year’s reports with figures published in our previous reports.\n\nBut without further ado, let’s dive into the data…\n\nTop 10 takeaways\n\nI’d recommend starting with this video, which offers a handy summary of this year’s essential headlines and trends.\n\nOnce you’ve finished watching that, read on below for the full report.\n\nA decade of digital growth\n\nThis year marks the tenth anniversary of the first global report in our Global Digital Reports series, so we can now look back over a full decade of digital data.\n\nIf you’d like to indulge in a bit of nostalgia, you can find our first Global Overview Report here, while all subsequent reports in the series are also available in our free library.\n\nYou can also find my comprehensive analysis of key trends over the past decade in this in-depth article.\n\nNote that considerably more data is available today than it was at the time we produced many of our earlier reports though, so some of the figures I’ll cover below may not match those that we published in previous reports.\n\nInternet user growth\n\nKepios analysis reveals that internet users have more than doubled over the past 10 years, climbing from 2.18 billion at the start of 2012 to 4.95 billion at the start of 2022.\n\nThat results in a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.6 percent for the past decade as a whole, but – as you can see in the chart below – annual growth rates have fluctuated meaningfully from one year to another.\n\nHowever, anyone who had been wavering about joining social media before the pandemic struck would have been most likely to join during the early days of lockdown in 2020, so I’m hesitant to attribute any meaningful share of growth over the most recent 12 months to some kind of “COVID effect”.\n\nMoreover, with social media users now equating to 58.4 percent of the world’s total population, we should expect to see growth rates start to decelerate over the next few years, and this may well be the last time that we report double-digit annual growth in social media users.\n\nThe good news is that we should see social media users reach the equivalent of 60 percent of the global population sometime in 2022 though, so even if growth rates do subside, the overall reach potential of social media should still offer plenty to get excited about.\n\nDig deeper: click here to learn more about what future digital growth rates might look like.\n\nEver fewer offline, but big challenges remain\n\nData reveal that the number of people who remain “unconnected” to the internet has now dropped below 3 billion for the first time.\n\nThis marks a significant milestone in the world’s journey towards equal digital access, and has particular relevance as the role of connected devices has moved from luxury to lifeline, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHowever, the latest data also reveal that there’s plenty more work to do.\n\nMore than 1 billion people remain offline across Southern Asia, while almost 840 million people are yet to come online across Africa.\n\nMeanwhile, despite accounting for roughly 1 in 5 of the world’s connected population, China is still home to more than 400 million of the world’s “unconnected”.\n\nFurthermore, the excellent State of Mobile Internet Connectivity 2021 report from GSMA Intelligence reveals that 1 in 4 people across lower- and middle-income countries is still unaware of the existence of mobile internet.\n\nIn other words, hundreds of millions of people around the world may still not even know that the internet exists.\n\nSo, while the UN may have designated internet access a “basic human right”, there’s still a long way to go to ensure that everyone has equal access to what is arguably the most important innovation of our age.\n\nRelated: click here to learn more about the world’s top motivations for going online.\n\nInterestingly, WeChat gains enough votes to rank fourth at a global level, despite a whopping 99 percent of the platform’s votes coming from users within Mainland China.\n\nChina is home to roughly 20 percent of the world’s total internet users though, so it’s perhaps unsurprising that the country’s social media users have such a big impact on these global rankings.\n\nHowever, you may be more surprised to see TikTok gain just 4.3 percent of the total vote.\n\nThat doesn’t quite match the excitement TikTok generates in the media, but it’s worth noting that the number of people choosing TikTok as their favourite social platform has jumped by 71 percent in the past 90 days, and TikTok’s overall share of the vote has increased by 180 basis points in just 3 months.\n\nFurthermore, App Annie reports that TikTok was the most-downloaded mobile app in 2021, and the platform continues to enjoy strong growth in ad reach too (more on that below).\n\nFor context, if we assume that the average person sleeps for roughly 7 to 8 hours per day, the typical internet user now spends more than 40 percent of their waking life online.\n\nThe amount of time we spend online continues to climb too, with the daily average increasing by 4 minutes per day (+1.0 percent) over the past year.\n\nThat may not sound like a big increase, but added up across all of the world’s internet users, those 4 extra minutes per day will equate to more than 5 billion additional days of internet use in 2022.\n\nIn total, the latest numbers suggest that the world will spend more than 12½ trillion hours online in 2022 alone.\n\nAs with most data points in our Global Digital Reports, however, there are considerable differences in time spent by geography.\n\nSouth Africans now spend the greatest amount of time online each day, with the country’s working-age internet users saying that they spend an average of 10 hours and 46 minutes using connected tech every day.\n\nFilipinos, Brazilians, and Colombians aren’t far behind, with the average internet user in those countries each spending more than 10 hours per day online.\n\nAt the other end of the scale, Japanese users spend the least amount of time online each day, with the national average still below 4½ hours per day.\n\nIt’s also interesting to note that China sits quite far down these rankings, with the country’s internet users saying they spend an average of 5 hours and 15 minutes per day online.\n\nSocial media time by platform\n\nBut how does that social media time break down by platform?\n\nWell, the good news is that the wonderful folks at App Annie have shared some great data with us this year that reveals how much time people spend using the Android apps of several top social platforms.\n\nFor context, handsets running Android account for roughly 7 in 10 smartphones in use around the world today, so – while these figures may not include all social media users – they still provide rich insights into how the world actually uses social media platforms.\n\nOverall, App Annie’s data shows that YouTube accounts for the greatest total time spent using social media apps on Android phones, and it also clocks the highest average time per user.\n\nApp Annie’s research indicates that the typical YouTube user now spends almost a full day – 23.7 hours – per month using YouTube’s mobile app, but remember that the platform likely also sees meaningful activity on its website, as well as via embeds on third-party websites.\n\nFacebook comes second in terms of total, cumulative time spent using social media apps, with Android users averaging 19.6 hours in the platform’s app each month.\n\nTikTok users also clock in an average of 19.6 hours per month using the TikTok Android app, but because the platform has fewer overall users, TikTok only comes fifth in these rankings by cumulative time spent across all users.\n\nWhatsApp comes third in terms of total time spent, with users spending an average of 18.6 hours per month using the messenger app on Android phones.\n\nInstagram ranks fourth, but users spend considerably less time using the app each month compared with the rest of the top 5, at just 11.2 hours per month.\n\nAt 11.6 hours per month, LINE also sees impressive average use rates, but with considerably fewer users overall, it only places ninth in the global rankings by total time spent.\n\nFor context, average monthly time per user has remained relatively stable across Facebook, YouTube, and WhatsApp over the past year.\n\nMeanwhile, the time spent using Instagram has increased by 10 percent year on year, equating to almost 1 additional hour of use per month.\n\nHowever, TikTok has seen the biggest gains across the top 5 over the past 12 months.\n\nTikTok’s users now clock in an extra 6 hours and 20 minutes per month using the platform’s Android app compared with this time last year, equating to a year-on-year increase of 48 percent.\n\nIt’s important to stress that these figures vary considerably by geography though, and local rankings can look quite different to this global picture.\n\nDig deeper: Explore local data for time spent across the top 5 platforms in the full Digital 2022 report.\n\nFacebook is still the most-used social platform\n\nInsights into people’s “favourite” platforms and the time they spend using each one are perhaps the most representative data points for marketers preparing a social media plan.\n\nHowever, active user numbers still provide valuable benchmarks, especially when it comes to understanding a platform’s momentum.\n\nData published in Meta’s Q3 2021 investor earnings announcement confirms that Facebook is still the world’s most-used social media platform, with 2.91 billion users as of October 2021 (the latest “official” figure at the time of writing).\n\nFacebook’s monthly active user base grew by a solid 6.2 percent (+170 million users) over the past year, despite already reaching more than half of its total potential audience by age and accessibility (note that Facebook is still blocked in China).\n\nYouTube has closed the gap with Facebook over the past year though, with the platform’s audience growing almost twice as fast as Facebook’s.\n\nYouTube now has at least 2.56 billion active users, which equates to roughly 88 percent of the latest Facebook total.\n\nHowever, note that the figures we publish for YouTube are based on the platform’s ad audience, whereas the figures for Facebook represent total monthly active users.\n\nMeta hasn’t published any official updates to global WhatsApp user numbers in the past year, but it’s likely that the platform still ranks third, with at least 2 billion active users per month.\n\nInstagram ranks fourth at a global level, and has seen some of the fastest growth of any platform in the past year (you’ll find more detailed analysis of Instagram’s growth later in this article).\n\nWeChat closes out the top five, with China’s favourite social media platform now claiming 1.26 billion monthly active users.\n\nHowever, all eyes will doubtless be on TikTok, which currently sits in sixth place in these active user rankings.\n\nBytedance announced that the platform had passed 1 billion monthly active users back in September 2021, but the company has been characteristically tight-lipped since then, so that figure remains the latest “official” number.\n\nHowever, it’s worth noting that TikTok’s active user base roughly doubled between December 2019 and September 2021, and with the platform still claiming top spot in the global app download charts, it’s almost certain that TikTok’s monthly active users continue to grow (more on that below).\n\nMeanwhile, Meta hasn’t published an “official” monthly active user (MAU) number for Messenger since September 2017, so we’ve decided to use the platform’s latest ad audience reach figure in these rankings, instead of that older MAU headline.\n\nNote that LinkedIn doesn’t publish active user numbers, which is why we’re unable to include it in this list.\n\nDig deeper: stay up to date with all the latest social media stats via our dedicated platform pages.\n\nTikTok’s rapid rise continues\n\nTikTok’s ad audience also continues to grow at an eye-watering pace.\n\nThe latest figures published in Bytedance’s advertising resources indicate that TikTok’s ad reach increased by 60 million users (+7.3 percent) in just the past 90 days, taking worldwide ad reach to roughly 885 million by the start of 2022.\n\nHowever, it’s important to stress that this figure doesn’t include users below the age of 18, who likely make up a sizeable share of the platform’s total active user base [note: due to what the company describes as “data security requirements”, Bytedance’s tools only show ad reach data for audiences aged 18 and above, although marketers can still target ads to users aged 13 and above].\n\nThe latest data suggest that TikTok has been adding an average of more than 650,000 new users every day over the past 3 months, which equates to almost 8 new users every second.\n\nSocial media for work\n\nGWI’s latest numbers show that almost 1 in 4 internet users aged 16 to 64 now uses social media for work-related activities.\n\nHowever, this figure is considerably higher across many developing economies.\n\nAt the top of the scale, more than 4 in 10 working-age internet users in Kenya (41.5 percent) say that they use social media for work-related research.\n\nFilipinos and South Africans are also considerably more likely to use social media for work than the global average, with more than one-third of internet users aged 16 to 64 in both countries saying that social media plays a role in their professional activities.\n\nSocial media’s role in the marketing mix\n\nDespite those rising ad costs, marketers will be reassured to learn that new research confirms the effectiveness of social media advertising.\n\nGWI’s latest data reveals that more than 1 in 4 internet users aged 16 to 64 (27.6 percent) discover new brands, products, and services via social media ads, which is only slightly less than the figure for TV ads (31.1 percent).\n\nSearch engines are still the top source of new brand discovery for the world’s internet users though, with 31.7 percent of GWI’s sample saying that they’ve learned about new brands via an online search.\n\nMeanwhile, word-of-mouth recommendations also rank highly for brand discovery, so marketers may want to re-examine how easy it is for audiences to share their brand and its various online presences via messenger apps like WhatsApp and Telegram.\n\nAt the better end of the scale, GWI reports that people in China are the most likely to say that they feel represented in ads, with just over 1 in 4 (26.8 percent) answering in the affirmative.\n\nHowever, just 1 in 9 Americans has a similar perspective, and the figure drops to just 1 in 11 for people in the UK.\n\nJapan sits at the bottom of the rankings, with just 1 in 24 respondents in the country saying that they feel represented in the ads that they see – and this despite Japanese brands spending more than USD $47 billion on advertising in 2021.\n\nHowever, this poor result may in part be due to Japan’s high median age.\n\nIndeed, GWI’s data highlight the fact that – all over the world – older people feel particularly detached from advertising, with just 1 in 9 global internet users aged 55 to 64 (10.8 percent) saying that they recognise themselves in the advertising that they see.\n\nBut therein lies one of the many challenges in interpreting and acting on this data.\n\nShould advertising actually reflect the audience that it’s aimed at, or should it offer an alternative perspective (e.g. a more “aspirational” lifestyle)?\n\nThis is one of the more contentious questions in marketing, and – sadly – there are no simple answers.\n\nThe best advice I can offer is to invest both time and resources in understanding not only what your specific audience’s life looks like, but also in understanding people’s hopes, dreams, and fears.\n\nConventional research will be an invaluable tool here, and many of the data partners featured in this year’s reports will be able to help.\n\nSimilarly, while social listening may not make the media headlines it used to, I firmly believe that regular social listening can provide some of the most powerful insights into what people actually care about.\n\nSo, as you put the finishing touches to those 2022 plans, be sure to put aside some time and money for active exploration of what matters to your audiences, and what “ad representativeness” might look like on their terms.\n\nRelated: learn about the latest cultural themes shaping advertising effectiveness in We Are Social’s Think Forward 2022 report.\n\nThere’s some more optimistic news for travel brands in this year’s data, too.\n\nOnline travel revenues remain considerably lower than they were in 2019, but consumer spending has increased steadily over the past 12 months.\n\nStatista’s Mobility Market Outlook reports that global online spend on flights grew by USD $11 billion (+6.8 percent) in 2021, reaching a total of USD $173 billion for the year.\n\nThe value of online hotel bookings has increased even faster though, with global revenues up by 45 percent compared with last year.\n\nThe world spent $142 billion on online hotel bookings in 2021, with annual revenues increasing by USD $44 billion compared with the overall total for 2020.\n\nSocial commerce takes off\n\nNew additions to this year’s reports include figures for ad reach on Facebook Marketplace and Instagram Shop.\n\nThese figures only represent the number of users that marketers can reach with ads in these environments, and they may not represent the full extent of each environment’s total active user base.\n\nIndeed, Meta reports that more than 1 billion Facebook users access Marketplace each month, so there seems to be quite a big gap between total Marketplace users, and the share of those users that sees ads within Facebook’s commerce environment.\n\nHowever, this gap exists across other Meta products too, and our analysis suggests that Facebook’s overall ad reach only equates to about 72 percent of the platform’s total monthly active user figure [find some potential explanations here].\n\nWhat’s more, these Marketplace and Instagram Shop figures still tell a compelling story, and further demonstrate that social commerce has already gained rapid momentum.\n\nFor example, ads in Facebook Marketplace now reach more than 560 million users each month, equating to more than a quarter of the platform’s total ad reach.\n\nIn line with overall platform demographics, Facebook Marketplace attracts a larger male audience, with men accounting for 55 percent of the Marketplace audience.\n\nHowever, the more interesting finding is that the Marketplace audience tends to be considerably older than the Facebook audience as a whole.\n\nUsers over the age of 35 account for more than half (50.9 percent) of Marketplace’s global ad audience, yet they account for just 40.9 percent of Facebook’s overall ad audience.\n\nNote that Facebook limits use of Marketplace to users aged 18 and above, which explains why figures in the lowest age bracket are so low.\n\nThat may not sound like a huge amount, but to put those figures in context, worldwide consumer spend on mobile apps now equates to roughly 0.2 percent of total global GDP.\n\nWhat’s more, these revenue figures only include transactions made directly through app stores, and don’t include things like ecommerce purchases made via mobile apps, or mobile ad revenues.\n\nConsumer spending on apps continues to increase too, with 2021 revenue increasing by almost 19 percent compared with the total for 2020.\n\nAdditional data: find more great mobile insights in App Annie’s excellent State of Mobile 2022 report.\n\nNote that Ookla recently changed its focus from mean speeds to median speeds though (click here to understand the difference), so these latest numbers aren’t directly comparable to the figures we featured in previous reports.\n\nHowever, this change in metrics doesn’t detract from the overall story: mobile connections are getting much faster, much more quickly.\n\nThis trend will be of particular interest to futurists, because faster mobile data speeds may also help to accelerate developers’ ability to deliver engaging AR, VR, and broader metaverse experiences via mobile connections.\n\nCryptocurrencies are particularly popular across developing economies, especially in countries where conventional currencies are more prone to big fluctuations in exchange rates.\n\nFor example, in Turkey – where the local lira has lost roughly half of its value versus the US dollar over the past year – ownership of cryptocurrencies has almost doubled (+86 percent) in the past twelve months, from 10 percent to 18.6 percent.\n\nHowever, “crypto” ownership is still heavily male skewed, and older audiences are also underrepresented.\n\nFewer than 1 in 20 internet users aged 55 to 64 owns any cryptocurrency today, and this finding may have important implications for policy makers exploring the potential for digital currencies.\n\nDig deeper: learn more about cryptocurrency trends in GWI’s excellent Connecting the Dots report.\n\nLooking ahead: digital in 2022\n\nThat’s almost all for my analysis of this year’s Global Overview Report, but here are a few things to look out for over the coming months:\n\nWe should pass the momentous 5 billion internet user milestone in time for our next quarterly Statshot report. To celebrate, we’ll offer a bumper collection of insights into how the internet impacts daily lives around the world, so be sure to check back for that analysis in late April.\n\nWe may see some turbulence in the world of decentralised finance (DeFi) over the next few months, with the value of cryptocurrencies continuing their wild swings. Moreover, with ever more people investing in these “alternative” financial instruments, we can expect calls for greater regulation, more stringent government oversight, and – almost inevitably – new forms of taxation.\n\nAt the same time, while the underlying tech is undoubtedly here to stay, people will come to realise that NFTs are nothing more than certificates of digital ownership, and – ultimately – it’s the assets they represent that determine their actual value. As a result, I hope we’ll see the NFT conversation shift away from irrational speculation, and put greater emphasis on helping the world’s creators derive enduring value from their hard work. If that shift doesn’t happen soon, I fear NFTs will go the same way as ICOs.\n\nFollowing the success of Squid Game, Money Heist, and Lupin, expect the unexpected when it comes to digitally distributed culture. Streaming platforms make it easier than ever for great content to travel around the world in an instant, fuelled by the social media water-cooler and ever more accurate algorithms. As a result, tomorrow’s big hits are just as likely to come from Hanoi and Harare as they are to come from Hollywood.\n\nWe’ll start to see greater convergence across digital activities, with formats like Live Commerce blending the best of social media, entertainment, and online shopping. Similarly, as faster mobile connections and more powerful mobile devices become ever more accessible, we can expect more immersive content experiences. In particular, I’m expecting to see AR find its way into rich music ‘experiences’ (well beyond music videos), while a handful of brands will also move beyond hype and hot air to deliver some truly compelling experiences in online virtual worlds.\n\nHopefully that’s given you more than enough to think about, but just in case you’re already craving your next fix of facts and figures, you might like to know that I’ll be back in a couple of weeks with the first of our Digital 2022 local country reports, which we’ll start publishing in mid-February.\n\nAnd finally…\n\nI suspect you’ve only made it this far because you’re anxious to find the latest updates in one of our most thought-provoking datasets, so I won’t leave you disappointed.\n\nRegular readers will be pleased to hear that the battle for the internet continues, but – for the third year in a row – data suggests that dogs may once again have had the upper hand paw in 2021.\n\nTo date, users have published more than 330 million posts to Instagram tagged with #dog, compared with just 257 million posts tagged with #cat.\n\nThese figures reveal that Instagram has seen an impressive 38 million new #dog posts since our 2021 report, but just 27 million new posts for #cat.\n\nHowever, canines’ dogged success over the past year isn’t just down to the #dogsofinstagram.\n\nA similar pattern has played out on TikTok, where #dog posts now exceed 205 million, compared to just 137 million for #cat posts.\n\nIn a more encouraging finding for the felines, Twitter users appear to have become a little less extreme in their animal views over the past year, but dog lovers still outnumber cat lovers on the platform by a factor of almost 4 to 1.\n\nDogs are clearly more salient in the zeitgeist too, with Google Trends data revealing that the world’s internet users searched for dogs twice as often as they searched for cats during 2021.\n\nHowever, despite these valiant canine capers, cats still rule the web: Google returns more than 2.83 billion pages for “cat” today, compared with just 2.4 billion for “dog”.\n\nDon’t hate the messenger."
