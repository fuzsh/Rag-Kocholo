        "text": "Choose an accessible design template\n\nIf you're creating an email using a third-party platform such as MailChimp or Constant Contact, select a design template that is simple and flexible. One- or two-column layouts are preferred, as they're easier to read on multiple devices. If needed, use images and design elements to enhance your email, but be careful to avoid distracting animations or chaotic designs.\n\nAvoid tables for layout\n\nTables as a layout component can be very confusing for users reading with assistive technology. Instead design your email using native tools like text and columns to create the layout. Content should be responsive and follow a logical order of elements when read. If you must use tables for layout, add the attribute <table role=\"presentation\"> on every table element to ensure screen readers won’t treat them as data tables.\n\nWhen you embed an image in an email, it’s important to remember that many people turn images off in their email clients for privacy reasons or bandwidth issues, and people with vision impairments might not be able to view the image. If the image conveys meaning, information, or even a feeling or tone, it needs to have alternative (“alt”) text that displays if the image doesn’t load or isn’t visible.\n\nIn this example, an email is shown with images enabled and displayed on the left, and images disabled and not displayed on the right. Because there was no alt text added to the image, the email does not contain any content when images are not displayed.\n\nAlt text should be concise and descriptive, but shouldn’t duplicate the text in the body of the email. Learn more about writing effective alt text.\n\nHow to add alt text in email\n\nOutlook: Right-click on the image and select “Edit Alt Text…”\n\nMailChimp: Add alt text in the legacy email builder or new email builder\n\nGmail: After adding an image, your image options will be displayed directly below the image. Select \"Edit alt text\" to add.\n\nKeep in mind...\n\nIf there is text embedded on an image (like in a banner or event poster), the text should also be present either in the email body text or in the alt text."
