        "text": "The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Department of Theatre will present “Bat Boy: The Musical,” a satirical comedy/horror spoof based on a 1992 tabloid headline, April 17-21, 2013.\n\n“Bat Boy: The Musical” was chosen by Theatre UAB to provide students in the growing department more performance opportunities, says Theatre Department Chair Kelly Allison, M.F.A. Guest director Jimmy Kontos leads the 17-member cast, with many playing more than one part. Ripped from the 1992 World Weekly News tabloid headline, “Bat Boy: The Musical” is a big-hearted satire on American prejudice. When a half-boy/half-bat creature is discovered in a cave near fictional Hope Falls, W.Va., a local veterinarian’s wife teaches him to act like a “normal” boy. However, the citizens of Hope Falls are not so quick to accept Edgar the Bat Boy, prompting a chain of absurd situations and shocking revelations, all set to a peppy, melodic pop-rock score with fantastic costumes. The play features a book by Keythe Farley and Brian Flemming, with music and lyrics by Laurence O’Keefe. “Bat Boy: The Musical” contains mature subject matter, comic gore/violence and sexual content.\n\n“Bat Boy: The Musical” will be performed at 7:30 p.m. April 17-20, and at 2 p.m. April 21, in UAB’s Alys Stephens Performing Arts Center, Sirote Theatre, 1200 10th Ave. South. General admission tickets are $12-15, student tickets are $6 and UAB employee and senior citizen tickets are $10. Call 205-975-2787 for tickets.\n\n“Bat Boy” is a unique example of the quirky blend of comedy and darkness which has become increasingly more prominent in contemporary American musicals, says Assistant Director Jeff Horger. “It is a semi-serious cautionary tale set against the surreal backdrop of the most definitively rural town in America. Whether you heed the warnings about the dangers of social norms and mass prejudice or you simply like jokes about cows, we hope you enjoy watching this production as much as we enjoy performing it.”\n\nThe near all-Alabama cast includes Russell Alexander II of Montgomery as Bat Boy; Garan Tinsley of Collinsville as Dr. Thomas Parker/Ensemble; Sarah Pullen of Huntsville as Meredith Parker; Rebecca Harper of Valley Head as Shelley Parker; Taylor Richardson of Corner as Mrs. Taylor/Reverend Hightower/Ensemble; Ellis Oswalt of Anniston as Rick Taylor/Ensemble; Blake Tanner of Corner as Ron Taylor/Doctor # 2/Ensemble; Leah Hudspeth of Hoover as Ruthie Taylor/Ensemble; Terrance Campbell of Leeds as Bud/ Ensemble; Ross Collier of Hoover as Sheriff Reynolds/Ensemble; Tony Morse of Huntsville as Pan/Mr. Dillon/Doctor/Ensemble; Aly Merrell of Leeds as Mayor Maggie/Ensemble; Allison Shackelford of Birmingham as Daisy/Ensemble; Alora King of Boonsboro, Ma., as Clementine/ Ensemble; Ali Ribe of Birmingham as Lorraine/Ensemble; Lynne Kerr of Huntsville as Rowena/Ensemble; Amyna Price of Philadelphia, Penn., as Nedine/Ensemble."
