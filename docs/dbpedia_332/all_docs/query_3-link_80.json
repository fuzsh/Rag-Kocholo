Researchers now show that a 40-year-old mathematical ...\n\nResearchers have demonstrated that ferromagnetism, an ordered state of atoms, can be induced by increasing particle motility and that repulsive forces between atoms are sufficient to maintain it. The ...\n\nResearchers have discovered a unique property, the quantum metric, within magnetic materials, altering the 'electron universe' geometry. This distinct electric signal challenges traditional ...\n\nA sensing technology that can assess the quality of components in fields such as aerospace could transform UK ...\n\nThe Takagi--Sugeno (T--S) fuzzy descriptor system offers a promising avenue for controlling non-linear systems but lacks optimal control strategies. Moreover, while robust control methods have been ...\n\nLittle progress had been made in solving Ramsey problems since the 1930s. Now, researchers have found the answer to r(4,t), a longstanding Ramsey problem that has perplexed the math world for ...\n\nA powerful new tool in artificial intelligence is able to predict whether someone is willing to be vaccinated against ...\n\nExisting ship control systems using Model Predictive Control for Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) do not consider the various forces acting on ships in real sea conditions. Addressing this ...\n\nThrough steady advances in the development of quantum computers and their ever-improving performance, it will be possible in the future to crack our current encryption processes. To address this ...\n\nWhen you teach a child how to solve puzzles, you can either let them figure it out through trial and error, or you can guide them with some basic rules and tips. Similarly, incorporating rules and ...\n\nA new safety-check technique can prove with 100 percent accuracy that a planned robot motion will not result in a collision. The method can generate a proof in seconds and does so in a way that can ...\n\nSolving arithmetic problems, even simple subtractions, involves mental representations whose influence remains to be clarified. Visualizing these representations would enable us to better understand ...\n\nA new mathematical model has shown, with great precision, the impact that physiological and psychological parameters have on running performance and provides tips for optimized ...\n\nThe tone and tuning of musical instruments has the power to manipulate our appreciation of harmony, new research shows.
