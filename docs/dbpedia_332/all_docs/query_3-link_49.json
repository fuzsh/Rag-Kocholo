        "text": "I think there is a misconception about singing: that you should be able to sing naturally without training and all you need is talent, that you’re either a Singer or you’re not. I disagree with that. Talent always helps, and there is such a thing as God-given talent when it comes to singing.\n\nBut there are only so many Barbara Streisands of the world–meaning, people who can open their mouths and sing with ease. And even someone like Barbara Streisand has dealt with major stage fright in her life, so perhaps that could have been something she could have worked on with a Vocal Coach.\n\nWhat I see is, there are two kinds of people. There’s this first kind of Singer who wants to sing because they love to sing and it’s a hobby or passion. I see a lot of students who stopped singing when they were young because their parents were like, “You can’t do this for your career,” so they gave up and became Lawyers or Doctors and all that.\n\nThen when they get to about 45-years-old, even 50-years-old, they feel the ticking of time going by and realize they really, really miss singing. It’s an outlet for their creativity, their emotions, all that good stuff. They want to bring that joy back into their life through music. So getting into voice lessons is great for them, because a lot of the time what happens with people who haven’t sung for many years is they have a lot of emotional baggage when it comes to singing.\n\nWhen they work with a Coach, that Coach (if they’re a good Coach) helps them get rid of the weeds; helps them imagine themselves as Singers again. That person may never be Celine Dion — and that person usually doesn’t want to be. They don’t have a delusion that they’re gonna do this for their careers. They just really want to sing again.\n\nHaving a Voice Teacher and a weekly discipline is great. People do all kinds of fun things to express themselves. People take pole classes. They do aerial yoga. They jump out of planes. Voice lessons are that thing for people who want to bring singing back into their lives. Getting back into voice lessons and just singing again is usually a wonderful thing.\n\nThen you have the other department, usually younger people, who want to become professional Singers and build their careers. There’s this misconception that you should be able to open your mouth and instantly be Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande, or Whitney Houston. In voice lessons, you should be working on your technique.\n\nYoung people hear the word technique and go, “Ahhh!” like I’m telling them to do their homework. In my teaching practice, I make sure that when I’m doing exercises with young students, they understand why they’re doing it.\n\nIn my young singing life, I had Teachers I was afraid of. They would say, “You’re going to do this and you’re going to sing this song.” I never felt like it was okay for me to say, “I don’t like that song,” or, “What’s the purpose?” I think it’s really important for young people, especially when they’re working on their technique, to understand the why.\n\nIf you want to be a professional athlete, you don’t just wake up one day at 18-years-old and say, “I’m going to be a professional basketball player. I have a talent, I’ve dribbled a ball a few times, and have a net in my backyard.” That would be absurd. That would be crazy.\n\nIn the world of singing, people sometimes have this delusion where they go, “I’m going to audition for American Ido or The Voice and I’m going to make an album.” Have you ever sung before? Have you ever practiced? “No, but my mom says I sound really good!” They have these delusions of grandeur of being this amazing Singer without going to practice.\n\nIn the world of athletics, and I’ll talk about dance as well, if you want to be a professional, you practice every single day no matter what. It’s not negotiable because that’s what it takes. There’s a whole system that says: “This is what you have to do. You have to be in this club and you have to do that.”\n\nIn the world of singing, there isn’t that same system. Personally, I went to musical theater school. But there is no university that’s like, follow these steps and you will become an amazing, Professional Singer. So the “university” is getting into voice lessons. Working with a Teacher you really like.\n\nThe great thing about our world now is that you can work with anybody around the world on Zoom. So if you live in a small town and you don’t have access to a Teacher you like, you can find people and work with them on Zoom.\n\nGoing back to the initial question, what does one learn from voice lessons? What does one not learn? I think that it’s enormously important for young people to understand that you don’t need to be able to instantly open your mouth and hit all the high notes. And understand that if you can’t do that, it doesn’t mean you’re bad or untalented.\n\nThat’s a complete misconception. You just have to practice. You want to get to the Olympics? You practice every day for years and years. You want to be a professional Singer? You practice every day for years and years.\n\nNo. It’s never too late. With that said, if you’re 28-years-old and you’ve never taken a voice lesson and you say, “I really want to create a career in singing,” I’m going to give it to you straight and say that’s gonna be rough. I’m not in the business of delusion because I don’t think that’s helpful for people.\n\nIt’s not helpful to them for me to say, “Oh yeah! It’s gonna be so easy for you!” I’m also not God and I don’t know people’s destiny, so I’m going to give it to them from my perspective. I would say most of the time, even when people ask if it’s too late to sing, they have sung at some point in their life, so it’s not like it’s a totally new thing.\n\nIf you decide to do that, embrace the beginner’s mindset. That’s difficult for certain personality types and that has nothing to do with age. Someone can be 70-years-old and have a really wonderful acceptance of the fact that they’re starting something new.\n\nThe biggest thing you have to think about when you’re in the “it’s too late” mindset is, what is the story you’re telling yourself? Usually, it happens with really young people. Like, they’re 22 and think they missed their chance. If they get into lessons, they’re bringing all of their drama into the lesson.\n\nIf I try to teach them something, they get frustrated that they’re not learning it quickly. They just want to sing like Mariah Carey, and when I say to them, “You’re not Mariah Carey,” they don’t like that. They kind of want to live in their own delusion, and that’s okay. I’m not about judging that. If you want to sing, sing! The world is going to decide if you’re going to be “successful” or not.\n\nThat’s the biggest piece of advice I want to give to people who ask, “Is it too late for me to sing? Is it even worth it?” I would say, you have to approach it with a beginner’s mindset and not drag your stuff into it. I think about myself; I used to dance. I’m 38-years-old now and I stopped dancing when I was 22.\n\nI was a dancer in college and danced five hours a day. It would be absurd for me to think that if I can’t get my leg up to where I used to, I’m such a failure. That would be illogical. I’ve spent the last 15 years not dancing. That’s just not how it works. Every day you practice. You work. You practice. You work. You accept the beginner’s mindset. I’m going to act as if I don’t know how to do this and I’m going to enjoy the fact that I don’t know how to do this.\n\nIt’s really important that you work with a good Coach. A lot of the time with Singing Teachers, they teach technique. But singing is so psychological and so emotional. People have a lot of emotion when it comes to it. Find a Coach who understands what’s going on with you psychologically so they can bring you back.\n\nI always say, singing in public is not for the faint of heart. And when I say “in public” I don’t mean for your family. (Sometimes singing for the family is also not for the faint of heart, depending on your family.) What we do as Singers is we get up in front of a group of strangers and take our heart and soul and pour it out and basically say, “Please like this.” We’re also doing technical things. Hitting notes. Having tone.\n\nThen people in the audience are like “… I don’t like it.” That person could know nothing about singing and just be thinking, “I don’t like how she moves her hair around.” So it’s not for the faint of heart. It’s not for people who would rather stay in a cubicle and stay in this little box.\n\nThere has to be a part of you that gets off on that and accepts that this is rough, but still loves it and knows that this is what you want to do. If you’re so terrified that you don’t want to do it, and it makes you want to throw up, and you can’t get over that after you’ve tried for years and years–do something else. But if it’s a temporary thing: be gentle with yourself.\n\nYou’re standing up in front of a group of strangers and saying, “Love me,” and, “Please God let me hit that note.” It’s not easy. That’s where your training comes in. It comes back to the technique and muscle memory. Because when your bullshit comes in like, “Oh, that person’s not even paying attention to me!” then your muscle memory kicks in, your technique, and you go on autopilot. When you’re emotionally like, “Ahhh!” your technique is like: “I got this.”\n\nI differentiate between a Vocal Coach like myself and the technique thing. For technique, I would send somebody to a Voice Teacher. Although I do a little technique—if I hear somebody hitting a note too hard or not opening their mouth the correct way, I can fix all that.\n\nI think coming to a Vocal Coach is so important because, one, you get to do the work, and two, confidence. One of my fortés as a Vocal Coach is giving students confidence. I think that’s the gift that I gave to every contestant on American Idol for 16 years, because we didn’t have time to do vocal lessons. You’d literally watch these kids become more and more confident every week.\n\nThe confidence thing is everything. Shy doesn’t work if you want to be in show business and you want to be a Singer, or an Actor, or a Dancer. I’ll have someone say to me, “I want to be famous,” and I’ll say, “Sing me a song,” and they’ll say, “Oh I don’t want to, I’m too shy.” And I’ll go, “But you want to be famous? You have to sing in front of anybody.” Shy doesn’t work anymore.\n\nIt’s not enough to have a great voice. You have to be able to do all of it. Just going to lessons and becoming familiar and comfortable in your own body and knowing what you can and can’t do is everything. When you go to an audition, you’re armed for anything.\n\nI try to tell my students when they’re auditioning for something: you have to walk in with confidence, even if it’s fake for now. Not cocky, just confident. There’s a huge difference. I want someone to walk into an audition feeling like they’re going to be the next best thing the people behind the desk are going to see.\n\nYou’re unique. You have to show everybody how you’re unique, not a karaoke version of somebody. That’s so important and what I try to work on with all my students. Most of my students are between 10–17 and it’s what I really love to do.\n\nI’m the shyest person, but when I’m talking about music or sitting behind a piano, I’m not. I’m so confident because it’s my comfort zone. If I have to go to a social party after a show, I don’t do so well. I’m so comfortable in this area, and that’s what I want to give to everybody. You can go so far with that. Even if you just have that confidence while you’re working, then afterward you can go back to being the shyest person in the world.\n\nI think that all those talent shows that are out there on TV right now are the greatest things ever; if you do them for the right reasons. If you do it because you think you’re gonna get famous overnight and not have to work, that’s the wrong reason. And those shows give kids today—because they’ve been on so long—a false sense that you can get famous overnight or that you can go on a show for eight weeks and everyone will know you. It’s not like that.\n\nEvery single successful kid that came out of Idol that still has a career today, from Kelly Clarkson to Carrie Underwood to Chris Daughtry to Adam Lambert to Katharine McPhee, winners or not winners, they all have an amazing work ethic. They’re talented, too. But they know it doesn’t happen just because you’re a Kardashian who got famous for nothing. You gotta do the work. And it’s so rewarding.\n\nIn this business … it’s so important to just get out there and do as much as you can. Audition as much as you can. That way, when the right shot comes along, it’s yours. And when you go to an audition, you have to remember that the people behind the desk want you to be good. So that should take away some of the nerves.\n\nIt’s the most vulnerable thing, this business. But know that when you walk into that room, they want you to be good. They don’t want you to be bad and nervous. Go into the room and be friendly with the Pianist, who’s gonna be your best friend in that room for those three minutes. Just be calm, together, and breathe. Show your best. You don’t want to show your second best or leave that room and go, “Oh God, I sang that so great in the shower this morning.”\n\nThen there’s the audition where you go in and you say, “I just did the best I could do. I’m so happy with how that went,” and you still don’t get the job. But it doesn’t matter. So much is out of your control that if you can leave an audition and be happy with how you did, that’s everything.\n\nIt’s a timing game, too. You have to make sure you want to do this for the right reasons. And by the right reasons, I mean you have to be so passionate about what you do that there should be no plan B. There should be no fallback. When I was a kid, my parents made me go to school to be an Accountant, and I was like, “No. I only want to do music.” So when kids say to me today, “I don’t know if I want to be a Singer, I may want to go to law school,” I say, “You should go to law school,” if that’s even in their mind.\n\nFor people that only want to be Singers, you still might have to get a job as a Waitress, or at Starbucks, or as a Bank Teller, or whatever to pay the bills. Don’t let it stop you from being passionate about it. You have to do it; you love it so much.\n\nIt’s a timing game. Some people get very lucky. Some people have to go at it for years and years and years before they get a break. Don’t give up. Don’t ever give up. The crazy thing is that before, you had to be 15–22 and had to look a certain way.\n\nThe way the music business is today, you can be any age, any ethnicity, orientation, any size. You can look any way physically. There are no rules anymore. Anybody can do it. You can be 15 or 30 or 60. Something can go viral for no reason and it can just happen. That should keep anybody going.\n\nYou just need to know: This is what I want to do, even if I have to do something else along the way. This is my passion and I will always be passionate about it. And if you’re not passionate about it anymore, it’s silly.\n\nUnless you’re just doing it for fun and to feel good, which is also okay. I have a few students that say, “I don’t want to do anything with this, singing is just a great end-of-week release to the stress I’m in at work,” and I love that. That’s great.\n\nI’m thinking about my son; he’s almost four-years-old. If I go to the piano for him, he can match the pitch. That’s called talent. He just absorbs. If there’s a rhythm and you go along with the right rhythm and pitch, that’s called talent. Where does talent come from? I have no idea. It comes from whatever you believe; it comes from God, the universe, little talent fairies that sprinkle their fairy dust around at night, from genetics.\n\nSo, take my son–he’s a natural talent. But if I never get him into training ever in his life, he’s going to be stuck in this little bubble of what he knows unless he educates himself later on in his life. It’s important for young people, if they have a natural talent, to train it.\n\nThe bare minimum of talent for singing is matching the pitch and a nice sense of musicality. If you don’t foster that through training, you’re not going to get as good as you can possibly be.\n\nWhen it comes to singing, at a certain point as a young person, you’re going to run up against a challenge. You’re not going to be able to hit that note. You’re going to have a lack of air. It doesn’t matter how much talent you have, you have to have skill. Talent is over there, skill is over here.\n\nAnybody can do a one-off. Anybody can get on YouTube and make a song and say, “I’ve never had voice lessons before in my life,” and they can sound amazing. But can you tour for three years in a row and travel, or go on Broadway and do eight shows a week? I would imagine that there is nobody who is talented enough to be at the ultimate level of singing without having a discipline behind it.\n\nYou’re working with your muscles. You’re working with your ligaments. You’re working with so many different things that have to be trained. It’s why some of the greatest Singers of yesteryear don’t sound as good. They were really talented people, but they most likely have not had a practice they can come back to.\n\nWhen it comes to vocal coaching, a really wonderful thing to do for yourself is to recognize there is a discipline involved in really getting something. You don’t just wake up one day. Every single Writer that I respect that writes about writing always says, “I sit down at my desk every single day between this time and this time and I write. Most of the time I don’t feel like doing it but I do it.” And there you go.\n\nThe reason why I think so many people get turned off by lessons is they don’t find someone who gets them, that they like, or they can’t afford the people that they want to work with. But there are so many opportunities in the world now to get training, even if you don’t have the money, or you live in some tiny town where there’s not a lot of access to things.\n\nIt’s interesting because as an Opera Singer, it’s not in the culture or ethos to not have training. If you want to go to Juilliard for opera, you know you’ve been studying for 10 years prior. In the worlds of gospel, country, and even rock, it’s not really in the culture or ethos to think you need training because so many people are just naturally talented.\n\nI’m not underestimating talent. Talent is real. Any Teacher is lying if they say they prefer working with someone who isn’t talented versus someone who is talented. If I were to go and try to be an ice skater, I’d fall on my face. Talent is a real thing. However, if you don’t have discipline, or a craft, or a good work ethic, you can squander away your talent. That happens all the time."
