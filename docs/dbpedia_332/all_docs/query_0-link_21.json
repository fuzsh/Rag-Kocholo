Starts as an innocent and afraid, sometimes dangerous and rabid, animal but\n\ngrows into an intelligent and insightful being.

The Parkers’ rebellious daughter who has the innocence and naivety that a teenager often does, with plenty of spunk and great comedic timing.

Performer must have great vocal skills, strong acting and an endearing, youthful presence, with good movement skills. A triple threat.\n\nMeredith Parker - Lead, Mezzo-Soprano. Seeking female, nonbinary, or gender non-conforming actors. 30s-50s.\n\nOpen to all ethnicities. A loving mother, and a true caregiver, with a traumatic past. Meredith portrays the “perfect\n\nhousewife” by masking her emotions and trauma, to please others in her home and town, and potentially herself, to pretend her own guilt and unhappiness doesn’t exist.

Actor must be a strong vocalist with a powerful belt and excellent acting skills.\n\nDr. Thomas Parker - Lead, Tenor. Seeking male, nonbinary, or gender non-conforming actors. 30s-50s.
