This musical comedy/horror show promises to deliver an entertaining and thought-provoking experience for audiences of all ages.\r\n\r\nJoin us for an unforgettable performance of \"Bat Boy: The Musical\" at the William Inge Theatre, Independence Community College.

Admission is free.\r\n\r\n\"Bat Boy: The Musical\" follows the story of a half-boy/half-bat creature discovered in a cave near Hope Falls, West Virginia. Accepted into the home of the town veterinarian, Dr. Parker, Bat Boy attempts to live a \"normal\" life but faces rejection from the narrow-minded townspeople, ultimately leading to a series of shocking revelations about his origin.\r\n\r\nMolnar expressed his excitement about bringing \"Bat Boy: The Musical\" to the ICC stage. \"When I was looking for a musical to do here, I wanted to be sure it was something that would be topical, relevant, challenging for our students, and most of all, fun,\" Molnar stated. \"I believe 'Bat Boy' has ticked all those boxes.\"\r\n\r\nHe emphasized the show's exploration of themes surrounding identity, belonging, compassion, and the impact of religious beliefs on societal norms. \"The story asks us to grapple with the question of belonging, what it means to be human, and how we can find love and compassion for people who may be foreign,\" Molnar explained.\r\n\r\nIn addition to \"Bat Boy: The Musical,\" ICC Theatre has an exciting lineup of events planned for the spring season, including \"The Revolutionists\" by Lauren Gunderson and the 41st William Inge Theatre Festival honoring Lauren Gunderson.
