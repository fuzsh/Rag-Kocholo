        "text": "Musical: Bat Boy\n\nMusic: Laurence O’Keefe\n\nLyrics: Laurence O’Keefe\n\nBook: Keythe Farley & Brian Flemming\n\nPremise (per Wikipedia): “based on a June 23, 1992 Weekly World News story about a half-boy, half-bat, dubbed \"Bat Boy”, who grew up living in a cave. The book deals with serious themes (such as hypocrisy, acceptance, forgiveness, racism, revenge and scapegoating) but often punctures the most serious moments with slapstick, surrealism, camp-horror and irony.”\n\nBat Boy ran Off-Broadway in 2001 and later on the West End in 2004. Off-Broadway, it won several awards, including the Lucille Lortel Award for Best Musical and 2 Richard Rodgers Awards.\n\nCheck out the album and let us know what you think!\n\nSneak peek for next week: Catch Me if You Can\n\nWhat musical would you like to see be Musical of the Week?"
