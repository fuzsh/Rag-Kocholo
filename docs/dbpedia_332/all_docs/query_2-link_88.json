        "text": "WASHINGTON — Austal USA this week announced it had launched the final Littoral Combat Ship, Pierre (LCS-38), in the class, a milestone signaling the shipbuilding program is finally nearing its sundown as the service and industry grapple with the early problems of its follow-on class.\n\n“Meeting this ship milestone in such a safe and timely manner demonstrates how well our Austal USA launch team, transporter operators and tug pilots have learned to work together over the last 13 years, seamlessly executing this technical launch process,” Dave Growden, a company executive said in a written statement. “Our industry teams work methodically alongside our Navy partners to improve this innovative process with each launch evolution, guaranteeing the Navy a quality product delivered on time and on budget.”\n\nPierre is the 19th Independence-variant LCS and the 33rd in the class to be launched into the water. Fincantieri Marinette Marine in conjunction Lockheed Martin launched the final Freedom-class Littoral Combat Ship in April 2023; that ship being the Cleveland (LCS-31).\n\nPierre, an Independence-class ship, bears the hull number 38 because the US Navy initially had planned on buying three additional Freedom-class ships. Those plans were ultimately scrapped late into the program’s life when service officials and lawmakers decided transitioning to the newer Constellation-class frigate program should take priority over building more LCS.\n\nWith the last LCS now bound for sea trials to verify that it’s ready to enter the operational fleet, both lawmaker and Navy focus is sure to steadily increase on the Constellation class, also built by Fincantieri Marinette Marine, the ship class slated to eventually replace the LCS.\n\nThat program was one of two ship classes cited by Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro earlier this year that sparked his 45-day shipbuilding review. The review prompted a rare and very public admission from Navy brass that most of its high-power shipbuilding programs were heavily delayed, with Constellation itself facing up to 36 months of schedule setback.\n\nThe frigate program has been in rough waters this year as lawmakers consider the president’s fiscal year 2025 request. The construction backlog as well as the departure of former Rep. Mike Gallagher, a defense hawk that represented Fincantieri’s Wisconsin district, has led to some lawmakers recommending the funding line being zeroed out this year while the Navy and industry play catch up."
