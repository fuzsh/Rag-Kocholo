        "text": "Story and Book by Keythe Farley and Brian Flemming\n\nMusic and Lyrics by Laurence O’Keefe\n\nDirected by Ilana Ransom Toeplitz\n\nMusic direction by Jonathan Goldberg\n\nChoreographed by Christopher Shin\n\nBased on “a true story” in The Weekly World News, this ridiculous, heartfelt musical comedy/horror show is about a half boy/half bat found in a cave in the hills of West Virginia. Even though Bat Boy is taught to act like a “normal” boy, will his happiness be shattered when the town discovers the shocking secret of his unholy origin?\n\nDecember 6-9, 2023\n\nSemel THEATer\n\nAll performances open to the public\n\nLicensed under agreement with Weekly World News. Bat Boy: The Musical is presented by special arrangement with Broadway Licensing, LLC. (www.broadwaylicensing.com)\n\nOriginal New York production produced by Nancy Nagel Gibbs, Riot Entertainment, Robyn Goodman, Michael Alden, Jean Doumanian and the Producing Office.\n\nOriginal cast recording available on RCA/Victor.\n\nBat Boy: The Musical was developed in New York City at The Directors Company, Michael Parva, Artistic/Producing Director.\n\nBat Boy: The Musical had its initial production at The Actors’ Gang in Los Angeles, CA.\n\nThe Authors wish to acknowledge the generous support provided through the Richard Rodgers Development Award and the Richard Rodgers Production Award. The Richard Rodgers Awards are administered by the American Academy of Arts and Letters.\n\nNOTE TO AUDIENCE: The videotaping or audio and/or visual recording of this production is a violation of United States Copyright Law and an actionable federal offense.\n\nRun Time: 2 hours and 20 minutes, including an intermission\n\nContent Advisory: This musical comedy includes violence (gun, knife, fire, physical, domestic) including use of prop firearms, murder/suicide, cruelty towards animals, rape, bestiality, and referenced incest.\n\nSensory Advisory: The production contains flashing lights and gunshot sound effects.\n\nLand Acknowledgement: Emerson College, Boston, resides on the ancestral and unceded lands of the Massachusett people, whose name was appropriated by this Commonwealth. We pay respect to the Massachusett elders past and present. We acknowledge the truth of violence perpetrated in the name of this country and make a commitment to uncovering that truth.\n\nA note from the\n\nDirector, Ilana Ransom Toeplitz\n\nDear Audience Member and honorary visitor of Hope Falls, WV,\n\nI hope this note finds you well — and thanks for reading, as I usually skip these! As the director of Bat Boy: The Musical, I first want to express my profound admiration and love for this show, its writers and my collaborators. Who knew a half-bat, half-boy would be the one leading us fearlessly towards the vulnerable reality that is the human experience?\n\nDark comedy allows us to confront difficult subjects with a unique blend of wit and irony, providing a cathartic experience for the audience. In times of uncertainty, laughter can be a beacon of light, offering a momentary escape and a fresh perspective on our shared challenges. Through the lens of Bat Boy, we aim to provoke thought, stir emotions, and ultimately celebrate the resilience of the human spirit, reminding us that even in the darkest moments, there’s room for laughter and self-reflection.\n\nWhile Bat Boy: The Musical is full of laughs and character, the exploration of mob mentality within the narrative sheds light on the dangers of conformity and the potential for irrational behavior when individuals succumb to groupthink. In today’s world, where social media and online communities often perpetuate echo chambers, the message of the musical becomes increasingly relevant.\n\nFurthermore, the musical delves into the theme of othering, reminding us of the consequences of excluding those perceived as different. Through the journey of the titular character, the narrative challenges us to question our prejudices and embrace empathy. In a time where division seems to be on the rise, Bat Boy: The Musical serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of acceptance and understanding.\n\nFinally, the musical’s exploration of finding one’s place in the world is both heartfelt and universal. The characters’ struggles and triumphs resonate with audiences on a personal level, encouraging self-reflection and a deeper understanding of our own journeys. In a society that often pressures individuals to conform to predefined norms, this aspect of the musical encourages viewers to embrace their uniqueness and pursue their own path.\n\nEndless thanks to Avery, Maddie, Chris, Cece, Jon, Annie, David, Josh, Team SM and Team Designers for jumping on this hayride to Hope Falls; thank you for bringing out the best in yourselves, and in me. It’s been such a joy to watch you all take ownership of this show.\n\nI am honored to be a part of bringing this story to life, and I hope that its messages continue to inspire and provoke thought in you tonight.\n\nBest regards,\n\nIlana Ransom Toeplitz\n\nDirector, Bat Boy: The Musical\n\nA note from the\n\nDramaturg, Ciara Berardi\n\nDeciding What’s Human: What is Bat Boy?\n\nBat Boy: The Musical follows the discovery of Bat Boy, a human-bat hybrid found in a cave by a group of rowdy spelunkers. His arrival causes disarray and panic in the small town of Hope Falls, West Virginia. He is handed off to the Parker family, named Edgar, and is taught how to be human. But a lot of people are still not happy with his presence. With the townsfolk on his back and his thoughts pressuring him to act on impulse, Edgar is desperate to determine: is he human or is he an animal?\n\nIn 1992 the Bat Boy character debuted to the public in the fake news tabloid The Weekly World News with the headline: “Bat Boy Found in West Virginia Cave!” From here, the computer-edited creature became the “news” source’s mascot. Just five years after Bat Boy’s release to the world, this musical written by Brian Flemming and Keythe Farley, and featuring music and lyrics by Laurence O’Keefe, premiered on Halloween at The Actors’ Gang theater in Los Angeles.\n\nUsing humor to explore themes of mob mentality, scapegoating, and the misuse of Christian charity, Bat Boy is a darkly comedic delight. Comedy during crises can bring people together through shared experiences, and optimism in a time of tragedy and despair can be key to surviving dark periods. Laughter is a unifier. With the weight of the world, it feels amazing to be able to laugh. And it also feels good to think. Just remember to heed what the story tells you and keep in mind the message of Edgar’s internal conflict. Will the human side prevail or will the animalistic tendencies throw everything away?\n\nCreative Team Bios\n\nILANA RANSOM-TOEPLITZ (she/her) — Director\n\nIlana Ransom Toeplitz is a director, choreographer, writer, and professor specializing in new musicals, thoughtful revivals and comedy.
