        "text": "Architecture\n\nOriginally designed in 1958 by renowned modernist architect Eero Saarinen, Bell Works’ signature glass-encased facade and timeless open-atrium scheme – which spans a quarter-mile – has built its reputation as NJ’s most iconic building. Considered one of the masters of American 20th-century architecture, the two-million-square-foot building offers naturally flowing, open spaces, including exposed, “inside-out” hallways, meant to foster collaboration and interaction. Acclaimed architects Kevin Roche and John Dinkeloo also greatly influenced the ultimate design of Bell Works, completing significant building additions in the 1980s.\n\nDesign\n\nDeemed historic by the National Register of Historic places, the iconic modernist architecture of Bell Works inspired Alexander Gorlin and Paola Zamudio of NPZ Style & Decor to curate a distinctly contemporary design while paying homage to Bell Works’ storied past. The center atrium's sprawling floors mimic an art installation by Josef Albers, while other areas of the building such as the lobby 'conversation pit' have been refreshed and restored— one of many small tributes to Bell's ongoing legacy. The culmination of their collaboration, together with Ron Arad, is epitomized in the Albers floor pattern and iconic tubes throughout the atrium.\n\nInnovation\n\nBell Works’ esteemed history is rooted in innovation. Considered an “innovation headquarters” for over 6,000 Bell Labs employees from 1962 to 2007, this renowned legacy of innovation has been preserved by a mass of technology-focused companies who now call Bell Works home. In its 40-plus year history as the research headquarters for Bell Laboratories, Lucent, and Alcatel-Lucent, the building hosted multiple Nobel Prize winners, including those who conceived theories for the laser, the Big Bang theory and more.\n\nEducation\n\nWe value our ability to offer educational programming for everyone at Bell Works, including daily workers and the surrounding community. Our popular “How it Works” speaker series hosts leaders from a diverse range of industries each month. These relaxed panels feature professionals who offer attendees a wealth of knowledge from down-to-earth career advice to experience-based know-how. We’re also the proud home of Holmdel’s Montessori school, which offers a range of programs designed to foster childrens’ creativity and individuality.\n\nCommunity\n\nThe Bell Works’ Metroburb prides itself on its close-knit community. Every member of the Bell Works community — from daily workers to local residents and first-time visitors — experiences the Metroburb environment as a place for everyone to connect, mingle, network, work, play, dine and more. A bustling hub for events, the Metroburb’s public activations –like our roof deck fitness classes and our weekly Bell Works Fresh Farmers market –serve as ongoing catalysts for community building and meaningful interaction.\n\nSustainability\n\nBell Works’ renowned glass ceiling consists of more than 3,000 individual panes of photovoltaic glass spanning 60,000 square feet, generating power to 20 percent of the property’s common areas and electric car charging stations. This system has the capacity to convert available sunlight into 180 kW of reusable solar energy. Green design guidelines have also shaped the redevelopment of the building, with focus on incorporating sustainable materials throughout and increasing operational efficiency through modernization of building management systems.\n\nArts & Culture\n\nBell Works proudly embraces the arts in New Jersey and beyond. The building has welcomed various art exhibitions, including nationally-acclaimed artist Sarah Mehoyas’ Cloud of Petals înstallation. Bell Works also attracted director Daniel Arsham who chose the building to shoot several scenes of his Tribeca Film Festival-premiered film, “Future Relic ‘03.” Bell Works also hosts Axelrod Performing Arts Academy, which offers programming for musical theater, dance and more. Ongoing activations, including a gallery wall of local artwork, and creative artist collaborations continue to shape and enrich the Bell Works experience."
