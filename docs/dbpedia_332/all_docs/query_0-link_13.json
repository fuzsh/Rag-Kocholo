For lack of a better solution, the local sheriff brings Bat Boy to the home of the town veterinarian, Dr. Parker, where he is eventually accepted as a member of the family and taught to act like a “normal” boy by the veterinarian’s wife, Meredith, and teenage daughter, Shelley. Bat Boy is happy with his new life, but when he naively tries to fit in with the narrow-minded people of Hope Falls, they turn on him, prodded by the machinations of Dr. Parker, who secretly despises Bat Boy. Shelley and Bat Boy, who have fallen in love, run away together from the ignorant townfolk and have a blissful coupling in the woods, but their happiness is shattered when Meredith arrives and reveals a secret. Soon the entire town arrives and hears the shocking story of Bat Boy’s unholy origin.",

The sounds include strings, brass, clav, B3, EP’s, mallet percussion, and other orchestral and acoustic padding to the small live 5 piece band.\n\nKeyboard 2 comes in at a whopping 16GB compressed and has many instances of layered and split sounds throughout the book. The original production used a double stack keyboard setup so there are references to (U) upper and (L) lower. We have programmed this to be played on a single keyboard so it is important to read all of the player notes in the programming itself as there are multiple instances of octave displacements to avoid overlapping split notes. Some of the sounds found in this book include strings of various articulations, organ, clavinet, electric piano, synth string pads, harp, synthesizer, music box, flute, celeste, and too many others to name although we must acknowledge our favorite patch, the “weird synth” in Whatcha Wanna Do.\n\nBoth books have been recopied and typeset recently which makes them super easy to read compared to he earlier handwritten versions of the books which in many cases were nearly illegible.\n\nKEYBOARD PROGRAMMER\n\nSynthesizer Programming by: Bruce Samuels\n\nORIGINAL MUSIC TEAM\n\nStory & Book by: Keythe Farley & Brian Flemming\n\nMusic & Lyrics by: Laurence O’Keefe\n\nOrchestrations by: Laurence O’Keefe & Alex Lacamoire\n\nMusic Director: Alex Lacamoire\n\nAssistant Music Director: Jason DeBord\n\nORIGINAL OFF BROADWAY CAST ALBUM ORCHESTRA\n\nWoodwinds: Dennis Anderson\n\nKeyboard 1: Alex Lacamoire\n\nKeyboard 2: Jason DeBord\n\nFrench Horn: Jeff Lang\n\nTrumpet: Robert Millikan\n\nTrombone: James Pugh\n\nCello: Jeanne LeBlanc\n\nElectric Bass: Matthew Rubano\n\nGuitar: Greg Skaff\n\nDrums: Ed Fast\n\nSHOW DESCRIPTION\n\nBased on a story in The Weekly World News, BAT BOY: THE MUSICAL is a musical comedy/horror show about a half boy/half bat creature who is discovered in a cave near Hope Falls, West Virginia.
