        "text": "Maybe it's something in John Caywood's veins. When productions have a gothic or blood-sucking side, \"they call me for the job,\" he said.\n\nCaywood's latest project is Salt Lake Acting Company's regional premiere of the recent off-Broadway hit \"Bat Boy: the Musical.\"\n\nHe's previously directed \"The Little Shop of Horrors,\" about an out-of-control, blood-thirsty plant, as well as \"Dracula\" and three productions of \"The Mystery of Irma Vep.\"\n\n\"I'm also the kind of guy who still believes that Elvis is somewhere in hiding,\" he said. \"And that there really is a Big Foot. I've been following the Bat Boy thing since it first emerged.\"\n\nIt first appeared 10 years ago in a splashy story in the Weekly World News tabloid. Now, the publication holds the license to the rock musical, which is loosely based on the alleged sighting in the Shenandoah mountains of a mutant described as half-human and half-bat.\n\nCaywood had originally intended to direct a production of \"Bat Boy\" when he was artistic director of the Egyptian Theatre Company in Park City. But then he resigned from that position last spring, still holding the rights to produce \"Bat Boy.\" \"After I left the Egyptian, Salt Lake Acting Company called me and invited me to direct it for them. It's a great thing for their space, and this is the one place in town able to produce this.\"\n\nHe added that he is \"having a great time, with no fund raising, marketing or administrative responsibilities\" — things that took up much of his time in Park City.\n\n\"It's a strange coincidence. I was thinking I was not going to be doing any more plays, but this was too tempting — and it's right up my alley.\"\n\n\"Bat Boy\" also has an \"Irma Vep\" slant to it. Several of the cast members play both men and women, and they're constantly changing clothes (and genders). Caywood said he is pleased to be working with a cast that includes quite a few familiar faces. \"This cast has turned out to be unbelievable. I couldn't be happier.\"\n\nHe's worked previously with David Spencer, Brenda Cowley and Faith Sandberg. There are also several players familiar to SLAC audiences that Caywood has not worked with before, \"but it's a very talented group,\" including Robert Scott Smith in the title role, with Christopher Glade, Arika Schmockmel, Polly Seale, Aaron Swenson and Jason Tatom in other roles.\n\nThe show has a rock-opera score, and the production will feature a five-piece orchestra under the direction of David Evanoff. Caywood said the score has a \"Rocky Horror Show\" and \"Evita\" feel to it, with touches of \"My Fair Lady.\"\n\nThe musical is set in the small, remote town of Hope Falls, W.Va., where the strange, new resident stirs up local citizens (especially the farmers, who suddenly contend with the horrific deaths of a number of cows). After the Bat Boy is taken into the home of a local veterinarian, he eventually is taught to speak, sing — and he even becomes a CPA.\n\nIn connection with the production, SLAC's post-play panel discussion (following the first Sunday matinee) will be \"Bat Boy — Maligned or Just Misunderstood?\" The open forum will be hosted by dramaturg Mike Dorrell, with Gerald McDonough and filmmaker Trent Harris among the guest panelists.\n\nWhile the show is geared toward mature audiences, Caywood said there is no nudity or bad language. \"It's a nontraditional, blood-sucking, holiday feast.\"\n\nThe production will feature cabaret-style seating, with food and beverages allowed inside the theater.\n\nAfter directing this SLAC production, Caywood is looking at pursuing more freelance work across the country. \"I'm back to my real love, which is working with the creative folks.\"\n\nHe's also pleased to be working with longtime SLAC stage manager Tanner Broughton. \"From a guy who's stage-managed for 20 years, the SLAC team is great. It makes my job much easier.\""
