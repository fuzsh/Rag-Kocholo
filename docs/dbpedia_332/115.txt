Based on a story in The Weekly World News, Bat Boy: The Musical is a comedy/horror rock musical about a half boy/half bat creature who is discovered in a cave near Hope Falls, West Virginia. Bat Boy is brought to the home of the town veterinarian, where he is eventually accepted as a member of the family and taught to act like a "normal" boy by the veterinarian's family. Bat Boy is happy with his new life, but when he naively tries to fit in with the narrow-minded people of Hope Falls, they turn on him after discovering the shocking story of his unholy origin.
