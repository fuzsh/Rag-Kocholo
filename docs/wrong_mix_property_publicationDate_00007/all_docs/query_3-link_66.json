        "text": "“Paris as it might have been written about if Baudelaire had been a science fiction author”\n\n— Denise Dumars, Library Journal, February 1994\n\nThe Secret Books of Paradys is a speculative fiction tetralogy set in an alternate Paris. The series is linked by its common setting, Tanith Lee’s vividly portrayed city of Paradys, but each book can be read independently. The titles are available individually, which is probably most convenient for teachers, but enthusiastic readers can save money by purchasing the series in a single volume, available new through major book retailers.\n\nThe Book of the Damned (1988)\n\n“How fast does a man run, when the Devil is after him?”\n\n— The Book of the Damned, opening line\n\nThe three novellas that comprise The Book of the Damned are united by their portrayal of gender as fluid and unfixed — a remarkably bold and insightful treatment in the 1980s. “Stained with Crimson,” a vampire story of desperate, doomed love, features characters with both female and male identities. “Malice in Saffron,” by acclamation the gem in this volume linked by its depictions of cursed jewelry, tells the story of a young woman who responds to her stepfather’s rape by assuming a male identity and leading a gang of thieves and brigands. Sheltering in a convent by day, she absorbs the values of her abusers, and by night amplifies the crimes of the men in her life. “Empires of Azure,” the weakest of the three novellas, reveals the personal history of an artist with both female and male identities. Professors working with queer theory will find this book an excellent addition to their libraries and syllabi.\n\nIn addition to feminist theory and queer analysis, The Book of the Damned depicts characters’ responses to trauma — most obviously “Malice in Saffron” — and will interest many scholars of trauma theory and their students. High school students should respond positively to the angst-filled narrator of “Stained with Crimson,” and more broadly to Tanith Lee’s nuanced treatment of gender and sexuality.\n\nThe Book of the Beast (1989)\n\n“A girl is grown like a flower in the house of her kindred. She is nurtured for her hues and perfume. At the blossoming she will be plucked from her native soil and planted elsewhere. In other earth she will give fruit, fade, wither, and finish. This is all the usefulness of such a flower, the well-born girl among the great houses of Paradys.”\n\n— The Book of the Beast\n\nThe Book of the Beast is a short novel (196 pages) that applies an unflinching lens to social values and expectations. Including multiple depictions (not graphic) of sex work, the novel blends stinging social commentary with lush, dark atmosphere, epitomizing Tanith Lee’s unique combination of literary insight and unconventional, compelling story-telling — perfect for bright students who don’t respond to traditional canon. Plotted around a supernatural curse that transforms refined humans into something primal and predatory, and exploring uneven economic and social power dynamics across almost every interaction among characters, this text offers superb opportunities for both feminist analysis and Marxist criticism.\n\nClick here for a detailed lesson plan centered on close reading of the quote that introduces this section. While this lesson plan is most appropriate for high school classes, it will also interest some professors of higher education, and many tutors.\n\nThe Book of the Dead (1991)\n\n“You can tell the graves of the bourgeois, always so ornate and yet so cautious, as if even here they were afraid to try too far above their stations, lest they be smitten. Sometimes you see how the living attempt to make reparation. Here the neglectful parent has strewn stony flowers above his child, but none of the real sort. The story associated with this grave is very horrible and very strange. Hearsay.”\n\n— The Book of the Dead\n\nA somewhat uneven collection of eight short stories, The Book of the Dead affords teachers flexibility, since they can incorporate individual stories into their semester plans without disrupting the syllabus. Recommended selections from this volume include “Beautiful Lady,” “The Marble Web,” “The Glass Dagger,” and “The Moon is a Mask.” All offer attractive opportunities for feminist analysis, with “Beautiful Lady” the most striking in that respect.\n\nThe epigram for this story is taken from the well-known poem “What Are Little Boys Made Of?”: “Sugar and spice / And all things nice.” Lee foregrounds gender through the title and reinforces it with this introduction to the story. Furthermore, the title indicates the way women will be judged throughout the tale: by physical appearance rather than personality. Each character’s role is dictated by gender; more precisely, each character’s gender is dictated by her or his role in the story.\n\n“Beautiful Lady” also presents notable opportunity for psychoanalytic analysis, particularly in the character of an unnamed “uncle” who provides a superego counter-balance to the primary character’s more id-driven persona. Click here for a detailed lesson plan outlining possible approaches to “Beautiful Lady.”\n\nA note may be appropriate here concerning the cover art for The Secret Books of Paradys. In my view, the cover art by Wayne Barlowe, while beautiful, is part of the reason Tanith Lee is seldom taught in schools.\n\nLee wrote supernatural fiction almost exclusively, and her novels and collections were marketed to appeal to fans of Anne Rice and other popular writers of dark fantasy. The Secret Books of Paradys featured covers depicting attractive women in various states of undress, selecting for themselves a popular rather than scholastic audience. Academics can be forgiven for judging these books by their covers, but this project aims to rectify misunderstandings of Lee’s catalog. While accessible to a mass audience — and probably gratifying for many of the readers who enjoyed Rice’s Vampire Chronicles — Lee’s writing rewards close study and merits the attention not only of literary scholars and theorists, but of teachers and students at almost every level.

This gave him a feeling of uneasy and strange power, which he confirmed for himself as the sense of duty.”\n\n— The Book of the Mad\n\nA portrait of Paradys in three eras, The Book of the Mad examines definitions of sanity and victimhood, and especially the ways those definitions are connected to power and trauma. Arguably Lee’s masterpiece, this novel fundamentally revolves around power structures and responses to trauma. In Victorian Paradys, a naive girl from a wealthy family reacts to sexual assault and institutional abuse. Many years later, in a city now called Paradis, a decadent artist is institutionalized following the murder of her lover. Twin siblings, orphaned in the future city of Paradise, raise questions about the nature of sanity in a decaying world that could drive anyone mad.\n\nIf you choose to teach only one volume of Lee’s Paradys series, consider this elegant and intricate novel.
