        "text": "As one of the world's biggest providers of computers, network servers, and related products and services, Dell Technologies Inc. competes with a range of giant technology companies, including HP Inc., Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Group, Lenovo Group Ltd., Acer, and Apple Inc.\n\nAfter putting up billions of dollars of his own money to take the company private in 2013, Michael Dell restructured it and expanded into new sectors. That included significant strategic investments in enterprise hardware and cloud services to position the company to compete in the data-heavy fourth industrial revolution.\n\nFollowing years of investments and changes, Dell was listed again in 2018, capping a spectacular turnaround that netted Michael Dell billions of dollars in profits. Dell Technologies reported record full-year revenue of $101.2 billion in fiscal 2021, with net income of $6.2 billion.\n\nDell Client Solutions Group\n\nDell's legacy business of selling consumer PCs, which remains a key driver of profits, now exists within the Dell Client Solutions Group. Its lineup includes desktop PCs, laptop PCs, printers, monitors, TVs, and home theaters, cameras, and camcorders. The group delivered record revenue of $61.5 billion in fiscal 2022. Even with PC sales flattening in recent years, Dell has consistently expanded market share.\n\nIn the consumer PC sector for Q1 2022, Dell's major competitors are Lenovo, which holds the top market share, HP Inc., previously known as Hewlett-Packard, as well as Apple, Asus Inc., and Acer Inc. Dell ranks third among that group in global market share.\n\nDell Infrastructure Solutions Group\n\nUnder its Infrastructure Solutions Group, Dell also provides businesses with a range of hardware and services, including data storage and protection, servers and networking, including cloud-based solutions.\n\nIn these arenas as of a June 2022 report, Dell came in 15th among the major competitors. Its main rivals as market leaders are Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and IBM, as well as VMware, Fujitsu, and Google."
