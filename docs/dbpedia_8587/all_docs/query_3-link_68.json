        "text": "Acer, a Taiwanese company, was founded in 1976 as Multitech and later renamed Acer in 1987. Despite its long-term reputation for making affordable, budget laptops, the company currently has one of the widest selections of models, with multiple laptop lineups like the productivity-focused Aspire and Swift, the gaming Nitro and Predator lines, the creation-geared Concept line-up, and more. Acer is also one of the biggest Chromebook manufacturers, producing popular models like the Acer Chromebook Spin 713 (2020), and is also among the first to produce gaming Chromebooks like the Acer Chromebook 516 GE (2022).\n\nOur pick for the best Acer laptop is the Acer Chromebook Spin 714 (2022), a 2-in-1 convertible Chromebook. It has a bright, sharp 14-inch screen, a spacious keyboard, and an outstanding 1080p webcam. It supports pen input and comes with a stylus that you can dock into the side of the laptop for transport. Performance is excellent, and battery life is amazing at over 13 hours of light use. The biggest drawback is availability. You can still get the Core i5 model with 8GB of RAM, but other configurations are hard to find.\n\nFYI: we've purchased the new 2024 model of the Spin 714 and will test it soon, so be on the lookout for the review. It's largely the same laptop but available with newer, faster Intel Meteor Lake CPUs. See here for more details, or get it at Best Buy. If you prefer a Windows laptop or need more processing power, the Acer Swift 14 (2023) is a great alternative. Its Intel H-series processor can handle significantly more intensive tasks, but its battery life takes a hit, lasting only six to seven hours of light use.\n\nApple is one of the most recognizable electronics companies in the world. Apple products have become synonymous with exceptional build quality, and the company is well-known for its amazing customer support. Since 2020, Apple has been producing its own ARM-based M-series processors for their MacBooks instead of relying on Intel chips. This change has made MacBooks among the most powerful and power-efficient laptops on the market. Another advantage of MacBooks is their integration with other products in Apple's ecosystem, supporting features like Continuity Camera, Airdrop, Handoff, etc. Gaming isn't great on MacBooks due to the lack of compatible games and Apple displays' slow response time; however, there's some progress, as Apple has released a tool that'll help developers create a macOS version of their games.\n\nThe best Apple laptop we've tested is the Apple MacBook Pro 14 (M3, 2023). This premium mobile workstation has almost everything you'd want on a laptop: a sturdy build, a thin and light design, plenty of processing power, and a long battery life. It has a sharp 120hz Mini LED display, a comfortable keyboard, an easy-to-use haptic touchpad, and tons of ports. What's new in this generation of the MacBook Pro 14 is the base M3 configuration, which can be a great option if you don't need the Pro/Max chips' processing power but still want the 'Pro' features, like the display and up-firing speakers. The larger Apple MacBook Pro 16 (M3, 2023) is also a good choice if you want more screen space; just expect to pay more.\n\nAlthough the MacBook Pro 14 is an amazing device, the most popular model in Apple's lineup is the Apple MacBook Air 13 (2024). While this ultraportable is better suited for those with a lighter workload, like web browsing, text processing, and video playback, its base M3 SoC can still handle more demanding tasks like video editing, though you'll have to wait longer for videos to render. The IPS display also looks great, although not as good as the Mini LED on the Pro model, and you'll get the same spacious keyboard and haptic touchpad. There's also the Apple MacBook Air 15 (2024) if you want more screen space and better-sounding speakers, but this model costs more.\n\nSee our recommendations for the best Apple laptops here.\n\nFounded in 1989 by four members who had worked at Acer, ASUS, also known as ASUSTek, is one of the largest laptop manufacturers in the world. It's also one of the best gaming laptop brands and often sponsors Esports events and players. ASUS makes a wide range of laptops, including ultraportables, mobile workstations, gaming laptops, and Chromebooks. ASUS often experiments with new form factors and features, like dual-screen laptops, touchpads with an integrated numpad, a customizable dial (like the ASUS ProArt Studiobook Pro 16 OLED (2021), and 2-in-1 gaming tablets like the ASUS ROG Flow Z13.\n\nThe best ASUS laptop we've tested is the ASUS Zenbook 14 OLED (2024), a 14-inch ultraportable with a gorgeous OLED display. It's available with Intel Meteor Lake CPUs, which are fast enough to handle general productivity tasks and more demanding workloads like photo editing and programming. These new chips sport additional low-power cores to improve battery life as well as an NPU (Neural Processing Unit) to handle AI-based tasks, like background blurring during video calls and some functions in photo editing apps. It has a great keyboard, a large touchpad, and numerous ports, including two Thunderbolt 4s and an HDMI. The display supports touch and pen input, though you may have to buy the stylus separately.\n\nFor gaming, we recommend the ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 (2024). Available with an AMD Ryzen 7 or 9 CPU paired with an NVIDIA discrete GPU (up to an RTX 4070), this 14-inch model provides smooth gameplay at 1080p or 1440p. It has a beautiful 120Hz 2.8k OLED display with a fast response time and G-SYNC support, a tactile keyboard, and one of the best speaker systems on a Windows machine. You get Wi-Fi 6E, a facial recognition camera, and a wide port selection with two USB-As, two USB-Cs, and an HDMI 2.1. The overall user experience is great; just bear in mind that the OLED display's 120Hz flicker may bother those sensitive to PWM flickering.\n\nDell is an American company founded in 1984 by Michael Dell. The company makes desktops, laptops, workstations, monitors, and a wide range of computer peripherals. It's one of the largest laptop manufacturers, with well-known brands like XPS, Precision, Latitude, and Inspiron. In 2006, Dell acquired Alienware, which is now considered one of the best gaming laptop brands on the market. High-end Dell laptops like the XPS, Precision, and Alienware models often have unique designs that stand out among the crowd and generally provide a great user experience. A common criticism of Dell is its use of proprietary parts, which make repairs and upgrades challenging for the average user.\n\nOur top Dell laptop pick is the Dell XPS 16 (2024). This premium 16-inch model feels incredibly well-built. It's available with Intel Meteor Lake CPUs (up to a Core Ultra 9) paired with integrated graphics or an NVIDIA RTX 40-series GPU (up to a 4070), giving you plenty of processing power to tackle demanding tasks. You can choose between an FHD+ IPS or a 4k+ OLED display; we recommend the latter for color-critical work, as it has full DCI P3 coverage. The overall user experience is good, though it may take some time to get used to the invisible touchpad, capacitive function row, and edge-to-edge keys.\n\nThe Dell Alienware m18 R2 (2024) is our best Dell gaming pick. Configurable with high-performance Intel 14th Gen CPUs and NVIDIA discrete GPUs, this 18-inch model delivers incredibly smooth gameplay in the most demanding games. Display options include a 480Hz FHD+ and a 165Hz QHD+ display; both support G-SYNC. Like its predecessor, the Dell Alienware m18 (2023), you can get the laptop with a mechanical keyboard, sporting ultra low-profile CherryMX switches. The RAM and storage are user-replaceable, so you can upgrade or add more later. As for downsides, it's bulky and heavy, and its battery lasts about an hour when gaming. Also, the fans get pretty loud.\n\nSee our best Dell laptop recommendations.\n\nHP, also known as Hewlett-Packard, is an American company founded in 1939. As one of the oldest tech companies in the world, HP has produced a wide range of products, including calculators, digital cameras, personal digital assistants, scanners, printers, desktop computers, and laptops. It's currently among the top three laptop manufacturers in market share. Its varied laptop lineup includes popular brands like ENVY, Spectre, Pavilion, EliteBook, ZBook, Victus, and OMEN. HP also makes many Chromebooks, offering both budget-friendly and premium models like the HP Chromebook 14 (2021) and the recent HP Dragonfly Pro Chromebook.\n\nThe best HP laptop we've tested is the HP Spectre x 360 14 (2024), a premium 2-in-1 convertible designed for general productivity. It has a nice OLED display with stylus support, a great keyboard and touchpad, and an amazing 4k webcam. Its Intel Meteor Lake CPU can easily handle tasks like web browsing, text processing, spreadsheets, and even more demanding workloads like programming and photo editing. Thermal throttling is minimal despite its thin and compact design, and the laptop doesn't get hot or loud. You get a fingerprint sensor and a facial recognition camera for quick logins.\n\nWe recommend the HP OMEN Transcend 14 (2024) if you want an HP gaming laptop. This 14-inch model is a jack-of-all-trades gaming and content-creation laptop. It features Intel Meteor Lake CPUs and various NVIDIA GPUs, from an entry-level RTX 4050 to an 80W (TGP) RTX 4070. Its 120Hz 2.8K OLED display is bright and colorful; however, its response time is only decent, and there's no VRR support to reduce screen tearing. The keyboard feels great to type on, and there are many ports, including an HDMI 2.1 port that can output a 4K 120Hz signal. Battery life is short at a little over an hour of gaming, so you'll have to play with the laptop plugged in most of the time.\n\nLenovo is a Chinese company and one of the largest laptop manufacturers in the world. Lenovo's current laptop lineup is vast and includes popular brands like IdeaPad, Legion, Yoga, and ThinkBook. The company is often at the forefront of new technology and experiments with more unique form factors and features, like laptops with an e-ink display on the lid, dual-screen laptops, and ultrawide laptops with a 21:9 display. Lenovo's laptops are often among the best value models you can get, whether you're looking for a cheap Chromebook or a premium mobile workstation. A source of frustration with Lenovo is its tendency to give the same product multiple names, confusing the average consumer.\n\nThe best Lenovo laptop we've tested is the Lenovo Slim Pro 7 14 (2023), a budget-friendly 14-inch mobile workstation. It feels sturdy and provides an excellent user experience with its sharp display, tactile keyboard, and large touchpad. You can configure the laptop with an AMD Ryzen 5 or 7 CPU paired with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 discrete GPU. The Ryzen CPUs and the RTX 3050 aren't the most powerful on the market, but you're still getting a fair amount of processing power for the price. The main downside is that you can only get 16GB of soldered RAM.\n\nLenovo is no stranger to the gaming scene and produces some of the best gaming laptops on the market, like the Lenovo Legion Pro 5 Gen 8 16 (2023). This 16-inch model is available with powerful AMD CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs, up to an RTX 4070 running at a TGP of 140W, so it has tons of processing power to provide a smooth gaming experience. You can get the laptop with a 165Hz or 240Hz QHD+ display; both have a fast response time and VRR support to reduce screen tearing. Unfortunately, the laptop is a little bulky, and its battery lasts an hour or so when gaming.\n\nFor more about the brand's laptops, check out our recommendations for the best Lenovo laptops.\n\nMicrosoft is well-known as the creator of the Windows operating system. Although it has made computer peripherals since the 1980s, its Surface line of personal computers is relatively young, with the first device released back in 2012. Microsoft has popularized the 2-in-1 tablet form factor with its Surface Pros, and it often makes devices with unique features, like the Surface Laptop's Alcantara-covered keyboard deck and the Surface Book's detachable display. Microsoft has a relatively small lineup, focusing almost solely on productivity and media consumption devices. Its laptops are usually well-built and provide a great user experience, but they're more expensive than similar models from other brands.\n\nThe Microsoft Surface Laptop 5 (2022) is the best Microsoft laptop. This premium ultraportable is available in a 13.5-inch or 15-inch size, so you can choose based on your preference. It provides an amazing user experience with its sharp 3:2 display, comfortable keyboard, and responsive touchpad. The webcam is excellent despite its 720p resolution, and there's also an IR camera for quick logins via facial recognition. You can configure it with an Intel 12th Gen Core i5 or i7 CPU; both are fast enough for general productivity tasks. Unfortunately, its port selection is limited, and the battery lasts only around eight hours of light use. A quick FYI: there's a new Surface Laptop (7th Edition) coming; we've ordered it and will test it, so stay tuned.\n\nAlso worth mentioning is the Surface Pro 2-in-1 tablet PC. We've tested the Microsoft Surface Pro 8 (2021), and it's a good device overall; however, it's an older model that's getting hard to find, and Microsoft has released a newer model. This new 11th edition of the Surface Pro (and Surface Laptop) is another attempt at an ARM-based device sporting Qualcomm's Snapdragon X SoC. Performance seems promising from early reports, though it's hard to say how well Microsoft's new Prism translation layer will work in various x86 programs. We've also purchased this model and will test it once received. In the meantime, you can see more details here."
