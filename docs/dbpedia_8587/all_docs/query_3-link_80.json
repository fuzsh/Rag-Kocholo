        "text": "The global \"green\" enterprise IT study released by Strategic Oxygen and Cohn & Wolfe reveals that Dell is the number one green technology brand, recognized for its extensive recycling program, the top ranked attribute sought by IT buyers. HP, IBM and Microsoft were noted for their energy efficient products and use of sustainable materials, while Apple held its position in the top five for designing products that are perceived to have a green look and feel.\n\nFor this survey Strategic Oxygen surveyed more than 3,500 enterprise IT decision makers -- including CXOs, CIOs, IT Managers and Line of Business Managers - in 11 countries. The study also looked at 26 enterprise technology brands to determine decision makers' perceptions of \"green\" IT, products and marketing. For the purposes of the study, \"green technology\" was defined as having efficient power consumption, recyclable/reusable packaging, recycling offers for older equipment, use of non-toxic materials, or making investments in future \"green\" concepts such as alternative materials.\n\nGlobal IT buyers continue to see little differentiation among the various green offerings, yet brand rankings among companies shifted somewhat with Dell at 30% moving to number one, replacing HP, which fell to number two at 26%. Similar to the July findings, no single enterprise IT brand is a clear \"green\" leader globally and there is little statistical difference between the leaders.\n\nAccording to Michael Gale, president of Strategic Oxygen, \"As we watch companies make financial commitments to the environment with innovation and marketing, it is interesting that the differentiation among the various brands is so small. However, given Dell's long-term and consistent commitment to sustainability, I am not surprised to see it at the top. The challenge is going to be building differentiated value over time.\"\n\nThe research findings have identified two distinctive segments that IT buyers use to judge companies -- \"Brand Products\" and \"Brand Operations.\"\n\nThe Brand Product attributes that most clearly impact purchase decision include:\n\nProduces hardware that is made from biodegradable/recyclable materials\n\nDesigns products or packaging that appears to be green because the design looks clean\n\nOffers recycling programs for old hardware\n\nProduces energy efficient products\n\nPromotes a green image of themselves\n\nBrand Operations attributes include having green facilities (manufacturing and/or data canters), using green shipping methods (e.g. non-wasteful packaging, efficient transportation), or leading in developing new green technologies.\n\nIT buyers currently rank Brand Product higher than Brand Operations when making purchase decisions, but an IT vendor's ability to effectively demonstrate environmental stewardship in both areas gives them a distinct advantage.\n\nLaptops and servers are the top products IT buyers indicate they will purchase within the next twelve months, according to the survey, and green attributes figure prominently in buyer requirements.\n\nTo view the study visit www.greenfactorstudy.com.\n\nInterested in information related to this topic?
