        "text": "AI heralds a new era of innovation for every business in every industry, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang said Monday during an appearance at Dell Technologies World.\n\n“We now have the ability to manufacture intelligence,” Huang said during an on-stage conversation with Dell CEO Michael Dell. “The last industrial revolution was the manufacturing of software; previously, it was manufacturing electricity — now we are manufacturing intelligence.”\n\nTogether with Michael Dell, ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott and Samsung SDS President and CEO Hwang Sung-woo, Huang shared his insights on the transformative impact of generative AI on the global economy and various industries.\n\nDuring the keynote, Dell and NVIDIA announced a slew of updates to the Dell AI Factory.\n\nThis includes the Dell PowerEdge XE9680L server with liquid cooling and eight NVIDIA Blackwell Tensor Core GPUs, the industry’s densest, energy-efficient rack-scale solutions for large Blackwell GPU deployments.\n\nThe Dell NativeEdge platform will automate the delivery of NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, helping developers and IT operators easily deploy AI applications and solutions at the edge. Advancements also include the ability to simplify AI application development for faster time to value with the integration of NVIDIA NIM inference microservices, deployment automation and more.\n\nHuang discussed the concept of an AI factory, likening it to the factories of the last industrial revolution that used water to produce electricity. In the current industrial revolution, data centers act as AI factories, transforming data and electricity into valuable data tokens distributed globally.\n\n“What has happened is instead of just producing software, we’re now producing intelligence — that intelligence is formulated in the form of tokens that can then be expressed in any information modality that we’d like it to be,” Huang explained.\n\nHuang underscored the importance of full-stack accelerated computing to enable this, noting NVIDIA’s advancements.\n\nTogether, NVIDIA and Dell are providing the world’s industries with a full-stack offering — including computing, networking, storage, services and software — that drives copilots, coding assistants, virtual customer service agents and industrial digital twins.\n\nMichael Dell introduced the latest innovations for the Dell AI Factory with NVIDIA, emphasizing their ability to simplify and accelerate customers’ AI journeys.\n\n“We are unleashing this super genius power. Everyone is going to have access to this technology — and it’s gonna get smarter,” Dell said.\n\nThe Dell AI Factory with NVIDIA, announced earlier this year, offers a full stack of AI solutions from data center to edge, enabling organizations to quickly adopt and deploy AI at scale.\n\nThis platform integrates Dell’s AI capabilities with NVIDIA’s cutting-edge technologies, providing customers with an expansive AI portfolio and an open ecosystem of technology partners.\n\nThe Dell AI Factory, based on the NVIDIA partnership, will help establish AI sovereignty for countries by enabling strong data security and customized AI service development.\n\nTogether, Dell and NVIDIA will bring these capabilities to companies, help stand it up, and help develop new applications that enterprises can deploy, Huang said.\n\n“Our partnership between us is really about that, literally from the ground up building AI factories and delivering it to the world’s enterprises as a solution,” Huang said."
