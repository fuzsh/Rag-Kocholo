Michael Dell founded Dell Computer Corporation in 1984 while a student at the University of Texas at Austin. Operating from his dorm room, Dell started selling IBM PC-compatible computers built from stock components directly to customers. This allowed Dell to better understand customer needs and provide effective computing solutions. Dell dropped out of school to focus full-time on the growing business. Dell produced its first computer in 1985 and continued expanding globally throughout the 1980s and 1990s. It began selling computers online in 1996. Dell faced challenges in the 2000s from tablets and cloud computing while competitors invested more in these emerging technologies.",
