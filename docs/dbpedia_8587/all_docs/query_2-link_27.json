        "text": "“Tomorrow is Dell’s 32nd birthday, and today, I’m taking the stage at EMC World to stand in front of nearly 14,000 customers, partners, users and developers and speak with them about creating their most important technology partner.\n\nI am also going to announce the name of our combined company, and I wanted you to be among the first to know that after the close of the transaction, our family of businesses will officially be known as Dell Technologies.\n\nDell Technologies will include the combined technologies, companies and brands of Dell, EMC, VMware, Pivotal, SecureWorks, RSA and Virtustream.\n\nOur Client Solutions business will be branded Dell. The brand equity in the Dell PC is irreplaceable. We have incredible momentum, gaining share in 13 straight quarters. The business is absolutely core to our vision of technology infrastructure and our ability to drive innovation at scale at the edge. And above all, it’s critically important to our customers.\n\nOur combined enterprise business will be named Dell EMC. Both companies stand for something very special to you and our customers. And our combination is absolutely about bringing together the very best of us both. We are so proud of what we’re creating, and we want our teams and entire ecosystem to feel that same pride, belonging and excitement.\n\nOur vision is for a strategically aligned family of businesses that brings together our customers’ entire infrastructure – from hardware to software to services, from the edge to the core to the cloud – so they don’t have to. We will be the leaders in traditional technology of today and cloud-native infrastructure of tomorrow.\n\nWe’ll maintain and invest in strong independent ecosystems and open architectures, so that customers have choice and flexibility and so they can buy with confidence in all of our roadmaps, warrantees and service agreements.\n\nImportantly, we’ll also align our capabilities across our family of businesses where it makes strategic sense to deliver integrated solutions in areas like public, private and hybrid cloud, and security, and in seamless technology infrastructure from the industry’s leading converged platforms to the sensors, gateways, PCs and Virtual PCs at the edge of the Internet of Things. Ultimately, we’ll be in our strongest position ever to ensure the success of our customers and partners, today and into the future.\n\nAll together, we are Dell Technologies. I think it has nice ring and I hope all of our team members, customers and partners feel included under our family umbrella and are as excited as I am about what is coming next.\n\nIt’s hard to believe the success we’ve had during the last 32 years. Our little start-up has generated more than $935 billion in cumulative revenue, and we’ve invested in our team members, our capabilities and innovation to create ever more customer value. Now with the EMC transaction moving forward as planned, I think we’re about to get a whole lot bigger and able to do a whole lot more for customers. You better believe the best is yet to come.”"
