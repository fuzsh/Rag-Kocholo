        "text": "A company that began in a University of Texas dorm room 35 years ago has since transformed into the largest publicly traded company in the area. Headquartered in Round Rock, Dell Technologies has an extensive presence across Texas and is a testament to the state’s strong business climate.\n\nTexas has attracted many innovative companies over the years, but few have left the same impact as Dell. Founded in Austin, the technology company still calls this metro area home, with its central headquarters located in Round Rock since 1996. It is considered one of the pillars of the tech sector in Central Texas, generating annual revenues worth more than $90 billion.\n\nDell has transformed the suburb of Round Rock, bringing environmentally friendly energy sources to the forefront and investing millions into the local economy. The company’s name is visible across the region, but Dell has given back to the broader Central Texas community in other ways, providing aid during hurricanes as well as the COVID-19 pandemic. With strong roots in Central Texas, Dell consistently works to return the many favors that have helped build the company over the years.\n\nA trendsetter of sorts, the brand today finds itself in good company. Major offices in the greater Austin area, for example, include other tech giants like Apple, Google, IBM and Samsung. Home to a dynamic population and plenty of resourceful and attractive talent, the Austin area continues to be one of the best places for tech companies to join the ranks of companies like Dell."
