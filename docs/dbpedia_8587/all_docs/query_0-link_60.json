If this is an OEM copy of windows it might be on the tab. That said I have never seen a 710 that has the windows key sticker on it.\n\nIf it's a rack server it's most commonly on the top cover, or the back. If it's a tower it's usually on the back or the side. In any case it should be pretty easy to find unless the server is burried in the DC."
