If you can connect to it via VNC/RDP then you can find it using (1) wmic\n\nC:\\Users\\Sathya>wmic bios get serialnumber SerialNumber CR8XXXX\n\nOr (2) via this link\n\nHit F2 before it boots up, and look around in the BIOS screen. Dells often have their Service Tag displayed there. If it doesn't match the one on the bottom of the laptop, then you've found the real Service Tag. If it does match, then that is highly likely it's an issue on Dell's end.\n\nWhy not email Dell support and tell them your order number and any other pertinent information that you have from your invoice. They should be able to provide you with the service tag as I'm sure they have it tied to your order in some way.\n\nI'm presuming that you purchased the laptop as a gift for someone else and would like to take advantage of the upgrade. First, I am not sure that you would be able to use the upgrade for yourself as it may be tied to Dell systems (a common practice of OEMs)\n\nHowever, if you are trying to get the upgrade for the person you gave the laptop to, then why not either call them and get the tag number from them or let them know about the upgrade?"
