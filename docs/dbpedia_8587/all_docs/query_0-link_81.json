        "text": "So back in November, we had a broken laptop screen. I contacted ProSupport, we deduced it was an out of warranty repair (I was expecting that), and went through the process of purchasing a replacement screen for the laptop\n\nEverything went swimmingly, except… we received two screens, not one. No problem, one of them came with a return label so we slapped the label on it and sent it back (per the advice of the Dell tech I had talked to for the original replacement.)\n\n**Two months later (January)** , we receive a third replacement screen. No return shipping label, so after numerous incidents of going back-and-forth with Dell I eventually decide this is taking way more of my time to fix Dell’s mistake than it should have, and they stopped asking for anything back after my replies. Not what I’d call resolved, but whatever. (I still have the screen in a box in my office, and would love to send it back and get this sorted out by the way!)\n\nLast month , I had a dock with nonfunctioning USB ports. It ended up being covered under warranty, and the packing slip for the replacement clearly states “* If this is replacement order, the part you have just received does NOT require a return of the defective part. You have NOT received a preprinted courier airbill, or a preprinted courier adhesive label and you are NOT required to return the defective part.”* I was a little surprised, but went “Well that’s handy, everything else about the old dock works fine so I’m sure I can find a use for it.”\n\nToday , I receive an invoice and final notice stating that I have “not responded to our numerous requests to return the original equipment”, referencing the dock in question. I haven’t seen any of these requests and I was told I don’t need to return the equipment, and the “Please contact us immediately” phone number results in 3 minutes of hold followed by voicemail. (I’ve also learned that the tech support chat – which I’d vastly prefer over talking on the phone – can’t help with these sorts of issues.)\n\nIs there any easy way to get all of this sorted out? Any of the Dell green guys able to help me out here?\n\n@Dell_Technologies\n\n@ivan-dell\n\nFinally got them to actually answer.\n\nApparently, since the dock was valued over $50 I was supposed to send back the old one – despite the packing slip clearly stating otherwise. (And, of course, since it didn’t seem necessary to return I recycled the box…)\n\nI particularly liked the part where the invoice claimed they tried multiple times to contact me (not once was I contacted). Oh well, I managed to scrounge together another box and some packing material and have it in the office queue for pickup.\n\nFinally managed to hopefully resolve the “extra LCD screen” issue too, though it’s highly likely the warranty on that system is suspended (Thanks, Dell) despite my repeatedly asking for instructions on how to deal with the problem.\n\nI think the amount of time I’ve had to spend dealing with this level of incompetence cost more than the parts did! (And then I compiled 15 pages of documentation…)\n\nStill, not very happy about all of this. I was hoping to get actual work done today – the kind my employer pays me for, not the kind Dell’s not paying me for.\n\nHad a similar issue last night actually, Dell warranty for a PSU, I returned the PSU the next day after receiving it (March 12th) last night I received a “Final Invoice” for the cost of the PSU and wording stating that they have tried to contact me numerous times without success and thus I was being invoiced for the non-returned part. I always keep track of the return shipping information so I did a quick USPS Parcel post check and found that it was picked up on March 13th and is stating currently in transit still. I contacted Dell @ 1-866-901-8629 and someone answered within 15 seconds no prompts or anything. She asked for the DPU number I provided it to her and told her I had returned the part and had the shipping confirmation information. She put me on hold for maybe 30 seconds and then came back and stated they did indeed receive the part and that they had not properly updated the information and she would do that. So figures crossed it’s all set. Try that number it’s the fastest I’ve ever gotten through to anyone at Dell."
