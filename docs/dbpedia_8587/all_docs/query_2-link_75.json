        "text": "SWOT Analysis of Dell 2023\n\nThis is Dell Inc. SWOT analysis. Learn how to do a SWOT analysis.\n\nCompany Overview\n\nDell Inc. is an American multinational computer technology corporation that develops, sells, repairs and supports computers and related products and services. The company is one of the largest technological corporations in the world and is listed as number 44 in the Fortune 500 list. It is the third largest PC vendor in the world after HP and Lenovo.\n\nYou can find more information about the business in its official website or Wikipedia’s article.\n\nDell SWOT Analysis\n\nStrengths\n\nBrand name. Dell has a very strong brand reputation for quality products. Its brand is valued at $ 7.5 billion.\n\nProduct customization. Dell allows its customers to customize their laptops. Such services were not originally found within any other major computer retailer (and currently only Sony and Toshiba allow that), but add great value to the customers and provides Dell with a competitive advantage.\n\nEnvironmental record. Dell is engaged in many green initiatives and has received many rewards for being an eco-friendly business. This is a benefit when working with public and government agencies.\n\nCompetency in mergers and acquisitions. Over the last five years Dell has spent $13 billion for successful mergers and acquisitions, which brought patents, new capabilities, assets and skills to the business.\n\nDirect selling business model. Dell doesn’t sell its products through big-box retail outlets but instead sells directly to consumers and enterprises, keeping their already thin profit margin to themselves.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nCommodity products. The large stream of Dell’s revenues comes from computer, especially laptop, sales, which is a commoditized product. Computer hardware (commodity) products are sold with a very low profit margin.\n\nPoor customer services. Once praised, Dell’s customer services deteriorated due to outsourcing its call centers offshore. Dell invested a large sum of money in fixing this, but hasn’t yet regained its previous reputation for customer services.\n\nLow investments in R&D. The company spends a much lower percentage of its income on R&D that its main competitors and thus, missed an opportunity to develop strong products for smartphones and tablet markets as well as to learn new skill and capabilities.\n\nWeak patent portfolio. Due to low spending on R&D Dell hasn’t acquired a strong portfolio of patents and is now finds it hard to compete in lucrative smartphones and tablets market.\n\nToo few retail locations. Selling products online saves money and allows for product customization but provides less visibility for the products. The consumer finds it hard to trust the products if it can’t hold it first in his hands.\n\nLow differentiation. Low price was once Dell’s competitive advantage but the company is no longer able to provide competitive prices. Apart from the price, Dell’s products are little differentiated from competitors’ products and are in competitive disadvantage if the price offered by competitor is lower.\n\nOpportunities\n\nExpand services and enterprise solutions divisions. Dell provides various services (cloud, security and infrastructure) and enterprise solutions (servers, networking and storage), which are the most profitable Dell’s business at the moment. Dell business should focus on growing these divisions as they promise better growth opportunities and higher profit margins.\n\nObtain more patents through acquisitions. If Dell wants to diversify, it needs new technology patents and new ideas. Dell hasn’t properly established its R&D facilities to discover new technologies and patents, so the only feasible way to obtain patents and technologies is to acquire other companies.\n\nStrengthen their presence in emerging markets. Emerging economies are the fastest growing markets for laptops, tablets and other electronic devices. Dell has a good presence in these markets but should strengthen its position as the company experiences declining market share.\n\nTablet market growth. Tablet market is expected to grow in double digits for the next few years and the company has a great opportunity to release new tablet models and benefit from the market growth.\n\nThreats\n\nGrowing demand for smartphones and tablets. With a lower price and strongly improved capabilities, consumers often choose tablets and smartphones over laptops. The growing demand for the previous devices takes a share out of laptops, the main stream of revenue for Dell.\n\nProfit margin decline on hardware products. Dell’s main income is from selling hardware products, which prices will increase in the future due to rising raw material prices. This will add to costs for Dell and will further cut the profit margin.\n\nSlowing growth rate of the laptops market. Growth rate of the computer market is slowing down and in the near future the markets will become saturated. It will prove hard for Dell to compete in such market or at least fight back the lost market share.\n\nIntense competition. The company faces intense competition in all its business segments. It competes in terms of price, quality, brand, technology, reputation, distribution and range of products, with Acer, Apple, HP, IBM, Lenovo and Toshiba.\n\nSources\n\nArthur, C. (2012).
