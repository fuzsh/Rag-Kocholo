        "text": "Dell entered the market in 1985, and evolved from a small, dorm-room based company in Texas to one of the world’s leading computer hardware manufacturers, with over 96,000 employees.\n\nAmong other things, the brand owes a lot of its success to its revolutionary supply chain strategy. Let’s take a look inside Dell’s supply chain and see how it helped the company grow at a rapid pace from the start, and reinvent itself later on.\n\nTo get started, let’s take a look at the key achievements of Dell:\n\n1984: The company was founded by Michael Dell in Austin, Texas.\n\n1985: The company produced the first computer of its own design and sold it for $795.\n\n1988: Dell Computer’s market capitalization grew from$30 million to $80 million as a result of an IPO of 3.5 million shares at $8.5 per share.\n\n1992: The company is featured in the world’s top 500 largest companies by Fortune magazine.\n\n1996: The future retail giant started selling computers directly via its website and embraced the B2C market.\n\n1997 to 2004: Period of stable growth, when Dell surpassed its main competitors: AST Research Compaq, Gateway, IBM and Packard Bell.\n\n2002 to 2003: The company started manufacturing digital audio players, handhelds, printers and TV sets in addition to computers. To recognize this expansion, the company was rebranded from Dell Computer Corporation to “Dell Inc.” in 2003.\n\n2005: Dell was ranked as “The Most Admired Company” by Fortune magazine.\n\n2010: Dell switched from a one-size-fits-all to a segmented supply chain model.\n\nUnfortunately, the company faced a series of challenges and disappointments after 2005, such as slow sales, losses to competitors and new technologies along with the decline of the PC industry. But despite these hardships, Dell Inc. still maintains a large market.\n\nIn other words, it’s still worth seeing how the Dell supply chain strategy keeps the company afloat.\n\nDell Supply Chain Models, Explained\n\nThe most remarkable feature of Dell’s supply chain management is its direct sales model, meaning that it accepts orders directly from the customers, without any resellers involved.\n\nThis model helped the company access its customers and study their needs directly. Based on this data, the brand implemented additional products and services according to customers’ preferences. This made it stand out among other computer hardware manufacturers early on.\n\nAnother model that led Dell to success is the make-to-order model:\n\nHere’s a brief overview of how it works:\n\nCustomer place orders on Dell’s website. In this order, the customer specifies their requirements, like the computer configuration and specifications.\n\nThe customer’s requirements are forwarded to the manufacturing department.\n\nThe assembly of the custom PC begins.\n\nThe computer is ready and shipped to the customer.\n\nThis model brought the retailer a range of competitive advantages, such as low inventory carrying costs and the ability to quickly replace defective components as they are detected.\n\nHowever, due to the growth of innovative technologies and changes in the computer industry, the customers changed their needs as well. Customization was no longer crucial for them.\n\nSo in 2010, the company reinvented its supply chain and shifted to the segmented model that targeted several groups of customers with different needs and buying capacity.\n\nThe brand learned the following lessons:\n\nGive customers more flexibility and choices, as one size almost never fits all.\n\nAdjust the solutions to the customer’s needs and requirements.\n\nMake the products and processes simpler but more efficient.\n\nFocus on continuous improvement.\n\nThe core of the brand’s success in its earlier years was its relationships with the customers and ability to hear their needs, and the reinvention of Dell’s supply chain was focused mostly on customer relationships.\n\nDell Supply Chain Strategy, Reinvented\n\nTo restructure its supply chain, the company implemented the following solutions:\n\nGlobal structure instead of regional structure, with three business units – enterprise, public, and consumer/small business.\n\nStandardized offers including the most frequently purchased configurations.\n\nSegmented model instead of a one-size-fits-all model.\n\nInfrastructure that corresponds to the changing needs of the business.\n\nStandard yet flexible processes that leverage global partnerships.\n\nCustomer priorities aligned according to speed, choice and cost.\n\nReady-made, in-stock systems for quick delivery.\n\nOptimization of global IT infrastructure.\n\nDell’s renovated supply chain model groups the customers and products chosen by them into the following key segments:\n\nCustomers with specific needs – configurable products\n\nCustomers that choose the company as a trusted advisor – preconfigured products\n\nCustomers that value speed – finished goods purchased either directly or through the website\n\nAccordingly, the brand implemented different supply chains targeting these groups of customers. However, all of the chains were using the same tools, processes and suppliers.\n\nDell’s Suppliers and Inventory Management\n\nLike other retail giants, Dell has long-term relationships with suppliers that help the brand streamline their inventory management as well. The company considers its vendors to be an integral part of its success.\n\nThe key objective of Dell’s inventory management is to minimize the inventory and optimize the production speed. As a result, the company does not hold inventory for more than 6 days and avoids unnecessary carrying costs.\n\nThe retail giant has got suppliers from all over the world, including major companies such as Motorola, Samsung, Sony and more. All of them supply the components – HDDs, cables, motherboards, etc. according to a set of rules provided by Dell.\n\nFor example, it is strongly advised that each supplier have a manufacturing plant near Dell’s plant. The suppliers should also cooperate with logistics companies that can both deliver the components and ship the customer orders. Finally, the company manages its inventory based on the VMI model, meaning the supplied components are kept on the truck only and taken as needed while the vendor manages the inventory.\n\nDell and its suppliers communicate with each other via an internal website called Value Chain. At this website, the companies can access information about the inventory status within the supply chain as well as get demand and production data.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Dell’s Supply Chain\n\nTo summarize, Dell has been a successful player in the computer hardware market since the very beginning because of its innovative supply chain strategies.\n\nDespite the hard times in the early 2000s, its customer-centric model helped Dell remain afloat. In 2010, the retailer reinvented its supply chain according to the changing needs of its target audience. That just goes to show that renewing and improving your supply chain strategy continuously can go a long way."
