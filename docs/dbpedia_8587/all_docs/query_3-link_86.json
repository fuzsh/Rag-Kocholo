        "text": "Hereâs what youâll learn from Dell's strategy study:\n\nHow to sustain your companyâs growth beyond its initial success.\n\nHow a sober bet for the future fuels your conviction to win.\n\nHow to think long-term and not sacrifice your future for short-term benefits.\n\nDell Technologies is a multinational technology company that designs, develops, and sells a wide range of products and services, including personal computers (PCs), servers, data storage devices, network switches, software, and cloud solutions.\n\nThe general public owns 58% of Dell Technologies, while private equity firms and institutions own the rest. Michael Dell is the founder, chairman, and current CEO.\n\nDell's market share and key statistics:\n\nBrand value of $26,5 billion\n\nNet Worth of $28.7 billion as of Jan 13, 2023\n\nAnnual revenue of $105.3 billion for 2022\n\nTotal number of employees: 133.000\n\nTotal assets worldwide: $93 billion in 2022\n\n{{cta('e9abffcd-5522-40c9-be83-0e844633a49a')}}\n\nHumble beginnings: How did Dell start?\n\nThe story of every company starts with the story of its founder.\n\nUsually, a great company has a great founder story behind it. And Dell Technologies certainly has one. Michael Dellâs story goes hand in hand with the story of the company he founded. By understanding the story of Michael, we can understand the companyâs initial advantages and opportunities it pursued.\n\nAnd like every great tech company story, Dellâs story starts in a college dorm room.\n\nFrom stamps to startups: Michael Dell's early years and the birth of Dell\n\nMichael Dell founded the company in college, but his entrepreneurial journey started much earlier.\n\nHe had an early interest in technology and business, and by the age of 12, he was already buying and selling stamps and coins to make extra money. As a teenager, he worked summer jobs where he learned by trial and error how demand and supply worked, how to be efficient, how to segment the market, and determine the most profitable persona to sell.\n\nBy the time he graduated from high school, he had saved up enough money to buy his own BMW and his first personal computer, an Apple and later an IBM.\n\nBut he was curious about the inner workings of these machines and, to his parents' horror, he took them apart, learning about the different components and how they worked together. He soon made a crucial discovery. IBM DIDNâT manufacture its own parts. Instead, it sourced them from other companies. This sparked an idea in Michael's mind - he could build his own PCs using the same components but at a lower cost and higher quality.\n\nThat idea didnât come out of the blue.\n\nMichael Dell was constantly educating himself on computers, how to build them, how they worked, and how to code. He followed all computer magazines at the time and attended every event in his neighborhood to network and learn the latest about the industry. In high school, he was already an expert, modifying his own PC and, once the word spread, customizing the PCs of professionals.\n\nHis first customers were friends and acquaintances who were impressed by his knowledge and expertise. Michael quickly realized that there was a demand for customized computers that were not available in the market. He began assembling machines with increased storage capacity and memory at a fraction of the cost of buying from big brands like IBM.\n\nDoctors and lawyers were among his early customers, and word-of-mouth about Michael's high-quality and affordable PCs spread quickly.\n\nHe eliminated the middleman by buying components directly and assembling the machines himself, which allowed him to offer lower prices and better performance. By the end of his first year in college, Michael had a vendor's license, he was winning bids against established companies in the industry, and he incorporated his first company, âDell Computer Corporation.â\n\nDellâs direct-to-consumer strategy & how its corporate culture was formed\n\nThe company was growing frightfully fast, forcing the team to constantly change and evolve its processes.\n\nBefore the company had its second birthday, they had moved to bigger offices three times to accommodate its increased inventory, growing telephone needs, and physical or electronic systems. However, the company was still a high-risk venture and had a small capacity for expensive mistakes.\n\nIn those early days, the challenges Dell faced formed its processes and the core traits of its culture that are present to this day:\n\nPracticality and reduced bureaucracy.\n\nThey did some things unconventionally, like having salespeople set up their own computers. That way, they gained first-hand knowledge of the technology and the customerâs pain problems (customers and salespeople were uneducated on the technology, so they shared the same problems).\n\nA âcan-doâ and âIâll-pitch-inâ attitude.\n\nEmployees took substantial liberties with their âresponsibilities.â Engineers would help with the overloaded manufacturing line, everyone would answer phone calls, salespeople would fulfill orders while taking new ones, etc.\n\nA sense of making a difference.\n\nMoney was tight, so Dell employees wouldnât mind solving secondary âneedsâ with cheap solutions like using cardboard boxes to throw their trash because they didnât have trash cans.\n\nDirect relationships with the customers.\n\nMaybe one of the most important aspects of Dellâs culture and strategy. The company was talking at the same time with prospects and current customers on the phone. That way, it got first-hand feedback on what the market was currently asking for and was enjoying or not enjoying. That gave birth to DellâsÂ âDirect Model.â\n\nThe company went to great lengths to build and maintain the direct model because it was one of its most important sources of competitive advantage. Where other companies had to guess what to build next, Dell was already on it because their customers were telling them.\n\nThere were clear advantages to the Direct model:\n\nClosed feedback loop.\n\nDell was talking directly to prospects â no dealer costs â and had no need for inventory. Lower costs = lower prices = more customers. And with every new customer, Dell had another finger on the pulse of the market.\n\nA single salesforce.\n\nFocused solely on the end customer. There was no need to have salespeople to sell to dealers and then additional salespeople to sell to the customer.\n\nSpecialization in sales.\n\nDell sold to large corporations, and smaller customers, like SMBs, educational institutions, and individual consumers. But selling to these two different buyers, large corporations and SMBs, was incomparable. So, the company had different salespeople for different customer segments and thus offering the best customer support and experience.\n\nBut the model wasnât without its disadvantages:\n\nThe model wasnât irreplicable.\n\nDell was making IBM-compatible PCs and selling them directly to customers. This model wasnât hard to replicate, and the marketâs conditions favored the birth of competitors with the same model.\n\nLack of credibility.\n\nItâs hard to make a $5,000 sale when the customer has never heard of you and you lack a physical store.\n\nIncompatibility.\n\nDellâs PC had to be compatible with IBMâs. But they had multiple suppliers for their components and sometimes those components were incompatible. Designing high-quality machines that were outperforming and compatible with IBMâs was a challenge.\n\nBut these disadvantages didnât stop the team. The company doubled down on customer support and service and developed a strong reputation around them. It advertised a 30-day money-back guarantee and educated its suppliers to make components based on Dell designs. They even started their first R&D attempts that gave them aÂ 12-MHzÂ that was faster than IBMâs latest model, cheaper, and got them on the cover of the most prestigious magazine in the industry, theÂ PC Week.\n\nDellâs strategy was so effective that phone calls started coming in, urging them to accept capital and go public.\n\nOnly three years after the companyâs birth in a college dorm room, Dell went public, raising $30 million with a market valuation of $85 million.\n\nKey Takeaway #1: Build a coherent strategy beyond your initial differentiator to sustain growth\n\nMost companies enjoy initial success due to an untapped opportunity in the market, from addressing a niche market to exploiting the weaknesses of major players.\n\nBut no company succeeds at growing beyond the limits of the initial opportunity if it doesnât evolve and expand its competitive advantage. So when evaluating your next move, ask yourself:\n\nWhat is our current competitive advantage?\n\nHow easily can our competition replicate it?\n\nHow can we make it harder (if we can)?\n\nHow can we expand our capabilities to strengthen our current competitive advantage?\n\nHow can we develop new competitive advantages?\n\nWhat are the market trends and how can we adapt/take advantage of them before others?\n\nThe occasional bold move doesnât hurt, either.\n\nRecommended reading:Â 6 Competitive Analysis Frameworks: How to Leave Your Competition In the Dust\n\nHow Dellâs privatization led to a strategic triumph\n\nIn the first decade of the new millennium, the PC business was growing rapidly.\n\nComputing power followedÂ Mooreâs LawÂ and innovation cycles in hardware were less than 12 months long. At the same time, a new generation of software was spreading and the World Wide Web was expanding globally. Being a part of a growing industry, like the PC business back then, was lucrative. So naturally, many companies did well.\n\nDell was one of them. In 2000, the company became the worldâs largest seller of PCs, having enjoyed a decade of skyrocketing sales.\n\nHowever, in 2011, things changed. The PC global sales reached their peak and the next year was the first of an 8-year streak of decline that lasted until the pandemic hit.\n\nThat decline impacted Dell severely.\n\nNavigating decline: Dell's strategy for a shrinking market\n\nDell was in deep trouble at the start of the previous decade:\n\nIt had lost its position as a top PC seller in the US to its main competitor, HP.\n\nIt came third in the global PC market share, behind HP and ACER.\n\nMany believed that it was a dying company that would perish like Kodak or Motorola.\n\nThe PC market was shrinking and some experts were saying it was the beginning of its end. Dell was expected to be among the first casualties. The truth was that the PC industry wasnât dying, but it was evolving â it was losing some of its traits and gaining new ones. The difference is subtle but also key. In a competitive arena, every alert player is aware of the market changes: declining sales, emerging trends, and other important facts. But how each player interprets them determines whether theyâllÂ formulate a winning strategyÂ or not.\n\nThe more substantial the changes, the more important the interpretation.\n\nIn 2012, the fact was that the PC business was declining. Every major player could see it with a single glance at their balance sheet. In Dell's case, the decline was even direr since its PC sales were down by double digits. The company desperately needed to turn things around. And only a bold strategic move could do that.\n\nThe company tried to bounce back up with some obvious but desperate moves:\n\nThe introduction of the Streak âphablet.â\n\nAn embarrassing attempt at creating a new product category between tablets and smartphones. Its design was bulky and its Android software unsuitable for the device, while its purpose was unclear to the consumer.\n\nMaking Windows 8 its default operating system.\n\nDell and Microsoft have been longtime partners, to the benefit of both companies. Unfortunately, their growing interdependence meant that when one failed, it dragged the other one down. Windows 8 failure dragged down Dell and further decreased its PC market share.\n\nAttempts to enter the tablet and smartphone markets: the âVenueâ debacle.\n\nDell was always viewed as a PC company, not a technology company, making it harder to expand to new categories. Its first smartphone, theÂ Venue, ran on Windows Mobile and it never got any traction. As a result, the company abandoned the categories and, even today, it has less than negligible presence in these markets.\n\nBut where people saw a vulnerable company, Michael Dell saw an opportunity.\n\nHe had an assumption, a vision attached to it, and a plan to make it a reality. But he had no way to execute it with the companyâs organizational structure at the time.\n\n{{cta('e9abffcd-5522-40c9-be83-0e844633a49a')}}\n\nThe obstacles to implementing Dell's competitive strategy\n\nDellâs strategy was to go on the offensive. He wanted the company to be highly aggressive by:\n\nBecoming competitive in the PC business again.\n\nExpanding its services and software solutions.\n\nIncreasing its sales capacity.\n\nDell aimed to achieve these goals by investing heavily in R&D, gaining tighter control over its PC and server prices, and expanding its sales workforce. The idea was to fund new business capabilities in the software and services space from Dell's PC segment. That was a bold plan that involved a lot of changes and, thus, a lot of risks.\n\nDellâs strategy was essentially aÂ business transformationÂ proposal.\n\nAnd although a lot of public companies have successfully gone through a transformation, none did it in such a short period of time without sacrificing the short-term faith of its shareholders. And that was exactly the problem.\n\nThe strategy was inherently risky â like everyÂ good strategyÂ is â as it promised capital expenditure and an immediate decrease in profitability due to increased operating expenses. Things shareholders hate. And if shareholders arenât happy with the companyâs near-term returns, they start selling their shares, and the company loses its value and a good portion of its funding capabilities.Â\n\nShort-term risk = lower share prices = less funding for the company\n\nThus, the strategy was impossible to execute without the support of the shareholders. So the company had only two options: gain the support of the shareholders or go private.\n\nDell chose to go private.\n\nDell's game-changing decision was based on a strategic bet\n\nFor a gigantic public company with a market cap of nearly $20 billion, going private is a tough decision and a complicated process.\n\nBut it was an unavoidable preliminary for the successful execution of Michael Dellâs plan. And the first step was to convince the board of the necessity of the transformation. After announcing his idea, the board started discussions with experts to evaluate the move, i.e. top consulting agencies and other independent third parties.\n\nJP Morgan, Boston Consulting Group, Evercore, and Debevoise were some of the names involved. And they all shared the same view:\n\nThe PC is dying.\n\nFunding a business transformation from a declining business is a bad idea (despite such successful attempts fromÂ IBMÂ andÂ BMWÂ in the past).\n\nThe experts had a lot of facts and strong arguments to support their case. However, all of them were based on a single assumption:Â tablets and smartphones will replace the dying PC. The growth in those categories would entail a decline in the PC business. They believed the PC was about to be cannibalized.\n\nDellâs CEO disagreed. What was his assumption?\n\nHe believed that tablets and smartphones wouldnât take away from PCs but rather add to it. He believed that the PCâs central role in productivity and business wasnât going to be dethroned by the new shiny toys. People would buy and use tablets and smartphones, but PCs would remain their primary productivity tool.\n\nAnd he would bet Dellâs future on it.\n\nBut he had to convince the board of directors first. At the start, conversations were happening in secret and things were moving slowly but steadily. But when the idea was leaked, two new problems presented themselves.\n\nThe first was Carl Icahn, who contested for the ownership of Dell.Â Carl Icahn is a self-proclaimed âactivist investorâ but others call him a âcorporate raider.â The closer the go-private initiative was to happen, the more Carl Icahn fought for it. And he used every improper tool and method he could muster. The battle that followed between Carl and Michael delayed the deal and almost derailed it.\n\nThe second was Dellâs customersâ hesitation in doing business with the company.Â The rumors about the go-private initiative left the customers wondering about the future of Dell and doubted whether any kind of investment in it was worth it. They were suspending purchases and all Dellâs leadership could say was, âWe donât comment on rumors and speculations.â\n\nThe press had also concluded that the go-private initiative was a declaration of Michael Dellâs incompetence and a desperate attempt to keep Wall Streetâs eyes away from its demise.\n\nHistory would prove them wrong and crown Michael Dell victorious.\n\nA new chapter: How Dell's go-private move set the stage for future success\n\nThe deal happened.\n\nIn February 2013, Michael Dell and the investment firm of Silver Lake took Dell private in a leveraged buyout of $24.4 billion, at $13.65 a share.\n\nDespite all the time that passed until Dell could fully execute its strategy, the company didnât remain idle. It had made several calculated moves to significantly reduce its dependence on the declining PC market before the deal conversations ever happened.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2012, Dell spent north of $12.40 billion in key acquisitions to increase its enterprise software and hardware solutions, including cloud data storage and management. The acquisitions focused on areas like:\n\nData storage\n\nSystems management\n\nCloud\n\nSecurity\n\nData management in healthcare\n\nCutting edge software\n\nThe company had already started severing the connection between its financial health and its PC market share many years ahead of its privatization.\n\nBut after the buyout, it went all in. Speed and agility became its prominent advantages. Dell became, nearly overnight, a hungry, quick, and ready-to-attack-its-prey jackal. Whenever a new opportunity arose and people asked for resources to pursue it, leadership committed double the resources and said, \"Go faster!\"\n\nFor example, SMBs (small and medium businesses) presented a gigantic opportunity. So the company increased its sales workforce, retrained its existing salespeople, and hit endless SMB doors. They would enter a business selling their low-margin PCs and simultaneously become their trusted advisor on all things tech. Then they sold their whole portfolio of solutions.\n\nAnd the morale of employees was off the charts. Leadership kept their promises on the changes and provided all the support their people needed to execute the plan.\n\nIn addition, people started viewing PC and smartphones as complementary, just as Dell expected.\n\nWas Michael Dellâs bet a good one? Wellâ¦\n\n45% of Dellâs revenue was generated from PC sales, but 80% or more of its profits were generated by its new solutions. Eight years after the privatization, the value of their equity had increased more than 625% and their enterprise value reached $100 billion.\n\nWeâre pretty confident thatâs a yes.\n\nKey Takeaway #2: Successful strategic bets require a sober conviction\n\nMarkets change and evolve all the time. The difference between players that emerge prosperous and those that struggle to fit in the new order of things isnât the unique access to data.\n\nNo. Every alert player in your competitive zone has more or less the same access to market trends and changes. The difference lies in what you envision the future to be. Thatâs your bet.\n\nThatâs what a winning corporate strategy needs. And because bets are inherently risky, you require two things to place a successful bet:\n\nSobriety to envision what the future of your industry will look like.\n\nConviction to pursue that vision relentlessly.\n\nSteering towards success: Dell's current strategy and the EMC merger\n\nMichael Dell had foreseen the evolution of the technology industry since the 2000s.\n\nNot the specifics, but the trend of PCs and hardware becoming less relevant â or at least less profitable â and software, the cloud, and back-end taking the front seat. He realized (from very early on) that servers and storage management would become a huge concern for large enterprises building (or upgrading) their IT infrastructure.\n\nDell anticipated the marketâs needs by making a simple observation: the quantity of data in the world expanded exponentially and the traditional way of data management would require server performance that wasnât physically possible to achieve. But he knew there was a solution underway: virtualization â software that mimics the computer, creating virtual mainframes within the physical mainframe.\n\nThatâs why the company had started investing in these technologies since 2001.\n\nAchieving synergy: Dell's competitive strategy and the merger with EMC and VMware\n\nDell, EMC, and VMware are three major players in the technology industry with distinct but complementary offerings.\n\nEMCÂ had a successful product in networked information storage systems, i.e. a database management system for enterprises.\n\nVMwareÂ was pioneering in virtualization, allowing users to run multiple operating systems on the same device.\n\nDellÂ had an established distribution network and a series of back-end solutions that could expand and fit well with the former technologies.\n\nThe relationship between these three companies started in 2001. Dell and EMC entered a strategic alliance to rule a market of $100 billion worth by 2005.\n\nFor EMC, the alliance was a one-stone-three-birds initiative.Â First,Â it offered a lucrative distribution channel to customers their competitors were already targeting.Â Second,Â it ensured Dell wouldnât partner with a competitor.Â And third,Â it reduced its supply costs for components.\n\nFor Dell, it also had a threefold benefit.Â First,Â It added high-performing products to a rapidly growing business.Â Second,Â it gave it an important customer â EMC was using Dellâs servers.Â And third,Â it allowed Dell to infiltrate deeper into enterprise data centers.\n\nA strategic alliance that gave both Dell and EMC a competitive edge.\n\nThen EMC bought VMware. That gave the company massive capabilities around cloud infrastructure services ending up being a very lucrative move. Dell, which had invested in VMware back in 2002, saw a massive opportunity to acquire the new EMC.\n\nSo Dell and EMC first began discussions of a potential partnership back in 2008, but the idea was ultimately shelved due to the financial crisis. However, in 2014, Dell revisited the idea as both companies had grown and become leaders in their respective industries.\n\nDell saw the potential for a merger as the two companies' services would bring significant value to their customers when combined. EMC's CEO, Joe Tucci, agreed with this assessment, but they still had to convince EMC's board. EMC was publicly held while Dell was private, and as soon as the idea was on the table, Dell found itself competing with two other interested parties, Cisco Systems and HP. In fact, HP nearly succeeded in acquiring EMC.\n\nIt failed due to a financial disagreement. So Dell jumped on the opportunity.\n\nBy then, EMC had grown tremendously and had eliminated any short- to mid-term potential start-up disruptors by acquiring them. EMCâs three businesses were uniquely complementary to Dellâs solutions:\n\nEMC Information structure, a leader in the data storage system market.\n\nVMware, the undisputed leader in virtualization.\n\nPivotal, a start-up with a platform to develop cloud software.\n\nHowever, the acquisition was a tough process. EMC had grown to a market cap of over $60 billion. It was impossible for Dell to fund an acquisition. Instead, the two companies merged.\n\nThe merger happened through a complex but effective financial plan, and the synergies created by the combined company increased revenue significantly. A year after the merger was initiated, the added revenue was well above expectations. This allowed Dell to pay down a significant portion of its debt and improve its financial standing and investment rating. The success of the merger led the company to simplify its structure and align the interests of the stakeholders of the three companies.\n\nIn 2018, Dell went public again as a very different entity than its first IPO, uniquely equipped to lead the 5-S sectors:Â services, software, storage, servers, and security.\n\nWhat is Dellâs business strategyâs primary focus today?\n\nDell aspires to become a leading player in the data era by providing a wide range of solutions, products, and services.\n\nExcluding VMware, Dell is divided into two main business segments supported by its financial subsidiary:\n\nThe Infrastructure Solutions Group\n\nISG helps customers with theirÂ digital transformationÂ by providing multi-cloud and big data solutions that are built on modern data center infrastructure. These solutions are designed to work in multi-cloud environments and can handle workloads in public and private clouds as well as on-premise.\n\nThe Client Solutions Group\n\nCSG focuses on providing solutions for clients such as laptops, desktops, and other end-user devices.â\n\nDell Financial Services\n\nDFS supports Dell businesses by providing financial options and services to customers according to the companyâs flexible consumption models. Through DFS, the company tries to tailor its financial options to each customerâs way of consuming Dellâs solutions.\n\nDell's core offerings include servers, storage solutions, virtualization software, and networking solutions. The company is constantly investing in research and development, sales and other key areas to improve its products and solutions and to drive long-term growth.\n\nIts primary strategic priorities are:\n\nImproving and modernizing its current offerings in the markets it operates in.\n\nExpanding into new growth areas such as Edge computing, telecommunications, data management, and as-a-service consumption models.\n\nAnd its plan involves several keyÂ initiatives:\n\nDeveloping its flexible consumption models and as-a-Service options to customers to meet their financial needs and expectations.\n\nBuilding momentum in recurring revenue streams through multi-year agreements.\n\nInvesting in R&D to develop scalable technology solutions and incorporating AI and machine-learning technology. Since its Fiscal year 2020, the R&D budget is consistently at least $2.5 billion. Most of it goes towards developing the software that powers its solutions.\n\nCollaborating with a global network of technology companies for product development and integration of new technologies.\n\nInvesting in early-stage, privately-held companies through Dell Technologies Capital.\n\nAlthough Dell has a coherent strategy to achieve its objectives, competition isnât idle nor trivial in the core competitive arenas. The company faces a significant risk that includes:\n\nFailure to achieve intended benefits regarding the VMware spin-off.\n\nCompetition providing products and services that are cheaper and perform better.\n\nDelays in products, components, or software deliveries from single-source or limited-source suppliers.\n\nInability to effectively execute itsÂ business strategyÂ (transitioning sales capabilities, expanding solutions capabilities through acquisitions, etc.) and implement its cost efficiency measures.\n\nThe technological advances are rapid, and players are in a constant race to innovate not only on the technologies they provide but on their business models and all of their services and solutions. Emerging players and strategic relationships between competitors could easily shift the competitive landscape before the company finds a way to react.\n\nKey Takeaway #3: When making transformational decisions, prioritize thinking long-term\n\nA major acquisition, or a merger, between industry leaders is a bet on the industryâs future.\n\nIf you believe in the bet long-term, donât sacrifice a good move for short-term returns, as HP did with EMC. Instead, do your due diligence in the consideration phase:\n\nConsider real alternatives.\n\nUnderstand deeply how the capabilities of both companies will be improved.\n\nValidate your assumptions with current market needs and trends.\n\nMove faster than the competition.\n\nWhy is Dell so successful?\n\nOne of the key reasons Dell has been so successful is Michael Dellâs intuition and strategic instinct.\n\nHe demonstrated a consistent ability to take an accurate pulse of the market, make a winning bet and chase it relentlessly by performing a business transformation. Additionally, Dell never lost one of its core strategic strengths: building strong relationships with its customers by providing excellent customer support and tailored solutions to meet their unique needs. The company has also been successful in streamlining itsÂ operationsÂ and supply chain, which has allowed it to offer competitive prices and high-quality products.\n\nDell puts the customer first and makes strategic pivots with perfect timing.\n\nHow Dellâs vision guides its steps\n\nAccording to Dellâs annual report, its vision is:\n\nâTo become the most essential technology company for the data era. We seek to address our customersâ evolving needs and their broader digital\n\ntransformation objectives as they embrace todayâs hybrid multi-cloud environment.â\n\nAnd their two strategic priorities, growing core offerings and pursuing new opportunities, are their roadmap to achieving it.\n\nGrowth by numbers\n\n{{cta('e9abffcd-5522-40c9-be83-0e844633a49a')}}"
