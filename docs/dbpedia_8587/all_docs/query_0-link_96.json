        "text": "Dell’s new personable “More You” ad campaign has overall produced modest consumer perception changes so far, but it has really clicked with adults 18 – 34. The demographic group’s perception of Dell has overtaken rivals HP and Apple’s Mac with adults 18 - 34, according to YouGov BrandIndex data.\n\nThe ads aim to position Dell as a lifestyle brand by targeting Generation Y. Each is named after the specific young person they focus on, such as “Derek” or “Sarah”. Opening with a narrator intoning the advantages of the Dell computers, the ads present a swiveling Dell laptop, which rotates to reveal the young person on the screen of the computer, as if video-chatting. The young person begins to speak in praise of the laptop, with the narrator (a deep-voiced older man) saying their words. The ads then close with the laptop rotating again to focus in on the back of the computer, the iconic Dell logo rewritten as the name of the young person in the ad."
