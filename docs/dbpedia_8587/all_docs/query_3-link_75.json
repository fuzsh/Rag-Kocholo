        "text": "SEATTLE - Metia Group, a global B2B marketing agency, announced its client, Dell Technologies, has been shortlisted for the B2B Marketing award for recent “Precision for VFX” video storytelling and demand generation campaign work.\n\nThe recognition highlights the work of Metia's content and storytelling team to capture compelling narratives through the use of video. Metia’s specialist demand generation team then used advanced micro-profiling techniques and in-house tools to identify and promote the videos to a precisely targeted set of industry professionals.\n\nThe campaign delivered three times more completed video views than estimated—specifically 219,529 views versus Dell’s target of 71,400, resulting in a 307% over performance on campaign objectives. The success highlights the improved effectiveness and accuracy of Metia’s demand generation techniques and tools.\n\nMetia Group’s executive Pete Morgan, Director of Demand Generation, will join Ralf Pearson, Global Channel Campaign Lead, Client Solutions at Dell at the B2B Marketing Awards on 23 November 2017 in London. The winners will be announced during the event.\n\nCommenting on the project, Ralf Pearson said, “Workstation users are a tough audience to crack, and with only £10,000 to do it, we needed every penny to count. Metia's precise and methodical approach meant that we made the most of our budget and exceeded our targets many times over. Plus, we got the bonus of nearly 15,000 prospects arriving to our landing page. It’s a fantastic result for a very modest budget.”\n\n“It’s fantastic for Dell and Metia to receive this recognition,” added Pete Morgan. “For many years we have worked together to capture and tell the stories of Dell’s customers and the benefits Dell technology brings to them. Now we can also ensure those assets reach precisely targeted prospects, who want to learn from the experiences of people or businesses just like themselves.”"
