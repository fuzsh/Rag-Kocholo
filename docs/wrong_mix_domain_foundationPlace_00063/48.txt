It was 15 years ago in this very garage that a young Larry Page and Sergey Brin started building one of the the world's largest tech companies. Google's co-founders rented the space, along with three rooms inside the house, from Susan Wojcicki while they were still living in the dorms at Stanford, less than two miles away. The duo spent the winter of 1998 building the tech company that would change search and the Internet forever. Google now owns the house.
