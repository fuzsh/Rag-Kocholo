We collaborate and share ideas, create inclusive communities, and welcome diverse perspectives from all Red Hatters, no matter their role. It’s what makes us who we are.\n\nRemote—but not removed\n\nWe’re still hiring new Red Hatters. We’re just doing it virtually.\n\nDEPARTMENTS\n\nWhat we do\n\nSome of the most knowledgeable and passionate people in the technology industry work here. Whether we’re building software, championing our products, or training new associates, we’re collaborating openly to make a difference in the world of open source and beyond.\n\nWHY RED HAT\n\nWhat we offer\n\nTo ensure the success of every Red Hatter, we offer flexible scheduling, career growth and development opportunities, remote options, health and well-being initiatives, meaningful rewards, and associate recognition programs. These opportunities give Red Hatters the work-life balance necessary to make them happier—and more productive.\n\nDo rewarding work with an award-winning company\n\nCheck us out on Glassdoor\n\nCULTURE\n\nWho we are\n\nWe’re a leader in open source because of our open and inclusive environment.

We’ve been committed to working openly together for more than 25 years.\n\nLOCATIONS\n\nWhere we work\n\nWe’re in 100+ offices in 40+ countries across the globe.

It’s more about our shared commitment to being open, diverse, and inclusive that brings us together, no matter where we’re located.\n\nCOVID-19 Community Standards\n\nRed Hat continues to support vaccination against COVID-19 as one of the best steps we can take to contribute toward ending the pandemic and to keeping one another, our customers and partners, and our communities safe.\n\nRecruitment fraud alert\n\nBe wary of scammers posing as recruiters online, especially on social media.\n\nAffordable Care Act transparency in coverage\n\nThis link leads to the machine readable files that are made available in response to the federal Transparency in Coverage Rule and includes negotiated service rates and out-of-network allowed amounts between health plans and healthcare providers. The machine-readable files are formatted to allow researchers, regulators, and application developers to more easily access and analyze data.\n\nRed Hat Candidate Privacy Notice"
