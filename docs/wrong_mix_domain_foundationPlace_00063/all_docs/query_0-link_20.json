        "text": "In Brno, you can choose either a morning course, from 9:00am to 1:45pm, 4 x 60 minutes every day, or an afternoon course, from 3:00pm to 6:30pm, 3 x 60 minutes. We offer courses at 3 levels: intermediate, intermediate and upper-intermediate.\n\nThis course is designed to help students develop and improve their communicative skills. It also focuses on students' ability to express themselves in everyday situations and help you learn real language skills for real life situations. In addition, your listening skills will be developed to help you better follow and participate in conversations.\n\nThe courses are taught by highly qualified and experienced teachers.The day is divided into 3 sessions every day, in each session you will meet a different teacher. You will thus be exposed to 3 different accents and 3 different approaches to teaching.\n\nThe course takes place in air-conditioned, multimedia classrooms in a pleasant and inspiring university environment in the city centre, in the FF building at Veveří 28. Coffee, tea and chilled water will be available during breaks."
