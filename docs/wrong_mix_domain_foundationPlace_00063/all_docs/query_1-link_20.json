It can be reached by Uber from the Airport.\n\nWe are pleased to confirm that the 2022 Annual Meeting is to take place as an in-person event. The Leeds MH Group looks forward to welcoming you to Harrogate, a Victorian spa town in beautiful North Yorkshire, famous for its waters, Turkish baths, gardens and tea rooms. The hotel is located in its own gardens in the centre of the town and provides excellent meeting and dining facilities along with 4* accommodation. Registration & on-site accommodation is offered at a very reasonable rate with reductions for students.\n\nThe 39th EMHG annual meeting is organised by the Nijmegen NL MH unit.\n\nBecause of current travel bans due to Covid-19 it is decided to organize a virtual (only) meeting this year.\n\nThe date for the virtual Meeting is May 13-15th;\n\nThree half days: 8.00 AM – 12.00 PM;\n\nParallel Meetings, free presentations, plenary guest lectures, general EMHG Meeting & award ceremony;\n\nRegistration fee: 150€ (including 75€ EMHG-membership fee).\n\nECMH Nijmegen will send you an invitation and the link to attend the Zoom meetings and Slido codes one week in advance.\n\nWe hope to welcome you all at the EMHG digital experience 2021\n\nOn behalf of the organizing committee, Marc Snoeck, MH@cwz.nl\n\nOn behalf of the board of directors of the European Malignant Hyperthermia Group (EMHG) and the members of the local organizing committee, we are very pleased to welcome you to the 37th annual meeting of the European Malignant Hyperthermia Group which will take place in Ferrara, Italy on May 17th - 19th 2018.\n\nThe congress will be held in the center of the small town of Ferrara.\n\nWe will certainly try to continue the trend of successful past annual meetings and hope to further contribute to the spirit of friendship and collaboration as known since the first meetings of our group. Indeed the EMHG always stood for close collaboration, an increasingly important asset in facilitating an integrated approach to research in this domain.\n\nWe look forward to welcoming you and spending a great time in Ferrara.\n\nSusan Treves Francesco Zorzato Vincenzo Tegazzin\n\nFor questions please contact susan.treves@unibas.ch"
