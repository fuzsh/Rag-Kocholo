        "text": "Last year, building on 5 years of support for AI-powered initiatives, we launched a $25M open call for organizations using AI to accelerate progress on the Sustainable Development Goals. See what our recipients are up to — and learn how you can do your part.\n\nSince we began funding AI projects for social impact in 2018, we have supported efforts ranging from low-cost air quality sensors mounted on motorcycle taxis in Uganda to AI-powered apps that help farmers mitigate pests and increase their crop yields in India. We’ve also funded ambitious global projects like AI-powered satellite monitoring to track greenhouse gas emissions across the world.\n\nWith the help of AI, our recipients report that they are meeting their goals in a third of the time, at half of the cost.\n\nEmboldened by this momentum, we committed an additional $25M for projects specifically aimed at using AI to accelerate progress on one or more of the UN’s Global Goals. Meet the newest cohort of Google.org recipients."
