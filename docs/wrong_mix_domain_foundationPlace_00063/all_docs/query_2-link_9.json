For us, that means supporting communities around the world, and being a good neighbor in the place where Google started - the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nWe work closely with Bay Area nonprofits, supporting those on the frontlines addressing the area’s most pressing needs. Since 2014, we’ve consistently been recognized as the Bay Area’s top technology company donor, giving over $420M in grants to Bay Area nonprofits alone.\n\nFrom our recent commitment of $1B to fund more affordable housing in the Bay Area, to $18M in grants given to nonprofits focused on the issues of homelessness and displacement, to providing local nonprofits with free access to event space and coworking areas -- we’re committed to supporting big ideas for an even better Bay Area.\n\nSolving the biggest challenges in the Bay Area will take collaboration across many organizations, and we look forward to working alongside others to make the Bay Area a place where everyone can thrive."
