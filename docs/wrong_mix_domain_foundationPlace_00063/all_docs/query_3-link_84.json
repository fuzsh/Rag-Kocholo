        "text": "About Google.org\n\nGoogle.org brings the best of Google to help solve some of humanity’s biggest challenges — combining funding, innovation, and technical expertise to support underserved communities and provide opportunity for everyone.\n\nAbout our work with Google.org\n\nYBI is currently supported by a $2 million grant from Google.org to lead a COVID-19 recovery programme in Korea. The programme aims to provide access to entrepreneurial resources and content, training and support to 20,000 underserved social enterprises and small, medium enterprises (SMEs) in Korea. YBI is working with two local delivery partners to deliver the programme: WT Foundation and Impact Square Inc. Read more about the initative here.\n\nThis programme follows the success of YBI’s COVID-19 Rapid Response and Recovery Programme, supported by a $5 million grant from Google.org in 2020-21. The funding enabled YBI to deliver a Rapid Response and Recovery Programme backing underserved micro, small and medium-sized businesses, sustaining livelihoods and supporting thousands of communities across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific. The programme was implemented in 32 countries and focussed on the most affected business owners, including young people, women, and refugees and other migrants.\n\nA holistic package of emergency support was provided to business owners through YBI’s global network of members and delivery partners, including crisis helplines, targeted advice and signposting, online training through webinars, and mentoring. As part of the programme, Google employees volunteered their time to share their knowledge and expertise, helping business owners to upskill and adapt to the challenges they faced."
