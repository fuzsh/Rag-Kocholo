        "text": "Overview\n\nIn collaboration with the Centre for Public Impact, Google.org will support workers across Europe who are most impacted by workforce transitions brought on by AI. A wide range of nonprofit and civil society organizations reaching those workers will be selected through a €15 million open call. Successful applicants will receive extensive and bespoke training in local languages based on foundational AI courses designed by Google and external partners and cash support.\n\nRecent advances in AI, particularly Generative AI, have the potential to increase the size of the EU economy by 1.2 trillion Euros, and to save the average worker over 70 hours a year. Yet while AI presents immense opportunities for increased productivity and growth, we must work together to ensure that they are truly available to everyone and don’t leave anyone behind.\n\nThe AI Opportunity Fund is an AI skilling initiative designed to equip workers, especially those who need more support to upskill themselves, with the foundational AI knowledge and tools needed for long-term positive professional outcomes. Organizations who reach those workers are invited to apply for support from this €15 million fund, with successful applicants receiving funding and comprehensive training in local languages based on Google and external AI courses. There will be an option for additional tailored support to facilitate the training, which may include ongoing mentorship, child care vouchers, and stipends."
