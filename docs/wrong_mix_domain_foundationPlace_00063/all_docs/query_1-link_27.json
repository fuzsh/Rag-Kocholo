        "text": "Present events\n\nWe cordially invite you to the lecture of Klara Janjic, who will present her research focusing on cell dynamics on specific models of the oral mucosa.\n\nJoin us for a lecture by Prof. Nicholas Stephanopoulos, a renowned scientist specializing in nanotechnology and biomedicine. He earned his A.B. in chemistry from Harvard University and a Master’s in chemical engineering from MIT. He completed his PhD at UC Berkeley, focusing on bioconjugation chemistry. At Northwestern University, he researched peptide nanomaterials for regenerative medicine. Now an Associate Professor at Arizona State University, Prof. Stephanopoulos integrates proteins and peptides with DNA nanotechnology to develop innovative hybrid nanomaterials. His work has earned him the Air Force Young Investigator Award, the NSF CAREER Award, and the NIH New Innovator Award. Join us to learn from his groundbreaking research!\n\nHappy to share that our institute is going to host the 2nd ScanR high-content imaging workshop!\n\nMore information: https://scanrbrno.ibp.cz/\n\nOur colleague Dr. Hana Polasek-Sedlackova receives a prestigious EMBO Installation Grant\n\nUp to two-thirds of all cancers arise due to errors that occur during DNA replication. Dr. Hana Polasek-Sedlackova and her team have dedicated their research efforts to studying this phenomenon. Recently, they were awarded the prestigious EMBO Installation grant, which will enable them to explore the molecular mechanisms that guarantee accurate DNA replication.\n\nEMBO grant recipients will receive annual financial support of €50,000 and a generous benefits package for the entire research group, including networking, mentoring, and training activities offered by EMBO.\n\nCongratulations to Dr. Polasek-Sedlackova and her team!\n\nPress release in English can be found here.\n\nA new breakthrough in rheumatoid arthritis research!\n\nIt is significantly signed by the DEPARTMENT OF IMMUNE SYSTEM BIOPHYSICS OF THE BIOPHYSICAL INSTITUTE OF THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE CZECH REPUBLIC!!!\n\nDaniela Rubanová (one on the right) - co-author of the published article\n\nRheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease which mainly affects joints. Symptoms include pain and decrease in range of motion of the joint leading to decreased quality of life of patients. Although current therapy is quite efficient in managing the symptoms and slowing down the progress of disease its long-term usage is often connected with several side effects. Conjugation of the drugs to nanosized carrier is an interesting strategy to overcome these drawbacks. We used nanocarriers based on biocompatible polymer N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide which enables prolonged circulation in the blood, targeting and enhanced accumulation into the inflamed joint.\n\nThe widely used glucocorticoid dexamethasone was conjugated to this nanocarrier and its effects were studied using mouse model of arthritis. We used non-invasive imaging system to study the accumulation of fluorescently labeled nanopolymer conjugate in the arthritic joint. The significantly higher accumulation in inflamed joint in comparison with healthy one was observed. Next, the therapeutic efficacy of nanopolymer conjugate was studied. We observed significantly higher therapeutic effect of nanopolymer conjugate in comparison with the same dose of free dexamethasone. Results of this study suggest that conjugation of dexamethasone to nanopolymer carrier would be a promising strategy in improvement of rheumatoid arthritis therapy.\n\nThe study was conducted in tight collaboration with a working group led by Dr. Etrych from the Department of Macromolecular Chemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the International Clinical Research Center within the Faculty Hospital St. Anne in Brno, and the Institute of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University. This work was supported by the Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic (project NU20-08-00255) and the Czech Science Foundation (grant 19-00956Y). Daniela Rubanova is a Brno Ph.D. Talent Scholarship Holder – Funded by the Brno City Municipality\n\nTHE FULL PUBLISHED ARTICLE CAN BE FOUND IN THE LINK HERE\n\nSignificant research activity\n\nInstitute of Biophysics, Czech Academy of Sciences (IBP), was founded in 1955 and became a part of the research infrastructures in Czechoslovakia and later in the Czech Republic. Currently, IBP scientists conduct basic research in various disciplines of biophysics, biology, and chemistry. Biophysical research is carried out through many methods, such as confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, and sorting based on fluorescent methods, CD spectroscopy, computer modeling, and electrochemistry. IBP is a research center in the Czech Republic performing epigenetic studies representing one of the significant trends in world science. In practical terms, attention is also paid to training in radiation protection, which is taught at Masaryk University in Brno. Activities of IBP scientists contribute to increasing the high level of knowledge and education in the Czech Republic as well as to the development of biotechnology and implementation of research results in practice. Within the scope of our activities, research teams develop international cooperation, including the organization of international scientific meetings, seminars, and training of international students in our laboratories equipped with modern technology. In collaboration with universities, scientists are involved in the educational activities of students and contribute to teaching at several universities in the Czech Republic. Education is mostly carried out at Masaryk University in Brno and Palacky University in Olomouc.\n\nWe aim to consolidate our position as a national center for excellent research, while at the same time, we are working on strengthening our position internationally. Every year more than 50 scientists of IBP participate at national grant projects and educate more than 70 pre-graduate and post-graduate students. Many scientists are (were) the principal investigators in international projects, such as projects guaranteed by Norwegian funds, EU grants Marie Curie, COST projects, projects supported by Howard Hughes Medical Institute, or Welcome Trust. The management of IBP promotes scientific research, also using the internal institutional support. In the Institute, we want to create suitable conditions for ground-breaking discoveries in biological and chemical sciences. For the best scientists, academic freedom, as well as financial and technical support, are guaranteed. The professional work is reflected by the relatively high intensity of citations of scientific contributions, initially investigated at the Institute. Highly reputable scientists work(ed) at the institute: the laureate of the most prestigious national award „Česká hlava“ (the Czech Head Award), and „Neuron,“ prof. Emil Paleček (the number of citations according to WoS is more than 14 000). Also, prof. Victor Brabec (the number of citations is more than 11 000), and laureate of the Academiae Premium, prof. Jiří Šponer (the number of citations is more than 18 000). Prof. Šponer is one of the most-cited scientists of the Czech Republic. Institute management also supports the activities of young scientists, and support women (parents) in science. In the younger generation (up to 35 years), a number of our postdoctoral scientists obtained prestigious Otto Wichterle award (the award of the Czech Academy of Sciences). Following scientists were awarded: Jiří Fajkus, Olga Nováková, Jiří Šponer, Miroslav Fojta, Jana Kašpárková, Stanislav Hasoň, Luděk Havran, Václav Brázda, Judit Šponerová, Lukáš Kubala, Jaroslav Malina, Roman Hobza, Martin Falk, Kamila Réblová, Veronika Ostatná, Hana Pivoňková, Michaela Pekarová, Zdeněk Kubát, Soňa Legartová a Vojtěch Novohradský, Miroslav Krepl, and Lenka Marková. We believe that internationally-recognized scientists of the Institute, as well as the promising young generation of scientists, guarantee a long-lasting and the high-level of science at the Institute of Biophysics."
