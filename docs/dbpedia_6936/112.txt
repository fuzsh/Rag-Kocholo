Amy Marxkors has been promoted to morning show co-host on News Radio KMOX-AM in St. Louis. Marxkors will host “Total Information AM Overdrive” alongside Charlie Brennan Mondays through Thursdays from 8:30 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. CT and “The Charlie Brennan Show” from 9-11.

Market Manager Becky Domyan said Amy is a rising star in radio. “She has shown tremendous growth on air while covering everything from the Blues Stanley Cup run to discussing local and national issues during our longform talk shows. She has a very bright future and I’m looking forward to the impact she can make on KMOX.”

“I’m from St. Louis and I grew up listening to KMOX, whether it was in the car early in the morning or on summer evenings listening to Cardinals games. I’ve always loved radio,” said Marxkors. “To be joining ‘The Charlie Brennan Show’ is a bit surreal. Charlie’s name and his voice are woven into the very fabric of this city and I’m beyond thrilled to have this opportunity to be a part of his show. It’s an incredible honor.”

In addition to her role on the morning show, Marxkors will continue to cover the Stanley Cup Champion St. Louis Blues and the National Hockey League by hosting a weekly hockey podcast. Prior to joining Entercom, Marxkors served as co-host of the Blues weekly hockey show “Chili’s Week in Hockey” in 2016, which aired on News Radio 1120 KMOX. She joined the Blues radio broadcast in 2017 and became the first woman to host the pre- and postgame of a radio broadcast for any St. Louis professional sports team in February 2019. The St. Louis native joined the station in 2018 as a sports reporter and host.
