        "text": "Yesterday, today and tomorrow\n\nThe Aldersgate Foundation, a Methodist-affiliated organization whose mission was to build retirement housing in a similar way as church groups traditionally built churches, parsonages and schools using tithes, donations and endowments, founded Aldersgate Village in 1972.\n\nEarly amenities were minimal. There were no paved roads or streetlights; residents did their own lawn and garden maintenance and most of their own cooking â€“ one meal a day was served at noon. But the spirit of the community was remarkably similar to today. Fast friendships were formed, and celebrations were frequent.\n\nSince those early days, John Knox Village has expanded and improved, but the foundational culture of friendship and neighborliness continues to thrive."
