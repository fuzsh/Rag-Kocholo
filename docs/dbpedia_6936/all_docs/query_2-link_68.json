        "text": "The St. Louis Blues, the N.H.L.’s worst team as late as the morning of Jan. 3, are four wins from hoisting their first Stanley Cup. They advanced to the final round for the first time in 49 years on Tuesday night, ousting the San Jose Sharks from the Western Conference finals with a 5-1 victory in St. Louis.\n\nIt’s worth mentioning once more: after playing 45 percent of their schedule (37 of 82 games), the Blues had the worst record in the entire 31-team league — not just among teams in the Central Time Zone or the Midwest, or that have the word “Blue” in their name . A remarkable reversal, spearheaded by a 25-year-old rookie goaltender and by a defensive revival overseen by an interim head coach, powered St. Louis toward the playoffs and through them.\n\nThe reward is a matchup with the Boston Bruins, who swept St. Louis in the final in 1970 — the last time the Blues played for the Cup. Before the teams play Game 1 Monday night in Boston, it’s instructive to see just how the Blues went from worst in the N.H.L. to best in the West.\n\nNov. 19, 2018\n\nAfter losing, 2-0, at home to the Los Angeles Kings — the only team at the time that had fewer points than St. Louis — the Blues fired their head coach, Mike Yeo. The loss dropped St. Louis to 7-9-3. To replace Yeo, the Blues elevated one of his assistants, Craig Berube, a longtime N.H.L. enforcer, to be the interim coach. Berube’s pugilistic sensibilities belied an acumen for the game that had earned him head coaching jobs with the Philadelphia Flyers and the Blues’ top farm team, the Chicago Wolves, who finished with the American Hockey League’s best record in 2016-17 under his guidance.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
