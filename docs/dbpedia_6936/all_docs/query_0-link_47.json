        "text": "ST. LOUIS — About 7 p.m. Central on Wednesday, a voice will declare on a radio wave transmitted at 1120 kilohertz, “This is KMOX, the voice of St. Louis,” and millions of homes from Denver to Alabama and Louisiana to North Dakota will be able to hear Game 6 of the World Series come to life on an AM radio.\n\nThe penetrating strength of KMOX, a powerful radio station in St. Louis with a tradition of Hall of Fame broadcasters, has helped turn countless families into Cardinals fans since 1926, when it broadcast its first game.\n\nWith a 50,000-watt signal originating from a transmitter across the Mississippi River, in Illinois, KMOX is said to be heard in 44 states and as far away as the Netherlands, East Africa and Guam, spreading the gospel of St. Louis Cardinals baseball across the planet.\n\nThe signal stretches to truly remote locales only in rare, static-filled instances. But in a swath of North America, from New Orleans to Canada, the signal could be so reliable at night that an entire region became enamored of the team.\n\nWhen Jack Buck died in 2002, President Bill Clinton sent a letter to Buck’s son Joe, a former KMOX broadcaster and currently Fox’s play-by-play announcer, explaining how he had listened to Jack Buck and Harry Caray doing Cardinals games on a transistor radio hidden beneath his pillow in Hope, Ark., more than 450 miles away.\n\n“The power of that station meant so much to countless people across this country,” Joe Buck said. “People riding on tractors or sitting on the porch, it was part of the soundtrack to their summer.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
