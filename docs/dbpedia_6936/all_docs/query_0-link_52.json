        "text": "The St. Louis Cardinals have placed outfielder Michael Siani on the Injured List and recalled Victor Scott II in a corresponding move. Siani injured his oblique in Saturday’s 5-4 win over the Chicago Cubs. Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol told KMOX radio on Sunday that Siani could miss several weeks.\n\nCardinals Call Up No. 3 Prospect As Outfielder Hits IL\n\nSiani Injures Oblique\n\nSiani injured his oblique on a foul ball in the fifth inning of Saturday’s win. He stayed in the game until the eighth inning before being removed at that point.\n\nThroughout the season, Siani has been the Cardinals best defender. Siani is tied for second with four other players in Outs Above Average at 13, according to Baseball Savant. He is just one behind league leader Patrick Bailey for the San Francisco Giants. Siani is slashing .256/.297/.325 with 18 RBI and 14 stolen bases.\n\nMarmol told KMOX radio that Siani will likely miss significant time on Sunday.\n\n“It looks like it’s something that is going to sideline him for a little bit,” Marmol said. “It’s definitely an oblique and we know how those go.”\n\nThe Cardinals have now had three players hit the IL with oblique injuries this season. Outfielder Lars Nootbaar and infielder Matt Carpenter both spent about six weeks on the IL this season with oblique injuries.\n\nScott II Gets Second Chance\n\nScott II won the starting job out of Spring Training despite injuries to Nootbaar, Tommy Edman, and Dylan Carlson—the second two were traded at last week’s Trade Deadline. In the first month of the season, Scott II slashed .085/.139/.136, leading him to be sent down to Triple-A on April 21.\n\nWhile with the Cardinal’s Triple A affiliate Memphis Redbirds, Scott II slashed .219/.302/.319 with 29 RBI and six home runs. Scott II has top level speed; he stole 29 bases in Triple A this year.\n\nScott II is the Cardinal’s No. 3 prospect and is the top fielder prospect in the organization.\n\nThe Way The Outfield Shakes Out Now\n\nSiani had been playing most days in center field. Marmol told KMOX radio that Lars Nootbaar will get the most time in center field moving forward. Siani’s injury will open up time for Tommy Pham, who the Cardinals acquired at the Trade Deadline.\n\nAlec Burleson and Brendan Donovan both will likely remain as regular starters. Scott II is a left-handed bat, as are Nootbaar, Burleson and Donovan. Pham is the lone right-handed bat in the outfield. While the outfield is crowded, the Cardinals are likely to give Scott II some time to see how he performs. However, he will need to perform to stay in the lineup for a playoff-contending team."
