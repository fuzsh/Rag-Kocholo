        "text": "BOSTON — If you tune into KMOX radio during the Stanley Cup final, hear the voice of John Kelly and wonder what’s wrong with regular play-by-play voice Chris Kerber, the answer is nothing.\n\nIn fact, as Blues legend Bobby Plager and many others will tell you, everything is right.\n\n“I think what Chris Kerber has done,” Plager said, “it goes up there with one of the greatest things that has been done with the St. Louis Blues.”\n\nThanks to a plan that had been in place well before this Blues’ postseason, the 48-year-old Kerber, who’s in his 19th season, is turning the microphone over to Kelly for the entire second period of every game in the best-of-seven series.\n\nThe greatest goodwill gesture one could give, some in the industry are saying, has assured that a TV broadcaster who doesn’t have the option to work after the first round because the networks take over, will be on the air in the playoffs. It also continues the Kelly tradition that began with John’s father, Dan, who held the job in the radio booth from 1968, calling the 1970 Stanley Cup series against Boston, until he died from lung cancer in the late 1980s.\n\n“This isn’t something that just hit this year,” Kerber told The Athletic. “This has been a long time in the back of my head, if this ever happens … like if we had made the finals in 2016, same thing, it was going to happen. We just haven’t gone on a long enough playoff run to get to this point. Look, (local TV broadcasters) don’t get to do these games. They sacrifice their time, miss family stuff, and the icing on the cake is the playoffs, and all of a sudden after the first round, these guys don’t get to do it.\n\n“John has two Stanley Cups (broadcasting) with the Colorado Avalanche, but has never got to call a Stanley Cup final. I said, ‘Well this just makes all the sense in the world.’ So take the mic for the second period of every game — not just one but every game, be a part of the whole series, be vested in it, and do it.”\n\nFor those who remember listening to the elder Kelly and watching John follow in his footsteps, the father-son lineage would seem to make Kerber’s idea an obvious one. But the decision runs much deeper for the St. Louis native, who recalls a personal story involving Dan Kelly when Kerber was calling games for an American Hockey League affiliate.\n\n“It was my first pro gig, and during the 1994 lockout, KMOX did a 45-minute show, a history of the St. Louis Blues and my dad (Lou) recorded it on a cassette tape and sent it to me,” Kerber said. “In the minors, you’re doing a whole bunch of things for the team — like one day I was in charge of ‘church night.’ I had 1,000 people coming from church groups and so five minutes before the game, I’m still in the lobby passing out tickets, and then you go right up to the booth and put the headset on.\n\n“So sometimes if I fell flat, I’d listen to this tape. I would listen over and over and over again, and I would study Dan Kelly, Ken Wilson and Jack Buck. Dan Kelly could move the puck from one side of the ice to the other in about seven words, and I just studied how they did and tried to work that stuff in. So here it is, I get the Blues’ job, I come home and get to work with Ken Wilson and then he leaves and John Kelly comes in. The bond between the Blues and their fans, it’s deep, it’s special, and I knew what it would mean to John.”\n\nThough the plan had been in place to bring Kelly into the fold for years, it came as a surprise when Kerber approached him after the Blues defeated San Jose 5-1 in Game 6 of the Western Conference finals on May 21.\n\n“I pulled him aside and said, ‘I’d be thrilled to have you work the series with me,'” Kerber said. “When I first mentioned it, he said, ‘No.’ I said, ‘You don’t have a choice, you’re doing this for the finals with me.'”\n\n“I was shocked,” Kelly recalled. “I said that I didn’t want to do it because it’s not my place. It’s his booth and his job, but he insisted. He wasn’t letting it be an option.”\n\nUpon the agreement with Kerber and the appreciation from Kelly, the two shared the news with John’s wife Jennifer, son Patrick and daughter Grace in a room at Enterprise Center, where the family was celebrating the Western Conference championship by posing for pictures with the Clarence Campbell trophy.\n\n“I was really just shocked,” Jennifer Kelly said. “I think to have the Blues go through the first round and get this far, John has naturally been frustrated that he can’t do the games and it’s just hard. The Blues, they’re his life, and so when Chris told us, it was just so … I mean John was speechless. He was just so excited.”\n\nKerber told the family about the story of his dad sending him the tape — “I’ve still got it, by the way,” he said — and admitted that holding in his own emotion was more difficult than he anticipated.\n\n“I saw the look on their face and I wasn’t prepared for that, I really wasn’t,” Kerber said. “They had an understanding of the appreciation for what their grandpa, or in Jennifer’s case, father-in-law, meant, and it was cool.”\n\nKelly’s immediate family was aware of the news, but he hadn’t yet told his 82-year-old mother, Fran, when her name showed up on his cell phone.\n\n“I actually called him by mistake,” Fran Kelly said. “I meant to call his house and talk to his wife, but John answered the phone and he told me what was going on. I was just stunned. John is just so pleased that he can have a small part in the final games. I thought Chris Kerber was very generous in letting John do the second period in these playoff games. I couldn’t believe it when he did that. I thought it was great.”\n\nThe Blues arrived in Boston on Saturday and Kelly would have been coming anyway, handling pre- and post-game duties along with Bernie Federko for FOX Sports Midwest. But on Monday, John stepped into the KMOX booth for the start of the second period, and with the Blues leading the Boston Bruins 1-0, he took the headset from Kerber and sat next to radio analyst Joe Vitale.\n\n“I’ll tell you what, it was a moment that I will never, ever forget,” said Vitale, a native of St. Louis who is in his first season in the booth. “I have to be careful because I’m calling games with Chris Kerber, which is just crazy and awesome because he’s been doing this for a long time, and he’s got one of the best voices in the game. So I preface it with that, but to have John Kelly in there is pretty incredible. He put the headset on and he just hit the ground running with ‘and they drop the puck!’\n\n“With John, he looked to me to jump in a little more often, so to read off his body language was a little different than ‘Kerbs,’ but it was exciting. I remember listening back to Dan Kelly calls and I told John this, I really felt at times in his call that it was his dad. They sound so similar. I think his dad has a bit of a deeper voice, but John the way he is abrupt and says the players’ names with a little bravado in his voice, it really was special for all Blues’ fans, and to be sitting next to him was pretty remarkable.”\n\nThe Bruins scored two goals in the middle period, tying the Blues’ 2-2, and as Kelly stepped out of the booth, we asked him how it went.\n\n“It was awesome,” he said. “I haven’t done radio in a while, but you know, you get into the flow. But to do a final game was really exciting. It felt a lot different because we all know the magnitude of every game, and really more than that, every play, every kill, every power play — every play is so magnified, and the Blues quite honestly were lucky to be tied after two periods. To me, it’s harder when there’s not a lot of action. There was a lot of action, but unfortunately, it was at the Blues’ end of the ice. But we did our best and it was a big thrill.”\n\nBack in St. Louis, Fran was watching and listening to the Blues-Bruins game with Jennifer Kelly at their home.\n\n“I can’t say that I could sit and watch it the whole time,” Fran said. “I had to get up and leave a few times. It’s hard to watch for me. But I enjoyed listening to him. He’s my son, right?”\n\n“She was just full of emotion,” Jennifer Kelly said. “She didn’t really say much, but you could see the smile on her face. The Blues are so near and dear to their heart, and she wants John to be a part of this naturally.”\n\nKelly walked into the press box at Boston’s TD Garden for the start of the third period and was greeted by Frank Cusumano, a sports anchor at NBC affiliate KSDK in St. Louis, who grew up listening to his father, Dan. Cusumano told Kelly that he had the broadcast on his headphones and he did a great job.\n\n“I’m old enough to remember his father and there’s just something in the tone of their voice, the way they follow the action, it was really nostalgic,” Cusumano said. “I can’t say that I listened to all those games religiously in 1968, ’69 and ’70, but I felt I was listening to Dan for a split-second.”\n\nThe story of Kerber’s generosity has been making the rounds in the past week, particularly in broadcast circles, where colleagues locally and around the league have taken note.\n\n“Not surprised whatsoever,” said Darren Pang, the Blues’ TV analyst on FOX Sports Midwest. “I just think that that’s the makeup of Chris Kerber, knowing the importance of broadcasting in St. Louis. It epitomizes, I think, what everything has been about with the St. Louis Blues. They’re a team first, and sure enough, here’s Chris Kerber stepping aside and allowing ‘JK’ to do it.”\n\nJudd Sirott, the radio play-by-play man for the Boston Bruins, agreed.\n\n“Awesome, absolutely awesome,” he said. “To have an opportunity for a voice like John to be able to call a moment that has never been seen in Blues history — think about how legendary that could be — Chris Kerber gets it. I think the biggest compliment you can pay someone is that he or she ‘gets it,’ and Chris gets it. He is a fabulous pro, and it’s just a tremendous gesture.”\n\nKerber has been blown away by the reaction.\n\n“It’s just the right thing,” he said. “You just know when something feels right. I certainly didn’t do it to get accolades of being a good guy. It’s the respect of the booth. It’s respect everybody that came before you, and the price they paid to give you the chance. But it’s also respecting the people you’re working with now and what they’re going through. There are opportunities that present themselves, in every walk of life, not just this scenario, that allow you to make a moment better for somebody. You have to understand those moments.\n\n“I’m still going to be doing the first period, I’m still going to be doing the third. I mean this: I’m excited as all hell to share this series with him, and if/when the Blues win this whole thing, that’s going to be part of the memory for me, having shared the booth with John and Joe, and whoever else wants to come in and be a part of it. I never looked at it like giving up a period or something like that, no. It’s just taking care of those that took care of you, I guess.”\n\nTold of Plager’s praise, Kerber said, “I don’t even have a response for that. I truly don’t. I don’t even know what to say to that other than pretty cool.”\n\nPlager wasn’t the only legend who felt that way.\n\n“That’s great, such a wonderful gesture,” former Blues coach Scotty Bowman said. “That happens to a lot of the announcers with teams, whenever they get into subsequent rounds, it’s a tough thing on them. That’s great for John because it gives him so much nostalgia.”\n\nKelly thinks of his father often, especially now with the Blues back in the Stanley Cup final.\n\n“He’s always on my mind, and with the Blues playing the Bruins, I’ve been asked so many times by so many people about his goal call and what it’s like to be able to work in the final like he did,” he said. “So yeah, he’s always on my mind. And my mother, she knows what the Blues mean to me and what it means to the Kelly family. To have another Kelly call a Stanley Cup final is special … it really is.”\n\nDan Kelly, however, never got the chance to be behind the microphone when the Blues won a Cup. Now his son might have that opportunity.\n\n“You know he was a true Blues fan,” Fran Kelly said of her late husband. “He lived and died with the Blues. He did call some games in Canada for the broadcast up there, he did some national stuff, but he lived and died with the Blues. I remember one time, when he got sick, I think John was working up in New York. He just heard John and he just thought he was doing really well. He was so proud that he was starting to be a broadcaster. So for sure, he would be really proud.”\n\n(Top photo of John Kelly: Courtesy of Tim Pabst)"
