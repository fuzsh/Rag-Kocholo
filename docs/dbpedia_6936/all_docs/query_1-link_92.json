        "text": "\"Kevin and I have done a number of interviews over the years. He is always prepared with tough questions, and I know I need to be on my toes. If you try to BS around an answer he will eat your lunch.\"\n\nPresident of St. Louis Cardinals Baseball Club\n\n\"When I first heard Kevin \"The King\" Slaten I could not stop listening! He is passionate, knowledgeable, creative and will never back down from asking the question that needs to be asked or discussing the topics that need to be discussed.\n\nMore than anything, he may not even remember, but the first live radio show I did in St. Louis was with Kevin. I was a young college kid with aspirations and he treated me with respect and kindness.\"\n\nFox 2 News, Main Anchor\n\n\"I have been a loyal follower of \"The King,\" Kevin Slaten, for well over 20 years, including television and radio. Over the last few years, I have gotten to be personal friends with him. Kevin has ALWAYS been one who tells the TRUTH and can back up his comments and beliefs with FACTS. My wife and I can also attest to the fact that his sponsors are great. Because of Kevin's recommendation, we replaced all of our windows in our house with Window World windows. Our utility bills have definitely lowered significantly.\n\nI must also say, and my wife Nancy will confirm, I cannot go a DAY without listening to Kevin's show in the morning. It's the ONLY place we get our news. He's honest and reliable. FACTS, baby, FACTS!\"\n\nMajor Richard Wagner\n\n“Kevin Slaten, one of the top thought leaders in radio today.

A guy you can always count on when you need help. We have been lucky to have him in St Louis for all these years. I would never call him politically correct and I am glad for that. I wish there were more Kevin Slaten’s out there.\n\nHe seldom backs down but he has always listened to what I have had to say. I hold the “King” in high regard. This is why we love him.

Kevin is a wonderful Father, raising his Son Troy by himself, and did so willingly and lovingly.

Don't know who the other 3 would be but definitely Kevin would be one. Started listening to Kevin when I moved to Saint Louis in 1998 and have never stopped. Now I love listening to him when it comes to politics. He’s every bit as knowledgeable about politics as he is about sports. A true legend.”\n\nOwner of Chuck's Boots\n\n\"Kevin Slaten, and The King's Court, was the first inspiration for me to do talk radio.

Still a listener to this day.\"\n\nHost of War Room"
