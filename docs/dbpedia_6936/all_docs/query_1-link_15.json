        "text": "The annual music festival held by Gateway Arch Park Foundation returns Aug. 9 & 10\n\nThe city of blues will once again play host to the Blues at the Arch Festival this weekend. The free event is hosted by the Gateway Arch Park Foundation and takes place on Friday, Aug. 9, and Sat., Aug. 10, concluding with a ticketed blues brunch on Sun., Aug. 11.\n\nBlues isn’t the only music you can look forward to at this annual event, however, as the event showcases the influence blues music has had on many other genres, including country, gospel and good ole rock ‘n’ roll. The stacked lineup includes Amber Bullock, Jeremiah Johnson, the Soulard Blues Band, Marquise Knox and many more.\n\n“Nestled at the confluence of two major rivers, St. Louis has been a melting pot of musical innovation, particularly during the Great Migration when millions of Black Americans moved north, bringing with them the soulful sounds and the heartbeat of blues music,” according to a release.\n\nAnd, of course, it’s about more than just music, though that is the main draw. The event is also a celebration of our culture and community, plus plenty of local food vendors will be on-site, including The Moobile, Jive Turkey, Little Busy B’s Food Trailer, Show Me Kettle Korn, Delicious Delights. For beverages, Pour Decisions STL and Narwhal’s Crafted will be serving up delicious, icy-cold cocktails.\n\n“Last year, more than 12,000 people came together at Blues at the Arch Festival to honor St. Louis’ storied blues history,” Ryan McClure, executive director of Gateway Arch Park Foundation, said in a release. “Not only does the Foundation work to bring people together in downtown St. Louis to ensure a vibrant future for our great city, but we also honor the past by playing a part in preserving the park’s most important pieces of history and culture, including the legacy of blues music. We’re looking forward to celebrating with thousands of music fans again this year.”\n\nThe family-friendly event includes a children’s area with yard games, sports activities and a “musical petting zoo” with real instruments the kids can play with. Well-behaved dogs on leashes are also welcome.\n\nIn addition, the The National Blues Museum’s “Queen of the Blues” exhibit will be on display at the festival, with inspirational illustrations that pays homage to the first women to influence blues music."
