        "text": "Sometimes in your career you want a new challenge. Sometimes you sense that it’s time for you to hand things over to a new generation. Sometimes you just want to spend more time with your kids.\n\nAll of that is true for Kelly Chase. The beloved broadcaster announced today that he will be leaving KMOX. The station will announce a replacement in the coming month.\n\n“It’s tough for me to say I don’t want to broadcast games anymore, but this decision is mine and it’s time for a change,” Chase told stlouisblues.com. “(Former Blue) Garth Butcher was a guy I respected a great deal. He said to me at the end of his career that he knew he could play longer, but that it was someone else’s turn.… I think that’s where I’m at. It’s someone else’s turn.”\n\nSo, what will Chaser be doing now? As the statement released on the Blues’ official site states:\n\nWhile Kerber searches for a new partner, Chase is busy preparing for his new duties with the Blues. Working with Chapman and his team, Chase will bring new business to the club through his work and connections.\n\n”I’ll be able to sit down and watch a game or sit with a sponsor or client or someone that’s been part of our community and talk with them on a different level,” Chase said. “It’s going to be a huge change for me. I’ve never sat down and watched the game with the fans. I’m going to get their perspective on things and help make it a better experience for them. And I’ve never sat down and watched a game with my sons, who are ages 19, 17 and 15. I’m finally going to get to do that now.\n\nBlues fans will miss more than just insightful color commentary by someone who has a deep knowledge of the game. They’ll also miss an honest voice in the broadcast booth, one just as quick to hold the Blues to account as he was to hold the refs to account. The team and fans need that voice of accountability."
