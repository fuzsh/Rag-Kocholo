        "text": "Knox County Regional Airport\n\nThe City of Rockland turned the airport over to Knox County on December 4, 1968. The airport was renamed the Knox County Regional Airport. Since then, the airport has been developed, runways were expanded, the instrument landing system known as the ILS (allows aircraft to land in inclement weather) was installed and a new environmentally friendly terminal was constructed. The airport properties have been upgraded and maintained, primarily, with grant money from a federal aviation fund created from user fees and aviation fuel taxes. The State of Maine contributes funds to capital improvement projects from transportation bonds and state taxes on aviation fuel. Although Knox County taxpayers have traditionally subsidized the airport operations, most of the local share of the capital improvements (prior to 2010) had been sourced from a single donor. Since 2020 user fees have fully funded the local share for capital improvements.\n\nMain Airport phone number: (207) 594-4131\n\nFLIGHT AWARE (Real-Time tracking of scheduled/actual aircraft arrivals and departures)\n\nONLINE AIRPORT PAYMENTS FOR ALL AIRPORT FEES\n\nKnox County APAC Remote Participation Policy\n\nTo report issues related to aviation noise, please click on the above Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Noise Hotline\n\nDocument Center\n\nThe Document Center provides easy access to public documents.
