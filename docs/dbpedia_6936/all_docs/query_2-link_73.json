        "text": "The St. Louis Walk of Fame is badly in need of an additional star. And the next two months would be a great time to add this extra bit of luminescence to its constellation.\n\nSt. Louisans know The Walk as that stretch of Delmar Boulevard – mostly in the University City Loop - that features a series of brass stars and bronze plaques carved into the sidewalk, and is meant to honor those associated with St. Louisans who “made it big.”\n\nIf you happened to have read our blog from last month, you know we took a tongue-in-cheek look at some people we thought should be honored on our own Walk – people who played a big role in the lives of many of us who grew up in St. Louis in the 1960’s and ‘70’s.\n\nWhen you write a column like that, you need to do a bit of research, and we did --just a bit -- reading up on all 150-plus current inductees in The Walk.\n\nOne name remains conspicuous by its absence.\n\nWhere’s hockey’s Dan Kelly?\n\nHe sure seems to fit the criteria for eligibility.\n\nThe Walk of Fame’s website informs us that honorees are “notable people from St. Louis, Missouri who made contributions to the culture of the United States. All inductees were either born in the Greater St Louis area or spent their formative or creative years there.”\n\nDan Kelly wasn’t born in St. Louis. But then again, neither were several other honorees -- including sports broadcasters Jack Buck and Bob Costas, who both were born elsewhere, but “spent their formative or creative years” in St. Louis.\n\nSo, Kelly fits the bill on the “from St. Louis” score.\n\nDid Dan Kelly contribute to the culture of the United States?\n\nI’d say so.\n\nHe came to St. Louis in 1968 from Canada, where he was a member – but not the lead player – of that country’s famed Hockey Night in Canada telecasts.\n\nAs the play-by-play man for the St. Louis Blues, Kelly’s booming voice – transmitted over 50,000 watt clear channel St. Louis radio station KMOX --sliced through the static of other, lesser-powered stations and reached 44 US states – and his native Canada.\n\nLong before today’s era in which finding a hockey broadcast is as easy as dialing up a cable TV station or downloading a smart phone app, legions of hockey fans across North America suddenly, beginning in 1968, had a new, exciting voice at 1120 on the AM dial to entertain and inform them on cold winter nights.\n\nWith St. Louis as his base – Kelly’s international star rose quickly. He became the lead broadcaster for nationally televised NHL games in the United States and Canada, working for CBS, the NHL Network, the USA Network, CBC, CTV and Canwest-Global. He was the play-by-play guy for the 1987 Canada Cup and was CTV’s lead announcer for the 1988 Winter Olympics.\n\nIn a March 1985 Sports Illustrated article, author William Taaffee wrote of Kelly, “He dominates his sport like no other announcer. There’s the stout Irishman, and then there’s the rest of the hockey announcing universe. Kelly is the purest, most knowledgeable, most accurate voice around.\"\n\nSo yes, in becoming the authoritative voice of the game, Dan Kelly certainly contributed to the culture of the U.S. – and Canada.\n\nThey’re not among the criteria for eligibility, but there are a couple of other reasons why Dan Kelly’s name should be included on the St. Louis Walk of Fame:\n\nUnlike some honorees who grew up in St. Louis and left, Kelly and family came to the city and stayed, as the broadcaster's professional resume grew.\n\nThe Kelly’s took a flyer on St. Louis. It paid off, and they stuck around.\n\nWhen Dan accepted his job offer at KMOX, “I had never even been to St. Louis,” admitted Dan’s wife Fran, in an interview earlier this month, “and I didn’t know much about it.”\n\nBut she did know how much being an NHL announcer meant to her husband, so, with Dan on the road accompanying the Blues in December 1968, she packed up the couple’s five (at the time) kids and made the journey south from Ontario.\n\nOver the ensuing years, the Kelly family became solid St. Louisans -- at school, in their neighborhoods, and as one journalist recalls, in church.\n\nScott Simon, a former St. Louis media columnist and broadcaster, grew up a parishioner in St. Monica’s Catholic Church in Creve Coeur, where he’d see Dan Kelly attending Sunday night mass - a worship service held at an hour that accommodated Kelly's usually frenetic weekend broadcast schedule - a schedule that sometimes included a Missouri University football game on Saturday afternoon, a Blues game Saturday night, and a St. Louis Football Cardinal game on Sunday.\n\n“Millions knew Dan as a great hockey announcer,” says Simon. “We knew him as a great friend at St. Monica.” Members of Kelly’s family were with him at times, because, as daughter Cathy, now in public relations in the suburban Parkway School District notes, “church attendance was mandatory!”\n\nThe six Kelly kids are all adults now – and five of them, along with Fran, still live and work in St. Louis. Among them is John Kelly, the current TV voice of the hockey team.\n\nNone of the above is to suggest the Kelly’s were much different from thousands of other families that called St. Louis home. But it’s nice to know that while the family could have chosen another “home base” while Dan’s star rose, they decided to keep their feet on the ground in St. Louis.\n\nFinally, I don’t know if the people who choose the honorees for the Walk of Fame consider “extra credit,” but if so, they should revisit the photos and videos of what happened in downtown St. Louis on June 15, 2019.\n\nThat day, an estimated 100,000 fans lined up on Market Street for a raucous party that celebrated the Blues’ first Stanley Cup victory in the franchise’s 52 years. Thousands more gathered for the same purpose, beneath the Gateway Arch along the St. Louis riverfront. Many of those who gathered on that Saturday afternoon were too young to have experienced Dan Kelly’s days as the Voice of the Blues.\n\nBut their moms and dads did, and they were the kids who fell in love with the game – largely because of the sense of excitement Kelly's work conveyed in the broadcast booth. As parents and grandparents, they passed that love of the game, and the team, to their kids and grandkids.\n\n“People who now hear his chronicling of historic Blues moments may not have been around to hear them live,” says former St. Louis Globe-Democrat sports writer George Csolak. “But Dan’s voice is a constant in the team’s history. It’s truly helped grow the popularity of the sport” in St. Louis.\n\nCsolak is among those who caught the hockey “bug” largely because of Kelly. As an 11-year-old, hearing the announcer’s voice on the radio for the first time, “mesmerized me, starting a lifelong love affair with the team, and the sport.”\n\n“Dan Kelly turned my life as a sports fan upside down,\" says Csolak, who went on to become the Globe’s Blues beat writer, traveling with the team and getting to know Kelly on a personal basis.\n\nIt’s not as if Dan Kelly especially needs another honor – his resume is pretty award-rich as it is.\n\nHe was posthumously inducted into the broadcast wing of the Hockey Hall of Fame. He’s a member of the Missouri Broadcasters Hall of Fame, the St. Louis Amateur Hockey Hall of Fame, and the St. Louis Sports Hall of Fame. In 1989, the month before he died, Kelly received the Lester Patrick Award, given annually by the NHL for outstanding service to hockey in the United States.\n\nStill, it would be nice to see a man who earned his stripes as a broadcaster, a St. Louisan, and an international ambassador for hockey – get his star on The Walk.\n\nHanging from the rafters of the Enterprise Center – the current home of the Blues – is a large banner that honors Kelly. It features his name, positioned above a green shamrock, considered the national emblem of Ireland.\n\nFebruary marks the 32nd anniversary of Kelly’s passing. In March, you’ll be seeing lots of shamrocks around town in honor of St. Patrick’s Day.\n\nSo, these next couple of months would be a great time to start thinking about shamrocks – and a new star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame.\n\nOne that honors Patrick Daniel Kelly.\n\nAs always, thanks for reading."
