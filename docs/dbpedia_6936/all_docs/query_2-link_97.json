        "text": "I'm starting to love this app already, I may rely on it than \"The Score\" app for everything Blues. Probably the only thing I find wrong with it is the goal horn music, but that's just me. I guess I'm of the very few who'd like to hear the most current goal horn music that can be found at a website that I'll link to you guys through App Support. It's just a suggestion for a more updated song without the whistle at the end. I don't mind if you guys won't change, but if you ever want to, there's my suggestion.\n\nThe âlistenâ button on the home page which gives you the radio broadcast is broken. The broadcast will play for a couple of minutes and stops. There should also be a second screen, after you click listen, where you can rewind the broadcast or pause it. Otherwise itâs a great app."
