We are a supporter, funder, convener, innovator, and advocate. We believe that to create lasting change, we need to #UNITE4CHANGE. We are bringing together community members, advocates, subject matter experts, and leaders to create better systems for our neighbors in areas such as food, economic mobility education, and housing.\n\nWe are going beyond the traditional United Way model as more than just a nonprofit funder. We are working in advocacy, both locally and across our state. We are a volunteer hub, matching community members ready to serve with other area nonprofits in need of support. We are a nonprofit capacity builder, providing training, relationship building, consulting services, and more to partner agencies."
