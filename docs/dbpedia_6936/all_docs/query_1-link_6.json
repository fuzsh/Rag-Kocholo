The event, with Bud Light, 101 ESPN, and WIL 92.3 as presenting partners, features musicians Chris Lane and Marquise Knox and tickets are still available at stlouisblues.com.\n\nâHubbard Broadcasting and 101 ESPN are very excited to extend this new five-year partnership with the St. Louis Blues,â said Kijowski.Â âThis relationship brings exciting opportunities for joint initiatives that will captivate fans, engage communities, and amplify our shared message of teamwork and determination.â\n\nSince 2009, 101 ESPN has been the only local and live sports talk radio station in the St. Louis area, delivering quality sports programming, innovative features and online content for area sports fans.
