        "text": "Darrion Cockrell - Parkway Central High School, Class of 2005\n\nCockrell, a December 2013 graduate of the University of Missouri-St. Louis, began his career as a paraprofessional through the Special School District of St. Louis County and worked in the Parkway C-2 school district in the 2014 spring semester. He then spent one year at Lafayette High School (Rockwood R-VI) before starting his current role at Crestwood in August 2015. In addition to creating the Crest-Fit program, Cockrell started the “Dads’ Club Open Gym,” a weekly event for local fathers to play basketball in the evening.\n\nIn 2020, Cockrell received a 2020 National Box Tops for Education Twilight Award, presented by Grammy-award winning rapper, singer/songwriter and activist, Chance the Rapper. Mr. DC understands that teachers are not only there to teach students, but also to be a father-figure, big brother, uncle, friend, counselor, and to some students, a hero. Darrion serves on Crestwood’s diversity team and the Missouri Society of Health and Physical Education Equity, Diversity and Inclusion task force to advocate for more males in schools and diversifying our nation’s classrooms to ensure every student has a father-figure, big brother or superhero to see as a role model.\n\nIn 2021, Darrion Cockrell (better known as Mr. DC), a physical education teacher at Crestwood Elementary School in St. Louis, was selected by a committee of his peers and education partners across the state as the 2021 Missouri Teacher of the Year. He became the 52nd Missouri Teacher of the Year since the program’s inception in 1957, is the second recipient from the Lindbergh school district, and is the first male to capture the state’s top education award since 2015. Additionally, he is Missouri's first Black Male Educator of the year.\n\nAs Missouri Teacher of the Year, Mr. DC has traveled across the state, and the country, sharing his personal story as a keynote speaker for educators nationwide. It is only fitting to nominate Mr. DC for Parkway’s alumni honor, since so many individuals in the Parkway community made such a huge impact on his life as a student, and his decision to become an education professional.\n\nMark Fisher - Parkway Central High School, Class of 1979\n\nAn entrepreneur at heart! After attending KU, Mark has spent his career building Great Clips from the ground up. Mark tells stories of eating ramen, working a paper route, and as a receptionist at his own stores during the first year(s) of operation. Today he sits on 3-5 corporate leadership boards of Great Clips and is constantly asked to give input and insight into why his organization continues to be a top performer year after year. In 2018 was named Great Clips Franchisee of the Year. His goal was to be the #1 Great Clips market - in 2019 he made it to #3 before COVID-19. That's pretty remarkable considering there are nearly 200 markets between the US and Canada and Mark's stores are all in the Topeka Kansas market.\n\nMark currently employs somewhere around 95 women and 3 or 4 men. Most of these women are mothers, with one or more kids, and are significant contributors to their household income. Along with his public career serving the community, he has given over 120 pint to blood over the years to a local Kansas blood bank.\n\nMark has grown a business in a very difficult and changing marketplace. The fact that he's been so successful all these years is a credit to his ability to being open-minded and willing to trust his feeling and the people he hires.\n\nThe way his employees talk about him says it all. Mark is not just Respected, he's loved. Mark has also been a constant giver his entire life.\n\nSilas Goldman - Parkway North High School, Class of 1999\n\nSilas Goldman, began handball career at age 4 and was a dominant player in the Junior world circuit from ‘91-‘97 while at Parkway North High.

Despite suffering from a rare genetic disease called Ehlers Danlos which has left her partly wheel chair dependent and in chronic pain, Katie has pushed through her significant physical disabilities to serve others. Together with her service and trained therapy dog named Moxie, Katie has proven to be relentless in her efforts to \"pass it forward.\"\n\nHer community leadership accomplishments in service to others include: The development of a high school assembly program in Kansas known as City Conquest where she traveled to school assemblies to speak on the dangers of drinking and driving, risk behaviors, resilience and mental health issues. The advancement throughout the State of Kansas of a program called \"ACEing Autism,\" teaching tennis to individuals with autism. (Before her illness, Katie was a collegiate tennis player.) The coordination of a \"Wish Club\" at the high school where she worked as a social worker, raising money to help give a wish to a Make a Wish child. Her goal was to raise the $5000 needed to grant one wish. Katie raised $10,000 and was able to give two terminal children their most special wish. And perhaps most importantly, the founding of a 501-C-3 nonprofit organization called \"Moxie's Mission\" which provides service dogs to individuals suffering from a range of hardships including chronic illness, disability or post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nSince 2019 Moxie's Mission has raised enough funds (through special events and individual donations) to provide three service dogs; one to a college professor who struggles with medical trauma, one to a veteran suffering from PTSD and another to an individual in St. Louis who struggles with epilepsy. Moxie’s Mission is now in the process of funding their 4th service dog, who will go to a Veteran.\n\nIn addition, Katie has written a children's book called \"Moxie Makes a Difference\" which will be published in early 2022 teaching resilience, disability awareness and the gift of a service dog for those in need.\n\nThis year, Katie will travel throughout the Country to elementary and high schools using the book, her experience with her own disabilities and her dog Moxie to speak on mental health, resilience, and disability sensitivity. And although she acts as the Founder and Executive Director of Moxie's Mission, she takes no salary, committing all funds of the organization to the effort of providing service dogs to those in need. She has recently relocated to the Ballwin area where she acts as a licensed social worker (LMSW) in private practice and telehealth services. (Her work in this area is either on a \"pay as you're able\" or pro bono basis.) Through surgeries, physical therapy and other medical interventions, Katie is able to walk short distances with either a cane or walker. Her joints still dislocate and she has a chronic brain and spinal leak that requires constant infusions yet she pushes on, works through her pain and makes a very real difference in her community.\n\nRandy Karraker - Parkway North High School, Class of 1980\n\nRandy Karraker is an institution in St. Louis media.
