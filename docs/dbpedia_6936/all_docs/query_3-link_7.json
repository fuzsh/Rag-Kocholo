        "text": "HISTORY\n\nKnox Theological Seminary was founded in 1989 by Dr. D. James Kennedy under the guidance of Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church. It is the fulfillment of their vision â to rekindle a reformation in our own time and take the transforming truth of Jesus Christ to the world.\n\nIn 2008, under the leadership of President Emeritus Dr. Ronald Kovack, Knox introduced fully-accredited online degree programs to complement their traditional residential offerings. The move to provide quality online education, without ever sacrificing academic integrity, has allowed Knox to meet students where God has called them and train church leaders around the world. In 2013, Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church established Knox as an independent, 501(c)(3) corporation, maintaining the historical connection to the legacy of Dr. Kennedyâs vision, while allowing Knox to operate as an independent organization.\n\nâ\n\nAFFILIATION\n\nKnox Theological Seminary is an independent evangelical seminary within the Reformed tradition and home to students from a broad range of denominational backgrounds.\n\nâ\n\nACCREDITATION\n\nKnox Theological Seminary is Accredited by the Commission on Accrediting of the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada, and the following degree programs are approved: Master of Divinity, MA (Christian and Classical Studies), MA (Biblical and Theological Studies), and the Doctor of Ministry.\n\nâ\n\nThe Commission contact information is:\n\nThe Commission on Accrediting of the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada\n\n10 Summit Park Drive\n\nPittsburgh, PA 15275\n\nTelephone: 412-788-6505\n\nFax: 412-788-6510â\n\nWebsite: www.ats.edu\n\nThe Board of Commissioners is recognized by the United States Secretary of Education for the accreditation of schools that offer graduate professional education for ministry. It is also recognized by the current non-governmental organization in the United States that provides the venue for recognition of accrediting bodies, the Council for Higher Education Accreditation.\n\nAccreditation from a nationally recognized accrediting agency such as the ATS Commission provides students and graduates with a host of advantages, including professional recognition among peers and convenient transfer of credits between accredited schools. Accreditation is a requirement for various jobs, such as military chaplaincy and, in many denominations, ordination. It is a great advantage for Knox graduates to know that the degree that they have earned is an approved degree from an ATS Commission accredited school.
