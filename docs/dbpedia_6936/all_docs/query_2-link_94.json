        "text": "I’m going to be honest here for a second. I was really looking forward to covering history today, but last night, the White Sox dashed my hopes when they broke their 21-game losing streak. As a writer and fan, I am exceptionally annoyed about enduring the torture of South Side baseball all season. The very least they could do is be the best at being the worst. They did redeem themselves today, though, by starting a new losing streak, so I suppose I can be grateful for small wins that are losses.\n\nThe Good Guys took an early 2-0 lead in the top of the second on another two-run dinger by Andrew Benintendi. Hey, 75 million dollar man — thanks for finally showing up to play baseball, although it’s too little too late. He’s slashing .391/.417/.913 over the last seven games with three homers and nine RBIs.\n\nBenny drove in Andrew Vaughn, who doubled and advanced to third on an error by right fielder Lawrence Butler. And speaking of getting hot, Vaughn’s been getting it done, too. He’s hitting .292/.346/.583 over the past week. I’m having a hard time not feeling bitter about this because 1. maybe someone would have wanted him and Benny at the trade deadline had they started this sooner, and 2. what even is the point of getting hot now?\n\nThe Sox played some all-around solid, competent baseball in today’s contest, including some nice defense. Lenyn Sosa has been dreadful at the plate, but he made a great catch in the albatross of Oakland’s foul territory.\n\nDavis Martin made his second start and third appearance of the year. The 27-year-old missed all of 2023 due to Tommy John surgery. As a rookie in 2022, he posted a 3-6 record with a 4.83 in 14 games (nine starts). Davis was dealin’ this afternoon, effective and efficient, with both his cutter and slider working well for him. The righthander earned a quality start and held the A’s hitless through four innings, ultimately surrendering no runs on two hits with one walk and four strikeouts over six frames.\n\nUnfortunately, Martin’s terrific outing was a complete waste, as the pen stunk it up yet again. Touki Toussaint came on in the seventh and gave up two broken-bat singles and a walk. He managed to only get one out before being replaced by Dominic Leone, who tried to limit the damage but couldn’t.\n\nThree runs later, the Sox saw their 2-0 lead morph into a 3-2 deficit. Of course, they were unable to score any more runs, and they’re now 0-66 when trailing after seven innings. Just like that, they also have 43 blown leads and have lost 10 consecutive series — new losing streaks in the making, baby!"
