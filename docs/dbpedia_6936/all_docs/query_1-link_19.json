        "text": "Beginning with the 2019-20 season, St. Louis Blues games will be heard on 101 ESPN.\n\nThe new four-year agreement has 101 ESPN carrying Blues games and creating new and engaging hockey content for fans through at least the 2022-23 season.\n\n“We are excited to enter into a partnership with 101 ESPN to broadcast our games and to create exciting new Blues and hockey-related content for our fans,” said Steve Chapman, the Blues’ Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer. “The partnership will allow us and 101 ESPN to reach new audiences and create numerous content opportunities that will help meet the demands of our loyal fan base. We are excited about what the future holds.”\n\nWith the move, fans can expect to hear Blues broadcasters Chris Kerber and Joey Vitale call the action live on 101.1 FM in addition to a variety of free online platforms, including stlouisblues.com, 101espn.com, the NHL App and 101 ESPN app, which are available for iOS and Android devices.\n\nThe partnership also promises a variety of new dedicated Blues content, including over-the-air shows, original hockey-oriented segments across five stations, online podcasts, video web casts, special events and more. Partnering with Hubbard Radio, which owns 101 ESPN, 105.7 The Point, KSHE 95, New Country 92.3 and 106.5 The Arch, gives the Blues plenty of unique cross-promotional opportunities.\n\n“The 101 ESPN team and our Hubbard Radio St. Louis family are excited to be the new home for the St. Louis Blues,” said Brand Content Director Chris Neupert. “Our entire team is looking forward to the partnership with the St. Louis Blues and the opportunity to offer innovative content and exclusive interviews, analysis and coverage for St. Louis fans.”\n\n“It has always been a dream to partner with the St. Louis Blues organization,” added John Kijowski, Hubbard St. Louis Vice President and Market Manager. “The Blues management team is a class act and their fans are the best in professional hockey.”\n\nSince 2009, 101 ESPN has been the only local and live sports talk radio station in the St. Louis area, delivering quality sports programming, innovative features and online content for area sports fans. The station boasts some of the biggest names in sports talk radio, including Bernie Miklasz, Kevin Wheeler and popular shows such as The Fast Lane with Randy Karraker, Brad Thompson and Chris Rongey and The Turn, featuring Anthony Stalter. The station’s show hosts and contributors have been nominated and awarded numerous industry accolades, including back-to-back nominations for the National Association of Broadcasters’ Marconi Award for Sports/Talk radio in 2017 and 2018.\n\nBlues games, Chili’s Week in Hockey and Boardwalk Hardwood Floors Behind the Bench will continue to air on KMOX 1120 AM through the remainder of the 2018-19 regular season and playoffs, concluding a 12-year run with KMOX as the flagship station for Blues hockey.\n\n“We would like to thank the entire KMOX team for both their commitment and partnership to the Blues and fans throughout the region,” Chapman said."
