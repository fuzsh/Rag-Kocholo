        "text": "Knox Lecture Hall contains one large hall accommodating 400 students, three medium-sized halls for 250 students, and two smaller classrooms for 90 students each. The features of the lecture facilities include projection booths with up-to-date interactive capabilities, retractable screens, and demonstration benches for wet lab experiments.\n\nGrace Knox (1862-1936) generously provided the university with the means to establish the College of Arts and Sciences after the death of her husband, Seymour Knox. The Knox family continues to serve both the university and the Greater Buffalo area as civic, cultural, and philanthropic leaders."
