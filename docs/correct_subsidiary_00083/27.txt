EMC last week joined two of its startups Mozy and Pi together to form a new company called Decho that will help consumers manage their personal digital information – their digital echo.

Decho will be managed as a subsidiary of EMC – the company will over Mozy-branded online backup services – you’ve all see the advertisements on TV – and Pi branded cloud-based services for consumers over time.

A year ago EMC turned its attention to the vast amounts of data users have that are stored under beds, in boxes and filing cabinets – information such as financial records, personal documents, photos, and digital information such as videos, more photos and tons of e-mails and documents generated every day. The company says that this amount of digital information is expected to grow by almost 60% each year.

As the amount of data grows that is trapped under beds and in filing boxes, there’s a need to be able to store some of it in the cloud, so individuals can trust someone else to preserve it for them.

Mozy, which was acquired by EMC in October 2007 and Pi founded by Paul Maritz formerly of Microsoft, will be headquartered in Seattle. The company is actively recruiting a CEO.

Decho claims that 900,000 users and 25,000 business organizations are swimmingly using Mozy to protect over 10PB of data.
