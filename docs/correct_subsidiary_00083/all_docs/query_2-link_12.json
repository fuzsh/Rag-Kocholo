        "text": "AUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Spanning Cloud Apps, Inc., creators of the powerful, enterprise-class data protection solution Spanning Backup for Google Apps, and Mozy® by EMC® today announced the two companies have joined forces with a comprehensive co-marketing agreement. Mozy, the world’s most trusted provider of cloud backup and data access, and Spanning, the most complete Google Apps backup solution, will co-promote their technologies to offer businesses a new data backup and recovery solution catered to the needs of the two customer bases.\n\n“We are excited to be collaborating with Mozy,” said Charlie Wood, CEO and founder of Spanning. “This relationship is a strategic extension of Mozy’s disk-to-cloud backup capabilities and a validation of Spanning’s technology. Millions of businesses are moving to Google Apps for core business applications. These same organizations, many of which are already Mozy customers, have multifaceted cloud and on-premise servers that require advanced backup and data protection. This agreement is a tremendous opportunity for both organizations to comprehensively address a dynamic and rapidly expanding market.”\n\nThe collaborative marketing agreement is designed to promote each company’s cloud backup products to their respective customer bases and cooperate on future product development opportunities. The two companies will also kick off a far-reaching co-marketing, sales and promotional initiative beginning in April 2013.\n\n“This market collaboration is a strategic fit for Mozy as more companies seek to back up laptops, servers and cloud applications—all to the cloud,” said Russ Stockdale, general manager of Mozy. “We both offer market-leading technologies and can connect our missions to provide businesses with the solutions that are right for their organizations.”\n\nWith more business-critical information in the cloud than ever before, protecting against data loss means avoiding devastating intellectual property, business process and financial losses. According to a recent Aberdeen Group survey, one-third of cloud computing users have suffered data loss.\n\n“Mozy and Spanning share a core market focus,” said Jeff Erramouspe, chief revenue officer, Spanning. “Businesses are leveraging the cloud in increasing numbers and in new ways. To support business continuity and avoid losses, backup and recovery technology is essential.”\n\nLast week Spanning announced closing a $6 million Series B round.\n\nShare on Twitter: @spanningbackup joins forces with @mozy in #Cloudbackup\n\nAbout Mozy\n\nMozy® is the world’s most trusted provider of cloud backup and data access, with more than three million customers, including 80,000 business customers and more than 90 petabytes of information stored at its multiple data centers around the globe.
