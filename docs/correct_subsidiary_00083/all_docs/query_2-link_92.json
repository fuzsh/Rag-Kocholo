Dolphin to Merge with IPTV ISP\n\nEditor:- December 8, 2009 - Dolphin announced that it intends to merge with Best Media AS (an ISP based in Norway - which operates IPTV, IP telephony, internet and mobile phone services).\n\nVerbatim Acquires Freecom\n\nEditor:- September 3, 2009 - Verbatim's parent company (Mitsubishi Kagaku Media Co., Ltd) has acquired Freecom Technologies.\n\nThe Freecom acquisition represents yet another investment made by the MKM/Verbatim group aimed at the growing external hard disk drive market. The asset acquisition of SmartDisk, made in June 2007, has proved successful in establishing MKM/Verbatim in both the portable and desktop external HDD markets on a global basis.\n\nEditor's comments:- Although virtually unknown outside Europe, Freecom was founded 20 years ago in 1989. Its acquisition is sandwiched between FolderShare and FreeDiskSpace.com in our list of 499 gone-away storage companies. Who will be the 500th? It's probably happening as you read this.\n\nEMC Acquires Kazeon\n\nEditor:- September 1, 2009 - EMC today announced it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire privately-held Kazeon Systems.\n\nCore to Kazeon's eDiscovery attractiveness is its ability to handle data that resides anywhere in the enterprise environment - including content on laptops, desktops, content management repositories, email archives and file shares.\n\nEMC Secures Data Domain for $2 billion\n\nEditor:- July 20, 2009 - EMC , today announced that it has acquired majority ownership of Data Domain.\n\nOnce EMC completes the acquisition of Data Domain, which is expected by the end of July, Data Domain will become the foundation of a new product division within EMC's storage business focused on the development and delivery of next-generation disk-based backup, recovery and archive solutions.\n\nEMC's successful offer price of $33.50 per share effectively values Data Domain at $2.1 billion. EMC said it expects expects this new division to continue growing revenue at significant double-digit rates achieving $1 billion in revenue in 2010.\n\nEditor's comments:- the Data Domain bidding saga surfaced in the newswires 2 months ago - when Network Appliance made an offer for about $1.5 billion.\n\nWD Sells Disk Substrate Plant to Hitachi GST\n\nEditor:- May 20, 2009 - WD announced it has agreed to sell the assets of its media substrate manufacturing facility in Sarawak, Malaysia, to a subsidiary of Hitachi GST.\n\nThe employees of WD at the facility will become employees of the purchaser. Acquired storage companies, Hard disk drives\n\nBakBone Acquires Effective Assets of Asempra\n\nEditor:- May 4, 2009 - BakBone Software has acquired certain assets from Asempra Technologies.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, BakBone has agreed to issue 3,846,154 common shares and to pay cash consideration of approximately $350,000, plus accrued royalties.\n\nEditor's comments:- an article in TheRegister speculates that Asempra's VCs (having already invested $29 million) pulled the plug on the cash draining Asempra. This brings the gone-away storage companies list to 491.\n\nTandberg's Tape Bust\n\nEditor:- April 27, 2009 - Tandberg Data has filed for bankruptcy and today announced details of its restructuring plan.\n\nThere's no surprise here. The current recession has merely brought forward an inevitable event. Although Tandberg had acquired and licensed various disk backup technologies it remained culturally wedded to tape.\n\nI've chronicled the transition of the backup market from tape to hard disk and in some ways it's similar to what's been happening in the hard disk market versus flash SSD space. But the SSD market is more complicated - because whereas slow cheap SSDs replace hard drives, fast expensive SSDs replace server CPUs.\n\nAs with hard drives, the highest capacity tape libraries will remain spinning the longest. Nothing stays the same in the storage market for long. Looking ahead at the next 10 years SSDs will replace hard drives in enterprise backup systems too.\n\nBut let's get back to today's news from Tandberg Data, whose CEO, Pat Clarke, said - \"The operations of the Tandberg Data subsidiaries will continue to operate in this new structure, with a much reduced debt burden. The difficult steps we are taking now will enable us to build a company that can be successful in providing data protection solutions and support to our valued customers, suppliers, and business partners for a long time to come\"\n\nTrawling back through gone-away / bust storage companies list (where the score now stands at 490 BTW) a search for \"Tandberg\" reveals it had previously acquired these companies:- LAND-5, InoStor, Exabyte and Computer Design Group.\n\nDataram Acquires Micro Memory Bank\n\nEditor:- April 22, 2009 - Dataram announced it has acquired Micro Memory Bank.\n\nMMB maintains a particular niche in legacy memory products by being one of the few companies in the industry that carries and stocks virtually every memory upgrade ever made.\n\nDataram's President and CEO John Freeman said \"David Sheerr (who founded MMB in 1994) is the 3rd executive to join Dataram in the past 12 months who has had previous experience as the president of a company. David's entrepreneurial skills and business success in our industry are valuable additions to our executive team.\"\n\nSun's Future Lies in Oracle\n\nEditor:- April 20, 2009 - Oracle today announced an agreement to acquire Sun Microsystems for approximately $7.4 billion.\n\nEditor's comments:- this ends nearly a decade of speculation about the future of Sun Microsystems, a company which created a unique server business peaking at over $20 billion annual revenue at the turn of the Millenium.\n\nYou can read how Sun created that market, then lost it piece by piece and then finally lost itself in the storage market in the article which tracks the 22 History of SPARC systems market.\n\nWD Enters the SSD Market\n\nEditor:- March 30, 2009 - Western Digital has entered the SSD market by acquiring SiliconSystems for $65 million in a cash transaction.\n\nIntegration into WD begins immediately, with SiliconSystems now becoming known as the WD Solid-State Storage business unit, complementing WD's existing Branded Products, Client Storage, Consumer Storage and Enterprise Storage business units.\n\n\"WD's strong balance sheet, sales reach, and operations and logistics capabilities will allow us to greatly accelerate our penetration of our existing markets, while combining our engineering expertise with WD will enable us to develop new solid-state drives to broaden our overall product portfolio and address the emerging applications for solid-state storage in WD's existing customer base,\" said Michael Hajeck, a founder and CEO of SiliconSystems, now senior vp and general manager of WD's Solid-State Storage business unit. \"We are extremely excited to be joining WD and enabling an even stronger future for our talented team.\" WD's SSD acquisition FAQs\n\nSpansion Files for Bankruptcy\n\nSUNNYVALE, Calif. - March 1, 2009 - Spansion Inc. the world's largest pure-play provider of flash memory solutions, today filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\n\nThe company believes that its current and anticipated cash resources will be sufficient to pay its expenses and maintain its business operations while it explores and implements options to address its long-term cash needs. Spansion emphasized that it intends to maintain customer service throughout the reorganization. ...Spansion profile, Flash Memory Chips & Cards\n\nHitachi GST Buys Desktop SSD Company\n\nSAN JOSE, Calif. - February 23, 2009 - Hitachi GST today announced that it has agreed to acquire Fabrik, Inc. whose leading storage brands include G-Technology and SimpleTech.\n\nFinancial details of the transaction were not disclosed. Closing of the acquisition, which is subject to customary conditions, is expected to occur early in the 2nd quarter of 2009. Fabrik's business will continue intact and form the core of Hitachi GST's newly-formed external storage business.\n\nHitachi GST will fully support the G-Technology and SimpleTech product lines, building upon their success and differentiation in the market. The combined company will also leverage operational, technical and product development resources, distribution channels and global reach to accelerate delivery of a full portfolio of traditional hard drives, solid state drives and branded personal and professional storage products. ...Hitachi GST profile ...G-Technology profile\n\nToshiba Hopes Fujitsu's HDD IP will Fast Track New Server SSDs\n\nTokyo, Japan - February 17, 2009 - it was confirmed today that Fujitsu plans to transfer its hard disk drive business to Toshiba.\n\nThe companies aim to complete the transaction in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. Fujitsu will facilitate the transfer by bringing its HDD-related businesses and functions together in a new company. Toshiba will acquire about an 80% stake in this company and make it a Toshiba Group subsidiary. In order to promote a smooth transfer, Fujitsu will continue to hold a stake of under 20% in the new company for a certain period of time, after which it will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Toshiba.\n\nToshiba anticipates this will ease its entry into the enterprise HDD market where Fujitsu is currently a leader. Toshiba also plans to marry its flash SSD technology with Fujitsu's HDD IP to spawn new enterprise SSDs . ...Fujitsu profile, ...Toshiba profile\n\nSanDisk and Toshiba Confirm Flash Fab Assets Swap\n\nMILPITAS, CA - January 29, 2009 - SanDisk announced today that it has signed a definitive agreement with Toshiba to restructure their flash manufacturing joint ventures operating at the 300-mm Fab 3 and Fab 4.\n\nAs part of the agreement, more than 20% of the joint ventures'capacity will be transferred to Toshiba. The restructuring will result in the transfer of equipment lease obligations from SanDisk to Toshiba and a cash payment to SanDisk for the transfer of certain equipment currently owned by the joint ventures. The total value to SanDisk is approximately 80 billion yen, or approximately $890 million based on current exchange rates. The lease transfers and cash payment are expected to be completed by the end of the first calendar quarter of 2009. ...SanDisk profile, ...Toshiba profile, merged & gone away storage companies\n\nEditor's comments:- this simply confirms earlier public announcements made by both companies last October.\n\nFujitsu Parks Hard Disk Heads Business\n\nTokyo - January 27, 2009 - Fujitsu Limited announced today that it will discontinue its hard disk drive head business (which employs 360 people) as part of a broader strategic review of the HDD operations.\n\nThe HDD head development and manufacturing operations are currently performed at the Nagano Plant. The company will reassign plant employees working in the HDD head operations to other operations within the Fujitsu Group. ...Fujitsu profile\n\nQimonda Bust\n\nMunich, Germany - January 23, 2009 - Qimonda AG has petitioned for the opening of insolvency proceedings due to illiquidity.\n\nTo comply with German law the company has announced the appointment of insolvency administrators. ...Qimonda profile\n\nEditor's comments:- Qimonda's revenue in 2008 was 1/2 the level it had been 2 years earlier, and the outcome (in today's press release) was predicted in an article I wrote in 2006 - the names change but the problems remain the same.\n\nObjective Analysis has published an article about the lead up to Qimonda's insolvency and explores the possible fallout for Qimonda's stakeholders.\n\nPlasmon Restructures as New Company\n\nColorado Springs, Colo - October 23, 2008 - Newly formed Plasmon Holding LLC announced today that it has completed a management buyout and organisational restructuring of assets from Plasmon PLC, a trusted source of data archiving systems for over 20 years.\n\nThe transaction is intended to capitalise and reposition Plasmon over the long term. Under the restructuring, Plasmon Inc, formerly a US-based subsidiary to the UK company, will become the worldwide headquarters. The \"new\" Plasmon will offer its market leading archiving solutions and services in all global territories. ...Plasmon profile, gone away storage companies\n\nSanDisk May Offload Fab Costs to Toshiba after Announcing Sustained Decline in Revenue\n\nMilpitas, CA, - October 20, 2008 - SanDisk Corp , today announced results for the 3rd quarter ended September 28, 2008, and a plan to restructure joint venture operations with Toshiba.\n\nTotal Q3 revenue was $821 million, a decrease of 21% on a year-over-year basis. Net loss in accordance with GAAP was $155 million.\n\nSanDisk also announced today an agreement neabling it to sell 30% of its shared wafer fab capacity to Toshiba which could reduce its equipment lease obligations by approximately $1 billion. However, SanDisk and Toshiba will continue to be equal partners for the approximately 70%capacity of the fabs that remain in the joint ventures. ...SanDisk profile\n\nAnalyst comments:- from - Jim Handy, Objective Analysis\n\nThis assets-for-cash swap will bolster SanDisk's coffers during a time when the company's stock price is depressed, but their cash position was not desperate during their last earnings announcement. Why would SanDisk be interested in an infusion of cash at this moment?\n\nWe can only guess that this cash might be used to repurchase depressed SanDisk shares whose price dropped on this news from around $16.50 last week to just under $14 at the writing of this Alert. SanDisk could use this measure to help thwart Samsung's takeover bid, remaining independent until 2009's NAND recovery drives its stock back to record levels.\n\nEver since Samsung made public its desire to acquire SanDisk (Sept 17) the industry has been abuzz with rumors of a Toshiba takeover. Although the SanDisk/Toshiba partnership would do better without a Samsung acquisition, Toshiba made it clear that a takeover was not in the cards. This move appears to be the company's alternative.\n\nMicron Pays $400 million for Bigger Slice of Nanya Technology\n\nBoise, Idaho , Sunday, October 12, 2008 - Micron Technology, Inc., today announced that it is expanding its partnership with Nanya Technology Corp and signing a definitive agreement to acquire Qimonda AG's 35.6% ownership stake in Inotera for $400 million in cash.\n\nIn the current Qimonda and Nanya partnership, Inotera operates 2 state-of-the-art 300 millimeter wafer fabrication facilities producing a total of 120,000 wafers per month. Under the agreement, Micron will acquire access to half of the total manufacturing capacity of Inotera, with the other half allocated to Nanya. Micron will also share its industry-leading Stack DRAM technology with Inotera for the production of Stack DRAM products for Micron and Nanya. ...Micron profile, ...Nanya profile, ...Qimonda profile, Acquired storage companies\n\nBackground and comments from - Jim Handy, Objective Analysis\n\nA Shrewd Mover in Tough Times - Micron is once again doing its part to consolidate the DRAM market. The company has a successful track record of acquiring struggling competitors' manufacturing capacity when the market is depressed. This is a strategy that has worked well for Micron to date, and will give them some much-needed 300mm capacity.\n\nWe remind our audience that manufacturing costs in a 300mm plant are about 30% lower than they are for the same process running in a 200mm plant. With today's DRAMs selling at or below cost, all competitors need to shed themselves of their 200mm capacity as soon as they can.\n\nThis announcement comes only 3 days after Micron announced the closing of their 200mm facilities in Boise. While other companies are converting plants from 200mm to 300mm, Micron is taking the approach of closing 200mm capacity and purchasing 300mm capacity at bargain-basement prices, and this deal is indeed a bargain!\n\nThe $400 million that Micron is paying for 60,000 wafer starts in Inotera's 300mm line is significantly less expensive than the $550 million the company had planned to invest in the MeiYa JV for an output we estimate to be roughly half that size.\n\nNanya  Planning for Tomorrow - Nanya will be playing the same role in with Micron the future that the company has played with Qimonda in the past: Nanya supplies capital and manufacturing competence in return for technology.\n\nDeath Knell for Trench? - Qimonda is the last company to continue to support a trench cell process for DRAM  all other DRAM makers use a stacked-capacitor approach. Trench technology, pioneered in the 1990s by IBM, Siemens, and Toshiba, has seen its support base shrink mainly through consolidations. Qimonda is the remnant of the DRAM manufacturing arms of the 3 trench pioneers.\n\nNanya was the only other company supporting trench technology through its relationship with Qimonda, and in March Nanya signed an MOU with Micron to obtain rights to Micron's stacked-capacitor design. Qimonda itself explained that their path to the 30nm process node would be through their buried wordline design, which harnesses aspects of both trench and stacked capacitor designs.\n\nAnd What about Qimonda? - This transaction brings some much-needed cash to Qimonda. The company has been suffering significantly during the current protracted downturn. We believe this is the reason why the deal involves cash, rather than stock.\n\nDataram Re-enters the SSD Accelerator Market\n\nRedding, CA - October 8, 2008 - it was announced today that Dataram Corp has acquired the strategic assets of Cenatek, Inc.\n\n\"I am very pleased that we have successfully completed this transaction,\" said Jason Caulkins, CEO of Cenatek. \"Dataram is providing significant resources to build upon the Cenatek product line, roadmap and IP portfolio.\"\n\n\"This acquisition signifies the beginning of a series of focused efforts to move Dataram into new, growing markets that align well with Dataram's existing products and customer base,\" said John Freeman, President and CEO of Dataram. \"We are moving very quickly to license, acquire and develop these new products, including software, into our customer-focused product lineup.\"\n\nCaulkins has joined Dataram to lead the company's return to solid state storage, an area they pioneered almost 40 years ago. \"I am looking forward to contributing to the continued growth and success of Dataram,\" Caulkins added. \"I would also like to thank Cenatek's investors and employees for their hard work and commitment to success.\" ...Dataram profile, ...Cenatek profile, RAM based SSDs\n\nEditor's comments:- this is a very significant milestone for the SSD market because it shows the strategic value that memory makers place on SSDs.\n\nIn the past companies like Intel have resold 3rd party SSD cards, STEC divested itself of its vanilla memory business and Samsung would like to own and control MLC patents now in the hands of SanDisk.\n\nLook at it from the viewpoint of a memory maker.\n\nFuture server systems will have orders of magnitude more memory in the attached SSDs than installed as main RAM memory. Who owns the brand of the SSD boxes will mean a dramatic difference to attainable revenue. Being locked out of the SSD box - will mean that a memory maker can only access smaller markets - or supply other SSD oems at commodity proces. I expect to report many more such acquisitions during the next few years.\n\n...Later:- when discussing this story my wife said this is an example of a marketing concept called \"forward integration.\"\n\nHP Acquires Sinister Appendage\n\nPALO ALTO, Calif. - October 1, 2008 - HP today announced it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire LeftHand Networks Inc. for $360 million in cash, subject to certain purchase price adjustments.\n\nFounded in 1999, LeftHand Networks is privately held and headquartered in Boulder, Colo. It has 215 employees and more than 500 resellers and distributors worldwide. The company has more than 11,000 installations across 3,000 different customers. HP says the acquisition will strengthen its midrange iSCSI product line. ...LeftHand Networks profile\n\nEditor's comments:- LeftHand Networks joins my list of 471 gone away storage companies nestling alphabetically between LapiStor and Legato Systems.\n\nSome of these have more interesting stories attached to them than others. Sometimes it's the technology that goes wrong (or never gets started). But usually acquisitions result from a weakness in marketing. My view is that most VC funded storage software companies - never had a viable standalone business plan in the first place - and getting acquired was always part of the thinking. I can only judge by what I've seen.\n\nA few weeks ago StorageMojo - Robin Harris - published an informative blog about the demise of YottaYotta. It can be interesting to read about storage people and be inspired by their success or learn from their mistakes.\n\nPhil Soran, president and CEO of Compellent came up with a sharp comment about HP acquiring LeftHand. \"HP's intent to acquire LeftHand Networks, similar to Dell's purchase of EqualLogic last November, demonstrates legacy vendors' approach to meeting the needs of the mid-sized enterprise market: buy someone else's technology and try to fit it into an existing product portfolio, which leads customers to a rip-and-replace strategy as they grow. While this may be easier for the vendors than developing their own scalable infrastructure, it is certainly not better for customers.\"\n\nFinally - going back to my headline for this story... \"sinister\" is ye olde English - meaning the left hand side of a knight's body armor.\n\nSeagate Services Renamed i365\n\nEditor:- September 23, 2008 - Seagate today announced a comprehensive rebranding of its EVault, MetaLINCS, and Seagate Recovery Services companies into a single new brand - i365\n\ni365, a Seagate Company, focuses on the unique needs and expectations of small, mid-size and enterprise companies. The \"i\" in the name represents information and \"365\" for commitment to be reliably available and accessible to customers.\n\nThe product offerings from i365 include i365 EVault Data Protection, enabling the protection and recovery of businesses' mission critical data; i365 MetaLINCS E-Discovery solutions for first pass processing, content analysis, and review of electronic information for investigatory and litigation needs; and i365 Retention Management solutions comprising data recovery, migration, restoration and data management that bridge the needs of E-Discovery and data preservation.\n\nSamsung Publishes Offer to Buy SanDisk Shares\n\nEditor:- September 17, 2008 - Samsung Electronics today published an open letter aimed at shareholders offering to buy SanDisk.\n\nIn this letter you can see that Samsung has been talking to SanDisk about this for many months - and is frustrated by unrealistic market and pricing expectations from SanDisk's management.\n\nMy own view re SanDisk is that the company wasted many opportunities it had in the SSD market which would have been enabled by its acquisition of M-Systems in 2006. Having acquired a company with a track record of innovation in high speed flash SSDs - SanDisk apparently ignored or deliberately dropped those server-ready product lines and focused instead on the suicide \"me-too\" consumer end of the SSD market. Not surprisingly as result SanDisk has been losing market share in the SSD market at high double digit rates.\n\nHere are some comments from other SSD analysts.\n\nJim Handy at Objective Analysis... \"SanDisk is in the midst of negotiations with Samsung to renew patent licenses under which Samsung is paying SanDisk hundreds of millions every year. Should Samsung succeed in this acquisition, Samsung will be in a position to receive a similar royalty stream, and to perhaps grow that stream to something significantly larger than SanDisk's current royalty revenue. Something we have not mentioned yet is that SanDisk not only owns a large share of the intellectual property covering 2-bit MLC, but they appear to be the only company to own 3-bit and 4-bit IP, and are likely to profit handsomely from this position over the next two years. What about Toshiba? Ever since SanDisk converted from NOR to NAND early this decade they have had a very close relationship with Toshiba. \"\n\nSanDisk focused blogger - Savo Lainen hasn't said anything as we go to press, but his comments are always interesting.\n\nGregory Wong founder of Forward Insights discussed this rumor last week and may have a follow-up.\n\nSanDisk issued its own press release - effectively saying No! to Samsung's offer. And among other things -derided it as - \"an opportunistic attempt to take advantage of SanDisk's current stock price, which is significantly depressed given industry cyclicality, the uncertainty resulting from the unresolved patent cross license agreement renewal with Samsung, and general equity market conditions.\"\n\nSamsung SanDisk Synergy Dissected\n\nEditor: - September 8, 2008 - in his latest blog Gregory Wong founder of Forward Insights analyzes the business arguments for and against a rumored Samsung acquisition of SanDisk.\n\n...Forward Insights profile, SSD analysts\n\nAdaptec Acquires RAID Controller Maker Aristos Logic\n\nMILPITAS, Calif. :- August 28, 2008 - Adaptec Inc. today announced it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Aristos Logic Corp in a cash transaction worth approximately $41 million.\n\nAdaptec's president and CEO Sundi Sundaresh said - \"Aristos Logic will provide us with a strong ASIC roadmap. Their next generation 6 Gb/s serial RAID controllers will expand our channel offerings and enhance the value of our current lines of Unified Serial SATA and SAS products.\" ...Adaptec profile, ...Aristos Logic profile, acquired storage companies, RAID controllers\n\nSeagate to buy SanDisk? - an Analyst's View\n\nEditor:- August 18, 2008 - in his recent blog Gregory Wong, founder of Forward Insights, discusses the pros and cons of Seagate acquiring SanDisk or Intel's flash business.\n\nMy own views on this haven't changed since I published Seagate will Fail the SSD Challenge. Gregory Wong makes some interesting numerical comparisons in his analytical article. ...Forward Insights profile, ...SanDisk profile\n\nSnap Server Changes Ownership Again\n\nMILPITAS, Calif - June 30, 2008 - Adaptec Inc. today announced that it has sold its Snap Server NAS business, including the brand and all assets to Overland Storage Inc. for a net consideration of $3.6 million.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Adaptec will retain ownership of all iSCSI-based hardware and software products and assets, which will be rebranded and managed by Adaptec.\n\nOverland Storage will take over control of all existing Snap Server networked and desktop storage appliance assets including licenses, patents, existing product inventory and fixed assets and assume customer support obligations. Approximately 50 Adaptec employees will receive offers to join Overland Storage effective June 30, 2008. ...Adaptec profile, ...Overland Storage profile\n\nEditor's comments:- spun off from Quantum in October 2002 - Snap Appliance was acquired by Adaptec in July 2004. So in 6 years it's bounced from a tape backup owner, to a RAID HBA owner and now back to a tape / d2d company again."
