        "text": "As Dell Technologies continues to examine the potential for major changes in its operational strategy, the Round Rock-based tech giant is also making smaller moves.\n\nDell has agreed to sell one of its subsidiaries, cloud backup firm Mozy Inc., to Carbonite for $145.8 million in cash. Based in Boston, Carbonite also performs cloud backup and protection services.\n\nThe sale is expected to close during the first quarter of this year.\n\nCarbonite CEO Mohamad Ali said that his company’s purchase of Mozy would help it expand its customer base and “provides Mozy customers scalable options for the future and gives Carbonite a broader base to which we offer our solutions.”\n\nThe sale of Mozy comes just weeks after Dell confirmed that it is considering becoming a publicly-traded company again through an initial public offering or reverse merger with VMware, the public cloud computing firm over which Dell has majority control.\n\nBoth moves could help Dell raise revenue as it tackles billions in debt left over from its purchase of data store giant EMC Corp. in 2016 and privatization of company in 2013.\n\nDell acquired Mozy through its $67 billion purchase of EMC, so its sale could largely be Dell getting rid of a service that didn’t fit with its plans for EMC, said industry analyst Roger Kay with Endpoint Technology Associates.\n\n“The cash comes in handy for debt service,” Kay said. “Mozy was originally a bolt-on at EMC. It may never have been a great fit.”\n\nAt the same time, analyst Patrick Moorhead with Moor Insights & Strategy said the sale of Mozy shows Dell is taking a close look at its sources of funding as it determines its next steps. Dell recently said it has paid off almost $10 billion of its gross debt, but the company still owes more than $52 billion.\n\n“I’m sorry to see (Mozy) go,” Moorhead said. “As a storage business, (Dell) will need to address both the cloud and on-premises (software division), which is why I liked (Mozy) in the Dell tech portfolio in the first place.”\n\nIn a recent memo to employees made public through a securities filing, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell said his company was considering options as part of “multi-year strategic planning.”\n\nThe company said those options included an IPO, a reverse merger with VMware, or standing pat. Dell also ruled out a sale to a third party. Less than five years after becoming a private company, Dell could be facing pressure from investors who want to get a greater return on their investment.\n\nWhile an IPO would help Dell raise funds through the selling of company stock, analysts have said a sale to VMware, which would essentially be Dell selling the company to itself, could also be a way for Dell to become public without having to go through the more complicated IPO process. Dell gained control of VMware through the EMC purchase.\n\nAdditionally, Dell is reported to also be considering purchasing the rest of VMware.\n\n“As you can see from our results, we do this from a position of strength, with a desire to grow Dell Technologies and its businesses even faster and thrive in the very dynamic IT marketplace,” Michael Dell said in his internal memo to employees."
