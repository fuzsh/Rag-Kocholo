        "text": "HOPKINTON, Mass. - February 21, 2008 -\n\nHOPKINTON, Mass., and SEATTLE, Wash. – Feb. 21, 2008 – EMC Corporation, the world leader in information infrastructure solutions, today announced it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Seattle-based Pi Corporation, a privately-held developer of software and provider of services for personal information management. With approximately 100 engineers located in the U.S., Canada and India, Pi develops software and online services to enable individuals to control how they find, access, share and protect their increasing volumes of digital information. Pi is in the process of beta testing its first products.\n\nJoe Tucci, EMC President, Chairman and CEO, said, “The proliferation of information in the hands of consumers, businesses and organizations of all sizes has brought about massive digital information growth on a scale never imagined. As the leading provider of information infrastructure, we are positioned to set a new standard for organizing, accessing and deriving value from this information. Pi’s technology is very complementary to our emerging cloud infrastructure strategy. Paul Maritz and his team will provide invaluable vision and leadership as we position EMC at the leading edge of cloud computing and personal information management.”"
