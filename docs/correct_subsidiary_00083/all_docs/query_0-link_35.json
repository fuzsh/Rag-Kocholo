The company says that this amount of digital information is expected to grow by almost 60% each year.\n\nAs the amount of data grows that is trapped under beds and in filing boxes, there’s a need to be able to store some of it in the cloud, so individuals can trust someone else to preserve it for them.\n\nMozy, which was acquired by EMC in October 2007 and Pi founded by Paul Maritz formerly of Microsoft, will be headquartered in Seattle. The company is actively recruiting a CEO.\n\nDecho claims that 900,000 users and 25,000 business organizations are swimmingly using Mozy to protect over 10PB of data."
