        "text": "Snuko PLC / Key word(s): Miscellaneous 20.10.2010 10:00 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Snuko, the leading provider of software to 'protect your stuff', is integrating solutions from MozyTM, the world's most trusted provider of online backup solutions, to offer premium protection for both hardware and data. Snuko selected Mozy based on its position as one of the largest providers of online backup solutions in the world with over one million customers and 25 petabytes of user information in its secure data centres around the globe. Snuko's innovative Anti-Theft solution already provides three key services to ensure that, if a mobile device, such as a laptop or notebook, is stolen the impact on its owner is minimised: * Lockdown - the device is secured, preventing the thief from using any functionality other than an application to report that it has been found. * Tracking - Snuko uses wireless communication from the device to pinpoint its location. * Identification - Snuko Anti-Theft not only records everything that the thief tries to do with the laptop, it also uses the webcam to film them in action. Snuko will now be introducing secure, automated online backup - powered by Mozy - into its feature set. This will allow it not only to prevent a thief from accessing data in the event that a device is stolen, but also to ensure that the user does not lose access to that data by backing it up to remote servers. Adding Mozy's technology to the service will give Snuko customers a simple method to continue accessing their work files, personal folders and irreplaceable documents such as wedding or baby photos. 'Losing a laptop can be an expensive business,' said Simon Kingston of Mozy. 'But it's often only once it's lost that a person realises they valued more than just the hardware. The documents on a laptop might be the lifeblood of the company for business users - or the hundreds of digital photos and videos of huge sentimental value to a personal user. You can't put a price on keeping that safe.' The agreement between Snuko and Mozy will see the Mozy technology embedded within the Snuko application. 'People are carrying more and more devices, with more and more data on them,' said Carlos. H. Benvenuti, CEO of Snuko plc. 'This means that they need increasingly sophisticated solutions to protect them. The success of Snuko has shown that people no longer think that protection starts and ends with insurance to allow them to buy a new device. Today, it's about making sure that your documents, pictures and passwords aren't getting into the hands of thieves, and that you can get this information back. That's why we're adding even more functionality to Snuko through our relationship with Mozy.' Snuko believes that the additional functionality that Mozy will bring to its Anti-Theft solution will further add to the appeal of the product in business markets. Snuko plans to launch its enhanced offering in autumn 2010.
