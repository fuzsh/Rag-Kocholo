        "text": "SEATTLE, Feb. 18, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Mozy™, the industry-leading online backup service from EMC Corporation (NYSE: EMC), today announced the launch of MozyConnect™, a fully integrated backup service that simplifies the disaster recovery and business continuity plans of small businesses through a cost-effective hybrid approach. Mozy also today announced that it is teaming with Cisco and Iomega (an EMC company), the first two companies to include MozyPro® in their respective storage offerings. For more information please visit http://cisco.mozy.com/\n\nAs the need for simplified business disaster preparedness continually rises, small businesses are turning in increasing numbers to safe, cost-effective backup and storage solutions. Steadily gaining in popularity is the 'hybrid' approach, in which local and online backup are combined. This approach reduces the complex overhead and excessive administrative costs traditionally required by tape-based backup. It combines the best of both worlds – the closeness of network-attached storage (NAS) onsite backup, with all the cost advantages and peace of mind of having one's data also backed up in the cloud.\n\nMozyConnect provides this hybrid approach by integrating MozyPro® with one of several NAS vendors to simplify a company's data protection stack. With two layers of redundant data protection, both local and online, SMBs can focus more on their business and worry less about data backup. MozyConnect integrated with Cisco NSS300 Series Smart Storage, as well as with Iomega® StorCenter™ desktop and rackmount network storage devices, gives customers a fully integrated solution for backing up their critical business data locally on the device and online in Mozy's secure datacenters.\n\n\"As we continue to protect more and more businesses with MozyPro, we have heard the growing need to offer this hybrid approach,\" said Russ Stockdale, Vice President of Product Management for Mozy. \"We're excited that Cisco and Iomega are the first two network-attached storage providers to work with us to fill this need, and we look forward to adding more vendors to our MozyConnect service in the future.\"\n\nAvailability\n\nMozyConnect for Cisco Smart Storage is available now via Mozy direct sales and through Mozy resellers, as well as all Cisco partners.\n\nMozyConnect for Iomega StorCenter Network Storage products is scheduled for availability in the spring of 2011.\n\nAbout Mozy\n\nMozy is the world's most trusted online backup service for consumers and small businesses with more than one million customers, 70,000 business users and 75 petabytes of information stored at its multiple data centers around the globe. Mozy was acquired by EMC Corporation in 2007 and is now operated as part of Decho Corporation, an EMC company.
