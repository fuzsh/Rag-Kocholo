        "text": "EMC Corporation has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Seattle-based Pi Corporation, a\n\nprivately-held developer of software and provider of services for personal\n\ninformation management. With approximately 100 engineers located in the U.S.,\n\nCanada and India, Pi develops software and online services to enable\n\nindividuals to control how they find, access, share and protect their\n\nincreasing volumes of digital information. Pi is in the process of beta\n\ntesting its first products.\n\nJoe Tucci, EMC President, Chairman and CEO, said, \"The proliferation of\n\ninformation in the hands of consumers, businesses and organizations of all\n\nsizes has brought about massive digital information growth on a scale never\n\nimagined. As the leading provider of information infrastructure, we are\n\npositioned to set a new standard for organizing, accessing and deriving value\n\nfrom this information. Pi’s technology is very complementary to our emerging\n\ncloud infrastructure strategy. Paul Maritz and his team will provide\n\ninvaluable vision and leadership as we position EMC at the leading edge of\n\ncloud computing and personal information management.\"\n\nUpon completion of the acquisition, Pi founder and CEO Paul Maritz, will\n\njoin EMC’s executive management team as President and General Manager of the\n\nnewly formed Cloud Infrastructure and Services Division. Reporting to Joe\n\nTucci, Maritz will continue to directly oversee development and operations for\n\nPi, along with other key elements of EMC’s cloud computing strategy, which\n\ninclude the EMC Fortress SaaS infrastructure, the Mozy online backup service\n\nand other upcoming EMC cloud infrastructure systems and software offerings\n\nunder development. Pi will operate as an independent subsidiary of EMC and\n\nwill continue expanding operations in its Seattle headquarters and other\n\noffices in Montreal, Canada, and Bangalore, India. Prior to founding Pi,\n\nMaritz spent 14 years working at Microsoft where he had broad development and\n\nmarketing responsibilities and was a member of the Executive Committee that\n\nmanaged the overall company.\n\nMaritz said, \"By uniting the Pi team with a global technology leader like\n\nEMC, we’ll be ideally positioned to realize our vision of allowing consumers\n\nand corporate information workers to create, re-purpose, store, share and\n\naccess personal information in novel ways, taking advantage of the ubiquity of\n\ncomputing power and a new interconnected world.\"\n\nThe acquisition of Pi will be an all-cash transaction and is expected to\n\nbe completed in the first quarter of 2008. On a GAAP basis, EMC currently\n\nexpects the acquisition of Pi will be dilutive by $.01 per diluted share in\n\n2008. No further details of the transaction are being disclosed.\n\nEMC Corporation"
