        "text": "EMC Corp., the world’s biggest maker of storage computers, has acquired closely held Berkeley Data Systems Inc., helping it expand into online sales of data backup and recovery.\n\nBerkeley Data, known by its Mozy brand name, will operate as a stand-alone business within EMC’s venture group. The acquisition won’t have a material effect on EMC’s profit or revenue this year, the Hopkinton-based company said yesterday. Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.\n\nBerkeley, based in American Fork, Utah, near Salt Lake City, offers data protection for laptops, desktops and office servers, mostly to consumers and small businesses. More than 300,000 people and 8,500 companies, including General Electric Co., have subscribed to the online service since it started in 2005.\n\n“Their online business gets us into a new delivery model,” said Michael Gallant, an EMC spokesman. “It also gets us a new group of customers. Small business and individual customers represent a new market opportunity.”\n\nMost business users of Mozy products are small and mid-sized companies, including five-person accounting firms, law firms, coffee shops, bakeries and construction firms.\n\nIn addition to reaching more small companies, EMC plans to use Berkeley’s technology in its work with large businesses, Gallant said. Berkeley won GE as a customer six months ago, after a GE executive, a Mozy home user, asked Berkeley to provide a similar service for GE’s 350,000 desktop computers worldwide.\n\n“Mozy represented a triple threat: the consumer business, the small business and the enterprise business,” said Bob Laliberte, an analyst with Milford-based Enterprise Strategy Group. “EMC can leverage Mozy technology to go to a lot of other enterprises much faster than Berkeley, a two-year-old startup. EMC’s pedigree gives them credibility.”\n\nMozy sells backup services for about $5 a month. It also offers a free service that will back up two gigabytes of data. A technology breakthrough allowed the company to sell Mozy for less than competing products, said Josh Coates, Berkeley’s founder.\n\n“Backup and recovery services were complicated and expensive,” he said. “We’ve cut through that.”\n\nBerkeley’s software is not patented, said Coates, 33, who has a computer science degree from the University of California, Berkeley. Instead, the technology is protected as a trade secret, he said.\n\nEMC shares fell 8 cents to $21.05 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has risen 59 percent this year."
