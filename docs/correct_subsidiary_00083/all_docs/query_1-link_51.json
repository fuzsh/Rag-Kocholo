We refer to our fiscal years ended February 2, 2018, February 3, 2017, and January 29, 2016 as \"Fiscal 2018,\" \"Fiscal 2017,\" and \"Fiscal 2016,\" respectively. Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2016 included 52 weeks. Fiscal 2017 included 53 weeks, with the extra week included in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017.\n\nPART I\n\nITEM 1 — BUSINESS\n\nBusiness\n\nDell Technologies is a strategically aligned family of businesses, poised to become the essential infrastructure company, from the edge to the core to the cloud, as we continue our mission to advance human progress through technology. We seek to accomplish this by executing two, related, high-level strategic initiatives: helping our customers transform their businesses through digital, IT, workforce, and security transformation, while extending our many leading market positions in client solutions and IT infrastructure.\n\nDell Technologies brings together the entire infrastructure from hardware to software to services. The core of IT is evolving in our hyper-connected world, containing both centralized data centers and geographically distributed hyper-converged infrastructure. Dell Technologies is a leader in the traditional technology of today and a leader in the cloud-native infrastructure of tomorrow. Through our recent combination with EMC, Dell Technologies offers next-generation solutions through our Client Solutions Group, Infrastructure Solutions Group, VMware, Inc. (NYSE: VMW), RSA Information Security (\"RSA\"), SecureWorks Corp. (\"SecureWorks\"), Pivotal Software, Inc. (\"Pivotal\"), Boomi, Inc. (\"Boomi\"), and Virtustream, Inc. (\"Virtustream\"). Our solutions enable digital transformation and encompass software-defined data centers, all-flash arrays, hybrid cloud, converged and hyper-converged infrastructure, cloud-native software application development tools, mobile, and security solutions. In addition, we provide important value differentiators through our extended warranty and delivery offerings, and software and peripherals, which are closely tied to the sale of our hardware products.\n\nDell Technologies is committed to its customers. As we innovate to make our customers' existing IT increasingly productive, we help them reinvest their savings into the next generation of technologies that they need to succeed in the digital economy. We are positioned to help customers of any size and are differentiated by our practical innovation and efficient, simple, and affordable solutions.\n\nDuring Fiscal 2018, we celebrated the one year anniversary of our historic merger with EMC, and recognize the many accomplishments we have made since the merger. These accomplishments include the broad expansion of our product portfolio, integration of our supply chain, and achievement of revenue synergies across the business. With these accomplishments, we believe we are well-positioned for long-term sustainable growth and innovation. As we continue our integration of the EMC acquired businesses, we remain committed to our customers, supporting them with outstanding solutions, products, and services. We will continue our focus on building superior customer relationships through our direct model and our network of channel partners, which includes value-added resellers, system integrators, distributors, and retailers. We also will continue to balance our efforts to drive cost efficiencies in the business with strategic investments in areas that will enable growth, such as our sales force, marketing, and research and development, as we seek to strengthen our position as a leading global technology company poised for long-term sustainable growth and innovation.\n\nProducts and Services\n\nWe design, develop, manufacture, market, sell, and support a wide range of products and services. We are organized into the following business units, which are our reportable segments: Client Solutions Group; Infrastructure Solutions Group; and VMware.\n\n• Client Solutions Group (\"CSG\") — Offerings by CSG include branded hardware, such as personal computers (\"PCs\"), notebooks, and branded peripherals, such as monitors and projectors, as well as third-party software and peripherals.\n\n5\n\nDocument\n\n5\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOur computing devices are designed with our commercial and consumer customers' needs in mind, and we seek to optimize performance, reliability, manageability, design, and security. In addition to our traditional PC business, we also have a portfolio of thin client offerings that is well-positioned to benefit from the growth trends in cloud computing. CSG hardware and services also provide the architecture to enable the Internet of Things and connected ecosystems to securely and efficiently capture massive amounts of data for analytics and actionable insights for commercial customers. CSG also offers attached software, peripherals, and services, including support and deployment, configuration, and extended warranty services.\n\nApproximately 50% of CSG revenue is generated by sales to customers in the Americas, with the remaining portion derived from sales to customers in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (\"EMEA\") and in Asia Pacific and Japan (\"APJ\").\n\n•\n\nInfrastructure Solutions Group (\"ISG\") — EMC's Information Storage segment and our existing Enterprise Solutions Group were combined in Fiscal 2017 to create the Infrastructure Solutions Group. ISG enables the digital transformation of our enterprise customers through our trusted cloud and big data solutions, which are built upon a modern data center infrastructure. The comprehensive portfolio of advanced storage solutions includes traditional storage solutions as well as next-generation storage solutions (including all-flash arrays, scale-out file, object platforms, and software-defined solutions). The server portfolio includes high-performance rack, blade, tower, and hyperscale servers. The networking portfolio helps our business customers transform and modernize their infrastructure, mobilize and enrich end-user experiences, and accelerate business applications and processes. Strengths in core server and storage solutions enable us to offer leading converged and hyper-converged solutions, which allow our customers to accelerate their IT transformation by acquiring scalable integrated IT solutions instead of building and assembling their own IT platforms. ISG also offers attached software, peripherals, and services, including support and deployment, configuration, and extended warranty services.\n\nISG includes Virtustream product and service offerings. Virtustream's cloud software and infrastructure-as-a-service solutions enable customers to migrate, run, and manage mission-critical applications in cloud-based IT environments, and represent a key element of our strategy to help customers support their applications in a variety of cloud native environments. Beginning in the first quarter of Fiscal 2019, we will no longer manage Virtustream within ISG and, as such, will report Virtustream results within other businesses, rather than within ISG. This change in reporting structure will not impact our previously reported consolidated financial results, but our prior period segment results will be recast to reflect the change.\n\nApproximately 50% of ISG revenue is generated by sales to customers in the Americas, with the remaining portion derived from sales to customers in EMEA and APJ.\n\n• VMware — The VMware reportable segment (\"VMware\") reflects the operations of VMware, Inc. (NYSE: VMW) within Dell Technologies. See Exhibit 99.1 filed with this report for further details on the differences between VMware reportable segment results and VMware, Inc. results.\n\nVMware provides compute, cloud, mobility, networking and security infrastructure software to businesses that provides a flexible digital foundation for the applications that empower businesses to serve their customers globally. VMware has continued to broaden its product and solution offerings beyond compute virtualization to include offerings that allow organizations to manage IT resources across private clouds and complex multi-cloud, multi-device environments by leveraging synergies across three categories: software-defined data center; hybrid cloud computing; and end-user computing. VMware's software-defined data center includes the fundamental compute layer for the data center (vSphere); storage and availability to offer cost-effective holistic data storage and protection options (vSAN); network and security (VMware NSX); and cloud management and automation (vRealize) products. VMware currently enables its customers to run, manage, connect, and secure applications across private and public clouds (VMware Cloud). During Fiscal 2018, VMware entered into a strategic alliance with Amazon Web Services (\"AWS\") to offer an integrated hybrid offering, VMware Cloud on AWS. VMware Cloud on AWS enables customers to run applications across vSphere-based private, public, and hybrid cloud environments. VMware's end-user computing offerings (such as Workspace ONE) enable IT organizations to enhance enterprise security for corporate applications, data, and endpoints for their end users by leveraging VMware's software-defined data center solutions to extend the value of virtualization and management from data centers to devices.\n\nApproximately 50% of VMware revenue is generated by sales to customers in the United States.\n\n6\n\nDocument\n\n6\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOur other businesses, described below, consist of product and service offerings of RSA, SecureWorks, Pivotal, and Boomi. These businesses are not classified as reportable segments, either individually or collectively, as the results of the businesses are not material to our overall results and the businesses do not meet the criteria for reportable segments.\n\n• RSA provides essential cybersecurity solutions engineered to enable organizations to detect, investigate, and respond to advanced attacks, confirm and manage identities, and, ultimately, help reduce IP theft, fraud, and cybercrime.\n\n• SecureWorks (NASDAQ: SCWX) is a leading global provider of intelligence-driven information security solutions singularly focused on protecting its clients from cyber attacks.\n\n•\n\nPivotal provides a leading cloud-native platform that makes software development and IT operations a strategic advantage for customers. Pivotal's cloud-native platform, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, accelerates and streamlines software development by reducing the complexity of building, deploying and operating new cloud-native applications and modernizing legacy applications. On March 23, 2018, in preparation for an initial public offering of Pivotal's Class A common stock, Pivotal filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC. No public market currently exists for Pivotal's Class A common stock.\n\n• Boomi specializes in cloud-based integration, connecting information between existing on-premise and cloud-based applications to ensure business processes are optimized, data is accurate, and workflow is reliable.\n\nSee Note 22 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for more information about our other businesses.\n\nFor further discussion regarding our current reportable segments, see \"Part II — Item 7 —Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Business Unit Results.\"\n\nDell Financial Services\n\nWe also offer or arrange various financing options and services for our customers in North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand through Dell Financial Services and its affiliates (\"DFS\"). DFS services include originating, collecting, and servicing customer receivables primarily related to the purchase of Dell Technologies products and services. The results of these operations are allocated to our segments based on the underlying product or service financed. For additional information about our financing arrangements, see Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.\n\nResearch and Development\n\nWe focus on developing scalable technology solutions that incorporate highly desirable features and capabilities at competitive prices. We employ a collaborative approach to product design and development in which our engineers, with direct customer input, design innovative solutions and work with a global network of technology companies to architect new system designs, influence the direction of future development, and integrate new technologies into our products. We manage our research and development (\"R&D\") spending by targeting those innovations and products that we believe are most valuable to our customers and by relying on the capabilities of our strategic relationships. Through this collaborative, customer-focused approach, we strive to deliver new and relevant products to the market quickly and efficiently. Additionally, from time to time, we make strategic investments in publicly-traded and privately-held companies that develop software, hardware, and other technologies or provide services supporting our technologies.\n\nVMware represents a significant portion of our R&D activities and has assembled an experienced group of developers with systems management, public and private cloud, desktop, digital mobility, security, applications, software-as-a-service, networking, storage, and open source software expertise. VMware also has strong ties to leading academic institutions around the world, and invests in joint research with academia. Product development efforts are prioritized through a combination of engineering-driven innovation and customer- and market-driven feedback.\n\nDell Technologies has a global R&D presence, with total R&D expenses of $4.4 billion, $2.6 billion, and $1.1 billion for Fiscal 2018, Fiscal 2017, and Fiscal 2016, respectively. These investments reflect our commitment to R&D activities that ultimately support our mission: to help our customers build their digital future and to transform IT.\n\n7\n\nDocument\n\n7\n\nTable of Contents\n\nManufacturing and Materials\n\nWe own manufacturing facilities located in the United States, Malaysia, China, Brazil, India, Poland, and Ireland. See \"Item 2 — Properties\" for information about our manufacturing and distribution facilities. We also utilize contract manufacturers throughout the world to manufacture or assemble our products under the Dell Technologies brand as part of our strategy to enhance our variable cost structure and to achieve our goals of generating cost efficiencies, delivering products faster, better serving our customers, and building a world-class supply chain. Our manufacturing process consists of assembly, software installation, functional testing, and quality control. We conduct operations utilizing a formal, documented quality management system to ensure that our products and services satisfy customer needs and expectations. Testing and quality control are also applied to components, parts, sub-assemblies, and systems obtained from third-party suppliers. Our quality management system is maintained through the testing of components, sub-assemblies, software, and systems at various stages in the manufacturing process. Quality control procedures also include a burn-in period for completed units after assembly, ongoing production reliability audits, failure tracking for early identification of production and component problems, and information from customers obtained through services and support programs. This system is certified to the ISO 9001 International Standard that includes most of our global sites that design, manufacture, and service our products. Our order fulfillment, manufacturing, and test facilities in Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Ireland are certified to the ISO 14001 International Standard for environmental management systems and also have achieved OHSAS 18001 certification, an international standard for facilities with world-class safety and health management systems. These internationally-recognized endorsements of ongoing quality and environmental management are among the highest levels of certifications available. We also have implemented Lean Six Sigma methodologies to ensure that the quality of our designs, manufacturing, test processes, and supplier relationships are continually improved. We maintain a robust Supplier Code of Conduct, actively manage recycling processes for our returned products, and are certified by the Environmental Protection Agency as a Smartway Transport Partner.\n\nWe purchase materials, supplies, product components, and products from a large number of qualified suppliers. In some cases, where multiple sources of supply are not available, we rely on single-source or a limited number of sources of supply if we believe it is advantageous to do so because of performance, quality, support, delivery, capacity, or price considerations. We believe that any disruption that may occur because of our dependence on single- or limited-source vendors would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors. See \"Item 1A — Risk Factors — Risk Factors Relating to Our Business — Reliance on vendors for products and components, many of which are single-source or limited-source suppliers, could harm Dell Technologies' business by adversely affecting product availability, delivery, reliability, and cost\" for information about the risks associated with Dell Technologies' use of single- or limited-source suppliers.\n\nGeographic Operations\n\nOur global corporate headquarters is located in Round Rock, Texas. We have operations and conduct business in many countries located in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and other geographic regions. To increase our global presence, we continue to focus on emerging markets outside of the United States, Western Europe, Canada, and Japan. We continue to view these geographical markets, which include the vast majority of the world's population, as a long-term growth opportunity. Accordingly, we pursue the development of technology solutions that meet the needs of these markets. Our expansion in emerging markets creates additional complexity in coordinating the design, development, procurement, manufacturing, distribution, and support of our product and services offerings. For information about the amount of net revenue we generated from our operations outside of the United States during the last three fiscal years, see Note 22 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.\n\n8\n\nDocument\n\n8\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCompetition\n\nWe operate in an industry in which there are rapid technological advances in hardware, software, and services offerings. We face ongoing product and price competition in all areas of our business, including from both branded and generic competitors. We compete based on our ability to offer customers competitive, scalable, and integrated solutions that provide the most current and desired product and services features at a competitive price. We closely monitor market pricing and solutions trends, including the effect of foreign exchange rate movements, in an effort to provide the best value for our customers. We believe that our strong relationships with our customers and channel partners allow us to respond quickly to changing customer needs and other macroeconomic factors.\n\nThe markets in which we compete are highly competitive and are comprised of large and small companies across all areas of our business. We believe that new businesses will continue to enter these markets and develop technologies that, if commercialized, may compete with our products and services. Moreover, current competitors may enter into new strategic relationships with new or existing competitors, which may further increase the competitive pressures. See \"Item 1A — Risk Factors\" for information about our competitive risks.\n\nSales and Marketing\n\nWe operate a diversified business model with the majority of our revenue and operating income derived from commercial clients that consist of large enterprises, small and medium-sized businesses, and public sector customers. We sell products and services directly to customers and through other sales channels, such as value-added resellers, system integrators, distributors, and retailers. During Fiscal 2018, our other sales channels contributed approximately 50% of our net revenue.\n\nOur customers include large global and national corporate businesses, public institutions that include government, educational institutions, healthcare organizations, and law enforcement agencies, small and medium-sized businesses, and consumers. Our sales efforts are organized around the evolving needs of our customers, and our marketing initiatives reflect this focus. We believe that our unified global sales and marketing team creates a sales organization that is more customer-focused, collaborative, and innovative. Our go-to-market strategy includes a direct business model, as well as channel distribution. Our direct business model emphasizes direct communication with customers, thereby allowing us to refine our products and marketing programs for specific customers groups, and we continue to pursue this strategy. In addition to our direct business model, we rely on a network of channel partners to sell our products and services, enabling us to efficiently serve a greater number of customers.\n\nWe market our products and services to small and medium-sized businesses and consumers through various advertising media. To react quickly to our customers' needs, we track our Net Promoter Score, a customer loyalty metric that is widely used across various industries. Increasingly, we also engage with customers through our social media communities on www.delltechnologies.com and in external social media channels.\n\nFor large business and institutional customers, we maintain a field sales force throughout the world. Dedicated account teams, which include technical sales specialists, form long-term relationships to provide our largest customers with a single source of assistance, develop tailored solutions for these customers, position the capabilities of Dell Technologies, and provide us with customer feedback. For these customers, we offer several programs designed to provide single points of contact and accountability with dedicated account managers, special pricing, and consistent service and support programs. We also maintain specific sales and marketing programs targeting federal, state, and local governmental agencies, as well as healthcare and educational customers.\n\nPatents, Trademarks, and Licenses\n\nAs of February 2, 2018, we held a worldwide portfolio of 16,563 patents and had an additional 11,774 patent applications pending. Of those amounts, VMware, Inc. owned 2,183 patents and had an additional 2,763 patent applications pending. We also hold licenses to use numerous third-party patents. To replace expiring patents, we obtain new patents through our ongoing research and development activities. The inventions claimed in our patents and patent applications cover aspects of our current and possible future computer system products, manufacturing processes, and related technologies. Our product, business method, and manufacturing process patents may establish barriers to entry in many product lines. Although we use our patented inventions and also license them to others, we are not substantially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents. We have entered into a variety of intellectual property licensing and cross-licensing agreements and software licensing agreements with other companies. We anticipate that our worldwide patent portfolio will continue to be of value in negotiating intellectual property rights with others in the industry.\n\n9\n\nDocument\n\n9\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe have obtained U.S. federal trademark registration for the Dell word mark and logo mark and the VMware word and logo mark. We have pending applications to register Dell EMC word marks. As of February 2, 2018, we owned registrations for 336 of our other trademarks in the United States and had pending applications for registration of 64 other trademarks. We believe that the DELL, Dell EMC, and VMware word marks and logo marks in the United States are material to our operations. As of February 2, 2018, we also had applied for, or obtained registration of, the DELL word mark and several other marks in approximately 184 other countries.\n\nFrom time to time, other companies and individuals assert exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights to technologies or marks that are alleged to be relevant to the technology industry or our business. We evaluate each claim relating to our products and, if appropriate, seek a license to use the protected technology. The licensing agreements generally do not require the licensor to assist us in duplicating the licensor's patented technology, nor do the agreements protect us from trade secret, copyright, or other violations by us or our suppliers in developing or selling the licensed products. Unless otherwise noted, trademarks appearing in this report are owned by us. We disclaim proprietary interest in the marks and names of others. Net Promoter Score is a trademark of Satmetrix Systems, Inc., Bain & Company, Inc., and Fred Reichheld.\n\nGovernment Regulation and Sustainability\n\nGovernment Regulation — Our business is subject to regulation by various U.S. federal and state governmental agencies and other governmental agencies. Such regulation includes the activities of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission; the anti-trust regulatory activities of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the European Union; the consumer protection laws and financial services regulation of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and various state governmental agencies; the export regulatory activities of the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Department of the Treasury; the import regulatory activities of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection; the product safety regulatory activities of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and the U.S. Department of Transportation; the health information privacy and security requirements of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; and the environmental, employment and labor, and other regulatory activities of a variety of governmental authorities in each of the countries in which we conduct business. We were not assessed any material environmental fines, nor did we have any material environmental remediation or other environmental costs, during Fiscal 2018.\n\nOur Philosophy on Sustainability: Building a Legacy of Good — One of the core tenets of Dell Technologies is the belief that technology should drive human progress. We remain committed to putting our technology and expertise to work where it can do the most good for people and our planet. This commitment is intimately tied to our business goals of driving growth, helping mitigate risk, and ensuring business opportunities by building our brand. Based on the idea that we all win when we create shared value, we created the Legacy of Good plan to build on the strengths throughout our value chain to create social, environmental, and economic value by uniting our purpose with our business objectives. The plan features 22 bold goals for the year 2020 across the material areas of our business, ultimately setting the agenda for building a better future where everyone can reach their full potential while sharing in and supporting the common good.\n\nThe following are key areas of focus in our Legacy of Good plan:\n\nCreating Net Positive Outcomes — Creating net positive outcomes means putting back more into society, the environment, and the global economy than we take out. In particular, we focus on helping customers harness the power of technology to deliver better social and environmental outcomes.\n\nEnergy Efficiency — We have set a goal to reduce the energy intensity of our entire product portfolio by 80% by 2020.\n\nTechnology Take-back, Reuse, and Recycling — We begin thinking about recycling at the design phase, asking our product engineers to work with recyclers to understand how to make products easy to repair or disassemble for recycling. When our products reach the end of their life cycles, we make it easy for customers to recycle their obsolete electronic equipment.\n\nCircular Economy and Design for the Environment — Recycling, reuse, and closed-loop manufacturing form the bedrock of the circular economy, ensuring that materials already in circulation stay in the economy instead of exiting as waste. Within our own operations, we look at how materials can be used, or reused, in ways that extend their value.\n\nReducing Our Footprint, Caring for Our Planet — We are focused on reducing the impact of our operations on the environment. Our teams examine practices and processes throughout our facilities to identify other opportunities for greater\n\n10\n\nDocument\n\n10\n\nTable of Contents\n\nefficiency. Many of our locations purchase some or all of their electricity from renewable sources and many of our manufacturing facilities are approaching zero waste to landfill.\n\nFurther, Dell is committed to maintaining the vitality of our oceans with our work concerning ocean-bound plastics used in our supply chain. We have made a pledge to the United Nations to increase our annual use of ocean plastics by 10 times by 2025 and to help build further demand by convening a working group with other manufacturers to create an open-source ocean plastics supply chain. To that end, during Fiscal 2018, we partnered to bring together a cross-industry consortium of global companies that also are committed to scaling the use of ocean-bound plastics.\n\nSocial and Environmental Responsibility (\"SER\") in the Supply Chain — We are committed to responsible business practices and hold ourselves and our suppliers to a high standard of excellence. We work in partnership with our suppliers to reduce risks that could lead to harm of workers, production suspensions, factory shut-downs, or environmental damage. All of our suppliers must agree to our global supplier principles and accept the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition Code of Conduct. Additionally, we are committed to a conflict-free mineral supply chain.\n\nYouth Learning — Technology skills are critical to continued innovation and can have a profound effect on our businesses, communities, and sustainability. We have a strong commitment to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (\"STEM\") and other youth learning activities, providing funding, volunteer time, and technology to underserved populations.\n\nPartnering with TGen on Technology for Good — Together with the Translational Genomics Research Institute (\"TGen\"), we are changing the paradigm in the treatment of childhood cancers. We developed the Genomic Data Analysis Platform — a complete high-performance computing infrastructure solution uniquely designed to meet the needs of genomic data collection and analysis. Over the past six years, we have increased computational capacity over three times, and increased storage speeds and capacity to over four times that of the original systems, thereby reducing the time it takes to sequence a genome from multiple weeks to just six hours.\n\nThe Fiscal 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report is available at www.dell.com/crreport, and the Fiscal 2018 report is expected to be available in June 2018. The VMware Fiscal 2017 Global Impact Report is available at www.vmware.com/company/sustainability, and the Fiscal 2018 report is expected to be available in September 2018.\n\nProduct Backlog\n\nWe believe that product backlog is not a meaningful indicator of net revenue that can be expected for any period. Our business model generally gives us flexibility to manage product backlog at any point in time by expediting shipping or prioritizing customer orders toward products that have shorter lead times, thereby reducing product backlog and increasing current period revenue. Moreover, product backlog at any point in time may not result in the generation of any predictable amount of net revenue in any subsequent period, as unfilled orders can generally be canceled at any time by the customer. Product backlog at any point in time may not result in the generation of any predictable amount of net revenue in any subsequent period.\n\nEmployees\n\nAt the end of Fiscal 2018, we had approximately 145,000 total full-time employees, approximately 22,000 of whom were employees of VMware, Inc. In comparison, at the end of Fiscal 2017, we had approximately 138,000 total full-time employees, approximately 20,000 of whom were employees of VMware, Inc. At the end of Fiscal 2018, approximately 39% of our full-time employees were located in the United States and approximately 61% were located in other countries.\n\nCorporate Information\n\nWe are a holding company that conducts our operations through subsidiaries.\n\nWe were incorporated in the state of Delaware on January 31, 2013 under the name Denali Holding Inc. in connection with Dell's going-private transaction, which was completed in October 2013. We changed our name to Dell Technologies Inc. on August 25, 2016. The mailing address of our principal executive offices is One Dell Way, Round Rock, Texas 78682. Our telephone number is 1-800-289-3355.\n\n11\n\nDocument\n\n11\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOur website address is www.delltechnologies.com.

The following is a description of some of the important risk factors that may cause our actual results in future periods to differ substantially from those we currently expect or seek. The risks described below are not the only risks facing us. There are additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial that also may materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, or prospects.\n\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Business\n\nCompetitive pressures may adversely affect Dell Technologies' industry unit share position, revenue, and profitability. Dell Technologies operates in an industry in which there are rapid technological advances in hardware, software, and services offerings. As a result, Dell Technologies faces aggressive product and price competition from both branded and generic competitors. Dell Technologies competes based on its ability to offer to its customers competitive integrated solutions that provide the most current and desired product and services features. There is a risk that Dell Technologies' competitors may provide products that are less costly, perform better or include additional features that are not available with Dell Technologies' products. There also is a risk that Dell Technologies' product portfolios may quickly become outdated or that Dell Technologies' market share may quickly erode. Further, efforts to balance the mix of products and services in order to optimize profitability, liquidity, and growth may put pressure on Dell Technologies' industry position. As the technology industry continues to expand globally, there may be new and increased competition in different geographic regions. The generally low barriers to entry in the technology industry increase the potential for challenges from new industry competitors. There also may be increased competition from new types of products as the options for mobile and cloud computing solutions increase. In addition, companies with which Dell Technologies has strategic alliances may become competitors in other product areas or current competitors may enter into new strategic relationships with new or existing competitors, all of which may further increase the competitive pressures on Dell Technologies. Reliance on vendors for products and components, many of which are single-source or limited-source suppliers, could harm Dell Technologies' business by adversely affecting product availability, delivery, reliability, and cost. Dell Technologies maintains several single-source or limited-source supplier relationships, including relationships with third-party software providers, either because multiple sources are not readily available or because the relationships are advantageous due to performance, quality, support, delivery, capacity, or price considerations. A delay in the supply of a critical single- or limited-source product or component may prevent the timely shipment of the related product in desired quantities or configurations. In addition, Dell Technologies may not be able to replace the functionality provided by third-party software currently offered with its products if that software becomes obsolete, defective, or incompatible with future product versions or is not adequately maintained or updated. Even where multiple sources of supply are available, qualification of the alternative suppliers and establishment of reliable supplies could result in delays and a possible loss of sales, which could harm Dell Technologies' operating results. Dell Technologies obtains many of its products and all of its components from third-party vendors, many of which are located outside of the United States. In addition, significant portions of Dell Technologies' products are assembled by contract manufacturers, primarily in various locations in Asia. A significant concentration of such outsourced manufacturing is currently performed by only a few of Dell Technologies' contract manufacturers, often in single locations. Dell Technologies sells components to these contract manufacturers and generates large non-trade accounts receivables, an arrangement that would present a risk of uncollectibility if the financial condition of a contract manufacturer should deteriorate. Although these relationships generate cost efficiencies, they limit Dell Technologies' direct control over production. The increasing reliance on vendors subjects Dell Technologies to a greater risk of shortages and reduced control over delivery schedules of components and products, as well as a greater risk of increases in product and component costs. Because Dell Technologies maintains minimal levels of component and product inventories, a disruption in component or product availability could harm Dell Technologies' ability to satisfy customer needs. In addition, defective parts and products from these vendors could reduce product reliability and harm Dell Technologies' reputation.\n\n16\n\nDocument\n\n16\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIf Dell Technologies fails to achieve favorable pricing from vendors, its profitability could be adversely affected. Dell Technologies' profitability is affected by its ability to achieve favorable pricing from vendors and contract manufacturers, including through negotiations for vendor rebates, marketing funds, and other vendor funding received in the normal course of business. Because these supplier negotiations are continuous and reflect the evolving competitive environment, the variability in timing and amount of incremental vendor discounts and rebates can affect Dell Technologies' profitability. The vendor programs may change periodically, potentially resulting in adverse profitability trends if Dell Technologies cannot adjust pricing or variable costs. An inability to establish a cost and product advantage, or determine alternative means to deliver value to customers, may adversely affect Dell Technologies' revenue and profitability. Adverse global economic conditions and instability in financial markets may harm Dell Technologies' business and result in reduced net revenue and profitability. As a global company with customers operating in a broad range of businesses and industries, Dell Technologies' performance is affected by global economic conditions. Adverse economic conditions may negatively affect customer demand for Dell Technologies' products and services. Such economic conditions could result in postponed or decreased spending amid customer concerns over unemployment, reduced asset values, volatile energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, and the stability and solvency of financial institutions, financial markets, businesses, local and state governments, and sovereign nations. Weak global economic conditions also could harm Dell Technologies' business by contributing to product shortages or delays, insolvency of key suppliers, customer and counterparty insolvencies, and increased challenges in managing Dell Technologies' treasury operations. Any such effects could have a negative impact on Dell Technologies' net revenue and profitability. Dell Technologies' results of operations may be adversely affected if it fails to successfully execute its growth strategy. Dell Technologies' growth strategy involves reaching more customers through direct sales, new distribution channels, expanding relationships with resellers, and augmenting select business areas through targeted acquisitions and other commercial arrangements. As more customers are reached through new distribution channels and expanded reseller relationships, Dell Technologies may fail to manage effectively the increasingly difficult tasks of inventory management and demand forecasting. The ability to implement this growth strategy depends on a successful transitioning of sales capabilities, the successful addition to the breadth of Dell Technologies' solutions capabilities through selective acquisitions of other businesses, and the effective management of the consequences of these strategic initiatives. If Dell Technologies is unable to meet these challenges, its results of operations could be adversely affected. Dell Technologies faces risks and challenges in connection with its transformation to an essential infrastructure solutions provider and its business strategy. Dell Technologies expects its strategic transformation to an essential infrastructure solutions provider to take more time and investment, and the investments it must make are likely to result in lower gross margins and raise its operating expenses and capital expenditures. For Fiscal 2018, Dell Technologies' Client Solutions business generated approximately 50% of Dell Technologies' net revenue, and largely relied on PC sales. Revenue from Client Solutions absorbs Dell Technologies' significant overhead costs and allows for scaled procurement. As a result, Client Solutions remains an important component in Dell Technologies' broad transformation strategy. While Dell Technologies continues to rely on Client Solutions as a critical element of its business, Dell Technologies also anticipates an increasingly challenging demand environment in Client Solutions and intensifying market competition. Current challenges in Client Solutions stem from fundamental changes in the PC market, including a decline in worldwide revenues for desktop and laptop PCs, and lower shipment forecasts for PC products due to a general lengthening of the replacement cycle for PC products and increasing interest in alternative mobile solutions. PC shipments worldwide declined during calendar year 2017, and further deterioration in the PC market may occur. Other challenges include declining margins as demand for PC products shifts from higher-margin premium products to lower-cost and lower-margin products, particularly in emerging markets, and significant and increasing competition from efficient and low-cost manufacturers and from manufacturers of innovative and higher-margin PC products. The challenges Dell Technologies faces in its transformation include low operating margins for the Infrastructure Solutions Group, referred to as ISG, and, although Client Solutions drives pull-through revenue and cross-selling of ISG solutions, the potential for further margin erosion remains due to intense competition, including emerging competitive pressure from cloud services. Improving the integration of Dell Technologies' product and service offerings as well as its ability to cross-sell remain\n\n17\n\nDocument\n\n17\n\nTable of Contents\n\na work in progress, as Dell Technologies is in the early stages of integrating its products into solutions and thus far has limited overlap in the base of large customers for the Client Solutions business and the ISG business. In addition, returns from Dell Technologies' prior acquisitions have been mixed and will require additional investments to reposition the business for growth, while cross-selling synergies have not been achieved as anticipated. As a result of the foregoing challenges, Dell Technologies' business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected. Dell Technologies may not successfully implement its acquisition strategy, which could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and increased costs. Dell Technologies makes strategic acquisitions of other companies as part of its growth strategy. Dell Technologies could experience unforeseen operating difficulties in assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, services, products, personnel, or operations of acquired companies, especially if Dell Technologies is unable to retain the key personnel of an acquired company. Further, future acquisitions may result in a delay or reduction of sales for both Dell Technologies and the acquired company because of customer uncertainty about the continuity and effectiveness of solutions offered by either company and may disrupt Dell Technologies' existing business by diverting resources and significant management attention that otherwise would be focused on development of the existing business. Acquisitions also may negatively affect Dell Technologies' relationships with strategic partners if the acquisitions are seen as bringing Dell Technologies into competition with such partners. To complete an acquisition, Dell Technologies may be required to use substantial amounts of cash, engage in equity or debt financings, or enter into credit agreements to secure additional funds. Such debt financings could involve restrictive covenants that might limit Dell Technologies' capital-raising activities and operating flexibility. Further, an acquisition may negatively affect Dell Technologies' results of operations because it may expose Dell Technologies to unexpected liabilities, require the incurrence of charges and substantial indebtedness or other liabilities, have adverse tax consequences, result in acquired in-process research and development expenses, or in the future require the amortization, write-down or impairment of amounts related to deferred compensation, goodwill, and other intangible assets, or fail to generate a financial return sufficient to offset acquisition costs. In addition, Dell Technologies periodically divests businesses, including businesses that are no longer a part of its strategic plan. These divestitures similarly require significant investment of time and resources, may disrupt Dell Technologies' business and distract management from other responsibilities, and may result in losses on disposition or continued financial involvement in the divested business, including through indemnification or other financial arrangements, for a period following the transaction, which could adversely affect Dell Technologies' financial results. If its cost efficiency measures are not successful, Dell Technologies may become less competitive. Dell Technologies continues to focus on minimizing operating expenses through cost improvements and simplification of its corporate structure. Certain factors may prevent the achievement of these goals, which may negatively affect Dell Technologies' competitive position. For example, Dell Technologies may experience delays or unanticipated costs in implementing its cost efficiency plans, which could prevent the timely or full achievement of expected cost efficiencies. Dell Technologies' inability to manage solutions and product and services transitions in an effective manner could reduce the demand for Dell Technologies' solutions, products, and services, and the profitability of Dell Technologies' operations. Continuing improvements in technology result in the frequent introduction of new solutions, products, and services, improvements in product performance characteristics, and short product life cycles. If Dell Technologies fails to manage in an effective manner transitions to new solutions and offerings, the products and services associated with such offerings and customer demand for Dell Technologies' solutions, products, and services could diminish, and Dell Technologies' profitability could suffer. Dell Technologies is increasingly sourcing new products and transitioning existing products through its contract manufacturers and manufacturing outsourcing relationships in order to generate cost efficiencies and better serve its customers. The success of product transitions depends on a number of factors, including the availability of sufficient quantities of components at attractive costs. Product transitions also present execution challenges and risks, including the risk that new or upgraded products may have quality issues or other defects.\n\n18\n\nDocument\n\n18\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFailure to deliver high-quality hardware, software, and services could lead to loss of customers and diminished profitability. Dell Technologies must identify and address quality issues associated with its hardware, software, and services, many of which include third-party components. Although quality testing is performed regularly to detect quality problems and implement required solutions, failure to identify and correct significant product quality issues before the sale of such products to customers could result in lower sales, increased warranty or replacement expenses, and reduced customer confidence, which could harm Dell Technologies' operating results.\n\nDell Technologies' ability to generate substantial non-U.S. net revenue is subject to additional risks and uncertainties. Sales outside the United States accounted for approximately 51% of Dell Technologies' consolidated net revenue for Fiscal 2018. Dell Technologies' future growth rates and success are substantially dependent on the continued growth of Dell Technologies' business outside of the United States. Dell Technologies' international operations face many risks and uncertainties, including varied local economic and labor conditions, political instability, changes in the U.S. and international regulatory environments, and the impacts of trade protection measures, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign operations), copyright levies, and foreign currency exchange rates. Any of these factors could negatively affect Dell Technologies' international business results and prospects for growth. Dell Technologies' profitability may be adversely affected by product, customer, and geographic sales mix, and seasonal sales trends. Dell Technologies' overall profitability for any period may be adversely affected by changes in the mix of products, customers, and geographic markets reflected in sales for that period, and by seasonal trends. Profit margins vary among products, services, customers, and geographic markets. For instance, services offerings generally have a higher profit margin than consumer products. In addition, parts of Dell Technologies' business are subject to seasonal sales trends. Among the trends with the most significant impact on Dell Technologies' operating results, sales to government customers (particularly the U.S. federal government) are typically stronger in Dell Technologies' third fiscal quarter, sales in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are often weaker in Dell Technologies' third fiscal quarter, and sales to consumers are typically strongest during Dell Technologies' fourth fiscal quarter. Dell Technologies may lose revenue opportunities and experience gross margin pressure if sales channel participants fail to perform as expected. Dell Technologies relies on third-party value-added resellers, system integrators, distributors, retailers, and other sales channels to complement its direct sales organization in order to reach more end-users globally. Future operating results depend on the performance of sales channel participants and on Dell Technologies' success in maintaining and developing these relationships. Revenue and gross margins could be negatively affected if the financial condition or operations of channel participants weaken as a result of adverse economic conditions or other business challenges, or if uncertainty regarding the demand for Dell Technologies' products causes channel participants to reduce their orders for these products. Further, some channel participants may consider the expansion of Dell Technologies' direct sales initiatives to conflict with their business interests as distributors or resellers of Dell Technologies' products, which could lead them to reduce their investment in the distribution and sale of such products, or to cease all sales of Dell Technologies' products. Dell Technologies' financial performance could suffer from reduced access to the capital markets by Dell Technologies or some of its customers. Dell Technologies may access debt and capital sources to provide financing for customers and to obtain funds for general corporate purposes, including working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and funding of customer receivables. In addition, Dell Technologies maintains customer financing relationships with some companies that rely on access to the debt and capital markets to meet significant funding needs. Any inability of these companies to access such markets could compel Dell Technologies to self-fund transactions with such companies or to forgo customer financing opportunities, which could harm Dell Technologies' financial performance. The debt and capital markets may experience extreme volatility and disruption from time to time in the future, which could result in higher credit spreads in such markets and higher funding costs for Dell Technologies. Deterioration in Dell Technologies' business performance, a credit rating downgrade, volatility in the securitization markets, changes in financial services regulation, or adverse changes in the economy could lead to reductions in the availability of debt financing. In addition, these events could limit Dell Technologies' ability to continue asset securitizations or other forms of financing from debt or capital sources, reduce the amount of financing receivables that Dell\n\n19\n\nDocument\n\n19\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTechnologies originates, or negatively affect the costs or terms on which Dell Technologies may be able to obtain capital. Any of these developments could adversely affect Dell Technologies' net revenue, profitability, and cash flows.\n\nWeak economic conditions and additional regulation could harm Dell Technologies' financial services activities. Dell Technologies' financial services activities are negatively affected by adverse economic conditions that contribute to loan delinquencies and defaults. An increase in loan delinquencies and defaults would result in greater net credit losses, which may require Dell Technologies to increase its reserves for customer receivables. In addition, the implementation of new financial services regulation, or the application of existing financial services regulation in countries where Dell Technologies expands its financial services and related supporting activities, could unfavorably affect the profitability and cash flows of Dell Technologies' consumer financing activities. Dell Technologies is subject to counterparty default risks. Dell Technologies has numerous arrangements with financial institutions that include cash and investment deposits, interest rate swap contracts, foreign currency option contracts, and forward contracts. As a result, Dell Technologies is subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these arrangements will default, either voluntarily or involuntarily, on its performance under the terms of the arrangement. In times of market distress, a counterparty may default rapidly and without notice, and Dell Technologies may be unable to take action to cover its exposure, either because of lack of contractual ability to do so or because market conditions make it difficult to take effective action. If one of Dell Technologies' counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, Dell Technologies' ability eventually to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty's default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable legal regime governing the bankruptcy proceeding. In the event of such a default, Dell Technologies could incur significant losses, which could harm Dell Technologies' business and adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition. The exercise by customers of certain rights under their services contracts with Dell Technologies, or Dell Technologies' failure to perform as it anticipates at the time it enters into services contracts, could adversely affect Dell Technologies' revenue and profitability. Many of Dell Technologies' services contracts allow customers to take actions that may adversely affect Dell Technologies' revenue and profitability. These actions include terminating a contract if Dell Technologies' performance does not meet specified service levels, requesting rate reductions or contract termination, reducing the use of Dell Technologies' services, or terminating a contract early upon payment of agreed fees. In addition, Dell Technologies estimates the costs of delivering the services at the outset of the contract. If Dell Technologies fails to estimate such costs accurately and actual costs significantly exceed estimates, Dell Technologies may incur losses on the services contracts. Loss of government contracts could harm Dell Technologies' business. Contracts with U.S. federal, state, and local governments and with foreign governments are subject to future funding that may affect the extension or termination of programs and to the right of such governments to terminate contracts for convenience or non-appropriation. There is pressure on governments, both domestically and internationally, to reduce spending. Funding reductions or delays could adversely affect public sector demand for Dell Technologies' products and services. In addition, if Dell Technologies violates legal or regulatory requirements, the applicable government could suspend or disbar Dell Technologies as a contractor, which would unfavorably affect Dell Technologies' net revenue and profitability. Dell Technologies' business could suffer if Dell Technologies does not develop and protect its proprietary intellectual property or obtain or protect licenses to intellectual property developed by others on commercially reasonable and competitive terms. If Dell Technologies or its suppliers are unable to develop or protect desirable technology or technology licenses, Dell Technologies may be prevented from marketing products, may have to market products without desirable features, or may incur substantial costs to redesign products. Dell Technologies also may have to defend or enforce legal actions or pay damages if Dell Technologies is found to have violated the intellectual property of other parties. Although Dell Technologies' suppliers might be contractually obligated to obtain or protect such licenses and indemnify Dell Technologies against related expenses, those suppliers could be unable to meet their obligations. Although Dell Technologies invests in research and development and obtains additional intellectual property through acquisitions, those activities do not guarantee that Dell Technologies will develop or obtain intellectual property necessary for profitable operations. Costs involved in developing and protecting rights in intellectual property may have a negative impact on Dell Technologies' business. In addition, Dell Technologies' operating\n\n20\n\nDocument\n\n20\n\nTable of Contents\n\ncosts could increase because of copyright levies or similar fees by rights holders and collection agencies in European and other countries. Infrastructure disruptions could harm Dell Technologies' business. Dell Technologies depends on its information technology and manufacturing infrastructure to achieve its business objectives. Natural disasters, manufacturing failures, telecommunications system failures, or defective or improperly installed new or upgraded business management systems could lead to disruptions in this infrastructure. Portions of Dell Technologies' IT infrastructure also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service, or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work. Such disruptions may adversely affect Dell Technologies' ability to receive or process orders, manufacture and ship products in a timely manner or otherwise conduct business in the normal course. Further, portions of Dell Technologies' services business involve the processing, storage, and transmission of data, which also would be negatively affected by such an event. Disruptions in Dell Technologies' infrastructure could lead to loss of customers and revenue, particularly during a period of heavy demand for Dell Technologies' products and services. Dell Technologies also could incur significant expense in repairing system damage and taking other remedial measures. Cyber attacks or other data security incidents that disrupt Dell Technologies' operations or result in the breach or other compromise of proprietary or confidential information about Dell Technologies or Dell Technologies' workforce, customers, or other third parties could disrupt Dell Technologies' business, harm its reputation, cause Dell Technologies to lose clients, and expose Dell Technologies to costly regulatory enforcement and litigation. Dell Technologies manages, stores, and otherwise processes various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to its operations. In addition, Dell Technologies' cloud computing businesses routinely process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including sensitive and personally identifiable information, for Dell Technologies' customers. Dell Technologies may experience breaches or other compromise of the information technology systems it uses for these purposes, as criminal or other actors may be able to penetrate Dell Technologies' network security and misappropriate or compromise Dell Technologies' confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Further, hardware and operating system software and applications that Dell Technologies produces or procures from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \"bugs\" and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of such systems. The costs to address the foregoing security problems and security vulnerabilities before or after a cyber incident could be significant. Remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede Dell Technologies' sales, manufacturing, distribution, or other critical functions. Dell Technologies could lose existing or potential customers for outsourcing services or other information technology solutions in connection with any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in Dell Technologies' products. In addition, breaches of Dell Technologies' security measures and the unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about Dell Technologies or its customers or other third parties could expose Dell Technologies, its customers, or other third parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in regulatory enforcement, litigation and potential liability for Dell Technologies, damage Dell Technologies' brand and reputation, or otherwise harm Dell Technologies' business. Further, Dell Technologies relies in certain limited capacities on third-party data management providers and other vendors whose possible security problems and security vulnerabilities may have similar effects on Dell Technologies. Dell Technologies is subject to laws, rules, and regulations in the United States and other countries relating to the collection, use, and security of user and other data. Dell Technologies' ability to execute transactions and to possess and use personal information and data in conducting its business subjects it to legislative and regulatory burdens that may require Dell Technologies to notify regulators and customers, employees, or other individuals of a data security breach, including in the European Union when the EU General Data Protection Regulation takes effect in May 2018. Dell Technologies has incurred, and will continue to incur, significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards, or contractual obligations, but despite such expenditures may face regulatory and other legal actions in the event of a data breach or perceived or actual non-compliance with such requirements.\n\n21\n\nDocument\n\n21\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFailure to hedge effectively Dell Technologies' exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates could adversely affect Dell Technologies' financial condition and results of operations. Dell Technologies utilizes derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Some of these instruments and contracts may involve elements of market and credit risk in excess of the amounts recognized in Dell Technologies' financial statements. If Dell Technologies is not successful in monitoring its foreign exchange exposures and conducting an effective hedging program, Dell Technologies' foreign currency hedging activities may not offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its future results of operations and financial position. The expiration of tax holidays or favorable tax rate structures, unfavorable outcomes in tax audits and other tax compliance matters, or adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes could result in an increase in Dell Technologies' tax expense or Dell Technologies' effective income tax rate. Portions of Dell Technologies' operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holidays that expire in whole or in part from time to time. Many of these holidays may be extended when certain conditions are met, or may be terminated if certain conditions are not met. If the tax holidays are not extended, or if Dell Technologies fails to satisfy the conditions of the reduced tax rate, its effective tax rate would be impacted. Dell Technologies' effective tax rate also could be impacted if Dell Technologies' geographic sales mix changes. In addition, any actions by Dell Technologies to repatriate non-U.S. earnings for which it has not previously provided for U.S. taxes may affect the effective tax rate. The application of tax laws to Dell Technologies' operations and past transactions involves some inherent uncertainty. Dell Technologies is continually under audit in various tax jurisdictions. Although Dell Technologies believes its tax positions are appropriate, Dell Technologies may not be successful in resolving potential tax claims that arise from these audits. An unfavorable outcome in certain of these matters could result in a substantial increase in Dell Technologies' tax expense. In addition, Dell Technologies' provision for income taxes could be affected by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets. Changes in tax laws (including any future Treasury notices or regulations related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law on December 22, 2017) could adversely affect Dell Technologies' operations and profitability. In recent years, numerous legislative, judicial, and administrative changes have been made to tax laws applicable to Dell Technologies and companies similar to Dell Technologies. Additional changes to tax laws are likely to occur, and such changes may adversely affect Dell Technologies' tax liability. Dell Technologies' profitability could suffer from any impairment of its portfolio investments. Dell Technologies invests a significant portion of its available funds in a portfolio consisting primarily of debt securities of various types and maturities pending the deployment of these funds in Dell Technologies' business. Dell Technologies' earnings performance could suffer from any impairment of its investments. Dell Technologies' portfolio securities generally are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded in Dell Technologies' financial statements at fair value. If any such investments experience declines in market price and it is determined that such declines are other than temporary, Dell Technologies may have to recognize in earnings the decline in the fair market value of such investments below their cost or carrying value. Unfavorable results of legal proceedings could harm Dell Technologies' business and result in substantial costs. Dell Technologies is involved in various claims, suits, investigations, and legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business, as well as those that arose in connection with Dell's going-private transaction and the EMC merger transaction, including those described elsewhere in this report. Additional legal claims or regulatory matters may arise in the future and could involve stockholder, consumer, regulatory, compliance, intellectual property, antitrust, tax, and other issues on a global basis. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. Regardless of the merits of the claims, litigation may be both time-consuming and disruptive to Dell Technologies' business. Dell Technologies could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could adversely affect its operating results or cash flows in a particular period. In addition, Dell Technologies' business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against it by any third party is successful, or if Dell Technologies fails to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions.\n\n22\n\nDocument\n\n22\n\nTable of Contents\n\nDell Technologies is incurring increased costs and is subject to additional regulations and requirements as a public company, and Dell Technologies' management is required to devote substantial time to compliance matters, which could lower Dell Technologies' profits or make it more difficult to run its business.\n\nSince it became a public company in June 2016, Dell Technologies has been incurring significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that it had not incurred as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements and costs of recruiting and retaining non-executive directors. Dell Technologies also is incurring costs associated with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related rules implemented by the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\"), on which its Class V Common Stock is listed. The expenses incurred by public companies generally for financial reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing. The increased Dell Technologies' legal and financial compliance costs have made some activities more time-consuming and costly. Dell Technologies' management has to devote substantial time to ensuring that it complies with all of these requirements. Laws and regulations affecting public company directors and executive officers could make it more difficult for Dell Technologies to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on its board of directors or its board committees or as its executive officers. Further, if Dell Technologies is unable to satisfy its obligations as a public company, the Class V Common Stock could be subject to delisting from the NYSE and Dell Technologies could be subject to fines, sanctions, and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation. Dell Technologies is obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting and any failure to do so may adversely affect investor confidence in Dell Technologies and, as a result, the value of the Class V Common Stock. Dell Technologies is required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to furnish an annual report by management on, among other matters, its assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. The assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by Dell Technologies' management in its report. Dell Technologies also is required to disclose significant changes made in its internal control over financial reporting. In addition, Dell Technologies' independent registered public accounting firm is required to express an opinion each year as to the effectiveness of Dell Technologies' internal control over financial reporting. The process of designing, implementing, and testing internal control over financial reporting is time-consuming, costly, and complicated. During t"
