        "text": "New Reseller Portal, opportunity registration, market development fund, and lead sharing for qualified partners highlight Mozy Reseller Program improvements\n\nMozy, the world's most trusted provider of data protection and availability for consumers and businesses, today announced a significant upgrade to its reseller program, including ‘Mozy Reseller Portal 2.0'; real-time co-branded marketing and sales materials; and new lead management features like opportunity registration and lead sharing to reward the value and commitment Mozy resellers are making to the industry-leading Mozy service.\n\nMozy, which started its Reseller Program in 2006, and has doubled its channel business over the past three years – making the Mozy Reseller Program a key sales channel for the company – has more than 5,000 resellers worldwide who provide Mozy online backup to businesses of all sizes. Complete information about the Mozy Reseller Program and the enhancements included in today's announcement are available at http://partners.mozy.com.\n\nHeadlining today's announcement is a major upgrade to the Mozy Reseller Portal, Mozy's online partner extranet first launched in early 2011. The new Mozy Reseller Portal gives qualifying resellers access to all program information and tools, directly from the source. Three key improvements have been made to the portal:\n\nA co-branded marketing collateral tool that gives resellers the ability to create their own branded sales collateral\n\nThe ability to easily register opportunities and engage the Mozy Sales team for support in closing deals\n\nLead sharing and an MDF program with turnkey marketing support for Platinum partners.\n\n\"This is the most significant step Mozy has made to date in demonstrating our ongoing commitment to the channel and overall support to our partners,\" said Darrell Gamble, Director of Channel Sales at Mozy, who was recently recognized as a CRN ‘Channel Chief' for 2012. \"With regard to co-branding specifically, our resellers have been pleading for our help in producing high-impact marketing materials in real-time, and we've answered that request in this new portal.\"\n\nAlso receiving an upgrade is the Mozy Accreditation Program, with the following new qualifying tiers (and benefits for each) being announced:\n\nMozy Silver Certified Reseller\n\nMozy Gold Certified Reseller\n\nMozy Platinum Partner\n\n\"We value the relationship we have with all our resellers and feel we're now giving them tools to not only grow their Mozy business, but also their business as a whole,\" said Gamble. \"Our greatly enhanced reseller program adds benefits for all of our resellers with the highest level of benefits and features going to our Platinum partners.\"\n\n\"We're very pleased to see Mozy moving in this direction,\" said Arnie Boyarsky, President, Info 2 Extreme, Inc., a Los Angeles, CA-based Mozy reseller. \"Having been involved in the channel for many years, we know that the best vendor relationships start with a strong, no-nonsense, commitment to the partners and a deep understating of the value that the channel brings to the table. I'm confident that the current steps Mozy is making will lead to more growth for them, reduced sales cycles for their partners like us, happier end-user customers, and increased revenue opportunities for all.\"\n\nMozy also announced the availability of MozyEnterprise into its reseller channel (see accompanying press release). MozyEnterprise is an enhanced version of Mozy for large companies needing advanced cloud-based functionality to securely back up data generated by increasingly mobile workforces, and from tablets and smart phones. MozyEnterprise and MozyPro are also available through EMC's Velocity partner program.
