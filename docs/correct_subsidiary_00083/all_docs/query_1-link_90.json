        "text": "Data storage is the collective methods and technologies that capture and retain digital information on electromagnetic, optical or silicon-based storage media. Storage is a key component of digital devices, as consumers and businesses have come to rely on it to preserve information ranging from personal photos to business-critical information. Modern storage systems require enhanced capabilities to allow enterprises to apply machine learning-enabled artificial intelligence (AI) to capture this data, analyze it and wring maximum value from it. This paper provides an overview of data storage technologies, evaluation of storage heirarchy and importance of data storage.\n\nThe main part of this report describes the outcome of our questionnaire study on LTP systems that was performed during the second half of 2011. The study discusses types of systems deployed in memory institutions and their main features."
