        "text": "Telstra announced today that small to medium businesses would have access to EMC’s Mozy Pro remote backup solution through its T-Suite software as a service platform.\n\n“Catastrophic data loss can wipe out years of work – if not your entire business,” said Marcus Bartram, the telco’s head of Cloud Solutions Marketing within its small and medium business division. “Remote Backup MozyPro Server and PC are all about simple, convenient data backup and retrieval.”\n\nTwo options are available to SMB customers — one with available space from 10GB to 1TB of data, and another with 5GB to 50GB of backup space. A 30 day trial for initial sign-ups of the packages is available for T-Suite customers, with charging to begin after the trial.\n\nBoth options include use of SAS70-certified and ISO-compliant datacentres, and Telstra said it ensured that data would encrypted at all stages of the process — before transmission, transit and whilst in storage. Customers can select data to backup, chose when automatic backups occur and access their history log, configurations and bandwidth usage. They are also able to restore data and back-up the SQL Server and Exchange platforms on Windows.\n\nTelstra’s range of T-Suite applications include Microsoft Exchange Online, Microsoft Business Productivity Online Suite, Mcafee SaaS Endpoint Protection, MessageLabs Email Protection and Xero Online Accounting with most applications available for a free 30 day trial."
