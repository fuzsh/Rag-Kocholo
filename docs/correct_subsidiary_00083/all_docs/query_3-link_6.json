        "text": "EMC completed its acquisition of disk storage provider Iomega last month and the storage company is putting the acquisition to work. EMC said Wednesday that Iomega hard drives will feature its Mozy and Retrospect backup and recovery software, which will let users use MozyHome to store large amounts of data online for $4.95 a month.\n\n\"Iomega hard drives will have Mozy cloud backup software added to them so home users can backup their [data] to Mozy's remote data centers in the Internet cloud,\" EMC said, noting that the Iomega drives already are sold with Retrospect software installed.\n\nThe convergence of the three products -- Iomega drives and Mozy and Retrospect software -- is the latest example of the way EMC purchases disparate companies with different product focuses and then lashes them together to provide a new product or service.\n\nIn addition to the paid backup service, EMC offers a free 2 GB version of the MozyHome service. EMC noted that the online backup service functions as insurance to protect against external disk drive collapses, and also to protect against natural disasters like floods and fires. The company also noted that the Mozy service can be valuable for travelers who need to access data as they travel.\n\nEMC acquired the Dantz Development Corp. in 2004. The storage company acquired the Mozy software when it picked up Berkeley Data Systems last year. \"More such product cross-fertilization can be expected,\" EMC said.\n\nThe company said it will make Iomega external hard drives with the new software bundle available this month in the U.S. and in international markets later this summer. EMC also said users of its Retrospect Express can upgrade for a fee to EMC Retrospect Professional for Windows or Desktop for Macintosh."
