        "text": "Cloud computing source: en.wikipedia.org/ wiki/Cloud_computing Cloud computing metaphor: For a user, the network elements representing the provider-rendered services are invisible, as if obscured by a cloud. Cloud computing is a kind of Internet-based computing that provides shared processing resources and data to computers and other devices on demand. It is a model for enabling ubiquitous, on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications and services), [1][2] which can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort. Cloud computing and storage solutions provide users and enterprises with various capabilities to store and process their data in third-party data centers. [3] It relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economy of scale, similar to a utility (like the electricity grid) over a network. Advocates claim that cloud computing allows companies to avoid upfront infrastructure costs, and focus on projects that differentiate their businesses instead of on infrastructure. [4] Proponents also claim that cloud computing allows enterprises to get their applications up and running faster, with improved manageability and less maintenance, and enables IT to more rapidly adjust resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable business demand. [4][5][6] Cloud providers typically use a \"pay as you go\" model. This will lead to unexpectedly high charges if administrators do not adapt to the cloud pricing model. [7] The present availability of high-capacity networks, low-cost computers and storage devices as well as the widespread adoption of hardware virtualization, service-oriented architecture, and autonomic and utility computing have led to a growth in cloud computing. [8][9][10] Companies can scale up as computing needs increase and then scale down again as demands decrease. Cloud computing has become a highly demanded service or utility due to the advantages of high computing power, cheap cost of services, high performance, scalability, accessibility as well as availability. Some cloud vendors are experiencing growth rates of 50% per year, [11] but being still in a stage of infancy, it has pitfalls that need to be addressed to make cloud computing services more reliable and user friendly. [12][13]\n\nAs organizational security breaches increase, so too does the need to fully understand the human factors that lead to these breaches and take the necessary steps to minimize threats. The present study evaluates how three sets of employee characteristics (demographic, company-specific, and skills-based) predict an employeeâ€™s likelihood of becoming a security breach victim. In order to move beyond traditional evaluations of security threats, which generally consider security threats individually, analyses in this paper approach security vulnerability from a more holistic approach to analyze four risk categories concurrently: phishing, passwords, bring your own device (BYOD), and company-supplied laptops. Findings from a survey of 250 employees at a medium-sized American information technology (IT) consulting firm identify higher-risk employees across the four risk areas and provide new insights into the challenges organizations face when trying to ensure the protection of company data."
