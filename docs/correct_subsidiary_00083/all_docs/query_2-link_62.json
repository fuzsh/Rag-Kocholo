        "text": "NOTE From DSA Editor: When it comes to acquisitions, EMC is one company that just seems to get it right. Years ago when EMC purchased Legato, the wisdom was questioned, Legato Networker was a product with a declining market against brighter competitors such as Netbackup from the then Veritas. However we see an ongoing resurgence of Networker in this region. When we look at the EMC data protection range, based on Networker, Data Domain and Avamar, we see an excellent portfolio that is being developed and extended further but based on individual acquisitions that EMC has successfully gelled together to create an enviable portfolio that makes real sense for enterprises requiring data protection. As we move down the stack to SMB, some of the other acquisitions may not have been so successful (e.g. Dantz) however with brands like Mozy, it seems EMC have not forgotten the SMB space either. But deciphering the SMB puzzle remains a challenge for a lot of global companies, so EMC is not alone here.Still the EMC approach of a Federation seems to work for the storage giant and the companies it has gobbled up.\n\nEMC Redefines Data Protection for a Software-Defined World\n\nMajor Innovations Across EMC Data Protection Portfolio Enable Customers to Address Continuum of Requirements and Deliver Data Protection-as-a-Service\n\nKuala Lumpur, Malaysia- April 7, 2014\n\nNews Summary\n\n· EMC helps customers establish effective data protection for software-defined data centers.\n\n· New data protection-as-a-service solutions span the full continuum of data protection requirements, enabling EMC customers to confidently transition to software-defined data centers and fully exploit the cost and operational advantages they deliver.\n\n· EMC Data Protection Suite enhancements, a new EMC Data Domain Operating System and new releases of EMC VPLEX and EMC RecoverPoint deliver powerful new capabilities today, while laying the foundation for the future.\n\nFull Story:\n\nEMC Corporation has announced new products and technologies that address the full continuum of data protection requirements facing users, both today and as they address the challenge of transitioning to software-defined data centers.\n\nIn software-defined data centers, infrastructure is virtualized and delivered as a service. To maintain effective protection during the transition to next generation environments, data protection strategies and technologies must also evolve to a service-based delivery model.\n\nEMC’s data protection solutions span the full range of customers’ data protection needs, from archive to continuous availability for physical, virtual and cloud environments. With today’s announcement, EMC adds new integrations with primary and protection storage platforms, and with hypervisors and enterprise applications, while extending support for cloud environments and delivering new technologies that enable data protection-as-a-service delivery. These innovations drive new efficiencies into customer environments today, while laying a foundation that helps EMC customers move confidently to software-defined data centers.\n\nNew Product and Technology Highlights\n\nEvolution of the EMC Data Protection Suite\n\nThe EMC® Data Protection SuiteTM redefines the usage model for data protection software by enabling flexible application of integrated products to optimize both on-premise and cloud-based backup and archive environments as they evolve. The Data Protection Suite consists of EMC’s Avamar®, NetWorker®, Data Protection AdvisorTM, Mozy® and SourceOneTM software offerings. With this significant release of the Data Protection Suite, new capabilities include:\n\n· Snapshot Management for EMC Isilon®, EMC VNX® and NetApp arrays to improve protection for NAS-based data.\n\n· Deep support for VMware® and Microsoft cloud infrastructures via unique integration with VMware vCloud Suite® and Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager.\n\n· Full integration between Avamar and Data Domain® provides the best that both platforms can offer.\n\n· Enhanced security features and new Linux support for Mozy public clouds enable greater adoption by enterprise customers.\n\nNew Protection Storage Capabilities\n\nWith the introduction of a new EMC Data Domain Operating SystemTM, EMC continues to evolve Data Domain’s position as the industry’s de-facto open protection storage platform, with capabilities that extend its support far beyond just backup to establish it as a cornerstone for enabling delivery of data protection as-a-service. New capabilities include:\n\n· The introduction of Data Domain DD BoostTM for Enterprise Applications, which empowers application admins to protect their own environments and includes support for Oracle, SAP® solutions, the SAP HANA® platform, IBM DB2 and Microsoft SQL Server.\n\n· New secure multi-tenancy feature for cloud deployments enables Data Domain systems to deliver secure isolation for large enterprises and service providers and effectively function as a protection storage platform in data protection as-a-service deployments.\n\nArchive storage enhancements include support for 1 billion files, further broadening Data Domain systems' supported use cases."
