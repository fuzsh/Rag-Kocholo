        "text": "Draper – Dell EMC on Wednesday held a grand opening for its 100,000-square-foot, LEED Silver certified building located at Vista Station in Draper. The celebration was attended by senior leaders within the Dell EMC organization, Gov. Gary Herbert, members of Utah’s congressional delegation, Draper Mayor Troy Walker and many other community representatives.\n\nVance Checketts, vice president and general manager for Dell EMC, has been on the frontlines of the company’s growth in Utah. Checketts worked for Mozy, a homegrown backup and recovery service, when it was acquired by EMC in 2007. EMC continued to expand its presence in Utah over the past decade, and it was acquired by Dell Technologies in the fall of 2016. Now the company employs 1,300-plus workers in Utah, and, with a brand-new building and several adjacent acres of land that it owns, the global firm has planted deep roots within the Beehive State.\n\nThe new building is a “physical representation of our work, our company and our people,” said Checketts.\n\nGov. Herbert said the occasion “is a celebration for Dell EMC, it’s a celebration for Draper City, it’s a celebration for our state—but it’s really a celebration for our country, to see the private sector excelling and providing services that the people of the world need. It’s making our lives better.”\n\nHerbert said Dell EMC’s presence in Utah proves the state has become “a premier global business destination,” pointing out the firm employs 140,000 people across the globe and posted nearly $75 billion in revenue last year.\n\nThe market has become global, said Herbert, and Utah must compete on that global stage. “Dell EMC shows us how we can in fact do that,” he said.\n\n[sam id=7 codes=’false’]\n\nHerbert noted Utah is the fastest-growing technology state in the country, with 4,000 tech companies that together employ 65,000 people.\n\nHe also praised Dell EMC as a good corporate citizen in Utah. “It’s nice to see a company that gives back to the community,” he said, citing the firm’s involvement in the state’s STEM education programs and its employees’ involvement in numerous volunteer efforts.\n\nHoward Elias, president of Dell EMC Services, called Utah a “progressive, forward-leaning state.” He lauded the state’s vibrant tech ecosystem, from the local universities that provide tech talent to supportive local governments to associations like the Women Tech Council, the Utah Technology Council and Silicon Slopes.\n\nElias said Dell EMC has been on a “record-setting transformation journey” and is now the largest privately held information technology corporation in the world.\n\nIn addition to the building’s LEED certification, Checketts announced the facility will use 100 percent renewable energy. The building has eight electric vehicle charging stations and a bike shelter for up to 38 bikes.\n\nThe new Dell EMC building is within Draper’s transit-oriented Vista Station development, which was created alongside a Frontrunner station. Dell EMC joins an array of tech firms located at Vista Station, including eBay, Thumbtack, Jet.com, Storagecraft, 1-800 Contacts and Solar City."
