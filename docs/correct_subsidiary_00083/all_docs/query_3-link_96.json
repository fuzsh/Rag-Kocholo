We appreciate that you chose us to protect your data.\n\nWe are writing today to let you know that Synectics has made a decision to focus on our core business and it is with great excitement that we announce the acquisition of the BackJack Online Backup Service brand by Mozy an EMC company.\n\nWe chose Mozy for the following reasons:\n\nMozy is the leader in online backup – protecting over 70,000 businesses and over 70 petabytes of information in their multiple global data centers. Mozy’s data centers are ISO 27001 certified and SAS 70 audited.\n\nThey provide simple, secure, and automatic backups and easy restores to ensure that their customers can easily access their data.\n\nMozy’s customers receive unsurpassed support with 24 hour live, U.S.-based technical support and an account management team.\n\nStarting immediately, Mozy will be excited to assist you as BackJack transitions all customer accounts over. You will be given a MozyPro (Mozy’s business backup plan) account with the same number of users and GBs as you currently have at no additional charge to you. Mozy will fulfill the remainder of your backup subscription.\n\nTo start your MozyPro account, simply phone 877 669 9776 and identify yourself as a BackJack client. An account manager will walk you through your new account, explain the process and features, and answer any questions you may have. You can also view an FAQ here, and you can learn more about the MozyPro service by watching this video.\n\nWe’ve always felt we’ve had the greatest clients in the world and have thoroughly enjoyed working together to serve your needs. A warm thank you from the people you know on our Support and Customer Service teams such as Pat, Jean, Todd, Tim, John and Julie, as well as all the others you haven’t had the chance to meet working hard behind the scenes. Perhaps we’ll have the opportunity to cross paths again some time in the future.\n\nMozy and BackJack are committed to making this transition as smooth as possible and believe that your business will enjoy from the simplicity and peace of mind Mozy provides. Please phone 877 669 9776 or email with any questions or concerns.\n\nBest regards,"
