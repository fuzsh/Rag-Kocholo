        "text": "EMC in addition to being a hardware vendor, is also a software vendor having several technologies for backup (mozy, avamar, networker, spanning), various gateways (hardware and software), cloud software tools (cloud scaling for openstack, maginatics, scaleio, vipr, etc), data and info management tools, configuration tools, archving and enterprise file sync share (EFFS), document management, and a bunch of others… They do own VMware as a subsisidary which is part of their federation corp org/structure, they also own as part of the federation pivotal labs which includes big data platforms, development tools and associated technologies. They also recently pulled in VCE for converged solutions with cisco rataining a small equity position in that, there is also a joint Initiative between EMC and Lenvo involving Iomega using Lenovo as the distribution to the SMB space, as well as EMC and Lenovo jointly developing servers to be used by EMC for hosting their various software including software that goes into their hardware systems. Oh, and they are also the largest in pretty much every category of the storage vendors, granted some of the server vendors may be bigger, however their storage (hardware, software management tools) are not as large vs. EMC. Thats a summary of about 27 years experience with them ;)…\n\n@Praz hello and no worries, depending on what you are interested in or need to learn, there are many options including using different forums/venues like here as well as others, going to vendor sites reading their white papers, watching their videos and ebooks as well as downloading and trying there solutions.\n\nThere are also industry trade groups (SNIA and others) that have sites where you can learn the basics, view tutorials, primers, etc, as well as specific details about various tools and technologies. There are also books, blogs, webinars, conference, on-line learning among many others.\n\nWhat specific areas or focus topics do you need to learn and gain experience with? Storage hardware, software, backup/data protection, ssd, management tools, cloud, virtual among others?\n\nhi Greg\n\nThanks a lot. I am pretty much keen setting up EMC as storage/backup/date protection in my organization\n\nFor example I am running Hypver-V environment with number of VMs. Wonder how EMC will help as a storage/Backup solution for this scenario\n\nI like to go with latest/high end solution instead of standard storage option comes with server\n\nNot sure I am going to over complicated my environment\n\n@Praz no worries, good question as most assume EMC is focused just on VMware while in fact they have had a long relationship with Microsoft going back decades. This means that while there are some at EMC who are very focused on VMware, there are also those there who are very focused on Hyper-V, WIndows and other Microsoft related things including for primary storage, secondary storage, data proteciton (e.g. backup/restore, ha, bc, dr, etc).\n\nAs for your environment, you can get plenty of arguments of removing complexity with fewer vendors/technologies, as well as benefits of having a best of mixed environment. Likewise there will be some mud and fud including about vendor lockin etc, however keep in mind, vendor lockin only is a bad thing if you let it be so and that it does not cause you to work for the vendor vs. the vendors working for you. Plenty of benefits of having mixed vendors as long as you can manage them particular when it comes to when things break and who manages the finger pointing vs. those who manage to simply point fingers.\n\nEven if you are going to a simpler environment with fewer vendors, make the candidate vendors work for you by having others compete for the business so that they all play at their best to win your business, however they also have to know there is a chance that they can win. I will leave it up to the vendors/service providers to promote their preferred solution and why they are the best…\n\nGood luck with what ever you decide to do…\n\nYes to all of the above, and more!\n\nEMC can best be described at this point as the EMC Federation, consisting of the EMC most may know or remember (aka EMC II, providing extensive professional services and consulting, storage infrastructure, advanced software, data protection, etc.), VMware, RSA Security, Pivotal (a joint venture between EMC, VMware, and GE focused on next generation third platform, PaaS, rapid application development, and emerging big data and analytics like Hadoop), and VCE (a joint venture between VMware, Cisco, and EMC to deliver the industries first converged infrastructure platform). As mentioned before, there is also a broad and deep partnership between EMC and others such as Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, and more.\n\nTo learn more about the technology, you could definitely start with the myriad of industry bloggers, freely available white papers and textbooks online, instructional videos via YouTube, or by checking out the EMC Education portal.\n\nFor something specific like your mention of Hyper-V, check out the Everything Microsoft @ EMC Community Network space in the links below…\n\nThe EMC Federation\n\nEMC Education Portal\n\nECN: Everything Microsoft @ EMC\n\nECN: Free Fundamentals e-Learning Index\n\nUpdated: Additional link to Free e-Learning Fundamentals Index.\n\nThere’s a large and deep amount of Microsoft integration in the core storage and software portfolio, as well as across other product families from the EMC Federation family, with some specifically focused on one or more Microsoft products. I wanted to add this yesterday after giving it some thought but didn’t have the time until now. I had wanted to add this yesterday after giving it some more thought but didn’t have the time until now.\n\nSpecific to your question regarding EMC storage & backup in a Hyper-V and Microsoft applications environment, below are just a few suggestions regarding the integration and options available:\n\nEMC Storage Integrator for Windows Suite - Automate, manage, and monitor your EMC-Microsoft infrastructure and applications through integration with Microsoft System Center and PowerShell.\n\nEMC AppSync - SLA-Driven, self-service data protection of Microsoft SQL Server, Exchange, and more for EMC XtremIO, VNX, & VMAX storage platforms.\n\nAvamar Virtual Edition - Industry leading deduplication backup software and virtual appliance deployed in vSphere or Hyper-V and Azure.\n\nSyncplicity Panorama - Enterprise File Sync and Share secure solution with VPN-free mobile access to home directories, file shares, and SharePoint 2010/2013 content.\n\nSpanning for Office 365 - Leading provider of backup and recovery for popular SaaS platforms can now cover Microsoft’s Office 365."
