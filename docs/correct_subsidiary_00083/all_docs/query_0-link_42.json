        "text": "SEATTLE, Feb. 19, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Mozy by EMC, the world's most trusted provider of cloud backup and access, announced today that for the second straight year Darrell Gamble has been named one of UBM Tech Channel's CRN Channel Chiefs. Widely recognized as the most influential and powerful leaders in the IT channel, the elite list recognizes those executives directly responsible for driving channel sales and growth within their organizations, while evangelizing and defending the importance of the channel throughout the entire IT Industry.\n\nSince 2009 Gamble has directed the channel sales efforts at Mozy, and more recently continued to drive the Mozy Reseller Program as an increasingly important sales channel for the leading provider of online data backup and access, which is part of EMC Corporation. In 2011 Gamble was behind a number of initiatives to renew Mozy's focus on channel sales, and in 2012 those initiatives and that focus lead to Mozy's channel revenue as a percentage of overall revenue setting a new company record.\n\nFor more than ten years Channel Chiefs have been selected by the CRN editorial team based on channel experience, program innovations, channel-driven revenue, and public support for the importance of IT Channel Sales.\n\n\"The 2013 Channel Chiefs list recognizes vendor executives dedicated to driving channel programs in the IT marketplace,\" said Kelley Damore, Senior Vice President, Editorial Director, CRN. \"Our annual Channel Chiefs issue is a must-read for IT solution providers evaluating new vendors or looking to expand solution offerings. These are the people, the products and the programs that any savvy solution provider needs to know. We congratulate this year's Channel Chiefs for their stellar record of business innovation and applaud them for their continued dedication to the partner community.\"\n\nSelected by CRN's editorial staff, the 2013 Channel Chiefs list is featured in the February 25 issue of CRN Magazine and will be featured online at www.crn.com.\n\n\"Darrell's leadership was paramount to Mozy's successful, well-documented channel sales efforts in 2012,\" said Eric Stein, Managing Director of Global Sales at Mozy. \"He has continued to be that motivating force our team has needed to achieve all our channel goals - and we've had a lot of them. We felt 2012 was the year Mozy Channel Sales really hit its stride, and we're not resting on our laurels. We have many more improvements to make in our product offerings and reseller tools that will help make Mozy one of the most channel-friendly vendors in the business.\"\n\nAbout Mozy Mozy is the world's most trusted provider of cloud backup and access, with more than three million customers, including 80,000 business customers and more than 90 petabytes of information stored at its multiple data centers around the globe.
