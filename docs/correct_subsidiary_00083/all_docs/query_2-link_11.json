        "text": "SEATTLE, June 23, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Mozy®, the industry-leading online backup service from EMC Corporation (NYSE: EMC), today announced the availability of its mobile app for MozyPro® customers. The Mozy mobile app lets end users securely access the files they protect with MozyPro from an Android or Apple iOS device (including iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch).\n\nFirst launched March 31, the mobile app is now available for MozyPro customers and adds support for six additional languages (UK English, Dutch, French, German, Italian and Spanish). For more information please visit http://mozy.com/mobile.\n\nFor Android users, the app can be downloaded now from the Android Market for devices running Android 2.0 and later. For iOS device users of version 4.0 and later, the app is now available in the iTunes App Store.\n\n\"With so much positive response to the mobile app from the initial release, we're very pleased to enable MozyPro administrators to provide access to their end users,\" said Russ Stockdale, General Manager of Mozy. \"Having mobile access to view documents, open them in other applications, and send them by email to colleagues and clients is especially valuable to business users. Along with recent major updates to browser access, the mobile app shows that not only are we as serious as ever about data protection, but also about the ever-increasing need for business users and home users alike to have secure access to their files from anywhere.\"\n\n\"With the explosive growth of mobile device use on our campus, many of our faculty and staff are asking for the functionality to access their important laptop or desktop-based work and instructional materials from their mobile platforms,\" said Walter Petruska, Information Security Officer at the University of San Francisco. \"The MozyPro mobile apps now allow our instructors to access their materials anywhere at any time, without needing to download, store or transmit their files in advance. This is especially beneficial to all our early adopters of iPads and Android-powered tablets for educational purposes. It's also great news for all of our staff and faculty when traveling -- whether cross-country or just across campus -- because they no longer have to carry their laptop computer.\"\n\nPricing and Availability:\n\nThe mobile app for iOS and Android devices are new, free features for MozyPro customers and are available for download. There is no extra cost to current MozyPro customers. A subsequent update to the app will provide support for customers using personal-key encryption.\n\nAbout Mozy\n\nMozy is the world's most trusted online backup service for consumers and businesses, with more than three million customers, 70,000 business users and 70 petabytes of information stored at its multiple data centers around the globe. Mozy was acquired by EMC Corporation in 2007 and operates as part of Decho Corporation, an EMC company.
