        "text": "Only 21 of the 44 technology companies on our watch list managed to record gains in the price of their publicly traded shares during the stock market turbulence of 2018. Twenty-three recorded price declines—many by significant double-digit percentages. Take a look at who were the winners and who were the losers.\n\nHit By The Stock Market's Dive Late In The Year, Many Tech Companies Suffer Share Price Declines In 2018\n\nOverall, the markets had their worst year since the financial crisis of 2008 with most of the losses coming in the fourth quarter. The Dow Jones closed the year at 23,327.46, down 5.63 percent from its 2017 close. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fared a bit better, closing at 6,635.28, down 3.88 percent from its 2017 close.\n\nTwenty-three of the 44 technology companies on our watch list recorded declines in their stock prices in 2018, many by hefty double-digit percentages. Only 21 managed to increase the value of their stocks in 2018. (And a couple of those were due to acquisitions in which the acquiring company paid an above-market premium.)\n\nAnd going forward our watch list will include Dell Technologies, which went public on the New York Stock Exchange on Dec. 28 at $46.00 per share and closed out the year at $48.87, up 6 percent.\n\nid\n\nunit-1659132512259\n\ntype\n\nSponsored post\n\nHere's a look at who was up and who was down in 2018, starting with companies with the biggest gains in share price, based on stock closing prices on Dec. 29, 2017, and Dec. 31, 2018.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices\n\nCEO: Lisa Su\n\nDec. 29, 2017 Close: $10.28\n\nDec. 31, 2018 Close: $18.46\n\nChange: +79.57%\n\nA resurgent AMD topped this year's list of companies with the biggest increases in stock price.\n\nWith its Ryzen CPU processors and Radeon graphics cards, AMD has been giving rival Intel a competitive run for its money. And AMD is readying its next-generation 7-nanometer chips for 2019 even while Intel struggles with delays with its 10nm processors.\n\nFor the first nine months (ended Sept. 29) of 2018, AMD reported revenue of $5.06 billion, up 29 percent from $3.91 billion in the same period in 2017. The company reported net income of $299 million for the first nine months of 2018 compared with a $14 million loss in the same period one year before.\n\nIn December AMD was added to the Nasdaq 100 index—the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock market.\n\nTableau Software\n\nCEO: Adam Selipsky\n\nDec. 29, 2017 Close: $69.20\n\nDec. 31, 2018 Close: $120.00\n\nChange: +73.41%\n\nTableau Software has become one of the clear leaders in the crowded market for business analytics and data visualization software.\n\nFor the first nine months (ended Sept. 30) of 2018, Tableau reported revenue of $819.1 million, up 30 percent from $627.7 million in the first nine months of 2017. The company also nearly halved its loss for the nine-month period, reporting a $79.9 million loss during the 2018 period compared with a $143.7 million loss one year earlier.\n\nFortinet\n\nCEO: Ken Xie\n\nDec. 29, 2017 Close: $43.69\n\nDec. 31, 2018 Close: $70.43\n\nChange: +61.20%\n\nSecurity technology developer Fortinet is another company that rebounded in 2018 after hitting rough patches in recent years. The company staked out a leadership position in the rough-and-tumble cybersecurity arena with its Fortinet Security Fabric architecture.\n\nIn October Fortinet acquired ZoneFox, a developer of cloud-based threat analytics technology, in a move that expanded the company's offerings for protecting against insider threats.\n\nFor the first nine months (ended Sept. 30) of 2018, Fortinet reported revenue of $1.29 billion, up 20 percent from $1.08 billion in the same period in 2017. The company reported net income of $149.6 million for the 2018 period, more than double the $60.4 million in net income reported for the same period a year earlier.\n\nRed Hat\n\nCEO: James Whitehurst\n\nDec. 29, 2017 Close: $120.10\n\nDec. 31, 2018 Close: $175.64\n\nChange: +46.24%\n\nOn Oct. 28 open-source software developer Red Hat struck a deal to be acquired by IBM for $34 billion, an acquisition the two companies expect to complete in the second half of 2019.\n\nIBM is buying Red Hat at $190 per share, a significant premium above the $116.68 closing price of Red Hat's shares the Friday before the deal was announced. Red Hat shares soared to $170 following the announcement and have fluctuated between $170 and $180 per share since.\n\nFor the first three quarters (ended Nov. 30) of its fiscal 2019, Red Hat reported revenue of $2.48 billion, up nearly 16 percent from $2.15 billion in the first three quarters of fiscal 2018. The company reported net income of $294.5 million for the three quarters, up 7.5 percent from $274.0 million in the same period in fiscal 2018.\n\nSalesforce.com\n\nCEOs: Marc Benioff (pictured) and Keith Block\n\nDec. 29, 2017 Close: $102.23\n\nDec. 31, 2018 Close: $136.97\n\nChange: +33.98%\n\nAfter cracking the $10 billion revenue threshold in its fiscal 2018, Salesforce has forecast that revenue in fiscal 2019 (ending Jan. 31, 2019) will be between $13.23 billion and $13.24 billion, representing 26 percent year-over-year growth.\n\nFor fiscal 2020 Salesforce is forecasting that revenue will be in the range of $15.90 billion to $16.00 billion, representing growth of 20 percent to 21 percent.\n\nOn Aug. 7 Salesforce announced that president and COO Keith Block had been promoted to co-CEO.\n\nCA Technologies\n\nCEO: Michael Gregoire\n\nDec. 29, 2017 Close: $33.28\n\nNov. 5, 2018 Close: $44.44\n\nChange: +33.53%\n\nIn one of the most surprising news events of the year, CA Technologies struck a deal in July to be acquired by chipmaker Broadcom for $18.9 billion, or $44.50 per share. Broadcom touted the acquisition as a marriage of its hardware products with CA's infrastructure software portfolio.\n\nThe acquisition price represented approximately a 20 percent premium to the July 11 closing price of CA's shares. The price of CA's shares hovered around $44 until Broadcom completed the acquisition on Nov. 5.\n\nPalo Alto Networks\n\nCEO: Nikesh Arora\n\nDec. 29, 2017 Close: $144.94\n\nDec. 31, 2018 Close: $188.35\n\nChange: +29.95%\n\nOn June 1 security technology vendor Palo Alto Networks announced that Nikesh Arora would take over as the company's CEO, succeeding CEO Mark McLaughlin, who became vice chairman.\n\nArora worked for nearly a decade at Google, helping grow the company's search business from $2 billion to more than $60 billion. More recently he served as president and COO of Tokyo-based SoftBank Group.\n\nFor its fiscal 2019 first quarter (ended Oct. 31), Palo Alto Networks reported revenue of $656.0 million, up 31 percent from $501.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The company reported a loss of $38.3 million for the quarter compared with a $63.2 million loss one year earlier.\n\nAmazon\n\nCEO: Jeff Bezos\n\nDec. 29, 2017 Close: $1,169.47\n\nDec. 31, 2018 Close: $1,501.97\n\nChange: +28.43%\n\nOn Sept. 4 Amazon's total market cap hit $1 trillion, joining Apple as the only publicly traded companies to reach that benchmark. But Amazon was unable to hold onto the $2050 per-share price it needed to maintain that total market value. Amazon, not immune to the slumping stock markets, ended the year with a $735 billion market cap.\n\nAmazon, nevertheless, continued its astounding growth in 2018. For the first three quarters (ended Sept. 30) of the year, the company reported revenue of $160.50 billion, up nearly 37 percent from $117.41 billion in the first three quarters of 2017. Net income for the first three quarters of 2018 grew six-fold to $7.05 billion from $1.18 billion in the first three quarters of 2017.\n\nWhile the online retail giant reported growth across all its businesses, Amazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassy said in May that AWS could one day be bigger than Amazon's core e-commerce business. AWS had a projected $22 billion revenue run rate for 2018.\n\nSplunk\n\nCEO: Doug Merritt\n\nDec. 29, 2017 Close: $82.84\n\nDec. 31, 2018 Close: $104.85\n\nChange: +26.57%\n\nSplunk has enjoyed rapid sales growth for its software used to collect, process and analyze machine data. The company's growth has been most pronounced in software sales for IT operational analytics, IT operations management, and security and vulnerability management applications.\n\nFor the first three quarters (ended Oct. 31) of its fiscal 2019, Splunk reported revenue of $1.18 billion, up 39 percent from $849.5 million in the first three quarters of fiscal 2018.

The company said that growth was fueled by its software solutions and services business.\n\nNet income for the year was $453.7 million, up nearly 8 percent from $420.8 million one year earlier.\n\nLenovo Group\n\nCEO: Yang Yuanqing\n\nDec. 29, 2017 Close: $11.24\n\nDec. 31, 2018 Close: $13.40\n\nChange: +19.22%\n\nLenovo's stock rebounded from a decline in the first half of 2018 to a gain in the third quarter and then managed to hang onto some of that gain.\n\nOn Sept. 13 Lenovo unveiled a strategic alliance with storage system and service provider NetApp, co-developing all-flash arrays and hybrid flash systems to compete against Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Dell EMC in the data storage arena.\n\nFor the first six months (ended Sept. 30) of its fiscal 2019, Lenovo reported revenue of $25.29 billion, up 16 percent from $21.77 billion in the first half of fiscal 2018. Net income for the first six months of fiscal 2019 was $258.8 million, up 160 percent from $99.3 million in the same period one year earlier.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nCEO: Satya Nadella\n\nDec. 29, 2017 Close: $85.54\n\nDec. 31, 2018 Close: $101.57\n\nChange: +18.74%\n\nOn June 4 Microsoft unveiled a deal to buy source code repository GitHub in a deal valued at $7.5 billion.

The company reported a loss of $46.8 million compared with the $1.7 million loss in fiscal 2017.\n\nWestern Digital Corp.\n\nCEO: Stephen Milligan\n\nDec. 29, 2017 Close: $79.53\n\nDec. 31, 2018 Close: $36.97\n\nChange: -53.51%\n\nFor its fiscal 2019 first quarter (ended Sept. 28), Western Digital reported revenue of $5.03 billion, down 3 percent from the $5.18 billion reported in the same quarter one year before.

The company began an internal investigation and has delayed issuing financial results for fiscal 2018 (ended March 31) or for the fiscal 2019 quarters since.\n\nOn Sept. 14 Quantum said the Special Committee of its Board of Directors had \"substantially completed its internal investigation\" and concluded that \"there were misstatements in the company's previously consolidated financial statements and other financial information relating to the recognition of revenue for certain transactions.\"\n\nQuantum said annual financial reports for fiscal years 2015, 2016 and 2017, as well quarterly reports for those years and for the fiscal 2018 quarters ended June 30, 2017, and Sept. 30, 2017, \"should no longer be relied upon and will be restated.\"\n\nBecause Quantum has yet to file its 10-K form for fiscal 2018 or 10-Q forms for fiscal 2019, the company has faced delisting on the New York Stock Exchange. But on Aug. 15 it was given until Jan. 15, 2019, to file its earnings reports. And on Dec. 28 the company said it had secured $210 million in long-term financing to repay debts and \"provide a foundation for growth.\"\n\nQuantum has also experienced turmoil in its executive ranks. On June 26 the company named former Cisco and Seagate executive Jamie Lerner to be its third CEO this year."
