        "text": "AUSTIN, Texas, Oct. 3, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- MSP WORLD -- Mozy®, the world's most trusted provider of data access and backup for consumers and businesses, today at MSPWorld is showcasing significant enhancements to its Mozy Reseller Program in 2012 including:\n\nA revamped Reseller Program and portal 2.0 in the U.S. and Europe\n\nThe debut of fully customizable, co-branded marketing and sales materials\n\nA new MDF program\n\nNew lead management tools (including opportunity registration) to help resellers grow their businesses with Mozy\n\nLead sharing for Mozy Platinum™ resellers\n\nNew channel-friendly pricing for MozyPro® and MozyEnterprise®\n\nIncreasing demand from small-to-midsize businesses (SMBs) for professional-grade online data backup and access solutions has resulted in the doubling of Mozy's channel business the past three years and rapid growth in new markets including Europe and Asia.\n\n\"We've never been more focused as a company on selling Mozy through the channel than we are right now,\" said Darrell Gamble, Director of Channel Sales at Mozy, recognized as a CRN Channel Chief for 2012. \"Since we rolled out our all-new reseller portal and new pricing for MozyPro and MozyEnterprise earlier in the year, the feedback from our resellers has been tremendous. We're here at MSPWorld talking to MSPs about how they can introduce recurring revenue streams into their business by reselling Mozy's industry leading suite of world-class cloud services.\"\n\n\"Before we became a Mozy reseller we went through several of the online backup competitors and reviewed their products,\" said Dan Winterhalter at Infitech LLC (www.infitech.net), a managed service provider (MSP) based in West Chester, OH. \"What we found right off the bat was that the Mozy pricing was right, the product worked well, and it had the best feature set when it comes to server backup. Those things were the most important to us. Since then we've been able to get to know their people and watch Mozy constantly improve the product and the reseller program over time. We now have over 400 active clients on Mozy, backing up multiple terabytes of data. And we're only just getting started.\"\n\nThe opportunity and need for technology resellers to include value-added online data access and backup services in their portfolios has never been greater.\n\nAccording to oft-quoted research from DTI/Price Waterhouse Coopers, 7 out of 10 small firms that experience a major data loss go out of business within a year. Just as alarming, a full 96% of all business workstations are not being backed up (Contingency Planning and Strategic Research Corporation).\n\n\"Seven years ago when Mozy was founded, our mission was to 'back up the world,'\" said Gamble, \"We're now covering everything from home computers to mission-critical servers and workstations, and Mozy backup is in use at SMBs, mid-market companies and large enterprises. And we have our trusted partners to thank for much of that growth. Our partners told us what tools they needed to be successful, and ever since we've been focused on delivering a world-class channel program.\"\n\nComplete information about the Mozy Reseller Program and the enhancements announced earlier in 2012 are available at http://partners.mozy.com.\n\nAbout Mozy\n\nMozy is the world's most trusted provider of data access and backup for consumers and businesses, with more than three million customers, including 80,000 business customers and more than 90 petabytes of information stored at its multiple data centers around the globe. Mozy was acquired by EMC Corporation in 2007 and operates as part of Decho Corporation, an EMC company.
