        "text": "EMC is connecting two of its more recent acquisitions--Iomega and Berkeley Data Systems' Mozy online backup storage--to target small businesses and consumers.\n\nOn Wednesday, EMC will roll out a storage bundle that includes Iomega's external hard drives with a software bundle that combines the Mozy online backup service with the EMC Retrospect Express software.\n\nI'm a Mozy customer and the bundle makes sense if I were to get an external drive. All things being equal the bundle may just push me toward an Iomega drive. After all, gigabytes all look alike with external drives so it's about price and extras.\n\nEMC is touting the Iomega, Mozy and Retrospect bundle as evidence that it can buy companies and spin them into synergy-fueled products. EMC closed the purchase of Iomega in June, acquired the Retrospect software when it bought Dantz Development Corp. in 2004 and picked up Mozy when it bought Berkeley.\n\nThe larger question is whether consumers and small businesses will value this bundle. For instance, I use Mozy so I don't have to buy an external drive. I need to be sold on why this bundle would entice me to buy an Iomega drive. EMC notes that its bundle gives the \"versatility of any time, anywhere access.\" But doesn't a cloud-based storage system like Mozy already deliver that?\n\nHere's how it will work: If you buy an Iomega drive you get a license to Retrospect Express and a MozyHome account that's free for 2GB of storage. I'd be curious to see whether customers go for the integrated bundle, which works on all platforms.\n\nEMC notes that the external Iomega drives with the software bundle will be available later this month."
