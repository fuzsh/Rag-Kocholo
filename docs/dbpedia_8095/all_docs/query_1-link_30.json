        "text": "Olainfarm, a Latvian leading pharmaceutical company, has recognized a growing demand for accessible and up-to-date medical education among healthcare professionals.\n\nAs a result, the company was looking to develop an HCP portal to cater to the specific needs of healthcare professionals by providing seamless access to courses, offline and online event updates, and scientific articles.\n\nIt had to be designed on a popular CMS to ensure easy content management, compliance with GDPR requirements, scalability to handle growing user demand and subsequent expansion into other markets.\n\nAfter evaluating various content management systems, WordPress was selected as the preferred platform for OpenOlainfarm HCP portal. WordPress provides a user-friendly interface for content management and offers an extensive choice of plugins to enable integration with API systems such as ERP, CRM and Microsoft Power BI. Its scalability makes it suitable for projects of varying sizes.\n\nThe project spanned 3 months, during which the team prepared the design of the portal based on the companyâ€™s brand book, executed technical development, conducted testing, and performed server infrastructure setup and portal deployment across several markets.\n\nAdditionally, the team has adapted existing materials into comprehensive educational courses and uploaded them to the portal. UI text of the portal underwent translation into several languages, ensuring its usability across different countries."
