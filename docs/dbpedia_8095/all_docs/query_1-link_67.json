        "text": "In this picture, I am looking through the natural ‘window’ from a coastal cave. It was chilly outside, and we quite enjoyed our refuge from the elements.\n\nA couple of days ago I went outside first time after a week in bed. It felt like leaving a cave.\n\nViruses, the tiny things that are not even technically alive, can cause a lot of trouble. The only criteria for being alive they fit in is that they can evolve over time. It is why we need to get a flu vaccine every year. Basically, a virus is a string of DNA (or RNA) wrapped in a protein coat. It doesn’t respond to any stimuli and doesn’t reproduce. It just is. At this stage it is called a virion. The horror story begins when such virion gets in contact with a cell – human, animal or bacterial. Viruses are parasites, they must have a host. The host cell will produce proteins and do the replication for the virus. Some viruses leave the host cell alive, not using its full capacity. Some viral replications cause all the hosts biochemical processes to stop, and the cell will die after the viral replication is finished.\n\nThey say that there is a virus for every organism.\n\nThe best we can do after we get struck by a virus, is to drink fluids and stay in bed. And I mean it. Complications of viral infections can cause severe illness and death. As most of you, I didn’t believe that anything bad can happen to me after a simple viral infection, but it did, three times. Only a fool doesn’t learn after getting in trouble three times.\n\nIn July 1979 I got a viral infection but didn’t stay at home. I should have known better, because I got a life threatening condition after a flu in 1977, but I just started a new job! I was dragging my body to work a whole week until my growing headache forced me to call an ambulance. Our country hospital was 40km away. By the time the ambulance arrived I was only able to tell my name. I don’t have any memory of my first days in the hospital. I have got a severe viral meningitis. Unable to stabilize my condition, the doctors decided to transport me to the capital. I heard a nurse arguing and refusing to accompany me. She was motion-sick and she shouted that she didn’t want to be responsible if I die. Off we went. I was all right but we had to stop a few times for the nurse. My stay in the hospital, all the people I met, all the stories I heard, could make a book if I were a writer. If you haven’t read Cancer Ward by Russian author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, give it a try.\n\nI spent three months in the hospital. On some stage, I was immobile and had to learn to walk again. The man I loved abandoned me. A friend came over, just for a couple of hours. She had to change planes three times to get to see me over the weekend. After she left I decided to live.\n\nI was back home in October. After a month, I went to visit my friend, and the 1979 made another attempt to kill me 🙂\n\nThere is an anti-viral medicine Rimantadine Hydrochloride, that was patented in 1965 in the USA. At about the same time, a group of scientists from Olainfarm company in Latvia worked with the chemical and came up with a similar drug, but with a slightly different formula, which explains the difference in administration of the drug. This one is fantastic, and the name is Remantadin. Originally it was created to fight tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), but it is great when used in early stages of any viral infection.\n\nAnd because I mentioned Latvia, there are some photographs for you to look through. Next two blogs are dedicated to Latvia, because I am going on holidays, and I will be busy. I was lucky to spend two months in Latvia in 2013, but some photographs are taken in 2009. If you haven’t been in the Baltic states, I hope these posts will entertain you.\n\nThis is Riga, the capital of Latvia, in 2009.\n\nThis is real amber. You can pick it up after the stormy weather. Just like that 🙂\n\nSeagulls, always hungry.\n\nA stork! My favorite bird.\n\nBeautiful park in fisherman town of Pavilosta.\n\nTwo pictures from an evening walk in Grobin town. It is the lake surrounding the ruins of a 13th century castle.\n\nHope you take my story about viruses seriously. Stay well!\n\nHave a wonderful weekend!\n\nOne of the most poetic books in Old Testament is the Book of Job. Basically, the book is about a man asking the same questions many of you have asked: What have I done to deserve this? Why good people suffer? Is there a God of justice at all?\n\nI am not going to try to answer these questions, but I do want to challenge you to ask yourself some other questions also found in the Book.\n\nJob knows that somewhere in the Universe there is God, the Creator. How can we know that? By learning, of course:\n\nJob 12: 7 But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee.\n\nIndeed, studying the physical aspect of life, from a cell to an organism, from chemistry to physiology, one can discover that God reveals Himself in many ways. Is evolution consistent with creation? It definitely is! Life evolves, the Universe evolves, and the human spirit evolves. There is a whole eternity for that.\n\nJob 12: 8 Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.\n\nSpeak to the earth, and listen.\n\nJob knew the obvious, but still he had his Why? questions. Aren’t we all like that?\n\nGod didn’t answer Job’s questions. Instead, He demanded that Job answer His questions about the phenomena of Nature, and how the laws of Nature operate. Four chapters of Nature-related questions! “I will question you, and you shall answer me…”\n\n“Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail… Out whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven? “\n\n“Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds that abundance of water may cover thee?”\n\nHe asks about asses and unicorns, peacocks and ostriches, horses and grasshoppers.\n\nWhat an amazing world we have been blessed with! What an opportunity to learn and explore! Speak to the earth, and learn about your place and purpose in life. All the answers and all the ideas we might need are there.\n\nAt times some of us feel lonely, bitter, angry, frustrated, confused. Some of us are facing grief and tragedies. What can we do?\n\nThe best we can do is to live day after day facing whatever is coming toward us, and knowing where we stand.\n\nWhat have you ever learned from Nature? Does the concept of eternity scare you?\n\nHope you are having a good week! I am resting my eyes and reading paper books instead of my Kindle … 😉 No drawing or editing! Thank you for all the good wishes, my wonderful friends!\n\nAnd now, some awards!\n\nPlease, don’t feel obliged to answer: it is my way to say Thank You! for sharing your beautiful photographs and entertaining writings!\n\nCanadian prairie blogger Genevieve has nominated my blog for the Creative Blogger Award.

The course of veterinary gross anatomy had us all running like a maniac between the lecture theater and dissection lab from early morning until dark. Lab humor, only understandable to those who have actually ‘been there’, helped me maintain a healthy perspective on life no matter what. The Latin language course was compulsory, but we were expected to memorize not only the names of all the organs, but also the names describing all the specific features on an individual bone. Our teachers were experts in Latin language, and from them we learned many phrases, both useful and useless. We even sang four verses of Gaudeamus igitur at the ceremony in the beginning and in the end of academic year. On the last verse, our professors would stand up and respectfully nod to us all.\n\nVivat academia,\n\nVivant professores,\n\nVivat membrum quodlibet,\n\nVivat membra quaelibet;\n\nSemper sint in flore!\n\nWhich in English is\n\nLong live the university,\n\nLong live the teachers,\n\nLong live each male student,\n\nLong live each female student;\n\nMay they always flourish!\n\nI knew a good few Latin phrases before, from a handbook I found in my grandmother’s attic. One of my favorites was Memento mori – it sounded very mysterious and somewhat sad to a ten years old curious and life-loving girl. As an antidote to that one, there was Dum spiro spero – While I breathe, I hope.\n\nThis winter was very stormy, and three shipwrecks have become exposed on Tramore beach, Co Waterford, uncovered from sand in February. It happens from time to time. When I finally went to see them ( time, tides and weather didn’t want to cooperate for me), the other two were almost gone, and this big one was half buried in sand once again. Another couple of months, and it will be immersed in the sand until the next bad storm.\n\nI was alone in the whole strand. It was shortly after the midday (the lowest tide), and I quickly took photographs and went back to the car. The rain was getting stronger. I was sitting there, eating my sandwich, and it is when all these University memories came back flooding, must be because of the ribs of that old boat, sticking out of the sand like a skeleton of a long dead animal.\n\nImagine a very young girl with very little experience who finds a book in the attic of an old house, and learns that there is a strange, haunting language in the world, that no one else probably knows! It is what I thought 🙂\n\nIf you read the List of Latin phrases, you will realise that this language is still quite alive and widely used.\n\nSince I have long ago grown out of the age when little girls pretend to be smarter and more sophisticated than they actually are, I don’t use Latin phrases without a very good reason, and don’t overuse any quotes altogether. While I breathe, I hope that my own intuition and common sense will help me out. Not that I totally avoid the internet when I look for advice. Some people’s quotes can be very valuable.\n\nI totally agree with this one 🙂 That Slievenamon climb during which I took the picture, was not easy for me. On the summit, there is a huge pile of stones, a possible entrance to the Celtic underworld… Some people, in hope for a good luck, bring a rock and add to the pile. I hope for a good luck always, but if I want to breathe and stay alive while climbing Slievenamon, I have to forget about taking any rocks up there with me…\n\nOn my way home, the rain eased off and I went for a walk around the Tramore Back Strand estuary. At low tide, the place is all mud and myriads of lugworm castings. Cautious birds gather in the center of the mudflat, and I only saw two Little egrets, and these four geese. I also heard a lark, invisible in the clouds. I always think of my Grandmother’s home when I hear a lark.\n\nI came across a family of Field horsetails – their spore bearing stems come out early, and I love their sturdy look. These plants have been around millions years before the dinosaurs came in the picture. My grandmother used the green stems as a brush to clean her saucepans, and she also said that all the parts of the plant are edible and good for skin and bones.\n\nMy eyesight went down in the last two weeks. I am so sorry that I don’t visit your blogs as often these days. I will catch up when I get better, and I am working on that. The eyesight problems related to unstable blood sugar are nasty and difficult to fight. There is a natural remedy that my grandmother used – bilberry leaves, flowers, and of course berries. Look forward to Summer Solstice, the best time for gathering most of herbs. While I breathe I hope.\n\nHave a wonderful weekend!"
