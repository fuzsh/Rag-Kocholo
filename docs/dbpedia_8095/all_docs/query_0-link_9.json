        "text": "📈 Pharmaceutical #promotion activity in #Ukraine in the first 9 months of 2023 📊 According to the #PromoTest project of #ProximaResearch, the number of mentions of the promotion of #pharmacy products from healthcare professionals increased by 34.8% compared to the same period of the previous year. This is 2.9% less than in the pre-war 2021 📜 In September 2023, the share of mentions of prescription #drug promotion among all mentions of drug promotion reached 51.3%, indicating that pharmaceutical companies are more actively promoting their #prescription drugs, which are traditionally promoted to physicians 👨⚕️ Personal #visits by #medical representatives remain the main channel of promotion 🏥 Among pharmaceutical companies, Teva, Acino, and Berlin-Chemie are the leaders in terms of the number of mentions of promotion 💊 Among drug brands, the leading positions are occupied by Olfen, Sumamed, Decatylen and No-Spa 📎 Full material is already on the website: http://surl.li/mqrhp #pharma #pharmxplorer #analytics #ProximaPromoTest\n\nThe rules for generic drug pricing in provincial/territorial programs in Canada have been modified. The pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance (pCPA) and the Canadian Generic Pharmaceutical Association (CGPA) have agreed to a new three-year pricing scheme (with the option of an extension for a further two years) for generic drugs, effective 1st October 2023. The new agreement adds Quebec to the scheme, amends the Tiered Pricing Framework (TPF), removes two drugs (famciclovir and minocycline) from the pan-Canadian Select Molecules list and adds “non-formulary benefits.” The TPF applies to any generic drug where the current or previously available brand reference product was eligible for reimbursement by any pCPA jurisdiction. The new agreement introduces changes to Tier 1 of the TPF, which comprises single-source generic products. From 1st October 2023, the price will be cut to 55% of the brand reference price three months after the onset of generic competition. There are no changes to tiers 2 or 3. The TPF will apply to new generics that are not formulary benefits but are “publicly funded through a defined and transparent public program.” As of 1st October 2023, new generics funded through the Ontario Exceptional Access Program will also be assessed through the TPF. Additional “defined drug programs” in other jurisdictions may qualify for inclusion in the TPF in the future. #Canada #generics\n\nEurasian Pharma Awards 2023: Olainfarm and Meros Pharm are the winners in the nomination “Partnership of the Year” In 2023 in the competition for the Eurasian Pharma Awards in the nomination “Partnership of the Year” the award was presented to Olainfarm and Meros Pharm.
