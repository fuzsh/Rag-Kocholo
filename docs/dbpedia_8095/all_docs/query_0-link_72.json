        "text": "DUBLIN, May 9, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- The \"Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) Global Market - Forecast to 2025\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\nAccording to analysis, the global Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient market is expected to grow at a high CAGR to reach $307.2 billion by 2025.\n\nAdoption of biologics in disease management and increasing regulatory approvals in the past year, increasing scope of HPAPI market, patent expiration of major drugs, increasing trend of outsourcing and increase in geriatric population are some of the factors driving the market growth. The global API market is mainly segmented by synthesis, by business type, by application and by geography.\n\nAPI market based on synthesis is further divided into synthetic API, Biotech API, and HPAPI. Synthetic API holds a major share in 2018 and is expected to grow at a mid-single digit CAGR from 2018 to 2025. The major factors driving the synthetic chemical API market are patent expiration of synthetic (small molecule drugs), increasing number of small molecules in clinical trials, increasing outsourcing by the pharmaceutical companies, CMOs investments to expand manufacturing facilities, rise in incidence of chronic and age-related diseases, rapid growth in oncology market, technological advancement like cryogenic and continuous flow manufacturing.\n\nBased on the customer, the synthetic API is further divided into branded API and generic API. Branded API accounted for the largest share in 2018 and is expected to grow at a mid-single digit CAGR from 2018 to 2025. Generic API is expected to grow at a high single-digit CAGR from 2018 to 2025, due to Patent expiry of blockbuster drugs, rising healthcare expenses, increasing outsourcing and shift towards the generic medicines led by the government initiatives.\n\nBiotech API is expected to grow at a high single-digit CAGR from 2018 to 2025. Increased investment in R&D by pharmaceutical companies for developing biologic drugs, adoption of biological therapies in disease management, increasing outsourcing, increasing biologics approvals in the past year, increasing chronic and autoimmune illnesses, increasing number of branded drugs going off-patent creating a scope for biosimilars, requirement of novel biologics therapeutics for rare diseases, increasing demand for antibody conjugates are few factors driving the biotech API market. Biotech API is further segmented into monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins, vaccines and others (stem cell therapy and gene therapy).\n\nMonoclonal antibodies accounted for the highest share in 2018 and expected to grow at a double-digit CAGR from 2018 to 2025. Development of next-generation antibodies such as antibody-drug conjugates and rising venture capital investments and applications of monoclonal antibodies are the factors booming monoclonal antibodies market growth.\n\nBased on the customer, biotech API is further divided into biologics and biosimilars. Biologics accounted for the largest share in 2018 and is expected to grow at a high single-digit CAGR from 2018 to 2025. Biologics market is driven globally due to the adoption of biological therapies in disease management, increasing biologics approvals in the past year, increasing chronic and autoimmune illnesses and increasing elderly population globally.\n\nBiosimilars are expected to grow at a mid-double-digit CAGR from 2018 to 2025. Factors driving the biosimilar drug market are patent expiry of biological drugs, low cost compared to biologics health care expenditure, increase in chronic diseases, growing geriatric population, demand for quality healthcare.\n\nHPAPI is expected to grow at a high single-digit CAGR from 2018 to 2025. Rapid growth in the oncology market, low toxicity and lower side effects, technological advancements in HPAPI, increasing outsourcing, increasing the incidence of chronic and age-related diseases are few factors driving the HPAPI market growth.\n\nBased on customer, HPAPI is further divided into branded API and generic API. Branded API is accounted the largest share in 2018 and is expected to grow at a high single-digit CAGR from 2018 to 2025, increased development of targeted therapy APIs, increased investments in the manufacturing of branded HPAPI are the factors driving the market.\n\nGeneric API is expected to grow at a high single-digit CAGR from 2018 to 2025. Patent expiry of blockbuster drugs, rising healthcare expenses and shift towards the generic medicines led by the government initiatives are some of the factors driving the generic HPAPI market.\n\nBy business type, the global API market is divided into captive API and merchant API. Captive market holds major share in 2018 and is expected to grow at a mid-single digit CAGR from 2018 to 2025, captive API is further divided into branded captive API and generic captive API, branded captive API accounted for the largest share in 2018 and is expected to grow at a mid-single- digit CAGR from 2018 to 2025.\n\nMerchant API market is the fastest growing segment with a high single-digit CAGR from 2018 to 2025. Novel drugs patent expiry, high cost of innovative drugs and complications in innovative drug manufacturing are some of the factors driving the growth of the Merchant API market. Merchant API market is further divided into branded merchant API and generic merchant API.\n\nGeneric merchant API accounted for the largest share in 2018 and is expected to grow at a double-digit CAGR from 2018 to 2025. Increasing outsourcing, advanced manufacturing facilities, lack of in-house manufacturing capability, high capital investment and cost of API manufacturing are the factors driving the Merchant API market.\n\nBy therapeutic applications, API market is segmented into infectious diseases, oncology, cardiovascular disorders, central nervous system, a pulmonary disorder, gastrointestinal disorder, endocrine disorders, metabolic disorders, genito-urinary disorders, musculoskeletal disorders and others. In the application segment, Oncology holds a major share in 2018 and expected to grow at a high single-digit CAGR from 2018 to 2025.\n\nIn synthetic API, infectious diseases accounted the largest share in 2018 and is expected to grow at a high single-digit CAGR from 2018 to 2025, oncology is expected to grow at a high single-digit CAGR from 2018 to 2025.\n\nIn biotech API, musculoskeletal disorders accounted the largest share in 2018 and the share is expected to grow at a high single-digit CAGR from 2018 to 2025, oncology is expected to grow at a double-digit CAGR from 2018 to 2025.\n\nIn HPAPI, oncology accounted for the largest share in 2018 and is expected to grow at a high single-digit CAGR from 2018 to 2025. Biotech API and HPAPI is driving the market growth at a faster pace due to rising targeted therapy demand in the last 15 years for the treatment of diseases, mainly in the oncology sector.\n\nActive pharmaceutical Ingredients market by region is segmented as North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and Rest of the world (ROW) where North America holds the largest share in 2018 and is expected to grow at a high single-digit CAGR from 2018 to 2025.\n\nPatent expiration of the major drugs, rising demand for biotech APIs from government and private companies, market entry of biosimilars, increasing the scope of highly potent drugs and increase in the prevalence of chronic diseases such as cancer, musculoskeletal disorder, cardiac disease are some of the major factors driving the North America API market.\n\nAsia-Pacific region is expected to grow at a high single-digit CAGR from 2018 to 2025.
