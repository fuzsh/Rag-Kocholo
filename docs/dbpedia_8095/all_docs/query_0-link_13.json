        "text": "Latviaâ€™s success in the biomedicine sector is the result of effectively combining its strong R&D capabilities with an established manufacturing infrastructure.\n\nThe Institute of Organic Synthesis of Latvia (LOSI) collaborates with world-renowned scientific institutions and pharmaceutical companies. Latvian Biomedical Research and Study Center is the largest molecular biology and biomedical research center in Latvia. And manufacturers such as Grindeks, Olpha (previous Olainfarm), and Silvanol have been developing and exporting drugs to dozens of countries around the world for decades.\n\nThe mission is to establish Latvia as a leading European hub for innovation and research in biomedicine, medical technology, and pharmaceuticals, thereby ensuring the availability of cutting-edge diagnostics, treatment methods, and therapeutics for all patients."
