        "text": "Kindest greetings to the people of India as the nation celebrates 77 years of independence today, on August 15. With our Olpha colleagues and reliable business partners in India, we work towards our common goal of bringing quality healthcare within reach all around the globe! At Olpha, we value the partnerships and cooperative relationships we've built with India and its people. 🤝 We wish you all luck, success, and growth on the Independence Day of India! ☀ #Olpha #WithinReach\n\nHow to turn a huge factory wall into an impressive work of art featuring our new mascot, Olphie? 🤔 Plus, make it all happen in two weeks’ time? ⏳We have answers! To celebrate our rebranding to Olpha, we decided to dedicate a full wall to Olphie, and, to our luck, Kiwie Studio’s talented artists Saim and Ēriks accepted this challenge. 🤝 Miles of sticky tape and cables, some heavy machinery, and countless buckets of paint and spay bottles in all the colours of the rainbow - and voilà – we have one of the largest murals in the Baltics. Watch this humorous short film on the creation of it here: https://ej.uz/x9zj #Olpha #WithinReach\n\nWhen was the last time you praised a young person for their achievements? 💎 August 12 is International Youth Day. The overall aim of this day is to recognise the contribution of young people to education, the environment, and beyond. For several years, Olpha has been providing valuable scholarships to young people and contributing to the production of training materials in the pharmaceutical and chemical fields.📚 In this way, we aim to motivate young people to study, perform well in their studies, and then work in the sector. Young people are the professionals and enthusiasts of the future. 🥼We invite other companies to seize the opportunity to support the efforts and aspirations of youth! We wish every young person to find their heart's calling and follow it with determination, because by doing what you love, you can achieve more! 💪 #Olpha #WithinReach\n\nHow did the grey wall of the Olpha factory become a display of of a valuable message that brings more colours to our employees’ everyday life? 🎨 The mural, one of the largest in the Baltics, was created in collaboration with Kiwie Studio. Juris Bundulis, Chairman of the Board of Olpha, says: ''Thanks to our excellent collaboration with Kiwie Studio, this artwork will remind us and our guests every day that our team is truly capable of miracles and does a great job helping people live better and happier lives!'' Watch the video! #Olpha #WithinReach\n\nMore than 30 new Olpha medications are in the registration process in over 10 EU countries. Our ongoing efforts aim to introduce at least four of these medications to European pharmacies by the end of the year, and more than 20 in 2025. Concurrently, over 100 new therapeutic products are under evaluation to be added to our product portfolio. Driven by the goal of providing better care for patients, each new medicine is developed through extensive research and expert collaboration. The process takes several years before new products can be accessed in Latvian and European pharmacies. #Olpha #WithinReach\n\nTight-knit teams not only perform better, but also feel better at work and are motivated to achieve more. 🎯 That's why every summer we organize Employee Sports Games, inviting everyone who works at Olpha and our group companies TONUS ELAST and Silvanols to take part in a shared team-building adventure. 💎 Spending time together - with friends, family or colleagues - is valuable. 🎥Watch the video and feel the positive emotions, too! #Olpha #WithinReach\n\n\"The most important thing is to be willing and eager to learn,\" with a smile on her face says Lasma Cietvira-Dzene, Deputy Head of Quality Control Unit at Olpha. 💪 Our colleague Lāsma is an inspiration and an example that it is possible to achieve your goals if you are willing to work hard. 🎯 She joined us after gaining experience in the construction materials production sector as a technologist, so starting out in the pharmaceutical sector was a real challenge, which Lāsma handled with great ease. 💎 Get to know Lāsma better: https://ej.uz/d31e Summer is the right time for change.😎 If you too know your professional goals and want to move towards them faster, come and work with us! #Olpha #WithinReach\n\nBehind every Olpha product and accomplishment, there is a team. A team where every single person - their knowledge, skills and character - plays a key role. 👥 We can be proud and honestly say that we have a close-knit and strong team of employees who shape the company's image, drive us towards our goals and, most importantly, dedicate their energy and work to making a healthier tomorrow for others. 🌱 Quality Healthcare - Within Reach! #Olpha #WithinReach\n\nWe are happy to share some vibrant news - the studio created by world -renowned Latvian street artist Kiwie in collaboration with Olpha has created one of the largest murals in the Baltics, which now adorns a wall in our industrial area. 🤩 The 432 square metre mural is designed as a metaphorical construction site, where small versions of our mascot Olphie, representing different professions, unite and work as a team to increase value and common good. ✍️This work of art reflects not only the technological advances of Olpha, but also the company's human approach, the power of team and the importance of community. ☀️Read more on how Latvia's most famous street artist, Kiwie, managed to integrate Olphie into the our environment: https://lnkd.in/dHBirq2H #Olpha #WithinReach"
