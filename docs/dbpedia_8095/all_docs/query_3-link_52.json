        "text": "Medicinal Product Register of Latvia contains information only about those substances and methods, that are prohibited for use in sport and are included in World Anti-doping agency’s Prohibited list. The Register contains information only about those Medicinal Products, which can be purchased in Latvia. The Register does not contain information about food supplements.\n\nIf You search in the Medicinal Product Register of Latvia and do not find the necessary information about use in sports, it does not mean that use of substance or method in sport is not prohibited.\n\nInformation about use in sports to Medicinal Product Register of Latvia is provided by Anti-doping bureau of Latvia. Information for use in sports is included for information purposes, it is not considered as an authoritative information on the status of the substance or method for use in sports. Anti-doping bureau of Latvia shall make all reasonable efforts to provide up-to-date and accurate information but does not accept liability for errors or omissions. Please be informed that there may be special circumstances or situations that require a doctor’s or pharmacist’s consultation. Please note that information about new products or changes in Prohibited list shall be renewed after accession of these products in the register or publication of the Prohibited list on the World Anti-Doping Agency’s website.\n\nThe purpose of the Meds75+ database of medication for older persons is to support the clinical decision-making on the pharmacotherapy of patients over 75 years of age and to improve medication safety in primary health care. The database contains classification and recommendation for almost 500 substance or their combination when used in older persons.\n\nThe Meds75+ database is maintained by the Finnish Medicines Agency, Fimea. Information regarding the use of medicinal products in persons over the age of 75 has been included in the register only for informative purposes. Patients should talk to their doctor before using medicinal products. The State Agency of Medicines does not take responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of this information. If you note any errors, please contact info@zva.gov.lv.\n\nContent of the database\n\nLike in other health care databases, the medicinal substances are classified into categories A, B, C and D. The category indicates how suitable the medicinal substance is for persons over 75 years of age. The categories are based on a multidisciplinary clinical consensus.\n\nA (green): Suitable for the older persons. The medicinal substance can be used as in younger patients. Changes due to aging do not affect the dose or frequency of administration, and the adverse reaction profile is not different from that of younger patients.\n\nB (grey): There is little research evidence, practical experience or efficacy in older persons.\n\nC (yellow): Suitable for older persons, with specific cautions. The medicinal substance can be used by older persons, but the dose might either have to be reduced, or the frequency of administration decreased due to mild or moderate renal insufficiency or a significant risk of interactions or adverse reactions.\n\nD (red): Avoid use in older persons. Use is possible only in exceptional cases or on a one-off basis. Changes due to aging predispose older persons to adverse or dangerous reactions to the drug. The risk of adverse reactions typically exceeds the benefits.\n\nThe legend for each pharmaceutical substance contains information on the effects and dosing of the substance and the most typical adverse reactions and interactions. The legend does not contain indications or contraindications.\n\nUsing the database in health care\n\nThe database is primarily intended for physicians and other health care professionals. It must be borne in mind that individual cases might require the use of category D medicinal products. The pharmacotherapy must be started, changed or discontinued under the supervision of a physician.\n\nMeds75+ data source is Finnish Medicines Agency Fimea (licensed under CC BY 4.0).\n\nData updated on Aug 17, 2024."
