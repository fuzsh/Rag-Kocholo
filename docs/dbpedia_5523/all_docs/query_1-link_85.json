        "text": "From the Ashes of the American Chestnut\n\nThe American chestnut tree has always occupied a special place in American culture. There are “chestnuts roasting over an open fire,” and the Appalachian log cabin built of chestnut, perhaps the most enduring image of Americana there ever was; Abraham Lincoln’s campaign symbol was the chestnut rail fence he had split as a youth, Thanksgiving turkeys were traditionally stuffed with chestnuts, and David Henry Thoreau’s work is replete with odes to the tree: “it was very exciting at that season to roam the then boundless chestnut woods of Lincoln.” The thing is, despite it being hands-down the most important tree in American history, you’ve never eaten an American chestnut, and you’ve never seen an American chestnut tree.\n\nOnce upon a time, you couldn’t have inhabited Appalachia or the Eastern seaboard without constant reminders that this, as Thoreau was fond of pointing out, ‘is chestnut country.’ Chestnut burrs turned every forested area into a minefield of oversized pincushions, and at harvest the chestnut mast (the botanical term for the fruit of forest trees) would cover acres. Early settlers described wading shin-deep through a carpet of fallen nuts. In many places, every home and barn, every pole or split rail fence, would most likely have been made of chestnut. When the first railroad tracks snaked their way across the countryside, they too were made of chestnut. The American chestnut is ideal for logging—it grows straight and true twice as fast as an oak—and is the most rot-resistant tree in North America. It also provides a harvest that keeps pace with orchard trees in terms of taste and nutrition (consider that its closest hardwood “rival,” the oak, has an unreliable mast and produces nuts fit only for livestock).\n\nThe age of the chestnut came to an end in the late 19th century, when the great economic portal between East and West was reopened by agreements between Japan and the United States. Streaming across the Pacific came a wave of drugs, fruits, sugar, cheap labor, and trees: the beloved cherry blossom, the Japanese maple, the Chinese chestnut. Asian varieties of chestnut brought with them a fungus, Cryphonectria parasitica, to which they had evolved a complex genetic resistance.\n\nYou understand where this story is going.\n\nIn the decades following ‘the Chestnut blight,’ over 4 billion trees were destroyed. The fungus enters through an external wound, and once it takes a grip, there is no recovery. It releases oxalic acid, which forms a canker that will cut off all circulation above the point of infection. The tree’s root system may survive for a while, but it will never grow more than a short sprout, and eventually the tree will be killed entirely.\n\nWe have, for over a century, been unsuccessfully combating the spread of Chestnut blight. The fungus was first identified at the Bronx Zoo in 1904, and from there it spread north and south like a wildfire, rampaging across New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts. In 1912, the Governor of Pennsylvania summoned experts from around the country for a conference titled, “to Consider Ways and Means for Preventing the Spread of the Chestnut Bark Disease.” You could say ‘they were too late,’ but the appropriate cliché would be ‘they never stood a chance.’ Cryphonectria parasitica spreads rabidly, up to 50 miles per year, but doesn’t affect other trees like it does the American chestnut. This means the fungus could be dormant throughout an entire forest of diverse hardwood, making it impossible for the native plant to be reintroduced. When the fungus reached North Carolina, opponents dug gigantic quarantine lines through the mountainside, great scars across the Smoky and Appalachian ranges. By the time it reached Georgia, researchers had given up fighting the blight altogether. Botanist Donald Culross Peattie summed up the state of affairs as he watched his beloved North Carolina forests wither and die; “All words about the American Chestnut are now but an elegy for it. This once mighty tree, one of the grandest features of our sylva, has gone down like a slaughtered army.”\n\nToday, ‘surviving specimens’ have their own subsection of the American chestnut Wikipedia page, and it reads like zombie fan-fiction: survivors here or there, small colonies under permanent siege. To give you a sense, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources announced the existence of an American chestnut in 2008, but they’d kept its location secret for almost a decade before that (and they still do). The American chestnut can grow in highly acidic soil, so some trees that took root in outlandish locations—quarries, marshes and coalmines—survived. The only true stand of chestnuts is in West Salem, Wisconsin. This grove was planted beyond the natural chestnut range by an early settler, and thus was unaffected by the first onslaught of the blight. But in 1987 fungus was discovered on a tree there, and to this day the infection is spreading throughout the West Salem stand.\n\nStrange as it may sound, generations from now, this fatal infection of “the American chestnut’s last stand” may be looked upon as the pivotal moment in the long road back from extinction. It was not the vanquishing of the chestnut blight, which has had 27 consecutive winning years since then, but provided the impetus for a series of events that might turn a swan song into a phoenix tale.\n\n* * *\n\nThe infection of the West Salem stand led to a flurry of activity at the nascent American Chestnut Foundation. Perhaps because of its importance in American history, Jimmy Carter became involved in the cause, and the organization attracted other Nobel laureates as well. With research funds available, the ACF undertook the most recent in a long line of academic efforts to develop a blight-resistant chestnut.\n\nThe ACF’s founding President, Phil Rutter, along with a small group of other scientists, had already developed techniques to crossbreed the American and Chinese chestnut. Variations of this have been done for centuries. The reason that the word ‘imp’ means ‘little devil’ is because an imp is the tool used to insert new genetic material into a tree—as in an implant. That was what the devil did; he was the imp that infected the human tree. ACF scientists used the same technique, but with more noble aspirations. The idea was to cross the Chinese and American chestnut, continually breeding the resulting offspring back until they had a seed that was 15/16th American. Although it can never be entirely reliable, they are now able to produce seeds that are 94 percent American chestnut and have picked up enough of the inherited resistance from the Chinese chestnut to survive. The only problem is that you get other, less desirable attributes of the Chinese chestnut, which are unfit for American forests. Chinese chestnuts grow 40-50 feet tall, compared to an American chestnut at 80-100 feet. Chinese chestnuts struggle to endure American winters, and can’t penetrate the canopy of oaks and pines. Though they may preserve a sense of the American chestnut’s majesty (and most of its DNA), the fact remains that it’s a hybrid breed. Perhaps it was this, a desire to save the prelapsarian American chestnut, which inspired the ACF to direct resources towards a parallel research strategy.\n\nWilliam Powell received his PhD from Utah State University in 1986, where he researched “hypovirulence in the chestnut…which is the way it can be controlled by virus.” Dr. Powell is a molecular biologist—he knows how to design a gene —but he still needed someone with the expertise to take that gene and insert it into the tree’s DNA. Enter Chuck Maynard, who received his PhD from Iowa State University earlier in the 80’s after researching tissue implantation in infected trees. Dr. Maynard was already working at the State University of New York’s College of Environmental Science and Forestry when the school committed to researching the American chestnut in 1989.\n\nDr. Maynard wasn’t brought on because of a background with the chestnut; “My original training was in forestry improvement, basically tree breeding. I played around for a long time looking for something that—in the Northeast, you don’t plant a lot of trees—so you’ve got to find something where there’s a good reason to plant it.” For Dr. Maynard, who’d taken on every project he could that looked like it would involve the most tree breeding, it was a no brainer; “the Chestnut Foundation, Phil Rutter, came to drum up interest in his organization…and he just got me fired up. I realized if they were serious about this, they were going to need to plant trees; do the improvement and then plant, plant, plant trees.” The two began working together in 1990, shortly after Dr. Powell started. “Chuck and I got together, and I said, ‘hey, we’ve got good, complimentary techniques. We have a real opportunity to go through with this and develop it.’” The two scientists, with the support of the ACF, their university and the beautiful taxpayers of NY, were set to attempt a new method to save the American chestnut.\n\nTheir research may have been complimentary, but that doesn’t mean they knew how to solve the problem. “The transformation system (the medium to get an engineered gene to regenerate), which was developed in Dr. Maynard’s lab with a colleague from the University of Georgia, took 14-16 years just to get the techniques down—how do you get a gene into the tree?”\n\n“We tried every kind of tissue you can imagine,” says D. Maynard. “We started with leaves, leaf tissue, because if you could get that to work you’re golden. That was a bust though.”\n\n“We spent over four years finding out that wouldn’t work.”\n\n“Then we spent two years testing the shoot tip tissue, just sliced up like bologna. I remember when our graduate student came in and said, ‘we’re going to need to make 14,000 of these to get one to work,’ and he was just don…he was a little discouraged.”\n\nWhat they eventually succeeded with was the somatic embryo. You have to take the burrs—“nasty little things, like baby porcupines”—and then remove the pollinated seeds, sterilize them, and put them in a tissue culture. 95% of the seeds either die or are contaminated. Then 95% of those survivors die in the second round of regeneration. “About one in a 1,000 is a viable embryo, but then you have one. The next week there’s ten, and in a year you have a thousand. It’s a beautiful thing; they regenerate beautifully.” It’s with an air of intense excitement that Dr. Maynard continues: “and then you’ve gotta go out and plant’em. Plant them in the real world.”\n\nOne of the things that makes the endeavor so attractive to Dr. Maynard is also what makes it so daunting: chestnut trees used to represent a quarter of all the Eastern forests, and now they’re literally restarting from the ground up. Others would see that as an eye-popping economic opportunity, but Dr.’s Powell and Maynard are indifferent to the millions of dollars that could accompany the return of the chestnut (which once represented over half of the entire economic value of the American hardwood forests east of the Rockies): “we made an agreement in the 90’s not to patent any of the technology. We work at the College of Environmental Sciences and Forestry. We have the point of view that restoration is a good thing, and that’s what motivates us.”\n\n* * *\n\nIf the American chestnut is to be saved, it’s remarkable to think about what had to transpire to make that possible: the threads of history and individual motivation. Dr. Powell became a graduate student the exact same year the American Chestnut Foundation came into existence. And he happened to be studying hypovirulence under one of the handful of plant pathologists on Earth who worked on American chestnuts. That moment in time had to overlap perfectly with the infection of the West Salem stand, perhaps the last opportunity the American chestnut would have to catch the attention of research grant-givers. A year earlier and Dr. Powell would still be busy with his post-grad work; a year later and he would have already taken on a new project. The university that picked up the research happened to be home to Dr. Maynard, one of a few experts who could develop the techniques to take that genetically engineered embryo and turn it into a sprouting plant. It took two scientists willing to work through a decade and a half of failed effort, who are so committed to forest restoration that they would dedicate their entire careers, their entire lives, to coming up with something they may never actually see in the real world. “It’s going to be upwards of five years before we pass the regulatory process,” says Dr. Powell about their upcoming EPA testing, “but the timeline for this, to even get close to repopulating the American chestnut range, is at least 80 to 100 years.” A feat accomplished by proud inventors who would forsake profiting off their hard-won technology—who are in fact disdainful of the idea, eliciting an indignant nasal sound from Dr. Maynard when I bring up the topic, and a quiet but enthusiastic “that’s right” when Dr. Powell banishes it. It took two scientists who would spend 25 years getting themselves to this point, and who know that ahead of them there could lie another 5, 10, 15 years of nurturing plant seeds, developing their resistance and biodiversity until they’re ready to repopulate in nature. For a century, small bands of plant biologists and botanists have kept alive the dream of a reclaimed American forest, carefully guarded and passed down like an Olympic torch across generations of graduate students.\n\nIn this day and age, there’s something awesome about progress not driven by entrepreneurialism. To see people who have committed their lives to something, something they may never see come to fruition in the real world, something that may very well fail, because of the sheer wonder of it. One day, Americans may once again wander the chestnut woods that are still alive in the writings of Thoreau; the trout and small mammals and songbirds and insects that relied on the American chestnut may reverse the long, slow fading process they’ve experienced over the past century. When I ask what dreams they have for this research, their thought is only of what it might mean to some future generation, and of what the American chestnut has always meant to this country:\n\nI like to envision a landowner planting a grove of American chestnuts, away from a big forest maybe so they could really grow tall and wide, the way it was centuries ago when every town was built around a massive chestnut tree: ‘the corner of Chestnut and Main St.,’ you know? And it’s a huge tree, like a redwood crossed with a great, flowering willow, and you can harvest the nuts during the orchard season for 20 to 30 years, then harvest the wood, and then let it re-sprout and start the cycle over again. Wouldn’t that be something?\n\nRepent or Perish\n\nThe Westboro Baptist Church is one of the most reviled organizations in America. If you don’t know the group by name, you’d probably recognize their “God Hates Fags” picket signs, a fixture at military funerals and national tragedies—such as Sandy Hook and Columbine—for the past two decades. Fred Phelps, who passed away late last week, built the Church from the ground up after the Southern Baptist Convention, which had ordained him and promoted his early work as a pastor, rejected his ministry. Phelps’ story is fascinating and well-documented: a civil rights lawyer and legitimate leader in dismantling Jim Crow laws who simultaneously (until his disbarment in 1979 for abusing witnesses) built a lathered-at-the-lip hate group.\n\nBut when I reached out to The WBC a couple months ago, I had no interest whatsoever in speaking with Fred Phelps. In many ways, I don’t even think Phelps is the most important person in the story of his church. The WBC consists mainly of Phelpses (Fred had 1 wife, 13 children, 54 grandchildren and 7+ great-grandchildren), but perhaps the most zealous acolyte is a man named Steve Drain. Drain was the first disciple, the first church member to convert with no ties of blood or marriage to the Phelps clan. And there’s reason to believe he is now, and has been for some time, the functional leader of the Westboro Baptists.\n\nSince Phelps’ death, there has been a surge in articles considering the future of the Church. The problem reporters face covering the WBC is the same they face covering the CIA; nobody will talk to them. The WBC is notoriously opaque, an open congregation of carefully shut lips. Most coverage of the internal goings-on of the church come from the Phelps family members who have renounced, and been renounced by, their cultish relatives. Nathan Phelps abandoned his father’s church and his family in 1976, but it wasn’t until Nathan posted a note on Facebook that the outside world knew that Fred Phelps was on his deathbed. And not just on his deathbed, but excommunicated! As dribbles of teenagers grow up and join the exodus out of the cult, they bring with them scraps of information, shared amongst their fellow estranged family. Nathan says that for years his ailing father was increasingly detached from his church. Not detached from their mission, I don’t want to give the impression he renounced his lifetime of vile beliefs, because he didn’t, but in terms of who controlled the day to day actions and positions of the Church, his role was diminishing. Shirley Phelps-Roper, Fred’s daughter and the one-time spokesperson of the Church, was thought by many to be the second most powerful person in the organization. That was until the early 2000’s, not long after Drain and his family converted, when Shirley’s authority was crushed by a newly formed, all-male board of elders. Drain became the official Church spokesman, and has continued the Phelps family tradition of not addressing the media beyond an endless drum-beat of homophobic slurs. Nathan Phelps insists Drain is the one responsible for his sister’s downfall and his father’s excommunication,\n\n’I know it sounds kind of crazy,’ Nate says, but the board (of elder)’s apparent toppling of Shirley prompted Phelps to push for more humane treatment among fellow congregants. And that suggestion—that a group of people famed for spewing vitriol and hatred in the name of God should be kinder to one another—was apparently what led to Phelps’ excommunication. While Nate may not have all the details on what was said or done and when, he is positive that there is one man at the center of all this upheaval: Steve Drain.\n\nReporters struggle to tap internal Church members, which is why that article, and many similar to it, end with the frowny-face disclaimer; “Neither Drain nor anyone from the Westboro Baptist Church returned emails and calls requesting comment for this story.”\n\n* * *\n\nIn 2013, before the spotlight generated by Fred Phelps’ death, it wasn’t difficult to strike up a correspondence with Steve Drain. Following Shirley’s ouster, emails to the WBC media requests address, ChristTheHeadAndCornerstone@wbcstuff.com, went directly to Drain. When he jumped from that address to media.reply@GodHatesAmerica.com, he continued our back and forth. He was reluctant to go into personal matters, palpably reticent of having an extended conversation with a reporter. But I’m not a reporter, I’m just Joe Schmo with a tumblr, and he seemed to take a liking to me, “you’re just mind-questing. There’s nothing wrong with that.”\n\nFor a man who was sucked into the bowels of an organization that mindlessly spews hatred, Drain is alarmingly intelligent. That’s actually a feature, not a bug, for WBC leaders. 11 of Phelps’ 13 children have law degrees (the organization has financed itself through an endless series of First Amendment law suits), his daughter personally argued before the Supreme Court, and many of their converted followers have advanced degrees as well. Drain was finishing up his PhD at the University of Kansas when he first met Phelps. Drain had received a grant to produce a documentary, which he intended to use to castigate Phelps and other “hatemongers.” How he went from being an indifferent Christian and Philosophy PhD to moving his family to Topeka, KS and becoming Phelps’ most dedicated follower is a mystery. When I voice my skepticism, he chuckles appreciatively, “I told my wife, ‘behold, I have put before you an open door which no one can shut, because you have a little power, and have kept my name…Revelation 3:8,’ that this guy was the real deal, really onto something, onto a truth.”\n\nIt’s easy to see how people can become entranced with the church: the community, the sense of purpose, the calm certainty with which they approach every aspect of their lives. I was shocked by how reasonable the man seemed. Westboro Baptists may sling verbal mud, but they’re passionately non-violent, and members always turn the other cheek when assaulted, which happens regularly. It also leads to more money in court rulings. When I point to the group’s litigious history, Drain ruffles his feathers for the first time, “if we sued every time someone threw a d-battery at us, it’s all we’d ever do.” Drain insists the lawsuits are only about securing their right to protest (famously held up in an 8-1 Supreme Court decision following their picketing of a dead Marine’s funeral). When I ask how the group can afford to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on travel every year, Drain says, “it’s a deep, dark secret…we work. Everybody who goes to the Church is gainfully employed. Unlike the rest of America, we don’t put our disposable income up our noses.” For much of our conversation, which focused on his personal story and not the Church itself, Drain seemed out of touch, but not offensive. Like a genial grandparent whose prejudices feel more quaint than shocking.\n\nAnd he has the same talent for obfuscation that you’d find with spokespeople on Capitol Hill. When I ask about the Church’s contested hierarchy, he says, “there are no disputes, our leader is the Lord Jesus Christ and we are all his servants.” Months later, in a brief response to me regarding the question of Phelps’ unconfirmed excommunication, Drain is even more reminiscent of a political flack; “membership issues are private.” Besides a habit of punctuating every sentence or two with a Bible verse, almost like an unconscious tic, he could be a spokesman for anything.\n\nUntil, of course, the question of homosexuality is broached. I’d gotten used to Drain’s soft-spoken manner, and the way he grapples with swear words in just the same adorable way conservative people from the Midwest do (“oh, eff,” “oh, gosh darn”). So it caught me off guard, even though I knew it was coming, when “faggots” rolled effortlessly, joyously off his lips, “these faggots, it’s that they’re so proud of being faggots, ‘and when the lord saw it, he abhorred them, because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters,’ And society congratulates them for it…there’s no rapist pride parade, there’s no adulterers pride parade, and if there was we’d be picketing that too.”\n\nWhen I point out that the word faggot never appears in the Bible, and that he’s going out of his way to be offensive, “you can oppose gay marriage or homosexuality and not use the word faggot, though, right?” His response is succinct, “they’re dykes and faggots.” I use this moment to bridge into the WBC’s designation as a “hate group” by the Southern Poverty Law Center. He embraces the aphorism; “the concept of an all-loving God is one of the worst myths perpetuated by the sham ministries. We are also called upon to hate, ‘you shall not follow the customs of the nation which I will drive out before you, for they did all these things, and therefore I have abhorred them, Leviticus.’ God calls upon us to hate the wretched.”\n\n“What about your family?”\n\n“They are compelled by the same feelings as me.”\n\n“You love them completely?”\n\n“Yes, they are in the light of God.”\n\n“What about Lauren?”\n\n*click* the call is dropped.\n\nBorn and raised in Tampa Bay, Drain’s daughter Lauren was an uneasy fit at the church, and the only young person exposed to life outside the church’s sphere. She kept in touch with people from home, sneaking out to make calls and contacting them over the internet. After seven years, she was shunned from the community for her noncompliance. She was dropped off at a cheap motel, and when she saw her family around Topeka they ignored her entirely.\n\nSteve calls me back a minute later, “sorry about that, service out here isn’t great, I’m driving through fields.” A heavy silence hangs, an invitation to continue. His car, which had been audibly jouncing along through unpaved fields throughout the entire interview, has come to a stop.\n\n“Is there anything about your past life, before the church, that you miss? Is there anything you gave up?”\n\n“There are some things about the way I lived my life that I regret. And that’s called shame, which is valuable. Shame is the thing that will change a man. In the Bible it’s called repentance.”\n\n“And there’s no people you miss or love outside of the church?”\n\n“In scripture it says how can two people walk together if they are not agreed? The message is not to be unequally yoked; you can’t put a donkey and oxen in the same yoke and plough a field. I have associates and people I’m friendly with, you seem nice enough, sure…but I really have no interest in spending time with people when I have no interest in their never-dying souls.”\n\nThe call ended a short while later, but I never got past that moment when I brought up his daughter, lost to him in the material world and bound for hell. I think of his other children, and the way they must have hung their heads, just like Dad said to, instead of acknowledging their older sister’s existence. Mostly I think about that lost minute when our call “dropped,” hearing her name aloud, coming to a stop amidst the cornfields stretching off into the distance, a moment all alone but for the ghost of his daughter. Looking back on what was by any standards a nauseating interview, that moment stood out to me like a beacon, the only hope I have that a sliver of humanity remains, like the wisp of humanity that lurks behind Kafka’s “monstrous vermin” in The Metamorphosis.\n\n“Do you have any hope for repentance, for people outside the Church, for Lauren?”\n\n“The thief on the cross, he was a thief all his life, but he was saved by the sincerity of his repentance. Indeed, even whores have hope for repentance.”\n\nIndeed.\n\nThe Essential Geography\n\nThe Cartography and Geographic Information Society is the most important society of its type in North America. Their annual awards are the most prestigious in the field, and in recent years the winner of the coveted Best in Show prize has tended to go to a team with institutional support, deep funding, and access to privileged data sets. In 2005, 2006 and 2009, the winners all came out of National Geographic, with the US Census Bureau taking top honors in 2007 and the Central Intelligence Agency in 2008. However, in 2010 this institutional reign came to an end when the Best in Show award went to Imus Geographics’ The Essential Geography of the United States.\n\nImus Geographics is Dave Imus, a 56 year-old man working in a small studio in a farmhouse outside Eugene, Oregon. His process, probably a shade different from what goes in to mapmaking at National Geographic or the CIA, involves cutting drafts with an x-acto knife atop a glass-covered desk, five-foot high floor lamps perched atop the desk to keep from casting an irregular shade, followed by intensive work plugging his model into Adobe. The only help he gets (besides the emotional and material support from his partner) comes from Pat Dunlavey, a fellow cartographer, who supplied much of the data that’s built into The Essential Geography.\n\nRespected in professional circles, but with little purchase in the world of commercial cartography, Imus spent years at the top of his trade—he’s been a regular at the CaGIS awards for decades—despite struggling financially. “It was tough. The things I wanted to do didn’t exactly have commercial appeal. The State of Alaska? The Wallowa Mountains? Chugach State Park?” Imus settles in to the assumption, and it’s an assumption that in some ways defines his life, that I have any concept of the intricacies of American geography, “They were places I was fascinated with and were crying out for decent maps, but the actual business side was a real struggle. Until that article, which helped.”\n\n“That article” was a 2012 profile of Imus in which Slate declared his masterwork, “The Greatest Paper Map of the United States You’ll Ever See.” It’s a claim that’s gone largely uncontested. 4 feet wide and 3 feet tall, The Essential Geography of the United States looks more like a woven tapestry than a paper wall map. Most of the coverage of Imus’s piece in 2010 begins with something along the lines of, “from a distance, it doesn’t seem so different from a Rand McNally map…” but that’s utter nonsense: a rhetorical trick that allows the writer to jump into the textural landscape of the map, the way looking at it closely feels like traveling through a microscope. Even from afar the differences between this map and a school-standard Rand McNally wall map cannot be overstated. Consider Rand McNally’s orange, lemon and raspberry states, like broken pez pieces, densely crisscrossed cities in the northeast arranged so New York looks as mountainous as Wyoming, the Mississippi River indistinguishable from the state boundary.\n\nWhat Imus manages to convey about the United States even from a distance is staggering. You can see how America unfolded, the population moving along rivers and sprouting up at water sources, or how the continental divide floods the Pacific Northwest and sends up redwoods, while to the East extend the Dakota Badlands, flat and desolate all the way south to Texas. There’s the Pacific Ocean drop-off, like walking off a cliff, while the Atlantic merges with its coast over miles of shoals and sandbar. The East, dense and green, and the West a wrinkled cauldron of seismic activity.\n\nWhat’s even more incredible about The Essential Geography is the fact that, upon leaning in slightly and refocusing your eyes, each state is revealed to be its own complex fresco. Art and information flow together like one of Leonardo da Vinci’s anatomy sketches. That may sound hyperbolic, like the hyperbole of a Slate blog declaring it “The Best Ever Map of America,” but all I can offer is: explore it for yourself. It will take you one minute to realize that this map, portraying the same picture in the same amount of space as a typical high school geography map, belongs in every classroom in the country.\n\nThat is a personal, catalyzing force for Imus, “America has a fundamental problem with geography. And when I say fundamental, I mean right down to the literal maps on the wall.” His point can be confirmed for the first claim at least; American geography knowledge is dismal. A 2010 study found that only 20% of all 12th graders were at or above proficient levels in geography. After repeated prodding—his instincts are to be soft-spoken, but he also has a bounding kind of enthusiasm that is easy to nudge—Imus says about National Geographic and Rand McNally educational maps, “Oh fine, you really want me to step in it, huh? How do I say this without sounding like sour grapes? Well, they’re publishing geographically illiterate maps for a geographically illiterate nation. Rand McNally got into this by selling maps at gas stations as props to buy crap.”\n\nImus spent over 6,000 hours crafting this map, “and that’s a conservative estimate.” Seven days a week for almost two straight years, “it pretty much consumed me. Something like ten hours a day, every day, and it never turned off. You know how it is, (no Dave, I don’t) always taking notes, it’s never off your mind. There are over 10,000 typefaces on that map, and I tested each one individually. Some for days.” That’s what it takes to complete something as delicate and involved as The Essential Geography of the United States. Imus isn’t driven; he is compelled, Sisyphus humping boulders. But beneath the relentless energy, it’s also clear that Imus understands his efforts to change the way America thinks about geography will never come to pass, “a museum I visited a couple years ago had this display of ‘historic drafting tools,’ and it was the instruments I was trained on. That moment reverberated. These things, this way of measuring the rivers and the forests and the curvature and texture of the Earth, which is a big part of what I love, are gone. Great mapmakers now are the people who are wizards at manipulating data, and they are remarkable, but I feel like I almost have more of a farmer’s connection to the land.”\n\nHis work is esteemed, but Imus represents a kind of cartography that is fast fading from the world. The word “cartography” is itself a useful metaphor. Coined by the French in the mid-19th century, the term harkens back to the Renaissance, when mapmaking was the international symbol of power. It was Armstrong planting an American flag on the moon, or Edmund Hillary summiting Everest. We rule because we have seen what nobody before us has seen, and with that comes the power to shape the world. When European colonizers wanted to cow foreign populations, they sent cartographers (with gunpowder and syphilis, yes, but cartographers all the same). This romantic notion of cartography, romantic in both the Latinate and swash-buckling sense, no longer exists; “I like to explore. That’s generally how I come upon new projects: just exploring, hiking, seeing places. And something will call out to be mapped and understood. But that’s not really how this work is done anymore. It’s like being a photographer who only uses film. Or a travel agent, god forbid.”\n\n“Cartography” is disappearing from the titles of scholarly publications and university courses in favor of “Geographic Information Systems.” The CaGIS was just “The American Cartographer” until 1990, one year before the World Wide Web made its debut. There is a new world out there that must be mapped and understood. As we speak, this world is springing up unseen around us: whole new cities of information, a landscape that stretches across satellites, cell phones and information hubs instead of the physical planet. This is the frontier that calls to a rising generation of would-be cartographers; “geology and geometry are ok, but we’re really looking for Javascript.”\n\nA year ago, Apple acquired a start-up venture created by two cartographic Software Developers. The company, WiFiSLAM, developed technology that triangulates using WiFi and cellular signals to accurately target people indoors. If GPS is off by ten meters on a flat map, like in your car, it’s not an issue, but if you’re trying to locate someone in a building that could mean a range of 6-8 floors. This is the cartography of the future, and it’s important work. What’s being done by young cartographers today could lead to a network of self-piloting automobiles, the ability to virtually construct a 3-D, fully-explorable environment, or emergency systems that locate and give extraction routes to earthquake victims. I bring this up because it isn’t necessarily wrong that Dave Imus’ species of cartography is going extinct. He has lost in the free market of ideas, and other scientists, artists and engineers will receive the patronage.\n\n* * *\n\n100 years after the Sistine Chapel was completed, the Pope wanted to commission a project, encompassing the entire 120-meter long gallery leading to the Chapel, to celebrate the power of the Church. He ended up having Ignazio Danti, a priest and astronomer, cover the room in 40 maps depicting different places and resources under the Church’s influence. Once upon a time, the skills and dedication Imus brings to his craft would have made him the envy of the entire scientific and artistic community: like Priest Ignazio, whose work will be a part of the human legacy, nestled amongst Machiavelli’s Chapel and “The Raphael Rooms.” Plenty more cartographers will earn their place in history: mapping the virtual world humanity is weaving out of Silicone, working with Geneticists to map the human mind and genome, re-conceptualizing maps of space as humanity prepares for a very real future in which we mine asteroids. But Dave Imus will not go down in history. Rand McNally maps will still decorate the walls of American classrooms, as neon-colored as they are uninformative. And Imus will still be hawking perhaps the greatest map ever made by an American, one of the keenest examples of science and art coming together from my lifetime, for $12.95 folded, $39.95 laminated so he can afford to keep the studio lights on.\n\n“I could do something else. But no, I couldn’t. Knowledge comes from maps. People aren’t born with it; it has to be given to them through geography. Not just the physical world, but cultural. In this space that you have, this blank canvas, how do you encapsulate what it means to be from Portland? The rivers, the forests, the roads, the monuments, population and data, how does that turn into a work that has clarity and really says something about the place and the people. It’s the fabric of the land and water and living things we exist in, and using that to capture something about New York City. It’s not really the world that’s being mapped nowadays, but it’s just so beautiful. It’s so beautiful to me.”\n\nThe Story of Miracle Village: a Community of Sex Offenders\n\nIn the mid-1990’s, the last leper colony in the United States, the Carville Center, was closed down. Nowadays only a handful of leprosy cases are reported each year, but once upon a time it was a relatively common diagnosis that meant a life of forced subjugation. Patients lived under mandatory quarantine, and out of a combination of fear and shame many of those diagnosed with the disease abandoned their names when they went to the colony. The Carville Center’s graveyard is marked by headstones that bear numbers or pseudonyms; even as they were dying victims would go to great lengths to avoid summoning their families. Around the turn of the 19th century, Carville started to rebuild itself around the motto “a place of refuge, not reproach; a place of treatment, not detention.” The men, women and children who lived there, some with no choice, confined by their disease, others out of a devotion to charity or medical research, would go on to change the course of history for people suffering from leprosy. Those who called this strange place home spent the next century battling one of the most pernicious stigmas associated with disease that ever existed in this country (at least until AIDS ripped a hole in the American psyche in the 1980’s). I begin with this brief account of the Carville leprosy center, now a museum and medical research facility, because at the turn of the 21st century a different kind of leper is seeking to accomplish a similarly daunting feat.\n\nI recently spent a day on the phone with Patrick Powers, Chad Stoffel and Ted Rodarm, the three senior directors of an experiment that goes by the name “Miracle Village.” All three of them were convicted of sexually assaulting children between the ages of 12 and 15.\n\n“In this country, we are lepers.”\n\n“Lepers never broke the law.”\n\n“I never said that, and I don’t say we didn’t deserve the time we served. But we’re like lepers because…because we know that feeling of…because every time somebody realizes what we are, we’re back in prison.”\n\nFor Patrick, Chad and Ted, leaving prison meant returning to a free society that was as much a penitentiary as the cells they left behind. For people on the sex offenders registry, the world is a minefield that must be carefully navigated. Does your walk to work bring you within 500 yards of a school or park? Can you take public transportation when loitering near bus stops is a crime? If your grocery store is in the same shopping center as a Toys R’ Us, do you have to find another option? And if you think trying to maneuver through the strictly regulated channels society allows you to occupy is difficult, wait until you look for somewhere to live. Chad talked to me about the difficulties he and others faced finding a home once they left prison, “there was no landlord who wanted me, no town that would take me. When I finally found a place where I could legally live, the neighborhood built a playground so I would be forced to move.” The laws regarding legal residences for sex offenders are constructed so that any community that doesn’t want to deal with having documented pedophiles in their neighborhood can easily force them to leave (sounds pretty reasonable, right?). It requires the smallest amount of red tape that could be cut: declare an open lot a park, erect a playground, switch a bus route to have it stop within half a mile of the offender’s home, the options are nearly limitless. The obvious problem is that when a community is given the choice, nobody will let a sex offender enter their neighborhood. This is an issue that most citizens are content to ignore and lawmakers approach like they would a rabid grizzly bear. So what options are left to the released convicts?\n\nFrom this state of desperation was born one of the great, little-heard-of social policy experiments in America today.\n\nA place of refuge, not reproach; a place of treatment, not detention.\n\nPatrick, Chad and Ted knew there had to be others, legions of others, in the same situation: people who were on the verge of being institutionalized not because they violated parole or broke the law, but because they literally had nowhere else to go. What they needed was an isolated chunk of land and, like leper colonies, the backing of a religious institution. Soon they had attracted the notice of Pastor Richard Witherow. It was Pastor Witherow who saw the potential for a 21st century Carville Center, an opportunity to redeem the fallen and depraved.\n\nWitherow’s own history is ripe for Freudian analysis. Until his death in 2012, he had been open about being sexually abused by family members as a young boy. At age 18, Witherow impregnated his 14-year-old girlfriend. He immediately proposed to the young woman (ahem…no, girl), but was arrested when the clerk filling out their marriage papers realized what had happened. The judge showed mercy to Witherow, releasing him with strict orders to do right by his young wife (the two were happily married until her death in 1978). It’s a lesson Pastor Witherow had evidently not forgotten when three men approached him with their own desperate case. With Witherow’s ministry providing the legitimacy—some might say façade of legitimacy—to the state, the group became an approved provider of post-prison care. Now all they needed was a place to call home.\n\nTheir chosen location was a small island in an ocean of Florida sugar cane. They struck a deal with the organization that owned the residential area, which then forced most of the tenants out of their apartments. The community was created in the 1960’s to house seasonal sugar cane workers, and a contingent of elderly Jamaicans who once worked those fields share the space without complaint (or at least without any official complaint to local government).\n\n“The Jamaicans and everybody don’t mind us being here. In fact, everything we’ve heard from them in the years we’ve all lived in Miracle Village has been positive. We provide a lot of services to them, help with anything they need. I know people probably would scoff, but we’re great neighbors.” This isn’t your typical inane pleasantry; the sex offenders of Miracle Village are obsessively good neighbors by necessity, not choice. Ex-offenders live in a world where one neighbor moved to attend a town-hall meeting can mean the difference between having a home and being on the street. Imagine managing a restaurant that’s legally forced to close if someone leaves a bad Yelp review. And so the ex-offender tenants are constantly working to keep a group of elderly Caribbean immigrants satisfied.\n\nAs time goes on though, the ratio of ex-cons is constantly widening. What started out as an ambitious project to house one or two dozen released offenders quickly became scores, and it may not be long now before they start measuring in the hundreds. “We couldn’t believe the response. So many people were in the same situation as us.”\n\n“So many,” another coordinator echoed, “and every single one of them was desperate.” But rejecting desperate men has fast become just as integral a part of the group’s mission as helping others find a home. Miracle Village has a lower acceptance rate than Harvard, and with hundreds of applications coming in every week, those spots are getting more and more difficult to obtain. Some applicants are no-brainers for a review committee that is obsessed with managing the community’s public image. The resident whose story they happened to discuss in detail was a young man named John, who was sent to jail at age 18 when his 16 year-old girlfriend’s devoutly religious parents caught them having sex. A high school senior caught in bed with his girlfriend, a junior: ruined forever. There but for the grace of god go I.\n\nJohn was brought to court, where he was informed that he was not in fact having consensual sex with his girlfriend because she was months shy of having the legal right to consent to an adult. He spent what should have been his college years locked in prison. When he was released, John was unable to return to his family’s home, which was around the block from a local elementary school. His family considered moving, but Florida’s housing market had just disintegrated and their savings evaporated with their home value. John, who had been released on good behavior before his sentence was up, decided he would return to prison to relieve the strain on his family. Fortunately it was at this point that he was brought to the attention of Miracle Village. Now he has a place of his own and the group has helped him secure a menial job. His mother is well known around Miracle Village, and comes by regularly to cook large meals and help keep his home clean between bouts of tears, “although there’s less of that now.”\n\nIn every aspect of their life, the men running Miracle Village tread a fine line between salvation and despair. They’re eager for interviews and will bend over backwards to accommodate anyone who will help spread the word about their community. And yet they live in constant fear of scrutiny. Local media coverage of the project, even before it was off the ground, led state and national congressmen to unleash a barrage at the unprepared ex-cons. Representative Alcee Hastings (D-FL) was quoted by the local paper saying, “I’ll be damned if I’ll let this go down without a fight.” Residents of the apartment complex who were being forced to move filed a class action lawsuit. Mayor Wayne Whitaker told NBC, “there’s just too many living in one place…it’s a little unnerving.” But Witherow, a master of media and exposure in his own way, managed to contain the local publicity—even generating a certain amount of support and donations in the early stages of the process—while keeping his fledgling support group under the radar of national news. There is one and only one thing that can truly put an end to Miracle Village now. It haunts the future of the community like it haunts the past of the people living there.\n\nSomeday, an ex-con tenant of Miracle Village will repeat his crime. This is not hypothetical, it is inevitable. There isn’t an adequate amount of research on sex-offender recidivism, so there’s no consensus on what percentage of ex-cons will repeat their crimes. However, as documented in this WSJ round-up of academics who study the subject, even the most optimistic figures hover around 50%, and some studies argue that when the timeline for repeat offending is extended it could be upwards of 90%.\n\nThose statistics may be discouraging, or perhaps nauseating is the correct term, but for groups dedicated to post-prison care and the social issues surrounding sex offenders, Miracle Village is one of the first true rays of light to pierce the storm. Patrick, Chad and Ted appreciate the help they get from these organizations, but they utterly fail to appreciate the significance of what they’ve created; “yeah, in recent years we have seen I guess an influx of help from outside groups. They help us make sure everything is in line, with us bringing in candidates and keeping up with our administrative work and keeping track of things. Even helping us with funds or dealing with the state.” I suspect they don’t fully understand that Miracle Village, what for them is a daily struggle for dignity and existence, is being observed from on high like a mouse running through a maze. What they call “helping with administrative work and keeping track of things,” is for academics and social workers a real-time experiment that could change the face of American policies. The fact that Miracle Village has never had a tenant repeat his crime is an astonishing deviation from statistical reality (a brief aside: I’ve been using “his” as a pronoun throughout, but it is worth mentioning that there’s one female sex offender at Miracle Village). This is something American policy and culture has long considered a disease that can only be treated through detention or quarantine. How do we rationalize that approach in the face of Miracle Village’s staggering non-recidivism? And how do we rationalize Miracle Village’s success in the face of decades of contradictory research?\n\nLike vultures following a herd in the desert, activist groups, locals and lawmakers are waiting to pounce on that first creature to fall by the wayside. They don’t need to take an active role; time and nature work their will in the end. The coordinators of Miracle Village feel the pressure of that weighing on them every day. “We have psychological and spiritual assistance available to everyone who wants, and for most there’s some mandatory therapy. But really it’s on us. We put a lot of pressure on ourselves. To be a support network and also to bring in the right candidates…we have to find those candidates where this is their past, not their present or future. We have to.”\n\n“We have to.”\n\n“We just have to.”\n\nSomething I found interesting is that these three men have successfully identified subcategories within the generic “sex offender” label. For instance, we all understand intuitively that there’s a difference between John (the young man who unjustly went to jail for sleeping with his girlfriend) and a man who violently rapes a stranger. And, yet, they are lumped into the same category by American legal policy. People don’t want to parse pedophiles; they don’t want to recognize the shades of grey when it’s so easy to condemn them all to hell. But at Miracle Village a rule was instituted when it came to applicants: no diagnosed pedophiles and no violent repeat-offenders against strangers.\n\nWhen they talk about diagnosed pedophiles and violent repeat-offenders, a tone of scorn and disgust I hadn’t heard or expected comes through from all three men. Every other word they said during our hours on the phone was supplicating, laced with such a sense of self-shame that I was embarrassed to witness it. But when talking about these forbidden subcategories of sex offender there was genuine malice.\n\nPatrick Powers went to jail in the early 1990’s for molesting 11 teen and pre-teen boys and girls. He was a club racquetball coach, and besides fondling students he would encourage children to have sex while he watched from behind a peephole in a wall. When he left jail there was a legal squabble over whether a state had the right to banish someone. The judge ruled that the county could ban Powers for the good of the children, but Florida had no legal right to banishment, “it’s not the Middle Ages where the king has the right to banish someone…we can’t expect our neighbors to be dumping places.”\n\nI asked Powers as we were wrapping up what he thought would happen to the violent repeat offenders and diagnosed pedophiles, who are likely to be shut out of any positive advancements that come about for sex offenders as a result of the work done in Miracle Village.\n\n“I do think about it, but you know, it’s hard to feel sorry for them.”\n\nHacktivists, 3-D Printers and Undetectable Firearms: The Tech Underworld’s Bloody Horizon\n\nWhen I first spoke with Cody Wilson back in May, I asked him, “Are you prepared for this? Are you worried? There are people—regulators, legislators, lobbyists and people in every branch of government—who look at the work you’re doing…and they’re thinking prison.” His answer: “Yes, of course. Of course I am.” I made a note on my transcript of that interview, “sharp intake. He sounds like I just hit him with a shovel.” Six months later I ask Cody Wilson the exact same question and he literally laughs out loud, “Worried of what, the State Department?! I’ve seen the cards they’re holding.”\n\n* * *\n\nAs a 24-year-old law student at the University of Texas, Cody Wilson took up a programming project that would lead to him being one of the most important figures in what I like to call the “Libertarian Tech Revolution.” It would also land him on Wired’s list of the “15 Most Dangerous People in the World,” a group that includes such luminaries as Bashar Al-Assad and Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman (who is credited with a recent, precipitous drop in Mexico’s murder rate because after securing control of the Mexican cocaine industry he is running out of people to kill). How does a tech-geek with a clean record end up on that list? Well, he created “The Liberator,” the world’s first fully functional 3-D printed firearm. I spoke to him the day the Liberator software went live, and you could feel the emotional cyclone he was caught up in: equal parts fear, excitement and paranoid anxiety. The software had gone viral immediately, downloaded tens of thousands of times by that afternoon, and the US government and 3-D printer manufacturers were preparing to go to war (or were at least making all the noises).\n\nRepresentative Steve Israel (D-NY), whose press office I spoke to at the time, had been ringing alarm bells for weeks about the possibility of someone developing the software necessary to print a handgun. He was given little notice though; nobody thinks there’s anything menacing about snow until it turns into an avalanche. Wilson commented on the lack of attention his company, Defense Distributed, got in the US before he kicked open Pandora’s Box, “They were awe-struck in Europe, but in terms of the press here, people just weren’t particularly interested in it. At first, until Sandy Hook at least, a lot of the attention I got on my work came from abroad.” Wilson believes the reason for this is cultural; in the US guns are already so prevalent, so deeply interwoven into the American tapestry, that the giant leap forward Wilson was proposing seemed more like a suggestion to cross a river using stepping stones as opposed to a convenient bridge. Guns are already omnipresent and easily accessible in America, so nobody cared about the possibility of 3-D printing a shoddy handgun when it’s cheaper to go buy a real gun that’s more likely to kill someone. In Europe, Japan, Australia and other developed countries with established underground tech scenes, the idea of a wave of cheap, unregulated firearms flooding the market was genuinely horrifying. Wilson acknowledges the difficult situation he faces bridging the international tech scene with his uniquely American brand of individual liberty and gun culture, “there are very stark cultural differences. People who are really in sympathy with me ideologically and with a lot of what I do just don’t have the same feelings people in America have about guns. People who also would be categorized into that kind of ‘radical, open-source software’ type are very uncomfortable with the idea of people 3-D printing a handgun. But the more I talk to them and travel in those circles…I think they’ll loosen up a little.”\n\nIn Washington DC, “loosening up” is not on the agenda. Senator Chuck Schumer, another New York Democrat, has taken up Rep. Israel’s call to arms (pardon the pun), and is championing legislative changes that will curb or outlaw the work being done by Defense Distributed and Wilson’s supporters. You’ll hear from Schumer and Israel a lot in the next couple weeks as The Undetectable Firearms Act comes up for renewal in December. Their problem, to put it simply, is that there’s nothing they can do to stop Wilson. In a letter ordering the company to remove the blueprint for The Liberator from its website, the State Department implied that Defense Distributed could be in violation of the Arms Export Control Act. The reality is, the US government has no leg to stand on. In terms of his personal well-being, Wilson has no qualms, “the letters and concerns we’ve gotten have been addressed to Defense Distributed. The government won’t pierce the corporate veil. I feel v­ery comfortable knowing the situation and with my legal background.”\n\nPart of the problem is that the government is an ill-equipped behemoth when it comes to taking on the hyper-adaptive tech world, “They’re using their playbook from the 1980’s. And even when they update the Undetectable Firearms Act, it will be much of the same.” By ‘much of the same,’ Wilson means that all Congress can do is regulate against firearms that can pass through metal detectors. Even in conservative, pro-gun circles, this is a generally accepted regulation. Wilson, whose Liberator design needs only a small nail in order to function and could pass easily through an airport metal detector, inserts a 6oz. hunk of metal into the gun’s frame in order to comply with regulations. The obvious flaw here is that less scrupulous people could just as easily print out a functional handgun and not “bring it up to code” by inserting a piece of metal. It’s a Catch-22 for regulators. These kinds of hypotheticals (“maybe someone doesn’t put in 6oz. of metal”) are thwarted by decades of anti-regulation lobbying that make it remarkably difficult just to allocate funds to study gun violence. It is essentially illegal for the government to ever assume someone purchasing a gun might have malicious intent. For instance: the government knows that over half of all guns used in violent crimes originated from less than one percent of gun stores, but are unable to act on that knowledge in any predictive way. In other words, they can react to crimes that have already happened, following a weapon’s trail back to the gun store that was its source, but until the crime takes place they are legally required to act as if they don’t know that there are just 120 gun stores in the United States responsible for supplying the weapons for more than half of all violent crime. Wilson’s company and the legal quagmire he is in is not an analogous situation (there is absolutely no evidence that Wilson’s work has led to any kind of violence or injuries), but he does benefit from the built in anti-regulatory mechanisms that leave lawmakers in straitjackets.\n\nThe State Department can force Wilson to take the software down from his site, but as he quipped to me, “there’s no putting this toothpaste back in the tube.” And he’s undeniably correct. The file has already been so widely shared and downloaded that there’s no possibility of it being quashed. Thingiverse, a popular site run by a 3-D printer manufacturer that distributes files for printing out new products, has been playing a game of digital whack-a-mole for months trying to keep software to develop firearms and gun parts off its system. “Even if they keep it off their platforms, it’s on Pirate Bay, it’s still being downloaded. There’s nothing they can do.”\n\nThere may not be anything they can do right now, but they’re preparing to do what large businesses in high-growth-potential industries do with problems Congress can solve: throw a lot of money at it. 3-D printers only recently became available in retail. They’re still in what I would call the “wet cement” stage of product development. They want to be associated with the limitless possibilities that their products represent: doctors printing hip replacements for surgery, school districts saved from budget cuts by printing class materials, homeowners fixing their own plumbing by printing out the tools and parts they need. The commercials will write themselves. More than anything, these companies don’t want parents thinking of their children downloading the files to print a handgun in their living room. They don’t want a story on the news about somebody regulated against purchasing a firearm on the open market (ex-cons, domestic abusers, the mentally ill…) turning their garage into a small-scale gun factory. Wilson is not ignorant or indifferent when it comes to the dangers his products pose to people. He just has a consuming belief in the right of individuals to do as they please, and that a collective decision to limit an individual’s rights for a perceived good is wrong. It is a moral wrong, a matter of principle etched in stone, and thus is unencumbered by notions such as social welfare.\n\nThis is exactly the fight Wilson sought when he developed The Liberator. When we first spoke he was reserved, carefully referring to his company as being only a software development venture, a social experiment more than anything. But even then I had the feeling there was more Wilson wanted to say, a system he wanted to upend but good council urged him not to discuss. In the past six months, Wilson has unshackled himself from those reservations. Or perhaps it was the government revealing that the only shackles they had came in the form of impotent intimidation. Either way, Wilson now feels free to refer to this endeavor as a “desperately ambitious political project.” Which it always was, of course.\n\nAnd now Wilson is building out an infrastructure that mirrors and supports his work with Defense Distributed. “Dark Wallet,” his new project, is fast approaching the $50,000 it set out to raise on Indiegogo. But that doesn’t count the tens of thousands they’ve raised through Bitcoin. It’s no surprise, considering Dark Wallet is a proposed encrypted system for storing Bitcoins out of government reach. It is a natural extension of Defense Distributed, and of Wilson himself as his position in the international hacktivist community continues to expand.\n\nIf you’re the government, what could you possibly do? Defense Distributed doesn’t turn a profit; they’re sustained by donations and give away their software for free. They don’t even need a website, only for the internet to exist. Wilson leads a small but widening band of people who believe in technology’s potential to empower individuals over institutions, who believe that to enable individual liberty over all other concerns is always the right thing to do, and who have the technical know-how to make those things a reality. They don’t rely on investors who, like the 3-D printing companies, have an incentive to play ball. The entire endeavor is a self-sustained organism. It feeds off the energy and enthusiasm of small galaxies of activists working on the cutting edge of emerging technology. They are not only free from the burden of a Board of Directors, they’re on the cusp of being free of government currency altogether. What could you possibly do?\n\nOver the next three weeks, lobbyists will bounce from room to room in the halls of Congress. They will spend hours and days and small fortunes getting legislators to make superficial changes to the language of the bill, then coordinate with teams of PR reps who poll-tested every possible sentence to make sure nothing will give the impression anyone involved wants to bring SOPA back (“make sure to call it ‘modernization’!”), and most importantly to guarantee that there are no changes whatsoever to the product or price to do business. Over that time, Cody Wilson will be traveling through Europe, marshaling colonies of likeminded hacktivists. The fingers Wilson and his organization have spread out across the world may someday have the power to close into a fist. I ask him what can happen if Congress takes strong action renewing the Undetectable Firearms Act, and there’s a moment of silence where I can almost feel him pitying me. “You know why they’re so invested in these products, in this technology? They wanted to be involved in this space because of the potentially revolutionary changes it could bring. Well, guess what, it’s revolutionary.”\n\nAn Interview: In Depth\n\nDean’s Blue Hole is the world’s deepest known underwater sinkhole. It’s a small inlet surrounded by a ring of high cliff walls. It’s as if a perfectly cylindrical chasm opened up in the Earth, with the same effect opening a manhole under a densely crowded sidewalk might take. And it looks that way because that’s exactly what happened. The resulting rock formation has the appearance of an eyeball: a dark, cavernous pupil in an iris of beautiful Caribbean blue. Some locals are afraid of Dean’s Blue Hole. It’s the depth, the cold that comes out of it like a pipe, but mostly it’s the darkness.\n\nWilliam Trubridge refers affectionately to Dean’s Blue Hole as “home field.” Trubridge is just over six feet tall, with long arms and hands like dinner plates that make him look even taller. There are many forms of underwater stamina competition—static apnea, which is just how long someone can hold his or her breath while not moving, as well as depth reached with the aid of fins or under weights. The purest version of the sport is free diving: one breath, no equipment, up and down, godspeed. Trubridge is the greatest free diver in the world. In December 2010, he dove 101 meters in a single breath, breaking his own 100-meter record. He remains the only human to go 100 meters underwater without equipment and live.\n\nTrubridge literally grew up on the water. His family traveled back and forth from the United Kingdom to New Zealand by boat, and he spent his formative years horsing around in the ocean with his brother. “That’s where the love of the water comes from. Just playing. That was what I consider my first phase of falling in love with diving.” Phase two began at age 22, when it occurred to Trubridge, “just like a sudden bolt of electricity,” that there existed in the world people who did nothing but competitive ocean diving. And so he moved to Honduras, where he dedicated himself to pushing the limits of his mental and physical endurance. All of which led Trubridge to Dean’s Blue Hole, the perfect location for a diver. The sinkhole’s isolation from the ocean means there are no pesky currents, and the cold water is actually a benefit in free diving. Being immersed in cold water slows down the heart rate and initiates an internal process of shunting blood towards necessary organs and muscles. This is an effect of the “Mammalian Dive Reflex,” which is often cited as decisive proof that human ancestors originated in the ocean. It’s why children have to learn that fire is dangerous by burning their fingers, but if dropped underwater know instinctively not to draw breath.\n\nWe were all made for the water, but none so much as William Trubridge.\n\n* * *\n\nTrubridge rests atop two donut flotation devices directly above Dean’s Blue Hole. From afar it might look like he was preparing to float down a lazy river; but upon closer inspection you’d realize that the floating cooler is holding first aid, not cold beers, and a perimeter of safety divers and judges form a moving wheel pattern that encircles him at the surface. His wife Brittany hovers above him and keeps the donuts balanced. She shows no trace of anxiety, only the firm focus of a coach or trainer.\n\nBrittany is an experienced diver herself and trains with her husband for most of the year. As a free diver, she shares her husband’s casual disregard for the fears normal people would have about being in an oxygen-less environment with 142 pounds per square inch of water pressure wringing their internal organs. When I brought up rock climbing as an analogous sport, Trubridge interjected, “it’s really not the same at all. You know what you’re capable of. I broke the record at 96 meters before 100 meters, and then 101 meters. So if something were to go wrong, if I blacked out, I’d be pretty near the surface, and the safety crew is there.”\n\nBut the dangers involved are not trivial. As if to hammer the point home, a professional freediver died in Dean’s Blue Hole while this post was being constructed. Nicholas Mevoli, a competitive diver from Brooklyn, returned to the surface after successfully reaching 72 meters and signaling that he was OK. 30 seconds later, he lost consciousness. Mevoli’s lungs had suffered severe “depth-related damage,” and paramedics could do nothing to staunch the internal bleeding from filling into them.\n\nSafety divers follow Trubridge for the first 30 meters or so, before turning back once he enters the inkpot of Dean’s Blue Hole itself. It is also at about this depth that Trubridge enters a state of free fall. Humans are naturally buoyant, the result of lightweight fat cells and sacks of oxygen like your lungs and stomach. But William Trubridge has no fat, he is all stringy muscle and protruding bones, and at about 25 meters deep his lungs and other internal organs are so compressed that they are no longer buoyant. So Trubridge sinks, his arms at his side, in a state of suspended animation. This 75-meter stretch is likely to determine the success or failure of his world record attempt. It’s a painfully slow descent, but not worth wasting the oxygen he would burn through self-propulsion; “I can hold my breath for over seven minutes in SA (static apnea), and this dive takes less than five. Oxygen is more valuable than time.”\n\nWhen I push and prod Trubridge about how he trains his body for diving to these depths, he would always bring up “internal flexibility,” a phrase I found frustratingly abstract at the time. When you see him doing one of the flexibility routines he’s developed though, it all makes perfect sense. Trubridge is thin as a pole, and he can suck his stomach in so far that you can feel internal organs or stick a finger up behind his rib cage. His muscles are hard and sharp as wires, and when he flexes his abdomen it looks like a bag of wriggling snakes. He controls his diaphragm with the precision of an orchestra conductor, triggering certain sections, or even individual abdominal muscles, that all seem to function independently but somehow in perfect harmony. When he takes deep, steadying breaths it’s a stunning transformation. His chest expands outward like a barrel and the force of his exhale sounds like a fire bellows.\n\n“Ahhh,” I think to myself when I first see Trubridge putting his torso through its paces, “internal flexibility.” Of course there’s more to it than that. He is capable of clearing his ears without using his hands. He controls the muscles in his throat and jaw—like how you might make exaggerated chewing motions to un-pop your ears on a plane—as if there were a mechanic adjusting valves inside his head. These, like the muscles in his diaphragm or lining his esophagus, are things most humans would consider beyond the realm of conscious control. And yet Trubridge has a higher degree of control over those muscles than many people have over their biceps.\n\nDown in the sinkhole, the darkness is absolute. But fear and anxiety are not emotions Trubridge can afford to tolerate. The human mind consumes over 20 percent of the body’s oxygen and, as Trubridge says with characteristic bluntness, “once you’ve started thinking, it’s already over.” Much of his training has no physical component whatsoever. At least not in the sense that people anticipate when it comes to world-class athletes. He is a yoga and pilates expert, and he meditates regularly. It’s a trait that bleeds into every aspect of his life. He talks slowly and takes long, contemplative breaths before he answers any questions. Perhaps it’s a disposition he acquired as a child watching the ocean slip away behind him day after day, but you get the impression he’d be content to spend a week silently considering the horizon.\n\nIt’s a skill that also requires hard, dangerous work. Trubridge attracted notice during a 60 Minutes special on deep divers when he was filmed practicing underwater, a process that involves crawling along the ocean floor within arms reach of twelve foot long sharks. When I ask him about this training technique, he says, “tension, anxiety, that consumes oxygen. You come across things down there, sharks, other dangerous fish, I’ve seen jellyfish the size of small cars, but you have to be able to put that out of your mind. Not even really put it out of your mind, because once you’ve broken that meditative state, it’s over. You just can’t let it enter your mind at all.” For Trubridge, it goes beyond just overcoming basic fears; “even if you aren’t afraid you can still release adrenalin, which will elevate your heart rate. You’ll start pumping more blood and your brain will use up any oxygen you have. The only way to overcome that is experience. There’s just no other way to train your body to maintain that equilibrium.”\n\nAfter minutes that seem likes hours, the free-falling Trubridge comes upon a small light looming like a lamppost in thick fog. This marks the 101-meter depth, and Trubridge collects a tag at the end of a rope before turning to begin his ascent. His body, which is much more affected by the pressure at this depth than at 25 meters, is slow to rise. Unlike when you swim to the surface from the bottom of a pool, buoyancy is working against him. His organs are deflated and his dwindling oxygen supply does nothing to counterbalance the force of gravity. “You feel on the way up, and the deeper you are the more noticeable it is, that you’re being forced down.” If something were to go wrong here, a black out or injury of any kind, there would be little hope for a rescue. The abyss would swallow him as ruthlessly as if a malevolent creature was dragging him down by the ankles.\n\nBut he rises. Slowly and methodically Trubridge propels himself upward: kick, drag, glide…kick, drag, glide. The way he moves underwater is reminiscent of an albatross. His long limbs trace graceful patterns, and there’s a kind of illusion where he doesn’t appear to be moving particularly fast, just everything around him seems to slow down. He does not break this rhythmic pace even when he is back in clear water and the sun beating down on the surface must call to him like a moth to a flame. You get a sense of the power and propulsion he generates when safety divers with full lungs and four-foot long flippers have to work to stay abreast of him. He breaks the surface and immediately grabs the safety rope; taking breaths that—forgive me for pulling out an old saw here but it’s absolutely true—look exactly like a fish out of water.\n\nHe has just gone deeper than any human has ever gone before without aid of any kind or without perishing before returning to the surface. But there is one more thing he must do before his record can be confirmed. His wife, before anyone offers a hand to help, barks at him in the tone a coxswain might take with a tired rower, “Look at the judges! Say it!”\n\n“I’m ok.”"
