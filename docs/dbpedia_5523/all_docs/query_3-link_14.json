        "text": "For me it's all about integrity, or lack thereof on the part of the Mormon church and its members. It astounds me how Mormons can look straight at a mountain of unrefuted evidence which proves that their religion is a hoax, and just shrug it off, saying, \"Yes, those facts are puzzling, but I'm not going to think about it. I have faith that God will answer all our questions in the next life\". I realize that many Mormons will question my claim that there's a \"mountain\" of evidence. In order to keep this write-up from getting too long, I'm only going to talk about a few key items in the paragraphs that follow below. If you want to see&mldr;\n\ndoug\n\nI loved the church that was presented to me as a youth. I can remember the exact moment I obtained a testimony of the faith I was taught during childhood. The messaging was simple, and it made sense to me. As an adult, I came to realize that the church presented to me as a youth didn't match the picture of mormonism today. Between shifting doctrines, unethical behavior by the General Leadership, and hidden history of the church I came to realize that nothing about the church is what it claimed to be. The religion I'd loved as a youth simply didn't exist, and never had.\n\ncurtishartley\n\nBullied within church, religion used against me by family, don’t align with the teachings and beliefs\n\naverygo\n\nThroughout most of my time in the church, I felt like I wasn't good enough. I wasn't worthy of anything. I felt controlled. I felt like I was living someone else's life, and not my own. This ended up making my life and the world around me extremely confusing, and I didn't really know how to maneuver my way through life. I didn't know what was important, I didn't know who I was nor who I was meant to be. Everything was just extremely confusing. Despite this, I continued to hold on to the iron rod (if not just with my fingertips), in the hopes that maybe, I just maybe, I'd figure everything out. But I didn't I first made&mldr;\n\nbakiraka01\n\nWhile, overall, my mission was a great experience, there were some things I learned and experienced about my faith that started to bother me. I started really reading and studying the Book of Mormon (BoM) for the first time on my mission and, honestly, I struggled with it. I loved the Bible, the NT in particular. I loved how authentic the OT felt and learning about all of the interesting ancient history and foreign concepts to a young westerner. I loved the various takes on Jesus in the Gospels and how much of a revolutionary he was (I was into punk rock as a kid and reading the NT made me realize how counter-culture Jesus really was for his time).&mldr;\n\nkendall\n\nWhen I was fifteen, I was with my family on a trip one state over seeing my grandmother. I have always been very tech oriented, so I had my laptop set up as a workstation on my grandfather’s desk next to my cot in their basement. I looked at all of the books on the shelf that he had amassed and read over a lifetime. He never went to college and was a self-educated but successful man, something my mother and, truth be told, I am very proud of. A very devout member of the church, many of my grandfather’s books were interpretations of church doctrine and history. I read the first passages of a couple of them, and the&mldr;\n\ntoomuch\n\nPiper Navajo\n\nMy decision to leave was a culmination of experiences and truth finding that actually made it easy to part ways. I always doubted men were called of God. It wasn’t difficult for me to see those that aspired to callings and mingled their own beliefs with a Christ centered teaching. Over the decades. I would see the damage it caused to my family and no questions asked responses from the brethren. CES letter was the cherry on top for me.\n\nThroughout my time in the church, I was always convinced I wasn't good enough and that I was an awful person. I compensated for this by being a misogynist and having a holier-than-thou attitude, only to realize I was hurting those around me, whilst being hurt by the lies I was being spoonfed by the church. My faith was first tested when I noticed loopholes in the repentance system: You could sin, and repent, then sin, then repent again. It was like a get out of jail free card. I then decided to test the limits of this and began pushing the limits of it. My faith crisis was only pushed forward after the actions of a primary teacher. I&mldr;\n\nIn 2017, my wife and I had a severe falling-out with our Mormon bishop. I went online for help and went down the rabbit hole. This resulted in a faith crisis then a faith transition. Eventually, I resigned from the Mormon church in 2022. Link to my resignation essay: https://www.reddit.com/r/ExitStories/comments/18kh7p6/why_i_resigned/\n\nceyre\n\nMy struggles with church started when I met friends who were gay for the first time. I learned about being gay, being trans, and saw the way my friends were abused and punished by a church I thought cared about them. Then it was my turn. After discovering I was Trans, everything began to fall apart. My parents had made their stance on Transgender people very clear: They didn't exist. Any ideas of Transgender identity were merely temptation, confusion, mental illness, or possession by the devil himself. I struggled for years to hide it from my parents but the more I hid the more I saw my health decline, and the more resentment built. I fell down rabbit holes of&mldr;\n\nI wondered why, if this is so great, why doesn’t everyone embrace it? What am I missing and why does the Church make me feel empty? Why would a loving God treat his children so differently based on where they were born, who their parents are, what race they were born into, what their last name is, what their sexual preference is, what their gender is, how much money they have and whether they followed Hindu, Buddhist, Muslim or Christian teachings. Why would God demand 10% tithing to get into the celestial kingdom; pay-to-play just didn’t seem right. Why would God pick Joseph Smith since he’s such a schmuck. Polygamy …. Really? What woman would embrace a role of making&mldr;\n\ntom808\n\nIt's not true: plain and simple. After watching my husband become a happier, more confident person as he stepped further & further away from the Mormon church, I realized my entire life had been based on a lie. I promptly had an identity crisis and began experiencing a painful yet beautiful transition of faith. It occurred to me that I had more integrity than the \"Only True\" church I had been brought up in, because when I was made aware of their lies and atrocities I refused to be associated with them any longer. I found out that a bishop had been excommunicated partly for his insistence on ending 1-on-1 interviews between grown men and children (Sam Young - https://protecteverychild.com/.&mldr;\n\nsippinginmywild\n\nI was a rigid, rigid judgmental bitch. And I was SO angry. I've always been a strong, opinionated personality, intent on changing the world. I am ready to move mountains single-handedly if necessary. Being Mormon somehow managed to make that energy a bad thing. As a woman, I was \"supposed\" to be kind, sweet, and loving. I was supposed to make babies and be a homemaker, and I was \"supposed\" to be happy doing just that. Only that. And that was infuriating. I grew up being told regularly that God didn't want me as I was, but as something I knew I could never be - MEEK. I felt that God wanted me to shortchange myself at every turn, and&mldr;\n\nmurphy\n\nI left because homophobia, racism, misogyny, etc.\n\nmyivyangel\n\nAfter ignoring hundreds of shelf items, I was traumatized by my mission. I sailed low through the rest of my college degree, fully aware if the church caught wind of my attitude they might sabotage my career prospects. Then I moved out of the bubble, and saw some of the real world without wearing the nametag. I started paying attention. It became clear to me that the leaders of the church are not guided by god when it took them half a year into the pandemic to council members to maybe wear masks. I realized I had been duped. What really did it for me though was realizing that I am transgender, and that is something that people can just&mldr;\n\nlayhandsondeez\n\nI suppose there are two reasons I am writing this. The first is to have something in writing to give to those who sincerely wonder why I am where I am in relation to beliefs I have held at times in my life. I wanted this to be able to provide an effective way to explain some key facts and ideas relative to my growth and growing system of belief. It has remained one of the most intense agonies of my life that those whose lives crossed paths with mine, and have become important to me, have had a need to reject me because I believe what I do. I have had to sever an entire portion of my life,&mldr;\n\nbigeddy\n\nThe Epic of Bobcat is one of those stories that, when you live it, seems packed with adventure and intrigue, where the ending is anything but clear. But looking back years later, I realize that given who I am and what I have been through, the questions I've asked and the answers I've found, it's really no surprise that I ended up here. Growing up, I was the type of kid who had always gone to church because he wanted to. I never felt coerced or forced to do so. I earned my Eagle Scout, was involved in every quorum presidency, and kept all of the rules concerning the Word of Wisdom, the Law of Chastity, and the Law of&mldr;\n\nbobcat\n\nFor me, Charles Dickens said it best in his book ‘A Tale of Two Cities.' It opens up with \"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way...\" Like many of you, I have spent the last several years trying to make sense out&mldr;\n\nmoonshine\n\nThe first real doubt came when I went through the temple to take out my endowments – 3 days before my marriage ceremony. I was shocked when I realized I was agreeing to sacrifice my body and soul to a physical and spiritual death if I ever revealed what I witnessed – and even went through the motions of slitting my throat as a sign of the impending doom if I dared to speak. Boy did that make me feel warm and fuzzy! And I worried that I’d never be able to remember all the secret handshakes and coded words and my new secret name to pass through the veil after I died – which apparently was the only way&mldr;\n\nmsgabbie2u\n\nWhen I received the call that my Father had collapsed and was not conscious, I knew he was gone. I could feel it. The anchor for our family was gone. And now I was the oldest male in the immediate family. The next few months took its toll on our emotions and my mother’s health. We slowly cleaned out the house and moved my Mother to live with my sister, but the aftermath of the death would haunt me for years. Circa 1964 on a family vacation my parents were introduced to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; the Mormons. They joined when I was 9 years old and I was baptized at that time. From that time&mldr;\n\ngrape-nephi\n\nPART 1: BACKGROUND Ironically, growing up Mormon taught me to value non-conformity. This is ironic because Mormons are famed for lockstep conformity in action, dress, and thought. But training Mormon kids to be like other Mormons necessarily requires training them to be unlike everyone else. And when you live in an area where Mormons are few and far between -- like Minnesota, where I grew up -- that means being unlike just about everybody. As a kid, with or without Mormonism, there was no way I was going to fit in easily with other kids my age. I was a shy, socially awkward, late-bloomer-tomboy-bookworm, living in my own imaginary world, as likely to be talking to myself as to be&mldr;\n\nchanson\n\nTo someone raised in the Mormon Church, the phrase “Oh ye of little faith” is one of the most stinging criticisms you can receive. Conversely, to be called “a person of great faith” is one of the highest compliments a Mormon can receive. The church goes to great lengths, starting with young toddlers barely old enough to talk and continuing non-stop throughout each member’s life, to ensure that faith is held as one of the highest virtues in the minds of all members. “Great people have great faith. Weak people have weak faith.” The message is repeated endlessly in as many different ways as possible. As a result of this very successful indoctrination regarding the virtue of faith, I found&mldr;\n\nstudent\n\nI believe that the first of these events came in either the late 50s or the early 60s. I was in a Woolworths (I think), and stopped to get a drink from the water fountain. I hesitated as I noticed that there were two water fountains, one labeled \"colored\" and the other labeled \"white.\" I then noticed that there were separate restrooms labeled according to race. I can see these \"colored\" and \"white\" restroom signs in my mind as clearly today as I did almost 45 years ago. For some reason, I had never really noticed them before, and I wasn't quite sure how to process it. Many of you may be familiar with Jim Crow laws. Even into the&mldr;\n\nmamajama\n\nBut I never, ever gained a real testimony. Ever. Oh, I stood up in F&T meetings once in a while and bore my testimony. I knew how I was supposed to feel, what I was supposed to say, but I just never got my burning bosom, or my \"perfect knowledge\" that the Church was true and that Joseph Smith was a prophet. I guess I was in \"fake it till you make it\" mode. So why did I stick around? Because I believed the Church was true, and the Book of Mormon was true, and I believed that one day I would know it. Besides, I had my family to think about. They needed this as much as I did,&mldr;\n\ncrime-dog\n\nI was raised in a deeply rooted Roman Cathlolic family. I think Catholiscism goes back on my fathers side of the family to the inception of the church. In addition my family was the picture of disfunction. I was a sensative boy and the formative years of my life were immersed in the chaotic and unsettling sixties. My older brothers and sisters lived the sixties like it is seen in textbooks today. Unfortunately for me, the above combination created a life in which I experienced a great deal of fear and a sense of loss of control. I remember having thoughts as a young man that I found deeply troubling. Thoughts of life and death and what, if anything, followed&mldr;\n\nfree-thinker\n\nOn with my story... Not only did I grow up in a Mormon family, I grew up in a very conservative Mormon family. My father was a member of the John Birch Society during part of my teenage years. But all in all it was a good childhood - no complaints here. When I was twelve I begged my father to hire me to work for him in his sign business so I wouldn’t have to work in the potato fields like most of the other kids my age. He agreed which meant that over the subsequent years he and I developed a good relationship, because of which I pretty much did what I was told. I attended church every&mldr;\n\njeff-ricks\n\nAugust 7, 2005 In the Beginning: I was born to goodly parents who did not attend any religious services. My father was force fed religion during his youth and swore he would not set foot inside another church when he was old enough to make his own decisions. As far as I know, he made good on that promise; except for weddings, and other special occasions, I don’t remember him ever attending any church services. My mother would have attended church, but deferred to my father on matters of religion. She didn’t attend church either, while my father was living. After my father died, at the age of 67, my mother started going to a Presbyterian church with my sister&mldr;\n\nhamar\n\nI first encountered the church about a year after my dad married my stepmom. I was maybe 7 or 8 when he married the waitress he cheated on my mom with. That waitress turned out to be a lapsed Mormon. She had been excommunicated for living in sin with my dad. After their marriage, she convinced my dad to take the missionary discussions. At the same time, I remember my uncle desperately trying to convince my dad to be a plain old Southern Baptist, and to this day, I’m not sure which choice would have been worse. Anyway, my dad was baptized about a year or so after he married my stepmom and within a few weeks, he re-baptized my&mldr;\n\ndogzilla\n\nI provided that background because the way I joined the Church is helpful in understanding why I could ultimately leave it with ease. And what some of the difficulties were. Fast forward 15 years. Wait…slow down…that was TOO fast… In the interim between my joining the Church and my leaving the Church, my wife and I set about to make certain we were \"A-teamers\" in any Ward we lived in. My wife in particular was a righteous soul who was working her way into the Celestial Kingdom, and despite my glaring and numerous deficiencies, I was determined to at least make a good-faith effort to join with her in the eternities, populating worlds without number, that sort of thing. I&mldr;\n\npeter-mary\n\nWhen I was 14, my mother passed away. I felt very much alone and learned through that experience to lean on the Lord even more. I decided that I would do what was right because it was the path to happiness, not to please my dad or because of fear of punishment. I felt particularly close to Heavenly Father over the next few years, having had countless experiences of answered prayers, premonitions that were fulfilled, marvelous insights, church leadership positions, and the privilege of baptizing my brother-in-law at the age of 16. I truly felt like I had a deep and personal relationship with my Savior. Also, at that time, I began to read a lot of church books: “The&mldr;\n\nhueffenhardt\n\nI pulled up to the stake center recalling the Bishop’s words to meet him at 7 pm in his office. “Why did I want to talk to him?” I pondered, “He’s not going to understand. He may even report me for asking too many questions and appearing to lose my testimony.” I believed he would answer my questions and resolve the mountain of doubts and questions accumulated in my mind after two years of intense research and study. So I grabbed my college backpack and headed for the stake center doors. The stake center was nearly empty as the ward activities were coming to a close.

So hear I am Standing for The God of love. He has asked us to love everyone especially those that are hard to love. I have my own beliefs and my own inner jewels.

He is the only \"living prophet\"&mldr;\n\nmike\n\nI made the heartbreaking decision to the mormon after a culmination of years of lies and abuse. Church leaders ignoring abuse and witnessing abusers and pedophiles entering the temple. Utah mormons are judgemental, instead of welcoming strangers in meetings, i witnessed members making snide comments about how some were dressed. Disruptive children during the sacrament. To me, the sacrament has always been sacred and humbling. My temple worthiness was sacred and humbling. Utah mormons seem to take everything the doctrine is for granted, assuming anyone not born a \"lifer\" to be beneath them. When I converted, a man from the chorum of the 70's spoke to us.. He said \"remember, you joined the church for the doctrine and not the&mldr;\n\nDespite my faithfulness, I had a nuanced side to me that couldn’t be shaken, and that showed when I stood up for a sister-in-law who had lost her faith in the church. I was told to block her when my brother divorced her for her non-belief, and when I defended her, I was met with a lot of resistance. I then started to believe in a god who didn’t care what we believed. Shortly after that, I had another brother who divorced his wife, but this time, domestic violence was involved. The police were called, and he was charged. This SIL called me in an effort to find help, and I listened to her story. It was the first time&mldr;\n\nI was born and raised in a devout Mormon home but questioned it from a very early age. The first incident I recall that caused me confusion happened in grade school. Growing up in Portland, Oregon during the 80’s, I was the only Mormon kid in my grade. Somehow, one of my classmates learned that I came from a Mormon family and posed the following question to me: “How many moms do you have?” He was clearly making fun of me, but I didn’t have even the slightest idea of what he was talking about. Later, I asked my dad what this kid was talking about and got the following response: “Well, that’s something people in the church did a&mldr;\n\nwescauthers\n\nIt was all about the truth claims for me. The Church claims to be \"the only true and living Church upon the face of the whole Earth\" led by Jesus himself. They teach that Joseph Smith saw God and Jesus after an earnest prayer. They teach that the Book of Mormon is a real history of the American Indians, who came from a family in Jerusalem...they teach that the book of Abraham is a real scripture. When you dig into the real history you'll find that what the Church teaches is not how it all went. Joseph Smith was a con artist who claimed to be able to find hidden treasures and (illegally) charged people for it. You find that&mldr;\n\nexmodad\n\nFor the entirety of my Mormon identity, I always had unsettling feelings about the church and the beliefs. throughout my entire life I was never treated fairly, I was always bullied by the adults of the church and always kicked out of young women’s activities, girls camp and seminary class for asking questions about doctrine. My senior year in seminary, my teacher was angry with my questions and decided to talk to me privately in a one exit room, instead yelled at me, making me cry and making me very uncomfortable. I decided I did not have to take the abuse any longer and told him I was leaving. to which he replied “no you’re not.” he then barricaded the&mldr;\n\nb-yousef\n\nI was a straight girl who didn't conform with the strict gender codes forced on me by my mother who was a soprano in the Tabernacle choir. I wasn't allowed to join Boy Scouts. I was the middle of 7 kids in Utah and was lost in the shuffle as my mom had us for clout, not because she liked children. I was the Black sheep, the family embarrassment who wore all black and combat boots. My parents did not intend for me to have a college education or a career, only marriage to a return missionary was discussed. I rebelled and left home at 16, stayed with friends in California and that was when I saw the worldly people&mldr;\n\nI got frustrated with always being told “milk before meat” when I would ask hard questions about the church. I’ve always been a fan of logic, science, and critical thinking. I just finally got around to applying logic and reason to matters of faith and found them to be lacking. When I’d ask questions of my church leaders they would always tell me to focus on the basics. So I did. Unfortunately I discovered everything that was good about Mormonism wasn’t unique. And everything unique about Mormonism wasn’t good.\n\nmichael-taylor\n\nI always struggled with the history and lack of proof surrounding the Book of Mormon. I was able to leave that on my shelf waiting for the day that the evidence would be found. I knew a day would come that a bunch of buried swords would be found proving it was all true. In late 2015 I was talking to a fellow soldier during our monthly national guard assignment. He was expressing concern with a new policy excluding children of LGBT members from becoming members. It hadn’t really bothered me prior since no one I knew was affected. He had a family member that had been closeted and married to a female trying to start a family. He came&mldr;\n\nalan\n\nBecause the my late husbands married best mate tried it on with me. Then during my time of inactivity i found out about the CES letter...

Read the Book of Mormon over a dozen times. Did everything I could. Did everything right. Turned 35, was poised to baptize my oldest, and realized if I hadn't got my answer yet, I never would. I wasn't ready to put my kids through it all if it wasn't true.\n\nnorkish\n\nBefore converting, I had a lot of questions and doubts. My biggest concern was the lack of equality for women. Everyone I knew in the church, including the missionaries, lied to me. They told me that women were considered equals. Even though I still had many doubts (this being foremost), I converted. My first time through the temple, I learned that women only had a relationship with God through their husband, and they had to veil their faces. They have since drastically changed the endowments, but at the time, women were still clearly inferior. Once I realized I had been lied to, my shelf broke immediately, and completely disintegrated within months. However, I went through the temple two weeks before&mldr;\n\nmaisy220\n\nAround the time I figured out I was queer, I felt this sudden guilt whenever I walked into the chapel. This was reinforced by realizing I don't want kids. I don't want to follow the covenant path. This was a huge shock for me. I almost cried in that chapel many times, having to step out. Eventually, against the policy (don't look at outside sources), I searched for the truth. The REAL truth. And I found it. And I left. The young women still try to reach out to me. It was often at first, but nowadays it's rare. I still want them to stop.\n\nkingofweird\n\nOne day while assigned to the MFO in Egypt, I was walking from my barracks room to work, and it hit me. The first vision is a lie. My subconscious had been working through a number of gospel related issues for some time. Church approved sources were insufficient in addressing my issues, and it never occurred to me to look elsewhere. (I later came to understand the churches role in that) Therefore the realization that the first vision was a lie came as a shock to me. I quickly analyzed what happened to put that thought into my mind. The claim simply doesn’t stand up to the standards of good evidence, either from a legal perspective IE physical evidence, corroborating&mldr;\n\nashmonster2000\n\nPossibly like many wasmormon members, I had questions about many aspects of Church history, doctrine and practices that often gave me pause from the time I was a young missionary, but, good Mormon that I was, I dutifully blamed myself for questioning the Church and the Prophet, repented and shelved the questions. My faith was shaken many times along the way as I grew older and started to realize there's no real, spiritual power in the Church, or in any religion made by men, other than what its members all agree upon, or, rather, what the leaders tell them they need to agree upon in order to please God, which often has the added benefit of enriching the Church through&mldr;\n\nandycwilson\n\nThe church I was a part of taught great principles of honesty, integrity, hard work, the importance of family, and love. What got me questioning the church is the actions taken by church leaders since the beginning that were not in line with what I thought the church was. After doing some experiments, I concluded that as much as I wanted the church to be true, the church is indistinguishable from a fraud.\n\n007shrimp\n\nMy older brother came out to me as gay on my 19th birthday. Just a month later, the Church's Policy of Exclusion, or the November Policy, was publicly revealed. The PoX made ZERO sense to me. Gay people are born gay; how could the Church lock them out of heaven because of the way they were born? I tried my best to justify the policy, telling myself that all gay people had to do was follow the doctrine, just like everyone else. However, I began to look at my now-husband and realize that this wonderful experience that so many people get to have is denied to gay people; LGBT members are required to choose companionship and being true to themselves,&mldr;\n\nautumn-phelps\n\nMy deconstruction started in college when I realized every week so much of what people said was the same self-hatred coded in self-righteousness. People always found something to dislike about themselves to share with the class. And did the same thing — praying every day to be better and always feeling I was coming up short. Well, I decided that would be the end of that and to love myself unconditionally. Funny thing is, when you do that, you give yourself room to disagree with everything that doesn’t fit with that message. So I was frequently hearing things at church and THINKING. A dangerous pastime, I know.

More than anything else, I object to the Temple Covenants of Obedience, Sacrifice, and Consecration because individual sovereignty means that it is evil for any other person or Church to interfere with one's honest and peaceful choices. This criterion means the Law of Obedience is an attempt to control. In our law which is just, self-ownership (personal sovereignty) must exist if one is to be free, hence subject to judgement under the law. Contracts, similar to Covenants, are nullified in law when the person is 1.) Uninformed. 2.) Deceived. 3.) pressured or coerced.

Also Covid was around so we were not able to attend to church thus leaving us at home reading and learning more about Christ and eventually the church history. As we started to learn more about Christ (reading from the bible more than the book of mormon) we noticed how it seem like we were going to a different direction than the church had taught us. The breaking point was GRACE. Reading in the book of mormon that Grace only comes \"AFTER\" all you can do (2 Nephi 25:23), made no sense when the bible is teaching that Grace is a gift&mldr;\n\nsearjasub\n\nThis past summer I turned 45 years old, and for my birthday I got a sweet midlife crisis.

And all parts of this midlife transition were tied to my decision to first stay in, then ultimately leave the&mldr;\n\nmidlifeexmomomma\n\nIntroduction: I spent the first 17 years of my life growing up in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. As all of you probably know, this specific religion is not a casual every-sunday kind of thing. When you are an active believing member, it makes up your entire life. Your entire being and existence is not your own life to live, it is merely a part of God’s plan. I was the last person you’d expect to leave the church. I was the Priest’s First Assistant in my branch. I blessed the sacrament every week. I genuinely enjoyed doing missionary work and tried to get my friends to come to activities. I read my Book of Mormon/Bible&mldr;\n\nspendiggity144\n\nEventually, everything that was stacked against the church added up. Everything I had put on my metaphorical shelf (where one keeps things that they don’t want to think about yet) had become too heavy, and the shelf broke. While on a work trip in Iowa, I determined I needed to seriously evaluate my church membership. I was done being uncomfortable with the church’s teachings and actions while still supporting them, and I needed to either be firmly in or firmly out. When I got home, I prayed my heart out and asked God if I should leave the church. I felt more peace and comfort than I ever did when I asked if the church was true. I came to&mldr;\n\nelementalepistles\n\nIn 2013 I was the First Assistant to the High Priest Group Leader and I oversaw \"group education\". The course of study for the year was \"The D&C and Church History\". I decided to enhance my knowledge of Church history by embarking on an ambitious reading project. I read, in 14 months, beginning in January: The Standard Works (twice) The History of the Church (7 volumes) A Comprehensive History of the Church (6 volumes) The History of Joseph Smith By His Mother The Journal of Discourses (26 volumes) Mind blown. Testimony shattered. Spoke with wife. Then Bishop. Then received a visit from my Stake President accompanied by the local Area 70 in my home.

I despise gaslighting and euphemistic language that controls people.

My main reason for leaving is the church’s culture in regards to abuse. They pretend it doesn’t happen, hides it and covers it up. It’s a toxic culture filled with judgmental people. I worked my first 10 years of motherhood and was treated like a sinner. I got talked down to, told I don’t love my kids, told I’m a bad mom, told I’m not doing what God wants, all because I have a job! Being told at age 37 that I should teach the sin lesson in YWs because I’ve sinned more than any of the other YWs leaders. (When at the time, I never have broken any big mormon rule). &mldr;\n\nsandra\n\nI became heavily involved in the Ordain Women movement because it invigorated my spouse's faith in Mormonism. We thought it could be a way for Mormonism to help rediscover its progressive, egalitarian roots with the historical practice of Women's Blessings and a doctrine of Heavenly Mother, and then we had our first daughter, and I wanted to create a better faith home for her to grow up in. When Kate Kelly was excommunicated, our optimism was crushed, but I kept searching Church History to understand Heavenly Mother and the nature of God, which led me to contemplate who the Holy Spirit could be. The best answer I found was from Janice Allred (Allred, \"Toward a Mormon Theology of God the&mldr;\n\njeremy-valentiner\n\nIt doesn’t really matter how I arrived here. The accumulation of my life experiences has ultimately led me out of belief in a structured and limited spirituality. As I read on Jeremy Runnel’s profile, “I believe in life BEFORE death.” I think that statement beautifully depicts my newfound appreciation for the marvels of our universe, and the delicate balance that sustains human life. My decisions are no longer driven by belief in an eternal reward, or fear of imaginary consequence, but love and gratitude for each sunrise and star filled night, and compassion for myself. I deserved so much better, and I’ve found it. ✨\n\nIn February of 2017, my whole world, as I know it was changed forever. I found out that the individuals that I called mom and dad for over forty years were not my real parents. I grew up in Utah in a Mormon family with a mother (Jean), and father (Martin), and one sister (Jennifer) who was ten years older than me. I was also named after my father, so I was Martin Jr. I never questioned this information because why would I? I had step siblings that were 15-20 years older than me, and I knew there was an age difference between Jean and Martin of 16 years, with her being the oldest. I also knew that she had&mldr;\n\nblackheart\n\nMy wife and I were 'all in'. I had been a VERY active member of the Mormon church for... 43 years.

And if you become faithful and follow the church and pay your tithing, then you won’t have to take these meds. So these actions by church members came with the explanation that it’s not the church.

As I gained life experience, there developed a divide between what I was taught and what I actually experienced. Then, another divide developed when I began to learn some of what I was taught wasn’t actually true. This led me to the conclusion that the LDS church is not what it professes to be and I no longer believe in any of it’s truth claims. My faith transition was not something I took lightly.

I had trouble sleeping all through my marriage. One morning, I woke up at 4:30 a.m. I turned on YouTube to find something to lull me back to sleep. I noticed a Mormon Stories episode featuring a Mormon woman I followed. The headline said she had left the church. Well, that caught my attention, and I listened to the entire 5 hour video. I was so stunned, I fell back onto my pillow and sobbed. Once I heard what she had to say, I knew I was done. I knew I couldn't speak to my husband. I kept it to myself, watched different videos about the church. Book of Abraham, Kinderhook Plates, origins of the&mldr;\n\nsusan_groom_1956\n\nI knew I didn't quite fit the Mormon cookie-cutter. I was sort of afraid of Mormon heaven. For one thing, I knew I would have to share my husband, with no regard for how I felt about it. I also couldn't think of a single thing I enjoyed that didn't have at least a little \"worldliness\" to it. And I found most church stuff to be incredibly boring. Would my brain be changed so much after I died that I wouldn't miss my books and games, and would instead love being all perfect and spiritual? How would that still be me? This thought stuck with me like a burr, making it so that I was never quite comfortable in my&mldr;\n\nthe-last-tapircorn\n\nIn 2005 I thought that I could learn new things about the Church and about the gospel on the Internet. I started browsing the net looking for sites about Mormonism. I was exposed to those who ranted against the Church, and to apologists trying to defend it. I remember reading about the Book of Abraham, and the controversy surrounding the resurfacing of the original papyri. Translations of the original papyri proved them to be nothing more than commonplace Egyptian funerary texts, and what’s more, they were dated much later than Abraham–almost as late as Jesus’ time. This disturbed me. I sought out the apologist websites, looking for a reasoned explanation of this phenomenon. I was looking to be reassured in&mldr;\n\nfrank\n\nI had doubts about the church even as a kid. Things just didn't seem to line up sometimes, but I still trusted and followed with blind faith. I didn't know anything different. When I was thirteen, it all came crashing down. Over a year or so, I realized that I was queer and started doing some research about the Mormon church, and what I found shocked me. I remember this awful hollow feeling in my chest. If the church really wasn't true, then who was I? What would happen to me? I cried in my room for hours and hours one night, praying and pleading desperately for God to give me something, some sign that it was all true. There&mldr;\n\nexmo-in-flames\n\nN. E.

The church apostle, Nathan Eldon Tanner, was found to be lying, but I was the one excommunicated. Rather than the church appreciating the correction, I was kicked out for speaking truth and pointing out the incorrect statement of the church leaders.

Over the next sixteen years, our lives unravelled, her behavior changed, and her life was destroyed (she passed away in early 2023). During this many year journey, her personality changed, our lovely marriage crumbled, and we descended into a deep decade of dysfunction, misdiagnosis, misuse of prescription drugs, and thousands of chaotic and traumatic experiences.

However, within the dynamics of my growing up home environment, I did not develop the personal sovereignty, nor the courage, nor even the idea, to say to my Mormon parent, \"I don't believe in this, therefor, I am no longer going to pretend by doing the things I am 'supposed' to do there.\" Approaching that important male age of 19, I had other plans, big plans, productive plans, ambitious plans, plans of achievement and adventure. Going on a Mission certainly did not align with those plans. More importantly, going on a&mldr;\n\ndeserveliberty\n\nI had some doubts about the church but all my friends were active.

That means I'm older, right? Here's my story. (I've actually told it a number of times on various podcasts, but, I've got a compact version I'll share here). I was born into the religion of my parents, Mormon. I grew up in Southern California and really didn't notice I was that different until Jr High. I should mention my parents were pretty normal. On Sunday we went to church, but we changed out of our Sunday clothes, watched TV, listened to music and could have friends over. I moved from San Diego to SLC the year I started high school. I went to Skyline. (I'm not worried if folks know me, my wife&mldr;\n\nlarry-camp\n\nInitially, my struggles with the church started with the divorce. I blamed myself for it, even though I know I had no part in it, but even still it hurt me. I prayed every day and night asking for my family to be fixed and for Him to forgive me for whatever I’d done to make this happen. Years and years passed and I had no answers and only more questions had joined the fray. Why can I not drink coffee? Why can’t I have sex until I’m married? Simple questions a preteen would have with a growing mine. However, soon enough these questions grew to larger questions. Why can’t I see you God? Why haven’t you spoken to me?&mldr;\n\ngreensockninja\n\nI left because of a simple problem and a prayer asking for a solution for the problem. The answer I received in prayer did not match my taught expectations. All I wanted to know was “How should I pay tithing?” I expected to hear, “Make sure to pay 10% of your own income.” But instead I heard, “You do not need to pay any more money to this church.” Wow! What a great start to a snowball effect. If I don’t pay tithing, I can’t go to the temple. If I can’t go to the temple, I don’t have to wear my garments. If I don’t wear my garments during the week, should I be untruthful and wear them on&mldr;\n\nehaner\n\nI never felt like I truly belonged anywhere. A single mother and her only child stand out in a church full of nuclear families with multiple kids. At the same time, our mormon status distanced us from our fellow Filipinos. I suppose it was this juvenile feeling of not having a place to belong that made discovering the CESLetter such an easy thing for me. I was always a shitty mormon; told the Bishop I didn't masturbate even though I did. Didn't attend the Boy Scouts, when my friends all completed their Eagle Projects. Never went on any treks, never visited the temple, never got my patriarchal blessing. I've always believed in Occam's Razor; the simplest answer is likely the&mldr;\n\nbwilliams8492\n\nThe thing that’s messed up about the church when you are raised in it is that everyone and everything in your life has to deal with the church somehow. When I came out I thought I had received a good feedback from all of my Mormon peers. Turns out everyone was just discussing it behind my back and spreading it before I told everyone. I left before this happened but was still forced to go to seminary and church activities. Some weren’t bad, but most were. My mother told me I would be grounded and have my car and phone taken away if I didn’t attend seminary. What made it worse was the fact that my mom was the seminary&mldr;\n\n2703\n\nLooking back, I see that many, many items went on my shelf over the years. The first was actually during a conference talk by Gordon B. Hinckley. He explained how we invite members of other faiths to bring the truth they have and add ours to it (or something like that). I was just a teenager, but I had a rare moment of insight. I envisioned a member of a Christian church being told that they only had part of the truth and that the Mormon's had the rest of it. It occurred to me that they would feel the exact opposite: that *we* were the ones who lacked the full truth. That went straight on the shelf. Other things&mldr;\n\nadamj\n\nFirst, I'm queer. I'm not cisgender or heterosexual and that was a huge problem in this religion. When I was finally able to accept myself for that, I realized the mormon religion would never accept me for it and I'd never be happy where I'm not even accepted. Second, I had so many concerns and questions that were either not answered, or the answers were not logical. I'd never even wanted to get baptized in the first place, and when I started trying to leave apparently an 8 year old was old enough to make a decision about joining but a 16 year old wasn't old enough to make the decision to leave and I \"didn't know what was best&mldr;\n\nfrey\n\nAs time went by I learned I wasn’t told the full truth about polygamy when I discovered widowers ( but not widows) could have more than one wife in the hereafter. Then in college I learned the truth about The Book of Abraham. I knew it wasn’t an anti Mormon lie because I learned it in my Pearl of Great Price class. Over the years as more stuff piled on my proverbial faith shelf I came to decide that I didn’t need a true church, just a good one. Then the the treatment of LGBTQ people , backtracking on whether being gay was a choice and then not admitting the mistake, as well as the purity culture teaching that women&mldr;\n\nnancypantsy72\n\nWhen I was a teenager, I had a typical rebellious phase where I didn't want to be involved in anything church related. I remember fighting with my parents because I was supposed to go do baptisms for the dead for mutual and I was refusing to go. Eventually I lashed out and yelled at them that I wouldn't go because I didn't believe. Back then, however, that was a lie- I always thought to myself during that stage of my life that I 'knew' it was true but that I wished it wasn't. Spirituality brought me no joy and I always felt like everyone was just faking it as they went because that's what I was doing. I hated church&mldr;\n\nlivandletlive\n\nMy mother grew up in a large Mormon family being one of 12 children and my dad was also one of 9 children who grew up as Mormon. Needless to say they both suffered in their childhoods due to financial strains and a lack of nurturing attention. Looking back now, I had the same upbringing. I never liked church starting at the primary age. It was boring with weird stories with weird names and was a confusing language. Listening to the congregation sing was depressing it sounded like torture not a celebration of worship. I had crippling shyness and I didn’t like singing and I didn’t like dresses and I always felt pressure from my peers and the culture to&mldr;\n\nrosanna1818\n\nI left before I knew the church wasn't true. I left thinking I was causing my eternal family suffering by my departure. I had to, if I was going to survive. I was having panic attacks going to church. The mental torture of not being perfect, not feeling worthy, not being straight, and falling in love with an atheist and wanting to be with them was a constant loop of shame and depression and longing. I left so I could relax my mind and get away from all the pressure. I wanted to live more than I wanted to take the sacrament and the blessings that were promised to follow someday. Stepping away opened my eyes to genuine kindness and&mldr;\n\nsavi1lavy\n\nMost of my life in the church I have had questions and doubts. My faith transition was a very long journey, not an overnight experience after reading certain pieces of anti material like for some people. Every question or doubt I had I would lean into and try to build a framework to make the answer work. I have even joked that during my mission I was a hobby apologist of sorts, always willing to tackle the tough stuff people I taught would bring up. Cracks in my framework began to show up overtime. Two things were the final straw for my testimony. The first was having children and considering the truthfulness with regards to what I would teach them&mldr;\n\nWhen I first joined the Mormon church, I wasn't allowed to go to the temple because I was married to a nonmember. Once the rules were changed and I could go, I went as often as I could. The first encounter was bizarre, to say the least. At that time they still had the \"blood oaths\" as part of the endowment. I had been looking forward to the \"new knowledge\" I would receive. Needless to say, I was disappointed. Of course, I was instructed by local leaders that I just needed to go more often so I would understand the deeper meanings of the endowment. I went as often as I could but at the same time I was piling&mldr;\n\ndod13\n\nThere were SO MANY REASONS! ..The practice of \"worthiness\" interviewing. One flawed human questioning another's spiritual worthiness felt off. I watched my first and last General Conference and couldn't imagine how anyone received anything of an inspirational nature from those empty and shallow talks. So many of which where profoundly lacking in emotional intelligence. Fast and Testimony with people repeating,\"I know the church is true.\" If you know, truly know of the truth of something you need not repeat it like a mantra. The most intense negative reaction I had came with learning of the invasive interviewing of children. The excommunication of Sam Young was disturbing to me. Instead of the church speaking out in clear opposition to the abhorrent&mldr;\n\nserene\n\nAfter a near suicide attempt at age 13, I started reading online “anti Mormon websites” to try and discover why god would hate me so much as to make me gay. As I read I discovered the ways the church harmed those like me, from excommunication to the conversion therapy led at BYU by elder oaks. As I kept reading I saw more and more that I was in a very very dark religious group. I mentally ran from the church shortly after, but was forced by my parents into Sunday attendance for another year. After that year ended I refused to step foot in a church building again, and so far have not. For another 6 months church members&mldr;\n\ngracefoster25\n\nYou can read about my journey from Mormon to secular humanist here: https://medium.com/@veronikatait/so-what-are-you-now-a-godless-commie-ee293139133e\n\nveronika-tait\n\nIn November, 2012, I was living in Washington state and a ballot measure was before us. Like happened in California with Prop 8, the Mormon church started a campaign to stop legalization of same-sex marriage. I researched what had gone on with Prop 8, and then read more and more about the issue. I then voted FOR gay marriage in that November 2012 election, and felt, for the first time ever, that my 49 years in the gay closet might finally come to an end. I had to come out not only to my then-wife, but to myself, and that was the most difficult of all, being true to myself. As 2013 approached, I saw the \"ordain women\" movement take&mldr;\n\nkevinrex4\n\nI don't think I ever had a testimony of the church. I believed in Christianity, but never quite bought into Mormonism. Growing up in Utah, I just went along with it because everybody else was. One thing that's different about me though, is my parents were adult converts from southern California. We swore, drank Coke, and watched R movies all the time. My family has a theater background, so queer people were always a positive in my life. In other words, were weren't very good Mormons. I couldn't really pinpoint when it all went awry for me. I remember being involved in CA Prop 22 (the precursor to Prop 8), and from there the church just kept getting less and&mldr;\n\nsallygirl75\n\n1. I couldn’t ever stomach the idea of telling anyone that Mormonism was the only way back to God. It just seemed so inefficient to me that a loving God would restrict that truth from centuries of people throughout history and billions of people on earth now. 2. Mormon temples have areas restricted only to adult members of the church who are worthy to enter. As a woman, that meant I needed to be either going on a mission or getting married. Since I chose not to serve a mission and didn’t have any marriage prospects, I couldn’t go through until I was 25, no matter the fact that I had several bishops ask me if I wanted to work&mldr;\n\nI suffered from severe scrupulosity (religious OCD) and felt I was constantly a sinner. I never realized that the Church membership made up less than 0.2% of the world population, and the amount of active believers was far less than that. In my late 20s, I began reading the Church’s “Gospel Topics Essays”, and quickly began feeling uneasy with the history of the Church. I spent 5 years reading everything I could about the history of the Church, Joseph Smith, and The Book of Mormon. I quickly realized the narrative taught in the Church is far from truthful, and doesn’t match the historical or scientific record. The Book of Mormon isn’t a historical account, it’s filled with anachronism.The Book of&mldr;\n\ndanieljohnson\n\nShortly before I got married I started questioning the Church on ordaining women and on the place of women in heaven. This was very hard for me. The temple wording did not help and sincerely broke me. No answers helped, and No blessing made it better. Nothing took my pain and heartache away except in the year I decided to stop attending. It’s been 12 years since I started questioning and been two full years since I decided to not be active in the Church. Due to my sincere belief in Christ I am taking steps to find a different Church and one that does practice female ordination.\n\ninactivewanderer\n\nThe racist behavior and malicious leanings of many members in Utah made me question my belief in the \"religion\" and God. How could a God just sit there and watch all the injustice, racism, and misleading information (done on its name) and do nothing? Discussions about those topics went nowhere and many just provided mental gymnastics. Those apologists puzzled me..They made me realize that \"truth\" was never the goal. I no longer believe in god, and finally found peace.\n\nelnene\n\nFrom my baptism at age 12, I had a shelf of \"unanswered questions\" in my head. That shelf grew and grew over time. When things piled up at age 48 so high at home, work and church so that I could see tomorrow things were going to get worse, not better, I contemplated ending my life. I was released. Soon thereafter I was sitting in sacrament meeting listening to my former high counselors speak on \"Be Ye Therefore Perfect Even As Your Father in Heave is Perfect\" and \"Even Your Thoughts Will Condemn You\" and my body began to shake and tremble. I got up and walked out and never went back. Members tried to drag me out of my&mldr;\n\njajisee\n\nI so wanted the church to be true. I enjoyed so many aspects of the church when I was growing up: dances and the annual Gold and Green Ball, Super Saturday, Road Shows, 3 and 4 day temple trips to the Washington temple (even got a White House tour back in the days when you just had to wait in line), our annual Winter Carnival. So many great memories. My first real crisis with church stuff came when I attempted to serve a mission. Was called to serve in Rome, Italy, and entered the MTC in the fall of 1990. I was dismayed at the hero worship of church leadership, the blind obedience to authority, and some of the general&mldr;\n\nswordsman1989\n\nI left because it's a cult and it's history is filled with lies and deceptions. I believe Jesus Christ is my Savior and He is all I need for Salvation.\n\njrtaylor\n\nThe Air Force was my first disillusionment with humanity. Officers are not necessarily Gentlemen. I wouldn't say I left the church. I am nuanced. But I can no longer associate myself with a crowd that has no respect for truth and honor. I was taught that the principle of \"infallibility\" is false because all men are fallible. That is what makes them men. If church leaders deny being men, then what are they? As a graduate student I got married in the SL Temple to a female who prided herself on her “acting” abilities. I later found out that meant her ability to fool people.

I had married a \"city girl\" with no interest in horses, country music, and as it turned out....no interest in me. We divorced after 25 yrs. of marriage. I then met another Mormon lady who had also just gone through a divorce. She was a country girl, grew up on a farm, so surely we would be compatible if we got married....WRONG. We did get married but I soon found out that it was the common thread of \"Mormon control\" in both marriages that was the problem. I divorced again and became inactive....searching for the \"truth\" or \"falsity\" of Mormonism. I began searching the internet&mldr;\n\nmoreman2\n\ni started researching all the messed up stuff the church did. when i hit the shock therapy groups for gay people, i just couldn't be a part of it any longer. i refuse to be part of a cult that demonizes, and endorses such violence against people just for being who they are.\n\nbaxxiefish\n\nTL;DR...just read the CES Letter. :)\n\njeremyrunnells\n\nMy parent's divorce was the beginning of my doubts. My family would not be together forever. I continued going to church until I was 16. When I gained my voice & spoke out against going to church, it was used as a punishment. Anything I said or did that was unfaithful was reprimanded by attending meetings, youth functions or talking to the bishop. I realized that there was a whole world outside of Mormonism. I saw the beauty & goodness in the very things I was taught were bad or wrong. I became a single, teenage mother. I knew that I would never force my opinions or beliefs on my children the way my father's were forced on me.\n\nmbreaux\n\nIn my early 50s, I came to terms with the fact that my biological father was narcissistic. I realized I had gone straight from a controlling father to a high control organization. My precious teenager came out as queer. This child had never believed in the church either. I knew she wasn't going to stay in the church & I knew she was going to live an authentic life as a queer person. So where would this leave us as a family? I couldn't take it anymore. I decided I wasn't going to make it to the celestial kingdom & that was going to be okay. I just wanted us all to be happy in this life. I wanted my&mldr;\n\nlostinbetween22\n\nWhen the church began openly pushing against gay marriage in the late 90's and early 2000's, I struggled to reconcile that with the 11th Article of Faith, where we supposedly allow all others to worship according to their own conscience. But I believed in following the prophet, so I mostly kept my doubts to myself. Then in 2013, I moved from the heavily Mormon area in the Phoenix area I'd lived most of my life to Texas, and found myself working with openly gay coworkers for the first time. Getting to know actual people in the LGBTQ+ community, combined with a church scene where I no longer had the comfortable friendships I'd made with other more progressive and nuanced Mormons&mldr;\n\nanjaisagirl\n\nSee Above!\n\ngraydame\n\nThis was my resignation letter to my friends and family: \"Dear Friends and Family, This is my official resignation, my final testimony, if you will.

This was pre-internet, so I saved babysitting money to go to the local Christian Supply bookstore and Powells to buy books about Mormonism. I thought and cried and prayed and grew to know that Mormonism was not something that I could believe in. When I was 18 I met with my bishop and asked for my name to be removed from the records. I told my parents after the fact. I went to college and built a life for myself across the country. I don’t think I could have done this if I stayed in my hometown. I feel a sense of loss about&mldr;\n\nlucky\n\nA few years ago I was looking at the facsimiles in the Book of Abraham and I wondered “Did Joseph Smith translate those correctly?” At the time I found information from FairMormon which seemed reasonable to me, so I forgot about it. Fast forward to January 2015 where I felt prompted to do a web search on the Book of Abraham. In just a few minutes, I realized things were never going to be the same for me. The more I researched church history and doctrinal topics, the more I knew I could never go back to believing the way I had for 43 years of my life. Could people just quit believing in the truth claims of the church?&mldr;\n\nsteve\n\n2 years ago, I decided to leave. The majority of my immediate family are active, as well as extended family. We have a strong history in the church; my family was part of the Willie Handcart company who crossed the plains with the pioneers, so you can say I have deep roots in the church. After reading church essays and doing my own thinking about God and life, I realized I no longer believed in the things I was taught growing up. This was devastating for me. Like most people who leave the church, I wasn’t sure what I believed, what I would teach my children and where I would stand in my community. It was scary essentially “starting over”.&mldr;\n\nkiersten\n\nShel Silverstein wrote a poem titled The Voice. It says: There is a voice inside of you That whispers all day long, “I feel that this is right for me, I know that this is wrong.” No teacher, preacher, parent, friend Or wise man can decide What’s right for you – just listen to The voice that speaks inside. The church taught me to follow that voice, but only to a point. I was taught that if the voice contradicted the church, I should follow the church instead. This meant that for decades, I let men who purported to speak for god override my innate sense of right and wrong. When I prayed about my decision to leave the church,&mldr;\n\njennsings\n\nAs my own children got closer to eight, I thought about the children who are denied baptism because of their parent’s gender identity or marriage. And I thought about the questions my children might ask me someday. Why didn’t the Church allow people like me to hold the Priesthood? You see, my children are black. And I broke. And all the things that never made sense to me started whirling into focus. The sick feeling I had as prayer after prayer went unanswered was validated. My unhappiness while inside the chapel doors was real. It’s okay to not enjoy conference, or to question the prophet, or to ask for equality within religion.

I was born in the covenant, was baptized, married in the Temple at age 20, attended BYU and stayed home to raise my 2 children. Over the years, I slowly lost my identity and my voice. I forced myself into gender roles that conflicted with my personality and became someone I was not. I didn’t feel the same joy I felt in the church as a youth. After a traumatic experience that happened after my daughter was born, something inside me shifted. I gave myself permission to start looking into church history. I became aware of historical discrepancies that led to major angst with contemporary issues, especially&mldr;\n\nbritt\n\nMy first bout with doubts in the church happened in 2012 when I stumbled upon a youtube video exposing church history issues.

During this time I have felt freedom from guilt, anxiety, shame, and judgment. I no longer punish myself for falling short of perfection.

I began to be challenged with what I read in scriptures with what was being taught at church. I saw how church members could be judgemental and how the culture encouraged me to do the same. Eventually, I decided that I couldn’t do it anymore. I thought I was done with religion after leaving the LDS Church, but my wife encouraged me not to give up on spirtuality altogether.

I slowly began discovering who I was as an individual. I learned that my happiness doesn’t come from following a church. I began to discover and follow my own values.

In the end about 18 months after her death we decided together to leave the church. We found ourselves at the ages of 33 and 38 with four young children without the community we had always known. We didn’t lose all of it but most and it hurt. It’s been almost 3 years now and I could never go back.

Then one of my children came out as gay. Due to my progressive upbringing accepting this wasn’t a problem. But it became increasingly distressful to me to see how church leaders were not applying the golden rule to LGBT people. After about 6 years and a bout with depression, I decided to do some in depth studying about the truth claims of the LDS church.

I didn’t know what to believe. I didn’t know who I was. I’d have panic attacks walking into the chapel. I slowly became less active at church attending only once every 6 weeks or so.

I have realized that we don’t have to be perfect but strive to be true Christians and love and serve others. I have found joy at a non-denominational church where I truly feel has provided a fun and spirit-filled environment.\n\nalyssa\n\nWhen I began my faith crisis, one that began with resentment over the church’s stand on social issues and quickly delved into the validity of its history, it led to many long overdue and necessary discussions with my husband. One of the things that arose out of those discussions, while being honest with each other and ourselves for the first time in our lives, was that my husband is gay. I had married my best friend, and any issues we had were easily overlooked by the belief that sacrifice was necessary while building and maintaining our eternal family. The night he came out to me, I saw one overwhelming emotion in his face: relief. Even though we knew life would&mldr;\n\namylin\n\nI met a lot of amazing people and had some great experiences, but through it all, I never felt like I quite fit in, never felt like I was in the right place, never felt like my beliefs totally fell in line with those in the LDS church. The more I grew, and the more I learned, the greater that divide became until it hurt too much to stay. At first I left to give myself time to think, time to pray, plead with God to help me find a way to fit in. My prayers were answered but not how I expected. I had several occasions to go to Community of Christ and partake in services, and every time&mldr;\n\nemily\n\nWhen I had to face the reality that my children wouldn’t be with me in the Celestial Kingdom, I had to consider the ramifications of this “reality.” Ultimately it was finding that place of NON-JUDGMENT, PEACE, and UNCONDITIONAL LOVE within ME that caused me to walk away from the LDS church. It has been over three years since I left. I had been Mormon for 42 years! Things haven’t been perfect, but they have been REAL. I have REAL conversations with my children and others now, and we dare to talk about the things we DON’T KNOW or DON’T UNDERSTAND. We look forward to growing,and stretching our minds and consciousness in ways that seemed to be constricted before. We honor&mldr;\n\njustme\n\nI was driving down the road on a cool winter morning almost two years ago, listening to a woman on the radio tell of her experience growing up Jewish—all the quirks, the contradictions, the beauty of life in that religion. Though I knew little of Judaism, I felt a connection to that woman in a deeper way than I would have imagined. At that time my heart and mind were weighed down. I had grown up a member of the LDS Church, and had believed so deeply in its tenets that it had become the center of all that I thought and did. I knew—KNEW—that there was a God who loved me, that there was something greater than this life.&mldr;\n\nPeace of Mind\n\nHowever at a young age, I chose to become inactive. I was a very confused young adult with a lot of questions. The answer I was given: to pray… which I did but I still felt very unsure about the teachings. I knew with what I felt in my heart, I needed to distance myself to figure out my place in the church. I struggled a lot with this throughout my early and mid-20s. The judgment from my peers hurt and not feeling accepted damaged my confidence. I had no self-love. It took a lot of years and lot of self-discovery to really find that I didn’t need religion to tell me what kind of person to be and how&mldr;\n\nbrandi\n\nI gathered the courage to leave it about two and a half years ago. Though consequently, it resulted in a divorce, I have never been happier. I am now free to live, think and feel how I want to. I live my life on my own terms. I’ve made friends more sincere than those in the church I’ve known my whole life. I’ve come to get to know myself and gained great self-confidence. I’m also now able to be a great Dad on my own terms. I’ve gone from confusion and suppression to joy and freedom, and love my life now.\n\nnick\n\nMy disillusionment took 7 years. My ego was broken, all the things I had previously known were iconoclastically dashed against rocks, and I had to recreate myself. My rebirth included painfully distancing myself from my family and friends, the end of my Temple marriage, a major career change, and a seemingly endless existential black hole. But it was exactly what I needed. I began reading Eastern Philosophy and made an intense study of Zen and Yogic practices. I searched out the things that felt true from a variety of traditions and voices of wisdom and reason. I traveled a lot. Through all of this, I finally began to experience my own soul. Now, outside of the confines of the Church,&mldr;\n\nRichard\n\nIn 2013, after doing months of my own research, I decided I couldn’t believe it anymore. There was just too much. It was one thing after another and it all just fell. I felt betrayed but also relieved. During that time I became close to friends that identified as gay. I had a hard time believing any God that I wanted to believe in, would create someone a certain way and then tell them that it was wrong. I knew that I didn’t fit anymore. The church was no longer a positive thing for the person I wanted to be.\n\nsalena\n\nI left the church because the mother of my children had the courage to support Kate Kelly and showed me the research. We began digging and digging and like an onion peeled away the layers of excuses, lies, and abuse. The church's own history is why we left and are finding happiness. Our children will grow with truth and the skills to discern right from wrong. They will explore and grow without the weight to conform crushing their souls. People are meant to be free to have an equal shot at life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We have gone to a place where we can give our children the best shot at it.\n\njoeingilbert\n\nWhen my mom passed away, though it was the hardest time in my teenage life, I suddenly had a lot of thinking to do. I was slow at first, but when I was on the fence about deciding to stay or not, a chain of events pushed me over. I want to say that the journey to self-discovery was a very hard one. Each step of the way I was hesitant, and I would ask family and siblings for help only to be reprimanded for questioning. I went from knowing where I was in the church as a child of god, to realizing I didn’t know who I was at all. This is the part where we are tested the&mldr;\n\nKai\n\nMy faith crisis started while serving as their High Priest Group Leader for my ward in January of 2016. Though we lost many good friends and damaged relationships with family and other friends, we have ended up on the back side of our transition with a feeling of love for our friends and family that are still believing, and a much better respect and understanding for those outside our faith, and those that are often marginalized in it. As a believing member, I loved service. I loved to home teach and felt a great responsibility toward developing a love and relationship with those I home taught. Even though it has been over 6 months since my family left, I still&mldr;\n\nDario\n\nAbout 3 years ago I experienced my faith transition. While it’s hard to nail the start of the process as it could have been in childhood, when I had cancer, sometime on the mission, or 4 years ago, but after much prayer, questioning, thinking, and studying– I felt it was no longer true. Since I have left many things have stayed the same. My friends and family accept me for the most part. I love my family and seek after things that are true and good, but I don’t rely on authority figures to tell me what’s true. I try to make others laugh, I try to make beautiful things, and try to live in an exciting and ironic way&mldr;\n\nWhen I started to see the gap between the values of love and acceptance I was teaching my children versus the teachings of the church I realized I could no longer raise them in that environment. After leaving, my marriage is still strong, my children are loved and I feel valued! My life is free, my time is spent with my family and I am happy. I never dreamed I could have lasting relationships with friends and family after leaving but I do! We communicate and we love. Hearts were broken and mended. If you think you can’t…you can. You are not alone. There is life outside and it is beautiful!\n\nineverdreamediwouldhave\n\nI was very dedicated until I was 33, even though I struggled with being a single, queer Mormon. I came out when I turned 30, and stayed in the church. Last year, after the ruling on Marriage Equality, I stopped going. I didn’t give up on the church until November of last year, with the policy. My shelf shattered and I realized, to be happy and healthy I needed to move on. I resigned my membership. I found a committed, fulfilling, and truly loving relationship with a woman in July 2015. I got engaged a year later. It didn’t work out, but it was one of the best experiences of my life. I have found friends and community all around&mldr;\n\nmandi\n\nI realized I was a lesbian when I was in 6th grade. Between 9th & 10th grade I came out to my mom who wasn’t surprised at all. I didn’t come out to my dad until 2 years ago as he was planning marriage to my stepmom. My mom tried hard to help me find a way to negotiate being lesbian and Mormon. But there was no logical path to follow where I could maintain my membership and still be in a happy relationship with a woman. A little over a year ago we started attending Community of Christ. When the policy change happened I realized I had found my home in Community of Christ. It is here where I’m&mldr;\n\nkaralyn\n\nWe suddenly had time and motivation to comprehensively study the doctrine and history of our church. We soon ran into a mountain of factual information we had never been taught at church. A year of agonizing research later and it was clear to us that the essential narrative our church leaders had presented to us all our lives was not true. We reluctantly informed our Bishop what had happened, asked to be released from our callings and told him we would not be attending going forward.\n\njensens\n\nAfter 45 years of complete devotion, I left 3 years ago after finding out the truth that so many others have discovered. I have learned to follow my own spirit and to seek truth in the many places it can be found. I am closer to my conscience and spirit than I have ever been in my life, no longer bound by the contradictions of my own intuition not being in line with what someone else says I should think. I now see life and people as they are meant to be seen, with an open mind and heart. I am no longer bound by the restrictions on the type of people I am told can love. I started a&mldr;\n\nDanielle\n\nWhen people ask me why I became a Mormon, I tell them that I wanted to please God, and I believed that I could do that in Mormonism. No ulterior motives, no grand plan, just simplicity and the literal faith of a child. I (the Baptist I was) had a great respect for Scripture and a love for my Creator, and Mormonism gave me the chance to expand and act on that love while learning more about God and His mysteries than I’d ever dreamed. I found it incomprehensible then that everyone would not want this expanded, updated, self-correcting and plenary version of Christianity. It seemed all very black and white to me. My senior year of high school, an&mldr;\n\nlatayne\n\nI learned on my mission in San Francisco through intense study that I didn't believe anything I was teaching. Using emotion or \"the Spirit\", as the church teaches, to make decisions almost always leads to poor results. I try to follow and teach my children that obedience to logic is the answer (not religion) and leads to happiness. I went through the motions growing up trying to mimic my ambitious, zealous father who was a bishop, high councilor, and is now a patriarch. One of the most liberating feelings is becoming a philosophical atheist and shedding all the baggage the church saddled you with your whole life.\n\nderothschild\n\nAfter 25 years of church membership I became increasingly aware of rather significant differences between what I was taught as an “investigator” and what was being revealed by the church. I was very offended at having been lied to and intentionally deceived in order to close the baptism “sale”. If the church is true then lying about its history and beliefs made no sense to me. I was left to conclude that church leadership understood that the organization and history of the church was flawed and felt a need to maintain its image using false pretense. So I quit.\n\nflyinlate\n\nIn 1967 I found out about doctrinal bigotry and the consequences of dark skin or inherited blood. I felt sick to my stomach, cold. I was 10 years old. In wanderings, musings, askings, pleadings, God, this heavenly father, remained silent through the years. I was dying little by little with debilitating depression. No heavenly assurance, no peace. All exhausting pleadings ending in extended dispairing. I worked hard for mental health. I was living little by little. Mental health did not mix with Mormonism. I left breaking free from a box and a checklist. I left while finding good boundaries. I left while finding personal values. I shed the itchy pulpit phrases, “We must, we must. We should, we should.”\n\nlwilliams\n\nMy husband and I started considering starting a family, and I knew that I wanted to have a career. I started researching old conference talks, ensign articles, etc to see what the overall consensus was on women working outside the home, and it was obvious to me that while there was discussion of each woman can choose what's best for herself, the overwhelming expectation was to stay home and not work outside the home. I could only find a few quotes that even suggested it might be okay to work and be a mom. This was so hard for me because I knew that I wanted a career and aspirations outside the home, yet that didn’t seem to be the&mldr;\n\ncityjuice\n\nI gladly sacrificed to live the teachings of the church because I had been taught all my life that Jesus Christ is alive and that he personally leads the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and no other church on Earth. I believed that Joseph Smith talked to God face to face, that he translated the Book of Mormon, and that he lived and died as God’s chosen servant incapable of leading anyone astray. I believed that current leaders of the church are similarly connected to God and incapable of leading anyone astray. For decades I set aside all doubts, concerns, and questions that arose to challenge my faith, believing that leaders of the church knew better than I&mldr;\n\npdbrandt\n\nCHURCH ACTIVITY I was born in a small mining town in Southern Arizona near the border of Mexico. I was named after LDS Apostle Arza Alonzo Hinckley, uncle of Church president Gordon B. Hinckley. My grandparents were polygamists from the early Mormon colonies in Mexico. I grew up in a very strict Mormon family. We went to all of our meetings and paid our tithing. We had family prayer every morning and every night. We sang an LDS Church hymn every morning before family prayer. Our family often made the long pilgrimage from Southern Arizona to attend general conference in Salt Lake City. We considered it a great honor to listen to the prophets of God even if we had&mldr;\n\narzaevans\n\nFast forward 14 years and I was twice divorced with 2 children. Both men being liars and adulterous. The first even resorting to emotional abuse. I was depressed. Miserable. Felt inadequate. I had 14 years of talks about how my lack of sealings denied me the rights to my own children in “the next life”. Years of unanswered questions about how we’d have to just “wait and see” in the next life and to just have faith. Temple sessions essentially telling women that they’re less important than men. Years of a church dictating what UNDERWEAR I was allowed to wear. After the second divorce, I finally listened to the gut feelings that I’d had since joining. I started to research&mldr;\n\njennifer\n\nI left after 6 excruciating months of serious prayer over the policy change regarding the children of LGBTQ families. I was horrified but towed the party line. I found I could no longer remain an authentic, honest person by staying inside Mormonism. I felt complicit in the marginalizing of these people. This was so much more personal to me as my niece is gay and her and her wife have two beautiful daughters. I couldn’t stay.\n\ntraceybryant\n\nAs an adult I became not only more aware of the systemic problems found in a Church that seemed to have forgotten some of its founding principles (such as Article of Faith 9), but that I wasn’t alone in my pain. I was stifled by the expected role of me as a woman, and doing what church leaders had told me to do did not yield their promised rewards. I began to resent God. Ironically, discovering the Mormon feminist and activist community placed me on the path to reconcile with God. After years of trying to shore up my already broken shelf I had a powerful spiritual moment where God told me He loved me, and that it was OK&mldr;\n\nmlisaglyndwr\n\nI was full on TBM who had built up a reputation on my mission and at home as someone who could defend anything and everything about the church with anything (secular/philosophical knowledge and/or spiritual/testimony, etc) and had just walked out of the Legacy Theater in the JS memorial building, after having watched the JS movie there. In the intro to the film, JS's adoptive daughter was talking to Emma in her later years and it mentioned that Emma struggled with JS's polygamy. After exiting the building I noticed that bronze statue of Emma and Joseph in a depiction of how much love they must have had for each other. I thought to myself, God wouldn't allow any mockery of marriage,&mldr;\n\nragin2cajun\n\nWhy I left. There is not a simple answer to that. But that is what I was looking for, answers. In early 2017 I started my “journey” out of the church. It started slow, with just questions. Then it snowballed. At the time of all of this, I was married with 3 kids. My wife wanted nothing to do with any of the things I was learning, nothing to do with the questions I was asking. As it all did come apart over the course of a few months, I went from full mormon to, “physically in, mentally out,” to no longer wearing garments, to no longer participating at all. By May, I was basically out. My wife and kids&mldr;\n\ndranswers\n\nIn the summer of 2017 I found out that my daughter, when she was 12 years old, was asked sexually explicit questions behind the closed doors of a bishop. This introduced her to pornography, and introduced her to masturbation. I had no idea this happened until 10 years after she left the young women's program. Now that got me very upset to hear this was done to my child! Then I found out it happened to three more but my children. So four out of my six children were asked sexual explicit questions behind a closed door. I knew, everybody in the world knows that's wrong, dead wrong, except members of our church. I believe that the Apostles even know&mldr;\n\nsam-young\n\nAs a new convert I wanted to become a full time CES professional after graduation from college. After teaching elementary school near Yakima, Washington I worked full time for the LDS Church Education system from 1975-2002. I was a Release-Time Seminary Principal, CES Coordinator, Institute Faculty and an Institute Director. I worked hard to become a noted defender of the church. I read everything, developed elaborate outlines and notes. I outlined chapters of the scriptures (all of them), with commentary. The Mark Hofmann forgeries and murders troubled me. How was he able to trick the inspired leaders of the church? He made them look like gullible old men, no more inspired than \"normal\" people, eager to cover up embarrassing historical&mldr;\n\nkenclark\n\n10 years ago as a gay, newly divorced father of four and former Mormon, where I would go and what I would do was indeed the looming question. A lifetime of seminary, sunday school, priesthood, mission, BYU and church leadership had me imagining myself at best as a drug addicted felon like Matt Foley living in a van down by the river with no friends, family, job. At worst, I’d lose my family in the eternities. The fear is real. And some of it is well-founded. I had a difficult time financially and emotionally for several years. Divorce in and of itself can and often does do that to a man.

I was on board and excited about the chance to strengthen my testimony about it and dove in head first to that challenge. I encouraged all my family members to participate as well. My attitude and heart were right, but as I read, my logical mind took over and I found myself doubting the validity of it. I had a few specific, but strong issues with it that I struggled with but I put them on a shelf in the back of my mind. A few years later, in a High Priest&mldr;\n\nBrent Hale\n\nI came of age in the 1970’s in the “mission field”. I was the overlooked middleish child, was listening to the siren songs of women’s liberation, the opening gay pride movement and my own north star. When I received my own copy of “Fascinating Girlhood” (I was not delighted) from my YMMIA leader, I decided right then and there that I wanted to travel a more interesting and fulfilling road. I had worked close to full time since I was 13 (more because my “mother” did not want me around the house, than not desire on my part) and on Saturdays I was dropped off at the library at 9am and left to my own devices until pickup around 6pm&mldr;\n\nI learned a lot of things from being an active member, a bishop’s daughter, and a youth leader. I learned to how to be confident speaking in front of a large group, I learned about community service, family bonds and coordinating large events. I learned a lot of good things from the Mormon church, but what took me the longest was to learn how happy I could be without it. I struggled in high school and then my early years of college to decide if it was truly where I belonged. I felt pressure from church leaders, peers, family members, and seminary teachers. I felt that overwhelming pressure that makes you cry yourself to sleep, hum songs in your head&mldr;\n\nsarah\n\nThe only area of doubt for me, in the beginning, was polygamy, and I almost stopped attending over that.

After reading the most problematic one (for my husband and me) titled \"Race & the Priesthood,\" I was dumbfounded. How can the church say that Brigham Young was a prophet BUT he was a product of his time to explain his support of SLAVERY, for heaven's sake!
