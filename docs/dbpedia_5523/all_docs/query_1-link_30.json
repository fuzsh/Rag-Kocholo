It serves as the permanent home of Southeastern Oklahoma State University’s extensive Native American Art Collection that represents 26 federally recognized tribes and 80 plus artists.\n\nThe 5,000 square-foot multi-level facility features an art gallery, an audio-visual room, reception area, storage, a balcony and walkout patio. The patio overlooks the historic Amphitheater, which was built by Southeastern students. Professors C.B. French (a cousin of the Semples), and E.B. Robbins directed the students though the construction, which was funded by the Civil Works Administration in 1934.\n\nThe establishment of such a museum had been on the minds of the Semples for a number of years.\n\nFrank Semple, a retired energy industry executive, Janie Semple Umsted, a local artist and curator of the Museum, and Sarah Semple Brown, a Denver-based architect who designed the museum, were raised in Durant and are sixth-generation Oklahomans. Their parents were Dr. Allen William Semple and Jane French Semple. Upon the death of their oldest brother, Bill (Billy) in 2016, the dream of a museum became a family commitment.\n\nThe Semple Family are members of the Choctaw Nation and direct descendants of their grandfather Charles Carl Semple, an original enrollee.\n\nThe late Dr. Herbert J. “Herb” Taylor did pioneer work in the fields of chromosomes and DNA. He verified by experiment, many of the theories that Francis Crick and James Watson held with regards to DNA. Crick and Watson, along with Maurice Wilkins, won the 1962 Nobel Prize in Medicine for their discovery of the structure of DNA.\n\nIn 2006, a Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory textbook stated that Taylor “comes as close as anyone to being considered the father of the field of chromosomes.” He published more than 100 scholarly papers in the field. In 1960, Taylor co-founded the American Society for Cell Biology, which is still active today. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1977, which is one of the highest honors a scientist can hold.\n\nTaylor graduated from Southeastern in 1939 with a double major in biology and mathematics. In 1941, he received his M.S. in botany and bacteriology from the University of Oklahoma and in 1944, received his PhD in Biology from the University of Virginia. Taylor took time off from his studies during World War II to serve in the South Pacific as a sergeant in the Army Medical Corps. After the war, he became an assistant professor of botany, first at the University of Oklahoma, then the University of Tennessee, and then landing in 1951 at Columbia University. Taylor’s final stop was at Florida State University, where he was hired as an associate professor of botany and later became a full professor of cell biology.\n\nThe Corsicana, Texas, native died in 1998 at the age of 82. In 2005, Florida State University published his biography entitled, J. Herbert Taylor: DNA Pioneer.\n\nCol.

This work led to new training by the OAS for the Oklahoma State Crime Bureau in the field recovery of crime scene evidence.\n\nSpivey has been recognized as a preeminent historian of southwest Oklahoma. He was Historic Archeologist for a joint project of OAS and the Oklahoma Historical Society that led to a fully restored South Barracks at Fort Washita Historic Site.
