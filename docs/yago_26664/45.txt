Lady Elizabeth Percy (c. 1395 – 26 October 1436) was the daughter of Sir Henry Percy, known to history as 'Hotspur', and Elizabeth Mortimer, the eldest daughter of Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March, and his wife, Philippa, the only child of Lionel, 1st Duke of Clarence, and Elizabeth de Burgh, Countess of Ulster. After the death of Sir Henry Percy, Elizabeth Mortimer married, sometime after 3 June 1406, Thomas de Camoys, 1st Baron Camoys, who later commanded the rearguard of the English army at the Battle of Agincourt.

By her mother's first marriage to Sir Henry Percy, Elizabeth Percy had one brother, Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland (3 February 1393 – 22 May 1455), who married Eleanor Neville (died c. 1473), widow of Richard le Despenser, and daughter of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland, by his second wife, Joan Beaufort, legitimated daughter of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster. They had nine sons and three daughters. He was slain at the First Battle of St Albans during the Wars of the Roses.
