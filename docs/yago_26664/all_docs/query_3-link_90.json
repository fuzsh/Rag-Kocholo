The majority of the business records were burnt by John Stuart Mortimer upon the sale of the company in 1932. Most of the family papers were later dispersed by him in the sale of his possessions at Hoo Meavy Farm in 1990. The manuscripts in this collection were largely given to his son John Stephen Mortimer by Audrey Pleasance Louise Mortimer. She described them in a covering note as old bills and letters removed from Coburg Street Works (circa 1817, 1825) etc etc mostly relating to Mrs Rachel Mortimer, Mr William Mortimer & John Forrester Mortimer my grandfather. Examined 1973 by Audrey P L Mortimer. The copper advertising plates were given to John Stephen Mortimer by his father, John Stuart Mortimer. The photographs of the family came from a number of sources.\n\nThe Mortimer family descends from William Mortimore who married Grace Pool (1696-1773) of Combeinteignhead in 1728. Their eldest son, John Mortimore (1733-1796), married Rose Terry of Stokeinteignhead in 1764, he being at that time a sailor. Seven months after the death of his first wife in 1780, he remarried and sold the last of his remaining freehold property in Combeinteignhead. He was buried in Combeinteignhead churchyard sixteen years later. It is not clear whether this John Mortimore was a dyer and cleaner by trade who found himself inadvertantly employed at sea. Certainly it is possible, since both his sons were able to set themselves up in the business. Furthermore, the traditional date for the foundation of the family firm is 1773 - a date when his sons were too young to have begun to learn the craft. However, there is no evidence that John Mortimore practised as a dyer or fuller: no tradesman of that name is mentioned in early Plymouth directories and there are no records of his apprenticeship amongst the records of the Inland Revenue. What is probable is that Johns two sons, John (1768-1825) and William (1773-1823), were both apprenticed to a Plymouth fuller and dyer, from whom they learned their trade.\n\nThe businesses of the two brothers were similar. William Mortimers letterhead states that he, as a dyer and scourer, undertook to dye silks, satins, woollens, bombazeens, tabinets, feathers, chip and straw hats, veils, lace, crapes &c... in all the various colours, on the most reasonable terms while John was described as a fuller and dyer. Their respective fortunes also followed similar paths, each brother being able to open a shop to deal with Devonport customers as well as a Plymouth headquarters. In Johns case, his Devonport shop was situated at 109 Fore Street and his residence and works at Mill Street, Plymouth; Williams Devonport shop was at 36 Fore Street and his residence and works at 2 Drake Street. Given the similarity in their standing in the trade and in the community, one might have expected these two brothers to have made a partnership of their dyeing and scouring businesses. However, nowhere do their names appear printed or even written together. This is all the more surprising given their religious links. Both were members of the New Tabernacle and Princess Street independent chapels; indeed John was a Deacon of the New Tabernacle in 1817 and the books described in Williams inventory at his death in 1823 show him to have been of a similar evangelical disposition. One can only assume that their businesses were purely individual affairs and, given the lack of industrialization of the time, unlikely to benefit from any partnership. Indeed, some idea of the small scale of operations (and the brothers social standing) can be gleaned from the value of trade and personal effects in the inventory made after the death of William in 1823. His goods amounted in value to £244 18s 7d, of which £117 2s 9d was dyeing utensils and shop fittings.\n\nJohn Mortimer junior (1797-1834), eldest son of John Mortimer and his wife Patience Hammick (1766-1813), inherited Williams business in 1823 and appears to have managed it from the Drake Street works until his fathers death in 1825, whereupon he managed both businesses as one. John had been apprenticed to his father in 1812 and seems to have taken on both his business and family duties with an admirable conscientiousness; he took care of his uncles children and rationalized his uncles and fathers businesses into one concern. However, whatever ambitions he may have had for the firm were thwarted by an outbreak of cholera in Plymouth in 1834. He left two children: Rose Bramble Mortimer (1825-1892) and John Forrester Mortimer (1827-1900). The business passed to his widow, Rachel (1795-1860), whom he had married in 1823.\n\nUnder the control of Rachel Mortimer the family firm experienced a period of consolidated growth and the family itself a period of greater prosperity. In 1841, the family were still resident in Mill Street. John Forrester and Rose were away at the time of the census (presumably at boarding school) and Rachel Mortimer was sharing her house with Elizabeth Hore (a dyeshop maid) and John Gillard and Mary Edwards (apprentice dyers). In the census of 1851, Rachel Mortimer, John Forrester and Rose were listed as being resident at Bedford Street, along with Elizabeth Hore and Mary Giles, dyeing assistants (aged fifty and 23 respectively), and a servant, Grace Blatchford, (aged thirty). The family finances were in good shape when Rachel handed the running of the firm over to her son John Forrester (in about 1853). Rachel died in 1860, leaving goods worth nearly £600 and being buried in a new family vault in Plymouth.\n\nJohn Forrester Mortimer was, like his mother, more of a businessman than a dyer and cleaner. Under his authority the family business became mechanised and expanded in scope beyond Plymouth. In 1850, Mortimers was doing business at just two addresses: 109 Fore Street, Devonport, and the Mill Street (later Cobourg Street) works. By 1883, he had opened further branches in Brighton, Bristol, London (three), Oxford and Salisbury. By 1897, there were four branches in Devon alone: Queen Street Exeter, Old Town Street and Cobourg Street, Plymouth, and Torwood Street, Torquay. Furthermore, the volume of the work undertaken rose proportionately; at the time of the article in The British Journal of Commerce (1888) the family had more than 150 employees and offices in many towns. John Forrester Mortimer married Louisa (1827-1905), daughter of John Burgoyne and his wife Elizabeth Trist, in Exeter in 1852. They had four surviving children - John Frank, Forrester, Kate (1859-1936) and Louisa (1856-1954). He died in 1900, having taken to collecting paintings, showing dogs, rare breed chickens, etc, and assuming various local responsibilities such as a special constable and councillor of Plymouth. He left an estate worth £23,000.\n\nJohn Frank Mortimer (1857-1929) and his brother Forrester (1863-1927) were both educated at Totnes School. Between them, they continued the family business, Forrester acting for a while as manager of the three London offices while John Frank became a partner in his fathers firm. The two brothers were close and pursued their interests (the business, collecting paintings and betting on horse races) together. John Frank especially furthered the firms interests by taking trips abroad (to Germany in particular) to investigate new methods of (and substances for) dyeing. However, competition for the trade was increasing. In 1913 the Co-operative Society opened a laundry in Plymouth. Moreover, the business of the Millbay Laundry Co Ltd was winning trade from Mortimers. Therefore, John Frank and his brother sought new markets and opened more branches; in 1916 they had sixteen branches in the south west (Bristol, Exeter, Torquay, Penzance, Bournemouth, Barnstaple, Yeovil, Taunton, Redruth, Falmouth, Exmouth, Newquay, Truro and three in Plymouth) in addition to the main works at Cobourg Street. Perhaps because of the increased financial risk involved in this expansion, they incorporated the business as Mortimers (Plymouth) Ltd in December 1914.\n\nJohn Frank married Catherine Ellen Terry (1863-1946), daughter of Albert Terry of Lydd, in 1883 and had three children: John Stuart, Frank Terence (1905-1986) and Audrey Pleasance Louise (1908-1975). Forrester married Maud Mapson in 1896 but she died tragically in childbirth the following year. He never re-married. John Stuart Mortimer (1904-1990) was educated at Kelly College, Tavistock. He was the last member of the family to be connected with the firm. Neither he nor his brother Terence were interested in investing in the company and it soon weakened in the face of competition from the Millbay Laundry Company Ltd. In 1932 the ailing business was sold; Millbay Laundry Co Ltd then absorbed the branches of Mortimers, closed the Cobourg Street works and kept only the Cobourg Street shop open. In 1941, the Cobourg Street site was levelled. The Millbay-owned company still carried the name Mortimers (Plymouth) Ltd until 1958 when it became the Millbay and Newquay Laundry Co Ltd. This latter company was dissolved in 1987.\n\nJohn Stuart Mortimer had already begun to invest in property before the sale of the company in 1932. While his father was still alive he had bought two run-down buildings in Cobourg Lane (behind Cobourg Street) for £50. Despite losing heavily in the war, he continued to invest in property for the rest of his life, borrowing money in order to buy cheap property which he renovated for sale or to let. He died, leaving an estate worth £962,000, in 1990. John Stuart Mortimer married Florence Mabel Beard (1902-1987) in 1929.They separated in 1945 and divorced in 1970. He remarried in 1988. His papers and most of the family possessions were dispersed in a clearance of his house, Hoo Meavy Farm, near Yelverton, just before his death in 1990.\n\nback to top\n\nSummary report\n\nBusiness and family papers\n\nN.B.

Witness my hand this 7th March 1823\n\nJohn [?Laddor - signature not clear] Appraiser\n\nback to top\n\nLetter from Mary Mortimer to Mrs John Mortimer c1830 A/9\n\nMy dear Cousin,\n\nYou no doubt have expected to hear from me before this time but I am sure you will forgive me when I tell you that want of time has been the only reason why you have not done so. I have only heard from my dear brother twice since I left Plymouth but I can willingly excuse him - I dare say he has ought else to think about.\n\nI am longing to see my dear friends at Plymouth again. It appears years since I was parted from them. I was much disappointed that I could not see you and Agness before I left Plymouth. I fully expected to have done so as I was so long there after my time.\n\nI dare say you are anxious to know how I like Miss Tilly? I think I may say that I am as comfortable as I could have expected among strangers. I cannot but expect difficulties go where I will; one thing absence will teach me to value the comforts of home.\n\nHow are my little favourites Rose and Forrester? Dear little creatures, I am longing to hear little Forresters prattling tongue again. How is my Cousin John? I hope very well. Give my kind love to him. I hear Samuel is still with you. I hope he will procure a situation shortly.\n\nHow did you leave Mrs Berry and [?Trowt] when you were at Exeter? They have given me a kind invitation to spend my midsummer vacation with them. Do you still receive boxes from Falmouth? I suppose I could send you any time that way. I went to Falmouth last week & saw Miss Bond and Mrs Walter Clatworthy - they both desire to be kindly remembered to you & Cousin John.\n\nYou must not think me unkind that I do not write to you oftener for my time is very much occupied. I heard from Susan Small last week and from agness Heller today. She says you felt hurt at my not begging to be remembered to you in my letters. I really do not think that I have written one letter home without begging my very kind love to you. I hope you do not suppose that I could have forgotten you and shall always remember with gratitude the happy hours of former years when I was blessed with the love of a dear affectionate parent. But their recollection altho so dear is painful - and it is when I recall them that I feel myself truly an orphan. Never did I feel the loss of that dear parent more than now. But I ought not to murmur; I have no doubt but that he was taken for some wise end. You know as well as I do what an affectionate father he was - you must then fancy how in moments of reflection I feel his loss. But I am sure I cannot dwell on this subject without doing violence to your feelings as well as my own; therefore I will drop it. But I must once more beg you not to fancy you are forgotten - your kindness to my inestimable parent during his last illness will prevent me from doing that and also his attachment to you.\n\nI hope to see you all again in less than 10 weeks. You must suppose the anticipation of it makes me very happy. I will endeavour to write to you again before then. Give my kind love to Mr & Mrs Small and family & my Aunt Mortimer and Mrs Bramble & all friends. I suppose your mothers strength is failing. I shall be very glad to hear from you the next time William sends. He can send every Monday by the carts so may I expect a letter very soon? If it is ever so short I shall receive it with pleasure. Again begging you to remember me to Mr M & kiss the dear children for me.\n\nI will say adieu and believe me yours affectionately\n\nMary Mortimer\n\nGive my every kind love to Mr & Mrs Pearce - I hear I have another little cousin: is it a boy or a little girl?\n\nAdieu once more\n\nback to top\n\nJohn Forrester Mortimers speech at the Annual Festival for 1877 A/35\n\nI thank you very sincerely for the manner in which you have received the toast, and responded to it, and I trust that you all and I may long live to see the wish gratified. Continued prosperity to the West of England Dyeing Works.\n\nThere cannot be much doubt that this is the wish of all of us. Old and Young. Of the old because of their age, and with many of them, the great length of time that they have been here - for perhaps it will be interesting to you to know that there is amongst us one who has been connected with the place for 60 years, Two nearly 50 years, another 46 years and another 38 years - And then I maintain that it must be the wish of the young, because of their coming and associating themselves with us, and for their encouragement as well as for the older hands, I would say that it is always my wish and endeavour to push forward any who show by their actions that they have a desire to promote the general welfare. My excellent helper Mr Hardy knows this and always has his eye open in going round.\n\nIt is gratifying to me to be able to say that notwithstanding a vigorous opposition from the largest firm in the trade in Scotland we have done as well as ever in all our branches, whilst we have opened many new ones with very great success. Indeed we never had so many hands employed as we have had during the last fall.\n\nI might mention curtains, feathers and gloves in particular -\n\nThere are many other departments which we have gone into lately, that have never been attempted before in this part of the country. I look upon these successes as being greatly owing to my good foreman and leading hands, who have shewn such energy and ability.\n\nThere are just two other things I would like to mention before I finish - The first is that I have just got out as some of you know a new list and scale of sick pay - you all know that if any are absent through illness, they are not at once thrown \"overboard\" or on their \"beam ends\" but for some considerable time receive half pay according to length of service. I trust you will all agree that this new scale which I have issued is fair and just.\n\nLastly I would remind you that my old hands are never turned away when unfit for work but that there have been some, that there will be others and doubtless will be more still who when they could work no more, have received, are receiving and will receive a pension sufficient to keep them from any trouble about their future.\n\nAnd now upon this first day of the New Year 1878 - I would wish you in the same old words yet none the less felt because they are old - a very Happy and prosperous New Year.\n\nback to top\n\nCatherine Mortimers notes of a journey to Paris A/41b\n\nTravelled from Plymouth to Waterloo with J.

Once again, setting Nature aside for the moment, how many admire a striking colour or the exquisite blending of tones and tints in some of the garments now worn, yet how few of us pause for one instant to reflect upon the history of the colours, and give the credit which is due to the worker in the dyers art. We were led into some such reflection by a recent visit to one of our leading dyeing works, during which we became much interested in those various processes through which the goods pass, which robbed them of their initial dullness and clothed them in ultimate beauty.\n\nThe above firm was founded by the grandfather of the senior partner, Mr J.F.Mortimer, the subject of our portrait. It was carried on in 1773 in a comparatively small way, a dozen hands sufficed for the entire concern, which, however, grew steadily until at the present moment over 150 hands are always employed, although machinery is employed as well in every nook and corner.\n\nThe premises extend over an acre of ground, and have nearly five acres of floorage, and some idea of the quantity of work turned out may be formed by the fact that of white window curtains alone as many as 1,000 pairs pass through the works in a single week. Goods are sent to the works from all parts of the world and the firm employ many hundred agents. Messrs. Mortimer are, besides, Gevernment contractors, and have at the present moment the contract for washing the navy and marine bedding , and for cleaning and re-making the hair beds used by the boys on board H.M. training ships, for which they have erected special plant.\n\nThe first department we were taken to was the dyeing-house, which contains over thirty large vats. These are principally of wood, but where acids are used, the vessels are of copper. The water is boiled by a steam pipe running into the vat. Here also is a machine for extracting the dye from logwood, etc. After the goods have remained in th vats long enough they are placed in one of the numerous drying-rooms. Dyed stuffs must be dried quickly or the colours will \"run,\" therefore a very high temperature is required, and this is produced by large coke stoves. After being made quite dry the goods are taken to the finishing-rooms. This is a very important department, for, as most of us that when a piece of silk or velvet has been dipped in water, the gloss is lost, therefore to make the article like new it is necessary to get the facing back again. This is done by placing the article on a frame, on each side of which is a row of fine steel pins. The piece of silk is thus stretched very tightly upon the frame, and then runs into its place in a box, which is heated by steam pipes, and by this process a fine gloss is obtained and all \"puckering\" prevented. Velvet is a very difficult article to deal with, a room being specially set apart for this class of goods. The fabric is put on a frame as before described, and heat is applied to the under-surface by means of steam and gas stoves, travelling on tramways which is essential for raising the pile, as when new.\n\nThe method of cleaning must now be described. The firm make a special point of what is known to the general public as the chemical cleaning process, and in order to carry this out in the most effective manner a separate building has been erected, and is fitted with the latest machinery. By this means the most delicate and costly fabrics may be trusted in the hands of Messrs. Mortimer to be most effectually cleaned, without injury to the material.\n\nThe method of cleaning by water is largely employed, especially in the case of lace and muslin curtains, fine silks, linen of every description, and various classes of fast-colour goods. Both handwork and every kind of machinery is used. The goods are placed in a somewhat interesting apparatus, which may be described as a zinc cylinder, with two compartments, the inner one being perforated and revolving in a mixture of soap and water. Inside the revolving drum there is a ledge which turns the clothes over and over as the drum goes round, so that the entire article is thoroughly cleaned. They are then dried, if possible in the sun, or in one of the heated rooms already described. Even upholstered furniture is cleaned by this enterprising firm. The furniture can be sent to them complete, and the chairs, sofas, etc., will be returned almost as good as new. We do not think that this is generally known, and our readers will do well before buying a new drawing room suite, to let Messrs. Mortimer try what they can with their \"old suite.\" In the damask-room the goods, after dyeing, are pressed between hot plates by a hydraulic machine, powerful enough to put on a weight of 200 tons.\n\nGarments that have been cleaned or dyed whole are all pressed by hand, and steam bolts are used for finishing the sleeves and small parts of the dress or coat, etc. In this particular department a number of hands are constantly employed. White lace window curtains are cleaned by a special machine, and, after being specially dried, are placed on a frame so arranged as to be able to take any sized curtain, and then placed in a similar box as the silk, etc. The frames and appliances used for these goods are the firms own invention.\n\nChintzes, druggetings, crumb-cloths, etc., are glazed by means of both hand and steam appliances. The workman rubs the fabric lightly with beeswax, and then places it on a concave wooden bench, over which is suspended, from a spring-board, a swinging arm-tool fitted at the end with a polished flint. By the means of a treadle which acts on the spring-board he brings the tool down upon he surface of the material , which, with a quick motion, rapidly produces the required glaze. An expert workman will glaze a large quantity of stuff with the hand-machine in a very short time, but it is needless to say that the steam tool is more rapid.\n\nThe principal portion of the machinery is worked by a fine engine of forty horse-power nominal, supplied by Messrs. Willoughby Bros., of Plymouth, six years ago, and it does them great credit. We consider the system of tracing the goods right through the works is perfect, and with the enormous quantity of articles continually passing through their hands, this is most important, and it is to the careful attention paid to every small detail of their business that Messrs. Mortimer chiefly attribute their success. With such perfect organization and enterprise even greater things may be expected of this firm, who, even now rank with the largest in their particular class of business, and are patronized by the leading aristocracy, which speaks well for the excellency of their workmanship. The present patners are John F. Mortimer and his son Mr J. Frank Mortimer, and valuable assistance is given by another son, Mr Forrester Mortimer, who until recently was manager of the London branches, the chief office of which being at 488, Harrow-road, W., and the West-end branch at 36, Brook-street, Grosvenor-square.\n\nback to top\n\nPrinted Mortimers Ltd envelope, listing the south west branches c1916\n\nCobourg Street, 3 Old Town Street and 71 Mutley Plain, Plymouth;\n\n82 Fore Street, Devonport;\n\n72 Queens Road, Bristol;\n\n90 Queen Street, Exeter;\n\n10 Torwood Street, Torquay;\n\n5 Market Place, Penzance;\n\n114 Old Christchurch Road, Bournemouth;\n\n16 High Street, Barnstaple;\n\n24 High Street, Yeovil;\n\n17 High Street, Taunton;\n\nWest End, Redruth;\n\n50 Arwenacle Street, Falmouth;\n\n15 Rolle Street, Exmouth;\n\nBank Street, Newquay;\n\n1 Cathedral Lane, Truro\n\nback to top\n\nTitle page of the family bible B/1\n\n<Account of the Birth of> The Children of John and Patiaence Mortimer <married the 8 April 1790>\n\n<A Boy still born Feb 21 1791>\n\nElizabeth Mortimer was Borne June 21st 1792\n\nRose Mortimer was Borne July 17th 1794\n\nJohn Mortimer was Borne August 23rd 1797 <Dyed July 9 1834>\n\nAnn Mortimer was Borne Febuary 13th 1799\n\nWilliam Mortimer was Borne March 21st 1801\n\n<William Dyed Janry 13 1803 on Thursday one oclock after noone>\n\n<A Girl still borne June 17 1803>\n\n<William was born July 20 Friday Morning 5 oclock 1804>\n\n<William died Wednsday Morn 8 clock July 8 1807>\n\n<Samuell was borne Thursday August 21 Half past 4 oclock after noone 1806>\n\n<Dyed August 8 1832> <½ past 4 P.M.>\n\nA Boy still Born February 28 1808\n\nAccount of the births of the Children of the above John & Rachel Mortimer\n\nRose Bramble Mortimer was born April 21st 1825 <Died August 23rd 1892>\n\nJohn Forrester Mortimer was born Febuary 9th 1827, married Louisa Burgoyne December 2nd 1852 whose children were born as follows\n\nA boy still born January 25th 1853\n\nLouisa Mortimer born January 25th 1856 <Died Jan 18th 1954>\n\nJohn Frank Mortimer born October 26th 1857 <Died March 12th 1929>\n\nKate Mortimer born June 16th 1859 <Died October 3rd 1936>\n\nMary Mortimer born December 9th 1860 <Died April 8th 1863 at 8.30 P.M.>\n\nForrester Mortimer born April 3rd 1863 <Died 1927>\n\nJohn Frank Mortimer married Catherine Ellen Terry December 13th 1883 whose children were born as follows\n\nA girl still born August 4rd [sic] 1896\n\nJohn Stuart Mortimer May 8th 1904\n\nFrank Terence Mortimer December 26th 1905\n\nAudrey Pleasance Louise January 7th 1908\n\nJohn Stuart Mortimer married Florence Mabel Beard April 6th 1929 whose children were born as follows\n\nJenefer Elizabeth Mortimer February 3rd 1930\n\nFlorence Angela Margaret Mortimer April 21st 1932\n\nJohn Stephen Mortimer June 27th 1935\n\nFrank Terence Mortimer married Hilda Mary Short September 4th 1928 whose children were born as follows\n\nShirley Catherine Mortimer August 3rd 1934\n\nElizabeth Juliet Tregarthen Mortimer September 14th 1943"
