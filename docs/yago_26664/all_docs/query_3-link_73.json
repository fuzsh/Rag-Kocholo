Mortimer Line\n\nThe family of Mortemer derives its name from Mortemer (Mortuo-Mari) in Pays-de-Caux at the source of the Eaulne River. The castle of St. Victor-en-Caux was the chief barony of the family, which is said to have sprung from a marriage of Walter de St. Martin and a niece of the Duchess Gonnor. It was possessed by Roger de Mortemer in 1054, on which date he was one of the commanders of Duke William's forces at the battle of Mortemer. He sheltered in his castle, after the battle, his father-in-law, Raoul III. the Great, Comte de Valois and d'Amiens, by Oderic Vital called de Montdidier, one of the French commanders, until he was able to conduct him safely to his own territories three days later. For this reason Roger was banished by Duke William and his estates confiscated. He was later pardoned and his possessions returned with the exception of the castle of Mortemer, which the Duke had given to Roger's brother, William de Warren I. He contributed sixty vassals to the fleet of Duke William and it is generally conceded that he was too old to have been present at Senlac, although he made a donation to the abbey of St. Ouen in 1074 and died prior to the compilation of the General Survey. Wace mentions \"Hue de Mortemer\" as having taken part in the battle. Many commentators believe this to be an error, contending that Wace should have chronicled Roger or his son, Ralph, or both, because the only recorded Hugh was the son of Ralph and therefore too young to have participated in this event. There is no proof, however, that if not of this branch of the family, a Hugh could not have sprung from another. Eyton says, \"There is evidence that Roger had two sons in addition to Ralph, namely, Hugh and William.\" Nevertheless, Ralph was certainly Roger's heir, and if the son of Hawisa, the only known wife of Roger, he must have been young at the time he attended the Conquest. He possessed at the compilation of Domesday 123 manors, in addition to the castle of Wigmore, in Herefordshire, which was the chief seat of his barony. In 1088 Ralph was opposed to William Rufus in favor of Robert Curthose (Courteheuse), but two years later, being pardoned, he accompanied Robert, Count of Eu, and Walter Giffard to Normandy, where they arrayed themselves against Duke Robert. In 1100 he founded the priory of Wigmore, at which time it was stated that Roger de Mortemer, descended from his family. Ralph, by his wife Millicent, had issue, Hugh, who succeeded him, William, to whom his brother gave Chelmarsh and who was ancestor of the Mortimers of Attleborough and Hawise, who married Stephen, Comte of Aumale. From this family descended the Lords of Wigmore, Earls of March, Lords Mortimer of Richard's Castle, etc. (Reference: Crispin & Macary, \"Falaise Rolls\").\n\n1. Roger de Mortimer, the first of this name upon record is deemed by some to have been the son of William de Warren, and by others, of Walter de St. Martin, brother of that William. Which Roger was the founder of the abbey of St. Victor, in Normandy. \"It is reported,\" says Dugdale, \"that in the year 1054 (which was twelve years before the Norman Conquest), when Odo, brother of Henry, King of France, invaded the territory of Evreux, Duke William sent this Roger, then his general (with Robert, Earl of Ewe, and other stout soldiers), to resist his attempts; who meeting with Odo near to the castle of Mortimer, gave him battle, and obtained a glorious victory. It is further observable of this Roger, that he was by consanguity allied to the Norman duke (Afterwards King, by the name of William the Conqueror), his mother being niece to Gunnora, wife of Richard, Duke of Normandy, great grandmother to the Conqueror.\" The presumed son of this Roger, was Ralph de Mortimer.\n\n2. Ralph de Mortimer, accompanying the Duke of Normandy in his expedition against England, was one of his principal commanders at the decisive battle of Hastings; and shortly after, as the most puissant of the victor's captains, was sent into the marches of Wales to encounter Edric, Earl of Shrewsbury, who still resisted the Norman yoke. This nobleman, after much difficulty, and a long siege in his castle of Wigmore, Mortimer subdued, and delivered into the king's hands. When, as a reward for his good service, he obtained a grant of all Edric's estates, and seated himself thenceforward at Wigmore. Independently of these great Welsh territorial possessions, Ralph Mortimer enjoyed by the bounty of his royal master sundry lordships and manors in other parts of the realm, which he held at the time of the General Survey. In the beginning of Rufus's reign, Mortimer took part with Curthose, but he subsequently changed sides, and being constituted general of the forces sent to oppose that prince in Normandy, by King Henry I., he totally routed the enemy, and brought Curthose prisoner to the king. He married Millicent ________, by whom he had issue:\n\n1. Hugh de Mortimer, his successor. See below.\n\n2. William de Mortimer, Lord of Chelmersh, and afterwards of Netherby.\n\n3. Robert de Mortimer, ancestor of the Mortimers, of Richard's Castle, (presumed son of or brother of the 1st Hugh de Mortimer, shown as a brother above), married Margery Ferrers, only daughter and heiress of Hugh de Ferrers, and grand-daughter of Hugh de Say, Lord of Richard's Castle, co. Hereford, by which alliance he acquired that, and other considerable manors, and in the 12th year of Henry II. he certified his knight's fees of his honor to be in number twenty-three. In the 17th year of King John he had a grant from the king of all the lands in Berwick, in Sussex, which had belonged to Mabel de Say, mother of Margery, his wife, and then in the possession of Robert Marmion, the younger. He died about the year 1219, and was succeeded by his son, Hugh.\n\n4. Hawise Mortimer, married Stephen, Earl of Albemarle.\n\nHe was succeeded by his son, Hugh.\n\n3. Hugh de Mortimer, being a person of a proud and turbulent spirit, opposed strenuously the accession of King Henry II., upon the demise of King Stephen, and induced Roger, Earl of Hereford, to fortify his castles of Gloucester and Hereford against the new monarch; himself doing the same with his castles of Cleobury, Wigmore, and Brugges (commonly called Bridgenorth). Whereupon Gilbert Foliot, at that time Bishop of Hereford, addressing himself to the Earl of Hereford (his kinsman), by fair persuasions soon brought him to peaceable submission. But Mortimer continued obstinate, the king was forced to raise an army, and at the point of the sword to bring him to obedience. Between this rude baron, and Joceas de Dynant, at that time Lord of Ludlow, existed a feud, carried to so fierce a pitch, that Dynant could not pass safely out of his castle for fear of being taken by Mortimer's men. But is so happened, that setting his spies to take all advantages of Dynant, he was surprised himself, and carried prisoner to Ludlow, where he was detained until he paid a ransom of 3,000 marks of silver. He was oftentimes engaged against the Welsh, and he erected some strong castles in Wales. He likewise finished the foundation of the abbey of Wigmore, begun by his father, and in his old age became a canon of that house. He married __________ and had issue as follows:\n\n1. Roger de Mortimer, his successor. See below.\n\n2. Hugh de Mortimer, married Felicia de Sancto Sydonio, and had, by gift of his father, the manors of Sudbury and Chelmers.\n\n3. Ralph de Mortimer.\n\n4. William de Mortimer.\n\nHe died in 1189, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Roger.\n\n4. Roger de Mortimer, Lord of Wigmore, like his predecessors, was in constant strife with the Welsh. At one time he sustained a great defeat in conjunction with Hugh de Say, but in the end he was victorious, and took twelve of their principal leaders in one battle. He also enlarged considerably his territories, and drove thieves and robbers from those parts. Being at one time present at the solemn anniversary of his father, he confirmed all his grants to the canons of Wigmore; adding, of his won gift, a spacious and fruitful pasture, lying adjacent to the abbey, called the Treasure of Mortimer. Upon which occasion his steward remonstrating him for parting with so valuable a treasure, re replied, \"I have laid up my treasure in that field, where thieves cannot steal or dig, or moth corrupt.\" This Roger married (1) Millicent Ferrers, daughter of Robert Ferrers, Earl of Derby, and had issue as follows:\n\n1. Hugh de Mortimer, the eldest son was his successor. This feudal lord in the baronial war adhered with unshaken fidelity to King John. In the 16th year of that monarch's reign he had military summons to attend the king at Cirencester, with the other Barons-Marchers. He married Annora Braose, daughter of William de Braose (which one?), and had 100 shillings in land with her. But having been severely wounded in a tournament, died in November, 1227, leaving no issue, when he was succeeded by his half-brother, Ralph.\n\n2. Daughter #1, _________ Mortimer, married Stephen le Gross.\n\n3. Joane Mortimer, married Walceline de Beauchamp. See continuation of this lineage in the Beauchamp Line.\n\nHe married (2) Isabel Ferrers, sister and heir of Hugh de Ferrers, of Oakham, in Rutlandshire, and of Lechelade and Lagebiry in Gloucestershire. All which lands he inherited upon the death of the said Hugh Ferrers. Roger and Isabel had three sons as follows:\n\n1. Ralph de Mortimer. See below.\n\n2. Robert de Mortimer.\n\n3. Philip de Mortimer.\n\nHe died in 1215, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Hugh.\n\n5. Ralph de Mortimer , half-brother to Hugh, succeeded him at his death. In the 12th year of King Henry III., paying 100 pounds for his relief, had livery of all his lands, lying in the cos. of Gloucester, Southampton, Berks, Salop, and Hereford. This nobleman being of martial disposition, erected several strong castles, by which he was enabled to extend his possessions against the Welsh; so that Prince Llewellyn, seeing that he could not successfully cope with him, gave him his daughterGladys (Gladuse) Dhu, daughter of Llewellyn the Great, and widow of Reginald de Braose, in marriage, and by this lady he had issue as follows:\n\n1. Roger de Mortimer, his successor. See below.\n\n2. Peter John de Mortimer, a grey friar at Shrewsbury.\n\n3. Hugh de Mortimer, of Chelmersh.\n\n4. Isolda Mortimer, married (1) Walter Balem, and (2) Hugh Audley, Lord Audley.\n\nHe died in 1246, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Roger.\n\n6. Roger de Mortimer , in the 31st year of King Henry III., paying 2,000 marks to the king, had livery of all his lands, excepting those whereof Gladys, his mother then surviving was endowed. In six years afterwards he attended the king in his expedition into Gascony, and in a few years subsequently, when Llewellyn, Prince of Wales, began again to make incursion upon the marches, received command to assist Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford, in the defense of the country lying between Montgomery, and the lands of the Earl of Gloucester. In the 42nd year of the same reign he had another military summons to march with the king against the Welsh; and being in that service, had a special discharge of his scutage for those twenty-six knights' fees and a sixth part which he held in right of Maud, his wife, one of the daughters and co-heirs of William de Braose, of Brecknock. In two years afterwards he was made captain-general of all the king's forces in Wales, all the barons marchers receiving command to be attendant on him with their whole strength; and he was the same year constituted the Governor of the castle of Hereford. But notwithstanding this extensive power, and those great resources, he was eventually worsted by Llewellyn, and constrained to sue for permission to depart, which the Welsh price conceded, owing to his consanguity. After this he took and active part in the contest between Henry III. and the insurrectionary barons in favor of the former. He was at the battle of Lewes, whence he fled into Wales, and afterwards successfully planned the escape of Prince Edward. Having accomplished his prince's freedom, Mortimer, directing all his energies to the embodying a sufficient force to meet the enemy, soon placed Prince Edward in a situation to fight and win the great battle of Evesham (August 4, 1265), by which the king was restored to his freedom and his crown. In the celebrated conflict Mortimer commanded the third division of the royal army, and for his faithful services obtained, in the October following, a grant of the whole earldom and honor of Oxford, and all other the lands of Robert de Vere, Earl of Oxford, at that time and by that treason forfeited. The Dictum of Kenilworth followed soon after the victory of Evesham, by which the defeated barons were suffered to regain their lands upon the payment of a stipulated fine, but this arrangement is said to have caused great irritation among the barons marchers, (Mortimer with the rest), who had acquired grants of these estates. He was, however, subsequently entrusted, by the crown, with the castle of Hereford, which he had orders to fortify, and was appointed Sheriff of Herefordshire. After the accession of Edward I., he continued to enjoy the sunshine of royal favor, and had other valuable grants from the crown. He married, as already stated above, Maud Braose, eldest daughter and a co-heir of William de Braose, of Brecknock. They had the following children:\n\n1. Ralph de Mortimer, d.v.p.\n\n2. Edmund de Mortimer, his successor. See below.\n\n3. Roger de Mortimer, 5th Lord of Wigmore, and lord of Chirke, part of the territories of Griffith ap Madoc, and was summoned to parliament from February 6, 1299, to November 3, 1396, as \"Roger de Mortuomari,\" and as Baron Mortimer, of Chirke, from August 26, 1307, to May 15, 1321 (See Burke, Page 385-6). Eventually, his grandson sold to the lordship of Chirke to Richard Fitz Alan, Earl of Arundel.\n\n4. William de Mortimer, of Bridgewater, an eminent soldier, married Hawise Musegros, heir of Robert de Musegros and his wife, Agnes Ferrers, but d.s.p.\n\n5. Geoffrey de Mortimer, d.s.p., d.v.p.\n\n6. Isabella Mortimer, married John Fitz Alan III See continuation if this lineage in the Fitz Alan Line in Volume II.\n\nUpon having procured the honor of knighthood to be conferred by King Edward I., he caused a tournament to be held, at his own cost, at Kenilworth, where he sumptuously entertained a hundred knights and as many ladies, for three days, the like whereof was never before known in England; and there began the round table, so called from the place wherein they practiced those feats, which was encompassed by a strong wall, in a circular form. Upon the 4th day the golden lion, in token of triumph, having been yielded to him, he carried it with all that company to Warwick. The fame whereof being spread into foreign countries occasioned the Queen of Navarre to send him certain wooden bottles, bound with golden bars and wax, under the pretense of wine, but in truth filled with gold, which for many ages after were preserved in the Abbey of Wigmore. Whereupon for the love of that queen, he had added a carbuncle to his arms. This celebrated feudal lord died in 1282, and was succeeded by his eldest surviving son, Edmund.\n\n7. Edmund Mortimer , Lord of Wigmore, born in 1261, fought constantly in the Welsh wars, and was mortally wounded in the battle of Buelt, dying July 17, 1304. He married Margaret Fiennes, daughter of William de Fiennes and his wife, Blanche Brienne, daughter of Jean de Brienne and his wife, Jeanne Chateaudun. She was the great granddaughter of Jean de Brienne, King of Jerusalem. In the 10th year of King Edward I., he succeeded his father, and the next year, doing his homage, had livery of his lands. He was afterwards constantly employed in the Welsh wars, and was summoned to parliament as a baron, from June 8, 1294, and from June 23, 1295, to June 2, 1302. He was mortally wounded at the battle of Buelt, against the Welsh, and dying almost immediately, at Wigmore Castle, was buried in the abbey there. He and his wife had the following children:\n\n1. Roger Mortimer, his successor. See below.\n\n2. John Mortimer, accidentally slain in a tournament at Worcester, in the 12th year of King Edward II., by John de Leyburne, being not more than eighteen years of age.\n\n3. Hugh Mortimer, a priest, rector of the church at old Radnor.\n\n4. Maud Mortimer, married Theobald de Verdon.\n\n5. Joan Mortimer, a nun.\n\n6. Elizabeth Mortimer, a nun.\n\nHe was succeeded by his eldest son, Roger.\n\n8. Roger Mortimer, 2nd Baron Mortimer, born in 1287, was summoned to parliament from February 22, 1306, to December 3, 1326 (from the accession of Edward II., with addition of \"De Wigmore\"). This nobleman, so notorious in the histories as the paramour of Isabel, Queen Consort of the unfortunate Edward II., was in his sixteenth year at the time of his father's death, and was placed by the king (Edward I.) in ward with Piers Gaveston, so that to redeem himself, and for permission to marry whom he pleased, he was obliged to pay Gaveston 2,500 marks, and thereupon married Joane Geneville, born in 1285, died in 1356, daughter of Peter de Geneville and his wife, Joane Lusignan. Peter was the son of Geoffrey de Geneville, Lord of Trim, in Ireland and conveyed eventually the whole inheritance of the Genevilles, and half the land of the Lacys, into that family. See Burke, pg. 228. Peter de Geneville, died in 1292, was the second son of Geoffrey de Geneville and his wife Maud Lacy, daughter of Walter Lacy, Lord of Meath. Geoffrey was the son of Peter de Geneville, a Provencal, who died in 1249, stated by Matthew of Paris, to have been a man of humble birth, and by others to have been Lord of Vancouleur, and brother of John de Geneville, or Joinville, the historian of the Crusade of St. Louis, who was Governor of Windsor Castle, and dying in 1249, was succeeded by his son and heir, Geoffrey, who in the 38th year of King Henry III., had livery of the castle of Trim, in Ireland. In four years afterwards he received a military summons to march against the Welsh, and in the 44th year of the same king, being then one of the barons marchers, he had command to repair to the castle of Wales, and to reside there. In the 10th year of King Edward I., he was in the expedition made against the Welsh, and in fifteen years subsequently he was in the wars of Gascony. For all which service he was summoned to parliament as a baron, February 6, 1299, and from that period to November 3, 1306. He married Maud, daughter and heir of Gilbert de Lacy (Lacey), son of Walter de Lacy (Lacey), Lord of Maeth. He died in 1307, succeeded by his son, Peter, whose older brother, Geoffrey d.s.p. in the lifetime of his father. In the 34th year of Edward I., he received the honor of knighthood, and the same year attended the king into Scotland, where we find him again in the 3rd year of Edward II., and the same year he was constituted Governor of the castle of Buelt, in Brecknockshire. In the 7th, 8th, and 9th years he was likewise in Scotland, and then appointed lord-lieutenant of Ireland. During the remainder of the unhappy Edward's reign he attached himself to the interests of the queen, and at length fled with her and Prince Edward into France. Returning, however, and his party triumphing, he was advanced to the dignity of Earl of March soon after the accession of King Edward III., and he held a round table the same year at Bedford. But hereupon becoming proud beyond measure (so that his own son, Geoffrey, called him the King of Folly), he kept a round table of knights in Wales, in imitation of King Arthur. \"Other particulars,\" says Dugdale, \"of his haughtiness and insolence were these, viz., that with Queen Isabel, he caused parliament to be held at Northampton, where an unworthy agreement was made with the Scots, and Ragman's Roll of Homage of Scotland was traitorously delivered as also the black cross, which King Edward I. brought into England, out of the abbey of Scone, and then accounted a precious relic. That (with the queen) he caused the young king to ride twenty-four miles in one night, towards Bedford, to destroy the Earl of Lancaster and his adherents, saying that they imagined the king's death. That he followed Queen Isabel to Nottingham, and lodged in one house with her. That he commanded the treasure of the realm, and assumed the authority, which by common consent in parliament was conferred upon Henry, Earl of Lancaster, at the king's coronation.\" His career was not however of long continuance, for, the king becoming sensible of his folly and vices, had him suddenly seized in the castle of Nottingham, and conveyed prisoner to London, where, being impeached before parliament, he was convicted under various charges, the first of which was privity to the murder of King Edward II. in Berkeley Castle; and receiving sentence of death was hanged in 1330, at the summons gallows, called Elmes, near Smithfield, where his body was permitted to hang for two days and three nights naked, before it was interred in the Grey Friars; whence in some years afterwards it was removed to Wigmore. The Earl of March left issue four sons and seven daughters as follows:\n\n1. Edmund Mortimer. See below.\n\n2. Roger Mortimer, married in 1321 Joane Butler.\n\n3. Geoffrey Mortimer, Lord of Towyth.\n\n4. John Mortimer, slain in a tournament at Shrewsbury.\n\n5. Katherine Mortimer, died 1371, married in 1337 Thomas de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, an original Knight of the Garter.\n\n6. Joane Mortimer, who died before 1351, married some years before June 13 1330, as his first wife, James Audley, Lord Audley, a descendant of Surety William Malet, born January 8, 1312/13, died April 1, 1386, son of Nicholas Audley, Lord Audley of Heleigh and his wife Joan Martin (her 2nd marriage). James Audley married (2) Isabel le Strange, said to be the daughter of Roger le Strange of Knockyn. Joane Mortimer and James Audley had one son and two daughters as follows:\n\n1. Nicholas Audley, Lord Audley, born about 1328, d.s.p., 1391.\n\n2. Joan Audley, married John Touchet of Markeaton, co. Derby, who was slain at Rochelle in 1371.\n\n3. Margaret (Margery) Audley, married Fulk FitzWarin, son of Fulk FitzWarin, Knight of the Garter, and his wife Joan Beaumont, daughter of Henry Beaumont and his wife Alice Comyn.\n\n7. Agnes Mortimer, married Laurence Hastings, Earl of Pembroke, died 1348, a descendant of Surety Roger Bigod.\n\n8. Margaret Mortimer, married (1) Robert de Vere, 6th Earl of Oxford, who died without issue; and (2) Thomas de Berkeley, Lord Berkeley, son and heir of Maurice de Berkeley, a descendant of the Surety, Saire de Quincy.\n\nSee the continuation of this lineage in the Berkeley Line of Volume II.\n\n9. Maud (Matilda) Mortimer, married John de Cherlton, son and heir of John, Lord Powys.\n\n10. Blanche Mortimer, married Peter de Grandison, died 1358, son of William de Garndison and his wife Sibilla Tregoz. They had no issue.\n\n11. Beatrix (Beatrice) Mortimer, married (1) Edward, son and heir of Thomas of Brotherton, Earl Marshal of England, and (2) Thomas de Braose, son of Peter de Braose (half brother of William de Braose, Lord Braose of Gower). The issue of none of their three sons survived. Their daughter Joane also died without issue. But their daughter Beatrice Braose, married William Saye, Lord Saye, and they had a daughter Elizabeth Saye, who married (1) John de Falvesley, who died without issue about 1392, and married (2) William Heron, Knight of Applynden, who died without issue in 1404.\n\nUpon the execution and attainder of the earl all the honors of Roger Mortimer became forfeited.\n\n9. Edmund Mortimer, the eldest son of Roger, born about 1305, although he did not succeed to the earldom, was summoned to parliament, as Lord Mortimer, November 20, 1331. He married June 27, 1316 Elizabeth Badlesmere, one of the daughters and at length co-heir of Bartholomew Badlesmere (commonly called the Rich), Lord Badlesmere, of Ledes Castle, in Kent, and his wife, Margaret Clare. She married, after his decease, William de Bohun, Earl of Northampton. She was aged 25 in 1338 and died June 8, 1355. See the continuation of this lineage in the Bohun Line in Volume II.\n\n========================================================\n\nThe following descent is not directly related, only half-relations.\n\nFrom the marriage of Mortimer and Elizabeth there was an only surviving son, Roger Mortimer, successor to Edmund at his death shortly before January 21, 1331.\n\n1. Roger Mortimer, born November 11, 1328, three years before his father's death, was summoned to parliament as Baron Mortimer, and Baron Mortimer, of Wigmore, from November 20, 1348, to March 15, 1354. He at the time of his father's death, was only three years old, and during his minority his castles in the marches of Wales were committed to the custody of William de Bohun, Earl of Northampton, who had married his mother, his step-father. In the 20th year of Edward III. he accompanied the king into France, and then received the honor of knighthood, one of the original Knights of the Garter. In the 26th year he was in a similar expedition, and in two years afterwards, obtaining a reversal of the attainder of his grandfather, he was restored to the Earldom of March, and to his forfeited lands. He was the next year the Constable of Dover Castle, and Warden of the Cinque Ports, and for some years afterwards he was in the wars of France. He married Philippa Montacute, daughter of William de Montacute, 1st Earl of Salisbury, and his wife, Katherine Grandison. Philippa died January 5, 1381/82. They had issue as follows:\n\n1. Roger Mortimer, who died in his father's lifetime in 1398, leaving by his wife Eleanor Holand a son, Edmund Mortimer.\n\n2. Edmund Mortimer, his successor. See below.\n\n3. Margery Mortimer, married John Audley, Lord Audley.\n\nHe died at Romera, in Burgundy, in 1359, being then commander of the English forces there, and a Knight of the Garter. He was succeeded by his son, Edmund.\n\n11. Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March and Lord Mortimer, known as \"The Good,\" was born February 1, 1352. While yet an infant, in 1354, he was betrothed to Alice Fitz Alan, daughter of Richard Fitz Alan, but did not marry her. At the time of his father's death, he was in minority, yet by reason of his singular knowledge and parts, he was employed at eighteen years of age, to treat with the commissioners of the King of France, touching a peace between both realms. In the 1st year of Richard II., he was sworn to the privy council, and in two years afterwards, constituted Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, in which government he died in 1381. He married in 1368 Philippa Plantaganet, only daughter and heir of Lionel Plantaganet of Antwerp, Duke of Clarence (by Elizabeth, his first wife, daughter and heir of William de Burgh, son and heir of John de Burgh, Earl of Ulster). Philippa was born at Eltham August 16, 1355 and died before her husband. He died December 27, 1381. They had the following children:\n\n1. Roger Mortimer, his successor. See below.\n\n2. Edmund Mortimer, married the daughter of Owen Glendour, and his issue is said to have settled in Scotland.\n\n3. John Mortimer, who, being arraigned in parliament, in the time of Henry VI., for treasonable speeches, was condemned and executed.\n\n4. Elizabeth Mortimer, married (1) Henry Percy, the celebrated \"Hotspur\", son of the Earl of Northumberland, a descendant of Surety John Fitz Robert; and (2) Thomas Camois (Camoys), Lord Camois, Knight of the Garter. She died April 20, 1417.\n\n5. Philippa Mortimer, born November 21, 1375, at Ludlow, died September 24, 1401, married (1) John Hastings, Earl of Pembroke, who died without issue; and in 1390 (2) Richard Fitz Alan, Earl of Arundel He had no issue by her); and after April 1398 (3) John Poynings, Lord St. John.\n\nHe died in 1381, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Roger.\n\n12. Roger Mortimer , 4th Earl of March, who being but seven years old, at the decease of his father, was committed in ward, by the king, to Richard, Earl of Arundel; and when he came of age, found, by the care of those who had the management of his estate, all his castles and houses in good repair, and amply stocked with rich furniture, while his lands were completely stocked with cattle, and in his treasury, no less than 40,000 marks. This Roger being a hopeful youth, and every way accomplished, was, soon after his father's death, made lieutenant of Ireland; and in parliament, held in the 9th year of Richard II., was declared, by reason of his descent from Lionel, Duke of Clarence, heir presumptive to the crown. He married Alianore Holland, daughter of Thomas Holland, Earl of Kent and his wife, Alice Fitz Alan, sister of Thomas Holland, Duke of Surrey, and sister and co-heir of Edmund, Earl of Kent. She married (2) Edward Powys, Lord Powys; and (3) John Dudley, Lord Dudley). They had the following children:\n\n1. Edmund Mortimer, his successor, 5th Earl of March, heir to the crown of England. This nobleman being but six years of age, at the decease of his father, was committed by King Henry IV., to Henry, Prince of Wales, his son; out of whose custody he was shortly after stolen away by the Lady de Spencer; but being discovered in Chittham Woods, they kept him afterwards, under stricter guard, for he was the rightful heir to the crown of England, by his descent from Lionel, Duke of Clarence. He was frequently engaged in the wars of France, in the time of King Henry V., and in the first year of King Henry VI. he was constituted Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. He married Anne, daughter of Edmund, Earl of Strafford, but d.s.p., in 1424, when the Earldom of March became extinct, but the Baronies of Mortimer, created by the writs of Edward I., and Edward III, devolved upon his nephew, Richard Plantaganet, Duke of York, son of his sister Anne, Countess of Cambridge; and upon the accession of the son and heir of the said Duke of York to the throne, as Edward IV., these baronies, with other dignities, became merged in the crown. Thus terminated the male line of the illustrious family of Mortimer, Earls of March; and their great estates, with the right to the throne, passed to Richard, Duke of York, son of the last earl's sister, the Lady Anne Mortimer, by her husband, Richard Plantaganet, Earl of Cambridge.\n\n2. Roger Mortimer, d.s.p.\n\n3. Anne Mortimer, married Richard Plantaganet, Earl of Cambridge, younger son of Edmund of Langley, Duke of York (5th son of King Edward III.), and conveyed the right to the crown to the House of York, through their son, Richard Plantaganet, Duke of York. He claimed the throne as a descendant of Lionel, second son of King Edward III, whereas King Henry VI., then on the throne, was from John of Gaunt, Edward's third son. This was the origin of the Wars of the Roses. The Duke's party was badly defeated in the battle of Wakefield in 1460, when he was slain. He married Cecily Nevill, daughter of Ralph de Nevill, Earl of Westmoreland and his wife, Joan Beaufort. Their eldest son was Edward, Duke of York, who ascended the throne as King Edward IV. Their fourth son, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, ascended the throne as King Richard III.\n\n4. Eleanor (Alianore) Mortimer, married Edward, son of Edward Courtenay, Earl of Devon, but d.s.p.\n\nRoger Mortimer was slain in battle, in Ireland, in 1398, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Edmund."
