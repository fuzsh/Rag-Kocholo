        "text": "Over the last couple of years, Anne O‚ÄôBrien has become my go-to-author when I want my historical fix, with her wonderfully researched novels told from the perspective of the powerful, often overlooked, women of history. Queen of the North is the fourth novel of Anne O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs I‚Äôve read, which was published just last year.\n\nIn Queen of the North, O‚ÄôBrien sweeps us back to the great upheaval of 1399 and introduces us to a little remembered key-player, Elizabeth Mortimer. Elizabeth was the wife of the tempestuous Henry ‚ÄòHotspur‚Äô Percy; great-granddaughter of Edward III; and cousin to both Richard II and Henry IV. With her royal blood and advantageous marriage, Elizabeth was a woman of power, wealth and influence, who played an almost forgotten, but key role in the ensuing turmoil for the throne. And the only literary reference to this is her, incorrect, portrayal as Lady Kate Percy in William Shakespeare‚Äôs Henry IV.\n\nIt was for this reason that O‚ÄôBrien was so keen to write Elizabeth‚Äôs story. O‚ÄôBrien portrays Elizabeth as a proud, clever and ambitious woman, who has a great love for her children and shares a passionate love with her first husband, Henry. When her cousin, Henry Bolingbroke landed in England, in 1399, with an army to bring their cousin Richard II to heel, he has the full support of Elizabeth‚Äôs powerful father-in-law, Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland and his eldest son, her husband. However Elizabeth very much has her own mind and that is if anyone else is to sit upon the throne, it should be her nephew, Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March.\n\nAnd for this belief she is willing to risk everything in dangerous scheming and eventually outright treason ‚Äì more than once! I didn‚Äôt particularly ‚Äòlike‚Äô Elizabeth, but I did find her fascinating and her story truly moved me. I was heartbroken with Elizabeth, as Henry is brutally slain at the disastrous Battle of Shrewsbury; as she rides under his severed head on the gates of York; as she begs for his despoiled body to be returned; as she is separated from her children; and as she forced into a second marriage. So much sorrow, so much suffering, and yet it is worse because I knew, as much as she does but doesn‚Äôt want to admit, that she brought a lot of it upon herself.\n\nPreviously, I have not read anything about Elizabeth, so this was as much a history lesson as it was an entertaining read. A history lesson that O‚ÄôBrien has again brought to life in glorious detail ‚Äì from the sumptuous dress and life of court, to the daily life of a medieval woman writing her letters, using her still room and hosting guests; to the bloody battlefield. Something else I love about her writing is how characters overlap in her books, which makes it possible for us as readers to see the bigger picture of the time period. In this case, Henry IV and Thomas de Camoys were both in previous novels, The King‚Äôs Sister and The Queen‚Äôs Choice.\n\nOverall, I thought Queen of the North was an evocative tragedy of love, loss, loyalty and betrayal, through the eyes of the fascinating Elizabeth Mortimer ‚Äì she certainly wasn‚Äôt your dull, dutiful wife! Tantalisingly, in this book, we also met Constance of York, Lady Despenser, who is the protagonist of O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs newest novel, A Tapestry of Treason; which I‚Äôm excited to read. Great read.\n\nThank you to the publishers for providing a copy of this book via NetGalley in exchange for my honest opinion.\n\nI‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts: Have you read this? Have you read any of Anne O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs other novels?"
