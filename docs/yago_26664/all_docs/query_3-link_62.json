        "text": "Brad Verity\n\nunread,\n\nto\n\nI decided that before tackling the royal ancestry of Jack Brooksbank, and all the detailed lines posted by Gawain and others some months back, I needed to at least have his mother-in-law and her ancestry in my database.\n\nI’ve finally completed entering all of the Duchess of York’s lines back to Edward I (at least all the ones that I could uncover). The end result is that I do have some lines that aren’t yet in the Genealogics and Roglo databases, and I’ll post them here to SocGenMed, for completion’s sake, if nothing else. I realize this overlaps with research into Sarah Ferguson’s ancestry undertaken and shared by Will Johnson, John Higgins and others over the years. I’ve tried to go back in the archives and re-read the past threads on Sarah’s ancestry, but I may well have missed some. If I post a line that was already covered previously, my apologies.\n\nI’m fascinated by mtDNA lines, and what immediately struck me with the Duchess of York’s ancestry is that she is a direct mtDNA descendant of Lady Anne Clifford, Countess of Dorset and (later) of Pembroke (1590-1676), who was a genealogist herself in her own time, and whose research into her Clifford ancestors I’ve previously studied. Of course this mtDNA line continues into the next generation with Sarah’s daughters Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, as well as their first cousins, Ayesha (Makim) Specker and Heidi Luedecke. In my database, I’ve traced Sarah’s mtDNA line back 18 generations to Elizabeth Howard, wife of Henry Wentworth of Codham Hall (d. 1483). As neither Elizabeth nor her husband descend from Edward I, I haven’t traced the line back any further, but Genealogics (thanks to Gerald Paget’s The Lineage and Ancestry of H.R.H. Prince Charles) has it back a further two generations, to Margery, wife of Sir Henry Hussey.\n\nhttp://www.genealogics.org/getperson.php?personID=I00076296&tree=LEO\n\nHas anyone been able to trace it even further back? It’s noteworthy that the Duchess of York’s mtDNA line can be traced back to the 14th-century, especially when compared to her royal ex-husband Prince Andrew, whose mtDNA line is traced (at least in Genealogics) only 8 generations back, to the 18th-century Ann Newland, wife of Edward Garritt.\n\nhttp://www.genealogics.org/getperson.php?personID=I00219247&tree=LEO\n\nTurning to the Duchess of York’s paternal line, what’s interesting is how it really didn’t achieve gentry status until the end of the 19th-century. According to the ‘Ferguson of Dummer’ article in BLG (1972), the family seems to have originated in Ireland, in counties Down and Antrim, and can be traced back seven generations from Sarah, to the latter 18th-century. A 3xgreat-uncle, barrister-at-law Thomas Benyon Ferguson (1836-1874), was the first to marry into the Edward I bloodline, in 1869, followed by his widowed sister-in-law, Sophia (Holford) Ferguson, who took as her second husband, Sir Astley Paston Paston-Cooper, 3rd Baronet, in 1890. Genealogics (thanks to Debrett’s Book of the Royal Engagement (1986)) has much of the Ferguson/Holford ancestry. If anyone has done further research into it, and come across any lines back to the Plantagenets, I’d be interested in hearing about it.\n\nhttp://www.genealogics.org/pedigree.php?personID=I00005778&tree=LEO&parentset=0&display=standard&generations=7\n\nMaj. Victor Ferguson, Lady Paston-Cooper’s eldest son, purchased Polebrook Hall in Northamptonshire in 1885. When he was killed on the Second Ashanti Expedition in January 1896, it was inherited by his next brother, Capt. Algernon Ferguson, one of the three aide-de-camps to the recently appointed governor of New South Wales, Viscount Hampden. A year later, in January 1897, the engagement of Capt. Ferguson to Viscount Hampden’s eldest daughter, Hon. Margaret Brand, was announced. It clearly was a love match, and the April 1897 wedding in Sydney’s St Andrew Cathedral was given royal wedding status by Australian society and press, including a 5-page illustrated spread in The Sydney Mail and New South Wales Advertiser:\n\nhttps://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/163793603?searchTerm=Algernon%20Ferguson&searchLimits=\n\nHon. Margaret (Brand) Ferguson had an extensive royal ancestry, including a line of descent from Charles II thru his illegitimate daughter Anne (Palmer), Countess of Sussex. One of Hon. Margaret’s paternal ancestors is Katherine (Cornwallis) Knollys, in Genealogics here, with only a father given:\n\nhttp://www.genealogics.org/getperson.php?personID=I00123702&tree=LEO\n\nKATHERINE CORNWALLIS, bapt. 28 July 1591 St Stephen Walbrook, London; d.

Margaret (Brand) Ferguson, paternal great-grandmother of Sarah, Duchess of York.\n\nSir Richard’s Wikipedia entry identifies his wife as Lucy, daughter of the Duke of Montagu, citing Debrett’s Peerage as its source.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Pyne\n\nThe Roglo database further identifies her as Lucy, daughter of Ralph, 1st Duke of Montagu, with an unknown mother.\n\nhttp://roglo.eu/roglo?lang=en;i=344379\n\nIt’s possible the error originated because the mother-in-law of Henry Pyne, Sir Richard’s son and heir, was Lady Anne (Montagu) Edgcumbe, daughter of the 1st Earl of Sandwich. At any rate, the only daughter of Ralph, 1st Duke of Montagu, was Lady Anne Montagu (1674-1742), wife first of Alexander Popham, then of Lt-Gen. Daniel Harvey.\n\nThe 1705 marriage licence of Sir Richard’s son Henry Pyne proves that his mother’s first name was ‘Catherine’ not ‘Lucy’.\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/allegationsforma26byuches/page/334\n\nThe Genealogics database has her correctly identified as Catherine Wandesford, but with no parentage.\n\nhttp://www.genealogics.org/getperson.php?personID=I00658115&tree=LEO\n\nKATHERINE WANDESFORD, b.

Morris in ‘The Irish Genealogist Vol. 6 (1985), is the best place to start. I’ve not yet seen the article.\n\nDame Katherine Pyne was the daughter of Sir Christopher Wandesford, 1st Baronet of Kirklington and Eleanor Lowther, both of whom descend from Edward III. Sir Christopher’s one line is given below, but as the Lowthers are a well-covered family, I’ll only lay out one line for Eleanor, her mtDNA one to the point where it intersects with the Edward III bloodline.\n\nEdward III had\n\nA1) John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster (1340-1399), who had\n\nA2) Lady Joan Beaufort (1377-1440) m. 1) Sir Robert Ferrers of Wem (c.1372-1396), and had\n\nA3) Elizabeth Ferrers (1393-1434) m.

The marriage of one of them, Capt. (later Brig-Gen.) Algernon Ferguson, to the Hon. Margaret Brand, has already been discussed. The other great-grandparent without any royal ancestry was the Lady Herbert Scott.\n\nMarie Edwards was the youngest daughter of an Essex customs clerk of Irish heritage, and his Irish-born wife. But when the engagement and marriage notices hit the newspapers in 1905, the focus was on the fact that she was the niece of George Edwardes, the theatrical impresario who managed the Gaiety Theatre in London’s West End (he has an entry in ODNB).\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Edwardes\n\nA society columnist in The Tatler summed it up best: “The engagement of Lord Herbert Scott was quite a brief one, and the marriage—coming so soon after the first announcement—found some people still asking, ‘Who is she?’ The new Lady Herbert Scott, who was Miss Marie Edwardes, is a niece of Mr. George Edwardes and is a very smart, pretty-looking, fair girl, not above the middle height. They first met in Malta about a year ago, when Lord Herbert was on duty out there on the staff of the Governor, Sir Charles Mansfield Clarke, so the whole affair is quite romantic. As Lord Herbert is the favourite son of the duchess [of Buccleuch] there was quite a splash made at Montagu House over the wedding, her grace and the family coming to London specially for the event…Lord Herbert Scott has always had a hankering after the stage, and his great ambition has been to produce something which would take the town by storm…He has written several pieces for private theatricals at Dalkeith which were considered rather smart, and I believe other productions of his have been staged at regimental fêtes.”\n\nThe one photo that I could find of Marie, in the year she became Lady Herbert Scott, proves that she was indeed short in stature as the columnist alluded, and also stunningly beautiful. And though his marriage never led Lord Herbert Scott to a theatrical career—two years later in 1907, he resigned from the army and joined the board of Rolls Royce, eventually becoming chairman in 1936 until his death in 1944—it was a great success. The Duchess of York’s father, Maj. Ronald Ferguson, in his 1994 autobiography The Galloping Major, recalls his Scott grandparents as being much fun and describes several warm memories of them.\n\nLord Herbert Scott of course was a direct y-DNA descendant of Charles II. Indeed, the Duke of Buccleuch is the senior representative of James, Duke of Monmouth, the ill-fated firstborn of Charles II’s several illegitimate sons, and per Major Ferguson’s autobiography, the Buccleuches consider their ancestry to be superior to that of the House of Windsor. Be that as it may, the lineage of the Montagu-Douglas-Scotts is a well-travelled road in the peerage works, and I personally have nothing to add to the extensive account of it provided in the Genealogics database:\n\nhttp://www.genealogics.org/pedigree.php?personID=I00005594&tree=LEO&parentset=0&display=standard&generations=7\n\nTurning to the maternal ancestry of the Duchess of York, all four of her great-grandparents on that side have lines of descent from Edward I and later British monarchs. The Wrights originated as a dynasty of Nottingham bankers in the 18th-century, their first intersection with the Edward I bloodline occurring at the close of that century, in the marriage of John Wright to Elizabeth Beresford.\n\nELIZABETH BERESFORD, bap. 22 Sept. 1762 St Mary Church, Nottingham; d. 18 Dec. 1833 Lenton Hall, Nottinghamshire, bur. 24 Dec. 1833 Holy Trinity Church, Lenton; m. 26 Apr. 1791 St Oswald Church, Ashbourne, Derbyshire, JOHN WRIGHT of Lenton Hall, banker, b. 7 Aug. 1758 Nottingham, bap. 29 Aug. 1758 Castle Gate Meeting House (Independent), Nottingham; d. 21 Apr. 1840 Lenton Firs Lodge, bur. 28 Apr. 1840 Holy Trinity Church, Lenton, son of John Wright of Nottingham, banker (1723-1789) & Ann Sherbrooke (1721-1792).\n\nElizabeth (Beresford) Wright was the daughter of Francis Beresford of Ashbourne, barrister-at-law, and Fanny Reynolds, both of whom have lines back to Edward I. The Genealogics and Roglo databases don’t yet show any of these lines.

Benjamin Reynolds, appears on p. 92 of Ruvigny’s 1911 Mortimer-Percy volume, with no indication of his marriage, or of his daughter Fanny (Reynolds) Beresford. Rev. Benjamin was the eldest of six children, and none of his five younger siblings—Elizabeth (1705-1706); Frances (1707-1775), wife of Thomas Deverell of Swanbourne; John Reynolds of Hoggeston (1709-1789); Barbara (1711-aft.1780), wife of John Anstee of Swanbourne; Anna Maria (1714-1779), second wife of Rev.

In a 1780 codicil to his will (proved 10 July 1789, accessed thru the P.C.C. database on Ancestry), John Reynolds of Hoggeston makes a bequest to his sister-in-law Frances Reynolds, and appoints his niece Fanny Beresford his executor. The Hoggeston burial register for the latter half of the 18th-century hasn’t yet made it into online databases, so I’ve been unable to locate burial entries for Rev. Benjamin Reynolds, his wife Frances, or his brother John Reynolds. Nor have I located a marriage entry for Rev. Benjamin Reynolds and his wife Frances. One WikiTree database states that Webster was the maiden name of Rev. Benjamin Reynold’s wife. One of the sources it lists (along with Ruvigny and Oxford University Alumni, neither of which identify Rev. Benjamin’s wife) is “Beresford family tree in family possession.” At this point, that’s the closest we can get to her identification.\n\nhttps://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Reynolds-8142\n\nFollowing is the Edward III descent for Elizabeth (Beresford) Wright, as given in Ruvigny, with additional details added.\n\nEdward III had a 2nd surviving son:\n\n1) Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence (1338-1368), who had\n\n2) Philippa Plantagenet, 5th Countess of Ulster (1355-1377) m.

Morris notes that Richard mentions Sir George in his will. I found Sir Richard's PCC will in Ancestry (PROB 11/513). He left £20 to his \"Brother Sir George Norton of Abbotsly in the Count of Somersett Knight.”\n\nI only had two children in my database for Sir George Norton & Ellen Owen: a son Edward Norton (born 1654, died Dec. 1702), and a daughter Ellen (born c.1648; bur. 16 Aug. 1710 St Nicholas Church, North Bradley, Wiltshire).

On the same page is the M.I. for his mother Frances (Gataker) Reynolds, which provides her exact date of death, 13 June 1715.\n\nI completely overlooked the burial entry for Benjamin Reynolds in FindmyPast. I searched 'Benjamin Reynolds', year of death '1781 +/- 1 year'. I see now I should have kept scrolling - on p. 16(!!) 'Revd Benjamin Reynolds 1781 Buckinghamshire Burial Index Hoggeston' is listed. So glad you gave the index a more thorough search.\n\n> I couldn't find a burial entry for his brother John but only one burial is recorded for 1788, likewise for 1789, so perhaps the transcriptions aren't complete.\n\nEither that, or John may have died earlier than 1789, when his will was proved. The second and final codicil to his will was dated 10 July 1782. I don't have time at the moment to search burial indexes for all the John Reynolds who died in 1782-89, but hope to have the time to do so soon.\n\nThe other Reynolds sibling I was unable to find a burial entry for was Barbara Anstee. Her brother John Reynolds in his July 1782 codicil enjoins his niece and executrix Fanny Beresford \"give to my sister Anstee five guineas to buy her [unintelligible].\" At that point, Barbara and John were the only two of the Reynolds siblings still living.\n\n> No burial entry in Hoggeston for Benjamin's widow Frances either. Their daughter Fanny Beresford lived at Fenny Bentley, in Derbyshire (you've noted her burial there in 1815) and presumably Frances joined her there following Benjamin's death. She was likely the Frances Reynolds, aged 84, of the parish of Ashbourne, who was buried at Fenny Bentley on May 28, 1784. See digital images of the Fenny Bentley PR in Ancestry (\"Derbyshire, England, Church of England Baptisms, Marriages and Burials, 1538-1812\").\n\nGREAT find!! Yes, I agree that is indeed the burial entry for Frances, widow of Rev. Benjamin Reynolds. It's nice to have her age at death. It also explains why there's no mention of her in Rev. Benjamin's M.I. at Hoggeston - she was buried elsewhere.\n\n> I searched unsuccessfully for a Benjamin Reynolds and wife Frances marriage record in Findmypast, Ancestry, and FamilySearch.\n\nIf Frances's age at death was accurate, she was about four years older than her reverend husband. She remains a brick wall for the moment in the ancestry of the Duchess of York, but as more and more parish registers are acquired and indexed by online genealogy databases, we will hopefully get a breakthrough.\n\nThank you for your help with this, Gawin.\n\nCheers, -----Brad\n\nOn Saturday, April 27, 2019 at 1:40:06 PM UTC-7, Brad Verity wrote:\n\n> Sarah (Beresford) Wright’s maternal grandfather, Rev.

Selina and her husband were second cousins—Selina’s mother Dame Agnes FitzHerbert was the daughter of Rev. William Beresford, Rector of Sonning, uncle of Elizabeth (Beresford) Wright, the mother of Selina’s husband Francis Wright. The ten lines from Edward I to Francis Beresford of Ashbourne, barrister, which were set out in a previous post in this thread, thus also apply to Francis’s younger brother Rev. William Beresford, Selina’s maternal grandfather.\n\nSelina’s maternal grandmother, Martha Maria (Bland) Beresford, is another brick wall in the ancestry of the Duchess of York. She is in the Genealogics database, with no dates or parents.\n\nhttp://www.genealogics.org/getperson.php?personID=I00117020&tree=LEO\n\nI can at least add her dates, and the names of her parents.\n\nMARTHA MARIA BLAND, bap. 24 Nov. 1774 St Peter Church, Nottingham; bur. 12 July 1833 All Saints Church, West Farleigh, Kent; m. 18 Aug. 1778 St Mary Church, Arnold, Nottinghamshire, Rev. WILLIAM BERESFORD, Vicar of Sonning, Berkshire 1781-84 (bap. 2 Jan. 1740 St Oswald Church, Ashbourne, Derbyshire; d. 1 June 1784 Sonning, bur. 14 June 1784 St Andrew Church, Sonning), son of John Beresford of Fenny Bentley (c.1688-1755, descended from Edward I) & Frances Fitzherbert (c.1693-1765, descended from Edward I).\n\nPer her baptism entry indexed in Ancestry, ‘Martha Maria Bland or Thornton’ was the daughter of ‘Joseph Bland’ and ‘Mary Thornton.’ The original parish register hasn’t been digitized, so I’ve not viewed the original baptism entry, but if she does indeed appear in it under the surname ‘Bland or Thornton’, it stands to reason that she was illegitimate. [It should be noted that in FindMyPast, the Nottinghamshire Baptisms Index 1538-1917 has her indexed simply as ‘Martha Bland’ daughter of ‘Joseph Bland’ and ‘Mary.’ But the England Births & Baptisms 1538-1975 index has ‘Martha Maria Bland Or Thornton’ with her parents as ‘Joseph Bland’ and ‘Mary Thornton.’] If Martha Maria was illegitimate, it would explain why no marriage entry for Joseph Bland to Mary Thornton can be found, even though the Nottingham parish registers seem to be covered thoroughly online for this period. I’m unable to further identify either of Martha Maria’s parents, but perhaps others will have better success.\n\nSo much for Selina (FitzHerbert) Wright’s maternal ancestry. In 2008, Will Johnson made some posts regarding ancestors in Selina’s paternal line, specifically on Littleton Poyntz Meynell of Bradley Hall:\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/d/msg/soc.genealogy.medieval/lWSd4Lt4oGI/UEzGUB8_U6MJ\n\nThrough this ancestor, Selina Wright has a descent from Henry IV, and another from Edward III.

His son Edmund was twelve years old in 1598.\"\n\nhttps://archive.org/stream/descriptionofire00hogauoft#page/180/mode/2up\n\nSo Honora's eldest son Edmund FitzJohn was born about 1586. Her first husband was killed a traitor in January 1589, which means her second son Richard FitzJohn was born 1587-89. She also had two daughters with her first husband, at least one of whom must have been born before the sons. So a birthdate estimate for Honora of about 1565 would work. She was likely a bit older than her second husband Edmund FitzJohn FitzGerald of Cloyne, whose M.I. in Cloyne Cathedral says he was age 43 at his death on 10 March 1612/3, so born about 1569.\n\nIt's helpful to further establish Honora's chronology.\n\nOn Sunday, May 5, 2019 at 4:44:35 PM UTC-7, John Higgins wrote:\n\n> Sarah Ferguson's ancestor Sir Richard Pyne, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, has 3 descents from Edward I.

When entering the missing Generation 10 into my database this morning, I came across some info which may be useful, and can be added to the account in Genealogics.\n\nhttp://www.genealogics.org/getperson.php?personID=I00692743&tree=LEO\n\n1) The first name of Sir Godfrey and Dame Katherine (Leke) Foljambe's daughter was definitely 'Benedicta' (or the more anglicized 'Benett'), not 'Jane'. She was born at the family seat Walton Hall, Chesterfield, Derbyshire, on the feast of the translation of St Edward [13 October] 1499, and named for her paternal grandmother Benedicta (Vernon) Foljambe, who stood as godmother, alongside her maternal aunt Muriel (Leke) Waterton.\n\nhttps://books.google.ca/books?id=ceFgAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA70&dq=sir+john+dunham+of+kirklington&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjhzoTP34fiAhWKIDQIHcthC2MQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&q=sir%20john%20dunham%20of%20kirklington&f=false\n\n2) She was contracted to marry Sir John Dunham on 4 August 13 Henry VIII [1521].\n\nhttps://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/eea5dd26-ffef-4570-8fbf-9b6f54c4e1c9\n\n3) Her second husband was Sir William Newenham of Everdon, Northamptonshire (he has an entry in HOP).\n\nhttps://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C7485957\n\nhttp://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/member/newenham-william-1502-46\n\n4) Per Robert Thoroton, in his 'History of Nottinghamshire' (1798), Benett Foljambe's first husband Sir John Dunham was returned as \"about 28 years of age\" at the IPM of his mother, Elizabeth (Bowett) (Chaworth) Dunham, taken in \"18 H. 7\" [1502/03], so born about 1474. \"He died 9 Sept. 30 H. 8 [1538] and by his first wife Jane, daughter of Thomas Thurland of Gameleston, had a son, who died young, and four daughters who became his heirs: his second wife was Bennett, the daughter of Sir Godfr. Folejambe.\"\n\nhttps://books.google.ca/books?id=l-icpHJW2OQC&pg=PA98&dq=sir+john+dunham+of+kirklington&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwijpNew44fiAhUtHjQIHRnGA18Q6AEIRjAG#v=onepage&q=sir%20john%20dunham%20of%20kirklington&f=false\n\nSee also Thoroton's pedigree of Dunham on the previous page:\n\nhttps://books.google.ca/books?id=l-icpHJW2OQC&pg=PA98&dq=sir+john+dunham+of+kirklington&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwijpNew44fiAhUtHjQIHRnGA18Q6AEIRjAG#v=onepage&q=sir%20john%20dunham%20of%20kirklington&f=false\n\n5) Thoroton was correct on the birthdate of Sir John Dunham. Per his mother's Yorkshire IPM, taken 4 November 1502, \"John Dunham, knight, is her son and heir, aged 28 and more.\"\n\nhttp://www.archive.org/stream/calendarofinquis02grea#page/368/mode/2up\n\n6) Thoroton was incorrect on the death date of Sir John Dunham. Per the HOP entry for Sir William Newenham, Dunham died in 1535, not 1538. I'm always pleased to be able to cite the thorough research of my friend Paul Reed. In a post to this newsgroup back in 1998, refers to the IPM for Sir John Dunham, taken in 26 Henry VIII (1535).\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/d/msg/soc.genealogy.medieval/9njNYuYgXoU/OhPxER0G8x8J\n\n7) Kate Emerson, in her entry for Benett Foljambe on the 'A Who's Who of Tudor Women' website, states that Benett was married to second husband Sir William Newenham by 20 November 1536, when her marriage jointure was assigned (but no source cited, or link provided for that specific date). So Sir John Dunham of Kirklington probably died 9 September 1535. Kate Emerson follows Thoroton, and states that Benett did not have any children with her first husband Sir John Dunham.\n\nhttp://www.tudorwomen.com/?page_id=675\n\n8) But Thoroton was also incorrect in making Sir John's five children by his first wife Jane Thurland. They most definitely were by his second wife, Benett Foljambe, as proven by Sir John himself, in the pedigree he supplied herald Thomas Tonge in 1530: \"And the said Sir John maried to his second wife Bennet, doughter to Sir Godfrey Folgeam of Derbyshire: and by her had issue, John, which dyed yonge; and Kateryn; Elizabeth; Margaret; Anne; and Mary.\"\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/heraldicvisitati00tongrich/page/n21\n\n9) Paul Reed states the ages of Sir John Dunham's daughters from his IPM were, \"his daughter Katherine was aged 10 (b. 1525), Ann was aged 6 (b. 1529), Mary was aged 3 (b. 1532), and Francis was aged 7 [b. 1528].\" This can't be correct, as we know Mary was born by 1530, when Thomas Tonge made his visitation pedigree, and Frances was the youngest daughter, not yet born at the visitation. In a subsequent post, Paul quotes 'Abstracts of the Inquisitions Post Mortem relating to Nottinghamshire, vol. I. Henry VII and Henry VIII 1485 to 1546' [1905 (Thoroton Society, Record Series 3), p. 247], the inquisition post mortem of Edmond Hunt, taken 23 March 1538/9, found that the manor of Normanton \"was held of Katherine, Anne, Maria and Francis [sic] Dunham, daughters and heirs of Sir John Dunham, knight, deceased, as of his manor of Kyrtlyngton, which now is in the King's hand by reason of the minority of the daughters.\" This matches to the birth order of the daughters stated by Tonge in 1530. So my guess is that somehow the ages of the daughters got confused in their father's 1535 IPM (the original should be checked - it may be the abstract that erred), and they in actuality were: Katherine aged 10 (b. 1525), Anne aged 7 (b. 1528), Mary aged 6 (b. 1529), and Frances aged 3 (b. 1532).\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/d/msg/soc.genealogy.medieval/9njNYuYgXoU/P1CO8-rVNW8J\n\n10) The HOP entry for Sir William Newenham states that he probably had two daughters with his second wife, Dame Benett (Foljambe) Dunham. Another IPM referred to by Robert Thoroton seems to identify those daughters. \"William Newenham, gent. dyed 2 July, 3 Eliz. [1561] x. leaving Isabell and Benedict his sisters and heirs. In 4 Eliz. [1561/2] Benedict was seventeen years old [so born c.1544], and married to Lancelot Mounteforth; Isabell nineteen [so born c.1542], and afterwards married to Edward Samon.\"\n\nhttps://books.google.ca/books?id=BHxbAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA46&dq=Lancelot+Mounteforth&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiuuceByYfiAhX_IDQIHahJByEQ6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&q=Lancelot%20Mounteforth&f=false\n\n11) Finally, I couldn't find a death or burial date for Dame Benett (Foljambe) (Dunham) Newenham, but she certainly survived her second husband, and was living as late as 1556. In the British Chancery Records, 1386-1558 database, accessed thru Ancestry.com, are entries for \"Benett Newenham\", Warwick, 1556-1558 (Vol. 10, Page 213, Bundle 1457), and \"Benedict Newenham\", Nottingham, 1556-1558 (Vol. 10, Page 212, Bundle 1456), which are no doubt referring to her.\n\nThanks & Cheers, ------Brad\n\nBrad Verity\n\nunread,\n\nto\n\nOn Monday, April 29, 2019 at 3:32:33 PM UTC-7, Brad Verity wrote:\n\n> More to follow.\n\nHaving added all I could to the Edward I lines behind Henry FitzHerbert Wright, maternal great-grandfather of Sarah, Duchess of York, it’s time to turn to his Canadian-born wife Muriel (Fletcher) Wright.\n\nHer father, Col. Henry Fletcher, whom Muriel would barely have known as he died when she was six, has an entry in the ‘Dictionary of Canadian Biography.’ He first travelled to Canada with his regiment in 1861, and was present, as an observer, at the American Civil War battles of Williamsburg, Fair Oaks, and the Seven Days. His reports back to his commanding officer, led to Fletcher eventually writing and publishing a three-volume ‘History of the American War.’\n\nhttp://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/fletcher_henry_charles_10E.html\n\nThe Fletchers of Kenward House (in the parish of Yalding, Kent) were a junior branch of the Fletchers of Clea Hall in Cumberland, which in turn were descended from a younger brother of the first Fletcher baronet of Hutton le Forest. The Kenward House Fletchers were unable to maintain their landed gentry status into the twentieth century. Kenward House was sold in 1901, and their final appearance in ‘Burke’s Landed Gentry’ was in the 1914 edition, which isn’t online. The 1898 edition is available however, though its account of the family wasn’t up-to-date: Muriel’s 1894 marriage to Henry FitzHerbert Wright isn’t mentioned.\n\nhttps://books.google.ca/books?id=YUtNAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA525&lpg=PA525&dq=fletcher+of+kenward&source=bl&ots=cT-b5CLz7c&sig=ACfU3U3wriRFFJRqYY7jFGj_HPG2KUYiUQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjx-IiP9IniAhUXFjQIHTOHC9AQ6AEwBHoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=fletcher%20of%20kenward&f=false\n\nThe Genealogics database, thanks to Debrett’s Book of the Royal Engagement (1986), traces Muriel’s paternal line back several generations, though not quite as far back as Sir Richard Fletcher of Hutton le Forest’s younger brother (use the Aubrey-Fletcher article in ‘Burke’s Peerage’ to make that connection).\n\nhttp://www.genealogics.org/pedigree.php?personID=I00005890&tree=LEO&parentset=0&display=standard&generations=6\n\nIn my database, I only take it as far back as Muriel’s paternal grandfather Maj-Gen. Edward Fletcher because, somewhat surprisingly for a gentry family that can be traced back to the 16th-century, he seems to have been the first to marry into the Edward I bloodline. It is through Edward’s first wife, Hon. Ellen Mary (Shore) Fletcher, a daughter of the 1st Baron Teignmouth, that Muriel’s father derives his Edward I descents. Edward Fletcher was born in Calcutta, the son of a civil servant with the East India Company, so it’s not surprising that he became part of the orbit of Lord Teignmouth, who began his own remarkable career (see his entry in ODNB) as a writer for the East India Company, and was given the hand of Teignmouth’s daughter. Yet it’s not through Teignmouth himself that we can trace back to Edward I, but rather his wife. With Charlotte (Cornish), Lady Teignmouth, the ancestry of Sarah, Duchess of York, overlaps with that of her son-in-law Jack Brooksbank. For Lady Teignmouth was the only sister of Dr. Philip Cornish of Exeter, an ancestor of Jack’s mother Nicola (Newton) Brooksbank. These lines were presented and discussed by John Higgins, Gawin Scott, and myself some months back in the Jack Brooksbank thread – the key posts being:\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/d/msg/soc.genealogy.medieval/2Bqrww_7DY8/RNXSxPvUAQAJ\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/d/msg/soc.genealogy.medieval/2Bqrww_7DY8/zmq3sMg7AQAJ\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/d/msg/soc.genealogy.medieval/2Bqrww_7DY8/vU56JN16AQAJ\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/d/msg/soc.genealogy.medieval/2Bqrww_7DY8/fOdvpv59AQAJ\n\nCapt. Edward Fletcher’s mother-in-law Lady Teignmouth died in July 1834 at his residence in Regents Park. The following month he was made an aide-de-camp to Rowland, 1st Viscount Hill, commander-in-chief of the British Army, whose nephew and heir apparent was Lady Teignmouth’s great-nephew. The untimely death from childbirth of Capt. Fletcher’s wife in January 1835, left him a 34-year-old widower with two infant sons. His portrait shows him to have been a good-looking redheaded officer, and his position as aide-de-camp to Lord Hill would place him within the orbit of high society – a combination that no doubt led to his brilliant second marriage. At the end of May 1838, Capt. Fletcher accompanied Viscount Hill to an inspection of the garrison at Dover Castle. Whether it was this sojourn into Kent that first brought him into the circle of the Earl of Romney I can’t determine, but at the end of July Captain Fletcher’s engagement to Lady Frances Marsham, the elder of Romney’s remaining two unmarried daughters, was announced.\n\nhttps://en.wahooart.com/@@/9DH5QQ-George-Richmond-Portrait-Of-Edward-Charles-Fletcher\n\nIf the Marshams were not blessed with a large fortune (per the HOP entry for the 2nd Earl of Romney, when the 1st Earl died in 1811, he was said to be ‘very poor’ and to have been ‘forced to retire altogether from public life with a very insufficient income for his rank’), they could make up for it with a distinguished lineage, with Henry VII, the Dukes of Somerset, the Earls of Northumberland, Thomas Cromwell, and Sir Thomas Wyatt amongst their ancestors. Edward Fletcher’s two young sons from his first marriage grew up within the Marsham family circle of their stepmother, and when Henry Fletcher returned to England after his observations of the American Civil War, he took for his bride his stepmother’s niece, Lady Harriet Marsham.\n\nhttp://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1790-1820/member/marsham-hon-charles-1777-1845\n\nAfter Muriel Fletcher lost her father at age six and her mother at age fourteen, it was her step-grandmother, the matriarch Lady Frances (Marsham) Fletcher of Kenwood House, who became the chief influence in the lives of Muriel and her siblings. The write-up in the newspaper about Muriel’s 1894 marriage to Henry FitzHerbert Wright demonstrates just how important the Marsham family was to her: Muriel’s uncle Hon. & Rev. John Marsham performed her wedding ceremony, and her maiden aunts Lady Mary and Lady Anne Marsham hosted the reception afterwards.\n\nThe Genealogics database already has much of Muriel’s ancestry. But there are some lines that I can take further back to Edward I. First up is a correction. Genealogics has Thomas Bosville of Little Mote (in the parish of Eynsford, Kent), ancestor of Muriel (Fletcher) Wright, as the son of Sir Ralph Bosville and Mary Lennard, with Mary’s ancestry tracing back to Edward III.\n\nhttp://www.genealogics.org/getperson.php?personID=I00052145&tree=LEO\n\nIt cites as one of its sources, ‘An Account of the Families of Lennard and Barrett’ (1908), which does indeed show this marriage.\n\nhttp://www.archive.org/stream/accountoffamilie02barr#page/216/mode/2up\n\nThere are no dates or ancestry for Sir Ralph Bosville. I can fill in some details. He has three lines of descent from Edward I. I’ll lay out one of them.\n\nSir RALPH BOSVILLE of Bradbourne House, Sevenoaks, Kent, bap. 26 June 1575 St Nicholas Church, Sevenoaks; bur. there 22 Jan. 1635/6; m. 2 Apr. 1594 St Nicholas Church, Sevenoaks, MARY LENNARD (bap. 22 Oct. 1574 St Botolph Church, Chevening, Kent; d. unknown), 2nd dau of Sampson Lennard of Chevening House (1544-1615) & Margaret Fiennes, 11th Baroness Dacre (1541-1612), descended from Edward III), and had issue, one son and one dau.\n\nPortrait of Sir Ralph Bosville:\n\nhttps://artuk.org/discover/artworks/sir-ralph-bosville-of-bradbourne-219019\n\nEdward I had a dau\n\nA1) Joan of Acre, Countess of Gloucester (1272-1307), who had\n\nA2) Lady Margaret de Clare (1293-1342), who had\n\nA3) Lady Margaret Audley (c.1321-1349) m. Ralph, 1st Earl of Stafford, and had\n\nA4) Hugh, 2nd Earl of Stafford (1341-1386) m. Lady Philippa Beauchamp (c.1340-bef.1385), and had\n\nA5) Lady Katherine Stafford (c.1371-1419) m. Michael de la Pole, 2nd Earl of Suffolk (1367-1415), and had\n\nA6) Lady Isabel de la Pole (c.1397-1467) m. Thomas, 5th Lord Morley (1393-1435), and had\n\nA7) Anne Morley (c.1420-1471) m. John Hastings of Gressenhall (1412-1477, descended from Edward I), and had\n\nA8) Elizabeth Hastings m. Sir Robert Hildyard of Winestead Hall (d. 1501), and had\n\nA9) Denise Hildyard m. Charles Barnby of Barnby Hall, and had\n\nA10) Muriel Barnby m. John Bosville of Gunthwaite Hall (d. 1542), and had\n\nA11) Sir Ralph Bosville of Bradbourne House (c.1522-1580) m. 1) Anne Clement, and had two sons A12 & B12 (see below)\n\nA12) Henry Bosville of Bradbourne House (d. 1592) m. Elizabeth Morgan, and had\n\nA13) Sir Ralph Bosville of Bradbourne House (1575-1636) m. Mary Lennard\n\nBut the problem is Sir Ralph Bosville and Mary Lennard did not have a son Thomas Bosville of Little Mote. The Bosville pedigree in the 1619-21 Visitation of Kent shows that their son and heir was Lennard Bosville (1598-1640).\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/visitationofkent00camd/page/170\n\nPer a website on the history of Bradbourne, when Lennard Bosville died in February 1639/40, his heir was his sister, “Sir Ralph’s daughter Margaret and her husband Sir William Boswell…Margaret had come into possession of [Bradbourne] because her brother, Lennard was sickly and had no children. Sir Ralph, naturally wishing to continue the line, tried to make Margaret’s son James [Boswell], his heir. However, Ralph’s two brothers, Lewknor and George, contested this fiercely, for they would much rather have seen the property pass to Lewknor’s son, Leonard. In the end they got their own way; Lennard [Bosville] died in 1639, only four years after his father, and the property went to Lady Margaret [Boswell]. James, her only son, sadly died before his mother, so that when she died in 1682, the inheritance went to William, Lewknor’s grandson.”\n\nhttps://www.bradbournelakes.co.uk/conservation-restoration/history\n\nHad Lennard Bosville and Margaret (Bosville) Boswell had a brother Thomas Bosville of Little Mote, he would have been their heir to Bradbourne House, not the descendants of their uncle, their father Sir Ralph’s younger brother Lewknor Bosville. So if Sir Ralph Bosville wasn’t the father of Thomas Bosville of Little Mote, husband of Elizabeth Wyatt and father of Dame Margaretta (Bosville) Marsham, who was? Turns out that Thomas was the grandson of Sir Ralph’s first cousin, Henry Bosville of Little Mote (1587-1638), as shown by a detailed pedigree of the Bosvilles of Little Mote in ‘Some Account of Maidstone in Kent’ (1832).\n\nhttps://books.google.ca/books?id=xqFfAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA15&lpg=PA15&dq=Sir+Thomas+Bosville+of+Little+Mote&source=bl&ots=zmYFkGCr-7&sig=ACfU3U2cKWri5VLAkJIWQVHMgNm2O3WcSw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjxkNGyoIziAhUIJDQIHbJMDA8Q6AEwAnoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=Sir%20Thomas%20Bosville%20of%20Little%20Mote&f=false\n\nSo Thomas Bosville of Little Mote loses the Edward III descents behind Mary Lennard, as she was not his mother, but he does have the three lines of descent from Edward I of the Bosvilles. Continuing from the descent above.\n\nA11) Sir Ralph Bosville of Bradbourne House (c.1522-1580) m. 1) Anne Clement, and had two sons A12 (see above) & B12\n\nB12) Sir Robert Bosville of Little Mote, 2nd son (d. 1623) m. Elizabeth Sybil (1565-1602), and had\n\nB13) Sir Henry Bosville of Little Mote (1587-1638) m. Isabella Wiseman (see C4 below), and had\n\nB14) Sir Thomas Bosville of Little Mote (1617-1643) m. Sarah ---, and had\n\nB15) Thomas Bosville of Little Mote (1640-1660) m. Elizabeth Wyatt (descended from Edward III), and had\n\nB16) Margaretta Bosville (1661-1710) m. Sir Robert Marsham, 4th Baronet of Cuxton\n\nPlus, through this line the Marshams have a descent from Sir Thomas More, which I believe is the only line of descent that Sarah, Duchess of York has from the Tudor saint.\n\nSir Thomas More (1478-1535) had a dau,\n\nC1) Margaret More (1505-1544) m.

Somerset, Gent., Bachr, abt 28, & Mrs Margaret Trevelyan, of Nettlecombe, said co., Spr, abt 22, her parents dead…”\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/allegationsforma2324ches/page/n129\n\nWill naturally assumed from this that Audley Grey was born about 1637/8, and Margaret Trevelyan was born about 1643/4. However, the couple’s self-reported ages appear to be off quite a bit. Margaret Trevelyan was baptized 26 August 1634 St Mary Church, Beaminster, Dorset (the parish wherein lay Parnham House, the seat of her maternal family). So she was actually aged about 32, not 22, at her marriage. It’s possible the ages were mis-transcribed in the marriage licence, or that Margaret aged herself down as much as possible (as long as both were over 21, they didn’t need permission from a parent or guardian to wed). I cannot locate online a baptism entry for Audley Grey, but if we assume her husband was also about ten years older than his reported age, he would be born 1627/8. So instead of being the son of his father Angel Grey’s second wife Grace Fulwood (married 2 Oct. 1633 St Martin in the Fields, London; buried 3 Aug. 1672 St Michael Church, Stinsford, Dorset), Audley would be the son of his father’s first wife Katherine Stawell (married 28 Mar. 1625 St Lawrence Church, Ardeley, Hertfordshire; buried 10 Jan. 1632/3 St Michael Church, Stinsford).\n\nVictorian-era genealogist John Paul Rylands, one of the editors of the published 1623 Visitation of Dorset, makes both of Angel Grey’s sons, George Grey and Audley Grey, from his first marriage to Katherine Stawell. This would explain the first name ‘Audley’, as it was Katherine Stawell, not Grace Fulwood, who descended from the Barons Audley.\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/miscellaneagenea02howa/page/n335\n\nI’m following Rylands in this case, and in my database, I have Audley Grey as the son of Katherine Stawell. This gives Lora (Grey) Pitt three lines of descent from Edward III, in addition to the one through Urith (Chichester) Trevelyan already in Genealogics.\n\nLORA GREY, b. posthumously Kingston Maurward House, Stinsford, Dorset, bap. 14 Dec. 1675 St Michael Church, Stinsford; d.
