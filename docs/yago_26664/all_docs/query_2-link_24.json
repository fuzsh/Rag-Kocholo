        "text": "The “domestic” scenes of Shakespeare’s Henry IV Part I ground the battles, plots, and displays of knavery. The women—Lady Percy and Lady Mortimer—give the actions of territorial, cockfighting men consequence. In II.iv, we see Hotspur at home with his playful wife, and we can for a moment forget his arrogance and excessive language as he assumes the mantle of husband and even shows a slight bent toward uxoriousness. Kate leads the activity in the scene, however, and she is the one who closes it; by an examination of the play between the Percys, we see that Kate is a reflection of her husband and that she likewise reflects—but does not mimic or represent—his fate at the play’s end.\n\nThe kind of love Hotspur and Kate play for us is the stuff of a comic scene in a tragedy, as when, in I.i. of Antony and Cleopatra, the Egyptian Queen toys with her own heroic soldier to force him to make the admission of love (in effect an abdication of power) she wants to hear. In that scene, the comedy derives from the dialogue and its many interruptions; the playfully sweet scene between the Percys gets its laughs in a similar fashion. Though Kate doesn’t cut her husband’s words off, she does have the greater part of the lines until Hotspur steps in to reassure her. She enters, and asks, “why are you thus alone?” (II.iv.31). Kate’s concern when we meet her seems to be that she lies, like Penelope, relicta1; however, after a further 25 lines in which Kate poetically describes the elements of war worrying her husband, we realize that her true concern is that “Some heavy business hath [her] lord in hand, / And [she] must know it, else he loves [her] not” (II.iv.57-58). Twenty-six lines of near-epic verse—“Of basilisks, of cannon, culverin, / Of prisone...\n\n... middle of paper ...\n\n...y enters the stage as a feminine reflection of her warrior husband. Her loss in the domestic sphere is practically complete, for her gain is small, conciliatory, and not what she originally desired. That Kate’s defeat to Hotspur is a reflection of Hotspur’s own fate is arguable, but Hotspur receives no treaty from Hal, let alone the poor one Kate manages to win. What we have in the end, then, is the contrast between the two men as victors. Hal takes everything—“youth,” “brittle life,” and “proud titles”—from Hotspur; Hotspur attempts to make “Two stars keep [. . .] their motion in one sphere” by allowing Kate to follow him whither he goes (V.iv.76-78, 64). Kate, though she reflects Hotspur, as the one whose “name in arms were not now as great as [Hotspur’s],” represents the would-be fate, insufficient as a defeat, of Hal were he the one conquered in the end (V.iv.69)."
