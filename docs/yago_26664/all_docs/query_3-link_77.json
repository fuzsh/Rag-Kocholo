        "text": "A Continuation of the Marquis de Ruvigny'sThe Plantagenet Roll of the Blood Royal\n\nThis site lists some descendants of King Edward III of England. It is intended to begin at the point (actually, points) at which the Marquis of Ruvigny ended his own listing in The Plantagenet Roll of the Blood Royal: The Mortimer-Percy Volume, Part I. A lower-case letter before each listed person, living or dead, indicates the number of generations from Edward (e.g., Edward's own children are in generation \"a\"; those twenty generations down from Edward are in generation \"t\"). Further, a number prefixed to the generational letter indicates birth order by male-preferential primogeniture.\n\nDescents are traced down to those now living, or as far as possible. My intent, however, is to trace individuals not already given by virtue of some senior descent in the five Ruvigny volumes. Therefore, such already-traced descents are merely cross-referenced to the appropriate Ruvigny volume and are not updated. Illegitimate children are generally not listed unless they or their descendants marry back in to the legitimate line. Such children are always given [in brackets]. \"vp\" = \"vita patris,\" died in the lifetime of the father; \"sp\" = \"sine prole,\" without issue.\n\nPlaces of birth, marriage and death are not generally given unless they occur outside of Great Britain.\n\nAny new information on these lines is welcome; please e-mail me at noonanbarry@hotmail.com. Please note the number of the relevant page (i.e., the three-digit number in the URL) in your subject line!\n\nBarry Christopher Noonan\n\nMadison, WI\n\nOctober, 2003\n\nAUXILIARY PAGES (with date of latest update)\n\nNOTE: Pages 015 through 020 renamed 025 to 030 on 2006 Sep 2.\n\nNOTE TO CRAYCROFT DESCENDANTS: The Craycroft pages (008, 008a, 008b, 008c) are undergoing revision. Cross-references in case of intermarriage may be inaccurate (i.e., \"see above\" and see below\" may actually refer to other pages; \"see page 008X\" may refer to a different page). --bcn 2009 Nov 12.\n\n001: Descendants of Sir Thomas WENTWORTH (died 1644) and Elizabeth SAVILE (died 1666).
