Notes\n\nTitles:\n\nEarl of Northumberland (1377 cr - 2nd)\n\nHenry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland, (3 February 1392 /1393 â 22 May 1455) was the son of Henry Percy and his wife Elizabeth de Mortimer, daughter of Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March and Philippa Plantagenet.\n\nHe was restored to favor in 1416 by Henry V of England, receiving the estates of his paternal grandfather Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland the re-creation of his earldom.\n\nHe was apparently loyal to Henry V till the death of the later on 31 August 1422. Henry V was succeeded by his one-year-old son Henry VI of England. Percy was on the regency council in the early years of the new reign.\n\nPercy was later involved in the Wars of the Roses which placed him in an awkward situation. He owed his loyalty to the House of Lancaster but was first cousin of Anne Mortimer and kinsman to her son Richard, Duke of York, head of the House of York. On 22 May, 1455, Percy fought on the Lancastrian side in the First Battle of St Albans, first battle of the Wars. He was among the casualties.\n\nPercy married Lady Eleanor Neville, daughter of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland and his second wife Joan Beaufort. Her siblings included Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury and Cecily Neville. They had ten children."
