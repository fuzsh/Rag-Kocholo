        "text": "Origin of the family\n\nThat the Mortimer family of Hatfield Peverel, Essex were originally from Devon is without a doubt. The names of the early generations bear a very close resemblance to the Mortimers of Bow, and Mark Mortimer even mentions his property in Bow in his will dated 1685. Mark’s brother, Peter Mortimer, was born in 1630, Bow. The description of Mark Mortimer’s family begins here.\n\nMark Mortimer of London (c.1625-1685)\n\nMark Mortimer was born in Bow, Devon, in the mid 1620s, an elder son of John Mortimer, yeoman, and his wife Charity, nee Discombe, who married in 1620. He was presumably apprenticed in London around the year 1640, and became a grocer. He evidently achieved significant success in the grocery trade and built up his fortune, acquiring property in London and Hertfordshire. He married Abigail Walmesley, 3 Oct 1651, in St Ann & St Agnes parish, London. Their children were John c.1656 and Peter b. 1661. Mark Mortimer’s heir was his son John, as all other children died young. He made a will 4 Jun 1685, mentioning his wife Abigail, John his son, Peter his brother, and Peter’s two sons. He mentioned property he had in Bow, Devon, and left money to the poor of the parish of Bow.\n\nJohn Mortimer of Toppinghoe Hall\n\nJohn Mortimer was born in the mid 1650s, named after his paternal grandfather John Mortimer of Bow. He was brought up in London or nearby and received a commercial education. He entered into the mercantile profession and became a prosperous merchant in London. In 1685, he inherited considerable property from his father Mark Mortimer, a grocer. He invested in property by buying the country estate of Topping Hall, Hatfield Peverel in 1693.\n\nJohn Mortimer wrote about a wide variety of topics, particularly agriculture. His best known work being ‘The Whole of Art of Husbandry’, published in 1707. The work consisted of 15 books in one volume, forming a “landmark in agricultural literature”. Mortimer continued to be cited in agricultural research for over two hundred years and his legacy was to be considered as one of the foremost agriculturalists of his time.\n\nHe married first in 1680, to Dorothy Cromwell, daughter of Richard Cromwell, and granddaughter of Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector. She died childless the following year. He married secondly, 15 Jun 1682 in London to Sarah Tippets, daughter of Sir John Tippets. They had two children,\n\n1. John (c.1684-bef.1736), who predeceased his father.\n\n2. Margaret (c.1685-1761), who left a will dated 1760, which mentions her next of kin and their relationship.\n\nJohn’s wife Sarah died in the late 1680s. John married thirdly Elizabeth Sanders (c.1665-1736), a Derbyshire heiress, 20 Feb 1689 at Saint Vedast Foster Lane and Saint Michael Le Querlo Church, London. They had the following children:\n\n3. Samuel Mortimer of Toppinghoe Hall (c.1692-1759), who died unmarried and without children. The estate passed to his nephew Hans Winthrop Mortimer.\n\n4. Elizabeth c. 1695, who married in 1723 Dr Theophilus Lobb, (1678-1763), a physician and medical writer.\n\n5. Thomas d.1699\n\n6. Cromwell Mortimer (1702-1752), named after the his father’s first wife Dorothy Cromwell’s family. He was a physician and antiquary, and member of the Royal Society. He married Mary, and had a son:\n\ni. Hans Winthrop Mortimer (1734-1807). He became a property speculator and MP, sitting in the Commons between 1775-1790. He became very wealthy, possessing an income of £6,000 a year and a fortune of £30,000.\n\nHe sold the family estate of Toppinghoe Hall in 1768 and bought Caldwell Hall, Derbyshire, which remained his residence. Hans Winthrop Mortimer’s business ventures all ended in failure and he was driven into debt, even forced into debtors prison at the Fleet for a number of years. He married Ann and had the following children:\n\n1. Anna Maria 1766\n\n2. Harriet 1769\n\n3. Hans Saunders Mortimer 1773-1846\n\n4. Theodosia Frances Georgina 1775-1852, who married Valentine Green, 20 Jul 1796 St Pancras.\n\n5. Charlotte Jemima 1777-1851, who married George Hanmer Leycester, 3 Aug 1796 St Pancras.\n\n7. Mary 1703-1704\n\n8. Thomas Mortimer (1706-1741), the youngest son of John Mortimer. He became principal secretary to Sir Joseph Jekyll, Master of the Rolls. He married a lady called Ann, and had a son and daughter:\n\ni. Thomas Mortimer Esq 1730-1810\n\nii. Ann c.1733-, who married Thomas Willis, 31 Oct 1761, St Paul’s church Covent Garden, Middlesex. They had issue: Thomas Willis 1769, Ann Charlotta 1776, Ann Theodosia 1778-1854, & Elizabeth 1782.\n\nThomas Mortimer (1730-1810)\n\nThomas Mortimer was the only son of Thomas Mortimer, and was born 9 Dec 1730, Carey St., Lincoln’s Inn Fields, London. His father died when he was 10, and his mother died when he was 14. As minors, both Thomas and his sister Ann were left under the guardianship of John Baker of Spitalfields. He was sent to boarding school at Harrow, and then studied in a private academy. He learnt French and Italian and studied modern history.\n\nLike his grandfather John Mortimer the agriculturalist, Thomas Mortimer became a well known writer, focusing on economic affairs. His longest work was ‘The British Plutarch’, published in 1762. He was made Vice-Consul for the Austrian Netherlands in 1762, on the recommendation of the Secretary of State. In 1768 he was dismissed from this post and returned to England to continue writing, also working as a private tutor. Mortimer’s publications included ‘Every Man his own Broker; or Guide to Exchange Alley’, published 1761, and ‘Dictionary of Trade and Commerce’, published 1766.\n\nHe married firstly Elizabeth Whiteman, 13 Jan 1752, in Isleworth, Middlesex. They had the following children born in London. Interestingly, both John and George Mortimer moved from London to Devon, their ancestral homeland.\n\n1. Esther (c.1754-aft.1827), who married a Mr Taylor, and had issue:\n\ni.

George Mortimer Esq c.1763-1833, who became a lieutenant in the Royal Marines. In 1791 he went on a voyage round the South Seas in HMS Mercury, commanded by John Cox, Esq., as part of a British and Swedish mission against Russia. He wrote an account of the voyage published in 1791. George Mortimer married a lady called Mary, but had no issue. He made a will dated 1833, mentioning his various relatives including cousins in the Willis family. He resided at Wellinghouse, otherwise called Sandy Park House, in Drewsteignton, Devon, where he died in 1833 or the following year.\n\nThomas’ wife Elizabeth died and Mortimer remarried to Louisa Brun, a spinster, 14th Aug 1793, St Marylebone, Westminster. They had the following children. Thomas Mortimer died 31 March 1810 in Clarendon Square, London.\n\n7.

(1756- )\n\nJohn was the eldest son of Thomas Mortimer Esq., a well known writer. He was baptised 31 May 1756, St Clement Danes, Westminster.

Lionel Mortimer 1868-1871\n\n5. Arthur Mortimer 1870-1944\n\nThe family continues in the male line, through the sons of John Mortimer b. 1826. There are now many descendants of the family.\n\nOrigins\n\nThe Mortimers of Bow were presumably closely related to the Mortimers at Sandford or Tedburn St Mary.\n\nThe earliest member of this branch was Mark Mortimer of Bow (c.1550-1621), who married at Colebrooke, and who was presumably related to the earlier Mortimers at Colebrooke.\n\nJohn Mortimer of Colebrooke (c.1500-1559)\n\nJohn Mortimer first appeared in the 1524 Devon Lay Subsidy under Colebrooke, near Crediton, where his income was assessed at £7, in goods, suggesting he was a yeoman. He also appeared in the 1543 Lay Subsidy, with income dropping only £1, to £6, suggesting that the two entries for John are the same individual. John died in 1559, and was bur. 14 Feb 1558/9. John left a will, which abstract survives in the College of Arms, but is still to be examined. It is hoped that reading such a will could reveal his family connections. He presumably had a son, the following Thomas Mortimer, and other children. His wife may have been Christian Mortimer, bur. 1569 Colebrooke.\n\nThomas Mortimer of Colebrooke (c.1520-1573)\n\nThomas was presumably born before 1524, and first appears in the 1543 Devon Lay Subsidy for Colebrooke, with income of £4 in goods. His income at this time was less than his father, John Mortimer, though he presumably inherited his father’s goods after his death in 1559. Thomas died in 1573, and was bur. 13 Feb 1572/3. He left a will, which transcript survives in the College of Arms. Thomas perhaps married Joan Mortimer, who was bur. 1579. His children were perhaps the following:\n\n1. John Mortimer, d.1588, who may have been the eldest son, so named after his paternal grandfather.\n\n2. Mark Mortimer of Bow\n\n3. Mary, m. 1575 Colebrooke to William Frost\n\nMark Mortimer of Colebrooke (c.1550-1621)\n\nMark Mortimer was b. around 1550. He married Elizabeth Westway, the 7 Feb 1573/4 at Colebrooke. Mark Mortimer and his family lived at Bow, otherwise called Nymet Tracey. In the 1581 Devon Lay Subsidy he paid tax on an income of £4 in goods. He married for a second time on 4 Jun 1603 Zeal Monachorum, to Ann Underwood. The parish records for Bow do not begin until the 17th century. He probably had the following children with his first wife Elizabeth.\n\n1. Thomas Mortimer of Bow (c.1577/1621), who was presumably a son of Mark m. 1574, but whose life details remain unknown. He left a will dated 1621.\n\n2. John Mortimer of Bow\n\n3. Robert Mortimer of Bow (c.1583-c.1633), who m. Ann Ascott, 25 Oct 1611, Bow. They had a daughter Mary b. 1615, Bow, and possibly other children. He was absent from the 1642 Protestation Oath list for Bow, and presumably died before then.\n\n4. William Mortimer of Bow (c.1586-c.1650), who featured in the 1642 Proteststion Oath for Bow. He had the following children by an unknown wife:\n\ni. Catherine 1627\n\nii. Thomas 1629-1631\n\niii. William Mortimer II 1629\n\niv. Mary 1631\n\nv. Wilmot 1637\n\n5. Christopher Mortimer of Rewe (c.1590-c.1655), who m. Grace Shobrooke, 9 Jun 1624 Exeter St Sidwell. Christopher appeared in the 1642 Protestation Oath in Rewe, near Exeter. Christopher and Grace Mortimer had three daughters:\n\ni. Sarah 1628\n\nii. Grace 1630\n\niii. Wilmot 1633\n\nJohn Mortimer of Bow (c.1581-c.1655)\n\nJohn Mortimer married Charity Discombe in 1620, at Bow. He appeared in the 1642 Protestation Oath at Bow. They had the following children:\n\n1. Mark Mortimer of London and Chesham (c.1625-1686), father of John Mortimer of Toppinghoe Hall, Esq.\n\n2. Christopher Mortimer of Exeter (1627-c.1680), presumably named after the earlier Christopher Mortimer c.1590-, who was probably a member of this family. He married and had the following children in Exeter. Christopher Mortimer might have died before 1685, and was not mentioned in his brother Mark Mortimer’s will.\n\ni. Ann 1650\n\nii. Christopher Mortimer II 1659\n\niii. Joanna 1665\n\niv. Ann 1674, who was presumably the daughter by a second marriage.\n\n3. Peter Mortimer of London (c.1630-aft.1685), who married Margaret Loringer in 1662. They had the following children in London:\n\ni. Peter 1663-c.1665\n\nii. Mark 1664-1669\n\niii. Peter 1667\n\niv. John 1670-c.1675\n\nv. Abigail 1672\n\nvi. Margaret 1674\n\nvii. Mark 1675\n\nviii. John 1677\n\nix. Peter 1679-1681\n\nx. Mary 1685-1689\n\n4. John Mortimer b. 1633, of whom nothing further is known. He may have died young, or moved to Exeter or London.\n\nOrigins\n\nThe first known member of this family was Thomas Mortimer, born c.1466, who probably lived in Tedburn St Mary. The parish adjoins Crediton, and Thomas was presumably connected to the Mortimers of Sandford.\n\nThomas Mortimer of Tedburn St Mary (c.1466-c. 1512)\n\nIn 1500/1501, John Byrgyn, John Moxhay the elder, and Stephen Flode, brought suit against in Chancery against Thomas Mortimer for detaining deeds relating to land in Uppecote, Tettebourne (Tedburn St Mary). Thomas died before the 1524 lay subsidy, when his widow Margaret, lived in Tedburn St Mary. Her income was assessed on goods worth £2, and she presumably inhabited a dower house.\n\nThomas married Margaret, (c.1470-c.1533) and had sons:\n\n1. Richard Mortimer\n\n2. John Mortimer (c.1497-c. 1555) who lived in Tedburn St Mary in 1524 and was taxed on wages worth £1 in the lay subsidy of that year. He was still living there twenty years later when he was assessed at the same income in the 1543 subsidy. His income assessment suggests he was a servant or worker.\n\nRichard Mortimer of Tedburn St Mary (c.1493-1559)\n\nIn the 1524 lay subsidy Richard was assessed on goods worth £10.\n\nIn 1538 he leased the capital messuage of Hakeworthy (Great Hackworthy) from John Ackland, with entail to wife Joan and son Thomas. By 1543, Richard had inherited his mother’s dower property, which saw his income increase to £12. Richard Mortimer was bur. 26 Dec 1559. His will was proved in 1559/60. His wife was Joan (c.1505-bef.1574) who died in either 1565 or 1574, Tedburn St Mary. Richard and Joan Mortimer had the following children.\n\n1. Thomas Mortimer\n\n2. (Robert) Mortimer c.1533-1561, of Tedburn St Mary, who might otherwise have been a son of John Mortimer fl.1524. He had sons John b.1559, and 1560/1, although no further record of his son is found in the parish. This John may have lived in Exeter; see Misc: Mortimers of Exeter. Robert may have had an older son, Thomas Mortimer of Tedburn b. c.1555 who in the 1581 subsidy had an income of £3. It’s possible Robert died soon after his son was born, and his widow Joan remaried to Richard Perlyn in 1564, Tedburn St Mary\n\n3. John Mortimer of Hennock (c.1535-1587), perhaps fits into the family here. Hennock is a nearby parish to Tedburn St Mary. John Mortimer had sons Richard, John and William Mortimer, though Richard was the eldest.\n\n• Margery Mortimer (c.1540-1593), who was perhaps named after Margaret wife of Thomas. She married Thomas Strange (c.1540-1565), 15 Oct 1564 Tedburn St Mary.\n\n• Thomasin Mortimer c.1544, who m. 8 Nov 1572 Tedburn St Mary to Robert Strange\n\nThomas Mortimer of Tedburn St Mary (c.1530-1599)\n\nAs the eldest son of Richard Mortimer, Thomas inherited property in Tedburn St Mary from his father in 1559. He was first mentioned in the 1538 deed between John Ackland and Richard Mortimer, concerning the leasehold estate of Hackworthy, Tedburn. Thomas Mortimer featured in the 1569 Muster Roll, with income of £7 in goods. 12 years later in the 1581 Lay subsidy, Thomas’ income was assessed at £5 in goods. He was buried the 5 Dec 1599, Tedburn St Mary. Thomas married Elizabeth, c.1535-1606, and they had the following children:\n\n1. Joan b. 8 May 1559 Tedburn St Mary. Though her parentage was not stated in the baptism record, she was presumably a daughter of Thomas, and was born slightly earlier in the year than John son of Robert (see above)\n\n2. William Mortimer (1561-aft.1606), b. 3 Aug 1561, was mentioned in the will of his mother Elizabeth in 1606, at which time he had a wife Margery and children living. Though he was just old enough to have adult children if he had married in his 20s, his children mentioned in 1606 were evidently underage. He presumably lived in Cheriton Bishop and had sons Thomas and John, and was still living at the time of the 1642 Protestation Oath, which he signed as William Mortimer the elder. Other Mortimers living in Cheriton Bishop at the time were Thomas, John and William Mortimer. Following such an interpretation, his sons were:\n\ni. Thomas Mortimer of Cheriton Bishop (c.1603-1654), the eldest son, presumably named after his grandfather. He was perhaps one of the children of William Mortimer mentioned in the will of Elizabeth Mortimer of Tedburn, widow, in 1606. He married Frances Bremelcomb of Cadleigh (c.1603-c.1650) by licence dated 2 Aug 1630 at Exeter, at which time he was living in Drewsteignton. In 1642 he appeared in the Protestation return taken at Cheriton Bishop, alongside his presumed John Mortimer, and William Mortimer the elder and younger. His father William Mortimer was presumably still living, he was born 1561 so would have been aged over 80 at the time, a grand old age but not an impossible achievement. His will was dated 1654, Cheriton Bishop, by which time his wife had obviously died, as he left his property to his sons. Their children were:\n\n1. William Mortimer of Bridford 1631-pos. 1695? Bovey Tracey, yeoman. William was the eldest son and named after his grandfather William Mortimer of Cheriton Bishop. He was bap. 23 Oct 1631, and m. Joan Dreamed 25 Oct 1653, Cheriton Bishop. They had two children, William b. 7 Nov 1654, Bridford and Frances (named after her grandmother Frances Bremelcomb), b. 27 Dec 1657, Bridford. No further information about them or their children is known. He possibly died in 1695, Bovey Tracey, when the estate of William Mortimer was administered, though equally this may instead have been his son of the same name. William should not be confused with the William Mortimer of Tiverton c.1631-1681, whose wife was also called Joan but whose first child was born before 1654.\n\n2. Mary c.1633\n\n3. John Mortimer of Torbryan 1635-1685, ancestor of related Mortimer families in Ilsington and Ashburton. His son was possibly John Mortimer of Exeter St Edmund\n\n4. Mark Mortimer of Mamhead 1638-1680, ancestor of the Mortimers of Powderham.\n\nii. John Mortimer of Cheriton Bishop c.1606-1664, who was presumably the younger brother of the above Thomas Mortimer. He m. Christian Pollard, 22 Jun 1636, Cheriton Bishop. They had no issue. In 1642 he appeared in the Protestation Oath taken at Cheriton Bishop, as stated above. John Mortimer and Christian his wife featured in the poll tax of 1660 in Cheriton Bishop. He died in 1664, Cheriton Bishop when his will was proved by his wife, Christian. She died in 1666 and was laid to rest beside her late husband.\n\n3. Thomas Mortimer II, of whom next.\n\n4. Wilmot 1566-1572, who died in childhood; bap. 21 Jan 1565/6, bur. 7 Mar 1571/2.\n\n5. John Mortimer (1569-1641), ancestor of the Mortimers of North Bovey, Drewsteignton and Christow. He was bap. 20 Oct 1569. He married Thomasin c.1595, and they had the following children. John was bur. 11 May 1641 Tedburn St Mary. Thomasin his wife was bur. Christmas Day 1635, though her first name is obscured by a register defect.\n\ni. Maud 1597, bap. 18 Oct 1597 Tedburn St Mary, m. Richard Vinderhay 29 Nov 1621 Bovey Tracey.\n\nii. John 1600-1600, died in infancy; bap. 3 Feb, bur. 6 Feb 1599/1600.\n\niii. Walter Mortimer of North Bovey (1601-1672), mentioned as a “cousin” in the will of his grandmother Elizabeth Mortimer, 1606.\n\niv. Nicholas Mortimer of Drewsteignton (1604-1663)\n\nv. Matthew Mortimer of Christow (1607-1679)\n\n(vi). Martha? 1609 Hennock\n\n(vii). John? Mortimer II 1612 Hennock\n\nvi. Joan 1616, bap. 5 Apr 1616\n\nvii. Ursula 1619-1619, who died in infancy; bap. 17 Jan, bur. 9 Feb 1618/19\n\n6. Thomasin c.1571-, who married John French 4 May 1594, Tedburn St Mary. Thomas was presumably born around 1570, perhaps too late to be the daughter of Robert. She was mentioned as a daughter in the will of Elizabeth Mortimer, 1606. John and Thomasin had two children, who were mentioned in the will of their grandmother:\n\ni. Joan French b. 1594\n\nii. Thomas French b. 1596\n\nThomas Mortimer II of Tedburn St Mary (1564-1619)\n\nThomas was b. 28 Sep 1564, the second son of Thomas and Elizabeth. Thomas perhaps appeared in the 1581 lay subsidy with income of £3, despite being in his minority. Together the income of the two Thomas Mortimers in this subsidy adds up to the income of Richard Mortimer in 1543, suggesting they were his heirs. Thomas Mortimer left a will dated 26 May 1619 in Tedburn St Mary, which was proved on 17 Dec 1619. He married Wilmot (c.1565- ), and had the following children:\n\n1. Elizabeth b.1598, bap. 17 Nov 1598, Tedburn St Mary, mentioned as a cousin in the will of her grandmother Elizabeth d.1606, also mentioned in her fathers will, 1619,perhaps m. Mark Perriman, in 1635 Ashcombe.\n\n2. Thomas Mortimer III (c.1600- ), the last of the family in Tedburn St Mary. He may have been either the eldest or second son. He was presumably named after Thomas Mortimer (c.1530-99).\n\nHe married firstly Elizabeth Strong (d. 1637) 22 Apr 1634 Tedburn St Mary, with whom he had a daughter, Margaret (1636-7) who died in infancy.\n\nHe married secondly Elizabeth Moore (d. 1669), 29 Apr 1637, and they had a son Thomas Mortimer III (b. 1637). It’s unknown how long Thomas lived, but there are no further references to the family in the parish after the civil war.\n\n3. John Mortimer of Tedburn (1604-1652), bap. 22 Jul 1604, m. Mary Hooper, 12 Jun 1627, Crediton. John Mortimer bur. 1652, Crediton, which burial record stated he lived in Tedburn, and mentioned his wife Mar_. They had a daughter Catherine b.1627.\n\n4. Nathaniel Mortimer, ancestor of the Mortimer family of millers in Dunsford and later Powderham.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nRead about related Mortimer families in Devon:\n\nThe Mortimers of Devon – The Early Generations\n\nThe Mortimers of Kingsteignton\n\nThe Mortimers of Dunsford"
