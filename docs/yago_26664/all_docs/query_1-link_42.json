        "text": "AIUI, Percy rebelled in alliance with the Welsh prince Glyndwyr and Sir Edmund Mortimer (who had been captured by Glydwyr and then married Glyndwyr's daughter). Sir Edmund was the uncle of Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March (b. 1391), who had been heir presumptive to Richard II; Sir Edmund claimed the crown for his nephew, even though the Earl was in royal custody. (OTL, the Earl was raised in company with the future Henry V ( b. 1386), and despite his own, theoretically superior claim to the crown, was Henry's friend and completely loyal vassal until they both died in the 1420s.)\n\nIf the rebels win at Shrewsbury, as postulated, the next Lancastrian heir is Henry IV's eldest surviving son, Thomas (b. 1387), who wold be too young to lead the faction. However, Henry IV had three younger half-brothers, the Beauforts, who were powerful figures: John, Earl of Somerset (b. 1373), Henry Beaufort (b. 1375), Bishop of Lincoln and Lord Chancellor, and Thomas (b. 1377). Also a half-sister, Joan (b. 1379), who was married to Ralph Neville, Earl of Westmorland, one of the King's most trusted counsellors.\n\nI would expect Somerset, Lincoln, and Westmorland to rally the remaining Lancastrian forces behind Thomas. The rebels would have \"momentum\", but the Lancastrians would probably have custody of the young Earl of March. OTL, the rebels broke him out briefly in 1405. In the wake of victory at Shrewsbury, they might well achieve this.\n\nIf they don't - the Lancastrians can threaten to execute the Earl (and his younger brother Roger). But then the Mortimer claim passes to their sister Anne (b. 1388) or more likely to Sir Edmund. It gets awkward - the Mortimer claim is through a female line (Philippa, daughter of Lionel of Antwerp, second son of Edward III), but at this time, no one is going to accept a 15-year-old Queen Regnant.\n\nI honestly doubt that the Lancasters would fight on with their king dead and his heir either dead or captive. Henry IV had alienated many of the supporters who put him on the throne, like the Percys, and the Percys were original Kings in the North, long before Game of Thrones was a thing. They dominate the north of England already and have incredible resources in their own right. If they win hard enough to kill Henry IV and capture Prince Hal then they've just smashed the royal army and the Beauforts aren't going to be able to rally an army against them. As the Percy grudge was chiefly against Henry IV personally for his mistreatment of them, I doubt they would try to purge the remaining Lancastrians either, thus not giving the Beauforts a reason to want to fight on. Henry IV's sons would probably be jailed like the Earl of March but the Beauforts would probably retain their estates and such if they didn't actively resist.\n\nIf Percy forces manage to achieve victory and put Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March on the throne, what allies do the Mortimers have at that point besides the Percys? What marriage best secures Edmund's position? Would marriage to a Lancaster placate them for a time? As for a captive Prince of Wales, does he remain a lifetime captive of the Mortimers because he's too much of a danger to become a rallying point for a Lancaster uprising?\n\nThe Percys are probably enough to keep the throne, especially if they don't start further antagonising other nobles. Henry Hotspur was one of England's foremost military commanders, his father (also Henry) was 1st Duke of Northumberland and King of Mann, Constable of England, Warden of Scottish Marches and formerly Marshal of England and Admiral of the Northern Seas and, as noted above, was effectively King in the North. Hotspur's uncle was Thomas Percy, 1st Earl of Worcester and Admiral of the Kings Fleet in Ireland, and formerly Admiral of the North and Richard II's Seneschal. They were also allies with the Archbishop of York, Richard le Scrope, who had enough influence to raise his own in rebellion against Henry IV in 1405 IOTL, as well as several important Scottish nobles including Archibald Douglas, 4th Earl of Douglas, who fought alongside Hotspur at Shrewsbury. No doubt they also had numerous more minor nobles among their allies, especially in the north, whose names are less readily available to a quick search. To put it another way, the Percys are an incredibly powerful faction in England and lost IOTL because of bad luck. Their army at Shrewsbury was already superior to the royal army and they have the ability to raise even more soldiers if they need. This could lead to the power in England turning to the north, at least for a generation or two, actually.\n\nOn the topic of marriages tho, Edmund Mortimer could be married to Blanche of Lancaster, Henry IV's eldest daughter born in 1392 (1 year after Edmund), if a reconciliation marriage policy is needed.\n\nSo if the Percys get major holdings in Cumberland, which I believe was one of the points of grievance for their rebellion, then they basically have a contiguous 'kingdom within a kingdom' stretching from Newcastle-on-Tyne to Carlisle? Were there allies of Henry IV north of the Humber who might lose holdings to House Percy in a peace agreement? Were the Nevilles allies of Henry IV or were they neutral bystanders during the rebellion?\n\nI saw a video about the Battle of Shrewsbury that stated that Owain Glyndwr in Wales was sending an army to link up with Hotspur but couldn't make it in time. Was the video correct about Glyndwr being an active participant? If Edmund Mortimer recognizes Welsh independence, did Glyndwr have cordial enough relations with the Percys to be considered one of their allies post-rebellion?\n\nI don't know the noble holdings in England to that level of detail, unfortunately. The Nevilles were not overtly allied to Henry IV when it came to the Battle of Shrewsbury but would probably have supported him as loyal vassals of the King. I can't imagine they would lose territory or anything like that. Any Percy gains would be probably be from small nobles captured in the battle as stripping titles wantonly would be deeply unpopular.\n\nThis claim appears fairly often, IIRC from writing my Owain Glyndwr TL some years ago (see my signature), as does the claim that Hotspur and Glyndwr had made an alliance before Hotspur raised his standard in rebellion. I'm a bit skeptical of this tho. Glyndwr's rebellion didn't really have substantial armies, they operated more like highly effective guerrillas (their successes were against woefully poorly garrisoned castles, 'civilian' mobs like in Pembrokeshire and went they took advantage of local weather and terrain as when they captured Sir Edmund Mortimer at the Battle of Bryn Glas), except when a French army arrived in 1405. In 1403, Glyndwr lacked that force and those he did have were campaigning in south Wales. So, no, I doubt he was an active participant other than being also engaged in fighting Henry IV.\n\nYour other question about him being an ally post-Shrewsbury is interesting. If Welsh independence was recognised by a newly proclaimed Edmund I, then yes, Glyndwr would be an ally. We know from OTL that the Percy's and Glyndwr could be allies against a common foe and could work together, even to partition England. But if Hotspur wins then there's an argument that the rebellion would end with a negotiated settlement. The Percys and Mortimers, especially Hotspur and Sir Edmund, had much greater respect for the Welsh than Henry IV had and I could see a Mortimer-Percy England going back to Richard II's policy of conciliation with the Welsh. Welsh nobles were keen supporters of Richard II and the Welsh heritage archers of Cheshire were core parts of his army, as they were for Hotspur at Shrewsbury, which may well be by Henry IV treated them so badly.\n\nWhat is the role of Parliament in all of this? Does it take part in peace negotiations?\n\nNot directly. It is not sitting. It can be called... by the winner.\n\nDoes membership in the House of Lords change, with some members from the losing side being replaced by those from the victorious faction?\n\nConsider the OTL precedents:\n\n1326-1327: Isabella landed at Harwich 24 IX, Parliament not sitting (last sat in 1325). King was in London - fled London 2 X. In late October, King was trying to leave Great Britain by sea, unsuccessfully. Earl of Winchester captured 26 X, executed in cold blood on 27 X. Earl of Arundel captured alive, executed in cold blood 17 XI. Baron Despenser captured alive 16 XI, executed 24 XI. King captured alive in Wales 16 XI. Parliament summoned on 28 X to meet on 14 XII 1326, on 3 XII the meeting put off to 7 I 1327. Only 26 of the 46 barons who had been summoned in October 1326 for the December parliament were then also summoned to that of January 1327, and six of those had never received summonses under Edward II at all. Besides the obvious 3 lords executed. There were fewer lords present than were traditionally summoned, which increased the influence of the Commons. This may have been a deliberate strategy on behalf of Isabella and Mortimer, who, suggests Dodd, would have known well that in the occasionally tumultuous parliaments of earlier reigns, \"the trouble that had been caused in parliament had emanated almost exclusively from the barons\". The Archbishop of York, who had been summoned to the December parliament, was \"conspicuous by his absence\" from the January sitting. Some Welsh MPs also received summonses, but these had deliberately been despatched too late for those elected to attend. The January–February parliament was geographically broader too, as it contained unelected members from Bury St Edmunds and St Albans: says Maddicott, \"those who planned the deposition reached out in parliament to those who had no right to be there\".\n\n1399: Bolingbroke landed in Ravenspurn in late June. King was away in Ireland. King landed in Wales 24 VII, captured in Wales 19 VIII. Parliament summoned 19 VIII, met 30 IX.\n\n1403: No Parliament sitting (last dissolved November 1402, OTL next called in October 1403, met January 1404)\n\n1461: Parliament sitting since October 1460, apparently dissolved forcibly by Yorkist army in March 1461. First Yorkist parliament summoned 23 V 1461, met 4 XI 1461\n\nThe meeting of 1327 Parliament included both a large scale purge (at least 3 lords executed in cold blood, Archbishop of York kept his life and post but conspicuously absent from 1327 Parliament, a total of 20 out of 46 lords gone) and packing (6 completely new lords, plus a bunch of new Commons seats). 146i included forcible dispersal of sitting Parliament. Can anyone comment on the 1399 Parliament - who were removed from Parliament, who were added? And what would a 1403 Parliament of Shrewsbury winners have been like?"
