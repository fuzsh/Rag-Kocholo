        "text": "Jane Seymour was born at Wolf Hall.\n\nJane was born at Wolf Hall, Wiltshire to the Seymour family in 1508. This was just a year prior to her future husband’s coronation. Jane was not highly educated; this was typical for most noblewomen of the day. She could read and write somewhat, but her primary talent was embroidery.\n\nShe was known to be sweet and gentle.\n\nThe contrast between Jane and her predecessor could hardly have been greater. She was soft, sweet-natured and submissive, which were all traits that the aging king liked. Henry was also drawn to her since her mother had given birth to six healthy sons. As Anne’s authority at court began to wane by 1536, many courtiers who had never trusted her started to recommend Jane as a replacement.\n\nShe was never crowned as queen.\n\nThe beginning of Jane’s reign as queen was unfortunate, since the plague and many uprisings in the north caused Henry to focus his attention elsewhere, leading to the postponement of her coronation. She was never crowned as a consequence, and she had the title of Queen Consort until her passing.\n\nShe died of puerperal fever.\n\nFor all women during this time period, regardless of social rank, inadequate hygiene, lack of information and ignorance of diseases and germs made child delivery a risky experience that many women feared. After baby Edward’s baptism, it quickly became clear that Jane was in critical condition. Although the exact cause of her death will never be known because postpartum problems were commonly referred to as “childbed fever,” numerous historians have theorized that it was puerperal fever. Henry was called to her bedside to offer the final rites after all of the doctor’s attempts to revive her had been unsuccessful.\n\nJane Seymour was Henry’s favorite wife.\n\nKing Henry VIII was so devastated by Jane’s passing that he secluded himself in bed for many days, wore all-black clothing for three months, and for the rest of his wretched life, insisted that the time Jane served as queen was the happiest of his career. Many believed that the fact that he was buried close to Jane when he passed away 10 years later was evidence that she was his preferred wife. Many people make fun of Jane’s popularity by claiming that, because of how brief their marriage was, she did not have much opportunity to enrage the king.\n\nJane’s father was part of the army that fought in Henry VIII’s French campaign that occurred in 1513. He was one of King Henry’s most trusted soldiers. For this reason, the king gave him the title of Knight of the Body. At the same time, Jane could be considered as being of royal descent. She was one of the descendants of Elizabeth Mortimer; this was Lionel of Antwerp’s granddaughter. Lionel of Antwerp was not only Duke of Clarence but also Edward III’s third surviving son (English Monarchs, n. d). Thus, Jane Seymour was born into royalty before becoming a queen herself.\n\nWhile she was young, Jane Seymour was to be married to William Dormer, the son of Lady Dormer and Sir Robert. However, Lady Dormer felt that Jane Seymour did not match the social status of her son. This resulted in the breaking off of the engagement.\n\nIt was during King Henry’s stay at Wolf Hall that he first noticed the young Jane Seymour. However, Henry’s glowing affection for Jane created animosity between the latter and Queen Boleyn.\n\nWhat was Jane Seymour known for?\n\nOne of the things that Jane Seymour is known for is providing a legitimate male heir to King Henry VIII’s throne. This is something that the king’s previous wives were unable to do. At the same time, Jane Seymour is known as the only individual to be accorded a queen’s funeral during the reign of King Henry VIII of England. Also, she is the only queen to have been buried beside the king. She is known for attempting to reconcile the differences between the king and Mary — the girl he had given birth to with his first wife. The two had not been on speaking terms for years. The tension between the two originated with King Henry’s stand on the church. He had placed himself as the head of the Catholic Church, a position that was not popular with either Mary or the general English population.\n\nWhat happened to Jane Seymour?\n\nJane Seymour succumbed to postnatal complications. Her pregnancy announcement was made in May 1537, and she delivered her son on October 12, 1537. As custom dictated, Jane Seymour did not take part in her son’s christening. Instead, she remained in her chambers until the end of the elaborate ceremony when she got to see Prince Edward. Unfortunately, she died two weeks after giving birth to her son, who later became King Edward VI. Her labor is believed to have been difficult. It lasted approximately three nights and two days. It is believed that the reason for her difficult labor was that the baby had not been well positioned in her womb. Although it is known that her death occurred following postnatal complications, it was not clear what actually led to her demise. Several theories have been developed in response to the real cause of her death. One theory suggests that she contracted puerperal fever caused by a bacterial infection contracted while giving birth. The other theory is that she died of a pulmonary embolism. Following her death, Jane Seymour was buried at St. George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle.\n\nWho married Jane Seymour?\n\nJane Seymour was married to King Henry VIII of England. She was his third wife. The marriage took place following Anne Boleyn’s execution. Anne Boleyn was King Henry VIII’s second wife. King Henry VIII of England is believed to have mourned the death of his third wife, Jane Seymour, very hard. During his widowerhood, the king not only gained a lot of weight to the point of becoming obese but also developed gout and diabetes.\n\nWas Jane Seymour a queen?\n\nShe was a queen to King Henry VIII of England. Despite her untimely death, her only son became England’s king. She was not only the king’s wife but was also his favorite of all his queens. To a larger extent, this resulted from her giving him a male heir. The fact that she was the only queen to be buried beside King Henry VIII demonstrates the love and affection that the latter had for the former. Due to childbirth-related complications, Jane Seymour was a queen for less than two years. Although she was a queen through marriage, she was never formally given this title through a ceremony, as was the custom."
