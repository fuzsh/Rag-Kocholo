Sir Henry (1364-1403)

1. Sir Henry Percy (Harry Hotspur), son of Henry PERCY (1341-1408) and Margaret NEVILL (1341-1372), was born on 20 May 1364. He died on 21 July 1403. He married Elizabeth MORTIMER.

Harry acquired a great reputation as a warrior, fighting against the Scots and the French. He fought against the Scottish forces of James Douglas, 2nd Earl of Douglas at the Battle of Otterburn in August, 1388 and was captured, but later ransomed. He went to Calais in 1391 and served as governor of Bordeaux from 1393 to 1395. Harry joined with his father and helped depose King Richard II in favor of Henry of Bolingbroke, who later became King Henry IV. ater with his paternal uncle Thomas Percy, Earl of Worcester, he led a rebellion against Henry IV in 1403, forming an alliance with the Welsh rebel, Owain Glyndw^r. Before they could join forces, Hotspur was defeated and killed at the Battle of Shrewsbury when he raised his visor to get some air (as he was wearing plate armour which restricted air circulation) and was immediately hit in the mouth with an arrow and killed instantly. Henry IV upon being brought the body was said to have wept and ordered the body buried but then he had a change of heart and decided to make an example to all those who would rebel and cut his body up into four quarters and sent it around all of England and his head was stuck on a pole at York's gates. He is a major character in William Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part 1, though in the play he is portrayed as being of the same age as his main rival Prince Hal (Henry V of England), when in fact he was considerably older.

Sir Henry Percy, also called Harry Hotspur (May 20, 1364/1366 ?July 21, 1403) was the eldest son of Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland, 4th Lord Percy of Alnwick. His mother was Margaret Neville, daughter of Ralph Neville, 2nd Baron Neville de Raby (c. 1291 - 1367) and Alice de Audley. His nickname is suggestive of his impulsive nature. His date of birth is known but not the exact year of birth.
