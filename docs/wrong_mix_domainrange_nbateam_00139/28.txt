Carmelo Anthony is having a very successful run with the Portland Trail Blazers. But before he ultimately signed with the club earlier this season, he had other options.

One such possibility was the Washington Wizards, a franchise close to his hometown of Baltimore:

“In the midst of everything that was over the past year, it was like, ‘Why not try to go play with them?’ Why not go close to home?’ You know, all that stuff came into play,” said Anthony, according to Michael Lee of The Athletic. “That was kind of the only time I thought about it. If they called, I was ready. Even at that point and time, it was about me getting back in the game. If a team was willing to give me an opportunity, it’s something I would’ve have looked at.”

The Wizards certainly would have been interesting, as Anthony could have teamed up with Bradley Beal. However, it's hard to imagine he would have found more success in Washington than he has been experiencing in Portland.

Through 21 games with the Blazers — all starts — Anthony is averaging 16.2 points, 6.2 rebounds and 1.1 steals over 31.4 minutes per game. He's also shooting 43.2 percent from the floor, 41.0 percent from three-point range and 80.0 percent from the free-throw line.

The three-point percentage is the second-highest of Anthony's NBA career.

Anthony and the Blazers just defeated the Wizards on Friday night, with Anthony finishing with 16 points, six rebounds and a couple of steals in the win.

Unfortunately for Portland, the team has not had much success as a team even after the addition of Melo, as the Blazers are just 15-21 on the season.
