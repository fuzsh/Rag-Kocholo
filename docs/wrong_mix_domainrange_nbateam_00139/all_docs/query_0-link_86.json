        "text": "The doors keep closing on Carmelo Anthony before ringing the doorbell. The 10-time All-Star saw how the Houston Rockets decided to stop counting on him on November 8, a date that marked the beginning of the race to find a destination for him via transfer. Well, a month and a half has passed and for now neither the river sounds nor carries water.\n\nThat is Melo's cloudy present. For some, a victim of the change in the League's game (greater pace and triples). For others, it is his own lack of adaptation to a new role. Be that as it may, the reality is that instead of talking about teams interested in acquiring his services, he becomes one of those that make it clear that they do not want him in their locker room. More clear. A week ago Marc Stein from The New York Times pointed to Los Angeles Lakers, Charlotte Hornets and Philadelphia 76ers as teams that had interest in him. Now it is Stein himself who adds the Washington Wizards to that group.\n\nNot even the sentimental factor seems to help Carmelo. Born in New York but raised in Baltimore since he was 8 years old (a city located about 60 kilometers from Washington), Anthony is experiencing the worst moment of his career without anyone, not even those who saw him become a star up close, are in a position to give him a vote of confidence.\n\nAs for what lies ahead, the aforementioned journalist points out that Houston will push to the limit of transfers; that is, February 7, to see if they can close a trade that saves them several million dollars in luxury tax. Only then will the time come for a layoff that would open the doors for Carmelo to sign with another franchise as a free agent.\n\nThe truth is that the future looks good for neither party, but if we had to bet, it seems more likely that Melo will sign for another team starting February 7 than seeing the Rockets finding a commercial partner. In the 10 games that he has played this season he averaged 13,4 points with 40,5% in field goals and 32,8% in triples.\n\n(Photo by Harry How/Getty Images)"
