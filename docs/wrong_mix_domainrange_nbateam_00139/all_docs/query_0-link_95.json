        "text": "Carmelo Anthony and the Knicks didn’t have that positive “energy’’ Tuesday. In fact, Anthony felt the Knicks didn’t even have enough “effort.’’\n\nWith their triangle and Anthony’s game going kaput in the second half, the Knicks’ two-game winning streak ended with a 98-83 blowout against the Wizards at the Garden.\n\nThe Knicks dropped to 2-2 one day after Anthony said last season’s mess was due to “bad energy.’’\n\nWell, everything was bad Tuesday after halftime, when Washington outscored the Knicks 32-15 in the third quarter, scoring 14 straight points at one juncture as the Knicks missed 10 straight shots.\n\nWashington’s pressure defense turned the triangle into chaos.\n\n“They came out ready and more prepared than us in the third quarter from an energy and effort standpoint,’’ Anthony said. “They were the more physical team.’’\n\nThe Knicks, who face the 0-3 Pistons on Wednesday in Detroit, led 45-40 at halftime before the Wizards dominated the third quarter. Anthony, who had been terrific the previous two outings, was awful, clanking jumpers in too many isolation situations.\n\nAnthony shot 8-of-23, scoring 18 points and committing seven turnovers. Ex-Celtic and ex-Net Paul Pierce was howling on the bench in the fourth quarter, enjoying the moment as he finished with 17 points. John Wall added 11 points and seven assists for the Wizards.\n\n“They sped us up tonight on the offensive end, took us out of our rhythm and flow,’’ Anthony said. “We have to get better when the pressure releases. We have to trust it and not let another team speed us up. It’s not about going to isos. You see something not working the first instinct is to use another option, if that’s to break out of the system and offense. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t.’’\n\nIman Shumpert scored 19 points, but dominated the ball, causing poor ball movement. The Knicks shot 37 percent for the game and didn’t have an assist in the third quarter.\n\n“Our execution has to get better,’’ Shumpert said. “We’ve been doing it since training camp. When they turned up the pressure, we should’ve responded sooner. We got to be crisper.’’\n\nThe Knicks finally missed the poise of starting point guard Jose Calderon, who is out another two weeks with a strained calf.\n\n“Jose, when he comes back, he comes back,’’ Anthony said. “I don’t think about Jose right now. They did a great job, taking out of a lot of our options, sped us up and took us out of our comfort zone.’’\n\nDerek Fisher started Amar’e Stoudemire at power forward and decided against using Quincy Acy, who had started the previous two games. Acy has a sore right wrist and did not play. Fisher said he was looking at the “long-term’’ and didn’t want to play him at less than 100 percent.\n\nAnthony couldn’t get out of his own way after being the hero for two straight contests. With 3:59 left in the game, Shane Larkin went to the line, missed the first, then Anthony got called for a lane violation on the second as they came up empty. Moments later, Anthony forced a jumper off transition, shooting an airball.\n\nThe Wizards turned a 45-40 halftime deficit into a 54-48 bulge with a 14-3 run. After Anthony committed his sixth turnover on a carry call, Wall came down and drained a jumper to put Washington up eight points. At one point, the Wizards scored 14 straight points to lead 70-56 and the Garden filled with boos.\n\n“We want to start winning on our home court, we should feel good playing at the Garden,’’ Anthony said. “Sometimes that doesn’t feel the case. Sometimes it feels a lot of pressure for guys to play at the high level. We should be relaxed.’’"
