        "text": "The Washington Wizards picked up their fifth win of the season over the Toronto Raptors Monday night and were looking to make it two wins in a row as they faced a New York Knicks team without Carmelo Anthony and Amare Stoudamire. The Knicks still had sensation Jeremy Lin, however, who had another nice night picking up 23 points and 10 assists for the double-double in the Wizards 107-93 loss.\n\nJohn Wall had a nice night in the loss, leading the Wizards in scoring with 29 points and adding 6 assists on the night. Trevor Booker was also able to add 17 points and 7 rebounds, but Washington couldn't recover from the first half deficit that the Knicks put them in and just couldn't keep up in the second half.\n\nWe also found out that Jeremy Lin can dunk... as he crossed up John Wall and drove to the basket for the jam."
