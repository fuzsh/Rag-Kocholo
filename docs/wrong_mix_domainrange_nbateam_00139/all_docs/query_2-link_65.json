        "text": "Personal Fouls\n\nAs Coach Ray Masters (guest star Dan Lauria) is inducted to the Metro Basketball Hall of Fame by former students Carmelo Anthony and Chris Bosh, an ex-player accuses the coach of sexually abusing him as a child. Detective Nick Amaro (Danny Pino) transfers into the SVU squad and is thrown on to the case. The detectives interview former players but no one admits to abuse, forcing Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Fin (Ice-T) to dig deeper into Coach Ray's most successful player, basketball star Prince Miller (guest star Mehcad Brooks) and his manager/cousin (guest star Heavy D.) Also starring: Kelli Giddish (Detective Amanda Rollins) and Dann Florek (Captain Donald Cragen.)\n\nThe Wall\n\nWorried about Grace, Jackie leaves rehab early against the medical advice of her counselor and returns to a very different All Saints. On top of the Quantam Bay takeover, this is the first time she's had to work sober."
