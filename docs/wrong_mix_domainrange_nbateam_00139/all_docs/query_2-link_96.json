        "text": "I've been searching for the idea behind my first LinkedIn post for some time now, and finally, a light bulb went on over this past weekend. The flicker upstairs happened after a wide-ranging, heated NBA debate with a close friend (and fellow hoops junkie) over the career of Carmelo Anthony, one of the premier scorers in professional basketball and a headline-laden star who's gotten a bad rap for doing more money-making than winning over the course of his career. While basketball may not be your cup of tea, I promise there is a takeaway that connects to a larger subset of the population than simply NBA fans - growth-minded, career-advancing professionals.\n\nAkin to any worthy academic argument, my case is best stated with a concession made immediately out of the gates, just in order to humanize my perspective and illustrate that the other side of this debate may indeed have some points to their credit. So before I share my take, let me concede: I have never considered the number 124,000,000 before…\n\n…let alone with a \"dollars\" label behind it. That’s the amount of cash that the subject of our case study has coming his way over the course of a 5-year contract he’s currently in with the Knicks. Now I could be wrong, but percentages say that you haven’t had the opportunity to acquire that sum of money either. Okay. That’s fine. Just put yourself in his shoes for a moment.\n\nIf you aren’t familiar with his story, let me synopsize. It’s the summer of 2014. Carmelo’s most recent contract is up. He is free to do as he pleases (e.g. sign a new contract with any team who has the reserves and Brinks trucks ready to go). He wants to see what other teams can offer him – total comp plan, attractive work digs, driven colleagues, top-tier leadership, opportunities for advancement, etc. (Sound familiar?) He talks with other teams, but he chooses to stay in New York, the organization capable of offering him the most money, but with much more uncertainty, a losing culture, and a stench of instability surrounding the organization. Prognosticators and pundits have sold it ever since that summer: “Carmelo only cares about money! He doesn’t care about winning basketball games!”\n\nLet two things be known:\n\nThere were still reasons to take the big money and stay in New York. I won’t get into them here, but Carmelo took a risk on an unpredictable landscape that was undergoing some significant change in 2014.\n\nWhile this may shock you, I do not know Carmelo Anthony. (I’ll have you know though that I have attempted to emulate his mid-post/face-up game from the elbow in 1-on-1 games with my friends. Still haven’t gotten it yet fully… for some strange reason.)\n\nLong story made shorter, I can’t comment with direct clarity on why he decided to accept the career opportunity that he did or the sincerity of his remarks since then: \"I want to win. I don't care about the money.\" However, as I plug into my day-to-day outlook currently as a recruiter, I can’t help but see the opportunity to reflect and share… in tangible ways. Scaled down to a more digestible size, what’s the takeaway that’s available to us – those with careers currently outside of the ESPN SportsCenter highlight reel, who are considering growth and advancement in our own professional endeavors? Well, here are three things to think about that I share almost daily with both active and passive job-seekers:\n\nWrite down your priorities on actual paper. No… like actual loose leaf. Do it even if you aren’t looking for a new position. Trust me. I find myself often times perusing LinkedIn lists for tangible habits or suggestions that may benefit my personal career as well as the careers of job-seekers I speak with on a daily basis. Far and away, the best ones include putting pen to paper and thinking: why did I write that?\n\nAsk the really tough questions. (Hint: Tough questions do not have yes/no answers.) Here’s the best part: no list of tough questions is alike! This one becomes really helpful in interview processes. Hidden second hint: your list of tough questions regarding a new career opportunity probably relates to your priorities. Shhhh.\n\nVisualize. Evaluate the dream career opportunity ahead of time. Select one:\n\nA - Big advancement in salary = $$.\n\nB - Lesser of a step up in $ + in your groove + maximizing individual skills while part of driven team.\n\nIn my opinion, A is nice. However, B is nicer. I believe this is where Carmelo went wrong. He had opportunities to have B, but he chose A. (Side note: I love “groove.” Groove is one of those things that everyone knows, but I still haven’t found the right definition for it. Groove is also known as “flow,” but groove just sounds way cooler than flow.)\n\nNow, unlike folks seeking out career advancement in the corporate world over the course of a 40ish-year career, Anthony's earning power & career as a professional athlete will not last much past the age of 40 - and even that's a stretch. The weight of his decision was magnified because he only gets the chance to take a new opportunity and sign a big contract 2-3 times in his career. So one can understand his reasoning within the constraints he faced. And yes, his decision, its results, and his “legacy” in the world of sports may be under a much more focused magnifying glass with a wider reach. That being said, isn’t your evaluation of a new career opportunity even more important? It’s how you spend your valuable time on this planet. It impacts your loved ones. It’s central to you!\n\n---\n\nIf you’ve made it this far, you are too cool for school. And if you’re fortunate enough to have a moment amid the madness and mayhem of your work day, drop me a line with some feedback. I appreciate it."
