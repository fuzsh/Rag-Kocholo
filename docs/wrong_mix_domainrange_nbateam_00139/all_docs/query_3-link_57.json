        "text": "Will join Designer Carolina Herrera, and Beautyblender Creator Rea Ann Silva as Honorees\n\nStay tuned for more Honoree, performer, and host announcements\n\nWASHINGTON, DC – The Hispanic Heritage Foundation (HHF) announced today that Carmelo Anthony, NBA legend, entrepreneur and philanthropist, will receive the 2024 Hispanic Heritage Award for Sports during the 37th Annual Hispanic Heritage Awards (HHAs) at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts’ Opera House on Thursday, September 5th, 2024.\n\nThe HHAs, supported by 40 national Hispanic-serving institutions, were established by The White House in 1988 to commemorate the creation of Hispanic Heritage Month in America and broadcast on PBS. The Awards are commonly known as “America’s Hispanic Heritage Month Celebration.” Watch the playlist for last year’s awards HERE & Check out HHF past honorees.\n\n“The Hispanic Heritage Foundation is thrilled to honor Carmelo Anthony who is an All-Star on the court and in our communities,” said Antonio Tijerino, HHF President and CEO. “We look forward to paying tribute to Carmelo and all the Honorees through their tremendous accomplishments, cultural pride and delivering on our great promise to this country and the world.”\n\n“It’s an honor to receive this award from The Hispanic Heritage Foundation as their mission to highlight the importance of celebrating and uplifting our LatinX communities very much resonates with me.” said Carmelo Anthony. “My connection to my heritage and community has always been a central part of my life and career, and I’m humbled to be recognized alongside my fellow honorees who share the same commitment to making a positive impact and supporting initiatives that celebrate our culture.”\n\nBorn in Brooklyn, NY, and raised in Baltimore, MD, Carmelo Anthony, also known as “Melo,” began his journey in basketball at a young age. His talent and dedication quickly propelled him to become the highest-ranked high school basketball player in the country. As a freshman at Syracuse University, Anthony led his team to its first national championship, earning the title of the tournament’s Most Outstanding Player.\n\nDrafted as the third overall pick by the Denver Nuggets in 2003, Anthony quickly made his mark, leading his team to the playoffs every year from 2004 to 2010. His journey continued with the New York Knicks in 2011, followed by the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Houston Rockets, the Portland Trail Blazers, and the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nA three-time Olympic gold medalist and one of the top-ten all-time leading scorers in NBA history, Anthony’s achievements extend beyond the NBA through his numerous strategic business ventures and philanthropic efforts.\n\nOver the course of his career, Anthony emerged as a leading force in the movement for athletes to expand their scopes beyond the court and into the boardroom as one of the first to successfully bridge the gap between sports and entrepreneurship. Anthony’s business portfolio includes Isos7 Sports Investments, a platform dedicated to providing growth capital to a diversified portfolio of sports-related businesses and commit a percent of profits to undeserved communities. Anthony and his longtime business partner Asani Swann launched a global estate brand VII(N) – The Seventh Estate committed to diversifying the industry and bringing new voices into the world of wine. Spurred by this same passion for inclusive, purpose-driven content, Anthony established Creative 7 alongside Swann as a global, multi-platform company producing a variety of projects spanning television, film, audio, and digital mediums. Anthony has also recently ventured into the Cannabis industry with the launch of Grand National, a one-of-a-kind agency designed to empower cannabis companies who share their passion for culture, cultivation, and community. The first brand under the agency is STAYME7O Cannabis, which leverages the expertise of the organization and embodies the Grand National mission of empowering ventures aligned with their values including increasing diversity and representation in the cannabis industry.\n\nAnthony’s commitment to social justice and equality is a common thread throughout all his endeavors, including his role as co-founder of The Social Change Fund, which supports critical issues impacting the Black community. In 2021, Carmelo became the inaugural recipient of the NBA’s prestigious Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Social Justice Champion Award.\n\nAnthony’s legacy continues to influence the sport and inspire future generations of basketball players. His journey, marked by determination, excellence, and a deep love for the game, serves as a powerful example for aspiring athletes everywhere.\n\nAbout the Hispanic Heritage Foundation (HHF)\n\nThe Hispanic Heritage Awards serve as a launch of HHF’s year-round mission, focused on education, workforce, social impact, and culture through the lens of leadership.
