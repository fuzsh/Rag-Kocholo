        "text": "New York Knicks 96, Washington Wizards 88\n\nAnthony was assisted by Raymond Felton, who had 23, as the Knicks won their third straight game.\n\nJ.R. Smith tallied 13 points and a career-high 12 rebounds for the Knicks, who opened the fourth quarter with 10 consecutive points after trailing 77-73. The Knicks (35-20) then closed the game on a 9-2 run over the final 4:03.\n\nBradley Beal had a career-high 29 points and 11 rebounds, and Emeka Okafor had 11 points and 10 boards for the Wizards, who have lost two straight, both at home. John Wall had 16 points, six assists and five turnovers for Washington, which had not lost consecutive home games since Dec 22-26. The Wizards fell to 18-39.\n\n- - -\n\nLos Angeles Clippers 105, Cleveland Cavaliers 89\n\nA leading candidate for the Sixth Man of the Year award, Crawford had a game-high 24 points in the Clippers' 105-89 blowout victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nThe Clippers (43-19) have won eight of their last nine games. They also snapped a 10-game losing streak at Quicken Loans Arena dating back to March 10, 2002.\n\nThe Cavs (20-39) watched their modest two-game winning streak end.\n\n- - -\n\nBoston Celtics 94, Golden State Warriors 86\n\nPaul Pierce scored 26 points and grabbed eight rebounds and the Boston Celtics put the shackles on Stephen Curry, leading them to a 94-86 victory over the Golden State Warriors.\n\nReturning from their longest road trip of the season, the Celtics won their eighth straight home game and improved to 11-3 since Rajon Rondo was lost for the season to a knee injury.\n\nThe Warriors, who beat the Celtics in Oakland Dec. 29, lost for the ninth time in their last 12 games.

The Heat can match that record by beating their old rivals, the Knicks, in New York on Sunday.\n\nThe Grizzlies, meanwhile, had their eight-game win streak snapped. Had they won, the Grizzlies would have set a franchise record with nine in a row.\n\nDwyane Wade led the Heat with 22 points and eight assists.\n\nThe Heat's LeBron James, who had just four points after three quarters, finished with 18 points, eight rebounds and 10 assists.

He was helped off the court by teammates.\n\nA statement by the team announced that he sprained his left ankle.
