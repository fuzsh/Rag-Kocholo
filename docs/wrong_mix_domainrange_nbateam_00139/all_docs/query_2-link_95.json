        "text": "Carmelo Anthony has called it a career.\n\nThe former Knicks forward and future Hall of Famer — who last played with the Lakers in the 2021 season — announced his retirement at age 38 on Monday, following 19 NBA seasons.\n\nAnthony shared a video montage of career moments, writing “Thank you” on social media.\n\n“I remember the days when I had nothing just a ball on the court and a dream with something more,” Anthony said. “But basketball was my outlet. My purpose was strong. My communities, the cities I represented with pride and the fans that supported me along the way.\n\n“I am forever grateful for those people and places because they made me, Carmelo Anthony.\n\n“But now the time has come for me to say goodbye: to the court where I made my name, to the game that gave me purpose and pride.”\n\n“But this bittersweet goodbye to the NBA, I am excited for what the future holds for me. When people ask what I believe my legacy is, it’s not my feet on the court that comes to mind, nor the awards or praise, because my story has always been more than basketball.\n\nAnthony then passed the torch to his 16-year-old son Kiyan.\n\n“… My legacy now and forever lives on through you.”\n\nAnthony co-parents Kiyan with his ex-wife, actress La La Anthony, who filed for divorce last June.\n\nThe ex-couple, who remains good friends, had been separated for several years.\n\nDuring an appearance on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast in Oct. 2022, La La said the marriage started falling apart after Anthony was traded from the Nuggets to the Knicks in 2011.\n\nAnthony, who turns 39 next week, returned to MSG with his son for Game 2 of the Knicks’ Eastern Conference playoff series with the Heat earlier this month.\n\nThe New York legend received a warm welcome from the home crowd and stood up with his arms outstretched, thanking the fans for the love.\n\nThe Nuggets traded Anthony to the Knicks, along with Chauncey Billups, at the 2011 trade deadline for Wilson Chandler, Raymond Felton, Danilo Gallinari, Timofey Mozgov, a first-round pick and two second-round picks.\n\nSeven of his 10 All-Star selections, including the NBA’s scoring title (2013), came in the prime of his career with the Knicks from 2011-2017.\n\nAnthony averaged 24.7 points, seven rebounds and 2.3 assists during his Knicks tenure, while making the All-Star team each season.\n\nHis best campaign with New York came during the 2012-13 season when he averaged 28.7 points, 6.9 rebounds and 2.6 assists in 67 games — while shooting 44.9 percent from the floor and 37.9 percent from three-point-range.\n\nAnthony led the Knicks to the playoffs three times.\n\n“In the seven years he played for the Knicks, Melo gave The Garden crowd some unforgettable memories and garnered multiple All-Star and All-NBA selections,” the Knicks said in a statement. “He also led the way off the court with participation in countless community programs.”\n\nAnthony is ninth in NBA history with 28,289 career points — and was voted on the NBA’s 75th Anniversary Team.\n\nA three-time Olympic gold medalist, Anthony led the Nuggets to the Western Conference finals in the 2009 postseason.\n\nAnthony was selected out of Syracuse with the third overall pick by the Nuggets — after LeBron James (Cavaliers) and Darko Milicic (Pistons) — in the 2003 NBA Draft.\n\nHe finished his career with six All-NBA accolades across stints with the Knicks, OKC Thunder, Rockets Trail Blazers and Lakers."
