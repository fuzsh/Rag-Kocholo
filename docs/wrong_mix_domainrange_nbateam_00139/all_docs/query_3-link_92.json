        "text": "Rutgers continues to offer the best of the best — and keep up with the trend of pursuing players with great family history.\n\nOn Tuesday, four-star guard Kiyan Anthony shared that he received an offer from the Scarlet Knights. Anthony is the son of NBA great Carmelo Anthony, who starred at Syracuse leading the Orange to a National Championship during his freshman year.\n\nAnthony is currently ranked as the top player in New York, according to 247Sports. ESPN also has the 2025 guard ranked 41st in the nation overall.\n\nAnthony’s long list of offers now includes the Scarlet Knights. He also received offers from the likes of Syracuse, Ohio State, Florida State, Michigan, Tennessee, Memphis, and many more. According to ZagsBlog, Anthony is expected to cut his list down to five as early as next week.\n\nCarmelo Anthony was one of the best scorers in NBA history during his career and his son is following he trend. The 6-foot-5 guard is coming off a performance on Monday where he scored 40 points on 15-of-19 shooting at the Nike PIT in Augusta, GA. He is averaging 23.3 points in three games at this showcase and has hit 7-of-17 from three-point range.\n\nThe Long Island Lutheran standout will continue to be one of the most-coveted players in the Class of 2025. Rutgers is close to home for Anthony and while it is unknown if Steve Pikiell will land another big fish, it is clear he will keep throwing his hat in the ring."
