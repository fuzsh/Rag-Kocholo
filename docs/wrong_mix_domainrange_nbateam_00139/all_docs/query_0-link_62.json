        "text": "Despite a big second quarter from Carmelo Anthony, the New York Knicks lost a close game to the Wizards at Madison Square Garden, 113-110.\n\nWashington Wizards 113 (23-19)\n\nNew York Knicks 110 (19-25)\n\nNBA, Final, Box Score\n\nMadison Square Garden, New York City, New York\n\nThe New York Knicks won their first six games that were decided by four points or less. Thursday’s heartbreaking result was the Knicks seventh straight loss in the type of game. It’s no coincidence, their season began trending downward shortly after that last close win on Dec. 9, against Sacramento.\n\nThursday’s loss was different, though. New York just picked up their biggest win of the season on Wednesday in Boston and they were finally feeling good about themselves again. Kristaps Porzingis was back after a four-game absence due to injury. Even fans had a reason to show a tiny glint of optimism.\n\nSo, when Carmelo Anthony poured in 25 points in the second quarter (a Knicks franchise record) and led his team to a 40 point quarter the game seemed winnable. Like always we need to remember that no matter who is wearing the jersey these are still the Knicks.\n\nAfter a remarkable quarter, Anthony was just 2-12 in the second half with just 7 points. Porzingis only managed four field goal attempts in 18 second half minutes. It’s tempting to blame it all on Melo again, but how about that last shot?\n\nWell, the Knicks are calling for an investigation into a Wizards assistant coach. We thought we’d seen it all.\n\nThis game was there for the taking. Washington only made four shots in the fourth quarter (26.7 percent) and the Knicks couldn’t take advantage. Back to the drawing board for coach Hornacek."
