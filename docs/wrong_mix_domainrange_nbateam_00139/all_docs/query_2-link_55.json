        "text": "NBA training camps are getting underway and Carmelo Anthony still doesn’t have a team.\n\nOne league source said a potential deal with the Brooklyn Nets is “dead” and speculated that the Miami Heat or Los Angeles Clippers might be possible destinations.\n\n“I think he deserves to end up on a team,” Lance Thomas, Anthony’s former Knicks teammate, said Friday at Nets Media Day after signing with Brooklyn. “A guy of his caliber is someone who has always been a standup guy in the league. He’s given amazing basketball memories to the NBA, has affected almost every teammate he’s ever had in a positive way and always has a smile on his face. I think he does deserve to play on a team. I think it’s unfortunate what’s happening. But you’re not going to take the smile off his face even if you tried.”\n\nThomas, who has been playing pickup with Anthony, said he thinks everyone around the league is surprised that Anthony hasn’t found a new home.\n\n“I think the world is surprised,” he said. “I don’t know enough to speak on it. But I can speak on the character that Melo has, how hard he works, how great of a teammate he is. I think the world of him and I think that he does deserve a chance to lace them up again.”\n\nThomas said Anthony, 35, has looked good in scrimmages.\n\n“I think it’s the best his body looks,” he said. “He has the first step back. It looks like he’s having fun playing the game again. That’s all I really hope for him is that he’s happy playing the game and not worry about things he has no control over.”\n\nSyracuse coach Jim Boeheim concurred with Thomas’s analysis.\n\n“I just saw him and he looks great and really motivated to show he can still help a team,” Boeheim told me Friday.\n\nAnthony is a 10-time All-Star who has had a tough time over the last two seasons. He averaged a career-low 16.2 points in 78 starts in a tumultuous season for the Thunder two seasons ago before coming to Houston — and accepting a reserve role for the first time in his 16-year career.\n\nThe Rockets parted ways with Anthony in November and he played his final game with them on Nov. 8. Anthony played just 10 games for the Rockets after signing a one-year, $2.4 million deal during the offseason. He was waived by the Chicago Bulls on Feb. 1.\n\nChauncey Billups, who teamed with Anthony in Denver, thinks Anthony was too focused on scoring 30+ points per night.\n\n“I'll tell you what, it's so crazy – I feel bad for [Anthony], and here's why,\" Billups said on SiriusXM NBA Radio in Las Vegas at the Summer League.\n\n\"'Melo was like a good teammate, man. 'Melo practiced every day. He didn't miss any games. Now the only thing I will say – and I've even told 'Melo this – scoring 30 meant too much to 'Melo. \"It meant too much because he could have games where he had 20, 22 [points], we win the game and he's mad. He might have 36 and he's in there, you know, we lose the game and he's in there picking everybody up. Scoring 30 meant too much, but I think now you look, fast forward the tape, and the reason why he's not in the league because he's still worthy, is he hasn't mentally taken that step back to say, ‘OK, I'll come in and play against back-ups. I'll try to help the team out. I know I might not be able to close, but I just want to help.’ Well, he's not there yet.”\n\nThe third overall pick in the 2003 draft, Anthony has averaged 24 points, 6.5 rebounds and 3 assists in a career that also included stints with the Denver Nuggets and the New York Knicks.\n\nJalen Rose said in January he hopes Anthony plays again.\n\n\"He can still contribute, it's just finding the right opportunity is tough because unless there's a major injury, a contending team probably wouldn't add him,\" Rose told TMZSports then.\n\n\"Maybe an injury happens and he gets back in the league. But I hope so, I hope so. I don't want him to end after 10 games in Houston. He deserves better for somebody going to the Hall of Fame.\""
