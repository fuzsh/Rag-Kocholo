        "text": "Carmelo Anthony came into this season, like he had most seasons lately, believing that the Knicks would be headed to the playoffs, the pieces in place for him to rise among the stars leading contenders again.\n\nInstead, he spent the last two games guiding a starting lineup that included three rookies - two of them undrafted - as the Knicks were running out the string on the final games of another lost season.\n\nWhile Steph Curry is being joined by the return of injured Kevin Durant for the postseason and J.R. Smith has just returned to accompany LeBron James in Cleveland, Anthony was dropping the Knicks 49th game of the season with Marshall Plumlee making his first NBA start next to him.\n\nThis is how Anthony might be counting down his final days in New York, 32 years old, still clinging to what he believes is his prime, averaging 22.5 points per game. As the losses have piled up and the strange faces have turned up alongside him, he hasn’t turned selfish, his field goal attempts are below his career averages.\n\nInstead he has played mentor to a handful of marginal NBA players who might not be around next year - and he is almost certain not going to be back next year.\n\n“I think it’s just more kind of giving them insight on different situations in the game,” Anthony said after Thursday’s 106-103 loss to Washington. “I don’t remember exactly who I was talking to, what I was talking about. I know my message to those guys, when you’re learning the game it’s knowing different situations throughout the course of the game, there’s things that they’ll get used to.”\n\nAnthony was asked if there was anything he had learned this season to carry over into the next one, and he simply said, “Stay Melo,” staying on brand, but also accurate.\n\nThis season has not only been another disappointment in the standings for Anthony and the Knicks, but was a disaster off of it, too, with Knicks’ president Phil Jackson prodding the team’s star player until Anthony is finally ready to consider his departure.\n\nArmed with a five-year, $124.9 million deal that includes a no-trade clause, Anthony has long maintained that he had no intention of leaving after pushing for a trade to come to New York. But sources on both sides have indicated they believe Anthony will be dealt this summer if Jackson can find a suitable trading partner. But the chaos caused by Jackson may have been where this season went wrong.\n\n“This is Melo’s team,” said Brandon Jennings, who signed on with the Knicks last summer, but got his release and signed with the Wizards last month. “He’s a star. He had a lot of pressure on him dealing with stuff with Phil, the trade rumors, stuff like that. I think it was just a roller coaster, an emotional roller coaster for him this year with everything he had to deal with, which isn’t fair. For a player to wake up every day and you’re hearing trade rumors and you might be gone and this and that. so, it was cool. Melo, he’s cool.\n\n“That was one of the wildest situations I’ve ever seen. It was like a two-week span where everybody was hitting your phone … about Melo leaving. It definitely took a toll, I think on the team too, because it wasn’t even about basketball anymore. It was more about what was going on with Melo.”\n\nAnthony shrugged off most of it, accustomed by now to the chaotic nature of the Knicks. With three games left starting Friday night in Memphis, Anthony was unsure what games he would play as the other starters have fallen by the wayside, Joakim Noah suspended, Derrick Rose undergoing surgery and Kristaps Porzingis nursing back spasms. And he wasn’t sure what would come when it was over.\n\n“I don’t think about next year at this point,” Anthony said. “At this point it’s very hard to think about next year, what can carry over into next year. I think it can carry over into the offseason, what you can learn, things you see can carry into the offseason about what you want to work on and get better. As far as next season, no.”"
