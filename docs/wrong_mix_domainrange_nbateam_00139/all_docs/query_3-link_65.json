        "text": "“When I took the job you know it was a veteran laden team,” Billups said. “Melo [Anthony] was actually still on the roster. I really took the job thinking that I was going to be coaching him. You know with Dame [Lillard] and CJ [McCollum], Nurk [Nurkic]. So it was perfect for me, I’m thinking okay boom, a few moves here and there, I’m coming to like try to elevate things and then very quickly it changed.”\n\nDwyane Wade of course won three championships with the franchise over the course of his Hall of Fame career, but recently, he stopped by good friend Carmel0 Anthony’s 7PM In Brooklyn podcast to break down why the most enjoyable season of his career was actually the first. “My rookie year, there wasn’t any expectations,” said Wade, via 7pm In Brooklyn with Carmelo Anthony on YouTube. “We were just hooping, we were terrible. We started 0 – 7, we were terrible. So roll the ball out, let’s just go have fun, right. You’re making a name for yourself, you’re living your dream out for the first time, the road trips are new, going to these hotels was exciting. The first year for me was the funnest year I played in the NBA, then I got Shaq in my second year and it became business. Quickly, you got to win now, it changed everything for me. I didn’t get five years to be a young guy, I had to get right to it, right away. So my first year when it was Lamar Odom, Caron Butler, Brian Grant, Eddie Jones, and we made a run and being in the playoffs and all that, we were just out here having fun.”"
