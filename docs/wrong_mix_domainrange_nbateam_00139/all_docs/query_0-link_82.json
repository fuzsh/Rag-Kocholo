        "text": "Each team's projected most versatile 5 man lineup, their projected net rating per 100 possessions, and the lineups synergy rating.\n\nShort Story:\n\nRemove the least versatile defenders, unless they happen to be a superstar.\n\nRemove the horrible defenders, unless they happen to be a superstar.\n\nSpit out the four best defenders of the remaining PG's, SG's and SF's.\n\nSpit out the two most versatile defenders among the remaining PF's and Centers.\n\nSpit out the 5 best defenders among the remaining 6 players.\n\nThis weeds out the defenders who would likely be exposed in a playoff matchup as well as the least switchable players (think Trey Burke/Greg Monroe). The idea was to find the best/most versatile lineup for those tough playoff matchups.\n\n*Some teams may not have 5 players meet these qualification. These teams are usually garbage, or they have a position of great weakness and therefore did not have 5 players qualify.\n\nVersatility Rating comes from a project put together by both Krishna Narsu and Patrick Miller of Nylon Calculus. A quick, concise explanation of Versatility Rating (higher is better) can be found on the glossary page.\n\nYoung Core - players must be 26 or younger with a PeakWAR > 1 to qualify. Win Shares come from FiveThirtyEight's CARMELO Projections. Projections go out to 2025 and take each players peak projected season.\n\n* Estimated Win Total - This is a crude estimate based upon adding these players to a team with slightly below average talent (a 26 win team). We came to this number by taking an average team's minutes distribution, making their three highest minute players replacement level (using -2.5 plus minus as replacement level), and filling out the roster with a group of average (~ -.5 plus minus) players. We then ran this roster through a simulated NBA schedule 100 times, and came out with about 26 wins.\n\nThe idea being that the players from the Young Core replace the minutes played by the replacement level players from the 26 win team.\n\n*The Wins Above Replacement player projections come from our player projections, and update periodically throughout the season. While a player like Jayson Tatum is listed at a 9.1 peak WAR, this is what we consider his most likely outcome. It is just as possible that he goes over that 9.1 as he goes under.\n\nA crude estimation of a team's talent level as it relates to how they should be expected to perform with the current roster. Note that this does not take coaching or player synergy into account, but is strictly a look at the talent on the team. We have based this upon an article written by Seth Partnow for The Athletic where he examined ~10 years of team performance in terms of its relation to their talent level. Players are split up into tiers ranging from Franchise players at the top end to Bench players at the bottom end. A team's quality will thus depend on the mix of players it has in each of the various tiers.\n\nThe four tiers that teams will fall into are Title Contender, Playoff Lock, Playoff Probable, Play-In Range, and Lottery Bound."
