        "text": "The Washington Wizards have found their next general manager.\n\nLos Angeles Clippers general manager Michael Winger agreed to a deal to become the next president of Monumental Basketball on Wednesday afternoon, according to ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski. That makes Winger the Wizards’ next general manager, as well as the general manager for the WNBA’s Washington Mystics and the G League’s Capital City Go-Go.\n\nWinger was hired in Los Angeles in 2017 after front office stints with both the Cleveland Cavaliers and Oklahoma City Thunder. Under Winger and owner Steve Ballmer, the Clippers reached the Western Conference finals for the first time in team history in 2021 after hiring coach Ty Lue to replace Doc Rivers.\n\nWinger will replace Tommy Sheppard in Washington, who was fired in April after spending two decades with the organization. Sheppard first joined the front office in 2003. He was promoted to senior vice president of basketball operations in 2013, and then to general manager in 2019.\n\nIn Sheppard’s four seasons as the team’s general manager, the Wizards reached the postseason just once and didn’t have a winning season. They went 35-47 this season under coach Wes Unseld Jr., who is expected to return next fall for a third season. He replaced Scott Brooks in 2021, and holds a 70-94 record in his first head-coaching job in the league.\n\nWith Winger’s departure to the East Coast, the Clippers are now the lone franchise in the NBA that currently has an open general manager position."
