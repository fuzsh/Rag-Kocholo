        "text": "It’s Game 2 of the 2009 Western Conference Finals, and the Denver Nuggets are down 1–0 to the top-seeded Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nLA has already built a double-digit lead early in the second quarter. As things are starting to unravel in a hurry for Denver, Coach George Karl is forced to call a timeout to stop the bleeding.\n\nBut then, coming off the break Carmelo Anthony catches fire.\n\nIt starts off with one of his signature pull-up jumpers from 18-feet. The next possession, he takes and makes another one, and then another. All of a sudden Melo scores 14 straight points for the Nuggets, keeping his team in the game almost by himself as they closed the half down by only one.\n\nAnthony ended the game with 34 points — his fifth consecutive playoff game with at least 30. But more importantly his Nuggets evened the series at 1–1, stealing home court advantage away from the heavily-favored Lakers."
