Last Saturday, he was even on the inactive list.\n\n\"I was very surprised. It was shocking. I wasn't used to seeing DNPs and my first inactive,\" said Young. \"It kind of hurt.\"\n\nAfter dealing with the emotions, Young picked himself up.\n\n\"Just man up, really,\" he told himself. \"Go out there with that chip on your shoulder. Just believe, really. I still have confidence in my game if I play or not.\"\n\nWith Mike Miller out due to injury, Young has gotten more playing time over the last week and has thrived.\n\nOn Tuesday against the 76ers, he scored 20 points on 8-for-16 shooting.\n\n\"He wears his emotions on his sleeve,\" forward Caron Butler said. \"And for him to go out there and compete the way he did on both ends of the floor... that was special.\"\n\nThe Warriors had just six healthy players on Tuesday night, but they were still able to shock the Mavericks on the road.\n\n- Washington 108, Philadelphia 107\n\nTeam FIC Differential: Wizards +2.6, 76ers -2.6\n\nThe Washington Wizards (4-9) held off the Philadelphia 76ers (5-9) for a much needed win on Tuesday night.

Fourteen do. ... At the end of the day, if 15 players don't want to go and it's only 14, you've seen 'Remember the Titans.' It's the same thing. We've just got to play.\"\n\nWhen asked who was responsible for ending the in-fighting, Arenas said, \"Me and Antawn [Jamison]. That's our jobs [as captains].\"\n\nHe conveniently left Butler, the third co-captain, out.\n\nButler wasn't as direct as Arenas and said that a few wins might cure everything in Washington.\n\n\"A lot of things get magnified when you're losing. Everybody wants to be successful, but you've got to stay in the team concept and just focus on playing winning basketball,\" Butler said. \"Honestly, I have never had a problem with nobody on the team. It's frustrating when you're losing games, but when you're frustrated, do you point the finger? Do you blame other people? Or do you try to get better and see 'What can I do?' That's where maturity comes in.\"\n\nThe two reportedly spoke on Monday night and resolved their issues.\n\nWizards center Brendan Haywood is having a career-season.\n\nHe's averaging 10.9 points, 10.8 rebounds and 2.5 blocks in 33.8 minutes per game.\n\nAll the numbers set or tie career marks.\n\n\"That's big because it helps me from a mental aspect,\" Haywood said of his consistent minutes. \"If I go out there and I know I'm going to play 30 minutes, it gives you confidence, because you feel your coach has confidence in you. You don't have to go out there pressing.\"\n\n\"Not trying to speak negatively about anyone, but in previous years, I was playing like I had to make something happen. If it didn't happen in the first five minutes I felt like I had to do something or I might not play in the second half. That's a tough way to play. Now, it's a little bit different. I think [club] Flip [Saunders] has confidence in me and I benefit from it.\"\n\nHaywood added that former Washington coach Eddie Jordan tried unsuccessfully to put him against former teammate Etan Thomas.\n\n\"Eddie tried to motivate us both by putting us against each other. I don't think it worked for either guy,\" Haywood said. \"We ended up splitting minutes and fighting every day in practice. It was a bad strategy for the team and it was bad for both of us.\"\n\nTwenty-four of the league's 30 teams with in action on Wednesday night.\n\n- Atlanta 105, Miami 90\n\nTeam FIC Differential: Hawks +24.8, Heat -24.8\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks (10-2) continued their hot start with a win over the Miami Heat (7-4).
