        "text": "Almost certainly destined for the Hall of Fame, the former Knicks star who became a Lakers role player has called time on his NBA career and it’s safe to say he’s given us a few things to remember. From his 2013 scoring title to his inclusion on the NBA’s 75th Anniversary Team, Carmelo Anthony established himself as one of the greats of the modern game.\n\nCarmelo Anthony announces retirement\n\n“Now, the time has come for me to say goodbye - to the court where I made my name, to the game that gave me purpose and pride. ...With this bittersweet goodbye to the NBA, I am excited about what the future holds for me.” Those were the words spoken by Carmelo Anthony when he announced his retirement in a video which he posted to social media. Known to most as “Melo,” the Syracuse product led his school to a national championship in 2003 and was named the Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four for his trouble. Of course, Anthony would truly begin to showcase his prowess once he arrived in the NBA, something which led to his selection by USA Basketball for the Olympics on four different occasions - a record to this day.\n\nWhat was Carmelo Anthony’s Olympic performance like?\n\nAs mentioned above, Anthony participated in four Olympics for the USA’s men’s basketball team. Firstly in Athens in 2004, then Beijing in 2008, followed by London for the 2012 games and lastly in Rio at the 2016 tournament. With the exception of the games in Greece in which Team USA took home the bronze, Anthony has only ever won gold when playing for his country. Anthony’s 37 points against Nigeria in the 2012 games is a USA Basketball men’s record at an Olympics. Indeed, so too are his 10 3-pointers from that same game and his 13-for-13 effort from the free throw line against Argentina in 2008. Incidentally, Anthony will still be a key part of the Team USA’s set up for a few more months. As one of the ambassadors for the upcoming Basketball World Cup, he will be in the Philippines, Japan and Indonesia this summer.\n\nFrom father to son"
