On this day in Boston Celtics history, former Boston big man Rasheed Wallace signed with the team on a multi-season deal his body didn’t let him finish. Wallace, a native of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, played his college ball at the University of North Carolina, from which he was drafted by the (then) Washington Bullets (now, Wizards) with the fourth overall pick of the 1995 NBA draft.

Wallace would make the All-Rookie team with the Bullets, and then play stints with the Portland Trail Blazers, Atlanta Hawks, and Detroit Pistons (with whom he would win a title in 2004) before joining the Celtics, making All-Star teams in four of those seasons.

‘Sheed (as he was often called) played just one season for the Celtics, his numbers hobbled by minor injuries.
