BOSTON — The Boston Celtics have offered forward Rasheed Wallace a contract as part of a major push to land the coveted forward, according to a published report on Friday.

The Boston Globe reports the Celtics offered Wallace a deal during a three-hour meeting in Detroit on Thursday. Celtics stars Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen and Paul Pierce joined general manager Danny Ainge and managing partner Wyc Grousbeck at the meeting.

Wallace’s agent, Bill Strickland, told the Globe in a text message that it was a "very good meeting; some contractual terms discussed, nothing agreed to."

He also said Wallace will be meeting with other teams next week. Charlotte, Cleveland, Orlando and San Antonio are said to be possible suitors.

The 35-year-old Wallace can play the low post and also has exceptional shooting range. He averaged 12 points per game for Detroit last year, before falling to 6.5 points per game in the first round of the playoffs as Detroit was swept in four games by Cleveland.

Wallace earned US$13.68 million last season as he finished up a five-year contract with Detroit. Teams pursuing Wallace now would be offering the mid-level exception, worth between $5.6 million and $5.8 million.

Wallace, a starter most of his career, would likely play a complementary role in Boston. The Celtics are hoping they can lure him by offering a shot at a title. Wallace is also close to Garnett.
