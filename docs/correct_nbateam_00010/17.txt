Long before Rasheed Wallace joined the Boston Celtics, he was battling his former Detroit Pistons big man teammate Ben Wallace (no relation) on the boards as Wallace’s new team, the Chicago Bulls, went at it with his old ball club in the 2007 Eastern Conference semifinals.

Wallace and his namesake had been close friends and teammates before Ben’s departure to the Bulls, adding a little extra sauce to the matchup given there were no hard feelings about Big Ben’s exit from the Pistons. Sheed gave a detailed account of that playoff series vs. his old friend and teammate in a segment from his “That’s What Sheed Said” Underdog NBA podcast.

Take a look at the clip embedded below to get a window into Wallace’s career before he suited up with the Celtics a few seasons later.
