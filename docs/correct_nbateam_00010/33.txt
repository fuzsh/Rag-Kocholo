The two-month Rasheed Wallace drama of will-he, won't-he retire, complete with even Shaquille O'Neal offering his own reporting, came to a close Tuesday night: the Celtics announced they waived the 15-year NBA veteran, with 'Sheed expected to retire.

The Boston Celtics announced today that they have waived forward/center Rasheed Wallace after coming to a mutual agreement following which Wallace plans to retire.

"We would like to thank Rasheed for everything that he did for this team and organization last season," said Danny Ainge, Celtics President of Basketball Operations. "We would like to wish Rasheed and his family the best as they move on into the next phase of their lives. He will always be a member of the Celtics family."

Wallace, drafted with the No. 4 overall pick in 1995, won an NBA Championship in 2004 with the Pistons.
