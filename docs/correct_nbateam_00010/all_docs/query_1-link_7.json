        "text": "Even before he joined the Boston Celtics, veteran big man Rasheed Wallace had made a name for himself as one of the NBA’s most vocal players when contesting calls with referees. So much so, he often led the league in technical fouls.\n\nSo it should not surprise anyone who knows the history of his game to learn about the most famous interjections Wallace deployed against refs when he believed a call that went against him or his teammates was an especially bad call, and where it came from. Sheed, as he was often called for short, yelled “Ball don’t lie!” with gusto any time such a sequence played out.\n\nWhere did it come from, and what did it mean? The veteran forward explained it in a recent clip put together by the folks at the Showtime Basketball YouTube channel.\n\nListen to the “Celtics Lab” podcast on:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3zBKQY6\n\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3GfUPFi\n\nRelated\n\nCeltics champ Cedric Maxwell opens up about the hardest player he ever guarded\n\nBest of Boston Celtics legend Larry Bird's passing and assists: Part III\n\nBoston Celtics forward Grant Williams meets Atlético Madrid forward Antoine Griezmann\n\nBoston Celtics voted as having best offseason in NBA by ESPN panel\n\nHow much does the loss of veteran forward Danilo Gallinari impact the Boston Celtics?\n\nCeltics Lab 138: Where are they now?
