        "text": "Rasheed Wallace, who played for Doc Rivers on the Celtics in the 2009-10 season, shared some of his thoughts on Rivers on his YouTube show \"That's What Sheed Said.\"\n\n\"You gotta get somebody in there that the players respect,\" Wallace said.\n\n\"He doesn't make adjustments. That's just from being in the locker room with him for that one season. That seems to always be his biggest knock,\" he noted. \"When you are in the trenches, and you are going against another team and another good coach, you've gotta be more than a locker room manager.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nAccording to Wallace, it was more on the players to make their own adjustments on teams coached by Rivers.\n\nIndeed, the Sixers struggled to make adjustments in their series against the Celtics. After heading into halftime of Game 7 trailing by just three points, they Sixers got trounced by Boston in the third quarter, with the Celtics opening up a 30 point lead.\n\nTwo times during that run, Rivers attempted to stem the bleeding with a timeout, but Philadelphia was never able to turn things around.\n\nFor Rivers, falling short in the second round of the playoffs is not exactly new.\n\nRivers has now lost nine straight games when he's had the chance to punch his ticket to the conference finals with a win, and he's lost 10 Game 7s in his career, more than any other head coach in NBA history.\n\nOn one hand, that stat is exemplary of a long career. On the other, that's a lot of losses in do-or-die games."
