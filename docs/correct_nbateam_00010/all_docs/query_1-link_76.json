        "text": "The two of them failed to live up to expectations during the Boston Celtics’ regular season.\n\nVeteran Rasheed Wallace, signed as a free agent last summer, did not average double figures in scoring for the first time in his career and shot just 28 percent from 3-point range.\n\nGlen Davis, who put together a strong postseason last spring, suffered a broken right thumb during a fight with a friend less than 48 hours before the Celtics’ season opener in October, then had his numbers decrease.\n\nTonight, when the Celtics face the Miami Heat in Game 2 of an opening-round playoff series at the TD Garden, Wallace and Davis will be asked to provide extra help.\n\nIt will be the 35-year-old Wallace and the 24-year-old Davis who will be filling the void caused by a one-game suspension issued to Kevin Garnett by the NBA by elbowing Miami’s Quentin Richardson.\n\nCoach Doc Rivers would not reveal whether Wallace or Davis would be in the starting lineup for Game 2 (8:05, TV: Comcast SportsNet and TNT; radio: WEEI-850 AM).\n\nDavis was working with the first unit in the short time that practice was open to the media on Monday afternoon, and point guard Rajon Rondo said he thought it would be Davis starting.\n\nWhichever one gets the assignment, he will have to deal with Heat forward Michael Beasley, who had only six points in 32 minutes in the series opener against Garnett on Saturday night.\n\n“They’re completely different players,’’ said Rivers of Wallace and Davis. “Rasheed gives us more size and he gives us a better post player. He spreads the floor.\n\n“Baby gives you energy. He moves his feet a little bit better on the Beasley matchup. They’re just so completely different. That’s what makes the decision so difficult. It’d be easy if they were similar, but they’re not.”\n\nWallace started in Garnett’s place when the Celtics edged the Heat, 112-106, in overtime on Jan. 6 and had one of his better games, getting 16 points and nine rebounds.\n\n“Rasheed was terrific in that game,” said Rivers. “We have played them one time without Kevin and we did well. That gives us a little bit of confidence, but it’s a whole different game obviously now, so we have to be ready.\n\n“Defensive energy (from Garnett will be missing). Kevin also facilitates a lot of offense. In the first game, a lot of our open shots came off Kevin being involved in the play. That’s my biggest concern.\n\n“You’ve losing 15 points and more importantly you’re losing all the picks, all the postups where they had to trap. That’s big. We’re going to have to try to find some points somewhere.”\n\nDavis averaged 15.8 points and 5.6 rebounds while taking Garnett’s place in 14 playoff games a year ago, and he’s ready to accept the challenge again. In the series opener last weekend, Davis, who calls himself the “Ticket Stub” as opposed to Garnett being the “Big Tickett,” helped key a comeback from a 14-point deficit by getting eight points and seven rebounds in the fourth quarter.\n\n“You guys know about me and what I bring to the table as a player,” Davis told reporters. “You’ve seen me play crucial moments for this team.”\n\n“I’m comfortable (in the playoffs). But in the last game in the first half, it didn’t show. I was nervous. I was fumbling balls. But in the second half, I got into the flow of things and kind of remembered what it felt like.”\n\nWallace, who has drawn the ire of Celtics’ fans for his misfiring from 3-point range and a lack of defense, had four points and one rebound in 14 minutes in the opener, but he was on the court during the second-half turnaround.\n\n“I don’t care if I start or I don’t care if Doc brings me off the bench,” said Wallace. “Like I said before, earlier in the year, he’s the mad scientist, so it’s the right formula that he sees out there on the floor. If he sees me starting, fine. If he doesn’t see me starting, fine.\n\n“It’s a lot on me because I know I’m going to have to go in there in Kevin’s role, set picks for Rondo and Ray (Allen) and Paul (Pierce), look for the high-low with (Kendrick Perkins). I’m not going to step outside of my game.”\n\nWallace will have to deal with Beasley, who has a quickness advantage that would be a problem.\n\n“He’s a younger guys, quicker, a little bit more athletic,” said Wallace. “I just have that wily, veteran craftsmanship right now. I just have to play my game, play him as best as I can.”"
