Due to his injury, he will not be available to play for us during the playoffs.\"\n\nWallace played one season with the Celtics, inspiring a 4,000-word rant from Bill Simmons by chucking up lazy 3-pointers, rebounding relatively little and declining to play much help defense. Legend has it that the center increased his output during the playoffs, but, despite starting Game 7 of the NBA Finals (he scored 11 points with eight rebounds) and producing a couple high-scoring games throughout the 2010 postseason, any improvement was minor. He originally retired after the NBA Finals that year.\n\nYet let me stop pouring cold water on Wallace, whose career is something we all probably enjoyed at one time or another. Even if we admit that he never quite reached his potential, sports aren't just about who scores the most points or lusts after dominance. Sometimes the most interesting parts of following sports are the realizations that a professional basketball player plays hoops in Air Force Ones, wears sweatpants to practice with the pockets hanging out, immortalized the phrases \"ball don't lie\" and \"both teams played hard,\" and often loses his temper while speaking to referees.\n\nHead coach Doc Rivers was asked recently whether Wallace playing in the playoffs would get the Celtics a couple points per game in technical fouls.\n\n\"I'm hoping,\" Rivers responded.\n\nHope no more. If retirement don't lie this time, Rasheed, it's been real.\n\nThe Knicks, meanwhile -- perhaps in an attempt to cut off any \"they should use their open roster spot on Charlie Ward\" jokes -- have signed Earl Barron."
