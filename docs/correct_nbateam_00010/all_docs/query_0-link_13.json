        "text": "In the summer of 2007 when the Celtics acquired Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett. We were susceptible about how this would turn out. After all Ray Garnett and Peirce were frustrated superstars with their respective franchises. Seattle at that time were just plain terrible as was the Celtics and Timberwolves.\n\nWhen they somehow landed on the Celtics squad, I wondered how three great players would play on one team. There would be, I presumed, a lot of selfish play and one player that would want all the glory.\n\nBut, to my surprise, they did very well and manged to win a title in 2008 despite their superstars nearing the twilight of their careers.\n\nFast-forward to 2009 in which they failed because of a knee injury to Garnett and Ray Allen's inconsistancies in the Celtics-Magic series. The \"big three\" was getting older and older by the day but they still have Garnett their leader and a great locker room guy.\n\nThe Celtics recently got Rasheed Wallace.\n\nFirst off, Rasheed was awful in the Cavaliers series, only averaging a mediocre 6 points per game and at 34 he was going to make the Celtics look like a team on its last legs. Not to mention you're bringing in a hot tempered player who can be a menace in the locker room.\n\nIf sheed wants to start that would limit Kendrick Perkin's minutes and i don't think he would be to happy with that. After all i really think Perkin's is an underrated center in this league. He single-handedly kept Dwight Howard under 16 points a game in the Celtics-Magic series A defense powerhouse such as Perkins should consider it a disgrace to not start.\n\nIf Sheed was asked to come off the bench as perhaps a sixth man,seems like a good role. However for a Unique talent like Wallace, He should be in the starting line up as well. Although sometimes you have to accept that your getting older and you might not play alot of minutes. This might ruin the great chemistry of the Celtics if they can't find a good role for Wallace.\n\nA lot of people say Garnett can handle him like Phil is going to handle Ron Artest. We will have to see. I suppose the C's got 'Sheed because he play center and shoot the three ball well, a rare combo in the NBA these days, but I would rather have seen them get Antonio McDyess"
