        "text": "It’s not like Rasheed Wallace hasn’t had a ton of fun before. Six years and a championship with the formidable Detroit Pistons has a way of making the game pretty darned enjoyable. But when Wallace stepped onto the Celtics basketball court Wednesday night, he ended up rolling in the aisles like most of the fans.\n\nLong before the Celts annihilated the visiting Charlotte Bobcats, 92-59, Wallace got a taste of a local tradition that wasn’t seen nearly enough last season. As the Celtics waited out a timeout with 5:43 remaining in the fourth quarter, Kevin Garnett stood next to Wallace and pointed to the jumbo video screen high above courtside. He was pointing out the Gino guy dancing his 70’s dance, along with a number of other dancers in that old American Bandstand style.\n\n“Yeah, it was something I saw last year when I was with the Pistons,” Wallace said. “He (Garnett) was telling me about the Gino thing, how fans here go crazy or whatever.” Told that it was a victory cigar type of display, Wallace said, “Oh OK, I didn’t know that. It’s all right. It’s an in-house thing. It’s cool.”\n\nIt wasn’t nearly as cool, though, as the tons of fun the Celtics had in limiting the Bobcats to 10 points on 3-for-17 shooting in the third quarter. Having started the first quarter with an 8-0 run, only to let it slide later in the half, the Celtics stepped on the Cats in the third and never let up, beginning with a 15-0 run. The beauty of it was that a second unit of Wallace, Marquis Daniels, Eddie House and a surprisingly sharp Shelden Williams (12 points, nine rebounds) picked up where the starters left off and never let up.\n\n“That was huge,” said Wallace, who was 3-for-8 – he only took 3-pointers – from the floor, “because that would have just superseded all the hard work that the first five did, especially coming out the beginning of that third quarter playing the way we did. If we had went out there and blew the whole lead or let them cut it to 12 or 10 or something like that, that would have looked bad on all of us, especially the second unit, so we didn’t want to look bad ourselves so we had to go out there and keep it up.”\n\nThis is nothing new for Wallace, who has a way of coming off the bench and providing a spark. The beauty of it this time around is that he seems to have fit in perfectly with the Celtics. He and Kendrick Perkins have hit it off. He and Garnett have hit it off. It’s just working.\n\n“I’ve been around so long and was cool with a lot of the guys before I came here and know what type of people that they are from playing against them,” he said. “As far as personalities gelling, that was never an issue from Day One.”\n\nThe fact that he has a high-powered personality himself hasn’t hurt the transition.\n\n“It’s a half-and-half thing. Those are good guys. Nobody here is Hollywood. Everyone’s down to earth and that’s how it is.”\n\nWallace has now played two games for the Celtics, and while the team has beaten the Cavs at Cleveland and wiped out a lesser team in the Bobcats, he’s veteran enough to know that it’s early. He also knows this team is well schooled in what it needs to do, witness that third quarter. It’s to the point where they’ve already meshed.\n\n“We were just playing,” he said. “The first unit started it off at the beginning of the quarter. Just out there playing. It’s not like we said, ‘OK, we’re only gonna let them hit three shots’ or whatever. We were just playing, bottom line.”\n\nHis teammates have already learned to appreciate it. “He has such an impact on the defensive end,” Paul Pierce said of Wallace. “That’s where his value is. It’s also the way he spreads the floor. When he’s on the floor, especially with Kevin, the driving lanes open. He’s the total package.”\n\nIn more ways than one. Garnett knew Wallace would appreciate the Gino dancer, for instance. “I was breaking it down,” he said of his fourth-quarter explanation to his teammate. “Sheed is a throwback. We have similarities with music. We enjoy 70’s stuff, the Dick Clark days. So I was explaining what was going on. I explained the whole Gino thing.”\n\nIt wasn’t lost on Wallace. Nor was the entire night, the pre-game reception when the announcer was drowned out by “Sheeeeeeed” cheers, just the whole atmosphere.\n\n“I didn't feel it, I heard it,” he said. “It was cool. I felt like I was welcomed with open arms by the fans. That was the big thing. They (teammates) just said it was gonna be hyped. Guys were talking on the plane last night about it, ‘the fans gonna be crazy’ and this and that. And you felt it when … ‘and now the starting lineup of the Boston Celtics’ and all that. That was a good feeling. It’s always a good feeling.”"
