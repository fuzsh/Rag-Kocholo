        "text": "Two wins away from the NBA championship, the Boston Celtics have a potential problem hanging over their heads.\n\nRasheed Wallace has joined Kendrick Perkins atop the postseason leader board with six technical fouls, leaving them both just one away from an automatic one-game suspension.\n\nIt is hardly the kind of predicament the Celtics need to be dealing with in the NBA Finals that is even, 2-2, heading into Sunday night’s Game 5 against the Los Angeles Lakers at the TD Garden.\n\nWallace picked up his sixth technical of the playoffs during the fourth quarter of Game 4 on Thursday night when he argued a call made by referee Scott Foster.\n\nPerkins actually reached the seven-technical limit during Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals against the Orlando Magic, but the league rescinded one of two techs he was hit with in that game.\n\nDuring a press conference early Friday afternoon at the TD Garden, Lakers coach Phil Jackson asked if his team could increase the possibility of Wallace and Perkins receiving another technical.\n\n“That’s not fair play,’’ said Jackson. “That’s not the way to play games. You can be provocative and get out there and act kind of like they do if you want to and get in people’s faces and do that, but that’s not the way I like to coach a team\n\n“That’s not what I consider positive coaching, and that’s what I like to think is the right way to do things.’’\n\nIf Wallace or Perkins are hit with technicals on Sunday night, they would have to sit out Game 6 on Tuesday night in Los Angeles. A technical in Game 6 would result in a suspension for a possible Game 7 next Thursday.\n\nWallace, who has piled up technical fouls throughout his career and had 14 this season, has two techincals in the Finals after getting two in the series with the Magic and one each against the Miami Heat and the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nPerkins, who had 15 in the regular season to lead the league, had one against the Heat, three against the Cavaliers and one against the Magic.\n\nHe has not been issued one in the Finals, but Coach Doc Rivers took Perkins out of Game 4 when he was tangling with Pau Gasol, fearful that a double technical might be called.\n\n“Gasol and Perk kept going back and forth,’’ said Rivers, “and that was actually one of the reasons I said we’ve got to get him out because you could see it, the double technical, it was about to come.’’\n\nLosing either Perkins or Wallace at this stage would be costly for the Celtics, meaning they must be on their best behavior the rest of the way.\n\n“Listen, we’ve put ourselves in this situation,’’ said Rivers, “and we’re going to have to play ourselves out of it.’’\n\nFoul shooting: Rajon Rondo was an improved free-throw shooter earlier in the playoffs, making 71 percent in the opening two rounds.\n\nSince then, however, the Celtics point guard has struggled like he did during the first half of the regular season.\n\nRondo was 19-for-33 from the line against the Orlando Magic and is 4-for-15 against the Lakers.\n\n“We’re going to work on it,’’ said Rivers.\n\n“He knows what he’s not doing, we know what he’s not doing. There’s certain things he has to do. (The first two misses in Game 4) he fell away, his elbow was out. Then the confidence part has to come back.\n\n“I will say this: I was really proud of him because I thought in Game 3 when he missed a couple, he stopped driving, and that’s what happens when you miss free throws and then you don’t want to get fouled any more. I thought (in Game 4) he kept taking it to the basket, and for me, that was huge. That’s a good sign for him.’’\n\nEye on the future: Rivers was asked if the Celtics, with only six players under contract next season, might be looking at one last run this season.\n\n“We don’t talk about it at all, and I don’t think this is (the end) any way,’’ said Rivers. “I’ve said that, I said it in the middle of the year. I think, hopefully, we sign Ray (Allen). I think I can say that. If not, I just got fined.\n\n“I think Kevin (Garnett) is going to be better next year because of a year away from surgery.\n\n“I thought that during the middle of the year. So we don’t think that. I think everyone outside of us, a lot of people do.’’"
