        "text": "BOSTON (AP) — The Boston Celtics have signed veteran forward Rasheed Wallace, one of this year's most coveted free agents.\n\nBoston announced the move Wednesday, the first day teams were allowed to sign free agents.\n\nTerms of the deal were not released. Wallace earned $13.68 million last season as he finished up a five-year contract with Detroit.\n\nThe 35-year-old Wallace, a four-time All-Star, can play the low post and has exceptional shooting range. He averaged 12 points per game for the Pistons last year.\n\nCeltics general manager Danny Ainge said the team was \"ecstatic\" to add a player with Wallace's talent and championship experience. He won a title with Detroit in 2004."
