        "text": "BOSTON -- The Boston Celtics' hard pursuit of free agent Rasheed Wallace has come to quick fruition: The Celtics signed the veteran NBA forward, one of this year's most coveted free agents.\n\nBoston announced the move Wednesday, the first day teams were allowed to sign free agents.\n\nTerms of the deal were not released. Wallace earned $13.68 million last season as he finished up a five-year contract with Detroit.\n\nThe 35-year-old Wallace, a four-time All-Star, can play the low post and has exceptional shooting range. He averaged 12 points per game for the Pistons last year.\n\n\"We are ecstatic to be able to add a player the caliber of Rasheed Wallace to our team,\" said Celtics President of Basketball Operations, Danny Ainge. \"It is not every day that you can add a four-time All-Star and a player with championship experience.\"\n\nWallace won an NBA title with Detroit in 2004.\n\nWallace, a 6-foot-11, 230-pound center/forward, has averaged 15.0 points, 6.9 rebounds and 1.3 blocks in 33.9 minutes per game over his 14-year career. The former University of North Carolina Tar Heel has recorded 14 straight seasons of averaging 10 or more points, a tie for second most among active players along with new teammate Kevin Garnett and behind only Shaquille O'Neal.\n\nWallace is one of 13 players in NBA history to make 13 consecutive appearances in the playoffs along with the likes of Celtics greats Kevin McHale, Bob Cousy, Robert Parish and Bill Russell. Wallace also is one of only three players in NBA history to have recorded 150 three-point field goals, 150 blocks and 100 steals in his postseason career, joining Scottie Pippen and Robert Horry.\n\nThe fourth overall pick in the 1995 NBA Draft has made four All-Star teams in his career (2000, 2001, 2006, 2008). Wallace has made two trips to the NBA Finals with the Detroit Pistons (2003-04 and 2004-05 seasons) winning the NBA Championship in the 2003-04 season. Wallace joins Shaquille O'Neal, Kevin Garnett and Tim Duncan as the only four active players that have posted 15,000 points, 5,000 rebounds, 1,500 assists and 1,000 blocks in their careers.\n\nMORE CELTICS:\n\nÂ» July 3: Report: Rasheed Wallace agent Bill Strickland thinks Boston Celtics would be a good fit"
