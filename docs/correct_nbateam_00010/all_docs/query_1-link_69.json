        "text": "The New York Knicks have signed forward Rasheed Wallace, a four-time All-Star who is ending a two-year retirement.\n\nThe 38-year-old Wallace last played for the Boston Celtics in the 2009-10 season. Terms of his contract signed today were not announced.\n\nWallace averaged 14.6 points and 6.7 rebounds in 15 seasons. The temperamental 6-foot-11 Wallace frequently clashed with referees but was a respected teammate and versatile player who helped the Detroit Pistons win the 2004 NBA title. Knicks coach Mike Woodson was an assistant on that team."
