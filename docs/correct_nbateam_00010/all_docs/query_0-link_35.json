The four-time All-Star and 14-year vet, agreed to a three-year-deal that will pay him $5.8 million next season. The Celtics hope that teaming Wallace with Kevin Garnett (a close friend of his), Paul Pierce and Ray Allen will help them return to the NBA Finals. It now seems highly unlikely that Glen “Big Baby” Davis will be returning to Boston next season."
