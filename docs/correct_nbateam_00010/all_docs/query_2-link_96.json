        "text": "The Boston Celtics could not offer him a starting job or anything but the mid-level salary exception of less than $6 million.\n\nWhat Rasheed Wallace could obtain from the Celtics was a chance to contend for another championship in the waning days of his NBA career.\n\nWallace, a free agent who turns 35 in September, agreed to a two-year contract on Sunday to become the centerpiece of the Celtics' bench.\n\nThe deal will be signed on Wednesday when free agents can finalize agreements and will be for the mid-level exception, which is expected to be about $5.8 million annually.\n\nWallace will serve as a backup to forward Kevin Garnett and center Kendrick Perkins after being a starter the majority of his career, which began in 1995 with the Washington Bullets.\n\nOther contenders, such as the San Antonio Spurs and Orlando Magic, were said to be interested in Wallace, but he settled on the Celtics five days into the free-agent process.\n\nThe Celtics, who lacked depth in the frontcourt last season, sent Garnett, Ray Allen, Paul Pierce, Coach Doc Rivers, executive director of basketball operations Danny Ainge and owner Wyc Grousbeck to Wallace's house in Michigan last Thursday.\n\nThe group met with Wallace, his wife, and his agent, Bill Strickland, for three hours. That personal touch displayed by the Celtics helped direct Wallace, who won a title with the Detroit Pistons, to Boston.\n\nAfter making $13.9 million in his final year with the Pistons, Wallace will be playing at a reduced salary and in a new role. Wallace, who has averaged 15 points and 6.9 rebounds in his career, has started all but 67 of his 1,009 regular-season games.\n\nWallace has been a controversial figure throughout his career, piling up technical fouls and drawing numerous fines from the NBA.\n\nHe fills a glaring need for the Celtics, giving them size up front, and Wallace is an accurate long-range shooter who can help Boston's defense as well.\n\nWhen Garnett and Leon Powe were sidelined with injuries this past spring, Rivers turned to Brian Scalabrine as his first big man off the bench with the ineffective Mikki Moore behind him.\n\nThe addition of Wallace changes the look of the Celtics' bench, giving them a reliable sixth man, just like they had in the 2007-08 championship season with James Posey.\n\nThe acquisition of Wallace comes during an already hectic offseason for contenders in which the Magic traded for Vince Carter, the Cleveland Cavaliers dealt for Shaquille O'Neal, the Los Angeles Lakers picked up Ron Artest and the Spurs landed Richard Jefferson.\n\nThe Celtics' management team, which is in Florida for today's start of the Orlando Summer League, would like to further bolster the bench.\n\nThere have been reports that the Celtics have Grant Hill in their sights, hoping to give them a veteran wing player to spell Pierce. Hill played for Rivers in Orlando, where both currently reside.\n\nThe Celtics are also hoping to keep restricted free agent Glen Davis, who is being courted by several teams. Boston can match any offer Davis receives, though it is unlikely the Celtics will pay him $5 million per season.\n\n(Jim Fenton writes for the Brockton Enterprise of Gatehouse News Service.)"
