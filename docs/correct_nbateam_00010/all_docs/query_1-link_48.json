        "text": "Toward the end of the second quarter of Detroit's summer league game against Boston, I heard a sound from the Pistons' bench that I assumed was forever gone. It was a simple phrase, spoken loudly by a familiar voice, and it hit me like a weak shot swatted into the stands. Ladies, gentlemen, and referees: \"Ball Don't Lie!\"\n\nRasheed Wallace was back. I wasn't prepared for this, and while I had carefully studied the rumors of his return, I didn't expect them to bear fruit until training camp. Yet there he was. Rasheed Wallace, as animated as ever, going to work like he had never left. For just a moment, hearing that phrase made me forget about all the troubles this team has faced since he departed. Four years and four coaches were gone in an instant, and all I could remember was that the ball doesn't lie.\n\nOrlando Summer League: Day Two Diary\n\nDetroit's second Orlando Summer League game is already history. I imagine it was as difficult to watch remotely as it was to see in person, but I was lucky not to be locked to the view from the video stream. Detroit was trounced by Boston right out of the gate, so the competitiveness of the game took a back seat to the interest of Rasheed Wallace sitting in as an assistant coach. I had to get a better view of Detroit's bench, so I left my spot next to NBA photographer Fernando Medina (who took one of the NBA's most iconic images)* and switched to the opposite baseline.\n\nRasheed had always been a controversial figure in Detroit ... or anywhere else he played. Beneath all of the celebrations and criticisms, none could doubt his deeply passionate connection to the game. The idea of Rasheed Wallace as a coach was difficult to take seriously because, well, it can be difficult to take Rasheed seriously. Today in Orlando, however, it was immediately evident what kind of value Rasheed Wallace can have as an assistant coach.\n\nRasheed the teacher was present on every play. This wasn't the case of a motivating old veteran shouting words of encouragement -- it was a technical mind, revered for his basketball IQ on court, advising technique between possessions. Boston subbed in a new player in the second quarter, and it was either Siva or Lucious that Wallace pulled aside immediately to explain, \"He's a lefty, shift to your left when he picks up his dribble.\" This wasn't your typical \"Go hard, D up, make the big shot\" empty hype, it was the product of 13 years of NBA intelligence paying dividends in technical leadership.\n\nDuring timeouts, Wallace was not drawing up plays. Mo Cheeks' fellow OKC assistant Maz Trakh was running the play book, Wallace was teaching. Before and after the huddle, a time in NBA games where Wallace was usually nowhere to be found, Wallace was instead momentarily meeting with a few players giving advice. Walking down the bench, Wallace would explain, \"Slava, try doing this when your man slips by you on the right for the rebound.\" \"Tony, you're doing this and giving up space on those J's and that's why they're not falling.\"\n\nWhile I loved the idea of Rasheed Wallace the player joining Detroit's coaching staff, it was mostly for sentimental reasons. Seeing him in action with Detroit's youngest, most impressionable players made me a firm, instant believer. I imagine he'll end up picking up the clipboard at some point and adjusting a play or two and perhaps even drawing up some of his own in the near future. If that never happens, and Detroit sees more of what I saw today out of Wallace, our young players will be all the better for it.\n\nBesides, hearing \"Ball Don't Lie\" from Rasheed Wallace on the Pistons bench is something you can never get tired of. I welcome him back, and it was pure serendipity to be able to do so in person at the 2013 Orlando Summer League.\n\nSummer League Day Two Diary Notes"
