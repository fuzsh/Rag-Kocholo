        "text": "The on-court incidents Rasheed Wallace has had throughout his NBA career are usually arguments with referees.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, Wallace was exchanging words not only with the officials, but with Boston Celtics coach Doc Rivers as well.\n\nWallace picked up his 14th technical foul of the season with 49.9 seconds left in the third quarter of a 117-113 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers at the TD Garden.\n\nAs teammate Ray Allen tried to calm the volatile Wallace down, Rivers began talking to the veteran center as well.\n\nWallace began yelling at Rivers and continued to do so for several moments. With Zydrunas Ilgauskas at the foul line, Rivers sent Shelden Williams into the game for Wallace, who sat on the bench for the rest of the afternoon.\n\nRivers indicated he would not be punishing Wallace with a fine for the outburst. Wallace, whose last technical foul was Feb. 19 at Portland, did not comment following the Celtics’ victory.\n\n“We know who Rasheed is and at times, he’s an emotional player,’’ said Rivers. “The one thing I will say is once he does the explosion, you notice sitting on the bench, I honestly thought if I needed him I could have put him back in.\n\n“He gathers himself pretty well. He’s just like all of us when we do something emotionally. Five minutes later, 10 minutes later, you’re thinking, ‘Wow, I wish I could get that back.’\n\n“But you can’t. I don’t mind (Wallace yelling at Rivers). My wife screams at me and we still love each other.’’\n\nAsked if there would be a fine for the incident, Rivers said, “If I did, I wouldn’t tell you anyway, but I don’t fine very often.’’\n\nWallace’s technical came after Glen Davis was called for a foul on Ilgauskas just 30 seconds after LeBron James gave a referee an earful without getting a technical.\n\nAllen went right over to Wallace after he was hit with the technical, but had little success calming him down.\n\n“I think once a guy goes, I basically just wanted to stay away,’’ said Rivers. “Usually when a player grabs him, he’s pretty good. You could see he was yelling at them, yelling at me, yelling at the refs. That’s when you just try to let him vent, walk away and you keep going.’’\n\nSaid Paul Pierce: “I just said, ‘Stay focused.’ We’re going to need him. Rasheed is a vet, and he’s been there before. You’ve just got to talk to him. He understands the situation. He knows we’re trying to win a game. I just told him to stick with it. When he was on the bench, I thought he was fine.’’\n\nRotation changes\n\nRivers used Tony Allen for 19 minutes with Marquis Daniels and Nate Robinson both recording DNPs.\n\nRivers said that it was a preview of his playoff rotation that will feature Allen, Glen Davis, Wallace and Michael Finley as the main reserves.\n\nLandry returns\n\nWith the Maine Red Claws season in the NBDL over, Marcus Landry was recalled by the Celtics. Landry, who was on the inactive list on Sunday, played 13 games in Maine and averaged 11.4 points, 4.3 rebounds and 1.6 assists in 24.9 minutes. … Former Celtics forward Leon Powe had two points and two rebounds off the Cavs’ bench. … The Celtics allowed better than 50 percent shooting for the third straight game. … Boston finished 3-3 on the longest homestand of the season and plays in New York on Tuesday night."
