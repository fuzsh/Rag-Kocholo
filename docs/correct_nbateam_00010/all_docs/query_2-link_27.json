        "text": "The Boston Celtics' Big Three expanded to four with the signing of free-agent forward Rasheed Wallace on Wednesday.\n\nFinancial terms of the two-year contract were not disclosed.\n\nWallace, 34, is an exceptional shooter and belligerent rebounder and is certain to complement the trio of Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Ray Allen in Boston.\n\n\"We're ecstatic to be able to add a player the calibre of Rasheed Wallace to our team,\" Celtics general manager Danny Ainge said.\n\nBoston won its 17th NBA championship in 2008 but, with Garnett sidelined by injury, was bounced by the Orlando Magic in seven games in the Eastern Conference semifinals last season.\n\nGarnett is expected to be ready to start the season following knee surgery, but Wallace offers additional grit as Boston bids to return to championship form.\n\n\"It is not everyday that you can add a four-time all-star and a player with championship experience,\" Ainge said.\n\nWallace has averaged 15.0 points, 6.9 rebounds, 1.9 assists, 1.3 blocked shots, 1.0 steals and 33.9 minutes in 1,009 games, including 943 starts, over 14 NBA seasons with the Washington Wizards, Portland Trail Blazers, Atlanta Hawks and Detroit Pistons.\n\nHe won an NBA title with Detroit in 2004, and set the league record for technical fouls with 41 in 2000-01."
