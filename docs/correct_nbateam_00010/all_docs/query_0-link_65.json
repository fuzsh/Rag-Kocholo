        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio -- In the old days, Rasheed Wallace was the player Cavaliers fans -- every opposing fan, really -- loved to hate the most.\n\nHe was the kind of physical player who would draw blood from Cavaliers (see Zydrunas Ilgauskas in 2006), the kind of irritating opponent who would guarantee victories for his Detroit Pistons (see 2006 against the Cavaliers, among others) and talk brashly both on and off the court (see every season of his 15-year career).\n\nBut in six playoff games before Monday's Game 2 of the Eastern semifinals, the 35-year-old Wallace was mostly irrelevant. He was averaging 3.5 points in 13.2 minutes, and hadn't hit a single trademark 3-pointer.\n\nThe Celtics needed more from him, and Boston coach Doc Rivers said so bluntly before Game 2.\n\n\"He has to play better, bottom line,\" Rivers said. \"He's got to play better defense. The offense will come, but he has to be a better defender. We can't wait.\"\n\nWhether Wallace viewed it as a challenge is unknown, since the power forward declined to talk after Boston's 104-86 victory to even the series, 1-1.\n\nBut it was certainly a different Wallace from the moment he entered the game in the first quarter. He knocked in all five of his first-half field goals -- including three 3-pointers -- for a team-high 13 points.\n\nIn the end, he had 17 points on 7-of-8 shooting in 18 minutes. He was having the kind of night where he even leaped in exaggerated frustration when he missed his lone 3-pointer of the game at the end of the third quarter.\n\n\"I just thought Rasheed was phenomenal,\" Rivers said. \"Obviously the threes were huge, but his post play was good as well.\"\n\nHis post play allowed the Celtics to establish an inside-outside balanced attack with Wallace and Kevin Garnett (18 points on 8-for-21 shooting) pounding in the paint and Ray Allen (22 points on 8-for-15 shooting) hitting from afar. Garnett hit only two of his nine attempts in the first half, but Rivers told his 6-11 power forward to keep attacking.\n\n\"Kevin was going way too fast in the first half, but he still was a concern in the post,\" Rivers said. \"I kept telling our coaches, 'I don't care that he's not converting right now. [The Cavaliers are] worried about him.'\"\n\nThe games coaches play: After Cavaliers coach Mike Brown revealed he had submitted to the league a Game 1 Shaquille O'Neal foul on Celtics guard Rajon Rondo for review, Rivers revealed what, exactly, he thought of the O'Neal contact.\n\n\"I thought it was close to an assassination,\" Rivers said.\n\nTurns out the O'Neal foul Brown submitted to the league was in the second quarter, not the fourth-quarter call Rivers was referring to when Rondo hit the floor and stayed there for a few seconds.\n\nRegardless of which foul it was, it was just one of the behind-the-scene maneuvers that coaches make during the playoffs.\n\n\"That's just the games that silly coaches play so when [O'Neal] does it [again] they don't call a flagrant,\" Rivers said. \"It's what you have to do. I submitted four calls [for review from Game 1]. I'm scared to tell you which ones because I may get fined for it, [but] they said I was right.\""
