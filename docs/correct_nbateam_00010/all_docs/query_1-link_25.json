        "text": "Brace yourselves. Rasheed Wallace may be planning a comeback to the NBA. Wallace, a 15-year veteran, is reportedly working out and mulling over a possible return to professional basketball, according to a Yahoo! Sports report.\n\nWallace, who retired after 15 seasons in 2010, has been working out and probing some close league friends about possible destinations to sign for the rest of the season, sources said. (via Adrian Wojnarowski/Yahoo! Sports)\n\nWallace last played for the Boston Celtics, averaging 9.0 points and 4.1 rebounds in 79 regular season games in 2009-10. After the Celtics lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in Game 7 of the 2010 NBA Finals, Wallace announced his retirement.\n\nSheed's career began in the 1995-96 season after he was drafted by the Washington Bullets. Wallace played in Washington for one season before being traded to the Portland Trail Blazers, where he played for seven and a half seasons. Wallace was shipped to the Atlanta Hawks on Feb. 9, 2004 and was again traded 10 days later to the Detroit Pistons. Wallace played in Motown for just over five seasons before joining the Celtics on July 8, 2009."
