        "text": "Five years after taking part in the trade that brought Rasheed Wallace his first championship ring, the Celtics are bringing the 14-year NBA veteran to Boston in hopes of getting him his second.\n\nThe 34-year-old free agent signed a reported two-year deal with Boston yesterday for the mid-level exception ($5.8 million) and will be in Waltham for a 4 p.m. press conference today. The forward-center received plenty of interest around the league after averaging 12.0 points and 7.4 rebounds for the Detroit Pistons last year, but he cut his recruiting tour short last weekend after a hard sell that included Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge, managing partner Wyc Grousbeck, coach Doc Rivers and players Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Ray Allen.\n\nThe deal comes a little more than five years after Ainge facilitated a three-team swap with the Atlanta Hawks and Pistons that sent Wallace to Detroit, where he won the title three months later and played the next five seasons.\n\n\"We are ecstatic to be able to add a player the caliber of Rasheed Wallace to our team,\" Ainge said in a statement yesterday. \"It is not every day that you can add a four-time All-Star with championship experience.\"\n\nThe Celtics made Wallace their top offseason priority, and with good reason. For the past two years, they have gone into the season with a mishmash of undersized and underskilled big men behind Garnett and Kendrick Perkins. Two years ago, they got away with it when they lured P.J. Brown out of retirement in February and caught lightning in a bottle with his turn-back-the-clock effort in the playoffs. But last year, they were caught shorthanded again when summer acquisition Patrick O'Bryant flamed out and late-season pickup Mikki Moore couldn't crack the playoff rotation despite season-ending injuries to both Garnett and Leon Powe.\n\nSeemingly determined to settle the bench issues during the summer instead of on the fly this time, Ainge started with the type of big man that appears perfectly suited for Boston's offense.\n\nAt 6-foot-11, Wallace has the size to back up both Perkins and Garnett. With 982 career three-pointers, he also has the shooting range to spread the floor and allow Pierce, Allen and Rajon Rondo to attack the rim.\n\nWallace has averaged 15.0 points and 6.9 rebounds over his career. He is seventh on the active list in games played, ninth in blocked shots and 10th in rebounds. He has the one title and has played in the postseason for 13 straight seasons.\n\nOf course, it hasn't always been smooth sailing for the volatile Wallace. A 47.1 percent career shooter, he hasn't topped the 44.3 percent mark in five years including a career-low 41.9 percent last year as he's become an increasingly perimeter shooter. Perennially among the league leaders in technical fouls, he has also been a controversial figure throughout his career for his on-court antics and is a frequent target of officials and opposing fans.\n\nBut the yapping was clearly worth the potential reward for a team that has spent the last two years searching for a capable big man taller than the 6-foot-8 Glen Davis (now a restricted free agent) and the 6-foot-7 Powe (an unrestricted free agent recovering from left knee reconstruction).\n\nAinge can now turn to the other pair of glaring weaknesses from last year's playoff run a backup point guard to Rondo and a backup wing player with size behind Pierce. Ainge and the ownership must also weigh whether to match any offer to Davis, with conflicting reports arising on the demand for the power forward. But if bidding gets too rich for the Celtics to match in either money or years, then the roster gains from landing Wallace will be largely nullified.\n\nWell into luxury-tax land, with only the biannual exception (about $1.9 million) and veteran minimum deals (about $1.3 million) to offer free agents other than Davis, it will be a pricey proposition to keep adding to the roster. But with holes still to fill, and an aging core of players peering through a closing window of championship opportunity, Ainge has already gone too far down the spending path this summer to turn back now.\n\n(Scott Souza is a Daily News staff writer.
