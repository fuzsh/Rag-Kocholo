        "text": "After game seven of the Finals, Kevin Garnett said that Rasheed Wallace came into the locker room and gave his thanks and regards and that it was very emotional. Nate Robinson: It was. Sheed is one of my all-time favorites, regardless of the techs. He speaks his mind and that is what I love about him. I have so much respect for him because if something isn’t right, he will let you know. He’s like that all the time. That was the one person who I would look to for advice and he always gave me his honest opinion whether I liked it or not. As a player he worked everyday. He came in and shot early, leave late. The main thing about him is he wanted to win. He has a ring but wanted to go out with a bang. We tried to go out with a championship but unfortunately we didn’t. The speech that he gave, saying stuff like he wouldn’t of had it any other way besides going to war with the guys that were in that locker room with us. It touched everybody. We were heartbroken that we didn’t win it for him. Of course I wanted to win my first championship but I wanted to win because I have looked up to Sheed since college. I played against his AAU team in Philly.\n\n“We wanted Tony back,” the Celtics general manager said following yesterday’s press conference to introduce Jermaine O’Neal. “We tried to get him back. It was not a financial decision (by Allen), so I think you really have to ask him that question. “We have a lot of decisions that we have to make,” Ainge said of the team’s options, which include trading the retiring Rasheed Wallace’s $6 million salary slot, and finding players who are willing to accept the veteran’s minimum. “The Tony Allen situation was difficult, but he chose another destination.”"
