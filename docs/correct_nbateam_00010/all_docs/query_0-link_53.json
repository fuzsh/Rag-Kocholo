        "text": "This led to Wallace retiring at the end of the season (he would try a brief comeback with the New York Knicks a few seasons later, which went similarly).\n\nWallace would average 9 points, 4.1 rebounds, and an assist per game as a Celtic.\n\nFinally, it is also the date that wing Togo Palazzi was born in Union City, New Jersey in 1932.\n\nA product of Holy Cross picked up by the Celtics in the 1954 NBA draft, Palazzi played parts of three seasons with Boston before his rights were sold to the (then) Syracuse Nationals (today’s Philadelphia 76ers) in 1956.\n\nHe averaged 5.3 points and 2.9 rebounds per game while with the Celtics.\n\nListen to the “Celtics Lab” podcast on:\n\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3zBKQY6\n\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3GfUPFi\n\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/3F9DvjQ"
