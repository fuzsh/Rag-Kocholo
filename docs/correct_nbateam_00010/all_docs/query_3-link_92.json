        "text": "AUBURN HILLS -- Detroit Pistons center Ben Wallace let his play speak for itself Wednesday night in a 92-86 upset of the Boston Celtics.\n\nThen, he talked about it Thursday, giving current Celtics forward and former teammate Rasheed Wallace some good-natured ribbing in the process.\n\nBen Wallace and Jason Maxiell blocked shots by Rasheed Wallace in his first game at The Palace of Auburn Hills since leaving the Pistons in the offseason, but Ben Wallace said he did not say anything about it while on the court.\n\n\"Once you block a shot, that's saying enough, so you don't have to say a whole lot,\" he said. \"He knew what time it was.\"\n\nRasheed Wallace did not return the favor of being silent, according to Big Ben.\n\n\"Sheed's always talking,\" he said. \"I'd be surprised if you ever catch Sheed not talking. He talks when he's eating. I'm pretty sure -- I've got to ask his wife -- I think he talks in his sleep, too.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Ben Wallace did not have much to say when someone suggested he has been playing through some bumps and bruises this season.\n\n\"I'm 110 percent compared to where I was the last three years, so I've got no gripes, no whining, no moans, no complaints,\" he said. \"I'm just playing basketball and enjoying my time on the floor.\"\n\nWallace said there is only one reason he continues to work and play so hard at age 35.\n\n\"I'm a basketball player. As long as I'm out there, I've got to play the way I know how to play,\" he said. \"That's the only way I know how to play is all out. Once I can't do that, I'll go home and sit on the couch.\"\n\nWilcox likes the Beanee Weenee way\n\nFriday's game will be another \"$1 Dog Friday\" at The Palace, which means hot dogs are $1 each.\n\nSomeone asked Pistons forward Chris Wilcox about his favorite way to eat a hot dog.\n\n\"Hot dogs and beans, fixed my favorite way -- Beanee Weenees,\" Wilcox said. \"You don't remember that? You don't remember the Beanee Weenees? They had commercials and everything. They used to come in a can.\"\n\nWilcox then broke into the song from an old Beanee Weenees commercial.\n\nBen Wallace said there's only one way to cook hot dogs.\n\n\"You grill them and you've got yourself something,\" he said. \"All that boiling and microwaving, don't nuke 'em to death. Grill 'em.\""
