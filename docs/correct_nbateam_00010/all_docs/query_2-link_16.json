        "text": "Doc Rivers has been the target of criticism from multiple former players in recent days after his 76ers were blown out by the Celtics in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals.\n\nRasheed Wallace spent just one year playing under Rivers with the Celtics before he retired after the 2009-10 season but in an appearance on his YouTube show “That’s What Sheed Said” on Monday, the big man did not hold back on criticizing his former coach.\n\n“You gotta get somebody in there that the players respect,” Wallace said of Rivers. “He doesn’t make adjustments. That’s just from being in the locker room with him for that one season. That seems to always be his biggest knock If his team is up, you don’t have to coach s*** then. When you are in the trenches, and you are going against another team and another good coach, you’ve gotta be more than a locker room manager.\n\n“He depends more on the players to make those adjustments, but coach you have to come in there and make adjustments as well especially when what you’re trying hasn’t worked.”\n\nRelated: Mobile sports betting is live in Massachusetts on DraftKings.

Boom boom boom.’”\n\nRelated: Buy tickets to Celtics-Heat series at VividSeats, StubHub or SeatGeek\n\nThe Celtics lost Game 7 of the NBA Finals in 2010 to the Lakers after blowing a 3-2 lead with Rivers at the helm. The former Sixers coach has now lost five straight Game 7s overall and has failed to reach a conference final since his time with Boston in 2012.\n\nWith Rivers’ firing on Tuesday, Philadelphia joins the Bucks, Suns, Raptors and Pistons as team with head coach openings."
