        "text": "ORLANDO, Fla.There's at least one team apparently still with a need for Rasheed Wallace.\n\nCSNNE.com has learned that the former Boston Celtic forward plans to sign with the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nWallace hasn't played in an NBA game since Game 7 of the 2010 NBA Finals, alerting the C's shortly before the game that he planned to retire.\n\nAlthough he had two years remaining on his contract, Wallace and the Celtics came to terms on a buy-out of the remaining years believed to be worth about 1 million.\n\nHis return to action has been rumored for weeks, fueled by a decent showing at Pro-Am tournament in North Carolina this summer.\n\nIt only became heightened by, according to league sources, a renewed conditioning regimen that apparently has him looking better than he has \"in years.\"\n\nWith a roster of 14 players, the Lakers can add Wallace and not have to worry about waiving a player to make room.\n\nHis addition will likely fuel rumors that the Lakers will become even more aggressive in their decision to trade away Pau Gasol.\n\nHowever, a front office executive whose team has had both internal and external discussions about Gasol, said the addition of Wallace will only be to strengthen their bench.\n\n\"His days as a starter in this league are gone,\" said the source. \"I think he knows that, and so do the Lakers. But think about it. Of the big men that are available, is there one that's really better? And if he's gotten himself in shape, adding him becomes a huge get for them.\"\n\nAs for the Celtics, Boston had no interest in reuniting with Wallace when word spread that he was planning to make a comeback. And that lack of disinterest, CSNNE.com has learned, was mutual."
