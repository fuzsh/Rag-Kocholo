        "text": "Enough already — Rasheed Wallace isn't coming to Boston to \"rehab\" his image.\n\nWhat exactly is the image that Wallace needs to fix? One of a long, athletic big man who makes equally big shots? A quintessential teammate who never puts himself first?\n\nAsk around, and that's what you'll hear about Wallace.\n\nSay what you want about guys like Corey Dillon and Randy Moss in Foxboro, or Stephon Marbury with the Celtics last season. These are guys who earned their reputations, and needed to prove they were beyond them when they arrived in these parts. But Wallace has earned nothing but respect from the rest of the league.\n\nAre there problems with Rasheed's game? Yes. He's been accused of getting \"bored\" on the court when players don't give him a challenge. He doesn't play in the post enough for a guy his size. He'd rather shoot than bang.\n\nAnd, of course, there is the emotion he shows on the court that often gets him into tech trouble.\n\nIt's that side of Wallace that makes Boston fans automatically think he's unwanted or unloved throughout the rest of the NBA. That he needs to come to the Celtics to erase any negativity from the minds of the fans, the media or his Wikipedia page. It's simply not true.\n\nHere are the facts: he's perennially among the leaders in technical fouls, and holds the NBA record for most in a season with 40. He served a seven-game suspension for threatening official Tim Donaghy — yeah, that Tim Donaghy — after a game. He's still the only player to ever be ejected from the McDonald's All-American Game. His comments on flops after playing the Celtics in 2008 cost him $25,000 but also led to the league's current stance of fining obvious flops.\n\nNone of that, however, is proof that Rasheed Wallace is troubled, or that he will be trouble for the Celtics. You think Kevin Garnett has a problem playing with a guy who wears his heart on his sleeve?\n\nOne of the glaring weaknesses for last season's Celtics was length off the bench. Patrick O'Bryant didn't work out, and P.J. Brown wanted to stay retired. That left Boston relying on the smaller Leon Powe and Glen Davis to relieve Garnett and Kendrick Perkins, which wasn't always enough.\n\nAnother missing component was a solid scorer off the bench, a true sixth man that could space the floor when playing with the Big 3 or take it to the hole when the second unit took over.\n\nWallace takes care of both issues, giving Boston its best bench player since James Posey and one that will likely even be better. He wasn't given a two-year contract worth more than a combined $10 million because Danny Ainge wanted to show he can perform an extreme makeover. He was brought in because he averaged 15.0 points and 6.9 rebounds for his career, including 12 points and 7.4 boards last season in 32.2 minutes per game. Even though he's soon to be 35 years old, he'll help keep the Celtics in the championship picture for the next two seasons without forcing them to sacrifice for the future.\n\nAnd an even better sign? Wallace turned down overtures from San Antonio, Orlando, Cleveland and Dallas to become a Celtic. Players want to come here now because it offers a championship opportunity, not a miracle cure for personality deficiencies.\n\nSure, Boston fans want to puff out their chests and talk about how coming to a New England team is the fix for what ails any player. Here, we're all about winning and none of that other crap will fly.\n\nBut that's not what's going on with Wallace. It's as simple as this: one of the premiere free agents on the market chose to come to Boston, sacrificing more money and a starting role elsewhere, because he wants to be a part of the Celtics. He possesses an unique skill set that will make him a perfect fit amongst the Big 3, and he'll be an ideal teammate for them. That's the Rasheed rep that matters.\n\nBecause the only thing Rasheed Wallace is coming to Boston to fix are a few of his nine fingers that are still missing a championship ring.\n\nTim Weisberg covers the Boston Celtics for The Standard-Times.
