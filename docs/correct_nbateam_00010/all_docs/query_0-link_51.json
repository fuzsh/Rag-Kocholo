        "text": "Not ready to go home just yet, the only place the Orlando Magic are headed is back to Boston.\n\nHalfway to history.\n\nTaking another step toward overcoming an improbable 3-0 series deficit, Dwight Howard had 21 points and 10 rebounds to lead the Magic to a 113-92 victory over the Celtics on Wednesday night in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals.\n\nA series that looked like a sweep a few days ago now has the Celtics taking a slim 3-2 lead into a pressure-packed Game 6 in Boston on Friday night. The Celtics are facing the possibility of playing it without Kendrick Perkins after their starting center picked up his seventh technical foul of the playoffs, a mandatory suspension unless it is overturned.\n\nA potential Game 7 would be in Orlando.\n\nNo NBA team has won a series after losing the first three games.\n\nThe Magic, seemingly lifeless after a blowout defeat in Game 3, suddenly have hope to be the first. They broke out of their series-long shooting slump, making 13-of-25 3-pointers.\n\n\"We just all believe,\" guard Jameer Nelson said. \"We all believe. We know we can do it, one game at a time.\"\n\nNelson scored 24 points, and J.J. Redick had 14 to help the Magic to a frenetic pace that the Celtics couldn't sustain. Howard added five blocks as Orlando built an early 14-point lead that was never seriously challenged.\n\nRasheed Wallace had 21 points, and Ray Allen scored 19 for a Boston team that once seemed on its way to another NBA finals.\n\nNow? The Celtics are stunned and dazed.\n\nHoward's elbow inadvertently came down on Glen Davis' face near the basket in the third quarter, giving the Celtics forward a concussion. Davis tried to get up as play continued on the other end, wobbling his way to midcourt, almost falling flat as referee Joey Crawford kept him from tumbling to the hardwood.\n\nDavis did not return, and his status for Game 6 was not immediately announced. The rest of the Celtics continued to crumble, again unable to deliver the knockout blow.\n\nGive the Magic a puncher's chance.\n\nRedick provided a big boost off the bench, making a pair of 3-pointers to highlight a 20-8 run that put Orlando ahead 51-37 in the second quarter. His swishes and crisp passing kept the Celtics scrambling, and it filled a major hole with starter Vince Carter continuing to struggle.\n\nAmid an amped-up Amway Arena, Wallace picked up his third foul during the spurt and taunted Orlando fans all the way to bench. Wallace shouted and screamed to the stands, pointing at his ring finger for the championship he already won with Detroit — a title that has long eluded Orlando.\n\nThings got even worse for the Celtics when Perkins was ejected after he picked up his second technical of the game and seventh of the postseason for arguing with officials. Perkins and Marcin Gortat were whistled for double technicals a few minutes prior after they got tangled up.\n\nThat means Perkins, one of the best defenders in the league on Howard, will be suspended for Game 6 unless the NBA rescinds the technical. The league reviews every technical.\n\nThe Celtics are two games from infamy, and the pressure is mounting, too.\n\nOnly four times in the history of North American major pro sports leagues has a team won a playoff series after losing the first three games. Such comebacks are something Boston fans know all too well.\n\nIt has happened three times in the NHL — most recently by the Philadelphia Flyers over the Boston Bruins earlier this month — and once in baseball, when the Boston Red Sox came back to beat the New York Yankees in the 2004 AL championship series.\n\nIn 93 tries, it has just never been done in the NBA.\n\nHere's the Magic's chance at history.\n\nNOTES: Of the 93 teams that have fallen into an 0-3 hole, only three have even forced a Game 7. ... The NBA upgraded Howard's elbow on Boston's Kevin Garnett in Game 4 to a flagrant-one foul Wednesday. That's Howard's second flagrant of the playoffs; two more and he will be suspended one game."
