        "text": "The signing of Luke Harangody on Tuesday put the Boston Celtics at the NBA limit of 15 players with guaranteed contracts.\n\nThe second-round pick from Notre Dame, who had a strong showing in last month’s summer league in Orlando, received a two-year deal worth an average of about $650,000.\n\nNot long after having a full roster, however, the Celtics made another move that freed up one last spot.\n\nRasheed Wallace, who is retiring after 15 seasons, was waived by the Celtics on Tuesday night “after coming to a mutual agreement following which Wallace plans to retire,’’ according to a team press release.\n\nWallace, who had two years worth about $13 million remaining on a three-year contract signed last summer, told Coach Doc Rivers and teammates during the NBA Finals that he would not be returning in the 2010-11 season.\n\nThe Celtics have been trying to trade his contract before he officially retires to get some more bench help, but they were unable to find a deal.\n\nBy waiving Wallace, who likely received a buyout for the final two years, the Celtics will not be bringing him back and won’t be trading his contract. Wallace is now a free agent until sending his retirement papers to the NBA.\n\nWallace, who was signed last summer to be the leader of the Celtics’ bench, had a disappointing regular season but showed improvement during Boston’s run to the NBA Finals.\n\n“We would like to thank Rasheed for everything that he did for this team and organization last season,’’ said president of basketball operations Danny Ainge in a statement. “We would like to wish Rasheed and his family the best as they move on into the next phase of their lives. He will always be a member of the Celtics family.’’\n\nWithout having Wallace’s contract to trade, the Celtics will likely have to offer a player the veteran minimum in order to fill out the final roster spot.\n\n“One more piece is possible,’’ said Ainge. “I like the pieces we have and would be happy going into training camp with this team. It is possible we could add another player, most likely for the veteran’s minimum, possibly in a trade, but the most likely scenario is the veteran’s minimum.’’\n\nHarangody, the No. 52 player selected in June, averaged 16.6 points and 6.8 rebounds while shooting 50 percent from 3-point range in the summer league. He was at the Celtics’ training facility on Tuesday morning for the Shaquille O’Neal press conference, arriving in Massachusetts the day before.\n\n“It feels good. Now I can finally sleep at night,’’ said Harangody of signing the contract. “I put my work in and, thankfully, I got a contract.\n\n“I think today it’s really starting to hit me for the first time. It begins today. I officially feel part of the team.’’\n\nRivers was impressed by what he saw from Harangody in Orlando and sees a player who can be a contributor down the road.\n\n“He can shoot the ball,’’ said Rivers. “He can stretch the floor. He shot the ball extremely well in summer league from behind the NBA 3-point line. I didn’t know he had the range. He’s going to be a player in this league. He’ll be good for us.’’\n\nName game: O’Neal said he hasn’t settled on a new nickname to use while playing for the Celtics.\n\n“So far, I like The Big Shamrock, but I might go with the Big Green Mile, too,’’ he said.\n\nO’Neal, who has worn Nos. 32, 33 and 34 during his career, will be the first Celtics’ player to wear No. 36. He settled on a number in the 30s to stay consistent, and the six represents the number of teams O’Neal has been with.\n\nThe three numbers O’Neal has worn on other teams are not available in Boston since 32 and 33 are retired for Kevin McHale and Larry Bird, and Paul Pierce wears 34."
