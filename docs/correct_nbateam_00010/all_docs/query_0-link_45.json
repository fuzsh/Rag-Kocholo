        "text": "Even during his time with the Boston Celtics, when he existed on the corner of Atrocious and Ugh for an entire season, those who knew him closely called Rasheed Wallace a good teammate.\n\nI personally remember him as the overweight center who chucked ill-advised threes, held Bud Lights in his locker for after games and seemed to miss more defensive rotations than he made, but his teammates and coaches all supported him. From my standpoint, he looked exactly like a teammate I would have despised -- a lazy dude who didn't care enough to get into shape and opted for miserable decisions almost every possession. Yet everyone swore by him. He's with the New York Knicks now, and teammates and coaches are still preaching the value he provides even when he's not making nonchalant 3-pointers to beat the end-of-quarter buzzer.\n\nRegardless of what you think about Wallace: Good teammates sometimes tuck in their shirts, but other times they wear sweatpants to practice with the pockets inside-out. They can be louder than Lil Jon on a megaphone or quieter than a Charlie Chaplin movie. They can be pacifists or they can routinely throw vicious elbows. Stephen Jackson has raced into the stands in an apparent attempt to maim humans or maybe keep them from being killed by Ron Artest, and he's been arrested for firing gunshots into the night air. Tim Duncan once called Jackson the \"ultimate teammate.\"\n\nThe concept of a good teammate is not easy to define. One of the best teammates I ever had jousted with coaches on a semi-daily basis, largely because he had serious issues with authority. Once, during a college practice, our head coach got into an argument with this teammate and sent him into timeout on the bleachers, as if he were a kindergartner who had just thrown a Lego at a classmate. Yet this teammate busted his rump every day at practice and never stopped trying to execute the game plan. He was a 6-foot-4 power forward who couldn't dunk with the world's largest supply of Flubber pasted onto his shoe soles, and he didn't play more than five or six minutes per game. But he had real value to our team. When a fight broke out during one game, he got suspended for running off the bench to hop into the scrum. That didn't necessarily make him a good teammate. But even though this kid was never my best friend, when I sulked through one practice because of personal issues, he waited for me outside the gym to walk me home and ask what was up.\n\nLeadership isn't always packaged without flaws. When Boston Celtics guard Rajon Rondo shoved Brooklyn Nets forward Kris Humphries repeatedly on Wednesday night, he considered himself to be acting in support of his teammate and good friend, Kevin Garnett. He probably didn't take enough time to consider \"man, I might get suspended for this,\" \"this double-digit assists streak is kind of cool,\" \"was that foul even very hard?\" or \"we really don't have a backup point guard, so maybe I should chill and not risk severe punishment.\" He just saw a teammate falling to the hardwood and ran over to let the offending party know the Celtics did not agree with his foul. Garnett appreciated the support but will certainly miss his point guard for the next two outings. Doc Rivers called out his team's softness and said he would never consider fighting the way to demonstrate toughness, but always says he would rather have to dim a fire than kindle one. Leadership is complicated. Being a good teammate can sometimes be detrimental to one's team.\n\nIt'd be nice to think Rondo wanted to have a Jason Varitek-like effect on the Celtics, that he wanted to inspire his occasionally-lackadaisical team to finally start reaching its potential. It'd be nice to think his response was measured, that he quickly calculated the risk of a suspension and what it might mean, that he saw how Boston was getting pounded by the Nets and figured it was time someone on the Celtics got his hands dirty. It'd be nice to think he somehow weighed the pros and cons in two seconds like he were reading the open floor, but I doubt Rondo had time to consider the consequences of his actions. He can be a bit of a loose cannon sometimes. He's bumped one referee and thrown a ball at another. He's squared off with Kirk Hinrich and seems to genuinely enjoy getting underneath an opponent's skin. He doesn't back down, plays with \"an edge,\" as he calls it. That edge can get him in trouble. It's also what encourages him to dominate entire playoff series, what caused him to keep playing after a gruesome elbow dislocation, why anyone with more than 12 brain cells would rather be on his team than against him. Rondo is complex, perhaps as difficult to explain as anybody in the NBA. He's the NBA's most willing passer, a great quality to have, but sometimes turns down wide open layups to find Jason Collins near the 3-point arc (which actually happened Wednesday night before all the drama). His flaws feed his strengths. His strengths power his flaws. He succeeds in part for the very same reasons why he occasionally makes bad decisions.\n\nGarnett and Kendrick Perkins are two of the most selfless and loyal players -- and from what I can garner, people -- to be involved with the Celtics organization during the past decade. From what I understand, they would be disgusted by someone who failed to put his team first at any time. They are two of Rondo's best friends. I don't know if this fact matters when trying to understand the point guard. I just thought it warranted mention as the backlash toward him reached severe levels this week. He made a bad decision. The bad decision began in a good place. The Celtics will have Leandro Barbosa and a slew of other scoring guards manning the point guard position for the next two games. That is not at all ideal.\n\nMore importantly in the long run than Rondo's two-game absence, though, is that the Celtics currently lack toughness. They don't necessarily need someone capable of administrating Kris Humphries a Stone Cold Stunner, but it'd be nice if they had a big man (besides Garnett) to box out, defend the rim and keep opponents from getting easy layups. The Celtics are dead last in the NBA in rebound rate. If I had to guess, I'd say they surrender 495 points in the paint per game. They have a long history of toughness and defense, but their defense has been awful and their toughness -- physical toughness but also mental, since this is basketball and excessive contact draws foul calls or worse -- hasn't been any better. Avery Bradley should help on both counts, but he shouldn't be expected to lead another huge midseason transformation all by himself. The Celtics miss Greg Stiemsma, who erased some mistakes on the interior. They could use P.J. Brown, were he a couple years younger and in any type of game shape. They significantly bolstered their talent level this season but they haven't developed a defensive identity yet. Their edges seem to be smoothed with sandpaper, rather than being made of sandpaper itself. They have been punked by the Nets twice so far this season, once on the road and once at home.\n\nRondo saw Garnett falling to the floor. Maybe in that instant he thought about all the open layups Boston had allowed, all the offensive rebounds it had surrendered, and felt his team needed a spark to regain its edge. Maybe he was just frustrated by another bad showing against the Nets. Maybe he simply lost his cool seeing his teammate, one of his best friends, getting pushed while off balance (note: I realize it wasn't the hardest foul). Maybe he had watched Green Street Hooligans earlier that day and wanted to react in a way that would make Pete Dunham proud. Whatever the case, he committed a mistake that cost the Celtics but came in support of a teammate.\n\nDespite his teammates and coaching staff swearing he has matured into a leader, and from the outside it seems like he really has, Rondo still possesses flaws. Sometimes, as I noted earlier, they are the same as his strengths. He is passionate and tough, brazen and courageous, stubborn and defiant. Those traits sometimes blend together and turn into 44-point postseason performances against the Miami Heat, but they can also combust into unwanted suspensions.\n\nI guess the point is this: We won't agree with everything Rondo does, but like with his jump shot, he's working to correct his biggest shortcomings. And regardless of how many strides he continues to make, his teammates and coaches will be happy to have him on their side.\n\nAs Wallace might say, ball don't lie. I'm not convinced that phrase even fits here, but heck, he might have said it anyway."
