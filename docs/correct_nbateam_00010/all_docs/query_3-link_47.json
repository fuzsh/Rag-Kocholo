        "text": "At 6-foot-11, Wallace, 37, had been one of the most versatile and talented power forwards of his era. One league source who has talked with Wallace recently describes him as “serious” about a return to the NBA this season. Nevertheless, no teams contacted by Yahoo! Sports reported that they had any contact with Wallace, or his representative. When reached on Friday, Wallace’s agent, Bill Strickland, would only tell Yahoo! Sports’ Marc Spears: “As a veteran player, [Wallace] knows what it takes to be reinstated.”\n\nA league source told CSNNE.com Thursday night that Wallace will give the Celtics some consideration, but “he’s going to look at all his options” before making any decision. From the C’s standpoint, adding Wallace would involve releasing a player with the Celtics roster now at 15 players with the recent addition of Mickael Pietrus. Rookie center Greg Stiemsma might wind up being the odd man out if Wallace returns. The only player kept around from the group of training camp invitees, Stiemsma’s contract won’t become fully guaranteed until next month.\n\nIn a limited role, several GMs told Yahoo! they still believe his scoring and defending ability would probably be better than anyone else available to them. One NBA GM with potential interest in signing Wallace said, “I’d be worried about his conditioning in a condensed season.” In his 15 seasons with Washington, Portland, Atlanta, Detroit and Boston, Wallace averaged 14.6 points and 6.7 rebounds.\n\nIn the following season, Wallace threw the towel at Sabonis during a timeout of a game against the Lakers. Sabonis had accidentally smacked Wallace’s face earlier when he collided in the post with O’Neal. “Under normal circumstances, he’d have probably knocked his head into next year,” Doucette said. “I don’t think you want to challenge Arvydas. But he kept his cool because he knew that if he didn’t, that team would come apart right there. He did a marvelous job of remaining composed.” Walton, who was broadcasting the game nationally, still feels remorse over the incident. “It was one of the lowest moments of my life,” he said. “If I was any kind of a man, I would have got up from that broadcast table and walked across the court and punched Rasheed Wallace in the nose. But I let Sabonis and the game of basketball and the human race down that day.”\n\nWallace declined an opportunity to talk about what he liked about the summer league, but if his actions are any indication, he appears to be in his element. Before his game Tuesday, Wallace watched 751 South play CEO Munny. When CEO Munny’s Will Burton tried a one-handed slam off the rebound of a missed free throw, Wallace started hopping around, excited by what Burton nearly pulled off. During the game between Wallace’s Sheraton Imperial and Next Level Custom (who had former N.C. State standout Josh Powell on its roster), Wallace was largely content to take long-range 3s on the offense end while trying to guard Powell on defense.\n\nDressed in grey sweats and a grey Philadelphia Phillies hat pulled low on his head, Rasheed Wallace found a spot behind the scorers’ table at the Greater NC Pro-Am and settled in. If the former North Carolina star was doing his best to look inconspicuous, it wasn’t long before he was smacking hands with just about everybody who walked by. Later in the night, he got up and patted the backs of the volunteers on press row and wandered over to one of the benches, playfully tapping a player on the shoulder. Before that player could turn around completely, Wallace scurried off to the corner."
