        "text": "The signing of free agent Rasheed Wallace for two seasons will cost the Boston Celtics about $12 million.\n\nThat deal, which became official on Wednesday afternoon, is not the only financial matter concerning the Celtics this week.\n\nWhen the NBA calculated the figures from the 2008-09 season, it was determined that the Celtics are one of seven teams who will be paying a luxury tax.\n\nAccording to Yahoo Sports, the Celtics owe nearly $8.3 million because they were over the league’s luxury tax limit of $71.15 million last season. They join the New York Knicks ($23.7 million), Dallas Mavericks ($23.6 million), Cleveland Cavaliers ($13.7 million), Los Angeles Lakers ($7.1 million), Portland Trail Blazers ($5.8 million) and Phoenix Suns ($4.9 million).\n\nThe luxury tax limit will be dropping to $69.92 million for the 2009-10 season with the salary cap going from $58.68 million to $57.7 million.\n\nThat means the Celtics will be paying again next year since their salary total is already in the $75 million range for ’09-10. Paul Pierce and Ray Allen will make $19.7 million each and Kevin Garnett’s salary is going to be $16.4 million.\n\nGiven the revenue projections for the upcoming season, the salary cap and luxury tax will be reduced even more for the 2010-11 season as well.\n\nWallace, 34, who will be introduced to the media this afternoon at the team’s training headquarters in Waltham, agreed to terms last weekend. He will receive the mid-level salary exception, which has been set at $5,854,000 for next season.\n\n“We are ecstatic to be able to add a player the caliber of Rasheed Wallace to our team,’’ said Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge in a statement. “It is not every day that you can add a four-time All-Star and a player with championship experience.’’\n\nWallace, who has averaged 15 points, 6.9 rebounds and 1.3 blocked shots in 14 seasons, is one of 13 players to appear in the postseason 13 straight years.\n\nComcast SportsNet and WEEI radio will be carrying the Wallace press conference live today beginning at 4 p.m. Ainge and Coach Doc Rivers will be joining Wallace.\n\nCelts lose to Thunder\n\nThe Celtics fell to 1-2 in the Orlando Pro Summer League on Wednesday when they lost to the Oklahoma City Thunder, 94-82.\n\nThe Celtics, who play the Indiana Pacers tonight, were led by J.R. Giddens with 16 points and Chris Lofton with 15."
