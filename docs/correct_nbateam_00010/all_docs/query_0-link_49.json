        "text": "A name familiar to basketball fans in North Carolina will be leading the Jordan High School boys basketball team next season.\n\nRasheed Wallace, former UNC basketball player and longtime NBA player, will take over the program for Kim Annas.\n\nWallace, originally from Philadelphia, was one of the top high school recruits in the country from the Class of 1993. He played for Dean Smith and the Tar Heels for two seasons before being drafted in the first round by the Washington Bullets, now the Wizards, with the fourth overall pick.\n\nThe Bullets kept Wallace for one season before he was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers where he played from 1996 through 2004 when he was traded to the Detroit Pistons.\n\nIn 2004, Wallace helped the Pistons win the NBA title in five games against the Lakers. The Pistons lost in the NBA Finals the following season, but Wallace remained with the Pistons through 2008.\n\nLate in his career, Wallace played one season with the Boston Celtics in 2009-2010, then played with the New York Knicks in 2012-2013 before retiring.\n\n\"Kim Annas will always be a Falcons. We wish him and his family the best as he nears his retirement, and we sincerely wish he will remain in touch after his transition as we consider him a member of our Falcon family,\" Jordan Principal Susan Taylor said.\n\nThis past season, Jordan's boys basketball team was 7-17 overall and 1-9 in the Tri-6 4A Conference."
