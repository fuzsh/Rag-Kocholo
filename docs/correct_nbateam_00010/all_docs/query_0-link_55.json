        "text": "A Celtics delegation, spearheaded by the Big Three, met with Rasheed Wallace this afternoon in Detroit, according to two well-placed league sources close to the negotiations, and offered the free agent center a contract.\n\nAccording to both sources, the C’s have offered Wallace a two-year contract for the $5.8 million mid-level exception. Danny Ainge, the team’s executive director of basketball operations, Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen, Paul Pierce, coach Doc Rivers and co-owner Wyc Grousbeck were all on hand for the Celtics.\n\nGarnett, long a Wallace admirer, has reportedly jumped into the process as a passionate recruiter – clearly stirred by what the 7-footer can contribute with his shooting touch and capable defense. Pierce and Allen, who in the past have played a role in signing such free agents as P.J. Brown, have also lent their influence to the situation.\n\nThe sit-down was said to be part of a series of meetings being set up with all of the teams interested in signing the free agent power forward/center. The San Antonio Spurs and the Cleveland Cavaliers — who introduced Shaquille O’Neal as their latest addition today — were also expected to meet with Wallace.\n\nThough Wallace is fielding these pitches relatively early in the free agency process, teams have been warned that he may take some time before making a decision.\n\n“I get the feeling that this is going to take some time,” said one of the sources. “People who make commitments this early sometimes make mistakes.”\n\nThe Celtics, thanks to Wallace’s friendship with Garnett, are an attractive destination for the former Piston, though all of his reported suitors are contenders.\n\nWith Wallace clearly Plan A for the C’s, the rest of the field is apparently Plan B. Their interest in Grant Hill, for instance, is said to be of a low priority while the Celtics still have a chance of signing Wallace.\n\nConsidering that Wallace is expected to command the full mid-level exception, further free agent signings by the Celtics would be limited to the veteran’s minimum of $1.9 million.\n\nIndeed, Ainge spoke highly of a minimum contract signing earlier this week when he said, “sometimes those are the players who work out the best.”"
