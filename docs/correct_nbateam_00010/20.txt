BOSTON (AP) â€” The Boston Celtics have signed veteran forward Rasheed Wallace, one of this year's most coveted free agents.

Boston announced the move Wednesday, the first day teams were allowed to sign free agents.

Terms of the deal were not released. Wallace earned $13.68 million last season as he finished up a five-year contract with Detroit.

The 35-year-old Wallace, a four-time All-Star, can play the low post and has exceptional shooting range. He averaged 12 points per game for the Pistons last year.

Celtics general manager Danny Ainge said the team was "ecstatic" to add a player with Wallace's talent and championship experience. He won a title with Detroit in 2004.
