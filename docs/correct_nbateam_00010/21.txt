Last summer Boston needed to do something, anything, to try and prop the championship window open a little longer. Rasheed Wallace was something. A guy with title pedigree, who maybe could join the fountain-of-youth-gang in Boston and give them one more big run. At least that was the dream.

Of course, if the team fell short Wallace became an obvious scapegoat.

Even before the season, the goals for the team were unreasonably lofty. ESPN’s Bill Simmons does not speak for all Celtics fans, but he was part of the bar-setting going on back before the season.

So all they had to do was win about 67 games and be in line for a title? Totally fair. They just had to win more games than the 2008 title Celtics team (66). By the way, since the 2000-01 season there has been one 67-win team, Dallas the year they got knocked out in the first round. So very reasonable standards.

Which, of course, the aging Celtics did not meet. Ray Allen got cold, Kevin Garnett got slow and Rasheed was Rasheed. They aren’t going to get to 54 wins.

Fans are frustrated, and Wallace gets to be the scapegoat.

Simmons teed it off with a column this week:

The best/worst part (depending on your feelings about the Celtics) is Wallace has two more years on his deal after this one.

That led Zach Lowe of Celtics Hub to ask the real question:

Desperate times lead to desperate signings. This was a desperation move by the Celtics that has worked out like every level-headed observer would have guessed. Sheed is on the downhill side and the decline is picking up speed. The Celtics ignored the signs.

The only silver lining is Boston fans will have him to scapegoat for a couple more years.
