From analogue media such as wax cylinders and records made of shellac or vinyl to the world of digital sound recordings – a tour of the German Music Archive at the German National Library will introduce you to the whole spectrum of music playback devices.\n\nAlong with the music exhibition “From Edison Cylinder to Blu-ray”, we will also show you the music reading room and our soundproof listening booth.\n\nTo the exhibition\n\nInformation and contact\n\nThe tours are available to groups of between seven and 20 people.

The permanent exhibition of the German Museum of Books and Writing provides a brief history of human media based on the three media innovations.\n\nThe exhibition extends an open invitation to explore earlier forms of communication, memory and writing systems, \"old\" book forms and \"worlds of reading\". It documents censorship, showcases masterly examples of book art and addresses the rapid pace of media development in the 20th century.\n\nTo the exhibition\n\nSubject survey\n\nWould you rather explore a specific topic in media history in greater depth? If so, bring your group to one of our focal tours, each lasting around one hour.\n\nMedia history through a magnifying glass\n\nFive objects from the permanent collection will be used to guide you through media history in the blink of an eye. The tour of discovery begins with a tally stick, takes a look at censored comics, car license plates and the Brockhaus encyclopaedia, and ends with images of a futuristic media world. It conveys an impression of the profundity of the cultural revolution that took place with the invention of writing: the exchange of knowledge, opinions and feelings beyond all constraints of time and space. If required, the guided tour can also take the form of a dialogue.\n\nHands-on history of books\n\nOn this tour of various stages of the permanent exhibition, historic books, materials like parchment or papyrus and writing utensils that you can touch and grasp give an instructive insight into the history of books from their beginnings to the present day.\n\nBanned and burned – Censorship in book history\n\nThe long arm of censorship has stretched across all eras and all aspects of literature production. From the Index librorum prohibitorum through the book burnings in the “Third Reich” to camouflaged publications issued in the recent past. The cases of censorship documented in the permanent exhibition reveal the full extent of the bans and countermeasures.\n\nWriting worlds\n\nFor more than 5,000 years now people have been recording their messages, their knowledge and thoughts using written signs and scripts. The guided tour of the permanent exhibition uses a selection of objects ranging from tally sticks through tattooing machines to car license plates to show how information is disseminated through writing.\n\nCoded World – Between Cave-Painting and Unicode\n\nAll forms of writing are based on images. But when and how does an image become a written character? When, how and why do scripts develop? How can a computer distinguish between text and images? These and similar questions are answered during a leisurely tour of the permanent exhibition of the German Museum of Books and Writing at the German National Library.\n\nInformation and contact\n\nThe tours are available to groups of between four and 20 people.\n\nBooking/appointments\n\nMake an appointment for a group tour:\n\nPhone + 49 341 2271-324\n\nThe group tours are held during the museum's opening hours: Tuesday to Sunday 10 am to 6 pm, Thursday 10 am to 8 pm and public holidays 10:00 to 18:00.

A guided tour of the Cultural History Collection’s stacks in the German Museum of Books and Writing at the German National Library will give you and your group the opportunity to get acquainted with an array of unusual objects.\n\nCome and explore our technical holdings repository on the guided tour “Depot Whispers”. The room, which is five metres in height, contains a wide variety of machinery and equipment used for paper-making, book-binding and printing.
