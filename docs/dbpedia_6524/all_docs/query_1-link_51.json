        "text": "To call a German landline number from the US, dial the US country code, German country code, local area code, and your desired landline number.\n\n1. Dial the US exit code, i.e., ‘011’ or “+” on mobile. It ensures you are making an international call.\n\n2. Input the Germany country code, i.e., ‘49’. It routes your US telephonic network towards Germany.\n\n3. Enter the specific area code for the city or region you want to connect within Germany.\n\n4. Finally, dial your desired landline number.\n\nNote: You omit “0” from the area code as you’re making an international call. For instance, while calling Berlin (030), Germany from the US, you dial 011-49-30-XXX-XXXXX or +49-30-XXX-XXXXX.\n\nTo call a German mobile number from the US, simply dial the US exit code, German country code, and local mobile number in Germany. You do not need to dial a city or area code for mobiles.\n\nStep one: Dial the US exit code, i.e., “011,” directing your call outside the US.\n\nStep two: Key in the Germany country code, i.e., “49.” It routes your call to Germany telephone network.\n\nStep three: Dial the German mobile number you’re trying to reach.\n\nThe calling cost to Germany from a US phone number depends on your telephone service provider. While the typical rate is around $3 per minute, frequent or lengthy calls can quickly become costly.\n\nIt’s ideal to clarify the call rates with your service provider for ideas on your potential bill. Some providers may offer specialized plans that include discounts or flat rates for international calls. These plans can offer a more economical solution, especially for those needing regular calls.\n\nGermany operates in one time zone, Central European Time (CET), while the US spans six primary time zones.\n\n1. Eastern Standard Time (EST) to CET: Germany is typically 6 hours ahead of the Eastern Standard Time zone. For example, if it’s 2 PM in New York, it’s 8 PM in Berlin.\n\n2. Central Standard Time (CST) to CET: Germany is 7 hours ahead of the Central Standard Time zone. If it’s 2 PM in Chicago, it's 9 PM in Berlin.\n\n3. Mountain Standard Time (MST) to CET: Germany is 8 hours ahead of the Mountain Standard Time zone. When it’s 2 PM in Denver, it’s 10 PM in Berlin.\n\n4. Pacific Standard Time (PST) to CET: Germany is 9 hours ahead of the Pacific Standard Time zone. So, 11 PM in Berlin translates to 2 PM in Los Angeles.\n\n5. Alaska Standard Time (AKST) to CET: Germany is 10 hours ahead of the Alaska Standard Time zone. For instance, when it’s 2 PM in Anchorage, it’s midnight in Berlin.\n\n6. Hawaii-Aleutian Standard Time (HAST) to CET: Germany is 11 hours ahead of the Hawaii-Aleutian Standard Time zone. If it’s 2 PM in Honolulu, it’s 1 AM the next day in Berlin.\n\nCalling Germany from the US is effortless; you just need to dial the correct sequence of dialing codes - US exit codes, German country codes, area codes, and local phone numbers. You don’t need to put the area code if calling a mobile number.\n\nCalilio offers virtual phone numbers from 100+ countries, including Germany.
