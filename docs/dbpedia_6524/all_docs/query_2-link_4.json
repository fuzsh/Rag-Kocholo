It is usually 2 to 5 digits long and begins with a leading zero (0). Different cities and regions have different Germany dialing codes.\n\nLocal Prefix (Ortsnetzkennzahl): Following the area code, there is a local Germany prefix, which is also known as the network destination code. This part of the number helps route the call to a specific local exchange or telephone network.\n\nSubscriber Number: The last part is the subscriber number, which is a unique combination of digits assigned to an individual phone line within the area and network destination code.\n\nHere’s a German phone number example of landline:\n\n(030) 1234 5678\n\nIn this example,\n\n“030” is the area code for Berlin.\n\n“1234” is the local prefix.\n\n“5678” is the subscriber number.\n\nKeep in mind that when calling a German landline number from within Germany, you generally dial the complete number, including the leading zero.\n\nHowever, when you dial German mobile phone numbers from outside Germany, you need to omit the leading zero and include the country code (+49 for Germany) before the area code and local prefix.
