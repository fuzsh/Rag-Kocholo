        "text": "The crest with its retrograde inversion initials proved that the chest was Bach’s, and it’s apparently the only piece of Bach’s furniture of which we can be sure. And I believe understanding that Bach’s obsession with codes extended even to marking his property makes an even stronger case for Bradley Lehman’s assertion that the doodle on the cover page of the Well Tempered Clavier coded Bach’s preferred tuning method. (Read my blog “Bach’s Incredible Google-Doodle”)\n\nThe Cantata Cycle Mystery\n\nSo I did not discover a page of a missing Bach cantata while in Leipzig. Drat. But from my visit to the Bach Museum, I gather scholars are trying to find those pages themselves. In the small town of Ronnenberg, researchers determined that a student of one of Bach’s students (Tobias Krebs) had a library collection (now lost) of 51 J.S. Bach cantatas—the largest collection of Bach manuscripts outside Leipzig.\n\nWhile Haydn and Beethoven both regarded Handel supreme, they had little or no knowledge of Bach’s vocal music. They did not know the St. Matthew Passion, the B Minor Mass, and the cantatas. Surely their assessment of Bach would have changed had they known this music. After all, Mozart spent just a few days studying Bach and his music was never the same afterwards! C.P.E. Bach stated that his father had written five full year cycles of cantatas for all the Sundays and feast days. So how many Bach masterpiece cantatas are missing? 25? 50? 100? 250? The first two full years of Sunday cantatas in 1723 and 1724 survive intact. Just that pace of composition alone is remarkable. The Bach-Archiv claims as its greatest treasure the 44 original part sets for Bach’s second cantata cycle (1724-1725). The third cantata cycle beginning 1725 also survives, though incomplete. If C.P.E. Bach was accurate, then the world is still missing a great number of his father’s cantatas.\n\nYou can read more about the cantatas in this superb online guide:\n\nThe Cantatas of Johann Sebastian Bach: A Listener and Student Guide by Julian Mincham\n\nDid you too grow up reading stories about Bach cantatas being used as wrapping paper in the fish market after his death? That myth of ultimate composer neglect always stirred me deeply. Surely it's a myth! Or is it? How does one explain so much missing music? It’s interesting that the Bach Museum makes no mention of the deteriorating relationship Bach had with the Leipzig authorities, especially in his later years, a point his biographies make emphatic. Leipzig was searching for a new cantor well before Bach died. And after his death, Bach’s music attracted scant interest. We know C.P.E. Bach had The Art of the Fugue engraved on copper plates, yet later sold the plates as scrap for lack of buyers. Some of Bach’s music could have been discarded from disinterest, as in the famous case of the Brandenburg Concertos, not performed until a hundred years after Bach’s death.\n\nSome scholars insist that there is no missing music, that Bach adapted previous works for the last two years of Sunday cycles, or that C.P.E. was thinking of earlier cantatas before Leipzig as part of this collection. At the current pace of discovery in Bach scholarship, perhaps we’ll have an answer to that soon.\n\nThe mystery of the missing cantatas remains open, and it inspires us to contemplate the larger preposterous but actual ethos: but for a sliver-of-a-chain of music lovers and composers extending from C.P.E. Bach from 1750 to Felix Mendelssohn in 1829—who insisted to a skeptical public that Johann Sebastian’s music was important—we would not have this Bach’s music in our world today.\n\nThe Grand Musical Conversation\n\nSo if you haven't already, I highly recommend you take your own odyssey to composer residences. In this trip, I visited eight of them— Haydn’s in Eisenstadt, Mozart’s in Vienna and Prague, Beethoven’s in Heiligenstadt, Dvorak’s in Prague (actually a museum, not a home), Wagner’s in Zürich and Lucerne, and Mendessohn’s, Schumann’s, and Bach’s in Leipzig. These visits absolutely brought me closer to their music and their lives. The style of their manuscripts, the setup of their studies, their choice of home decor and furniture, their correspondence, their business papers, and the friends that visited all come together to make them feel contemporary to us with our own lives and concerns. They had many of the same distractions, bills, and crises we all experience. They also liked to take breaks, enjoy time in nature, sought good company, looked to other people for inspiration, and spent a lot of time alone.\n\nWhat comes across as extraordinary with all of them, though, is their burning intensity, not just for music, but everything. Mendelssohn’s creativity pours out of him into painting, sketching, and social change as well as composition, performance, and conducting. Haydn’s humor and interest in personal motivation has him framing his short vocal settings of various homilies on his wall. Bach isn’t content to place all his contrapuntal codes in his music, it must extend even to the way he personally marks his property. All these composers expressed their characters and what they cared about so beautifully in all sorts of media.\n\nAbove all, their music manuscripts, despite having different styles, uniformly show an extraordinary degree of detail and care. They show keen awareness of the tradition they draw from and continue/elaborate/extend in their own style. It is as if the composers through their scores are speaking to each other and forward to us in our precise time with their writing. By viewing and hearing these scores, we have the breathtaking experience of hearing a grand musical conversation about the human experience that extends through the ages."
