        "text": "To call Germany from the U.S., just follow these simple dialing directions:\n\nFirst dial 011, the U.S. exit code.\n\nNext dial 49, the country code for Germany.\n\nThen dial the area code (2-5 digits).\n\nFnally, dial the phone number (3-9 digits).\n\nNeed more help calling Germany?\n\nIf your call isn‘t going through, watch out for these common dialing errors:\n\nBlocked international calls\n\nMany phone service providers offer the option to block international calling or even have it as a default. Check this setting before trying to place a direct international call.\n\nMobile numbers without area codes\n\nArea codes shouldn‘t be added to international cell phone numbers. Cell phone numbers in most countries also have an allocated starting digit that isn‘t used for landlines.\n\nDrop the trunk code\n\nIf the number you are dialing starts with zero, you must drop this first digit. The zero is called a “trunk code” and is used when calling within certain countries.\n\nFor example, if the number you are calling is 021 XXXX XXXX:\n\nthe wrong way to dial from the U.S. is 011 + 49 + 021 XXXX XXXX\n\nthe right way to dial from the U.S. is 011 + 49 + 21 XXXX XXXX\n\nVoIP (Internet phone) connections\n\nSome VoIP service providers allow you to skip dialing 011 before placing an international call. If this feature is turned on, just leave out the 011 U.S. exit code.\n\nHere is a list of major Germany area codes and city calling codes."
