The Deutsche Bibliothek in Frankfurt am Main, now a federal institution with legal capacity under public law, becomes the Federal Republic’s central archive library.

The association’s members provide their works published in exile for collection in the library. This eventually gives rise to the German Exile Archive 1933–1945.\n\n1947\n\nThe Deutsche Bibliothek is legally decreed an institution of the book trade and the City of Frankfurt am Main. Professor Hanns Wilhelm Eppelsheimer becomes its first director.\n\n1946\n\nDr. Georg Kurt Schauer, Heinrich Cobet, Vittorio Klostermann and Professor Hanns Wilhelm Eppelsheimer initiate the new foundation of a German archive library based in Frankfurt am Main.

The City of Frankfurt guarantees personnel and financial support and the American military government gives its approval. On 4 November, the library officially receives the name “Deutsche Bibliothek” (“German Library”) and begins its work in the former Rothschild Library at Untermainkai.\n\nThis means that two libraries now exist in Germany that function as national libraries for what later becomes the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.

The library becomes an institution with legal capacity under public law.\n\n1935\n\nAn order from the Reich Chamber of Culture obligates the associations, publishers and individuals under its jurisdiction to submit their works to the Deutsche Bücherei.\n\n1933\n\nThe Deutsche Bücherei, which has hitherto been part of the Reich Ministry of the Interior, is taken over by the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda. Departments overseen by the NSDAP are created to monitor the measures for enforced cultural and intellectual conformity. Banned and ‘undesirable’ literature, such as exile literature, is withdrawn from general use.\n\n1931\n\nThe “German National Bibliography” in the series A (new publications from the publishers’ book trade) and B (new publications from outside the publishers’ book trade) is published for the first time.\n\n1924\n\nDr. Heinrich Uhlendahl becomes the new director of the Deutsche Bücherei. He holds this office until his death in 1954.\n\n1921\n\nThe Börsenverein der Deutschen Buchhändler zu Leipzig tasks the Deutsche Bücherei with managing the “Daily index of new publications” and the “Weekly index of new and prepared publications from the publishers’ book trade”.\n\n1917\n\nProfessor Georg Minde-Pouet assumes the directorship of the Deutsche Bücherei.\n\n1916\n\nConstructed during the war years from 1914 to 1916, the prestigious building of the Deutsche Bücherei at Deutscher Platz is formally inaugurated on 2 September.\n\n1913\n\nThe Deutsche Bücherei begins operating from its offices in the Deutsches Buchhändlerhaus. The City of Leipzig and the Kingdom of Saxony provide funds for staffing and material costs. The Börsenverein agrees to provide the legal deposit copies from the publishing companies free of charge. Dr. Gustav Wahl is appointed as director and plays a key role in building the Deutsche Bücherei’s new premises and organising its collections up until 1916."
