        "text": "How do I get my IdNo\n\nHave you not received your IdNo yet or cannot find it?\n\nYou can usually find your IdNo in the following documents:\n\nin your income tax assessment,\n\non your employment tax statement or\n\nin the informational letter from the federal central tax office. This letter was sent to you by your tax office in October or November 2011 to inform you about the stored electronic wage tax deduction information (ELStAM).\n\nIf you cannot find your IdNo in the documents mentioned above, you have the option of requesting it using the Federal Central Tax Office input form or by letter. Please understand that the IdNo can only be communicated to you through the mail for data protection reasons. The IdNo can be sent to an address that does not correspond to your registered address only with your written letter of authority (by letter and with a copy of a valid personal ID).\n\nYou can also submit your income tax return to your tax office without an IdNo. Your tax office is aware of this fact.\n\nGeneral\n\nThis identification number is assigned for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person in administrative proceedings. For example, the identification number enables the tax administration to provide services, such as a pre-filled tax return form provided on an electronic basis, or the automated processing of electronic receipts.\n\nThe use of this and any data stored to this end are subject to purpose limitation in accordance with Section 139b of the German Fiscal Code (AO). Improper use constitutes an administrative offence for which a fine may be imposed.\n\nThe data remains stored in the database until it is no longer required for the fulfilment of the underlying legal tasks. This will be deleted no later than 20 years after the end of the calendar year in which the person concerned died.\n\nThe BZSt stores the following data for the identification number of a natural person in accordance with Section 139b (3) German Fiscal Code (AO):\n\nIdentification number\n\nBusiness identification numbers\n\nLast name\n\nFormer names\n\nFirst name\n\nDoctoral degree\n\nDate and place of birth\n\nGender\n\nCurrent or last known address\n\nCompetent tax authorities\n\nInformation blocks according to the Federal Registration Act (Bundesmeldegesetz)\n\nDate of death\n\nDay of move in/move out\n\nNationality\n\nDate of last administrative contact (month, year)\n\nIn addition, the BZSt stores the IBAN (and in the case of foreign credit institutions, also the BIC) of a natural person in accordance with Section 139b (10) German Fiscal Code (AO), in order to enable the non-cash payment of benefits from public funds, Section 139b (3a) German Fiscal Code (AO). More information can be found at https://www.bzst.de/DE/Privatpersonen/IBAN/IBAN_node.html.\n\nFor the purpose of providing employers with automatically retrievable wage tax deduction data, the BZSt also stores additional reporting data for each taxpayer in accordance with Section 39e (2) of the Income Tax Act (EStG). This concerns reporting data:\n\npertaining to religious affiliation\n\npertaining to a personâ€™s marital status under registration law; in the case of married or partnered taxpayers, the identification number of the spouse / partner is also stored\n\npertaining to the identification numbers of minors, provided they are registered in the same municipality as the taxpayer.\n\nSample notification letter (English)\n\nPDF, 479KB, File meet accessibility standards\n\nSample notification letter (English)\n\nSample notification letter (German)\n\nPDF, 53KB, File meet accessibility standards\n\nSample notification letter (German)\n\nDownloads\n\nInformational brochure\n\nPDF, 397KB, File meet accessibility standards\n\nInformational brochure from the Federal Ministry of FinanceNationwide identification number for taxpayersProcedure as per Section 139b of the Fiscal Code\n\nGeneral ruling\n\nPDF, 38KB, File meet accessibility standards\n\nGeneral ruling of the Federal Ministry of Finance dated 22 July 2013"
