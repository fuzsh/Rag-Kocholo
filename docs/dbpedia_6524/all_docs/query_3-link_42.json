        "text": "Book car rental in Leipzig and explore a city that’s equally steeped in Germanic history and experiencing a youthful modern revival.\n\nNestled between the powerhouse cities of Berlin and Dresden, Leipzig is a great base to explore East Germany and see more of a side of the country once hidden behind the Iron Curtain. Equally, there’s plenty here to keep you entertained if you’re not planning to leave the city limits, with local attractions such as the Leipzig Zoo and Riverside Forest must sees for visitors.\n\nIf you’re arriving by plane, we have a convenient pick up location at Leipzig/Halle airport, a 20-minute drive from the city center, so you’ll be in your vehicle and exploring the best of what the city has to offer in no time at all.\n\nCar rental in Leipzig is easy with Hertz, and you’ll have plenty of choice of vehicles – including comfortable SUVs for all the family and sportier cars for those who want to get out and explore. Our Green Collection is ideal for Leipzig’s low emissions zone too.\n\nFrom classical composers and centuries-old architecture, to forward-thinking arts and an influx of young creatives, there’s plenty to love in Leipzig.\n\nDriving in Leipzig\n\nLeipzig is a low emissions zone to help reduce air pollution in the city center. This means if you want to travel around the area, you’ll need a rental car with low emissions and a green sticker in the window.\n\nWhen driving around Leipzig, you’ll be sharing the road with the city’s tram network. You’ll need to wait behind the tram if it stops to let passengers off – and make sure you only overtake if you can see all passengers have disembarked and are off the road.\n\nMotorists drive on the right in Germany – just like at home.\n\nParking in Leipzig\n\nThere are plenty of parking garages and lots dotted around Leipzig. The city also offers a popular Park and Ride scheme, which connects parking lots to tram stops. The Park and Ride scheme is recommended if you’re travelling to events at the Red Bull Arena or Arena Leipzig – as public parking is not available here.\n\nFor parking in the center, Q-Park Marktgalerie Tiefgarage (Thomasgasse 2, 04109) is well located, next to St. Thomas Church.\n\nIf you’re heading for a day at the zoo, Parkhaus Zoo (Parthenstraße 8, 04105) is conveniently just across the street.\n\nDriving routes Leipzig\n\nMain routes into Leipzig\n\nLeipzig sits at the center of Germany’s autobahn network – so it’s very well connected and opens the country up for exploration. The A9 to the west, the A14 to the north, and the A38 to the south all serve Leipzig, connecting it to some of the larger cities nationwide.\n\nLeipzig to Berlin\n\nDepending on traffic, you can reach Berlin from Leipzig in roughly two hours. Heading north out of Leipzig, get on the A14 and join the A9 after Leipzig/Halle airport. Take the A9 and A115, following signs for Berlin. At the 1-Dreieck Funkturm junction, use the right lanes and to follow signs for A100 towards Hamburg/Wedding. This will bring you into the west of the city.\n\nThings to do in Leipzig\n\nThe old town hall and market\n\nLeipzig’s original town hall, built in 1556, now serves as the city museum. Step inside and uncover the history of the city, as well as a true-to-scale model of the surrounding area. The old town hall leads straight out into Leipzig’s market square, which holds a weekly market, a Christmas fare and an annual wine festival.\n\nBach Museum\n\nLeipzig has a special connection with many classical music composers – but perhaps none more so than Bach, who played the organ and directed the boys’ choir at St. Thomas Church. Today, you can head next door to the church to step into a world of Bach. The museum is home to a wide range of artifacts, where you can explore his original manuscripts and rearrange his work in interactive installations.\n\nLeipzig Zoo\n\nAccommodating over 800 species of animals and open 365 days of the year, Leipzig Zoo works hard to maintain the vision of its founder Prof. Dr. Jörg Junhold to be a “zoo of the future”. Perhaps the most striking example of this is the Gondwanaland – an expansive glass-roofed rainforest hall housing 200 exotic animals, where visitors can walk among the tree canopy via rope bridges, and even take a river tour on an artificial canal. It’s the perfect stop off for families on vacation.\n\nBelantis Theme Park\n\nTake your rental car on a drive to the biggest amusement park in East Germany. Here you’ll find fun for all the family, from high intensity rollercoasters to live entertainment for younger children. You can also take a break at two picturesque lakes in the center of the park.\n\nWhere to stay in Leipzig\n\nThe Westin Leipzig\n\nTowering over Leipzig’s main train station, the Westin Leipzig has over 27 floors and arguably one of the best views in the city. The rooms here are as modern as they are stylish, plus there’s a two-Michelin-star restaurant, Falco, on the top floor.\n\nFregehaus Hotel\n\nOccupying a custard-yellow 16th-century townhouse, this charming boutique hotel mixes antique furnishings with modern interiors for a quirky stay. Each of its 20 rooms has a one-of-a-kind feel.\n\nAbito Suites\n\nLocated next to the Gewandhaus concert hall and Leipzig’s opera house, these plush self-contained split-level apartments are sophisticated both inside and out.\n\nBest places to eat in Leipzig\n\nAuerbachs Keller\n\nAuerbach’s cellar is probably best known for being the first place Mephistopheles takes Faust on their travels in the famous Goethe play. Offering traditional Saxon fare in smart surroundings, the cellar is a true Leipzig legend.\n\nMax Enk\n\nClassic meets contemporary at Max Enk. Housed inside the department store Enk, this restaurant has stylishly updated a part of the building with a chic glass ceiling and simple décor. On the menu, you’ll find an internationally inspired dishes using local ingredients.\n\nDankbar Kaffee Leipzig\n\nExperience Leipzig’s younger, cooler edge in this Instagrammable coffee shop which serves popular breakfast dishes, small plates and cakes. Be sure to look up at the original ornate ceiling too."
