        "text": "Information about the processing of your data\n\nIn accordance with Art. 12 of the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter referred to as the GDPR), we are obliged to inform you about the processing of your data when you use our website. We take the protection of your personal data very seriously, and this privacy policy informs you about the details of the processing of your data and about your legal rights in this regard.\n\nWe reserve the right to adapt the privacy policy with future effect, in particular in the event of further development of the website, the use of new technologies or changes to the legal bases or the corresponding case law.\n\nWe recommend that you read this privacy policy from time to time and take a printout or a copy for your documents.\n\nDefinitions\n\n∙ In the following, website means all of the controller’s pages at https://www.lis.school;\n\n∙ personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. A natural person is identifiable if they can be identified, either directly or indirectly, in particular by means of assignment to an identifier such as a name, to an identification number, to location data, to an online identifier or to one or more special features that are an expression of the physical, physiological, genetic, psychological, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. Personal data is therefore, for example, a person’s name, email address and telephone number, but may also include information about preferences, hobbies and memberships;\n\n∙ processing means operations or sets of operations carried out with or without the aid of automated procedures in connection with personal data, such as the collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation, alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment, combination, restriction, erasure or destruction;\n\n∙ pseudonymisation means the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data cannot be attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person;\n\n∙ consent means any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject’s wishes in a particular case by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her; and\n\n∙ Google means Google, Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; reachable in the European Union at: Google Dublin, Google Ireland Ltd., Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, Fax: +353 (1) 436 1001.\n\nScope\n\nThis privacy policy applies to all pages of https://www.lis.school. It does not cover any linked websites of other providers.\n\nResponsible provider\n\nThe following party is responsible for the processing of personal data within the scope of this privacy policy:\n\nLeipzig International School Könneritzstraße 47\n\n04229 Leipzig\n\nhos-office@lis.school\n\nrepresented by:\n\nBrandie Smith/Johannes Barabas\n\nc/o Leipzig International School gGmbH\n\nKönneritzstraße 47\n\n04229 Leipzig\n\nGermany\n\nQuestions about data protection\n\nIf you have any questions about data protection with regard to our company or our website, you can contact our data protection officer:\n\nLeipzig International School, Könneritzstraße 47, 04275 Leipzig, Germany, email: datenschutz@lis.school\n\nor:\n\nSebastian Heinemann\n\nInterner Revisor DIIR\n\nzert. Datenschutzbeauftragter (DSC)\n\nemail: datenschutz@lis.school\n\nPostal address:\n\ndata protection officer\n\nc/o Leipzig International School, Könneritzstrasse 47, 04275 Leipzig\n\nSecurity\n\nWe have taken comprehensive technical and organisational precautions to protect your personal data from unauthorised access, abuse, loss and other external disruption. To this end, we regularly review our security measures and adapt them to current standards.\n\nYour rights\n\nYou have the following rights with regard to the personal data concerning you that you can assert against us:\n\nright of access (Art. 15 GDPR),\n\nright to rectification (Art. 16 GDPR) or erasure (Art. 17 GDPR),\n\nright to restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR),\n\nright to object to processing (Art. 21 GDPR),\n\nright to withdraw your consent (Art. 7(3) GDPR),\n\nright to receive the data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format (‘data portability’) and the right to transfer the data to another controller, if the prerequisites of Art. 20(1) (a) and (b) GDPR are fulfilled (Art. 20 GDPR).\n\nYou can assert your rights by informing us using the contact details specified above under ‘Responsible provider’ or by contacting the data protection officer designated by us.\n\nYou also have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority about our processing of your personal data (Art. 77 GDPR).\n\nUse of the website, access data In principle, you can use our website for purely informational purposes without disclosing your identity. When you access the individual pages of the website in this sense, this only results in access data being transferred to our web hosting service so that the website can be displayed to you. This is the following data:\n\nbrowser type/browser version\n\noperating system used\n\nlanguage and version of the browser software\n\nhostname of the accessing device\n\nIP address\n\nwebsite from which the request comes\n\ncontent of the request (specific page)\n\ndate and time of the server request\n\naccess status/HTTP status code\n\nreferrer URL (website visited before)\n\nvolume of data transferred\n\ntime zone difference from Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)\n\nTemporary processing of the IP address by the system is necessary to make it technically possible to deliver the website to your device. This requires processing of your IP address for the duration of the session. The legal basis for such processing is Art. 6(1) Sentence 1(f) GDPR.\n\nThe access data is not used to identify individual users and is not combined with other data sources. The access data is deleted when it is no longer required for achieving the purpose of its processing. In the case of recording the data to provide the website, this is the case when you end your visit to the website.\n\nIP addresses are stored in log files to ensure the functionality of the website. In addition, the data serves us to optimise the website and to ensure the security of our information technology systems. No evaluation of the data for marketing purposes takes place in this context either. In principal, data is deleted after seven days at the latest; further processing is possible in individual cases. In this case, the IP address is deleted or so transformed that an assignment of the retrieving client is no longer possible.\n\nThe recording of data for the provision of the website and the processing of data in log files is an absolute necessity for the operation of the website. You may object to the processing. In the event that your objection if justified, we will examine the situation and either stop or adjust the data processing or point out to you the compelling legitimate reasons on the basis of which we will continue processing.\n\nCookies In addition to the aforementioned access data, so-called cookies are stored in the internet browser of the device you use to access the website. These are small text files with a sequence of numbers that are stored locally in the cache of the browser used. Cookies do not become part of the device system and cannot execute programs. They serve to make our website user-friendly. The use of cookies may be technically necessary or may occur for other purposes (e.g. analysis/evaluation of website usage).\n\na) Technically necessary cookies\n\nSome elements of our website require that the retrieving browser can be identified even after a page change. This involves processing the following data in the cookies:\n\nlanguage settings\n\nitems in shopping basket\n\nlogin information\n\nThe user data collected by technically necessary cookies is not processed to create user profiles. We also use session cookies, which store a session ID that can be used to assign various requests from your browser to the shared session. Session cookies are required for using the website. In particular, they enable us to recognise the device used when you return to the website. If you have an account with us, we use this cookie to recognise you on subsequent visits to the website; otherwise you would have to log in again each time you visited. The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6(1) Sentence 1(f) GDPR. We use session cookies to make using our website more attractive and effective. Session cookies are deleted as soon as you log out or close your browser.\n\nYou can object to the processing of your data by cookies. Most browsers are preset to automatically accept cookies. You can disable or restrict the transfer of cookies by changing the settings in your internet browser. Cookies that have already been saved can be deleted at any time. This can also be done automatically. If cookies are disabled for our website, it may no longer be possible to use the full functionality of the website.\n\nb) Technically non-essential cookies\n\nIn addition, we also use cookies on the website which enable an analysis of users’ surfing behaviour. For example, this involves processing the following data in the cookies:\n\nentered search terms\n\nfrequency of page views\n\nuse of website functions\n\nThese cookies are used to make using the website more efficient and attractive. The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6(1) Sentence 1(f) GDPR. The technically non-essential cookies are automatically deleted after a specified period, which may vary depending on the cookie.\n\nYou can object to the processing of your data by cookies. If you do not wish to use cookies, you have the option of changing your browser settings in order to generally or selectively block the placement of cookies or remove stored cookies. You can also have the corresponding information displayed before a cookie is placed. If you change the browser settings for the use of cookies or disable cookies, the functionality of this website may be restricted.\n\nWhere we integrate cookies from third-party providers into our website, we point this out to you separately below.\n\nc) Flash-Cookies\n\nFurthermore, HTML5 storage objects are used, which are stored on the device you are using (“Flash cookies”). These process the required data independently of the browser used and do not have an automatic expiry date. The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) DSGVO. These cookies are used to make the website more efficient and attractive.\n\nYou can disagree to the processing of your data by cookies. The transmission of Flash cookies cannot be prevented via the browser settings, but by changing the Flash Player settings. If you do not wish to use the Flash cookies, please install an appropriate add-on in your browser, e.g. “Better Privacy” for Mozilla Firefox (https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/betterprivacy/)\n\nYou can also prevent the use of Flash cookies by opening the browser in “private mode”. You can also regularly delete cookies and browser history manually.\n\nd) Cookie-Advice\n\nWhen you visit the website, an information banner informs you about the use of cookies and refers you to this data protection declaration. In this context, there is also a note on how the storage of cookies can be prevented in the browser settings.\n\nHosting We use external hosting services to provide the following services: Infrastructure and platform services, computing capacity, storage resources and database services, security and technical maintenance services. All data necessary for the operation and use of our website will be processed.\n\nWe use external hosting services for the operation of this website. By using external hosting services, we aim to make our website available efficiently and securely. The legal basis for processing is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) DSGVO.\n\nThe collection of data for the provision and use of the website and the processing of data via external web hosts is absolutely essential for the operation of the website. You may object to the processing. In the event of your justified objection, we will examine the situation and either stop or adjust data processing or point out to you our compelling reasons worthy of protection, on the basis of which we will continue processing.\n\nContacting our company When contacting our company, e.g. by email or using the contact form, the support form or a feedback tool on the website, the personal data provided by you will be processed by us so that we can respond to your enquiry.\n\nIn order for us to process enquiries submitted via the contact form on the website, it is essential that you provide a name or pseudonym and a valid email address. At the moment when you submit the message to us, the following data, among others, will also be processed:\n\nIP address\n\ndate/time of registration\n\nThe legal basis for the processing is Art. 6(1) Sentence 1(f) GDPR and Art. 6(1) Sentence 1(b) GDPR, if the contact is made with the intention of concluding a contract.\n\nProcessing the personal data from the form allows us to process the contact you make with us. Where you contact us by email, this also constitutes the necessary legitimate interest in the processing of the data. The other personal data processed during the submission process serves to prevent any misuse of the contact form and to ensure the security of our information technology systems.\n\nThe data will not be transmitted to third parties in this context. As soon as processing is no longer necessary, we delete the data generated in this context or, if statutory retention obligations apply, restrict processing of the data.\n\nYou have the possibility to object to the processing of your personal data for contact requests at any time. This is the case if processing is not necessary in particular to fulfil a contract with you, which is described by us in the previous description of the functions. In such a case, it may not be possible to continue processing the request. In the event that your objection if justified, we will examine the situation and either stop or adjust the data processing or point out to you the compelling legitimate reasons on the basis of which we will continue processing.\n\nRegistration/password-protected area on the website\n\nIf you wish to use the password-protected area of our website, you must register by providing the following information:\n\nemail address\n\nname\n\npassword chosen by you\n\nFurthermore, the following data is processed at the time of registration:\n\nIP address\n\ndate/time of registration\n\nThe data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer required for achieving the purpose of its processing. This is the case for the data collected during the registration process if the registration on the website is cancelled or modified.\n\nThe following functions are available to you in the password-protected area:\n\nEdit your profile data,\n\nedit your content and\n\nmanage, change or cancel your newsletter subscription.\n\nIf you use the password-protected area of the website, e.g. to edit your profile data or to view orders and bookings made, we also process the data about your person required for the initiation or fulfilment of the contract, in particular address data and information about the payment method. The legal basis for the processing is Art. 6(1) Sentence 1(b) GDPR. The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer required for achieving the purpose of its processing or as soon as there are no legitimate interests preventing its erasure. Due to mandatory commercial and tax regulations, we are obliged to keep your address, payment and order data for a period of ten years.\n\nIf you provided further data voluntarily, we process your data which is not necessary for the initiation or fulfilment of a contract, for as long as you use the area and if you do not delete it yourself beforehand. Our aim in this respect is to optimise the use of the website for you as a user. The legal basis for this is Art. 6(1) Sentence 1(f) GDPR.\n\nYou can object to the processing of the information provided by you voluntarily. You can manage, change or delete your voluntary information yourself at any time in the password-protected area. You are free to take measures in accordance with the ‘Your rights’ section, although if you do have any complaints we request that you first contact our company.\n\nE-Mail-Marketing\n\nAdvertising to existing customers We reserve the right to process the email address provided by you when registering in accordance with the statutory provisions in order to send you the following content by email whilst or after processing the contract, unless you have already objected to this processing of your email address:\n\n∙ further interesting information on events and dates\n\n∙ technical information,\n\n∙ overview of possible leisure activities\n\nThe legal basis for the processing is Art. 6(1) Sentence 1(f) GDPR. We carry out this processing to inform you about important topics and events/dates and to increase our services. We delete your data when you cancel your newsletter subscription, but no later than two years after termination of the contract.\n\nWe would like to point out that you can object to receiving direct advertising at any time without incurring any costs other than the transmission costs according to the basic rates. To do this, click on the unsubscribe link in the newsletter or send us your objection to the contact data provided under ‘Responsible provider’.\n\nIntegration of third-party content\n\nThe website integrates third-party content such as videos, maps, RSS feeds and graphics from other websites. This integration always requires that the providers of this content (“third-party providers”) perceive the IP addresses of users. This is because without the IP address they would not be able to send the content to the browser of the respective user. As such, the IP address is required to display this content.\n\nWe endeavour to only use content from third-party providers who process the IP address solely for delivering the content. We do however have no influence over whether the third-party providers process the IP addresses, e.g. for statistical purposes. If we are aware of such activity, we inform you of this in the following.\n\nSome of the third parties may process data outside the European Union.\n\nYou can object by installing a JavaScript blocker such as the browser plug-in NoScript (www.noscript.net) or disabling JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThis may however result in functional restrictions on the website.\n\nGoogle Fonts We use web fonts provided by Google for the uniform display of fonts. When you retrieve a page, your browser loads the required web fonts into your browser cache in order to display texts and fonts correctly.\n\nFor this purpose, the browser you are using must connect to Google’s servers. By doing so, Google becomes aware that our website has been accessed via your IP address. Our use of Google Fonts is in the interest of a uniform and visually appealing presentation of our online offers. This constitutes a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6(1) Sentence 1(f) GDPR. We have no knowledge of how long Google stores data and have no way of influencing this.\n\nYou can object to the processing by changing your browser settings in such a way that the browser does not support web fonts – although then your device will use a default font.\n\nFor more information about Google Fonts, please refer to https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq and Google’s privacy policy: https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/\n\nIntegration of Google Maps This website also uses the Google Maps service from Google to display maps or sections of maps, thus enabling you to conveniently use the map function on the website.\n\nBy visiting the website, Google receives the information that you have retrieved the corresponding subpage of our website. In addition, the data mentioned under ‘Access data’ is transferred to Google. This occurs regardless of whether Google provides a user account that you are logged in with or no user account exists. If you are logged in to Google, your data will be directly associated with your account. If you do not wish for this data to be associated with your Google profile, you must log out before activating the button.\n\nGoogle stores your data as usage profiles and processes it for purposes of advertising, market research and/or the demand-oriented design of its website. Such analysis takes place in particular (even for users who are not logged in) to provide demand-oriented advertising and to inform other users of the social network about your activities on our website.\n\nThe legal basis for the processing is Art. 6(1) Sentence 1(f) GDPR. The processing serves to make our website more attractive and to offer you additional services. We have no knowledge of how long Google stores data and have no way of influencing this.\n\nYou have the right to object to the processing, although you must contact Google to exercise this right. You can disable or restrict the transfer of cookies by changing the settings in your internet browser. Cookies that have already been saved can be deleted at any time. This can also be done automatically. If cookies are disabled for our website, it may no longer be possible to use the full functionality of the website.\n\nFor more information about the purpose and scope of processing by the plug-in provider, please refer to the provider’s privacy policy. There you will also find further information about your rights in this regard and settings options to protect your privacy: http://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy. Google also processes your personal data in the USA and has subjected itself to the EU-US Privacy Shield, https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework. For more information about the Google Maps terms of use, please refer to https://www.google.com/intl/de_de/help/terms_maps.html.\n\nYouTube videos We use plug-ins from the video platform YouTube.de or YouTube.com on the website, a service operated – represented by Google – by YouTube LLC (headquarters at 901 Cherry Avenue, San Bruno, CA 94066, USA; “YouTube”). Using the plug-ins, we can also include visual content (“videos”) that we have published on Youtube.de and Youtube.com on this website.\n\nThe videos are all in “extended privacy mode”, which means that no data about you as a user will be transferred to YouTube if you do not play the videos. Only when you play the videos, the following data will be transmitted. We have no influence on this data transmission.\n\nBy visiting the website, YouTube receives the information that you have accessed the corresponding subpage of our website. In addition, the data specified in the “Access data” section are transmitted. This is independent of whether YouTube provides a user account through which you are logged in or whether no user account exists. If you are logged in to Google, your information will be directly associated with your account. If you do not wish to be associated with your profile on YouTube, you must log out before activating the button. YouTube stores your data as user profiles and processes them for advertising, market research and/or demand-oriented design of its website. Such an evaluation takes place in particular (even for unlogged-in users) to provide demand-oriented advertising and to inform other users of the Social Network about your activities on our website. Google also processes your personal data in the USA and has submitted itself to the EU-US Privacy Shield, https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework.\n\nThe legal basis for processing is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) DSGVO. The processing serves to make our range of products more attractive and to offer you additional service. We have no knowledge of the storage time on YouTube and have no influence on it.\n\nYou have the right to object to the processing and must contact YouTube to exercise this right. You can deactivate or restrict the transmission of cookies by changing the settings in your Internet browser. Cookies that have already been saved can be deleted at any time. This can also be done automatically. If cookies are deactivated for our website, it may no longer be possible to use all functions of the website in full."
