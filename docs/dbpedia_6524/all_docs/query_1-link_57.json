        "text": "The population in the US is expected to grow 4.7% between 2020 and 2030 or 0.6% per year. Neighborhoods or municipalities with growths above 4.7% for the next 10 years will have a positive effect on the score.\n\nAny growth above 10% should create imbalances between supply and demand in the area creating strong signals for investment opportunities.\n\nVacancy rate is 10.1% in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nLow levels of vacancy rate signals a need for additional units in a market and a difference in supply and demand where demand is most likely not meet.\n\nAffordability indicates the ability of potential homebuyers to afford a home measured in number of years needed to pay a house. Example: Home Price 500,000 / Household Income 100,000 = 5 Years.\n\n3 years or below is affordable, 3.1 to 5.0 is moderate and above 5.1 unaffordable. In 2021 Pittsburgh was 2.7 and San Francisco was 11.8.\n\nHousehold debt can affect the ability of individuals to make mortgage payments, which can impact the foreclosure rate and the number of distressed properties on the market. If a large number of homeowners default on their mortgages, it can lead to an increase in foreclosures and distressed properties, which can put downward pressure on real estate prices."
