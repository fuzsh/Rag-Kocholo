        "text": "After five days, it's done. There are now two 153 square meter advertising spaces on the exterior façade of the Hyperion Hotel Leipzig. They read “UEFA EURO 2024 Leipzig”, “Welcome” in various languages and feature soccer fans of different nationalities. The city of Leipzig has placed the “Host City Dressing” advertising spaces in a prominent position - close to the city center opposite the main train station. “Together with Host City Leipzig, we want to show that soccer fans and people of all nationalities are welcome here,” says Lars Ziegenhorn, Area Manager East of the H-Hotels Group, to which the Hyperion Hotel Leipzig belongs. The hotelier offered the overall project manager of the city of Leipzig for the UEFA EURO, Stefan Schedler, this projection surface for the special welcome.\n\n\"In just a few days, the UEFA EURO 2024 will also start here in Leipzig! In addition to the numerous volunteers who are contributing to the success of this major event, I would like to thank our top management and the Host City project team for their great cooperation and support in preparing for the entire tournament. We are delighted that the Hyperion Hotel, as the official team transfer hotel, also shares our anticipation of the upcoming UEFA EURO 2024, because together we want to celebrate a festival in the heart of Europe that strengthens diversity, team spirit and social cohesion. The realization of this area in the Host City Dressing makes a great contribution to this,” says Stefan Schedler. In addition to soccer fans, other visitors and Leipzig residents, the colorful large images welcome the four European Championship teams, who will be staying at the Hyperion Hotel Leipzig before and after their matches in the Red Bull Arena.\n\nUEFA has booked around half of the 190 hotel rooms for the Czech Republic, France, Italy and one of the round of 16 finalists. “Representatives of the teams have inspected the rooms, other facilities and the routes to the training ground in advance,” says Lars Ziegenhorn. It will not be business as usual at the Hyperion Hotel Leipzig until after the round of 16. To ensure that the footballers have peace and privacy, the hotel building is gated and regular guests must identify themselves at the entrance. The teams have booked some floors, the fitness room and the spa exclusively. “We have converted some suites into additional massage rooms,” says Lars Ziegenhorn.\n\nIn addition, each team has sent chef Kevin Lemser their menu plan for each day. \"Each team brings its own chef. “The one from Italy, for example, prepares his secret recipe for a tomato sauce,” reveals Lars Ziegenhorn. Among his employees, an Italian and a French chef are happy to work for their fellow countrymen. \"We see ourselves as proud representatives of the city of Leipzig. Our entire team is on duty around European Championship matches to make the teams feel at home,” says Lars Ziegenhorn.\n\nThe employees of the Hyperion Hotel Leipzig were already involved in a sustainable European Football Championship project at the beginning of the year: they collected 4,000 euros for the project “With 100,000 trees, we become forest champions” and planted seedlings. The project was initiated by UEFA 2024 ambassador Jörg Junhold together with the City of Leipzig and other partners. The project goal of planting trees for each of Leipzig's four European Championship matches in 2024 has already been achieved in order to make the European Football Championship more sustainable."
