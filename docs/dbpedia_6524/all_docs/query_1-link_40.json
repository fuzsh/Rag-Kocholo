Members will receive an email from the Club Monday morning with a link and promo code to access the pre-sale and receive 10% off their ticket purchase for the first 24 hours.\n\nGeneral Public on Sale Begins on Tuesday, June 18!\n\nTickets for the match for the general public will go on sale on Tuesday, June 18 at 10 a.m. ET by visiting HERE.\n\nRB Leipzig, one of Germanyâs marquee clubs, will be preparing for a follow-up campaign to a strong 2023/24 season in which it finished fourth in the Bundesliga, securing a UEFA Champions League spot for next season.\n\nThe team, which will train at the Florida Blue Training Center ahead of the much-anticipated clash, is led by German head coach Marco Rose, a Leipzig native with years of experience both as a player and a coach. On the pitch, they featured one of the most in form striking partnerships in Europe last season, with Belgian striker LoÃ¯s Openda and Slovenian forward Benjamin Å eÅ¡ko topping the teamâs scoring charts. Additionally, Leipzig also had one of the hottest rising stars in their ranks, with Dutch attacking midfielder Xavi Simons providing the team with creativity and flair.\n\nâWeâre really pleased that weâve been able to organize another part of our US tour after the stop in New York with the Red Bulls. Inter Miami CF are a unique team in the MLS and offer us great opportunities there. Weâve also been able to find an attractive opponent for our next friendly in the form of Wolverhampton Wanderers from the Premier League, and this will be the sporting highlight of the second part of our trip,â said RB Leipzig Chief Business Officer, Johann Plenge.\n\nWolverhampton Wanderers FC, who will be based in the Clubâs Florida Blue Training Center through their 2024 U.S. Tour, return to the United States for the first time in 43 years after a sixth consecutive season in the English top-flight.\n\nThe Premier League side, which is led by head coach Gary OâNeil, features several renowned international stars in their squad, including South Korean striker Hwang Hee-chan, Spanish international midfielder Pablo Sarabia, and Brazilian international duo JoÃ£o Gomes and Matheus Cunha.\n\nâPlaying Leipzig will be a really good test at an important stage of pre-season for us so, along with West Ham and Crystal Palace, weâve got three games of a good standard in the US,â said Wolves' head coach Gary OâNeil. âWeâre going to have a really good base up in Miami â a fantastic training facility, set in a really good area. The facility will help us get some really good work done and weâre excited to meet some of the Wolves fans who live in that part of the world, so it should be a really good trip.â\n\nInter Miami CFâs Chase Stadium and Florida Blue Training Center Continue to Host Top-Level FÃºtbol\n\nThe Clubâs state-of-the-art facilities continue to host some of the worldâs most prominent fÃºtbol teams and players since their opening in 2020. In only a few years, the Florida Blue Training Center and Chase Stadium have hosted reigning FIFA World Cup champions Argentina, LaLiga giants FC Barcelona, the world powerhouse U.S. Womenâs National Team, reigning UEFA Euro champion Italian national team, the Concacaf Gold Cup, and The Beautiful Game by Ronaldinho and Roberto Carlos, among many other standout teams and events."
