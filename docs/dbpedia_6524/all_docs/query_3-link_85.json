        "text": "The RB Leipzig Camps were back in the New York City are for a second time, after the maiden experience of 2022 with the cooperation of New York Red Bulls. More than 200 kids took part into the three camps, two regular and an advanced one, between Whippany and Hoboken. Among the days planned around training and learning activities, a full day was shaped after Dani Olmo.\n\nThe DFL-Supercup hero â who scored a hat-trick last Saturday, brining glory and the trophy to RB Leipzig â shone at the Allianz Arena. His second goal was a mastery of dribbling skills, the same the participants learned to appreciate in the exercise you can see here: a dribbling challenge you can try yourself in training to get closer to the Spanish magician.\n\nRB Leipzig, the NYC Camps and a challenge to discover talents\n\nThe âRBL Soccer Campsâ saw all participants measuring themselves with different session, managing to work the DFB-Pokal winners and their youth ranks coaching staff. A lesson to remember, shaped around the characteristics of the main players â every day had a different angle to enjoy.\n\nA 2 weeks-chance for the club to cement their presence in the USA, contributing at the grassroots development of the American soccer movement. And a way to consolidate the ties with New York Red Bulls, with which the German club had already cooperated in the maiden edition of the camps.\n\nThe new season for RB Leipzig\n\nWhile New York Red Bulls are going through their 2023 season, the DFL-Supercup opened officially the 2023-24 stint for RB Leipzig. A 3-0 away win in Munich meant the third win overall against the Bavarian side, the second away and on a back-to-back â RB Leipzig had already won back in May, when they collected the three points after a 3-1 away win.\n\nNow itâs time for a new season, full of European nights â with the UEFA Champions League, to which RB Leipzig is taking part for the fifth time â and the opening Bundesliga game. A tough start, facing Bayer 04 Leverkusen away. To watch it in the USA, you can tune on ESPN+ at 9:30 am (Eastern time) next Saturday."
