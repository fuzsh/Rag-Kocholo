        "text": "Germany, also known as the Federal Republic of Germany (or ‘Deutschland’ in German) is a country located in Central Europe. Before acquiring its current name, Germany was known as Germania and was a part of the Holy Roman Empire from 900 – 1806 A.D. Today, Germany is the second most popular choice for migrants, after the United States. The capital of Germany is Berlin, its official language is German and it has a population of just over 80 million. The currency used is the Euro (EUR). Between 1949 and 1990, Germany was divided into two countries; the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). In 1961, construction of a wall began to divide the two countries. Germany is remembered for its part is World Wars I and II and its dictator, Adolf Hitler. Those in support of Hitler were known as Nazis. 11 million people were killed in the Holocaust, 6 million of those were Jewish. Hitler killed himself shortly before German was defeated by the Allies in 1945. West Germany was a founding member of the European Union. Germans are known for their food (sausages) and beer. Germans are amongst the biggest beer drinkers in the world. The German flag has been in continuous official use since 1949 and has three horizontal black, red, and gold bands in decreasing order."
