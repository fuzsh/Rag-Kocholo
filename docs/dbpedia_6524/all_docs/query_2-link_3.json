        "text": "Germany’s country code is +49.\n\nGermany is known for its thriving expat population for all good reasons, such as a flourishing economy, world-class education, booming job opportunities, and so on.\n\nIf you want to get in touch with someone in Germany from any other country, there is a certain dialling format that you need to follow. This includes using the right country and area code for Germany. In this blog, we will discuss how to call Germany and various aspects to remember when making international calls.\n\nWhat is the country code for Germany? : Overview\n\nGermany’s country code is +49.\n\nGermany’s country abbreviation (2-digit country code) is DE.\n\nGermany’s 3-digit code is DEU.\n\nGermany country code: What are country codes?\n\nCountry codes play a pivotal role in direct international calling. These are one-, two-, or sometimes three-digit codes that are used as a prefix for the telephone number of that country. While the key purpose of using country dialling codes is to help identify the destination country, they serve many other purposes.\n\nThe history of country codes dates back to the 1960s, when the International Telecom Union, a group of each country’s telecommunication providers, assigned different codes to different areas worldwide. These codes included 1 for the United States of America, 2 for Africa, and 3 and 4 for European countries. As the years passed, these codes were further divided and assigned to each country in the world.\n\nPurpose of country dialling codes\n\nHelps in identifying the country: The main purpose of country codes is to identify the country of the callee. By adding a specific code before the phone number, you indirectly specify the country you are trying to reach. For instance, by adding +91 before a number, you tell the global communication system that you are calling an Indian phone number.\n\nHelps in standardising the international communication format: Assigning a different code to each country helps standardise the cross-country communication system.\n\nRemoves ambiguity: Another purpose of using country codes is to remove ambiguity from the international dialling process since no two countries can have the same code. It helps the network service providers to route the call, text, etc., to the right person or destination.\n\nWhat are Germany area codes?\n\nSimilar to a country code that specifies the destination country, an area code specifies the particular area of the recipient number within the country. In other words, different dialling codes are assigned to different areas/regions of Germany. These area codes are used as prefixes of the Germany country phone code to specify the exact area the recipient number belongs to.\n\nFor example, suppose you want to call a phone number in Berlin, say 1234-5678, from outside Germany. In this case, you need to dial:\n\n+49-30-1234-5678\n\nIn this case, +49 is the country code for Germany, 30 is the area code for Berlin, and 12345678 is the German phone number. Following are the other phone codes for Germany\n\nArea\n\nArea Code\n\nBerlin\n\n30\n\nMunich\n\n89\n\nFrankfurt\n\n69\n\nHamburg\n\n40\n\nDusseldorf\n\n211\n\nAachen\n\n241\n\nBonn\n\n228\n\nAugsburg\n\n821\n\nDortmund\n\n231\n\nChemnitz\n\n371\n\nBielefeld\n\n521\n\nBrandenburg\n\n3381\n\nBremen\n\n421\n\nDresden\n\n351\n\nChemnitz\n\n371\n\nDuisburg\n\n203\n\nEssen\n\n201\n\nBochum\n\n234\n\nGelsenkirchen\n\n209\n\nHannover\n\n511\n\nLeipzig\n\n341\n\nManheim\n\n621\n\nMenz\n\n33083\n\nStuggart\n\n711\n\nNurnberg\n\n911\n\nWiesbaden\n\n611\n\nMunster\n\n6071\n\nWuppertal\n\n202\n\nKoln\n\n221\n\nKarlsruhe\n\n721\n\nDuisburg\n\n203\n\nHow to call Germany from a landline?\n\nStep 1: Enter the international exit code of your country. It is usually ‘00’ or ‘+’.\n\nStep 2: Enter 49, the country code for Germany.\n\nStep 3: Next, enter your recipient’s German city code. For instance, enter 89 for Munich, 69 for Frankfurt and so on.\n\nStep 4: Enter the German number after confirming it is accurate and in service.\n\nStep 5: That’s all. Press the dial button.\n\nHow to call Germany from a cell phone?\n\nStep 1: Enter ‘+’ as the international access code. Alternatively, enter ‘00’.\n\nStep 2: Enter the German country code for the phone, 49.\n\nStep 3: Next, enter the area code of the German recipient. You can refer to the above table to learn about the area code of the German city you are trying to reach.\n\nStep 4: Enter the phone number for Germany and make sure it is correct. If the mobile number has a preceding ‘0’, remove it.\n\nStep 5: Hit the call icon on your cell phone.\n\nHow to call Germany for free?\n\nInternational calls can become costly due to the pricey international calling plans.\n\nBut the good news is, it is possible to call Germany or any other country free of cost. Thanks to VoIP, numerous chat and calling applications allow you to make free calls to anyone, anytime, and anywhere in the world. All you need is a decent internet connection. Let’s look at some of the best applications to call Germany for free:\n\nWhatsApp: To begin with, WhatsApp is the most secure and reliable way to call Germany for free. It is a very common, convenient, and easy-to-use application that allows you to make free video and audio calls to other WhatsApp users across the globe, including Germany. The highlighting part of using WhatsApp is that it provides end-to-end encryption for your calls and messages, maintaining your data privacy and security.\n\nSkype: Skype is another trusted VoIP service used worldwide. You can use it for voice and video calls to other Skype users in Germany. Interestingly, you can conduct free group calls with up to 10 people using Skype.\n\nMicrosoft Teams: Microsoft Teams is a great application for organising virtual calls and meetings with your business partners and clients in Germany. The best part is that Teams doesn’t require the other person to install the app. You can conduct the calls on the web by sharing the call link with the other party.\n\nViber: Viber is the next free international calling solution. Similar to other applications and platforms, it also allows you to initiate voice and video calls for free with other Viber users. What sets it apart is that you can call non-Viber users or landline numbers at cost-effective charges.\n\nFaceTime: FaceTime is a free audio and video application exclusively available for Apple devices, including iPhone, MacBook, iPad, etc. Using this application, you can call other FaceTime users for free using the internet or cellular data.\n\nWhy did my call to Germany not work?\n\nCalling someone in Germany is as simple as calling someone in any other country with the appropriate country code and phone number. If you are unable to make the call, there can be several reasons behind it:\n\nIncorrect country/area code: The first and most obvious reason your calls to Germany failed is an incorrect German international code or area code. As the first troubleshooting step, check the German country code and area code for the number you are dialling and ensure they are correct.\n\nWrong number: Sometimes, your international call attempts fail because the number you are trying to reach is either incorrect or unavailable. Confirm the number with the recipient and try calling again using the correct format.\n\nDisabled international calling: If you cannot call the German phone number even after using the accurate country code, area code, and number, then there is a chance that the international calling feature is disabled on your device. In this case, contact your mobile network service provider and activate this feature on your number.\n\nNetwork issues: An unstable or weak network can also restrict you from calling your friends or colleagues in Germany. So, before anything else, ensure that your networks are not faulty.\n\n+49 country code time: What Is the best time to call Germany?\n\nThe best time to call Germany depends on the German recipient or the purpose of your call.\n\nFor formal calls: The best time to call Germany for professional reasons is during business hours, i.e., 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays. Moreover, avoid calling on weekends and holidays.\n\nFor informal calls: While you can call your friends or family members anytime you want, it is suggested to call them when they are free. A good idea is to familiarise yourself with their schedule and call accordingly.\n\nApart from these, here are some additional tips to keep in mind when making an international call:\n\nUse time zone converters: If you are confused about time zone differences, it’s best to use a reliable time zone converter tool available on the web.\n\nMake an appointment before calling: Every country has a different culture for socialising. In Germany, the common practice is to make an appointment with the callee in advance to avoid any kind of inconvenience. This is true for both formal and informal calls.\n\nAvoid certain times of the day: Unless it is an emergency, avoid calling very early in the morning or late at night. This can lead to a lot of inconvenience for the person you are calling.\n\nAlso read: Moving to Germany? 7 challenges you’ll face in Deutschland.\n\nDialling code in Germany – Emergency Numbers\n\nGermany has two main emergency numbers: 112 and 110.
