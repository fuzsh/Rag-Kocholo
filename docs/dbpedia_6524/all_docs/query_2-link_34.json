        "text": "Discussion\n\nWe implemented and evaluated a predictive machine learning approach using mass-univariate logistic models for tissue outcome prediction depending on recanalization status. Our analyses were based on multimodal CT imaging, clinical and demographic data from 405 stroke patients with acute intracerebral proximal vessel occlusion. In the first step, we determined the optimal set of input parameters for our predictive model. In the second step, the optimal model was thoroughly evaluated using independent data.\n\nWe found that the optimal model (in terms of volumetric accuracy) included only perfusion imaging parameters and recanalization status but neither clinical or demographic variables nor NCCT and CT-A source images. In particular, no benefit was found for prediction by including the time between symptom onset and imaging or NIHSS score. Most importantly, the amount of early hypodensity on NCCT nor CT-A source images was not crucial for accurate prediction in these logistic models. This might suggest that all relevant information for predicting tissue outcome is contained in the CT perfusion imaging and that clinical and demographic variables as well as NCCT and CT-A do not contain additional information in this regard. This is of particular interest since visual scoring of early infarct signs on NCCT using Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) still represents an important diagnostic criterion for triaging acute stroke patients in clinical routine [18]. Thus, when tissue outcome is considered a surrogate marker for functional outcome [16], patient selection for mechanical thrombectomy in the extended time window might be predominantly based on perfusion imaging findings and less on clinical parameters or NCCT.\n\nEvaluation of the optimal model based on independent data did not implicate any differences in volumetric accuracy between the logistic and the thresholding-based models. Nevertheless, the logistic models clearly outperformed the thresholding-based models in terms of topographic accuracy (AUC). In addition, spatial accuracy (Dice) was significantly improved for the logistic model in comparison to the thresholding-based model in our internal cross-validation. This superiority of the multiparametric logistic approach is well in line with a recent study which demonstrated higher predictive performance based on precision-recall plots and mean (but not mean absolute) volume difference [7]. In our analyses, the improved spatial accuracy did not generalize to the external validation cohort. This lack of generalizability is an important limitation of our study. However, this problem likely originates from the differences in baseline characteristics between the Leipzig training cohort and the Dresden test cohort. In the Dresden test cohort, time from symptom onset to imaging was significantly longer, the ASPECTS was lower, the ground truth infarct volume larger and the early functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale as well as NIHSS) worse, although the initial clinical severity and recanalization success rate were comparable. Finally, the ground truth has been delineated earlier and more often based on CT imaging in the Dresden cohort. We therefore speculate that these patients were less represented in the training data due to local differences in performing perfusion and follow-up imaging and endovascular interventions. Additionally, the use of different scanners and protocols for obtaining perfusion CT may have been a contributing factor.\n\nOn a conceptual level, the volume of tissue potentially salvageable by intervention plays a primary role for the potential benefit to the patient (i.e., the thrombectomy mismatch). Therefore, we also compared the tissue-to-infarct conversion rates of the different compartments (ischemic core and penumbra) depending on the prediction method (logistic, thresholding-based) and recanalization success. As expected, we found significantly lower conversion rates in the penumbra compartment in patients with successful recanalization. However, this effect was not dependent on the method. Thus, despite the higher spatial accuracy of the logistic prediction approach, no difference in predicting the thrombectomy mismatch could be demonstrated with this approach.\n\nStill, higher spatial accuracy in tissue outcome prediction using multiparametric logistic regression in comparison to thresholding-based approaches might become relevant in the future. Several previous studies [2, 3] did not take into account exact location of the predicted lesion but only considered the overall volume. However, prediction of symptoms from infarct location has improved significantly in recent years [19, 20]. Combining tissue and functional outcome prediction in the future therefore might enable predicting individual benefits in functional outcome prior to mechanical thrombectomy. Therefore, the exact location of potentially salvageable tissue might further improve the selection of patients who benefit from mechanical thrombectomy.\n\nFinally, we would like to emphasize strengths, limitations, and some methodological considerations of our study. A main strength of our study is our large, clinically well-characterized set of real-world data from routine stroke care outside of clinical trials. The knowledge of the recanalization status of every patient is of particular value during the training of models for tissue outcome prediction. Another important strength is the focus of our model evaluation on clinically relevant metrics. We would like to highlight the difference between using volumetric difference [7] and absolute volumetric difference [21] as used in the present study. The first quantifies the tendency of the classifier to over- or underestimate the infarct volume. The latter, applied in our sturdy, quantifies actual volumetric accuracy per patient. Two predictive models can have the same mean volumetric difference but very different volumetric accuracies. Additionally, several studies in the field focus on spatial accuracy and neglect volumetric accuracy [22, 23]. We believe, that both aspects play an important role. Therefore, we optimized the models on the most relevant metric (i.e., volumetric accuracy) but also evaluated secondary metrics. This procedure, together with the cross-validation approach, rules out the possibility that the demonstrated superiority in spatial accuracy was a consequence of overfitting. Another important methodological difference compared to prior studies fitting only one single GLM to the data of all voxels [8, 23] is the mass-univariate approach which was inspired by classical statistical parametric mapping in functional neuroimaging [24]. While Kemmling and colleagues [8] used multiple maps that encoded spatial features (tissue class, territory of the middle cerebral artery), in our approach spatial information is already implicitly encoded in the models. On the other hand, the mass-univariate approach has the disadvantage of a lower number of degrees of freedom, however, this was accounted for by the large size of our training data set. To leverage the fact of similar perfusion characteristics in neighboring voxels [25], we explored different smoothing kernels and found best results with FWHM of 9 mm. Another potential methodological constraint is imbalance in the data, i.e., much more data points with no infarction in the follow-up than with infarction. Winder and colleagues [23] proposed using stratified random sampling to overcome the issue of bias in logistic models under these circumstances. Unfortunately, this approach is not feasible in combination with mass-univariate statistics. We therefore used a different approach. Instead of the theoretically motivated threshold of 0.50 [26] for binarization of our infarct risk maps, we have adjusted the thresholds for the binarization of the probabilistic output of the logistic prediction based on cross-validation (to values of around 0.38, see Supplementary Fig. 1).\n\nLimitations of our study include uncertainties in our ground truth, mainly by mapping infarcts on subacute imaging which might have led to individual over- (mapping on MRI) or underestimation (mapping on CT and/or infarct growth after follow-up imaging) of the ground truth. Further, excluding patients with severe intracerebral hemorrhage might have biased the patient sample towards patients with better ASPECTS. Finally, our data suffered from an imbalance between fewer patients with persistent vessel occlusion compared to those with successful recanalization."
