        "text": "Leipzig International School (LIS) offers first-class international education in English for children from different backgrounds, supports the local community and promotes intercultural understanding. Since its foundation in 1992, the school has developed as an important economic and investment factor for the Leipzig region. English is the official language of communication and the high standard of education meets the high needs of the economic region, in every capacity. “Learning to be a Citizen of the World” is the motto, which defines the philosophy of education taught at LIS. This also includes promoting the cultural and the social development of the students. Class sizes are limited to a maximum of 20 students. In many specialist and optional classes, numbers are even smaller. There are no cancelled school lessons at Leipzig International School. At LIS students obtain the International Baccalaureate (IB) at the end of Year 12. This IB diploma qualifies students to study at leading universities in Germany and around the world. In 2014, LIS opened the Leipzig International Kindergarten for the youngest members of the community. Enquiries about the international programme in kindergarten, primary and secondary school at LIS are accepted all year round: admissions@lis.school\n\nSchool details\n\nMore than 900 students from 70 countries attend LIS and the Leipzig International Kindergarten, with the most represented nations after the host country being the United States of America, Japan, United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. Leipzig International School employs over 190 English-speaking staff members, from 20 different nationalities. The day school serves as a Pre-School, a Primary School (Grades 1-5) and a Secondary School (Grades 6 –12). French and Spanish are taught in Grades 6 to 12. The Primary school at LIS follows the International Primary Curriculum, and the Secondary School the Cambridge Secondary 1 and IGCSE Programme. This certificate is the equivalent of the German ‘Mittlere Reife’. In Grades 11 and 12 students prepare for the International Baccalaureate Diploma (IB). The IB Diploma is recognised worldwide and also in Germany, as a university entrance qualification (Hochschulzugangsberechtigung).\n\nSchool life\n\nLeipzig International School is a community of richly diverse and ambitious people. This can be seen in our various student activities, sporting competitions, the work of our student councils and other such projects and events. In addition to the academic programme, Leipzig International School offers an attractive range of activities. Our enrichment programme (extra-curricular activities after school) provide additional opportunities for social and group interaction. There is a variety of activities available covering a wide spectrum of interests - from sports to woodworks to music to drama ... just to name a few!
