Purpose and legal bases for data processing at LTM GmbH\n\nLTM GmbH processes personal data in accordance with the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and other applicable data protection regulations where required by law.\n\nThe specific data processed, and the manner in which this data is used, depends largely on the services requested or agreed in each case. Further details or additional information on the purposes of the data processing can be found in the contract documents, agreements, forms, declarations of consent and/or other available information (e.g. when using the do-it-at-leipzig website).\n\n1. Processing on the basis of consent in accordance with Art. 6 (1) a GDPR\n\nPersonal data can be processed for specific purposes (e.g. use of an email address for marketing purposes) if consent has been given. This consent can generally be withdrawn at any time. This also applies to the withdrawal of any consent granted to LTM GmbH before the GDPR entered into force, that is, before 25.05.2018. Information on the purposes of the processing and the consequences of withdrawing consent or refusing to give consent will be given in the corresponding text on the consent form.\n\nAs a general rule, this notice of withdrawal will only have effect for the future. Any processing carried out before consent is withdrawn is not affected by the withdrawal and remains lawful.\n\n2. Processing in order to fulfil a contract or taking steps prior to entering into a contract in accordance with Art. 6 (1) b GDPR\n\nPersonal data is processed in order to perform contracts by LTM GmbH and to fulfil orders as well as to take steps and action prior to entering into a contract, for example with prospective customers. The purpose of processing this data is, in particular, to provide tourist services and to deliver products as per orders and requirements, including the services, measures and activities necessary to do so. This mainly includes:\n\ncontract-related communication, the verification of orders, other agreements and transactions and for quality control by means of appropriate documentation, goodwill measures, measures to control and optimise business processes as well as the fulfilment of general duties of care, control and supervision by affiliated companies (e.g. parent company),\n\nstatistical evaluations for company management, cost recording and controlling, reporting, internal and external communication, managing emergencies, accounting and tax assessment of operational services, risk management, assertion of legal claims and defence in the case of legal disputes,\n\nensuring IT security including system and plausibility tests) and general security, including building and plant security, safeguarding and exercising the right to enforce house rules, guaranteeing the integrity, authenticity and availability of data, preventing and investigating criminal offences; monitoring by supervisory boards or supervisory authorities (e. g. audits).\n\n3.Purposes for the fulfilment of legal requirements according to Art. Art. 6 (1) c) GDPR or in the public interest under Art. 6 (1) e) GDPR\n\nJust like any other actor in the economy, LTM GmbH is subject to a number of legal obligations. These are primarily statutory requirements (e.g. trade and tax laws, but also, where applicable, regulatory or other requirements imposed by the authorities). The purposes of the processing may also include identity and age checks, the prevention of fraud and money laundering, the prevention, combating and investigation of terrorist financing and criminal offences posing a financial risk, cross-checks with European and international anti-terror lists, compliance with monitoring and reporting obligations under tax law, the archiving of data for the purposes of data protection and data security as well as audits by tax authorities and other government agencies. In addition, it may be necessary to disclose personal data in the context of judicial measures or measures by the authorities for the purposes of collecting evidence, criminal prosecution or the enforcement of civil law claims.\n\n4.Processing for the purposes of a legitimate interest on the part of LTM GmbH or third parties in accordance with Art. 6 (1) f GDPR\n\nAbove and beyond the actual fulfilment of a contract or steps taken prior to entering into a contract, LTM GmbH may process data where this is necessary to protect its own legitimate interests or those of third parties, in particular for the following purposes:\n\nadvertising as well as market and opinion research provided that consent to the use of data has been given,\n\nobtaining information and exchanging data with credit agencies, insofar as this exceeds LTM GmbH's financial risk,\n\nthe review and optimisation of processes for requirements analyses,\n\nthe further development of products and services as well as existing processes and systems\n\nthe disclosure of personal data for the purpose of a due diligence check in the course of company sale negotiations\n\ncross-checks with European and international anti-terrorist lists, insofar as this exceeds the statutory obligations\n\nenriching LTM data, e.g. by using or researching publicly available data\n\nmarket analysis or statistical evaluations\n\nbenchmarking\n\nasserting legal claims and defence in the event of legal disputes that are not directly related to the contractual relationship\n\nthe restricted processing of data if deletion is not possible or only possible with disproportionate effort due to the particular type of storage\n\nthe development of scoring systems or automated decision-making processes\n\nthe prevention and investigation of criminal offences, insofar as this is not solely for compliance with statutory requirements\n\nbuilding and plant security, insofar as this goes beyond the general duties of care\n\ninternal and external investigations, safety reviews\n\nthe possible monitoring or recording of telephone conversations for quality control and training purposes\n\npreserving and maintaining certifications of a private-law or official nature,\n\nsafeguarding and exercising the right to enforce house rules by means of appropriate measures to protect the customers and employees of LTM GmbH as well as to secure evidence in the event of criminal offences and the prevention of such offences.\n\nIV. Categories of data processed by LTM GmbH where the data is not received directly and the origin of this data\n\nWhere it is necessary for LTM GmbH to provide its services, LTM GmbH processes personal data lawfully obtained from other companies or other third parties (e.g. address publishers, credit agencies). In addition, LTM GmbH processes personal data that has been acquired from publicly accessible sources such as telephone directories, the press, Internet and other media, commercial registers, association registers, civil registers, records of debtors, land registers) where the processing of this data is lawful.\n\nRelevant categories of personal data to which this may relate can include in particular:\n\npersonal data (name, date of birth, place of birth, nationality, marital status, occupation/branch of trade and comparable data)\n\ncontact details (address, e-mail address, telephone number and comparable data)\n\naddress details (civil register data and comparable data),\n\npayment confirmation/confirmation of cover for bank and credit cards,\n\ninformation about the client's financial situation (creditworthiness data including scoring, and data for assessing the commercial risk),\n\nclient history,\n\ndata on usage of the electronic information and communication services offered by LTM GmbH (e.g. time of access to the LTM website, clicked pages/links of LTM GmbH or entries and comparable data, newsletter),\n\nvideo and photographic data.\n\nV. Recipients or categories of recipients\n\nWithin LTM GmbH, data is forwarded to those in-house departments that need this data for compliance with contractual and statutory obligations, or in order to enforce and implement the legitimate interests of LTM GmbH.\n\nLTM GmbH also shares personal data – to the extent permitted or prescribed by law – with other recipients that provide services on behalf of LTM GmbH. LTM GmbH limits the disclosure of personal data to the necessary minimum. Some LTM service providers receive personal data in the role of external processors and are then strictly bound to the instructions of LTM GmbH concerning the handling of this personal data.\n\nData is forwarded to external parties only:\n\nin connection with the processing of a contract,\n\non the basis of the legitimate interest of LTM GmbH or the third party for the purposes set out under Section III. /4 (e.g. to government agencies, credit agencies, collection agencies, solicitors, courts of law, appraisers, companies belonging to the group, boards and supervisory authorities)\n\nfor the purposes of compliance with statutory requirements where LTM GmbH is obliged to provide information about, report or disclose data or where the disclosure of data is in the public interest (see Section III./3)\n\nwhere external service providers process data on behalf of LTM GmbH as processors or parties assuming certain functions (e.g. external data centres, support and maintenance of IT applications, archiving, document processing, call centre services, compliance services, controlling, data screening for anti-money laundering purposes, data validation or plausibility checks, data destruction, purchasing/procurement, customer management, letter shops, marketing, media technology, research, risk monitoring, invoicing, telephony, website management, auditing services, credit institutions, printing companies or data disposal companies, courier services, logistics),\n\nwhere LTM GmbH has been given consent to transmit data to third parties\n\nVI. Data storage period\n\nLTM GmbH processes and stores data for the duration of the respective business relationship. This also includes steps taken prior to entering into a contract (pre-contractual legal relationship) and the administration of the contract.\n\nIn addition, LTM GmbH is subject to various storage and documentation obligations, which result from the German Commercial Code (HGB) and the German Fiscal Code (AO), among others. The periods and deadlines for retention and/or documentation stipulated under this legislation are up to ten years after the end of the commercial relationship or the pre-contractual legal relationship.\n\nIn addition, specific statutory provisions may require longer retention periods such as, for example, the preservation of evidence in connection with statutory limitation regulations. In accordance with Sections 195 ff. of the German Civil Code (BGB), the standard limitation period is three years, but limitation periods of up to 30 years may apply.\n\nIf the data is no longer required to meet contractual or statutory obligations and rights, it is deleted unless the further processing of the data – for a limited period – is necessary to fulfil the purposes listed under Section III. / 4 due to an overriding legitimate interest. Such an overriding legitimate interest exists, for example, if the deletion of the data is not possible or only possible with disproportionate effort due to the particular type of storage, and processing for other purposes using appropriate technical and organisational measures is excluded.\n\nVII. Transferring data to third countries and international organisations\n\nData is transmitted to sites in countries outside the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA) (known as third countries) where necessary to perform a contract or to fulfil an order, where prescribed by law (e.g. reporting obligations under tax law), where it is in the legitimate interest of LTM GmbH or a third party and where LTM GmbH has received consent to do so.\n\nIn such cases, data may also be processed in a third country in connection with the involvement of service providers for order processing. If no decision has been issued by the European Commission regarding the existence of an adequate level of data protection in the respective country, LTM GmbH warrants that rights and freedoms will be adequately protected and safeguarded in accordance with EU data protection requirements through appropriate contractual agreements. LTM GmbH will provide the relevant detailed information on request.\n\nVIII. Data protection rights as a data subject\n\nProvided the statutory conditions are met, the data subject is entitled to assert the following rights against LTM GmbH.\n\nRight of access: Under Art. 15 GDPR, the data subject has the right to obtain confirmation from LTM GmbH as to whether or not personal client data is processed by LTM GmbH. If this is the case, the data subject has the right of access to this personal data and certain other information under Art. 15 GDPR (including the purposes of processing, the categories of personal data, the categories of recipients, the envisaged storage period, the source of the data, the use of automated decision-making and, where data is transferred to a third country, the appropriate safeguards) and to obtain a copy of the data (with potential limitations pursuant to Section 34 BDSG).\n\nRight to rectification: Under Art. 16 GDPR, the data subject has the right to request that LTM GmbH rectifies any stored personal data that is inaccurate or incomplete.\n\nRight to erasure: Under the provisions of Art. 17 GDPR, the data subject has the right to request that LTM GmbH erases personal client data without undue delay. The right to erasure does not apply in certain cases, for example where the processing of personal data is necessary for the exercise of the right of freedom of expression and information, for compliance with a legal obligation to which LTM GmbH is subject (e.g. statutory retention duties) or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.\n\nRight to restriction of the processing: Under the provisions of Art. 18 GDPR, the data subject has the right to request that LTM GmbH restricts the processing of personal client data.\n\nRight to data portability: Under the provisions of Art. 20 GDPR, the data subject has the right to demand from LTM GmbH that LTM GmbH supplies the relevant personal client data provided to LTM GmbH in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.\n\nRight to withdraw consent: The data subject has the right to withdraw consent to the processing of personal data at any time with future effect.\n\nRight to object: Under the provisions of Art. 21 GDPR, the data subject has the right to object to the processing of personal data with the result that LTM GmbH is obliged to cease processing this personal data. The right of objection exists only within the limits provided in Art. 21 GDPR. In addition, the interests of LTM GmbH may conflict with ceasing the processing, meaning that LTM GmbH may have the right to continue processing the personal data despite the objection.\n\nRight to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority: Under the provisions of Art. 77 GDPR, the data subject has the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State in which the subject lives or works or in which the alleged infringement took place, if of the opinion that the processing of personal data infringes the GDPR. The right to lodge a complaint does not prejudice any other administrative or legal remedy.\n\nThe competent supervisory authority for LTM GmbH is:\n\nDer Sächsische Datenschutzbeauftragte\n\nDevrientstraße 5\n\n01067 Dresden\n\nPhone: +49 (0)351/85471-101\n\nFax: +49 (0)351/85471-109\n\nInternet: www.datenschutz.sachsen.de\n\nEmail: saechsdsb@slt.sachsen.de\n\nHowever, LTM GmbH recommends that any complaints are first sent to the company data protection officer.\n\nWhere possible, any requests to exercise rights should be sent in writing to the address stated in Section I above or addressed directly to LTM GmbH’s data protection officer.\n\nIX. Scope of obligations to provide data\n\nThere is no general obligation to provide personal data to LTM GmbH. However, if the data is not provided, LTM GmbH will not be able to respond to customer enquiries or enter into a contract and it will not be possible to use all features of the LTM GmbH website. Where LTM GmbH does not necessarily require personal data for the above processing purposes, this is indicated by “where applicable” or another symbol. This means that any information of this kind is provided voluntarily.\n\nX. Automated decision-making/ profiling in accordance with Art. 22 GDPR\n\nLTM GmbH does not apply any automated decision-making or profiling (automated analysis of personal circumstances).\n\nXI. Information about the right to object under Art. 21 GDPR\n\nThe data subject has the right to object at any time to the processing of data that is carried out pursuant to Art. 6 (1) e GDPR (data processing in the public interest) or Art. 6 (1) f GDPR (data processing on the basis of a balancing of interests), to lodge an objection if there are reasons for doing so which arise from your particular situation. This also applies to any profiling based on these provisions within the meaning of Art. 4 (4) GDPR.\n\nIf you object, LTM GmbH will no longer process your personal data unless it can demonstrate compelling legitimate reasons for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or unless the processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.\n\nLTM GmbH also processes your personal data in individual cases for direct marketing purposes. If you do not wish to receive any marketing, you have the right to object to this at any time. This also applies to profiling to the extent that it is related to this direct marketing. LTM GmbH will note this objection for the future.\n\nWhere you object to the processing of data for direct marketing purposes, LTM GmbH will no longer process your data for these purposes.\n\nNo special requirements apply to the format of objections. Objections should be preferably addressed to:\n\nLeipzig Tourismus und Marketing GmbH\n\nAugustusplatz 9\n\n04109 Leipzig, Germany\n\nTel. +49 341 7104-260\n\nFax +49 341 7104-271\n\ninfo@ltm-leipzig.de\n\nXII.

In this way, LTM GmbH can improve the quality of the LTM website and its content. LTM GmbH receives information on how the website is used and can use this to continually optimise the LTM website.\n\nLTM GmbH processes your personal data for the purpose of preparing a statistical analysis of use of the LTM website on the following legal basis:\n\nYour consent in accordance with Art. 6 (1) lit. a GDPR.\n\nGoogle Analytics\n\nLTM GmbH uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google Inc., USA, on the LTM website. Google Analytics uses so-called \"cookies\", which are text files stored on your computer, to enable an analysis of how you use the website. The information generated by the cookies about your use of the LTM website is generally sent to a Google server in the USA and stored there. If IP anonymisation is activated on the LTM website, your IP address will first be truncated by Google. This is done within the Member States of the European Union or other countries that are party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address transmitted to a server in the USA and truncated there. Google will use this information on behalf of LTM GmbH to evaluate usage of the website, to compile reports on website activities and to provide other services to the website operator relating to website usage and Internet usage. The IP address transmitted from your browser for Google Analytics will not be linked to other data collected by Google.\n\nLTM GmbH uses Google Analytics with the extension “_anonymizeIp()” on the LTM website. This truncates the IP addresses for further processing and excludes the possibility of direct personal reference.\n\nLTM GmbH uses Google Analytics only with your consent. Once given, this consent can be revoked by\n\npreventing cookies from being stored by changing the settings of your browser software accordingly; however, LTM GmbH would like to point out that, if you do so, you may not be able to make full use of all of the features of the LTM website\n\ndownloading and installing the browser plug-in available at the following link: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en\n\nin order to prevent Google Analytics from collecting your data on the LTM website in future.

It should be noted that the opt-out cookie must be activated in every browser used on all end devices and must also be reactivated if necessary once all cookies in a browser have been deleted.\n\nFor more information about the terms of service for Google Analytics and data protection in this context, please visit https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/\n\nGoogle Analytics Remarketing\n\nThe LTM website uses the Google Analytics Remarketing feature in conjunction with the cross-device features of Google AdWords. This is provided by Google Inc., USA.\n\nThis feature makes it possible to link the advertising target groups generated by Google Analytics Remarketing with the cross-device features of Google AdWords. This allows personalised advertising tailored to your interests and based on your previous usage and browsing habits on one device (e.g. your mobile phone) to be displayed on any of your other devices (e.g. a tablet or PC).\n\nProvided you have given your consent, Google will link your web and app browser history with your Google account for this purpose. This means that the same personalised advertising can be shown on any device that you use to log in to your Google account.\n\nTo support this feature, Google Analytics collects users’ Google-authenticated IDs and temporarily links them to our Google Analytics data in order to define and create target groups for cross-device advertising.\n\nYou can permanently object to cross-device remarketing/targeting by deactivating personalised advertising in your own Google account: www.google.com/settings/ads\n\nThe data collected in your Google account will only be aggregated with your consent. This consent can be given to Google or revoked according to Art. 6 (1) lit. a GDPR. In the case of data collection operations that are not associated with your Google account (for example, because you do not have a Google account or have objected to your data being aggregated), data is collected on the basis of Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR. The fact that LTM GmbH, as the website operator, has an interest in the anonymised analysis of website visitors for advertising purposes constitutes the legitimate interest.\n\nMore information and the data protection provisions can be found in Google’s Privacy Policy at policies.google.com/technologies/ads.\n\n2.

Advertising purposes such as newsletters, surveys, etc.\n\nWith your consent, LTM GmbH uses your data for advertising purposes, such as sending the Leipzig convention newsletter or information about current offers, events, etc., in Leipzig. For this purpose, LTM GmbH processes not only mandatory information such as your email address, but also other information that you provide voluntarily. LTM GmbH uses the voluntary information to permanently improve the information experience and make it more customer-friendly, to enable an individualised approach, to analyse preferences and to inform about products that fit best and make advertising more useful and interesting. The notifications can be cancelled at any time by clicking on the link provided in the newsletter and thus cancelling the subscription.\n\nLTM GmbH uses a newsletter service provider to send you its newsletters. This service provider enables LTM to collect information, such as the time the newsletter was opened, information about your email client and device, your click behaviour and the topics that you viewed. LTM GmbH uses this information in pseudonymised form only. By analysing and evaluating this information, LTM GmbH is able to make technical and content-related improvements to the LTM newsletter and its offerings so that it can send you personalised advertising.\n\nThe analysis and evaluation of this information helps prevent LTM GmbH from sending you random advertising.

Where you have given your email address to LTM GmbH in connection with the purchase of goods or services, this can be used in future by LTM GmbH to send you newsletters. In this case, the newsletter will only be used for the direct marketing of similar LTM goods or services.\n\nFurthermore, LTM GmbH uses the contact data with your consent for marketing purposes insofar as promotional brochures or other materials are ordered, event registrations are made or you have taken part in a survey.\n\nLTM GmbH processes your data in order to send newsletters and customise communications on the following legal bases:\n\nprovided that LTM GmbH has been granted consent via the double opt-in procedure, in accordance with Art. 6 (1) lit. a GDPR.\n\nprovided that LTM GmbH has been informed of the email address in connection with the purchase of goods or services or LTM GmbH sends personalised advertising, in order to safeguard the legitimate interests of LTM GmbH pursuant to Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR. § 7 (3) Act Against Unfair Competition (UWG). The legitimate interest of LTM GmbH is based on its economic interests, such as conducting advertising activities and targeting advertising to specific target groups.\n\ne. Use of data for email marketing and your right to object\n\nIf LTM GmbH uses your email address in connection with the conclusion of a contract and the provision of LTM products and you have not objected to this use, LTM GmbH reserves the right to send you offers for similar products from the LTM range by email on a regular basis. You can object to this use of your email at any time by sending a message to the contact details provided below, or by using a link provided in the marketing email for this purpose, without incurring any costs other than transmission costs charged at the basic rate.\n\nIV. Links and social media links\n\na. Links\n\nSome sections of the LTM website contain links to the websites of external providers. These websites are subject to their own privacy policies. LTM GmbH is not responsible for the operation of these websites or for their handling of data. If information is sent to or via such third-party sites, the privacy policies of these sites should be checked before information is transmitted that can be attributed to an individual.\n\nb. Social media links\n\nLinks to services such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and LinkedIn are integrated in the LTM website. You will be forwarded to the website of the respective provider after clicking the link. This means that user information is transmitted to the respective provider only at this stage. Information on how your personal data is handled when using the websites of other providers can be found in the privacy policies of these providers.\n\nV. Recipients or categories of recipients of your data\n\nWithin LTM GmbH, your data is forwarded to those in-house departments that need this data for compliance with contractual and statutory obligations, or in order to enforce and implement the legitimate interests of LTM GmbH. LTM GmbH also shares your personal data – to the extent permitted or prescribed by law – with other recipients that perform services relating to the LTM website on behalf of LTM GmbH. LTM GmbH limits the disclosure of your personal data to the necessary minimum required, in particular, the minimum required to process your order/booking. Some LTM service providers receive your personal data in the role of external processors and are, as such, strictly bound to the instructions of LTM GmbH concerning the handling of your personal data.\n\nThe categories of recipients of your personal data are listed below:\n\nexternal service providers that handle bookings of meeting rooms, hotels and the sending of newsletters,\n\npayment service providers and banks where payments are processed,\n\nlogistics companies contracted to deliver goods (information material) to you,\n\ndebt collection agencies and legal advisors where LTM GmbH asserts claims,\n\nIT service providers that manage and host the LTM website,\n\nother categories of recipients where applicable\n\nVI. Storage period\n\nUse of the website for informational purposes\n\nIf you use the LTM website for purely informational purposes, LTM GmbH stores your personal data on the servers solely for the duration of your visit to the LTM website. Your personal data is deleted immediately after you leave the LTM website.\n\nAny cookies installed by LTM GmbH are also usually deleted after you leave the LTM website. However, this does not apply to persistent cookies (including cookies used by Google Analytics), which are automatically deleted after a specified period of time. This may vary depending on the cookie – the maximum storage period is one year (see Section III. / 1. / a. or b.).\n\nYou also have the option of deleting installed cookies yourself at any time (see Section III /1. / a. or b.).\n\nActive use of the website\n\nIf you actively use the website, LTM GmbH stores your personal data initially for the time that we need to respond to your enquiry or for the duration of the business relationship. This also includes steps taken prior to entering into a contract (pre-contractual legal relationship) and the administration of the contract.\n\nIn addition, LTM GmbH also stores your personal data until the limitation period for legal claims from the relationship with you has expired, in order to use it as evidence if necessary. The limitation period is usually between 12 and 36 months, but it can be up to 30 years.\n\nUpon expiry of the limitation period, LTM GmbH will delete your personal data unless it is subject to a statutory retention period, for example, under the German Commercial Code (HGB, Sections 238, 257 Para. 4) or the German Fiscal Code (AO, Section 147 Paras. 3 and 4). These retention periods can be between two and ten years.\n\nVII. Transferring data to third countries\n\nLTM GmbH transmits your truncated IP address to the USA when using Google tools. The data is transmitted on the basis of the Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/1250 of 12 July 2016 pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the adequacy of the protection provided by the EU-US Privacy Shield.\n\nIn all other cases, LTM GmbH does not transmit your personal data to countries outside the EU or the EEA or to international organisations.\n\nVIII. Your data protection rights as a data subject\n\nProvided the statutory conditions are met, you as the data subject are entitled to assert the following rights against LTM GmbH.\n\nRight of access: under Art. 15 GDPR, you have the right to obtain confirmation from LTM GmbH at any time as to whether or not personal data relating to you is processed by LTM GmbH. Should this be the case, you have the right of access to this personal data and certain other information under Art. 15 GDPR (including the purposes of processing, the categories of personal data, the categories of recipients, the envisaged storage period, the source of the data, the use of automated decision-making and, where data is transferred to a third country, the appropriate safeguards) and to obtain a copy of your data (subject to possible limitations pursuant to Section 34 BDSG).\n\nRight to rectification: Under Art. 16 GDPR, you have the right to request that LTM GmbH rectifies any stored data relating to you that is inaccurate or incomplete.\n\nRight to erasure: Under the provisions of Art. 17 GDPR, you have the right, at any time, to request that LTM GmbH erases the personal data relating to you without undue delay. The right to erasure does not apply in certain cases, for example where the processing of personal data is necessary for the exercise of the right of freedom of expression and information, for compliance with a legal obligation to which LTM GmbH is subject (e.g. statutory retention duties) or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.\n\nRight to restriction of the processing: Under the provisions of Art. 18 GDPR, you have the right to request that LTM GmbH restrict the processing of personal data of its customers.\n\nRight to data portability: Under the provisions of Art. 20 GDPR, you have the right to receive the personal data relating to you and provided to LTM GmbH by you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.\n\nRight to withdraw consent: You have the right to withdraw consent to the processing of your personal data at any time with future effect.\n\nRight to object: Under the provisions of Art. 21 GDPR, you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data with the result that LTM GmbH is obliged to cease processing your personal data. The right of objection exists only within the limits provided in Art. 21 GDPR. In addition, the interests of LTM GmbH may conflict with ceasing the processing, meaning that LTM GmbH may have the right to continue processing your personal data despite your objection.\n\nRight to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority: Under the provisions of Art. 77 GDPR, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State in which you live or work or in which the alleged infringement took place, if you are of the opinion that the processing of personal data relating to you infringes the GDPR. The right to lodge a complaint does not prejudice any other administrative or legal remedy.\n\nThe competent supervisory authority for LTM GmbH is:\n\nDer Sächsische Datenschutzbeauftragte\n\nDevrientstraße 5\n\n01067 Dresden\n\nPhone: +49 (0)351/85471-101\n\nFax: +49 (0)351/85471-109\n\nInternet: www.datenschutz.sachsen.de\n\nEmail: saechsdsb@slt.sachsen.de\n\nHowever, LTM GmbH recommends that you always send any complaints to our company data protection officer first.\n\nWhere possible, your requests to exercise your rights should be sent in writing to the address stated in Section I above or addressed directly to LTM GmbH’s Data Protection Officer.\n\nIX. Scope of your obligations to provide data\n\nThere is no general obligation to provide personal data to LTM GmbH. However, if you refuse to do so, LTM GmbH will not be able to respond to your enquiries or enter into a contract with you, and you will not be able to use all features of the LTM GmbH website. Where LTM GmbH does not necessarily require personal data for the above processing purposes, this is indicated by “where applicable” or another symbol. This means that any information of this kind is provided voluntarily.\n\nX. Automated decision-making / profiling in accordance with Art. 22 GDPR\n\nLTM GmbH does not apply any automated decision-making or profiling (automated analysis of your personal circumstances).\n\nXI. Information about your right to object under Art. 21 GDPR\n\nYou have the right to object at any time to the processing of your data that is carried out pursuant to Art. 6 (1) e GDPR (data processing in the public interest) or Art. 6 (1) f GDPR (data processing on the basis of a balancing of interests), to lodge an objection if there are reasons for doing so which arise from your particular situation. This also applies to any profiling based on these provisions within the meaning of Art. 4 (4) GDPR.\n\nIf you object, LTM GmbH will no longer process your personal data unless it can demonstrate compelling legitimate reasons for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or unless the processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.\n\nLTM GmbH also processes your personal data in individual cases for direct marketing purposes. If you do not wish to receive any marketing, you have the right to object to this at any time. This also applies to profiling to the extent that it is related to this direct marketing. LTM GmbH will note this objection for the future.\n\nWhere you object to the processing of data for direct marketing purposes, LTM GmbH will no longer process your data for these purposes.\n\nNo special requirements apply to the format of objections. Objections should be preferably addressed to:\n\nLeipzig Tourismus und Marketing GmbH\n\nAugustusplatz 9\n\n04109 Leipzig, Germany\n\nTel. +49 341 7104-260\n\nFax +49 341 7104-271\n\ninfo@ltm-leipzig.de\n\nXII.

The copying, editing, distribution or any form of use of the content outside the limits of copyright law requires the written consent of the respective author or creator.
