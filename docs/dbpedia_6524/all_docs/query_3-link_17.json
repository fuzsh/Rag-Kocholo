The region was originally inhabited by Slavic tribes and the name reflects the common appearance of these trees in the area.\n\nArchaeological evidence points to human presence in the Leipzig area as early as the Neolithic period. However, the city of Leipzig itself was first mentioned in historical records in 1015, when it was a small trading settlement under the rule of Margrave Gero.\n\nOver time, due to its key location at the crossroads of important trade routes such as the Via Regia and Via Imperii, Leipzig developed into a major commercial centre with a strong cultural and economic influence throughout history.\n\nIts strategic position at major European trade crossroads birthed the Leipzig Trade Fair in the 12th century.\n\nThe city has been a cultural and musical powerhouse for centuries. The St. Thomas Choir, established in 1212, is among the world’s oldest boys’ choirs. Composer Johann Sebastian Bach left his mark on Leipzig as Thomaskantor and working at St. Thomas Church. Additionally, the acclaimed Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra emerged in 1743.\n\nThe Battle of Nations is also known as the Battle of Leipzig.\n\nThis momentous battle in 1813 was one of the largest in European history. It marked a turning point in the Napoleonic Wars as it eventually led to the exile of Napoleon.\n\nToday, the Monument to the Battle of Nations stands as a testament to this crucial event, commemorating the lives lost and the city's resilience throughout history.\n\nIn the 1800s, Leipzig transformed into a printing and publishing mecca with distinguished publishers like Brockhaus and Reclam residing there. The University of Leipzig, founded in 1409, is one of Germany’s most venerable academic institutions—alma mater to philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche and chemist Wilhelm Ostwald.\n\nLeipzig played an instrumental role in modern German history through peaceful protests at St. Nicholas Church in 1989 that ultimately toppled the Berlin Wall. These ‘Monday Demonstrations’ showcased Leipzig citizens’ dedication to freedom and unity.\n\nWhat to do in Leipzig\n\nLeipzig offers visitors a wide range of sights that showcase the city's history, culture and architecture.\n\nNotable attractions include historic buildings, a well-preserved old town, fascinating museums, art galleries and impressive monuments.\n\nThe city also boasts beautiful parks, trendy neighbourhoods and culturally significant sites related to famous composers and the peaceful revolution.\n\nSt Thomas Church (Thomaskirche)\n\nSt Thomas Church is a historically important church located in the heart of Leipzig.\n\nThe original church is believed to have been founded back in the 12th century. It survived the fire of 1468 and was rebuilt in the Gothic style.\n\nSt Thomas is closely associated with composer Johann Sebastian Bach. He was the church's musical director from 1723 until his death in 1750. It was here that he composed and performed many of his masterpieces with the famous St Thomas Boys Choir.\n\nJS Bach's remains lie in state in the church, having been moved from their original grave in Leipzig's Johanniskirche in 1950.\n\nThe Thomanerchor was founded in 1212 by Margrave Dietrich of Meissen. It is one of the oldest boys' choirs in Germany, with an unbroken tradition spanning more than eight centuries.\n\nThe impressive late Gothic architecture features high ceilings, beautiful stained glass windows, intricate carvings on the choir stalls and a baroque-style organ gallery.\n\nThe tower of the Church of St Thomas stands some 68 metres tall and provides a striking silhouette against the Leipzig skyline.\n\nThe nearby Bach Museum is dedicated to the life and works of Johann Sebastian Bach. It features historical artefacts such as manuscripts or instruments related to the great composer.\n\nSt Nicholas Church (Nikolaikirche)\n\nThe St Nicholas Church (Nikolaikirche) was founded around 1165, which makes it one of the oldest churches in Leipzig.\n\nThe importance of this historic church increased during the peaceful revolution of 1989. The Nikolaikirche served as a rallying point for pro-democracy demonstrators during the Monday protests.\n\nThe church has a fascinating mix of architectural styles due to various additions and renovations over the centuries.\n\nThe interior features intricate columns with palm leaf capitals, beautiful stained glass windows and an impressive organ with over 6,000 pipes.\n\nPeace prayers are still held at St Nicholas every Monday to commemorate the church's role in the peaceful revolution and to encourage non-violent protest against injustice.\n\nOld Town Hall (Altes Rathaus)\n\nThe Altes Rathaus, or Old Town Hall, is a prominent landmark in Market Square.\n\nConstructed in 1556 under the guidance of architect Hieronymus Lotter, the town hall exemplifies the beauty of Renaissance architecture. The building features a distinct facade with intricate detailing and ornamentation.\n\nThe Altes Rathaus is not just a stunning architectural sight but also home to the Stadtgeschichtliches Museum (Museum of City History). The museum offers insight into Leipzig's rich history through various exhibits, period rooms, and collections.\n\nMuseum der bildende Künst (MdbK)\n\nThe Museum of Fine Arts (Museum der bildenden Künste) in Leipzig is a renowned art museum that houses an extensive collection of paintings, sculptures, and graphic art from the Middle Ages to the modern era.\n\nLocated in a modern, glass cube-style building, the museum offers an impressive contrast between its contemporary exterior and the centuries-old artworks within.\n\nThe collection features works by both internationally recognized and local artists, such as Max Klinger, Neo Rauch, and the Leipzig School.\n\nBattle of the Nations Monument\n\nThe Battle of the Nations Monument (Völkerschlachtdenkmal) in Leipzig is an imposing structure that commemorates the decisive Battle of Leipzig, which took place in 1813 during the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nThe battle, also known as the Battle of Nations, saw the allied forces defeat Napoleon's army. It was a significant turning point in European history.\n\nThe monument, completed in 1913 on the battle's centenary, is one of the largest monuments in Europe. Designed by German architect Bruno Schmitz, the structure features impressive sculptures and an exhibition hall.\n\nVisitors can climb steps up to a platform which enjoys panoramic views of Leipzig and the surrounding areas.\n\nNearby Attractions and Activities\n\nThe Leipzig Regio Card is a help for a local day trip near Leipzig.
