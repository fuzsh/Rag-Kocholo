        "text": "Studentenwerk Leipzig is supporting students with child(ren) by means of a so-called Kinderkarte (childrens’s student restaurant card). Until they reach the age 10, this card entitles children of students of any one of Leipzig’s nine universities and academies to receive one free warm meal per day and child at the Studentenwerk Leipzig student restaurants.\n\nAs a prerequisite for using the children’s student restaurant card, simultaneously at least two side dishes, one meal or a salad dish have to be purchased for one of the parents. When paying, the children’s student restaurant card has to be placed at the cashier’s desk in a clearly visible manner.\n\nThe cards are always valid for one semester at a time and may then be renewed. They can be applied for, collected, renewed, returned and reported lost either directly by calling on the Studentenwerk Leipzig social counsellors, int the Studenten Service Zentrum or by writing an E-mail to: sozialberatung@studentenwerk-leipzig.de.\n\nStudentenwerk Leipzig provides special children’s plates (Kinderteller) for children’s meals at all its student restaurants. They are available to you directly at the counter or from the student restaurant staff. Please solely use these plates with the coloured motifs for any student restaurant food you buy for your child(ren).\n\nSalads, desserts and the range of foods offered at the cafeterias are not considered to be part of this service. At the student restaurant Mensa am Park, only the food offered at the sales stalls on the lower level are relevant in this regard.\n\nOur vegan premium dish (Veganes Premiumgericht) is prepared using products with a low rate of convenience (level of pre-preparation). This means higher manpower requirements when preparing the food and thus overall higher costs for each dish, as our employees mostly need a lot more time for preparing that dish than they need for conventional dishes. In addition to that, ingredients such as nuts, soy or seitan products in particular, are often more expensive.\n\nIn addition to the vegan premium dish, we also offer many other inexpensive vegan foods, both at our student restaurants as well as at our cafeterias.\n\nFirst of all, there are almost no leftovers at our student restaurants due to the food being prepared in batches. If, however, there happen to be some helpings left, we use the opportunity to conserve such surplus of food for further processing by means of flash-freezing. Unpacked goods that have already been offered for sale (in window display and/or in our showcases and on our counters) or that have exceeded certain times of exposure must be discarded for hygienic reasons and may not be put in circulation anymore. Therefore it is also not possible to pass this (low quantity of) food on to third parties.\n\nWe request product data sheets for all food we purchase from the respective suppliers, containing all information about ingredients and additives as well as allergens. This information is entered into our merchandise management system and verified by a second person before any item is released. This allergen information is automatically transferred into our recipes, thus always being currently displayed in the online menu, on the monitors and the digital labels.\n\nDespite maximum accuracy and diligence, we cannot avoid traces of allergens other than those indicated for a meal from being transmitted. All our employees are regularly and intensely trained regarding this matter.\n\nThe Mehrweg-to-go system, the Relevo app and the use of all dishes are free of charge for our guests.\n\nYou can use the Relevo reusable tableware free of charge within 14 days. During these two weeks you will be reminded of the return period several times in the app and by email. After that, Relevo will charge you a climate fee for a bowl not returned on time in the amount of 10€ and a mug in the amount of 5€. If they are not returned, they are considered to have been bought. This should enable a constant cycle: After all, the dishes shouldn’t pile up at home, because then they’ll be missing at the counters of the Mensa and Cafeteria.\n\nThe Relevo reusable tableware is robust. There should be little or no scratch marks with normal use. You can put the bowls and mugs back into the reusable cycle and do not need to buy the dishes. If, after repeated use, there are clearly visible signs of use, the dishes will be replaced by us after they have been returned. Dishes that can no longer be used are fed into the recovered substance cycle and since it is completely recyclable, new materials can be created from it."
