However, the Limited Basic package typically provides only 20-30 channels and usually does not include local affiliate stations like NBC, ABC, CBS or Fox.

Here are some of the Spectrum TV plans that supply NBC:\n\nSpectrum Select - 125+ channels starting at $45/month. NBC is typically included.\n\nSpectrum Silver - 175+ channels starting at $75/month. Includes all local affiliates like NBC.\n\nSpectrum Gold - 200+ channels for $95/month. Contains NBC and most other major channels.\n\nSo you will need at least Select or higher to get NBC as part of your channel lineup on Spectrum. Double check at ordering to confirm NBC is supplied in your Spectrum TV plan.\n\nHow to Watching NBC on Spectrum HD Channels\n\nIn additional to standard definition channels, Spectrum also provides high-definition (HD) channels for NBC and most other major networks. NBC's HD channel on Spectrum has several potential channel placements:\n\nChannel 785 - Look for NBC HD on this channel in many markets.\n\nChannel 1285 - Another common HD channel NBC is found on.\n\n1000-range HD channels - NBC HD may also be supplied between channels 1000-1999.\n\nFinding the NBC HD channel will provide you with the best picture quality and viewing experience.
