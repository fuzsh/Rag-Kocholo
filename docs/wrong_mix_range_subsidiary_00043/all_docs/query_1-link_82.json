        "text": "There’s a battle raging inside your television, and it’s not between the major networks. Remember when ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox would compete against each other for the top spot? They’d debut new shows in primetime slots in hopes of dominating the ratings and rankings.\n\nBoy, have times changed. Network television is hanging on by a string. Internet-based, subscription video on demand (SVOD) services have become the new norm. SVOD services are by no means brand new. In fact, you probably subscribe to one (or more) of the popular providers. Between Netflix, Hulu, HBO Now and Amazon Prime, consumers can pay a monthly fee to access thousands of television shows, movies and more.\n\nAnd pay they do. Revenues for these services neared $20 billion in 2018, and virtually every platform gained subscribers and revenue last year as well. It’s not just consumers that are taking notice. Quality content has started to dominate SVOD. Did you happen to catch this year's Emmy Awards show? Streaming services brought home some of the night’s most prestigious awards.\n\nBut this has become par for the course. What really stood out were the ad spots for forthcoming streaming services. Between Disney and Apple, it seemed like every other commercial was a promo for new content on a new service.\n\nWhich brings us to the elephant in the room.\n\nHow Disney, Apple And More Are Raising The Stakes\n\nIn November 2019, Disney+ is slated to launch. This will not only provide additional options for television viewers, but it will raise the stakes in an already competitive industry. They’re not the only major player entering the already competitive game, though. Apple, AT&T and NBCUniversal all have SVOD services in the works.\n\nSo, what does this mean? It means an already fast-moving industry is about to get even more cutthroat. But how did we get here?\n\nWay back in 2015, when SVOD was still a novel concept, a company called Sling TV debuted the first \"skinny bundle.\" Like Netflix and Hulu, Sling TV was a streaming service, but it also contained a paid television multichannel component not unlike cable or satellite. Where it differed from its parent company, Dish, however, was that Sling offered skinny bundles of live TV channels, with a few caveats.\n\nUnlike cable, the bundle contained fewer channels. However, Sling TV did boast a few key selling points: customization, convenience and price. Its skinny bundles enabled customers to modify their base packages with add-on options. It allowed them to stream on various devices. And it did so at a rate that was generally more affordable than cable packages.\n\nWhere Does That Bring Us Today?\n\nI’d argue that we’ve moved past convenience and customization. On one hand, viewers basically expect their favorite content to be on-demand across all devices. Although some companies still offer serialized content (we’re looking at you, Sunday night HBO series), others release an entire season at once. (Admit it: You’ve binge-watched at least one Netflix series).\n\nI’m also comfortable making the claim that viewers are used to recommended and suggested content tailored around their preferences and watching habits. Using Netflix as an example, the company offers personalized recommendations that help users discover relevant content. To call this proprietary algorithm complex is an understatement, as Netflix splits viewers into more than 2,000 taste groups. The algorithm is effective, too. More than 80% of the shows people watch on the service are discovered through this system.\n\nHow Will Companies Excel In The Future? What Will Set Streaming Services Apart From Their Competitors?\n\nPrice and choice may be the two most important factors in the immediate future, with price being the most obvious angle. In 2019, Netflix unveiled its biggest price hike in company history, as the monthly fee jumped 18% from $10.99 per month to $12.99 per month. While this increase is significant, the current Netflix pricing is still in the ballpark of several of its competitors: Hulu runs monthly subscribers $11.99 per month and HBO Now is $14.99 per month.\n\nWhere things get interesting is that Disney+ is planning to debut at $7 per month, which is just about half the price of HBO Now and Netflix. From the sound of things, this isn’t your ordinary bait-and-switch package that requires immediate upgrades. In addition to a library of content, this price includes four simultaneous streams, 4K quality and Dolby Atmos surround sound.\n\nBut is price alone enough to cause Netflix devotees to make a full switch? For now, I’d argue that saving a few bucks may not be quite enough to convince everyone. So, what will? Content selection may be the silver bullet.\n\nAs evidenced by the aforementioned award show sweep, nearly all platforms have solid streaming selections. In addition to highly reviewed original content, many platforms lease content from major networks. For example, beloved sitcoms like Seinfeld and Friends currently stream on Hulu and Netflix, respectively. That’s all about to change. It was recently announced that AT&T’s WarnerMedia streaming app will reclaim both shows, as the company owns NBC.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, Disney is bringing its A-game as well. In addition to an already impressive library of Disney and Pixar movies — including the Star Wars franchise — Disney+ will be the eventual home of the Marvel universe. In March 2019, Disney acquired a large part of 21st Century Fox for $71.3 billion, bringing its stake in the company to 60%, and expanded its access to some of the industry’s most recognizable shows, including The Simpsons.\n\nIt’s clear that the streaming wars are still raging. It will be interesting to see what AT&T, Apple and others bring to the table. We can certainly expect to see some more original content. But it will be equally interesting to see where our favorite shows and films end up, and how much consumers will be willing to pay for each platform."
