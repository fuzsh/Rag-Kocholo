        "text": "Why Streaming Services Remove Content Including Originals from their Platforms\n\nFebruary 02, 2023\n\nParamount Plus has become the latest streaming service to remove low-performing content from its vast library. Real World: Homecoming, the true-crime show Interrogation, Jordan Peele’s reboot of the Twilight Zone, the dark comedy Guilty Party, the crime drama Coyote, the comedy series No Activity, and the animated show The Harper House are all getting the axe.\n\nShowtime and Paramount+ are in the process of merging into a single service with the unwieldy name Paramount+ with Showtime. In preparation for this integration, Showtime is also purging content. And shows with some big names attached are included. Showtime isn't kidding when they say Kidding starring Jim Carey has to go. Crime drama American Rust starring Jeff Daniels will be left to rust. Well, not really. It is getting a second season on Amazon's terribly-named Freevee service. On Becoming a God in Central Florida, a dark comedy starring Kirsten Dunst is also being pulled.\n\nIn August 2022, Variety reported that HBO Max had removed 36 titles, including 20 originals. HBO Max \"attributed the decision to the pending merge of the platform with Discovery+.\" Several of the dropped shows were family or children's programming. AMC dropped the legal drama 61st Street even though the second season had already finished filming.\n\nCord Cutting For Dummies\n\nSo why do streaming services remove shows from their platforms? And why would they remove the originals they paid so much to create. There are a few reasons.\n\nTaxes, Taxes, Taxes\n\nWhen HBO Max canceled the Batgirl movie, taxes were a major motivator. James M. Bandoblu, Jr., a partner at New York-based law firm Hodgson Russ told Newsweek, \"By shelving the Batgirl film, Warner Bros. will be able to reduce the loss incurred in producing Batgirl against its net income from other movies. Thus, the loss from Batgirl will reduce taxable income.\" Warner Bros. didn't think the movie would do well, so they decided to cut their losses.\n\nDeadline made a similar point about AMC dropping content. \"AMC Network said today it will take write-downs for up to $475 million as it restructures its business to cut costs.\" AMC calls these decisions “strategic programming assessments.”\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter also lists tax write-offs as a reason to remove original content. Another is the potential to sell the rights to a show and license it to a third party. An example of this is moving American Rust to Freevee. \"Removing completed seasons allows Showtime and their competitors to take a tax write-down on content as well as shop titles that are owned in-house to third-party buyers as many seek to monetize content that underperformed.\"\n\nReducing Costs\n\nAnother big financial motivator is that by dropping titles from their platforms, streaming providers no longer have to shell out money to the casts, crews, and creators of low-performing content. When streamers drop poorly performing titles, they save money that would have been paid out as residuals to actors and writers.\n\nRemoving Clutter\n\nLastly, many services want to declutter by removing content few subscribers want to watch. HBO Max acquired Sesame Street in 2019 as part of a five-year deal, but children's content, including Sesame Street, isn't doing well on the platform. There is little reason to continue hosting content viewers aren't interested in watching.\n\nNetflix is said to have a “discovery” problem because there is so much content on the platform that it's hard to find their best stuff. Streaming services don't want to get a reputation for having a lot of low-value shows and movies. Households are increasingly balking at paying high costs for cable and satellite services that are filled with rarely viewed channels. Every subscriber pays for those channels that they don't watch. The same is true for streaming services. Subscribers are paying for low-performing content they don't watch. By removing poor performers, streaming platforms can cut costs, which ultimately benefits subscribers.\n\nYouTube TV, Hulu TV, Sling, DirecTV Stream, Fubo TV & Philo Side-by-Side Comparison\n\nDecember 12, 2022\n\nA few years ago, I did a side-by-side comparison of streaming TV services; since then, a lot has changed. So, it's time for an update. One of the biggest changes from my previous video is price. That's what I will start with.\n\nOne thing I have included is the price per channel. This is a rough estimate because most of these services don't provide the exact number of channels. For example, Youtube TV has 100+ as its channel count, while Philo has 60+. So, I use those numbers for my calculation.\n\nThe cheapest option is Philo. However, it's cheap because it doesn't have any local channels or sports channels. It has some news channels but not the big three: CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC. Philo charges roughly 42 cents per channel. The next cheapest is Sling. Sling does come with the big three news channels. However, offerings vary by plan.\n\nSling has two plans: Blue and Orange. You can pay extra to get both. The Blue plan is the most generous, with 41 channels, while Orange has only 31. Blue and Orange combined offer 47 channels, so obviously, there is a lot of channel overlap. Sling Orange has ESPN, while Blue doesn't. It's actually very easy to switch between plans. For example, if you signed up for Blue but want to watch ESPN, you can switch back and forth. I've done it a bunch of times. Sling Orange is the second most expensive option based on per-channel cost. Sling also has a bunch of add-ons like a news add-on, kids add-on, and sports add-on. Sling does offer local channels, but only NBC and Fox. However, they don't offer them in all markets, so check if they are offered in your area before signing up.\n\nHulu with Live TV is the most expensive, but it does come with ad-supported Hulu. It's also stingy with channels, offering only 60+ for $70 a month. Fubo TV is considered the best option for sports. It also has the second lowest per-channel cost. It's on par with Hulu and DirecTV Stream in terms of cost but offers a lot more channels. FuboTV and DirecTV Stream have multiple plans. I only included their cheapest plans here. Check the description for links to their plans.\n\nStreaming TV Price Comparison\n\nNext is DVR space. Four of these plans offer unlimited DVR space. However, Philo offers unlimited for a year, meaning content expires when it hits the one-year point. Sling has the stingiest DVR offering with just 50 hours of space. However, you can upgrade to 200 hours for $5 a month. When the DVR fills up, the oldest content is deleted to make room for new recordings. This could be a problem if several family members are sharing the DVR. If you record a movie or show and put off watching it for a while, it may not be there when you are ready to sit down and watch. The only other limited DVR offering is from Fubo, but that is a more generous 1000 hours. Hulu with Live TV and Sling are the only services that don't offer a free trial.\n\nStreaming TV DVR and Free Trial\n\nLast up is simultaneous streams and the number of accounts or profiles. DirecTV Stream doesn't have profiles. However, it does offer unlimited screens at home and 3 on the go. Fubo TV is kind of confusing. If I understand correctly, all of their plans come with the Unlimited option, but that unlimited option allows viewing on up to 10 screens at home and 2 on the go. If you sign up for their Family Share add-on, you get an extra screen on the go. You can also purchase an Unlimited add-on. I don't know if that means you get an extra 10 screens for up to 20. They don't explain it very well. Fubo TV allows up to 6 profiles. With YouTube TV, you can have up to 6 accounts, each of which comes with a DVR. However, only 3 accounts can be used at the same time.\n\nWhen I made my video three years ago, a few of these providers had a two-screen limit. Hulu with Live TV is the only holdout. They still only allow viewing on 2 screens. You can pay $9.99 to get Unlimited screens and 3 on the go. Hulu allows up to 6 profiles. Sling TV doesn't have profiles. The Orange plan allows viewing on only one screen. The Blue Plan is more generous, allowing 3 simultaneous streams. If you pay for both, you can stream on up to 4 devices at the same time. Philo offers up to 10 profiles and allows streaming on up to 3 devices at the same time.\n\nStreaming TV Simultaneous Streams & Accounts\n\nIn my opinion, YouTube TV and Fubo TV are the two best options out of these six. They have the largest number of channels and some of the lowest per-channel costs. YouTube has the best DVR of the two, while Fubo is better for simultaneous streams. Hulu with Live TV is the most overpriced based on what you get. It's $70 for only 60+ channels and 2 simultaneous streams. Of the two cheapest options, I think Sling has broader appeal because it offers two local channels in many areas, the major news channels, and some sports options. I hope this side-by-side comparison gives you some idea of which streaming service is best for you.\n\nWhy Audiences Love Black Adam But Critics Don't\n\nOctober 28, 2022\n\nSometimes critics and audiences largely agree on how they feel about a show or movie, and sometimes there's a vast gulf between them. The movie Black Adam, based on a DC Comics character, is an example of the latter. It has a 39% Rotten score with critics on Rotten Tomatoes but a 90% Fresh score with audiences. The gulf is even larger when filtered for Top Critics only. They give the movie just 29%. So, why do critics dislike this movie?\n\nThe MovieFreak.com reviewer thinks Black Adam \"is nothing more than a splashy two-hour coming attractions reel for future motion pictures...It's like the team took a Superhero Storytelling 101 course and this is their final project. This is connect-the-dots filmmaking.\"\n\nEntertainment Weekly says that minor comic book characters getting their own movies \"speaks not to unearthed gold but the restless, insatiable appetite of today's superhero industrial complex...Black Adam is what happens when artists say they want to go dark but don't really have the stomach for it.\"\n\nThe NPR reviewer said, \"Black Adam seems perfectly content to pick over the wilted remains of the superhero-movie salad bar.\" According to this reviewer, Dr. Fate is equivalent to Dr. Strange, Atom-Smasher to Ant-Man, and Eternium to Vibranium. He also complains that the movie isn't political. The \"homegrown would-be tyrant\" is \"put there intentionally to assuage, to reassure, to smooth any feathers that might get ruffled by the blandest suggestion of Western culpability in the oppression of even a fictional people.\"\n\nThe Atlantic reviewer suggests that the movie is nothing more than a money grab.\n\n\"Black Adam would be busy enough setting up the origin story of one new crime fighter, but it instead introduces half a dozen, each of whom will vie for space on children's lunch boxes and supporting roles in sequels over the next decade.\"\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle reviewer doesn't think much of the DC lineup. \"Can we just say it? When you get past Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman, the DC superheroes are a sorry lot.\" He also asks, \"Is there anything more boring than two superheroes fighting each other, when you're rooting for neither, and yet the movie expects you to like them both? Of course, they can't hurt each other, because — wait for it — they're superheroes, and also because it's middle of the movie.\"\n\nSo, why did audiences love it? Usually, when I go through audience reviews, I find many that are fairly in-depth explanations for why a reviewer liked or disliked a show or movie. But there are few such reviews for Black Adam, even from Verified reviewers on Rotten Tomatoes. Many are nothing more than a line or two.\n\nTravis thinks the movie has, \"Great action. Need more of a back story and less characters.\"\n\nFirst L says, \"Tons of action, funny moments and a few scenes that were tugging at my heart strings.\"\n\nAndrew is \"not sure why the critics are trashing this movie ... its exactly what you hope to see in a superhero movie ... I actually liked that they had a lot more action then some others it seemed and they did not over use the comedy parts like some marvel movies have started to do.\"\n\nRena says, \"It was sketchy at first but the end was epic\"\n\nRon thinks, \"If you like action..this is the one.\"\n\nMarie78 says, \"Surprisingly I enjoyed this movie. Towards the beginning I thought it was just a low budget take on Marvel characters but I ended up enjoying the film. It was action-packed along with comedy.\"\n\nJeff S had some issues with the movie, but mostly enjoyed it.\n\n\"Other than a kid that couldnt act and a middling script, this was a blast! I love that DC is willing to give us darker heroes than Marvel (though I love Marvel as well), and Pierce Brosnan was FANTASTIC!!!\"\n\nColleen says, \"Fun, action packed anti-hero, hero movie! Everyone on point in this flick!\"\n\nAnthony H says, \"Great film finally DC got it right!!\"\n\nAudience reviewers seem to love the movie because it's filled with action. The professional critics would have preferred something darker and more political with fewer superhero tropes. But between surging gas prices, inflation, the war, and the pandemic, many ordinary people just want an escape. They want something entertaining that allows them to forget their problems for a couple of hours. Black Adam provides that escapism by just being fun."
