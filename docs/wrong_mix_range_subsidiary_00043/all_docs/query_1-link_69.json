        "text": "By Andrew Jenck\n\nWelcome to Binge-uary: a mini-series of Drew’s Reviews, editorials discussing the landscape of the streaming industry. One of the most defining aspects of the 2010s is the rise of Netflix. What started out as the mail-order rival to Blockbuster Home Video, transformed itself into a streaming platform, boasting a wide variety of movies and TV shows. It was such a great deal that people began cutting their cable cords and took part in this new way to watch, and the TV networks were also watching. Netflix had put entertainment companies in a dilemma: these large subsidiaries owning the major movie studios and TV networks were seeing a dip in revenue from theater ticket sales, cable fees, and DVD box sets with this new platform, but divorcing themselves from Netflix would only create contempt among consumers who would stick to Netflix rather than seeing more of their products.\n\nHence, the media conglomerates looked to combat Netflix with Hulu. Although this streaming service existed before Netflix’s streaming, Netflix’s dominance inspired Disney, Fox, Warner Bros., Universal, and other smaller companies to invest in the service. Hulu was meant as a happy medium with content being provided the day after it aired on live TV along with other, older TV shows. However, with its financial struggles, and becoming a majority owned subsidiary of Disney following its acquisition of 21st Century Fox, this prompted studios to instead branch off and create their own Netflix-equivalents.\n\nNovember 12, 2019 will go down as the beginning of studio-run streaming services that being the launch of Disney+ with Warner Bros.’ expansion of HBO and NBC/Universal’s Peacock set for this year. CBS All Access will likely expand its content following its merger with Viacom, Inc., parent owner of Paramount Pictures, Nickelodeon, and other channels. So, many programs and films will be pulled from Netflix, Hulu, and Prime Video within the next few years. This can all be very confusing, so to simplify things, I prepared a chart that lists what outlets and properties will be on which websites:\n\nA few notes need to be made. Fox and ABC both appear on Disney+ and Hulu, as family-friendly content will be placed on Disney+ and more mature content will be placed on Hulu, as Disney owns both services. Also note, just because a channel may air a show does not necessarily mean it owns that show. For example, The Big Bang Theory was CBS’ flagship series but was produced by Warner Television, so it will find an exclusive home on HBO Max. CBS All Access in general is an odd duck which will be covered in more depth later.\n\nStreaming doesn’t stop with Netflix clones, however. Cable and satellite-free live TV are also available with YouTube TV, Sling TV, and Hulu’s Live TV option; their channel offerings can be found in the links here:\n\nYT: https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/?utm_source=pm&utm_medium=gs&utm_campaign=1006175\n\nSling TV: https://www.sling.com/\n\nHulu: https://www.hulu.com/live-tv"
