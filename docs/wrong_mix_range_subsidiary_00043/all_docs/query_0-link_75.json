He currently serves as president of digital and IT at Dell Services\n\n“For the past six years, I have seen up close the immeasurable impact Marge has had on our company. She has been invaluable throughout TEGNA’s transformation and has always done what’s best for our employees, customers and communities. I know I have big shoes to fill. I want to thank Marge for her many years of outstanding service to TEGNA and wish her well,” said Elias in a statement. “I am honored to build on Marge’s legacy and look forward to working with Dave and his leadership team, our Board and employees to serve our customers, shareholders and the greater good of our communities.”\n\nTegna has also appointed Stuart Epstein, a co-managing partner at Evolution Media and former executive vice president and chief financial officer of NBCUniversal, to its board.\n\nRELATED: Tegna Q3 revenues drop 11%\n\n“[Epstein’s] combination of media, technology and financial experience will help TEGNA successfully navigate the opportunities that lie ahead.
