        "text": "Sling TV is beta testing a new version of its IP-based service that allows subscribers to stream to three different devices simultaneously.\n\nThe new service also adds FOX Broadcasting, and other Fox channels, including FX, National Geographic, and local Fox-owned regional sports channels such as the Yes Network. Streaming of local Fox owned-and-operated stations is also included.\n\nThe service is priced at the same $20-a-month as Sling's core tier and includes AMC, A&E, Turner Networks channels, Scripps and Univision. The new tier, however, does not include ESPN or other Disney channels, which remain core programming elements of the existing Sling TV service.\n\nAn IP-based platform that delivers major cable channels with the sign-up and cancellation ease of the major SVOD services, Sling TV was launched by Dish Network (NASDAQ: DISH) in February 2015.\n\nAnalysts estimated that the service had more than 500,000 subscribers as of the end of last year. But competition for inexpensive, IP-based pay-TV services is developing, with Sony managing to lower its price point and add channels to its previously maligned PlayStation Vue service.\n\nSling TV has been largely well received, but the service's limit of one stream at a time per household has limited its appeal somewhat. The exclusion of local broadcast channels has also been a criticism.\n\nAddressing the latter issue, Sling has quietly began offering ABC in a $5-a-month \"Broadcast Extra\" add-on package, which also includes Univision and UniMÃ¡s channels.\n\nFor more:\n\n- read this Dish/Sling TV press release"
