        "text": "LOS GATOS, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Audible Magic, the leading provider of enterprise-class automatic content recognition (ACR) solutions announced that the company was recently issued three new patents. This brings the total patents awarded to the company to 30 overall in areas such as digital fingerprint-based media detection technology, detection of content on media-playing devices, identification of content flow across networks, and approaches to media identification information systems performance.\n\n“Audible Magic’s intellectual property portfolio, plus our experience in massively scalable content identification and information services, makes the company’s offerings a preferred choice among the largest names in media and technology industries”\n\nThe recently-issued patents include:\n\nEuropean Patent EP 1 490 767 B1, for copyright detection and protection system method regarding digital data processing. This patent involves identifying, reporting, and/or protecting digital works from unauthorized transmission and/or copying, such as over networks or network segments connected to the Internet.\n\nU.S. patent 8,732,858 B2, for identifying digital data content; a computing system selects data from an unknown work and detects each event. It determines an event metric between each successive event and generates a list of metrics between the events, comparing event metrics for the unknown work to those of a known work, to determine if the unknown work is a copy of the known work.\n\nU.S. patent 8,645,279 B2, in copyright detection and protection system method, for detecting against unauthorized transmission of digital works.\n\nThe generation of patents by this privately-funded company has enabled Audible Magic to establish itself as the leader in ACR solutions. “Audible Magic’s intellectual property portfolio, plus our experience in massively scalable content identification and information services, makes the company’s offerings a preferred choice among the largest names in media and technology industries,” said Vance Ikezoye, CEO. Visit Audible Magic’s website for the full patent documents.\n\nAudible Magic is the trusted leader in automatic content recognition (ACR) fingerprinting technologies. The company offers a broad range of hosted solutions as well as hardware and software products that identify audio and video content, synchronize actions between media devices, trigger user interactivity, generate usage reporting and activate content monetization. Audible Magic’s customers and partners span technology, entertainment and media industries and include industry leaders such as Dailymotion, Ensequence, Sling Media, Sony Music and SoundCloud.\n\nCrunch Digital Forms Strategic Partnership with Audible Magic\n\nLos Angeles, CA, October 28, 2014 - Today Crunch Digital, the data management and reporting service that bridges digital rights owners with content licensees, is announcing RegistryID™, their new system that will streamline music licensing and reporting. As an integral part of the RegistryID system, Crunch Digital has entered a strategic partnership with Audible Magic, the leader in automated content recognition (ACR) solutions for copyrighted content.\n\nMatching music to copyright ownership data affects many digital services, apps and games. Finding the correct copyright owners and verifying licensing can become a monumental barrier for digital services. Over the last four years, Crunch Digital developed one of the most comprehensive registries for sound recording and musical composition metadata in the world. The release of RegistryID™, expected early next year, will enable distributors to verify licensing rights with music publishers for their content worldwide, ensuring that proper permissions have been obtained before the work is made available on their platform. RegistryID™ will be integrated with Crunch Digital's existing data management and reporting solutions.\n\nWhen content is added to a provider's platform, RegistryID will use Audible Magic's fingerprinting solution to match the content against registered sound recordings. If a match is found, RegistryID will then associate registered content with an underlying musical composition and its owners or administrators. Then the system can determine if a license is in effect for the musical composition to ultimately \"block\" or \"allow\" use on the platform based on licensing terms specified by the provider.\n\n\"Crunch Digital's RegistryID addresses a problem we have seen for years in the digital marketplace,\" said Vance Ikezoye, Audible Magic's CEO. \"Being able to match sound recordings to the underlying composition and verifying licenses can certainly enable access to more music for many delivery platforms.\"\n\n\"We are excited to work with Audible Magic to enable our RegistryID,\" said Keith Bernstein, founder of Crunch Digital. \"Their fingerprinting technology allows us to deliver fast, robust responses to our customers so that they can focus on the customer experience without worrying about copyright issues.\"\n\nAbout Audible Magic Audible Magic is the trusted leader in automatic content recognition (ACR) fingerprinting technologies. The company offers a broad range of hosted solutions as well as hardware and software products that identify audio and video content, synchronize actions between media devices, trigger user interactivity, generate usage reporting and activate content monetization. Audible Magic's customers and partners span technology, entertainment and media industries.\n\nAbout Crunch Digital Crunch Digital™ is an independent technology firm whose mission is to eliminate the barriers of licensing and payments in the media & entertainment marketplace, fueling better revenue flow, improving business intelligence, and reducing operating costs for content licensees and content owners. Crunch Digital manages data flow for content licensees - digital service providers, multi-channel networks, game companies, app developers and mobile carriers - including royalty reporting for direct licenses. Crunch Digital also services content owners - including record labels, music publishers, audio book publishers, film & television studios and game publishers.\n\nLOS GATOS, Calif.--Audible Magic, the market leader in automatic content recognition (ACR) solutions, today announced it is bundling its TV content identification and synchronization technology with information services from SportsData, the fastest-growing sports data company in the United States. Available today, these bundled services provide broadcasters and app developers the ability to present play-by-play sports information as events are watched on television.\n\nAudible Magic will demonstrate this synchronized-information solution April 7-10 at the NAB Show in Las Vegas, booth SU10112.\n\nMany broadcasters and app developers already use Audible Magic’s ACR technology to recognize TV content playing on or near a smart device such as a phone, tablet or set-top box. Once a TV show’s audio content is identified, the ACR function also allows apps to present information content synchronized with the events of the program. With the Audible Magic-SportsData Synchronization Bundle, play-by-play statistics and other information can be presented as a game unfolds.\n\nThe information synchronization works whether the game is being watched live or viewed from a delayed playback source, such as a DVR or video stream. The bundle can enhance viewing of a wide range of televised sports, including professional and college football, basketball, baseball, hockey, golf, auto racing, horse racing, tennis, and soccer.\n\nIn Audible Magic’s demonstration at NAB, a tablet app “listens” over its microphone to a basketball game playing on a nearby TV. The app initially recognizes which game is being watched. Then, as action unfolds, the app displays information about the players and the plays they just executed. The app also displays graphics pinpointing the location of the play just made.\n\n“We anticipate sports broadcasters and app developers applying a great deal of creativity using this bundled service,” said Curt Dowdy, Audible Magic’s vice president of marketing. “With this kind of solution running on mobile apps, set-top boxes and smart TVs, very soon viewers will experience entirely new and compelling ways to interact with their favorite sports and players’ stats.”\n\n“We are thrilled to partner with a leading technology provider like Audible Magic,” said Rob Phythian, CEO of SportsData. “This synchronization service will help companies deliver innovative first and second screen products to meet the real-time information needs of today’s highly engaged sports fans.”\n\nThe SportsData Synchronization Service extends Audible Magic’s already robust set of media content identification and information databases. The company also provides hosted content identification and synchronization for live and archived TV shows, live and archived TV advertising, motion pictures and music tracks.\n\nAbout Audible Magic Audible Magic provides technologies that make media devices, apps and networks content aware. The company is the trusted leader in digital fingerprinting techniques that recognize audio and video content in all forms across radio and television broadcasts, Internet streams, cable and satellite transmissions, and stored digital files, and on consumer devices such as smart TVs, set-top boxes, smart phones, tablets, and other appliances.
