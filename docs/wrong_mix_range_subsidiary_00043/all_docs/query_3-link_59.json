        "text": "Click for PDF\n\nIn honor of Data Privacy Day—an international effort to raise awareness and promote privacy and data protection best practices—we offer this sixth edition of Gibson Dunn’s Cybersecurity and Data Privacy Outlook and Review. In 2017, companies were again challenged to navigate a constantly evolving landscape of cybersecurity and privacy issues. Last year revealed some of the largest data breaches in history, saw a new administration’s shift in priorities regarding cybersecurity, and exposed new challenges posed by increasingly “smart” and connected devices.\n\nAmong other key regulatory developments this year, the Trump administration issued an executive order addressing the cybersecurity of federal networks and critical infrastructure. The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) announced a new Cyber Unit focused on targeting cyber-related misconduct and pursued cases involving novel cyber issues, including insider trading in the wake of a data breach. The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) remained active in the privacy and cybersecurity space, but indicated a shift of focus to cases involving “substantial consumer injury.” The Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) continued enforcement of regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), announcing several notable settlements. The Federal Communication Commission’s (“FCC”) role in privacy enforcement was substantially adjusted following the repeal of privacy rules put in place in 2016. And state attorneys general were active at the forefront of concerted efforts to bring enforcement actions and develop privacy and cybersecurity regulations. Indicative of this collaboration, 2017 saw the largest state data breach settlement in history.\n\nLast year also saw frequent data breaches of varying magnitudes. Throughout the year, hackers targeted government agencies and companies in every industry, seeking personally identifiable information (“PII”), customer login information, payment information, and health care information, among others. As litigation—especially class action litigation—quickly followed many of the announced breaches, courts continued to grapple with standing issues in the wake of Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins. New class actions related to connected devices, such as TVs and cars, were also filed in 2017, and 2018 will likely see developments in this arena as more courts begin assessing standing in the context of the Internet of Things.\n\nOverlapping international privacy frameworks also posed significant challenges for U.S. companies in 2017. With the quickly approaching May 2018 deadline for compliance with Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), companies worked to put in place appropriate policies and other safeguards. Last year also saw many other countries impose new or updated cybersecurity and data privacy regulations.\n\nWe cover these topics and many more in this year’s Review: (I) U.S. regulation of privacy and data security; (II) civil litigation; (III) international regulation of privacy and data security; and (IV) government data collection and device unlocking. For additional coverage of international developments, please see our separate International Cybersecurity and Data Privacy Outlook and Review.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n__________________________________________\n\nI.

U.S. Regulation of Privacy and Data Security\n\nCompanies doing business in (and with) the United States continue to face a morass when it comes to government regulation of privacy and data security due to the competing and overlapping efforts of myriad federal and state government regulators in this space. Nearly every major federal agency has now weighed in on data security issues in one form or another, as have most states. Below, we cover the most notable enforcement efforts, regulatory guidance, and legislative developments from the past year.\n\nA. Enforcement and Guidance\n\n1. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”)\n\nIn 2017, the FTC remained one of the most active and far-reaching government agencies regulating privacy and data security. All told, the FTC announced 12 enforcement actions related to privacy and data security issues, while also making headlines with its related public statements and guidance. We address the most notable enforcement actions and guidance from the FTC below.\n\na. Data Security and Privacy Enforcement\n\nEquifax . In September 2017, the FTC announced it had begun investigating the massive data breach at Equifax Inc., the Atlanta-based consumer credit bureau. [1] The week before the announcement, Equifax revealed that in May, hackers had exploited a flaw in the company’s website that allowed them to access the account information of up to 143 million customers, including driver’s license numbers, addresses, birthdates, and Social Security numbers. This breach represented one of the largest in recent memory and, given the centrality of credit-reporting agencies to activity throughout the economy and the sensitive nature of the information involved, sparked renewed public scrutiny of data security issues. The FTC did not elaborate on the scope of its investigation, but the announcement itself was significant given that the Commission rarely comments on ongoing investigations.\n\nTaxSlayer . Further underscoring the FTC’s increased attention to companies that store consumer financial data, in August 2017 the Georgia-based online tax preparation service TaxSlayer, LLC, agreed to settle FTC allegations that it allowed hackers to access nearly 9,000 user accounts between October and December 2015. [2] The hackers then used this information to fraudulently obtain tax returns. The FTC alleged that TaxSlayer failed to implement adequate security measures, such as requiring strong passwords, providing a clear and conspicuous privacy notice, or conducting risk assessments. As part of the settlement, TaxSlayer agreed to obtain biennial third-party assessments of its compliance with data privacy regulations, but neither confirmed nor denied liability.\n\nLabMD . As we highlighted in our 2016 Year-End pdate , the now-defunct medical testing laboratory LabMD appealed an FTC order finding that the company failed to reasonably protect its customers’ personal information from data breaches and requiring it to establish a comprehensive information security program to safeguard against such breaches in the future. [3] In 2008, billing information for approximately 9,300 consumers became accessible on a peer-to-peer network, and other personal information for at least 500 consumers ended up in the hands of identity thieves. [4] The FTC’s order overturned the initial ruling of its own Administrative Law Judge, which had dismissed the Commission’s charges because they failed to show that the company’s conduct created a probability of harm. [5] In November 2016, the Eleventh Circuit granted the company’s request for a stay pending appeal of the Commission’s decision, [6] and this past June the court heard oral argument in the case. The Eleventh Circuit’s ruling could significantly reshape the FTC’s authority to regulate data privacy harms. At issue in the oral argument was whether the FTC must show proof of actual consumer harm to bring a data security enforcement action under Section 5 of the FTC Act. LabMD argued that the FTC overstepped its enforcement authority because no consumer suffered an actual injury as a result of the company’s data breach. The FTC countered that it nevertheless could exercise its enforcement authority under Section 5 because the unauthorized exposure of health care information constitutes a substantial injury under traditional principles of privacy tort law. The panel was expected to issue a ruling in the months after the oral argument, but it has not yet done so.\n\nD-Link . In January 2017, the FTC filed suit against the network equipment manufacturer D-Link Corp. over the company’s allegedly inadequate security measures in its routers and internet cameras. [7] In its complaint, the FTC alleged that the company’s failure to properly secure its routers and cameras left consumers vulnerable to hackers, particularly through their live video and audio feeds. Further, the complaint alleged that the company misled consumers by advertising on its website that its products are “Easy to Secure” and contain “Advanced Network Security.” In September, the district court granted in part and denied in part the company’s motion to dismiss the FTC’s complaint. [8] The district court’s ruling may have a dramatic impact on the FTC’s ability to bring claims against companies for putting consumers’ information at risk. The court found that three of the complaint’s six counts were pled inadequately or with insufficient particularity, and gave the FTC until late October to re-plead its claims. Specifically, the court found that, for the three dismissed claims, the FTC failed to adequately plead harm because it relied “solely on the likelihood that [D-Link] put consumers at ‘risk’ because ‘remote attackers could take simple steps, using widely available tools, to locate and exploit defendants’ devices, which were widely known to be vulnerable,'” [9] and that this amounts to “a mere possibility of injury at best.” [10] D-Link submitted its amended answer on October, and fact discovery is ongoing.\n\nVizio . In February 2017, TV manufacturer Vizio Inc. entered into a settlement with the FTC and the New Jersey Attorney General over allegations that it secretly gathered users’ viewing data and shared it with third parties. [11] The settlement is significant given the increasing ubiquity of so-called “smart” devices, from televisions to thermostats to electronic assistants. Specifically, the regulators alleged that beginning in February 2014, Vizio began collecting second-by-second information about the content displayed on its “smart TVs,” including content from cable, broadband, set-top boxes, streaming devices, and DVDs. Vizio allegedly appended this information with its users’ personal information, such as users’ age, sex, income level, marital status, household size, education level, home ownership, and home value. Vizio would then sell this information to third parties. As part of the settlement, Vizio agreed to pay $2.2 million and overhaul its data collection practices, as well as delete data obtained prior to March 1, 2016, and obtain affirmative consent from consumers regarding the company’s data collection practices. Notably, Acting Chairwoman Maureen Ohlhausen issued a concurring statement expressing skepticism that Vizio’s conduct caused, or was likely to cause, a substantial injury to consumers. As part of the settlement, Vizio neither admitted nor denied liability.\n\nLenovo . In September 2017, the FTC announced that it had entered into a settlement, along with 32 state Attorneys General, with Lenovo Inc. over allegations that the company preloaded some of its computers with invasive software that compromised consumers’ privacy and security. [12] The Commission alleged that, beginning in August 2014, Lenovo began selling laptops in the U.S. with a software program called VisualDiscovery, created by a company called Superfish, Inc., that would access consumers’ personal information transmitted via the internet, such as login info for websites, Social Security numbers, medical information, and financial and payment information. The software would then send some of this information to the software company’s servers, where the information was allegedly stored insecurely. This settlement is significant given the high value digital companies place on leveraging data regarding consumers’ preferences to target their advertisements. As part of the settlement, Lenovo must get consumers’ affirmative consent before preinstalling this sort of software; must implement a comprehensive software security program, which is subject to third-party audits for a period of 20 years; and must pay $3.5 million to state regulators. Lenovo neither admitted nor denied liability as part of the settlement.\n\nb. Data Breach Guidance\n\nWith the arrival of the Trump administration, and 3 open seats on the Commission, companies and commentators have been watching carefully for any signal of whether, and how, the FTC’s regulatory focus and enforcement priorities will change in coming years. Several recent statements provide some indication—albeit not definitive answers—about what the future may hold under the Trump administration.\n\nIn September, Acting FTC Chairwoman Maureen Ohlhausen said during a speech at the Federal Communications Bar Association that the FTC should focus on “substantial consumer injury” in determining which cases to pursue, rather than “hypothetical” harms. [13] “Government does the most good with the fewest unintended side effects when it focuses on stopping substantial consumer injury instead of expending resources to prevent hypothetical injuries,” Ohlhausen said. “So understanding consumer injury in the context of privacy and data security is very important for the commission.” [14]\n\nWhile the FTC thus seems poised to cede some regulatory ground by moving away from regulating speculative harms, Acting Chairwoman Ohlhausen has also signaled that the Commission may adopt a broader definition of what constitutes a “substantial” injury. In a speech at a cybersecurity event at the Georgetown University Law Center in May, Ohlhausen noted that the FTC historically has focused on direct financial harms to consumers, but that this understanding may be too narrow. [15] Health and safety risks, such as those posed by the sharing of real-time and highly accurate location data that may leave consumers vulnerable to stalking, could also constitute a substantial injury, as could the disclosure of sensitive medical information. Whether Joseph J. Simons, whom President Trump in October announced that he intended to nominate to head the FTC, will take positions similar to those of Acting Chairwoman Ohlhausen is yet to be seen.\n\nIn her September speech, Ohlhausen announced a December workshop at which the FTC would examine the consumer harms that stem from informational injury. Leading up to the workshop, a host of pro-business groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Association of National Advertisers, and the Retail Industry Leaders Association, issued public comments urging the Commission to adopt a regulatory framework designed to regulate actual injuries, rather than conjectural ones. [16] In contrast, several consumer groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center, encouraged the FTC to focus on the rise in data breaches and the concomitant increased risk of identity theft. The workshop took place on December 12, but the FTC has not yet announced any shifts in enforcement priorities as a result.\n\nc. Scope of Authority—Common Carriers\n\nAs we mentioned in our last update, in May the Ninth Circuit granted the FTC’s petition to rehear en banc a dispute between the Commission and AT&T over the company’s allegedly deceptive “data throttling.” [17] AT&T argued that it was not subject to the FTC’s authority because it is a common carrier, a category that Section 5 of the FTC Act excludes from the FTC’s jurisdiction. In August 2016, a Ninth Circuit panel agreed with AT&T that, because the company engaged in non-common carrier activities such as providing consumers with mobile data and email services, it fell outside the Commission’s regulatory ambit.\n\nThe full Ninth Circuit held oral argument in September but has not yet issued a ruling. An affirmance could significantly curtail the FTC’s jurisdiction.\n\n2. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”)\n\nThe flurry of HHS activity in 2016 related to the protection of patient privacy continued in 2017. As HHS continued the second-phase of its audit program to assess compliance with patient privacy provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), [18] HHS also announced several multimillion-dollar settlements with health care companies for alleged HIPAA violations.\n\nMatching the largest-ever HIPAA-related settlement, Memorial Healthcare Systems agreed to pay $5.5 million and implement a “robust corrective action plan” to settle claims that its employees had improperly accessed and disclosed information for over 115,000 patients. [19] HHS alleged that Memorial Health Care Systems failed to implement and manage user access rights and, despite results of previous risk analyses, failed to regularly review information system activity by employees and users at affiliated physician practices on applications that maintain protected information.\n\nHHS also fined Children’s Medical Center of Dallas $3.2 million for alleged HIPAA violations after two data breaches involving lost or stolen devices that contained unencrypted patient medical information. [20] The investigation by the Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”) found that the medical center failed to implement risk management plans and failed to use encryption on its devices despite previous warnings to do so.\n\nIn addition, St. Luke’s Roosevelt Hospital Center Inc. agreed to a settlement and corrective action plan following a complaint alleging that the hospital had faxed sensitive information concerning a patient’s HIV status. [21] Although the total settlement amounted only to $387,000, the agreement stemmed from only two disclosures of Protected Health Information (“PHI”), highlighting the potential impact of even seemingly limited events.\n\nHHS also announced several “firsts” in its HIPAA enforcement efforts, including the first enforcement action involving delayed reporting of a patient information breach and the first settlement with a wireless services provider. In the former, Presence Health agreed to pay $475,000 and revise its policies governing the privacy of patient information following allegations that it failed to properly notify more than 800 of its patients within 60 days of discovering that their personal information had been stolen. [22] In the latter, CardioNet, which provides remote mobile monitoring for patients at risk for cardio arrhythmias, agreed to pay $2.5 million and implement a corrective action plan for the alleged disclosure of unsecured electronic protected health information (“ePHI”) after an employee’s laptop was stolen from a parked vehicle. [23] OCR found that CardioNet had insufficient risk analysis and risk management processes in place at the time of the theft, as well as a lack of final policies and procedures implementing ePHI safeguards and the HIPAA Security Rule.\n\nClosing out the year, HHS OCR announced that 21st Century Oncology, Inc. agreed to pay $2.3 million and adopt a comprehensive corrective action plan to settle alleged violations of the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules that were uncovered after a hacker gained access to more than 2.2 million patient records, some of which were later sold to undercover agents from the FBI. [24]\n\nFinally, following Acting HHS Secretary Eric Hargan’s declaration of the opioid crisis as a public health emergency, HHS issued guidance regarding the circumstances in which health care providers may share a patient’s PHI with family members, friends, or legal representatives. [25] Focusing on patients who are in crisis or incapacitated, such as during an opioid overdose, the guidance interprets current HIPAA regulations as allowing health care providers to share information in certain emergency or dangerous situations, including with persons who are in a position to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to a patient’s health or safety. The guidance also discusses factors to consider in assessing a patient’s decision-making capacity and provides direction on health care providers’ ability to share PHI in different situations, including when unable to obtain a patient’s consent and after the patient has had an opportunity to object.\n\n3. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)\n\na. Cybersecurity Focus\n\nIn 2017, the SEC maintained the previous year’s focus on cybersecurity incidents with respect to both its external oversight responsibilities and the internal operations of the agency. Since the issuance of its cybersecurity guidance in 2011, the SEC has continued to emphasize proper communications regarding cybersecurity issues within a company’s management as well as proper disclosure of cybersecurity risks by registrants. [26]\n\nThe SEC announced in November that it will likely issue new guidance to public companies regarding disclosure and reporting of cybersecurity incidents. [27] Signaling this potential guidance, Acting Enforcement Director Stephanie Avakian stated in April that she could “absolutely” envision circumstances where enforcement would be necessary in light of a company’s failure to report cyber incidents and risks. [28] The new guidance may also include provisions encouraging companies to consider how they handle stock sales by corporate insiders around the time of a cybersecurity breach. [29] In November, Director of the SEC’s Division of Corporate Finance, William Hinman, stated, “it would be wise for folks to re-examine their insider trading policies.” [30]\n\nTwo cybersecurity incidents with potential insider trading consequences that may influence the SEC’s new guidance were disclosed in the fall of 2017. After Equifax discovered its massive breach in July—but before it was publicly reported in September—Equifax executives sold nearly $2 million in company stock. [31] Once the news of the breach broke, stock prices dropped significantly. [32] While the SEC has not confirmed or denied any SEC investigation of the executives for insider trading, Equifax reported in its third quarter 10-Q that the SEC had subpoenaed the company “regarding trading activities by certain employees in relation to the cybersecurity incident.” [33] The second incident occurred this fall when the SEC faced its own cybersecurity threat. On September 20, 2017, as part of its “Statement on Cybersecurity,” the SEC disclosed that a 2016 intrusion into EDGAR, the Commission’s electronic filing system for public company disclosures, may have allowed hackers to gain access to and trade on the basis of the non-public information exposed. [34] The SEC stated it did not believe the intrusion was the result of a systemic risk or that it led to the exposure of any personally identifiable information. [35] Days after the statement, the SEC announced the establishment of a Cyber Unit to “focus on targeting cyber-related misconduct.” [36]\n\nb. Cyber Unit’s First Charges\n\nOn December 4, 2017, the SEC announced the first charges filed by the newly established Cyber Unit. [37] The SEC’s complaint alleges that Dominic Lacroix and his company, PlexCorp, operated an Initial Coin Offering (“ICO”) fraud that raised over $15 million from investors by selling a security called PlexCoin, a cryptocurrency, and promising a 1,354 percent profit in less than one month. [38] The charges filed against PlexCorp, Lacroix, and his partner Sabrina Paradis-Royer [39] include violations of the anti-fraud provisions contained in Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, as well as registration provisions in Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act. [40] The district court issued an emergency order freezing the assets of the company and the executives charged, and the SEC is seeking permanent injunctions and disgorgement plus interest and penalties. The SEC is also seeking a Final Judgment prohibiting the two executives from offering digital securities in the future. [41]\n\n4. Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”)\n\na. FCC Rulemaking\n\ni. FCC Privacy Regulations for Broadband Providers Repealed\n\nOn April 3, 2017, President Trump signed a resolution repealing FCC privacy rules adopted in the prior year. [42] In 2016, the FCC adopted sweeping new regulations governing the ways in which providers of broadband Internet access service use and share their customers’ personal information. [43] There were three key components to the regulations for broadband providers: (1) notice to consumers of data collection and use policies; (2) an opt-out provision for “non-sensitive” information used or shared by the providers and a requirement to obtain affirmative opt-in consent before they can use or share “sensitive” customer data; and (3) more stringent and specific requirements for notification of any data breaches. The resolution was passed under the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to repeal agency rules through simple majority votes.\n\nii. FCC Approves Next-Gen Broadcasting Technology\n\nOn November 16, 2017, the FCC voted 3-2 to permit the use of a new broadcast transmission standard, known as ATSC 3.0 or Next Gen TV. This new broadcast standard will allow more precise geolocating of television signals, ultra-high definition picture quality, more interactive programming, and localized safety warnings that have the ability to turn on televisions as necessary to transmit emergency broadcasts. [44] Privacy advocates argue that ATSC 3.0 allows broadcasters to collect data on viewing habits, spurring user-targeted ads similar to those on the Internet. During a House Communications Subcommittee FCC oversight hearing in November, Representative Debbie Dingell requested that the FCC address the types of information broadcasters will be able to collect from consumers and how it will be handled and protected. [45]\n\nb. Cell Phone Cybersecurity\n\nOn August 24, 2017, the FCC’s Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau released Public Notice DA 17-799. This Notice was a result of Congress asking the FCC to tackle “fundamental security threats” to cell phones, since Congress felt current oversight by police and private entities “neither adequately addressed these serious cybersecurity vulnerabilities nor warned its customers about the risks they face.” The Notice encourages communications service providers to implement recommended security countermeasures to prevent exploitation of carrier Signaling System 7 (“SS7”) network infrastructure. [46] According to the Notice, security vulnerabilities present within SS7 networks allow attackers to obtain subscriber information, eavesdrop on subscriber traffic, engage in financial theft, and conduct denial-of-service attacks. The March 2017 recommendations for best practices to reduce SS7 security risks include: (1) awareness and protection, which covers the set of industry recommendations that advocate increased awareness of SS7 signaling and protective measures that can be deployed by telecommunication service providers; and (2) security best practices, which covers the set of industry recommendations that deal with best security best practices for SS7 communications.\n\nc. FCC Settlements / Enforcement\n\ni. $100M Settlement for Squatting on Spectrum Licenses\n\nOn January 12, 2017, a wireless spectrum trading company settled a dispute with the FCC over allegations it lied about its buildout of wireless infrastructure for $100 million and possible divestment from its spectrum licenses. [47] Because wireless spectrum is a scarce public resource, the FCC requires companies that license spectrum to put it to good use. In 2013 and 2014, the spectrum company received licenses in the 28GHz and 39GHz bands, which are identified for use in the next generation of cellular network, on the condition that it use them to provide services. [48] A November 2015 anonymous report alleged that the company never built several of the 39GHz systems it had told the FCC were completed. [49] As part of the settlement, the company agreed to pay a $100 million civil penalty, to surrender its licenses in the 39GHz spectrum, and to sell the remainder of its license portfolio.\n\nii. Robocall Fines\n\nOn June 22, 2017, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai stated that robocalls were the Commission’s top enforcement priority. [50] That same day, the FCC voted to fine a Miami man a record-breaking $120 million for allegedly making 96 million spoofed robocalls to consumers in three months in violation of the Truth in Caller ID Act. [51] Spoofing refers to deliberately falsifying caller ID information to disguise an identity with the intent to harm or defraud consumers, or wrongfully obtain anything of value. The calls—which appeared to come from local numbers—purported to offer vacation deals from major companies like TripAdvisor, Expedia, and others. Consumers who “pressed 1” were transferred to foreign call centers where operators attempted to sell them timeshares. TripAdvisor alerted the FCC to the robocalls after fielding complaints from its customers. In July and August, the FCC levied fines of nearly $3 million and $82 million against other companies for unsolicited robocalls, the magnitude of the latter due in part to the targeting of vulnerable consumers, including the elderly, the infirm, and low income families. [52]\n\n5. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”)\n\nThe CFPB was not particularly active in the area of data privacy and security in 2017. However, on October 18, 2017, the CFPB announced a series of non-binding Consumer Protection Principles to address the developing market for financial “aggregation services.” [53] Such companies offer a broad range of products and services that are developed using consumer-provided financial data. This data is collected and aggregated by financial services companies, “fintech” firms, and other companies. The services offered range from the provision of financial advice to the facilitation of underwriting or fraud-screening. The release of the Principles followed a November 2016 Request for Information to stakeholders in the “aggregation services” market. The Principles, intended to protect consumers who authorize third parties to collect their financial data to provide these services, are not intended to alter or interfere with the scope of existing consumer protections in this market. The CFPB simultaneously released a summary of the stakeholder insights underlying the development of the Principles. [54] The CFPB identified the following nine principles that providers of “aggregation services” should follow, all of which are anchored by the core belief that users should retain control over their information: [55]\n\nAccess: Users should be able to request and obtain information about their ownership or use of a financial product or service from the provider.\n\nData Scope and Usability: The scope of financial data subject to consumer and consumer-authorized access includes, but is not limited to, information about any transaction and the terms of an account. Information should be made available in a usable format for consumers and consumer-authorized third parties.\n\nControl and Informed Consent: Consumers should be entitled to a full and effective disclosure of the authorized terms of access, storage, use and disposal of information. Consumers should also be able to readily revoke authorization to access, use or store their data.\n\nAuthorizing Payments: A user’s consent to the access of data does not constitute consent for payment authorization. Providers may request both types of authorization from a consumer requesting its services.\n\nSecurity: Consumer data must be maintained securely. Parties with access to data must have adequate processes in place to protect against and effectively respond to data breaches.\n\nAccess Transparency: Users should be able to obtain information regarding the uses to which their information will be put and the parties to which it will be provided.\n\nAccuracy: Consumer data gathered by “aggregation services” must be accurate and up-to-date.\n\nAbility to Dispute and Resolve Unauthorized Access: Users should have the ability to dispute and resolve incidents involving unauthorized access and data sharing.\n\nEfficient and Effective Accountability Mechanisms: Commercial participants should be incentivized to protect consumer-provided data, but also must be held responsible for any risks they introduce to consumers.\n\nThe agency emphasized that the Principles do not “establish binding requirements or obligations relevant to the Consumer Bureau’s exercise of its rulemaking, supervisory, or enforcement authority.” [56] Nor are they intended to “provide guidance on existing statutes and regulations that apply in this market.” [57] Nevertheless, the CFPB stated that the Principles “express the Bureau’s vision for realizing a robust, safe, and workable data aggregation market” and suggested that the Bureau “will continue to monitor closely developments in this market.” [58] Thus, it is possible that as “aggregation services” and “fintech” firms become increasingly prevalent, the CFPB will become more involved with the regulation of data privacy-related issues.\n\n6. State Attorneys General\n\nState attorneys general play a key role in data privacy and security matters. During the past year, state attorneys general were at the forefront of concerted efforts to bring enforcement actions and develop privacy and cybersecurity regulations.\n\na. Collaboration Among Attorneys General\n\nDuring the past year, states increasingly coordinated their enforcement efforts with each other and with other government agencies to settle multi-state litigations involving mega-data breach cases. In May 2017, the Target Corporation (“Target”) reached an $18.5 million settlement—the largest state data breach settlement in history—with 47 states and the District of Columbia. The settlement brought an end to investigations jointly led by state attorneys general into Target’s November 2013 data breach involving unauthorized access to portions of Target’s computer systems that process payment card transactions at Target’s retail stores and to portions that store Target customer contact information. [59] Under the terms of the agreement, Target will be required to develop, implement, and maintain a comprehensive information security program, to hire a third party to conduct a security assessment, and implement additional administrative safeguards to further strengthen the company’s data security. [60]\n\nIn August 2017, 33 state attorneys general reached a $5.5 million multi-state settlement with Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company (“Nationwide”) and its wholly owned subsidiary Allied Property & Casualty Insurance Company (“Allied”) over a 2012 data breach. [61] The personal information of 1.27 million people was stolen when hackers exploited a vulnerability in Nationwide/Allied’s web application hosting software—a vulnerability that allegedly could have been remedied with a previously available software patch that Nationwide/Allied had failed to apply. [62]\n\nAs described more fully above, in September 2017 Lenovo reached a $3.5 million multi-state settlement to resolve charges brought by 32 state attorneys general and the FTC. [63] Of the 23 states involved in the settlement, California received the largest share, amounting to $389,204, based largely on its size and leadership role in the investigation. [64]\n\nFollowing the public announcement of the Equifax breach in September, Massachusetts became the first state to sue Equifax, claiming that Equifax failed to maintain the appropriate safeguards to protect consumer data, despite being aware of the vulnerabilities in its system for months. [65] On November 30, 2017, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation held a hearing on the pending motion to consolidate and transfer the numerous cases filed (and cases to be filed in the future) against Equifax to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, near the company’s headquarters in Atlanta. [66]\n\nb. Developments Within States\n\nThe California Attorney General settled a number of data breach and consumer protection cases. On November 22, 2017, the Attorney General settled a case with Cottage Health System (“Cottage Health”) and its affiliated hospitals to resolve allegations resulting from two separate and unrelated data breach incidents in 2013 and 2015. [67] The Attorney General alleged that Cottage Health failed to implement basic, reasonable safeguards to protect personal medical information, in violation of California’s Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, Unfair Competition Law, and HIPAA. [68] Under the terms of the settlement, Cottage Health agreed to update its security measures and pay a $2 million penalty. [69] Cottage Health was also required to hire a data privacy security officer to ensure it develops and follows appropriate procedures, as well as to begin completing annual privacy risk assessments. [70]\n\nThe New York Attorney General’s Office remained active in combatting violations of data security. On October 31, 2017, the New York Attorney General, along with the Vermont Attorney General, reached a $700,000 settlement with Hilton Domestic Operating Company, Inc., formerly known as Hilton Worldwide, Inc. (“Hilton”) as a result of two separate data security incidents in 2015 which exposed credit card numbers. [71] The investigation allegedly revealed that Hilton did not adequately protect consumers’ information and failed to provide timely notice of the breach, as New York General Business Law § 899-aa(2) requires notice to customers in the “most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay.” [72] The reached settlement, among other things, requires Hilton to maintain a comprehensive information security program designed to protect consumer cardholder data and to conduct annual data security assessments.\n\nAs noted earlier, on February 6, 2017 the New Jersey Attorney General reached a settlement agreement with Vizio, Inc., a smart TV maker, for alleged violations of consumer protection laws by collecting and sharing data on the viewing habits of its smart TV users without their consent. [73] Vizio agreed to pay $2.2 million and to change its data collection practices to resolve allegations, ending parallel investigations conducted by the Attorney General and the FTC. [74] The state obtained $1 million and the FTC obtained $1.5 million in the settlement. [75]\n\nThe Washington Attorney General released its second edition of the Annual Data Breach Report, containing a summary of the data collected from the data breach notifications required by Washington’s notification laws. [76] Since the 2015 amendment to Washington’s data breach laws, the Attorney General has actively enforced compliance with the state’s notification regulations.\n\n7. New York Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”)\n\nIn 2017, New York’s Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”) adopted groundbreaking regulations that broadly regulate cybersecurity within the financial services industry. NYDFS is the New York state regulator of financial services licensed in the state and thus supervises many large banks and insurance companies. Effective March 1, 2017, the NYDFS regulations require banks, insurance companies, and other financial services institutions subject to regulation by the NYDFS to establish and maintain a comprehensive cybersecurity program. [77] “Covered Entities” are required, among other things, to perform a risk assessment to assess their cyber risks, implement a written cybersecurity policy, and maintain a comprehensive cybersecurity program. [78] While some security measures were mandated by August 28, 2017, others are mandated by September 3, 2018, with a final compliance date of March 1, 2019. [79]\n\nThe final regulations, codified in 23 NYCRR Part 500, are largely the same as the proposed rules discussed in last year’s 2016 Year-End Update , but differ in the following key ways:\n\nCybersecurity programs must be based on the risk assessment performed by each Covered Entity.\n\nRisk assessments must be performed “periodically” instead of “annually.”\n\nThe company’s cybersecurity plan can be reviewed by either a senior officer or the board of directors, but does not need to be reviewed by both.\n\nCovered Entities must hold records, schedules, and data supporting the certificate of compliance for five years, and make this documentation of compliance available to NYDFS upon request. However, the record retention for audit trails designed to detect and respond to cybersecurity events is limited to three years.\n\nThere is a limited small business exemption for Covered Entities that have fewer than ten New York employees and less than $5 million in gross annual revenue or under $10 million in year-end total assets.\n\nThe Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) does not need to be an internal employee, but instead can be employed by the Covered Entity, one of its affiliates or a third-party service provider.\n\nCompanies do not need to encrypt nonpublic information in transit over external networks if doing so is “infeasible.” Instead, they may secure the information using “alternative compensating controls reviewed and approved” by the CISO. [80]\n\nThis fall, Governor Cuomo directed the NYDFS to extend the regulations to credit bureaus, expanding the reach of both the rules and the NYDFS itself, which had not previously had oversight over credit reporting agencies. Under the proposed regulation, all consumer credit reporting bureaus that operate in New York must register with the NYDFS annually, beginning on or before February 1, 2018. The compliance schedule will begin on April 4, 2018. [81]\n\n8. Trump Administration Actions\n\na. Presidential Executive Order\n\nOn May 11, 2017, President Trump issued an executive order entitled “Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure,” which lays out the administration’s priorities in three areas of focus: (1) cybersecurity of federal networks, (2) cybersecurity of critical infrastructure, and (3) cybersecurity of the nation. [82] The order directed a thoroughgoing review of existing policies regarding cybersecurity in a variety of different sectors.\n\nFor cybersecurity of federal networks , the Executive Order stated that the President would hold agency heads accountable for managing the cybersecurity risks to their agencies, and directed them to use The Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, to manage cybersecurity risk. [83] The Executive Order also directed the agency heads to submit a risk management report to Homeland Security and the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) within 90 days, outlining their existing risk mitigation strategies and each agency’s action plan to implement the Framework, and then contemplated that the Director of the OMB would submit its own determination to the President within 60 days. [84]\n\nThe Executive Order also articulated the administration’s policy to “build and maintain a modern, secure, and more resilient executive branch IT architecture,” directing the Director of the American Technology Council—created by the President on May 1, 2017—to coordinate a report on the feasibility of transitioning all agencies to “one or more consolidated network architectures” or to “shared IT services.” [85] The American Technology Council issued a detailed report to the President on federal IT modernization in the fall of 2017, and delivered the final Federal IT Modernization report on December 13, 2017. [86]\n\nFor cybersecurity of critical infrastructure , the Executive Order stated the administration’s policy to “support the cybersecurity risk management efforts of the owners and operators” of critical infrastructure. [87] First, it directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to coordinate with other senior administration officials to identify the greatest risk of attacks to infrastructure that could result in wide-scale effects on public health, economic security or national security, and to deliver a report setting forth its findings and recommendations within 180 days. [88] Second, it directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to work with the Secretary of Commerce to determine whether existing federal policy sufficiently promotes “market transparency of cybersecurity risk management practices.” [89] Third, it directed the Secretary of Homeland Security with the Secretary of Commerce to work together with “appropriate stakeholders to improve the resilience of the internet and communications ecosystem” to “threats perpetrated by automated and distributed attacks (e.g., botnets).” [90] In response to the Executive Order, on January 5, 2018, both agencies released for public comment a report on enhancing the resilience of the Internet and communications ecosystem against botnets and other automated, distributed threats. [91] Fourth, it directed the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Homeland Security to coordinate with state and local governments to prepare an assessment of the Nation’s vulnerability to prolonged power outages resulting from cyber incidents. [92] Fifth, it directed the Secretary of Defense, again in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security, to prepare an assessment of the risks facing the defense industry. [93]\n\nFor cybersecurity for the nation , the Order states the administration’s policy to ensure that the internet “remains valuable for future generations.” [94] First, the Order directs various agencies to prepare a report to the President “on the Nation’s strategic options for deterring adversaries and better protecting the American people from cyber threats.” [95] Second, the Order directs agency heads to prepare a report on the agencies’ “international cybersecurity priorities” to the Secretary of State, who would then prepare a report “documenting an engagement strategy for international cooperation in cybersecurity.” [96] Finally, the Order solicits three different reports in the area of “workforce development,” focused on the education and development of an American cybersecurity workforce, on the United States’ competitiveness with peer programs in other countries, and on the United States’ national-security-related cyber capabilities. [97]\n\nAlthough the release of the Executive Order was met with praise across party lines, critics in the months since it was released have noted gaps in its implementation. To date, it is unclear which federal agencies have complied with the review process set forth in the Executive Order, and in September 2017, a commentator observed that “the goal of a speedy review process . . . ha[d] not materialized.” [98] The administration has seen some turnover in cybersecurity-related posts. [99] In December 2017, the administration affirmed that cybersecurity remained a key priority and suggested that it would build on the Executive Order by releasing a new strategy for cybersecurity. [100]\n\nb. Release of the Vulnerabilities Equities Process (“VEP”)\n\nOn November 15, 2017, the Trump administration publicly disclosed the Vulnerabilities Equities Process (“VEP”), a set of guidelines used by government agencies and departments to determine when to inform market actors of security vulnerabilities in their software and hardware. [101] The unclassified document states that the purpose of the VEP is to “balance[] whether to disseminate vulnerability information to the vendor/supplier in the expectation that it will be patched, or to temporarily restrict the knowledge . . . for national security and law enforcement.” [102] The VEP describes an Equities Review Board for interagency deliberation, consisting of representatives from several government agencies, with the National Security Agency (“NSA”) serving as the VEP Executive Secretariat. [103] Generally, an agency that learns of a vulnerability will submit information regarding the vulnerability, together with a recommendation whether to disseminate or restrict the vulnerability, to the VEP Executive Secretariat once the vulnerability reaches a certain threshold. [104] The VEP Executive Secretariat then notifies points of contacts at relevant agencies. Interested agencies then state whether they concur with the recommendation to disseminate or restrict the vulnerability. [105] The VEP states that the purpose of distributing information is to obtain a consensus regarding dissemination or restriction, but also provides procedures for resolving contested preliminary determinations. [106] The VEP outlines the considerations that bear on determining whether to disseminate or restrict information regarding a vulnerability. [107]\n\nB. Legislative Developments\n\n1. Federal Developments\n\nLast year did not see much congressional legislation in the area of cybersecurity. The most significant piece of privacy legislation to reach President Trump’s desk was not new legislation, but a repeal of FCC broadband provider privacy rules that were set to take effect at the end of 2017. In addition to rolling back the FCC broadband rules, Congress also took steps toward addressing foreign surveillance, cybersecurity, and data breach notification, but as of the date of this review, few of those bills have yet to become law.\n\na. Repeal of Broadband Privacy Rules\n\nIn March 2017, both the House and Senate passed resolutions under the Congressional Review Act to repeal FCC broadband privacy rules that were set to take effect at the end of 2017. Entitled “Protecting the Privacy of Customers of Broadband and Other Telecommunication Services,” 81 Fed. Reg. 87274 (December 2, 2016), the rules would have imposed certain privacy regulations on internet service providers (“ISPs”), such as requiring them to provide adequate privacy notices and comply with data breach notification requirements. The most controversial of these rules was the requirement that ISPs obtain consumers’ opt-in consent before sharing consumer information (such as browsing history) with third parties, as certain commentators argued that the proposed rules placed ISPs at a disadvantage when compared to other online companies such as Google and Facebook. [108] FCC Chairman Ajit Pai stated his support for the repeal in part on the belief that the rules “were designed to benefit one group of favored companies.” [109] Chairman Pai’s announcement also indicated that the FCC will “be working with the FTC to restore its authority to police internet service providers’ privacy practices,” and to “end the uncertainty and confusion that was created in 2015 when the FCC intruded in this space.” [110] On April 3, 2017, President Trump signed the repeal into law. [111]\n\nb. Foreign Surveillance\n\nWith Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (“FISA”) [112] initially set to expire at the end of 2017, there has been significant debate over the appropriate scope of the U.S. government’s foreign surveillance powers. Section 702 allows the U.S. government to gather foreign intelligence information without a warrant, subject to certain restrictions. [113] Even before legislation on this topic was introduced, government and industry groups began advocating for their respective positions. For example, on April 18, 2017, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a report supporting a reauthorization of Section 702, including controversial aspects such as “upstream” collection whereby the “NSA obtains communications directly from the Internet backbone, with the compelled assistance of companies that maintain those networks.” [114] With the deadline for reauthorization approaching, the House Judiciary Committee introduced the FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act of 2017 to renew Section 702 for four years while making “key reforms” to the program to “strengthen privacy protections for Americans.” [115] The Senate Intelligence Committee also advanced a reauthorization bill. [116] The White House and Congress subsequently pushed the deadline for reauthorization from December 31, 2017 forward to January 19, 2018. [117] On January 11, 2018, the House of Representatives voted to extend Section 702 for six years with minimal changes, rejecting a push by a bipartisan group of lawmakers to impose privacy limits on the U.S. government’s ability to gather emails and other personal communications. [118] The Senate approved the FISA reauthorization bill on January 18, 2018, [119] and President Trump signed the bill into law on January 19, 2018. [120] FISA is now set to expire in December 2023. [121]\n\nc. Email Collection by Law Enforcement\n\nCongress continues to introduce legislation to reform the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (“ECPA”), [122] but has yet to finalize a bill for the President’s signature. ECPA addresses, among other issues, procedures for law enforcement to obtain stored electronic communications. For example, ECPA currently requires only a subpoena for the U.S. government to collect emails over 180 days old, while emails under 180 days old require a warrant. In February 2017, the House unanimously passed a bill called the Email Privacy Act [123] to reform ECPA. [124] Among other changes, the House bill would require a warrant to obtain emails over 180 days old. In July 2017, Senators Patrick Leahy and Mike Lee proposed the ECPA Modernization Act, a Senate version of ECPA reform. [125] The ECPA Modernization Act marks the third time in five years that the bipartisan team has attempted to reform the ECPA. The bill currently languishes in the Senate.\n\nd. Cybersecurity and Data Breach Notification\n\nIn 2016 the House and Senate each passed legislation related to cybersecurity without finalizing any bills to be signed into law. This past year, Congress similarly attempted to address cybersecurity measures with limited success in enacting new law. For example, on May 16, 2017, the House overwhelmingly passed the Strengthening State and Local Cyber Crime Fighting Act of 2017, which formalizes the Secret Service’s National Computer Forensic Institute as the entity responsible for coordinating investigations into cyberattacks and other computer hacking, as well as providing training to state and local agencies on dealing with cybercrimes. [126] After the Senate passed a version of the same bill, President Trump signed the bill into law on November 2, 2017. [127]\n\nFollowing the Equifax data breach, the Senate and House have been considering the Consumer Privacy Protection Act of 2017. [128] The bill requires that companies report data breaches “as expediently as possible” or face civil penalties. Congress has previously considered similar bills, however, without adopting a nationwide data breach notification standard. [129] Thus data breach notification requirements continue to vary among the 48 states that have adopted laws on the subject. [130]\n\n2. State Developments\n\nIn 2017, at least 42 states introduced over 240 bills related to cybersecurity and data privacy. [131] Key areas of legislative activity include ISP data collection and tracking, data breach notification, cybersecurity committees, computer crimes, employee monitoring notice, and cybersecurity training.\n\na. ISP Data Collection and Tracking\n\nA number of states introduced legislation requiring ISPs to obtain consumer consent before gathering and sharing online data with third parties. This flurry of legislative activity comes on the heels of Congress’s rollback of FCC regulations that were poised to expand online privacy rules and to require ISPs to notify customers before selling data to a third party. [132] While only Nevada and Minnesota have actually passed privacy laws protecting consumers’ data privacy in the wake of the now-repealed FCC regulations, nearly 30 other states have introduced similar legislation. Both Nevada’s and Minnesota’s legislation prohibit disclosure of personal identifying information to third parties. Beyond personal identifying information, Minnesota’s legislation also requires ISPs to obtain permission before disclosing subscribers’ online usage and browser history. Common features across other state bills include requiring consent before collecting customers’ personal identifying information, specifying the form of ISP data collection notice, and prohibiting discounts for customers who consent to their personal identifying information being shared with third parties. In California, a recent ballot initiative would impose even greater restrictions, by requiring medium and large-sized businesses and ISPs to compile and maintain detailed records of disclosed consumer information and requiring ISPs to maintain the same level of service for all customers—regardless of whether they opt out of information-sharing. [133] Beyond these common features, all of the proposed legislation in this area varies as to the liability extended beyond ISPs, including website operators, as well as the form of consent that must be given before gathering and sharing consumer data.\n\nb. Data Breach Notification\n\nForty-eight states—and the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands—have now passed legislation requiring both private companies and government entities to notify individuals regarding security breaches of personal identifying information. Alabama and South Dakota are the only two exceptions. Since our last update, New Mexico passed legislation on April 6, 2017, effective June 16, 2017, requiring notification upon the unauthorized acquisition of personal identifying information. [134] Delaware took legislative action to expand its definition of “personal identifying information,” to include, in addition to the usual triggers like passport numbers and state identification card numbers, health insurance policy numbers or other health insurance identifiers, medical history or diagnosis information, and DNA profiles. [135]\n\nc. Cybersecurity Committees\n\nAnother trend in 2017 was the continued establishment of state committees on cybersecurity. Four states—Georgia, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania—introduced bills to form cybersecurity committees to study and improve cybersecurity preparedness and enhance state-wide responses to security threats. Illinois introduced legislation that would form an International Cybersecurity Task Force to review reports from the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI on “Russian Malicious Cyber Activity” and develop strategies to implement or reject the recommendations espoused by those reports. [136] Puerto Rico also enacted legislation directing the Senate and House Committees on Public Safety to research computer security with an eye towards understanding how new technologies might help ensure the proper handling of confidential information. [137]\n\nd. Computer Crimes\n\nIn 2017, states continued to pass legislation to target computer crimes, with increased penalties for such offenses. For example, Connecticut passed legislation establishing the crime of computer extortion by the use of ransomware as a felony. [138] This bill was introduced after the WannaCry attack, in which a ransomware worm targeted Microsoft Windows, disrupting the normal functions of numerous organizations, including hospitals, ambulances, health clinics, shipping companies, and schools. Connecticut’s legislature framed the bill as a preventative measure to protect against and deter similar cyberattacks. Wyoming passed legislation to create the criminal offense of computer extortion, a felony punishable by a prison term of up to ten years and a fine of $10,000, and to expand the computer crimes to be investigated by Wyoming’s division of criminal investigation. [139] A number of other states also introduced legislation concerning computer crimes that remains pending. For example, New Jersey introduced a bill that clarifies the scope of the crime of unlawful access to password-protected communications—limiting it to access that is “knowingly” without authorization—and provides for imprisonment terms of up to 18 months for the most serious version of this offense. [140] New York also introduced bills to provide for the calculation of damages caused by computer tampering, requiring that cyber terrorism be classified as a Class B felony [141] and increasing penalties for crimes involving the use of personal information, fraud, tampering, theft, and use of a computer to commit crimes. [142]\n\ne. Notice of Monitoring Employee Communications and Internet Access\n\nIn 2017, a handful of states introduced legislation requiring private or government employers to notify employees before monitoring employees’ email communications or Internet access and browsing histories. Specifically, Colorado and Tennessee passed legislation providing that government entities operating electronic mail communications systems must adopt written policies on monitoring activities that specify when employee correspondence may be considered a public record. [143] Connecticut and Delaware now require private and public employers to give notice to employees before monitoring employee email communications or Internet usage behavior. [144] The ramifications of non-compliance for Connecticut employers are civil penalties of $500 for the first offense, $1,000 for the second offense, and $3,000 for each subsequent offense. [145] The ramifications of non-compliance for Delaware employers are civil penalties of $100 per violation. [146]\n\nf. Cybersecurity Training\n\nThis year, several states introduced legislation to improve state employee cybersecurity training. Illinois passed a bill that requires state employees to participate in annual training by the Department of Innovation and Technology to enhance cybersecurity preparedness. [147] New Jersey and Oregon introduced similar bills. [148] Relatedly, California introduced legislation that would direct the Regents of the University of California and other higher education institutions to evaluate their cybersecurity education and training programs to ensure that “the state is meeting the workforce needs of the cybersecurity industry.” [149]\n\nII. Civil Litigation\n\nPrivacy-related civil litigation was again prevalent in 2017, which witnessed one of the largest private data breaches in history. Numerous data breaches announced in 2017 led to civil actions, including actions on behalf of government entities. Courts grappled with issues related to standing post-Spokeo, approved settlements of numerous class action suits, and presided over shareholder derivative suits alleging that directors and officers breached their fiduciary duties in overseeing corporate cybersecurity.\n\nIn addition to breach-related litigation, plaintiffs filed multiple class action lawsuits alleging that technology companies violated state and federal laws by scanning user emails for targeted advertising and other business purposes. Last year also continued the recent trend of civil and criminal cases being brought against both businesses and individuals for recording phone calls without the requisite consent and against companies for violating the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”) and the Video Privacy Protection Act (“VPPA”). Additionally, there was an increase in regulatory guidance and regulatory and private actions related to the “Internet of Things,” i.e., smart and connected devices.\n\nA. Standing After Spokeo\n\n1. Background\n\nIn 2017, litigation over standing often predominated in data privacy actions as a result of the Supreme Court’s 2016 decision in Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins. [150] As discussed further in our 2016 Year-End Update , the Supreme Court held in Spokeo that “a bare procedural violation” of a statute without a resulting “concrete” injury does not satisfy the “injury-in-fact” requirement of Article III standing. [151] The Court emphasized that “Article III standing requires a concrete injury even in the context of a statutory violation.” [152]\n\nWe thus observed last year that, on its face, Spokeo seemed poised to favor defendants in data privacy litigation, but noted that lower courts’ subsequent interpretation and application of Spokeo had been decidedly mixed. That trend continued in 2017, as appellate courts continued to split on the question of whether the risk of future identity theft stemming from data breaches that resulted in stolen personal information is enough to confer standing without present injury. Further, while courts continued to favor plaintiffs in cases brought under the Video Privacy Protection Act (“VPPA”) and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”) in 2017, they often ruled for defendants on standing challenges in lawsuits concerning unlawful data retention.\n\n2. Post-Spokeo Standing Decisions in Privacy Cases\n\na. Data Breach\n\nLast year, the circuit courts diverged on the question of whether plaintiffs have standing to sue based on the possibility that they may become victims of identity theft following a data breach.\n\nFor example, in January 2017, the Third Circuit reversed a district court dismissal, finding that a putative class of customers sufficiently pled standing in a Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) case based on allegations that the defendant inadequately protected personal information stolen from that company. [153] The court agreed with the plaintiffs that the purported “violation of their statutory right to have their personal information secured against unauthorized disclosure constitute[d], in and of itself, an injury in fact,” and that establishing standing did not require additional “specific harm,” such as economic damages. [154] It further emphasized that the wrongful “dissemination of [the plaintiffs’] own private information” was “the very injury that FCRA is intended to prevent,” rather than a de minimis technical infraction that would be insufficient under Spokeo. [155] Likewise, the D.C. Circuit found standing in a data breach case based on allegations that the plaintiffs “face[d] a substantial risk of identity theft” resulting from their stolen personal information. [156]\n\nConversely, in an unpublished decision, the Second Circuit affirmed dismissal of a suit predicated on alleged theft of credit card information, because the plaintiff failed to plead “a particularized and concrete injury suffered from the attempted fraudulent purchases,” since she was never asked to pay for an unauthorized transaction. [157] Moreover, the court held that there was no risk of future harm because the “stolen credit card was promptly canceled after the breach and no other personally identifying information . . . [was] alleged to have been stolen.” [158] The Fourth Circuit reached a similar conclusion in a data breach case concerning personal information obtained from veterans’ medical care facilities after determining that the “threatened injury of future identity theft” was speculative rather than sufficiently imminent. [159] A number of district courts also dismissed data breach claims for lack of standing where the risk of prospective harm from a data breach was, in their view, hypothetical. [160]\n\nThe Eighth Circuit reached a split decision on the question of standing based on the possibility of identity theft following a data breach in In re SuperValu, Inc., a multi-district litigation involving several putative classes that sued retail grocery stores that had suffered two cyber-attacks. [161] The plaintiffs alleged theft of their personal information and violations of, among other things, various state data breach notification statutes. [162] The Eighth Circuit agreed with the district court that the plaintiffs had failed to adequately plead injury based on the risk of future identity theft, and it noted that its sister circuits—as discussed above and in our last review—had reached “differing conclusions on the question of standing” in similar data breach cases. [163] Observing that “this out-of-circuit precedent . . . ultimately turned on the substance of the allegations before each court,” the Eighth Circuit concluded that the plaintiffs in SuperValu had not plausibly alleged that the “defendants’ data breaches create[d] a substantial risk that [the] plaintiffs [would] suffer credit or debit card fraud.” [164] However, the court also found that one named plaintiff had sufficiently pled a present injury based on actual misuse of his credit card information, and it accordingly reversed the dismissal of that particular individual’s claims. [165]\n\nb. Unlawful Disclosure\n\nStanding decisions in unlawful disclosure cases in 2017 turned on whether dissemination of the information at issue posed a material risk of harm to a plaintiff’s statutory interests. In keeping with Spokeo, lower courts dismissed lawsuits predicated on de minimis procedural infractions.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court vacated and remanded Spokeo for further consideration of whether the plaintiff had pled a concrete injury under the FCRA, the Ninth Circuit answered in the affirmative. [166] It held that the inaccurate information disclosed in the credit report at issue implicated “material facts” about the plaintiff’s life and “could be deemed a real harm” to, inter alia, his employment prospects. [167] The Ninth Circuit similarly found standing in Syed v. M-I, LLC, an FCRA case concerning the alleged failure of an employer to inform job applicants that it would check their credit histories as part of the application process, [168] as well as in a VPPA action based on allegations that the defendant disclosed information about the plaintiff’s video-watching habits. [169] In the latter decision, the court held that, “although the FCRA outlines procedural obligations that sometimes protect individual interests, the VPPA identifies a substantive right to privacy that suffers any time a video service provider discloses otherwise private information.” [170] The Eleventh Circuit issued an identical ruling in another VPPA appeal. [171] A number of district courts also reached similar decisions in cases concerning failures to comply with the FCRA’s and the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act’s (“FDCPA”) disclosure requirements. [172]\n\nHowever, in contrast to Syed, the Seventh Circuit found in Groshek v. Time Warner Cable, Inc. that a plaintiff did not suffer “a concrete informational injury” under the FCRA based on a prospective employer’s purported failure to properly obtain an applicant’s permission before procuring a credit report. [173] The court distinguished Syed on the ground that the “Ninth Circuit had factual allegations from which it could infer harm, whereas” the plaintiff in Groshek “present[ed] no factual allegations plausibly suggesting that he was confused by the disclosure form or the form’s inclusion of a liability release . . . .” [174] Likewise, in an FCRA class action based on a credit reporting agency’s inclusion of a defunct credit card company on its reports, the Fourth Circuit found that the named plaintiff had failed to demonstrate how he had been injured by the erroneous information and therefore had “suffered no real harm, let alone the harm Congress sought to prevent in enacting the FCRA.” [175] Accordingly, the court vacated the judgment awarding damages to the class. [176] The Second Circuit similarly affirmed dismissals of two Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (“FACTA”) suits predicated on the disclosure of credit card information on restaurant and retail receipts after finding that the purported injuries did not pose a “material risk of harm” to the plaintiffs’ statutory interests. [177] District courts have followed course in other FACTA actions. [178]\n\nc. Unlawful Retention\n\nUnlawful retention cases have continued to trend in defendants’ favor on the question of standing. For instance, earlier this year in Gubala v. Time Warner Cable, Inc., the Seventh Circuit determined that there was no standing in a Cable Communications Privacy Act (“CCPA”) action based on allegations that the defendant had retained the plaintiff’s personal information after the plaintiff canceled a cable subscription. [179] The court determined that there was no cognizable injury because the plaintiff failed to allege that the defendant had “ever given away or leaked or lost any of his personal information or intend[ed] to give it away or [was] at risk of having the information stolen from it.” [180]\n\nd. Unlawful Acquisition/Use\n\nThe courts have continued to split on the question of standing in unlawful acquisition and use cases. In Santana v. Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc., for example, the Second Circuit affirmed the district court’s dismissal of a Biometric Information Privacy Act (“BIPA”) lawsuit predicated on the defendant’s alleged unlawful collection, dissemination, and retention of biometric data used to create 3D models of players’ faces in basketball video games, for lack of standing. [181] The court held that the purported BIPA violations were procedural and did not pose a “material risk of harm” to the plaintiffs’ statutory interests sufficient to establish an Article III injury. [182] Conversely, over the past year, district courts found standing for a Wiretap Act claim predicated on use of a smartphone application to track users’ physical movements, [183] as well as for VPPA, Wiretap Act, and state law claims based on the collection of video-viewing information through smart TVs. [184] Courts also found standing in the context of Driver’s Privacy Protection Act claims stemming from the sale of vehicle accident reports containing personal information to third parties for solicitation purposes. [185]\n\ne. TCPA Claims\n\nIn TCPA cases, courts have continued to find that unsolicited electronic communications constitute a concrete injury to statutory privacy rights. For example, the Ninth Circuit held that spam-like text messages about gym memberships violated “the substantive [TCPA] right to be free from certain types of phone calls and texts absent consumer consent,” [186] and the Second and Third Circuits found that plaintiffs adequately alleged harm in actions based on unwanted, prerecorded telephone calls. [187] A number of district courts have reached identical conclusions in TCPA cases; [188] however, one court refused to certify a proposed TCPA class after determining that some prospective class members had consented to receive the calls at issue and thus did not suffer a cognizable injury. [189]\n\n3. Looking Ahead\n\nSpokeo did not provide a bright-line rule squarely prohibiting plaintiffs from suing for intangible injuries. Accordingly, lower courts have continued to grapple with its application in the data privacy space. There appears to be an emerging pro-plaintiff consensus in VPPA and TCPA actions, and courts have continued to favor defendants in retention suits. However, the circuit courts have adopted divergent views on whether data breaches resulting in stolen personal information and the associated risk of future identity theft are, by themselves, enough to confer standing absent allegations of present harm. On December 6, 2017, Spokeo again petitioned for certiorari and sought review of the Ninth Circuit’s latest standing determination. [190] However, shortly before publication of this review, the Supreme Court rejected Spokeo’s petition, [191] thereby declining the opportunity to clarify its precedent.\n\nB. Data Breach Litigation\n\n1. Litigation\n\na. High-Profile Breaches in 2017\n\nLast year witnessed one of the largest data breaches in history, when it was reported that Equifax, Inc., one of the three major American credit bureaus, had its systems compromised, affecting more than 143 million Americans. But Equifax was not alone in suffering massive data breaches: for example, a white hat hacker revealed in July that a political data analytics company had left the voting information of nearly 200 million Americans exposed. Throughout the year hackers targeted government agencies and companies in every industry, seeking out personally identifiable information (“PII”), customer login information, payment information, and health care information, among others. Litigation quickly followed many of the announced breaches, including civil actions and suits on behalf of government entities.\n\ni. Credit Bureau Attacks\n\nIn the Equifax attack, hackers were able to access names, Social Security numbers, addresses, and other PII, making the breach not just one of the largest in terms of the number of individuals affected, but also in terms of the breadth and sensitivity of PII lost. The hackers gained entry by exploiting a website application vulnerability, and were not discovered until after they had accessed dozens of sensitive databases and created over 30 different entry points into Equifax’s computer systems. [192]\n\nTo date, over 240 class action lawsuits by consumers have been filed against Equifax in the U.S., including a “50-state” complaint seeking to consolidate dozens of individual suits. [193] Those suits allege a variety of common law and statutory claims, seeking monetary damages, injunctive relief, and other related relief. [194] Equifax also faces municipal suits by Chicago and San Francisco generally alleging violations of state laws and local ordinances regarding protection of personal data, consumer fraud, business practices, and breach notice requirements. [195] Additionally, the Massachusetts Attorney General has filed a suit against the credit reporting agency in relation to the data breach. [196] Financial institutions including banks and credit unions also filed suit, seeking monetary relief for data breach costs to the financial institutions, such as canceling and reissuing credit cards and absorbing the cost of any fraudulent charges. [197] Shareholders have also sued Equifax, alleging violations of securities laws and seeking damages against the company and its top officers. [198]\n\nEquifax moved to consolidate the lawsuits it faces, which continue to proliferate. [199] As a result, a Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ordered centralization of the cases on December 6, 2017. [200] Going forward, litigation will be heard in the Northern District of Georgia.\n\nEquifax was not the only bureau to have sensitive information left vulnerable. On December 20, 2017, security firm UpGuard announced that it had discovered a cache of materials on an unsecured server, this time maintained by Alteryx, a data analytics company that is partnered with the major credit bureau Experian. [201] Sensitive personal information on 123 million U.S. households was left unsecured, including datasets from Experian and the U.S. Census Bureau. [202] The exposed data included home addresses, contact information, purchasing behavior, and financial information. [203] At least two lawsuits have already been filed against Alteryx, in California and Oregon. [204]\n\nii. Political Breaches\n\nThe U.S. government continued investigating the July 2016 cyberattack on the Democratic National Committee, with related lawsuits drawing attention throughout 2017. Such suits included a complaint under the Freedom of Information Act filed by the Electronic Privacy Information Center against the FBI, seeking records relating to its investigation into the attack, [205] and lawsuits brought by Microsoft against command-and-control servers used by KGB hacking group “Fancy Bear” to covertly direct malware onto victims’ computers. [206]\n\nThen, on June 19, 2017, UpGuard announced that they had discovered that Deep Root Analytics, LLC, a data analytics company contracted by the Republican National Committee to gather voting data, had stored information on more than 198 million Americans on an unsecured storage server. [207] This information included names, birth dates, addresses, voter registration details, and social media posts. [208] While it is unclear whether any nefarious parties accessed the data, the breach did lead to a class action lawsuit against Deep Root. [209] That lawsuit was dismissed by the plaintiffs with prejudice in November. [210]\n\nAdditionally, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced in September 2017 that it appeared Russia had undertaken extensive efforts to hack state election systems in the lead-up to the presidential election. [211] Illinois had its systems breached, while 20 other states were targeted but are not believed to have been breached. [212]\n\niii. Customer Information\n\nFast Food Restaurant Chains . 2017 was a particularly notable year for data breaches at American fast food restaurants. In February, Arby’s Restaurant Group Inc. revealed a breach of customer data from malicious software accessing point-of-sale systems at its restaurants; suits sprang up almost immediately. [213] In April, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. announced that it had detected a security breach in its processing and transmission of customer and employee data, leading to lawsuits from financial institutions. [214] In September, Sonic Corp. was confronted with multiple suits following a data breach announced by a security analyst, in which millions of credit and debit card users may have had their accounts pilfered. [215] Then, in October, Pizza Hut Inc. announced that it had discovered what it deemed to be a “temporary security intrusion” that compromised the PII of nearly 60,000 customers who completed orders on its website or mobile app between October 1 and 2, 2017. [216] On November 7, 2017, a class action suit was filed against the company in Washington. [217]\n\nHotel Groups . 2017 was not any kinder to hotel groups. Lawsuits were filed in July against Sabre Hospitality Solutions, a vendor whose electronic reservation system services thousands of travel agencies and hotels, which announced that it had suffered a data breach compromising the information of customers who made reservations using the system between August 2016 and March 2017. [218] Credit card information and cardholder names were stolen. Intercontinental Hotels Group (“IHG”) is facing its own class action lawsuit, after it announced a data breach that affected 12 of its properties. Malware was found on servers which processed payments made at on-site restaurants and bars during the second half of 2016. [219] The matter is currently being briefed by IHG for dismissal.\n\nWhole Foods . Whole Foods Market Group, Inc. found itself the target of a lawsuit following its September 28, 2017 announcement that its point-of-sale systems at taprooms and full-service restaurants (but not its grocery stores) had been hacked. The suit, a class action filed by a customer, alleges negligence on the part of Whole Foods for failing to protect her information, as well as violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Ohio’s Consumer Sales Practices Act. [220]\n\niv. Health Information\n\nThe number of data breaches affecting health care providers continued to rise in 2017, with over 340 incidents reported to the Department of Health and Human Services. [221] The past year did not, however, witness any massive breaches comparable to the 2015 attack on Anthem, which resulted in the disclosure of more than 78 million patients’ PII. [222] Interestingly, of the five largest health care-related breaches in 2017, only one has resulted in litigation so far.\n\nCommonwealth Health Corporation . In March 2017, Commonwealth Health Corporation’s Kentucky-based Med Center Health announced that up to 697,800 individuals may have had their billing and health information stolen via a breach that occurred in 2014-15. [223] No hacking was involved with the breach; rather, a former employee accessed the information without authorization. This is believed to be the largest breach of a health care provider in 2017, in terms of number of records compromised. [224] While federal investigators look into the matter, at least one lawsuit has been filed against the company by affected patients. [225]\n\nv. Law Firms and Business Information\n\nCyberattacks affected two large international law firms, amongst others, in 2017. While DLA Piper suffered a ransom- or wiper-ware attack that disabled the firm’s communications systems for several days, no lawsuits have been filed by its clients as yet. [226] Litigation followed a data breach at the Cayman Islands-based law firm Appleby; however, it was Appleby going on the attack, suing the BBC and The Guardian over their reporting of offshore transactions by the firm’s clients. [227] Millions of documents, dubbed the “Paradise Papers” by the media, were leaked to journalists detailing the arrangements and offshore activities of Appleby’s clients. [228] Appleby sued the two media companies in British court in order to force the disclosure of the documents that formed the basis of their investigation. [229]\n\nb. Update on High-Profile Data Breach Cases from Prior Years\n\nWhile many prior data breach cases headed for settlement instead of being decided by the courts (as discussed in detail in the Settlements section below), some cases received significant rulings in the past year. Others continue to be litigated.\n\ni. District Court Litigation\n\nYahoo. On August 30, 2017, a district court in the Northern District of California granted in part and denied in part Yahoo’s motion to dismiss data breach litigation, opening the way for class action lawsuits to proceed against the web portal, now owned by Verizon Communications. [230] The district court ruled that some of the named plaintiffs had alleged Article III standing at the pleading stage, because they had “alleged a risk of future identity theft, in addition to loss of value of their [personal identification information].” [231] The court dismissed certain claims in the consolidated actions, but allowed the actions to continue and the plaintiffs to amend their complaints. [232]\n\nOffice of Personnel Management . The District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed a class action data breach suit stemming from the attack against the Office of Personnel Management, which compromised the personal data of current, former, and prospective U.S. government employees. [233] The court ruled that the theft of data alone was not enough to establish standing for the class and that they must allege unreimbursed out-of-pocket expenses from the alleged identity theft to state an injury in fact. [234] While the court held that two plaintiffs had alleged such expenses, it found that their claims were insufficient to establish standing because they had not sufficiently tied those injuries to the breach. [235] The court also dismissed the case on sovereign immunity and contractor immunity grounds, and found that the complaint failed to state a claim under the Privacy Act, the Little Tucker Act, and the Constitution. [236] Gibson Dunn represented OPM’s co-defendant, contractor KeyPoint Government Solutions, in this litigation.\n\nVTech . The litigation arising from a 2015 cyberattack on digital learning toy-maker VTech’s servers continued to wind its way through the Northern District of Illinois. VTech won its motion to dismiss the cases against it on July 5, 2017, as the court ruled that the plaintiffs had failed to show how the data breach could lead to future harm. [237] Specifically, the court held that plaintiffs did not explain how the stolen data would be used to perpetrate identity theft. [238] However, the court did not dismiss the claims with prejudice; accordingly, plaintiffs’ counsel brought an amended complaint against the company in August. [239] The case settled in early 2018. [240]\n\nUber. Uber won its motion to dismiss a lawsuit stemming from a 2014 data breach. The court held that the plaintiffs did not “plausibly allege an immediate, credible risk of harm” and thus lacked standing. [241] In particular, the named plaintiff did not allege that any passwords, PINs, or Social Security numbers were among the data obtained. [242] Gibson Dunn represents Uber in this dispute, which is ongoing following Plaintiffs’ filing of a Third Amended Complaint.\n\nNoodles & Co. Noodles & Co. won its motion to dismiss a proposed class action brought by financial institutions over its data breach suffered in early 2016. [243] The court found that the chain had no obligation towards the credit unions that had brought the suit. [244] The court ruled that the claims were barred under the economic loss rule. [245] Because the duties allegedly breached were contained in a network of interrelated contracts, the rule applied; because the rule only allows for recovery of damages on a breach of contract claim, the negligence claims brought by the credit unions were invalid.\n\nii. Appellate Litigation\n\nCareFirst BlueCross BlueShield . The D.C. Circuit Court revived a class action lawsuit brought by policyholders of CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield health insurance, which suffered a cyberattack in 2014 leading to the theft of 1.1 million members’ personal information, including names, birthdates, addresses, and subscriber ID numbers. [246] The circuit court found that the breach likely exposed Social Security and credit card numbers and other personal data such that fraudulent medical claims could result, resulting in harm concrete enough to establish standing under the Supreme Court’s Spokeo decision. [247] Although the district court had dismissed the complaint, finding that it was based on statutory violations and not concrete harm, the appellate court found that it was plausible to infer that the hackers had the intent and ability to use the stolen data for ill, leading to concrete harm. [248]\n\nVeterans Affairs . Conversely, the Fourth Circuit dismissed a class action suit arising from the theft of a laptop from a Veterans Affairs medical facility, which contained the unencrypted personal information of patients. [249] The circuit court agreed with the district court’s ruling, finding that the plaintiffs’ fear of harm from future identity theft was too speculative to confer standing, even if the plaintiffs took actions to mitigate that speculative future harm. [250] The court reasoned that the allegations of harm rested on an attenuated chain of possibilities, including the assumption that the laptop thief planned to misuse the personal information on the laptop, and planned to misuse the plaintiffs‘ personal information specifically. [251] This chain of logic was not sufficient to establish standing under Spokeo.\n\nc. Trends in Data Breach Cases in 2017\n\nCourts continued to grapple with specific issues in 2017, including issues that some had thought would be settled from Supreme Court precedent in past years, such as the Spokeo decision.\n\ni. Standing Post-Spokeo\n\nAs seen in the appellate litigation above, the circuit courts are split when it comes to interpreting the high court’s decision in Spokeo (and Clapper v. Amnesty International) regarding the tests for sufficient imminence and concrete harm to confer standing. The D.C. Circuit found in Attias that there was concrete harm from the CareFirst data breach, because it was plausible to infer that the hackers had the intent and ability to wrongfully use the stolen data. [252] But the Fourth Circuit found in Beck that there was no concrete harm from a stolen laptop containing patient information, because the harm rested on a logical chain requiring misuse of the plaintiff’s specific personal information. [253] The Second Circuit used similar reasoning in Whalen v. Michaels Stores, Inc., finding that a data breach leading to stolen credit card information was not sufficient to allege concrete harm, because the plaintiff had promptly canceled her card and there were no specifics alleged regarding any other particularized or concrete injury. [254]\n\nLike the D.C. Circuit, the Seventh, Third, and Sixth Circuits have found that risk of identity theft or credit card fraud was enough to grant constitutional standing to those who had been hacked. [255]\n\nThe Eight Circuit added a new split in September in reviving a class action lawsuit brought against SuperValu Inc., by reasoning that while there was not sufficient personal information lost to allow plaintiffs to rely on risk of imminent harm due to stolen identities, there was standing because someone had used a plaintiff’s credit card to make an unauthorized purchase. [256] That allegation was sufficient to meet the concrete injury test, even though SuperValu’s attorneys argued that there was no indication the purchase was a result of the breach. [257]\n\nii. Companies on the Attack\n\n2017 has seen an uptick in firms taking the offensive in wielding litigation as a tool to fight hackers. For instance, Microsoft has focused its attention on the command-and-control servers used by one of the most sophisticated hacking collectives attempting to direct malware onto victims’ computers. To do so, it sued Fancy Bear in the Eastern District of Virginia. [258] Microsoft argued that it had standing to sue because Fancy Bear had been using domain names that contained the names of Microsoft’s products to setup websites containing malware. [259] Thereafter, Microsoft won orders from the court to compel domain name registrars to alter domains to point to Microsoft, instead of to Fancy Bear’s sites. [260] Microsoft is now seeking a permanent injunction to give Microsoft ownership of the domains it has targeted. [261]\n\nIn a different vein, as noted above, Appleby has wielded litigation against journalists who reported on the Paradise Papers. [262]\n\nUltimately, these actions point to the possibility that other companies will take the fight to hackers, especially companies in the tech industry whose products are often targeted in order to foster data breaches.\n\n2. Settlement Trends\n\nAs in 2016, companies facing major data breach litigation in 2017 have continued to choose to settle claims on a class-wide basis. As discussed more fully below, Anthem Inc., one of the nation’s largest health insurance providers, agreed to settle a class action lawsuit brought by consumers stemming from a 2015 data security breach for $115 million. [263] Given the financial, regulatory, and reputational risks attendant to data breach litigation, this trend is understandable. Other trends emerged in 2017 as well. First, defendants in data breach litigation are continuing to settle with financial institution-plaintiffs in addition to consumer-plaintiffs. Additionally, in the aftermath of data breach settlements, some class members have objected to various elements of the settlements or proceedings. Lastly, as is discussed more fully below, defendants facing data breach enforcement have increasingly entered into settlement agreements with state attorneys general.\n\na. Anthem’s Settlement\n\nIn 2015, Anthem, one of the nation’s largest health insurance providers, announced that it had been the victim of a data breach in which hackers gained access to individuals’ personal information. [264] Customer-plaintiffs brought numerous class action lawsuits against Anthem and its affiliates that were ultimately consolidated in the Northern District of California. [265] After the court denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss in part, [266] the parties entered into a settlement on May 31, 2017. [267] The court preliminarily approved the settlement at the end of August. [268]\n\nThe broad strokes of the Anthem settlement are familiar. As part of the settlement, the defendants agreed to make a $115 million payment into a settlement fund. [269] The fund will be used, in part, to cover reimbursement for out-of-pocket costs and credit monitoring services for class members, [270] and to pay up to $37.95 million in attorneys’ fees. [271] In addition, the defendants agreed to implement improved data security practices for at least three years and to engage an independent consultant to ensure that these practices are followed. [272]\n\nb. Home Depot Settles with Financial Institutions\n\nFollowing a 2014 data breach, in 2016 Home Depot settled a class action lawsuit brought on behalf of over 50 million of its customers for $13 million. [273] However, the settlement did not include coexisting claims brought by a consolidated class of financial institutions claiming that they were harmed by Home Depot’s failure to prevent the data breach because they were required to issue consumers new credit cards and to reimburse any fraudulent charges stemming from the data breach. [274] In early 2017 Home Depot entered into an additional settlement with the financial intuitions and agreed to pay $25 million into a settlement fund intended for distribution among the class members. [275] In September 2017, the Northern District of Georgia approved this settlement. [276]\n\nc. Developments Regarding the Target Settlement\n\nIn 2015, Target agreed to settle a consumer class action arising out of a 2013 data breach for $10 million. [277] The ultimate disposition of the case and distribution of the settlement fund, however, have been significantly delayed due to various claims by objectors. [278] For instance, in May 2017, the District of Minnesota rejected an objector’s claim that the class representatives in the case had a conflict of interest with other class members such that the settlement was inadequate. [279] As of this writing, the objector’s appeal is pending before the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. [280]\n\nIn addition, in May 2017 Target agreed to pay $18.5 million to 47 states and the District of Columbia as part of a settlement that arose out of a multi-state investigation into the same breach. [281]\n\nd. Historical Context for Settlements of Data Breach Claims\n\nAs demonstrated in the chart below, the data breach settlements in 2017 appear to be similar to those of recent years.\n\nDefendant Approval Data Type Relief to the Class Service Awards, Fees, & Costs Home Depot\n\n(Financial Institution Class) [282] September 22, 2017 Card Data $25 million for class claims; up to $2.25 million to certain sponsored entities; security practice changes Up to $2,500 for each class representative; $710,000 in litigation costs; $15.3 million in fees An"
