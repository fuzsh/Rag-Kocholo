        "text": "Measuring actual network usage in 2016, network traffic tracker Sandvine said the average North American household had at least seven active devices in use daily, with video streaming accounting for 65 percent of usage.2 By 2019 the average number of connected media-enabled devices per North American household will climb to ten, according to IHS projections.3\n\nThe TV, of course, is now among the devices playing a big role in the growth of online video consumption, thanks to the proliferation of smart TVs and a wide range of IP streaming media players. In the U.S., 34 percent of all broadband households own a smart TV and 26 percent own streaming media players supplied by Roku, Apple TV, Amazon Fire, Google Chromecast and others, according to Parks Associates.4\n\nBy the end of 2017, streaming media player penetration of U.S. broadband households will reach 40 percent, according to NPD Group, marking a 150 percent increase since the beginning of 2014.5 Overall, counting media players, smart TVs, game consoles and Blu-ray players, 211 million devices will be in place to enable OTT viewing on TV sets in U.S. households by YE 2017, NPD predicts. These trends are replicated worldwide. U.K. analyst Ovum in a recent report predicted online video subscriptions, which topped 100 million worldwide at the end of 2015, will increase to 177 million by 2019.6 In another report, Digital TV Research projected that by 2020 online subscription revenues will reach $21.6 billion, three times the 2014 total, with penetration exceeding 33 percent in ten countries.7\n\nAs the imperatives to eliminate the unnecessary costs of duplicate distribution architecture and to bring the benefits of IP technology into the pay TV arena intensify, the search for a way to address these issues has become mission critical. In other words, it’s becoming mandatory that broadcasters and distributors define and implement a Unified Distribution architecture that eliminates duplication, enables use of cloud technology to consolidate and simplify operations with DevOps flexibility, preserves the legacy pay TV access infrastructure and extends the benefits of IP-based UX and monetization into that domain.\n\nClearly, as evidenced in the foregoing discussion, the streaming infrastructure has been proven sufficiently robust to play the role as the core architecture. But even as ever more distributors come to this realization, the drawback to widescale adjustment to this new reality is a perception that it can’t be done without incurring the extraordinary costs of replacing legacy STBs and stranding investment in the supporting access infrastructure.\n\nConsequently, three major changes in how things are currently done must be accomplished to achieve the goals of a new Unified Distribution architecture. Notably:\n\n• The current mode of distributing premium video over terrestrial fiber backbones from core broadcaster and MVPD facilities, which entails encapsulation of traditionally encoded programming in IP packets for multicasting in continuous UDP streams to secondary points of distribution, is eliminated in favor of multi-resolution transcoding and fragmenting of content at the points of origin in support of HTTPbased delivery over those backbones with farther packaging for local ABR streaming performed at the secondary distribution points;\n\n• All processing of the fragmented IP content at those secondary distribution points in support of live and on-demand multiscreen service models, including dynamic advertising, personalization of user experience, adherence to local blackout policies, support for time shifting and UX feature enhancements, is performed in software running on COTS appliances;\n\n• To accommodate delivery of the locally processed IP content to legacy set-tops and to TVs relying on OTA reception an HTTP-to-UDP gateway is employed to convert the ABR fragments to continuous MPEG-2 Transport Streams for delivery over UDP. All mechanisms essential to making this Unified Distribution architecture possible are now available in the marketplace, including the HTTP-to-UDP gateway. This innovation was introduced to the market in 2016 as part of Imagine Communications’ VDE platform, which now is in the early phases of deployment in several Tier 1 MVPDs’ CDN facilities and in the contribution platforms of leading broadcasters.\n\nIn Part 2: The New Broadcaster Perspective On Monetization & Cutting Costs and Part 3: Consolidation on HTTP Infrastructure Opens Era of Opportunity for MVPDs we will explore the ways in which the capabilities of VDE and other Imagine components of the Unified Distribution architecture can be utilized by broadcasters and distributors to address their specific needs. Here we conclude Part 1 with an overview of the benefits which this architecture brings to players on all sides in the premium video marketplace."
