        "text": "Sharing the Journey of Composing\n\nIgor AndriÄ, born in 1996 in Kragujevac, Serbia, graduated Bachelor and Master Studies under the guidance of renowned Serbian composer and professor Isidora Å½ebeljan at the Faculty of Music in Belgrade, as the top student of his generation. He is currently a PhD student at the same University, where he is also employed as an assistant in the Composition department. His compositions have been performed by various Serbian ensembles such as the Chamber Orchestra Å lezinger, Muzikon Orchestra, Ensemble Metamorphosis, Collegium Musicum Choir, and the Symphony Orchestra of Radio Television Serbia, but also Treppenhaus Orchestra from Germany, Moscow Soloists from Russia and many others. AndriÄ became a protÃ©gÃ© of the Viennese publishing house Universal Edition in 2021.\n\nIn commemoration of the eightieth anniversary of a tragic event in Kragujevac, AndriÄ composed \"Usnula Pisma\" (Asleep Letters) for bass, mixed choir, and orchestra, incorporating the last letters of the victims of the Second World War. This piece was featured at the official Festival \"OKTOH\" in Kragujevac. His composition \"Parhelion\" is featured on the album \"Tragovi\" (\"Traces\"), performed by the Serbian cellist Nemanja StankoviÄ. Additionally, his \"Svatovska pesma\" (\"Nuptial Song\") arranged for two pianos was recorded by the VooDoo Duo and is included on their album \"Otkrovenja.\" (\"Revelations.\"). Furthermore, his project \"Spiritual Journey,\" which took place in 2022, received support from the European Capital of Culture Novi Sad and premiered in September of that year.\n\nAndriÄ's talent has been recognized through numerous accolades, such as an award at the IC2019 Hong Kong Composing Competition for his piece Piano Trio No. 1 and winnng contest for his work Triple Goddess, premiered by the Ljubljana International Orchestra, suported by the EU Project \"Sounds of Change\". In 2023 AndriÄs Concerto for two Pianos and Orchestra was performed by the Turkmenistan State Orchestra at the Junger KÃ¼nstler Festival in Bayreuth. Igor AndriÄ's musical style is a fusion of Balkan tradition and European Music of 20th Century, blending Byzantine elements with modern compositional techniques. His compositions feature intricate rhythmic patterns, modal harmonies, and melodic motifs inspired by the diverse musical tapestry of the Balkan region. Through his music, AndriÄ captures the essence of cultural narratives and historical events, evoking the solemnity of ancient rituals and celebrating the vibrancy of folk dances. With an innovative approach to composition, AndriÄ enriches the contemporary music landscape, honoring the legacy of Balkan musical heritage while contributing to the ongoing evolution of European musical expression. In addition to his compositional work, Igor has also pursued studies in solo singing, further expanding his musical horizons and artistic abilities."
