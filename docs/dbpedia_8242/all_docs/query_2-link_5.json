        "text": "Everybody in Belgrade knew about Dusan Vlahovic when he was 14 years old.\n\nHis exploits for FK Altina Zemun, a youth football school based upstream along the Danube river from the city centre, had coaches across the Serbian capital talking. “He was the best player in that position, at that age, in Serbia,” recalls his former coach, Zlatko Krmpotic. “He was always hungry for goals, for work, for development. He was the father of that generation; the tallest, the strongest, the best.”\n\nAt Zemun, where he was known by the nickname Duca, Vlahovic would stand out on an indoor pitch with his sharp footwork and unerring finishing.\n\nBack then, Krmpotic was coaching with OFK, one of many football teams based in the sprawl of Belgrade, the largest city in Serbia and home to around a fifth of the country’s 6.8 million population. Dreams are processed here, in the major academies of the city’s two top clubs Partizan and Red Star, but also within the buzzing network of smaller football centres and make-do pitches.\n\nVlahovic has long seemed destined to be one of Belgrade’s most successful sons.\n\nZemun have had success with others, also producing Uros Racic, a fellow member of Serbia’s squad at this World Cup now at Braga in Portugal on loan from Spanish club Valencia, but they only coach players from the age of seven up to 14.\n\nOFK, around the time Vlahovic was making a name for himself at Zemun, had a fair track record of their own; there were three OFK players — Milan Gajic, Nemanja Antonov and Sasa Zdjelar — in the starting XI when Serbia won the 2015 Under-20s World Cup final against Brazil.\n\nAn opportunity was sensed and Vlahovic joined from Zemun in 2014. But he would stay for just six months. He would play on trial for Red Star in a youth tournament in Bosnia, before their fierce rivals Partizan — based in the Zemun, the area of Belgrade Vlahovic was from — swooped.\n\n“At 14, he was one big professional,” says club secretary Vladimir Rasic as he sits alongside Krmpotic at OFK’s clubhouse, adjacent to their increasingly run-down training pitches and looming, but dilapidated, stadium in the north east of Belgrade. “He was magnificent, and prepared for what he would achieve later in life.”\n\nThose six months now mean a great deal to OFK, who have slumped from the top tier of Serbian football down to the third.\n\nThey are in deep financial difficulty, a legacy of financial controversies and mismanagement. The club returned to fan control in late September, but need €20,000 (£17,200, $20,800) a month to stay afloat. It is the ongoing FIFA training compensation payments from Vlahovic’s brief stay that are helping to keep them going.\n\nThough his stay was brief, the striker was there long enough to make an impact.\n\n“We played one game, a derby, in that time against Partizan that finished 1-1,” recalls Krmpotic, who coached at OFK from 2014-16 and now works at another third-division club in the city, Sindelic. “He didn’t score the goal, and he was devastated! I had a problem for seven days to pick him up. He was like that. He had a big desire to succeed.”\n\nVlahovic is now Serbia’s most expensive player.\n\nHe became Partizan’s youngest professional, aged 16, and was handed the No 9 shirt immediately. But after two years he was whisked away to Fiorentina in the Italian city of Florence in the summer of 2018, before joining their Turin-based rivals Juventus for €70million in January this year. He is a forward who can score every type of goal and remains one of Europe’s most coveted marksmen.\n\nAnd yet, this product of the busy Belgrade football scene is just one of three elite strikers at the disposal of the national team today, alongside Aleksandar Mitrovic and Luka Jovic.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nThis is Aleksandar Mitrovic, the boy who liked to fight but now unites a nation\n\nThe emergence of this trio has raised hopes in Serbia. They are complementing a talented generation, one that has previously won the under-19 European Championship in 2013, and the under-20 World Cup in 2015.\n\nTogether, they are the core of Serbia’s hopes in Qatar.\n\nInternally, expectations now are that the team can finally follow in neighbours Croatia’s footsteps — runners-up at the previous World Cup in Russia four years ago and also semi-finalists in 1998 — and escape the group stage of a World Cup for the first time since becoming an independent country in 2006.\n\nExternally, the question is how a country with limited facilities and a population smaller than those of London and New York continues to produce so much talent.\n\n“In Italy, in Spain, in Great Britain, you have maximum conditions for creating players,” says Rasic, turning to face the training pitch where Vlahovic fleetingly played, now scarred from years of use. “But you know, if I can show you the artificial grass where our youth academies play football, you will wonder how it is possible to create players (at all).\n\n“It is just natural. There is no hard condition, or obstacle, which can stop us creating magnificent players.\n\n“This area — Serbia, the Balkans — is full of talents.”\n\nWhen Veljko Paunovic hung up his boots a decade ago and went into coaching, finding top-level Serbian defenders was not a problem.\n\nNemanja Vidic may have just retired from international football but the team boasted stars such as Aleksandar Kolarov, Branislav Ivanovic and Neven Subotic. The issue was at the other end of the pitch.\n\nWhere were the strikers?\n\n“When I joined the national team setup in 2012, I remember in our technical meetings, we would say, ‘We produce very good defenders but we don’t have top-level strikers’,” Paunovic, now head coach at Mexican top-flight club Guadalajara, tells The Athletic.\n\n“There’s a great quote that I use by (fifth-century BC Chinese general and philosopher) Sun Tzu. It says, ‘The defence will make you invincible, but the attack will make you win’. That was the missing part we didn’t have.”\n\nIt was not just the forward line, though, that was the focus of change. Serbia had a strong generation of talent coming through too, and began to plan for its emergence.\n\n“In 2010, we built the infrastructure for the national team (the sports centre of the Serbian Football Federation, based a short drive outside Belgrade). That’s where the national team works and trains and get together to concentrate before games and tournaments,” says Paunovic. “And then we had a fantastic generation of coaches who went through the UEFA pro system.”\n\nPaunovic initially coached the under-18s in 2012 and recalls overseeing the expansion of the search for players in his age group.\n\nOne of the players who came along at this time was Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, now a star of the national team and Lazio in Italy’s Serie A and then an academy product at Vojvodina, a club based a 90-minute drive north of Belgrade in Novi Sad, Serbia’s second-biggest city.\n\n“In Vojvodina at that time, there was a coach who had been working very well in recruitment from the north of Serbia,” recalls Paunovic. “He brought talented players from Bosnia and from Montenegro. That was Milan Kosanovic. I took him with me with the national team and he became my assistant coach for the Under-20 World Cup. He was crucial, because he knew the market. He discovered a lot of talent there. Unfortunately, he passed away last year — a big loss for our football.”\n\nThe search was not just across Serbia and locally in the other Balkan nations, but further afield. One example was Milos Veljkovic, who was born in Switzerland to Serbian parents and at the time was with Tottenham Hotspur’s academy in London. He is also in the squad in Qatar. “This,” adds Paunovic, “was the glue behind everything — ‘Let’s open up, let’s see some other kids and how they are developing in their clubs’.\n\n“Once we opened up, we put them in our system, we challenged them and made them compete to earn their spots.”\n\nPlayers would move up and down between age groups.\n\nAt 18, Sergej Milinkovic-Savic stepped up a year to be part of the team that won the 2013 Under-19 European Championship under Ljubinko Drulovic — who is now on head coach Dragan Stojkovic’s staff at the World Cup. This put him alongside Mitrovic, then of Partizan and now at Fulham in the Premier League, who was the side’s star player.\n\n“I didn’t have the luck to work with him directly,” says Paunovic. “But I remember him coming off the bench and scoring amazing goals and headers, just like he’s scoring now. I always said that’s what the generation I was coaching was missing, in the age group of ’95.”\n\nEven so, Paunovic’s under-18s were talented. He worked with them through to the under-20s, and was given the latitude to develop those players.\n\n“When I spoke to my sporting directors, Savo Milosevic — who used to play for Aston Villa — and Mitar Mrkela — renowned Serbian legend and a former Yugoslavia international — they said, ‘We do have time’,” continues Paunovic.\n\n“Time is precious. You don’t normally have time in football. So it was like a hidden generation that we were preparing under the radar. The process, the plan, and a clearer vision led us to have the results we had later, and most importantly, to produce a generation in the long term that is right now the pillars of our national team. It’s those guys, those kids.”\n\nIn 2015, Paunovic’s under-20s team won their age group’s World Cup, complemented by five members of the side that won the Under-19 Euros two years earlier. In the final, they beat a Brazil side including Gabriel Jesus, now of Arsenal and part of their Qatar 2022 squad, 2-1 after extra time.\n\nOf the side who were victorious that day in New Zealand, eight are now in the senior squad in Qatar, with the best talent having been pushed up the age levels — the likes of Fiorentina’s Jovic (Red Star) and Torino midfielder Sasa Lukic (Partizan) would join this group in the years that followed. “Later, we also brought in Vlahovic, but he was a younger player,” says Paunovic.\n\nA team was coming together.\n\n“We played against Denmark and Thomas Frank, now of Brentford, was one of their coaches,” recalls Paunovic. “We had dinner with the coaches and the staff after the game.\n\n“Frank told me, ‘You know, your players play with fire in their eyes’.\n\n“That was amazing feedback for me to get. I knew we were on the right path.”\n\nRed Star Belgrade’s academy director Dragan Mladenovic is a hard man to please.\n\nThe former midfielder, who briefly played for Scotland’s Rangers in a 16-year career, sits in his office at their Rajko Mitic Stadium, known as the Marakana.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nThe intimidating tunnel, a two-minute walk to pitch and the roaring Red Star ultras\n\nHe has just detailed how, since he took over Red Star’s academy in 2015, the club have sold players educated in their academy for €39million — far more than the €11million they made that way in the previous seven years.\n\n“For me, that is not a success,” he states assertively.\n\nWhy?\n\n“Because I know what I have here. I know that we can sell these players for around €100million.”\n\nThe production of professional footballers in Serbia is mainly funnelled through Red Star and Belgrade neighbours Partizan, with Vojvodina not far behind them.\n\nAn October report by the CIES Football Observatory ranked Red Star joint seventh in Europe, with Spanish giants Real Madrid, for the number of players (60) they have trained between the ages of 15 to 21 who now play in the 31 top divisions across the continent’s UEFA-affiliated associations. Rivals Partizan were one place higher, having produced 63.\n\nThe report’s findings reflect the large number of players emerging from Serbia, and for the individual clubs they are certainly impressive returns. Or at least seem to be.\n\nMladenovic asserts again: “I’m not satisfied with that number!”\n\n“It has to be bigger. Because we as a nation, and all the Balkan countries, have a lot of talent. We don’t have the infrastructure, like in England, for example, but we have talented kids.\n\n“In the past five years, we’ve played, every year, in the group stage of the Europa League or the Champions League. That is a very big success for the club. But for me, it’s not, because I want to play at that stage with more than 50 per cent of the players from the academy. That, for me, is a success.\n\n“I know we can do that. I know what I have in my backyard.”\n\nFor Red Star, producing quality players is a matter of survival. They rely on homegrown youngsters to compete at first-team level, but also on their eventual sales.\n\nIn Mladenovic’s words, they were almost “bankrupt” when he was appointed in 2015 but the talent production line helps keep them going. That’s the case at academy level too — it was the sales of brothers Ivan and Luka Ilic to Manchester City in 2017 that allowed them to invest in their youth training pitches.\n\nBut the academy faces challenges.\n\nMladenovic points to the widespread issues of managing parental expectations and agents wanting short-term success. With Serbia not being part of the European Union, clubs in other countries are also eager to try to take talented youngsters earlier; the longer they stay with a club abroad before the age of 21, the quicker they can be added to their ‘homegrown’ quotas.\n\nAbove all, though, Red Star’s financial position often means talent gets sold quickly.\n\nJovic, snapped up by Portugal’s Benfica in January 2016 shortly after turning 18 and having played less than 50 times for Red Star, is one example.\n\n“I was his coach for one year,” says Mladenovic. “For him, everything was too easy. He had great timing, a feeling for space. Left foot and right foot, perfect. He’s not too tall, but his heading is perfect.\n\n“I knew in my mind what I had to do in the next couple of years. I knew I had pearls in my team. I went to the chairman and I said, ‘If I stay as a coach of that team, I know you will have an offer for this generation between €10m and €20m’. They said, ‘OK, but we need the money, we have to stay alive!’. Luca was put in the first team (for the 2015-16 season) and, after six months, they sold him for €2m.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nThe Radar - The Athletic's 2022 World Cup scouting guide\n\n“But when you’re thinking about success, you have to find solutions to problems. You take a different road.”\n\nRed Star are not alone in this — Vlahovic and Mitrovic were sold quickly after breaking into the first team at Partizan. But the track record remains strong and especially so given the competition, both in their own city and nationwide.\n\nIn that same CIES report, Vojvodina, who have produced Dusan Tadic and the Milinkovic-Savic brothers — goalkeeper Vanja, two years younger than Sergej, has started both World Cup group games — are tied for 11th place with 50 players produced. Private investment at FK Cukaricki, the club in south western Belgrade where Kolarov first turned professional, has led to a huge improvement in their facilities and seen them become more than competitive with their more famous neighbours at youth level.\n\nBut for now, it’s still the old guard who dominate.\n\n“Without strong Red Star there is no strong Partizan, and the other way around,” says Nikola Jelic, whose office is just along the corridor from Mladenovic’s. He is the head coach of the Red Star academy.\n\nCompetition helps, particularly at clubs where it is all or nothing in terms of success.\n\nRed Star, who won the European Cup final (today’s Champions League) in 1991, define themselves as the team to beat. They do not lose. “We are Red Star,” says Mladenovic. “We have to win all the games. We don’t care about who we play against, no matter if we lose 5-0 or win 5-0, we want more.”\n\nThat brings pressure.\n\n“A few days ago, our under-11s team played in a tournament,” recalls Jelic. “It was Partizan in the semi-final and we beat Juventus in the final. The atmosphere was awesome. After that win, there were 10 flares lit up by fans. After tournaments usually kids come back very late at night, and on this street in front of the stadium, there are red flares. The street is lit up.\n\n“The pressure is a privilege. But we have a path. Do we want to win against Partizan? Yes, but not for the price of affecting player development.”\n\nThe night before our meeting at the Marakana, Red Star’s under-19s faced their counterparts from Dutch club AZ Alkmaar in the UEFA Youth League. The squad included three players who have already made their first-team debuts — Jovan Mijatovic, 17, Nikola Stankovic, 19, and Stefan Lekovic, 18. The latter, a central defender and the side’s captain, scored a stunning late equaliser — a touch and volley from the edge of the box — before Alkmaar won on penalties.\n\nIn goal for Red Star was Jovan Miladinovic, aged just 15.\n\n“We had four players born in 2003. There was a four-year difference between the goalkeepers,” says Mladenovic. “Because we don’t have the hard competition, we put them in a hard situation. That’s success (not the result).”\n\nPushing players up an age group (or more) is one way to challenge them. But Mladenovic also points to a large network of talent spotters across Serbia, as well as Red Star investing more in sports science and bringing in young coaches without ties to the club to maintain a philosophy. “Almost 90 per cent of the people working in our academy did not have any connection with Red Star before,” he says.\n\nThere is a desire for more, including the creation of a recognised second team. They also want to invest in their facilities, which are currently limited. Even in comparison to city neighbours Partizan, Red Star are not at the same level.\n\nAcross town at Partizan, where The Athletic was given a tour, they have a sports centre with multiple pitches and a shared training facility, with the first-team players on one side of a marble-floored building, and the youngsters on the other — as well as an already-established second team, Teleoptik.\n\nThere is a separate training ground for Teleoptik, dubbed Zemunelo — a nod to AC Milan’s famous Milanello facility. Opened in 1998, it is where the likes of Vlahovic and Mitrovic once played.\n\n“Red Star didn’t have pitches or floodlights here,” explains Jelic. “We had to finish at 4.30pm in winter. We were working on one very old field. On each quarter of the field, there would be 25 kids. It was crowded.\n\n“We don’t have a gym or fitness centre. Now the first team has it, so older generations can work there. We (the academy) have an improvised fitness centre — it looks like a place where Rocky Balboa would train.\n\n“Looking at the biggest clubs, we were so behind. Partizan has Teleoptik (the dedicated second-team facility), Cukaricki made their own training centre. We hope that very soon we will have a complete academy that we deserve.\n\n“But also, infrastructure doesn’t make players. Coaches make them.”\n\nIt is one thing to nurture talent, and another to have the raw materials. The sheer number of players entering the professional game throughout Europe from Serbia begs the question: where does all that talent come from?\n\n“They’re talented because they’re hungry,” says Mladenovic. “There is only one solution. You can be on the street, or you can try to become something in a school or in a sport.”\n\nSporting success can be found across this region. It has ranged from Novak Djokovic in tennis to Nikola Jokic in basketball’s NBA to that World Cup final appearance by Croatia, and the Ballon d’Or for star man Luka Modric, in 2018.\n\nIt seems like a part of the world worthy of the label ‘gold mine’, as Rasmus Ankersen termed it in his 2012 book on high performance, The Gold Mine Effect.\n\nAnkersen, the former Brentford director of football who is now a director at fellow Premier League side Southampton, places emphasis on the value of environment and how that can fuel the creation of talent, and a motivated mindset. That is pertinent to the Balkans.\n\nIn a piece for The Players’ Tribune, former Manchester City defender Kolarov described what it was like as a teenager in Belgrade during the Kosovo War, under NATO’s bombing campaign in 1999.\n\nAfter detailing how he and his friends raced home after hearing a military plane crash out of the sky over Belgrade, he notes of his football career, “I think, seeing what was possible in 1991 with Red Star (winning the European Cup), and seeing my country falling into despair… I just wanted more. That desire never left me.”\n\nThe wars of the 1990s, following the breakup of the former Yugoslavia, are more than 20 years ago now. But the past lingers here, and the upheaval of that period holds influence still, with an impact on the generations that followed.\n\n“Because of all the war and the social issues we had in the 1990s, my generation and many other generations were lost,” reflects Paunovic. “But everyone understood that we had to go through difficult times. So we forged the future in terms of the values. I think one of the values we had was to strive and survive. It’s that fire, that hunger.\n\n“I don’t want to mix politics with this, but the picture about Serbia in the ’90s was distorted. Since then, Serbians, in general, we felt like it was unfair to us. So we wanted to show the world our best version and show the world we are good people, and we found it through sports — especially through football.\n\n“The reality of our everyday life was transferred into how we played back then. Those parents who gave birth to the generations afterwards instilled those values, a competitive mentality, of winning, but most importantly, surviving.\n\n“In the U20 World Cup (win in 2015), we were the only team that played four extra times in a row (in every knockout round). We won all four of them, including against Brazil. So that tells you a lot about the mentality, the toughness of the team and never giving up spirit.”\n\nThose values are harnessed in sport. “Serbians love to win, it’s that kind of mentality,” says Jelic. “It doesn’t matter what sport. A lot of those young players are coming from poorer families, and that is a great chance to make some money and success. Mitrovic came from Smederevo (a working-class city an hour east of Belgrade), Jovic from Bijeljina (just over the western border with Bosnia), Vlahovic from Zemun. So they have a bigger hunger for success.\n\n“I worked with Mitrovic and Vlahovic in the national-team squad when I started out. I know Vlahovic very well. When he went to Fiorentina, he refused to go on loan. He was convinced he would get a chance. We have a former Red Star player there (now), Aleksa Terzic, born in 1999. He’s in a similar situation. He refused to go on loan and stayed there to work, and now he is getting more and more chances. That shows the character of Serbian players.\n\n“We survived bombing, sanctions; we never give up, and always fight.”\n\nIt is one thing to have that motivation, another to have the football culture in place to encourage people to enter the sport.\n\nFootball here has had more than its share of scandal and corruption stories over the past two decades. But there is no hiding the passion, built on a history of stars such as Sinisa Mihajlovic, Dragoslav Sekularac and Stojkovic, who will be coaching the national team in their World Cup group finale tomorrow against Switzerland. It is the primary topic of conversation across packed coffee shops in Belgrade.\n\n“In this garden, 10 tables will be speaking about football,” says Vuk Rasovic, who was head coach at Partizan in Mitrovic’s time there. “They will be talking about Red Star, Partizan, what will happen in the Champions League… The style of life in Serbia is football. I think we have more than 2,000 agents in Belgrade!”\n\nFutsal — a small-sided indoor version of the game — is popular, and something Mitrovic would play in his younger years. “Street football, freestyle… all that is big in Serbia,” says Paunovic. “It’s much more structured now.”\n\nEven if the pitches used are makeshift, wherever there is a space to play, people will find a way to play on it.\n\nBack at OFK, where their training pitch has holes that spell trouble players’ ankles, they make that point clear.\n\n“Every club I have worked at — and I’ve worked at five clubs — improvisation is everywhere, whether they had good conditions or bad conditions,” says Krmpotic. “There is time spent training, training well, and talent. But they have to improvise too.”\n\nUltimately, Serbia’s footballing picture has forged a national team that has raised expectations.\n\nNow it is about whether they can deliver.\n\n(Main graphic — photos: Getty Images/design: Eamonn Dalton)"
