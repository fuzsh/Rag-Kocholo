        "text": "I started the Serbian Groundhop Weekend trips with my Belgrade based friends Aleks Peković and Bogdan Mitrović back in 2016, and we had planned for the eighth edition to take place in April 2020 to include two Super Liga clubs we had yet to visit, Javor Ivanjica and Radnik Surdulica. We all know what happened around that time and our trip had to be cancelled. It had seemed like forever since Serbian Groundhop 7 had taken place in and around Kruševac in November 2019, so by April 2023, we decided it was high time to run another trip.\n\nThe Serbian league season is a strange one, the 16 Super Liga clubs play 30 rounds of games before the top eight and bottom eight split off into championship and relegation pools for a further seven rounds of games. It used to be the case that the points accrued in the regular season would be halved but this has changed now, and clubs get to keep all their points. Consequently, Red Star Belgrade had a huge lead of twenty points at the end of the first phase. The first round of play off/play out matches is always 1st v 2nd, 3rd v 4th etcetera so we had calculated that the weekend of the 22nd April would highly likely be a Belgrade derby weekend which we had hoped would be a huge attraction for British based groundhoppers. What we didn’t plan for was Partizan’s spectacularly abject end to the regular season, losing four of their last five games including a 2-1 home defeat to Radnik, who up to that point had not won an away game all season! This blew the chances of our chosen weekend being a derby game and Red Star would face second placed and Hungarian backed TSC Bačka Topola instead.\n\nThere were other factors that made scheduling our weekend testing to say the least. Red Star were facing a behind closed doors ban for their fans’ racial abuse of the team from the predominantly Muslim city of Novi Pazar in early March, the question was how many games the Serbian FA would impose as a punishment. Fortunately for us, the decision was a single game which meant their Round 30 game against Radnički Kragujevac would go ahead without fans present. Also, in Round 30 the Čukarički match against Partizan was abandoned when the ultras group, Grobari, launched a protest against the board and hurled flares and seats onto the pitch. After five stoppages in play the referee called a halt to proceedings. The Serbian FA considered various punishments, one of which was to restage the game behind closed doors. The final problem we encountered planning this trip was Orthodox Easter in Serbia meant the kick offs and days of matches for our weekend would not be published until the Tuesday before we flew out to Belgrade.\n\nNews filtered through that the abandoned Čukarički v Partizan match would be restaged behind closed doors on the Thursday before our flight. Čukarički won 1-0 which meant they finished third and Partizan a frankly embarrassing fourth. This meant the match would be repeated on Sunday for the first round of play off matches. The Serbian FA ruled the match would take place without a crowd and, indeed, Partizan’s next home game would also have no fans. This meant the 170th Eternal derby at the JNA Stadium would take place in midweek and without a crowd!\n\nWhen we did our first Serbian Groundhop weekend in 2016, a dozen or so people came over and we took in Red Star’s home game with Spartak Subotica, so a number of hoppers were still needing to “tick” the legendary Stadion Rajko Mitić, so their play off game with TSC would be top of the agenda. Once days and kick off times had been settled, we were lucky to have a double fall into laps on the Friday the majority of the 29 strong party arrived at the Nikola Tesla airport.\n\nWe checked into our regular base at the Hotel Slavija in Svetog Save, refurbished into the 21st Century at the expense of its retro seventies vibe! We soon met up with Aleks for the first time in four years although Bogdan would have to sit this trip out with ligament damage from playing basketball. We were soon on board our tour bus and heading towards the south west of Belgrade to the small city of Ub. The Prva Liga (second tier) match between Jedinstvo (Unity) Ub and RFK Novi Sad was kicking off at 4pm at the Stadion Dragan Džajić, named after the legendary Red Star player and newly elected Serbian FA President, who was born in Ub. Former Chelsea and Manchester United midfielder Nemanja Matić also comes from Ub and is co-owner of Jedinstvo with Radosav Petrović and is known for his charitable work around the city.\n\nThe well appointed stadium is set in a forested area and one end boasts a very nice hotel with a balcony overlooking the pitch. As the sun shone it seemed churlish not while away the time before kick off with a refreshing drink at the hotel’s restaurant Bajka. It was free entry to the match and the home side ran out very comfortable victors by three goals to nil in front of just under 500 spectators.\n\nWe then had a half hour drive to the town of Lazarevac for the Super Liga play out clash between Kolubara and Mladost Lučani at 7pm. Several miles from Lazarevac the stadium’s huge floodlights could be seen glowing in the rapidly fading light. Aleks had negotiated for us to be housed in the VIP section of the west stand. Admission to the game was just 500 Dinar (£3.70). Also watching from the VIP sector was former Paris St Germain defender Milan Bisevac.\n\nThe match was an interesting encounter with the visitors taking an early lead before the home side were reduced to ten men after 16 minutes when their goalkeeper forearm smashed a Lučani forward in the penalty area. The young substitute keeper then saved the resulting spot kick. He produced a great performance keeping Kolubara at bay as the visitors from the Moravica district held on for the win. Crowd was a rather sparse 419.\n\nSaturday’s first match was in the south of Belgrade in Rakovica. We arrived well before the 1pm kick off and some chose to watch the end of a youth team game from the well stocked kafana, while others walked back up the road to a railway siding, ostensibly to see Marshall Tito’s Blue train. Sadly, the train we had seen from the road, was an old German locomotive, and while it was indeed blue, it wasn’t Tito’s train which was housed in a huge engine shed that was not open on to tourists on a Saturday.\n\nThe match was an interesting one in the sixth level Meduopštinska Liga and pitted FK Miljakovac against Borac (Fighters) Progar. Miljakovac are a relatively new club, formed in 2020, but have gained widespread attention for their social media presence and their work for charitable causes. They have also been in this season’s Fenix Trophy, an invitational competition for semi-professional clubs from all over Europe. They were placed in Group C alongside Italy’s Brera Calcio and BK Skjold from Denmark. The Serbs lost both of their home games, both staged at Voždovac’s Stadion Shopping Center, and travel to Milan and Copenhagen in May for the away games.\n\nMiljakovac pride themselves on their working class background and are named after the district to the south west of Rakovica. Their CEO Jovan Simić took time to tell us about the club and kindly gave us some club t shirts as a souvenir. His team put Progar to the sword with a very comfortable 6-2 win in a very entertaining encounter.\n\nThe Red Star game wasn’t due to kick off until 6pm but six of the group who had been to the Rajko Mitić before opted for the “new tick” of FK Zemun at 4.30pm. We had a quick and predominantly meat based lunch at Restoran Gigo in Zemun. Just 200 RSD was needed to gain entry to this Srpska Liga Beograd (third tier) game. Zemun won 2-0 and the match was marked by a fourth minute goal and a second for the hosts in the final minute, with not an awful lot happening in between. Zemun were in the top division as recently as the 2018/19 season but have slipped down to the third tier, although they went into this game against Budućnost Dobanovci top of the table. A small band of ultras gathered behind one goal and their guttural chanting and modest pyrotechnics punctuated a pretty dull encounter.\n\nThe bulk of the group headed across the River Sava to the “Marakana” for the main game of the weekend against TSC. Bill posters had been spotted all over town with the ultras group, Delije, demanding a big crowd at the stadium to ensure zvezda got the single point they needed to mathematically secure a 34th league championship and a sixth title in a row. Tickets prices were again set at a very modest 500 RSD. However, the visitors had clearly not read the script and took a deserved but surprising lead. Predictably though, zvezda exerted their authority and a hat-trick from Ghanian winger Osman Bukari ensured the title was staying in the Marakana with an emphatic 4-1 win in front of 17,741 spectators.\n\nRed Star photo courtesy of Colin Dunn\n\nThe two groups met it the evening at the Tri Kralja Beer Bar (Three Kings) in Njegoševa, a short walk from our hotel to catch up on the afternoon’s games and enjoy each other’s company. Sunday morning saw the Belgrade marathon taking place and with the bus unable to pick up from the hotel as usual, we had a new rendezvous spot behind the church of St Sava, to meet Aleks and our excellent driver Miloš.\n\nWe had passed the ground of third tier Radnički (workers) Obrenovac on Friday, on the way to Ub, the facility had a large but crumbling main stadium and a more modest outer artificial pitch. In recent weeks the home side had been using the artificial pitch to allow the main stadium pitch to recover after the greater Belgrade region had been hit by heavy snow in early April. In the days before our trip the home club had thankfully confirmed this 11am match against Jedinstvo Surčin would indeed take place in the main stadium.\n\nThe princely sum 200 dinar (£1.50) got you a ticket into the game which the home side totally dominated hitting the visitors for five goals without a reply. The Stadion Kraj Kolubare had a faded grandeur to it, although in truth it had never been fully completed. The club’s stint in the top flight last just two seasons in the early 2000’s and they haven’t really threatened a return since. The club had its own restaurant at the stadium, and we had an early lunch and a couple of drinks before boarding the bus heading east towards the fortress city of Smederevo.\n\nSituated in the Podunavlje District, Smederevo is about 30 miles down the River Danube from Belgrade. Under its former name of Sartid Smederevo the club enjoyed a couple of successful seasons in the early 2000’s competing in the UEFA Cup, playing the likes of Bangor City, Ipswich Town, FK Sarajevo and Slavia Prague. The club’s zenith though was winning the 2003 Serbia and Montenegro Cup, beating Red Star 1-0 in extra time. Sartid is a metallurgical company and withdrew its sponsorship in 2004 and since then Smederevo have dropped back into the regional leagues.\n\nThis season Smederevo were sitting top of the Srpska Liga Zapad (West) and were taking on bottom side Mačva (Sword) Bogatić who only had seventeen points to their name all season. Arriving just as the game kicked off at 4pm the tour party was opened mouthed at the scale of the stadium, which looks considerably bigger than its 17,000 capacity. Opposite the main stand there is another huge stand an around sixty ultras from the clubs’ Despoti group were housed by themselves in the highest part of the stand.\n\nThe home side raced into a perhaps predictable two goal lead, but thanks to a virtuoso performance from Mačva’s Zivorad Arnautović, the visitors mounted dogged resistance. The plucky underdogs pulled level at 3-3 with Arnautović completing his hat-trick with a truly sublime finish on 77 minutes. Then something so typical of Serbian football happened close to where we were standing. Two inebriated home fans were goading each other and one of them seemed to cajole his mate into running onto the pitch to try and pull the ponytail of the somewhat annoyingly animated away team coach. Fuelled up on Zaječarsko he leapt over the fence and pushed and jostled the hirsute coach before speeding across the pitch to join up with the ultras on the far side. Mačva’s enraged coach appealed to the officials to take action against his aggressor, but only succeeded in getting himself red carded, soon to be followed by one of his players. Despite the upheaval and delay, the visitors held on for an unlikely but thoroughly deserved draw. Subsequently, for the actions of one drunken fan, Smederevo were handed a stadium ban, having to find a stadium at least 30 kilometres away to stage their next four home games and were fined 200,000 RSD (£1,500). Their subsequent four home games would have to take place at the stadium of FK Rudar Kostolac.\n\nAs we headed back into Belgrade, we could see the floodlights of Čukarički illuminating the night sky as they were taking on Partizan, once again behind closed doors. Partizan’s stadium band also extended to their next home game, which meant the 170th eternal derby with zvezda was played with no fans in the stands. Despite all the logistical considerations needed to plan a weekend like this, it was a huge success. The ten first timers on this trip, to a man, thoroughly enjoyed their first time in Serbia, which makes the planning headaches all worthwhile\n\nA version of this article first appeared in Football Weekends magazine.\n\nIn memory of the late Les Leedham for whom this was his last foreign football trip.\n\nThe sixth Serbian groundhop weekend in May 2019 kicked off on the Friday evening with an enticing looking derby in the fourth level Zonska Liga Beograd. Home side TEK Sloga from the town of Veliki Crljeni were second in the table on goal difference to FK Sremčica from the neighbouring town. OFK Mladenovac were also on the same number of points in third place. Veliki Crljeni is an industrial town fifty minutes south west of the capital.\n\nDue to heavy traffic in Belgrade, we arrived close to kick off and it was immediately obvious this was a big deal locally with a large crowd gathering. TEK stands for Thermoelectric Kolubara and Stadion TEK is adjacent to the huge power plant fired by clunking hoppers of lignite, mined in the surrounding coal basin, continuously dumping their contents into the generator. This serious piece of heavy metal provides and incredible backdrop to the small stadium which has an uncovered stand down one side of it with a sector fenced off for away fans. There are over 600 people present with around 80 in the away sector and RSD200 (£1.50) gets us into the ground for this battle for promotion to the national leagues. The home side dominate the proceedings going 2-0 up in the first half. As with a lot of games in Serbia they choose to defend their lead in the second half rather than go for more goals and nearly came a cropper when Sremčica were awarded, and scored, a very soft penalty in the final minute of normal time.\n\nThe Super Liga and Prva Liga fixtures had only been confirmed on the Tuesday before we left London but sadly all games had been fixed for 4pm on Saturday which clashed with our plans for a game in the Srpske Republic. As many of the tour party wanted to “tick” a new country with the game in Bosnia we plumped for the game at Radnik Bijeljina as they were entertaining one of Bosnia’s traditional powerhouses, FK Željezničar from Sarajevo.\n\nWith the game in Bosnia not kicking off until 5pm we had plenty of time for a morning game in Belgrade and chose the third tier Srpske Liga game between FK Grafičar and FK Brodarac. The game wasn’t being played at Grafičar’s own ground in Senjak but at the second pitch at Red Star’s Stadion Ratko Mitić. The complex behind the south stand has been significantly upgraded for Zvezda’s youth level teams and has two 3G pitches, one with a seated stand for 500 and a grass pitch with a similar stand. Grafičar have a link up with Zvezda and many young Red Star players are on loan to them so maybe that was the explanation for the change of venue. It was RSD200 admission and a Grafičar, rather than a Red Star ticket, that was issued upon entry. We were grateful for the shade provided by the new stand as the sun beat down relentlessly. Grafičar treated us to a masterclass of attacking football and dominated the game from start to finish netting five times without reply.\n\nAfter some electrical problems with the bus the previous day we were all relieved that we had a large and small mini bus turn up for our Trans Balkan express to Bosnia. We followed the E-70 west of the capital which basically follows the route of the mighty River Sava which after dropping south on the M18 its the river which forms the border between the two countries with border control and customs on either side. The crossing was fairly time consuming and we arrived at the Gradski Stadion in Bijeljina about twenty minutes before kick off. Our buses were ushered into a parking area beyond the grandstand and we were told by a club official we were guests of the president and didn’t need to pay. With the Bosnian Cup Final being contested between the top two clubs in the league FK Sarajevo and Široki Brijeg our game had a potential additional Europa League place at stake with the fifth place hosts taking on fourth place FK Željezničar. The club from Sarajevo are one of the powerhouse clubs from Bosnia and are followed by feared ultras group Manijaci (Maniacs). There were two reasons why we chose this game over an above a similar distance game at Zvijezda, the first was Zvijezda weren’t using their own ground and the second was the anticipation of Željezničar bringing a decent following with them. It was therefore a little disappointing that only a handful of away fans were evident and the reason for this quickly became apparent when social media quickly showed an astounding video of a Željezničar coach been ambushed and attacked by fans of their arch rivals FK Sarajevo. The match was also a bit of a damp squib with the away side scored early then easily defended their lead.\n\nSeveral years ago on a Belgrade derby weekend, I had done a game at the cracking ground of FK Hajduk Lionu, set in amid the urban sprawl of south east Belgrade. I took a few pictures at that game and in one of the shots was Aleks Peković and Stephen Carpenter, both unknown to me at the time. The roots of our Serbian Groundhop weekends lie in that chance meeting of strangers that morning. It was therefore a feeling of going full circle for the three of us to bring the hoppers to this most interesting of venues.\n\nIt’s essentially a two sided ground with flats and a restaurant tightly packed against both ends of the ground. On the nearside is a large scaffold and board stand and on the far side is steep open terracing. Sadly Hajduk legend Bogić “Bobi” Popović, who we had met at the original match, was in Germany for this weekend. He was a centre forward and is still the third top scorer in Serbian League history, his proud father is Hajduk president. Sadly Hajduk’s glory days have passed them by and they languish well adrift at the bottom of the fourth tier Zonska Liga Beograd. Today’s opponents, BSK 1926 Baćevac, put three past a hapless Hajduk who miss so many chances to score it beggared belief, where was Bobi when they needed him?\n\nAfter leaving Hajduk we head north-east to Kikinda for the city derby at Stadion ŽAK between ŽAK and OFK and RSD100 (75p) gets us into their stadium, which itself is a bit of a bobby dazzler as well. It boasts a more modern version of the magnificent and protected stand at OFK, and the perimeter wall is bizarrely made up of thousands of terracotta roof slates stood up side by side. It would have taken weeks and weeks to build it. It’s the railway workers (“Željeznički Athletic Klub”) that race into the lead finding the net after just 36 seconds. OFK, though roar back and win a hugely entertaining game by four goals to two in front of nearly 600 people.\n\nUsually the Monday throws up a televised Prva Liga fixture we can go to but with the play offs and play outs in full swing the fixture gods were somewhat unkind to us this time. What we did find was a relegation play off in the top division in Bulgaria between Vitisha Bistritsa and Dunav Ruse. Bistritsa is on the outskirts of Sofia so not too far from the southern Serbian border. The bulk of the route is on the excellent and cheap A1 toll highway albeit best part of a five hour journey. We also found an under 17 game taking place at 1pm in Niš to break up the long journey south.\n\nWe duly arrive at Stadion na Bubnju, home of third tier FK Car Konstantin and its a really unusual ground with plenty of character. On the dressing room side there is a tiny elevated stand and opposite a large grass bank and stepped terracing which actually sits outside the ground. Car Konstantin are name after the Roman Emperor Konstantin who was born in Niš when it was known as Naisus. Today we are watching FC Real Niš a specialist youth development club whose under 17 team compete in the highest level division for their age group, the Kadetska Liga Srbije, against all the big name clubs like Red Star, Partizan and today’s opponents FK Čukarički, who have Lazar Kežman, son of the former Chelsea forward, in their team. The game is relatively unexciting on a poor, rutted pitch but we are treated to three goals in the last ten minutes with the visitors from Belgrade coming out on top. It’s certainly a worthy stopover on the way to the day’s main game.\n\nVitosha Bistritsa’s stadium is located up a windy road from the Sofia bypass. Bistritsa itself is a modest village sited high up in foothills of Mount Vitosha, a dome shaped peak some 2,290 metres tall. The stadium is a modest two sided affair with about 20 Dunav fans behind the goal having made an equally torturous 5 hour journey from Ruse this on the northern border with Bulgaria. The first leg of the relegation play off ended goalless in Ruse but Dunav score early and then successfully defend their lead against a totally disinterested looking Vitosha side.\n\nIt’s a satisfactory end to the tour and we cross back into Serbia with no issues or delays at the borders despite seeing huge queues of lorries waiting to get through. Mainly for the benefit of our two drivers we stop at a roadside kafana for sustenance and despite it being after their closing of midnight they rustle up some cevapi, beer and coffee for a weary band of travellers.\n\nIt’s been over 3,000 miles travelled since we left Luton airport and just short of a 1,000 of those spent on the roads of Serbia, Bosnia and Bulgaria in the fantastic company of Aleks and Bogdan from Groundhopping Serbia. You couldn’t wish to meet two finer friends on the road than these two.\n\nA much extended version of this review features in Issue 49 of Football Weekends Magazine. For news of future Serbian Groundhopping Weekends please follow @GroundhopSerbia on Twitter\n\nThe fourth organised Serbian Groundhop took place across a balmy weekend in April with an ambitious but exciting looking eight game extravaganza in and around the Belgrade area.\n\nOne of the six Super Liga grounds in Belgrade that sparks a lot of interest and wonder is that of FK Voždovac but somehow they had always seemed to be away from home when we had selected a date for our weekends. Until 2011 the club played at the crumbling Bojan Majić Stadium when they received a most unusual offer. A developer offered to place a new stadium on top of their proposed six story shopping centre in the heart of the Voždovac district. Initially the plan was to have a stadium with two sides and no end stands, however, this was changed at a late stage to a four sided fully UEFA compliant stadium.\n\nFor us, as luck would have it, the proposed Arena Sport televising of the Vojvodina v Spartak game was switched at short notice to the relegation group battle between Voždovac and Napredak. This meant the assembled group had a Friday evening game a short taxi ride away from our base at Belgrade’s equivalent of Fawlty Towers, the very cheap and sometimes cheerful Hotel Slavija.\n\nOn arrival at the “Stadium Shopping Center” in Zaplanjska Street you can’t help but look up and see the roofs of the stands protruding outwards and up from a run of the mill shopping centre.\n\nIt was a pretty lifeless encounter won by the hosts with an early goal. With the lack of excitement on the pitch you tend to lose the sense of location except for the occasional glance to a corner, where netting is in place to stop the obvious threat of wayward balls, and you glimpse Belgrade suburbia from your lofty perch.\n\nYou also notice the poor construction of the stadium despite it ticking all the UEFA requirement boxes. The rake of the steps is vertiginous but the steps are very narrow with no handrails for descending. The vast majority of the seats in the main West Stand will be obscured by the media centre, VIP area or camera gantries. Tickets are purchased at a desk inside the shopping centre and there is also a small merchandise shop within a newsagents on the same level.\n\nFriday April 20th 2018 – Serbian Super Liga\n\nFK Voždovac 1 (Stuparević 7)\n\nFK Napredak 0\n\nAtt:439 Entry 200 RSD (£1.50)\n\nAfter some Friday evening free time in Belgrade, we reconvened at the Slavija ahead of a morning fixture at Brodarac to see their highly successful under 19 side. On the second Serbian Groundhop we saw Brodarac thrash their counterparts from Partizan on their way to winning the Serbian under 19 league. This meant Brodarac qualified for this season’s UEFA Youth League. They were drawn at home in the qualifying play-off against Manchester United. The match was moved to Voždovac and the home side put up a brave fight before going down 2-0. The Brodarac first team are currently in the fourth tier, Belgrade Zona Liga, so their youth and academy success is truly admirable. Brodarac translates as “winners”.\n\nTheir stadium lies under the Stari Savski Most one of the oldest bridges across the River Sava and initially is most notable for the large JAT advert on the roof of its indoor facility. JAT was Jugoslovenski Aerotransport, the old state owned airline long replaced by Air Serbia. As you look around the immediate vicinity of the stadium you become aware of the history around it. The ground is built on the site of the notorious Staro Sajmište World War II concentration camp. The under 19s are taking on their equivalents from Voždovac and again play an exciting and energetic attacking game and win far more easily than the 2-1 score suggested.\n\nSaturday April 20th 2018 – Serbian Under 19 Liga\n\nFK Brodarac U19s 2 (L.Jovanović 69, D.Jovanović 73)\n\nFK Vojvodina U19s 1 (Mrdja 90)\n\nAtt:112\n\nOur next port of call was completely diametrically opposed to the sobering location of our morning match. Ada Ciganliga is an island in the Sava that has been artificially turned in to a peninsular with a lake and beach (part of which is nudist if you’re into that sort of thing) where locals flock in their thousands to relax, sunbathe and play sport. It is also a area for artwork, light displays and nightlife. There is a toll to come onto the island payable in kiosks at the barrier on the approach road.\n\nThe island is also home to the Belgrade FA stadium which has two artificial pitches one boasting a large pitch length stand. These are used to stage numerous matches in the lower reaches of the Belgrade leagues and as the main stadium has lights as many as six or seven matches a day take place at the weekends.\n\nFK Dedinje are a 2014 reformation of a pre-WWII Belgrade club that played close to the site of Red Star’s Marakana stadium. Dedinje do not have a home ground of their own so have shared at Grafičar and Brodarac before using Ada Ciganliga. The club are nicknamed the “Millioneri” due to its historic location in one of Belgrade’s most exclusive areas. Somewhat annoyingly their pre-match huddle ends with a group shout of “Who is Belgrade’s richest club….Dedinje”. After that initial bluster they turn in a poor performance in unrelenting heat and opponents FK 011 (named after the dial code for Belgrade) canter to a 2-0 win.\n\nSaturday April 20th 2018 – Meduopštinska Liga (Grupa A)\n\nFK Dedinje 0\n\nFK 011 Beograd 2 (Andrić 62, Jovanović pen 90)\n\nAtt:58\n\nWe then travel outside the city to Obrenobac where the local regional league has 5pm kick offs on a Saturday afternoon. We arrive at FK Rojkovac only to find that their opponents, FK Ljubinić have failed to show up and have forfeited the game. Very kindly a local man offers to guide us to another ground in the next village of Rvati, just as well as its remote location down unmade paths would have been very difficult to locate. The locals are truly astonished when their unexpected foreign guests arrive a few minutes after kick off.\n\nStadion Rvati is a run down gem of a ground, similar to the village ground of FK Vrčín on the inaugural hop. The football is not of the highest standard but the hosts turn on the jet packs and coast to a memorable 8-3 victory. There is something to be said for visiting these of the beaten track, ramshackle old grounds to gain a true perception of football outside the glamour of Super Liga and the like.\n\nSaturday April 20th 2018 – Opštinska Liga Obrenovac\n\nOFK Rvati 8 (Joksić 17,51,73, Nedeljković 29, Vučićević 33,81, Jakovljević pen 65, Petrović 77)\n\nFK Sloga Ratari 3 (Kozlica 42, pen 45, Jovičić 78)\n\nAtt:60\n\nWe feasted on traditional Serbian meat platters at a roadside restaurant called Mali Raj on Kralja Aleksandra in Obrenovac. Bellies full and thirst satiated we headed back to the city for something completely different. One time Aston Villa striker Savo Milošević is now Vice President of the Serbian Football Association, heading up their anti-corruption purge, he is also a part time actor and tonight is in a theatrical performance at Akademija 28. The audience appears to be almost entirely female and pleasingly Savo appears as promised after the show. After a somewhat turbulent post playing career including alcohol problems following his father being shot dead by his grandfather, he looks fit and well and seemingly still very much a heartthrob as he was during his playing days which saw him win 102 international caps. He seems happy to talk to English football fans about his time at Villa and comes across as an extremely nice guy.\n\nSunday’s itinerary began with an early morning kick off at FK Žarkovo located on the north side of Danube in Novi Beograd The club are flying high at the top of the Belgrade region third tier Srpske Liga. The ground has a new stand and restaurant in order to cope with Prva Liga football. Joining our party for this game was Nenad Mijaljević, well known in England for producing top notch programmes for non-league clubs like South Shields, Jarrow Roofing and Seaham Red Star. A huge Red Star fanatic he tells me he has recently taken up groundhopping and now “gets” why people do it. It’s a competitive game with opponents FK IMT extremely unlucky not to get at least a point from the match. It’s the runaway league leaders that come out on top in a 2-1 in front of a decent crowd.\n\nSunday April 22nd 2018 – Srpske Liga Beograd\n\nFK Žarkovo 2 (Rajić 15, Garić pen 19)\n\nFK IMT 1 (Šarić 25)\n\nAtt:240 Entry 200 RSD (£1.50)\n\nWe have a leisurely lunch at one of our usual haunts, Konoba, under the Pančevo bridge. We have a riverside table set aside and enjoy their signature fish stew followed by yet more meat! A surprisingly swollen Danube laps gently against the terrace.\n\nAt the risk of sounding like “Savo stalkers” we bump into him again at Prva Liga club FK Bežanija, he is there with his family watching his eldest son Nikola play and score twice for the home side against FK Budućnost. It’s a blisteringly hot afternoon and an enterprising nut seller augmented the usual “kikiriki and semenke” (peanuts and seeds) with skewers of strawberries.\n\nThe stadium in Bežanija is set in an old quarry and at one end steep quarry walls afford an amazing view of the city. Behind the opposite goal is the beautiful Crkva Svetog Đorđa (Church of St George). Some people say football is a religion, well the priest from the church joined the crowd for the last twenty minutes of this game but the home side needed no divine intervention as Milošević’s brace was enough to secure the points.\n\nSunday April 22nd 2018 – Serbian Prva Liga\n\nFK Bežanija 2 (Milošević 6,29)\n\nFK Budućnost Dobanovci 0\n\nAtt:233 Entry 200 RSD (£1.50)\n\nThe Sunday evening game was a revisit for most of us as Partizan took on cross city opposition in Čukarički. The Partizan stadium always seems to have an intimidating atmosphere even when sparsely attended. The ultra group Grobari has warring factions resulting in the three factions being segregated into different parts of the stadium. Heeding the advice of co-organiser Aleks we all opt for tickets in the “posh” west stand (Zapad) for the princely sum of 450 dinar (£3.30). Partizan unsurprisingly take the points when the impressive Zoran Tošić nets his second goal of the game towards the end.\n\nSunday April 22nd 2018 – Serbian Super LigaFK Partizan 2 (Tošić 18,81)\n\nFK Čukarički 1 (Belaković 46)\n\nAtt: 2,500 Entry 450 RSD (£3.30)\n\nSome of the party have opted to return to the UK (and Germany and Denmark!) on the Monday so its a smaller bunch that head back to the island paradise of Ada Ciganliga for an under 18 match between FK 011 and Voždovac.\n\nMonday April 23rd 2018 – Serbian U18 League\n\nFK 011 Beograd U18s 0\n\nFK Voždovac U18s 2 (Nadj 21, Mijailović 37)\n\nAtt:23\n\nWe then head north out of Belgrade for the 4pm Prva match at FK Inđija. En route we stop at the Serbian FA headquarters in Stara Pazova. A centre of excellence like St.Georges Park, this UEFA funded facility has six pitches two of which have spectator accommodation.\n\nThe Gradski Stadion in Inđija is top notch with some old stands on one side and a newer big uncovered stand on the opposite a left over from the clubs’ brief Super Liga stint in 2010/11. The stadium is right next the railway with passenger and freight trains rattling past regularly. This harks back to the clubs origins as Železničar Inđija, with the prefix being attached to railroad workers. Also at this end a towering factory belches and crackles constantly. A decent crowd gathers for the match against Novi Pazar, but the visitors miss a penalty and don’t really trouble the hosts as they ease to a 2-0 win.\n\nMonday April 23rd 2018 – Serbian Prva Liga\n\nFK Inđija 2 (Kovačevic 22, Gajić 45)\n\nFK Novi Pazar 0\n\nAtt:310 Entry 100 RSD (70p)\n\nIt’s a great coda to another sublime weekend in the company of Groundhopping Serbia (Aleks Peković, Bogdan Mitrović and Teodora Rebić) and we end the day enjoying some of the Hotel Moscow’s world renowned cake, Moskva šnit. It also dawns on us that our nine matches have cost us a little over £8 in entrance money! We hope to run a fifth Groundhop early in the new season taking in the delights of Southern Serbia this time and maybe also a game in the Srpske Republic enclave in Bosnia. To join us or just keep up to date with our plans please follow me and the lads on Twitter (@PeterRMiles and @GroundhopSerbia), or Facebook at Serbian Groundhop Weekends.\n\nA much expanded version of this article will appear in a future edition of Football Weekends magazine.\n\nFollowing last years pioneering Groudhop to Belgrade a second one was arranged for the first weekend of April 2017 with no less than 45 groundhoppers attending.\n\nThe first match on the agenda was the match between Dinamo Vranje and ČSK Celarevo Pivara. Vranje is a city in the Pčinja district of Southern Serbia, just 25 miles from the border with Macedonia and 40 miles from Bulgaria. The club were formed in 1947 and have spent much of their recent history in between the second and third tiers of Serb football. However, as recently as 2013/14 they were in the fourth tier but after two straight promotions they have returned to the Prva Liga. Dinamo play at the Yumco Stadion, Yumco have their HQ next door to the stadium and produce the uniforms for the Serbian military.\n\nThe stadium is a quirky two sided affair with separate entrances for both sides meaning you had to leave the stadium and walk round the perimeter to gain access to the open terrace on the far side. What set the ground apart was its location beneath the triple peaks of the Pljačkovica, Krstilovice and Pržar mountains, as initially the sun shone it really was a most beautiful vista.\n\nPrva Liga (07/04/2017)\n\nFK Dinamo Vranje 2 (Djokić 51, Suraka 62)\n\nFK ČSK Pivara 1 (Mezei 89)\n\nAtt: c.600 (at Yumco Stadion) Free admission\n\nThe footballing offering for Saturday morning was restricted to under 19 matches in the Omladinska Liga. We opted for the game between second placed FK Partizan and league leaders FK Brodarac. They play at the Sports Centre Partizan-Teleoptik in Zemun which is also known as as “Zemunelo”. As well as being Partizan’s training ground it is the home ground of FK Teleoptik who currently lead the third tier Srpska Liga Beograd Zona.\n\nA healthy crowd of almost 400 gather to watch a scintillating performance from Brodarac who win comfortably by four goals to one. Among the crowd was former PSV, Chelsea and Atlético Madrid striker Mateja Kežman who was very friendly and seemed happy to sign autographs and pose for photos.\n\nOmlandiska Liga (08/04/2017, 10am)\n\nFK Partizan U19s 1 (Maksimović 78)\n\nFK Brodarac U19s 4 (Lukić 23,53, Bjelobrk 40, Kojić 66)\n\nAtt:397 (at SC Partizan Teleoptik)\n\nThe early evening game saw a trip to Stadion Partizan for the match against southern Serbian club Radnik Surdulica. Tension in and around the stadium, despite the modest crowd, was palpable with Red Star ultras apparently trying to steal Partizan flags. The mood wasn’t helped by Radnik taking an unexpected lead early on.\n\nThe second half thankfully was less worrying and Partizan almost inevitably came back to win 2-1 thanks to the awarding of a very soft penalty.\n\nPartizan and Red Star have been at loggerheads since both were formed in 1945 after all pre War clubs were formally dissolved. Red Star have won 27 National championships to Partizan’s 26 so you can imagine the intense rivalry between the two on derby day. The Večiti derbi, the Eternal Derby,really is one of Europe’s greatest footballing experiences.\n\nSuper Liga (08/04/2017, 5pm)\n\nFK Partizan 2 (Janković 53, Durdević pen 78)\n\nFK Radnik Surdulica 1 (Arsenijević 18)\n\nAtt:1,500\n\nOn Sunday we could have stayed in Belgrade for the easy option of Grafičar but instead we decided on the derby of Mladenovac! Upon entering the ground of FK Selo Mladenovac you see an old railway carriage which is used as a refreshments bar! On the far side is a pitch length uncovered terrace whose concrete steps have been almost subsumed by weeds and wild flowers. Behind the terrace is the eye catching feature of a disuse mill tower. Behind the dressing rooms is the disused factory of Petar Drapšin which manufactured tanks for the old Eastern bloc countries.\n\nAgain the club are most welcoming and insist we don’t pay to get in. The hosts need to defeat OFK Mladenovac to remain in the division and a spirited comeback in the second sees them grab the points with a 4-2 triumph.\n\n1.Beogradska Liga Grupa C (09/04/2017, 10am)\n\nFK Selo Mladenovac 4 (Mitrović 46, Tolić pen 64,74, Vujić 79)\n\nOFK Mladenovac 2 (Arsić 43, Stefanović 84)\n\nAtt:79\n\nWe headed back to Belgrade for the highly anticipated match between FK Rad and Red Star. We had reserved tickets in the “neutral” sector were charged 700 Serb dinar (£5) instead of the normal 400 dinar. To our surprise the ground was not even half full and our tickets had 400 RSD written on them. The club had charged us 300 dinar per ticket for “reservation” for a game that we could have just walked up to and paid to get in. The poor experience with Rad was compounded by the searches conducted at the gates which saw all manner of items confiscated, the strangest being a packet of mints!\n\nOn the pitch zvezda eased to a 4-0 win helped by the referee failing to give Rad a clear penalty with the score at 0-1. The Rad ultras were housed in a section of uncovered terracing behind the goal and had just returned after their racist chanting had seen the club forced to play the previous three home games behind closed doors. Save for the odd bout of vigorous flag waving and a blue smoke bomb the ultras of Rad appeared to be on their best behaviour.\n\nSuper Liga (09/11/2017, 5pm)\n\nFK Rad 0\n\nFK Crvena Zvezda 4 (Plavšić 34,70, Ristić 65, Petković 73)\n\nAtt:2,000 (at Stadion Kralj Petar I)\n\nWith a few of the hoppers staying till Tuesday a bonus opportunity of the Prva Liga match between FK Proleter and FK Indija appeared from the fixture gods. We headed north to the stunning city of Novi Sad in good time for the 15.30pm start.\n\nArriving unannounced just before kick off at the Stadion Slana Bara (“salty pond”) the FK Proleter president insisted we would be his guests and again free entry was given as well as very welcome cold bottle of Coke or Fanta on a blisteringly hot afternoon.\n\nBoth Proleter and Indija have struggled for goals this season and prior to today’s match had both managed to score only 18 goals in twenty matches. A competitive and occasionally feisty encounter saw the hosts win 3-1 in front of 500 people with their third being an absolute peach of a free kick.\n\nPrva Liga (10/04/2017)\n\nFK Proleter Novi Sad 3 (Novaković 26,85, Mirosavljev 56)\n\nFK Indija 1 (Marković 23)\n\nAtt:500 (at Stadion Slana Bara)\n\nWith grateful thanks to our Serbian friends Aleks Peković, Bodgan Mitrović and Teodora Rebić, Stephen Carpenter and I hope to arrange a third Serbian Groundhop in during the 2017/18 season.\n\nAn extended review of Belgrade Groundhop 2017 will appear in the June 2017 edition of “Football Weekends” magazine. To order your copy please visit http://www.footballweekends.co.uk\n\nThe first organised groundhop in Serbia got underway with an unexpected bonus match with the fixture gods having a Friday match as Radnički Niš against Novi Pazar was being broadcast by one of Serbia’s pay per view channels. An extra day of mini bus use was hastily arranged and the group headed south on the two and a half hour drive to Niš.\n\nNiš is the third largest city in Serbia after Novi Sad and the capital Belgrade and the club was formed in 1923. Radnički translates as “Workers”. The club were always a consistent member of the top division of the old Yugoslavian League and in 1981/2 they reached the semi final of the UEFA Cup having eliminated Napoli, Grasshoppers, Feyenoord and Dundee United. They were drawn against Hamburg SV and Radnički won the first leg 2-1 in Niš. The second leg at the Volksparkstadion saw the Serbs collapse to a 5-1 defeat. Legend has it that the club accepted a bribe of a set of floodlights from the Hamburg chairman to throw the second leg.\n\nA shock relegation in 1985 bought an end to a golden era for the club. Serbia’s independence following the Balkan War saw the club in the top division of the new league but by 2008 they dropped into the third tier regional Srpska Liga East. Happily by 2011/12 they were back in the top flight and this coincided with a return to the home stadium Čair, their home since 1963, which had undergone an €11 million revamp.\n\nTonight’s match against Novi Pazar sees the hosts in fifth place in the Jelen Super Liga while their guests occupied twelfth spot. What followed were two teams completely cancelling each other out and the 0-0 result was somewhat inevitable. Some local fans who were surprised by the English presence in their stadium told us they suspected the result had been agreed in advance between the two clubs and they feared this was common place among the smaller clubs in Serbia.\n\nFriday 18th March 2016 – Jelen Super Liga\n\nFC Radnički Niš 0\n\nNovi Pazar 0\n\nAtt: 2,000 (at Gradski Stadion Čair)\n\nThe evening was concluded with a quick stroll around Niš Fortress before getting sustenance in the lively bohemian quarter of the city. As JJ Burnel once (nearly) sung it really was “So nice in Niš”. The party then headed back to our headquarters in Belgrade’s Slavija Square.\n\nSaturday’s busy schedule started early with a 10 am kick of at third division BASK (Beogradski Akademski Sportski Klub). The club were formed in April 1903 SK Soko as a football wing of a long established gymnastics club. That formation date means BASK are the oldest club in the kingdom of Serbia.\n\nInitially the club used a tight field on Jugovićeva Street but this was too confined so they moved to a new field known as Bara Venecija but after a few years of use this was completely destroyed when the mighty River Sava burst its’ banks. SK Soko then moved to a new ground in Topčider but after 27 years this was lost to railway expansion. Having changed their name to BASK in 1933 the club moved to yet another new venue behind an electrical plant in Novi Beograd. Ironically after World War II this venue became home to today’s opponents, Radnički Novi Beograd.\n\nIn the early post War years BASK merged with Senjak and gained use of the current stadium in Topčider Park close to the former home of SK Soko. The club has enjoyed great success at the Stadion Careva Ćuprija and as recently as 2009/10 and 2010/11 they achieved a double promotion from third tier to the Super Liga. However the BASK board decided the top flight would be too much of a financial risk for the club and they sold their place in the Super Liga to FK Novi Pazar.\n\nThe black and whites are now back in the third tier and their stadium now boasts a 3G surface and a large pitch length stand down one side and a more modest cover behind one goal. The adjacent hotel houses player from Super Liga club Spartak Subotica, in town for the match against Red Star, and a few of them drift in to watch the game. The hosts grab an early lead with a deft left footed drive from Dejan Pajović. The visitors from Novi Beograd, in second place in the table, spend most of the game trying to score but just as they appeared to have given up they snatch the points with two very late goals.\n\nSaturday March 19th 2016 – Srpska Liga Beograd\n\nBASK 1 (Pajović 11)\n\nRadnički Novi Beograd 2 (Stajić 89, Dalifi 90)\n\nAtt: 161 (at Stadion Careva Ćuprija)\n\nWe then head over to the suburb of Karaburma and next up is the 2pm kick off at the once mighty Stadion Omladinski, home of OFK Beograd. Omladinski Fudbalski Klub Beograd were formed as Beogradski Sport Klub in 1911 and won five national championships before World War II. The club became Metalac in 1945 before reverting five years later to BSK. In 1957 the club became OFK with Omladinski translating as “Youth”. The club won the Yugoslav Cup four times in the 1950’s and 60’s and were rarely out of the top six in the league. They were regulars in European competition until the mid 1970’s and hold victories over the likes of Napoli, Juventus, Feyenoord and Panathinaikos. In 1962/3 they reached the semi-final of the Cup Winners Cup but fell to Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nThen almost without warning the Romantičari fell from grace and spent two decades flitting between the first and second levels. Only in the 2000’s did European competition return to the Omladinski. The club has always struggled for support living in the shadow of Red Star and Partizan, but in 2016 it finds itself in dire straits. The stadium looks much older than it’s’ 58 years and its poor state of repair and lack of investment is evident for all to see. The club has been toward the bottom of the table all season and with relegation a real possibility what support they had has all but deserted the club amid stories of current players deliberately losing matches.\n\nOnly 300 people gather for this match with Vojvodina from Novi Sad and only one side of the stadium is open. A bulldozer sits on top of a terrace and is working on footing for floodlights, a luxury the stadium has never sported previously. Hopefully this will mark some much needed refurbishment at stadium that can hold some 20,000 people.\n\nIf OFK players are deliberately losing matches this season then they disguise it well today as they work extremely hard against a compact and tidy visiting team. A sustained spell of OFK pressure in the second half produces a towering header from Vuk Martinović to secure three much needed points for the hosts.\n\nSaturday March 19th 2016 -Jelen Super Liga\n\nOFK Belgrade 1 (Martinović 71)\n\nFK Vojvodina 0\n\nAtt: 300 (at Stadion Omladinski)\n\nA pleasant interlude was then spent at a restaurant on the Danube where fish soup and cevapcici was eaten before the main event at the Marakana, home of the famous Red Star Belgrade. It was also great to catch up with legendary Zvezda fan Nenad Mijaljević who many of you will know as the editor of match programmes for Seaham Red Star, Jarrow Roofing and South Shields.\n\nI had been to the Marakana (or Stadion Crvena Zvezda or Stadion Rajko Mitić, take your pick) before for the legendary Eternal Derby against Partizan so I was more than interested to see what support, particularly that from the ultras “Delije”, for an ordinary league game when the hosts have a 30 point lead at the top of the table. The crowd might have been a quarter of the gathering for a derby match but the noise and support from the north stand was loud and relentless and carried on long after Zvezda cruised to a 4-0 win against Spartak Subotica. Of course there was pyro galore illuminating the night sky at regular intervals.\n\nRed Star, and indeed Partizan, were formed in 1945 when several existing clubs were dissolved by Marshal Tito as they had played matches during the war without permission. One such club was SK Jugoslavija who had played on the site of the current stadium since 1927. The new club, Crvena Zvezda, were given the stadium of the old Jugoslavija while the club formed by the Yugoslav People’s Army (the JNA) were appeased with a piece of land not half a mile away which would in 1951 be ready for use and is still the stadium FK Partizan use today.\n\nThe old Jugoslavija Stadium held 20,000 and after Red Star’s ill fated match against Manchester United in 1958 had to be moved to Partizan’s ground to cope with demand, it became clear to the board the popularity of the “people’s club” meant a much bigger stadium was needed. The old Jugoslavija Stadium was razed to the ground and Zvezda decamped to Partizan’s ground for a few seasons.\n\nBy the time the stadium was ready for inauguration in September 1963, people eagerly clambered the vomitories to see the vast new bowl which could hold 110,000 people on its terraces. The locals at once declared “It looks like the Maracana” after Rio’s famous amphitheatre and so the nickname was created. It’s all time record attendance was set in 1975 when 117,000 people watched a match against the Hungarian club Ferencvaros. Nowadays its all seater, though seats are removed from the away end for derby matches, and has a more manageable capacity of 55,000. To date Zvezda have won 26 championships and, of course, were crowned European champions when that magical side which included Dejan Savećević, Darko Pancev, Robert Prosinecki, and Vladimir Jugović defeated Marseille on penalties.\n\nIt is great to see this famous club back on top of the table and in the Marakana they still have one of Europe’s most iconic stadiums. In the Delije they have some of the best ultras in the world.\n\nSaturday March 19th 2016 – Jelen Super Liga\n\nCrvena Zvezda 4 (Ibanez pen 45, pen 65, Ristić 47, Oliveira 59)\n\nSpartak Subotica 0\n\nAtt: 12,173 (at Stadion Crvena Zvezda “Marakana”)\n\nThe evening is wound down with a night in a typical Serbian kafana, Restoran Klopka on Stanislava Sremčevića, where quite frankly preposterous amounts of meat were consumed.\n\nWith many of the party still a little listless from the previous nights gastronomic excesses most a grateful for a slightly later 11 am kick off for a third tier game at FK Dorćol. Their ground is down on the banks of the Danube and the first surprise is that they now only use their own pitch, replete with an ornate stand, for training and now share the pitch of their immediately adjacent neighbours GPS Polet.\n\nThe ground is fairly unremarkable except that it is back dropped by the vast Kalemegden fortress which is bathed in beautiful hazy morning sun.\n\nFK Dorćol were formed in 1952 and as recently as 2002 had a one season spell in the second tier.\n\nToday’s match sees them take on FK Brodarac 1947 and the unseasonably warm weather sees both sides having to work hard to create chances on what is a pretty poor and heavily rutted pitch. It’s no surprise that the game is decided by a penalty in the visitors’ favour which is converted by their goalkeeper, Milos Lazarević.\n\nIn a special treat for us we are hen introduced to Ljupko Petrović, legendary coach of Red Star’s 1991 European Cup winning side. The veteran coach was more than happy to pose for photos.\n\nSunday March 20th 2016 – Srpska Liga Beograd\n\nFK Dorcól 0\n\nFK Brodarac 1 (Lazarević pen 59)\n\nAtt: 179 (at Stadion Polet)\n\nA brief spell is spent wandering around Kalemegden fortress and the Pobednik statue which regally overlooks the beguiling confluence of the two great Serbian rivers of the Sava and the Daunav (Danube). It is ridiculously warm and shirt sleeves and ice cream are the order of the hour.\n\nNext we travel half an hour south of Belgrade to a small Vrčín, this is co-organiser Aleks’ secret ground. We are warmly welcomed by the club president into what can only be described as a delightfully ramshackle ground. The clubhouse has a viewing gallery where a bunch of real characters sit to cheer on the team/harangue the referee (delete as applicable), some of our party who will remain nameless join them an get rather pickle on some indeterminate local poteen.\n\nOn the far side of the pitch is the concrete carcass of a large stand started in 1993 when Vrčín were in the third tier of the old Yugoslav third tier. The municipality then pulled the funding for it and now it has a couple of hundred plastic seats acquired from FK Partizan bolted to it.\n\nVrčín have had an awful season with just eight points gained from 15 matches and they sit bottom of the table with the visitors, PKB Padinska Skela, in tenth. A healthy crowd gathers to cheer on the team (or look at the strange group of British interlopers) in what is a must win game for the club.\n\nLuckily for us we catch Vrčín on a good day and the hard working giant of a centre forward, Vanja Savić nets a well deserved brace of goals to lift this super friendly club off the bottom of the table.\n\nSunday March 20th 2016 – Beogradska Zone\n\nFK Vrčín 2 (Savić 53, 73)\n\nPKB Padinska Skela 0\n\nAtt: 154 (at Stadion Želežnički)\n\nThe tours final match is another Super Liga encounter between “the Hillmen” of FK Čukarički and FK Partizan. The hosts were formed in 1926 and spent many years in the amateur ranks. By 1971 they had reached the Yugoslav Second Division and twelve years later they climbed into the top division for the first time.\n\nSince 2012 Čukarički have been owned by Dragan Obradović, a construction magnate, and heavy investment saw the club finish third last season and gain a Europa League place. They beat Slovenian side NK Domžale in the first qualifying round but then succumbed to the Azerbaijani side SC Gabala.\n\nStadion Čukarički was opened in 1969 and is also known as the Stadion na Banovom Brdu. It has undergone massive improve in recent seasons but is still a relatively small two sided venue.\n\nThe hosts take a shock lead after 47 seconds when Bandalovski turns a cross into his own net and Partizan’s poor season looks set to continue. However, urged on by their flare wielding, tribal drumming ultras, the Grobari, Partizan turn it around with the winning goal being scored by the ex Manchester City and Bulgaria striker Valeri Bojinov, who looks to be carrying a fair amount of weight these days.\n\nSaturday March 20th 2016 -Jelen Super Liga\n\nFK Čukarički 1 (Bandalovski og 1)\n\nFK Partizan 2 (M.Stevanović 49, Bojinov 67)\n\nAtt: 1,500 (at Stadion Čukarički)\n\nThe evening is spent in the bohemian quarter of Belgrade called Skadarlija in the upmarket restaurant Tri Sesira where the food is once again top notch.\n\nTastes of Belgrade\n\nSights of Belgrade\n\nSo there it was the first ever Serbian groundhop superbly hosted by our good friends Aleks Peković and Bogdan Mitrović. After such an excellent time few would bet against a second groundhop occurring in 2017!\n\nHaving attended the Belgrade derby at Red Star’s stadium last season I was keen to see the reverse fixture at the Stadion Partizan, known as the JNA Stadium until 1989. Partizan then bought the arena from the army, their long term benefactor. The background to the 146th “Eternal Derby” was an interesting one. In the table Red Star had taken a six point lead with five rounds left when Partizan unexpectedly lost to Napredak in the midweek round of games. A defeat in the derby would leave them nine points adrift with just 12 points left available, Zvezda would surely be crowned champions of Serbia.\n\nPartizan have won the Serbian League for the past six seasons, last season’s title was won at a canter, by a margin of eleven points from their cross city rivals. However, they have not had everything their own way this season with the January arrest of club president Dragan Đurić who now faces indictment for corruption. Unrest has been rife with Partizan arguing that penalties are being awarded against them for no reason. Red Star claim that for once the playing field is level. The red and whites though have their own issues, mounting debts may prevent them from playing in Europe next season unless money can be raised.\n\nThe stadium is busy when we arrive and try and locate our entrance vomitory, we pass a mass of Zvezda fans who appear to be prevented from entering the ground. It transpires police and officials had been trying to remove a flammable paint that the Grobari had painted on the fences at the Red Star end in an attempt to make the visitors inadvertently set fire to their own flags. The ruse failed but tempers flared as the delays continued and there was a brief scuffle between the Delije and the riot police.\n\nOnce inside it was someone strange that security allowed rival fans to swap sections unchallenged although there was no real aggression just mounting tension and excitement. The game kicked off in daylight and it was interesting to hear that the Grobari, for today’s encounter, had seen the warring factions of Alcatraz and the Zabrenjeni agreeing to lay their differences aside for 90 minutes in pursuit of the greater good of their club. Their noise and synchronised bouncing was truly deafening. Red Star, more renowned for their visual tifos, produced thousands of red and white balloons surrounding a huge, and I mean huge, flag of a tank with a Zvezda flag atop of it. The tank picture was an abiding memory of the Balkan War as the JNA (the Yugoslav People’s Army) rumbled into the devastated Croatian town of Vukovar in the early days of that most shocking of recent human tragedies. The Delije’s message to their rivals was simple, it implied that the Grobari were “Ustaše” (the Croatian Nazi Movement). Politics aside it was a top notch display. It was also the first time I have ever seen a drone flying across a stadium to monitor the crowd.\n\nThe first half was truly dramatic, 23 minutes in Zvezda were awarded a penalty but Ninković’s tame shot was easily saved by Lukač in the Partizan goal. Barely had the excitement died down when the home side took the lead with a sensational free kick from Nikola Drinčić. The Grobari went into overdrive, some of their number scaling the huge electronic scoreboard equipped with giant flags, arranging themselves in some sort of semaphore insult to the visitors. Incredibly Zvezda were then awarded a second penalty, and opting to change their kicker, Nikola Mijailović was entrusted with levelling the game. To their utter astonishment Lukač saved again to preserve the slender lead.\n\nDarkness enveloped the stadium at halftime and to rally their team Zvezda launched into a dramatic pyrotechnic display, flares, flames and red and white smoke engulfed the away end and the neighbouring Church of Saint Sava. It was a mightily impressive display. It seemed to galvanise the visitors and ten minutes into the second half they pulled level. Dragan Mrđa, often the playmaker in the open period, finished coolly after jinking through a sleeping Partizan defence. This was a cue for further flares, one of which struck their own player, Darko Brašanac, singeing a hole in the back of his shirt.\n\nThe remainder of the second half was a tense affair, Zvezda seemingly happy with a point that would take them seven points clear, and Partizan looking defeated and short of ideas. Step forward substitute Nemanja Kojić. As the clock struck the 90th minute Mrđa had clumsily lost possession and Vulićević put in a decent cross more in hope than expectation. Kojić superbly controlled the ball to slot home into the corner of the Red Star net. A pitch invasion ensued and the stadium erupted with a mixture of relief and joy for the black and white of Partizan.\n\nSo there it was, another thrilling encounter illuminated by two of the best sets of ultras in world football. Serbia is a great country with a population working hard to fix its image problem. This is classic footballing encounter, you must try and go at least once in your lifetime.\n\nSaturday April 26th 2014 – Jelen Super Liga\n\nFK Partizan (1) 2 (Drinčić 27, Kojić 90)\n\nFK Crvena Zvezda (0) 1 (Mrđa 56)\n\nAtt: 30,000 (at Stadion Partizan)\n\nPartizan:\n\n25.
