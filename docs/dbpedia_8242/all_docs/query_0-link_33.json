        "text": "Class of 2016/17.\n\nGraduated from Bocconi University, Bachelor in Economics, Management and Computer Science.\n\nBased on my work during my undergraduate studies, the Lombardy region decided to fund my education at Bocconi University through a full scholarship. Since my major undergraduate studies focused on computer science, I decided to continue in that direction and enrolled in Master of Science in Big Data and Business Analytics at the University of Politecnico di Milano. In addition to many options for Master’s studies, I decided to stay in Milan and I am proud to have enrolled in studies in collaboration with IBM, a leading Tech company. Also, I am glad that after finishing the IBDP in the school “Ruđer Bošković”, as a world-class educational system, I continued on the path of great education and I am part of two faculties that are ranked among the top 10 in the world in their fields of work. It is very important to emphasize that the experience at IB helped me to adopt the way of working at these faculties more easily, and provided me with strong prior knowledge as a foundation for achieving great results. During my studies, I completed several internships in Italy, in the domains of Market Research, Data Analytics and Finance. I continued on the path I started in Ruđer, and was a part of many international competitions and conferences.\n\nClass of 2011/2012\n\nUpon completing the IB programme at Ruđer, I continued my education in England where I studied English language and literature at the University of Nottingham. After three years and completing my undergraduate studies, I returned to Belgrade and enrolled in a Master’s degree in applied linguistics at a distance, again at the University of Nottingham. Then I moved to the Czech Republic where I first worked as an English teacher, but after a while, I realized that I wanted to use my love of writing and become a technical writer. That opportunity came up two years ago when I found employment in the IT sector. A year ago, I became a team leader of technical writers in the company, and I am currently primarily engaged in management.\n\nThe valedictorian of 2008\n\nNemanja Maras was born in 1989 in Belgrade, where he graduated from the Faculty of Applied Arts, department for Applied Graphics, photography studio. He has been involved in fashion photography since the end of 2006. Two years later, he has begun his experimental-conceptual work. So far, he has collaborated with many fashion designers, musicians, actors, publishing and fashion houses, as well as with humanitarian and non-governmental organizations. Since 2014, he has been a regular member of ULUPUDS. He had eight solo exhibitions, participated in two world biennials of student photography and in several group exhibitions. He is a professor at the Institute for Artistic Play and an applied artist.\n\nClass of 2011/2012\n\nShe attended the philological department at the Ruđer Bošković School, and then in 2012 she enrolled at the Faculty of Political Sciences, University of Belgrade, majoring in International relations.\n\nShe continued her studies in Milan, Studies for the Middle East (Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore).She had an internship in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in the department for Africa and the Middle East. In the meantime, in addition to Italian, she also perfected the Arabic language. She is currently completing another master’s degree at the Faculty of Political Sciences, Gender studies.She is employed in a family company as a CEO.\n\nClass of 2015/2016\n\nShe is a graduate of film and TV directing at the Academy of Arts in Belgrade.\n\nAt the festival in Moscow, the film “You know what I dream when I have nightmares” had its premiere and was in the main selection of the 39th VGIK International Student Film Festival, and the short documentary “Landslide” was chosen as one of the three best documentaries at the NEW WAVE International Film Festival in Sofia."
