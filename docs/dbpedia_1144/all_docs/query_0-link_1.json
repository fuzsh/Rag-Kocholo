The encoded protein is thought to be a part of the semaphorin signal transduction pathway implicated in semaphorin-induced growth cone collapse during neural development. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.[1]\n\nCRMP1 mediates reelin signaling in cortical neuronal migration.[2] Mice deficient in CRMP1 exhibit impaired long-term potentiation and impaired spatial learning and memory.[3]\n\nCRMP1 gene overlaps with another gene called EVC.[4]\n\nInteractions\n\nCRMP1 has been shown to interact with DPYSL2.[5]\n\nReferences\n\nHuman CRMP1 genome location and CRMP1 gene details page in the UCSC Genome Browser."
