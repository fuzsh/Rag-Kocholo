        "text": "Collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2) plays a crucial role in axonal guidance and neurite outgrowth during neural development and regeneration. We have studied the interaction between calmodulin (CaM) and CRMP-2 and how Ca2+/CaM binding modulates the biological functions of CRMP-2. We have shown that CRMP-2 binds to CaM directly in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The CaM binding site of CRMP-2 is proposed to reside in the last helix of the folded domain, and in line with this, a synthesized peptide representing this helix bound to CaM. In addition, CaM binding inhibits a homotetrameric assembly of CRMP-2 and attenuates calpainmediated CRMP-2 proteolysis. Furthermore, a CaM antagonist reduces the number and length of process induced by CRMP-2 overexpression in HEK293 cells. Take together, our data suggest that CRMP-2 is a novel CaM-binding protein and that CaM binding may play an important role in regulating CRMP-2 functions.\n\nCytoskeleton dynamics are critical phenomena that underpin many fundamental cellular processes. Collapsin response mediator proteins (CRMPs) are highly expressed in the developing nervous system, mediating growth cone guidance, neuronal polarity, and axonal elongation. However, whether and how CRMPs associate with microtubules and actin coordinated cytoskeletal dynamics remain unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that CRMP2 and CRMP4 interacted with tubulin and actinin vitroand colocalized with the cytoskeleton in the transition-zone in developing growth cones. CRMP2 and CRMP4 also interacted with one another coordinately to promote growth cone development and axonal elongation. Genetic silencing of CRMP2 enhanced, whereas overexpression of CRMP2 suppressed, the inhibitory effects of CRMP4 knockdown on axonal development. In addition, knockdown of CRMP2 or overexpression of truncated CRMP2 reversed the promoting effect of CRMP4. With the overexpression of truncated CRMP2 or CRMP4..."
