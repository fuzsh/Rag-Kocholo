        "text": "The corresponding locations of FAVAT-selected residues in 1GKQ and 1KCX\n\nThe possible functions of imidase amino acids selected by FAVAT were further analyzed using 1GKQ and 1KCX, which are known structures of imidase related proteins. The former is the crystal structure of a D-hydantoinase that represents an A protein (Group III) in FAVAT analysis. The latter is the crystal structure of a dihydropyrimidinase-related protein (CRMP1) that represents a ~A protein (Group II) in FAVAT analysis. Figure shows their corresponding sequences and secondary structures. The similar β/α core structures were observed in the wiring diagrams of 1GKQ and 1KCX. The significant difference in these structures is that 1GKQ forms a typical (β/α)8 domain, but 1KCX does not. The FAVAT-selected amino acids may reflect both the structure feature and metal requirement that are responsible for the different functions of the A and ~A proteins. The corresponding locations of Ala34 and His459 in 1GKQ (Arg30 and Trp448 in the N-terminal and C-terminal β-Sheet, respectively) and in 1KCX (Gln44 and Met465 in the N-terminal and C-terminal β-Sheet, respectively) were domains in which they interact with another monomer to form a quaternary structure in both hydantoinase and CRMP1 [34,35]. Residues His67, His69, Ala134, Lys159, His248 and Asp326 (His59, His61, Ala126, Kcx150, His239 and Asp315 in 1GKQ; His73, Tyr75, Asp139, Gln165, Lys254 and Gly332 in 1KCX) are located in the β/α core region.\n\nFigure is a topological view of the corresponding FAVAT-selected amino acids in 1GKQ. Thermus sp. D-hydantoinase (1GKQ) contains two divalent metal ions in active site (Fig. ). The central binuclear zinc center is bridged by the carboxylated lysine residue (Kcx150) and a hydroxide ion. Residues His59, His61, His183, His239 and Asp315 correspond to the active site zinc ion (Fig. ). The corresponding residues were conserved in other members of the amidohydrolase superfamily [36,37]. However, in CRMP1, four of the five corresponding residues are diverse [38]. These residues were all identified by FAVAT analysis. Other candidates recognized by FAVAT analysis, Ala134, Arg302, Ala34, Met297 and His459, were also found to reside in positions critical to protein function. The corresponding residue of Ala134 in 1GKQ (Ala126), was located near the active site (Fig. ). Residues Arg302 and Met297 (Arg292 and Met287 in 1GKQ, respectively) were located at the helix-loop domain outside the (β/α)8 catalytic domain. This implies that they may be important for maintaining structure or stabilizing the protein conformation (Fig. ). These preliminary findings merit further detailed study.\n\nAlthough the metal coordinators of imide-hydrolyzing enzymes in this case study were dispersed sequentially, almost all the known metal coordinators in 1GKQ were identified by FAVAT except His 183 (His 192 for rat imidase). This residue is conserved in CRMP1 but lacks metal and amidohydrolytic activity. The role of this histidine needs further study. The major difference between bacterial hydantoinase and mammalian imidase is their metal content. The former contains two metal ions while the later contains only one metal ion [39,40]. Fewer metal coordinators may be needed for mammalian imidase, and residue His 192 may not be required as a coordinator of metal ions in rat imidase. A mammalian imidase was crystallized recently [41]. The difference between mammalian imidase and non-mammalian imidase is expected to be clarified in the near future.\n\nObservation and assumption\n\nTable shows the significant findings of the comparisons of sequence identity and functional properties of the imidase-related proteins in the amidohydrolase superfamily. Sequence-related proteins (Group II) had no imidase activity even though the overall similarity of sequences in this group was higher than 50% [61]. This phenomenon implicated that key amino acid residues for imidase activity have been altered or removed from Group II proteins. In contrast, functionally identical and functionally related enzymes (Group III and Group IV, respectively) had lower sequence identity, but they basically catalyzed the same reaction. For these enzymes, few conserved residues should be needed to provide a similar imidase function. The above observation implies a principle for classifying the sequence or the functional divergent enzymes in a superfamily, which may help to develop a feature amplified voting algorithm for identifying key residues in a target protein. Biologists generally select a sequence of interest as a target and perform BLAST analysis to recover related protein sequences. By definition, a specific function or property (e.g., substrate specificity) of a sequence of interest can be used to cluster the related sequences into different groups. For example, if property A is used to classify these sequences, sequences with property A should be classified into group A. Otherwise, the sequence should be classified into group ~A. Based on the classification of these three groups, a critical assumption can be made. When the target sequence, the A sequence and the ~A sequence belong to a protein superfamily, the conserved residues of the target sequence and the A sequence should correlate to property A. However, the non-conserved residues of the target sequence and ~A sequence should also reflect the negative correlation in property A. The intersection of the residues provides important functional clues. Thus, important residues can be found by comparing these three property groups. Therefore, the three-profile alignment method was developed to optimize the alignment of three groups so that key residues are then revealed by voting algorithm. Figure shows the FAVAT flowchart that was developed to retrieve useful information for these distinct groups. Analysis of the imidase-related sequences in Table indicated that, within this superfamily, the degree of sequence similarity did not necessarily reflect the similarity in biochemical properties. This provides a good opportunity to develop a novel method for extracting functional residues of a target enzyme. In this work, FAVAT was used to examine each residue in mammalian imidase by comparing other sequences in the amidohydrolase superfamily. Given the limited structural information about mammalian imidase, the analytical results of this study should provide important clues for enzymologists to perform further in-depth biochemical analyses of these results.\n\nAlgorithm\n\nThe FAVAT was performed in two steps. The first step was to align the target enzyme, functionally identical enzymes (A proteins) and sequence-related proteins (~A proteins) using three-profile alignment. The three-profile alignment algorithm, which is based on the dynamic programming three-way alignment approach [62,63], was designed to align three profiles in a space. As in the FAVAT pre-process, each profile can be generated by multiple sequence alignment tools such as T-COFFEE, HMMER [64] and MUSCLE.\n\nLet P1, P2 and P3 be three profiles, and P1i, P2j and P3k refer to the ith, jth and kth positions in P1, P2 and P3, respectively, starting from 1. The symbol “-” denotes a “gap” in the alignment. Scores for the alignment of two columns are denoted by Sp(α, β). The scoring pair profiles P1-P2 are defined as follows:\n\nwhere Sp12 is the score at the ith andjth columns on P1 and P2, respectively. The P1 has m sequences, and P2 has n sequences. The Wa and Wb are the sequence weights for sequence a in P1 and sequence b in P2, respectively. The residue at ith column for sequence a in P1 is denoted by r1(a,i). The M is the value of the substitute matrix for r1(a,i) and r2(b,j). Many substitution matrices, such as BLOSUM, have been proposed to improve alignment accuracy [65]. Similarly, the definitions of scoring pair profiles P1-P3 and P2-P3 are similar to those of pair profile P1-P2. Gap penalties are determined by gap opening (GOP) and gap extension (GEP) scores. The best score of the alignments with prefixes P1i, P2j and P3k is denoted by S(i, j, k) if the residues (P1i, P2j, P3k) are aligned; G(i, j, k) is the best score given that (P1i, P2j, -) is the last column of the partial alignment, and H(i, j, k) is the best score given that the last column is of the form (P1i, -, -). E(i, j, k), F(i, j, k), I(i, j, k) and J(i, j, k) are defined analogously. These quantities clearly satisfy the recursions summarized in Fig. .\n\nThe next step after the alignment is to determine whether amino acid residues critical for imidase activity exist in target and A proteins but are absent in ~A proteins. In the second step, a voting score (V-score) is given based on the previous assumption, and the V-scores are then summed in each comparison. In this step, a substitution matrix (BLOSUM62) is used to give V-score when each sequence of property A and ~A is compared to the target sequence. The V-score is calculated as follows:\n\nVk(a,b) = M[tk, A(a,k)] – M[tk, ~A(b,k)],\n\nwhere Vk(a,b) is the V-score at the kth residues on target sequence, sequence a in A proteins and sequence b in ~A proteins. The A and ~A proteins have m and n sequences, respectively. The tk is the kth residue of the target sequence. The A(a,k) and ~A(b,k) are the kth residues on sequence a in A proteins and on sequence b in ~A proteins, respectively. The M[tk, A(a,k)] is the value of the substitution matrix for tk and A(a,k). Figure shows the V-score calculation. The BLOSUM62 substitution matrix is generally used for protein or nucleic acid sequence alignment. In the proposed algorithm, each V-score is given and accumulated to a total score (T-Score) until all sequences of property A and ~A are compared. The T-Score is calculated as follows:\n\nwhere Tk is the T-Score at the kth residue on target sequence. The T-Score at each residue position is obtained by adding m × n V-scores. The normalization function is used to transform all T-scores into a range from 0 to 100 in FAVAT. The normalization function is as follows:\n\nwhere Max(T) and Min(T) are the maximum and minimum scores of all T-scores, respectively. The details of the FAVAT algorithm are shown below, and Fig. presents an example of V-Score and T-Score calculations using FAVAT.\n\nAlgorithm FAVAT (t, P, Q);\n\nInput: Target sequence t, a set of proteins P without property A, a set of proteins Q with property A. P has p sequences and Q has q sequences.\n\nOuput: The scores correspond to the residues of t (high T-scores indicate potentially critical residues)\n\nBegin\n\n1 /*Step1: Do three-profile alignment by dynamic programming method among t, the proteins P, and the proteins Q.

When voting for reliable critical residue candidates, three relations are considered: the relation between target sequence and A proteins, the relation between target sequence and ~A proteins and the relation between A proteins and ~A proteins. To accurately identify the key residues, some useful alignment tools with physicochemical properties, such as T-COFFEE and HMMER, can be employed in the FAVAT pre-process to align A and ~A proteins separately (profiles). The appropriate alignments of A and ~A proteins can enhance the accuracy of the resulting alignment to the target sequence, A and ~A proteins by three-profile alignment. The most important residues can then be found accurately from the resulting alignment using FAVAT. The FAVAT algorithm was designed to account for the importance of alignment-based voting skill by V-score function. The time complexity of FAVAT is O(mmax3), and mmax is the length of the resulting alignment by three-profile alignment. To reduce the time complexity of three-profile alignment method, this study developed a parallel version implemented by the MPICH library. The time complexity for the parallel version is O(mmax3/p), where p is the number of processors. After the voting process, the residue candidates obtain high T-scores. The uncritical candidates can be eliminated by advanced research."
