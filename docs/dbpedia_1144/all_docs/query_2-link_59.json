Therefore, primary cilia can be used as a partial model to study the assembly of sperm flagella. Recently, we have shown that Collapsin Response Mediator Protein 2 is required for ciliogenesis, localizes to the basal body, and can be transported into the primary cilium, however, the involved mechanism is not clear, but was proposed to involve kinesin proteins. KLC3 is the only known kinesin light chain expressed in elongating spermatids that develop the flagellum. In this study, we investigated the expression of CRMP2 in mouse testis and we studied if CRMP2 and KLC3 interact. We observed CRMP2 mRNA expression in testis, along with expression of the other family members CRMP1, CRMP3 and CRMP4. CRMP2 protein localized in elongating spermatids to the neck region containing the centrioles, structures that also form the basal body. We show interaction of KLC3 and CRMP2 in cell culture and discovered that the interaction requires a sequence of CRMP2 different from that which is known to bind KLC1. We also show that KLC3 expression can change the localization of CRMP2 from one associated with microtubules to one associated with complexes of KLC3 and mitochondria. Our study suggests a role for CRMP2 in the elongating spermatid.",
