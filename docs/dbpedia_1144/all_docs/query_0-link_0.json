        "text": "2.2. Protein overexpression, purification and crystallization\n\nThe pET-SUMO-CRMP-1 construct was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (Invitrogen). For expression, the cells were grown in 1.5 l LB medium containing 50 mg l−1 kanamycin at 310 K. When the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.6, the temperature was decreased to 291 K and the culture was induced with 1 mM IPTG. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (10 000g, 30 min) 20 h after induction and then frozen at 193 K until use.\n\nThe cells from the LB medium were resuspended in 100 ml 20 mM Na2HPO4–HCl pH 7.5 containing 200 mM NaCl and 1 mM PMSF. The lysate was sonicated on ice and centrifuged (28 500g, 30 min, 277 K). The resulting supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-affinity column (5 ml Ni–NTA resin, Qiagen) followed by wash buffer (ten column volumes; 20 mM Na2HPO4–HCl pH 7.5 containing 500 mM NaCl and 100 mM imidazole). The bound His-tagged fusion protein was eluted with elution buffer (three column volumes; 20 mM Na2HPO4–HCl pH 7.5 containing 500 mM NaCl and 200 mM imidazole); the buffer was changed to 20 mM Na2HPO4–HCl pH 7.5 containing 150 mM NaCl and 35 mM imidazole using 50 kDa cutoff Amicon Centricons (Millipore). The yield of the SUMO-CRMP-1 protein was estimated to be 10–15 mg per litre of culture.\n\nAfter purification on a nickel-affinity column, the SUMO-CRMP-1 protein was cleaved with factor Xa at the IEGR cleavage site between the SUMO fusion and CRMP-1. SUMO-CRMP-1 fusion protein (∼20 mg) was cleaved by incubation with 30 µg factor Xa (BioLabs; 20 h at 277 K) in cleavage buffer (total volume 10 ml; 20 mM Na2HPO4–HCl pH 7.5 containing 150 mM NaCl and 35 mM imidazole). The protein mixture was then centrifuged (2000g, 10 min) and the supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-affinity column (3 ml Ni–NTA resin, Qiagen). The CRMP-1 protein lacking the N-terminal 6×His tag was collected in the flowthrough, while the 6×His tag and undigested SUMO-CRMP-1 protein remained bound to the column. The buffer of the purified CRMP-1 was changed to 20 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5 containing 150 mM NaCl. CRMP-1 was then concentrated to 10 mg ml−1 using 50 kDa cutoff Amicon Centricons (Millipore). The purity of CRMP-1 was greater than 99% as estimated by SDS–PAGE; the yield was determined to be 6–9 mg per litre of culture. To assay the thrombin protease cleavage of full-length CRMP-1, CRMP-1 (2.5 mg) and thrombin (100 µl; Sigma catalogue No. T6884; 1 kU) were mixed in a final reaction buffer (550 µl; 20 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl) and incubated at 277 K overnight. The resulting mixture was then characterized and purified via analytical gel filtration as described below. All protein concentrations were determined with a BCA protein-assay kit (Thermo Scientific) using bovine serum albumin as a standard reference.\n\nCrystallization experiments were performed at 293 K using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. Drops were made by mixing protein solution (10 mg ml−1 in 20 mM Tris–HCl with 150 mM NaCl pH 7.5) and well solution (50 mM ammonium sulfate, 50 mM sodium citrate, 12–15% PEG 8000) in a 1:1 ratio. Crystals began to grow within 1 or 2 d. High-quality crystals appeared after incubation for 14 d. Before cooling in liquid nitrogen, the crystals were dehydrated in sequential solutions composed of 50 mM ammonium sulfate, 50 mM sodium citrate and various concentrations of PEG 8000 (17, 19, 21, 23 and 25%), allowing about 5 min in each solution.\n\n3.2. Overall structure of human CRMP-1\n\nHuman CRMP-1 crystallizes in space group P21 with four subunits in the asymmetric unit. The unit-cell parameters are a = 84.815, b = 147.846, c = 86.023 Å, β = 94.61°; the data-processing statistics are reported in Table 1 . Electron density was visible for residues 15–496. As no electron density was detectable for residues 1–14 and 497–572 they were excluded from the final model. An example of the quality of the electron-density map is shown in Fig. 2 for residues Arg467–Pro475. The CRMP-1 folds into a structure containing 19 α-helices and 21 β-strands (Fig. 3 a). The N-terminal small domain comprises seven antiparallel β-sheets (β1–β7, residues 15–68). The large portion of the protein is an α/β-barrel domain (residues 69–460); the core scaffold within this domain is a triosephosphate isomerase (TIM)-like structure (which comprises eight α-helices and seven β-sheets in the order α1, β11, α2, β12, α3, β13, α4, β14, α7, β15, α8, β16, α12, β17, α15). Residues 461–496 form a long random coil linking β21 to α19 and extending to the C-terminus. The C-terminus of the protein (residues 497–572) was severed during crystallization and was excluded from the structure. CRMP-1 forms tetramers in the crystal (Fig. 3 b). Four protomers are stabilized by two separate contacts. Interface I is located between chains A and B and chains C and D. Residues in β2 (Arg23), α15–α16 (Asp376, Glu377, Asn378 and Gln379) and α19 (Gln480 and Arg481) contribute significantly to the interface. Interface II is located between chains A and C and chains B and D. Residues in α5 (Leu204 and Glu208), α7 (Leu231, Phe237, Thr241 and Arg245) and α8 (Ile263) are major contributors to the interface. Besides homotetramerization, CRMP-1 protomers are known to form heterotetramers with other CRMP isoforms. The residues in interface I are conserved among CRMP-1 to CRMP-4 (Fig. 4 ); this interface is thus likely to serve as a site for hetero-oligomerization. According to the model proposed by Stenmark et al. (2007 ▸), the tetramerization of CRMP begins with two protomers arranging into homodimers via interface II, which then form a homotetramer or heterotetramer via interface I. The precise manner in which CRMP heterotetramers are formed, based on either a comparative analysis of the available homotetramer structures (Ponnusamy & Lohkamp, 2013 ▸; Ponnusamy et al., 2014 ▸) or biochemical experiments (Wang & Strittmatter, 1996 ▸; Fukada et al., 2000 ▸; Ponnusamy & Lohkamp, 2013 ▸), remains inconclusive. Without the structural detail of hetero-oligomers, it is still difficult to precisely identify the residues that might contribute to the preferential formation of such hetero-oligomers.\n\nHuman CRMP-1 and the mouse counterpart differ at only 20 amino acids of 572. The main sequence variation is located in the region from β-strand 21 to α-helix 19 (residues 459–493). Seven of 35 amino acids (∼20%) differ between mouse and human CRMP-1, indicating some functional disparity related to this region. The crystal structure of CRMP-1 from mouse has been determined (Deo et al., 2004 ▸). Compared with the resulting human CRMP-1 structure, the overall backbones of these two closely related proteins are highly similar (pairwise Cα r.m.s.d. of 0.338 Å for human CRMP-1 versus mouse CRMP-1 comparing the chain A monomer). Most nonconserved residues between human CRMP-1 and mouse CRMP-1 are located on the outer surface of the tetramer complex; these residues affect neither the backbone folding nor the oligomerization interfaces.\n\n3.3. A possible functional randomly coiled C-terminal tail\n\nWe found that residues 488–496 of CRMP-1, corresponding to the C-terminal end of the electron density, form a randomly coiled link and connect the four protomers to each other (Fig. 5 a). This connection is located between chains A and C and chains B and D, and is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between residues in this segment (Ser495 and Arg496) of one monomer and α-helix 6 (Glu221) and α-helices 10–11 (Tyr290, Ser292 and Lys293) of the other (Fig. 5 b). A similar inter­action of C-terminal stretches involving an Arg–Glu pair has been reported in human CRMP-5 (Ponnusamy & Lohkamp, 2013 ▸), in which the interactions besides the salt bridge of an Arg–Glu pair are difficult to model unambiguously because of a lack of electron density. Here, we provide a clearer map of the electron density of residues contributing to the cross-linking of CRMP-1. The link is likely to serve as an enhancement of interface II and to contribute to oligomerization, but only one link is built in the four protomers in our model because of the poor quality of electron density for the other three protomers, indicating that this link might be flexible in the crystals.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, crystals of high quality were only obtained after the C-terminal tails were auto-cleaved. It is thus of interest to determine whether these links agree with the hypothetical model (Schmidt & Strittmatter, 2007 ▸) that a link structure of some kind is located at the CRMP-1 surface and is critical for tetramerization. Full-length CRMP-1 (amino acids 1–572) was then cleaved at Arg471 using thrombin protease (as predicted using the ExPASy PeptideCutter program; http://www.expasy.org/; Gasteiger et al., 2005 ▸) to release a fragment of 100 amino acids that comprises the auto-cleaved 76 amino acids at the C-terminal tail. As expected, the main proteolytic product has a smaller apparent molecular mass than untreated CRMP-1 protein (Fig. 1 b, lane 2 versus lane 1); the purified C-terminal tail of CRMP-1 (472–572 with theoretical molecular mass 11 014 Da) from size-exclusion chromatography also revealed a sufficiently high purity (Fig. 1 c). We subsequently replicated the analytical gel-filtration experiments for CRMP-1 but found no pronounced destabilization of homotetramer formation after thrombin cleavage (Fig. 6 a). For the thrombin-cleaved proteins, the peak profile shows a slight shift towards the tetrameric form, indicating a possible conformational change of its structure. The circular dichroism spectrum of truncated CRMP-1 also shows an observable difference from the spectrum of full-length CRMP-1, which exhibits a decreased depth and broadening of the far-UV CD spectrum at about 208 nm (Fig. 6 b). We therefore postulate that the link is likely to extend the interaction with the corresponding protomer. We also identified that the CD spectrum of the purified C-terminal tail (concentration 0.13 mg ml−1) over the wavelength range 180–260 nm shows properties that are significantly different from the spectra of the α-helix-rich protein myoglobin and the β-strand-rich protein concanavalin A (Fig. 6 b, inset), agreeing with the secondary structure predicted from the protein sequence (Prilusky et al., 2005 ▸): the C-terminal tail is intrinsically in a random-coil conformation."
