        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe semaphorins constitute a major family of axon guidance cues (Raper, 2000). Sema3A repulses axons through the co-receptor proteins neuropilin-1 (NP1) (He and Tessier-Lavigne, 1997; Kolodkin et al, 1997) and Plexin A (PlexA1-3) (Takahashi et al, 1999; Tamagnone et al, 1999; Cheng et al, 2001). Of the co-receptors, NP1 represents the ligand-binding partner, while PlexA1 includes a cytoplasmic segment that transduces the Sema3A signal into cytoskeletal reorganization. Alteration of growth cone cytoskeletal dynamics appears to be mediated by the small G protein Rac1 (Jin and Strittmatter, 1997), PAK kinase (Aizawa et al, 2001), LIM kinase and its substrate, cofilin, which acts to depolymerize actin.\n\nIn addition, members of the collapsin response mediator protein (CRMP) family are also critical to Sema3A function. Antibodies to a specific region of CRMPs abolish Sema3A-mediated growth cone collapse (Goshima et al, 1995). The vertebrate branch of the family currently includes five CRMP isoforms (Nakamura et al, 2000), while the Drosophila genome appears to encode for a single CRMP. Sequence homology with unc-33 (38% identity, 61% similarity for chick CRMP2) may reflect aspects of shared function. Unc-33 mutants demonstrate abnormal axon growth, with premature termination, aberrant branching, and unusual microtubule morphology (Li et al, 1992).\n\nCRMP family members share a remarkable sequence similarity (approximately 60% identity) with dihydropyrimidinase (DHPase), an enzyme involved in pyrimidine catabolism, although no DHPase activity has been detected for CRMP (Wang and Strittmatter, 1997). CRMP1, CRMP2, CRMP3, and CRMP4 family members are approximately 75% identical in protein sequence. CRMP5 (also known as CRAM or CRMP3 associated molecule) shares a 50% identity with other CRMPs and DHPase (Fukada et al, 2000; Inatome et al, 2000). The CRMPs share 25–40% identity with the bacterial hydantoinase proteins, several of which have known structures (Abendroth et al, 2002b; Cheon et al, 2002; Xu et al, 2003).\n\nLike unc-33, the CRMPs appear to play a complex role in axon growth as well as microtubule dynamics and axon induction. CRMPs localize to the lamellipodia and filopodia of axonal growth cones, suggesting a role in axon guidance (Minturn et al, 1995). Moreover, CRMP2 is upregulated after axotomy (Minturn et al, 1995), and appears to increase the formation of axon-type processes from hippocampal neurons (Inagaki et al, 2001). CRMP2 has been reported to bind tubulin dimers directly and modulate microtubule assembly (Fukata et al, 2002). CRMPs have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of a paraneoplastic neurologic syndrome (Honnorat et al, 1999). Interaction studies have implicated phospholipase D2 (PLD2) (Lee et al, 2002), the cytosolic tyrosine kinase Fes (Mitsui et al, 2002), and intersectin in CRMP function (Quinn et al, 2003).\n\nTo better understand the molecular bases of CRMP function, we have determined the crystal structure of CRMP1. CRMP1 assumes a bilobed ‘lung-shaped' structure with an N-terminal β-sheet domain and a C-terminal α/β barrel domain. Four CRMP1 protomers comprise a large oligomeric structure supported by interactions among surface α-helices. Structure-based mutagenesis has revealed a constitutively active mutant CRMP1, which implicates a phylogenetically conserved loop region in CRMP1 effects on cell morphology.\n\nResults\n\nCRMP1 structure determination\n\nTo characterize the bases of CRMP action, we determined the X-ray structure of murine CRMP1. Limited proteolysis of CRMP1 (residues 8–572) demonstrated that the C-terminal segment (approximately 75 amino acids) is proteolytically susceptible (data not shown). Recombinant CRMP1 (residues 8–525) yielded high-quality crystals with two protomers/asymmetric unit. The structure was determined at 2.1 Å resolution. Phases were determined by comparison of diffraction data of three crystals: a sulfur methionine protein crystal used as native, a selenomethionine protein crystal with data collected at three wavelengths, and a second selenomethionine protein crystal. The current refinement model has an R-factor of 20.4% and a free R-value of 23.3% (Brunger, 1992) with excellent stereochemistry ( ).\n\nTable 1\n\nStructure determination (22 Se sites)Data setResolution (Å)Reflections, measured/uniqueCompleteness (%), overall/outer shellRsqym (%), overall/outer shellPhasing power, isoacentric/centricRcullis, ano/isoCrystal 1—native λ=0.9840 Å24.0–2.10460410/8462799.6/99.99.8/31.0——Crystal 2—Se-Met λ1=0.9792 Å24.0–2.35746069/11545299.8/99.97.3/29.83.09/2.050.89/0.53 λ2=0.9794 Å24.0–2.35670003/108347100.0/99.98.4/28.82.83/1.310.86/0.52 λ3=0.9641 Å24.0–2.35644465/104178100.0/100.09.1/29.92.70/1.290.85/0.54Crystal 3—Se-Met λ=0.9840 Å24.0–2.12753778/7823993.4/76.86.3/31.32.43/1.23—/0.58Overall figure of merit=0.68Refinement—crystal 3Resolution (Å)Completeness (%)R-factorFree R-factorData with ∣F∣>2σ∣F∣)24.0–2.1290.40.2040.233R.m.s.d.Bond lengths, 0.0127 ÅBond angles, 1.53°Rsym=Σ∣I−〈I〉∣/ΣI, where I=observed intensity, 〈I〉=average intensity obtained from multiple observations of symmetry-related reflections; phasing power=r.m.s.d.; (∣FH∣/E), ∣FH∣=heavy atom structure factor amplitude; E=residual lack of closure. r.m.s.d. bond lengths and r.m.s.d. bond angles are the respective root mean square deviations from ideal values. Free R-factor was calculated with 5% of data omitted from the structure refinement.\n\nStructural overview\n\nThe structure of CRMP1 is illustrated in . Electron density was visible for residues 15–490, consistent with the proteolysis results described above. The polypeptide chain consists of two domains in the form of a ‘molecular lung' of dimensions 65 × 75 × 50 Å. Structure-based sequence alignments of vertebrate and invertebrate CRMP homologues show significant pairwise identities (33–76%) and demonstrate that the hydrophobic core is conserved, whereas insertions map to surface loops ( ). We conclude, therefore, that the phylogenetically conserved regions of all known members of the CRMP share the three-dimensional structure illustrated in (Sander and Schneider, 1991).\n\nshows a comparison of the amino-acid sequence of five mammalian CRMP family members, Drosophila CRMP, unc-33, and the related human DHPase protein with the CRMP1 secondary structure highlighted above. The N-terminal domain, which forms the ‘upper lobe' or ‘apex' of the lung, is a seven-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (residues 15–69; dimensions 32 × 26 × 22 Å), formed by β-strands S1-S2-S3-S4-S5-S6-S7. The C-terminal domain, which forms the ‘lower lobe' or ‘base', is an α/β barrel (residues 70–490; dimensions 60 × 65 × 49 Å) with secondary structure elements arranged in the order S8-S9-S10-H1-S11-H2-S12-H3-S13-H4-S14-H5-H6-H7-S15-H8-S16-H9-H10-H11-H12-S17-H13-H14-H15-H16-H17-H18-S18-S19-S20-S21-H19. Underlined secondary structure elements comprise an eight-fold α/β ‘TIM barrel' (pairwise α-carbon root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 3.5 Å for 162 residues of CRMP1 versus Leishmania mexicana triose phosphate isomerase), which forms the core of CRMP1. The remaining secondary structure elements surround the core, with some elements contributing to the oligomerization interface of CRMP1 (see below). An extended 15-residue linker (length 39 Å) connects β-strand S21 to α-helix H19. The lower lobe interacts with the upper lobe via hydrogen bonding between β-strands S18 and S7, and packing of α-helices H16, H17, H18, and the H18–S18 loop against β-strands S1–S7.\n\nCRMP1 forms a tetramer\n\nThe two CRMP1 protomers comprising the asymmetric unit are related by a noncrystallographic two-fold axis of symmetry. The resulting interface (interface 1, shown between the blue and yellow or between the green and red monomers in ) buries a total of 2275 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface area. In addition, each CRMP1 monomer packs against a crystallographic symmetry-related molecule (interface 2, shown between blue and red, or green and yellow monomers) to bury an additional 2416 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface area, giving a tetrameric structure for CRMP1. There are no contacts between diametrically opposed monomers. The observation of a CRMP1 homotetramer, burying a total of 9382 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface area, is consistent with prior yeast two-hybrid data and gel-filtration studies, which show that CRMP family members oligomerize and exist as tetramers when purified from brain (Wang and Strittmatter, 1997). Rat DHPase also occurs as a tetramer (Kikugawa et al, 1994) as does D-hydantoinase, a homologous bacterial protein ( , see below).\n\nInterface 1 of the CRMP1 tetramer is stabilized by salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals contacts between residues in the S2–S3 segment, α-helix H8, and the H15–H16 segment of one monomer, and α-helices H18, H12, and H19, respectively, of a second monomer ( and ). Interface 2, at the base of the lung, is stabilized by interactions between α-helices H4 and H7 of one monomer, and α-helices H5 and H7, respectively, of its partner.\n\nThe yeast two-hybrid studies also demonstrated some specificity in hetero-oligomerization. Specifically, the CRMP1–CRMP5 interaction is very weak (Fukada et al, 2000), and CRMP1, CRMP2, and CRMP3 prefer hetero-oligomerization to homo-oligomerization (Wang and Strittmatter, 1997). These preferences can be partially explained by an analysis of sequence conservation at the dimer interfaces. Of the residues involved in tetramer contacts, 71% (32/45) are conserved among all five vertebrate CRMP isoforms and human DHPase, suggesting that the CRMP homo- and heterotetramers and the DHPase tetramer resemble the oligomeric structure of CRMP1 shown in . Among the four highly homologous CRMP isoforms (1–4), 84% of residues contributing to tetramerization are conserved ( ). Significant differences in sequence are, however, likely to affect the intermolecular interaction of α-helix H19 with the H15–H16 loop.\n\nThese differences fall into two categories. The first involves the variation of polar residues ( and ). Gln480 in α-helix H19 interacts with residues Asp376 (OD2–NE2=3.1 Å), Glu377 (OE2–OE1=3.0 Å), and Asn378 (OD1–NE2=2.8 Å) from the H15–H16 loop of CRMP1. Although residues in H15–H16 are conserved among all CRMP isoforms, Gln480 is Arg or Lys in CRMPs 2–5. Interaction of these basic residues with the acidic residues in the H15–H16 loop may explain the preference for hetero-oligomeric over homo-oligomeric CRMP interactions. Two more polar residues undergo potentially significant variations. Gln379 in CRMP1, which forms a weak hydrogen bond with Arg481 (OE1–NE=3.4 Å), is Glu in CRMP3, which may participate in stronger salt-bridge interactions. Arg211 in CRMP1, which forms an unfavorable electrostatic interaction with Arg245, is Gln in CRMPs 2–4, but not in CRMP5. CRMP5 also includes a number of variations in residues involved in hydrogen bonding or salt bridges in the CRMP1 tetramer. The most significant is an Arg in the place of Gln379, which would lead to an unfavorable repulsion with Arg481 (see above). Additionally, Glu208, which is involved in a favorable salt bridge with Arg245 (OE1–NH1=3.3 Å), is Gly in CRMP5. Lys269, which forms a hydrogen bond with Tyr316 (ND–OH=3.2 Å), is Met in CRMP5. All three of these residue differences should weaken the affinity of CRMP5 for CRMP1.\n\nThe second category of tetramer interface variations that may influence oligomerization specificity includes interchanges of small and large hydrophobic residues. Ala371 in the H15–H16 loop makes a van der Waals contact with Ile484 (CA–CG2=4.8 Å). In CRMP2, Ala371 is Val, which should make a more significant van der Waals interaction with Ile484 of CRMP1, thus favoring hetero-oligomeric interactions of CRMP1 with CRMP2. Additional ‘small to large' and ‘large to small' changes are seen at hydrophobic residues Ile484, Val488, and Phe489, which could potentially relieve or introduce detrimental steric clashes and favor hetero-oligomeric interactions.\n\nChimeric analysis has previously been used to identify segments of CRMP2 and CRMP3 that mediate hetero-oligomeric specificity (Wang and Strittmatter, 1997). These experiments demonstrated that segments across the entire protein contribute to the CRMP2–CRMP3 interaction, with a predominant role for the N-terminal 435 amino acids. Since CRMP2 and CRMP3 share a high degree of identify across interfaces 1 and 2 ( ), it is plausible that the actual three-dimensional structures of the two proteins have evolved to provide optimal distances for numerous van der Waals interactions, thus favoring a hetero-oligomeric interaction.\n\nIt has been proposed that as a result of weak affinity of CRMP1 for CRMP5, these proteins would not be found in the same tetramer (Fukada et al, 2000). Since the diametrically opposed proteins in the CRMP1 tetramer do not interact, it is possible that two CRMP family members that demonstrate only a weak direct interaction can still be included in the same tetramer. With regard to Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans CRMP, only a subset of residues found at the tetramerization interfaces are conserved. Given low sequence identities between invertebrate and vertebrate CRMP family members, it is not clear whether these residues contribute to similar homo-oligomeric interactions.\n\nCRMP1 resembles metal-dependent amidohydrolases\n\nThe DALI 3D web-based server (Holm and Sander, 1993) employs quantitative pairwise geometrical comparisons between structures to identify proteins that share similar three-dimensional folds. A search using the DALI server revealed strong similarities between the structure of the CRMP1 monomer and a number of proteins in the Protein Data Bank (PDB; www.rcsb.org/pdb/), including D-hydantoinase (PDB ID 1K1D: Z-score=57.1, r.m.s.d.=1.4 Å, sequence identity=39%, 456 α-carbon pairs; PDB ID 1GKQ: r.m.s.d.=1.4 Å, sequence identity=36%, 456 α-carbon pairs; PDB ID 1NFG: r.m.s.d.=1.4 Å, sequence identity=35%, 454 α-carbon pairs) (Abendroth et al, 2002b; Cheon et al, 2002; Xu et al, 2003); L-hydantoinase (PDB ID 1GKR: Z-score=48.9, r.m.s.d.=2.4 Å, sequence identity=26%, 438 α-carbon pairs) (Abendroth et al, 2002a); dihydroorotase (PDB ID 1J79: Z-score=18.2, r.m.s.d.=2.8 Å, sequence identity=14%, 325 α-carbon pairs) (Thoden et al, 2001); urease alpha subunit (PDB ID 1UBP: Z-score=21.8, r.m.s.d.=3.2 Å, sequence identity=16%, 356 α-carbon pairs) (Benini et al, 1996); phosphotriesterase (PDB ID 1PSC: Z-score=13.7, r.m.s.d.=3.2 Å, sequence identity=14%, 252 α-carbon pairs) (Benning et al, 1995); cytosine deaminase (PDB ID 1K6W: Z-score=13.2, r.m.s.d.=4.1 Å, sequence identity=15%, 341 α-carbon pairs) (Ireton et al, 2002); and adenosine deaminase (PDB ID 1A4M: Z-score=10.4, r.m.s.d.=3.6 Å, sequence identity=7%, 255 α-carbon pairs) (Wang and Quiocho, 1998). These nine proteins are members of a ‘superfamily' of metal-dependent amidohydrolases, predicted to share a similar three-dimensional structure (Holm and Sander, 1997). Despite resemblance at the structural level, CRMP1 demonstrates very low to modest sequence conservation with the nine amidohydrolase proteins, with pairwise sequence identities ranging from 6 to 39% for the structurally homologous segments.\n\nThe structural similarity between the CRMP1 and D-hydantoinase monomers merits further elaboration. For the 460 residues N-terminal to helix α-H19 (CRMP1 nomenclature), the two proteins have nearly identical tertiary structures (r.m.s.d.=1.4 Å2), which is consistent with the 39% sequence identity over this region. Moreover, both are tetrameric ( ). The two structures differ, however, in that the D-hydantoinases have no structural counterpart to the H19 α-helix. This relatively minor difference at the monomer level leads to significant differences in tetramer assembly. While D-hydantoinase predominantly uses interactions between the N-terminal upper lobes (including the S5–S6 loop, see mutation analysis below) of different monomers to form one of the two tetramer interfaces ( ), the corresponding segment of CRMP1 does not substantially participate in homomeric interactions. Instead, CRMP1 forms its ‘upper' tetramer interface via interactions between the unique H19 α-helix and the H15–H16 loop ( , ). (The second tetramer interface, involving α-helices H4–H8, is similar for the two proteins.) These differences in quaternary structure lead to significantly greater solvent accessibility for the upper lobe of CRMP relative to that of procaryotic hydantoinases.\n\nAlthough the chemical reactions catalyzed by the amidohydrolase superfamily members differ widely, the proteins share a group of five residues that comprise the active site and are essential for catalytic function. CRMP1 lacks features essential for amidohydrolytic activity and we do not believe that CRMP1 uses this cleft as an enzyme active site. Four of the five residues involved in metal binding and catalysis in other super family members are absent within CRMP1.\n\nHeterologous cellular assay for CRMP function in Sema3A signaling\n\nIn order to explore the relationship between surface domains of the CRMP structure and function, a simple cellular assay amenable to testing a number of CRMP mutants was required. Non-neuronal COS-7 cells expressing PlexA1/NP1 complexes on the cell surface contract in response to Sema3A (Takahashi et al, 1999). This system was employed to examine the effects of CRMPs on Sema3A signaling. Cells expressing PlexA1 and NP1 alone or in combination with different isoforms of CRMP were incubated with AP-Sema3A fusion protein or the NP-1 antagonist AP-Sema3F. As shown previously, when PlexA1 and NP1 are expressed alone, the COS-7 cells have a spread morphology after 60 min Sema3F and 10 min Sema3A treatments. The cell area decreases after 60 min of Sema3A treatment as the cells contract ( ). Cells expressing PlexA1, NP1, and CRMP1 show a reduction in cell area after only 10 min of Sema3A treatment ( ). CRMPs1-4 are equally capable of accelerating Sema3A-induced contraction ( ). Without Sema3A or after 60 min of Sema3A treatment, there is no effect of CRMP on cellular spreading.\n\nTo provide further evidence of CRMP participation in Plexin-dependent signaling, interactions between PlexA1 and CRMPs were explored by co-immunoprecipitation. Myc-tagged CRMP2 and wild-type (WT) PlexA1 were expressed either alone or together, and one or the other protein was immunoprecipitated. Anti-Myc-CRMP immunoprecipitates contain anti-PlexA1 immunoreactivity only from doubly transfected cells ( , left panel). Similarly, anti-PlexA1 immunoprecipitates of co-expressing cell lysates exhibit Myc-reactive CRMP ( , right panel). Myc-PlexA1 interacted with V5-CRMP-1, -2, or -4 ( ). Direct complex formations between recombinant purified PlexA1 and CRMP2 from Escherichia coli were not detectable (data not shown). This may reflect a requirement for additional protein(s) present in HEK293T cells and neurons, or an issue with bacterially expressed PlexA1 protein folding.\n\nFurther evidence for CRMP participation in PlexA1 COS cell signaling derives from modulation of the interaction by NP1 and Sema3A. When NP1 is co-expressed with PlexA1, V5-CRMP is virtually undetectable in anti-Myc immunoprecipitates ( ). However, when the cells are treated with Sema3A for 5 min, a significant amount of V5-CRMP4 immunoprecipitates with PlexA1, and this effect persists for at least 30 min ( ). Therefore, Sema3A binding to PlexA1–NP1 complexes attenuates the ability of NP1 to interfere with PlexA1–CRMP interactions. The NP1 antagonist, Sema3F, fails to increase the amount of V5-CRMP4 detected in anti-Myc immunoprecipitates, verifying the specificity of these ligand effects on CRMP–PlexA1 interactions in COS-7 cells ( ).\n\nEffect of CRMP1 mutants on COS-7 contraction\n\nIn order to identify functional domains of CRMP1, a number of mutant proteins were generated based on information gained from the crystal structure. Alanine substitution mutations of 1–7 residues were performed to disrupt several regions of the protein ( and ). Mutation sites map to solvent-accessible areas that are not buried in the tetrameric structure plus residues found within the CRMP1 monomer–monomer interaction interfaces 1 and 2. Residues were chosen on the basis of high sequence conservation ( ) and/or correspondence to structural features involved in homo- and hetero-oligomeric interactions for the amidohydrolase family members described above. In addition, one truncation mutant was constructed by deleting the highly conserved C-terminal 12 residues (8–560).\n\nCRMP1 mutants were screened in the COS-7 contraction assay to identify regions important for CRMP-mediated facilitation of Sema3A-induced contraction. COS-7 cells expressing NP1, PlexA1, and WT, mutant, or no CRMP1 were treated with Sema3A or Sema3F for 60 min or Sema3A for 10 min at 37°C. Cell area was measured and the degree of cell contraction for each group was calculated as the percentage of cells with an area below 1600 μm2 (Takahashi et al, 1999). WT CRMP1 (amino acids 8–572) facilitates cell shrinkage after 10 min Sema3A treatment when compared to cells expressing no CRMP1 ( ), as shown above ( ). Ala substitutions of residues 367–368 (designated as mCRMP1(367–368)) or residues 487–489 (mCRMP1(487–489)) significantly reduce CRMP1-mediated facilitation of cell contraction after 10 min Sema3A treatment, although cells are contracted after 60 min. Therefore, the response of cells expressing PlexA1, NP1, and mCRMP1(367–368) or mCRMP1(487–489) resembles that of cells expressing PlexA1 and NP1 alone, suggesting that these mutants are inactive. Sema3F does not cause contraction in any of the groups.\n\nMutations of residues 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 55, 56 (within the S5–S6 linker; hereafter designated as 49–56) or 38, 39, 41, 43 (within S4 and S5), have an intriguing effect in the COS-7 contraction assay. Each cluster of residues is located within the mCRMP1 upper lobe ( ). mCRMP1(49–56) or mCRMP1(38,39,41,43), when co-expressed with PlexA1 and NP1, leads to a significant increase in the percent of contracted cells after Sema3F treatment (58.4±5.4 and 50.5±5.1, respectively) as compared to WT CRMP1 (16.5±3.7; ). Cells expressing mCRMP1(49–56) and mCRMP1(38,39,41,43) do not differ from cells expressing WT CRMP1 after 10 or 60 min Sema3A treatment ( ). In addition, cells expressing PlexA1, NP1, and either mCRMP1(49–56) or mCRMP1(38,39,41,43) have a contracted morphology when immunostained with an anti-NP1 antibody in the absence of ligand (data not shown). The cell contraction is not due to adverse effects of the mutant proteins on cell health; these mutations did not alter the number of transfected cells per well, and the nuclei of transfected cells appear to be healthy by Hoechst nuclear staining (data not shown). Therefore, mCRMP1(49–56) and mCRMP1(38,39,41,43) are constitutively active in COS-7 cells.\n\nTo test whether PlexA1 was necessary for the constitutive activity of these mutants, the contraction assay was performed on cells expressing only NP1 and mCRMP1(49–56), mCRMP1(38,39,41,43), or WT CRMP1. Interestingly, only mCRMP1(49–56) is able to induce contraction of COS-7 cells in the absence of PlexA1 ( ). However, the size of cells expressing NP1 and mCRMP1(38,39,41,43) does not significantly differ from those expressing NP1 and WT CRMP1 in response to Sema3A or Sema3F treatment. These results identify one region of the upper lobe of CRMP1 as being required for both upstream regulation by Plexin and downstream signaling to cell contraction.\n\nA total of 12 other mCRMP1 surface mutants and one truncation mutant were screened for functional deficits in their ability to facilitate Sema3A-induced contraction of COS-7 cells. However, none of them differed significantly from WT CRMP1 ( ). Although such results do not rule out the possibility that those regions of CRMP1 are necessary for the activity of the protein, they do emphasize the specificity and importance of the four regions that, when mutated, alter normal protein function.\n\nMolecular interactions and subcellular localization of mCRMPs\n\nOne potential explanation for the altered phenotype of cells expressing the four mCRMPs is an aberrant subcellular localization of these mutants, with secondary alterations in function. The subcellular localization of overexpressed V5-tagged WT CRMP1 versus mCRMP1 protein was visualized by immunoflourescence in COS7 cells and in embryonic day 8 (E8) chick DRG neurons. The four mutant proteins retain localizations indistinguishable from WT CRMP1 in both cell types ( ). Thus, different protein–protein interactions are a more likely cause for the altered activity of these mutants.\n\nThe altered function of the four mutant CRMPs might be due to changed interactions with Plexin, other CRMP monomers, or with downstream effector proteins. Complex formation with PlexA1 and oligomerization with other CRMPs was examined by co-immunoprecipitation of V5 and Myc epitope-tagged proteins. For CRMP–CRMP interactions, this allows an assessment of monomer versus oligomer status, but does not distinguish dimer versus tetramer status. Myc-PlexA1 is retained by each of the mutant V5-CRMP1 proteins ( , left). Similarly, WT Myc-CRMP2 is detected in each anti-V5 immunoprecipitate of a mutant CRMP ( , right). Therefore, the behavior of the COS7 cells expressing these mutant CRMPs is likely to result from altered interactions with cellular proteins other than Plexin or CRMP; this may include downstream effector proteins.\n\nOverexpression of mCRMP1 in embryonic chick dorsal root ganglion neurons\n\nSince the cell contraction assay utilizes a heterologous system, the apparent constitutive activity of mCRMP1(49–56) was examined in the physiologically relevant DRG outgrowth assay. DRG neurons were dissociated from E8 chicks and treated with a viral vector expressing EGFP, V5-tagged WT CRMP1, or V5-tagged mCRMP1(49–56). After 8 h in culture with or without Sema3A, the cells were fixed and the total neurite length/cell was measured. Transgene expression was confirmed by immunostaining with anti-V5 antibody. When compared to control neurons, neurons overexpressing WT CRMP1 show a slight reduction in neurite length ( ). Inhibition of neurite outgrowth by saturating Sema3A concentrations is detectable but modest under these culture conditions due to desensitization. Overexpression of mCRMP1(49–56) reduced neurite outgrowth by ∼40% (29 μm/cell) when compared to WT CRMP1-expressing cells ( ). Sema3A has no inhibitory effect on mCRMP1(49–56)-expressing cells. Therefore, the constitutive activity of mCRMP1(49–56) seen in the cell contraction assay is recapitulated in neurite outgrowth.\n\nTo the extent that mCRMP1(49–56) activates a Sema3A pathway, axon repulsion by Sema3A should be prevented. In a collagen gel co-culture, axon growth from E8 chick DRG explants is strongly repelled from an aggregate of HEK293T cells expressing Sema3A with a four-fold reduction of growth toward the Sema3A source ( ). While DRG axons expressing WT CRMP1 exhibit a similar preference for growth away from Sema3A, DRG axons expressing mCRMP1(49–56) show much less difference between growth toward and away from Sema3A ( ). Thus, constitutively active mCRMP1(49–56) inhibits Sema3A-mediated axon repulsion."
