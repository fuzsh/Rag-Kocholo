        "text": "Abstract\n\nCollapsin response mediator protein 5 (CRMP5) is one of the rare peripheral nerve antigens that is a target of autoantibodies in a paraneoplastic peripheral neuropathy. The pattern of axonal and myelin alterations suggests that CRMP5 is involved in axon-Schwann cell interaction. We examined CRMP5 expression and function in primary cultures of Schwann cells and neurons and at various developmental and regenerating stages of rat sciatic nerve and in CRMP5-deficient mice in vivo. Collapsin response mediator protein 5 was strongly expressed during postnatal development and regeneration and decreased with myelination. It was mainly expressed by immature Schwann cells and persisted in Remak cells in the adult; however, a subpopulation of Schwann cells that were induced to myelinate also expressed CRMP5. We identified 2 axonal molecular cues regulating CRMP5 expression: human neuregulin type 1, which induces CRMP5 expression in immature and premyelinating Schwann cells, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate, which inhibits CRMP5 expression when Schwann cells begin myelination. Collapsin response mediator protein 5-deficient mice showed abnormal Schwann process extension resulting in abnormal cell-axon segregation, indicating that CRMP5 is involved in the morphologic adaptation of Schwann cells to surround axons. These results demonstrate the importance of CRMP5 in axonYSchwann cell cooperation during development and regeneration.\n\nIntroduction\n\nOnconeural antibodies identify a group of proteins shared by the nervous system and tumors that can mediate paraneoplastic autoimmune disease. These proteins may have important functions in the development or homeostasis of tumors and in the physiology of the nervous system. Thus, a better knowledge of their functions may enhance understanding of the mechanisms of paraneoplastic neurologic disorders. With the exception of voltage gated potassium channel-associated protein caspr2, which is the target of an autoimmune disease sometimes associated with thymoma (1), collapsin response mediator protein (CRMP) 5 is the only regular onconeural protein identified to date that is expressed in peripheral nerve (2). Most patients harboring anti-CRMP5 antibodies develop a peripheral neuropathy that is characterized by mixed axonal and myelin alterations (2, 3). These data suggest a major role of CRMP5 in the axon-Schwann cell relationship, but the physiologic role of CRMP5 in the peripheral nervous system has not been investigated to date.\n\nCollapsin response mediator protein 5 belongs to a family of 5 cytosolic proteins (CRMP 1–5) that are related to dihydropyriminidases (4, 5) and the unc-33 gene products in nematodes (6, 7). Collapsin response mediator proteins are expressed during development throughout the nervous system and are downregulated after birth (8). A variety of roles has been demonstrated for these proteins. Collapsin response mediator protein 2, the most extensively studied family member, is involved in axon growth and guidance (7, 9, 10). At the molecular level, it interacts with cytoskeletal proteins (11, 12) and microtubule assembly (13, 14). Collapsin response mediator protein 2 expression has also been characterized in oligodendrocytes, but its role in myelination remains unclear (15, 16). Collapsin response mediator protein 5 has only 50% homology with the other CRMPs (16, 17) and can form homodimers and heterodimers with them (17, 18). Its expression profile suggests that it is involved in neuronal and glial development, migration, and neurite extension. Recently, our group demonstrated that CRMP5 inhibits neurite outgrowth during development and modulates outgrowth effects of CRMP2 (19). In the adult, CRMP5 expression is maintained in areas that retain a capacity for neurogenesis and in a subpopulation of oligodendrocytes (16, 20). Here, we show that CRMP5 is induced in Schwann cells under the control of axonal signals and that it has several functions in Schwann cell morphologic adaptation to axons.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nAnimals\n\nOFA rats and wild-type (WT) or CRMP5−/− mice were housed individually and maintained on a standard light/dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum. All surgical and animal care procedures were performed in accordance with the French and North American guidelines for experimental animal care and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nGeneration of a Mouse Line Deficient in CRMP5\n\nMice deficient in the CRMP5 gene were generated as described (21). Heterozygous animals were identified by genotyping and bred together to produce homozygous mutant mice. The CRMP5−/− mice appeared normal, without any obvious gross abnormalities, and they reproduced normally. The absence of expression of CRMP5 was confirmed in these animals by immunohistochemistry, immunoblot analysis, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis (21). In each experiment, the null status of the studied animals was checked with reverse transcription-PCR.\n\nSurgical Procedures for Sciatic Nerve Cut and Crush Experiments\n\nAnesthetized animals were subjected to aseptic sciatic nerve transection or crush at the sciatic notch. For transection, a portion of the nerve was removed to prevent axonal regeneration. The injured sciatic nerve was removed on Day 3, 7, 14, 21, or 28, and the segment containing the injury site was discarded. The segments of sciatic nerve proximal to its division into the tibial and peroneal nerves and distal to the discarded fragment were retained for further analyses.\n\nTissue Preparation\n\nFor immunohistochemistry, animals were perfused intracardiacally with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% picric acid; tissues were prepared as previously described (16). Cell cultures were fixed by immersion in the same fixative just before immunohistochemistry. For semithin and ultrathin sections, animals were perfused intracardiacally with 4% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde. The sciatic nerves were postfixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and then in 2% osmium tetroxide and embedded in Epon.\n\nPrimary Schwann Cell Cultures\n\nSchwann cells were isolated from newborn rat sciatic nerves (22). A total of 1 × 10 cells were plated per well on poly-L-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)-coated cover-slips and grown in minimal culture media (MCM) containing Dulbecco modified Eagle medium, Earle salts, L-glutamine (Gibco Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich), penicillin, streptomycin, and amphotericin B (Gibco Invitrogen). To eliminate fibroblasts, the cultures were subjected to CD90 anti-Thy 1.1 antibody and guinea pig complement (both from Sigma-Aldrich), resulting in 98% pure Schwann cell cultures. In some experiments, cells were cultured in MCM with 2 μmol/L forskolin (Sigma-Aldrich) or 0.006- to 1.2-nmol/L human neuregulin type 1 (NRG1; EGF domain, heregulin-β1; Sigma-Aldrich) and harvested 2 to 4 days later.\n\nNeuron-Schwann Cell Cocultures\n\nPurified cultures of dorsal root ganglia neurons were established from Embryonic Day 18 (E18) rats (23). Dorsal root ganglia were collected in L-15 medium containing antibiotics, centrifuged, and resuspended in MCM. After mechanical dissociation, cells were plated on poly-L-lysineYcoated coverslips in MCM containing recombinant 50 ng/ml nerve growth factor (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) and 5 mg/ml glucose. To eliminate nonneuronal cells, cytosine β-D-arabino-furanoside (Sigma-Aldrich) was transiently added. Schwann cells were introduced 1 day later, and the cocultures were maintained in medium consisting of MCM, glucose, and nerve growth factor. Neu-regulin type 1 (0.6 nmol/L) was added for the first 3 days. To initiate myelination, cultures were treated with 50 βg/ml ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) for at least 21 days.\n\nSchwann Cell Transfection\n\nTo generate the CRMP5 construct, the open reading frame of CRMP5 was amplified by PCR using plaque-forming units of DNA polymerase and ligated into the pCMV2 vector in frame with the Flag tag. Successful insertion was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Schwann cell primary cultures were grown in multiwell coverslips to 80% confluence. Before transfection, the cells were cultured for 24 hours in antibiotic-free MCM containing 0.6-nmol/L NRG1. The Schwann cells were then transfected with 1, 5, or 7.5 μg of plasmid and Lipofectamine 2000 for 24 hours. Schwann cells transfected with the bacterial alkaline phosphatase (BAP) in the same system and cells transfected with the empty flag-tagged vector were used as negative controls.\n\nAntibodies\n\nPolyclonal anti-CRMP5 antisera were obtained by immunizing New Zealand White rabbits with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the 505- to 524-amino acid sequence of human CRMP5 (GenBank AF264015) conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. When tested against all recombinant human and rodent CRMP proteins, the antisera only reacted with CRMP5 (24). Preimmune sera from the same rabbits were used as the control. The other antibodies used were mouse monoclonal anti-rat neurofilament (Euro-Diagnostica, Arnhem, Netherlands), mouse monoclonal anti-rat myelin-associated glycoprotein (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), mouse monoclonal anti-rat myelin basic protein (MBP; Chemicon), mouse monoclonal anti-rat tubulin (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO), rabbit polyclonal anti-p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR; Chemicon), goat polyclonal anti-rat peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and mouse monoclonal M2 anti-flag (Sigma-Aldrich).\n\nWestern Blotting\n\nWestern blotting was performed as published (15); 30 to 60 μg of denatured protein was electrophoresed in eachlane. After protein transfer, membranes were incubated for 1 hour with 2% dry milk reconstituted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to saturate nonspecific binding sites and then overnight at 4°C with the anti-CRMP5 antibodies diluted 1:100 in PBS containing reconstituted dry milk and Tween. Bound antibodies were detected by incubating the blots with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit or anti-rat IgG antibody (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) diluted 1:50 in PBS, followed by strep-tavidin peroxidase. The color reaction was developed using diaminobenzidine.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\n\nSlices were rinsed in PBS with 0.2% gelatin and 0.1% Triton X, blocked with gelatin, and incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies. After rinses, bound antibodies were revealed either with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) at a 1:1000 dilution or with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) at a 1:2000 dilution. Double immunolabeling was performed by incubating the sample with the primary antibodies under the conditions described previously, followed by the appropriate fluorescein isothiocyanate- and rhodamine-conjugated antibodies. Controls included immunolabeling with preimmune rabbit serum, autofluorescence, and labeling with secondary antibody.\n\nImmunoelectron Microscopy\n\nVibratome sections were cut from the fixed sciatic nerve and stained free-floating using the purified CRMP5 antibodies (1:300) or preimmune serum (1:300). The samples were then treated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Dako) at a 1:1000 dilution. After washing in PBS, the sections were incubated for 5 minutes with streptavidin/ peroxidase complex and rinsed for 5 minutes in PBS, and then bound antibody was revealed using diaminobenzidine. The sections were postfixed in osmium tetroxide sequentially and embedded in Epon. Ultrathin sections were cut from the tissue surface, counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and mounted on a 200-mesh copper grid. These samples were analyzed with a Hitachi H-800 electron microscope (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a Macrofire 1696 × 1696-pixel digital camera (Optronics, East Muskogee, OK).\n\nMorphologic Data Analysis\n\nTo obtain semiquantitative estimates of the expression of CRMP5, p75NTR, neurofilament, myelin-associated glycoprotein, and MBP, high-resolution images were captured using a 5-MP PowerShot G5 digital camera (Canon, Tokyo, Japan) mounted on an Axioskop 40 microscope at ×40 magnification (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The integrated luminance of the end products of immunohistochemical reaction was measured using the Adobe Photoshop software (Adobe Systems Incorporated, San Jose, CA) to estimate the expression of a given protein of interest. For in vivo studies, transversal sections of the rat sciatic nerve were used. The entire nerve endoneural surface area was measured, and the cumulative luminescence of the pictures was reported to the endoneural surface. For in vitro studies, high-resolution images were captured, and the total luminescence of the picture was measured and weighted by the number of cell nuclei identified with 4’,6’-diamidino-2-phénylindole (DAPI). The ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) was used to measure the endoneural surface and estimate the density of myelinated and nonmyelinated fibers (fiber density, axon diameter, myelin sheath thickness, and number of axons per Remak bundle) in semithin or ultrathin sections and for in vitro morphometric analysis.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\n>The SPSS version 14 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL) statistical software was used. Nonparametric tests, including the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S), Mann-Whitney test, and analysis of variance (ANOVA), were used for quantitative data, whereas categorical data were compared using the χ2 and Fisher exact tests. Results are expressed as the mean ± SE. A p value less than 0.05 was considered significant.\n\nResults\n\nCRMP5 Expression Is Downregulated With Schwann Cell Myelination During Postnatal Sciatic Nerve Development\n\nRight sciatic nerves of rats were studied at each Postnatal Days 0, 3, 5, 10, 17, and 30 (n = 5/d). By immunohistochemistry, CRMP5 was diffusely expressed throughout the endoneurium on P0 and P3 (Figs. 1A, D), whereas only a few thinly myelinated fibers (MFs) could be identified either on semithin sections or by expression of PMP22 or MBP. With myelination from P3 to P17 (when the adult stage was reached), CRMP5 was downregulated (Figs. 1AYD) in parallel with p75NTR, a marker of immature Schwann cells (Figs. 1C, D). Using Western blots, we confirmed that CRMP5 expression progressively decreased from P3 to P17 in parallel with p75NTR, whereas PMP22 expression increased in the same time (Fig. 1E). By confocal microscopy, CRMP5 was localized in immature Schwann cells identified by their expression of S100 and p75NTR (Figs. 1B, C). From Postnatal Day 3 onward, Schwann cells engaged in myelination could easily be identified by the fact that they showed a 1:1 ratio with their axon or formed MBP-positive myelin sheaths identifiable on bright-field examination. Quantification of myelinating fibers expressing CRMP5 was performed on 428 to 967 MFs at P3, P10, P17, and P30. Schwann cells engaged in myelination expressed CRMP5 in their cytoplasm as follows: 4.7% at P3, 3% at P10, 2.3% at P17, and 0.7% at P30.\n\nCRMP5 Is Mainly Expressed in the Nonmyelinating Axon-Schwann Cell System in the Adult Sciatic Nerve\n\nIn the adult (P30), less than 1% of myelinating Schwann cells positive for MBP or S100 simultaneously expressed CRMP5 (Figs. 2AYD). In contrast, the nonmyelinating axonY Schwann cell system consistently expressed CRMP5 (Figs. 2E–I). By immunoelectron microscopy, CRMP5 was detected in this system in both nonmyelinated axons and their Schwann cells (Remak cells) (Figs. 2G–I). Immunolabeling was observed in the cytoplasmic compartment of Schwann cells and axons and membrane components including mitochondria.\n\nIn Vitro CRMP5 Is Expressed in Immature Schwann Cells and Downregulated With Myelination\n\nBy immunohistochemistry, in cocultures of neurons and Schwann cells noninduced for myelination, CRMP5 was diffusely expressed by Schwann cells coexpressing p75NTR (Figs. 3A, B). After induction of myelination (Figs. 3C–H), CRMP5 was not detected in this experiment in premyelinating Schwann cells expressing a low level of cytoplasmic MBP (Figs. 3C, D) or in myelinating Schwann cells identified by their association with MBP-positive myelinated axons (Figs. 3EYH). Schwann cells in these cultures did not show p75NTR expression. In contrast, CRMP5 was expressed in nonmyelinated axons of sensory neurons (Fig. 3F) but was not detected in MFs and their Schwann cells which were identified by an MBP-positive myelin sheath (Figs. 3FYH).\n\nSchwann Cell Expression of CRMP5 Is Regulated In Vivo by Axonal Signals During Nerve Regeneration\n\nIn this experiment, 5 animals were tested for each experimental condition. After nerve cutting and axonal regrowth prevention, nerve fibers underwent axonal degeneration (data not shown). Complete axonal and myelin disintegration was seen from Day 7 onward. No regenerating fibers could be identified at any time after sectioning. By immunohistochemistry and Western blotting, CRMP5 was still expressed at Day 3 after cutting in the distal stump, but labeling was not seen thereafter (Figs. 4 and 5). Dedifferentiated Schwann cells diffusely expressed p75NTR during the same period. The lack of neurof ilament immunolabeling corroborated the absence of axonal regeneration (not shown).\n\nIn contrast to cutting, nerve crush allows the regeneration of nerve fibers and the reestablishment of contact between axons and Schwann cells after a phase of axonal degeneration. After crush, CRMP5 was expressed at a low level at Day 7 when all nerve fibers had degenerated on semithin sections. From Day 14 onward, the distal stump was reinvested by regenerating axons (Fig. 4B). Most of them were nonmyelinated at Day 14, although myelin sheaths could be identified at this date (Fig. 4E). There was a strong reexpression of CRMP5 throughout the endoneurium. Confocal microscopy showed colocalization with p75NTR and S100 (Figs. 3C, D) and sometimes with neurofilaments (Fig. 4B). Colocalization of CRMP5 with MBP- (Fig. 4E) or PMP22- (data not shown) positive myelin sheathes was not seen. However, in some Schwann cells committed to myelination (as shown by their 1:1 ratio with axons) or with an identifiable myelin sheath on phase-contrast examination or anti-MBP immunolabeling, CRMP5 was detected in the Schwann cell body (Fig. 4D), indicating an ability of some premyelinating or myelinating Schwann cells to express CRMP5. At Day 21 after crush, the expression of CRMP5 and p75NTR was markedly reduced with ongoing myelination. At Day 28, when the nerve had regained an almost normal morphology, CRMP5 immunolabeling was similar to that in normal adult nerves. Quantification of MFs expressing CRMP5 was performed on 372 to 707 MFs at Days 1, 7, 14, 21, and 28 after crush. At Day 1, 1.5% of MFs expressed CRMP5. At Day 7, no MFs could be identified. At Days 14, 21, and 28, 4.8%, 0.8%, and 0.8% of MFs expressed CRMP5, respectively. On Western blots, CRMP5 was identified as a single or double band with a molecular mass of 55 to 66 kDa after nerve regeneration (Fig. 5A), whereas it was not detected after nerve cut (Fig. 5B).\n\nCRMP5 Expression Is Upregulated by NRG1 and Downregulated by Forskolin\n\nThe mandatory presence of axons for Schwann cell CRMP5 expression indicates that axonal signals are involved in this process. To identify some of these signals, primary rat Schwann cell cultures were incubated with 1) forskolin, which reproduces the effect of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and drives the differentiation of Schwann cells toward the myelinating phenotype, or 2) NRG1, a major axonal signal regulating the fate of Schwann cells by promoting cell multiplication and survival (25). Addition of forskolin at a final concentration of 2 μmol/L to primary Schwann cell cultures for 2 to 4 days induced a premyelinating phenotype, as indicated by intracytoplasmic expression of MBP (not shown), and almost abolished CRMP5 expression (Figs. 6A, B). The opposite effect was observed using NRG1 (0.6 nmol/L for 4 days), which upregulated CRMP5 expression (Figs. 6A, B). By Western blot, there was a dose-dependent induction of CRMP5 by NRG1 (0.006Y1.2 nmol/L for 4 days; Fig. 6C) and inhibition of CRMP5 expression by forskolin (Fig. 6C).\n\nCRMP5−/− Mice Exhibit an Abnormal Schwann Cell-Axon Relationship\n\nFive adult WT and CRMP5−/− mice (Postnatal Days 65 and 111) were analyzed. By immunohistochemistry, the WT mice expression of CRMP5 was similar in the adult mouse sciatic nerves to that observed in rats (Fig. 7G). Collapsin response mediator protein 5 expression was present in Remak cells and a subpopulation of myelinating Schwann cells. As expected, the protein was not detected in CRMP5−/− mice by immunohistochemistry or Western blotting. Immunostaining on WT sciatic nerve with a serum sample of a patient with anti-CV2/CRMP5 antibody gave an immunostaining similar to that observed with the anti-CRMP5 antibody and was negative on CRMP5−/− mice sciatic nerve. A normal control serum gave no immunoreactivity both on WT and CRMP5−/− mice.\n\nMorphometric analyses of the sciatic nerve were performed on ultrathin sections. To avoid a possible selection bias, we analyzed consecutive Remak cells and MFs on randomly selected meshes of the electron microscopy grid. The densities of myelinated and nonmyelinated axons and Remak cells per squared micrometer of endoneurial area were not significantly different in the 2 strains (Fig. 7A). In terms of Remak cells, 256 and 292 bundles were analyzed in CRMP5−/− and WT mice, respectively. Remak cells displayed a different pattern of relationship with unmyelinated axons in the 2 strains (Figs. 7A, B), thus the number of unmyelinated axons per Remak cell was lower in CRMP5−/− mice than in WT mice (6.98 T 6.52 [range, 1–36; SEM, 0.4] vs 8.97 ± 8.61 [range, 1040; SEM, 0.5], p < 0.05; ANOVA, Mann-Whitney, and K-S tests). This difference mainly resulted from changes in 2 subpopulations of Remak cells in CRMP5−/− mice, that is, an increase in the proportion containing 1 or 2 axons (35.9% in CRMP5−/− mice vs 27.7% in WT mice, p G 0.05; χ2 test), and a decrease in those containing more than 25 axons (1.5% in CRMP5−/− mice vs 7.2% in WT mice, p G 0.01; χ2 test).\n\nWe next analyzed 208 and 206 MFs in CRMP5−/− and WT mice, respectively (Figs. 7C–F). The distribution of fibers according to their diameter was significantly different in the 2 strains (p G 0.01; K-S test) because CRMP5−/− mice showed a shift in the distribution of MFs diameters toward a larger size (Fig. 7D). However, myelination as measured by the g ratio (axon diameter/fiber diameter) was similar in the 2 strains (CRMP5−/− mice: 0.72 ± 0.05 vs 0.72 ± 0.05 in WT), indicating that Schwann cells normally adapted their myelin sheath to the size of axons (Figs. 7C, E). Despite this normal adaptation, CRMP5−/− mice exhibited a subpopulation of MFs representing 1.5% of all the myelinating fibers seen on an electron microscope grid with abnormal myelination marked by the presence of several small axons enclosed within a single, abnormally thin myelin sheath corresponding to poly-axonal myelination (Fig. 8). This indicates a perturbation in the ability of myelinating Schwann cells to correctly segregate their axons. These features were not seen in WT mice.\n\nCRMP5 Modifies Schzwann Cell Morphology In Vitro\n\nElongation of the cytoplasmic compartment is an important step for Schwann cells to surround adequately the axon (26). Because several members of the CRMP family are involved in the elongation of cell processes, we hypothesized that the abnormal relationship between axons and Schwann cells in Remak cells in CRMP5−/− mice may be due to a perturbation of Schwann cell ability to correctly adapt their cytoplasm. To test this hypothesis, the morphology of Schwann cells cultured 24 hours in the presence of 0.6 nmol/L NRG1 was studied in WT and CRMP5−/− mice (Figs. 9AYC). A total of 719 and 548 Schwann cells were analyzed in CRMP5−/− and WT mice, respectively. Compared with WT, CRMP5−/− Schwann cells developed fewer processes (2.02 [SEM, 0.03] vs 2.28 [SEM, 0.04], p < 0 .01; ANOVA, Mann-Whitney, and K-S tests), with fewer secondary branching (0.65 [SEM, 0.04] vs 0.81 [SEM, 0.05], p < 0.01). In addition, the maximal length reached by CRMP5−/− Schwann cells after elongation was shorter (66.6 μm [SEM, 1.3] vs 88.2 μm [SEM, 1.6], p < 0.01) as was the length of each process (37.4 μm [SEM, 0.8] vs 42.0 μm [SEM, 1.0], p < 0.01).\n\nWe also examined the effects of increased expression of cytoplasmic CRMP5 on cell morphology by transfecting rat Schwann cells in vitro with plasmids designed for CRMP5 or BAP overexpression as control (Figs. 9DYL). A transfection efficacy of approximately 5% was consistently obained, as assessed by coexpression of the flag tag and CRMP5 or BAP in the same cells, as shown by double immunofluorescence. As expected, a higher CRMP5 expression was seen in transfected Schwann cells (Figs. 9K, L). The morphology of 182 CRMP5- and 175 BAP-transfected Schwann cells was analyzed after immunolabeling with both anti-S100 and anti-flag antibodies. Transfection with the CRMP5-producing vector markedly altered the morphology of Schwann cells (Figs. 9G–L). This effect was not observed after transfection with BAP (Figs. 9E–F). The maximum length of cells transfected with CRMP5, including their processes, was significantly smaller (108.7 T 50.4 vs 135.7 T 54.2 μm in controls, p G 0.01; ANOVA, Mann-Whitney, and K-S tests). They exhibited a smaller cytoplasm (8.5 ± 3.1 vs 9.65 ± 3.1 μm maximal width, p < 0.01) and a normal number of primary processes (2.1 ± 0.6 vs 2.1 ± 0.6 μm, p 9 0.05). However, most interestingly, a significantly higher number of short secondary processes (1.7 ± 1.6 vs 0.3 ± 0.6, p < 0.01), giving rise to multiple, very short, finger-like elongations, was observed in cells transfected with CRMP5 (Fig. 9D).\n\nDiscussion\n\nCRMP5 Is Expressed in Immature and Nonmyelinating Schwann Cells and in a Subpopulation of Myelinating Schwann Cells\n\nIn the rat, Schwann cell precursors begin glial differentiation at E14/E15 (27). From E17/E18 and during the postnatal period, immature Schwann cells evolve into mature myelinating and nonmyelinating cells (25, 28, 29). Collapsin response mediator protein 5 is diffusely expressed in the de veloping CNS, sensory ganglia and spinal roots as early as E16 (16, 17). At birth, when immature Schwann cells are forming families harboring large axon bundles (25), we observed diffuse expression of CRMP5 in the sciatic nerve. This was followed by downregulation during maturation when Schwann cells committed to myelination undergo selection to establish a 1:1 relationship with axons, whereas nonmyelinating Schwann cells still enwrap several axons. Collapsin response mediator protein 5 was diffusely and massively expressed in immature Schwann cells coexpressing p75NTR and was then downregulated with myelin sheath formation. In the adult, CRMP5 expression was maintained in nonmyelinating Schwann cells (Remak bundles), which retain several characteristics of immature cells (30). By immunoelectron microscopy, labeling was diffusely observed in both axons and Schwann cell cytoplasm, although the method used for immunolabeling does not allow fine localization of the protein expression in subcellular structures.\n\nA small proportion (2%–5%) of Schwann cells induced to myelination (as shown by their 1:1 ratio with axons) do express CRMP5 during maturation, as do less than 1% of myelinating Schwann cells in the adult nerve. Interestingly, a similar phenomenon occurs in the CNS in which only a subpopulation of myelinating oligodendrocytes expresses CRMP5 in the adult (16), although the role of this persisting CRMP5 expression is unknown. Overall, the pattern of CRMP5 expression in the Schwann cell is different from that of other CRMPs, indicating differential roles. Thus, CRMP1 and CRMP3 are downregulated between E14 and E17 and are absent in the postnatal sciatic nerve (31), suggesting that they are mainly expressed in Schwann cell precursors, whereas CRMP5 in this study was still expressed in immature and nonmyelinating cells and in some myelinating cells.\n\nCRMP5 Is Re-Expressed During Nerve Degeneration\n\nAfter nerve lesion, the axonal distal stumps undergo wallerian degeneration, leading to axon and myelin debris removal (32). After nerve crush, Schwann cells dedifferentiate and proliferate by recapitulating most development aspects (33) and start remyelination once they contact regrowing axons (34, 35). By contrast, after nerve transection (which prevents axonal growth and therefore axonal contact), Schwann cells are maintained in an undifferentiated state and ultimately undergo apoptosis (36, 37). Here, CRMP5 was massively expressed after nerve injury, but only in the presence of axons. The presence of 2 different bands of CRMP5 during nerve regeneration is similar to what has been observed with the CRMPs in several models of brain or nerve injury and was shown to depend on protein truncation (11, 38–41). Although there are few data on the functional shift between full-length and truncated CRMPs, the presence of a truncated CRMP5 at this stage suggests a function different from that of the full-length protein and indicates a pattern of CRMP5 expression different during nerve regeneration and development, that is, the truncated form is only produced in the former.\n\nCRMP5 Expression in Schwann Cells Is Regulated by Axonal Signals\n\nWe identified NRG1 type 1 as a dose-dependent signal that induces CRMP5 expression in vitro. NRG1 is a major axonal molecular cue controlling Schwann cell fate via Erb B receptors (42). Soluble NRG1 promotes Schwann cell commitment of progenitors and induces proliferation, migration, and survival of immature Schwann cells (30), whereas NRG1 Type III is a crucial regulator of myelin thickness (43, 44). We also found that cAMP, which mimics axonal contact and induces a myelinating Schwann cell phenotype (25, 45–47), negatively controlled CRMP5 expression because the cAMP enhancer forskolin inhibited CRMP5 expression in Schwann cells while promoting MBP expression. The similar down-regulation of CRMP4 by forskolin (48) indicates that other CRMPs may be involved in the regulation of myelination.\n\nCRMP5 Is Involved in Remak Cell Extension\n\nCollapsin response mediator proteins including CRMP5 are involved in axon morphogenesis during elongation and growth cone collapse, as well as in dendrite formation (7, 11, 19, 49–53). In this study, we examined the involvement of CRMP5 in morphologic changes of both Remak and myelinating Schwann cells, a prerequisite for their maturation, segregation, and wrapping of axons (26). In vitro, CRMP5−/− Schwann cells produced a reduced number of processes with less branching, whereas CRMP5 overexpression affected Schwann cell morphology by severely inhibiting cytoplasmic extension and favoring the formation of multiple short branching. Together, these results indicate that CRMP5 promotes the formation and ramification of Schwann cell processes. Collapsin response mediator protein 5 is also involved in the inhibition of process extension in oligodendrocytes (16) and in neurons. It has recently been shown to interact with MAP2 and CRMP2 to inhibit neurite outgrowth (19). All of this indicates that CRMP5 plays a role in both neuron and glial cells in the control of process extension and ramification but the role varies with the cell categories studied, probably because of different partner proteins. In Remak cells, cell extension and ramification is a necessary step to form troughs in which unmyelinated axons engage. We confirmed this idea in CRMP5−/− mice. Indeed, Remak cells in adult CRMP5−/− mice contained fewer axons, with a higher proportion of cells harboring 1 or 2 nerve fibers compared with WT mice and a reduction of those containing a large number of axons. These findings might be explained by a defective cytoplasmic extension and ramification during axon segregation resulting in a reduced ability to engulf a normal number of unmyelinated axons.\n\nCRMP5 and Myelination\n\nMyelinated fibers in CRMP5−/− mice show a deviation of axon diameter toward larger sizes. Explaining this finding requires further specific work, but it is well known that neurofilaments play a major role in the regulation of axon diameter (54). At present, there is no known interaction between CRMPs and neurofilament subunits, but CRMP2 and CRMP5 have been shown to interact with microtubule assembly, which may therefore alter neurofilament transport and eventually modify the axonal diameter (19, 55). Despite an increased axon diameter, CRMP5−/− mice wholly exhibit normal myelination, that is, the g ratio was similar to that of WT mice. This indicates that CRMP5 is not a limiting factor for myelination, although it is expressed in a subpopulation of premyelinating and myelinating Schwann cells during nerve maturation and regeneration. Myelination in the postnatal period is a protracted process that first involves large fibers, whereas small fibers may be still myelinating 20 days after birth (56), which may explain the persistence of Schwann cells expressing CRMP5 at P17. However, CRMP5 expression persists in some Schwann cells at P30 and even later (data not shown). At present, it is not known if CRMP5 expression in these cells is a dynamic phenomenon by which it is transiently produced and then disappears or if it is a stable process that involves a subpopulation of Schwann cells thereby conferring specific properties to these cells.\n\nInterestingly, in adult CRMP5−/− mice, a subpopulation of MFs displays abnormal myelination with formation of polyaxonal myelination. This points to a developmental failure that allows myelin to be formed around the axons before they are correctly segregated from each other and suggests perturbations in the ability to establish a correct 1:1 axon-Schwann cell relationship in CRMP5−/− mice, in keeping with what is observed in nonmyelinating fibers.\n\nCRMP5 and Human Peripheral Neuropathy\n\nPeripheral neuropathy is the most frequent neurologic manifestation in patients with anti-CV2/CRMP5 antibodies (3) and the serum of these patients gives the same pattern of immunoreactivity in rat (as shown here) and in human nerve (2). Clinically, this neuropathy is sensory or sensory-motor and predominates in the lower limbs. The electrophysiologic pattern is mixed, axonal, and demyelinating, although the reduction of conduction velocities never reaches the values observed in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathies (2). From the pathologic point of view, fiber loss affects both unmyelinated and MFs. Axonal sprouting in some patients indicates distal regeneration, and myelin changes, including demyelinating fibers, thin myelin sheaths, and onion bulb formations, are frequent (2). Inflammatory cells are scarcely seen. The pattern of expression of CRMP5 in the adult nerve, mostly in Remak cells, may apparently be at odds with the pathologic findings of a myelin lesion, but the presence of CRMP5 in some myelinating Schwann cells may make them targets of the immune system and lead to demyelination. Even if a small proportion of Schwann cells do express CRMP5 at a given time, their even distribution along MFs might eventually result in a significant proportion of demyelinated axons with a multifocal distribution and explain the mild demyelinating changes observed in the patients. Because CRMP5 is expressed in nonmyelinated fibers whatever their diameter is, axons may also be involved in this process, and a specific analysis of small fibers on skin biopsy and pain sensitivity would be required in patients.\n\nReferences\n\nAuthor notes\n\n© 2012, by the American Association of Neuropathologists, Inc."
