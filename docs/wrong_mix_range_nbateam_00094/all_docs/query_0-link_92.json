        "text": "This is a surprising level of specificity from Bibby on the culprit, also interesting in that former players usually have terrible memories on actual specifics, dates, and stats, but Bibby looks to be very accurate in his recall.\n\nBibby said he was stolen from while on the 2011 - 2012 Knicks, and it happened while they were visiting Chicago and were playing in Milwaukee the next night. That narrows it down to the April 10th, 2012 game.\n\nHe also mentions it was a young player, whom no one else on the team liked to roll with. On that team, there's one clear person who obviously fits that description:\n\nJeremy Lin, with the unmarked Envelope, in the teammate's hotel room! Case Closed...\n\nIn all seriousness though, as much as I would have also liked it to be current Atlanta Hawks GM Landry Fields (who just decided to steal Toronto's money in RFA), seems obvious it was Henry \"Bill\" Walker, former high school phenom who was a teammate and best friend of OJ Mayo. Was seen as a generational talent, with Vince Carter-esque athleticism, but was also dogged with eligibility concerns at the NCAA level, and tore his ACL twice, making him go from a surefire top 5 pick one-and-done to a second round pick who never got traction in the league. He was cut from the Knicks on April 20th, with 4 games left to go in the regular season, and then didn't play in the NBA for two years."
