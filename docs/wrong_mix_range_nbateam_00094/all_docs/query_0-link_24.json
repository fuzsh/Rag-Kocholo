Mandatory Credit: Vincent Carchietta-USA TODAY Sports\n\nMike Miller may not be the go-to scorer, but it’s important to recognize that he can still burn teams from deep; he is not just a mentor for the Denver Nuggets.\n\nMike Miller’s best years are behind him, but that doesn’t mean he can’t have a positive role on a team. Miller is the “wise old man,” of the Nuggets and provides great mentor-ship to the young players.\n\nWhile Miller may not get heavy minutes anymore, he is still a feared dead-eye shooter. Miller is a solid asset for Denver and can serve as the old veteran that keeps the young guns in check when they get out of hand, ala Kevin Garnett in his final years.\n\nJust to clarify, I’m not saying Mike Miller is as good as Garnett, I’m saying their roles are very similar past their prime.\n\nWant your voice heard? Join the Nugg Love team!\n\nWhile fans won’t see much of Mike Miller this year, he will be a vital of part of the team. Even though he is well past his prime, players should not sleep on Mike Miller and fans should not take him for granted.\n\nJan 25, 2016; Denver, CO, USA; Denver Nuggets guard Mike Miller (3) dribbles the ball against Atlanta Hawks forward Mike Scott (32) in the fourth quarter at the Pepsi Center.

Downing-USA TODAY Sports\n\nMiller saw a drastic decrease on much of his production last year\n\nMike Miller’s prime is well behind him. He barely got into the rotation last year, and we did not get to see much of Miller as some fans would’ve liked.\n\nHis average win shares from last season of 0.3 is nowhere near his career average of 60.7. Although, he still did maintain efficient shooting percentages.\n\nMore from Nugg Love\n\nMiller still shot an effective field goal percentage of 50.8% and shot 36% from deep. While his 35% shooting is nowhere near what he is accustomed to, it is vital to keep in mind that he did not get in much at all last year which means there were less opportunities for him.\n\nMiller only received a combined 62 field goal attempts which is drastically reduced when compared to the 2011-12 season when he played with Miami. In this year, when the Heat took the title by the way, Miller shot a combined 209 field goal attempts.\n\nThis proves he does not carry the same role he once did in his career. You may be wondering where I am going with all this and the point is that Miller is not going to be the star of the team. He is here to provide mentor-ship and clutch shooting whenever the team needs it.\n\nMiller is not going to be the Sixth Man of the Year like he was in 2006, but he will still have a necessary role with the Nuggets.\n\nFeb 21, 2016; Denver, CO, USA; Denver Nuggets guard Mike Miller (3) dribbles the ball against Boston Celtics forward Jonas Jerebko (8) in the fourth quarter at the Pepsi Center. The Celtics defeated the Nuggets 121-101. Mandatory Credit: Isaiah J. Downing-USA TODAY Sports\n\nMiller is nearing the end of the tunnel, but it would be unwise to believe he doesn’t have something left in the tank\n\nMiller will not see much time on the floor again this year. He is nearing the end of his successful career but he will be called on for a key score, when the Nuggets may need a shooter to send them to overtime or win in the final seconds of a game.\n\nAs eluded to already, Mike’s main role will to be provide veteran experience and expertise to the core to assist in developing the young players. He is a great mentor for anyone who may need help, particularly with shooting.\n\nKeep in mind he assisted Mudiay with his jump-shot last year and that had something to do with Mudiay’s field goal percentage rising after the All-Star Break.\n\nWhile we may not get to see much of the 3-point marksmen, it is important to realize he will have a big impact in the locker room and behind the scenes.\n\nThis article originally appeared on"
