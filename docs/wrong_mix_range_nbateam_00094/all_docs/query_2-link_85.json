        "text": "“LeBron thought it was an unnecessary change,” Miller revealed. “I’m not saying I would have been a difference-maker. San Antonio was unbelievable last year and there are a lot of things that go into a season, but it was difficult for LeBron.\n\n“It was difficult for all of us. It was difficult for me. I had to uproot my family and move again. It was tough. I think he was disappointed because he understands legacies and he understands what he wants to do in life. That’s what makes him special.”\n\n“It was a tough pill to swallow for both of us,” Miller said. “That team went through a lot. The same thing this team is hoping to go through. You’re going to have ups and downs and you grow close. For me, I had a great relationship with LeBron and still have. It was extremely difficult. […] But it also meant a lot to me to see how much they cared, specifically LeBron and those guys, that I meant so much to them. Because at the end of the day, all you have are your teammates.”"
