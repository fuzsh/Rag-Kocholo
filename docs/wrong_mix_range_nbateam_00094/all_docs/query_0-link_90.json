        "text": "The Houston Rockets got themselves a stud in Reed Sheppard, the player they selected using the No. 3 overall pick during the 2024 NBA Draft, as he has emerged as one of the best players in the Summer League thus far.\n\nThe former Kentucky Wildcat has been so good that he has gotten a seal of approval from Mark Price, a four-time NBA All-Star and a Cleveland Cavaliers legend.\n\n‚ÄúI just watched some highlights of @reed_sheppard at @NBASummerLeague! He sure reminds me of a former NBA all-star üòÄ This young man has a bright future!‚Äù Price posted on his X (formerly known as Twitter).\n\nPrice is not the only fan of Reed Sheppard, as Atlanta Hawks‚Äô Trae Young called him a nice player while his Houston Rockets teammates like what they‚Äôre seeing from him.\n\n‚ÄúHe‚Äôs really good. I don‚Äôt even know what to say. He‚Äôs a guy that makes all the right plays. He‚Äôs a really good passer and can shoot it and defend. I‚Äôm excited,‚Äù Amen Thompson said about Sheppard via Yahoo Sports.\n\nReed Sheppard is poised for a big year with the Houston Rockets\n\nReed Sheppard is averaging 20.0 points, 4.7 rebounds, 4.7 assists, and 3.0 steals while shooting 49 percent from the field and 38.5 percent from three-point land in three Summer League games.\n\nWith how he‚Äôs been playing, Sheppard should contribute for the Houston Rockets next season, especially on offense, since they were ranked 13th in the 2023-24 season with 114.3 points per contest.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm really just taking what‚Äôs given to me at each play. It‚Äôs about making the right basketball play. If I‚Äôm the one open, shoot it. If I‚Äôm not, attack and get someone else open. I‚Äôm just trusting my teammates and making all the right basketball plays,‚Äù Sheppard said."
