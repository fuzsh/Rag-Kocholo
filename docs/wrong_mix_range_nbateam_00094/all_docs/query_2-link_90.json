        "text": "The slender shooter from South Dakota – nicknamed “Skinny” – picked upstart Florida over all the interested national powers, including Duke, Kentucky and North Carolina.\n\nBut people were most surprised that Mike Miller didn’t go to Kansas. KU had the noted basketball tradition and Lawrence seemed to be the environment that jived most with Miller’s laid-back, country personality. But he instead chose sunny Gainesville and a Florida program in rebuild mode.\n\nJayhawks coach Roy Williams was so perturbed by the decision he accused Florida of recruiting violations and publicly challenged new Gators coach Billy Donovan, whose legend was just starting to explode onto the college basketball landscape.\n\nAn ensuing 10-month investigation came up clean. Florida was cleared of any wrongdoing. Miller went with the Gators because he clicked with Donovan and believed in what the young coach was building.\n\nMore than 15 years later, Miller has no regrets. He was Donovan’s first big recruit at Florida and was leader of the first of his four Final Four teams. And, deeper than the success, he has maintained an extremely close connection with a coach he has called one of his best friends.\n\nThese days, Miller is in the midst of his fourth NBA Finals appearance, coming off the bench for the Cavaliers. But before Game 2 out in Oakland, Miller sat down with The Oklahoman for an extended interview about the Thunder’s new coach.\n\nDuring the hiring process, Kevin Durant reached out to Miller to get a better gauge on Donovan. Among other things, Miller reveals what he told Durant.\n\nSo Donovan plucked you out of South Dakota, which surprised a lot of people at the time. What was it about him?\n\nHis energy. He works hard. For me, he relates, does an unbelievable job of relating to his players and communicating with them, which is why I think he’ll transfer great into this league. It made the decision really easy for me, even if it was a football school at the time. Still is. It wasn’t even on the map for basketball at the time.\n\nWe’re talking about a young Billy Donovan at the time.\n\nI always pride myself on being a hard-worker. That’s how I got to where I am and how I got to where I was then. I like guys who put that time in. For him, it was him and his staff outworking everyone at that time.\n\nI read that they would follow your South Dakota teams everywhere you went.\n\nThey were fortunate enough to have a pretty good recruiting class already compiled at the time. And they put a lot of effort and time into me and showed that commitment. It really made the decision easy.\n\nWhen you got there, what kind of coach was he and how quickly did you click with him?\n\nGreat. He became like a father figure because I was so far away. The relationship part was easy and that’s why I think he transfers good (to the NBA). In this league, it’s about putting your players in the best position to be successful and communication. I think he’ll do both of those. They use the term player’s coach a lot and he really is. In this league, it’s a player’s league.\n\nYou say player’s coach, what does that mean with him?\n\nHe just puts the players first. Everything we did was players first. It’s the small things, the details and at the end of the day, he realizes he’s only as good as his players. So he does a great job of making sure everyone is taken care of and he puts the time on the court with them, growing them. Big on player development stuff.\n\nHumble, too, from what I’ve heard.\n\nVery humble. He understands the situation, where he’s at, what he’s been able to accomplish. It’s been a good ride. We’re definitely going to miss him at UF, but I think he’ll do a great job.\n\nI’m assuming he stayed up with your personal life.\n\nHe was always into everything. He realized that I came from South Dakota, which was a long way away. So I relied on him a lot. The coaching staff and players were all I had.\n\nWas there anything in particular you remember him doing?\n\nHe’d always set up weekly meetings with me. Just checking in, where you at and how are you doing. That was big for me because I’m big into communication between coaches and players. Tell me where I stand and what I need to do. He’s great with that.\n\nKevin said he reached out to you when there was rumblings that Donovan was close to being hired. What did you tell Kevin?\n\nBasically the same stuff. Just told Kevin that he’d enjoy Coach. He has a great demeanor for the game. For me, that’s huge, especially at this level. He’ll have a lot more time to just focus on basketball, doesn’t have to recruit and those outside basketball obligations. But he’ll be prepared. He has the Van Gundy, Pitino type preparation, but at the same time is great with communication.\n\nYou stay in contact with him?\n\nBilly? Oh yeah. He’s one of the reasons I’m here.\n\nI read a quote from you that was around the time you got drafted. You called Donovan ‘one of your best friends.’\n\nYeah. He really is. We went through a lot. When you’re 17 and you go to a university like that, going across the country, your family and your parents have to have a lot of trust in him. And the players do, too. You’re ultimately trusting them to take you where you want to go, to the NBA. So when you leave, you’re ultimately putting your trust in one guy or one staff, which he had a great staff. You come to have a pretty good relationship with a guy you have that much mutual trust.\n\nSounds like you’ve leaned on him for advice over the years. How about when he was deciding on this job. Did you talk to him?\n\nYep. Oh yeah. We talked about it. And to me, when the OKC job opened up, we started talking and my thing was if your main goal is to coach in the NBA, you sprint to this job. Because you get a roster that’s great, two stars in Russ and KD. I don’t know Russ personally, but KD is a player you won’t see come around very often, as far as how he is as a player and as a person. So it’s a great opportunity for him.\n\nHow about his transition from a schematic standpoint? He already runs a spread pick-and-roll.\n\nYeah, he runs a lot of NBA stuff now. I think you’re going to see college start doing it more. Because you are seeing these college coaches start to get looks – the Fred Hoibergs, the Kevin Ollies, the Brad Stevens, Billy. Those guys are being hybrid college-NBA coaches at the college level. That transfers. Guys that play to 30 on the clock, five seconds left, that doesn’t transfer. For Billy, obviously he’s going to have to make some adjustments. The game speeds up significantly.\n\nThere’s talk of how he’ll deal with a personality like Russell Westbrook, but he’s dealt with some personalities over his time at Florida.\n\nBut to me, Russ is one of the best competitors this league has. You may have to deal with a few things, but at least you know he’s going to play hard. Like I said, I don’t know him personally, but I just respect how he competes. And KD has an unbelievable demeanor about him. So Billy’s in a great spot.\n\nGonna be weird to go against him?\n\nWeird. Very weird. It’s gonna be even stranger seeing Florida without him on the sidelines."
