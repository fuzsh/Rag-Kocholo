        "text": "DENVER — After president Steve Mills fired David Fizdale the day after a 37-point loss to the Nuggets, Knicks brass interviewed four of the team’s assistant coaches, according to an NBA source.\n\nThey chose Mike Miller, the newest of the group, to serve as the interim for his stoic personality and his head-coaching experience, although not in the NBA.\n\nSo far, so good. The Knicks are 2-3 under Miller following Sunday’s impressive second-half rally against the powerhouse Nuggets that wound up a 111-105 loss in their western swing finale. The advanced stats have improved since Fizdale’s departure, but a change in coaching style may have been also needed.\n\nFizdale has been out west, too, in Los Angeles, walking his dog, according to his wife’s Instagram and thinking about what he could have done better. He was extremely close to the players. As Julius Randle said, Fizdale wanted to know them as people.\n\nRight now Miller wants to know them as basketball players for the short term.\n\n“He was just the right guy at the time,’’ one person familiar with the decision told The Post. “He’s got an unflappable demeanor and that was needed for the guys. Plus, he was the only one on the staff with a lot of head-coaching experience.’’\n\nIndeed, not only was Miller head coach of the Westchester Knicks for four seasons, compiling a solid 108-92 (.540) record and being named the 2017-18 G-League Coach of the Year. But he also spent 13 seasons as a small-college Division I head coach, not always successfully.\n\nThough Miller did well at Texas State, coming away with a winning record (87-79) and leading the Bobcats to an NCAA Tournament berth after winning the Southland Conference title in 1997, he flopped at Eastern Illinois with only one winning season in seven years. He was canned in 2012 after a 75-130 mark. When Texas State hired him in 1994 at the age of 29, he was the nation’s second-youngest NCAA head coach.\n\n“We had a lot to figure out,’’ Miller said, referring to his age when hired. “I had a lot of people that helped me get to that position. It was a lot of learning to do.”\n\nAs is his custom, Miller said he was reluctant to talk about himself. After getting ousted at Eastern Illinois, Miller spent a year as an assistant at UC-Riverside before leaping to the pros as an assistant coach for the G-League Austin Spurs in 2013. That led to getting the top job at Westchester in 2015, hired by Phil Jackson.\n\n“It was the right time,’’ Miller said of leaving college for a pro job. “Moving through, it was the perfect time to do it.’’"
