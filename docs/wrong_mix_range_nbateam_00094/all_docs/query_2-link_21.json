        "text": "If you watched the Creighton men’s basketball team defeat Akron in the first round of the 2024 NCAA tournament, you got to watch the son of an NBA legend in action.\n\nMason Miller, a sophomore forward for Creighton, is the son of former NBA player Mike Miller, a 17-year retired veteran who won two NBA titles with the Miami Heat in 2012 and 2013.\n\nThe elder Miller played college ball at Florida before being drafted by the Orlando Magic in 2000. He coached Houston High School in Germantown, Tennessee, to a TSAA Class AAA state title in his only season as a coach, where Mason Miller played for his dad before joining Creighton.\n\nNow, the younger Miller will keep playing on in the 2024 men’s NCAA tournament with Creighton, where he scored 10 points for the Bluejays in that team’s opening-round victory.\n\n*This post previously stated that Mike Miller was still the coach of Houston High. He left after the 2020-21 season."
