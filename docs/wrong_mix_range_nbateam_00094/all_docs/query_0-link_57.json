Eddie first played college basketball at Temple University and was the 1993–94 Atlantic 10 Player of the Year. Eddie Jones eventually led the Owls to the Elite 8 in the NCAA tournament.\n\nThe three-time NBA All-Star was selected 10th overall in the 1994 NBA draft by the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nEric Gordon\n\nThree-pointers made: 1,549 Three-pointers attempted: 4,186 Three-point percentage: 37% Eric Gordon played one season of college basketball at Indiana and was considered one of the top collegiate players in the nation that year. He finished his freshman season leading the Big Ten in scoring and tied for 19th in the country at 21.5 points per game.\n\nEric entered the 2008 NBA draft and was picked seventh overall by the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nPaul George\n\nThree-pointers made: 1,566 Three-pointers attempted: 4,124 Three-point percentage: 37.9% Paul George was selected by the Indiana Pacers with the 10th overall pick of the 2010 NBA draft and earned NBA All-Rookie Second Team honors. Paul George was named the NBA Most Improved Player back in 2013 when he also received his first All-Star selection. In addition to his athleticism, he has cultivated a reputation as a high-flyer by participating in the 2012 and 2014 Slam Dunk Contest.\n\nAfter the Pacers' win over the Denver Nuggets on February 10, 2014, their teams head coach Brian Shaw called George \"the best two-way player in the game.\"\n\nKevin Durant\n\nThree-pointers made:1,570 Three-pointers attempted: 4,122 Three-point percentage: 38.1% With a scoring average of 28.1 points per game to finish the 2012–13 season, Durant failed to defend his scoring title; however, he did become the youngest player in NBA history to join the 50–40–90 club.\n\nFinishing the year with a 60–22 record, Oklahoma City earned the first seed in the Western Conference.\n\nJason Richardson\n\nThree-pointers made: 2,282 Three-pointers attempted: 6, 010 Three-point percentage: 37.9% During his time with the Golden State, Jason Richardson gained popularity for his outstanding scoring, ability to dunk, dedication to the team and fans, and moral uprightness. As the long time captain of the Warriors, Jason Richardson organized a letter of apology to their fans in 2005 after his team failed to make the playoffs for the 12th straight season.\n\nEven after Jason left the Golden State, he has remained one of the most popular players among Warrior fans because of his energetic style of play and ability to shoot three-pointers, as well as the longevity of his tenure with the team.\n\nWesley Matthews\n\nThree-pointers made: 1,608 Three-pointers attempted: 4,344 Three-point percentage: 37% Wesley Matthews was the biggest of the \"three amigos,\" the three guards in the starting lineup for Marquette. This trio, Dominic James, Jerel McNeal, and Wesley Matthews, started nearly every game together from their first year onwards.\n\nWith his lack of height in the 2008–2009 season, Matthews learned to play against bigger opponents and became one of the most dominant players in the nation throwing to the basket.\n\nRashard Lewis\n\nThree-pointers made: 1,787 Three-pointers attempted: 4,625 Three-point percentage: 38.6% Rashard Lewis joined the NBA directly from Alief Elsik High School. He rose to renown in the NBA as a prime scorer with the Seattle SuperSonics and was later a member of the Orlando Magic, Washington Wizards, and even Miami Heat.\n\nRashard Lewis earned two NBA All-Star selections, one with Seattle and another with Orlando, and he also reached the NBA Finals three times, winning an NBA championship in 2013 as a member of the Heat.\n\nKyle Lowry\n\nThree-pointers made: 1,685 Three-pointers attempted: 4,602 Three-point percentage: 36.6% Kyle played college basketball for the Villanova Wildcats before the Memphis Grizzlies selected him in the first round of the 2006 NBA draft. Kyle Lowry began his NBA career with Memphis and the Houston Rockets before being traded to Toronto.\n\nIn Kyle Lowry's second season with the Raptors, he helped them enter the playoffs for the first time in seven years and win an Atlantic Division title during the 2013–14 season.\n\nKobe Bryant\n\nThree-pointers made: 1,827 Three-pointer attempted: 5,546 Three-point percentage: 32.9% Kobe Bryant is the all-time leading scorer in Lakers franchise history, and he was also the first guard in NBA history to play at least 20 seasons. His 18 All-Star designations are the second-most of all-time, while it is the record for most back-to-back appearances as a starter.\n\nKobe Bryant's four All-Star MVP Awards are equaled to that of Bob Pettit for the most in NBA history.\n\nLeBron James\n\nThree-pointers made: 1,860 Three-pointers attempted: 5,409 Three-point percentage: 34.3% LeBron was named the 2003–04 Rookie of the Year for the NBA, and pretty soon, he established himself as one of the league's best players, winning the NBA MVP Award in 2009 and again in 2010.\n\nAfter failing to win a championship with Cleveland, LeBron James left in 2010 to sign as a free agent with Miami.\n\nJoe Johnson\n\nThree-pointers made: 1,978 Three-pointers attempted: 5,331 Three-point percentage: 37.1% Joe Johnson is a seven-time NBA All-Star and has also played for many teams, including the Phoenix Suns, Brooklyn Nets, Atlanta Hawks, Miami Heat, and Utah Jazz while having also represented the national US team.\n\nJoe is also one of 46 NBA players to score 20,000 career points, and while he played for the Atlanta Hawks, he earned the nickname \"Iso Joe\" for his skills in isolation plays.\n\nJason Kidd\n\nThree-pointers made: 1,988 Three-pointers attempted: 5,701 Three-point percentage: 34.8% Jason Kidd's ability to pass and rebound made him a proper triple-double threat and when he retired, he ranked third all-time in the NBA for regular-season triple-doubles with a career total of 107 and third in playoff triple-doubles with a career total of 11.\n\nJason Kidd ranks second on the NBA all-time lists in career assists and steals and ninth in 3-point field goals made.\n\nPaul Pierce\n\nThree-pointers made: 2,143 Three-pointers attempted: 5,816 Three-point percentage: 36.8% Following his selection to the Boston Celtics with the 10th overall pick in the 1998 NBA draft, Pierce spent the first 15 years of his career with Boston. Pierce's nickname, \"the Truth,\" was given to him by Shaquille O'Neal. Paul starred as the captain of the Celtics, earning 10 All-Star selections and becoming a four-time All-NBA team member.\n\nPaul Pierce combined with Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen in 2007 to form a \"Big Three\" that led Boston to two NBA Finals and an NBA championship in 2008.\n\nJamal Crawford\n\nThree-pointers made: 2,220 Three-pointers attempted: 6,377 Three-point percentage: 37.9% Jamal Crawford played for the Chicago Bulls, New York Knicks, Golden State Warriors, Atlanta Hawks, Portland Trail Blazers, Los Angeles Clippers, Minnesota Timberwolves, and Phoenix Suns.\n\nJamal Crawford is regarded as one of the best ball handlers in NBA history, and he is, along with Lou Williams, the only three-time NBA Sixth Man of the Year winner.\n\nJason Terry\n\nThree-pointers made: 2,282 Three-pointers attempted: 6, 010 Three-point percentage: 37.9% Jason Terry played 19 seasons in the NBA and was a combo guard earning him the nickname \"The Jet.\" With the Dallas Mavericks, he won the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award in 2009 and an NBA championship in 2011.\n\nAs of March 2020, Jason Terry has made the seventh-most three-point field goals in NBA history.\n\nVince Carter\n\nThree-pointers made: 2,290 Three-pointers attempted: 6, 168 Three-point percentage: 35.36% Vince Carter started off as a high school McDonald's All-American, Vince played college basketball with the North Carolina Tar Heels and twice he advanced to the Final Four of the NCAA Tournament. Vince Carter was selected with the fifth overall pick in the 1998 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors, who then traded Carter to the Toronto Raptors.\n\nVince Carter rose as a star in Toronto as he won the 1999 NBA Rookie of the Year Award and the Slam Dunk Contest at the 2000 NBA All-Star Weekend.\n\nJames Harden\n\nThree-pointers made: 2,310 Three-pointers attempted: 6, 359 Three-point percentage: 36.3% James became one of the NBA's most prolific scorers and earned fame as one of the best shooting guards in the NBA, as well as a top-tier player in the league.\n\nWith James Harden's help, Oklahoma City Thunder reached the NBA Finals, and he was once named the NBA Sixth Man of the Year.\n\nStephen Curry\n\nThree-pointers made: 2,129 (7th all-time) Three-pointers attempted: 4,880 Three-point percentage: 43.6% The number one spot on this list is sure to create controversy. While some think it is too soon to give Stephen Curry the top spot, others think it dishonors the amazing shooters that came before him. The stats, however, are impossible to dispute, and they don’t care about historical implications or sentiments. In the end, Curry has made more three-pointers than anyone else in history, and his runner up isn’t even nipping at his heels. During his historic 2016 season, Curry made just over five threes a game.\n\nIf we compare, Reggie Miller never averaged three three-pointers per game over an entire season. Curry made 688 threes combined in 2015 and 2016, which is more than Bird made in his entire 13-year career (649). There may be plenty of criticism about the game of basketball in 2020, or opinions about the players who surround Curry, but his skill is impossible to ignore. Curry is a force of nature the likes of which we have never seen and may never see again, so in the meantime, just enjoy the show.\n\nRay Allen\n\nThree-pointers made: 2,973 (1st all-time) Three-pointers attempted: 7,429 Three-point percentage: 40.0% Not only was Allen number 1 of all-time in three-pointers made, but he also dominated the court in all other areas as well, from defending top perimeter players to finishing around the basket in traffic. His skills as an all-around player, however, were not as impressive as his unforgettable jump shot. Any random search of his name will result in many clutch threes that he performed during his career.\n\nAllen’s most memorable play was, without a doubt, the three points he scored that sent Game 6 of the 2014 NBA Finals into overtime. That one throw is an accurate representation of his incredible career.\n\nReggie Miller\n\nThree-pointers made: 2,560 (2nd all-time) Three-pointers attempted: 6,486 Three-point percentage: 39.5% When the game was on the line, Reggie Miller almost always seemed like the one to turn to. He was one of the league’s best clutch shooters of all times, even though his jump-shot is never going to appear in a how-to video. He is known for his flared out elbow, his strange landing positions, and his release, which seemed like he was letting go with both hands.\n\nStylistic differences aside, there’s no doubt he made it work. In the impressive spot of No. 2 all-time for three-pointers made, Miller based his entire career on making big-time shots from the outside.\n\nSteve Nash\n\nThree-pointers made: 1,685 (18th all-time) Three-pointers attempted: 3,939 Three-point percentage: 42.8% One of the leading members of the 50-40-90 club, Steve Nash, is undoubtedly on top when it comes to all-around shooters. Nash is just as good from the free-throw line as he is behind the arc. He was a good scorer, who didn’t get the acknowledgment he deserved because his skills overpowered his shooting as a playmaker.\n\nNash was always among the league leaders in three-point shooting percentage and built his career using his excellent vision and unbelievable ability to shoot the ball. No wonder he was recently inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nPeja Stojaković\n\nThree-pointers made: 1,760 (16th all-time) Three-pointers attempted: 4,392 Three-point percentage: 40.1% Another Croatian to make the list is 6-foot-9 Peja Stojaković, who also proves that Central Europe knows how to make some amazing shooters. Stojaković started out in Sacramento, and his talent for three-point shots was immediately evident. He excelled at foul shooting, doing so automatically from inside the line, and he was also deadly accurate from the arc.\n\nStojaković's time with the Kings has changed the way teams have seen wing players. His style of playing basketball would have actually been a perfect fit for today’s games.\n\nDražen Petrović\n\nThree-pointers made: 255 Three-pointers attempted: 583 Three-point percentage: 43.7% Dražen Petrović could have potentially held every three-point record the NBA has, but his career tragically ended in a car crash when he was just 28. Considered the best European basketball player in history, Petrović paved the way for other international players to join the NBA. His two seasons with the nets allowed him to show off his skills to the league and the world.\n\nHe even caught the eye of basketball legend Reggie Miller, who has repeatedly stated that Petrović was the best shooter he's ever faced. That is a pretty big compliment from one of the best shooters who has ever lived.\n\nKlay Thompson\n\nThree-pointers made: 1,557 (24th all-time) Three-pointers attempted: 3,691 Three-point percentage: 42.2% The other “Splash Brother” does not always get the recognition he deserves, but when he is shooting from the outside, he still provides an incredible show. Thompson is known for his perfect release, which has led him to some truly unforgettable moments, including a 60-point performance against the Pacers in 2016 and a 37-point third-quarter outburst against the Kings in 2015.\n\nThompson can come off screens or shoot off the bounce and doesn’t usually have to set his feet to make a good shot. He even manages to do all that and still defend against the rival team’s best perimeter player, which makes Klay a top contender for one of the top five places on this list before he retires.\n\nKyle Korver\n\nThree-pointers made: 2,213 (4th all-time) Three-pointers attempted: 5,130 Three-point percentage: 43.1% Unlike most basketball players, time seems not to affect Kyle Korver, and he just keeps getting better and better. He has been beating teams from the outside for over ten years, and it doesn’t look like he’s going anywhere anytime soon.\n\nKorver is known for his efficiency, with a career standing of 43 percent clip from behind the line. Although he began playing in the NBA in 2003, his breakout season in 2015 had him hitting 221 threes with an incredible 49 percent clip. Many believe that it will be impossible to reach those numbers again.\n\nDale Ellis\n\nThree-pointers made: 1,719 (17th all-time) Three-pointers attempted: 4,266 Three-point percentage: 40.3% Many believe that he was the most excellent pure shooter of the 80s, it was almost impossible to defend Dale Ellis on the perimeter. Lightning-quick reflexes and a high release point, helped Ellis reach a total of over 1,700 three-pointers.\n\nHis greatest season took place in 1989, in which he converted 162 threes at just under a 48 percent clip. That season is still incredible, even when compared to the biggest players who have been around since.\n\nJ.J. Redick\n\nThree-pointers made: 1,464 (30th all-time) Three-pointers attempted: 3,524 Three-point percentage: 41.5% J.J Redick made a name for himself and won over a lot of fans when he was playing for the Blue Devils. He had a rough start in the NBA in Orlando, but soon adapted and became one of the best shooters around. His shots are textbook examples of perfection and should be used as an inspiration for young players everywhere.\n\nHowever, what makes Redick unique are his skills off the ball, which are extremely important for all expert shooters. J.J. Redick has used his incredible stamina, quick moves, and a fantastic range to create an extraordinary career and legacy for himself.\n\nGlen Rice\n\nThree-pointers made: 1,559 (23rd all-time) Three-pointers attempted: 3,896 Three-point percentage: 40.0% During his time with the University of Michigan Wolverines, Rice became the school’s all-time scorer and scored a record-setting 184 points in tournament play, a record which he still holds. When he moved on to the NBA, he was the premier outside shooter for most of his career.\n\nHis 6-foot-8 frame helped him get good looks over shorter defenders, and his high release made him extremely difficult to block. He was a trailblazer for the new kind of three-point focused basketball currently being played, showcasing just how well it works on the court. Rice is currently ranked 23rd all-time in three-pointers, mostly behind players that came after him.\n\nLarry Bird\n\nThree-pointers made: 649 Three-pointers attempted: 1,727 Three-point percentage: 37.6% Basketball legend and one of the game’s all-time greats, Larry Bird, was good at every aspect of the game, but also at shooting. Famous for his unorthodox form, Bird was an almost impossible match-up due to his incredible outside game.\n\nAs a three-time Three-Point Contest consecutive champion and with numerous clutch threes, Larry Bird will probably remain on this list for at least the next hundred years.\n\nSteve Kerr\n\nThree-pointers made: 726 Three-pointers attempted: 1,599 Three-point percentage: 45.4% The three-point percentage leader of all-time, Steve Kerr, was often in the right place and the right time and used his superior shooting skills to make a name for himself.\n\nHe shared the court with basketball legends such as Michael Jordan, Tim Duncan, and Scottie Pippen, which was perfect for him because, despite his smaller build, he was more of an off-guard than a point guard. With numerous seasons in which he shot more than 50 percent from the three-point line, Kerr was instrumental in five distinct NBA title runs.\n\nCraig Hodges\n\nThree-pointers made: 563 Three-pointers attempted: 1,408 Three-point percentage: 40.0% Craig Hodges is tied with Larry Bird as one of only two players in NBA history to have ever won three consecutive Three-Point Contests. He is perhaps the most overlooked shooter in recent times and led the league in 3-point shooting percentage three times.\n\nThis not so tall player was not just good in competitions, he also played well on the court, with a solid 40 percent from the outside throughout his career. He may not have made quite as many points as others on this list, but a three-peat in a contest that includes the NBA’s best shooters has rightfully earned him his spot.\n\nMark Price\n\nThree-pointers made: 976 Three-pointers attempted: 2,428 Three-point percentage: 40.2% Legendary Cleveland point guard Mark Price lit up plenty of scoreboards in his impressive career. He paved the way for guards that could fill up stat sheets in more than one way, and that was due to the threat of his outside shot.\n\nThe numbers may not look as impressive as what we are used to today, but for those days, Price was hoisting a high-volume of three-point shots and converting on a comparably efficient clip. In addition, Price was one of the greatest free-throw shooters in NBA history and could sink the ball from any spot on the court.\n\nChris Mullin\n\nThree-pointers made: 815 Three-pointers attempted: 2,120 Three-point percentage: 38.4% No one can dispute Richmond’s talents, but he was not even believed to be the best shooter in the renowned Run-TMC trio. That honor goes to Chris Mullin and a left-handed shooting machine that was known for getting his shot off whenever he wanted.\n\nMullin’s lightning-quick release and deep range made guarding him an extremely tough task.
