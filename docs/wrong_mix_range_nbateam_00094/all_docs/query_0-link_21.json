        "text": "For two days each December, Mitchell and South Dakota are home to some of the best players and teams in the country.\n\nThis year's event featured the No. 1 point guard Trevon Duval, No. 1 team La Lumiere (Indiana) and a number of other future college basketball stars.\n\nAnd when you survey the basketball landscape, it's hard not to notice Mike Miller Classic alums making an impact across all levels.\n\nThis past season, Mike Miller Classic alums were also winning state championships, playing in all-star games and the NCAA national title game.\n\nThe two headliners of last season's event-IMG Academy of Florida and La Lumiere-went onto qualify for the Dick's Nationals national tournament in New York City.\n\nLa Lumiere defeated Montverde Academy (Florida) in the championship game, while IMG was upset in the first round against Greensboro Day (North Carolina).\n\nIMG star point guard Trevon Duval and La Lumiere forward Brian Bowen both played in the McDonald's All-American game in Chicago. They also both played in the Jordan Brand Classic in Brooklyn.\n\nOn the recruiting front, Duval and Bowen are both still undecided on their decisions. Duval's final five schools are Duke, Arizona, Baylor, Kansas and Seton Hall. Bowen is still deciding between Michigan State, Arizona, North Carolina State, Creighton and Texas.\n\nLa Lumiere and IMG were not the only teams that used the event as a springboard to successful 2016-17 campaigns.\n\nLocally, Bridgewater-Emery and Sioux Falls O'Gorman won Class B and Class AA state titles.\n\nThe DeLaSalle (Minnesota) Islanders won their sixth straight Class 3A state title. Also of note, DeLaSalle coach Dave Thorson was recently named an assistant coach at Drake. IMG's coach Vince Walden was also recently named an assistant coach at Arkansas State. Ex-La Lumiere coach Alan Huss, who coached at the classic in 2011-2013, was recently named an assistant coach at Creighton.\n\nSt. Anthony (Texas) sophomore Charles Bassey played in the UnderClassman All-American Game in Georgia on March 26. The 6-foot-10 power forward is ranked No. 4 in the ESPN rankings.\n\nGonzaga guard Nigel Williams-Goss played on college basketball's biggest stage on April 3 when the Bulldogs lost to North Carolina in the national title game. Williams-Goss played in the Mike Miller Classic in 2010 and 2011 with Findlay Prep (Nevada). Williams-Goss attended the University of Washington after high school.\n\nOn the NBA level, Kelly Oubre is currently playing for the Washington Wizards in the playoffs against the Atlanta Hawks. Oubre played in the Mike Miller Classic in 2013 with Findlay Prep."
