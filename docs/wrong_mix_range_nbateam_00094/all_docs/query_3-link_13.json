        "text": "I just saw that according mike miller’s dad that he is going to the heat for a 5 year $30 million deal. I think if they can get someone like brad miller to take the minimum then that would be a solid starting 5:\n\nPG – Chalmers\n\nSG – Wade\n\nSF – James\n\nPF – Bosh\n\nC – B. Miller\n\nMike miller coming off the bench to play the 2 or 3 and moving wade or James to the point and let chambers rest.\n\nAlso pick up someone like Jason Williams to back up the point\n\nA good pick up, but how can they give him that much money? They don’t have an MLE. It really depends on if they can work out another sign and trade.\n\nLooking at another post, there are some decent bigs on the market that could help fill out the team, as well as a few pg’s.\n\npossibilities:\n\nJason Williams (PG)\n\nEtan Thomas (C)\n\nUdonis Haslem (PF)\n\nMark Blount (PF/C)\n\nRafer Alston (PG)\n\nAnthony Johnson (PG)\n\nMost of these players would sign minimum deals for a chance to win a ring. I don’t think Haslem has to, because Miami owns his “Bird Rights”.\n\nStill they could use one “Combo guard” as a back up or Sixthman since they just traded Beasley away for nothing.\n\nI’m an ATL fan, so I would be ok with trading our 1st round pick (Jordan Crawford) for say Pittman and a future 1st. We could use the depth at C. And the salaries could be close with a late first and an early second."
