What are its unique artistic and cultural characteristics? What are its key movements of its evolution? Join Dr. Federico Pacchioni for the first appointment of Viaggio nel Cinema, a series of virtual talks designed to offer a broader historical context around the films and conversations of this year’s Italian Film Festival of Minneapolis / St. Paul. This first introductory talk will provide an overview of defining moments of the history of Italian cinema from its origin to today, intersecting a variety of industrial, political and artistic trends.\n\nClick here to register for this session only.

Particular attention will be given to the latter, which consists in a unique form of tragicomedy with deep cultural and theatrical roots, a genre that continues to be extremely vital and popular today. While profiling actors, directors and films that have shaped this genre, the presentation will clarify how Italian comedy has evolved during the decades and the reasons behind its continued success in Italy.\n\nClick here to register for this session only.

In addition to outlining the profiles of influential classical directors such as Federico Fellini, Luchino Visconti, Pier Paolo Pasolini, and Michelangelo Antonioni, the presentation will provide an explanation of Italian art cinema’s double nature, at once poetic and realistic. Finally, Dr. Pacchioni will address how this innovative cinematic legacy continues to find powerful expression in the work of new generations of Italian filmmakers.\n\nClick here to register for this session only.
