However, the stylistic feature of such Italian works of giallo are so different and distinguished that nowadays giallo is remembered not by the yellow-covered paperback crime book of Aghata Christie, Edgar Wallace and Raymond Chandler published in Italy, but by an array of movies directed by filmmakers like Dario Argento, Mario Bava, Sergio Martino, Pupi Avati and many more.\" Taste of Cinema",
