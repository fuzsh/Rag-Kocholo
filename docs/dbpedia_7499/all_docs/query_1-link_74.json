        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\n104Rocky Mountain Review What makes Lawler's study dear to us is the fact that the dynamic charge awakened by Lawler's poetic experience is transferred to the reader as Lawler stirs the emotions and enlightens the intellect. M. E. KRONEGGER Michigan State University CAROL LAZZARO-WEIS. From Margins to Mainstream: Feminism and Fictional Modes in Italian Women's Writing, 1968-1990. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1993. 223 p. 1 he title of this noteworthy work brings immediately to mind the purpose of the author, who wants to follow the development of Italian feminism and feminist theory from a marginal sphere, where women writers were at first relegated, to its place within traditional literature and literary genresâ€”that is, a space where women are now able \"to unmask literature's purported neutral structure and to add their vision to it\" (xv). The author indicates in the introduction that her aim is twofold: on one hand, she examines the variety of connections in the making of Italian feminism , feminist theories, and contemporary Italian women's narrative prose; on the other hand, she supplies a literary framework, in which she considers the differences among contemporary Italian women writers and how such differences are changing the Italian literary tradition \"as these women create a tradition of their own\" (xi). In the first chapter, she addresses the concept of gender and genre, noting that women can use traditional literary genres, change them according to their needs, and reach, within such structures, the inner levels \"where meanings are made\" (27). Thus, Lazzaro-Weis counters many American and French feminist theorists who affirm that women writers cannot appropriately express themselves through vehicles traditionally created and developed by men. Chapter two treats women writers who have separated themselves from literature and politics, who have isolated and alienated themselves, and who have thus limited themselves to a couple of topics: expressions of frustration over oppression and requests for equal rights from a male society. One of the reasons for their attitude may be found in the historical tension between the Italian Communist Party and intellectual women that arose when the party discussed the questione femminile only in terms of economic independence and overlooked women's oppression in the home and other social environments. From chapter three to chapter six, Lazzaro-Weis explains how many Italian feminist writers have utilized traditional genres such as the autobiographical confession, the Bildungsroman, the historical novel, and the giallo as means of furthering the feminist and female discourse. She explains that at the beginning women were more inclined to choose an Book Reviews105 intimate and personal genre, such as the autobiography, the diary, or the memoir, in which they could operate in \"an intimate yet unrestricted space ... to perform their political, psychoanalytical, and social analyses\" (65). Then she explains that women writers emerged after World War II in the historical novel of the Italian Neorealist movement in which their direct testimonies of war played a major part. Also interesting is the position of women writers in the detective novel, U giallo, which could be viewed as a potentially all male genre, but which in reality has been greatly shaped by women writers (such as Agatha Christie and others) and then used by them to express their views. In her last chapter, \"Mainstreaming,\" the author mentions a new generation of Italian women writers, as described by Marisa Rusconi, women who now produce a \"letteratura femminile\" and not \"femminista,\" thus reentering into the mainstream of Italian contemporary literature and recognizing the differences of their gender as a source of power. Italian women writers can now return to traditional literary structures from a position of force and authority, with the \"coscienza\" (the knowledge) of having the genius capable to compete with men and \"to create their own intertextual network of reinterpretation of those general literary themes\" (197). Lazzaro-Weis supports her views with an analysis derived from extensive scholarship and methodical study of current issues and documentation. She also introduces many contemporary Italian women writers, some well known and others just entering the literary arena, thus furnishing material for further studies on the subject. The book is completed with helpful notes, an extensive bibliography, and..."
