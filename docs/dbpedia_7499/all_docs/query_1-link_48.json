        "text": "Welcome to another edition of The Horror Geek Speaks. I've received a lot of great e-mail since starting to do the column here at IGN, especially from fans who are happy to see the Italian horror cinema of the '70s and '80s getting some attention. Part of the joy in doing the column is turning people on to new films – and judging from my e-mail, there's a lot of interest in Italian horror cinema. Because of that, I've written my primer on the form – a sort of guide for those of you who aren't entirely familiar with the spaghetti horror films. It's not a comprehensive guide to the field (I'm working on a book about that), but it should help those of you who've never seen an Italian film find a few that will appeal to your own tastes. A Beginner's Guide to Italian Horror Cinema\n\nEssentially, we'll be looking at two distinctly different sets of aesthetics when it comes to making horror films: the American way (which anyone who's seen a horror movie in the last twenty years is familiar with) and the European way (particularly films emanating from Italy) – which features an entirely different mindset about how to make an effective genre film when compared with their American counterparts.\n\nSo, if you don't know Michele Soavi from Chef Boyardee, or if you think Suspiria is some weird mental condition, then read on. Hopefully, you'll have at least a rudimentary understanding of the Italian horror film by the end of this article.\n\nThe Growing Popularity of Italian Horror Films in America\n\nWith the dawning of the DVD age, Italian horror (and Euro-horror in general) is more popular here than at any other time in recent memory. Companies like Anchor Bay, Synapse, and Image are all acquiring the rights to numerous Italian horror films, remastering them, and releasing them here in the United States – where many of them have never been available prior to now (except as shoddy bootlegs or pricey imports). For the savvy horror fan, this is a blessing – he knows the ins and outs of the various subgenres, knows the directors, and knows what's worth picking up and what's worth skipping over. But, how can the average horror fan, one who's spent much of his life watching films like Halloween and Friday the 13th know what's worth his time – or if Italian horror is even likely to appeal to him?\n\nWell, first off, you have to take a leap of faith and check out an Italian film. You'll never know if it's something you'll like or not until you see a few. However, the better thing to do is gain a basic understanding of the aesthetics that flavor the typical Italian genre film – then you'll be better equipped to choose a film that is likely to appeal to you and your tastes. All Italian horror films are not created equal.\n\nAesthetics – or Different Approaches to Scaring an Audience\n\nOne of the major things that sets an Italian horror film apart from its American horror film counterparts is the narrative approach.\n\nAmerican horror films place a premium on having linear narratives that a viewer can follow from beginning to end. Rare is the film that features a disjointed narrative where the audience only knows what's transpired after the climax. Jacob's Ladder is one of the few films that I can think of that has something akin to an Italian horror film's approach to the narrative construct. In that film, weird things abound, and it all comes together with the final image.\n\nMany of the best Italian films (the work of filmmakers Dario Argento, Michele Soavi, and Mario Bava, for example) never concern themselves with linear narratives. In fact, in each of the aforementioned directors' films, narrative often takes a back seat to visual style. Often, in these filmmakers' movies, the plot is disjointed, surreal and nightmare-like in its execution. Bava's Lisa and the Devil and Argento's Suspiria are both prime examples of this, featuring convoluted plots that often don't make sense – but offering up a steady stream of visual images and weird situations that continually cause the viewer to feel unsettled or even disturbed.\n\nTaking this even a step farther, the best of these films (and directors) will find a way to take even an everyday object and make it menacing and frightening (the large ceramic hand in Mario Bava's Shock, for example).\n\nThis completely un-American approach to narrative is often the one thing that turns off new viewers. When a character in Suspiria (which is set in a German dance academy) finds herself trapped in a room filled with barbed wire, many viewers give up on the film, wondering why a dance school would have a barbwire-filled room. Of course, most American genre fans willingly accept that Jason Voorhees will come back from the dead time and time again, even if you dismember him, with no major qualms – so, it's simply a matter of attuning your perceptions to a different set of aesthetics. Revel in the mood, the imagery, the atmosphere of a film like Suspiria – think of it as a nightmare and a dark fairy tale all rolled into one – and you'll be better prepared to deal with the different narrative approach.\n\nThis isn't to say every Italian film eschews linear narratives – because they don't. Nor is it to say all the films that make a mess out of the plotline in order to get intriguing visuals are good – again, because they're not. Like any kind of film viewing experience, you've got to take the movies on a case-by-case basis. However, if you're at least aware that a lot of Italian filmmakers are more interested in mood and visuals than telling a completely coherent story, then you're ahead of the game because you can make a judgment about the film based on its merits – and not condemn it for failing to be like an American horror movie.\n\nGore: Blood, Guts, and Maniacal Madmen\n\nOne of the other major differences between American horror and Italian horror is that the Italian films generally lay the gore on in large quantities. American films are often contractually bound to get at least an R rating, and the MPAA has cracked down on what you can show in an R-rated film over the last few years. This has led to an increasing number of bloodless horror flicks showing at the multiplexes over the course of the last decade or so.\n\nThe Italians apparently don't have the same hang-ups as we do, because many of the 1970s and '80s Italian horror films feature far more gore and onscreen carnage than almost anything produced in Hollywood. If you're squeamish (meaning, if you think A Nightmare on Elm Street is the goriest film ever made), then you might want to proceed with caution – certain subgenres and cycles in Italian horror cinema make Craven's film look like Romper Room.\n\nCycles – or Imitation Is the Sincerest Form of Flattery\n\nAs any knowledgeable Italian horror cinephile will tell you, genre films in Italy often run according to cycles – meaning one kind of film comes into vogue for a time, everyone and their brother tries to cash in by making a similar film, and then the market dies and the next cycle begins.\n\nNo one has ever asserted that the Italians were big on originality because most of the popular cycles start in one of two ways: 1) An Italian filmmaker makes a film that becomes extremely popular and soon his compatriots are all making similar films; and 2) Hollywood (or an American filmmaker) makes a film that becomes popular, so Italian filmmakers start churning out homegrown 'sequels' (often even using the name of the popular foreign film to create more confusion) and variations on the same theme.\n\nFor an example of the first point, one need look no further than the spate of gialli in the early 1970s that dominated the Italian film scene (more on what the gialli are in a bit). Dario Argento's first film was a giallo entitled The Bird with the Crystal Plumage. This smart horror/thriller did big business (launching Argento's career), and within months the theaters were filled with dozens of gialli, many with an animal mentioned in the title.\n\nThe cycle did eventually lose steam, but the giallo seems to be one of the few staples of Italian genre film – they're never really out of vogue.\n\nFor an example of the second point, we can look at the popular zombie film cycle that was the biggest thing in Italian horror cinema in the late 1970s and early 80s.\n\nAmerican filmmaker George Romero (with the assistance of Dario Argento) released his second zombie epic, Dawn of the Dead, in 1979. The film hit Italy around the same time (perhaps even a bit prior, since Romero had distributor and ratings problems before the U.S. release) and within months, Lucio Fulci had released his own film, Zombie (which was released as Zombi 2 in Italy, where Dawn of the Dead was re-titled Zombi). Fulci's film was designed to cash in on the success of Romero's film – and it did. It also launched a whole zombie cycle that would dominate the Italian horror scene until the latter part of the 1980s.\n\nThose are just two of the popular cycles of Italian horror – there are others, including the infamous cannibal flicks of the late '70s and early '80s, the popular clones of The Exorcist in the early and mid '70s, as well as countless knock-offs of films like Alien. It should be noted that this copycat mentality doesn't only apply to horror – any genre is fair game, including the Emmanuelle films, Rambo, and others.\n\nStill, while many Italian genre films are imitations of other films, they're often entertaining because they're so exuberant in their execution. And, not every film from Italy is a rip-off of something else – there are original films to be found.\n\nSlasher versus Giallo: A Comparative Analysis\n\nWhile the Italians are often recognized for their 'homages' to other popular films, they're also largely responsible for inspiring the entire slasher film subgenre that dominated the American horror scene from the late 1970s until the end of the 1980s.\n\nAs mentioned before, one of the mainstay cycles of Italian horror cinema is the giallo (or gialli if you're looking for the plural form). Oftentimes, American fans will see what is an Italian giallo and call it a slasher film – the two forms are very similar, and American slasher cinema was largely inspired by the gialli coming out of Italy in the '60s and '70s.\n\nGiallo is Italian for yellow, which makes sense once you know a bit about the history of these films. Gialli are the Italian equivalent of a thriller. They feature mystery stories that are filled with red-herrings, have some very elaborate murder set pieces, and often feature a villain who's mentally unbalanced or insane (and often wears a mask or hides his face). They're called gialli because many were based on popular thriller novels – books that feature lurid yellow covers in Italy. The finest examples of the form include Argento's Deep Red a.k.a. Profundo Rosso and Mario Bava's Blood and Black Lace.\n\nAnd while the films are essentially Italian thrillers, they have far more in common with early American slasher films than they do with Hollywood thrillers (many of which offer some mystery but little in the way of violent death set pieces). However, differentiating between the gialli and the slashers can be a difficult (and occasionally pointless) task – particularly in the early '80s before slasher cinema evolved.\n\nFor example, the first Friday the 13th is essentially a giallo – there are numerous violent death set pieces, a mystery concerning the identity of the killer, and when the killer is revealed she's revealed to be mentally unbalanced over the death of her son.\n\nHalloween, on the other hand, appears to be more of a slasher. The death set pieces are much more straightforward and less violent (two knifings and a strangulation), there's no mystery concerning the identity of the killer, no red herrings, and while the killer is disturbed (he escaped from a mental institution) he's also most likely more than human.\n\nHowever, from there things get far more confusing. A basic rule of thumb is that if it came out of Italy, features at least some mystery concerning who the murderer is, and the murderer is ultimately revealed to be human, you've got a giallo.\n\nAll of this became much simpler once the big three American slasher icons (Jason, Freddy, and Michael) became clearly supernatural entities. Slashers now generally feature some kind of unstoppable killer who isn't human.\n\nOkay, I can hear someone in the back yelling: 'But what about Scream?' True enough, Scream purports to be a slasher deconstruction/parody. However, it really looks a lot more like a giallo than an actual slasher film? it's got a masked killer, lots of red herrings, elaborate death sequences, mystery, and a mentally unbalanced killer. I'd stick it in the giallo camp, personally. But, as I mentioned earlier, a lot of this classification is pointless (unless you're a movie geek like me). Just being familiar with the differences in the two forms (and being aware that there are indeed two forms) is what you need to know.\n\nAnd remember – these are guidelines and general definitions – not hard and fast rules.\n\nDirectors: Auteurs and Visionaries\n\nJust a brief listing of a few directors whose names you should become acquainted with. We'll not spend a lot of time on them here since they'll pop up time and again in subsequent reviews.\n\nMario Bava – one of the earliest and most influential directors in Italian horror. Bava made countless classics, made a star of Barbara Steele, and was a major influence on Dario Argento. A fantastic visual stylist who passed away in 1980.\n\nLamberto Bava – Son of Mario Bava and protege of Dario Argento. Bava worked as an assistant on numerous films with his father and did second unit filming for Argento before helming his own films. He's not as gifted as his father, but his film Demons is a gory cult classic.\n\nDario Argento\n\nDario Argento – Perhaps the greatest Italian horror director of all time (although his recent work hasn't been up to the standards of his early films). His movies feature lush visuals, bravura camera movements, and incredible violence that often borders on beautiful. Argento has often been referred to as Italy's Hitchcock as much of his work has clearly been influenced by the master. Certain shots, themes, and situations in his work have a decidedly Hitchcockian feel to them – adding yet one more dimension to some very impressive genre films.\n\nMichele Soavi – A potential heir to Argento's throne, Soavi is the consummate visual stylist. Imagine a melding of Argento and Sam Raimi, and you get a very basic idea as to how his films look. Unfortunately, he's not directed anything since the mid '90s because he wanted to spend time with his terminally ill son. He also did second unit filming on many of Argento's films.\n\nLucio Fulci – Known and revered as the 'Godfather of Gore,' the late Fulci was a 'Jack of all trades.' He directed in many diverse genres (which included making several classic gialli) before he met with commercial success for his film Zombie. Not the most technically sound filmmaker around, but generally entertaining.\n\nRuggero Deodato – Deodato made a name for himself by being one of the more prolific filmmakers during the cannibal film cycle of the late '70s and early '80s. His graphic and violent work is revered by gore fans worldwide.\n\nJoe D'Amato – Another 'Jack of all trades,' D'Amato was an exploitation filmmaker who would work in any field that was popular at the moment. His films are violent, disturbing, and often depraved (but in a good way). He and Laura Gemser were responsible for many of the Italian Emmanuelle films. He also directed a great deal of porn – sometimes merging it with horror.\n\nUmberto Lenzi – Widely regarded as a hack, Lenzi's body of work is largely hit and miss. Quick to cash in on a hot cinematic trend, a lot of his films feature interesting ideas that are ruined by poor execution. His Man From Deep River a.k.a. Deep River Savages essentially launched the cannibal cycle of Italian cinema.\n\nKeep in mind that this is just a very basic overview – it doesn't mention guys like Sergio Martino, Bruno Mattei, and a lot of other filmmakers who were very prominent parts of the Italian scene. The above filmmakers are listed because they have a large body of work, and their films are fairly accessible for rental and purchase here in America.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThis brings my Italian horror guide to a close – it's not a completely comprehensive overview, but I hope it's a decent introduction to the style and that it piques your interest for these kinds of horror films. I've tried to point out the important elements, filmmakers, and a few movies, but invariably, something always gets left out. My apologies in advance for any oversights or omissions.\n\nBut enough blathering from me – get out there and find a few of these films. Watching a good movie is always preferable to reading about one."
