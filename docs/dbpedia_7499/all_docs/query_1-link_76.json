        "text": "From classic horror films to aestheticization in the digital age We live in an era in which any artistic manifestation receives aesthetic and conceptual influences from other fields, or from its past «I». Transversality, revision and homage have come to stay, and cinema is no stranger to this reality. While it is true that the new digital technologies allow us to revisit previous places, themes and aesthetics, but with a different result-due to the change of the means and tools used-, in the end, when we are in front of the screen, we recognize the heritage of those who, for more than a century, have contributed to creating the art of cinema. This thematic line has infinite ways or ramifications to deal with, but in this case we will address the influence, in current audiovisual productions-including in fantasy and horror films-of the aesthetic and expressive contributions around the cinematography that the Giallo introduced in his film contributions. It will be taken for this, as a notable example for the analysis, the work of Darío Argento and that of Mario Bava and other creators of this subgenre. In the same way, the work in the photography and art direction of these films and, in particular, the cinematographer Luciano Tovoli in the film Suspiria (1977) will be examined.\n\nAbstract: Italian cinema has always proven to be an authentic portrayer of the human condition and of contemporary issues. Social transformations, urban and industrial growth are pointed out in many Italian productions. As part of what is considered a new genre, horror and giallo confront the problems of the modern world, depicting a certain view on modernity that often engages with the atmosphere of the genre itself. This article intends to explore how a specific aspect of modernity, its problems and virtues, is seen across Dario Argento’s films, specially through his focus on art and architecture. A comparison is made with other Italian filmmakers, in order to comprehend how the genre addresses the problems of modernity. Resumen: El cine italiano siempre ha demostrado ser un auténtico retratador de la condición humana y los problemas contemporáneos. Las transformaciones sociales, el crecimiento urbano e industrial se señalan en muchas producciones italianas. Como parte de un género considerado nuevo, el horror y el giallo confrontan los problemas del mundo moderno, representando una cierta visión de la modernidad que a menudo dialoga con la atmósfera del género en sí. Este artículo intenta explorar cómo se ve un aspecto específico de la modernidad, sus problemas y virtudes, en todo el cine de Dario Argento, especialmente a través de su enfoque en el arte y la arquitectura. Se hace una comparación con otros cineastas italianos, para comprender cómo el género dirige los problemas de la modernidad.\n\nThis thesis examines representations of gender in the Italian giallo, a short-lived but tremendously popular, lucrative and prolific body of films in the murder-mystery thriller tradition that enjoyed their heyday in the early-to-mid 1970s. Traditionally, both academic and populist responses to these films have focused on the output of a small number of maverick directors that have been elevated critically above their peers. Conversely, this thesis aligns itself with a more recent trend towards eschewing auteurist readings in favour of examining the giallo as a broad ‘filone’ (cycle) defined by shared iconography, narrative conventions and underlying anxieties. Building on the typological approach of this body of literature, I place the gialli within the historical context of their initial production and release, relating the anxieties they exhibit in their depiction of gender and sexuality to the seismic sociocultural changes that occurred during this period. Drawing on the methodologies employed in criticism of the American film noir movement of the 1940s and 1950s, I explore the gialli not as straightforward allegories of real world events but rather as discursive texts that engage in a refracted form with contemporary sociocultural concerns. As its central hypothesis, this thesis asserts the giallo uses the generic conventions of the ‘whodunit’ thriller to negotiate a crisis of norms in which traditional notions of masculinity and femininity have been destabilised. In exploring the ways in which this crisis manifests itself across a corpus of sixty films, I adopt the unique approach of restructuring the giallo into two distinct subcategories – ‘M-gialli’, focusing on male protagonists, and ‘F-gialli’, focusing on their female counterparts – and examining the differing ways in which they negotiate the same anxieties about gender and modern sociocultural transformation, and the differing solutions (or lack thereof) that they propose. I also examine the portrayal of gender/sexual minorities, children and teenagers as further articulations of concerns relating to the transformation of society. I argue that the gialli are characterised by a marked sense of ambivalence towards the upheavals of this period, precluding these films from being straightforwardly pigeonholed as either reactionary or progressive in their overriding ideology. This manifests itself in a plethora of uncertainties and contradictions in their narratives, mise en scène and the portrayal of the aforementioned characters, and an inability to provide credible solutions to the problems posed by the changing face of society. This thesis moves criticism of the giallo beyond merely describing its conventions to actively explaining them, and highlights the value in reading popular filmic movements as articulations of the prevalent anxieties, attitudes and worldviews of their era.\n\nThe relationship between film and philosophy has been a strong presence in theoretical debates since the 1950s. How can films as artefacts contribute to philosophical discourse? The aim of this paper is to explore the convergence between the recent works of a film director (Giuseppe Tornatore) and a philosopher (Maurizio Ferraris). Tornatore's \"The Best Offer\" is the story of a man who has feelings for female portraits as they were real women; Ferraris thinks that a work of art is a special kind of object that acts like a subject, whom he defines «The Automatic Girlfriend». \"The Correspondence\" is a romantic drama about a woman who keeps receiving messages, emails, packages from her lover, even after he has died; this issue is deeply connected with some aspects of the documentality theory put forward by Ferraris. The two films by Tornatore work as examples of Ferraris's philosophical questions, in a case of dialectical film philosophy."
