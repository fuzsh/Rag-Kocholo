        "text": "Nero Giallo, the annual crime novel series organised by the Instituto Cervantes, comes to Manchester with a round table discussion with acclaimed writers such as Joseph Knox (United Kingdom), Blanca Riestra (Spain), Santiago Gamboa (Colombia), along with Rob Parker (United Kingdom) as a host, who will talk about the presence of crime literature in their narrative work and will reflect on their own experience about the paths that the genre is taking in their personal work.\n\nIn its sixth edition, “Nero Giallo. Encuentros en la Novela Negra” broadens its horizons and arrives from Italy and Spain to the United Kingdom with rivers of ink and crime fiction that will pass through the physical and virtual spaces of the Instituto Cervantes. Once again, the names, the themes, the voices, and the great questions generated by one of the most popular genres in the world today will unfold, uniting in an identical desire for dialogue, pleasure and knowledge many of the Spanish-speaking countries with the Italian cultural universe.\n\nThe event is in collaboration with Manchester City of Literature."
