        "text": "Italy emerges from its contrasts: one language and dozens of dialects; an age-old literature and culture and the burgeoning creativity of the local vis-à-vis the global; world-famous landscapes and culinary traditions and traumas of wars, political crises, and environmental disasters. Its identity speaks through its art, history, politics, and philosophy, being a crossroads of Mediterranean voices, civilizations, and migrations. Building on this complexity, the Graduate Program in Italian Studies considers Italy at the confluence of cultures, territories, and imagination to be seen through multiple lenses.\n\nOur Graduate Program enables students to work across the whole spectrum of the humanities and social sciences. We place Italian literary, linguistic, and cultural production in dialogue with complementary fields such as anthropology, art history, comparative literature, cultural and visual studies, philosophy, critical theory, film studies, geography, history, music, post-colonial studies, translation studies, women, gender, and queer studies.\n\nUNC-CH’s Graduate Program in Italian Studies does also something more. We emphasize trans-disciplinary conversations across the boundaries of the humanities, with the goal to develop the competencies, flexibility, and sensibility necessary to address and read the phenomena of complex societies and environments. We use innovative theoretical frameworks that allow Italian Studies to expand its vistas and topics, while still providing fruitful reinterpretations of its historic foundations.\n\nA core area is the environmental humanities, a bourgeoning cultural discourse that brings humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences together, creating space for cooperative endeavors between environmental scientists and scholars focusing on the historical, cultural, and ethical dimensions of ecological issues. Drawing on ecocriticism and all the major fields of critical ecological culture (from landscapes ethics and urban ecology to food studies, from posthumanism and new materialisms to the Anthropocene debate), our goal is to build a creative critical discourse that elicits differences, pluralities, hybridizations, conflicts, and encounters, thus positioning Italian Studies within the broader horizon of this debate.\n\nThe interdisciplinary study of medieval and early modern literature and culture is another core strength of the program, which invites students to join UNC-CH’s lively scholarly community of Medieval and Early Modern Studies. Faculty specializations include the 13th-century origins of the Italian literary vernacular; the civic and poetic crises memorialized by the Tre Corone (Dante, Boccaccio, and Petrarch); theories of obscenity and the grotesque; medieval to early modern travel; the history of medicine and law; paleography, textual transmission, and the history of the book; the reception and transformation of classical culture and language; and women writers and vernacular traditions of the Renaissance and early modern Italy.\n\nAll students’ inter- and trans-disciplinary interests are fostered by the UNC-CH Italian faculty, who provide access to a broad knowledge of Italian literary and cultural history from the 13th century to the present. Because faculty research always informs graduate teaching, students gain perspective on current movements in the critical discourse.\n\nIn addition to coursework within the department, our students take advantage of a wide range of offerings from several departments on campus – such as English and Comparative Literature and Communication Studies – and have the opportunity to enroll in Italian seminars in the Department of Romance Studies at Duke University, with whom we collaborate closely. Furthermore, the Center for European Studies, the Program in Medieval and Early Modern Studies, Women’s Studies, and other programs provide opportunities for academic research and coursework.\n\nAiming to equip young scholars with the professionalization necessary to embark on careers as researchers and teachers, Graduate students develop mentoring relationships with teaching faculty and gain experience with recent language pedagogy and diverse instructional technologies. There are many initiatives in the department which allow graduate students to adopt leadership roles: coordinating an Italian film festival, the tavola italiana, writing contests, course coordination, and more.\n\nGraduate students are also given the opportunity to collaborate with our department’s publications and plan events, the most visible of which is our annual departmental Carolina Conference on Romance Studies, a two-day event which brings together graduate students and professors from across the country for collegial exchanges on the most pressing current topics in Romance Studies.\n\nGraduate students in Italian Studies have also the opportunity to apply for several competitive fellowships and for a year-long period of teaching and research in Florence at the Istituto Lorenzo de’ Medici.\n\nFinally, in our Department of Romance Studies, graduate students in Italian find a strong and supportive community of students and faculty in French, Spanish, and Portuguese. Romance Studies at UNC-Chapel Hill is committed to supporting the professional development of its teaching fellows and works across language sections to provide mentorship and opportunities for growth."
