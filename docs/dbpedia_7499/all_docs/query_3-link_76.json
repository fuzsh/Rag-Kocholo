        "text": "This paper addresses the relationship between the concept of genre used in literary and (systemic functional) linguistic theory and change, both textual and social. Another way of describing these changes in textual and (therefore) social practice is creativity; what it is that produces new kinds of texts articulating changes in the discourses defining a society at a particular time. Of course, formalistic notions of genre work directly against this kind of creativity, implicating their users in a relatively uncritical reproduction of the discursive positioning articulated in the contemporary version of a particular genre. However, the understanding of genre which informs most contemporary critical practice (in literary and linguistic studies) is not a formalistic one, but one which is essentially sociohistorical. The paper also addresses the relationship between theoretical conceptualisations of genre in functional linguistics and literary theory, and attempts to explicate the reasons for some of the confusions which obfuscate the dialogue between these different disciplines. Defining 'genre' Critic Fredric Jameson describes the value of genre for the critic in this way: The strategic value of generic concepts... clearly lies in the mediatory function of the notion of genre, which allows the coordination of immanent formal analysis of the individual text with the twin diachronic perspective of the history of forms and the evolution of social life. (Jameson 1981: 105) For Jameson, then, genre enables the critic to bring together an examination of the meaning-making practices of the text, the semiotic choices made in the production of the text (which he calls \"immanent formal analysis\") with the history of the genres which are involved in the production of the individual text (\"the history of forms\") and the\n\nJustice is a recurrent theme in the writings of Gianrico Carofiglio, in particular the novels and the essays. In these works, great attention is paid to how justice is delivered through the Italian legal processes, how it is conceived by those who are entrusted with its administration and how it is perceived by citizens. Through the analysis of a sample corpus, comprising two essays and two of the novels of the Guido Guerrieri cycle, this contribution examines a range of strategies used by the author to configure his vision of justice. A preliminary overview appears to suggest a pronounced difference between novels and essays with regard to the author's own stance towards justice. Whilst the novels echo the nationally shared distrust for what is considered to be a system that is dysfunctional and that deserves to be critiqued and contested, the essays encourage readers to embrace a consensual, positive view of the principles of justice. The main contention in this contribution is that the apparently resigned portrayal of a flawed justice system found in the novels contains the same desire and points to the same social and ethical perspective as the essays. Through a reflection on the topoi that emerge in the texts, and through the analysis of their key themes and the observation of some of their linguistic features (including lexical frequency and distribution), this contribution brings to the fore the ideological, as well as stylistic coherence that exists between the two sets of texts."
