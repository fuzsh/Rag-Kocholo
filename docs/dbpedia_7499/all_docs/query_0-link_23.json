        "text": "Actor-playwright Eduardo De Filippo was a prolific author who came into his own after World War II with a series of plays, which included Napoli milionaria! (1945, film 1950; \"Naples Millionaire!\"; Eng. trans. Napoli Milionaria) and Filumena Marturano (1946, film 1951; Eng. trans. Filumena), which, though written in his native Neapolitan dialect, paradoxically achieved international success. Among the last champions of the primacy of the written theatrical text were Pasolini and the Milanese expressionist Giovanni Testori, an uncompromising extremist who progressed from narrative fiction to the theatre and from subproletarian Neorealism to violent Roman Catholic mysticism. Otherwise, late 20th-century Italian theatre was dominated more by innovative directors and performers than by noteworthy new plays. Outstanding directors included Giorgio Strehler, animator of Italy’s first repertory theatre, the Piccolo Teatro di Milano (founded 1947); Luchino Visconti, internationally known for his films; Luigi Squarzina; and Luca Ronconi, who in 1968 memorably staged Ludovico Ariosto’s Orlando furioso in an adaptation by Edoardo Sanguineti. Among the performers was radical political satirist and reviver of the spirit of the commedia dell’arte Dario Fo, whose 1997 Nobel Prize for Literature knocked the conservative Italian literary world on its ear. Those with the necessary stamina can admire the intense presence of Carmelo Bene (who died prematurely in 2002) in the episodic tableaux and declamatory voice-over of the antinarrative film version of his Nostra signora dei Turchi (1966; “Our Lady of the Turks”). Bene, Fo, and Fo’s talented wife, Franca Rame, are examples of the phenomenon of the author-performer.\n\nWomen writers\n\nThe feminine condition (both contemporary and historical), autobiography, female psychology, and family history and relationships are among the insistent themes of the remarkable number of accomplished women writers active in Italy throughout the 20th century. Among those whose writing in the late 19th and early 20th centuries laid the groundwork for subsequent women writers were Milanese popular novelist Neera (pseudonym of Anna Zuccari); Neapolitan journalist Matilde Serao, the best of whose 16 social novels is Il paese di cuccagna (1891; The Land of Cockayne); humanitarian socialist poet and fiction writer Ada Negri; and anticonformist feminist activist Sibilla Aleramo (pseudonym of Rina Faccio), best known for her autobiographical novel Una donna (1906; A Woman). Their successors include Florentine Anna Banti (pseudonym of Lucia Lopresti), whose Artemisia (1947) is based on the life of the 17th-century painter Artemisia Gentileschi; Fausta Cialente, several of whose novels were inspired by her lengthy stay in the Egyptian city of Alexandria but whose best works, Le quattro ragazze Wieselberger (1976; “The Four Wieselberger Girls”) and Interno con figure (1976; “Figures in an Interior”), are existential in nature; fastidious stylist Gianna Manzini, an admirer of Virginia Woolf who is at her best in the autobiographical Ritratto in piedi (1971; “Full-Length Portrait”); and Alba De Céspedes, whose Nessuno torna indietro (1938; “There’s No Turning Back”) was banned by fascist censors.\n\nUntil her death in 2001, the dean of women writers was the precise and evocative stylist Lalla Romano, a painter by training, whose autobiographical explorations include La penombra che abbiamo attraversato (1964; The Penumbra) and the poetic analyses of her father’s family photographs, Romanzo di figure (1986; “Novel of Figures”). Anna Maria Ortese, after a Neorealist debut with Il mare non bagna Napoli (1953; The Bay Is Not Naples), proceeded to create a mysterious fantasy world of suffering beings in such novels as L’Iguana (1965; The Iguana) and the extraordinary Il cardillo addolorato (1993; The Lament of the Linnet). Antifascist Natalia Levi wrote under the last name of her husband, the critic Leone Ginzburg, who died in a fascist jail not long after they were married. Her fiction, best exemplified by Lessico famigliare (1963; Family Sayings), explores the memories of childhood and middle-class family relationships. Francesca Sanvitale won acclaim for her apparently autobiographical novels, such as Madre e figlia (1980; “Mother and Daughter”), though her Il figlio dell’impero (1993; “The Son of the Empire”) is a historical novel set in 19th-century France. Rosetta Loy, who had evoked a collective memory of the past in Le strade di polvere (1987; The Dust Roads of Monferrato), combined autobiography and social history in the memoir La parola ebreo (1997; “The Word ‘Jew’ ”; Eng. trans. First Words: A Childhood in Fascist Italy). Francesca Duranti writes about a male character’s recollections of a house in La casa sul lago della luna (1984; The House on Moon Lake). Fabrizia Ramondino, in such novels as Althénopis (1981; Eng. trans. Althenopis) and L’isola riflessa (1998; “The Inward-Looking Island”), is also concerned with memory and its vagaries as well as with the cultural loss brought about by so-called social progress.\n\nThe international success of the first novel, L’età del malessere (1963; The Age of Malaise), of Florentine feminist Dacia Maraini was confirmed by the translation of several subsequent works, notably La lunga vita de Marianna Ucría (1990; The Silent Duchess). In such later novels as Voci (1994; Voices) and Buio (1999; Darkness) she turned to the popular genre of detective fiction to explore the problem of violence against women. In 1973 in Rome, Maraini founded the feminist theatre collective La Maddalena, for which she subsequently composed more than 60 plays. Triestine Giuliana Morandini set her first novel, I cristalli di Vienna (1978; Bloodstains), in the time of the German occupation of Vienna, and in La prima estasi (1985; “The First Ecstasy”) Elisabetta Rasy, moving on from criticism to fiction, endeavoured to re-create the mystic and ascetic consciousness of St. Thérèse of Lisieux. The spirit of Edgar Allan Poe lives on in the precisely related but arcane and enigmatic tales of La grande Eulalia (1988; “The Great Eulalia”), the first of many successful books by Paola Capriolo. Best-selling and widely translated author Susanna Tamaro achieved overnight commercial success with the sentimental Va’ dove ti porta il cuore (1994; Follow Your Heart), which she adapted for a film of the same name directed by Cristina Comencini."
