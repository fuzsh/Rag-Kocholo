        "text": "CHICAGO – This summer, Chicago celebrates Italian murder and local ice cream! A bottle of J&B, a sexy electro soundtrack, a generous dollop of 70’s Eurochic sleaze… and ice cream?! Benvenuti in Giallo Gelato! This summer, Chicago celebrates Italy’s Giallo films with an all-day immersion into this fascinating niche of the horror genre.\n\nOn Saturday, July 30, from 2pm to 10pm, FACETS Cinema will screen three of the sweetest hand-selected titles emblematic of the decades’ most controversial directors. Full synopsis, trailer, and ticketing can be found on FACETS’ website here. Film stills can be found in this shared folder here.\n\nGenerally characterized as murder-mystery thrillers combining the suspense elements of detective fiction with scenes of shocking violence, Gialli typically feature graphic murder scenes, stylish cinematography, and a black-gloved killer driven by sexual psychopathy. Hundreds of these films were made between 1968 through 1988, with the genre’s heyday arguably between 1970-1979.\n\nFurthering the authentic Italian deliciousness, fans of ice cream and murder will enjoy a one-time-only Giallo-inspired gallery show from Chicago artist Corinne Halbert, as well as a custom flavor of locally-made small batch gelato thanks to Sideshow Gelato!\n\nSo slip on those black leather gloves, polish that razor blade to shiny perfection, and swing by FACETS for the most scrumptious scoops of GIALLO GELATO!\n\nTickets can be purchased in advance through FACETS’ website and cost $12/General and $10/FACETS Members per screening. Double feature tickets are $20/General and $17/FACETS Members with proof of active membership.\n\nFull series description, film synopses, and trailers can be found on the Giallo Gelato series page here.\n\nSERIES SCHEDULE\n\nArt show by Corrine Halbert @ 2pm\n\nScreening of THE PSYCHIC @ 3pm – complimentary screening with reservation\n\nSideshow Gelato sampling @ 5pm – complimentary for attendees\n\nScreening of INVESTIGATION OF A CITIZEN ABOVE SUSPICION @ 5:30pm\n\nScreening of YOUR VICE IS A LOCKED ROOM AND ONLY I HAVE THE KEY @ 8pm\n\nPRESENTED BY\n\nStephanie Sack, the powerhouse behind Giallo Gelato, identifies as a voluptuous robot, Cosmic Hostess, gothy AF, Chicago native, hot yoga junkie, UFO valet, and total weirdo. She lives for films about murder, space, and murder in space. A self-taught Giallophile, Stephanie brandishes a giant knife in glee to be partnering with FACETS for this all-day soiree of Italian cinema! Catch her online at secretcinemaschool.com, and stay tuned for her small group film classes and even more in-person events coming soon.\n\nTHREE-SCOOP SPONSOR\n\nThe Italian Cultural Institute of Chicago is the cultural office of the Consulate General of Italy in Chicago. Founded in 1985, the Institute is one of five cultural agencies of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation in the United States. It is located in the heart of Chicago along the Magnificent Mile. The Institute serves as a convenient source for information about Italian life and culture that showcases Italy’s classic and contemporary heritage with particular reference to art, music, cinema, design, architecture, literature, fashion, theatre, cuisine, science, and technology. The Institute is also home to a school of Italian language and culture, as well as a venue for art exhibitions and film screenings. A special scoop of ice cream to the Institute’s Director, Luca Di Vito, who made Giallo Gelato possible!\n\nTICKETING AND MORE\n\nThe screening for THE PSYCHIC is free. For INVESTIGATION and VICE, single tickets are $12/General and $10/FACETS Members and double feature tickets are $20/General and $17/FACETS Members.
