Preciado – a leading figure in the study of gender and body politics – is a playful, moving, metatextual documentary expanding Virginia Woolf’s novel Orlando: A Biography, in which the protagonist changes gender midway through the story to become a 36-year-old woman.\n\nA century after Woolf wrote her novel, Preciado decides to send her a cinematic letter telling her that Orlando has emerged from her fiction to live a life she could never have imagined, organising a casting that brings together 26 contemporary trans and non-binary people, aged 8 to 70, to embody the character. Reconstructing the stages of his own personal transformation through authentic voices, writings, theory and images, Preciado’s meticulous, bracingly intellectual yet highly accessible film eschews pigeonholes, inviting us to see instead how everything is constantly in flux.\n\nView Event →\n\nSasquatch Sunset (15)\n\nIn the misty forests of North America, a family of Sasquatches—possibly the last of their enigmatic kind— embark on an absurdist, epic, hilarious, and ultimately poignant journey over the course of one year.

She was mute and living in a small hamlet in Arkansas. \"He was the first white man I read who seemed to understand that a human being was a human being and we are more alike than unalike\".\n\nThe film follows Maya Angelou on a pilgrimage to Burns country in which she explores the strong parallels that exist in their lives - poor beginnings, early love of literature, fame, liberty and equality, music, religion, love and passion - and meets the enthusiastic and fanatical Burnsians, who welcome her to ceilidhs in Ayrshire and Edinburgh in honour of her visit and Burns' genius.\n\nFirst broadcast in 1996 to commemorate the bicentenary of Burns’ death, we are screening the documentary in partnership with Dumfries and Galloway Pensioners for Independence to mark the anniversary of his death. The group promotes Scottish Independence but are not linked to any political party. They welcome Angelou’s observation that “poems transcend race, time and space” and her recognition that Burns is a symbol for “freedom and Scotland’s dignity, independence and humanity”.\n\nView Event →\n\nInside Out 2 (U)\n\nReturning to the mind of the newly teenage Riley just as headquarters is undergoing a sudden demolition to make room for something entirely unexpected: new Emotions!

The media subsequently appeared to lay blame for the violence at the feet of the strikers. Daniel Gordon’s comprehensive documentary doesn’t just overturn this fabrication, it portrays what took place as planned action on the part of the Thatcher government, with the Prime Minister determined to seek redress for the National Miners’ Union’s victory over the Conservative government in the early 1970s and to forever break the union’s role at the heart of British working class society. Released on the 40th anniversary of the battle, and featuring first-hand accounts and archive footage, this is a searing portrait of that tragic event.\n\nView Event →\n\nInside Out 2 (U) SUBTITLED SCREENING\n\nReturning to the mind of the newly teenage Riley just as headquarters is undergoing a sudden demolition to make room for something entirely unexpected: new Emotions!
