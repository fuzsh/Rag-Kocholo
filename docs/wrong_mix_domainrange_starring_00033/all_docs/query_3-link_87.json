        "text": "PRESS RELEASE: Burns Point, a crime drama directed by Tim Blackburn, is starting production in the first week of March, 2014. The film is Tim Blackburn’s feature film directorial debut. Tim has directed several successful short films, most notably Monobrow – a finalist in the Australian 2013 Tropfest short film festival (aka The Largest Short Film Festival in the World). He followed this by writing and directing Wet Dreams, a finalist in the 2013 Tropfest New York Festival. Both films have had success in other festivals around the world.\n\nBurns Point follows Jeremy, a young man whose sister has been brutally murdered. Jeremy expects the law to deliver justice, but the killer’s father is a high- profile detective who isn’t about to see his son jailed for life. After a suspiciously botched police case the son is acquitted and can never be retried. Refusing to allow his sister’s death to go unpunished, Jeremy seeks vengence. Burns Point was written by Chris Blackburn, who has worked as a writer and producer for the last thirty five years. His career started as a cadet journalist at The Australian newspaper before moving onto on-air television reporting with Channels Nine and Seven. Chris’s career highlights include high profile television shows including Sixty Minutes, Big Brother, My Kitchen Rules, Temptation Island, Wife Swap, Beauty and The Geek. Chris lives with his wife at Empire Vale, south of Ballina, the inspiration for the setting of Burns Point. “It’s a great rural setting. Canefields, rivers, mountains, rainforests and deserted beaches that go on for ever,” said Chris Blackburn\n\nChris Blackburn is the father of director Tim Blackburn. “Working on this film with my father is definitely a unique experience. Sometimes I wonder, why the hell am I making a film with my Dad?! But for the most part we’re on the same page with our ideas and visions and it’s been a great way to reconnect,” says Tim, director of Burns Point. Tim has returned to Australia for the film from Toronto, Canada where he currently lives and works as a Television Editor. “I’m just so excited to be back in Australia and working on such a big project, with so many talented people,” says Tim.\n\nThe cast and crew will be announced over the next week via the film’s social media networks. “We are putting an emphasis on social media for Burns Point, because we want the community to be involved and get excited. It’s not often we get to see a film being made in the Northern Rivers,” said Chris Blackburn. The last feature to be filmed in the area was PJ Hogan’s Mental (2012)."
