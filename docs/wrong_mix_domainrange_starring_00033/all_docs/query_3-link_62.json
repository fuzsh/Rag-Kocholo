Rogers reflects on his adaptation of Greg Rucka’s classic comic two-plus decades later and his unaired (but leaked) pilot for Warren Ellis’ comic ‘Global Frequency’.\n\nRead More\n\nUnseen Hollywood anotherfilmnerd Unseen Hollywood anotherfilmnerd\n\nDARK DAYS WITH MARK VERHEIDEN\n\nGenre vet Mark Verheiden reflects on his 'dark' days, prepping a shot-but-never-finished pilot remaking the classic gothic soap 'Dark Shadows', and a TV series designed to bridge the gaps between movies as part of a sprawling, epic adaptation of Stephen King's 'The Dark Tower'.\n\nRead More\n\nUnseen Hollywood anotherfilmnerd Unseen Hollywood anotherfilmnerd\n\nINSIDE THE NUTT HOUSE: STEVE KEARNEY’S TALES FROM TINSELTOWN\n\nAustralian actor-turned-producer Steve Kearney’s experience shooting his American feature film debut wasn’t what you could call ideal. Within three weeks of filming ‘The Nutt House’, the director was fired. By the time it was ready to be edited, all four of the film’s writers (Sam & Ivan Raimi, Bruce Campbell and Scott Spiegel) had disowned it. And the film’s ‘premiere’ at Cannes, well; it wasn’t how you’d hope a film premiere would go. Kearney spoke to Another Film Nerd about ‘The Nutt House’, ‘Pistol Pete’ - the pilot he filmed with legendary ‘Simpsons’ writer John Swartzwelder - and the path that brought him back to Australia.\n\nRead More\n\nUnseen Hollywood anotherfilmnerd Unseen Hollywood anotherfilmnerd\n\nFEEBLES, FREDDY AND THE FURRY ARM OF THE LAW\n\nIt may not have set the box office alight, but the cult New Zealand sex-and-violence-laden puppet film 'Meet The Feebles' put filmmakers Peter Jackson and Danny Mulheron on the map. Before long, New Line Cinema enlisted the duo to take on one of their most beloved and feared franchises. Mulheron reflects on his brief time in Los Angeles, his work with Peter Jackson and an unsuccessful pitch into the world of television with the most unlikely of writing partners – a veteran writer from Jim Henson's popular educational program, 'Sesame Street'.\n\nRead More\n\nUnseen Hollywood anotherfilmnerd Unseen Hollywood anotherfilmnerd\n\nHOW THE FLETCH WASN'T WON\n\nWhen push came to shove, a set of competing deadlines left writer/director Bill Lawrence confronted with a choice - stick with his hit TV series 'Scrubs' or leave the show behind to make his feature directing debut with a big-screen revival of the 'Fletch' series. And, to the surprise of many, he decided the world of features could wait, leaving Harvey Weinstein in a mad scramble to get something made before he lost the rights to the iconic franchise.\n\nRead More\n\nUnseen Hollywood anotherfilmnerd Unseen Hollywood anotherfilmnerd\n\nFAIR DINKUM TERROR: GRABOIDS DOWN UNDER\n\nWhen ‘Tremors’ co-creators Brent Maddock and S.S. Wilson were approached to develop a fifth entry in the popular franchise, they envisioned sending gun nut Burt Gummer to the land down under the throw another graboid on the barbie. But a combination of unfortunate events and mysterious studio forces saw them unceremoniously dumped from the franchise.\n\nRead More\n\nUnseen Hollywood anotherfilmnerd Unseen Hollywood anotherfilmnerd\n\nA NIGHTMARE IN THE MAKING\n\nAcademy-Award nominated screenwriter Eric Heisserer’s first feature screenplay credit is one most writers would kill for - reviving a horror franchise that has enthralled and terrified audiences for generations. But a director with differing views and shifting studio attitudes gave the then-baby writer a baptism of fire into the world of studio filmmaking.\n\nRead More\n\nUnseen Hollywood anotherfilmnerd Unseen Hollywood anotherfilmnerd\n\nSCALING THE DARK TOWER\n\nOne-time' Walking Dead' and 'Damien' showrunner Glen Mazzara didn't just try to adapt Stephen King's sprawling epic 'The Dark Tower'; he lived and breathed the eight-novel series for more than three years. And while his pilot never saw the light of day, he remains proud of his plans for the Master of Horror's magnum opus.\n\nRead More\n\nUnseen Hollywood anotherfilmnerd Unseen Hollywood anotherfilmnerd\n\nLOVE AMONG THE VILLAGE PEOPLE\n\nOne was too highbrow (despite the presence of a horny ox), the other was too sad - but the unaired pilots for ‘Brave New World’ (a workplace comedy set in a historical re-enactment village) and ‘Guess Who Died’ (a tale of lost and new love among retirees) hold a special place in writer Peter Tolan’s heart.\n\nRead More\n\nUnseen Hollywood anotherfilmnerd Unseen Hollywood anotherfilmnerd\n\nWINTER’S TALES: DESPERATE DRUG DEALERS AND MISGUIDED CHARITY PART 1\n\nFor the followup to his feature writing/directing debut, Alex Winter had a hot script, a talented cast and the money to make it happen. But at the eleventh hour, something happened that made him walk away. Winter delves into his operatic, ambitious and thoroughly compelling noir and an unmade political satire set to star Alan Rickman.\n\nRead More\n\nUnseen Hollywood anotherfilmnerd Unseen Hollywood anotherfilmnerd\n\nWINTER’S TALES: DESPERATE DRUG DEALERS AND MISGUIDED CHARITY PART 2\n\nFor the followup to his feature writing/directing debut, Alex Winter had a hot script, a talented cast and the money to make it happen.

He had the script, he had Brad Pitt on board to star, but fate wasn’t willing to let the tale of a struggling actor with an uncanny resemblance to one of Hollywood’s leading stars reach the screen.\n\nRead More\n\nUnseen Hollywood anotherfilmnerd Unseen Hollywood anotherfilmnerd\n\nDown and Meow-t: John August talks ‘Catwoman’\n\nWhen John August got the chance to pitch to Warner Brothers on a standalone ‘Catwoman’ film, he developed a story that would expand on the mythos created in the classic Tim Burton film ‘Batman Returns’. Unfortunately, Warner Brothers - still smarting from the backlash to ‘Batman & Robin’ - had other ideas.\n\nRead More"
