        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Burns & Co. Prods. has acquired the exclusive rights to bring James Stewart’s story to the big screen. The theatrical movie, tentatively titled A Truly Wonderful Life, will share Stewart’s inspiring tale of valor, purpose, and faith.\n\nAaron Burns, who is a director/producer at Burns & Co., and his team have been developing the story with Stewart’s daughter, Kelly Stewart-Harcourt, who is serving as executive producer for the film.\n\nShortly after winning an Oscar in 1941, Stewart enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Corps and won his wings as a combat pilot. He earned his way to the rank of squadron commander and used his everyman charm to lead fellow Americans through combat missions over Germany.\n\nWhen he returned from war, Frank Capra asked him to star in It’s A Wonderful Life. When talking about the success of It’s A Wonderful Life, Stewart once said, “It’s simply about an ordinary man who discovers that living each ordinary day honorably, with faith in God and a selfless concern for others, can make for a truly wonderful life.”\n\n“I am so honored Kelly and her family are trusting us with their father’s legacy,” Burns said. “We are excited to take moviegoers on a journey to discover the real Jimmy, and how his father’s prayers and his collaboration with Frank Capra guided him through his darkest hours. Jimmy came to truly embody the characters he played, as husband, father, and citizen.”\n\n“Our family is thrilled that Aaron and his team approached us about bringing Dad’s story to life on the big screen,” said Stewart-Harcourt. “Everyone loved him as George Bailey. Now they can learn how that movie intertwined with other parts of his life in so many important ways.”\n\nBurns is a producer and director specializing in family films. He recently directed Birthright Outlaw, starring Sarah Drew and Lucas Black, for Sony’s Affirm Originals. Joining Burns on the Stewart film are co-producers Sam Juergens and Justin Strawhand."
