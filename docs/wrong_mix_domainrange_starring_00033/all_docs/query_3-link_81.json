        "text": "BERLIN — Jet-set horror movie Airborne, starring Mark Hamill and directed by Dominic Burns, has landed with Chelsea Films, the niche distributor that is part of the Curzon Artificial Eye Group, with paperwork for all U.K. rights.\n\nIndie producers Simon Phillips (White Collar Hooligan) and Jonathan Sothcott (Strippers vs. Werewolves) are shopping the title to buyers during the European Film Market in Berlin.\n\nDaniel Cooper closed the deal for Chelsea Films.\n\nThe Berlin Film Festival: Why It Still Matters for Hollywood\n\nIt marks the first starring role in a British film for Hamill, whose name is inextricably linked to Luke Skywalker, the character he played in the Star Wars franchise more than 25 years ago.\n\nAirborne also stars Gemma Atkinson (How to Stop Being a Loser), Julian Glover (Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade), Alan Ford (Snatch), Billy Murray (Rise of the Footsoldier), Simon Phillips (Jack Falls) and Andrew Shimm (This Is England ’88).\n\nThe movie details the story of those on an airplane at a remote airport caught in a really bad storm that gets the last take-off clearance of the day. A terrorist plot to take them hostage is the least of the passengers’ problems after an ancient evil in the hold awakens and stalks the plane, picking people off one by one.\n\nProduced on a budget of about $2 million, the picture was filmed on location in Britain. Chelsea Films plan to release it this year."
