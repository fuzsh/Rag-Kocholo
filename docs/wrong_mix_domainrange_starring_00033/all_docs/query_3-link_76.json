        "text": "Though you probably only know Alex Wolff from his performances in films such as “Oppenheimer,” “Pig,” and “Hereditary,” the actor also dabbles in a bit of filmmaking. He already has one feature under his belt, the 2019 drama “The Cat and the Moon,” and now, it appears he’s ready to sit in the director’s chair once more for the upcoming film, “If She Burns.”\n\nREAD MORE: ‘Manodrome’ Trailer: Jesse Eisenberg & Adrien Brody Are Giving ‘Fight Club’ Vibes In New Toxic Masculinity Thriller\n\nAccording to THR, Alex Wolff is set to star in “If She Burns,” a film he is already attached to as a writer and director. Joining Wolff in the cast are Victoria Pedretti, Asa Butterfield, and Justice Smith. The film follows the story of a young woman who finds herself traveling to Europe with her family after a traumatic event. While there, she starts a love affair with her neighbor, and things begin to spiral out of control. As if writer, director, and star weren’t enough, Wolff is also set to co-write the music for the film alongside Karl McComas-Reichl.\n\nLISTEN: Alex Wolff Talks ‘Old,’ ‘Pig’ & The Genius Of ‘Hereditary’ [The Playlist Podcast]\n\n“I’m exhilarated to embark on a journey with such remarkable, brave actors like Victoria, Asa and Justice,” said Wolff. “What we put on screen will be daring, ferocious, tender, and honest. I’m honored to be able to share it.”\n\nAs with many of the new projects that are being announced this week, “If She Burns” will be one of the packages for sale at the upcoming AFM. Filming is hoping to begin next year in Italy, which would lead most to be believe we’re likely looking at a 2025 debut for the film, wherever it lands."
