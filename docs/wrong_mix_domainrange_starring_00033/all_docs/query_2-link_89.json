        "text": "Disco Didn't Die. It Was Murdered!\n\nChief Vick calls Shawn and Gus to the station after a handful of old convictions get overturned. They have to reopen all the investigations and need Shawnâs help on one in particular-Eugene Franks, who was caught with explosives meant to bomb police headquarters. It was the biggest case of Henryâs career but Vick stresses that he can in no way be involved in the investigation. Henryâs no longer on the force and could compromise any new evidence they find. But by the time Shawn and Gus get back to the Psych office, Henry is there waiting for them and wants in. Shawn refuses. As Henry leaves, he stresses that he knows he got the right guy and stopping him saved a lot of lives. Jere Burns and Ted Lange guest star.\n\nThe Gunfighter\n\nNursing his wounds following Mags Bennettâs death, U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens (Timothy Olyphant) aims to find the cash and drugs that went missing in the wake of the Bennett familyâs demise. And as Boyd Crowder (Walton Goggins) looks to sell what he salvaged from the crime familyâs marijuana farm, he hatches a plan to take revenge against the imprisoned Dickie Bennett."
