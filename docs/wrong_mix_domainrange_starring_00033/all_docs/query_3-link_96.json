        "text": "Lee Daniels is one of the most interesting filmmakers working today. Each of his films are unique, often adapting true stories in interesting ways. However, you could argue that his next film, “The Deliverance,” is his biggest risk to date, as it shows what Daniels can do in the realm of horror.\n\nREAD MORE: Summer Movie Preview: 50 Must-See Films To Watch\n\nAs seen in the trailer, “The Deliverance” is a film about a struggling single mother trying to move forward with her life in a new home. However, it appears that there is something seriously wrong with her young son, as it appears that he may be possessed.\n\nThe cast includes Andra Day, Glenn Close, Mo’Nique, Anthony B. Jenkins, Miss Lawrence, Demi Singleton, Tasha Smith, Omar Epps, Caleb McLaughlin, and Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor. As mentioned, “The Deliverance” is directed by Lee Daniels. The filmmaker is probably best known for his films “Precious,” “The Butler,” and “United States v. Billie Holiday.”\n\n“The Deliverance” debuts on Netflix on August 30. You can watch the trailer below.\n\nHere’s the synopsis:\n\nEbony Jackson, a struggling single mother fighting her personal demons, moves her family into a new home for a fresh start. But when strange occurrences inside the home raise the suspicions of Child Protective Services and threaten to tear the family apart, Ebony soon finds herself locked in a battle for her life and the souls of her children. Inspired by a true story, THE DELIVERANCE is directed by Academy Award nominee Lee Daniels and stars Andra Day, Glenn Close, Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor, and Mo’Nique in a genre-defying take on darkness, possession, and finding a higher power."
