Fresh off his first stand-up tour in four years, Martin Lawrence will headline a Showtime stand-up special — his first in 14 years, the network announced on Tuesday.

Debuting Sept. 9 at 9 p.m. ET/PT, Martin Lawrence Doin’ Time: Uncut was filmed earlier this year at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles and features the comedian/actor riffing on “everything from sex and relationships to President Obama, Bill Cosby, Hollywood, and more.”

Lawrence, who headlined the Fox comedy Martin from 1992 to 1997, also starred in the Bad Boys and Big Momma’s House movies. (He will return to the Bad Boys franchise in Bad Boys For Life, due in 2018.) His most recent TV role was opposite Kelsey Grammer in 2014’s short-lived FX comedy Partners.

Doin’ Time: Uncut is Martin’s third stand-up special, following 2002’s Runteldat and 1994’s You So Crazy.
