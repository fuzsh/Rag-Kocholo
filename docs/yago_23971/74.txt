Two years after the premiere of his very popular sitcom but before his famous breakdown, Martin Lawrence returned to his comic roots in 1994's Martin Lawrence: You So Crazy that, despite some dated language and subject matter, still provides laughs after 25 years.

Filmed before a full house at the Majestic Theater in New York, Lawrence starts off this show with the racial material that every black comic has been doing during the last 40 years. There's nothing really original here, but Lawrence's very special delivery gives the material a feeling of originality that really isn't there.

One thing I noticed that is special about Lawrence is a solid talent for physical comedy that comes through in some unique ways. Something I've never really noticed with any other comics is the way he is establishes different characters through the way they walk. It was so funny watching the way a white person in a movie theater telling on loud black people walk as opposed to the way a black female crack addict walks was really hilarious. Martin puts a different walk to several different characters during this 90 minutes and every walk is just distinctly different enough that we always know exactly who Martin is talking about.

Lawrence also takes a different tack with another subject for black comics: drugs. I loved his take on the pros and cons of smoking weed. I was particularly impressed by his take of a guy getting stoned and watching The Wizard of Oz and a guy getting stoned with his best friend and being prompted to make a lifelong confession. The expected rants about relationships take on an air of originality as well because we get a look at the ladies point of view through conversations with her girlfriends after the date.

Yes, the influence of Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy is in his material (Lawrence did a movie with Murphy the same year called Boomerang), but Lawrence puts his own brand on the material and the influence never moves further than homage.
