        "text": "PHOENIX (AZFamily) — These bad boys are starting to look like grumpy old men.\n\nSynopsis\n\nIn Bad Boys: Ride or Die, the late Miami PD Captain Howard (Joe Pantoliano) has been accused of being involved with some nasty criminals. However, Detectives Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) receive a pre-recorded video message from Captain Howard telling them he’s been framed and it’s up to them to clear his name. While trying to get to the bottom of this conspiracy, Mike and Marcus find themselves being set up and accused of crimes as well, making them fugitives of the law.\n\nMy thoughts\n\nThe Bad Boys franchise is really based on three things: Will Smith, Martin Lawrence, and their chemistry together. Sure, it’s also known for its action set pieces and oversaturated cinematography, but the glue that really holds it all together is how great Smith and Lawrence bounce off each other.\n\nBad Boys: Ride or Die is the duo’s fourth outing as everyone’s favorite sweaty Miami detectives. While Smith and Lawrence both seem to be having a good time doing their classic bickering while driving around the city and investigating sketchy locations, it’s all getting a bit played out by this point.\n\nPerhaps this issue seems more noticeable since I watched the entire series over the past week, but there’s only so many ways you can write Marcus telling Mike he’s too crazy and unpredictable, or Mike telling Marcus he needs to stop being such a slob in his car. Their interactions are still amusing, but everything is all so interchangeable now that you can swap these conversations around with the ones in the previous films and it would all essentially be the same.\n\nWho needs lunacy when you have family?\n\nOne thing I do enjoy about the franchise is just how much of a comically unhinged lunatic Mike Lowrey is. This guy is one of our protagonists, but he’s constantly abusing his power, assaulting citizens, and pointing his gun into people’s faces with no trigger discipline at all. It’s hysterical.\n\nHe’s probably my favorite Will Smith character because he doesn’t often play someone so edgy, but the edges of Mike Lowrey have been sanded off here. He’s now married, feeling guilty over Captain Howard’s death, and having panic attacks when the going gets tough.\n\nSmith plays Mike more reserved and mature here, which kind of messes with the dynamic we expect between him and Marcus. Marcus is supposed to be the more mature, levelheaded of the group, so to have Mike be less manic than usual wasn’t as fun.\n\nThe last film, Bad Boys for Life, was pretty good until it wasn’t, with a ridiculous revelation of Mike having a long-lost son who’s out for revenge. The franchise suddenly veered into Fast & Furious territory with Lowrey forgiving his son and letting him live, despite him murdering Captain Howard and even almost killing Mike himself.\n\nThis plot thread is unfortunately continued, with Mike’s son Armando (Jacob Scipio) tagging along with him and Marcus while they’re on the lamb. Scipio does a fine job, but I just find the overall concept of his character so dumb and just at odds with Mike’s character and who he’s supposed to be, I couldn’t take any scene with him seriously at all.\n\nOld dogs, same tricks\n\nMartin Lawrence gets to show some depth to his acting with Marcus having a near death experience from a heart attack. It gives him a new perspective on life and he has an existential crisis that is far more in character than Mike’s crisis was for him.\n\nMarcus thinking he’s invincible and can’t be killed because “it’s not his time” is perfectly in line with his character and while his heart issues eventually seem to be an afterthought, this all pays off in amusing ways, especially at the end.\n\nIt’s the most depth I’ve ever seen in Lawrence’s acting and he brings some natural tenderness to Marcus. These new Bad Boys flicks aren’t as shlocky and mindless as the first two, but it’s a welcome change of pace that they have a bit more heart than Michael Bay’s constant callousness.\n\nThe rest of the cast is fine, but overall stuck with thanklessly bland roles. I appreciate that we keep getting these returning cast members to keep the continuity alive, but like everything else here, they’re all interchangeable and generic. They fulfill their purpose and that’s it.\n\nAlso, while I’m ecstatic to see Rhea Seehorn getting some work after Better Call Saul, I’m hoping she can secure some roles that are actual characters and not… this. She gives it her all, but her character here is so flat and pointless that having a different actress wouldn’t have come with this level of disappointment.\n\nBad boys, decent action\n\nDirectors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah proved themselves to be more than competent blockbuster action directors with Bad Boys for Life. With a slightly larger budget and more experience with this kind of filmmaking, the action is far more exciting and creative this time around.\n\nWhile their direction of the action can sometimes be a bit too frantic for their own good, it always seems like Adil & Bilall are thinking of the most creative ways they can shoot an action sequence. There are some ambitious drone shots and some interesting angles and framing to keep the action more than just people wildly shooting at each other or cars and buildings bursting into flames.\n\nStill, like the character interactions and plot elements, there’s only so much you can do with the action. The gunfights, car chases, and explosions are all well shot with some great stunt work, but it’s just more of the same stuff we’ve seen before. It’s all serviceable, but nothing awe inspiring.\n\nUnfortunately, the action in the series peaked in Bad Boys II with the freeway chase sequence. It’s one of the most spectacular action sequences ever put to film and I don’t think anything in this series will ever top that. Too bad it’s in one of the worst and most irritating action films ever made.\n\nFinal verdict\n\nAt four films in the franchise now, fans know what they’re going to get when watching a Bad Boys movie: Will Smith and Martin Lawrence bantering while generic action movie clichés occasionally pop up to get them into shootouts and car chases.\n\nThe action is all fun enough and Smith and Lawrence still provide some hearty laughs from time to time, but the formula itself is getting stale and the storytelling is increasingly getting more convoluted and bogged down in itself. Perhaps this should be the bad boy’s last ride because there’s not much gas left in the tank.\n\nMy rating: 5.5/10\n\nBad Boys: Ride or Die is currently playing in theaters nationwide.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?
