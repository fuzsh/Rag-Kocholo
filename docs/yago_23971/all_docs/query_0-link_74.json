        "text": "The comedian and actor talks to Dave Itzkoff about returning to television and good health — and letting his daughters in on his past.\n\nYour new FX series, “Partners,” stars you and Kelsey Grammer as mismatched lawyers working together. Had you ever met him before this project? I first met Kelsey at a Christmas dinner over at Tim Allen’s house. We just met in passing and said hello. I had no idea we would ever work together, because we’re more of an odd couple. I never saw us together.\n\nHave you found that television has changed since the ’90s, when you were making “Martin”? Well, yeah, the demands are greater now. It’s not as easy to get on TV. Just to get ratings, it’s very hard. The paychecks are not the same anymore.\n\nDo you think that “Martin” helped create opportunities for other black performers to get shows? Maybe. I don’t know that it’s gotten better. I think we’re in a hole right now, and so whoever is working — black or white or whatever — there are many more people that ain’t working, that just don’t have a job, that are struggling, that are just trying to get their hustle on.\n\nAnd even at your level, you’re feeling that? Can’t you just go take your fortune and live in the Hills? I mean, if I had to just live in an apartment and, you know, drive a dune buggy, that would get me by. I don’t have to live in the Hills.\n\nGiven your history — you’ve been hospitalized for exhaustion and dehydration, you were in a three-day coma in 1999 — did FX want a clean bill of health before hiring you? They didn’t require that. They see me in every meeting. I was a standing bill of health. I run on a treadmill. I do weights. I get exercise at least three times a week. I play basketball at least two times a week.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
