        "text": "Everyone wants Steve Martin to play Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on \"Saturday Night Live\" â€” everyone, it turns out, other than Steve Martin.\n\nThe \"Only Murders in the Building\" star, 78, revealed to the Los Angeles Times he has turned down an offer to play Vice President Kamala Harris' 2024 running mate on \"SNL\" this fall.\n\nMartin said \"SNL\" creator Lorne Michaels called him on Wednesday to offer him the role, but he declined.\n\n\"I wanted to say no and, by the way, he wanted me to say no,\" Martin told the Times. \"I said, 'Lorne, I'm not an impressionist. You need someone who can really nail the guy.' I was picked because I have gray hair and glasses.\"\n\nJoin our Watch Party! Sign up to receive USA TODAY's movie and TV recommendations right in your inbox\n\nMartin, who has hosted \"SNL\" 16 times going back to 1976, also said he wasn't prepared to make the commitment required for the role.\n\n\"They're gonna find somebody really, really good,\" he told the Times. \"I'd be struggling.\"\n\nMartin previously joked about the calls for him to play Walz on Threads, writing, \"I just learned that Tim Walz wants to go on the road with Marty Short.\"\n\nHarris on Tuesday officially named Walz her running mate in the 2024 presidential election, prompting \"SNL\" fans to debate who should play him on the show this fall. \"SNL\" typically spoofs the vice presidential debate during each election cycle, which this year would be between Walz and Sen. JD Vance. No casting for Vance has been announced.\n\n'Only Murders' fans: Steve Martin's full life on display in Apple TV+ doc 'Steve!'\n\nMaya Rudolph, though, is set to reprise her role as Harris on \"SNL\" through the presidential election.\n\nWith Martin out of the mix, other names that have been floated for the \"SNL\" Walz role include comedian Jim Gaffigan and \"Parks and Recreation\" star Jim O'Heir. On Tuesday, O'Heir reacted to being included in a CNN segment on candidates for the role alongside Martin, Gaffigan and former Sen. Al Franken.\n\n'The Steve-ness of it all': Steve Martin talks tour with Martin Short, new audiobook\n\n\"I don't mind being in the mix but that's the best pic of me that they could come up with?\" O'Heir joked.\n\nOther fans have urged \"SNL\" to choose a member of its cast to play Walz. For the 2020 election, Jim Carrey, who was not a regular \"SNL\" cast member, stepped in to play Joe Biden.\n\n\"Call me crazy but I think one of the 'SNL' cast members should play Tim Walz,\" comedian Paul Scheer wrote on X.\n\n\"SNL\" is set to return in September for its landmark 50th season. Cast members Punkie Johnson and Molly Kearney recently announced their exits from the show."
