        "text": "To anyone alive and paying attention in the US in the 1990s, Martin Lawrence is a generational icon: a comedy pioneer in stand-up and in television, where his sitcom Martin ran for five years. Lawrence grew up around Washington, DC, and was a boxer as a teenager, before trying stand-up comedy. In the first five or so years of his career, he appeared in Spike Lee’s Do The Right Thing and the show What’s Happening Now!! and was the original host of Def Comedy Jam. At 54, he’s experienced intense highs (the first season of Martin was watched by eleven million people a week) and lows, including a near-death experience at the end of the last century. Martin’s last season was in 1997, after Lawrence’s co-star Tisha Campbell filed and then settled a lawsuit against Lawrence, alleging sexual harassment and abuse.\n\nHe’s slowed down a bit from his manic 1990s and early 2000s days, but he’s still very much around. His last two films are Harmony Korine’s Beach Bum – in which he cameos as a dolphin-loving Vietnam vet named Captain Wack – and this month’s Bad Boys For Life, the third instalment of the franchise he stars in with Will Smith. He also has a stand-up comedy tour coming, starting 31 January, called the Lit As Fuck Tour: “It's where I take out the young superstar comics of tomorrow and take them to arenas and let the crowd see them do their thing and we just have a great time.”\n\nThis conversation took place on an outdoor basketball court behind his North Hollywood office, in two lawn chairs he placed opposite each other right at foul line.\n\nI was trying to figure out how to ask this question in a way that would not take you all day to answer. People have been talking about a new Bad Boys for a decade. What is the most concise explanation for why it took so long to get done?\n\nMartin Lawrence: The script wasn't right. And Will, to his credit, refused to do the movie until the script was right. It wouldn't have been a good movie. We didn't want that. We wanted to do a sequel where people would go, \"Oh, man, that's what I'm talking about. It just gets better.\"\n\nIt feels like there was a time when you were getting pretty fed up with people asking you about when this movie was coming out.\n\nNo.\n\nNo?\n\nNo, because it's here now.\n\nOK, but before it was here, I definitely got the impression it was a sore subject for you.\n\nYeah. But I don't really dwell on that now. But I mean, probably at that time, I was like, \"Oh, man.\" People were asking me and I had no answer for them. I was asking myself that question. I was asking other people, \"When are we going to do it?\" I was asking [producer] Jerry Bruckheimer, \"When are we going to do this movie?\"\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThere’s a joke about this in your last stand-up special, Doin’ Time, where you say if they don’t make Bad Boys soon they’re going to have to call it...\n\nSad Boys, yeah. And if you see the movie, I'm a little heavier in the movie, so you know, it's true. I wanted to be in shape enough to get through it and be able to deliver. I have no excuses, but I had hurt my back in a New Year's Eve show right before we did Bad Boys, so I couldn't work out or anything for the whole movie. All I could do is eat. [Laughs.] That was it. So I'm glad we had the stuntmen, because they do a great job.\n\nYou’re 54. But as someone who grew up in the 1990s, I think my mental picture of you is still of the guy from the sitcom – in your own mind, when you picture yourself, are you still in your mid-twenties, doing the Martin show?\n\nNo. I'm so not that guy from the sitcom. That guy from the sitcom is boisterous, and he's got bravado and he's big and no-nonsense. But even the Martin from the show is a loving Martin. The way he loves his lady, Gina [played by Tisha Campbell], and his friends. And the real Martin is like that.\n\nI was trying to ask whether you felt your age. But \"Who is the real Martin?\" is probably a better question.\n\nI'm a loving person. I care about my family deeply, my family and friends deeply. I don't like to party a lot now that I'm older. I like to be at home and relax with my family and eat food and just watch Netflix.\n\nYou just said you don't like to party a lot now that you're older. Was it different when you were younger?\n\nIt was different. At that time I was single. And it was all about, look at the ladies and getting out and enjoying yourself and partying. But when you're older, you get a lot more settled, you know? Hopefully, you’re with one person and you try to build from there.\n\nI hadn't realised, or maybe I had forgotten, how crazy the end of that decade was for you. You were arrested after you were found waving a gun on Ventura Boulevard in 1996. And then in 1999 you almost died after you fell into a three-day coma.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nHave you ever seen Dave Chappelle’s appearance on Inside the Actors Studio?\n\nI haven’t, no.\n\nHe talks about you. He says, \"Let me ask you this, what is happening in Hollywood that a guy that tough would be on the street waving a gun, screaming, 'They’re trying to kill me.' What's going on?\" It made me wonder: what was going on?\n\nWell, there’s no need to relive the past, but I was young and I made, uh, some irresponsible choices and, you know, carrying a gun when I shouldn't have been carrying a gun. And just getting into things that I shouldn't have gotten in.\n\nThe next thing Chappelle said about you and other prominent entertainers who had been called “crazy” was this: \"These people are not crazy. They're strong people. Maybe the environment is a little sick.\" Do you agree?\n\nNo. Whatever it is, if I was involved in it, or it didn't put a good look on me – if it was my fault or somebody else's fault – it's just not a good look. And I own up to that. When I was younger, I owned up to it and I own up to it now. I'm a better person as a result of things I got into when I was young, because I knew not to do them again. [Laughs.] I know not to repeat that kind of behaviour.\n\nWhen did you realise that you had to change?\n\nWhen I started getting a handle on it was when my family got involved and started saying, \"This is not right\" or “This is wrong” or “You shouldn't say this” or “You're not doing yourself no justice by getting into this.” I even said in [Lawrence’s 2002 stand-up special] Runteldat, one of the judges [in a cartoon authoritarian voice]: “Martin, you're fucking up. You're in my courtroom. You got all this fucking talent and you're blowin’ it, kid.” And so I think those things resonating with me is what made me start to get a handle on, \"Wait a minute. I don't want to be a failure. I don't want to blow this. I'm a kid from the hood and I've made it all the way to Hollywood, and I've got my hands and feet imprinted in Hollywood and don't want to go down negatively. I want to be held up positively.\"\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nYou were really influential to me and a lot of people of my generation. I'm always curious about this: when you look at culture now, are there things that you can point to where you're like, I invented or popularised that?\n\nWhen I just see comedians doing theirs, you know? Pushing the envelope. When I see that, I kind of go, \"Oh, wow, they might have took a page out of my book.\" Because I came after – Richard Pryor's the ceiling. It don't get no bigger than Richard Pryor. Then you got Eddie Murphy. You can't be afraid to go for it in the way I do stand-up, the language, the subjects I talk about, sex, all that stuff. And when I see young comics going for theirs and not being afraid to use foul language and have no apologies for it and they're funny, then I go, \"Wow, yeah. That reminds me of me.\"\n\nThat makes me think of what you said earlier about the sitcom character you played and how you can still feel the love and the gentleness of the real Martin. That comes across in your stand-up, too, even when you’re pushing it pretty far.\n\nRight. I'm not just one side. If you remember when I had the Def Jam show. Def Jam was on Friday. I could be blue on Friday and then on Thursday night the Martin show was on and I could be clean on Thursday night. So you got the clean Martin on Thursday night and on Friday night you got the blue Martin. So I was able to do both.\n\nIn a relatively short span, you went from Do The Right Thing to Star Search to What’s Happening Now!! to having your own sitcom that was being watched by eleven million people a week. What was your life like at that point?\n\nIt's first of all a dream come true, that you can't believe. You’re starting to make more money than you've ever made in your life. More people are around you than you've ever been around. And they’re telling you they love you and how good you are. You don't get too many people saying “no” to you. Uh, fast cars, nice women. It’s all of the above.\n\nWere you able to enjoy success at the time?\n\nI didn't get to enjoy my celebrity at that time as much as I'm probably enjoying it now, because of the conflicts that I've gotten into and things I got into. So those things were always on my mind, and they would stress me and worry me and stuff like that. But I pulled through it.\n\nYou did the show for five seasons, right? How come it ended?\n\nWell, how can I say this? It just was time to end. Let's just put it that way. It was just, at that time, there was some, um, there were some things that was being said that...\n\nYou’re talking about Tisha Campbell’s lawsuit?\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nI saw that you guys had been spending time together recently.\n\nYeah. Because none of that was true. It was all a lot of bullshit and...\n\nWhat was bullshit?\n\nJust whoever's side it was. It was bullshit.\n\nDid you guys ever talk about it?\n\nWe don't need to talk about something that just didn't happen. So I just decided to walk away from the show. I just decided to end it. People said that I got cancelled, but that wasn't the case. I decided to just leave the show.\n\nLet me ask the question a different way. Do you understand Tisha’s perspective differently now than you did then?\n\nI love Tisha. I've seen her then and now, now and then, always with nothing but love. I have nothing but love for her and I always have.\n\nDo people still bring up the show to you? Do your kids know what Martin is, for instance?\n\nWell, they know now because they see it on BET and VH1 and everything else. But they knew when they were young too.\n\nYou worked a ton in the 1990s—I think you did, like, ten or eleven films, plus the show. And then in the first decade of the 2000s, it's still crazy – ten or eleven films again. And then it’s been considerably less in the past decade. Was that a conscious decision, to step back a little bit?\n\nWell, I had to. I had to step back a little bit and get some time for myself. I was getting worn down a little bit. Scripts was just coming and coming and coming. I couldn't do everything. And I went through a coma and all that stuff, so my body just...\n\nAfter the coma, you had to relearn how to talk.\n\nI did.\n\nWhat did you take away from that experience?\n\nThat God is great. That there is a God.\n\nI'm sorry. I cut you off. You were saying you went through a lot and you felt like you needed to step back.\n\nAnd value my life. I want to be here. And to show my kids positive light. And that's where I'm at. I give all praises to God.\n\nYou said you were getting worn down a bit. From what, exactly?\n\nI was just working a lot and you got to take a break. I mean, the rigours of working on a set – the hours that you work, the tedious lines and things that you got to learn. People don't realise how much goes into it. So I just needed rest from that for a while. You got to remember, you cannot consume yourself with the business all the time. You have a life outside of the business. You have a family to take care of. You have a family to nurture. You have kids to raise, you have graduations to go to, you have colleges to get them into and support them and things like that. You have all these things personally that you have to do in your life that has nothing to do with the business. So you cannot ever let the business consume you so much to where it takes away your personal life, to where you don't have time to do the things for you that are instrumental in your survival, in your care and everything else.\n\nGiven that, at this point, what gets you out of the house and saying “Yes” to a new project?\n\nI'm still hungry! [Laughs.] I love feeding my family. I love helping people. I love taking care of people. And the only way to do that is to keep the train going and hopefully, due to the grace of God, I'll be able to stop the train when I'm ready to stop.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nLast year you starred in The Beach Bum, in a very strange and memorable role. How did you end up in Harmony Korine's movie?\n\nHarmony just called me. I’d never met Harmony. He just called me and was like, \"You're in the movie, Martin.\" It was like I couldn't tell him no. He was just like, \"So we got this part for you and it's funny. It's the funniest part in the movie. You're going to enjoy it and everything.\" And I was like, \"OK, uh, Harmony, so I'm Martin.\" He gave me no way out. As soon as he got on the phone, I couldn't say no to him. He didn't give me no option. Like, he didn't ask. He’s just like, \"Hey, Martin, I got this part for you.\" Not \"I was wondering, how do you feel about doing it? What do you think?\" He didn't ask me none of that. He just said: \"So you're going to be great in this part.\"\n\nIn your last special, you said laughter is the sound of the basketball going through the net for you. When you’re not on stage, who are you making laugh?\n\nMy lady, my fiancée, my kids, my brothers and sisters, my friends.\n\nDo your kids think you’re funny?\n\nYeah. They laugh at me for no reason. Maybe a face I make: \"Daddy, you're so crazy.\" I go, \"What?\" They go, \"Your face, the way you said that.\"\n\nIn both specials, you shadowbox before you go out and tell jokes. Why?\n\nThat's just because I'm an old fighter. I'm an old boxer from when I was young and that's how I used to train. It just gets me loose and everything before I go out there.\n\nWhat are you thinking in those moments?\n\nGod, give me the strength to be the best I could be. Please allow me to be funny.\n\nDo you worry about that, not being funny?\n\nHell, yeah, I don't take it for granted. I don't just say, \"Oh, it's automatic.\" Nah. I know I'm funny. I know I'm blessed with a gift, but I don't take it for granted. Every audience is different every night. Everybody don't agree with every joke you say out of your mouth. And they are even more sensitive today with the social media and everything else. Some comics can’t even say this or that. It's crazy.\n\nHas there ever been a moment when you had real doubt about whether your gift was available to you?\n\nThe only time I ever doubted was the first time I ever went on stage. I bombed. That's when I doubted if this was for me. But then I paid my money for the weekend show and I came back and I would just study the headliners and the middle act and the opening act and then I got back on stage and it was for me.\n\nHow did you go from boxing to stand-up comedy?\n\nJust because I'm a fighter doesn't mean I’m not funny. I would always have people in my neighbourhood, crowds standing around and I would have them laughing. My classmates couldn’t wait to get to class to see what I was going to do in class. My teacher would give me the last five minutes of class to make people laugh. Her name was Ms Henderson. We called her Froggy. She was our art teacher. She gave me the last five minutes to make people laugh. She said, \"If you could just settle down and let the students do their lessons, I’ll give you five minutes to make people laugh. But you gotta be funny to get out of the class.\" So she let me do that and then one day she came back with a card to an open-mic night to a comedy club in DC. And she said, \"Here, I'm going to give you that.\" I said, \"What's this?\" She said, “You want to do comedy, right? This is for open-mic night for you to try out.\" I said, \"Wow.\"\n\nAre you surprised that it seems like Bad Boys is the thing that has had the longest afterlife of all the things you’ve worked on?\n\nIn this business, just to be known for anything is a blessing. So if I'm known for Bad Boys, so be it. If I'm known for my stand-up, so be it. If I'm known for the Martin show, so be it. I'm just blessed to be known.\n\nDo you feel like your relationship to the industry has changed at all since you began working?\n\nI just feel like I'm changing with the times. I'm trying to understand the times and trying to understand how to change with the times. It's a little different. Negotiations are different.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\nRead more\n\nRobert De Niro on Martin Scorsese's ultimate mafia masterpiece\n\nWhy Uncut Gems and 1917 are the best kinds of theme park rides\n\nThe true star of Sam Mendes' 1917 is George MacKay"
