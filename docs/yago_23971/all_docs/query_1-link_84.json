        "text": "The actor and comedian spoke out after a worrisome video at the LA premiere of his new film, Bad Boys: Ride or Die.\n\nMartin Lawrence wants everyone to know he's okay.\n\nThe actor, 59, recently faced speculation about his health after a video of him at the Bad Boys: Ride or Die LA premiere went viral.\n\nIn the video, Martin appears unsteady while walking with his costar Will Smith. Will could be seen holding on to him as he seemingly staggered down the platform.\n\nThis week, Martin was asked about the moment during an appearance on HOT97's Ebro in the Morning.\n\n“Now Martin…everybody’s talking [about] you on the balcony waving at people, [you’re] looking around, where you’re looking around? … People took it like something was wrong with your health, or something,” host Ebro Darden began.\n\n“I was like, ‘Oh, this is rock concert stuff,'” Martin teased of the crowd size. “What the hell is going on? [This is] for a movie?”\n\nWhen Ebro asked him directly if anything was going on health-wise, Martin insisted he was \"fine\" and \"healthy.\"\n\n“I’m fine. I’m in God’s hands,” Martin said. “I’m blessed. You know, I’m glad to be waking up every day. I’m all good. No need for people to be concerned.”\n\n“I’m healthy as hell,\" he added. \"Stop the rumors!”\n\nWell, you heard the man! Glad you're okay, legend!!\n\nYou can see him and Will in Bad Boys: Ride or Die when it hits theaters on June 7.\n\nShare This Article"
