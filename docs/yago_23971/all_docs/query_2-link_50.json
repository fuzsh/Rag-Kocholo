        "text": "CLEVELAND – MAY 8, 2024 – Comedy legend Martin Lawrence today announced he will headline a national arena tour – his first comedy tour since 2016 – coming to Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse on Saturday, August 3rd. The “Y’all Know What It Is!” tour will head to nearly 40 cities across the U.S. through April 2025. The tour is set to launch soon after the June 7 release of the highly anticipated Bad Boys: Ride or Die feature film, co-starring Will Smith. Tickets go on sale Friday, May 17, at 10am local. To purchase tickets, visit rocketmortgagefieldhouse.com.\n\nView the tour announcement video here: Martin Lawrence Y'all Know What It Is! Tour on Vimeo.\n\nTickets for Martin Lawrence general on sale begins Friday, May 17, at 10 a.m.\n\n“Y’all Know What It Is!” is an all-new stand-up show and fresh one hour set where Martin brings the real talk and finds the funny in everything from family to culture as only he can. Special guests have been personally hand-picked by the comedy maestro and are some of the hottest comedians on the mic including Adele Givens, B. Simone, Chico Bean, DC Youngfly, Deon Cole, Desi Banks, Jess Hilarious, Mojo Brookzz, Ms. Pat, Rickey Smiley and more. Guest comedians vary by city.\n\n“Comedy gives me that instant gratification,” Lawrence says. “Seeing the fans up close and in person, making people laugh, doing what I love most, this is what it’s all about for me. But hey…y’all know what it is!”\n\nLawrence, hailed by fans around the world as one of the greatest comics of all time, launched his comedy career in New York City at the Improv Comedy Club. His breakthrough film role came courtesy of Spike Lee in the classic Do The Right Thing! Other film roles followed including House Party and Boomerang. He soon captured the attention of mega producer Russell Simmons who tapped Lawrence to host the groundbreaking HBO series Def Comedy Jam. In 1992, Lawrence landed his own hit series Martin. The ratings juggernaut single-handedly elevated FOX to a major contender against network television stations. Following the finale of his self-titled comedy series, Lawrence went on to star in a string of top grossing films including Life, Big Momma’s House and the Bad Boys franchise."
