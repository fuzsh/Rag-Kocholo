Eddie and Martin could play army. The movie could be funny but it can also be serious at the same time. There are a lot of guys in the army that find they do not like the army once they get in. There are guys that have been killed or almost killed in the army. Some guys do not know how lucky they might be that they are not accepted in the army. There are guys that sadly have to leave their families and have to fight war. I can picture Eddie Murphy and Martin doing crazy things to get out of the army. I can also picture them staying in the army and scared and crazy on the battlefield. I wish they would make an army movie."
