        "text": "Comedy legend Martin Lawrence is hitting the road with his “Y’all Know What It Is!” Comedy Tour with a stop at Hard Rock Event Center at Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Tampa on Sunday, December 15 at 8 p.m.\n\nTickets starting at $150 will be available Friday, May 17 at 10 a.m. via seminolehardrocktampa.com and Ticketmaster.\n\nFans can access venue presale tickets Thursday, May 16 at 10 a.m. through Seminole Hard Rock Tampa’s X, Instagram, or Facebook pages.\n\n“Y’all Know What It Is!” is an all-new stand-up show and fresh one hour set where Martin brings the real talk and finds the funny in everything from family to culture as only he can. Special guests have been personally hand-picked by the comedy maestro and are some of the hottest comedians on the mic.\n\n“Comedy gives me that instant gratification,” Lawrence says. “Seeing the fans up close and in person, making people laugh, doing what I love most, this is what it’s all about for me. But hey…y’all know what it is!”\n\nLawrence, hailed by fans around the world as one of the greatest comics of all time, launched his comedy career in New York City at the Improv Comedy Club. His breakthrough film role came courtesy of Spike Lee in the classic Do The Right Thing! Other film roles followed including House Party and Boomerang. He soon captured the attention of mega producer Russell Simmons who tapped Lawrence to host the groundbreaking HBO series Def Comedy Jam. In 1992, Lawrence landed his own hit series Martin. The ratings juggernaut single-handedly elevated FOX to a major contender against network television stations. Following the finale of his self-titled comedy series, Lawrence went on to star in a string of top grossing films including Life, Big Momma’s House and the Bad Boys franchise.\n\nLawrence returns to the Bad Boys franchise with Bad Boys: Ride or Die which opens worldwide Friday, June 7.\n\nAbout Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Tampa\n\nOwned and operated by the Seminole Tribe of Florida, Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Tampa is one of the largest and most successful casinos in the world offering award-winning gaming, hospitality, and entertainment.
