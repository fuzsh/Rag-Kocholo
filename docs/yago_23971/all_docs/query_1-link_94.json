        "text": "As the fourth iteration of the popular ‘Bad Boys’ franchise gears up to hit theaters on Friday, June 7, fans are voicing their concern over one of the film’s stars: Martin Lawrence.\n\nThe reason why is because of a now viral video of Lawrence and costar Will Smith at the Los Angeles premiere of the film over the weekend. According to some fans, the “Martin” star appeared to be suffering from some sort of health issue.\n\nIn the clip below, you can see Smith and Lawrence atop a mega bus as they’re riding into the premiere. As Smith hypes the crowd up and introduces Lawrence to one side of the bus, he noticeably leads him over by grabbing him by the hand. Lawrence walks slowly over and waved to the crowd before turning around slowly.\n\nIn the comments on Entertainment Tonight’s Instagram, folks online expressed their concers:\n\n“Okay, what’s going on? Why has Martin been acting weird? Is he sick or something? Is he dying? Does anybody have the answers? Please tell me. I can’t bear to lose Martin,” wrote one social media user.\n\n“Why Will leading Martin out like he Stevie Wonder,” said another.\n\n“Did Will just help Martin walk? The way it looks Martin seems off,” commented another.\n\nThese comments echo similar ones that were made back in January at the 2024 EMMYS when Lawrence appeared alongside his Martin costars Tisha Campbell, Tichina Arnold, Carl Anthony Payne II for a surprise reunion. Folks were curious about the star’s cadence and demeanor, though afterwards sources close to him explained to TMZ there was a technical glitch with the teleprompter that made things difficult for the “Blue Streak”actor.\n\nStill, it didn’t stop folks from talking. However, others were quick to come to his defense.\n\n“Google is our friend y’all. It says that Martin did have a stroke years ago. BUT more recently he’s dealing with the loss of his brother. Either way I pray he’s ok. And I love seeing him and Will still doing their thing,” said one commenter.\n\n“I have a new respect for Will Smith, he got Martin,” another wrote.\n\n“Martin suffered a stroke a few years back. And he recently lost his brother. Will is making (sure) he gets both of them to shine. Age and health can affect anyone. Wish them the best,” said another.\n\nIf we’ve learned anything from Chadwick Boseman’s cancer diagnosis and the public’s reaction to his weight loss, it doesn’t do any of us or Martin any favors to speculate on what’s going on with his health. The best we can do is continue to support him and send up thoughts and prayers."
