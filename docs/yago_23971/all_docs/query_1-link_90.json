        "text": "Although former Martin co-stars Martin Lawrence and Tisha Campbell had some personal issues while filming the hit 1990s sitcom, they’re still able to show each other love on social media.\n\nThe lawsuit filed by Campbell against Lawrence and HBO Studios in 1997 became a major topic during Lawrence’s press tour for Bad Boys For Life after Lawrence called the sexual harassment lawsuit “bullshit” in an interview with GQ.\n\nWith the issue becoming fodder again, the comedic actor took to Instagram on Friday (January 17) to combat the negativity while praising Campbell in the process.\n\n“Regardless of the past or any misrepresentation of it In the press, I have nothin’ but love for Tisha then and now,” he captioned a photo of the pair. “We are good and always will be! #teammartymar #yougogirl.”\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/B7ZiqQyJvl3/?igshid=1va83rs5bivhp\n\nCampbell responded in the post’s comment section with, “YOU GO BOY My fam fo life!”\n\nLawrence’s response caused a media stir about the classic sitcom’s demise, leading Campbell to reach out to Lawrence. The former co-stars immediately resolved the issue. Lawrence and Campbell’s relationship has been on the mend since having a lunch meeting in 2018, sparking rumors of a Martin reboot.\n\nDespite the lawsuit becoming a hot topic again, Lawrence’s career has been experiencing a resurgence with the release of Bad Boys for Life and his Lit As Fuck Comedy Tour. Campbell has been scoring role after role with appearances on shows such as Last Man Standing, The Bold and the Beautiful and Outmatched.\n\nCheck Campbell’s official response to Lawrence on The Talk below."
