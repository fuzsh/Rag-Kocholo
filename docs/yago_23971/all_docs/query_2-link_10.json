        "text": "Comedic actor Martin Lawrence will follow up the theatrical debut of his new movie \"Bad Boys: Ride or Die\" with his first standup tour since 2016.\n\nLawrence's “Y’all Know What It Is!” arena tour will launch July 20 at Gila River Casino in Chandler, Arizona, and travel across the country through April 5, 2025, at Simmons Bank Arena in Little Rock, Arkansas.\n\nThe 40-city comedy tour will make an Oklahoma City stop Nov. 16 at Paycom Center.\n\nWhen is the new Martin Lawrence and Will Smith 'Bad Boys' movie coming to theaters?\n\nLawrence's first headlining arena tour in eight years will follow closely on the June 7 theatrical bow of \"Bad Boys: Ride or Die,\" the fourth installment of his blockbuster buddy-cop film franchise co-starring Will Smith.\n\n“Y’all Know What It Is!” is billed as a fresh one-hour set where the longtime comedian \"brings the real talk and finds the funny in everything from family to culture as only he can.\"\n\nSpecial guests for the trek have been personally hand-picked by Lawrence, according to a news release. Deon Cole and Benji Brown are the on bill for the OKC show.\n\n“Comedy gives me that instant gratification,” Lawrence said in a statement. “Seeing the fans up close and in person, making people laugh, doing what I love most, this is what it’s all about for me. But hey … y’all know what it is!”\n\nLawrence launched his comedy career in New York City at the Improv Comedy Club. His breakthrough film role came courtesy of Spike Lee in the cinematic classic \"Do The Right Thing!\" Other film roles followed, including \"House Party\" and \"Boomerang.\" He soon captured the attention of mega producer Russell Simmons who tapped Lawrence to host the groundbreaking HBO series Def Comedy Jam.\n\nIn 1992, Lawrence landed his own hit television series \"Martin,\" co-starring Oklahoma City native Tisha Campbell. A ratings juggernaut, it elevated Fox to a major contender against network television stations.\n\nFollowing the finale of his self-titled comedy series, Lawrence went on to star in a string of top-grossing films, including \"Life,\" \"Big Momma’s House\" and the \"Bad Boys\" franchise.\n\nWhen do tickets go on sale for Martin Lawrence's OKC show?\n\nTickets for Lawrence's OKC show go on sale at 10 a.m. Friday, May 17 through AXS."
