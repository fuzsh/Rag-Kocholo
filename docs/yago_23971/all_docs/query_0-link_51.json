        "text": "The catchphrases—you so crazy, you go girl, talk to the hand and wazzup—are just a few that the 90s hit show Martin popularized. When the series debuted August 27, 1992, on FOX, no one, not even Martin Lawrence himself, predicted it would become one of the greatest sitcoms of all time. Thirty years later, the show is still widely watched on BET—where it airs every weeknight—as well as on other networks and streamers.\n\nThe Martin: The Reunion special hosted by comedian Affion Crockett—which debuted on BET+ on June 16—is receiving mainstream love from venerable, global publications such as The Washington Post, The Guardian and Forbes, proving how universal the show’s genius has been. Yet, speaking with EBONY, the 57-year old funnyman admits to not realizing how classic the show was until recently. “I think I’m just finding that out because we’re still on the air,” he marvels. “We’re still running after all these years.”\n\nTo achieve the level of success that he did before the age of 30, he reveals that he used Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy as his blueprint. “As a kid, I just always gravitated towards comedy,” explains Lawrence. “I was always watching television, watching Richard Pryor, watching Eddie Murphy. I always wanted to act and so I thought comedy, stand-up comedy, [like they did] was the way to get into acting.”\n\nBack in 1992, he was on fire. That March, he kicked off the widely successful Def Comedy Jam as its first host; and then in July, he co-starred with Murphy, one of his idols, in Boomerang, a big-screen classic. Not only was comedy the way, it also became the vehicle for Lawrence to tap into his own greatness. Although he had appeared on Star Search, a precursor to America’s Got Talent and American Idol, as well as become a series regular on the short-lived What’s Happening spinoff What’s Happening Now!, Lawrence feels his role as Cee in Spike Lee’s Do The Right Thing was very crucial to launching his Hollywood takeover. “It was just one of the biggest opportunities for me and I was so excited because I was doing this movie with Spike Lee and I just couldn’t believe it,” he shares.\n\nEven more special, his big opportunity came cosigned by a comedy legend. “Spike was actually in town to see [the comedian] Robin Harris and he had a meeting with him at a hotel. I went with Robin to the meeting,” reveals Lawrence. “Spike was talking to Robin about the movie, and Robin said ‘Spike you should take a look at Martin. He’s kind of funny.’” Lee asked if the young king was performing that night and Lawrence replied that he was. “‘Spike said ‘I’ll take a look,’ and the rest is history,” reports the comedic actor.\n\nFrom there, he appeared on-screen alongside the rap duo Kid ‘n Play in Reginald Hudlin’s hip-hop House Party films, as well as on his own successful HBO One Night Stand comedy special. Even with all the incredible things that happened for him in 1992 solidifying him as a star in his own right, working with Murphy on Boomerang was still a personal highlight.\n\n“It was special to do because it was my first time getting to work with Eddie Murphy. Imagine me as a young comic, and this is my first big break to have an opportunity to work with somebody that I look up to. For me, it was a dream come true.” But even more of Lawrence’s dreams were coming true as his show Martin became an instant hit, regularly attracting over 11 million viewers.\n\nThe show about Martin Payne, a DJ at a radio station, and his girlfriend Gina Waters—a young Black couple trying to navigate love while kicking it with their good friends Tommy, Cole and Pam—resonated instantly. Instinctively, Lawrence knew who his Gina was. “Tisha Campbell was the first person that I went to cast for the show because I knew from working with her in House Party and everything, [that] if I could get her, everything else would fall into place.”\n\nAnd it did. Campbell’s real-life best friend Tichina Arnold would play her character’s bestie Pam. Carl Anthony Payne II, whom the two women knew from the teen audition circuit back in the day, played Cole, Martin’s dense friend. Thomas Mikal Ford, who had TV and movie roles dating back to the late 1980s, rounded out the cast as Martin’s other best mate Tommy. Sadly, Ford passed away at age 52 in 2016. During the reunion show, the whole cast honors him, pointing to the spiritual guidance Ford gave them.\n\nFor Lawrence, representing Black brotherhood with Ford and Payne II “was just fun.” “Their comedic timing was impeccable. The way we played off each other; the way we would break during scenes, and laugh—cracking each other up and everything. We just had so much fun. It just resonated on-screen, and that’s the way we were off-screen,” he continues.\n\nThat first Bad Boys film grossed over $141 million worldwide. Its two sequels—Bad Boys II (2003) and Bad Boys for Life (2020)—have grossed over $273 million and $426 million, respectively, putting the franchise net total at over $840 million—with the last sequel grossing more than the first two combined. Nearly 30 years later, the public still rallies around the blockbusters’ leads going after the bad guys with high-speed chases and all the dazzle that made the franchise sparkle.\n\nLawrence dismisses speculation that the franchise’s fourth installment would be canceled as a result of Smith’s shocking slap of Chris Rock at the Oscars “We got one more at least,” he says.\n\nBecause he too had his own stumbles in stardom, Lawrence presumably empathizes with his longtime co-star. In 1996, on the heels of the success of A Thin Line Between Love and Hate, Lawrence made headlines, reportedly running into the middle of traffic on Ventura Boulevard in Sherman Oaks, CA—in a frantic mental state—raising concerns that he would harm himself. Exhaustion and dehydration were given as the official cause for the unexpected breakdown. The following year, Campbell, his Martin costar, filed a lawsuit against him and the series’ producers. The case was later settled out of court and the cast finished filming the show’s fifth and final season."
