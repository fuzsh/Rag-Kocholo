        "text": "Event Info\n\nComedy legend Martin Lawrence will headline his first national arena tour since 2016 - The “Y’all Know What It Is!” tour is set to launch soon after the June 7 release of Bad Boys: Ride or Die co-starring Will Smith.\n\n“Y’all Know What It Is!” is an all-new stand-up show where Martin brings the real talk and finds the funny in everything from family to culture as only he can. Lawrence launched his comedy career in New York City at the Improv Comedy Club. His breakthrough film role came courtesy of Spike Lee in Do The Right Thing! Other film roles followed including House Party and Boomerang. He captured the attention of mega producer Russell Simmons who tapped Lawrence to host the groundbreaking HBO series Def Comedy Jam. In 1992, he landed his own hit series Martin. The ratings juggernaut single-handedly elevated FOX to a major contender against network television stations. Lawrence went on to star in a string of top grossing films including Life, Big Momma’s House and the Bad Boys franchise.\n\nDC Young Fly - Born and raised in Atlanta, DC Young Fly launched his career as a highly favored content creator. He has optimally developed his brand to comedian, actor, host, producer, VO actor and musician, and was named one of Variety’s coveted 10 Comics to Watch.\n\nBenji Brown began his career in comedy and radio starring on the number one radio station in Miami (99JAMZ and Hot 105) from 2004 to 2018 while honing his skills as a stand-up comedian with a unique voice and hilarious characters. With his incredible timing and knack for radio, Benji has become a key fixture on the Rickey Smiley Morning Show, serving up the laughs on the airwaves while headlining major clubs around the country most weekends."
