        "text": "Martin Fitzgerald Lawrence[1] (born April 16, 1965) is an American actor, film director, film producer, screenwriter, and stand up comedian. He came to fame during the 1990s, establishing a Hollywood career as a leading actor, most notably the films Bad Boys, Blue Streak, Big Momma's House and Bad Boys II. Lawrence has acted in numerous movie roles and, most notably, starred as Martin Payne in his own television series, the FOX network sitcom Martin, which ran from 1992 to 1997.\n\nLife/Career[]\n\nMartin was born in Frankfurt am Main, Hesse in Germany to American parents. He was given his first name after civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. and his middle name after US President John F. Kennedy.[1] His father, John Lawrence, had served in the US Military.[1] After his parents divorced when he was eight, Lawrence rarely saw his father, who worked as a police officer at the time. [2][3]\n\nHis mother, Chlora (née Bailey), began working several jobs to support her family. [4][5]During his teen years, Lawrence excelled at boxing. [1] He lived in Maryland, and attended Thomas G. Pullen School of Creative and Performing Arts (Landover, Maryland), Fairmont Heights High School (Fairmount Heights, Maryland), Eleanor Roosevelt High School,[2] and also Friendly High School in Fort Washington, Maryland, becoming a Mid-Atlantic Golden Gloves boxing contender. Lawrence moved to Denver and found his way to the legendary Kings Wood comedy club.[citation needed] Shortly after appearing at the Wood, he won a performance spot on Star Search, a popular show in the United States.[2] He did well on the show and made it to the final round before ultimately losing. However, executives at Columbia TriStar Television saw Martin's performance and offered him the role of \"Maurice\" on the television sitcom What's Happening Now!!; this was his first acting job.[2] Upon cancellation of that show, Lawrence found bit parts in various films and television roles. His breakthrough role was as Cee in the Spike Lee film Do the Right Thing. Other roles followed in films such as the House Party series and the Eddie Murphy vehicle Boomerang. During this period, entertainment mogul Russell Simmons selected him to host the groundbreaking series Def Comedy Jam on HBO. Def Comedy Jam gave many comedians (including Chris Tucker, Dave Chappelle, Bernie Mac and Cedric the Entertainer) mainstream exposure.\n\nDuring his stint with Def Comedy Jam, Lawrence appeared in his own hit series, Martin, which aired on Fox TV.[2] The show ran from 1992 to 1997 and was an enormous success. Martin was the flagship of Fox's Thursday-night line-up, which drew millions of viewers away from NBC's \"Must See TV\" line-up. He hosted Saturday Night Live on February 19, 1994, where he made crude remarks about women's genitalia and personal hygiene; the monologue was completely edited out of NBC reruns and syndicated versions, and Lawrence was banned from the show for life. \"Martin\"'s ratings continued to skyrocket so much that Fox became more of a contender against NBC and came closer to being considered among the top television networks.\n\nLawrence's Martin co-star, Tisha Campbell-Martin, filed a lawsuit against Lawrence and the show's producers for sexual harassment and verbal and physical assaults. HBO Studios settled the lawsuit so the show's final season could be completed. Campbell-Martin agreed to complete the season on the condition that she not appear in any scenes in the last two episodes with Lawrence.[7][citation needed] No criminal charges were ever filed and the accusations were never brought to court.\n\nAfter Martin ended its run, Lawrence found ample work in comedy films. He often starred as the second lead opposite actors including Eddie Murphy, Will Smith, and Tim Robbins.[2] Many of his films were blockbusters at the box office, including Boomerang (1992), (also with him again in \"Life\") Bad Boys (1995), Blue Streak (1999), Big Momma's House (2000) and Bad Boys 2 (2003). He also starred in critical and box office failures including Black Knight (2001) and National Security (2002). Regardless, his salary steadily increased to over $10 million per film role. He continues to work in film, with such films as Big Momma's House 2, which opened #1 at the North American box office and grossed almost $28 million its first weekend,[8] and Wild Hogs (2007), in which he plays a bored suburbanite seeking adventure on the open road in a biker comedy alongside John Travolta, Tim Allen and William H. Macy.\n\nIn 2006, Lawrence appeared on Inside the Actors Studio, during which Lawrence briefly brought back to life some of the characters he'd portrayed on Martin.\n\nIn 2008, Lawrence starred in Disney's College Road Trip co-starring with Raven Symone. This particular film was his first G-rated film. Even though it was his first film to be G-rated, it is not his first time appearing in a children's film. as well as a voiceover role in Open Season (2006) opposite Ashton Kutcher.\n\nAt the 2009 BET Awards he appeared in a spoof movie trailer with Jamie Foxx for a fictional movie The Skank Robbers that featured, their respective television characters Sheneneh Jenkins and Ugly Wanda. in 2010, Fox announced that it was producing a film based on the sketch, featuring Foxx, Lawrence, and actress Halle Berry.[9]\n\nIn 2010, it was announced that Lawrence would reprise his role as FBI agent Malcolm Turner in Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son, the third film in the Big Momma's House series, which was released in 2011.[10]\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nLawrence was engaged to actress Lark Voorhies (who guest starred as Nicole in the episodes \"Break-Up (Part 2) and \"Break-Up (Part 3)\" in Season 1) in 1993.\n\nHe married Patricia Southall, a former Miss Virginia USA, in 1995. The couple had one child, Jasmine. They then got divorced in 1997.\n\nOn July 10, 2010, Lawrence married longtime girlfriend Shamika Gibbs at his Beverly Hills home. Actors Eddie Murphy and Denzel Washington were among the 120 wedding guests;[11] Shanice serenaded the couple by singing the Minnie Riperton classic \"Lovin' You\".[12]\n\nDuring August 1999, Lawrence slipped into a three-day coma after collapsing from heat exhaustion while jogging in 100-degree heat while wearing several layers of heavy clothing.[2] He recovered in the hospital after nearly dying from a body temperature of 107 °F (41.7 °C), his breathing assisted by a respirator.\n\nTelevision[]\n\nWhat's Happening Now!!
