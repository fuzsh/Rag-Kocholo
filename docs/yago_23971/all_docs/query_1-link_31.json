        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\n31 2 “ BLUE IS T HE NEW GREEN Martin Lawrence and the Mainstream Appeal of Vulgarity Joshua Truelove Hurry up!” an audience member yelled at comedian Martin Lawrence while he was taking a sip of water during his 2002 stand-up comedy special Martin Lawrence Live: Runteldat. Responding to the heckler, Lawrence fired back, “Somebody put something in his mouth. My zipper is stuck, y’all.” The audience roared as Lawrence continued to make fun of the audience member who dared to challenge him. “I’ll warn you, watch your mouth now. Don’t forget who the original Def Jam host was, mother fucker.”1 The audience continued to laugh as Lawrence pointed out that although he was the original Def Comedy Jam (HBO, 1992–1997) host and biggest comedy star of the 1990s, he was no longer either. However, the comedian of the hip-hop generation and the heir apparent to Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor had not changed his brand of comedy. In the 1990s, Lawrence was inarguably the biggest comedy star. Def Comedy Jam and his eponymous sitcom, Martin (FOX, 1992–1997), were massive hits, and Lawrence starred in comedy film classics like Nothing to Lose (1997, dir. Steve Oedekerk), Blue Streak (1999, dir. Les Mayfield), Life (1999, dir. Ted Demme), and Bad Boys (1995, dir. Michael Bay). After years of being berated for his vulgarity by detractors, and admittedly being burned out from working so much, Lawrence’s comedy and film career waned. However , at the height of his career—from about 1992 to 2003—Lawrence proved through Def Comedy Jam, stand-up specials, and rated-R comedy films that 32 Rolling blue humor is a profitable mainstream brand. This chapter argues that despite his controversies, Lawrence’s ability to blend hip-hop culture and blue humor—vulgarity used to talk about explicit scenarios and topics—into the mainstream not only illustrated the agency of the comedian but also showed vulgarity was profitable. It is important to note, though, that Lawrence was not a hack who simply used profanity to get cheap laughs. Rather, he was a master at physical comedy, crowd work, and the use of blue language for comedic emphasis. Nor did he originate the use of profanity in the mainstream. Comedians like Lenny Bruce, Redd Foxx, George Carlin, Richard Pyror, and Eddie Murphy had popularized the use of blue humor. While they all faced varying levels of repercussion, the backlash to Lawrence’s comedy in the 1990s was odd, since popular culture in the 1990s encouraged edgy content . Lawrence, though, was able to bring blue comedy into the mainstream more than other comics before him. I argue that Lawrence harnessed a particular brand of vulgarity through his stand-up comedy, sitcom, and films that was not only profitable but also surprisingly mainstream. The first section focuses on Lawrence’s rise to fame from 1992 to 1993. Lawrence became a breakout star as the host of Def Comedy Jam and the star of Martin. Lawrence’s brand of comedy was malleable enough not only to attract different audience segments at FOX and HBO but also to work within the constraints of each network. The second section focuses on the backlash Lawrence received for his language in 1994, which found Lawrence briefly banned from NBC for telling a blue joke in his opening monologue on Saturday Night Live (SNL) and battling with the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) over an NC-17 rating for his comedy special You So Crazy. The third section examines how the backlash in 1994 had little impact on Lawrence’s career, as he took blue humor into mainstream films for the rest of the decade and more, even during and after television networks and cable stations were cutting Black-cast shows from their programs. Ultimately, these three sections coalesce to show how Lawrence ’s blue comedy helped him rise to fame and how he eventually took that same brand of comedy into mainstream films even with a year of critical and industry backlash. This chapter builds on scholarship about Black comedians and their mainstream appeal. In “Branding Blackness on US Cable Television,” Jennifer Fuller explores Blackness as a branding strategy and argues that cable networks not only needed Black viewers to succeed but also used Blackness as a brand to appeal to a transracial audience through “riskiness” as a signifier for Blackness.2 Tying into the manipulation of Blackness as a brand to gain mainstream appeal, I use Kristal..."
