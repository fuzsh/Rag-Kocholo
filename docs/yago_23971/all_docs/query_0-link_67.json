        "text": "Founded in 2007, CATCHPLAY quickly became a major player in movie entertainment business in Taiwan by providing a wide selection of films excelling in both quantity and quality. Over the years, CATCHPLAY has continued to distribute more than 30 films theatrically every year, an average of one movie every other week, and more than 100 titles for release on home videos, TV and digital platforms. Today, we are the largest independent distributor in Taiwan with a library of more than 2,000 titles, most of which CATCHPLAY owns all rights to exclusively.\n\nIn 2014, in addition to distributing the movies CATCHPLAY loves, we embarked in earnest co-production and investment projects, venturing into content creation. In the same year, we invested in the locally produced film, Paradise in Service and co-produced 20 Once Again with CJ Entertainment for the Chinese market. Both investments generated considerable box office performance in Taiwan and China respectively.\n\nIn early 2015, we closed a partnership deal to invest in New Regency’s three enthralling titles, namely The Revenant, Assassin’s Creed and Splinter Cell, marking the first investment of a Taiwanese company in major Hollywood productions. CATCHPLAY and partners also control exclusive distribution rights to these films in Taiwan, China, Hong Kong and Macau, with The Revenant generating outstanding box office results from these territories in 2016. In the same year, CATCHPLAY also provided financing and local production support to director Martin Scorsese’s passion project Silence, making it the first international production filmed entirely in Taiwan.\n\nToday, CATCHPLAY continues to look into investment and co-production opportunities internationally and in Asia targeting particularly Chinese-speaking territories and South East Asia following our recent expansion footprints.\n\nCATCHPLAY started placing significant emphasis on the development of digital movie content years before the others did in Taiwan. Today, we are the largest provider for premium movie content in Taiwan, aggregating content from Hollywood studios including Disney, Warner Bros., NBC Universal and Paramount in addition to having a wide selection of international independent films and leading local productions for distribution on major operators’ digital platforms.\n\nIn addition to content aggregation, in 2015, CATCHPLAY established AsiaPlay Incorporated with the ambition of becoming the leading premium content service provider for movie lovers in Asia.\n\nIn March 2016, the CATCHPLAY+ service platform made its pilot launch in Taiwan in partnerships with major telecommunication operators and device manufacturers. In June 2016, the service platform launched in Indonesia, collaborating with market leaders IndiHome, Telkom Indonesia. This was followed by expanded partnerships with Telkomsel, Indosat and First Media, and in Singapore, collaboration with the market’s leading telecommunication operator, StarHub.\n\nToday, CATCHPLAY Media Holdings Group owns two distinct companies – CATCHPLAY Incorporated, and AsiaPlay Incorporated – with involvement from production, distribution, linear movie channel operation and both content aggregation and platform operation for digital entertainment services.\n\nIn 2015, CATCHPLAY established AsiaPlay Incorporated with the ambition to become Asia’s largest movie content service provider. Instead of adopting major international players’ one ‘offer-fits-all’ strategy, we at CATCHPLAY with years of experience and passion for content, believes and embraces the importance of individual market’s unique needs and preference of content. Through our passion for movies and the belief in co-creation, internally and together with local leading operator’s partnership – we made it a mission to provide the ultimate content offering tailored for each market’s unique needs and deliver superior user experience that will be cherished by movie lovers universally.\n\nIn March 2016, the CATCHPLAY+ service made its pilot launch in Taiwan. In June 2016, the service launched in Indonesia, partnering with market leader Telkom Indonesia, and in Singapore, partnering with the market’s leading pay TV and telecommunication service provider, StarHub.\n\nToday, CATCHPLAY Media Holdings Group owns two distinct companies: CATCHPLAY Incorporated, and AsiaPlay Incorporated, with involvement from production, theatrical distribution, linear movie channel and both content aggregation and platform operation for digital entertainment services."
