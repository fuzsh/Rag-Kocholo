Both countries will take the same stance on the issue of vulnerability and will seek support for small island developing states (Sids).\n\nIt was the first occasion that the two leaders met since the passing of Sir Anerood Jugnauth, the father of PM Jugnauth. President Ramkalawan once again expressed his sincere condolences.\n\nSeychelles and Mauritius continue to share an excellent relationship and further cooperation in various areas of development will be explored."
