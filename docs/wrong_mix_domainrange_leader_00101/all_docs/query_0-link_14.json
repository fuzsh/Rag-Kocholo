        "text": "Ameenah Grib-Fakim was chosen as the country's first woman president in June 2015.\n\nShe was proposed by the prime minister's ruling coalition and approved by parliament.\n\nAt the time of her appointment, Dr Gurib-Fakim was director of the Mauritius-headquartered Centre for Phytotherapy Research (CEPHYR), which carries out research on plants for use in cosmetics, nutrition and therapy.\n\nAn alumni of the universities of Exeter and Surrey in Britain, she is also the chair of organic chemistry at Mauritius University, and has worked with the World Bank and other international institutions.\n\nDr Gurib-Fakim replaced Rajkeswur \"Kailash\" Purryag, who resigned when the new government of the Alliance LePep came to power in 2014.\n\nThe president's role is ceremonial and it is the prime minister who wields power. The previous government wanted enhanced presidential powers and had made this one of its main campaign issues.\n\nDr Gurib-Fakim's independent political leaning is in keeping with with Alliance LePep's promise to appoint an apolitical president.\n\nShe was born in 1959 and is from the country's Muslim group."
