On 14 July 2017, the Court\n\nfixed 30 January 2018 as the time-limit within which written statements may be\n\nsubmitted to the Court by the United Nations and its Member States, in accordance\n\nwith Article 66, paragraph 2 of its Statute. On 17 January 2018, the Court adopted\n\nan Order by which it extended the time-limit for the filing of written statements to\n\n1 March 2018. This Written Statement is submitted by Mauritius pursuant to the\n\nOrder of the Court.\n\n***\n\n1.2 The request from the General Assembly asks the Court to render an\n\nAdvisory Opinion on the completion of the decolonisation of Mauritius, which\n\nattained its independence on 12 March 1968. The Chagos Archipelago was\n\npurportedly detached from the colonial territory of Mauritius three years earlier, by\n\nan Order in Council dated 8 November 1965. By that time, the United Nations had\n\nplayed a central role in the process of decolonisation for the two decades since its\n\ninception.\n\n1.3 On 14 December 1960, the General Assembly adopted, by a vote of 89 votes\n\nto none, the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and\n\nPeoples (General Assembly Resolution 1514 (XV)), which proclaimed that “[a]ll\n\npeoples have the right to self-determination” and provided that “[a]ny attempt\n\naimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity and the territorial\n\nintegrity of a country is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the\n\n2\n\nCharter of the United Nations.”1 The Resolution “provided the basis for the process\n\nof decolonisation which has resulted since 1960 in the creation of many States\n\nwhich are today Members of the United Nations.”2 By the time the Chagos\n\nArchipelago was detached from Mauritius by the administering power, clear\n\nprinciples of international law had emerged to govern the process of decolonisation,\n\nchief among them the principles of self-determination and territorial integrity.\n\n1.4 These principles were not merely general guidelines or vague aspirations.\n\nThey were binding rules under international law, with corollary rights, the breach\n\nof which not only inflicted a wrong on the people concerned, but also amounted to\n\na violation of norms of paramount importance to the international community as a\n\nwhole.\n\n1.5 These rules required, at their heart, that the people of a non-self-governing\n\nterritory had a right to determine their own future. After decades – and in the case\n\nof Mauritius more than two centuries – of colonial rule, colonised peoples were, as\n\na matter of international law, finally able to take control of their own destiny,\n\ndetermining whether they wished to be independent and, if so, in what form. Selfdetermination\n\nrequired that the will of the people as a whole be freely expressed\n\nand, once expressed, respected. Territorial integrity required that a colonial territory\n\ncould not be divided or dismembered other than as a result of the freely-expressed\n\nwill of the people.\n\n1 U.N. General Assembly, 15th Session, Declaration on the granting of independence to colonial\n\ncountries and peoples, U.N. Doc. A/RES/1514(XV) (14 Dec. 1960) (hereinafter “Colonial\n\nDeclaration (14 Dec. 1960)”) (Dossier No. 55). There were only 9 abstentions.\n\n2 Western Sahara, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1975 (hereinafter “Western Sahara (Advisory\n\nOpinion)”), p. 32, para. 57. Crawford notes, in that regard, that the Colonial Declaration “has\n\nachieved in practice a quasi-constitutional status”. James Crawford, The Creation of States in\n\nInternational Law (2006) (hereinafter “Crawford, Creation of States (2006)”), p. 604 (Annex 150).\n\n3\n\n1.6 Yet despite the clarity of these principles, on 8 November 1965, the\n\nadministering power purported to dismember the territory of Mauritius. A portion\n\nof that dependent territory, the Chagos Archipelago, was detached and turned into\n\na new colony, to be known as the “British Indian Ocean Territory” (or “BIOT”).3\n\nThe Archipelago remains colonised in that form to the present day. Accordingly,\n\nalthough Mauritius gained independence in 1968, the process of decolonisation\n\nwas, and remains, incomplete. That situation is inconsistent with international law,\n\nand gives rise to continuing consequences.\n\n1.7 The detachment (or excision) of the Chagos Archipelago was carried out\n\nwithout any regard to the will of the people of Mauritius, including those who lived\n\nin the Chagos Archipelago. The administering power had already decided that the\n\nterritory would be excised and turned into a new colony, in order to allow one of\n\nits allies to build a military base on the island of Diego Garcia. This decision was\n\ntaken in secret, without any consultation with either the people of Mauritius or their\n\nrepresentatives.\n\n1.8 The excision also involved the forcible expulsion of the entire population\n\nof the Chagos Archipelago, many of whose families had lived on the islands for\n\ngenerations. The administering power attempted to cover up the expulsion with the\n\nfalse claim that the islands were uninhabited other than by a few “contract\n\nlabourers”. Almost fifty years later, the administering power expressed “regret” for\n\nthe circumstances in which the inhabitants were removed from the islands and\n\nrecognised that “what was done then should not have happened.”4 The shameful\n\n3 Mauritius does not recognise the so-called “British Indian Ocean Territory” (sometimes referred\n\nto as “BIOT”).\n\n4 Chagos Marine Protected Area Arbitration (Mauritius v. United Kingdom), Hearing on\n\nJurisdiction and the Merits, UNCLOS Annex VII Tribunal, Transcript (Day 1) (22 Apr. 2014), p.\n\n43:21-23 (Annex 169).\n\n4\n\nexpulsion caused, and continues to cause, immense suffering to this part of the\n\nMauritian population, who are commonly referred to as Chagossians. They have\n\nfought for decades for the right to return to their place of birth. Mauritius supports\n\nthe Chagossians’ right of return to the Chagos Archipelago.\n\n1.9 Fully aware that the excision would lead to international condemnation, the\n\nadministering power sought, for presentational purposes, to extract the “consent”\n\nof Mauritian Ministers at a 1965 Constitutional Conference at Lancaster House in\n\nLondon.\n\n1.10 As the contemporary records demonstrate, the choice that was given to the\n\nMauritian Ministers was, in fact, no choice at all. A meeting took place between\n\nthe British Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, and Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, the\n\nPremier of Mauritius, on 23 September 1965. A minute prepared for the Prime\n\nMinister described the purpose of the meeting with brutal clarity:\n\nSir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam is coming to see you at 10.00\n\ntomorrow morning. The object is to frighten him with hope: hope\n\nthat he might get independence; Fright lest he might not unless\n\nhe is sensible about the detachment of the Chagos Archipelago.5\n\n1.11 These words admit of no ambiguity. The Mauritian Ministers at Lancaster\n\nHouse were told in no uncertain terms that the Chagos Archipelago was going to\n\nbe detached and remain a British territory. The only question for discussion was\n\nwhether the rest of Mauritius would also remain a colony, or would attain\n\n5 U.K. Colonial Office, Note for the Prime Minister’s Meeting with Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam,\n\nPremier of Mauritius, PREM 13/3320 (22 Sept. 1965) (hereinafter “Note for the Prime Minister’s\n\nMeeting with Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, Premier of Mauritius (22 Sept. 1965)”) (emphasis\n\nadded) (Annex 59).\n\n5\n\nindependence. Faced with this non-choice, in a situation of duress, the Mauritian\n\nMinisters took independence for the rest of Mauritius.\n\n1.12 The administering power then moved swiftly to present the United Nations\n\nwith what it described as a fait accompli, noting that:\n\nFrom the United Nations point of view the timing is particularly\n\nawkward. We are already under attack over Aden and Rhodesia, and\n\nwhilst it is possible that the arrangements for detachment will be\n\nignored when they become public, it seems more likely that they\n\nwill be added to the list of ‘imperialist’ measures for which we are\n\nattacked. We shall be accused of creating a new colony in a period\n\nof decolonisation and of establishing new military bases when we\n\nshould be getting out of the old ones. If there were any chance of\n\navoiding publicity until this session of the General Assembly\n\nadjourns at Christmas there would be advantage in delaying the\n\nOrder in Council until then. But to do so would jeopardise the whole\n\nplan.\n\nThe Fourth Committee of the United Nations has now reached the\n\nitem on Miscellaneous Territories and may well discuss Mauritius\n\nand Seychelles next week. If they raise the question of defence\n\narrangements on the Indian Ocean Islands before we have detached\n\nthem, the Mauritius Government will be under considerable\n\npressure to withdraw their agreement to our proposals. Moreover we\n\nshould lay ourselves open to an additional charge of dishonesty if\n\nwe evaded the defence issue in the Fourth Committee and then made\n\nthe Order in Council immediately afterwards. It is therefore\n\nimportant that we should be able to present the U.N. with a fait\n\naccompli.6\n\n1.13 Condemnation at the U.N. was swift and strong, but the administering\n\npower, then and subsequently, ignored the international community’s calls to\n\nrestore Mauritius’ territorial integrity. These included General Assembly\n\n6 U.K. Foreign Office, Minute from Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Prime Minister, FO\n\n371/184529 (5 Nov. 1965) (hereinafter “Minute from Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Prime\n\nMinister (5 Nov. 1965)”), paras. 6-7 (emphasis in the original) (Annex 70).\n\n6\n\nResolution 2066 (XX), passed shortly after the excision, which required the\n\nadministering power “to take effective measures with a view to the immediate and\n\nfull implementation of resolution 1514 (XV)” and “to take no action which would\n\ndismember the Territory of Mauritius and violate its territorial integrity”.7 This\n\nresolution of the General Assembly was adopted decades before the full facts about\n\nwhat had happened in 1965 would come to be known.\n\n1.14 Two international judges have carefully considered these matters, in\n\nproceedings brought under Annex VII of the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of\n\nthe Sea. They concluded that, in detaching the Chagos Archipelago, the\n\nadministering power showed “a complete disregard for the territorial integrity of\n\nMauritius”.8 They expressed the view that “[t]he detachment of the Chagos\n\nArchipelago was already decided whether Mauritius gave its consent or not” and\n\nthat the Prime Minister’s “threat that Ramgoolam could return home without\n\nindependence amounts to duress”, while “[t]he Colonial Secretary equally resorted\n\nto the language of intimidation.”9 The threats and intimidation were, in their view,\n\nall the more serious since Mauritius was a colony at the time, and thus “there was\n\na clear situation of inequality between the two sides.”10 No international judge has\n\nexpressed a contrary view.\n\n7 U.N. General Assembly, 20th Session, Question of Mauritius, U.N. Doc. A/RES/2066(XX) (16\n\nDec. 1965) (hereinafter “Question of Mauritius (16 Dec. 1965)”), paras. 3-4 (Dossier No. 146).\n\n8 The Chagos Marine Protected Area Arbitration (Mauritius v. United Kingdom), Dissenting and\n\nConcurring Opinion of Judge James Kateka and Judge Rüdiger Wolfrum, UNCLOS Annex VII\n\nTribunal (18 Mar. 2015) (hereinafter “The Chagos Marine Protected Area Arbitration, Dissenting\n\nand Concurring Opinion (18 Mar. 2015)”), para. 91 (Dossier No. 409).\n\n9 Ibid., paras. 76-77.\n\n10 Ibid., para. 77.\n\n7\n\nI. The involvement of the U.N. General Assembly\n\n1.15 The U.N., and in particular the General Assembly, has played a central role\n\nin the decolonisation process, under its Charter mandate. Its practice on\n\ndecolonisation, and its central role in relation to Mauritius in particular, are\n\nreviewed in the chapters which follow. Thus it was entirely appropriate for the\n\nGeneral Assembly to continue to take up the issue of the decolonisation of\n\nMauritius by way of this request for an Advisory Opinion. The process by which\n\nthis came about is as follows.\n\n1.16 On 16 September 2016, the General Assembly adopted its Agenda for the\n\n71st session, which included at item 87: “Request for an advisory opinion of the\n\nInternational Court of Justice on the legal consequences of the separation of the\n\nChagos Archipelago from Mauritius in 1965.”11 This item was included on the\n\nunderstanding that there would be no consideration of the matter before June 2017,\n\nin order to allow for Mauritius and the administering power to consult on the\n\ncompletion of the decolonisation of Mauritius.12 In March 2017 the administering\n\npower expressed the view that the decolonisation process of Mauritius was\n\ncompleted at the time it granted independence to Mauritius and that it had lawfully\n\ndetached the Chagos Archipelago.\n\n1.17 Consequently, on 1 June 2017, the Permanent Representative of Mauritius\n\nto the U.N. in New York wrote to the President of the General Assembly, requesting\n\nthat a date be set for the consideration of Agenda item 87 by the General\n\n11 U.N. General Assembly, 71st Session, Agenda of the seventy-first session of the General\n\nAssembly, U.N. Doc. A/71/251 (16 Sept. 2016) (Annex 184).\n\n12 Talks were held on 9 November 2016, 2 February 2017 and 7 March 2017.\n\n8\n\nAssembly.13 The President of the General Assembly decided to convene a meeting\n\non 22 June 2017.14\n\n1.18 On 15 June 2017, the Republic of Congo, acting on behalf of the Group of\n\nAfrican States, submitted a draft resolution to the U.N. Secretariat.\n\n1.19 On 22 June 2017, the U.N. General Assembly, by a vote of 94 to 15, adopted\n\nResolution 71/292, by which the Court was requested to render the present\n\nAdvisory Opinion pursuant to Article 65 of its Statute.15 The resolution was\n\nopposed by only two of the five Permanent Members of the Security Council, one\n\nof which was the administering power.\n\n1.20 Introducing the draft resolution at the plenary meeting, the representative of\n\nthe Republic of Congo explained that:\n\nAs everyone is aware, the right to self-determination and the\n\ncompletion of the decolonization process continue to be a central\n\nconcern of the United Nations as a whole. That is why we firmly\n\nbelieve that the United Nations would benefit from the guidance of\n\na principal judicial organ of the United Nations on the\n\ndecolonization process with respect to the two questions posed in\n\nthe draft resolution. An advisory opinion of the International Court\n\nof Justice would assist the General Assembly in its work and would\n\ncontribute to the promotion of the international rule of law.16\n\n13 Letter from H.E. Mr Jagdish Koonjul, Ambassador and Permanent Representative of the Republic\n\nof Mauritius to the United Nations, to H.E. Mr Peter Thomson, President of the 71st session of the\n\nUnited Nations General Assembly (1 June 2017) (Annex 191).\n\n14 Letter from H.E. Mr Peter Thomson, President of the 71st session of the United Nations General\n\nAssembly, to all Permanent Representatives and Permanent Observers of the United Nations in New\n\nYork (1 June 2017) (Annex 192).\n\n15 There were 65 abstentions.\n\n16 U.N. General Assembly, 71st Session, 88th Plenary Meeting, Agenda item 87: Request for an\n\nadvisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the legal consequences of the separation\n\n9\n\n1.21 The representative of Mauritius, Sir Anerood Jugnauth, the only surviving\n\nmember of the Mauritian delegation to the Constitutional Conference in London in\n\n1965, stated that:\n\nThe position that the administering Power brought about in 1965\n\nremains unchanged today. Consequently, as there is no prospect of\n\nany end to the colonization of Mauritius, the General Assembly has\n\na continuing responsibility to act. More than five decades have\n\npassed and now is the time to act.\n\nIt is fitting for the General Assembly to fulfil that function on the\n\nbasis of guidance from the International Court of Justice as to the\n\nlegality of the excision of the Chagos Archipelago in 1965. The draft\n\nresolution before the General Assembly contains two legal questions\n\nwhich are linked to the issue of decolonization – a matter of direct\n\ninterest to the General Assembly. An advisory opinion would no\n\ndoubt contribute significantly to the work of the General Assembly\n\nin fulfilling its functions under Chapters XI to XIII of the Charter of\n\nthe United Nations.\n\n…\n\nThe vote on the draft resolution before the General Assembly would\n\nbe a vote in support of completing the process of decolonization,\n\nrespect for international law and the rule of law, and respect for the\n\ninternational institutions that we States Members of the United\n\nNations have created. It is also a vote of confidence in the\n\nInternational Court of Justice, the principal judicial organ of the\n\nUnited Nations.17\n\n1.22 The representative of Venezuela, speaking on behalf of the Non-Aligned\n\nMovement (“NAM”), expressed the “unshakable” support of NAM for all\n\nof the Chagos archipelago from Mauritius in 1965, U.N. Doc. A/71/PV.88 (22 June 2017), p. 6\n\n(Dossier No. 6).\n\n17 Ibid., pp. 7-8.\n\n10\n\ndecolonisation initiatives, including in the case of Mauritius “any action that might\n\nbe taken in this regard by the General Assembly.”18\n\n1.23 The representative of India noted that, when the United Nations was\n\nestablished in 1945, “almost a third of the world’s population lived in territories\n\nthat were non-self-governing and dependent on colonial Powers.”19 However,\n\nAs a result of the sustained collective efforts of the United Nations\n\nmembership, today fewer than 2 million people live in non-selfgoverning\n\nterritories, according to United Nations documentation.\n\nSince the creation of the United Nations, more than 80 former\n\ncolonies have gained their independence and taken their rightful\n\nplace in the General Assembly. However, the process of\n\ndecolonization that began with our own independence is still\n\nunfinished, seven decades later. In fact, in 2011 the Assembly\n\nproclaimed the decade 2011-2020 to be the third International\n\nDecade for the Eradication of Colonialism. We would like to see\n\nthat long-drawn-out process concluded.20\n\n1.24 The representative of Egypt stated that “this is one of the pending issues\n\nthat are preventing us from putting an end to colonization, and we therefore hope\n\nthat we can find an appropriate solution to it that accords with the Charter of the\n\nUnited Nations and the principles of international law.”21\n\n1.25 The representative of Kenya stated that:\n\nThe historical injustice and deep scars of the human rights abuses\n\nthat have accompanied the occupation and exploitation of the\n\narchipelago demand that all nations that believe in the principles of\n\nthe Charter of the United Nations should stand up to be counted in\n\n18 Ibid., p. 9.\n\n19 Ibid., p. 14.\n\n20 Ibid.\n\n21 Ibid.\n\n11\n\nsupport of today’s draft resolution. After all, all that is being asked\n\nfor here is an advisory opinion from the International Court of\n\nJustice – a mere advisory opinion of an international court that we\n\nall respect. What could possibly be so unpalatable about that? There\n\ncan be no difference, indeed no moral or ethical space, between a\n\ncommitment to human rights today and the correction of grave\n\nhistorical injustices perpetrated in the past, no matter how\n\nembarrassing or how high the cost. We believe that our civilization\n\nand our membership in the United Nations demand this of us.22\n\n1.26 The representative of Brazil stated that:\n\nDecolonization constitutes one of the unfinished tasks of the United\n\nNations and is therefore an issue of interest to the international\n\ncommunity as a whole. The General Assembly has a crucial role to\n\nplay in advancing the progress of decolonization. One of the tools at\n\nits disposal, as set out in the Charter of the United Nations, is to\n\nrequest that the International Court of Justice provide clarification\n\non legal issues through its advisory jurisdiction.\n\nA vote in favour of this resolution does not mean a commitment to\n\nany particular interpretation of the underlying issue. It means a\n\nrequest for the principal legal body of the United Nations to provide,\n\nthrough a non-binding opinion, legal elements that may guide all\n\nparties to definitively settle this question.23\n\nII. The questions posed by the U.N. General Assembly\n\n1.27 As Resolution 71/292 makes clear, the Advisory Opinion requested by the\n\nGeneral Assembly is intended to provide it with legal guidance which is necessary\n\nto enable it to address matters that have long been among its highest priorities.\n\nThese include the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples; the\n\nprotection of colonial peoples’ inalienable rights to sovereignty, national unity and\n\nterritorial integrity; and the full and immediate implementation of Resolution 1514\n\n22 Ibid., p. 15.\n\n23 Ibid., p. 21.\n\n12\n\n(XV), as well as compliance with Resolution 2066 (XX). As the voting record\n\nshows, the request for an Advisory Opinion comes before the Court with the\n\noverwhelming support of U.N. Member States, 94 of whom voted for the resolution\n\nwhile only 15 opposed it.24\n\n1.28 As Mauritius explains in Chapter 5 below, the Court plainly has jurisdiction\n\nto answer the questions posed by the General Assembly, and there are powerful\n\nreasons why it should exercise its discretion to do so, rather than denying the\n\nGeneral Assembly the benefit of the legal opinion which it has sought. Further, the\n\ntwo questions are inextricably linked and, in Mauritius’ submission, the Court must\n\nanswer both of them.\n\n1.29 In setting out its observations on the two questions before the Court,\n\nMauritius proceeds on the basis that the request, and in particular the second\n\nquestion, is forward-looking. Accordingly, while Mauritius fully reserves all its\n\nrights in relation to the administering power’s prior wrongful conduct, as well as\n\nthe consequences thereof, it does not itself ask the Court to address issues of\n\ncompensation or reparation for that conduct, although the Court is of course free to\n\ndo so if it considers this necessary in answering the second question. For its part,\n\nMauritius’ focus in approaching the second question is first and foremost on the\n\nneed for the wrongful situation to be brought to an immediate end, in conformity\n\nwith well-established principles of international law.\n\n1.30 It is important to underscore that, since it attained independence almost\n\nexactly 50 years ago, Mauritius has been a peaceful, stable democracy, with\n\nexcellent relations with all States interested in the questions referred to the Court.\n\n24 Ibid., p. 18.\n\n13\n\nIt is committed to the rule of law, to the maintenance of international peace and\n\nsecurity, and to the protection of the environment. Its firm commitment to these\n\nobjectives underlines that this request for an Advisory Opinion is not intended to\n\nbring into question the existence of the military base on Diego Garcia, or to\n\nundermine the protection of the environment of the Chagos Archipelago. In\n\nparticular:\n\ni. Defence and security: Mauritius recognises the existence of the military\n\nbase on Diego Garcia and has repeatedly made clear to the United States\n\nand the United Kingdom that it accepts the future operation of the base\n\nin accordance with international law.25\n\nii. The protection of the environment: Mauritius has been a responsible\n\nguardian of the other areas of great environmental importance within its\n\nterritory, and has clearly stated its commitment to protecting the\n\nenvironment of the Chagos Archipelago to the highest possible\n\nstandard.26\n\n25 See Chapter 7, Part III.

Summary of Mauritius’ Written Statement\n\n1.31 Mauritius’ Written Statement is in seven chapters. Following this\n\nintroductory chapter, Chapters 2-4 set out a summary of the relevant facts, and\n\nChapters 5-7 address the legal issues.\n\n1.32 Chapter 2 examines Mauritius’ geography and colonial history. Mauritius\n\nwas first occupied by the Dutch between 1638 and 1710, then colonised by France\n\nfrom 1715 to 1810, followed by 157 years of British colonial rule, from 3 December\n\n1810 until Mauritius’ independence on 12 March 1968. During the period of French\n\ncolonial rule, the Chagos Archipelago was administered as part of the colony of\n\nMauritius.27 This continued without interruption throughout the entirety of the\n\nperiod of British colonial rule. In law and in practice, therefore, the Chagos\n\nArchipelago has always been – and has been treated as – an integral part of\n\nMauritius.28\n\n1.33 Chapter 3 addresses factual matters which are central to the present\n\nrequest. It considers the decolonisation of Mauritius, from the limited measures of\n\nself-government in the early 1940s to the 1965 Constitutional Conference in\n\nLondon, when the British Government announced that it had reached the\n\nConservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds 1995; the Kyoto Protocol 1998; the\n\nMemorandum of Understanding on the Conservation and Management of Marine Turtles and Their\n\nHabitats of the Indian Ocean and South-East Asia 2001; the Paris Agreement 2015; and the\n\nMinamata Convention on Mercury 2017.

Mauritius’ struggle for independence, and the concurrent development\n\nof a secret plan to detach the Chagos Archipelago;\n\nii. The talks with Mauritian Ministers at the 1965 Constitutional\n\nConference in London at which the colonial authorities were to decide\n\non Mauritius’ final status;\n\niii. The U.K.’s undertakings to the Mauritian Government, and the\n\nsubsequent detachment of the Chagos Archipelago by Order in Council;\n\niv. The 1966 agreement by which the administering power made the island\n\nof Diego Garcia available to a military ally for an indefinite period, for\n\nthe establishment of a military base; and\n\nv. The forcible expulsion of the Chagossians.\n\n1.34 Chapter 4 proceeds to describe the reactions and responses to the purported\n\ndetachment of the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius, over the half century that\n\nhas since passed. It includes the statements and actions of Mauritius itself, of the\n\nUnited Nations, and of important groups of States, including: the Organisation of\n\nAfrican Unity and the African Union; the Non-Aligned Movement; the Group of\n\n77 and China; the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States; and the Africa-\n\nSouth America Summit. It also describes the reactions of Mauritius and the\n\n29 United Kingdom, Mauritius Constitutional Conference Report (24 Sept. 1965) (hereinafter\n\n“Mauritius Constitutional Conference Report (24 Sept. 1965)”), p. 5, para. 20 (Annex 64).\n\n16\n\ninternational community to the forcible removal of all the inhabitants of the Chagos\n\nArchipelago, and the prevention of their return by the United Kingdom ever since.\n\n1.35 Moving on to the legal issues, Chapter 5 addresses the jurisdiction of the\n\nCourt to render the advisory opinion that has been requested, and the propriety of\n\nits doing so.\n\n1.36 The first part of the Chapter shows that the Court has jurisdiction to render\n\nthe Advisory Opinion, because the General Assembly is an organ duly authorised\n\nto seek an Advisory Opinion from the Court, and because the request raises\n\nquestions of a legal character.\n\n1.37 The Chapter then demonstrates that there are no reasons for the Court to\n\ndecline to render an opinion on the matters which the General Assembly has placed\n\nbefore it. There is no “compelling reason” for the Court to decline to exercise the\n\nadvisory jurisdiction which the Charter and the Statute have conferred upon it, and,\n\non this basis and in keeping with all relevant precedents, it should exercise that\n\njurisdiction and render the opinion which the General Assembly has sought.\n\n1.38 As Mauritius sets out in greater detail below, it has for decades sought to\n\nbring the colonisation of the Chagos Archipelago to an end, raising the matter in a\n\nrange of international fora as well as directly with the administering power. That\n\ndoes not make the dispute a “bilateral” one: although plainly any ongoing unlawful\n\ncolonisation will give rise to a sovereignty dispute between the State whose\n\nterritory is colonised and the administering power, this does not remove the matter\n\nfrom the advisory jurisdiction of the Court. Otherwise the perverse result would be\n\nthat some of the most important legal issues in the international legal order could\n\n17\n\nnot be the subject of advice from the Court in accordance with its advisory function:\n\nthis is not a result which would assist either the U.N. or its Member States.\n\n1.39 The Court’s response to the first question would assist the General\n\nAssembly in establishing whether under international law the process of\n\ndecolonisation of Mauritius was lawfully completed when Mauritius was granted\n\nindependence in 1968, or whether the excision of the Chagos Archipelago from\n\nMauritius by the administering power, and the continued exercise of colonial\n\nauthority over the “British Indian Ocean Territory”, prevents the lawful\n\ndecolonisation of Mauritius from being completed.\n\n1.40 The Court’s response to the second question – which is inextricably\n\nconnected to the first question – is necessary for the General Assembly to determine\n\nwhat legal consequences under international law follow from the continued\n\nadministration of the Chagos Archipelago by the administering power. This\n\nincludes, but is not limited to, the ongoing inability of Mauritius to implement a\n\nprogramme for the resettlement of its nationals, in particular those of Chagossian\n\norigin in the Chagos Archipelago.\n\n1.41 In Chapter 6, Mauritius addresses the first question before the Court. The\n\nChapter reviews and analyses the law of decolonisation, from its origins through its\n\ndevelopment over the course of the last century, and then applies the law to the\n\nspecific situation of Mauritius’ own incomplete decolonisation. In summary:\n\ni. The main legal obligation in respect of decolonisation is that it must\n\naccord fully with the right of self-determination under international law.\n\nii. The right of self-determination had already been firmly established by\n\nthe time of Mauritius’ independence in 1968 (and indeed by the time of\n\n18\n\nthe excision of the Chagos Archipelago in 1965), including in the work\n\nof the United Nations in supervising the process of decolonisation.\n\niii. Self-determination required the free and genuine consent of the\n\npopulation concerned – for example as expressed through\n\nreferenda/plebiscites – so as to determine the future of the territory. This\n\nwas particularly so in cases in which straightforward independence of\n\nthe non-self-governing territory as a single unit was not envisaged.\n\niv. A corollary to this was that self-determination should not be impeded\n\nby the arbitrary division (or dismemberment, or excision) of territory\n\nbefore independence. The division of territory was legitimate only in\n\ncases in which it ensued as a consequence of the freely expressed\n\nconsent of the people concerned.\n\nv. The right of self-determination applied to the entire territory of\n\nMauritius, including the Chagos Archipelago. However, the Chagos\n\nArchipelago was excised from the territory of Mauritius by the\n\nadministering power in service of its own interests rather than those of\n\nthe Mauritian people, who were never given an opportunity to express\n\ntheir wishes as to the proposed division and dismemberment of the\n\nterritory.\n\nvi. The pressure placed upon Mauritian Ministers at the Constitutional\n\nConference in 1965, in which it was made clear by the administering\n\npower that independence was only available with the excision of the\n\nChagos Archipelago, vitiated any purported consent on the part of the\n\nMauritian people or their representatives.\n\nvii. As a consequence, Mauritius came to independence in 1968 with its\n\nterritory having been dismembered less than three years earlier.\n\n19\n\nDismembering Mauritius’ territory shortly prior to independence,\n\nwithout the freely-expressed consent of the people, prevented Mauritius\n\nfrom the effective exercise of its right of self-determination and violated\n\nits associated right of territorial integrity, with effect from 1968 and at\n\nall times thereafter.\n\nviii. The inescapable conclusion is that the decolonisation of Mauritius was\n\nnot lawfully completed in 1968. At the point when Mauritius came to\n\nindependence with its territory having been dismembered, an\n\ninternationally wrongful situation crystallised. That wrongful situation\n\nhas continued to this day.\n\n1.42 Chapter 7 then examines the consequences of this situation, in response to\n\nthe second question before the Court, which is inextricably connected to the first.\n\nThe question requests the Court’s legal opinion on the legal consequences that arise,\n\nincluding, but not limited to, those that pertain to the resettlement of Mauritian\n\nnationals, in particular those of Chagossian origin, in the Chagos Archipelago. As\n\nChapter 7 explains, Mauritius considers that the main legal consequences may be\n\nsummarised as follows:\n\ni. The failure to complete the decolonisation of Mauritius is a continuing\n\nwrongful act that persists to this day. This situation must be brought to\n\nan end and full legality restored, a result that can only be achieved by\n\nthe completion of the process of decolonisation as required by\n\ninternational law. Decolonisation will be complete when the colonial\n\nadministration has been fully withdrawn from the Chagos Archipelago,\n\nMauritius is able to exercise full rights of sovereignty, and the\n\nadministering power recognises Mauritius’ sovereignty over the\n\nArchipelago.\n\n20\n\nii. In regard to the timeframe for completing the process of decolonisation,\n\nMauritius notes that the Court stated in its Namibia Advisory Opinion\n\nthat the colonial administration must be withdrawn “immediately”.30\n\nThis temporal obligation is reinforced by the principle that all colonial\n\narrangements must be brought to a speedy end.\n\niii. Decolonisation elsewhere demonstrates that this can be achieved\n\nquickly, often in less than a year. That is so even when the process is\n\nmuch more complex than is the case with the Chagos Archipelago,\n\nwhere the existing colonial administration is minimal.\n\niv. The existence of a military base on Diego Garcia provides no basis for\n\ndelaying the immediate completion of decolonisation. Mauritius\n\nrecognises the existence of the base and accepts its future operation in\n\naccordance with international law.\n\nv. In addition, and in particular, the administering power must cooperate\n\nwith Mauritius to facilitate its efforts to resettle, as a matter of urgency,\n\nMauritian nationals of Chagossian origin in the Archipelago and to\n\nensure the access of other Mauritian citizens to the Archipelago.\n\nvi. Pending the immediate completion of decolonisation, the administering\n\npower is under a legal obligation to act in the best interests of the people\n\nof Mauritius. In order to effectuate the transfer of administrative\n\nresponsibilities to Mauritius in an orderly and timely manner, the\n\nadministering power must consult and cooperate with Mauritius to\n\nensure that: (a) the Chagos Archipelago is administered in a manner\n\n30 See Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South\n\nWest Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion, I.C.J.\n\nReports 1971 (hereinafter “South West Africa (Advisory Opinion)”), p. 58, para. 133.\n\n21\n\nwhich promotes the economic well-being of the Mauritian people; (b)\n\nMauritius is afforded access to its natural resources; (c) the environment\n\nof the Chagos Archipelago is fully protected; (d) Mauritius participates\n\nin the authorisation, oversight and regulation of scientific research in\n\nand around the Archipelago; (e) Mauritius is allowed to make\n\nsubmissions to the U.N. Commission on the Limits of the Continental\n\nShelf in regard to the Archipelago; and (f) Mauritius is able to proceed\n\nto a delimitation of the Archipelago’s maritime boundaries with the\n\nMaldives.\n\nvii. Third States and international organisations, including the United\n\nNations, are under an obligation to assist in the completion of the\n\nprocess of decolonisation, and may not render any aid or assistance that\n\nwould help maintain the illegal situation presented by the continued\n\ncolonial administration of the Chagos Archipelago. The duty to assist in\n\ncompleting Mauritius’ decolonisation is a positive one.\n\n1.43 Mauritius is respectful of the fact that in addition to the matters it has raised\n\nand is principally concerned with, the Court may itself identify additional matters\n\nwhich it considers should be addressed, in responding to the second question. This\n\nWritten Statement is accompanied by four volumes of Annexes, comprising\n\ndocuments which may be of assistance to the Court and that are not included in the\n\nDossier which the Secretariat of the United Nations has compiled for the purposes\n\nof the present Request.\n\n22\n\n23\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nGEOGRAPHY AND COLONIAL HISTORY\n\nI. Introduction\n\n2.1 This Chapter addresses matters of geography, as well as early and colonial\n\nhistory. Mauritius was first occupied by the Dutch between 1638 and 1710, then\n\ncolonised by France from 1715 to 1810, followed by 157 years of British colonial\n\nrule, from 3 December 1810 until Mauritius’ independence on 12 March 1968.\n\nDuring the period of French colonial rule, the Chagos Archipelago was\n\nadministered as part of the colony of Mauritius.31 This continued without\n\ninterruption throughout the entire period of British colonial rule. In law and in\n\npractice, the Chagos Archipelago has always been an integral part of Mauritius.32\n\nII. Geography\n\n2.2 The Republic of Mauritius comprises a group of islands in the Indian Ocean,\n\nwhich collectively amount to approximately 1,950 square kilometres. The main\n\nIsland of Mauritius is located approximately 900 kilometres east of Madagascar.\n\nThe capital, Port Louis, is located on that island.\n\n2.3 In addition to the main Island, the Republic of Mauritius includes the islands\n\nof Cargados Carajos (the St. Brandon Group of 16 islands and islets), which lie 402\n\nkilometres north; Rodrigues Island, situated 560 kilometres to the north-east;\n\nAgalega, located 933 kilometres to the north; Tromelin, 580 kilometres to the north-\n\n31 The Chagos Marine Protected Area Arbitration, Award (18 Mar. 2015), para. 58 (Dossier No.\n\n409).\n\n32 See Part IV below.\n\n24\n\nwest; and the Chagos Archipelago, located approximately 2,200 kilometres to the\n\nnorth-east.33 The Chagos Archipelago is approximately 517 kilometres from\n\nMaldives, with which it shares a maritime boundary, and 9,114 kilometres to the\n\nsouth-east of the United Kingdom.\n\n2.4 The Chagos Archipelago is composed of numerous atolls and islands. In the\n\nnorth are Peros Banhos, Salomon Islands and Nelsons Island; in the south-west are\n\nThree Brothers, Eagle, Egmont and Danger Islands. Diego Garcia lies in the southeast\n\npart of the Archipelago. The largest individual islands are Diego Garcia (27.20\n\nsquare kilometres), Eagle (Great Chagos Bank, 2.45 square kilometres), île Pierre\n\n(Peros Banhos, 1.50 square kilometres), Eastern Egmont (Egmont Islands, 1.50\n\nsquare kilometres), île du Coin (Peros Banhos, 1.28 square kilometres) and île\n\nBoddam (Salomon Islands, 1.08 square kilometres).\n\n33 See The Constitution of the Republic of Mauritius (12 Mar. 1968) (as amended, including by the\n\nConstitution of Mauritius (Amendment No. 3) Act of 17 Dec. 1991), Section 111(1) (Annex 96).\n\n60°E 65°E 70°E 75°E 80°E\n\n55°E\n\n55°E\n\n60°E 65°E 70°E 75°E 80°E\n\n40°E 45°E 50°E\n\n5°N\n\n0°\n\n5°S\n\n10°S\n\n15°S\n\n20°S\n\n25°S\n\n5°S\n\n10°S\n\n15°S\n\n20°S\n\n25°S\n\nI N D I A N\n\nO C E A N\n\nETHIOPIA\n\nSOMALIA\n\nMADAGASCAR\n\nSRI\n\nLANKA\n\nIsland of Mauritius\n\nCOMOROS\n\nREPUBLIC OF MAURITIUS\n\nREPUBLIC OF\n\nMAURITIUS\n\nTromelin I.\n\nGlorioso I.\n\nMayotte I.\n\nJuan de Nova I.\n\nEuropa I.\n\nRéunion I.\n\n(FRANCE)\n\nBassas da India I.\n\nSEYCHELLES\n\nMALDIVES\n\nRodrigues I.\n\nAgalega\n\nCargados\n\nCarajos\n\nShoals\n\nChagos\n\nArchipelago\n\nDiego Garcia\n\nPeros Banhos Salomon Is.\n\nEgmont Is.\n\nPrepared by: International Mapping\n\nTHE LOCATION OF THE\n\nREPUBLIC OF MAURITIUS\n\nMercator Projection\n\nWGS-84 Datum\n\n(Scale accurate at 10°S)\n\n0 50 100 150\n\nNautical Miles\n\n200 250\n\n0 100 200 300 400 500\n\nKilometers\n\nCoastal Data: NOAA’s GSHHS coastal database (version 2.2.0) & NGA charts 702, 61550, 61551,\n\n61591, 61601 & 61610.\n\nFigure 1\n\n26\n\nChagos\n\nArchipelago\n\nINDIAN\n\nOCEAN\n\n72°E\n\n72°E\n\n70°E\n\n4°S\n\n6°S\n\n8°S\n\n4°S\n\n6°S\n\n8°S\n\nEgmont Is.\n\nDanger I.\n\nEagle Is.\n\nNelsons I.\n\nDiego Garcia\n\nPeros Banhos Salomon Is.\n\nWest I.

Early and colonial history\n\n2.6 The available evidence indicates that Mauritius was known to Arab sailors\n\nas early as the 10th century,35 and that Phoenician sailors, as well as Malays and\n\nIndonesians, may have visited the island even earlier.36 In the late 15th and 16th\n\ncenturies Portuguese expeditions came to the Indian Ocean,37 including that of\n\nVasco da Gama, who in 1498 rounded the Cape of Good Hope to enter the Indian\n\nOcean.38 Diogo Dias, a Portuguese captain, is said to have discovered Mauritius in\n\nJuly 1500.39 The Island and its neighbours were collectively known as the\n\n34 See Republic of Mauritius, Ministry of Finance & Economic Development, Mauritius in Figures\n\n(2016), p. 8 (Annex 177).

The Chagos\n\nArchipelago (known to the Portuguese as Chagas) was discovered by Diego García\n\nde Moguer, although it did not appear on Portuguese maps until 1538.40\n\n2.7 Despite numerous expeditions, the Portuguese showed no interest in\n\ncolonising any of the islands discovered in the Indian Ocean, and Mauritius,\n\nincluding the Chagos Archipelago, remained uninhabited. At the end of the 16th\n\ncentury, the Dutch and English arrived in the Indian Ocean and respectively\n\nestablished the Dutch and English East India companies to challenge the Portuguese\n\ncommercial hegemony.\n\n2.8 In 1598 Dutch admiral Wybrandt van Warwyck landed at Grand Port in\n\nsouth-west Mauritius and took possession of the island, naming it in honour of\n\nMaurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange.41 The Dutch made no attempt to colonise\n\nMauritius for a number of years, opting instead for Indonesia as their first\n\npermanent establishment in the region.42 In 1638 agents for the Dutch East India\n\nCompany occupied Mauritius, together with a contingent of convicts and slaves\n\nfrom Indonesia and Madagascar. This first attempt to establish a permanent\n\nsettlement and colonise Mauritius lasted only 20 years, primarily motivated by a\n\ndesire to counter British and French plans to do so.43 The Dutch abandoned\n\nMauritius in 1710 and the French took control of the island in 1715, renaming it Île\n\n40 Auguste Toussaint, History of Mauritius, 8th Ed., Macmillan (1977), p. 16.\n\n41 Addison & Hazareesingh, History of Mauritius (1993), p. 3 (Annex 137).\n\n42 Auguste Toussaint, History of Mauritius, 8th Ed., Macmillan (1977), p. 19.\n\n43 Ibid.\n\n31\n\nde France. The Chagos Archipelago remained largely untouched during this period\n\nand was rarely visited by Europeans.44\n\n2.9 In 1744 a Dutch captain, van Keulen, reported the position of Diego Garcia,\n\nand slaves were sought from Mozambique and Madagascar to work on coconut\n\nplantations on the larger islands of the Chagos Archipelago. The first slave colony\n\nwas likely situated on Peros Banhos. The French surveyed the Archipelago in the\n\n1740s, and claimed Diego Garcia in 1769. Permanent settlement on Diego Garcia\n\nappears to have come about through a concession granted in 1783 by the French\n\ncolonial government in Île de France to a prominent French planter, Pierre Marie\n\nNormande.45 However, there is also a historical account of the grant of Diego\n\nGarcia by the French Governor in Île de France to Mr Dupuit de la Faye, in 1778.46\n\n2.10 A coconut plantation society was gradually established in the Chagos\n\nArchipelago by commercial enterprises under further concessions granted by the\n\nFrench authorities in Île de France. Lying only 4-8° from the Equator, the climate\n\nof the Chagos Archipelago was well suited to the cultivation of coconuts and, unlike\n\nthe Island of Mauritius further to the south, the Archipelago was less threatened by\n\ntropical cyclones. The Chagos Archipelago became dependent on the coconut\n\nplantations for the production of copra (dried coconut flesh used to produce coconut\n\noil).47 Most of the copra was sent from the Chagos Archipelago to Île de France,\n\n44 Richard Edis, Peak of Limuria: The Story of Diego Garcia (1993) (hereinafter “Edis, Peak of\n\nLimuria (1993)”), p. 24 (Annex 136).\n\n45 David Vine, Island of Shame: The Secret History of the U.S. Military Base on Diego Garcia\n\n(2009) (hereinafter “Vine, Island of Shame (2009)”), p. 23 (Annex 151).\n\n46 Edis, Peak of Limuria (1993), p. 28 (Annex 136).\n\n47 Coconut oil was of such importance to the Chagos Archipelago that the Archipelago has been\n\nhistorically referred to as the “Oil Islands”.\n\n32\n\nbut some coconut oil is known to have been extracted in Diego Garcia from 1793.48\n\nDuring this period France was at war with Britain, and a British blockade caused a\n\nsignificant rise in oil prices, spurring businessmen in Île de France to establish\n\nmore coconut plantations on Diego Garcia and the outlying islands.49\n\n2.11 The French and British surveyed and mapped the islands of the Chagos\n\nArchipelago in the later stages of the 18th century, as they became prizes fought\n\nover by the two powers. A British party from the British East India Company set\n\noff from Bombay in March 1786 with the intention of colonising Diego Garcia to\n\nestablish a provisions station. The British expedition landed on Diego Garcia in\n\nApril of that year and were surprised to come across French planters. The French\n\nplanters retreated to Île de France and the British expedition took possession of the\n\nisland, claiming it for Britain.50\n\n2.12 On the news of the British expedition, the French Governor in Mauritius,\n\nVicomte de Souillac, sent a letter of protest to the British authorities in Bombay\n\nand a French warship set off for the Chagos Archipelago.51 To avoid any conflict\n\nwith the French, the British Governor in Bombay, Rawson Hart Boddam, instructed\n\nthe British expedition to evacuate Diego Garcia immediately.52 Following the\n\ndeparture of the British expedition, the French erected a stone marker on Diego\n\nGarcia to proclaim France’s sovereignty over the island.53 Throughout the period\n\n48 Edis, Peak of Limuria (1993), p. 32 (Annex 136).

Article VIII refers collectively to the cession of\n\nMauritius and its dependencies:\n\nHis Britannic Majesty, stipulating for himself and his Allies,\n\nengages to restore to His Most Christian Majesty, within the term\n\nwhich shall be hereafter fixed, the Colonies, Fisheries, Factories,\n\nand Establishments of every kind which were possessed by France\n\non the 1st of January, 1792, in the Seas and on the Continents of\n\nAmerica, Africa, and Asia; with the exception, however, of the\n\nIslands of Tobago and St. Lucie, and of the Isle of France and its\n\nDependencies, especially Rodrigues and Les Séchelles, which\n\nseveral Colonies and Possessions His Most Christian Majesty cedes\n\nin full right and Sovereignty to His Britannic Majesty, and also the\n\nportion of St. Domingo ceded to France by the Treaty of Basle, and\n\nwhich His Most Christian Majesty restores in full right and\n\nSovereignty to His Catholic Majesty.55\n\n2.14 After the British conquest of 1810, Île de France was renamed Mauritius.\n\nMauritius largely retained French laws, customs, culture, religion, language, and\n\nway of life. Britain remained the administering power from 1810 until Mauritius’\n\nindependence in 1968.\n\n54 The Chagos Marine Protected Area Arbitration, Award (18 Mar. 2015), para. 58 (Dossier No.\n\n409).\n\n55 Treaty of Paris (30 May 1814) (Dossier No. 445).\n\n34\n\nIV. The Chagos Archipelago has always been an integral part of the\n\nterritory of Mauritius\n\n2.15 Like the French before them, the British administered the Chagos\n\nArchipelago as a dependency of Mauritius, with the Archipelago treated as an\n\nintegral part of Mauritius without interruption throughout the entire period of\n\ncolonial rule. The Chagos Archipelago was connected to and administered in law\n\nas a part of Mauritius until it was detached by Order in Council on 8 November\n\n1965.56 The close and inextricable connection between the Chagos Archipelago and\n\nthe rest of the territory of Mauritius is evidenced by inter alia (i) constitutional,\n\nlegislative and administrative arrangements; (ii) economic, cultural and social\n\nlinks; and (iii) conduct, practice and statements of the administering power, the\n\nUnited Nations, the international community, and domestic and international\n\nauthorities.\n\nA. CONSTITUTIONAL, LEGISLATIVE AND ADMINISTRATIVE ARRANGEMENTS\n\n2.16 By the 1814 Treaty of Paris, Mauritius and its dependencies – including the\n\nChagos Archipelago – were formally ceded to the U.K. by France. The islands of\n\nthe Chagos Archipelago were included by the British colonial authorities in a list\n\nof dependencies of Mauritius as early as 1826.57 The Chagos Archipelago remained\n\na dependency of Mauritius throughout British colonial rule, until the Archipelago\n\n56 See Chapter 3, Part VIII.\n\n57 See Sir Lowry Cole’s Despatch from Mauritius, List of Dependencies (British) of Mauritius\n\n(1826), FCO 31/3836 (19 Sept. 1826) (Annex 1).

In 1815 the first British\n\nGovernor of Mauritius, Sir Robert Farquhar, issued a proclamation by which\n\nBritish Acts of Parliament abolishing the slave trade “extend to every, even the\n\nmost remote and minute portion, of the Possession, Dominions and Dependencies\n\nof Her Majesty’s Government”.62 By virtue of Ordinances of 1852 and 1853, the\n\n58 See, e.g., Governor of Mauritius and the Council of Government, Courts Ordinance No. 5, 1945\n\n(3 Mar. 1945), Section 2 (Annex 12).\n\n59 Letters Patent, Section 52 (16 Sept. 1885) (emphasis added) (Annex 8).\n\n60 The Mauritius (Legislative Council) Order in Council, 1947 (19 Dec. 1947), Section 1(1)\n\n(emphasis added) (Annex 13); Mauritius (Constitution) Order in Council, 1958 (30 July 1958),\n\nSection 2(1) (emphasis added) (Annex 16).\n\n61 Mauritius (Constitution) Order, 1964 (26 Feb. 1964), Section 90(1) (emphasis added) (Annex\n\n24).\n\n62 Edis, Peak of Limuria (1993), p. 35 (Annex 136).\n\n36\n\nGovernor of Mauritius was further empowered to extend laws and regulations of\n\nMauritius to its dependencies.63\n\n2.18 In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Special Commissioners and\n\nMagistrates from Mauritius made visits to the Chagos Archipelago.64 Ordinance\n\nNo. 5 of 1872 provides that:\n\nThe Junior District Magistrate of the District of Port Louis, in the\n\nIsland of Mauritius, for the time being, is hereby constituted to be\n\nthe District Magistrate for the said Islands, and he, the said Junior\n\nDistrict Magistrate of Port Louis, and all the Officers of his Court,\n\nshall have the same powers, authority and jurisdiction respectively,\n\nto all intents and purposes, as if the said Islands formed part of the\n\nDistrict of Port Louis.65\n\n2.19 Ordinance No. 41 of 1875 provided for the appointment of a permanent\n\nPolice and Stipendiary Magistrate for the Chagos Archipelago, headquartered in\n\nPort Louis and tasked with visiting the islands for the purposes of “administer[ing]\n\nJustice therein between private individuals and between Master and Servant”.66 The\n\nStipendiary Magistrate for the Chagos Archipelago was vested with the same\n\npowers and authority as the Magistrates in Mauritius, and had a duty to report\n\ndirectly to the Governor of Mauritius on the occasion of each visit.67 In addition to\n\n63 Governor of Mauritius and the Council of Government, Ordinance No. 20 of 1852 (2 June 1852)\n\n(Annex 3); Governor of Mauritius and the Council of Government, Ordinance No. 14 of 1853 (23\n\nMar. 1853) (Annex 4).\n\n64 Edis, Peak of Limuria (1993), p. 43 (Annex 136).\n\n65 Governor of Mauritius, its Dependencies, and the Council of Government Ordinance No. 5 of\n\n1872 (10 Feb. 1872), Section 3 (Annex 5).

While the day-to-day administration of the workforce was largely left to the\n\nplantation managers, the Magistrates reviewed all punishments and fines imposed on the workforce\n\nby the plantation managers. A former commissioner of the “BIOT” gave this account of visiting\n\nSpecial Commissioners and District Magistrates: “They probed with surprising intrusiveness into\n\nthe island’s affairs and their painstaking reports give fascinating glimpses of life on the island. They\n\nclearly saw it as their duty to guard against tyrannous behaviour on behalf of the management, which\n\ncould all too easily have sprung up. They were not slow to upbraid and punish any such\n\n38\n\n2.21 The administration of justice in the Chagos Archipelago and the rest of\n\nMauritius was further consolidated by a 1945 Ordinance relating to “the\n\nOrganisation and Jurisdiction of Courts of Law in Mauritius”.73 Under Section 83,\n\nMagistrates could exercise jurisdiction throughout Mauritius, including the Chagos\n\nArchipelago:\n\nIt shall be lawful for the Governor to appoint as many fit and proper\n\npersons as may be needed to be Magistrates for Mauritius and the\n\nDependencies, and every person so appointed shall by virtue of such\n\nappointment have and may exercise jurisdiction as a District\n\nMagistrate in each and every district of the Colony and as Magistrate\n\nof the Dependencies, subject to the provisions of section 87:\n\nProvided that he shall exercise such jurisdiction only in such district\n\nor districts or in such Dependencies as may be assigned to him by\n\nthe Governor.74\n\n2.22 Mauritian Magistrates assigned to the Chagos Archipelago possessed and\n\nexercised “the same rights, duties, powers and jurisdiction as any other District\n\nMagistrate”.75 From 1945 onwards, Magistrates in Mauritius were given the title\n\n“Magistrate for Mauritius and the Dependencies” or “District Magistrate for\n\nmanifestations”. See Edis, Peak of Limuria (1993), p. 43 (Annex 136). Edis also gives examples of\n\nthe fines and instructions issued by the Magistrates: “Pakenham Brooks, who paid a visit as Special\n\nMagistrate in 1875, handed out sizeable fines both to an under-manager at Point Marianne for\n\nstriking a labourer and to James Spurs, the Manager at East Point, for unjustifiably imprisoning\n\nthree labourers without sufficient cause. The management at Point Marianne and Minni Minni were\n\nalso instructed to provide sick-bays for their workforce. Prices and weights and measures in the\n\nCompany’s shops were carefully checked and the labourers’ accommodation, the hospital and the\n\njail measured to ensure that they fulfilled minimum specifications.” Ibid., pp. 43-44.\n\n73 Governor of Mauritius and the Council of Government, Courts Ordinance No. 5, 1945 (3 Mar.\n\n1945) (Annex 12).\n\n74 Ibid., Section 83. Section 87 provides that: “Whenever two or more Magistrates have been\n\nappointed to any District, it shall be lawful for the Governor by Proclamation to declare that the\n\nCourt for the District shall sit in two or more Divisions, as the case may be, and the names by which\n\nsuch Divisional Courts shall be designated.” Ibid., Section 87. See also Section 2, which sets out the\n\nlist of “Lesser Dependencies” to which the Ordinance applies.\n\n75 Ibid., Section 86.\n\n39\n\nMauritius and its Dependencies”.76 The Magistrates assigned to the Chagos\n\nArchipelago toured all its main settlements and provided detailed reports on the\n\nconditions of the infrastructure and the wellbeing of the workforce; they also gave\n\naccounts of births, marriages and deaths.77\n\n2.23 The colonial authorities in Mauritius also sent police forces to the Chagos\n\nArchipelago to quell disturbances. A police presence from Mauritius is first\n\nrecorded in 1885 in Minni Minni (Diego Garcia), made up of an inspector, a\n\nsergeant, and six constables.78 In 1931 a Magistrate from Mauritius and 12 police\n\nofficers were sent to Peros Banhos in order to suppress a disturbance.79\n\nB. ECONOMIC, CULTURAL AND SOCIAL LINKS\n\n2.24 By the time Britain became the administering power in Mauritius in 1810,\n\na plantation system of agriculture was common to both the Chagos Archipelago\n\nand the main Island of Mauritius. In the early 1800s there were several hundred\n\nslaves in the Archipelago, working on the coconut plantations and operating fishing\n\nsettlements. Following the arrival in 1783 of 22 enslaved Africans, hundreds more\n\ncame, predominantly from Mozambique and Madagascar.80 Some of the Mauritian\n\nnationals who were removed from the Chagos Archipelago (“Chagossians”) after\n\n76 See Extracts from the Mauritius Gazette, General Notices (1951-1965) (Annex 15).\n\n77 See Ivanoff Dupont, Report of the Acting Magistrate for the Lesser Dependencies on the Islands\n\nof the Chagos Group for the Year 1882 (11 June 1883) (Annex 7); Maurice Rousset, Acting\n\nMagistrate for Mauritius and the Lesser Dependencies, Report of Mr. Magistrate M. Rousset on the\n\nChagos Group (19 June 1939) (Annex 10).\n\n78 Edis, Peak of Limuria (1993), p. 50 (Annex 136). While the police presence was withdrawn three\n\nyears later on grounds of cost, Special Constables were appointed as needed.\n\n79 Vine, Island of Shame (2009), p. 33 (Annex 151).\n\n80 Ibid., pp. 21-24.\n\n40\n\n1967 can trace their roots back as much as 200 years to the first 22 slaves.81 Over\n\ntime, there was a well-established community in the Chagos Archipelago. By 1826\n\nthe Chagos Archipelago supported a plantation society numbering more than 400,82\n\nand in 1880 the population had risen to around 760.83 The plantation society\n\nprovided employment, housing, pensions and education.84\n\n2.25 Slavery was a defining feature of life in the Chagos Archipelago until its\n\nabolition in Mauritius in 1833, when 60,000 slaves were set free.85 Some of the\n\nfreed slaves emigrated to work on the plantations on Diego Garcia, where the\n\nnative-born Mauritians (including those born in the Archipelago) very largely\n\noutnumbered the small minority of plantation managers of European descent. In\n\n1835, the British Assistant Protector of Slaves was sent to the Chagos Archipelago\n\nto supervise the emancipation of former slaves.86 Special Justice Charles Anderson\n\nvisited the Archipelago three years later, and complete emancipation was achieved\n\nin the Chagos Archipelago by 1840.87\n\n2.26 Proprietors of plantations in the Chagos Archipelago resided in Mauritius,\n\nand the on-site managers and administrators were also from Mauritius.88 During the\n\nlate 19th century, the Chagos Archipelago briefly served as a coal refuelling station,\n\nfollowing the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869.

This operated for almost eighty years until 1962, when a joint\n\nMauritian and Seychellois company, Chagos Agalega Ltd, acquired most of the\n\nfreeholds in the Archipelago.90\n\n2.27 The Mauritians living in the Chagos Archipelago fished, raised chickens\n\nand pigs, and maintained vegetable gardens. Shops sold items for everyday use, and\n\nbasic healthcare was available. Land was passed down through the generations and\n\nthe inhabitants built their own houses. A Catholic priest who visited Diego Garcia,\n\nFather Roger Dussercle, wrote that in 1933 about 60% of the population were\n\n“children of the islands”, having been born and raised there.91\n\n2.28 The economy of the Chagos Archipelago was closely linked to the main\n\nIsland of Mauritius. The coconut oil extracted from copra produced in the Chagos\n\nArchipelago, and the copra itself, were shipped to Mauritius.92 Some of the copra\n\nshipped to Mauritius was then sold for export.93 The harvesting of coconuts\n\nrepresented the major economic activity in the Chagos Archipelago, but efforts\n\nwere also made in the mid-19th century to diversify the economy by introducing\n\nnew crops such as maize, Indian corn, cotton, tobacco and citrus trees.94 By the end\n\nof the 19th century the Chagos Archipelago was producing copra, coconut oil, salted\n\n89 Ibid., pp. 47-48.\n\n90 Ibid., p. 39.\n\n91 Ibid., p. 57.\n\n92 Ibid., pp. 32, 46, 58, and 71; Vine, Island of Shame (2009), p. 26 (Annex 151).\n\n93 Vine, Island of Shame (2009), p. 31 (Annex 151).\n\n94 Edis, Peak of Limuria (1993), p. 44 (Annex 136).\n\n42\n\nfish, vegetables, timber, honey, pigs, maize, wooden toys, guano and model boats.95\n\nThe inhabitants no longer solely worked on the plantations; some were blacksmiths,\n\nbakers, mechanics, carpenters or had carved out some other specialised role.96\n\n2.29 The colonial authorities in Mauritius subsidised a transport and cargo\n\nservice between Mauritius and the Chagos Archipelago. Goods from the\n\ndependencies of Mauritius (including the Chagos Archipelago) were admitted on\n\nthe main Island of Mauritius free of duty.97 Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries,\n\nthe only point of arrival and departure from the Chagos Archipelago was via\n\nMauritius.\n\n2.30 In addition to the economic ties, the Chagos Archipelago also shared close\n\ncultural and social links with the main Island of Mauritius. Mauritian entrepreneurs\n\nin the Chagos Archipelago adopted the same technology that was used in the sugar\n\nplantations in Mauritius.98 Workers employed on the plantations had free passage\n\nto Mauritius.99 The creole spoken by the inhabitants was similar to that spoken on\n\nthe main Island of Mauritius.100\n\n2.31 Colonial authorities in Mauritius provided schoolteachers, midwives and\n\ndispensers, and established nurseries in the main islands of the Chagos\n\n95 Vine, Island of Shame (2009), p. 29 (Annex 151).\n\n96 Ibid., p. 35.\n\n97 Anonymous, An Account of the Island of Mauritius, and its Dependencies (1842) (“All goods, the\n\nproduce of the dependencies of Mauritius, or the Island of Madagascar, with the exception of ebony,\n\nif imported in British bottoms, are admitted free of duty”) (Annex 2).\n\n98 Vine, Island of Shame (2009), p. 25 (Annex 151).\n\n99 Ibid., p. 35.\n\n100 Ibid., p. 29.\n\n43\n\nArchipelago.101 They also provided a refuse removal service and maintained a\n\nmeteorological station on Diego Garcia.102 There were regular missions to survey\n\nhealth conditions, visits by officials from the Mauritian Labour Office, and\n\ninspections by various technical officers.103 Amateur radio enthusiasts were\n\nrecruited to develop closer communications between the Island of Mauritius and\n\nthe Chagos Archipelago.104\n\nC. RECOGNITION OF THE CHAGOS ARCHIPELAGO AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE\n\nTERRITORY OF MAURITIUS\n\n2.32 Throughout the period of British colonial rule, the Chagos Archipelago was\n\nalways treated by the administering power, in law and in practice, as an integral\n\npart of the territory of Mauritius. In the period prior to, during and after the\n\ndetachment of the Chagos Archipelago, British authorities recognised the Chagos\n\nArchipelago as a full and constitutive part of Mauritius. As explained in Chapter 6\n\nbelow, the unit of self-determination that enjoyed the right to decolonisation in\n\ninternational law and U.N. practice was the whole of the territorial unit of\n\nMauritius. The U.N. and the international community have recognised the entire\n\nterritory of Mauritius – including the Chagos Archipelago – as the unit of selfdetermination.\n\n105\n\n101 Ibid., p. 35; Robert Newton, Report on the Anglo-American Survey in the Indian Ocean, C.O.\n\n1036/1332 (1964) (hereinafter “Newton, Survey in the Indian Ocean (1964)”), para. 52 (Annex 22).\n\n102 Vine, Island of Shame (2009), p. 35 (Annex 151); Newton, Survey in the Indian Ocean (1964),\n\npara. 52 (Annex 22).\n\n103 See Alfred J.

The administering power recognised the Chagos Archipelago as an\n\nintegral part of Mauritius\n\n2.33 In the period immediately prior to the detachment of the Chagos\n\nArchipelago, British representatives at all levels expressed the unambiguous view\n\nthat the Chagos Archipelago was part of the territory of Mauritius. By way of\n\nexample:\n\nA note from the Colonial Office dated 10 May 1965 addressed proposals\n\nto detach the Chagos Archipelago, and stated that it would be necessary\n\nto compensate the Government of Mauritius “for their loss of\n\nterritory.”106 Likewise, in a telegram dated 19 July 1965, the Colonial\n\nSecretary expressed the view that it would be necessary to compensate\n\nthe Government of Mauritius “in respect of loss of territory”.107\n\nOn 27 April 1965, the Colonial Secretary circulated a note in which he\n\nrecognised that the Chagos Archipelago is “legally established” as being\n\npart of the colony of Mauritius, and that separation would require “the\n\nmaking of amendments to existing constitutional instruments.”108\n\nA Foreign Office telegram addressed to the U.K. Embassy in\n\nWashington dated 30 April 1965 stated that “[i]t is now clear that in\n\neach case the islands are legally part of the territory of the colony\n\nconcerned.”109\n\n106 Letter from D.

The administering power’s consistent conduct vis-à-vis the\n\nislands’ inhabitants reflects a clear understanding that Mauritius and the Chagos\n\nArchipelago were part of the same territorial unit:\n\nThe administering power made legal provision for the Chagossians to\n\nbecome Mauritian citizens automatically on the independence of\n\nMauritius;113\n\nThe Chagossians were taken to Mauritius when they were forcibly\n\nremoved from the Chagos Archipelago, and most of them were resettled\n\nthere; and\n\nIn 1982 the administering power settled a claim brought by one of the\n\nformer inhabitants of the Chagos Archipelago on the basis of a £4\n\nmillion contribution to a Mauritian trust fund for the benefit of the\n\nChagossians.114\n\n2.36 In the years that followed the detachment, there continued to be recognition\n\nby senior British officials and politicians in various statements to Parliament that\n\nthe Chagos Archipelago has been part of the territory of Mauritius:\n\nOn 21 October 1975, in response to a parliamentary question, the then\n\nBritish Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, David\n\nEnnals, explained that grants had been paid to Mauritius “as\n\n113 This was by virtue of Section 20(4) of the Independence Constitution of Mauritius set out in the\n\nSchedule to the Mauritius Independence Order 1968, which provided in effect that with the\n\nexception of persons with fathers born in Seychelles, a person born in the Chagos Archipelago\n\nbefore the “BIOT” was created was to be regarded as having been born in Mauritius and therefore\n\nautomatically entitled to Mauritian citizenship on independence. See United Kingdom, The\n\nMauritius Independence Order 1968 and Schedule to the Order: The Constitution of Mauritius (4\n\nMar. 1968), Section 20(4) (Annex 95).\n\n114 See R (on the application of Bancoult) v.

The same may be said of Mr Ennals’ reference to “loss of sovereignty”.\n\n2.38 By Article VIII of the 1814 Treaty of Paris, Mauritius was ceded to the U.K.\n\nincluding “its Dependencies, especially Rodrigues and Les Séchelles”.119 Upon\n\nMauritius’ independence, Rodrigues automatically remained part of the territory of\n\nthe newly independent State of Mauritius. Officials at the Foreign Office accepted\n\nthat the Chagos Archipelago would have been subject to the same automatic\n\nconsequence had it not been detached from Mauritius.

The Seychelles was established as a separate colony from Mauritius in 1903.\n\n48\n\n“Diego Garcia has always been an integral part of Mauritius”,120 an official at the\n\nForeign Office Research Department concluded that:\n\nDiego Garcia and the other Chagos islands were among the\n\ndependencies of Mauritius ceded to Britain by France under the\n\nTreaty of Paris (1814). Britain continued to administer them from\n\nPort Louis (or at least – if not actively to administer – they were\n\nincluded by Britain in official catalogues of the dependencies of\n\nMauritius ever since the first schedule was compiled in 1826). From\n\n1921 onwards the Chagos Archipelago, Agalega, and St. Brandon\n\nwere known as the Lesser Dependencies of Mauritius. In 1965 the\n\nChagos islands were detached from Mauritius to form part of the\n\nBritish Indian Ocean Territory. Agalega and St. Brandon remained\n\npart of Mauritius and since independence in 1968 have formed part\n\nof the Mauritian state; had the Chagos islands not previously been\n\ndetached they would presumably have done the same.121\n\n2.39 Likewise, a “Commissioner” of the “British Indian Ocean Territory”, Nigel\n\nWenban-Smith, expressed the view that, but for the detachment, the Chagos\n\n120 Organization of African Unity, Assembly of Heads of State and Government, 17th Ordinary\n\nSession, Resolution on Diego Garcia, AHG/Res.99(XVII) (1-4 July 1980) (hereinafter “Resolution\n\non Diego Garcia (1-4 July 1980)”) (Annex 118).\n\n121 Note from M. Walawalkar of the African Section Research Department to Mr Hewitt, FCO\n\n31/2759 (8 July 1980), para. 2 (emphasis added) (Annex 119). The text as quoted is the original\n\nprinted version. There are handwritten annotations to the last sentence to the effect that: “Agalega\n\nand St. Brandon remained attached to Mauritius and since independence in 1968 have remained\n\ndependencies of the Mauritian state; had the Chagos islands not previously been detached they\n\nwould presumably have done the same”. The Foreign Office official, Margaret Walawalkar, went\n\non to explain that: “I suspect that the reasoning behind the statement that Diego Garcia has ‘always’\n\nbeen ‘an integral part’ of Mauritius may lie along these lines. Territorial integrity and the\n\ninviolability of colonially-inherited boundaries are two of the main consensus principles which have\n\nheld the OAU together. It is obvious that if any exceptions are made the arbitrary nature of\n\npractically every international boundary in Africa would be open to dispute. In its application to\n\nisland-states – which present their own problems – the OAU in general has a short memory.\n\nAlthough historically there are frequent cases of detachment of island dependencies for\n\nadministrative convenience by both Britain and France, eg. the creation of the separate colony of\n\nSeychelles in 1903 out of the colony of Mauritius, the OAU in general only concerns itself with the\n\nsituation at, or shortly before, independence. Thus ‘always’ should not be taken too literally, for\n\nalthough the Chagos archipelago and the island of Mauritius are far apart and can have had no\n\npossible connection until both were settled by the French at different times in the eighteenth century,\n\n1814 onwards must seem a very long period of unbroken association under one colonial power to\n\nthe OAU”. Ibid., para. 3.\n\n49\n\nArchipelago would have become part of the independent State of Mauritius.\n\nReflecting on Mr Ennals’ statement to Parliament, Mr Wenban-Smith wrote that:\n\nIf reminded of the 1975 answer, we should probably have to say\n\nsomething to the effect that all that Mauritius was being\n\ncompensated for was not receiving the sovereignty it would\n\notherwise have acquired on independence.122\n\n2.40 Against the backdrop of growing international pressure for the return of the\n\nChagos Archipelago to Mauritius in the early 1980s, a Foreign Office legal advisor\n\n– Michael Wood – warned against the use of the words “revert” or “reversion”,\n\nurging instead that the words “cede” or “transfer” be used.123 However, the legal\n\nadvisor acknowledged that the Chagos Archipelago “was for a long time part of the\n\nColony of Mauritius” before it was “removed from Mauritius”.124\n\n122 Letter from W. N. Wenban-Smith of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to M. J. Williams,\n\nwith draft, FCO 31/3835 (25 Mar. 1983), para. 6 (emphasis added) (Annex 128). An earlier draft of\n\nthis letter states “If reminded of the 1975 answer, we should be obliged to say that all that Mauritius\n\nwas being compensated for was the delay in receiving the sovereignty they would have acquired on\n\nindependence”. Ibid., para. 5 (draft).\n\n123 Letter from M. C. Wood to Mr Hewitt, FCO 31/2759 (22 Sept. 1980) (Annex 122).\n\n124 Ibid. Another Foreign Office legal advisor, Arthur Watts, opposed the words “revert” and\n\n“return” on the basis that: “[b]oth suggest the Chagos were previously Mauritius, and that that state\n\nof affairs will be resumed: the first limb of that proposition is, of course, not one we would readily\n\ngo along with, at least without a lot of supplementary explanation about ‘administrative\n\nconveniences’ and so on”. See Note from A. Watts to Mr Campbell, FCO 31/3836 (received 23 Aug.\n\n1983) (Annex 134). It was proposed by a diplomat of the U.K. Mission to the U.N. that a “new\n\nlocus classicus” be developed to “expunge the ambiguities and inconsistencies that have appeared\n\nin previous Ministerial pronouncements” which did “not square with the policy we are under\n\ninstructions to defend (Mr Ennals’ 1975 statement and the Prime Minister’s answer in July 1980 are\n\nI think particularly unfortunate examples).” See Letter from D. A. Gore-Booth to W. N. Wenban-\n\nSmith of the East African Department, FCO 58/3286 (15 July 1983), para. 3 (Annex 133). In a letter\n\ndated 25 March 1983, the then “Commissioner” of the “British Indian Ocean Territory” remarked\n\nof Mr Ennals’ statement that: “This was, and is, a potentially embarrassing statement.” See Letter\n\nfrom W. N. Wenban-Smith of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to M. J. Williams, with draft,\n\nFCO 31/3835 (25 Mar. 1983), para. 3 (Annex 128).\n\n50\n\n2. The U.N. and the international community\n\n2.41 Following the detachment of the Chagos Archipelago, the U.N. General\n\nAssembly adopted Resolution 2066 (XX), by which the administering power was\n\ninvited “to take no action which would dismember the Territory of Mauritius and\n\nviolate its territorial integrity”.125 The U.N. General Assembly repeated the\n\nrequirement to maintain the territorial integrity of Mauritius in Resolutions 2232\n\n(XXI) and 2357 (XXII).126 It is clear from these resolutions that the U.N. has\n\nregarded the Chagos Archipelago as an integral part of the territory of Mauritius.\n\n2.42 The great majority of States have consistently rejected the argument that the\n\nChagos Archipelago is not part of Mauritius.127 When a British representative in\n\nthe U.N. Committee of 24 stated that “the British Indian Ocean Territory was not\n\npart of Mauritius and Seychelles”, the Tanzanian delegation:\n\nrejected that argument, since the United Kingdom Government\n\nwould not have agreed to pay compensation to the inhabitants of the\n\nislands concerned if those islands were not an integral part of\n\nMauritius and the Seychelles.128\n\n125 Question of Mauritius (16 Dec. 1965), para. 4 (Dossier No. 146).\n\n126 U.N.

Domestic and international judicial findings\n\n2.44 There is also judicial support, domestic and international, for the contention\n\nthat the Chagos Archipelago has been an integral part of the territory of Mauritius.\n\nIn a 2016 judgment of the U.K. Supreme Court, Lord Kerr (with whom Lady Hale\n\nagreed) held that:\n\nThe Chagos Islands are in the middle of the Indian Ocean. Since the\n\nearly 19th century they had been part of the British colony of\n\nMauritius but they were detached from that country before\n\nMauritius gained its independence in 1968.130\n\n2.45 In an earlier 2008 judgment of the U.K. House of Lords (the predecessor to\n\nthe Supreme Court), Lord Hoffmann held that: “It is true that the territory of BIOT\n\nwas, until the creation of the colony in 1965, part of Mauritius”.131\n\nCountries and Peoples, U.N.
