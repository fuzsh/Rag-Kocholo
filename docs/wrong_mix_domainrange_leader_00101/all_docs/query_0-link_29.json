We also touched cruise ship business for the Indian Ocean among many other points” said Minister Alain St. Ange to the Mauritius Broadcasting Corporation (MBC) Television Network as he was interviewed when leaving the Prime Minister’s Office.\n\n“The meeting was friendly and really appreciated” Minister St. Ange said as he left the New Treasury Building at Port Louis yesterday."
