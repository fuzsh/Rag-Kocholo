        "text": "The Hon. Pravind Jugnauth\n\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Mauritius\n\nWelcome to the Mauritius portal of the Commonwealth of Nations website.\n\nMauritius is proud to be a member of the Commonwealth and is fully committed to upholding and promoting its values and ideals. We have a long-standing relationship with the Commonwealth which has a strong tradition of shared values such as the promotion of democracy, good governance, the rule of law and the protection of human rights, as enshrined in the Charter of the organisation.\n\nThe Commonwealth has a global relevance and profile and is also an internationally well-respected organisation that makes its voice heard on major issues.\n\nThe organisation has played an important role in having the special development challenges faced by small island developing states, like Mauritius, acknowledged at the global level. It has put in place a framework for small states to build resilience and Mauritius is fully supportive of the work undertaken by the Commonwealth in that respect.\n\nMauritius is at the crossroads of civilisation and is a melting pot of diverse cultures from Africa, Asia and Europe. The co-existence of its multicultural people and their harmonious interaction makes Mauritius a replica of the global village.\n\nSince its independence in 1968, Mauritius has experienced significant socio-economic progress, yet it is faced with new challenges. My government is set to steer the Mauritian economy to a much higher plane of development, boost GDP growth and improve the quality of life of Mauritian citizens.\n\nMauritius is strategically located as it provides a gateway to Africa, Asia and Australia. The country has also transformed itself into a business hub for investors in search of security, transparent regulation and high value-addition.\n\nMauritius is strongly committed to working together with other members of the organisation to improve the destiny of the peoples of the Commonwealth and of the generations to come.\n\nOn behalf of the government and the people of the Republic of Mauritius, I invite you to discover more about our country and the various opportunities awaiting you by navigating through the Mauritius portal.\n\nThe Rt Hon Sir Anerood Jugnauth, GCSK, KCMG, QC Prime Minister\n\nThe above message was provided by the previous Prime Minister.\n\nMauritius in the Commonwealth\n\ndid you know?\n\nMauritius became a member of the Commonwealth in 1968\n\nMauritius became an independent country on the 12th of March 1968\n\nMauritius has been involved in the Commonwealth Games since 1958, and has won eight medals over this period of time\n\nJean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio, a Frenchman whose parents originated from Mauritius, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2008\n\nScholarships and fellowships are awarded by Mauritius to citizens of other Commonwealth countries under the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan\n\nMauritius has the highest life expectancy in Africa (73 years)\n\nNo country in Africa has more telephone landlines per capita than Mauritius – 285 for every 1,000 inhabitants\n\nSenior Commonwealth officers\n\nJosé Maurel, an economist specialising in development finance, became Director of Special Advisory Services, Commonwealth Secretariat, in 2007\n\nMustapha Mosafeer, Chair of the Commonwealth Association of Tax Administrators\n\nS C Seeballuck, Secretary to the Mauritian Cabinet and Head of the Civil Service, is a member of the Board of Directors, Commonwealth Association for Public Administration and Management, which is dedicated to strengthening public management throughout the Commonwealth\n\nCommonwealth meetings hosted\n\n1997 Commonwealth Finance Ministers Meeting in Le Morne\n\nCommonwealth Projects\n\nAdvisor on Sustainable Development Policy (2007/08)\n\nTechnical assistance was provided (on behalf of the Commonwealth Secretariat) to the Indian Ocean Commission (IOC) in its role as co-ordinator for the AIMS Region and to promote effective advocacy for the concerns of Commonwealth Small Island Developing States (CSIDS).\n\nCapacity Building in Debt Management (2007/08)\n\nThis Commonwealth Secretariat commissioned project addressed the use of CS-DRMS to cover domestic debt management, conducted a national debt portfolio review, and presented a debt sustainability analysis workshop which could feed into a debt management strategy and provide training for staff in various aspects of debt recording and management.\n\nAdvisor on Telecommunications (2005/06)\n\nThis Commonwealth Secretariat commissioned project, extended for a second year, appointed an advisor to the Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunications. The introduction of the new National Telecommunications Policy and the privatisation of the telecommunications sector were expected to generate resources and enable widespread access to ICT services in all parts of the country. The advisor provided technical and policy advice on the development of the telecommunications sector in line with the Government’s policies; the formulation of national objectives and strategies, and with the promotion of research and development of new technologies; licensing; tariff interconnection; frequency spectrum; and intellectual property rights. The advisor worked closely with the Director of Telecommunications and provided on-the-job training to other professional staff.\n\nMaritime Boundaries Delimitation (2002)\n\nThe Commonwealth Secretariat provided assistance to review and update the national maritime zones legislation of Mauritius. As Mauritius was preparing to begin maritime boundary negotiations with neighbouring states, it was of paramount importance that the legislation conforms to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (1982).\n\nPromoting Export Competitiveness in Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (1998)\n\nThis Commonwealth funded project prepared a diagnostic report on Small and Medium Sized Enterprises export competitiveness in Mauritius and assisted the government to develop a strategy to monitor its implementation."
