We are happy to have entered into an understanding with SEM for fostering the growth of the Mauritian financial markets. Such initiatives can ensure economic benefits to the nation and its people in the long run,\" NSE MD & CEO Chitra Ramkrishna said.\n\nSEM termed the MoU as \"an important milestone\". \"This collaborative relationship between SEM and NSE is expected to create new opportunities for development and listing of new products on the SEM platform and enhance the attractiveness of Mauritius and of SEM as a hub for investing in Africa,\" SEM CEO Sunil Benimadhu said.\n\n\"The partnership will also focus on capacity building and training of SEM employees and securities markets professionals in Mauritius.\"\n\n#Budget' 2024 with ET\n\nWhat's cheaper and what's costlier?
