Quebec is one of the provinces of Canada.The majority of Quebec's population speaks French as their first language, which sets the province apart from the rest of Canada. The language difference has also led to cultural differences between Quebec and the rest of Canada. Quebec has a distinct cultural identity that is influenced by its French roots. Quebec National Day, i.e. Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day iscelebrated worldwide on June 24, especially in Canada and the United States, mainly a celebration of francophone culture , filled with public events, parades, barbecues, picnics and fireworks. The National day holiday is a way to celebrate the heritage and contributions of francophones to the world's culture. The province of Quebec is gorgeous! With centuries of history, stunning landscapes and beautiful coastlines, it's one of Canada's most-gorgeous places. Quebec is well known for producing maple syrup, for its comedy, and for making hockey as one of the most popular sports in Canada. It is also renowned for its culture, literature, music, films, TV shows, festivals, folklore. Quebec has wonderful connect with Maharashtra, Mumbai.The Qu√©bec Government Office in Mumbai exercises a mandate of promotion of trade, investment and cooperation in the fields of education and research, science and technology. Very learned Francis Paradis who is into management and governance for many years has been Director of the Qu√©bec Government Office in Mumbai . And i must mention that this office is very helpful and advises, assists Qu√©bec companies seeking business opportunities in India. Maharashtra government and Quebec government have signed a memorandum of understanding to increase economic cooperation, specially in areas like information technology, biotechnology, artificial intelligence and welfare of the tribal community. Cooperation agreement that Quebec signed with Maharshtra is going strong with exchanges with IIT, Mumbai; Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, SNDT University, Prince Aly Khan hospital. This is due to the research and development that Quebec is known for at international level. It is a matter of pride that some Quebec companies have subsidiaries or local distributors in Maharashtra. The Quebec bureau completes 16 years of existence in Maharashtra which is highly creditable. I congratulate and extend my best wishes to all quebec friends for Quebec National Day- Saint Jean Baptiste Day. üáÆüá≥üá≤üá∂ üìç Gallary North, Four Seasons, Worli. 20.6.24 #Quebec #canada #quebeccity #montreal #ConsulGeneral #ottawa #mumbai\n\nProtocol Chronicles 122 SAVOUR SRI LANKA It was an invitation by Consul General of Srilanka Dr. Valson Vethody to indulge our senses in a culinary journey to the tropical paradise of Sri Lanka at Fairfield by Marriott Mumbai‚Äôs Sri Lankan Food Festival, where the vibrant and aromatic flavors of Sri Lankan cuisine were at centre stage.

On June 12, 1990 the first Congress of Peoples‚Äô Deputies of the RSFSR adopted the Declaration on State Sovereignty of Russia. It proclaimed the supremacy of the Constitution of the Russian Federation and its laws all over the country. Therefore, June 12 is considered the starting point of the modern history of the state. Russia has a lot to be proud with. Its territory is the largest in the world, occupying around 40% of Europe and almost whole northern part of Asia. Russian science and education system are well-known and respected globally. Russian explorers discovered more than 1/6 part of the world territory, including Arctic and Antarctic, cosmonaut Yury Gagarin was the first man in outer space. Russian culture, diverse and expressive, has always been an inherent and essential part of the world‚Äôs cultural heritage. Poems and novels by Pushkin, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky and others are translated into many languages and loved by international readers. Music by Tchaikovsky, Prokofiev, Shostakovich is a must at classical music concert. And Russian ballet has already become a ‚Äúspecial feature‚Äù of country‚Äôs heritage. India Russia relationship, friendship is amongst the most steady international relationships in the world. India Russia have wonderful bilateral ties in military, economy, trade & commerce, science & technology, and culture too. Both countries closely collaborate on matters of national interest at United Nations, BRICS, G20 and SCO. India has a great Bollywood connection with Russia and Russia too had a love affair with Indian films for very long. Since Bollywood super star legend Rajkapoor to very recent Allu Arjun 'Pushpa- The rise' India made remarkable Bollywood presence in Russia. It was great pleasure to attend wonderful reception hosted by Consul General of the Russian Federation Mr. Aleksei Surovtsev & his gracious wife Mrs. Zhanna Surovtseva to celebrate Day of Russia in Mumbai. On the occasion of this auspicious day I extend my best wishes to all Russia friends. üáÆüá≥üá∑üá∫ üìçRegal Room, Trident Hotel, Nariman Point 6.6.24 #russia #stpetersburg #moscow #IndoRussiaTradeChamber #IndoRussiaFriends #RussianConsulateinMumbai #ConsulGeneralsinMumbai #Bollywood #foreignmissions #embassy #russi"
