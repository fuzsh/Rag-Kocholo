Boolell pointed out that inflation continues to affect everyone, particularly the lower-income population. He criticized the government for not alleviating the burden of fuel prices and failing to support the middle class.\n\nDuring a press briefing with the PTr/MMM/ND alliance, Boolell accused the government of mismanaging the economy and highlighted instances of waste, fraud, and corruption, including the BAI, Betamax, and Les Salines scandals. He suggested that a new government would restore economic confidence and better manage public resources. Additionally, he criticized the budget for ignoring key issues such as the drug problem, education, and the blue economy.\".",
