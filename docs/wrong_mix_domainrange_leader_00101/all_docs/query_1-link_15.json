        "text": "Family in which several members are involved in politics\n\nA political family (also referred to as political dynasty) is a family in which multiple members are involved in politics — particularly electoral politics. Members may be related by blood or marriage; often several generations or multiple siblings may be involved.\n\nA royal family or dynasty in a monarchy is generally considered to not be a \"political family,\" although the later descendants of a royal family have played political roles in a republic (such as the Arslan family of Lebanon). A family dictatorship is a form of hereditary dictatorship that operates much like an absolute monarchy, yet occurs in a nominally non-monarchic state.\n\nIn the United States, many political families (having at least two generations serving in political office) have arisen since the country's founding.\n\nSeveral presidential families produced multiple generations of members who devoted at least part of their working lives to public service.\n\nThe Adams family: John Adams, second U.S. president (1797–1801); his son, John Quincy Adams, sixth U.S. president (1825–1829); John Quincy's son, Charles Francis Adams Sr., member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Massachusetts (1859–1861) and U.S. envoy to the United Kingdom (1861–1868); Charles Francis' son, John Quincy Adams II, Massachusetts state representative (1866–67, 1868–69, 1871–72, 1874–75); John Quincy II's son, Charles Francis Adams III, mayor of Quincy, Massachusetts (1896–97) and U.S. secretary of the Navy (1929–1933).\n\nThe Harrison family: Benjamin Harrison V, governor of Virginia (1781–1784) and a signer of the Declaration of Independence; his son, William Henry Harrison, ninth U.S. president (1841); William's son, John Scott Harrison, member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Ohio (1853–1857); John Scott's son, Benjamin Harrison, 23rd U.S. president (1889–1893) (the only grandson of a president to become president); Benjamin's son, Russell Benjamin Harrison, Indiana state legislator (1921–1933) and diplomat (1908–1927); Russell's son, William Henry Harrison III, member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Wyoming (1951–1955, 1961–1965, 1967–1969).\n\nThe Lincoln family: Abraham Lincoln, postmaster of New Salem, Illinois (1833), Illinois state House of Representatives (1834–1842), U.S. House of Representatives from Illinois (1847–1849), 16th U.S. president (1861–1865); his cousin-in-law, John Todd Stuart, U.S. House of Representatives from Illinois (1839–1843, 1863–1865), Illinois state Senate (1848–1852); President Lincoln's son, Robert Todd Lincoln, South Chicago Board of Supervisors (1876–77), U.S. secretary of War (1881–1885), U.S. minister to Great Britain (1889–1893).\n\nNote 1: President Lincoln's great-grandmother, Abigail Harrison, was a member of the Shenandoah Valley branch of the Harrison family and was related to the James River branch that produced Presidents William Henry Harrison and Benjamin Harrison.\n\nNote 2: President Lincoln and Levi Lincoln were fourth cousins; their great-great-grandfathers were brothers.
