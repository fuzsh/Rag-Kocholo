President Wavel Ramkalawan met the Prime Minister of Mauritius Pravind Jugnauth while on transit to attend the World Leaders Summit COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland.

The meeting was an opportunity for the two leaders to discuss current affairs and work ahead of the leadersâ€™ Summit. Both countries will take the same stance on the issue of vulnerability and will seek support for small island developing states (Sids).
