        "text": "In the airport bathroom during a work trip and heard very distressed, loud crying and sobbing. I look around the corner to try and locate where it was coming from. There was a young girl by herself in absolute shambles. I walk up and say gently “hey…what’s going on?” She says, “I’m autistic and it’s all too much.” There are several weather delays and cancellations at the airport and she’s just truly overwhelmed by it all. I ask if I can hug her and through her tears she barely squeaks out a yes. So we just stand and hug. And now I’m crying with her because my pregnancy hormones have activated a whole new level of emotion! We begin to do some breathing exercises and after a while I ask, “how ya doing?” She says “I’m ok…I can do it.” In my mind I’m cheering, that’s right girl! So I asked her if she wants me to walk her to her gate, and she says yes. I drop her off at the gate then ask the gate agent to help make sure she’s supported. The whole exchange was less than 15 minutes but she reminded me to extend more grace. And I reflected that so much grace was extended to me in my travel as strangers kindly helped me with bags, held doors, and shared encouraging words when they saw my growing baby bump. In the hustle and bustle of the airport (and everyday life), it’s easy to let the noise take over. Especially as work piles up and we busily rush from moment to moment. It’s easy to forget our humanity. But we are all just a bunch of imperfect humans with emotions and stories, doing the best we can."
