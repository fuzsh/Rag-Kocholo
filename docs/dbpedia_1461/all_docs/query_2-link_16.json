        "text": "WASHINGTON — Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, who had been a certainty to win her fourth term in November, stunned the U.S. political world last month by announcing that she was retiring.\n\nSome of her fellow Republicans, who only days earlier had groused that she was unreliable — a centerpiece of the re-election campaign for Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah was the warning that his defeat could mean Ms. Snowe would become chairwoman of the Senate Finance Committee — lamented the loss and what it said about U.S. politics. Similar sentiments came from Democrats, from the White House to the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, some of whom had dismissed her for failing to stand up to her party.\n\nThis is why the three-term senator, who also served 16 years in the U.S. House of Representatives and six years in the Maine Legislature, bowed out; the “sensible center,” she said, is disappearing from U.S. politics, and the Senate is dysfunctional.\n\nLast week, in her ground-level office in the Russell Senate Office Building, she chatted for 40 minutes about changes and the loss of comity in the body politic."
