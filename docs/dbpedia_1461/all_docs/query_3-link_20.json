        "text": "WASHINGTON — Citing excessive partisanship and a dispiriting political environment, Senator Olympia J. Snowe, a three-term Republican from Maine, said Tuesday that she would not run for re-election in November. Her surprise decision delivered a potential blow to Republicans who need just a handful of seats to regain control of the Senate; Ms. Snowe was considered one of their safer incumbents.\n\n“After 33 years in the Congress this was not an easy decision,” said Ms. Snowe, 65, a moderate who served 16 years in the House before moving to the Senate. “My husband and I are in good health. We have laid an exceptionally strong foundation for the campaign, and I have no doubt I would have won re-election.”\n\nBut in sharp comments citing the lack of comity in the current Congress as a motivating factor in her sudden retirement, Ms. Snowe, who spent a career voting against her Republican colleagues almost as often as with them, said she had had enough.\n\n“I do find it frustrating,” she said, “that an atmosphere of polarization and ‘my way or the highway’ ideologies has become pervasive in campaigns and in our governing institutions.”\n\nShe added: “Unfortunately, I do not realistically expect the partisanship of recent years in the Senate to change over the short term. So at this stage of my tenure in public service, I have concluded that I am not prepared to commit myself to an additional six years in the Senate, which is what a fourth term would entail.”\n\nMs. Snowe cast key votes on bills that were dear to Democrats, including the economic stimulus measure and a law upending the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy governing gay men and lesbians in the military. She was facing a Tea Party-backed challenger, but her opponent had failed to gain much traction in a state where Ms. Snowe was popular and had the backing of the new Republican governor.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
