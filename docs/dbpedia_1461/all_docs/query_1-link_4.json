        "text": "Enacted Legislation\n\nSnowe was the primary sponsor of 35 bills that were enacted. The most recent include:\n\nS. 3624 (112th): Military Commercial Driver’s License Act of 2012\n\nS. 815 (112th): Sanctity of Eternal Rest for Veterans Act of 2011\n\nS. 3199 (111th): Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Act of 2010\n\nS. 3103 (111th): Small Business Job Creation Act of 2010\n\nS. 2862 (111th): Small Business Export Enhancement and International Trade Act of 2009\n\nS. 823 (111th): Net Operating Loss (NOL) Carryback Act\n\nS. 2607 (110th): DTV Transition Assistance Act\n\nView All »\n\nDoes 35 not sound like a lot? Very few bills are ever enacted — most legislators sponsor only a handful that are signed into law. But there are other legislative activities that we don’t track that are also important, including offering amendments, committee work and oversight of the other branches, and constituent services.\n\nWe consider a bill enacted if one of the following is true: a) it is enacted itself, b) it has a companion bill in the other chamber (as identified by Congress) which was enacted, or c) if at least about half of its provisions were incorporated into bills that were enacted (as determined by an automated text analysis, applicable beginning with bills in the 110th Congress).\n\nVoting Record\n\nKey Votes\n\nSnowe voted Yea\n\nSnowe voted Yea\n\nConference Report Agreed to 86/13 on Dec 15, 2011.\n\nSnowe voted Nay\n\nBill Passed 83/15 on Oct 12, 2011.\n\nSnowe voted Yea\n\nJoint Resolution Passed 87/13 on Mar 17, 2011.\n\nSnowe voted Yea\n\nMotion Agreed to 81/19 on Dec 15, 2010.\n\nThe Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 (Pub.L. 111–312, H.R. 4853, 124 Stat. 3296, enacted December 17, 2010), also known …\n\nSnowe voted Nay\n\nBill Passed 69/30 on Sep 29, 2010.\n\nSnowe voted Nay\n\nSnowe voted Yea\n\nMotion Rejected 34/63 on May 22, 2008.\n\nThe Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008 is Title V of the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2008, Pub.L. 110–252, H.R. 2642, an Act of …\n\nSnowe voted Nay\n\nJoint Resolution Passed 81/15 on Feb 14, 2007.\n\nSnowe voted Yea\n\nNomination Confirmed 83/14 on Feb 8, 2007.\n\nMissed Votes\n\nFrom Jan 1995 to Jan 2013, Snowe missed 11 of 5,995 roll call votes, which is 0.2%. This is better than the median of 2.0% among the lifetime records of senators serving in Jan 2013. The chart below reports missed votes over time.\n\nWe don’t track why legislators miss votes, but it’s often due to medical absenses, major life events, and running for higher office.\n\nShow the
