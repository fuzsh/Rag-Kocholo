        "text": "WASHINGTON — In most Senate races, an ad supporting a Democrat can safely be interpreted as opposing a Republican candidate, while an ad criticizing a Republican usually can be viewed as an effort to boost the nominee of the Democratic Party.\n\nThat's not the case in Maine's tangled Senate race, where independent Angus King has been maintaining a steady but shrinking lead in the polls over Republican Charlie Summers and Democrat Cynthia Dill for the seat of retiring GOP Sen. Olympia Snowe.\n\nA group called Maine Freedom formed a little over six weeks ago and has pumped nearly $180,000 into ads promoting Dill — even though the group's actual motive appears to be to boost Summers by diverting Democratic voters from King to Dill. Meanwhile, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which so has refrained from providing any assistance to its own party's nominee, Dill — late last week disclosed a $410,000 media buy in the state, for a 10-day period that began Tuesday.\n\nThe intent of the media buy seems to be weakening Summers, whom recent polls show eating into King's lead. Many expect King, a former independent governor, to caucus with Senate Democrats if he is elected next month.\n\nGuy Cecil, the DSCC's executive director, charged in a statement that \"Republican extremism forced Olympia Snowe to retire from the Senate,\" creating a race in which \"Republican special interests have now spent $2 million boosting a candidate who is fundamentally out of step with the state.\"\n\n\"Charlie Summers should not be in the United States Senate and it is time every Mainer knows it,\" Cecil declared.\n\nSo far this year, the race to fill the Senate seat, which has belonged to Snowe since 1994, has been fueled by nearly $3.5 million in spending. More than $2.16 million of that figure is coming from independent expenditures by out-of-state committees and organizations, according to Federal Election Commission filings. The DSCC's $410,000 contribution, which does not yet show up in the FEC's database, will further boost the amount of outside spending coming into the Maine Senate race.\n\nAmy Fried, a political science professor at the University of Maine, said while \"there are some very, very expensive campaigns around the country, it's taking a different shape in Maine.\"\n\nShe noted \"pro-Republican groups have been attacking King or trying to promote Cynthia Dill in order to take votes away from Angus King.\"\n\n\"Some of the money that looks like it's in opposition to Dill is really messaging in order to support (Dill),\" Fried said. \"For example, there's a mailer (that said) she's the most liberal candidate, 'too liberal for Maine.' Really, I think that's a message for Democrats to try to increase their support, though it looks like it's in opposition.\"\n\nFried said that with many independent expenditures, \"it's unclear where the money's coming from.\"\n\nWhile King has refused to say which party he will caucus with if elected, his positions on several issues and his recent support for Democratic presidential candidates — Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., in 2004, and President Obama in both 2008 and this year — has national Democrats counting on him in a year the party's Senate majority hangs in the balance.\n\nKing's lead in the polls has dwindled from more than 20 points earlier in the year to single digits, according to a survey of 804 likely voters conducted Sept. 17-18 by North Carolina-based Public Policy Polling. It showed King, who was governor from 1994 to 2002, leading Maine Secretary of State Summers by 43 percent to 35 percent, with Dill, a state senator, trailing with 14 percent. The poll has a 3.5-point error margin.\n\nThe slip in King's favorability ratings — from 62 percent earlier this year to 51 percent in last month's survey — came as the National Republican Senatorial Committee spent $907,650 in Maine in September alone. The NRSC underwrote two TV ads aimed at a controversial wind energy project in Roxbury involving a company of which King was an officer. NRSC officials did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce also has contributed on Summers' behalf — with $839,000 so far.\n\nThe group launched what it called \"a television blitz,\" consisting of two ads that play on King's last name and portray him as out-of-touch royalty.\n\nBlair Latoff, the chamber's senior director of communications, characterized the ads as \"an opportunity to engage in this race and help move the needle in support of Charlie Summers. We believe that the more Mainers are reminded of Angus King's record, they are turning to Charlie Summers.\"\n\nMaine Freedom has put $359,000 into the contest, with half of that going to oppose King and the other half dedicated to supporting Dill. All of the latter money went to one media buy: the \"Feel Good\" television ad that portrayed Dill as \"a Democrat you can feel good about.\"\n\nMichael Adams, who is listed in an FEC statement as Maine Freedom's treasurer, called the ad \"very positive\" and said it \"provides accurate information that many Mainers might be unaware of.\"\n\nAdams characterized Maine Freedom as \"a bipartisan coalition of people who live in Maine or love Maine or both and who are focused on getting the facts out about the candidates for U.S. Senate.\"\n\nMaine Freedom, a so-called \"superPAC,\" has yet to file a breakdown of its donors with the FEC. The organization is based not in Maine but rather out of a law office blocks from the U.S. Capitol.\n\nAdams, a Washington, D.C., and Louisville partner for the Dinsmore law firm, serves as general counsel for the Republican Governors Association. According to his biography on the firm's website, he has \"guided ... efforts to elect Republican governors in the 50 states over five annual election cycles.\"\n\nTraditional political action committees usually represent businesses, labor unions or ideological interests. They are allowed to directly donate up to $5,000 to a candidate each election, as well as up to $15,000 annually to a national political party.\n\nIn contrast, SuperPACs are independent expenditure committees that are allowed to raise unlimited amounts from corporations, labor unions and individuals to spend supporting or opposing political candidates.\n\nThese independent expenditures \"expressly advocate the election or defeat of specific candidates\" and \"must be made completely independent of the candidates,\" according to the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics."
