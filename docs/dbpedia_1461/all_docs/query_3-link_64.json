        "text": "Members of the Olympia Snowe Women’s Leadership Institute at Medomak Valley High School meet with representatives of the institute. From left, front: Jordan Hays, Emily Grinnell, Makayla Wallace and Marcia Benner, Olympia Snowe representative; rear: Hattie Watmaugh, Emma Hooper and Frieda Hanlon, Olympia Snowe representative.\n\nLaunched in 2015, The Olympia Snowe Women’s Leadership Institute is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization founded by former U.S. Sen. Olympia J. Snowe to elevate the confidence and aspirations of high school girls by helping them build the leadership, collaboration and problem-solving skills needed to become successful in their lives, families, careers and communities. Young women are selected in their sophomore year of high school by school staff to participate in the three-year program.\n\nThe Harold Alfond Foundation pledged Thursday to provide $1.4 million in a matching grant program to support the development of a new generation of female leaders.\n\nGreg Powell, chairman of the foundation, made his announcement at a luncheon celebrating the Olympia Snowe Women’s Leadership Institute, which offers leadership opportunities to girls in high schools throughout Maine. The money, offered as a 1 to 1 match, is intended to leverage a $2.8 million endowment to expand and sustain the program, now in its second year.\n\nThe inaugural class of Olympia’s Leaders, 49 young women from Androscoggin County, told the Institute they wanted to stay better connected with their peers, advisors and with the Institute. We listened. This year, thanks to MEMIC, we have launched Canvas, an online Learning Management System that not only allows the Institute to deliver program content and training, but also creates a private, online community where Olympia’s Leaders can discuss issues, encourage one another, challenge ideas, connect with their advisors and stay in touch with the Institute. As we welcome 105 sophomores from all 16 counties this technology and connectivity will have a positive impact on how the participants engage with one another and the program.\n\nIn mid-September Kristina Jenkins joined our team as Director of Philanthropy. She is responsible for developing and executing the annual fundraising plan to ensure financial support for the strategic goals of the Institute. The position also manages direct solicitations and stewardship activities for corporate, individual and foundation donors.\n\nKristina comes to the Institute from the Pine Tree Council, Boy Scouts of America where she managed a $3.5m capital campaign to rebuild their four camp properties in Southern Maine. Her responsibilities included the management of all levels and types of donors. As a former President and active sustaining member of the Junior League of Portland, Kristina has long supported women’s leadership training and believes joining the Olympia Snowe Women’s Leadership Institute is a wonderful opportunity to put her passions to work to support young women in Maine.\n\nFormer U.S. Sen. Olympia Snowe left the Senate in 2013 after her third six-year term and a lengthy political career, but she hasn’t slipped into seclusion. Instead, Snowe is focusing on raising aspirations and confidence in future generations of Maine women.\n\nSnowe, orphaned at age 9 and widowed at 26, knows from her observations and experiences what the studies show: that between elementary and high school, girls’ self-esteem drops, on average, 3.5 times more than boys’.\n\n“Everywhere I go, I hear these same concerns about girls lacking the confidence to be what they have the ability to be. So I decided to do something about it and founded the Institute,” Snowe said. “By assisting more young women to be grounded in their values, find their voice and create a network of support, we will help them on a path to fulfill their potential.”"
