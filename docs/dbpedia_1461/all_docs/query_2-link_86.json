        "text": "Retired US Navy pilot Thomas (Tom) Vecchiolla has been appointed to the QinetiQ SSA Board of Directors.\n\nThe QinetiQ SSA Board was established in July 2020 after an agreement was reached with the US Defense Counterintelligence & Security Agency to operate all of QinetiQ US’s defense and security operations under a new Special Security Agreement (SSA).\n\nJohn Hillen, Chair of the QinetiQ SSA Board, said: “We welcome Tom to the Board. His expert knowledge of national security gained from active duty, public service, and leadership roles in the defense industry will be invaluable in helping us to grow in the US market.”\n\nSteve Wadey, QinetiQ Group CEO added: “Tom’s 40 years’ of experience in leading and growing multinational organisations will be a significant asset to our SSA Board. I look forward to working with him as we drive long-term, sustainable growth in the US.”\n\nTom currently serves as a Director for manufacturer Gencor Industries, Inc., having previously held the role of Chairman and CEO at technology company First Light Acquisition Group, Inc.\n\nHe began his career in the US military, spending 22 years as a US Navy pilot. Before retiring at the rank of Captain he served in operations in the western Pacific, Indian Ocean, and the Arabian Gulf, also commanding a helicopter squadron in San Diego, California.\n\nContinuing his public service, Tom served as a National Security and Military Affairs Advisor to former U.S. Senators Olympia Snowe and William S. Cohen.\n\nIn the early 2000’s he moved to the private sector, spending 15 years working for defense technology experts Raytheon – now Raytheon Technologies Corporation (RTX) – culminating his employment there as President of Raytheon International Inc., where he was responsible for global operations.\n\nTom holds a Bachelor of Science degree from the US Naval Academy and a Master of Science degree from the University of Southern California. He maintains his certifications as a general aviation pilot and is a recipient of the Washington 100 Award for executives who have demonstrated excellence in their leadership, innovation, and vision."
