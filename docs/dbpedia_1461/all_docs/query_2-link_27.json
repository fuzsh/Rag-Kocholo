        "text": "“When a broad table is to be made, and the edges of planks do not fit, the artist takes a little from both, and makes a good joint. In like manner, both sides must part with some of their demands.” —The words of Benjamin Franklin, as he addressed the Constitutional Convention in 1787. It is incredibly disturbing to note that the very concepts of compromise, consensus and bipartisanship, the cornerstones which enabled this fledgling nation to succeed initially, are the processes we are demanding to be revisited in American government today. Where have civility and good-faith based communications gone? Why do most of us feel that our government is broken and, if not repaired quickly, will suffer horrific moments that will defame our history? Olympia Snowe, the former Congresswoman from Maine, furnishes direct, frank explanations to these questions that are revelations for all who are willing to listen. She does not pamper the reader with her declarations, but rather allows information, perhaps heretofore not known, to be realized. Ms. Snowe’s tenure in the federal government ( first in the House of Representatives then the Senate), emboldens her spirit to inform the people of what used to be and what can be, once again. The statements in this book may not surprise you but they will force you to stop looking through rose-colored glasses. Fighting for Common Ground is replete with chronology that beckons the reader to recall significant instances in our recent history. Ms. Snowe discusses how communication, courteous behavior and working toward compliant solutions became the formula for great decision-making efforts during her term in office. In the process, she paved the way for other women in government and was consistently instrumental in making policy that was beneficial to the American public, and especially to women. Her discussions of dealing with all members of Congress, regardless of party affiliation, makes one’s mouth water in anticipation of a return to that process. Webster defines the word common as: belonging to or shared by each or all. In trying to find common ground, Ms. Snowe makes it very clear that compromise is not a dirty word. She also boldly suggests that we, the people, must take a stand. We, the people, must let Congress know that we have reached our saturation point and that somehow the cooperative intensions of our forefathers must be resurrected. We, the people, demand to see our government work again."
