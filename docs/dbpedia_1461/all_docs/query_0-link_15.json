        "text": "Congresswoman (R-ME) 1979-1995\n\nSenator (R-ME) 1995-2013\n\nOlympia Snowe is a former U.S. Representative (1979 – 1995) and Senator (1995 – 2013) from Maine. When first elected to Congress in 1978, at the age of 31, Snowe was the youngest Republican woman, and the first Greek American woman, ever elected to Congress. She is also the first woman in American history ever to be elected to both houses of a state legislature and both houses of Congress. In 2005, Snowe was named the 54th most powerful woman in the world by Forbes magazine. In 2006, TIME magazine named her one of the top ten senators.\n\nSenator Snow currently is a member of the board of numerous private major American companies; is a Senior Fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center, the Board of Directors of the Commission on Presidential Debates, the Senior Advisory Committee of Harvard’s Institute of Politics, the National Institute for Civil Discourse’s Advisory Board, and is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission.\n\nIn 2014, she founded the Olympia Snowe Women’s Leadership Institute to elevate the confidence and aspirations of high school girls and now serves as Honorary Chair of its Board of Directors. In May 2013, Weinstein Books published Snowe’s book, Fighting for Common Ground: How We Can Fix the Stalemate in Congress, that explains how Congress has become so polarized and what Americans can do to encourage their representatives to govern effectively once again."
