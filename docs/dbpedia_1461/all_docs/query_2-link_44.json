        "text": "Olympia Snowe never realized that one committee chairman had the power to stop a confirmation hearing. She does now.\n\nThe Maine Senator -- along with John Chafee of Rhode Island -- has been trying to gather signatures of Republican senators on a letter urging Jesse Helms to grant William Weld a hearing on his nomination as ambassador to Mexico.\n\nShe has gotten only eight so far -- including herself and Mr. Chafee.\n\n''Frankly, senators are reluctant to confront Chairman Helms,'' she said last night. ''They're hesitant to make a public gesture like signing a letter. I just think it's wrong. He's a stellar appointment.''\n\nBill Weld's banana-peel spill, from popular Massachusetts Governor to out-of-work crazy person, holds a lesson: The minute you settle for less than you deserve, you get even less than you settled for.\n\nFeeling restless, Mr. Weld agreed to get out of the way of Joe Kennedy and go to Mexico. Now he has been deserted by nearly everyone.\n\nThe Clintonites are watching the G.O.P. fight with relish. The Republicans are irritated with Mr. Weld for starting an ideological spat.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
