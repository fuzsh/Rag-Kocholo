        "text": "Reading Time: 5 minutes\n\nRepublicans are trying to peel away support from popular former Gov. Angus King, an independent, who is favored to win a U.S. Senate seat made more competitive by the retirement of senior Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe.\n\nMaine Freedom, a new super PAC, spent $137,000 on an ad supporting Cynthia Dill, the Democratic candidate and opposing King. The super PAC has some strong Republican connections.\n\nAs reported Friday by the Bangor Daily News, the group’s treasurer is Michael Adams, general counsel for the Republican Governors Association. Adams is also a member of the Republican National Lawyers Association, according to his profile at law firm Dinsmore & Shohl, where he is an elections lawyer.\n\nThe super PAC’s assistant treasurer, Erin Berry, is also a former lawyer for the RGA and previously worked at the Republican State Leadership Committee, according to her LinkedIn profile.\n\nRepublicans apparently hope to split the Democratic vote between King and Dill, thus giving Republican candidate, Charlie Summers, a chance at victory.\n\nThe RGA, a politically active nonprofitwhose mission is to elect Republican governors, is not involved with the Maine Freedom super PAC, according to spokesman Mike Schrimpf.\n\n“The RGA has zero involvement with the group. We are not funding it, helping with strategy, anything,” Schrimpf said in an email to the Center. “The only connection is the RGA’s counsel, Mike Adams.”\n\nTarget Enterprises, the group that made the ad buy for Maine Freedom, is a California-based media placement company. The president of the group, Adam Stoll, was senior adviser to the Republican National Committee in 2004 and 2008 and served as the national advertising director for the 1996 presidential committee of former Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan.\n\nMaine Freedom registered with the FEC as a super PAC on Aug. 16 and is has not yet reported its donors. The only reported campaign spending so far is Friday’s pro-Dil/anti-King ad, which was not available online at this writing.\n\nIn other outside spending news:\n\nThe nonprofit National Rifle Association Institute for Legislative Action reported spending $420,000 in the Ohio and Virginia U.S. Senate races, where the group opposes Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, and former Democratic Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine.\n\nAs part of a $250,000 ad buy, Republican nonprofit Crossroads GPS released “Mountain,” opposing Rep. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., who is running against former Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson. The pair are vying for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Democratic Sen. Herb Kohl.\n\nConservative nonprofit Americans for Prosperity spent $3.6 million on “New Ideas,” which was released Thursday and opposes President Barack Obama.\n\nOn Friday, Americans for Prosperity released “Washington-Style Reform,” attacking Rep. Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., for supporting the Affordable Care Act. Donnelly is running for U.S. Senate in the state.\n\nConservative super PAC National Horizon reported spending $192,000 on ads supporting Republican Wendy Long for U.S. Senate from New York. The litigation lawyer faces incumbent Democrat Sen. Kristen Gillibrand. National Horizon’s latest ad criticizes Gillibrand and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAmerican Future Fund, a conservative nonprofit, spent $548,000 on “Battle Born,” an ad opposing Rep. Shelley Berkley, D-Nev., and $183,000 on “Choice,” an ad supporting Republican Rick Berg for U.S. Senate in North Dakota. Both ads were released Aug. 22.\n\nThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spent $189,000 on advertising opposing Rep. Denny Rehberg, R-Mont., who is running for U.S. Senate against incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester.\n\nMajority PAC, a super PAC supporting Democratic candidates for U.S. Senate, spent $730,000 on ads opposing Rep. Connie Mack, R- Fla. Majority PAC released the ad “Tiger Blood” opposing Mack on Thursday. Mack faces incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson.\n\nSEIU COPE, the political action committee of the Service Employees International Union, spent $153,000 opposing Rep. Michael Coffman, R-Colo., and supporting state Rep. Joe Miklosi, D-Colo., who face off in the election for U.S. House in Colorado’s 6th district.\n\nThe super PAC of the AFL-CIO, Workers’ Voice, spent $118,000 on flyers, direct mail and staff support in support of Obama.\n\nUpdate (Aug. 28, 2012): This story has been updated to include comment from the Republican Governors Association and note the ad also opposes Angus King.\n\nRelated\n\nHelp support this work\n\nPublic Integrity doesn’t have paywalls and doesn’t accept advertising so that our investigative reporting can have the widest possible impact on addressing inequality in the U.S. Our work is possible thanks to support from people like you."
