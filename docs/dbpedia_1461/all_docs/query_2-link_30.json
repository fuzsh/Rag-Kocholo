        "text": "Thank you, Regan St Pierre for sharing this with me. As the mother of an autistic teen girl who has myriad strengths, I am grateful to know there are people like Carrie Cook in the world who can help her navigate overwhelming situations and environments, like airports, if I am not with her. If I could do anything for my autistic/disabled child, it would not be to change anything about her, or even her diagnoses. Rather, it would be to change people's mindsets to be more inclusive and welcoming; systems to be more inclusive and mindful of accommodations needed by humans; cultures to challenge stereotypes and embrace all members of society so everyone knows they belong, matter, and can thrive; the world and all its leaders to place greater value on, and resources to support and advocate for, inclusion and basic human rights. What can we do as individuals? We can look around us and the rooms we inhabit and ask ourselves who is missing at the table. Then, make time to connect with those individuals and groups and invite them to the table. And then make sure their seat fits their needs, invite them to speak/share/question, listen to their ideas/input/opinions/perspective, and include it in the programs/solutions/initiatives you are designing. #inclusion #inclusionmatters #bethechange\n\n\"1. Some of the best days of your life will seem like the hardest at the time. 2. Motherhood takes time to settle into. You can never truly be prepared for what’s in store for you as a new mama; all you can do is your best. 3. YOU know your baby best, even if you don’t fully have the confidence in your 'natural mother’s instincts' yet—I promise, they will come. 4. People will give their unsolicited advice; you may choose not to take it. 5. Just because your baby doesn’t sleep 12 hours, wants to be held close to you more often then not, and seems less 'chilled' than other babies doesn’t mean you’re doing anything wrong. Every baby is different (and that’s the point). 6. Your baby will be your biggest teacher, your biggest expander, and your biggest mirror to heal. You can choose to be a victim to the 'hard' times, or use them to heal, grow, and evolve into the best version of you. 7. A 'bad' day/night is usually followed by a good one. (This advice got me THROUGH some tougher early days.) 8. Maiden to mother is the biggest transition a woman could ever go through—CUT YOURSELF SOME SLACK MAMA. You’re doing unbelievably well. 9. Be present as much as you can; time is a THIEF. 10. It’s okay to say no to visitors/plans if on the day it feels too overwhelming. 11. People say, 'The dishes can wait,' but I found prioritizing a tidy home (as much as possible) helped me to feel calmer and less overwhelmed. 12. Coffee. Coffee. Lots of coffee.\" For our best love stories, subscribe to Living Better by Love What Matters: https://lnkd.in/eqehgfms Shared with permission via Victoria Gaynor #LoveWhatMatters\n\nDon’t take me lightly……. ☺️ Babies face challenges head-on, showing us that resilience is our greatest asset - Medicareer Life's most profound lessons often come from the simplest and purest sources. Here's what we can learn from the tiniest humans among us: Curiosity: They're born with an insatiable curiosity. Let's keep our wonder for the world alive. Authenticity: Babies are unapologetically themselves. Embrace your true self. Adaptability: They quickly adjust to new surroundings. Be open to change. Patience: Babies teach us the value of patience. Sometimes, things take time. Simplicity: They find joy in the simplest of things. Don't overcomplicate life. Unconditional Love: Babies love without judgment. Practice kindness and love. Communication: Though non-verbal, they express their needs. Effective communication is key. Joy in Small Moments: Celebrate small victories and find joy in everyday life. Let's carry these lessons from the crib to our daily lives. The wisdom of a newborn can guide us to lead happier, more fulfilling lives. #LifeLessons #NewbornWisdom #LearnFromBabies #SimpleJoys #medicareer #doctors #hospitals #jobs #hr #ceo\n\nMotherhood. It’s sitting in a dark room with little hands reaching for your face, begging for sleep while simultaneously aching to be close to your baby. It’s being covered in milk stains, in pain from engorgement but being thankful you can provide for your child. It’s jumping back into your career after twelve weeks when your body isn’t healed, partly because you have to and partly because you want to. It’s going to an event because you crave adult interaction yet you’re left chasing after your kids the whole time. It’s making chicken nuggets for dinner and discovering your child no longer likes chicken nuggets…or at least not this week. It’s asking for a break and immediately regretting it because you want to be with your kids. It’s juggling work and sick babies all winter long, running yourself down enough so that you too eventually get sick. It’s watching your body bleed, break and heal for a love you could have never imagined and wanting to do it all over again. It’s coming to terms with your current baby being your last baby, even when it makes your heart hurt. It’s all of these things and so much more. Motherhood is a journey. A hell of a ride as they say, and it’s one I’m happy to be on. Happy Mother’s Day to all the moms, soon-to-be moms, those longing to be moms, and those missing their moms. This one’s for you 💖 #mothersday #motherhoodunplugged #workingmom\n\nThis may be controversial, but I am writing this post from the bath, to which I have retreated with a coffee and a pain au choc - leaving my kids in the living room on screens - in an act of what can only be described as self-preservation. Last night was brutal. My 6yo's persistent cough turned into full-blown croup around 1am. At 4am my 3yo lost her bunny. Very little sleep was had. This morning we had the tantrum to end all tantrums before nursery followed by hours of to- and fro-ing from doctor to chemist and back again trying to get my son's meds. When I asked the nursery if they could keep my daughter longer I was informed that yet another sickness bug was doing the rounds. As I queued in the pharmacy thinking that at least my shingles recovery was going well I realised I could feel a sore throat coming on. My thoughts finally turned to work. Because, let's not forget, this is meant to be a WORKING day! \"Can we have fish and chips for lunch Mummy?\" (6yo) You betcha kiddo. \"Can I have a chocolate croissant and a babycino?\" (3yo) Sure thing. Treats all round. Everyone home. Settled. Now, what does Mummy need? Mummy needs to drink some water. Settle her nervous system. Breathe and reset for the afternoon ahead (when somehow she really does need to find the time to get some work done). So that's what Mummy is doing. Without guilt. Without shame. Sharing for anyone who needs to hear this today. We matter too, Mamas. Please don't forget that. #mumguilt #momguilt #maternalguilt #workingmum #workingmother #workingmom #selfpreservation #selfcare #motherhood\n\nAt a recent Mum Talks event, I had the opportunity to delve into a crucial topic: \"Nurturing Your Health in Motherhood.\" In the beautiful yet often challenging journey of motherhood, it's essential to recognise that we all face unique struggles and pressures, regardless of our circumstances so it's crucial to give yourself compassion and acknowledge that you are doing your best. Many of us, myself included, tend to place pressure on ourselves to be the perfect mum. We are constantly receiving messages about what a good mum should look like from society, social media, colleagues, and even family and friends. These messages start early in our lives, and we often internalise them, even when they don't fully align with our beliefs. But here's the truth: self-compassion and self-care are not selfish. They are essential for our well-being and our ability to be the best versions of ourselves for our families. It's time we start bringing awareness to the pressure we put on ourselves and the ingrained messages about motherhood we might hold. Moreover, our kids watch and learn from us every day, and being a role model for them goes beyond teaching them to share or say please and thank you. It's about role modelling to them that we can love and look after others while also directing that love and attention towards oneself. We can choose to embrace self-compassion and self-care, tomorrow I will be delving further into how. #Motherhood #motherhoodstress #mumstress #motherwellness #selfcareformums #stressmanagement #wellbeing #selfhealth #SelfCare #investinyourself #Cork\n\nPrefacing this with- I’m not pregnant or miscarrying or anything like that. ⬇️ Portals are for moving through. The very nature of a portal is forward moving energy. Sometimes it feels like we are sitting in it, but we aren’t. We are being rapidly moved forward towards a new version of ourselves. And while we get to choose how we move through it, once we’re in it there’s no going back. It’s an unmistakeable knowing that something is shifting and it will shift, no matter how tightly we hold on to the current version of reality. It’s knowing that the rollercoaster has left and there’s no way you can stop it. It’s drinking ay*huasca and surrendering to the journey you’re about to be taken on. Each death is a coming home to yourself. A stripping back of another layer. That’s why it’s like a glow up. I’ve seen it in my clients countless times. Releasing pain, shame and guilt and living a heart wide open life is the real glow up. So don’t get a facial ladies, surrender to the death portal 😂 #TraumaHealingLondon #SomaticHealing #MindBodyHealing #HealingFromTrauma #LondonTherapy #TraumaRecovery #LondonHealingCommunity #LondonWellness #SomaticExperience #Healing #Trauma #TraumaHealing #glow #innerglow #linkedin #linkedinpost #linkedincontent #linkedindaily\n\n\"I told my husband one day that I was having mood swings.\" He told me he doesn't believe in that. He sees it as an excuse to condone some unnecessary behaviors. I knew he was right (even though, I didn't tell him that). Our emotions are products of our thoughts; what we think about what is happening to us at the moment, our past experiences, and even our expectations. For instance, when you are in a lit mood, it could be that someone said some nice words to you and you keep thinking about them. Or maybe you had some good stuff happening to you at that moment, or there are beautiful promises for tomorrow that have sparked some hope in you. Same thing when you feel bad; There might be some bad news or you are already entertaining some negative thoughts Think about it, your mind cannot be filled with negative thoughts and you feel good or happy... It's largely impossible. Even when I was pregnant, I didn't feel any mood swings, (and I counted it as the faithfulness of God because I did have a beautiful pregnancy journey). Unless I just wanted some baby girl treatment, you know😂 What am I saying in essence? When you don't feel alright when you are having big feelings...do some little examinations on your predominant thought...the answer to your problem is not always far-fetched. You want to feel good all the time, EMBRACE POSITIVE THINKING, Just as the scripture rightly pointed out in Philippians 4:7 \"Whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable —if anything is excellent or praiseworthy —think about such things\". Now tell me...What do you do when you have those big feelings?\n\nPrefacing this with- I’m not pregnant or miscarrying or anything like that. ⬇️ Portals are for moving through.
