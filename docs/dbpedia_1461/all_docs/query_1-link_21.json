        "text": "Menlo Park, CA – The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) announced today that the Honorable Olympia Snowe, former U.S. Senator from Maine, and the Honorable Kathleen Sebelius, former U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services and former governor of Kansas, have been elected to its Board of Trustees.\n\nSnowe had a longstanding career of service in public office for the state of Maine and is the first woman ever to serve in both houses of a state legislature and to serve in both houses of Congress. Elected to three terms as U.S. Senator, serving from 1995-2013, she is known for her work on budget-deficit reduction, fiscal issues, health care, women’s issues, and foreign affairs. Snowe became a member of the Maine House of Representatives in 1973, was elected to the Maine Senate three years later, and was voted into the U.S. House of Representatives in 1978. After leaving Congress, Snowe authored the book Fighting for Common Ground: How We Can Fix the Stalemate in Congress, drawing on her professional and life experiences as a policy maker. She currently is a senior fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center and is a co-chair of its Commissions on Political Reform and on Tax Reform. In addition, Snowe serves on corporate and nonprofit boards, advisory boards, and as an advisor to Square Roots, a company focusing on maternal and child health. In 2014, Snowe established the Olympia Snowe Women’s Leadership Institute to help future generations of young women become leaders by raising their confidence and aspirations.\n\nSebelius served as the U.S. Secretary for Health and Human Services from 2009 to 2014, during the passage and implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Her extensive experience in public office and health care policy include election to two terms as governor of Kansas, a position she held from 2003 to 2009. She also served as Kansas’ insurance commissioner and in the state’s legislature. Secretary Sebelius is currently chief executive officer of Sebelius Resources LLC, providing strategic advice to private companies, non-profit organizations, higher education institutions, and financial investors. Sebelius serves on several boards and holds numerous advisory positions, including as a senior advisor to the Aspen Institute, where she co-chairs the Aspen Health Strategy Group.\n\n“The Kaiser Family Foundation is delighted to have Secretary Sebelius and Senator Snowe bring their deep policy experience and passion for health care issues to our board as the country adjusts to a changing policy landscape and faces new challenges,” said Governor James E. Doyle, chairman of the board of trustees."
