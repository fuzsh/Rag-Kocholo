        "text": "The Olympia Snowe Women’s Leadership Institute in Portland graduated the third class of program participants in its history — including more than 150 young women from 36 high schools, spanning all 16 Maine counties. The graduations occurred during two year-end celebration events on June 2 and 5, that took place by webinar to respect social-distancing guidelines, according to a news release from leadership institute.\n\nMore than 750 students, advisors and school contacts participated in the institute’s 2019-20 program, which is a three-year progression through the themes: “My Values” (10th grade), “My Voice” (11th grade), and “My Vision” (12th grade). The evidence-based curriculum is designed to raise the confidence and aspirations of high school girls by helping them develop the skills required to be leaders in their lives, families, careers, and communities.\n\n“Olympia’s Leaders,” as participants are called, engage in unique programming blending statewide events, experiential activities in small groups, individual development and reflections, and tailored connections and networking with Maine’s business and community leaders. Throughout all three years, each Olympia’s Leader is supported by one or two trained volunteer advisors, who facilitate monthly activities and serve as a mentor and role model.\n\nThe 2020 Year-End Celebrations included remarks from Jelena McWilliams, guest speaker and chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; the Honorable Olympia J. Snowe, former United States Senator and founder of the Institute; and Christina McAnuff, executive director of the institute.\n\nIn her final words to the seniors, Snowe said, “My greatest privilege is being a part of your journeys of self-discovery and expression, and for the institute to contribute to your lives today while building networks of support for your tomorrow. No matter what is happening in the world right now, nothing can take away from the incredible milestone you have reached. After successfully navigating the challenging world of high school — and now a pandemic — you are graduating as strong, resilient, passionate young women with limitless potential.”\n\nThe program distinguished the graduating class of Olympia’s Leaders by celebrating each senior for their accomplishments with the institute and for their distinct post-secondary visions. All seniors received graduation cords, certificates of completion, and commemorative pins by mail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis fall, 97% of graduating Olympia’s Leaders will begin higher education, training and certificate-bearing programs, or military service; 68% will go on to attend Maine institutions; and 50% are studying a STEM field.\n\nThe Institute’s new alumnae hail from the following public schools: Bangor, Belfast Area, Biddeford, Boothbay Region, Calais High, Camden Hills Regional, Cony, Edward Little, Ellsworth, Houlton, Lawrence, Leavitt Area, Lewiston, Lisbon, Medomak Valley, Mount Ararat, Mount Blue, Mount Desert Island, View, Narraguagus Jr./Sr., Nokomis Regional, Oak Hill, Oceanside, Oxford Hills Comprehensive, Penquis Valley, Piscataquis Community, Poland Regional, Portland, Presque Isle, Sacopee Valley, Sanford, Skowhegan Area, Spruce Mountain, Westbrook, and Winslow high schools.\n\nThe local graduates:\n\nCONY\n\nOlympia’s Leaders from Cony High School included Katherine Boston, Emma Levesque, Meredith Lewis, Caroline Mosca and Mallory Turgeon.
