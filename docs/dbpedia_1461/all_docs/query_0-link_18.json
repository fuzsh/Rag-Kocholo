        "text": "SEN. OLYMPIA SNOWE, R-MAINE\n\nMEMBER, SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE\n\nDate of Birth: Feb. 21, 1947.\n\nEducation: B.A., University of Maine.\n\nCareer Path: Snowe served 16 years in the U.S. House before being elected to the Senate in 1994.\n\nRole in Health Care Reform, 1993-1994: None.\n\nWhy She’s a Player Now: Sen. Snowe is the only Republican lawmaker thus far to vote yes for a health-overhaul bill. Democrats courting her for months because of her moderate leanings, but an affirmative vote on final legislation is still up in the air. Snowe supports a “public option trigger,” which is not currently in Senate legislation.\n\nQuote: “My vote today is my vote today. It doesn’t forecast what my vote will be tomorrow.” (Oct. 13, 2009)"
