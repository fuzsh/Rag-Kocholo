        "text": "Politician\n\nOlympia Snowe\n\nOlympia Snowe, the Greek-American Senator who was elected from 1995 to 2013 in the state of Maine, a member of the Republican Party. Olympia Snowe was born in Augusta, Maine in 1947 to a father Spartiatis (Georgios Bouklis) and a mother Mytilenia (Georgia Goranitis). At the tender age of 8 she lost her mother to breast cancer, only to be dealt the fatal blow less than a year later: her father's death from a heart attack. She continued her life in Auburn, living in the home of an uncle, a poor barber with five children, while her brother John was forced to live with other relatives, away from her. When her uncle also died, she was sent to the Academy of St. Vassiliou in Garrison, New York, where he remained about seven years. One of her teachers was Athina Hatziemmanouil, a well-known and distinguished pedagogue. He returned to Auburn to attend High School and then to the University of Maine at Orono, where he studied Political Science (graduated in 1969). She married Republican legislator Peter Snow in New York in December of that year and entered political life, serving in the House of Representatives, with a primary interest in health issues. It wasn't until 1973 that Peter was killed in a car accident. She stands tall and continues to fight. In 1989, she married the then Governor of Maine, John McKernan, whom she had known and worked with since 1983. Three years after their marriage, John's son, Peter, died of heart disease. Olympia Snowe is known in Washington as a hard-nosed politician, and she attributes this in part to her father's tough character. He is a member of the Greek Orthodox Church of America. Time in 2006 included her among the \"Ten Most Powerful Senators in America\", and her approval rating in Maine in 2014, after so many years of success, was 79%. In 2012 she decided not to run for her certain re-election because \"a suffocating circle of party ideology has been created which does not satisfy me\", as she stated. Her place was taken by Agnus King, who is close to the Democrats."
