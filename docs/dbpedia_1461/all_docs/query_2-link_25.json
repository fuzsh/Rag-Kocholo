        "text": "Raleigh, N.C. – Olympia Snowe’s approval rating is down slightly since PPP last surveyed Maine in March, but she is still one of the most popular senators in the country. 57% approave and 36% disapprove of her job performance, a dip from 60-32. But in early tests, she beats two almost unknown possible Democratic opponents by margins of 42 and 47 points, and even well-known but less likely Democratic challengers, Rep’s Chellie Pingree and Mike Michaud, would fall by respective 17- and 19-point spreads.\n\nPPP’s Tuesday release showed Snowe’s vulnerability to a primary challenge as being less than it was before, partially because she has moved to the right a little in the last year or two. So more of the general electorate now sees her as being too far to that extreme than they did in March, but a majority still see her views as being “about right.” 53% say that now, almost unchanged from the 52% PPP found seven months ago. But those saying she is too conservative are up to 24% from 16%, with those saying she is too liberal down to 21% from 27%. Consequently, far more voters see her as belonging in her current party, the GOP, than before (47% versus 28%), and fewer as an independent (24% versus 41%). PPP found in March that she would still handily dispatch any opponents in a three-way contest.\n\nThough the last poll showed Democrats thought Snowe’s issue positions were more “about right” than too conservative by a 2:1 margin, they still say the same by a narrower 48-41 spread, a rare thing for a Republican. Because of that, Snowe earns 28-47% of the Democratic vote in the four matchups, a large part of her success in this Democratic-leaning state. She also wins independents by 24 to 57 points, and pretty much locks up her own party’s support.\n\n“If Olympia Snowe wins nomination for another term she’s close to unbeatable,” said Dean Debnam, President of Public Policy Polling. “Democrats really just have to root for her to lose in the primary.”\n\nPPP surveyed 673 Maine voters from October 28th to 31st. The margin of error for the survey is +/-3.8%. This poll was not paid for or authorized by any campaign or political organization. PPP surveys are conducted through automated telephone interviews. PPP is a Democratic polling company, but polling expert Nate Silver of the New York Times found that its surveys in 2010 actually exhibited a slight bias toward Republican candidates.\n\nTopline results are below.
