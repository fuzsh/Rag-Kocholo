        "text": "WASHINGTON, D.C. — A Capitol-based newspaper has released a list of the 50 richest members of Congress and U.S. Sen. Olympia Snowe is on it.\n\nRanked 31st with estimated assets totaling $9.88 million, Maine’s Repubilcan senior senator is on the list just ahead of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and just behind Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-New York.\n\nThe top slot in the Top 50, which was compiled by Roll Call, belonged to Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, who is worth $294 million.\n\nNone of Maine’s other three representatives cracked the Top 50.\n\nIn determining the list, Roll Call added the minimum value of total assets reported by each member of Congress on their annual financial disclosure forms and subtracted the minimum liabilities.\n\nThe list is not 100 percent accurate, though, because members are not required to disclose many holdings, including their personal homes or retirement savings accounts.\n\nSnowe, 64, has been a U.S. senator since 1994 and was a House member representing Maine’s 2nd Congressional District from 1978-1994. She is married to former Maine Gov. John McKernan.\n\nAmong the Top 50 are 31 Republicans, including Arizona Sen. John McCain, and 19 Democrats, including Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts.\n\nEighteen of the top 50 were senators; the rest were members of the House of Representatives."
