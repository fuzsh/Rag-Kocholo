        "text": "KFF is the leading health policy organization in the U.S.\n\nAs a one-of-a-kind information organization, we bring together substantial capabilities in policy research, polling, and journalism in one organization to meet the need for a trusted, independent source of information on national health issues—one with the scope and reach to be a counterweight to health care’s vested interests and a voice for people.\n\nWe are headquartered in San Francisco with a building in Washington, DC, conference centers in both offices, and staff members in almost every state. Dr. Drew Altman, KFF’s president and chief executive officer, founded the modern-day organization in 1991. You can read more about the organization’s history, mission, focus, and key programs in a president’s message by Dr. Altman.\n\nKFF is governed by a Board of Trustees, which is chaired by former Senator Olympia Snowe.\n\nWe are supported by an endowment that is supplemented by external funds primarily from foundations, which support KFF to undertake major additional projects we could not undertake with our operating budget. Virtually all our work is conducted in-house by our policy research staff, pollsters and survey researchers, and our journalists. Learn more about our finances and external funding.\n\nKFF is not a foundation and has no connection to Kaiser Permanente. Legally, we are a public charity (an endowed national nonprofit organization). Learn more about KFF’s history.\n\nOur People and Our Work\n\nKFF has five major program areas: policy analysis, polling, journalism, public health information campaigns, and health misinformation and trust. Learn more.\n\nExplore our staff directory.\n\nJoin our team – we’re hiring!\n\nRead more from KFF’s CEO, Dr. Drew Altman\n\nOur Offices\n\nKFF Headquarters: 185 Berry Street, Suite 2000, San Francisco, CA 94107 | Phone: (650) 854 9400 | Fax: (650) 854 4800 (Directions)\n\nWashington Office & Barbara Jordan Conference Center: 1330 G Street, NW, Washington, DC 20005 | Phone: (202) 347 5270 | Fax: (202) 347 5274 (One block west of Metro Center | Directions)"
