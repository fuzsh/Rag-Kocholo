        "text": "Prior to her Graduate School Public Lecture, Anything is Possible — How to Overcome Obstacles and Make a Difference, Olympia Snowe, former Maine US Senator & chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee Subcommittee on Seapower, sat down for a conversation with At Length host Steve Scher, ’87.\n\nRecorded on November 6, 2014\n\nAfter more than 40 years in elected office, former U.S. Senator Olympia Snowe departed from a Congress sorely lacking the qualities of pragmatism and bipartisanship that she so effectively embodied. In recent years, her hallmark penchant for reaching across the aisle has become increasingly rare, collaboration and problem solving giving way to gridlock, grandstanding and a closed door approach to legislation.\n\nIn this conversation with Steve Scher, Snowe discusses the waning influence of congressional committees, the Affordable Care Act and her role in grooming a new generation of Washington centrists."
