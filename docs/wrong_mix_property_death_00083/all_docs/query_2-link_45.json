        "text": "There is so much talking about the energy transition all the time. With our redefined purpose ‚ÄòMaking New Energy Work‚Äô, we emphasize that we at E.ON have rolled up our sleeves and are getting things done. That's also at the heart of our new campaign, which we launched today in Germany. Challenged by the demands and ideas of two-time Oscar winner Christoph Waltz, we stand up and show: It's up to us to make new energy work! I hope you'll enjoy the film - and identify with its message. #itsonus\n\nüì¢Exciting news! We're helping deliver a new solar energy project in Texas. ‚òÄÔ∏èEarlier today, we shared that #Bechtel has been selected by Sabanci Renewables, a subsidiary of Sabanci Holding, to design and build the new Oriana Solar facility in Victoria County, Texas. The new facility is expected to produce enough clean energy to power more than 34,000 homes. Bechtel is proud to be building solar facilities across Texas. Earlier this year, we completed Cutlass Solar 1 for Advanced Power, and recently, we passed the halfway construction point at Cutlass Solar 2 for Sabanci Renewables. Combined, these Bechtel-built facilities in Texas will provide enough renewable energy for nearly 100,000 homes. üëè Learn more about the work we are doing to build a more sustainable world where future generations can thrive: üîóhttps://lnkd.in/gaWQ-ryZ\n\nIn partnership with Advanced Power, we are excited to announce the completion of the Cutlass Solar Farm Project. This project will supply power to approximately 20,000 homes with zero-carbon electricity and eliminate 300,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions. Bechtel is proud to support America‚Äôs #energytransition. Learn more at: https://bit.ly/3XEutFC"
