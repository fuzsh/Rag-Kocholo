(2009), “Naked lunch: el discurso de la ad-dicción”. Chapter of the book El sueño americano. La literatura en EE.UU. desde la segunda posguerra. Comp. by TARDONATO FALIERE, E. 1st Ed. Argentina, Rosario: Serapis Editions. ISBN 978–987-24892-1-2. pp. 85-92. Naked lunch : the ad-diction 1 discourse ASNES, Mauro Leandro \"Writing is becoming something else than a writer\" Deleuze The intention of producing a critical discourse on Naked Lunch puts in first place the question about the construction of a theoretical framework and the definition of the object of reading. This precision is not minor when dealing, precisely, with a work that, from its content and form, challenges the constitution of the word, the discursive act. The novel escapes the traditional categories of the genre. It is a hypertext in which some signifiers refer to and prolong the lines of meaning, producing an elusive and inconstant texture. The difficulty in talking about Naked Lunch is that it is an object that precisely lays bare the mechanisms of discourse and communicative schemes, both intratextual -the relationship between the text and the reader- and extratextual -in the relationship between the text and the discursive universe. Such a crisis is obvious at times: \"There is only one thing a writer can write about: what is before his senses at the moment of writing 2 \" (p.219), \"The writer sees himself reading in the mirror as always\" (p.221). The absence of an intention of sequential narrative and the intention of a record of the flow of the word is explicit: \"I do not intend to impose 'narrative', 'plot', 'continuity'.... Insofar as I achieve a direct recording of certain areas of psychic process, perhaps I perform a concrete function.... I do not intend to entertain.\" So, if it is not dulce, is it utile? The answer depends on the function of the text, which again refers to the discourses from which it is constructed and through which it is possible to approach the work. The reading exercise proposed here is less an attempt to isolate and analyze the work than a reflection on it: a movement of the diction that constantly returns to that other diction which is the 1 With this little mark of a hyphen in the word “ad-diction” I build up the basis of this whole lecture considering the “ad” in the sense of the latin preposition meaning “towards” the noun “diction” also in latin. 2 The text quotations correspond to Burroughs, W, (1989) El almuerzo desnudo, Ed. Anagrama, Barcelona. From now on, only the page number corresponding to the quotation will be indicated.\n\ntext: \"This book expels pages in all directions...\" \"Kind reader (...) The way OUT is the way IN\" (p. 227). This conception of the literary work is not only opposed to that of the classic or European book, but is also close to the definition of the rhizome formulated by Deleuze and Guattari: \"... to proceed by forgetting and subtraction, to make a rhizome, to make machines that can be dismantled, to form means that allow, for a moment, to survive either this or that: crumbly notebooks in soups. Better yet, a functional, pragmatic book: choose what you want. The book is no longer a microcosm, in the classical or European way. The book is not an image of the world and even less a signifier. It is not a beautiful organic totality, nor is it a unity of meaning. When Michel Foucault is asked what a book is for him, he answers: it is a toolbox.\" 3 According to this model, the journey through the senses of the text is a journey through a plain: a multiplicity connectable with others by superficial subterranean stems to form and extend itself. In a rhizomatic model \"...each feature does not necessarily refer to a linguistic feature: semiotic links of all natures are connected to very diverse forms of codification, biological, political, economic links, etc., bringing into play not only regimes of different signs, but also statutes of states of affairs\" (Deleuze and Guattari, loc. cit.). The novel puts into play the status of discursive praxis relating social regimes that compromise the exercise of speech. The discourse of drug addiction is codified in relation to other discourses that, holding social power, are fundamental referents: the discourse of Science and other subsidiary discourses such as Medicine, Academia, Anthropology, Psychiatry and Politics. Faced with this group of assertive and rational discourses, the phenomenon of Drugs mobilizes a poetic voice exercised as a strategy of resistance that defines a certain conception of the literary. In this sense, the text operates on an object that is its own entity. The literary condition emerges as the result of a shift, of a difference between the discourses from which it is formulated and those which, at the same time, it puts in crisis. The text is conceived as a dynamic linguistic creation and is established in the midst of the field of power that discourses and institutions sustains. This is precisely the object of (a) reading of Naked Lunch. The text is an object of ambiguous entity and polemical effects. Like Drug, the text generates desire for itself. The Drug model, as a philosophy of language, disigns a point of view on speech as a catalytic agent of disease or disturbance in the body of the subject or in the body of society. In the essay-fiction entitled \"The Electronic Revolution\" Burroughs postulates that human language is an invasive viral system. In this theorem the symptom and the infectious agent are indistinguishable. 3 Deleuze and Guattari (1977), Rhizome, Ed. de Minuit, Paris. p. 59."
