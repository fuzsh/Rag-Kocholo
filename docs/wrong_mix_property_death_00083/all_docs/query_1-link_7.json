        "text": "This collection consists of materials by and pertaining to William S. Burroughs. It is comprised of five smaller sets of materials: Burroughs-Nuttall (MS 63A), Burroughs-Pelieu (MS 63B), Burroughs-Hardiment (MS 63C), Burroughs-My Own Mag collection (MS 63D), and Burroughs-Wiedemann (MS 63E).\n\nThe Burroughs-Nuttall portion of the collection consists of letters, typescripts, and clippings sent by William S. Burroughs to Jeff Nuttall, mainly in connection with Burroughs’ periodicals The Burrough and The Moving Times, which were published as part of Nuttall’s My Own Mag (see MS 63D) from 1964 through 1966.\n\nThe Burroughs-Pelieu portion of the collection consists of letters, manuscripts, and photographs collected by Claude Pelieu and includes materials by Pelieu, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and Allen Ginsberg in addition to Burroughs. Pelieu was a writer who occasionally collaborated with Burroughs. He was also a friend of the bookseller and publisher Mary Beach.\n\nThe Burroughs-Hardiment portion of the collection consists of manuscripts and typescripts, letters, photographs, an interview typescript, sketches (artist unknown), and notes collected by Melville Hardiment, a British writer, editor, and teacher. The letters are primarily to, from, or concerning Burroughs.\n\nThe Burroughs-My Own Mag portion of the collection consists of issues 4-9, 11-17, and one unnumberable issue of Jeff Nuttall’s My Own Mag, to which Burroughs contributed. Due to the bibliographically complex nature of the issues and the presence of cut-ups, burns, and other effects, each copy may be unique. The issues present span from 1963[?] – 1966. (See MS 63A for correspondence concerning these publications and some of Burroughs’ contributions to them).\n\nLastly, the Burroughs-Wiedemann portion of the collection consists of correspondence between Burroughs and Erik Wiedemann regarding Wiedemann's translation of Nova Express into Danish as Nova-ekspres, which was published by Stig Vendelkaers Forlag in 1967."
