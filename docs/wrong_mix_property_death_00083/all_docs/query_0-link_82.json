This article was first published on SwissInfo.Org web site on April 14, 2002. It is based on an interview of archaeologist Lawrence G. Desmond and archaeologist Juerg Leckebusch of Zuirch, Switzerland. It summarizes past geophysical research at Chichen Itza carried out by Desmond and geophysicist William A. Sauck in collaboration with Mexican scholars including geophyicist Rene Chavez of UNAM, archaeologist Linda Manzanilla of UNAM, archaeologist James Callaghan who is director of the Kiuic bioreserve in Yucatan, and archaeologist Tim Tucker of Puebla, Mexico. The purpose of the GPR projects have been to test the usefullness of GPR in the Yucatan environment, and to locate caves and chambers associated with the Castillo Pyramid at Chichen Itza. Surveys thus far have located a number of buried cultural features in the Great Plaza including a filled-in trench that may have been been constructed by the ancient Maya to access chambers under or near the Castillo Pyramid.\n\nClose-range Photogrammetry\n\nThe application of Close-range Photogrammetry to Archaeology: Chichen Itza and Uxmal, Yucatan, Mexico, 1989.
