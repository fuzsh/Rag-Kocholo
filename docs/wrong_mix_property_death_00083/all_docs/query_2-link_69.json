Wretched Darkness is a mature horror role-playing game where players take on the roles of anti-hero characters who must face the unknown and confront the supernatural and the paranormal head-on. It may may be played as a dark fantasy game or you can make it into an actual horror experience (468 pages).\n\nNote: As the other second Wretched editions this is not a full game but a setting. You will need Wretched Role-Playing Game (or other set of OSR rules) to play this.\n\nClick here for the print on demand version.\n\nWretched Darkness Promo\n\nDescription\n\nPlayers can choose from several factions for their characters, some already featured in previous Wretched games, such as the Knights of Cydonnia, BurroughsTech, Araknyd Brotherhood, Daughters of Ksenia and the Warden Foundation. By default, the game is set in modern times, in urban environments, where danger lurks at every turn and death is never far away. However, you can use it to play horror games in different timelines. Combine it with Wretched Époque or Wretched Country for a 19th-century terrifying experience, pair it up with Wretched New Flesh for a near-future surrealistic horror campaign, jump into the far future by using Wretched Space, or set it in any other age.\n\nThis book presents you with a sandbox-style setting inspired by the works of masters of horror, such as Clive Barker, David Cronenberg, David Lynch, John Carpenter, George Romero, Wes Craven, Dario Argento, Tobe Hooper, Lucio Fulci and Mario Bava, but expect sources of inspiration as varied as William Burroughs, Charles Bukowski, William Gibson, Paul Auster, exploitation movies and Leonard Cohen’s poetry. As a Game Master, you will find here tools and game mastering hints for running any style of horror game, such as Giallo, gore, supernatural, psychological, apocalyptic, surreal, sci-fi horror and more.\n\nClick on the title below for a:\n\nWretched Darkness 2nd edition Preview\n\nRelated"
