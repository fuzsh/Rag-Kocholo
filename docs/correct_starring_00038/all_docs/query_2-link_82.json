        "text": "Year after year, HBO continually showcases how much of a cable TV juggernaut they are, always coming out with great programming from interesting filmmakers and actors. Still, they’re a business, and when a show is doing poorly in the ratings, HBO has to send it to the chopping block no matter the amount of critical acclaim it receives. “Enlightened” is one of those shows, unfortunately. HBO announced yesterday that they will not be renewing the program for a third season.\n\nThe series, which starred Laura Dern as Amy Jellicoe and was created by Dern and Mike White, failed to draw in solid ratings with only 220,000 viewers tuning in for the second season finale. The network called the show’s cancellation a “very difficult decision,” but Mike White saw it coming last month. “ ‘Girls‘ has so much buzz and not great numbers. We have less buzz and less numbers,” said White, in an interview with Vulture. That pretty much sums it up.\n\nSpeaking of HBO, Amanda Peet has been confirmed to play the lead in “Togetherness,” the upcoming Duplass Brothers’ comedy series. The show follows two couples living under the same roof with Peet playing Tina Morris, a “beautiful and energetic” woman who moves to Los Angeles to live with her sister and her sister’s husband, Brett. At the same time, Brett’s friend, Alex, winds up moving into the house. What could go wrong there? Peet stars alongside Melanie Lynskey, Ron Livingston and Duplass regular Steve Zissis."
