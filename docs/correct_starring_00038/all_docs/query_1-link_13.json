        "text": "Nothing like a dandy evening’s apocalypse to take the edge\n\noff recession, unemployment, Afghanistan and Glenn Beck. With 2012, Roland “Day After Tomorrow” Emmerich\n\nserves up World’s End 4.0, with cataclysmic effects showcasing what volcanoes,\n\ntidal waves and earthquakes will do once that fabled Mayan calendar runs out on\n\n12-21-12.\n\nDon’t mull over the fact that the Mayans couldn’t wait and\n\nended their world centuries early, the “If the Mayans were so smart, how\n\ncome there are none around?” argument. And try not to dwell on the general\n\nhopelessness this movie engenders. It’s “Apocalypse Three Years From\n\nNow” as simple spectacle — with moments of humor and humanity tucked into\n\na downbeat “Roland Emmerich Presents: Disaster Movie’s Greatest\n\nHits.”\n\nThere’s the volcanic inferno of Dante’s Peak and Volcano, the earthquakes of Earthquake and the cruise ship staring down a tidal wave (and losing) of The\n\nPoseidon Adventure.\n\nSeismic events all over the planet concern a government\n\ngeologist (Chiwitel Ejiofor). “Earth crust displacement” is coming.\n\nThe continents will shift and the world, “as we know it,” will end.\n\nThe president (Danny Glover) mobilizes the G-8 nations to act. Years of secret\n\nlabor ensue, with nobody knowing about it but a select few. Well, and nutty conspiracy\n\nbuff Charlie Frost (Woody Harrelson, well-cast). He spills the beans online and\n\non his pirate radio station. But sometime science writer, now limo-driver\n\nJackson Curtis (John Cusack) isn’t buying.\n\n“Nobody could keep a secret that big.”\n\nWanna bet?\n\nA trip with his kids to Yellowstone, “the world’s\n\nlargest (potential) super volcano” changes Jackson’s mind. And as\n\nCharlie’s predictions, based on end-days prophecies from Mayan and other\n\nancient cultures, start to come true, Jackson goes on a mad dash to rescue his\n\nestranged wife (Amanda Peet) and kids from soon-to-be-sea-floor Los Angeles. He\n\nwants to take them someplace where Charlie has theorized that “the\n\ngovernment” might be up to something — a safe haven.\n\n“When they tell you not to panic,” Jackson\n\nscreams, once he’s seen the light, “that’s when you run!”\n\nEmmerich packs his script with too many characters to keep\n\ntrack of easily. Aged musicians on the cruise ship (George Segal and Blu\n\nMankuma), scattered scientists, a Russian billionaire (Zlatko Buric), the\n\nnovice Buddhist monk, the White House team (Thandie Newton is the president’s\n\nart-expert daughter, Oliver Platt is a cold-hearted chief of staff), all face\n\nthe end their own way. Moments of pathos pop up in the usual places — noble\n\nsacrifice, people waiting too long to mend fences with doomed relatives, a\n\nsmall dog in jeopardy.\n\nWhat’s missing here is someone to root against — the monster\n\nin Emmerich’s Godzilla, the global warming-denying\n\nWhite House of Day After Tomorrow,\n\nthe aliens of Independence Day.\n\nAre we meant to applaud when skyscrapers topple and ships capsize, with tiny\n\ndigital faceless bodies plummeting into the void? You make the disaster this\n\nreal and it’s not entertaining or chilling. Like Deep Impact, another movie with a black president presiding over\n\nthe end of time, it’s more depressing than entertaining.\n\nThe cast, however, play this as if their next paycheck\n\ndepended on it. Cusack & Co. sell the cataclysm unfolding in the rearview\n\nmirror of an RV, through the windows of a small plane or, in the case of Ol’\n\nCharlie Frost, that glint in his eyes as Yellowstone erupts — the wonder and\n\nfear and utter satisfaction of a crackpot who can say, with smug conviction,\n\n“Told ya so!”\n\n2012\n\n3 stars (out of 5)\n\nCast: John Cusack, Chiwitel Ejiofor, Amanda Peet, Woody\n\nHarrelson, Danny Glover, Oliver Platt\n\nDirector: Roland Emmerich\n\nRunning time: 2 hours 35 minutes\n\nIndustry rating: PG for some mild sensuality, a scene of\n\nviolence, and brief incidental language and smoking."
