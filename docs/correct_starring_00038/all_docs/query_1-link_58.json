        "text": "The critical appreciation for NBC's rom-com series Bent might suggest she'll be busy on TV for some time to come, but Amanda Peet has still found time to join the cast of **Identity Theft, where she'll appear alongside Jason Bateman and Melissa McCarthy.\n\nAs previously reported, Identity Theft is Seth Gordon's follow-up to Horrible Bosses, and involves Bateman having his identity hijacked by - of all things! - a woman. It was originally more straightforward, but the screenplay was re-tooled for McCarthy after Bateman fell in love with her turn in Bridesmaids.\n\nPeet's role is unclear at this point, but it's her second time working with Bateman: the two previously shared screentime with Zach Braff in The Ex. If you're in the mood for some Peet trivia, it's also her second \"Identity\" movie, since she was in the twisty psychological thriller Identity, with John Cusack in 2003.\n\nIt seems that Peet likes to balance the lighter stuff (2012, the second X-Files movie) with the higher-brow (the next Terrence Malick film,** Please Give**, Syriana). This one's obviously in the former camp, but should be one to keep an eye on, given its pedigree. The original script was by Steve Conrad (The Pursuit Of Happyness) with the McCarthy re-jig penned by Craig Mazin (The Hangover Part II), and shooting starts in the summer."
