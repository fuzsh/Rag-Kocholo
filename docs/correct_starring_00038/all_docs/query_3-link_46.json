        "text": "Welcome to a new weekly feature here at Movies With Abe. In my love for everything Oscar, it’s always fun to speculate on who or what might have been included given different circumstances. Though there are twenty-four fields recognized on Oscar night, that still neglects a handful of key players. As a result, I’d like to take a look each week at imagined categories, and who or what might have benefited from their existence.\n\nThe category: Best Ensemble Cast\n\nWhy it should exist: This one actually makes the most sense given that the Screen Actors Guild hands out this very award, recognizing a cohesive cohort of thespians on their collective work rather than individual merit. It’s different enough from the Best Picture race, which rewards an overall rounded film instead of all the onscreen players.\n\nWhy it doesn’t exist: Unlike the Emmys or the Golden Globes, the Oscars hand out a small number of acting trophies each year: four. That makes the achievement of winning an Oscar for acting all the more esteemed, and awarding an entire cast would prove much more difficult and diminish from its impact. It’s also possible that these nominees would mirror the Best Picture nominees too closely.\n\nWho might have been nominated the past five years:\n\n2011: The Artist, The Descendants, The Help, Hugo, Midnight in Paris\n\n2010: The Fighter, The Kids Are All Right, The King’s Speech, The Social Network, True Grit\n\n2009: The Hurt Locker, Inglourious Basterds, Nine, Precious, Up in the Air\n\n2008: The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Frost/Nixon, Milk, Slumdog Millionaire, The Wrestler\n\n2007: Hairspray, Juno, Michael Clayton, No Country for Old Men, There Will Be Blood\n\nWelcome to a returning weekly feature here at Movies with Abe, Wednesday Oscar Retrospective. The Forgotten Five was the first in a series of projects looking back at the past eight years of the Oscars, dating back to the first ceremony I watched and closely followed. Since I started this feature back in 2010, I’ll now be filling in the past two years.\n\nEach year, a number of films are left off of Oscar’s Best Picture list. This year, even with ten nominees, films still didn’t make the cut. What I’m interested in looking at is the Forgotten Five – five films that probably came closest to getting nominated for Best Picture and ended up without a single nomination.\n\nThe rules are that the film cannot have earned any Oscar nominations at all. These are the movies that came so close and had buzz but just couldn’t ultimately cut it. If you disagree with my choices or think I missed one, please leave a note in the comments. This is designed to be a fun look back at some of the movies that may have been great (or not) and just missed the mark.\n\nThe Forgotten Five of 2011\n\nCoriolanus was the directorial debut for two-time Oscar nominee Ralph Fiennes. Though Kenneth Branagh has successfully drawn Oscar nominations from Shakespeare adaptations, this modern-day take on a famous play with the original dialogue preserved didn’t earn any Oscar traction, despite buzz for Vanessa Redgrave’s mother.\n\nMelancholia was a visually astounding apocalyptic tale from director Lars Von Trier, who previous films “Breaking the Waves” and “Dancer in the Dark” earned Oscar attention. His unconventional film may have turned some off, but not as much as the anti-Semitic remarks he made at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2011, which likely dashed his chances altogether.\n\nMartha Marcy May Marlene was highly buzzed-about in anticipation of its release, and Elizabeth Olsen seemed set for a Best Actress nomination after plenty of critics awards. The film faltered and got ignored, probably since the somewhat similar (and superior) “Winter’s Bone” had been released the year before and voters weren’t in the mood for another depressing and dark drama.\n\nShame probably intrigued as many people as it turned off with its NC-17 rating. Director Steve McQueen reteamed with actor Michael Fassbender after his first film, “Hunger,” to create a truly unique and compelling adult drama. Fassbender got a Golden Globe nomination, but that’s as far as this arthouse indie went.\n\nTake Shelter gave Michael Shannon, who earned a surprising Best Supporting Actor nomination in 2008 for “Revolutionary Road,” an excellent showcase for his talents in a strong, well-made psychological thriller. The film may have peaked too early, released at the end of September, since it was completely forgotten by Oscar time.\n\nTake a look at past editions of the Forgotten Five, and other Wednesday Oscar Retrospective series.\n\nWelcome to a weekly feature here at Movies With Abe. I'm going to be providing a handy guide to a few choice movies currently playing in NYC as well as several films newly released on DVD. I’ll also aim to comment on those films I have not yet had the chance to see, and I invite you to add in your thoughts on any films I haven’t seen in the comments below. Understandably, some weeks will have considerably fewer releases to address than others.\n\nNow Playing in NYC\n\nI’m hoping to get a chance to see Men in Black 3 while I’m in Los Angeles this weekend, though it’s not a priority since I wasn’t enamored with the second film. Chernobyl Diaries looks absolutely terrifying, not to mention awful, and you couldn’t pay me to see that. I would, however, love to see Moonrise Kingdom, though I’m not sure I’ll get around to seeing it in a timely fashion.\n\nNew to DVD\n\nCertified Copy (recommended): For those who don’t like subtitles, it might not be the best choice, but it’s not hard to follow the fascinating conversation that happens between two strangers in English, French, and Italian starring Juliette Binoche and William Shimell.\n\nPerfect Sense (recommended): This romance takes place in the near future, when a chef and a scientist fall in love while humanity is losing their senses, starting with smell, one at a time. It’s a bleak but engaging film with strong performances and a great score, very well-conceived in terms of its execution.\n\nWelcome back to a weekly feature here at Movies with Abe, Wednesday Oscar Retrospective. The First Five Forgotten is the sixth in a series of projects looking back at the past eight years of the Oscars, or further, in the case of this specific series, not to be confused with my first series, the Forgotten Five, which looked at the five films that came closest to getting nominated for Best Picture and ended up getting shut out entirely.\n\nAs Oscar season goes into hibernation for more than half the year, it’s a time to take a look back at past races. This time, I’ll be spotlighting the five performers that came closest to earning their first Oscar nominations and then ended up getting snubbed, in alphabetical order. If you feel I’ve left anyone off, please say so in the comments!\n\nFirst Five Forgotten in 2001\n\nHayden Christensen (Life as a House): Before winning Razzie Awards for Worst Supporting Actor for two of the “Star Wars” prequels, Christensen actually netted both Golden Globe and SAG nods for his performance in “Life as a House,” a film that was entirely ignored by Oscar voters. It’s a shame, too, since that and “Shattered Glass” are almost universally considered to be his only decent performances.\n\nCameron Diaz (Vanilla Sky): Between 1998 and 2002, Diaz netted four Golden Globe nominations and no Oscar love. Cameron Crowe’s mind-bending science fiction thriller was her first true dramatic role, and showed that she could be serious as well as seductive and funny. Since then, she’s made more action films and comedies, but that seems to be where her strengths lie following this surprisingly strong performance.\n\nDakota Fanning (I Am Sam): This young actress delivered her breakout film performance at age seven as the precocious daughter of a mentally-challenged man (played by nominee Sean Penn). She got a SAG nomination for that performance and a slew of strong follow-up roles in comedy, action, and drama. She may yet cross paths with Oscar, and her younger sister Elle is already following in her footsteps.\n\nEwan McGregor (Moulin Rouge): This Scottish actor tends to pick good roles in good movies, but he doesn’t usually get the attention for them. After a breakout turn in Danny Boyle’s “Trainspotting” five years earlier, McGregor costarred with nominee Nicole Kidman in the year’s acclaimed musical sensation. He only got a Globe nomination for his troubles, and if charming subsequent parts in “Big Fish” and “Beginners” couldn’t attract him Oscar attention, I’m not sure what will.\n\nCarl Reiner (Ocean’s Eleven): The now 90-year-old actor has won eight Emmys, for work both in front of and behind the camera. He got his best shot at Oscar as one of the standouts of a furiously entertaining ensemble in this insanely popular heist flick. Though it fared well with audiences, Oscar voters ignored it, missing out on what could have been an extremely fun inclusion.\n\nThe Five-Year Engagement\n\nDirected by Nicholas Stoller\n\nReleased April 27, 2012\n\nSo many comedies are about relationships. There are different stages within a relationship, all of which are ripe for jokes and entertaining plots, not the least of which is the transition from dating to marriage. In the last collaboration between writer-actor Jason Segel and director Nicholas Stoller, “Forgetting Sarah Marhall,” Segel’s character faced a breakup almost from the start, struggling for the length of the film to get over his ex while she turned out to be rather present in his daily life. This time, Segel found the perfect woman and didn’t let her go, but, as always seems to be the case, especially in movies, getting hitched isn’t as simple as it seems.\n\nSegel proved himself enormously capable of taking on a lead role in “Forgetting Sarah Marshall.” Here, as Tom, he’s less energetic and more of a straight man, reacting more calmly to most things and playing the jokes smaller. He’s paired with a lovely leading lady, the wonderful Emily Blunt, who has established herself as enormously capable in a variety of genres over the last decade. As Violet, Blunt is charismatic and likeable, and the two make a terrific duo, extremely knowledgeable at how best to play off each other for the greatest possible effect.\n\nLike all such films, there’s a reliable ensemble behind the stars. This movie draws particularly from the NBC TV comedy world, poaching Chris Pratt from “Parks & Recreation,” Alison Brie from “Community,” and Mindy Kaling from “The Office” to add laughs in their supporting roles. Rhys Ifans also takes on a less comic part and serves as a crucial part of the film’s plot as Violet’s professor. While some characters are definitely extravagant, none are too over-the-top to be excessively distracting. Pratt and Brie make an extremely entertaining duo as Tom’s best friend and Violet’s sister, respectively.\n\nLike “Wedding Crashers” and “Knocked Up” before it, “The Five-Year Engagement” has an above-average running time for a comedy, clocking in at two hours and four minutes. Yet it doesn’t feel overlong, incorporating plenty of plot developments and character transformations as its two protagonists experience highs and lows. It’s not excessively inappropriate or exceptionally clever, instead presenting a rather straightforward, perfectly enjoyable, decently dramatic and enthralling story filled with rich characters and amusing writing. Its many ups and downs feature just one truly lamentable stretch – in which Tom boasts unbelievably unfortunate facial hair – and the film manages, more often than not, to get itself back on track when it starts to derail. Throughout the film, Tom and Violet are more than likeable, and it’s hard not to enjoy seeing their relationship develop.\n\nB+\n\nWelcome to a weekly feature here at Movies With Abe, Thursday Triple Features. Throughout college, I would often head to the movies for three films in a row on a Friday or Sunday, and I’m excited to recall some of my most memorable experiences. I don’t necessarily advocate that you try this at home, but I’ll explore that as well.\n\nMy tenth triple feature experience, I’m sad to say, came over a year after my ninth. That’s what graduating from college and getting a full-time job will do to you. Like the two before it, this was also a trio of press screenings. Most interesting about it was the fact that there were two R-rated features, and the other was rated G. These three films couldn’t have been made for more different audiences, yet I got the unique opportunity to process them all together.\n\nJuly 6, 2011 Movie #1: A Good Old Fashioned Orgy\n\nTheatre: Magno Review 1\n\nTime of Day: 2:00pm\n\nRuntime: 95 minutes\n\nMy experience seeing this film was inarguably and unfavorably influenced by having seen the very funny “Horrible Bosses” the night beforehand. This film is actually fairly well-done, and contains a number of humorous scenes. It’s not as flat-out hilarious as it should be, yet it does make good use of its ensemble and probably deserves a second look.\n\nMovie #2: Winnie the Pooh\n\nTheatre: Disney Screening Room\n\nTime of Day: 6:30pm\n\nRuntime: 68 minutes\n\nIt’s almost impossible not to love Winnie the Pooh, and this new take on the classic character was quite warm and familiar. Clocking in at just over an hour, this film managed to revisit a beloved personality with a light yet perfectly amusing tale of his latest search for honey with the best of friends.\n\nMovie #3: The Future\n\nTheatre: Broadway Screening Room\n\nTime of Day: 8:00pm\n\nRuntime: 91 minutes\n\nThis off-kilter comedic drama looked terrific, and Miranda July proved herself as a director, writer, and actress in “Me and You and Everyone We Know.” This entry, however, was extraordinarily intriguing but not nearly as fulfilling, containing glimmers of glory but never quite reaching its full potential as a quirky independent experimental film.\n\nThe review: A decent and unobjectionable slate of films.\n\nThe grades: B, B+, C+\n\nA good lineup? I never would have chosen it had the screening times not been offered, but these three films were all relatively smile-inducing, which made them enjoyable even if two of them weren’t as satisfying as I might have hoped.\n\nWelcome back to a weekly feature here at Movies with Abe, Wednesday Oscar Retrospective. The First Five Forgotten is the sixth in a series of projects looking back at the past eight years of the Oscars, or further, in the case of this specific series, not to be confused with my first series, the Forgotten Five, which looked at the five films that came closest to getting nominated for Best Picture and ended up getting shut out entirely.\n\nAs Oscar season goes into hibernation for more than half the year, it’s a time to take a look back at past races. This time, I’ll be spotlighting the five performers that came closest to earning their first Oscar nominations and then ended up getting snubbed, in alphabetical order. If you feel I’ve left anyone off, please say so in the comments!\n\nFirst Five Forgotten in 2002\n\nRichard Gere (Chicago): The two-time Golden Globe nominee won his first trophy on the third try with his song and dance performance a famed lawyer Billy Flynn in the eventual Oscar winner for Best Picture. He got a SAG nod too but ended up sixth on the slate when he lost out to veteran Oscar nominee and two-time winner Michael Caine for his more traditional dramatic performance. This was probably the closest he ever got to Oscar, and if he couldn’t get nominated for this, I don’t know if he’ll ever be.\n\nRay Liotta (Narc): This excitable 80s and 90s film star returned with a vengeance as an allegedly dirty cop, buttoned up under a coat, extra pounds, and a gray beard. It’s the kind of transformation that usually means Oscar attention, but this crime thriller was likely too dark for voters. Liotta was excellent in this role, but most would probably cite it as his strongest performance, not likely to be repeated.\n\nAlfred Molina (Frida):\n\nThis British character actor got his first solo awards attention for playing the famous female painter’s husband. Molina netted a SAG nod, a BAFTA nod, and more, but only Hayek and the film’s visual and audial elements made it all the way to Oscar. Molina came close to Oscar again in 2009 with “An Education,” and he’s had no shortage of roles since, including playing Dr. Octopus in “Spider-Man 2.”\n\nDennis Quaid (Far From Heaven): If there was one lock for an Oscar nomination in 2002, it was Quaid, for his performance as a closeted gay husband in Todd Haynes’ gorgeous period drama. His snub allowed for Golden Globe and SAG lists to be merged, but his career best performance went unrecognized in a year when he also earned rave reviews for his lead role in “The Rookie.” Quaid did score a slew of nominations for his performance as Bill Clinton in the TV movie “The Special Relationship,” and continues to make occasionally good films.\n\nAdam Sandler (Punch-Drunk Love): This comedian got serious to star in Paul Thomas Anderson’s quiet drama. Anderson’s two previous films and his subsequent film all netted plenty of Oscar nominations, but not this one. It did get Sandler his first Golden Globe nod in the comedy category, proving that, though he doesn’t often shoot for it, he can turn off his goofy side if need be. His successive dramatic effort, “Reign Over Me,” didn’t quite click, and now he’s back to full-on comedy.\n\nThe Avengers\n\nDirected by Joss Whedon\n\nReleased May 4, 2012\n\nCombining six superheroes from four film franchises is no easy task. Films like this often fail to stand on their own, presuming that audiences have had the opportunity to see all of the previous films in the expanded series. The flip side to that coin is an overlong exposition, in which every character needs to be reintroduced again, for those viewers unfamiliar with their back stories. Fortunately, “The Avengers” fills in the necessary gaps with short and formidable entrances for each one of its protagonists, detailing their powers and purposes and preparing them for a monumental intergalactic fight.\n\nLike many Marvel movies before it, “The Avengers” is highly defined by comedy. The egotistical Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), also known as Iron Man, doesn’t play well with others, but finds himself in awe of genius Dr. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), though he’s not against prodding him to try to get him to shift into the Hulk. Most modern-day references are lost on frozen World War II hero Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), or Captain America, though he at least understands a joke about “The Wizard of Oz” that’s entirely alien to Thor (Chris Hemsworth), himself a god from another dimension. Russian assassin Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), or Black Widow, and Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner), or Hawkeye, round out the cast, each given the opportunity to demonstrate their skills, and their sarcasm, without the benefit of a previous film dedicated solely to each of them. Samuel L. Jackson’s Nick Fury also gets a handful of signature lines.\n\nFeaturing six protagonists means that there’s always a lot going on, and the instances of infighting, most of which involve the pretentious Stark, help to define these heroes. Tom Hiddleston’s Loki returns from “Thor” to threaten the fate of humanity, and, though he has a flair for drama, he’s most efficient when he sits back and lets the Avengers tear each other apart. Choosing just one villain, and his frightening alien army, makes it more possible to flesh out the strengths and weaknesses of the good guys, and it’s all but guaranteed that a sequel will give them another chance to fight evil.\n\n“The Avengers” is at its best when it’s in full-blown action mode, involving every one of its characters in battle and showing off just what they can do. The story presumes that Loki’s alien army would attack only midtown Manhattan, leaving the heroes to aim to save individual human lives in the midst of mass destruction reigning down upon them. Though it seems less than genuine at first, it ultimately works out, as the heroes, especially Captain America and Iron Man, are easy to root for, making their near-misses and eventual successes all the more exciting. Even if it’s not a perfect film, it’s better that it leave something to be desired, so that the sequel(s) can come back and revisit this truly cool and incomparable team.\n\nB+\n\nWelcome to a weekly feature here at Movies With Abe, Thursday Triple Features. Throughout college, I would often head to the movies for three films in a row on a Friday or Sunday, and I’m excited to recall some of my most memorable experiences. I don’t necessarily advocate that you try this at home, but I’ll explore that as well.\n\nMy ninth triple feature experience, the second featuring all press screenings, came less than one week after my previous one of that sort. Looking back on it, it’s probable that people have only heard of one of the films (“Please Give”), and most probably don’t even know that one. The random scheduling of these press screenings is really the only thing that led to me pairing these particular films up.\n\nApril 6, 2010 Movie #1: After.Life\n\nTheatre: Magno Review 1\n\nTime of Day: 12:00pm\n\nRuntime: 104 minutes\n\nThis awful drama about a woman (Christina Ricci) kept conscious by a sadistic mortician (Liam Neeson) after her death was entirely stupid and devoid of coherent moments. Ricci was impossibly lost in a poorly-written part, and not even Neeson could save this miserably boring thriller.\n\nMovie #2: Please Give\n\nTheatre: Sony Screening Room\n\nTime of Day: 4:00pm\n\nRuntime: 90 minutes\n\nThis quirky dramedy had an awesome cast, featuring Rebecca Hall and Amanda Peet as sisters, and Catherine Keener, Oliver Platt, Sarah Steele, and 81-year-old Ann Guilbert in the ensemble. Its multigenerational talent was well-utilized with a clever script and some truly biting dialogue.\n\nMovie #3: The Joneses\n\nTheatre: Magno Review 2\n\nTime of Day: 6:00pm\n\nRuntime: 95 minutes\n\nThis inventive comedy took selling a lifestyle to a whole new level, crafting a ready-made family of salesmen from Demi Moore, David Duchovny, Amber Heard, and Ben Hollingsworth. The movie didn’t stir up much buzz, but it was enjoyable, entertaining, and impressively creative.\n\nThe review: The first was awful, but I quite enjoyed the other two.\n\nThe grades: F, B+, B+\n\nA good lineup? Sure. I wouldn’t wish the first film upon anyone, but the other two went well together since they both utilized eclectic ensembles and were relatively light in tone.\n\nWelcome back to a weekly feature here at Movies with Abe, Wednesday Oscar Retrospective. The First Five Forgotten is the sixth in a series of projects looking back at the past eight years of the Oscars, dating back to the first ceremony I watched and closely followed, not to be confused with my first series, the Forgotten Five, which looked at the five films that came closest to getting nominated for Best Picture and ended up getting shut out entirely.\n\nAs Oscar season goes into hibernation for more than half the year, it’s a time to take a look back at past races. This time, I’ll be spotlighting the five performers that came closest to earning their first Oscar nominations and then ended up getting snubbed, in alphabetical order. If you feel I’ve left anyone off, please say so in the comments!\n\nFirst Five Forgotten in 2003\n\nMaria Bello (The Cooler): The former star of “ER” got Golden Globe and SAG nominations for her performance as the woman that made William H. Macy’s luck turn around, and she seemed a sure thing until a veteran heavy hitter and another newbie stole her slot on nominations day, leaving Alec Baldwin as the sole representative of her film. She earned another Globe nod for “A History of Violence” and is likely to brush with Oscar again someday.\n\nPaddy Considine (In America): This British actor came close to an Oscar nod for Best Actor when his two adult costars, Samantha Morton and Djimon Hounsou, managed surprise bids on nominations day. Unfortunately, Considine’s devoted father was left out, but he’s now doing quite well for himself, earning prizes for stepping behind the camera as a director.\n\nPeter Dinklage (The Station Agent): This little independent film had a hugely unexpected showing at the SAG awards with three nominations, and Dinklage seemed primed to upset the Best Actor race, as is usually the case with late-breaking SAG inclusions. Ultimately, the film was entirely shut out, but Dinklage now stars on HBO’s “Game of Thrones,” for which he won an Emmy this past year and is likely to win again.\n\nScarlett Johansson (Lost in Translation): With only “The Horse Whisperer,” “Ghost World,” and a few other films under her belt, the nineteen-year-old charmed with her breakout turn as Bill Murray’s muse in Japan. He scored his first Oscar nod, but she had to stay content with a Golden Globe since she’s not everyone’s cup of tea and some may not have felt her performance was terribly demanding. She’s not quite Oscar-bound these days, but she does have a great career ahead of her.\n\nEvan Rachel Wood (Thirteen): At age sixteen, Wood delivered an astounding performance as an out-of-control teenager that earned her both Golden Globe and SAG nods. She was ultimately snubbed in favor of a surprise nominee and another young actress, while veteran actress Holly Hunter scored a supporting nod for the same film. Being considered a costar with the also excellent Nikki Reed probably didn’t help, and Wood has done somewhat well to show that she has great ability, most evident in her recent performances in “The Ides of March” and the miniseries “Mildred Pierce.”\n\nWelcome to a weekly feature here at Movies With Abe. I'm going to be providing a handy guide to a few choice movies currently playing in NYC as well as several films newly released on DVD. I’ll also aim to comment on those films I have not yet had the chance to see, and I invite you to add in your thoughts on any films I haven’t seen in the comments below. Understandably, some weeks will have considerably fewer releases to address than others.\n\nNow Playing in NYC\n\nSad to say, after a productive week with four new films last Friday, I haven’t seen a single new release from this week. I really want to see The Avengers, and I hope to do soon sometime this coming week. That’s about it.\n\nNew to DVD\n\nNew Year’s Eve (mixed bag): I didn’t classify this one under “anti-recommended” merely because anyone who watches the trailer knows exactly what to expect. It’s not nearly as unbearable as it could have been, and a step up from “Valentine’s Day,” but that’s about it. Hardly the best romance blockbuster I’ve ever seen.\n\nNow on Netflix Instant Streaming\n\nAdaptation (highly recommended): This 2002 comedy about a screenwriter writing himself into his screenplay is exceptionally brilliant, featuring a superb dual performance from Nicolas Cage and a career-defining Oscar-winning performance from Chris Cooper\n\nAnalyze This (recommended): This amusing 1999 mob parody is clever and entertaining than to funny performances from Robert DeNiro as a gangster and Billy Crystal as his therapist..\n\nBig Daddy (recommended): This Razzie award-winning film doesn’t get much credit, but it’s actually quite hilarious, and features Adam Sandler in the kind of role he was born to play, not trying too hard and not failing too miserably either.\n\nBig Night (highly recommended): This food movie is delightfully appetizing and entertaining, featuring superb performances from Tony Shalhoub and Stanley Tucci as Italian restaurant owners preparing for their biggest and most important night yet.\n\nCruel Intentions (mixed bag): This 1999 take on “Dangerous Liaisons” is so bad it’s good, with Ryan Phillippe, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Selma Blair, and Reese Witherspoon starring in a campy tale of seduction and betrayal.\n\nGriff the Invisible (highly recommended): This superhero film is the exact opposite of what “Super” was and does a marvelous job crafting a fun movie about a delusional man who thinks he’s a superhero. Ryan Kwanten from “True Blood” and Maeve Dermody turn in magnificently charming performances.\n\nHannibal (mixed bag): This sequel to “The Silence of the Lambs” has its hypnotic moments, and Anthony Hopkins is operating at full capacity, but it doesn’t manage to capture the feel and awesomeness of the first film or the subsequent prequel “Red Dragon.” Some would say that has to do with the absence of Jodie Foster, but the film has other problems.\n\nLetters from Iwo Jima (recommended): This 2006 Best Picture nominee is the more somber of Clint Eastwood’s back-to-back productions about World War II, shot almost entirely in Japanese and featuring a powerhouse central performance from Ken Watanabe. It’s an effective, moving, and honest war film.\n\nMeet Joe Black (recommended): This 1998 fantasy film presents Brad Pitt as a humanized version of Death, being led around the world by Anthony Hopkins. It’s a dramatic, slightly overlong (just around three hours), thought-provoking experience.\n\nMr. Nice (recommended): This light-hearted drama is a caper film about a real-life drug smuggler who got away with a whole lot. Rhys Ifans is fun in the lead role, but mainly it’s just a great story that does get a little silly sometimes but ultimately entertains.\n\nMy Best Friend’s Wedding (recommended): This 1997 romantic comedy classic is one of the definitive Julia Roberts movies, in which she pursues her best friend upon his engagement. Rupert Everett steals most of the spotlight as her gay other best friend, but the whole cast contributes to this endearing comedy.\n\nOf Mice and Men (recommended): The 1992 adaptation of the John Steinbeck novel features strong performances from Gary Sinise and John Malkovich in a compelling retelling of a classic story.\n\nStarship Troopers (anti-recommended): This film is almost so bad it’s good, but it’s really just bad. Fighting giant alien bugs makes for great fun, especially when the actors - Casper Van Dien, Dina Meyer, Denise Richards, and others - are annoying, but this film is just hopeless in so many ways.\n\nTrucker (recommended): This relatively unknown independent film is a strong showcase of star Michelle Monaghan as a truck driver who finds out she has a son, and includes great supporting performances from Nathan Fillion and Jimmy Bennett as her son.\n\nWhat Doesn’t Kill You (anti-recommended): This rip-off of “Before the Devil Knows You’re Dead” is a mob movie that’s trying too hard, and focuses much more on trying to put on Boston accents than anything else."
