        "text": "The Mayan calendar's end-of-the-world prophecy offers \"Independence Day\" producer-director Roland Emmerich more chances to destroy landmarks in this effects-filled blockbuster, as natural disasters sweep the globe and rip divorced dad Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) away from his Yellowstone vacation. Racing against the doomsday clock, Curtis attempts to retrieve his family and find at least one place on Earth impregnable to Armageddon. Amanda Peet, Woody Harrelson, Chiwetel Ejiofor co-star. 158 min. Widescreen; Soundtrack: English. Three-disc set."
