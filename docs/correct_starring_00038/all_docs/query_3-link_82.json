But I like the idea.\n\n\"I play a guy who's been talking for a long time, the whole world thinks he's crazy. But he's been talking that there's gonna be hell to pay for what's been going on ecologically and everything.\"\n\nJohn Cusack, Amanda Peet, Chiwetel Ejifor, Danny Glover, Oliver Platt, Thandie Newton, Thomas McCarthy and Chin Han are already among the cast.\n\nThe film, which begins shooting in Vancouver next month, is scheduled for release on July 10, 2009."
