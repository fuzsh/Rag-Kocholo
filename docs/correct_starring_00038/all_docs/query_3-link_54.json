        "text": "A family fantasy (\"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\"), a franchise favorite (\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1\"), a modern romance (\"I Love You Phillip Morris\"), an Oscar winner (\"The King's Speech\"), a hit comedy (\"Little Fockers\"), an intense drama (\"Rabbit Hole\"), and a fantasy reboot (\"Tron: Legacy\") are among the titles arriving on DVD and Blu-ray Disc during April.\n\nThe films (with all release dates subject to change) are rated as follows: A (very good), B (good), C (fair), D (poor) and F (turkey). Films that have not been previewed are marked NP.\n\nCASINO JACK (Fox; $22.99, DVD; $29.99, Blu-ray Disc; April 5; C+): This darkly satirical tale, starring Kevin Spacey (\"The Usual Suspects\"), Barry Pepper (\"True Grit\"), Kelly Preston (\"Jerry Maguire\") and Jon Lovitz (NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\"), gives a sketchy overview of lobbyist Jack Abramoff, a wheeler-dealer who devotes himself to enjoying the good life through illegal dealings. He launches schemes around casinos owned by Native Americans and becomes the key figure in a scandal involving the rich, famous and dangerous. The late George Hickenlooper (\"Factory Girl\") directed the fact-based picture, which features an energetic performance by Spacey in the title role. (118 minutes) Harsh four-letter profanity, violence, brief nudity. (R)\n\nTHE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER (Fox; $34.99, two-disc DVD; $39.99, Blu-ray Disc; April 8; B-): Franchise regulars Skandar Keynes and Georgie Henley return as Edmund and Lucy Pevensie, respectively, and face new adventures and dangers as they ride aboard a royal ship that brings them into contact with various creatures while on a trip to the edge of the world. British filmmaker Michael Apted (\"Coal Miner's Daughter\") directed. (115 minutes) Frightening images, fantasy action. (PG)\n\nCOUNTRY STRONG (Sony; $28.99, DVD; $34.99, Blu-ray Disc; April 12; C+): Oscar winner Gwyneth Paltrow (\"Shakespeare in Love\") delivers a heartfelt performance in this clich√©-filled melodrama about a recovering alcoholic whose country-western career blossoms after she becomes involved with a promising young performer (Garrett Hedlund of \"Troy\"). Country singer Tim McGraw (\"The Blind Side\") co-stars. Shana Feste (\"The Greatest\") directed. (112 minutes) Alcohol abuse, some sexual content. (PG-13)\n\nGULLIVER'S TRAVELS (Fox; $29.99, DVD; $39.99, Blu-ray Disc; April 19; C-): In this excitement-challenged family adventure, starring Jack Black (\"King Kong\"), Emily Blunt (\"Sunshine Cleaning\"), Jason Segel (\"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\"), Amanda Peet (\"2012\") and Billy Connolly (\"Boondock Saints\"), a mailroom employee sets off for Bermuda but ends up in Lilliput. In that mysterious land, he towers over the tiny residents and becomes their hero. Parents should be aware of the rude elements in the film, including a scene in which a character gets stuck in Black's butt crack and another in which the title character literally urinates on all the little people. Honest. (83 minutes) Rude humor, mild language. (PG)\n\nHARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS: PART 1 (Warner; $29.99, DVD; $35.99, Blu-ray combo pack with DVD + digital copy; April 15; B): The original trio - Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson - return as Harry, Ron and Hermione, respectively, in this rousing first half of the seventh and last book in J.K. Rowling's series about the boy wizard at Hogwarts Castle. (The second part will arrive this summer.) In this installment, the three friends seek safe places to hide as the Snatchers and Death Eaters are out in force and pursuing them. David Yates (\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\") directed. (146 minutes) Sequences of intense action, violence, frightening images, brief sensuality. (PG-13)\n\nI LOVE YOU PHILLIP MORRIS (Lionsgate; $27.99, DVD; $39.99, Blu-ray Disc; April 5; A-): In this funny and touching comedy drama, starring Jim Carrey (\"Yes Man\") and Ewan McGregor (\"Ghost Writer\"), a married policeman has an automobile accident, reassesses his life, and then reveals to the world he's gay. During this fact-based tale, the former officer becomes a con man who lands in prison, falls in love with his cellmate, and then, after his lover's release, breaks out of jail four times to be with him. Leslie Mann (\"Knocked Up\") co-stars. Glenn Ficarra and John Requa co-directed. (102 minutes) Sexual content, strong sexual dialogue, language. (R)\n\nTHE KING'S SPEECH (Anchor Bay; $29.99, DVD; $39.99, Blu-ray Disc; April 19; A-): A terrific ensemble, including Colin Firth (\"A Single Man\"), Helena Bonham Carter (\"Alice in Wonderland\"), Geoffrey Rush (\"Shine\") and Guy Pearce (\"Memento\"), stars in this intriguing fact-based story about King George VI and how he received help with his stammer from a maverick Australian speech therapist. The monarch desperately desires to lead his people and worries that his debilitating speech impediment will cause their hopes for a brighter future in a dark time to remain tethered to the ground. Ultimately, the import shows how the monarch, through intense vocal exercises and great personal effort, became the voice of his nation at a time when his subjects wanted to hear him the most. The film won numerous Oscars, including best picture, actor (Firth) and director (Tom Hooper). (118 minutes) Harsh four-letter profanity, adult themes. (R)\n\nLITTLE FOCKERS (Universal; $29.99, DVD; $39.99, Blu-ray Disc; April 5; C): Cast members Ben Stiller, Robert De Niro, Barbra Streisand, Dustin Hoffman, Blythe Danner and Teri Polo return in this tired third installment of the \"Meet the Parents\" franchise. This story revolves around a birthday party for the couple's twins and the various problems the older characters are experiencing. (98 minutes) Mature sexual humor, language, drug content. (PG-13)\n\nMARWENCOL (Cinema Guild; $29.99, DVD; $34.99, Blu-ray Disc; April 12; A): Debuting filmmaker Jeff Malmberg directed this documentary on Mark Hogancamp, a man who was mentally damaged during an attack. After being released from the hospital, he built a 1/6th-scale World War II-era town in his backyard. Quality rating based on website and wire-service reports. (83 minutes) (Unrated)\n\nRABBIT HOLE (Lionsgate; $29.99, DVD; $39.99, Blu-ray Disc; April 19; B): During this unsettling drama, with Nicole Kidman (\"The Hours\"), Aaron Eckhart (\"The Dark Knight\"), Sandra Oh (TV's \"Grey's Anatomy\") and Giancarlo Esposito (\"Do the Right Thing\"), a happy couple's life shatters after the death of their young son in an automobile accident. John Cameron Mitchell (\"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\") directed the intense drama, based on the play by David Lindsay-Abaire. (91 minutes) Adult themes, some drug use. (PG-13)\n\nSOMEWHERE (Universal; $29.99, DVD; $39.99, Blu-ray Disc; April 19; B+): In this warm and winning tale about the seductive charm of Tinseltown, a fading movie star (Stephen Dorff of \"Public Enemies\") believes his life is in a downward spiral until his 11-year-old daughter (Elle Fanning of \"The Nutcracker in 3-D\") moves in with him at Hollywood's famed Chateau Marmont hotel. Sofia Coppola (\"Lost in Translation\") directed the modestly mounted production that captures the look and feel of Hollywood. Although the film isn't for everyone, those fascinated by the behind-the-scenes activities in Los Angeles should get caught up in it. (97 minutes) Sexual content, nudity, language. (R)\n\nTRON: LEGACY (Disney; $29.99, DVD; $39.99, two-disc Blu-ray combo pack; $49.99, four-disc Blu-ray combo pack with 3-D, 2-D, DVD and digital copy; $49.99, five-disc combo pack with the sequel and \"TRON: The Original Classic Special Edition\"; April 5; C+): Hard-core fans of the original might applaud this long-awaited sequel, but others may find the trapped-in-a-computer elements too repetitious. Jeff Bridges, who also appears in the original \"TRON\" (1982), Garrett Hedlund (\"Eragon\") and Olivia Wilde (\"Year One\") co-star in this special-effects-driven fantasy about a son who goes searching for his father, who has become stranded in the digital world. The extras include a look at the Disney animated series (\"TRON: Uprising\"), and featurettes on casting and visualizing. (125 minutes) Sci-fi violence, brief language. (PG)\n\nTRON: THE ORIGINAL CLASSIC SPECIAL EDITION (Disney; $29.99, two-disc DVD; $39.99, two-disc Blu-ray combo pack; April 5; B): The long-out-of-print 1982 version, starring Jeff Bridges, Bruce Boxleitner, David Warner and Cindy Morgan, has been digitally remastered to highlight the special effects (which were state of the art at the time of its original release). The expensive fantasy unfolds in a treacherous universe inside a computer. The extras include deleted scenes, an appreciation (\"The TRON Phenomenon\") and a documentary (\"The Making of TRON\"). (96 minutes) Action scenes. (PG)\n\nTHE WAY BACK (Image; $27.99, DVD; $29.99, Blu-ray Disc; April 19; B): Colin Farrell (\"In Bruges\"), Ed Harris (\"Appaloosa\") and Jim Sturgess (\"21\") star in this factual drama about soldiers who in 1940 escaped from a Siberian gulag and walked across deserts and mountains in search of freedom. Peter Weir (\"Witness\") directed. Quality rating based on website and wire-service reports. (133 minutes) Violent content, a nude image, strong language. (PG-13)"
