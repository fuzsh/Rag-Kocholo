Based on the 2012 phenomenon, its plot follows geologist Adrian Helmsley (Ejiofor) and novelist Jackson Curtis (Cusack) as they struggle to survive an eschatological sequence of events including earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, megatsunamis, and a global flood.\n\nFilming, planned for Los Angeles, began in Vancouver in early August 2008 and wrapped up in mid-October 2008.[4][5] After a lengthy advertising campaign, which included the creation of a website from its main characters' point of view[6] and a viral marketing website on which filmgoers could register for a lottery number to save them from the ensuing disaster.[7]"
