        "text": "This past Friday, October 9, saw the release of the deluxe edition of the Replacements' Pleased To Meet Me, the Minneapolis band's 1987 critically acclaimed success featuring \"Alex Chilton,\" \"Skyway,\" \"Can't Hardly Wait\" and more.\n\nInevitably when the discussion involves the Replacements clich√©s like underrated, overlooked and critical darlings immediately enter the conversation. But the Replacements, who are beloved by critics and musicians, but never had that breakout hit, never won a Grammy and aren't in the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame, are hardly alone in that category.\n\nBe it in music or film, everyone has those favorites that they swear by and cannot, for the life of them, figure out why everyone else fails to understand their magnificence.\n\nBelow are five of those artists for me, three from the world of music and two from the world of film. All have experienced some level of success, have been on the verge of breaking out or are hailed by a small section for their work but never, for some inexplicable reason, made it to that household name status.\n\nReplacements\n\nLet's start with the Replacements, the iconic Minneapolis 1980s act. In some instances it's easy to understand why the group isn't in the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame, despite being considered by many to be one of the greatest American bands of all time. The Replacements have a complicated legacy in some respects from their drinking and hard-partying ways. The legend of the Replacements is you never knew what you would get from their live shows. And I can attest that is true. I saw them twice, once in the late '80s at UC Santa Barbara and on January 16, 1991, during what was thought to be their last tour (they reunited 20 years later unexpectedly). The first show was, as I recall, a hot mess, what CNN would now call a S**tshow, just sloppy, all over the place. The second show was one of the best shows I've ever seen. That was the Replacements, the good, bad and ugly. But coming up on 30 years since they first disbanded that original music not only holds up it should remind everyone that at their best they were right there with the likes of R.E.M. as the best of the American alternative scene during that period. And frontman Paul Westerberg is in the elite of rock lyricists. The range of both he and the band is staggering, from the joyful alternative pop of \"Alex Chilton,\" \"I'll Be You\" and \"Unsatisfied\" to the ragged garage rock of \"Left Of The Dial\" and \"Bastards Of Young\" to the aching longing of the heartbreaking ballad \"Sadly Beautiful\" and the beautiful shame of \"Here Comes A Regular,\" like a Fredrick Exley book set to music, there was nothing the Replacements couldn't do musically. \"Baby needs a brand-new pair of eyes/Cause the ones he's got now sees only goodbye,\" Westerberg sings in \"Sadly Beautiful.\" Come on, Westerbeg belongs in the Songwriters Hall Of Fame on that line alone. But of course there is so much more, which is why artists as diverse as Lorde and Glen Campbell have covered the Replacements. And once you have delved into the brilliance that is the Replacements I highly recommend exploring Westerbeg's underrated solo material, especially \"Things\" on 14 Songs.\n\nAmanda Peet\n\nBetween a starring role on the WB series Jack & Jill and her breakout performance in The Whole Nine Yards with Matthew Perry and Bruce Willis, Amanda Peet seemed to be guaranteed superstardom by the end of 2000. It was only a matter of time before she was a household name. Or so it seemed. Peet has gone on to an incredibly solid career, with several feature film hits, including 2012, Something's Gotta Give, and Gulliver's Travels, among others. And her TV work has been equally impressive, with roles in shows like Togetherness and Brockmire. But for inexplicable reasons whenever it seemed like she was poised to take that next leap it didn't happen. She had a starring role on one a show that should have been a smash, the Aaron Sorkin-created Studio 60 On The Sunset Strip, which reunited her with Perry. But the show, despite brilliant writing and the stellar cast, only lasted one season on NBC. Even in that lofty cast, with Perry, Bradley Whitford, Sarah Paulson, D.L. Hughley and more, every time Peet was on screen she commanded full attention. In 2005's A Lot Like Love with Ashton Kutcher, she showed the kind of likability that should have made her a rom-com queen if she chose. Of course, a writer who has written a children's book and a play that ran at L.A.'s Geffen Playhouse she likely has higher aspirations than a rom-com lead. The common thread among all five of these artists is a refusal to compromise. Sometimes that makes the road to superstardom longer, but it is also more gratifying. As Peet, who earned accolades playing Betty Broderick in USA's Dirty John co-created an upcoming Netflix series, The Chair, starring Sandra Oh. So maybe not a household name, but she gets to do what she wants.\n\nWarren Zevon\n\nLike the Replacements' Paul Westerberg, Warren Zevon is one of the great songwriters. So admired by his peers, his music has been covered by Jackson Browne, Linda Ronstadt, Stevie Nicks and Bruce Springsteen, among others. And Bob Dylan, a huge Zevon fan, reportedly took the title from his Grammy-winning Time Out Of Mind from Zevon's brilliant \"Accidentally Like A Martyr.\" Dylan once called Zevon, \"A musician's musician.\" He is equally loved by his diehard fans, who actually started a Facebook group with 60,000 followers to get Zevon his deserved place in the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame. And like Westerberg, Zevon had a boundless range, able to write with equal aplomb the sarcastic and witty like \"Excitable Boy\" and \"Werewolves Of London\" and the beautiful \"Accidentally Like A Martyr,\" \"Hasten Down The Wind\" and the heartbreaking elegy \"Keep Me In Your Heart,\" from his Grammy-winning farewell album, The Wind. Genius is an overused word, but sometimes there is no other word to use. And Zevon, as a songwriter, was a genius. Just ask Dylan, Springsteen and Browne.\n\nJennifer Jason Leigh\n\nWhat distinguishes a truly great actor is their ability to be a chameleon, like the late great Philip Seymour Hoffman. Jennifer Jason Leigh has displayed that throughout her remarkable career, from the '80s comedies Fast Times At Ridgemont High and Easy Money to playing literary icon Dorothy Parker in Mrs. Parker And The Vicious Circle and Georgia. But unlike Hoffman, who won an Oscar for Capote, Leigh, who has had only one Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress for Quentin Tarantino's The Hateful Eight, Leigh hasn't received the major accolades she deserves. Also an acclaimed stage actress who received a Drama Desk nomination for Abigail's Party and a TV actress currently starring in the superb Netflix series Atypical, Leigh is one of those actors who everyone recognizes on sight but not nearly enough people know the name. But those in film, TV and stage know her name is synonymous with quality.\n\nPJ Harvey\n\nFor having released some of the most acclaimed albums of the last three decades, including To Bring You My Love, Is This Desire and Stories From The City, Stories From The Sea, Harvey has seven total Grammy nominations, though no wins and no top ten albums in the U.S. So for the moment she is right near the pinnacle of cult favorites in the U.S. There is hope though. Her former partner Nick Cave was a cult favorite for decades before graduating to unlikely arena headliner in the last few years. So perhaps Harvey will get the due she is accorded. But whether the mainstream recognizes Harvey as one of the most vital artists of the alternative era her fans and peers definitely know."
