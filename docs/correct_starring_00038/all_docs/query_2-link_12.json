        "text": "2012 – A Columbia Pictures release. Directed by Roland Emmerich. Starring John Cusack, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Amanda Peet, Oliver Platt, Danny Glover, Thandie Newton, Woody Harrelson, Tom McCarthy, and George Segal. Rated PG-13.\n\nYou have to hand it to writer/director Roland Emmerich – he just loves the disaster genre, like no one since “disaster king” Irwin Allen. Time and again Emmerich has destroyed landmarks, as in the films The Day After Tomorrow, Godzilla, and of course Independence Day. With most of those films critics have bashed him (especially Godzilla) but the guy keeps plugging away. His new film goes for broke. 2012 concerns the destruction of every country on earth – a tall order to be sure, but with state of the art computer effects, not a problem.\n\nThe idea behind 2012 is the Mayan calendar that foretold the destruction of the earth. What Emmerich and his co-writer Harold Kloser whip up is the idea that solar fires are acting like a microwave. The core of the earth is heating up and the crust of the earth will weaken and shift, causing all sorts of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tidal waves.\n\nFinding all this out is scientist Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofer) who a few years before brought it to the attention of President Wilson’s (Danny Glover) chief of staff Carl Anheuser (Oliver Platt). Following Helmsley’s timetable, all in secret, a plan is put in place with the nations of the world saving what and who (mostly the well-off) they can. This being a disaster film there has to be some human drama, or melodrama, and it comes in the form of Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) and his family, ex-wife Kate (Amanda Peet) and their son and daughter (Liam James and Morgan Lily) who are now living with Kate’s new boyfriend Gordon (Tom McCarthy). As can be expected, Curtis’s son is mad at him while Kate is not fully over him but in love with Gordon. Curtis is an author, well, a failed author, with one book to his credit, Farewell Atlantis, so he moonlights as a limo driver to the very rich Russian billionaire Yuri Karpov (Zlatko Buric). It’s very handy to know Karpov because he owns a big Russian cargo jet, which is very important as the earthquakes hit and land masses shift. Can Curtis get his family to safety somewhere in China? Will Helmsley’s timetable be correct, will the “arks” that have been built to save the chosen few survive the floods?\n\nThe thing that strikes you about 2012 is just how simple the idea is, not the end of the world scenario that’s been done countless times, but the idea to combine every major disaster film. That’s exactly what this film does. Want an ocean liner to flip like the Poseidon Adventure (1972)? No problem. How about an earthquake like in Earthquake (1974)? There are more than a few. Buildings on fire? They are here faster than you can say The Towering Inferno (1974). Cities flooding just like When Worlds Collide (1951)? You got it. I was half expecting a swarm of bees like The Swam (1978). That didn’t happen, but everything else does including Curtis and his family escaping one outlandish situation after another.\n\nThat’s the biggest problem with 2012, those escapes that Curtis and his family are involved in. They are visually stunning but so preposterous that there’s never any actual suspense. It isn’t until the film’s climax involving Curtis, his son, and the safety of one of the arks, that Emmerich is able on a smaller scale to come anywhere close to a suspenseful bit. The very early part of the film is pretty strong, though as Helmsley realizes the grave situation that awaits, but unlike the classic When Worlds Collide there is never a true feeling that there is a race against time to build the arks.\n\nThis is actually a minor point, because let’s face it, the effects are what have made the disaster genre work; that and in the case of those 1970s films, the all-star casts. Well, here the effects teams have outdone themselves. For the most part (some of the stuff involving water is weak) the destruction seen on screen is by any stretch impressive. As for the actors, Cusack is the good-guy “everyman” and both he and Ejiofer keep a straight face through all the action and so does all of the cast – no overacting here. Even Woody Harrelson’s cameo as a goofy conspiracy hound works. And it has to be said that Emmerich for the second time in his career does get to destroy the White House."
