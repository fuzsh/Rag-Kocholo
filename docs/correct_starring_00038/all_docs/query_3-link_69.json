Even if you’re the one initiating the split and aren’t the one getting dumped, it’s still pretty rough — either way, moving on from a relationship isn’t easy. That’s where movies to watch after a breakup come in.\n\nBreakups can tempt you to indulge in all kinds of bad habits, like disappearing into your couch with endless bottles of wine, calling up your ex, or some horrible combination of the two (not that we’re speaking from experience). But we’ve got a solution to your post-breakup malaise — 50 breakup movies, actually.\n\nSee, the old saying that you have to get under someone to get over someone is actually total BS. All you really need is a nice, long movie marathon, packed with characters who let you know that, no matter how bad it gets, you’re not alone. After all, crying on your couch into a bucket of ice cream alone is kind of depressing. Doing the exact same thing while Bridget Jones is also doing it on your TV is iconic.\n\nWe’ve come up with a list of our favorite movies to watch post-breakups: some funny, some inspirational, and some downright enlightening. We promise they’ll help, even if they’re just a soothing soundtrack for you to recover in. And, yes, The Notebook is absolutely part of this roundup.\n\nA version of this article was originally published in September 2017.\n\nCheck out the Best Breakup Movies on Netflix, Prime Video, Paramount+, Hulu and Beyond Below:"
