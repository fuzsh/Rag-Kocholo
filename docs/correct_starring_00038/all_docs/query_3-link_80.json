        "text": "Natalie Portman (may have) named baby...\n\nNatalie Portman has not officially released the name of her baby boy, however, the Israel Hayom newspaper is reporting the chosen name. Find out what unique name Natalie and her fiancé, Benjamin Millepied, may have bestowed upon their baby boy.\n\nBlack Swan actress Natalie Portman surprised us all when she announced last December she was pregnant and engaged to her choreographer, Benjamin Millepied. Since then, Portman has kept the details of her pregnancy and baby private from the press.\n\nPortman, 30, and Millepied welcomed their baby boy last month but the private couple has not released a photo or the name of their baby.\n\nWe have been waiting anxiously to hear their baby name choice. Will it be unique? Weird? Traditional?\n\nThe newspaper Israel Hayom is reporting that the couple has named their child Alef, \"like the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet.\"\n\nThey report that the Israeli television show Good Evening with Guy Pines originally reported the baby news, with their source being Portman's cousin.\n\nAlthough Portman has not confirmed the news, the Oscar winner was born in Jerusalem so a Hebrew name like Alef is possible.\n\nAlef is Hebrew in origin and is a form of the name Aleph. It means leader and, as stated earlier, is the first letter of the alphabet. Alef is a unique name here in the US, as it has not been in the top 1000 baby names from the Social Security Administration for the last 11 years.\n\nTell us: What do you think of Natalie Portman's rumored baby name, Alef Millepied?\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nDaily Celebrity Buzz for July 6th, 2011\n\nCheck out today's top celebrity news from around the web including Natalie Portman, Josh Duhamel, Jennifer Aniston and much more!\n\nNatalie Portman gave her kid some weird name - Access Hollywood\n\nFergie needs to keep that man on lockdown - Starpulse\n\nJennifer Aniston is taking a year off to do it with her new man - Betty Confidential\n\nWow, who knew Nicole Scherzinger was so bendy? - Amy Grindhouse\n\nGuys with a fetish for duck-lipped baby killers will love a Casey Anthony porno - Celebridoodle\n\nGuess Kim Kardashian is over that whole genocide thing - I'm Not Obsessed\n\nBetter bring a big box to Kate Hudson's baby shower - Babyrazzi\n\nTaylor Lautner does Funny or Die - Celebrity Smack\n\nCy Waits gets nasty - Hollywire\n\nSomeone actually hired Charlie Sheen - Celebrity Cafe\n\nRichie Sambora has great taste in women - Gossip Juice\n\nChord Overstreet is back on Glee - TV Fanatic\n\nMore Emily Maynard please! - Reality TV Magazine\n\nImage courtesy Ian Wilson/WENN.com\n\n↧\n\nLindsay Lohan: I should have starred in Black Swan\n\nLindsay Lohan says she should have been cast in the movie Black Swan, instead of Oscar-winning actress Natalie Portman.\n\nIn between sips of wine, Lindsay Lohan chatted with Plum Miami magazine writer Jacquelynn Powers about her sobriety... and her disbelief that she wasn't considered for the starring role in the movie Black Swan.\n\nShe said she was frustrated with her career and she \"took ballet until she was 19 and was indignant that she was not considered for the movie Black Swan.\"\n\nNatalie Portman trained for the Black Swan role for six months before filming started, and that included working out for five hours a day, seven days a week. As Portman was doing this, Lohan was staying up all night partying and was in and out of rehab.\n\nThe interview with Lohan took place before her house arrest. ?Powers said that Lohan ended up backing out of the interview at the last minute, however, Powers spent some time with her during the photo shoot -- and her appraisal of Lohan was not flattering.\n\nShe said Lohan was \"constantly looking for drama, whether it was picking a fight with her younger sister... or freaking out over a lost pair of Zanotti heels.\"\n\n\"As we pulled up to the Fontainebleau, a bright-orange parking cone was blocking the entrance,\" Powers remembers. \"Not accustomed to waiting, apparently, she lowered the car's window and shouted, 'Move that cone. I'm Lindsay Lohan.' And it was done.\"\n\nPowers said Plum magazine covered all of LiLo's expenses, including airfare and lodging in the penthouse suite of the Raleigh hotel. Despite that, not only did Lindsay back out of the interview, but she and her entourage refused to leave the hotel!\n\n\"Monday morning was supposed to be check-out time, but Lindsay and her posse refused to leave,\" Powers says. \"It was like watching the lights come on at a nightclub after-hours -- not pretty.\"\n\n↧\n\nRashida Jones says kissing Zooey Deschanel in Our Idiot Brother was awkward\n\nParks and Recreation star Rashida Jones took a break from her day job to appear in the new comedy Our Idiot Brother. In the film, she plays a straight-laced lesbian who has a great job and a hot girlfriend . The actress' new gig showcases her first lesbian kiss, which she admits was slightly awkward to film.\n\nIn Our Idiot Brother, Rashida Jones plays a lawyer named Cindy, who's in a relationship with the bisexual Natalie , one of the sisters of the \"idiot brother.\" Cindy is the first lesbian character that Jones has played and she was really nervous about shooting her big kissing scene.\n\nAccording to OMG Yahoo, not only did Jones seek advice from her lesbian friends but she also went to a higher power -- Oscar winner Natalie Portman. Portman appeared in a heated love scene in last year's Black Swan, so if anyone could give advice, it's her.\n\n\"I'm friends with Natalie and I asked her [what to expect], says Jones. \"She was like, 'Dude, it's awkward to make out with your friends - I'm just warning you right now. It's super awkward!'\"\n\nWhen it got down to it, Jones took everything in stride. She says, \"It was totally fun. I mean, it was slightly awkward, only because Zooey and I have known each other for a long time. It's kind of weird to kiss your friends. But, you know, she's so pretty - she doesn't make it that hard!\" she added.\n\nWe're happy Jones persevered because her character had more pressing issues to deal with. Our Idiot Brother centers on an ex-con, slacker named Ned who's released from prison and becomes a financial and personal strain on his siblings. Jones' character is just one of the many people, who get caught up in his ball of confusion.\n\nOur Idiot Brother opens in theaters Aug. 26.\n\nImage courtesy of WENN\n\n↧\n\nCelebrity makeup looks we love\n\nCelebrities always seem to have their makeup perfectly done.

The happy family was spotted at the popular Farmer's Market. Portman, a vegetarian, picked up several fresh fruits and veggies.\n\nSources report the Black Swan actress looked very low-key and casual. Wearing jeans, a t-shirt, a simple corduroy jacket, and sporting no makeup, Portman looked more like a regular mom than an A-list Hollywood star while grocery shopping. However, she was very protective of Aleph -- he was completely covered-up while Portman cradled him close in his navy baby backpack. Witnesses report she was all smiles and very friendly.\n\nPortman, who is engaged to Black Swan choreographer Benjamin Millepied, is taking it slow these days. She was absent from the 2011 Spike TV Scream Awards, where she picked-up the Best Fantasy Actress honor for her role as Nina Sayers in Black Swan. The critically acclaimed film also won Best Director . Entertainment Weekly also reports Portman turned down a role in an upcoming independent film, Adaline.\n\nThe last time Natalie Portman was spotted with Aleph was in September, when the pair were out and about in Geneva, Switzerland. Aleph was born in June and the family took some time to travel around Europe. Portman and Millepied, who is French, began dating in 2009 and became engaged over the Christmas holidays in 2010.\n\nImage: WENN.com\n\nRead more on celebrity families\n\nThird time's a charm: Tori Spelling has a baby girl\n\nAlyssa Milano debuts baby Milo\n\nMilla Jovovich has model dreams for her daughter\n\n↧\n\n5 Couples that will make you forget about Edward and Bella\n\nSure, Edward and Bella have the most talked about vampire-human relationship, but we think there will be a few new “It” couples that could take Hollywood by storm.

It was hard to narrow down our list of favorites, but here are ten celebrity baby cuties who arrived this year.\n\nBaby Bingham\n\nCelebrity parents: Kate Hudson and Matt Bellamy\n\nBorn: July 2011\n\nA second son for Kate Hudson, but a first with finance Matt Bellamy, this famous couple took their time selecting Bingham's name. They didn't find out the gender of the baby before he arrived, making it harder for them to narrow down names beforehand.\n\nBaby Aleph\n\nCelebrity parents: Natalie Portman and Benjamin Millepied\n\nBorn: June 2011\n\nWe all loved watching Natalie Portman shine throughout her pregnancy with son Aleph -- stunning us over and over again on the red carpet while she promoted her movie, Black Swan.\n\nBaby Harper\n\nCelebrity parents: Victoria and David Beckham\n\nBorn: July 2011\n\nFinally! A sweet little girl for David and Victoria Beckham! Harper joins three older brothers, Cruz, Brooklyn and Romeo, and there's no doubt that this mini-fashionista will be in sky-high stilettos by the time she hits preschool.\n\nBaby Hattie\n\nCelebrity parents: Tori Spelling and Dean McDermott\n\nBorn: October 2011\n\nA celebrity mom who shares it all when it comes to parenting, Tori Spelling welcomed her third child, Hattie, in 2011. And we really mean Tori shares it all -- husband Dean accidentally tweeted a picture of Tori topless while she was in the middle of a breastfeeding session. Oops!\n\nBaby Haven\n\nCelebrity parents: Jessica Alba and Cash Warren\n\nBorn: August 2011\n\nWe can't help but admit that we're relieved to hear that even Jessica Alba gets overwhelmed with motherhood and the arrival of Haven this fall certainly added even more plates -- or bottles! -- to juggle for this busy working celebrity mom.\n\nBaby Milo\n\nCelebrity parents: Alyssa Milano and David Bugliari\n\nBorn: August 2011\n\nFirst-time mom Alyssa Milano is already making her mark in the world of parenting and her son, Milo, is just a few months old! Recently, Alyssa shared that not only is she proud to be breastfeeding, but that she supports breastfeeding in public.\n\nBaby Moroccan and Baby Monroe\n\nCelebrity parents: Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon\n\nBorn: April 2011\n\nIt's not surprising that these twins were destined for stardom! Born in the early part of 2011, Moroccan and Monroe have already made their music video debut -- and we have to say that mama Mariah Carey is looking pretty good!\n\nBaby Penelope\n\nCelebrity Parents: Tina Fey and Jeff Richmond\n\nBorn: August 2011\n\nFunny celebrity mommy, funny celebrity baby? Only time will tell for Tina Fey's second daughter, Penelope, who joins big sister Alice.\n\nBaby Sadie\n\nCelebrity parents: Christina Applegate and Martin LeNoble\n\nBorn: January 2011\n\nIt's nothing short of a miracle that Christina Applegate had her daughter, Sadie, in early 2011 -- Applegate fought and won a battle against breast cancer in 2008, even having a double mastectomy to reduce her risk of relapse.\n\nBaby Skyler\n\nCelebrity parents: Rachel Zoe and Rodger Berman\n\nBorn: March 2011\n\nIf there's one 2011 baby who will be setting the fashion trends of the future, it's sure to be Skyler, son to celebrity stylist Rachel Zoe, who is a celebrity in his own right as well.

Who made us cringe on our couches? Plenty of fashionable stars – what were they thinking?\n\nKelly Osbourne\n\nE! Fashion Police critic Kelly Osbourne needs an intervention of her own. The reality star and host went futuristic with this bold Zac Posen dress, complete with pointed shoulders and gray hair.\n\nOne thing we gotta know: Why the gray hair?\n\n\"I can't keep bleaching my hair and I want to grow it so I take breaks in between. I did it a year ago but it was more of a lavender gray, but I went straight gray this time,\" she told US Weekly at the People's Choice Awards.\n\nMom Sharon Osbourne is none-too-pleased with the look. \"Don't blame me for that hair color!\" she barked.\n\nTop 10 best dressed at the 201 Golden Globe Awards >>\n\nJenna Dewan\n\nWe can't really blame Jenna Dewan for looking a bit off on the red carpet — after all, she is married to super hottie Channing Tatum. The Step Up actress wore a Maria Lucia Hohan on the red carpet. Some loved it — we hated it.\n\nNatalie Portman\n\nNatalie Portman looks amazing after having son Aleph a few months ago. However, we cannot figure out why she opted for a pink Lanvin gown, complete with a full bustle. You're gorgeous, Natalie, pick something that's worthy of your body.\n\nHeidi Klum\n\nWas this the Golden Globes or Memorial Day weekend in the Hamptons? Supermodel Heidi Klum seemed to confuse the two with her plain Calvin Klein dress, complete with turquoise jewelry.\n\nRooney Mara\n\nThe Girl With the Dragon Tattoo star Rooney Mara has really embraced Lisbeth Salander's dark aesthetic with her recent fashion choices. However, something was off with her black Nina Ricci dress at the Golden Globes. We can't quite put our finger on it, but it's not worthy of Rooney.\n\nZooey Deschanel\n\nZooey Deschanel might be the indie gal's patron saint, but even the most hipstery of hipsters wouldn't appreciate this custom made Prada gown. The front of the dress looked like a bunch of computer pixels — very Matrix-like.\n\nSarah Michelle Gellar\n\nWe were so ready to blast Sarah Michelle Gellar for the tie-dyed monstrosity that she wore to the Golden Globes, until we heard her daughter picked it out.\n\n\"It's funny — I didn't try on that many dresses. They had them all lined up and I was working all week and my 2-year-old walked in, walked up to this dress and said, 'Mama, wear this!'\" Gellar told Us Weekly of her Monique Lhuillier gown. \"So I put it on and said, 'OK!\"\n\n\"She really went for it,\" Gellar added. \"She chose the bag and shoes. I let her pick all of it.\"\n\nWe totally get it — what toddler wouldn't like this dress? It looks like she colored on it. We know you love your daughter, Sarah Michelle, but maybe ask a stylist for her dress opinions next time.\n\nPiper Perabo\n\nCovert Affairs star Piper Perabo wanted attention at the 2012 Golden Globe Awards. That's the only reason we can come up with for why she picked this sheer gray gown from Theyskens' Theory collection.\n\nAmanda Peet\n\nWe can tell Amanda Peet doesn't even like the dress she picked out for the Globes. She looks absolutely miserable in her tiered Marc Jacobs dress that looks better suited for a summer day picking flowers than a night at the awards.\n\nJessica Biel\n\nJessica Biel has an incredible body, but she opted to cover it up with this horrific lace bridal gown-looking thing at the Globes. Is she getting ready for her wedding to fiancé Justin Timberlake already?\n\nImages courtesy WENN.com\n\nWhich star wore the worst dress at the 2012 Golden Globe Awards?\n\nMore Golden Globes style\n\nGet the look: Tina Fey's 2012 Golden Globes hair/makeup\n\nThe best hair looks at the Golden Globes\n\nCeleb moms 2012 Golden Globes style\n\n↧\n\nHair superstar Philip B shares his Oscars hair predictions\n\nThe Artist, The Help, The Descendants… oh my!

He also hints at who he is most excited to see this year and how to get the looks of some of our favorite stars.\n\nSheKnows: What do you predict will be the biggest hair trends of the night?\n\nPhilip B: Sculpted bombshell waves in platinum blonde or tousled, not-too-polished waves . Both styles look amazing in combination with detailed couture dresses.\n\nSheKnows: What stars are you most excited to see on the carpet?\n\nPhilip B: Cate Blanchett. She is a great role model for the easy, natural hair look, which contrasts so beautifully with her polished, avant-garde style.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow. Her long, sleek hair is always perfect with her Calvin Klein gowns. Natalie Portman. Can't wait to see her post-pregnancy look. Jennifer Hudson. So beautiful and talented, and her new figure looks amazing.\n\nI'm also excited to see young, up-and-coming stars like Hailee Steinfeld and Dakota and Elle Fanning. The two sisters are big Rodarte fans and, like me, love super-shiny, healthy, natural-looking hair!\n\nSheKnows: What was your favorite hair look at the Oscars last year?\n\nPhilip B: I love the look of sexy, flawless waves. At last year's ceremony, Kate Beckinsale and Mila Kunis both wore them in loose, modern updos that telegraphed sophistication and drama in a youthful way.\n\nSheKnows: How can you easily get this look?\n\nPhilip B: This look is surprisingly easy to achieve with the right styling products.\n\nMist Philip B. Maui Wowie Thickening Spray on dry, unwashed hair. Then use a large-barrel curling iron to curl your hair in sections.\n\nFlip your head upside down, rake through the curls with your fingertips, and set them with Philip B. Jet Set Hair Spray.\n\nLift your hair into a loose, high ponytail, pulling it halfway through an elastic band to create a loop.\n\nPull out a few pieces around your face to create a soft effortless look, and wrap one piece around the hair elastic and pin it in place.\n\nFinish with another light misting of hairspray and you're ready for the red carpet!\n\nSheKnows: Since they were your favorites, what do you want to see Kate and Mila rock this year?\n\nPhilip B: They both have gorgeous hair. Kate is kind of aristocratic, so she looks wonderful in updated versions of classic Hollywood hairdos, like a tousled high bun or chignon or bouncy ponytail. Mila's hair looks great when she wears it pin-straight and center-parted, and she has a beautiful face for that kind of '70s look. But I really love the look of sexy, flawless waves, so I'd be happy to see that look again, too!\n\nDon't forget to watch the Oscars on Sunday, Feb. 26 at 7 p.m. EST, and check back right after for our list of the best and worst hair looks of the night.\n\nMore celebrity hairstyles\n\nJoey Maalouf's tips to keeping Rachel Zoe Fashion Week fresh\n\nGrammys 2012: The night in hair\n\nCeleb Hairstyle of the Week: Rachel McAdams' new bangs\n\nPhoto credits: Adriana M.

And what about the sound problems that plagued the entire telecast? At least we had fashion to drool over — and there were plenty of drool-worthy fashion creations on the red carpet. Check out who takes our gold statue for best dressed.\n\nEmma Stone\n\nEmma Stone was totally adorable during the Oscars telecast. We loved her red Giambattista Valli couture gown with a tie neck, even if it was pretty much the same dress Nicole Kidman wore to the 2008 Oscars. The red-headed star of The Help did her best to make the gown shine with a silver clutch, Louis Vuitton jewelry and Brian Atwood heels.\n\nMichelle Williams\n\nMy Week With Marilyn star Michelle Williams might have lost out on the Best Actress prize, but she won our hearts in her coral Louis Vuitton dress with a pink Bottega Veneta clutch and choker. Oh, and how perfect was her skin? She was positively glowing.\n\n2012 Oscars winners: The complete list >>\n\nNatalie Portman\n\nLast year's Best Actress winner Natalie Portman had a mom's night out at the 2012 Oscars with her polka-dotted Dior haute couture gown and bling by Harry Winston.\n\nAngelina Jolie\n\nOh, Angelina. You looked incredibly gorgeous in your velvet Atelier Versace gown with the slit up to your nether regions. We didn't quite understand the constant vamping — you already have Brad Pitt. You still looked gorgeous, though.\n\nThe 8 worst dressed ladies at the 2012 Oscars >>\n\nOctavia Spencer\n\nThe Help star Octavia Spencer won our hearts — again — in her Tadashi Shoji boatneck gown, Judith Leiber clutch and 50-carat diamond earrings from Neil Lane. We were sort of disappointed she didn't show off that saggy cleavage, though.\n\nJessica Chastain\n\nBest Supporting Actress nominee Jessica Chastain set off her hand-embroidered Alexander McQueen gown with $2 million dollars of yellow Harry Winston diamonds and Brian Atwood heels. Her best style accessory — by far — is her flawless skin. Can you slip us your facialist's number? We won't tell.\n\nStacy Keibler\n\nStacy Keibler wanted to make sure her BF George Clooney knew she was his big prize in her liquid gold lame Marchesa gown with Lorraine Schwartz jewelry and Judith Leiber clutch.\n\nPenelope Cruz\n\nFormer Oscar winner Penelope Cruz made our jaws drops with her lavender Giorgio Armani gown and 114 carats of Chopard diamonds.

Read on to learn about the fabulous, wearable trends of the night and how you can translate these looks into your everyday fashionable-mom life:\n\nRed carpet trends\n\nThe fashion trend for 2012 is clearly a return to simple glamour. This year, sleek, fitted and sophisticated gowns in sparkly whites, alluring blacks, bold reds and antique gold tones dominated the red carpet trends. Celebrity moms also wowed us with their clean, luminous makeup and no-nonsense hair. We saw oversized buns and sleek ponytails . Makeup trends ranged from luminous and glowing to bold, smoky eyes paired with full, red lips.\n\nJennifer Lopez wore a glimmering white Zuhair Murad dress with an oversized high bun and glowing skin that made her look like a Greek goddess.\n\nKelly Ripa was a vision in a pale pistachio green gown from Carolina Herrera. Like Lopez, she wore her hair in a large bun pulled straight back from her face, showing off radiant skin and stand-out eyes.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow continued the white trend in an ivory Tom Ford cape dress and a dazzling cuff bracelet. Her hair was pulled off her face in a clean low ponytail and rosy, yet natural makeup.\n\nMom of six Angelina Jolie continues to enchant us with her vixen beauty. She chose a black velvet Atelier Versace dress with a slit that seemed to go forever. Her hair was worn bombshell full and her makeup bold and alluring.\n\nSandra Bullock combined the night's fashion trends with a white and black dress with a jeweled gold trim around the waist. Like Gwyneth Paltrow, she showed off her beautiful face with her hair pulled back into a sleek ponytail .\n\nNew mom and last year's Best Actress winner Natalie Portman looked retro sweet in a strapless red and black polka dot vintage dress by Haute Couture Christian Dior circa 1954. Her makeup was bold but not intense with subtle smoky eyes and red-stained lips.\n\nMichelle Williams chose a \"burnt orange\" strapless Louis Vuitton dress with a peplum waist .\n\nHere are some fashion tips for moms to add some red carpet glam into their everyday styles: For Jennifer and Kelly's radiant look, try pairing a fitted, white or ivory knit top with white pants or light blue jeans. Recreate their hair by shampooing and conditioning with a smoothing shampoo. Use a dollop of glossing cream and blow dry straight.\n\nNext, pull your hair up and off of your face and wrap into a high bun and secure with pins. Finally, use a BB Cream followed with a creamy blush. Apply a nude or peach lip gloss to your lips and apply a few faux eyelash pieces to the outer corners of your eyes. Finish with two coats of a volumizing mascara.\n\nFor a look that can go from work to PTA, try a red peplum jacket paired with black pants and patent leather pumps.\n\nMore celeb mom style\n\nCeleb moms Golden Globes 2012 style\n\nYour fave celeb moms -- Snag their style\n\nCelebrity style secrets for moms\n\nGeorge Clooney Interview 84th Annual Academy Awards Red\n\nGeorge Clooney talks about past auditions and who he thinks will win at the 84th Annual Academy Awards only on SheKnows.com\n\nPhoto credits: Apega/WENN.com, Apega/WENN.com, Russ Einhorn / Splash News, Adriana M.

At age 5, Scott Thomas lost her father, a Royal Navy Pilot, to a plane crash. Just six years later at age 11, her stepfather met the same demise. While her mother discouraged her acting dreams and enrolled Scott Thomas at the Cheltenham Ladies College in England, it was only a matter of time before she dropped out at age 16 and began taking a serious interest in drama.\n\nVital stats\n\nBirthday: May 24, 1960\n\nAstrological Sign: Gemini\n\nHometown: Cornwall, England, UK\n\nHeight: 5 feet, 6 inches\n\nFamily: Five siblings and three children -- Hannah, Joseph and George\n\nFirst Job: au pair\n\nAt the age of 18, Scott Thomas left England for a two-week trip to Paris to visit friends, but ended up staying there permanently after receiving a job as an au pair. It was also in Paris where Scott Thomas met her future husband, Dr. François Olivennes, who she was married to for 17 years and has three children with.\n\nWith the support of her friends in Paris, Scott Thomas decided to try her hand at acting and enrolled in L'Ecole Nationale des Arts et Techniques de Theatres where she performed in several small on-stage roles and eventually even on television. Over time, Scott Thomas obtained recognition in France as an actress and landed her first leading role in 1988 in the English film, A Handful of Dust.\n\nIn 1990 Scott Thomas' film career began to take off outside of Europe after appearing in films such as Bitter Moon and Four Weddings and a Funeral, alongside Hugh Grant. She also worked with Harrison Ford in the 1999 film Random Hearts, and has since appeared in many notable films such as The Other Boleyn Girl with Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson, The Golden Compass, Mission: Impossible and many other European and American films.\n\nAside from her achievements as an actress, Scott Thomas has been recognized as one of Empire Magazine's 100 Sexiest Stars in film history and also by People Magazine as one of the 50 Most Beautiful People in the World. In 2008 she won a Laurence Olivier Theatre Award for Best Actress for her performance in The Seagull. Perhaps most notable, Scott Thomas was awarded Legion d'Honneur, France's highest civilian award in 2005. The Legion d'Honneur is awarded to those dedicating at least 20 years of service in the military or civilian life to scholarship, arts, sciences, politics and other fields that enhance France's reputation.\n\nKristin Scott Thomas is currently living in Paris with her two youngest sons after the release of her latest films, Woman in the Fifth and Bel Ami, while working on several films to be released in the coming year, including In the House, Cherchez Hortense, Only God Forgives, Seconds of Pleasure and The Invisible Women.\n\nWoman in the Fifth: See the trailer\n\nIn Kristin Scott Thomas' most recent film, The Woman in the Fifth, Scott Thomas plays a mysterious widow named Margit who walks into the life of an American college lecturer, played by Ethan Hawke, who has come to Paris in an attempt to put his life back together. The two strangers form a passionate relationship which triggers inexplicable events that no one expected. Adding to the suspense is the beautiful Margit's possible connection to a string of murders.\n\nMore Star Spotlights\n\nStar Spotlight: Sarah Jessica Parker\n\nStar Spotlight: Hugh Grant\n\nStar Spotlight: Saoirse Ronan\n\n↧\n\nSir Paul McCartney directs Natalie Portman and Johnny Depp\n\nSir Paul McCartney spreads the love, thanks to Hollywood's top names, a live guitar solo and sign language. Watch the brand new and beautiful videos now!\n\nWhat can be said with sign language in a love song? Only a Beatles legend can create three distinct interpretations of the same track, along with the help of two A-list actors and an award-winning cinematographer. Last Friday evening, Sir Paul McCartney premiered his brand new, self-directed videos for \"My Valentine\" -- one of two original tracks on his new studio album Kisses on the Bottom.\n\nAn exclusive event was held at the Stella McCartney store in Los Angeles, where McCartney's three visual interpretations of \"My Valentine\" were screened for the first time. Two films feature Natalie Portman and Johnny Depp, respectively, translating the lyrics of the song into sign language. A third version combines both Natalie and Johnny's performances into one film.\n\nThe star power isn't solely in front of the camera, as the 35mm video was shot by Academy Award-winning cinematographer Wally Pfister .\n\nThe original idea for the music video was inspired by Stella McCartney herself -- the same source as Portman's wardrobe in the video.

Try a new hairstyle! Our tips below will take 10 years off your look.\n\nYou know the feeling — standing in front of your bathroom mirror, wondering the simplest way to take years off your look. Maybe you've tried that new face cream or a hot new surgical treatment, but did you know a simple haircut could literally take a few years off your face in just one hour?! Whether you're looking for a new short 'do or sexy waves, we drop into the Cristophe Beverly Hills Salon to catch stylist Glenn Deneve's simple hair tips.\n\nPixie cuts\n\n\"Pixie cuts are fun, easy and sexy any time of the year, but especially in the summer,\" says Deneve. \"Try Ginnifer Goodwin’s style — it’s a bold statement.\"\n\nCut your hair short, and keep soft layers around the ears, leaving it slightly longer at the crown, so you look ultra-feminine. Tip: This is best for fine or slightly wavy hair; thick or curly hair gets too bulky when too short.\n\nTo balance out a long face, keep volume on the side.\n\nTo lengthen a square or round face, the layers should be longer across the forehead.\n\nCeleb inspiration: Michelle Williams, Natalie Portman and Halle Berry.\n\nSoft, beach waves\n\nShampoo and condition your hair.\n\nPut soft mousse from the mid-length to the ends of your hair, and dry. Tip: You could also use salt water instead in a spray bottle to give it more hold.\n\nSection hair in two, and break apart into 2-inch sections. Then, take a curling iron vertically from the head, and make sure the ends of the hair face down. Leave the last two inches of the hair out, and hold for about 15 to 20 seconds.\n\nAfter doing the whole head, flip your head upside down, and while you spray beach spray into the hair, shake out your curls, flip your head back up and go through it with your fingers until it looks natural.\n\nCeleb inspiration: Gisele Bündchen, Julia Roberts and Sarah Jessica Parker.\n\nWatch: Makeup tips to look younger\n\nUsed to wearing neutrals but want to be a bit more adventurous?

It was so casual, a source says Natalie may not have even worn a wedding dress!\n\nWhile widely reported on Monday morning, People didn't break the news that actress Natalie Portman tied the knot with her longtime beau until Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe magazine is reporting that Portman married Benjamin Millepied Saturday night in a private home located along California's scenic Big Sur coast.\n\nLittle else is known about the ceremony, other than the couple was joined by family and friends who included Ivanka Trump.\n\nThe Oscar-winning actress met the French dancer/choreographer on, fittingly, the set of 2009's Black Swan.\n\nThe 30-somethings dated throughout the shoot, and announced they were engaged and expecting in December 2010.\n\nSon Aleph is now 14 months old.\n\n\"Nothing is more important than my personal life,\" Portman recently told France's Madame Figaro, by way of People. \"It's something which comes first, always makes sense, and compared to the happiness of a successful family life, everything else is practically superficial.\"\n\nIn this day and age of relentlessly in-your-face paps 24-7, Natalie truly just pulled off \"mission impossible\" by keeping this under wraps.\n\nImage courtesy of C.

It was so casual, a source says Natalie may not have even worn a wedding dress!\n\nAfter the National Enquirer reported Macaulay Culkin was on the road to an early grave, courtesy of a hard-core heroin addiction, the actor was spotted at good friend Natalie Portman's wedding on Saturday.\n\nGuess who wasn't there? Culkin's ex Mila Kunis.\n\nUs Weekly is reporting Culkin and Portman have been \"friends for years,\" so it should come as no surprise that he was among the 100 guests at the hush-hush affair, held at a private home on California's beautiful Big Sur.\n\nWhile this may lead some to speculate that, as Culkin contends, he can't possibly be at the bottom of a heroin addiction, tongues are still wagging -- fueled by the fact that Portman's good friend, Kunis, wasn't in attendance.\n\nCelebrity Dirty Laundry is airing the following dirty laundry: Kunis may have ditched the intimate affair because she was so disgusted by her ex's addiction.\n\nThe site also referenced numerous reports that Mac's alleged addiction has worsened since Kunis started dating Ashton Kutcher.\n\nIf all of this is true, that would no doubt have been an awkward run-in for all parties involved during what is supposed to be a joyful event.\n\nImage courtesy of WENN.com/Nat Bocking\n\n↧\n\nNatalie Portman goes topless for Dior\n\nNatalie Portman continues her partnership with Christian Dior with a sexy new ad campaign for Diorskin lip color.\n\nNatalie Portman steams up fashion as she goes topless for Dior. The beautiful photos for the Diorskin Nude ad campaign are tasteful and sultry. One photo shows Portman leaning over an expertly-placed sofa arm while another photo just shows Portman staring into the camera with a sexy side pose.\n\nNatalie Portman keeps weekend wedding hush-hush >>\n\nIn the photos Portman wears her favorite Dior lipstick, 169 Grege, which is part of Dior's Diorskin Nude lip color line. \"I chose the color Grege because it's the one I'd pick to wear myself,\" says Portman. The number [169] contains different dates that are important to me and my family.\"\n\nNatalie Portman shows off baby Aleph >>\n\nAlways charitable, proceeds from 169 Grege will benefit the Free the Children Association, a non-profit organization that aims to increase educational opportunities for children in developing nations. In April 2012, Natalie Portman was named an ambassador for Free the Children. \"As a mother and the organization's newest ambassador, I am grateful to Free the Children for giving me the opportunity to channel my passion and love of children into meaningful action that furthers the education and leadership of young women for years to come,\" said Portman.\n\nNatalie Portman is also the face of Christian Dior's Miss Dior fragrance. Portman went topless for Dior back in January 2011 for a Miss Dior campaign. That campaign was far sweeter than the sultry campaign for Diorskin, but nonetheless sexy. People magazine reports this is Natalie Portman's first Dior ad since John Galliano was removed as head designer for the fashion label.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Adriana M. Barraza / WENN.com\n\n↧"
