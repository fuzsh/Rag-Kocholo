        "text": "Directed by: Mark Robson\n\nStarring: Charlton Heston, George Kennedy, Ava Gardner, Richard Roundtree, Genevieve Bujold, Lorne Greene, Victoria Principal.\n\nEarthquake may not be as well known today as, say, The Poseidon Adventure or The Towering Inferno, but it should be. As an all-out disaster extravaganza, it is second to none.\n\nEarthquake is set in Los Angeles and stars the one and only Charlton Heston as a building contractor, working for his father-in-law (Lorne Greene). Charlton is married to Ava Gardner, and unhappily so, as they do nothing but quarrel in every scene they have together. Charlton starts an affair with pretty widow/single mother Genevieve Bujold, who looks like she could be Charlton’s granddaughter.\n\nOther major characters include George Kennedy (of the Airport series) as a recently suspended cop, Richard Roundtree as a motorcycle daredevil, and Victoria Principal as the sister of Roundtree’s mechanic.\n\nThings kick off with a couple of minor quakes, causing trouble up at the Hollywood Dam, which overlooks the city, and bringing the bodycount to three after only 19 minutes. Good start! A young assistant at the seismology institute predicts a major quake within the next 48 hours, but no one really believes him. As he tries to convince his superiors that the public should be warned, the rest of the characters go about their daily lives. This includes George Kennedy doing some daytime drinking, Richard Roundtree crashing his bike in a harebrained stunt attempt, and Charlton Heston getting it on with Genevieve Bujold.\n\nAbout an hour in, the big one hits. This must be the longest earthquake in history, as we’re treated to about ten minutes of uninterrupted mayhem. Buildings collapse, people plummet to horrible death, concrete and shattered glass rains over unfortunate pedestrians and cars plummet off highway bridges. It’s a joy to behold.\n\nSpecial effects during this and the other quake scenes range from the quite impressive, with what I suppose is large scale sets being lovingly destroyed and/or very nice matte paintings for some shots, to “shake-the-camera-really-hard” type shots and some amazingly crappy, animated bloodstains. Mostly, though, the carnage looks really good.\n\nAll of the main characters survive the main quake, and both Charlton and George take charge and help rescuing survivors from the ruins or tending to the wounded. Charltons father-in-law suffers a fatal heart-attack, though, after heroically saving all his office workers. Then the violent aftershock hits, finally busting the Hollywood Dam and sending a flood towards the city. Genevieve Bujold and Ava Gardner get trapped along with some others in a basement, and Charlton and George come to the rescue. Suffice it to say that not everyone makes it out alive.\n\nDespite some pacing problems during the first half, before the main quake actually hits, Earthquake is one of the most entertaining disaster movies I’ve seen. There’s plenty of overacting and so-so plotting, but I don’t really expect anything else from a disaster flick. The movie is well made, looks good (apart from some less than elegant editing in some sequences), and delivers tons of really violent destruction.\n\nPutting some slightly bisarre icing on the cake is Walter Matthau, doing a cameo as a drunk in what may well be the ugliest shirt in cinema history (and weird hat to match). Then there’s the supermarket clerk (Marjoe Gortner) who also belongs to the national guard and who turns into a full-blown psycho, killing three neighbourhood bullies before trying to rape Victoria Principal (who sports big afro). And the car chase that gets George Kennedy suspended is great, with George yanking the wheel this way and that while driving down perfectly straight stretches of road…\n\nDirected by: John Guillermin & Irwin Allen\n\nStarring: Paul Newman, Steve McQueen, William Holden, Faye Dunaway, Richard Chamberlain, Susan Blakely, Fred Astaire, O.J. Simpson\n\nSo here it is, the film that is arguably the major classic of the disaster movie genre. Certainly, The Towering Inferno is the finest example of the 70′s style of disaster cinema: big all-star cast, multiple storylines, a spectacular central event, and an all-around massive production (Inferno was at the time the biggest film produced on the 20th Century Fox lot by virtue of its 57 sets and four camera crews.)\n\nProducer Irwin Allen (who also made The Poseidon Adventure and would keep making disaster epics with less well-regarded films like The Swarm and Beyond the Poseidon Adventure) shared directorial duties with John Guillermin (who, sadly, went on to direct the execrable 1976 version of King Kong). Sterling Silliphant (Academy Award winner for his screenplay to In the Heat of the Night) wrote the script as an adaptation of not one but two novels: The Tower by Richard Martin Stern, and The Glass Inferno by Thomas N Scortia and Frank M Robinson. The film was eventually nominated for eight Academy Awards, winning three.\n\nThe movie opens as architect Doug Roberts (Paul Newman) returns from his vacation just in time for the dedication party for his brand new creation, the Glass Tower in San Franscisco – the world’s highest building with its 138 floors. He barely has time to check in at his office to make love with girlfriend Susan (Faye Dunaway) before bad things start happening: a short circuit in the engineering room brings to light faulty electrical wiring. This, it turns out, is caused by the electrical engineer – Roger Simmons, portrayed by Richard Chamberlain – changing Doug’s original specifications in order to cut costs and meet budget constraints. Roger is married to Patty Duncan (Susan Blakely), daughter of Jim Duncan (William Holden), owner of Duncan Enterprises and the man who financed the building, and thus both Roger and his father-in-law are to be held responsible for the disaster.\n\nAs the dedication party gets started in the 135th floor restaurant, the crappy wiring causes a fire to break out in a janitor’s closet on the 81st floor. This is discovered by the building’s security chief, played by one Mr. O.J. Simpson. Along with architect Doug he sets about getting people out and fighting the fire. Despite their efforts, the fire is already spreading quickly as the firefighters arrive at the scene. They are led by the no-nonsense fire chief Michael O’Halloran (Steve McQueen). O’Halloran finally convinces the reluctant Jim Duncan to start evacuating people from the party…but by then it’s already too late.\n\nFor the next two hours we’re treated to non-stop heroics from Newman, McQueen and the firefighters: apart from the dignitaries and celebrities at the party there are deaf women, small children and cute cats to rescue. Many people don’t make it: there is for instance the tragic case of a Duncan employee (Robert Wagner) and his secretary/lover who get trapped in his office. Both catch on fire and perish horribly, with Wagner falling off an indoor balcony while the girl crashes through the windows and plummets some 80 floors to her death. Among the spectacular deaths, it is particularly satisfying when we later see the despicable Roger Simmons gets his just deserts.\n\nOptions run out as the fire closes in on the partygoers (those who have survived this far), and fire chief O’Halloran goes on what might well be a suicide mission: he will be dropped on the flaming roof by helicopter in order to blow up the huge water tanks on top of the building, hoping the resulting flood will drown the fires (but hopefully not all the trapped people). This climactic sequence is a worthy conclusion to the movie.\n\nAs I re-watched the movie for blogging purposes, I was struck by how powerful it still is. I know I gave the cheese-fest Earthquake a 5/5 rating, but this is a different kind of good. This is, like, good for real. Inferno doesn’t suffer from the pacing problems that makes the first half of Earthquake seem a bit long, the characters are more believable, the plotting is way more efficient and the acting is on another level. The Towering Inferno even delivers some surprisingly earnest character moments. Combine all that with good effects work and some suspenseful set pieces, like Newman saving a woman and two children in a demolished stairwell or McQueen landing on an external elevator stuck some 100 floors up, and you have one fine film indeed.\n\nNewman is good, Chamberlain is vile, Faye Dunaway is pretty and Fred Astaire (!) as an aging con-man who has lost the appetite for his trade is kind of touching. But the main man of the piece is the tireless and self-sacrificing fire-chief, played with quiet authority by Steve McQueen.\n\nMcQueen also delivers the film’s best line, as O’Halloran and some of his firefighters are forced to rope down an elevator shaft. One of the men balks at the prospect, saying he can’t do it, “I know I’ll fall”. McQueen looks at him seriously:\n\n“Then you better go first. That way when you fall, you won’t take any of us with you.”"
