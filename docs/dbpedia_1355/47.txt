Hello fellow Wikipedians,

I have just modified one external link on Shringar Nagaraj. Please take a moment to review my edit. If you have any questions, or need the bot to ignore the links, or the page altogether, please visit this simple FaQ for additional information. I made the following changes:

Added archive https://archive.is/20130121095357/http://archive.deccanherald.com/content/Nov102008/metromon2008110999792.asp to http://archive.deccanherald.com/content/Nov102008/metromon2008110999792.asp

When you have finished reviewing my changes, you may follow the instructions on the template below to fix any issues with the URLs.
