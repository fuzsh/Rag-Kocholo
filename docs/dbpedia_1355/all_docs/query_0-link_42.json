From the time of its origin it emerged and flourished and has been part of the continuing traditional wave of painting in India since ancient times. Parameters regarding early and later developments of painting from time to time could be detected in it. It is a different matter that it unhesitatingly assimilated the impact of other Indian as well as foreign styles in this period.\n\nConstitution of Rajasthani School\n\nRajasthani painting developed in various styles of the Mewar, Marwar, Hadoti and Dhundar schools, and their substyles from the 16th century to the 19th is definitely a major branch of Indian painting. Greatly influenced by other schools and styles, the identity of Rajasthani painting could easily be ascertained. It possesses the following main characteristics.\n\n1.Depiction of Folklife: Rajasthani painting developed in a tradition of frescoes strictly confined to folklife. In early paintings simplicity and ease and abundance of sentiment relating to folklife in selecting colour schemes and themes have been noted. Art flourished in the cultural milieu of the royal court, and this painting was dissociated from the folk element. Developed at religious and cultural centres, this style of painting was closely associated with public life and popular themes.\n\n2.Abundance of Pravants: Rajasthani painting is full of romance. A sentimental approach had been extensively adopted in this style. The sweet Radha-Krishna theme has been used extensively and is deeply rooted in it. A rare combination of Bhakti and shringar has been depicted in a lively manner in Rajasthani painting.\n\n3. Variety of Themes: The subject matter of Rajasthani painting is vast. It flourished on the background of many themes like the various lilas of Radha-Krishna, stories relating to the Mahabharat and Bhagwad, nayak-nayika-bheda, rag-ragini, barah-masa, description of seasons, court life, festivals, hunting, draw-ings of raja-rani, folklore. Illustration of poetry is a unique characteristic of this style.\n\n4.Colour-Scheme: Arrangement of colour in Rajasthani painting is specially significant. Red, yellow, white and green are the principal colours of this style. With combinations of these colours artistsmade paintings in technicolour. Application of sharp bright shining colours possess their own form and style.\n\n5.Raiput Culture: Lively depiction of Rajput culture and civilisation and the circumstances of that age is often visible in Rajasthani painting. Their skill as builders of forts and temples, have/is, royal courts has been minutely shown in Rajasthani painting. Traditional and devotional ages have also been extensively painted in a lively style.\n\n6.Nature's Perspective: The vast perspective of nature has been painted in many colours. There are ponds full of lotus flowers. Rays of serpentine lightning in a sky covered with dense black clouds, forests, gardens, trees, shrubs, flowering plants, leaves, fields full of birds, deer, peacock, lion, elephant, these are special features of Rajasthani painting.\n\nComparison with Equivalent Schools of North India\n\nFor the sake of comparison, two schools of northern painting could be placed on a level with Rajasthani painting. These are the Mughal and Pahari schools. One conclusion to be drawn from a comparative study is that the Rajasthani style, though influenced by these styles, still maintained its originality.\n\nRajasthani and Mughal Schools\n\nOrigin and development of these schools took place simultaneously. Because of political and other influences mutual artistic exchange is quite natural, but both these styles retain their original characters. The Mughal style is based on the Iranian school and the Rajasthani on an indigenous style.\n\nRegarding subject matter, the Mughal style was dominated by the pomp and show of the royal court and of feudal lords, the Rajasthani on the other hand by the simplicity of folklife. The Mughal style had a realistic approach while the Rajasthani style adopted a highly imaginative posture.\n\nThe Mughal style emerged from miniatures while the Rajasthani style grew from frescoes. While one was dominated by the grandeur of the royal court, the other was filled with religious sentiment, devotion and shringar. In one drawing of the court, wars and royal festivals was extensively depicted, in the other there was lively depicting of a simple rural lifestyle, romantic poetical imagination, religious sentiment and enactments of various moods of Radha-Krishna. One contained a graphic account of Persian poetry and Mughal history, while the other depicted nature in depth on the basis of texts from Hindi-Sanskrit poetry.\n\nIn Rajasthani painting colour schemes and style of decoration are entirely different from those of the Mughal style. While the colour scheme of one was austere, the other acquired a lively character. Rajasthani painting assimilated the Puranic tradition of ideal Hindu life, deeds of Rajput chivalry and culture while the other style was predominantly Mughal in character. One used Indian symbols like the lotus, swan and peacock while the other was dominated by trees of saru, falcons and camels.\n\nA comparative examination of these styles reveals the diversity of sentiment in them. From the middle of the 16th century, because of the political and social impact of the Mughals, the seeds of Mughal culture spread in Rajasthan. By the beginning of the 17th century the whole of Rajasthan came under the influence of the Mughals. They established their cultural suzerainty over the whole of Rajasthan, and at the same time were tremendously influenced by the Rajputs themselves. Matrimonial alliances between Mughals and Rajputs resulted in mutual exchanges in the arts, and this is clearly visible in these styles.\n\nRajasthani and Pahari Schools\n\nThe style of painting which flourished in Basohli, Jammu, Garhwal, Chamba, Kangra, Guler and Mandi in the hilly areas in the northwest has been termed the Pahari school. Developed in the 18th century, this style is an eternal legacy of the Rajasthani style. With the eclipse of Mughal art some artists from the Mughal court were sheltered by Rajput royalty. Under the impact of environment the paintings they produced acquired the name of new Pahari school.\n\nPahari painting, like the earlier Rajasthani style, adopted the same parameters for drawings of sentiment and artistic portrayal. On the basis of expressing different moods of Rad ha-Krishna many paintings were drawn in the Pahari style. Paintings executed on the basis of texts like Bhagwad-Puran, Geet-Govind, Sursagar, Rasikpriya, Bihari-Satsai, nayika-bheda and rag-ragini are the main heritage of the Kangra and Basohli styles. In the Basohli style, like the Mewar style, indicative colours and folk art predominate. In the Pahari school of painting, expression of sentiment, rhythm in line and colour and diversity of subject matter are unique in the Kangra style.\n\nFrom the point of view of development of art, the contribution of Raja Sansar Chand (1775-1783) was invaluable. In respect of steadiness of brush, selecting colours, pleasing figures of males and females, drawing of nature in seven colours, diversity in animals and birds and expression of sentiment, the Kangra style is much renowned. Application of seven colours and beauty prevalent in Bundi and Kishangarh styles is particularly noticeable in the Kangra style. This similarity in the Pahari and Rajasthani schools are two strains of the traditions of Indian painting.\n\nThe Rajasthani school of painting and other earlier and later styles of Indian painting influenced each other to such an extent that it becomes an uphill task to dissociate them.\n\nThe great significance of Rajasthani artists adopting the rich traditions of Indian painting, of which the most artistic is the Ajanta style, cannot be denied. Originating at Medpat (Mewar) and greatly influenced by earlier styles and substyles and adopting later styles, Rajasthani painting greatly enriched Indian art.\n\nOwing to the folk-artistic impact of the Mewar style, total drawing of integrated seven colours in the Bundi and Kishangarh styles, the Mughal influence on the Jaipur and Alwar styles, whatever draft of Rajasthani painting emerges before us, has been commented on by Dr Coomaraswamy like this: \"It is a highly fine form of Indian painting and deserves its unique position among all great styles of the world.\" Different enactments of moods of Rad ha-Krishna form the basis of drawings of this style. Based on Hindi, Sanskrit and Rajasthani poetry, this style of painting turned medieval culture and civilisation and sentimental aspects of Hindi poetry dedicated to Lord Krishna into reality.\n\nRajasthani painting is the lively reflection of the literature of Hindu society. Rajasthani artists applied colours magically. Their unique method of description lends pleasing comfort to the eyes. Their paintings possess an eternal source of romance.\n\nPictorial texts and miniatures created by them could not only be applied in studying the sentimental and artistic aspects of medieval literature, but could also be utilised in viewing the true form of the whole culture of that age. Hence Rajasthani painting occupies a unique and very significant place in the history of Indian culture in the Mughal and post-Mughal periods.\n\nWriter – Jai Singh Neeraj\n\n↧\n\nRajput Painting in the Punjab Hills\n\nUnlike the widely scattered courts of Rajasthan, the numerous minor Rajput kingdoms of the Himalayan foothills were clustered in an area only three hundred miles long by a hundred wide. Although they shared a similar cultural background to the southern Rajputcourts, they were effectively separated from them by the broad expanse of the Punjab plains, and they were also less affected by Mughal incursions. This comparative isolation, together with the closer communications between the Hill courts, contributed to the development of some of the most expressive styles of Indian painting, characterised in their earlier phases by a controlled vehemence of colour and line, and later by a mellifluous idiom that combined Mughal technique with Rajput devotional and romantic sensibility.\n\nThe origins of the first classic style of Pahari (Hill) painting, associated with the court of Basohli, are still not understood, though it may have had antecedents in the widespread pre-Mughal style as well as in local Hill idioms. An early illustration to the Rasamanjari, a poetical text classifying lovers and their behaviour, reveals a fully formed and highly charged style, with a taut line and vibrant palette. The interpretation of literary conceits is as direct as in Rajasthani manuscripts.\n\nA lady who has been secretly unfaithful explains to her confidante that the love-marks on her breast were in fact scratches caused by the household cat as it chased a rat during the night. The cat and the rat appear on the pavilion roofer here is nothing here of the hybrid weakness sometimes found in Rajasthani work affected by Popular Mughal fluence. So confident was the Pahari artists' vision that Mugha portraiture could be reinterpreted with equal intensity. The Mankot raja with a rosary, huqqa and sword is not a psychological study of an individual but a celebration of the proud Rajput type silhouetted against a hot yellow background, orange bolster and white floorsprcad. Painting at the court of Kulu had a particular wildness and zest, Kuutala raga, from an extended ragamala series of the Pahari type, is depicted as a prince feeding pigeons; Akbar himself had been fond of the sport of pigeon-flying, which was known as ishq-bazi or love-play'.\n\nAlthough there is some evidence of strongly Mughal-influenced work in the Hills in the late 17th century, comparable to that of the Bikaner school, this was exceptional during the first phase of Pahari painting. But in the second quarter of the 18th century a fundamental change of direction took place. Artists trained in the Mughal style began to arrive in increasing numbers, particularly after the sack of Delhi in 1739. From being the vehicle of a jaded sensuality, their technique became revitalised in lyrical depictions of Hindu poetical and devotional subjects, in a development paralleled in Rajasthan by the less subtle Kishangarh style.\n\nMembers of the family of the artist Pandit Seu, who were based at Guler but travelled widely among the Hill courts, were influential in shaping and disseminating the new style. One of Seu's sons was the great portrait artist Nainsukh, who had probably received some Mughal training. He enjoyed an unusually intimate and understanding relationship with his patronkthe minor prince Balwant Singh, whom he portrayed carrying out all the daily activities of a nobleman: hunting, listening to music, inspecting a horse, or simply writing a letter or preparing to go to bed. Compared with the stark Mankot picture, Nainsukh's portraiture and spatial setting are far more naturalistic. Nevertheless the bold, geometrical arrangement of the architecture and back-ground areas remains typically Rajput.\n\nA religious subject in the early Guler style combines the new technical refinement with a devotional feeling taking the form of tender domestic observation Shiva is shown sewing a garment, while Parvati strings human heads for his necklace. Their sons, the many-headed Karttikcya and the elephant-headed Ganesha, who plays with Shiva's cobra, sit beside them, and their respective vehicles, the bull, lion, peacock and rat, wait in attendance Wersions of the graceful Guler idiom were developed at several courts, such as Garhwal to the south-east, where a Barahmasa illustration of the winter month of Aghan was painted a pair of lovers, idealised as Radha and Krishna, gaze at one another on a terrace while two cranes fly skywards.\n\nThe last great Pahari patron was Raja Sansar Chand of Kangra (1775-1823), whose long reign saw both the final maturity of Hill painting and the beginning of its decline. Early in his reign several masterly series of the classic texts celebrating the life of Krishna were illustrated for him. The love of Radha and Krishna was depicted with tender directness in idyllic landscape setting. As in earlier periods of Indian painting, the luxuriant burgeoning of nature serves to enhance and express the emotions of the human figures. (Krishna is as usual shown as an elegant, princely figure; perhaps akin to the young Sansar Chand. As at Guler, scenes of zenana life were also charmingly rendered, with increasingly curvilinear rhythms, as in a scene of ladies throwing powder and squirting water at the spring festival of Holi. But, as at Kishangarh, such a sweetly refined style could only remain fresh for a short time.\n\nFrom the beginning of the 19thcentury it became facile and sentimental. At the same time, Sansar Chand's power was lost first to Gurkha invaders and then to the Sikhs, who had won control of the Punjab plains and now began to annexe the Hill kingdoms. However, the British traveller William Moorcroft, who visited Sansar Chand in 1820, reports that, though living in reduced circumstances, he was still 'fond of drawing' and continued to support several artists as well as a zenana of three hundred ladies. His daily life was still passed in an orderly round of prayer, conversation, chess, viewing pictures and performances of music and dance.\n\nThe Sikhs continued to hold the Punjab until their displacement by the British in 1849. They commissioned portraits of their Gurus and themselves in a weakened Pahari manner, to which they brought little inspiration as patrons. However one of the most imposing of all Indian portraits is that of Maharaja Gulab Singh. His large figure which fills the picture area is shown seated holding the familiar props of a sprig of flowers and a sword. He wears a dextrously composed turban and coat with sharply ruffled hem, and his face, no longer in profile, stares obliquely away from the viewer in baleful self-possession.\n\nWriter – Andrew T0psfield\n\n↧\n\nPainting Gallery of Babur Nama\n\nA MARKET SCENE AT KAND-E-BADAM, WEIGHING AND TRANSPORT OF ALMONDS\n\nArtist, Sur Das\n\nBaburdescribes Farghana, its principal towns, villages and rivers in Section I of the Bc7bur Nc7ma. Andijan was its capital, and Khujand one of its ancient towns. He thus describes Kand-e-Badam which was known for its almonds:\n\n\"Kand:e-Badam (village of almonds) is a dependency of Khujand ; though it is not a township (qasbii) it is rather a good approach to one (ciasbcacha). Its almonds are excellent, hence its name; they all go to Hormuz or to Hindustan. It is five or six yighach east of Khu-jand.\"\n\nThis painting is by Sur Das. In the background is Kand-e-Badam. In between the domes of mosques are date-palms, reminding us of an Indian town. On the left a man is plucking almonds and in the centre almonds are being weighed and bagged. In the foreground they are being loaded on camels and transported to their destination. There is action and movement in this painting which vividly depicts trade in almonds, and how they were brought to India from Central Asia.\n\nBABUR MEETING KHANZADA BEGAM, MEHR BANU. BEGAM AND OTHER LADIES\n\nArtist, Mansur\n\nKhanzada Begam was the sister of Ba.bur. When he was forced to evacuate Samarkand in 1500 A.D. he was compelled to marry her to Shaibani Khan, his enemy. Shaibani Khan was defeated by Shah Ismail of Persia, who killed him and made a drinking cup of his skull. Babur thus describes his reunion with his sister:\n\n\"Khanzada Begam was in Mery when Shah Ismail (Safavi) defeated the Auzbegs near that town (916 A.H. =1510 A.D.); for my sake he treated her well, giving her sufficient escort to Qunduz where she rejoined me. We had been apart for some ten years; when Muhammadi Kukultash and I went to see her, neither she nor those about her knew us, although I spoke. They recognized us after a time.\"\n\nThis painting is by Mansur, who distinguished himself in painting birds and animals. Here he depicts the reunion of brother and sister at Qunduz in Afghanistan. Seated close to Babur is his companion Kukultash. Seated in front of Babur is Khanzada Begam attended by maid-servants. Outside the kanat are soldiers armed with spears, bows and arrows guarding the tent. There is no display of emotions as the sister did not recognize her brother.\n\nBABUR IN CHAR-BAGH AT ANDI JAN\n\nBabur's father Urnar Shaikh Mirza died at the fort of Akhsi while tending his pigeons. As Babur describes, \"the fort of Akhsi is situated above a deep ravine, along this ravine stand the palace buildings, and from it on Monday, Ramzan 4, Umar Shaikh Mirzd flew, with his pigeons and their house, and became a falcon.\"\n\n\"At the time of Umar Shaikh Mirza's accident, I was in the Four Gardens (Char-biigh) of Andijan. The news reached Andijan on Tuesday, Ramzan 5 (June 9th); I mounted at once, with my followers and retainers, intending to go into the fort but, on our getting near the Mirza's Gate, Shirim Taghai took hold of my bridle and moved off towards the Praying Place. It had crossed his mind that if a great ruler like Si. Ahmad Mirza came in force, the Andijan Begs would make me over to him and the country, but that if he took me to Auzkint and the foothills thereabouts, I, at any rate, should not be made over and could go to one of my mother's (half-) brothers, Sl. Mahmud Khan or Sl. Ahmad Khdn.\"\n\nThe painting shows Babur mounted on a horse followed by his retainers going to Akhsi. In the background is the fort of Andijan. The artist has depicted Babur in a sorrowful mood. In the foreground are soldiers armed with muskets, and a courtier on horse-back praying with his hands raised.\n\nACCLAMATION OF NINE STANDARDS\n\nArtist, Jagnath\n\nThe Mughals observed ceremonies and rules which were laid long ago by Chingiz Khan. For each clan a place was fixed in battle-array. One of their ceremonies was acclamation of nine standards which is thus described by Babur:\n\n\"The standards were acclaimed in Mughal fashion. The Khan dismounted and nine standards were set up in front of him. A Mughal tied a long strip of white cloth to the thigh-bone of a cow and took the other end in his hand. Three other long strips of white cloth were tied to the staves of three of the nine standards, just below the yak-tails, and their other ends were brought for the Khan to stand on one and for me and SI. Muh. Khanika to stand each one of the two others. The Mughal who had hold of the strip of cloth fastened to the cow's leg, then said something in Mughal while he looked at the standards and made signs towards them. The Khan and those present sprinkled quiniz in the direction of the standards; hautbois and drums were sounded towards them ; the army flung the war-cry out three times towards them, mounted, cried it again and rode at the gallop round them.\"\n\nThis incident relates to 1502 A.D. and took place at Bish-lcint on the Khujand-Tashkent road. Babur is standing on a strip of white cloth. In the foreground is an old Mughal soldier holding a piece of cloth which he has tied to the leg of a cow. In the background trumpets are being sounded and drums beaten.\n\nKHUSRAU SHAH PAYING HOMAGE TO BABUR AT DOSHI NEAR KABUL\n\nKhusrau Shah, a Turkistani Qipchaq, was a noble of Mahrmad Mirth' who ruled the country from Amu to the Hindukush mountains. Babur describes him as 'black-souled and vicious, dunder-headed and senseless, disloyal, traitor, and a coward who had not the pluck to stand up to a hen!' He met Babur at Dashi near Kabul. Babur thus describes their meeting:\n\n\"Next day, one in the middle of the First Rabi (end of August, 1504 A.D.), riding light, I crossed the Andar-ãb water and took my seat under a large plane-tree near Dashi, and thither came Khusrau Shah, in pomp and splendour, with a great company of men. According to rule and custom, he dismounted some way off and then made his approach. Three times he knelt. When we saw one another, three times also on taking leave; he knelt once when asking after my welfare, once again when he offered his tribute, and he did the same with Jahangir Mirza and with Mirza Khan (Wais).\"\n\nBaburis seated under a plane-tree and the person kneeling in front of him is Khusrau Shah. In the foreground are his retainers including one holding a hawk. After receiving homage from Khusrau Shah Babur marched to Kabul.\n\nTHE GARDEN OF FIDELITY NEAR KABUL (BAGH-I-WAFA)\n\nArtist, Bhagwan\n\nWith the capture of Kabul in 1504 begins the second phase in the career of Babur. Kabul is known for its temperate fruits, viz, the grape, pomegranate, apricot, apple, pear, peach, plum and walnut. In the hotter valleys, even sugarcane, orange and citron were cultivated. Now that he had some peace, he indulged in his favourite hobby of gardening. In 1508-9 he laid out a garden known as Bagh-i-wafa near Fort Adinapur, which he thus describes:\n\n\"The garden lies high, has running-water close at hand, and a mild winter climate. In the middle of it, a one-mill stream flows constantly past the little hill on which are the four garden-plots. In the south-west part of it there is a reservoir, 10 by 10, round which are orange-trees and a few pomegranates, the whole encircled by a trefoil-meadow. This is the best part of the garden, a most beautiful sight when the oranges take colour. Truly that garden is admir-ably situated !\"\n\nOn the top of the painting is Koh-i-Safed, the snow-covered mountain, and a persian wheel for lifting water. Below is the Char-bagh divided into four plots in which oranges are growing. A plantain and two cypresses grow in one of the plots. A keord plant is in the plot on the top right. In the reservoir in the centre a pair of ducks are gambolling. A solitary gardener is digging the soil in the plot to the left.\n\nMaur thus records a visit to Kigh-i-wafd in A.D. 1519. \"We dismounted in the Bligh-i-wafd; its oranges had yellowed beautifully; its spring-bloom was well-advanced, and it was very charming.\"\n\nBABUR SUPERVISING THE CONSTRUCTION OF A RESERVOIR ON THE SPRING OF `KHWAJA SIH YARAN', NEAR KABUL\n\nArtist, Prem\n\nBabur describes the pleasant villages around Kabul and their gardens. He records thirty three different varieties of tulips on the foothills of Dasht-i-Shaikh. In the ranges of Pamghan were a number of villages which grew grapes. Of these he admired Istalif as the best of the lot.\n\n\"Few villages match Istalif\", wrote Babur, \"with vineyards and fine orchards on both sides of its great torrent, with waters needing no ice, cold and, mostly, pure. Of its Great garden Aulugh Beg Mirza had taken forcible possession; I took it over, after paying its price to the owners. There is a pleasant halting-place outside it, under great planes, green, shady and beautiful. A one-mill stream, having trees on both banks, flows constantly through the middle of the garden; formerly its course was zig-zag and irregular; I had it made straight and orderly; so the place became very beautiful.\n\n\"I ordered that the spring should be enclosed in mortared stone-work, 10 by 10, and that a symmetrical, right-angles platform should be built on each of its sides, so as to overlook the whole field of Judas trees. In, the world over, there is a place to match this when the arghwans are in full bloom, I do not know it. The yellow arghwiin grows plentifully there also, the red and the yellow flowering at the same time.\n\n\"In order to bring water to a large round seat which I had built on the hillside and planted round with willows, I had a channel dug across the slope from a half-mill stream, constantly flowing in a valley to the south-west of Sih-ydran. The date of cutting this channel was found in jui-khush (kindly-channel).\"\n\nIn this colourful painting Babur holding a hawk is standing near the reservoir, which he got constructed. In the background is his tent. On the top of the painting the artist has painted a dancing peacock, tail spread out into a gorgeous fan, admired by a pair of pea-hens. Surely it is a reminder of India, the home of the painter. On the rocks are a pair of mountain goats. In the foreground a grey-hound is drinking water from the stream. It is undoubtedly one of the most delightful paintings of the Babur.\n\nBIRD CATCHING AT BARAN\n\nArtist, Bhag\n\nBabur Nama is in Kohistan province of Afghanistan. Babur wrote, \"More beautiful in Spring than any part even of Kabul are the openlands of Baran and the skirt of Gul-i-bahar. Many sorts of tulips bloom there.\n\nKabul in Spring is an Eden of verdure and blossom Matchless in Kabul the Spring of Gul-i-bahar and Baran Few places are equal to these for spring excursions for hawking or bird-shooting.\n\n\"Along the Baran people take masses of cranes (tarnii) with the cord ; masses of afiqdr, qargarii and qatan also. This method of bird catching is unique. They twist a cord as long as the arrow's flight, tie the arrow at one end and a bildfirgii at the other, and wind it up, from the arrow-end, on a piece of wood, span-long and wrist-thick, right up to the bildfirgii. They then pull out the piece of wood, leaving just the hole it was in. The bildfirgei being held fast in the hand, the arrow is shot off towards the coming flock. If the cord twist round a neck or wing, it brings the bird down. On the Baran everyone takes birds in this way.\" By this device Baran people catch the many herons from which they take the turban-aigrettes sent from Kabul for sale in Khurasan.\n\n\"Of bird-catchers there is also the band of slave-fowlers, two or three hundred house-holds, whom some descendant of Timm-Beg made to migrate from near Multan to the Baran. Bird-catching is their trade; they dig tanks, set decoy-birds on them, put a net over the middle, and in this way take all sorts of birds.\"\n\nThis painting by Bhag is one of the best studies of birds in the Babur Nama. Outside the net set by the fowler who is hiding behind a screen are a pair of hoopoes, sarus cranes, snipes and other water-birds. A sarus crane is innocently flying into the net. In the foreground is a mountain stream with lotuses among whom ducks are gambolling, providing a poetic touch to this painting.\n\nBABUR FEASTING AT KOHAT\n\nArtist, Daulat\n\n\"Whether to cross the water of Sind, or where else to go, was discussed in that camp. Baqi Chaghaniani represented that it seemed we might go, without crossing the river and with one night's halt, to a place called Kohat where were many rich tribesmen; moreover he brought Kabulis forward who represented the matter just as he had done. We had never heard of the place, but, as he, my man in great authority, saw it good to go to Kohat and had brought forward support of his recommendation.\"\n\nSTAGE SET FOR A MEETING BETWEEN BABUR AND THE MIRZAS\n\nThis painting relates to a meeting between Babur and the Mirzas of Khurdsdn on 26thOctober, 1506, on the Murghab river. About the Mirzds, Babur comments, 'They were good enough as company and in social matters, but they were strangers to war, strategy, equipment, bold fight and encounter.' He thus describes this meeting:\n\n\"Four divans (tushuk) had been placed in the tent. Always in the Mirzd's tents one side was like a gate-way and at the edge of this gate-way he always sat. A divan was set there now on which he and Muzaffar Mirza sat together. Abu'l muhsin Mirzd and I sat on another, set in the right-hand place of honour (tur). On another, to Badiuz zamdn Mirza's left, sat Ibn-i-husain Mirza with Qasim SI. Auzbeg, a son-in-law of the late Mirza and father of Qasim-i-husain Sultan. To my right and below my divan was one on which sat Jahangir Mirza and Abdu'r-razzaq Mirza. To the left of Qdsim SI. and Ibn-i-husain Mirld, but a good deal lower, were Muh. Baranduq Beg, Zu'n-nun Beg and Qasim Beg.\n\nAlthough this was not a social gathering, cooked viands were brought in, drinks were set with the food, and near them gold and silver cups.\"\n\nBABUR ENJOYING A FEAST GIVEN BY THE MIRZAS AT HERAT\n\nIn 1507 Babur paid a visit to Herat. Here he saw the gardens, mosques and mausolea including Gazur-gah, the tomb of Khwaja Abdullah Ansari. Here he married Masrima-Sultan Begam. The Mirzds entertained Babur at a feast.\n\n\"Bad! Uzi-zaman Mirza asked me to a party arranged in the Maqauwi-khana of the world-adorning Garden. He asked also some of my close circle, and some of our braves.\n\n\"At this party they set a roast goose before me but as I was no carver or disjointer of birds, I left it alone. 'Do you not like it?' inquired the Mirza. Said I, 'am a poor carver.' On this he at once disjointed the bird and set it again before me. In such matters he had no match. At the end of the party he gave me an enamelled waist-dagger, a char-qab, and a tipu-chaqt.\"\n\nThis is a beautiful painting showing a feast in a garden, under the shade of a chenart. Cooks are busy cooking in the foreground and attendants are carrying food. Babur is making a futile attempt to carve a goose, while Badi-u'z-zaman Mirza is looking on and is about to intervene.\n\nBABUR CAPTURES A FLOCK OF SHEEP FROM THE HAZARAS\n\nAfter seeing the sights of Herat, Babur left for Kabul. Instead of travelling by the Kandahar road which though longer, was safe and easy, he took the mountain-road which was difficult and dangerous. During the night there was heavy snow-fall and a blizzard. He took shelter in a cave along with his men. Next morning while he was on the move a body of Turkman Hazards attacked his army with arrows.\n\n\"I myself collected a few of the Hazards' sheep, gave them into Yarak Taghai's charge, and went to the front. By ridge and valley, driving horses and sheep before us, we went to Timur Beg's Langar and there dismounted. Fourteen or fifteen Hazard theives had fallen into our hands; I had thought of having them put to death when we next dismounted, with various torture, as a warning to all high-waymen and robbers, but Qdsim Beg came across them on the road and, with mistimed compassion, set them free.\"\n\nIn this painting we see Babur on horse-back and in front of him is a flock of sheep captured from the Hazards.\n\nBABUR AND COMPANIONS WARMING THEMSELVES BEFORE A CAMP FIRE\n\nWhile Babur was raiding the Turkman Hazards, news came that his nobles in Kabul had mutinied and had declared Miria Khan as Padshdh. They also spread a rumour that the Mirzas of Herat had captured Babur and imprisoned him in a fort. On the way to Kabul he encountered intense cold. As he describes:\n\n\"We sent on Ahmad the messenger (yasilwal) and Qara Ahmad Yuninchi to say to the Begs, 'Here we are at the time promised; be ready! behold!' After crossing Minar-hill and dismounting on its skirt, helpless with cold, we lit fires to warm ourselves. It was not time to light the signal-fire; we just lit these because we were helpless in that mighty cold.\" Next morning he reached Kabul and subdued the rebels.\n\nThis painting of a night scene shows Babur's qualities of leadership; his concern for his men and comradely treatment he gave them in times of adversity.\n\nBATTLE SCENE NEAR MURGHAN KOH\n\nArtist, Makra\n\nShaibaq Khan, Uzbek captured Herat in June 1507. The Mirzas supplicated Babur for help. Babur pushed on towards Kandahar. The Uzbeks were led by Shah Beg and his younger brother Muqim. This painting shows a battle near Kandahar. Babur states:\n\n\"We mean time, after putting our adversary to flight, had crossed those same channels towards the naze of Murghan-koh (Birds'-h ill). Someone on a grey horse was going backwards and forwards irresolutely along the hill-skirt, while we were getting across; I likened him to Shah Beg; seemingly it was he.\n\n\"Our men having beaten their opponents, all went off to pursue and unhorse them. Remained with me eleven to count, `Abdu'l-lah the librarian being one. Muqim was still keeping his ground and fighting. Without a glance at the fewness of our men, we had the nagarets sounded and, putting our trust in God, moved with face set for Muqim.\" After this incident Babur moved on to Kandahar, and looted the treasury.\n\nIt is an excellent painting which conveys the excitement of a battle. It is packed with action, and is symbolic of the restless energy of Babur. Babur holding a naked sword is charging the enemy. Facing him is Muqim holding a shield. Drums are being lustily beaten by the drummers of both sides.\n\nBABUR CROSSING A RIVER SEATED ON A RAFT\n\nIn May 1508 Babur abandoned the invasion of Hindustan. He visited Lamghanat which borders the land inhabited by Kafirs, who had resisted conversion to Islam. Here he crossed a river seated on a raft for the first time. Thus states BAbur:\n\n\"As it was not found desirable to go on into Hindustan, I sent Mulla Baba of Pashaghar back to Kabul with a few braves. Mean time I marched from near MandrAwar to Mar and Shiwa and lay there for a few days. From Atar I visited Kanar and Nurgal; from Kfinar I went back to camp on a raft; it was the first time I had sat on one; it pleased me much, and the raft came into common use thereafter.\"\n\nThe naked swimmers are pushing the raft with all their might. On the raft Babur is calmly seated surrounded by his body-guards.\n\nOn 6thMarch, 1506, Babur's first son Htunayun was born in the citadel of Kabul. A feast was arranged in the Chdr-Bagh. All the Begs brought presents, and dancers entertained the party.\n\nDEER HUNTING IN 'ALI-SHANG AND ALANGAR MOUNTAINS\n\nArtist, Tulsi\n\nThis painting by Tulsi, who specializes in drawing animals, depicts a hunting scene in Afghanistan. Apart from deer of different varieties, rabbits, foxes and wild sheep are also depicted. On a rock a chakor is perching. Babur describes this event as follows:\n\n\"On Saturday (29th) we hunted the hill between 'Ali-shang and Alangair. One hunting-circle having been made on the 'Ali-shang side, another on the Alangar, the deer were driven down off the hill and many were killed. Returning from hunting, we dismounted in a garden belonging to the Maliks of Alangar and there had a party.\"\n\n'Ali-shang and Alangar are mountainous districts of Afghanistan bordering the Hindu-kush, inhabited by Kafirs who retained their old religion and did not embrace Islam. Babur describes that trees cover the banks of the streams of 'Ali-Shang and Alangdr below the fort. The fort shown in the painting is probably the same. He also mentions that the valley grows grapes, green and red, all trained on trees.\n\nAs a study of fauna of Afghanistan, this painting has considerable value. It also conveys the excitement of a hunt most vividly.\n\nBABUR HUNTING RHINOCEROS NEAR BIGRAM (PESHAWAR)\n\nThis painting describes a hunting scene dated 10th December, 1526 near Bigram (Pesha-war). Babur crossed the river Siyalh-fib, and formed a hunting circle down-stream. He records.\n\n\"After a little, a person brought word that there was a rhino in a bit of jungle near Bigram, and that people had been stationed near-about it. We betook ourselves, loose rein, to the place, formed a ring round the jungle, made a noise, and brought the rhino out, when it took its way across the plain. Humdyun and those come with him from that side (Tramoun-tana), who had never seen one before, were much entertained. It was pursued for two miles; many arrows were shot at it; it was brought down without having made a good set at manor horse. Two others were killed. I had often wondered how a rhino and an elephant would be-have if brought face to face; this time one came out right in front of some elephants the mahauts were bringing along, it did not face them when the mahauts drove them towards it, but got off in another direction.\"\n\nIn the sixteenth century rhinos were found as far north as Peshawar and Sind. Now they are no longer to be seen in these areas. At present rhinos are preserved in the game sanctuaries of Assam and northern Bengal.\n\nTHE BATTLE OF PANIPAT\n\nBabur invaded India for the fifth time in 1525. He defeated Daulat Khan Lodi and occupied Punjab. He marched through Jaswan dun, Rapar, Banur, Arnbala, Shahabad, and reached Panipat on 12th April, 1525. He collected seven hundred carts, which were joined togehter with ropes of raw hide. Between every two carts mantelets were fixed, behind which matchlockmen were posted. Opposing him was Ibrahim Lodi's army of 1,00,000 men and one thousand elephants. Mustafa, his commander of artillery made excellent use of his guns.\n\nBabur records,\n\n\"Mustafa the commissary for his part made excellent discharge of zarb-zan shots from the left hand of the centre. Our right, left, centre and turning-parties having surrounded the enemy rained arrows down on him and fought ungrudgingly. He made one or two small charges on our right and left but under our men's arrows, fell back on his own centre. His right and left hands (qui) were massed in such a crowd that they could neither move forward against us nor force a way for flight.\n\n\"When the incitement to battle had come, the Sun was spear-high; till mid-day fighting had been in full force; noon passed, the foe was crushed in defeat, our friends rejoicing and gay. By God's mercy and kindness, this difficult affair was made easy for us!\"\n\nIbrahim lay dead among thirty thousand of his soldiers, and Babur emerged the winner.\n\nThe painting shows the battle-scene. Between the guns, soldiers armed with bows and arrows are making sallies. It is surprising that hills are shown in the background. The battle-field of Panipat is a flat plain. Drummers are beating drums to infuse courage among the attackers. On the top of the painting is shown the town of Panipat\n\nSQUIRRELS, A PEACOCK AND A PEA-HEN, SARUS CRANES AND FISHES\n\nArtist, Bhawani\n\nBabur appropriately starts his account of the birds of India with the peacock, the national bird of India.\n\n\"The peacock (Ar. Taus) is a beautifully coloured and splendid bird. Its form (andam) is not equal to its colouring and beauty. Its body may be as large as the crane's (tüawa) but it is not so tall. On the head of both cock and hen are 20 or 30 feathers rising some 2 or 3 inches high. The hen has neither colour nor beauty. The head of the cock has an iridescent collar (tauq sfisani); its neck is of a beautiful blue; below the neck, its back is painted in yellow, parrot-green, blue and violet colours. The flowers on its back are much the smaller; below the back as far as the tail-tips are larger flowers painted in the same colours. The tail of some peacocks grows to the length of a man's extended arms. It has a small red tail, under its flowered feathers, like the tail of other birds. Its flight is feebler than the pheasants; it cannot do more than one or two short flights. Hindustani call the peacock mor.\"\n\nThis painting is by Bhawani, who excels in painting birds and animals. On the top squirrels are playing on a tree. In the middle, a peacock and a pea-hen are shown, below a pair of sarus cranes, and in the pond a pair of fishes. It is one of the best paintings of birds and animals in this Babur Nama.\n\nBABUR CROSSING THE RIVER SON OVER A BRIDGE OF BOATS\n\nArtist, Jagnath\n\nThis painting depicts an incident which took place on 14th April, 1529 when Babur marched through Bihar and crossed the river Son by a bridge of boats. He had given names to the prominent boats; a large one built in Agra was named Araish (Repose). Another presented by Araish Khan was named Araish (Ornament). Another large-sized one was named Gunjaish (Capacious). In it he had another platform set up, on the top of the one already in it. To a little skiff was given the name of Farmaish (Commissioned). Babur thus narrates this incident:\n\n\"I left that ground by boat on Thursday. I had already ordered the boats to wait, and on getting up with them, I had them fastened together abreast in line. Though all were not collected there, those there were greatly exceeded the breadth of the river. They could not move on, however, so-arranged, because the water was here shallow, there deep, here swift, there still. A crocodile (gharial) shewing itself, a terrified fish leaped so high as to fall into a boat; it was caught and brought to me.\"\n\nBabur is sitting on the platform of the Gunjaish, surrounded by attendants. In the fore-ground is a boat into which, a fish has leapt. Two soldiers armed with muskets are firing at the crocodile. All the on-lookers are sharing the excitement which the incident has provided.\n\nWriter – M.S. Randhawa\n\n↧\n\nIntroduction to Dharma\n\nThe aim of the Hindu being to break this chain of birth and rebirth that binds him to the earth, the first step to be taken on this path is for each one to perform well his own dharma or righteous duties. Hinduism is unique because it differentiates between the duties of man and man, as also between the duties to be followed at various stages of one's life. Lord Rama's dharma as an exile for 14 years was different to his later dharma as a ruler. The teacher, the nurse, the priest, a mother or father each has to follow his or her own dharma. Duties, whatever they are, have to be performed with excellence and moral purity as the goal.\n\nThe concept of Dharma is fundamental to Hinduism, as it is believed that it is only through the pursuit of Dharma that there is social harmony and peace in the world. The pursuit of Adharma (a path that rejects righteousness) leads to conflicts, discord and imbalance.\n\nThe saying, Dharanat Dharmah' means Dharma sustains the world and it is that which holds the world together. It is duty performed with righteousness, with discipline and moral and spiritual excellence. Varnashrama Dharma is fundamental to Hindu belief and includes the duties of the various occupations, orders and classes (Varna) and the duties in the four stages (ashramas) of one's life. It enjoins that each person's dharma or duty depends on his occupation, position, moral and spiritual development, age and marital status.\n\nThe Caste System\n\nAlthough the caste system has now been legally abolished, it is interesting to know its origin. The original meaning of the word `varna' was order or class of people. When the Indo-Aryans invaded the country, they came across the local inhabitants whom they called Dasas or Dasyus. Instead of destroying them after conquest, as has happened in other civilizations, they absorbed them by giving them a lower but definite place in their society.\n\nIn time this system came to be four-tiered, with four classes, the Brahmanas or Brahmins (not to be confused with the Brahman) who were the teachers and priests, the Kshatriyas or warriors and rulers, the Vaishyas, those who followed commercial occupations, and the Sudras who performed manual labour and were also farmers and agriculturists. The word 'varna' therefore implied the social order and not caste, as even Manu has given the difference between Varna (class or order) and jati (sect of birth or caste). A man's Varna depended as much on his mental and physical equipment as on heritage. Therefore it was a fluid state. A Brahmin for example, was one who evolved with the guna or qualities and performed the karma, or action, enjoined on a Brahmin. (It was only later that the word `varna' came to mean colour.)\n\nThe jails (or sects) in time became more important than the four main classes. These were mainly occupational (like the goldsmith jail, the weaver jati, the carpenter jail etc.) and served the purpose of guilds which protected the interests of their members, trained the young and saw to it that no outsider entered the fold. In time these jails or sects grouped themselves under the main classes which is why we speak today of four castes. However, it is not the caste of a man but his sect that is important to this day. Even today these sects often do not permit fluidity of movement, even where the old occupations have broken down and new ones have come in.\n\nThe untouchables or outcastes were originally those who had broken certain caste rules. For example, the Nayadis, who were considered outcastes of the lowest order, were originally Brahmins who were excommunicated for some reason. Also later the Hindus, who were originally meat-eaters, slowly changed their eating habits to vegetarianism, especially the Brahmins and Vaishyas who were influenced by early Buddhism and Jainism. With this change, those who ate beef or the meat of certain proscribed animals came to be considered outcastes or untouchables, as, by this time, the cow had come to be regarded akin to a mother, the people, being largely rural, having to depend on the cow's products for sustenance. (This is why the cow is given the reverence due to a mother in Hindu society to this day.)\n\nHowever there is no religious sanction whatsoever in Hinduism to the concept of untouchability although later additions on the subject were inserted into the earlier scriptures to justify its existence. It was a purely social practice introduced by the upper castes to provide themselves with menial labour to perform certain tasks repulsive to themselves such as those of cemetery keepers, scavengers and cleaners. Hindu society has much to answer for this inhuman treatment of a whole section of its own people, but the Hindu religion had nothing to do with it.\n\nThese four classes were not as rigid in ancient times as they became later. In the Upanishads is the story of Satyakama, neither son of a servant maid, Jabala, who did not know his gotra or clan of origin as even his mother did not know who his father was nor his caste. He went to a great teacher known for his wisdom that took young Brahmin boys as disciples, and told him the truth of his parentage. He gave his name as Satyakama Jabala, after his mother. The Guru, impressed with the truthfulness of the young man, initiated him as a Brahmachari or student under him. He then gave him 400 head of cattle and asked him to take them to the forest and to return only when these became a thousand in number.\n\nWhile living in the forest alone for years, Satyakama learnt of the Brahman, the Absolute, from communing with Nature, from the clouds in the skies, from the music of the birds, from the trees and the flowers and from the beauty of all Creation around and about him.\n\nAfter he had 1000 head of cattle he returned. When his Guru gazed at the brilliant, shining face of his pupil, he knew that the young man had realised the Brahman and had only to complete this knowledge by study with his teacher. Although only Brahmins were initiated into higher religious education not birth alone but aptitude also permitted the upward movement of the castes in Upanishadic times, as seen by the beautiful story of Satyakama Jabala.\n\nThe great Brahmin Rishi, Vyasa, was born when Parashara, the grandson of the Rishi Vasishta, fell in love with a beautiful dark-skinned woman of the fisher tribe, later named Satyavati. The child born to them was named Krishna Dvaipayana, after his dark colour (krishna) taken after his mother, and the island (dvipa) on which he was born. Only later did he become known as Veda Vyasa. Yet his knowledge of the Vedas determined his caste as a Brahmin Rishi and not his birth to a fisherwoman of a low caste.\n\nVyasa is often worshipped as divinity in human form, so great is the regard given to him by Hindus through the ages. His birth to a tribal fisherwoman was not looked down upon, nor did it affect his position as a Brahmin sage of the highest caste.\n\n(Similarly Valmiki, the author of the epic, the Ramayana, was a hunter of the lowest caste who came to be considered a Brahmin Rishi by virtue of his erudition.) Satyavati subsequently married Santanu, King of Hastinapura. Her son Vichitravirya could not bear any children and her step-son, Bhishma, would not do so in view of a promise given to his late father not to marry or bear children, so that Satyavati's progeny would rule the kingdom.\n\nAccording to the Niyoga custom of the times, on the death of a childless man or even if he were alive but could not father children, his brother could father children on his behalf. When it was found that her sons could not bear children, the great queen, Satyavati, called on the son born to her through Sage Parashara, the Sage Vyasa, and asked him to father children by her two daughters-in-law, which he did. A servant woman of the palace approached Vyasa in a spirit of great devotion and to her was born Vidura considered again one of the greatest of Brahmin sages (in view of his wisdom and knowledge of the Dharma Shastras) in spite of his mother being a servant woman of the lowest caste.\n\nIt was from the sons of Vyasa that the Pandavas and the Kauravas were descended. Their great-grandmother, Satyavati, belonged to a fisher tribe and their great-grandfather, Parashara, was a Brahmin sage. Yet because they were princes of the royal house of Hastinapura, they were considered Kshatriyas. In actual fact they were not so by birth, only by occupation, once again proving that caste was purely occupational.\n\nUtanga, a childhood Brahmin friend of Krishna, took a boon from him that, in his wanderings, Krishna would provide him with water whenever he needed it. Once, when he felt very thirsty, he thought of the Lord and suddenly a Nishada (an outcaste hunter) appeared before him clothed in filthy rags, and offered water from his animal-skin water-bag. Utanga refused it and berated Krishna in his mind, as he felt he had not kept to his promise.\n\nThe Nishada tried to persuade Utanga again and again to drink the water but Utanga was adamant. The hunter then disappeared and the Lord appeared before Utanga and told him that he had sent Indra, King of the Devas, as a hunter with amrita, the nectar of immortality. Since Utanga had not shown any wisdom but had continued to differentiate between man and man based on externals such as caste, he had missed the rare chance of attaining immortality. The moral of this story is obvious.\n\nThe disciples of the great philosopher, Adi Shankara, once asked a Chandala (an outcaste), to move away from his path. \"Who are you and who am I? Is the Self within me different from yours?\" queried the Chandala (believed to be Shiva in disguise). Shankara, realising the wisdom of these words, prostrated before the Chandala saying, \"One who is established in the Brahman, be he a low-born Chandala or a twice-born Brahmin, verily I declare him my Guru\".\n\nAs late as in the 8th century, an untouchable could be considered a Guru by one born a brahmin like Adi Shankara.\n\nWriter – Shakunthala Jagannathan\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nIntroduction to Early Pandya, Seventh to Ninth Century A.D.\n\nLike the Pallava king Mahendravarman, who was converted by Appar, the older contemporary of Tirujnanasam-bandar, Arikesari Parankusa, the Pandyan king, was re-claimed from Jainism by the saint, Tirujnanasam-bandar, in the latter half of the seventh century A. D. This king with the zeal of a new convert and with the enthusiastic support of his queen advancedhis faith.\n\nDuring the time of Simhavishnu, who overcame the Pandyas, his son Mahendravarman and grandson Narasimhavarman, who dominated in the South during his time, as the vanquisher of even Pulakesin of the Western Chalukya dynasty, Pallava influence was dominant in the South. The Pandya king Maravarman Rajasimha, also known as Pallavabhanjana, found it a favourable moment to attack the Pallavas during the time of Nandivarman Pallavamalla. His son Nedunjadayan had a minister uttarantantri Marangari alias Madhurakavi, who excavated a temple for Vishnu in the Annamalai hill in the neighbor-hood of Madurai and recorded it in an inscription. It is this history of the early Pandyas which should help us under-stand why both the cave temples and the rock-cut free standing temples of the Pandyas so closely resemble and recall those of the early Pallavas.\n\nThe Pandyas, like the Chalukyas, were frequently fighting the Pallavas, but nevertheless were struck with the beauty of the Pallava cave temples and monolithic shrines.\n\nThey had also a matrimonial alliance with the Pallavas as in the case of Kochchadayan, the father of Maravarman Rajasimha, and the aesthetic taste of a princess of the Pallava line would not have gone without self-expression, specially when we remember that Rangapataka, the queen of Pallava Rajasimha, associated herself with her husband in the construction of lovely temples at Kanchipuram, and this artistic taste was inborn in their family. It is no wonder therefore that, considering the proximity of the Pallava country, with the Chera power practically eclipsed at the time, the Pandyas adopted the ideas of the Pallavas in architecture, sculpture and painting.\n\nIn the Tirumalaipuram cave temple, there are fragments discovered by Professor Jouveau Dubreuil to show specimens of the painter's art in the early Pandyan period. The cave closely resembles the Pallava caves of Mahendravarman. Though most of the paintings here are obliterated, the few that remain show the dexterity of the painter in portraying such themes as the swan or the duck and lotuses in bud and bloom in pleasing patterns covering the ceiling and on the pillar brackets.\n\nThere are also themes like hunters and their wives, one of whom is shown carrying a wild boar after a hunt. This theme of bacchanalian orgies suggests traces of foreign influence, which is explained by the fact that the Pandyan kingdom was a rich commercial centre, with contacts all over the civilised world, specially with Rome, from the early centuries of the Christian era. The pearls of the Pandyan fisheries were greatly in demand in Rome and a regular colony of Yavanas existed at Madurai.\n\nTo Professor Jouveau Dubreuil, we owe the discovery of paintings similar to those at Ajanta in Sittannavasal. These are in the best tradition of classical art and were originally believed to be Pallava. It is now found that there are two layers of paintings, an earlier one and a later one, as also an inscription which proves that what were originally reckoned Pallava are really Pandyan paintings of the ninth century A.D.\n\nThe ceiling of the cave contains a picture of a magnificent lake with beautiful buffaloes, geese and fish frolicking amidst lotuses in bud and bloom, in the gathering of which some youths are shown engaged. The figures are drawn with great care and delicacy of feeling. The most magnificent of the paintings, however, are the king wearing a lovely crown and accompanied by his queen, with an umbrella raised over both, and two female dancers of exquisite grace and proportions, all presented on the cubical parts of the pillars of the mandapa. Much of this has been ruined by weather and vandalism. There is still enough left to help us judge the skill of the painter during the early phase of Pandyan rule. The coiffure of the dancers, the lines composing the face, the contour of the body in beautiful flexions, the attitude of the hands in rhythmic dance motion is the work of a great master. The grace of the crown with minute details of workmanship and the dignity of the royal figure in the company of his consort cannot be praised too highly.\n\nWriter – C. Shivaramamurti\n\n↧\n\nDhundar school Paintings\n\nIn ancient times the regions in and around Jaipur were known as Dhundar. Most parts of Alwar, Jaipur, Shekhawati are still called Dhundar Pradesh. Some scholars are of the opinion that this province acquired the name because of a demon called Dhund. But other scholars hold the view that this province, with shifting sand dunes, was recognised as Dhundar Pradesh.' The Dhund river might also be considered the principal basis for its name.\n\nUnder the banner of the Dhundar school, we may study the Amber, Jaipur, Alwar and Shekhawati styles, and the Uniara substyle among others. Dhundar Pradesh has its own distinct features and geographical boundaries. In touch with the centre of gravity of the administration, Delhi, and with the centre of culture, Braj, the Dhundar style of painting had continued its pace of development through various new forms from time to time.\n\nAmber Style\n\nThe Amber style is the rich heritage of the rajas of the Kacchava and Kush dynasties. In the 10th-11thcenturies they had a large kingdom around Gwalior. In 1071, Sod Deo along with his son Dullaha Rai came to Dhundar Pradesh and steadily expanded their kingdom. Their descendants made Amber their capital, and this city held this position for seven centuries.' Ancient specimens of the Amber style of painting are not available. Frescoes drawn around 1600-1614 upon cenotaphs in Amber are the oldest available pieces of this style.' Paintings in the cenotaph of Bhar Mal acquire great significance from the historical point of view. Inside the cenotaph a panel of these 40 paintings depicts the early history of the Amber style.\n\nThese paintings were drawn straight upon the stone without having made them in the prevalent Jaipur Arais style. Each painting is based upon a definite principle. According to subject matter these paintings include scenes of hunting, incarnation, wrestling, yoga, Laila-Majnu, rag-ragini, elephant, camel and fighting among animals.\n\nOriginal colours like garun, safeda , kaluns were used in these paintings. Drawing had been made either in red or black and colour was applied on the figures. The strong influence of the paintings of the period in reigns of Akbar and Jehangir is clearly discernible in these paintings. Besides the impact of artistic folk art a circular jamma with four pointed edges and Jehangiri turban are some special characteristics of these paintings. Women in Rajasthani attire, including ghagra, odhni, blouse, adorned with Mughal style ornaments are frequently seen in such paintings.\n\nBesides the cenotaphs of Amber, frescoes in the Amber style may be noticed in the so-called Mughal garden of Bairath, in which themes like rag-ragini, Krishna-Lila, nayika-bhed, Laila-Majnu, wrestlers, elephant riding, horse riding, camel riding were painted. To study the early stage of the Amber style, these paintings deserve careful scrutiny.'\n\nMojamabad, adjoining Jaipur, was also a centre of the early Amber style. A cenotaph of Mojamabad which possessed frescoes in this style is now in ruins. The Amber style has been much influenced by the Mughal style.\n\nIn the middle of the 16thcentury the rajas of Rajasthan began to bow to the mighty Mughal Empire. In 1562, Akbar signified his good relations with the kingdom of Amber by marrying the daughter of Raja Bhar Mal. In the reign of Raja Man Singh (1589-1610), the Kacchava dynasty of Amber maintained very close relations with the Mughals.\n\nThe cenotaphs of Amber, the gardens of Bairath and Mojamabad, the birthplace of Raja Man Singh, have frescoes which were greatly influenced by the Mughal style. The famous pictorial text Rajina-Namali (1584-1588) compiled at the court of Akbar and preserved in the city Palace Museum, Jaipur, provides very useful information about the initial growth of the Amber style and details regarding artistic exchanges.\n\nThe second stage of development of this style commenced in the reign of Mirza Raja Jai Singh (1625-1667). The renowned Ritikaleen poet Bihari was one of his courtiers. Bihari-Satsai deeply influenced many artists. Paintings belonging to this age are rarely available. They exhibit the salient features of folk art (Pl. 30) and the impact of the Mughal school.\n\nSalient Features\n\nThe style possesses its own characteristics, in which the structure of bodies of both male and female has been much influenced by Rajasthani folk art. Because of their kinship with the Mughals mutual cultural exchange was natural. Hence the impact of ornamented dresses belonging to the periods of Akbar and Jehangir is discernible.\n\nJamma with four pointed edges and later circular jamma and tight-fitting pyjama, Jehangiri turban style, dress like that worn by Chhagtai women, are quite visible in the Amber style. Black phulitline on hands hagra, odlmi are closely linked with Rajasthani style.\n\nPoor quality of line is seen in the Apbhransh style, and so are natural colours like hirmich, kaluns, safeda, pewari, extensively used in the shape of animals, birds and trees as in folk art. In sum and substance, the Amber style has its own constitution quite visible in these frescoes and in some pictorial texts.\n\nJaipur Style\n\nThe Jaipur style has inherited the Amber style as a cultural legacy. Or it may be presumed that the Amber style itself grew in a new environment at the time of founding Jaipur city, and since then it has been called the Jaipur style. Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh laid the foundation of Jaipur in 1727 and constructed it as his new capital instead of Amber. He had the distinction of being a great astronomer, astrologer, mathematician and keen lover of art. Hence he had built many beautiful and majestic buildings like the observatory, Chandra Mahal, Jai Niwas Bagh, Talkatora, Sisodia Rani Palace and thus gave a new cultural direction to Jaipur.\n\nJaipur, because of is architectural charm, pleasant combination of colours and scientifically laid out plan, is known as the Pink City of India. Owing to its traditional miniatures, artistic cottage industries, existing festivals and colourful dress Jaipur has been a great cultural centre since its inception.\n\nThe newly laid out city attracted architects, artists and other learned personalities from every part of the country. The traditional Kacchava or Amber style preferred tender drawings. Because of the close ties with the Mughal court, the impact of the Mughal style became more pronounced in this period. Muhammad Shah was a court artist of great skill. Because of the powerful cultural impact of the Mughals some doubts about paintings of this period are often heard.\n\nSawai Jai Singh's son Raja Ishwari Singh (1743-1750) was a great Tantric. In his reign he was engaged in a constant struggle with the Mahrattas and ended his life with a dose of poison. But in his short rule he constructed an iser latt to commemorate his victories over the Mahrattas.\n\nIn his time, Sahib Ram, a chittara, emerged as a talented artist. He painted a portrait of Raja Ishwari Singh with the help of Chandras which has been recognized as of high quality. Another famous artist of his period was Latt Chittara, who had painted many pictures depicting animals and birds in struggle. These pictures are very lively.\n\nIn the reign of Sawai Madho Singh I (1751-1767), consistent instability prevailed because of differences between Jats and Mahrattas, but still Sisodia Rani Palace and Chandra Palace were adorned with frescoes. The traditional frescoes of Jaipur had reached the portals of have! is. The havelis of Pundrik deserve special notice.\n\nSahib Ram earned the reputation of being a seasoned artist in this period. He painted large-sized portraits with Ramji Dass and Govindji, two more artists, while Lall Chittara continued to paint various royal sports. In paintings of this age the Mughal influence began to wane and a pure Rajput style showed signs of replacing it. In place of paintings the traditional ornamented Manikuttim style in which beads, red and wooden mannis, are pasted together, began to receive encouragement.\n\nThe reign of Maharaja Prithvi Singh (1767-1779) was short. Artists patronised by the state continued to pursue their vocation. Court artists Hira Nand and Trilok earned great fame. In 1778 they drew a life-sized portrait of their maharaja.\n\nWith his sudden death his younger brother Sawai Pratap Singh (1779-i803) took charge of the administration. He was a keen lover of art and literature and he added new chapters to the development of artistic and literary activities in the state. He was drawn towards religion and poetry, and he composed poems under his pen name Braj Niddhi. He also dedicated himself to Pushti Marg, which had developed his devotion to the Krishna-Bhakti cult. Twenty-one texts he compiled are still available. The world famous Hawa Mahal was built in his regime. Pritam Niwas, adorned with traditionally artistic doors, Diwan-e-Aam, the upper floors of Chandra Mahal, were designed by him as well as built under his guidance.\n\nAs he was both poet and devotee many poets and artists congregated at his court. The seasoned artist Sahib Ram continued to practise his art there. Three pictures he painted have been hailed as unique specimens of his painting. Two are portraits of the maharaja and the third a dance pose of Radha-Krishna.\n\nIn this period themes relating to this of Radha-Krishna, nayika-bheda, rag-ragini, ritu-varnan were extensively portrayed. Large-sized portraits of raja-rani, many paintings concerning Bhagwad-Puran, Durga-Saptshati, Krishna-Lila de-serve special mention here.\" Other artists besides Sahib Ram included Jeevan, Chassi, Salig Ram, Raghu Nath, Ram Sevak, Copal, Udai, Hukma, Chimna, Daya Ram, Raju, Niranjan who deserve special notice. They worked on both frescoes and miniatures in the Jaipur style.\n\nThis style of painting continued to flourish till the reign of Sawai Jagat Singh (1803-1818). The renowned traditional poet Padamakar lived in his court. He linked the Jaipur royal house with Bihari Satsai after having compiled. Jagad Vinod.\" Paintings titled Goverdhan Dharan and Ras-Mandal are exquisite examples of the art of that age.\n\nAfter Sawai Jagat Singh the original form of the Jaipur style did not last long once the impact of British culture began to be felt. In the period of this maharaja, artists began to pursue painting in the representational style. Portraits were drawn like photographs.\n\nAfter studying this new trend the maharaja set up the Maharaja's School of Arts and Crafts and thus gave a new direction to the local style of painting. According to his directive, the whole city was painted pink. The traditional beauty of Jaipur thus vanished into oblivion.\n\nThe Jaipur style was not confined to the royal court but flourished and developed at adjoining centres belonging to feudal lords related to the Jaipur family. From time to time pictures had been painted at Iserda, Siwar, Jhillaya, Chommu, Malpura and Samod. The artistic activities of some centres of these feudal lords had emerged in the new style with many distinctive features.\n\nAt Uniara a new substyle developed, combining both Jaipur and Bundi styles. Frescoes of the palaces of Uniara and miniatures preserved in private collections of the Uniara royal family and Sangram Singh testify to this fact. Paintings in the palace of Samod were also drawn on the basis of the traditional frescoes of the Jaipur style.\n\nGenerally speaking, the traditions of frescoes available in palaces, temples and havelis had spread far and wide. The style of decorations which had adorned temples, cenotaphs and havelis in Shekhawati during the 19th century was influenced by frescoes of the Jaipur style.\n\nSalient Features\n\nThe early Jaipur style being in accordance with the traditional Amber style and because of contacts with the Mughal court had flourished under the Mughal influence. But by and by it acquired the originality of Rajput culture, which had exhibited the predominance of the folk art character and grandeur of Rajputs in paintings of the Jaipur style.\n\nThe haveli of Pratap Narain, along with traditions of drawing frescoes in Galta, the haveli of Pundrik, Chandra Mahal, Sisodia Rani Palace and the palatial buildings of Nagar-Shreshthis and temples with hundreds of pictorial texts, thousands of miniatures and life-sized and larger portraits are specimens of the legacy of the Jaipur style.\n\nAccording to Sangram Singh, the Jaipur style possesses the following significant features.\n\nIn the Jaipur style artists had infused a new tradition of painting life-sized portraits. Early pictures had certainly been drawn in a traditional style. Thou-sands of portraits and group paintings are salient features of the Jaipur style, in which portraits of feudal lords, artists and group paintings of royal processions, mehfils, utsav, colourful hunting scenes had been specially made. In the tradition of miniatures and pictorial texts, Geet-Govind, Ramayan, Krishna, Durga-Saptshati, Mahabharat, rag-ragini, barah-masa, nayika-bhed, the art of pleasure was extensively painted.\n\nThe fresco tradition is the main feature of the Jaipur style. In the Amber style, in palaces, temples, cenotaphs and havelis, arais was applied after the construction of Jaipur city and drawing of frescoes had become an integral part of architecture. This tradition gained great popularity in the 19th century and the seals of Shekha-wati built palatial new havelis in accordance with the new economic order in their respective towns and decorated them with a variety of paintings.\n\nArtists in the Jaipur style applied deep reds in drawing margins on paintings. White, red, yellow were extensively utilised. Applications of gold and silver were also made.\n\nIn paintings of this style men and women appear in proportion. Male figures have clean, attractive faces. They are often depicted with swords tied to their waists. Regarding ornamented dress, males are shown wearing sehra tied with turra kalangi.\n\nWealthy men are shown wearing turban, kurta, pyjama, chogga, angrakin, belt, pataka, shoes in such paintings.\n\nFemale figures are shown with large eyes, bunch of long hair, stout physique and pleasant mood. Like other Rajasthani styles in this style too female figures adorned with tikka, toti, ball, necklace, hansli, satlan, tevta, kantha, banwanti, bangles, payajeb were depicted. In drawing dresses blouse, kurta, clupatta, lehnga, besor tilak and embroidered shoes were frequently used. Artists drew elegant gardens to provide the background in paintings. Lion, tiger, sheep, goat, camel, horse, ox, peacock, duck, parrot were painted to suit a picture's theme.\n\nAfter 1950, because of the introduction of photography, coupled with foreign influences in art and architecture, foreign themes were introduced and assimilated in the Jaipur style, and the original characteristics of the style began to deteriorate slowly.\n\nUniara Substyle\n\nThe wall-paintings of the palace of Uniara Thikana in Tonk district, the 'miniatures' from the personal collection of Rao Raja Rajendra Singh of Uniara and also the paintings from the personal collection of Kumar Sangram Singh, bear their own identity and these can be classified under Jaipur substyle. Situated on the border of Jaipur and Bundi States, Uniara Thikana imbibed the impact of Bundi\n\nart due to matrimonial relations, and the influence of Jaipur art also on account of blood-relations thereby evolving a new style of painting which is known as Uniara substyle.\n\nThe descendants of Naruji of the Amber Kachhwahas came to be known as 'Naruka'. In his lineage Rao Chandra Bhan Dasawant (1586-1660) fighting for the Mughals displayed remarkable valour in the Kandhar Battle (1606). Pleased by his chivalry the Mughal emperor bestowed upon him the four parganas of Uniara, Nagar, Kakor and Banetha.\n\nIn the fifth generation of Rao Chandra Bhan was born an ardent art-lover Rao Raja Sardar Singh (1740-77) who built magnificent palaces in Uniara and Nagar, and patronised artists like Dheema, Meer Bagas, Kashi, Ram Lakhan and Bhim etc. A close observation of the wall-paintings of Nagar and Uniara palaces reveals the collective influence of Bundi and Jaipur substyles on them.\n\nWhile Nagar wall-paintings show the total impact of Bundi style, Uniara paintings especially manifest the two-fold influence of Bundi and Jaipur styles. The wall-paintings of the ruined palace are greatly artistic, and these cover a variety of topics. Here we have paintings like Barahmasa based on Keshav's Kavi Priya, Ragragini, portraits of kings and a number of religious drawings. Among the portraits of kings, the personal portraits of Naruji, Dasaji, Chandra Bhan, Fateh Singh, Sangram Singh, Sardar Singh, Jaswant Singh, Bisan Singh, Bhim Singh, Budh Singh of Bundi, the kings of Jaipur, Kota, Mewar etc. have been painted with utmost excellence. Among the religious paintings, Krishna Leela, various incarnations, Shiva-Parvati are remarkably noteworthy.\n\nThe Uniara substyle is also revealed through the 'manuscripts' and miniature paintings. The Bhagwad Puran, Ramayan and a number of 'miniatures' from the personal collection of Rao Raja Rajendra Singh are very important from the point of view of art. In the personal collection of Kumar Sangram Singh lots of 'miniatures' are available among which the paintings of Zanani and Mardani Mehfil (Men and Ladies' Concerts) are worthy of special mention. Some paintings can also be sighted in the National Museum, New Delhi.\n\nOn the basis of the achievements of above wall-paintings, 'manuscripts' and 'miniatures', the Uniara substyle has acquired a distinct form in which a new tradition of painting emerged from an amalgamation of two styles. The Uniara Thikana following the Kushwaha cultural tradition was under the domain of Jaipur state, and as such the Uniara substyle bears the stamp of total impact of Jaipur style in terms of structure, colour-scheme, and dresses etc.\n\nA number of Jaipur painters have also contributed to this style. On account of the geographical proximity, located near Bundi as it is, and also due to the marriage of the daughter of Rao Raja Sardar Singh with Bundi King Dalel Singh, the Bundi painters had a chance to visit Uniara, and as such the total influence of Bundi style is marked on the architecture, natural-setting, face-structure and the decoration of these paintings.\n\nIn view of the Nagar and Uniara wall-paintings, there is a great scope for further work on this substyle.\n\nShekhawati Style\n\nStudies of painting have also brought the Shekhawati region into the limelight. Traditional drawings of frescoes in the Amber and Bairath styles and paintings created in palaces, temples and particularly in the havelis of Jaipur influenced the Shekhawati region, and the haveli style of painting, music, architecture engulfed it.\n\nIn the 15th century Shekhaji, grandson of Mokulji, earned a great reputation for being a brave man, as great in the art of war as in imparting justice, who had set up an independent kingdom which acquired much fame as Shekhawati state. This territory is an integral part of the Rajasthan desert and is recognised as the confluence of wealth, education and art. Known as Marukan tar in the Ramayana and Mahabharata ages, this territory, engulfed within the boundaries of Matsya Pradesh, should be treated as lying within the campus of the Dhundar school.\n\nIn ancient days, this part of the land being surrounded by dangerous and dense forests and rich in deposits of copper was a great centre of culture. Recent archaeological excavations at Ganeshwar, ten kilometres from Neem-ka-Thana, revealed thousands of spikes of arrows, pointed edges of spears, ornaments, fish hooks and axes belonging to the copper age. A civilisation 5,000 years old has been discovered and proves beyond doubt that the copper used in the Harappan and Mohenjodaro and Indus Valley civilisations was procured only from this site. So old and abundant were these prehistoric utensils made of copper that they were not available else-where in the world.\"\n\nThe Ganeshwar civilisation would undoubtedly herald a new era in the annals of archaeology. Remnants of the Mahabharata and Ramayana and Bodh ages are sometimes discovered in Shekhawati. The influence of the art of Gurjara-l'ratiharas spread in wide areas of Shekhawati. Many spots like Jodhpura, Sunari, Harsh Nath, Shakambari remained as great centres of art and culture.\n\nBut the decline of painting in the Shekhawati region should be considered from the point of view of construction of havelis. After the establishment of British rule in Rajasthan capitalists of this area expanded their horizons of commercial activity. They entered into partnership with the British in trade and by dint of their initiative and unlimited boldness and with their jugs and ropes migrated to Bombay and Calcutta.\n\nShekhawati merged with various commercial centres in the early part of the 19th century and due to the exodus of traders to pursue their business activities else-where this territory became the cradle of the goddess Lakshmi. Hence the Birlas of Pilani, Poddars of Nawalgarh, Bangurs of Baggar, Ruias of Ramgarh and Dalmia, Bajaj, Jaipuria occupied significant positions in the Indian economy. They constructed large havelis, temples and cenotaphs in their towns and had them deco-rated by artists. The art galleries of haveis and their internal and external perspectives were adorned with attractive paintings.\n\nAs painting in havelis is a growth of the 19th century, it has been greatly influenced by folk art and the Company style. With the advent of the British, faster means of communication, new lifestyle, and development of new inventions, these wealthy traders painted their havelis on the British pattern. The cultural impact of the 19th century could well be studied in the Shekhawati style.\n\nThese havelis of seths laid out in vast areas were built on the principle of Bharatiya Shilpa-Shastra. Great scope exists to undertake the study of those located at Nawalgarh, Fatehpur, Laxmangarh, Mukundgarh, Churu, Sardar Sehar, Ramgarh from the point of view of artistic values and architectural principles. These were decorated with artistic wooden doors and gavaksh doors, and their front walls were adorned with paintings influenced by the Rajput and Company styles.\n\nInteriors of havelis were painted as far as possible. In some havelis art galleries were established with engraved mirrors and gold polish.\" Entrance gates were decorated artistically. In the above-mentioned towns paintings expressing the moods of Radha-Krishna are abundantly visible in temples. Cenotaphs located at Reengus, Ramgarh, Bissau, Choori Ajitgarh were elaborately painted in an advanced stage of the Amber style.\n\nThere is not a single town in Shekhawati where havelis and temples have not been decorated with paintings. From the point of view of impact of painting, Shekhawati may be classified in three parts:\n\n1. Region adjoining Jaipur: frescoes at Chommu, Samod, Reengus. Srimadhopur, Ajitgarh are greatly influenced by the Jaipur style. Their themes and colouring tend to be very close to that style.\n\n2. Styles of paintings at Patan, Ganeshwar, Chhapoli, Khetri and many towns of Jhunjhunu were greatly influenced by the folk art of Haryana.\n\n3. Effect of the Marwar school was very great at Nagore, towards Bikaner and towns located in the western part of Sikar. But even after this traditional impact the Shekhawati style appears to maintain its own characteristics.\n\nSalient Features\n\n1. Drawings of elephants and horses and guards were made in bold relief in the brackets of havelis.\n\n2. Drawings of gods and goddesses were painted in sharp outlines on gavaksh and main gates.\n\n3. Below projections, in spaces between todas artists skilfully painted themes like wrestling, churning, godohan, dhola-maru, nayika engaged in shringar, curious animals, birds, divine manifestations, demons, kant-kala, love, rag-ragini, barah-masa, saints and ascetics, folklore.\n\n4. The exterior and interior walls of many havelis are covered with pictures showing the impact of the Company style and of industrialisation. Railway trains, motor vehicles, bicycles, sewing machines, aeroplanes, sofa sets and other articles belonging to the Victorian age may be seen. The impact of British rule brought great changes in manner of eating, style of dressing, way of living, which have been well depicted in these paintings.\n\nAreas of Shekhawati like Sahapura, Ajitgarh, Patan, Khetri, Bissau, Pilani, Chirawa, Nawalgarh, Ramgarh, Baggar, Sikar, Reengus, Chommu, Samod, too could prove useful within limits for a special study of artistic growth.\n\nAlwar Style\n\nAs a study of the Alwar style has never been undertaken, it has not come into the limelight. Occasional references have however been made to it by connoisseurs of art from time to time. In regard to painting, examination of available materials (frescoes), manuscripts, miniatures, plates of ivory, mica and wood reveal a style of painting no less impressive than other styles of Rajasthan.' Examples of this style are preserved in many museums, temples, palaces and in private collections yet to be researched.\n\nLike other styles, the origin of this style is presumed to have taken place after the establishment of Alwar state. Rao Raja Pratap Singh (1756-1790), by his bravery, intelligent statesmanship and political ability created an independent kingdom after conquering parts of Bharatpur and Jaipur.' In 1770, after having laid out Rajgarh on a new pattern, he constructed a strong fortress there and made it his capital. About this time two artists named Dhalu Ram and Shiv Kumar migrated to Alwar from Jaipur.\" They presented some of their artistic work to the maharaja. Shiv Kumar is believed to have-returned to Jaipur but Dhalu Ram was appointed in charge of the state museum, which contained the private collection of pictures of the royal family.\n\nDhalu Ram was skilled in drawing frescoes. The beautiful frescoes in the Sheesh Mahal of Rajgarh fort were probably painted under his supervision. If we admit this view, these frescoes may be presumed to be the best specimens of the early stage of the Alvvar style.\n\nAbout 30 kilometres from Alwar at Rajgarh, a beautiful palace of glass is located on the upper portion of the fortress. Paintings on perforated screens and lower walls deserve high praise. This Sheesh Mahal is located in two parts, a big hall about 25 feet by 12 feet and a verandah 25 feet by ten feet adjoining it from the north.\n\nThe ceiling of the hall is studded with glass of different colours, and white glass is engraved on the walls. At occasional spaces, many paintings were executed while the walls below the perforated screens are decorated with the foliage of trees.\n\nThe frescoes of this palace show a variety of themes, including paintings relating to Krishna-Chant, Ram-Chant, nayikas, the royal court, music which may be presumed to be early developments of the Alwar style. Paintings concerned Ram Lila, Goverdhan Dharan, Gocha ran, Hindola, Veni-gunthan, churning of milk and Ram's valour.\n\nRaj Tilak and other artists are concerned with Krishna and Ram Lila. Among them, drawings of cows and seven coloured drawings deserve close attention. The drawings of Dhanush Bhang and Raj Tilak possess large dimensions, and elephant and horse riding revive memories of Ajanta.\n\nDrawings of yawning nayikas removing a thorn, nayikas and maidservants engaged in beautification, are very pleasant. Paintings of women playing the tabla, sitar and sarangi are less pleasing. Scenes of the royal courts of Maharaja Pratap Singh and Bhaktawar Singh are painted on the walls. Blending of colours in various designs of foliage and the rhythm of the drawings are very impressive. Lines are very sharp and bold in relief.\n\nThe whole job was probably executed by an artist of great merit like Dhalu Ram. In the Sheesh Mahal of Rajgarh fort, the effect of the almond colour of the Ajanta style is very evident. Light green, blue and gold used in these paintings are impressive.\n\nSheesh Mahal was constructed around the period of Rao Raja Bhaktawar Singh (1790-1814) son of Rao Raja Pratap Singh. Bhaktawar Singh himself was a poet and keen lover of poetry. It is a sad reality that most of these paintings have started to deteriorate in the absence of patronage.\n\nBhaktawar Singh composed poetry under the names Chandra-Sakhi and Bhaktesh. Dan Lila is a very significant text he compiled. Having heard praise of Rao Raja's patronage of the arts, many artists from distant states came to Alwar, where their talents were suitably rewarded. In their period Alwar flourished culturally. Baldev Salga and Salig Ram were leading artists of the state.\n\nHundreds of paintings belonging to the time of Bhaktawar Singh are preserved in the State Museum, Alwar, which are worth seeing. Among them are pictures depicting the maharaja himself engrossed in religious conversation with naths and jogis, ascetics living in dense forests. They deserve special appreciation from the artistic point of view. Most of the paintings preserved in the museum belong to Bhaktawar Singh.\n\nAfter Rao Raja Bhaktawar Singh, for having given a new direction to the Alwar style the credit goes to his successors Maharaja Vinay Singh (1814-1857) and Raja Balwant Singh (1826-1845) of Tijara. In their period the style reached its zenith.\n\nVinay Singh earned a big reputation among kings of Alwar for his keen love of art. He contributed towards the development of the Alwar style as much as Akbar did for the Mughal school.\n\nHearing he was a connoisseur of art and virtuous, many artists, architects, scientists and musicians thronged to his court to emulate his example. It was in this period of Bahadur Shah (1806-1837) and Bahadur Shah III (1837-1859) that the Mughal Empire with its capital Delhi began to shrink in size and disintegrate politically.\n\nMaharajas Vinay Singh and Balwant Singh were great connoisseurs of art and enriched their museum after purchasing artistic items. They organised a big library after procuring many pictorial texts. Rare games and unique arms were procured to enrich their collections of jewellery and armouries, and having provided royal patronage to artists they gave a dynamic thrust to the art of painting. They had a golden opportunity to display their artistic talents in the reign of Vinay Singh. He had learnt this art from Baldev, who occupied a high position at the royal court. He had originally worked in the traditional Alwar style. Later, he produced beautiful paintings strongly influenced by the Mughal school.\n\nMaharaja Vinay Singh was keenly interested in getting pictorial texts painted as well as scrolls of script paintings. Because of this he invited Gulamali, a seasoned artist, Aga Mirza of Delhi, a great calligrapher, and Nathha Shah Dervesh, a highly skilled bookbinder also of Delhi. Calligraphy and painting texts like the Ramayan, Mahabharat, Srimad Bhagwad Gita, Geet-Govind, Durga-Saptashati, Gulistan, Koran unmistakably reflect the keen devotion of Vinay Singh to artistic activities. Calligraphy and drawing of Gulistan were a unique feature of his reign. Creation of this text cost Rs. 1 lakh. Pictures of the text were drawn by Baldev and Gulamali. All the calligraphy of this work was formed with a pen made of sect ha. If a mistake appeared on any page the whole page was done all over again.\n\nMany sets of paintings of rag-ragini in the Alwar style are still available. Most of them had been painted during his period. A set of barah masa based upon verses of an unknown poet Anand Ram belongs to this time.\n\nKhawaswal queen, Moosi Maharani of Rao Raja Bhaktawar Singh had per-formed the rite of Satti alongwith Rao Raja having left her son. Her son Balwant Singh had created trouble to secure the throne himself. To avert armed conflict the northern part of the state was handed over to Balwant Singh in 1826. He had made Tijara his capital but died without issue in 1845. Tijara was thus merged with Alwar state again.\n\nIn his reign of 23 years he devoted himself to the pursuit of artistic values, and his great contribution in this regard is a memorable event in India's cultural history. He was a king keenly devoted to promoting the arts. At his royal court artists like Salig Ram, Jamuna Dass, Chhote La!, Baksa Ram and Nand Ram had painted pictorial texts, scrolls and miniatures extensively. Paintings by Jamuna Dass up to 1844 are available, and the names of Raja Balwant Singh and the artists who worked on these pieces are inscribed on them.\n\nThe paintings of Jamuna Dass, with their bold relief in line and soft, tender colour schemes are worth seeing. Paintings with the name of Baksa Ram belonging to this period are preserved in the state museums and in private collections of Maharajkumar Yashwant Singh of Alwar's family.\n\nAfter the merger of Tijara, the artistic heritage and artists moved to Alwar. Vinay Singh and Balwant Singh enriched their museum there after buying works of art from the royal treasury and library of the Mughals. Historic pictures of Mughal emperors, books, a Shahi album, sets of miniatures, weapons, dresses and equipment studded with precious stones are regarded as the proud heritage of the museum which would shed new light on the history of the Mughals.\n\nDiwanji ka Rang Mahal, built in the reign of Vinay Singh (1830) deserves careful study for its frescoes. In the tradition of frescoes in the Alwar style it is another significant specimen. The forefathers of Bal Mukund held the position of diwan of Alwar state from time to time and Bal Mukund (1783-1855) held it under Maharaja Bhaktawar Singh. He had also served as diwan to Vinay Singh. Brave and benevolent, he was also highly religious and a keen lover of art.\n\nA manuscript was compiled by his grandson about the haveli and Sheesh Mahal around 1836-37. Diwan Bal Mukund had the havell constructed at the well of Munshi Bagh for his residential purposes. Very large, it is also sturdily built. Its gate is located in the west. A passage near this door leads to the Sheesh Mahal situated on the upper portion, in which gold workmanship of high quality and engraving of mirrors in various patterns and in different shades of colours had been performed.\n\nThis Sheesh Mahal was also constructed on the same plan as that of Rajgarh. A big room and a verandah in a northerly direction deserve admiration for architectural beauty. The walls of the room are studded with chips of white glass with paintings on a rectangular panel between the ceiling and the wall decorated with paintings depicting 24 incarnations, their six rag-raginis and various musical modes.\n\nOn the wall, attractive murals depicting Goverdhan-Dharan, Veni-Gunthan,, Hindola, Raj Tilak and mehfil have been painted. Paintings of nayikas and doorkeepers are also very pleasant to look at. From the point of recalling a sentimental experience the frescoes of the Alwar style are unique. Well preserved, their condition is better than those of Rajgarh, but on the whole the lines of this Rang Mahal and the application of colours do not display the kind of charm noticeable in the Sheesh Mahal of Rajgarh.\n\nThis Rang Mahal, built in the period of Vinay Singh (1814-1857) amid the old havelis of Alwar, still reminds of the glories of old. The construction of many temples and palaces and the workmanship of foliages in various shades of colour make us understand the Alwar style.\n\nThe Sheesh Mahal of the Raj Mahal at Alwar is in a dilapidated state. Built in the last days of Vinay Singh, in the midst of mahal paintings of Shiv-Parvati and Ganesh drawn in a big room, they do not pay such attention to detail.\n\nThese paintings depict clearly the impact of photography. In the adjoining room, miniatures painted on paper were pasted on the wall and covered with glass, but such types of frescoes could not be regarded as belonging to the traditions of fresco painting though such experiments could be noticed in many other palaces of Rajasthan.\n\nAfter Vinay Singh the period of Sawai Shiv Dan Singh is no less significant from the point of view of painting. He was learned in Persian and Hindi and had a special love for painting and music. His artistic tastes were well suited to his luxury-loving temperament. Hundreds of erotic paintings based upon Kam-kala and drawn in his time are good artistically.\n\nBeing very fond of music, his court was crowded with saniras and dancing girls. Hundreds of such paintings depicting these gayikas are still available in private collections of the royal family, which show the effect of the Company's style besides that of photography.\n\nIn his time, an era of deterioration began in the Alwar style. With the Western impact the photograph began to receive greater prominence and the poetical beauty, sharpness of colour and bold relief in line and drawings of purdahs began to lose ground slowly.\n\nMaharaja Mangal Singh, unlike his ancestors, had no love for the line Budha Ram, Udai Ram, Moo! Chand, Jagan Nath, Ram Gopal, Bishen Lal continued to maintain in the Alwar tradition of painting.\n\nBudha Ram had mastered the art of drawing animals and birds. He held the position of daroga of the Sheesh Mahal of Rajgarh and the museum of Alwar. Mool Chand acquired expertise in painting ivory pieces. Many paintings drawn on pieces of ivory are a unique feature of the Alwar style.\n\nThe traditions of painting frescoes also flourished in temples and cenotaphs in Rajasthan. Alwar had not lagged behind in the art of frescoes. In temples built by the mother of Mangal Singh at Thana and Bhurassidih many paintings had been executed. But these paintings being of later dates are not so artistic. In the temples of Raj Mahal some scattered paintings are still available although they almost vanished in the absence of official protection. In the temple of Lacidu Khavasji glass was fixed over paintings made on paper on walls.\n\nThe frescoes drawn on cenotaphs belonging to Hanuvant Singh of Thana, Khavasji-ka-Bagh of Rajgarh, and the garden of Macchedi and on Tal Briksh, although time-worn exhibit glimpses of grandeur even today. Among them, a large number of paintings depicting the lilas of Ram and Krishna and scenes of the royal court and state processions were drawn. Certainly, the art of these cenotaphs had greatly influenced folk art. The effect of folk art is more pronounced in the arrangement of lines and choice of colours.\n\nExamination of the frescoes of the Alwar style shows that the style of painting developed there had flowed in dual waves, one in engraving frescoes, and the other into pictorial texts and miniatures.\n\nIn the reign of Jai Singh, former Maharaja of Alwar, architecture, music and painting flourished. A large portrait of his shows a scene of one of his processions and deserves special mention. Ram Shaya Nepalia, who painted this picture, should be remembered. In the history of Rajasthani art, the contribution of artistslike Ram Gopal, Ram Prasad, Jag Mohan and Onkar Nath is no less significant.\n\nSubject\n\nAs remarked earlier, the Alwar style attained diversity in regard to theme. In the royal courts of Rajputs,. mehfils, Krishna-Lila, Ram Lila, religious conversation with saints and ascetics in natural surroundings, rag-raginis had been extensively painted. Vinay Singh and Balwant Singh had specially got them painted like rag-ragini, barah-masa and pictorial texts in Hindi and Sanskrit which included the Mahabharat, Geeta, Ramayan, Shiv Kavacch, Durga-Saptashati, Geet-Govind, Kali Sahasra-Nama and Mahiman Stotra. Because of the contact with Muslim artists and feudal lords from the Mughal court, the Alwar style of painting was more influenced by the Mughal school and its themes in place of Rajput grandeur.\n\nAccording to the selection of themes the third phase began from the time of Maharaja Shiv Dan Singh (1857). Because of the impact of photography portraits of individuals were made in large numbers. Hundreds of paintings concerning Ganikas and Kam-Shastra are still available. Yogasan was also treated as an important theme of the Alwar style. In this way the tendency towards painting individuals increased against drawing groups.\n\nSalient Features\n\nIn early paintings, till the period of Bhaktawar Singh, all the salient features of Rajasthani painting are clearly noted in the Alwar style. Hence it becomes rather difficult to dissociate them from the Jaipur style. But still the effect of natural beauty, the way of living and physical characteristics of the state are clearly discernible in such paintings. These paintings, endowed with lyrical sentiment and folk art, appeal in line and colour.\n\nIn its most significant days a balanced coordination of the Rajasthani (particularly Jaipur) style and Mughal and Persian schools is clearly visible. Because of this coordination a separate identity could be given to the Alwar style. Figures of males were drawn like the mango or some curve was provided to the chin. Their stature is slightly short with raised bons, their limbs were drawn with great pains, and these represent salient features of the Alwar style.\n\nThe local effect is seen in the tie-and-dye work of the turbans. The impact of Rajput and Mughal styles upon the dress of male and female is largely evident. The natural perspective of Alwar may be viewed in paintings of this style with drawings of forests, gardens, ku"
