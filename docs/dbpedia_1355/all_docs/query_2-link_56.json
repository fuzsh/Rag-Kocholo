        "text": "A list of all the best black comedy movies ever made, many of which are streaming on Netflix and Amazon Prime. Find those and more comedies on the Comedies on Netflix Instant and Amazon Prime lists.\n\nThis black comedy movie list can be sorted by cast, year, director, and more. This list of black comedy films also contains black comedy movie titles that can be clicked on for more information about the film. This black comedy films list can also be copied to start your own.\n\nSome of the best black comedies are some of the most popular movies of all time. Many of these movies are lauded and critically acclaimed. They also feature some of the biggest stars to grace the silver screen.\n\nPlenty of well-known directors have been associated with Black comedy films, including Charlie Chaplin and Martin Scorsese.\n\nRanked by\n\nJohn Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman\n\nReleased : 1994\n\nDirected by : Quentin Tarantino\n\nPulp Fiction, a quintessential Quentin Tarantino piece, is a genre-defying blend of crime, drama, and black comedy. The film intricately weaves the lives of two hitmen - Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson), with a washed-up boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis), and a mob boss's wife Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman). Punctuated by Tarantino's signature non-linear storytelling, the movie explores themes of redemption and consequences. It bagged the prestigious Palme d'Or at Cannes in 1994, testifying to its cinematic brilliance.\n\nBrad Pitt, Ed Norton, Helena Bonham Carter\n\nReleased : 1999\n\nDirected by : David Fincher\n\nIn the gritty urban drama Fight Club, Edward Norton (the unnamed protagonist) finds himself spiraling into the underbelly of his own psyche. Stuck in a monotonous job, he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a soap salesman with an unconventional philosophy. Together, they form an underground fight club as a radical form of psychotherapy. As their nocturnal activities escalate, so does their bond. But when Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), a fellow support group crasher, enters their lives, things start to unravel. Directed by David Fincher, Fight Club is a jarring exploration of masculinity and identity that won't soon be forgotten.\n\nMalcolm McDowell, Patrick Magee, Michael Bates\n\nReleased : 1971\n\nDirected by : Stanley Kubrick\n\nIn Stanley Kubrick's unsettling masterpiece, A Clockwork Orange, we follow the story of Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell), a charismatic yet sociopathic delinquent living in dystopian Britain. The film, steeped in satire and black comedy, explores themes of morality, free will, and societal reconditioning. Alex leads his gang of 'droogs' on a rampage of violent escapades before he is captured by the authorities. His subsequent rehabilitation through experimental psychological conditioning forms the crux of this controversial narrative. Notably, it was nominated for Best Picture at the 44th Academy Awards in 1972.\n\nFrances McDormand, Steve Buscemi, William H. Macy\n\nReleased : 1996\n\nDirected by : Joel Coen\n\n\"Fargo\" is a reality-based crime drama set in Minnesota in 1987. Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) is a car salesman in Minneapolis who has gotten himself into debt and is so desperate for money that he hires two thugs (Steve Buscemi), (Peter Stormare) to kidnap his own wife. Jerry will collect the ransom from her wealthy father (Harve Presnell), paying the thugs a small portion and keeping the rest to satisfy his debts. The scheme collapses when the thugs shoot a state trooper.\n\nSimon Pegg, Kate Ashfield, Lucy Davis\n\nReleased : 2004\n\nDirected by : Edgar Wright\n\nShaun of the Dead is a British horror-comedy film, where Shaun (Simon Pegg) plays an ordinary salesman whose life spirals into zombie-infested chaos. His best friend, Ed (Nick Frost), joins him in this unexpected journey. The duo's lackadaisical attitude towards the undead apocalypse creates a unique blend of horror and humor, making it a standout in its genre. Directed by Edgar Wright, the movie received critical acclaim upon release for its clever script and memorable performances. It's not just about surviving zombies; it's also about rekindling relationships and seizing control of one's life amidst all the madness.\n\nBruce Campbell, Embeth Davidtz, Marcus Gilbert\n\nReleased : 1992\n\nDirected by : Sam Raimi\n\n3rd Evil Dead movie. Ash (Bruce Campbell) finds himself trapped in medieval times. He must quest for the Necronomicon, a book of evil which can return him to his time. Unfortunately, he releases the evil trapped inside the book and unleashes an army of the dead."
