Vaccines against DENV are currently unavailable. DEAD-box RNA helicases (DDXs) have been reported to participate in viral replication and host innate immune response. In the present study, we analyzed the role of 40 DDX proteins during DENV replication. Among these proteins, DDX3X showed antiviral effect against DENV infection. Viral replication significantly increased in DDX3X-silenced cells compared with the controls. The interferon (IFN)-Î² transcription level decreased during the early stage of DENV infection in DDX3X-silenced cells compared with that in the controls. DDX3X could stimulate IFN-Î² transcription through the IRF3 and the NFÎºB branches in DENV-infected cells. Our data imply that DDX3X, a member of DEAD-box RNA helicase, is necessary for IFN production and could inhibit DENV replication. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We identified an RNA helicase gene, DDX3 (DDX3X), which is overexpressed in prostate cancers, and whose expression is directly correlated with high Gleason scores. Knockdown of DDX3 in the aggressive prostate cancer cell lines DU145 and 22Rv1 resulted in significantly reduced clonogenicity. To target DDX3, we rationally designed a small molecule, RK-33, which docks into the ATP-binding domain of DDX3. Functional studies indicated that RK-33 preferentially bound to DDX3 and perturbed its activity. RK-33 treatment of prostate cancer cell lines DU145, 22Rv1, and LNCaP (which have high DDX3 levels) decreased proliferation and induced a G1 phase cell-cycle arrest. Conversely, the low DDX3âexpressing cell line, PC3, exhibited few changes following RK-33 treatment. Importantly, combination studies using RK-33 and radiation exhibited synergistic effects both in vitro and in a xenograft model of prostate cancer demonstrating the role of RK-33 as a radiosensitizer. Taken together, these results indicate that blocking DDX3 by RK-33 in combination with radiation treatment is a viable option for treating locally advanced prostate cancer.

Here, we demonstrate that DDX3X plays an oncogenic role in breast cancer cells by modulating the cell cycle. Depletion of DDX3X in MCF7 cells slows cell proliferation by inducing a G1 phase arrest. Notably, DDX3X inhibits expression of Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), a transcription factor and cell cycle repressor. Moreover, DDX3X directly interacts with KLF4 mRNA and regulates its splicing. We show that DDX3X-mediated repression of KLF4 promotes expression of S-phase inducing genes in MCF7 breast cancer cells. These findings provide evidence for a novel function of DDX3X in regulating expression and downstream functions of KLF4, a master negative regulator of the cell cycle.

Here, we describe a novel function for DDX3 in regulating the mitochondrial stress response in the parasitic protozoan Leishmania. We show that genetic inactivation of DDX3 leads to the accumulation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) associated with a defect in hydrogen peroxide detoxification. Upon stress, ROS production is greatly enhanced, causing mitochondrial membrane potential loss, mitochondrial fragmentation, and cell death. Importantly, this phenotype is exacerbated upon oxidative stress in parasites forced to use the mitochondrial oxidative respiratory machinery. Furthermore, we show that in the absence of DDX3, levels of major components of the unfolded protein response as well as of polyubiquitinated proteins increase in the parasite, particularly in the mitochondrion, as an indicator of mitochondrial protein damage. Consistent with these findings, immunoprecipitation and mass-spectrometry studies revealed potential interactions of DDX3 with key components of the cellular stress response, particularly the antioxidant response, the unfolded protein response, and the AAA-ATPase p97/VCP/Cdc48, which is essential in mitochondrial protein quality control by driving proteosomal degradation of polyubiquitinated proteins. Complementation studies using DDX3 deletion mutants lacking conserved motifs within the helicase core support that binding of DDX3 to ATP is essential for DDX3's function in mitochondrial proteostasis. As a result of the inability of DDX3-depleted Leishmania to recover from ROS damage and to survive various stresses in the host macrophage, parasite intracellular development was impaired. Collectively, these observations support a central role for the Leishmania DDX3 homolog in preventing ROS-mediated damage and in maintaining mitochondrial protein quality control.

In humans, this process is known to be facilitated by the DEAD-box helicases p68 (DDX5) and p72 (DDX17). In this study, we performed a candidate-based RNAi screen in C. elegans to identify DEAD/H-box proteins involved in miRNA biogenesis. In a let-7(mg279) sensitized genetic background, knockdown of a homolog of yeast splicing factor Prp28p, DDX-23, or a homolog of human helicases p68 and p72, DDX-17, enhanced let-7 loss-of-function phenotypes, suggesting that these helicases play a role in let-7 processing and/or function. In both ddx-23(RNAi) and ddx-17(RNAi), levels of mature let-7 were decreased while pri-let-7 was found to accumulate, indicating that the helicases likely act at the level of pri-let-7 processing. DDX-23 and DDX-17 were also required for the biogenesis of other known heterochronic miRNAs, including lin-4 and the let-7 family members miR-48, miR-84 and miR-241. Their function was not confined to the heterochronic pathway, however, since they were both necessary for down-regulation of cog-1 by the spatial patterning miRNA, lsy-6. Here, we present a novel function for C. elegans DDX-23 in pri-miRNA processing, and also suggest a conserved role for DDX-17 in this process. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, the regulatory mechanism that governs the biogenesis of miR-21 in glioma is still unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the DEAD-box RNA helicase, DDX23, promotes miR-21 biogenesis at the post-transcriptional level. The expression of DDX23 was enhanced in glioma tissues compared to normal brain, and expression level of DDX23 was highly associated with poor survival of glioma patients. Specific knockdown of DDX23 expression suppressed glioma cell proliferation and invasion in vitro and in vivo, which is similar to the function of miR-21. We found that DDX23 increased the level of miR-21 by promoting primary-to-precursor processing of miR-21 through an interaction with the Drosha microprocessor. Mutagenesis experiments critically demonstrated that the helicase activity of DDX23 was essential for the processing (cropping) of miR-21, and we further found that ivermectin, a RNA helicase inhibitor, decreased miR-21 levels by potentially inhibiting DDX23 activity and blocked invasion and cell proliferation. Moreover, treatment of ivermectin decreased glioma growth in mouse xenografts. Taken together, these results suggest that DDX23 plays an essential role in glioma progression, and might thus be a potential novel target for the therapeutic treatment of glioma.

To elucidate the function of NOP132 in the nucleolus, we identified proteins that interact with NOP132 using mass spectrometric methods. NOP132 associated mainly with proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis and RNA metabolism, including the DEAD-box RNA helicase protein, DDX47, whose yeast homolog is Rrp3, which has roles in pre-rRNA processing. Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged DDX47 co-precipitated rRNA precursors, as well as a number of proteins that are probably involved in ribosome biogenesis, implying that DDX47 plays a role in pre-rRNA processing. Introduction of NOP132 small interfering RNAs induced a ring-like localization of DDX47 in the nucleolus, suggesting that NOP132 is required for the appropriate localization of DDX47 within the nucleolus. We propose that NOP132 functions in the recruitment of pre-rRNA processing proteins, including DDX47, to the region where rRNA is transcribed within the nucleolus.

Disturbance of these processes leads to accumulation of aberrant DNA:RNA hybrids (R-loops) that, if unresolved, generate DNA damage and genomic instability. Here we report a novel, unexpected role for the nucleopore-associated mRNA export factor Ddx19 in removing nuclear R-loops formed upon replication stress or DNA damage. We show, in live cells, that Ddx19 transiently relocalizes from the nucleopore to the nucleus upon DNA damage, in an ATR/Chk1-dependent manner, and that Ddx19 nuclear relocalization is required to clear R-loops. Ddx19 depletion induces R-loop accumulation, proliferation-dependent DNA damage and defects in replication fork progression. Further, we show that Ddx19 resolves R-loops inÂ vitro via its helicase activity. Furthermore, mutation of a residue phosphorylated by Chk1 in Ddx19 disrupts its interaction with Nup214 and allows its nuclear relocalization. Finally, we show that Ddx19 operates in resolving R-loops independently of the RNA helicase senataxin. Altogether these observations put forward a novel, ATR-dependent function for Ddx19 in R-loop metabolism to preserve genome integrity in mammalian cells.

The function and mechanism of action of most of these helicases in animal development and human disease remain largely unexplored. In a zebrafish mutagenesis screen to identify genes essential for heart development we identified a mutant that disrupts the gene encoding the RNA helicase DEAD-boxÂ 39ab ( ddx39ab ). Homozygous ddx39ab mutant embryos exhibit profound cardiac and trunk muscle dystrophy, along with lens abnormalities, caused by abrupt terminal differentiation of cardiomyocyte, myoblast and lens fiber cells. Loss of ddx39ab hindered splicing of mRNAs encoding epigenetic regulatory factors, including members of the KMT2 gene family, leading to misregulation of structural gene expression in cardiomyocyte, myoblast and lens fiber cells. Taken together, these results show that Ddx39ab plays an essential role in establishment of the proper epigenetic status during differentiation of multiple cell lineages. Â© 2018.

Applying a mass spectrometric analysis, we identified the DEAD-box helicase DDX27 as stably associated factor of the PeBoW-complex. DDX27 interacts with the PeBoW-complex via an evolutionary conserved FÃF motif in the N-terminal domain and is recruited to the nucleolus via its basic C-terminal domain. This recruitment is RNA-dependent and occurs independently of the PeBoW-complex. Interestingly, knockdown of DDX27, but not of Pes1, induces the accumulation of an extendedmoreÂ Â» form of the primary 47S rRNA. We conclude that DDX27 can interact specifically with the Pes1 and Bop1 but fulfils critical function(s) for proper 3â² end formation of 47S rRNA independently of the PeBoW-complex. - Highlights: â¢ DEAD-box helicase DDX27 is a new constituent of the PeBoW-complex. â¢ The N-terminal FÃF motif of DDX27 interacts with the PeBoW components Pes1 and Bop1. â¢ Nucleolar anchoring of DDX27 via its basic C-terminal domain is RNA dependent. â¢ Knockdown of DDX27 induces a specific defect in 3â² end formation of 47S rRNA.Â«Â less\n\nThe RNA helicase DDX17 controls the transcriptional activity of REST and the expression of proneural microRNAs in neuronal differentiation.\n\nPubMed\n\nLambert, Marie-Pierre; Terrone, Sophie; Giraud, Guillaume; Benoit-Pilven, Clara; Cluet, David; Combaret, ValÃ©rie; Mortreux, Franck; Auboeuf, Didier; Bourgeois, Cyril F\n\n2018-06-21\n\nThe Repressor Element 1-silencing transcription factor (REST) represses a number of neuronal genes in non-neuronal cells or in undifferentiated neural progenitors. Here, we report that the DEAD box RNA helicase DDX17 controls important REST-related processes that are critical during the early phases of neuronal differentiation. First, DDX17 associates with REST, promotes its binding to the promoter of a subset of REST-targeted genes and co-regulates REST transcriptional repression activity. During neuronal differentiation, we observed a downregulation of DDX17 along with that of the REST complex that contributes to the activation of neuronal genes. Second, DDX17 and its paralog DDX5 regulate the expression of several proneural microRNAs that are known to target the REST complex during neurogenesis, including miR-26a/b that are also direct regulators of DDX17 expression. In this context, we propose a new mechanism by which RNA helicases can control the biogenesis of intronic miRNAs. We show that the processing of the miR-26a2 precursor is dependent on RNA helicases, owing to an intronic regulatory region that negatively impacts on both miRNA processing and splicing of its host intron. Our work places DDX17 in the heart of a pathway involving REST and miRNAs that allows neuronal gene repression.\n\nCellular DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX6 modulates interaction of miR-122 with the 5' untranslated region of hepatitis C virus RNA.\n\nPubMed\n\nBiegel, Jason M; Henderson, Eric; Cox, Erica M; Bonenfant, Gaston; Netzband, Rachel; Kahn, Samantha; Eager, Rachel; Pager, Cara T\n\n2017-07-01\n\nHepatitis C virus (HCV) subverts the cellular DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX6 to promote virus infection. Using polysome gradient analysis and the subgenomic HCV Renilla reporter replicon genome, we determined that DDX6 does not affect HCV translation. Rather expression of the subgenomic HCV Renilla luciferase reporter at late times, as well as labeling of newly synthesized viral RNA with 4-thiouridine showed that DDX6 modulates replication. Because DDX6 is an effector protein of the microRNA pathway, we also investigated its role in miR-122-directed HCV gene expression. Similar to sequestering miR-122, depletion of DDX6 modulated HCV RNA stability. Interestingly, miR-122-HCV RNA interaction assays with mutant HCV genomes sites and compensatory exogenous miR-122 showed that DDX6 affects the function of miR-122 at one particular binding site. We propose that DDX6 facilitates the miR-122 interaction with HCV 5' UTR, which is necessary for stabilizing the viral genome and the switch between translation and replication.

Here we focused on the interplay between IAV and DExD-box RNA helicases (DDX), which play a key role in cellular RNA metabolism by remodeling RNA-RNA or RNA-protein complexes. We performed a targeted RNAi screen on 35 human DDX proteins to identify those involved in IAV life cycle. DDX19 was a major hit. In DDX19-depleted cells the accumulation of viral RNAs and proteins was delayed, and the production of infectious IAV particles was strongly reduced. We show that DDX19 associates with intronless, unspliced and spliced IAV mRNAs and promotes their nuclear export. In addition, we demonstrate an RNA-independent association between DDX19 and the viral polymerase, that is modulated by the ATPase activity of DDX19. Our results provide a model in which DDX19 is recruited to viral mRNAs in the nucleus of infected cells to enhance their nuclear export. Information gained from this virus-host interaction improves the understanding of both the IAV replication cycle and the cellular function of DDX19.

Here, we report an integrative biology study of DDX5 in breast cancer, encompassing quantitative proteomics, global MicroRNA profiling, and detailed biochemical characterization of cell lines and human tissues. We showed that protein expression of DDX5 increased progressively from the luminal to basal breast cancer cell lines, and correlated positively with that of CD44 in the basal subtypes. Through immunohistochemistry analyses of tissue microarrays containing over 200 invasive human ductal carcinomas, we observedmoreÂ Â» that DDX5 was upregulated in the majority of malignant tissues, and its expression correlated strongly with those of Ki67 and EGFR in the triple-negative tumors. We demonstrated that DDX5 regulated a subset of MicroRNAs including miR-21 and miR-182 in basal breast cancer cells. Knockdown of DDX5 resulted in reorganization of actin cytoskeleton and reduction of cellular proliferation. The effects were accompanied by upregulation of tumor suppressor PDCD4 (a known miR-21 target); as well as upregulation of cofilin and profilin, two key proteins involved in actin polymerization and cytoskeleton maintenance, as a consequence of miR-182 downregulation. Treatment with miR-182 inhibitors resulted in morphologic phenotypes resembling those induced by DDX5 knockdown. Using bioinformatics tools for pathway and network analyses, we confirmed that the network for regulation of actin cytoskeleton was predominantly enriched for the predicted downstream targets of miR-182. Our results reveal a new functional role of DDX5 in breast cancer via the DDX5âmiR-182âactin cytoskeleton pathway, and suggest the potential clinical utility of DDX5 and its downstream MicroRNAs in the theranostics of breast cancer.Â«Â less\n\nStem loop recognition by DDX17 facilitates miRNA processing and antiviral defense\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMoy, Ryan H.; Cole, Brian S.; Yasunaga, Ari; Gold, Beth; Shankarling, Ganesh; Varble, Andrew; Molleston, Jerome M.; tenOever, Benjamin R.; Lynch, Kristen W.; Cherry, Sara\n\n2014-01-01\n\nDEAD-box helicases play essential roles in RNA metabolism across species, but emerging data suggest that they have additional functions in immunity. Through RNAi screening we identify an evolutionarily conserved and interferon-independent role for the DEAD-box helicase DDX17 in restricting Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a mosquito-transmitted virus in the bunyavirus family that causes severe morbidity and mortality in humans and livestock. Loss of Drosophila DDX17 (Rm62) in cells and flies enhanced RVFV infection. Similarly, depletion of DDX17 but not the related helicase DDX5 increased RVFV replication in human cells. Using cross-linking immunoprecipitation high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-seq), we show that DDX17 binds the stem loops of host pri-miRNA to facilitate their processing, and also an essential stem loop in bunyaviral RNA to restrict infection. Thus, DDX17 has dual roles in the recognition of stem loops: in the nucleus for endogenous miRNA biogenesis and in the cytoplasm for surveillance against structured non-self elements.

Ribosomes are a central component of the protein biosynthesis machinery in cells; however, their regulatory roles in the translational control of gene expression in skeletal muscle remain to be defined. In a genetic screen to identify critical regulators of myogenesis, we identified a DEAD-Box RNA helicase, DDX27, that is required for skeletal muscle growth and regeneration. We demonstrate that DDX27 regulates ribosomal RNA (rRNA) maturation, and thereby the ribosome biogenesis and the translation of specific transcripts during myogenesis. These findings provide insight into the translational regulation of gene expression in myogenesis and suggest novel functions for ribosomes in regulating gene expression in skeletal muscles.

While these often occur co-transcriptionally between nascent RNA and template DNA, we now show that they also form as part of a post-transcriptional mechanism targeting AID to IgH S-regions. This depends on the RNA helicase DDX1 that is also required for CSR inÂ vivo. DDX1 binds to G-quadruplex (G4) structures present in intronic switch transcripts and converts them into S-region R-loops.Â This in turn targets the cytidine deaminase enzyme AID to S-regions so promoting CSR. Notably R-loop levels over S-regions are diminished by chemical stabilization of G4 RNA or by the expression of a DDX1 ATPase-deficient mutant that acts as a dominant-negative protein to reduce CSR efficiency. In effect, we provide evidence for how S-region transcripts interconvert between G4 and R-loop structures to promote CSR in the IgH locus. Copyright Â© 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

The SPRY domain provides a putative proteinâprotein interaction platform within DDX1 that differs from other SPRY domains in its structure and conserved regions. The human RNA helicase DDX1 in the DEAD-box family plays an important role in RNA processing and has been associated with HIV-1 replication and tumour progression. Whereas previously described DEAD-box proteins have a structurally conserved core, DDX1 shows a unique structural feature: a large SPRY-domain insertion in its RecA-like consensus fold. SPRY domains are known to function as proteinâproteinmoreÂ Â» interaction platforms. Here, the crystal structure of the SPRY domain of human DDX1 (hDSPRY) is reported at 2.0 Ã resolution. The structure reveals two layers of concave, antiparallel Î²-sheets that stack onto each other and a third Î²-sheet beneath the Î²-sandwich. A comparison with SPRY-domain structures from other eukaryotic proteins showed that the general Î²-sandwich fold is conserved; however, differences were detected in the loop regions, which were identified in other SPRY domains to be essential for interaction with cognate partners. In contrast, in hDSPRY these loop regions are not strictly conserved across species. Interestingly, though, a conserved patch of positive surface charge is found that may replace the connecting loops as a proteinâprotein interaction surface. The data presented here comprise the first structural information on DDX1 and provide insights into the unique domain architecture of this DEAD-box protein. By providing the structure of a putative interaction domain of DDX1, this work will serve as a basis for further studies of the interaction network within the hetero-oligomeric complexes of DDX1 and of its recruitment to the HIV-1 Rev protein as a viral replication factor.Â«Â less\n\nThe interaction of RNA helicase DDX3 with HIV-1 Rev-CRM1-RanGTP complex during the HIV replication cycle\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nMahboobi, Seyed Hanif; Javanpour, Alex A.; Mofrad, Mohammad R. K.\n\n2015-02-27\n\nMolecular traffic between the nucleus and the cytoplasm is regulated by the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which acts as a highly selective channel perforating the nuclear envelope in eukaryotic cells. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) exploits the nucleocytoplasmic pathway to export its RNA transcripts across the NPC to the cytoplasm. Despite extensive study on the HIV life cycle and the many drugs developed to target this cycle, no current drugs have been successful in targeting the critical process of viral nuclear export, even though HIVâs reliance on a single host protein, CRM1, to export its unspliced and partially spliced RNAmoreÂ Â» transcripts makes it a tempting target. Due to recent findings implicating a DEAD-box helicase, DDX3, in HIV replication and a member of the export complex, it has become an appealing target for anti-HIV drug inhibition. In the present research, we have applied a hybrid computational protocol to analyze protein-protein interactions in the HIV mRNA export cycle. This method is based on molecular docking followed by molecular dynamics simulation and accompanied by approximate free energy calculation (MM/GBSA), computational alanine scanning, clustering, and evolutionary analysis. We highlight here some of the most likely binding modes and interfacial residues between DDX3 and CRM1 both in the absence and presence of RanGTP. This work shows that although DDX3 can bind to free CRM1, addition of RanGTP leads to more concentrated distribution of binding modes and stronger binding between CRM1 and RanGTP.Â«Â less\n\nThe interaction of RNA helicase DDX3 with HIV-1 Rev-CRM1-RanGTP complex during the HIV replication cycle\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMahboobi, Seyed Hanif; Javanpour, Alex A.; Mofrad, Mohammad R.

The human DEAD-box protein 1 (DDX1) plays an important role in tRNA and mRNA processing, is involved in tumor progression and is also hijacked by several virus families such as HIV-1 for replication and nuclear export. Although important in many cellular processes, the mechanism of DDX1's enzymatic function is unknown. We have performed equilibrium titrations and transient kinetics to determine affinities for nucleotides and RNA. We find an exceptional tight binding of DDX1 to adenosine diphosphate (ADP), one of the strongest affinities observed for DEAD-box helicases. ADP binds tighter by three orders of magnitude when compared to adenosine triphosphate (ATP), arresting the enzyme in a potential dead-end ADP conformation under physiological conditions. We thus suggest that a nucleotide exchange factor leads to DDX1 recycling. Furthermore, we find a strong cooperativity in binding of RNA and ATP to DDX1 that is also reflected in ATP hydrolysis. We present a model in which either ATP or RNA binding alone can partially shift the equilibrium from an 'open' to a 'closed'-state; this shift appears to be not further pronounced substantially even in the presence of both RNA and ATP as the low rate of ATP hydrolysis does not change.

To this end, we previously reported that the nucleolar DEAD-box RNA helicase, DDX56, is important for production of infectious WNV virions. In this study, we show that WNV infection results in relocalization of DDX56 from nucleoli to virus assembly sites on the endoplasmic reticululm (ER), an observation that is consistent with a role for DDX56 in WNV virion assembly. Super-resolution microscopy revealed that capsid and DDX56 localized to the same subcompartment of the ER, however, unexpectedly, stable interaction between these two proteins was only detected in the nucleus. Together, these data suggest that DDX56 relocalizes to the site of virus assembly during WNV infection and that its interaction with WNV capsid in the cytoplasm may occur transiently during virion morphogenesis.

Nullbasic also altered the subcellular localizations of Rev and other cellular proteins, including CRM1, B23 and C23 in a Rev-dependent manner, suggesting that Nullbasic may disrupt Rev function and trafficking by intervening with an unidentified component of the Rev nucleocytoplasmic transport complex. To seek a possible mechanism that could explain how Nullbasic inhibits Rev activity, we used a proteomics approach to identify host cellular proteins that interact with Nullbasic. Forty-six Nullbasic-binding proteins were identified by mass spectrometry including the DEAD-box RNA helicase, DDX1. To determine the effect of DDX1 on Nullbasic-mediated Rev activity, we performed cell-based immunoprecipitation assays, Rev reporter assays and bio-layer interferometry (BLI) assays. Interaction between DDX1 and Nullbasic was observed by co-immunoprecipitation of Nullbasic with endogenous DDX1 from cell lysates. BLI assays showed a direct interaction between Nullbasic and DDX1. Nullbasic affected DDX1 subcellular distribution in a Rev-independent manner. Interestingly overexpression of DDX1 in cells not only restored Rev-dependent mRNA export and gene expression in a Rev reporter assay but also partly reversed Nullbasic-induced Rev subcellular mislocalization. Moreover, HIV-1 wild type Tat co-immunoprecipitated with DDX1 and overexpression of Tat could rescue the unspliced viral mRNA levels inhibited by Nullbasic in HIV-1 expressing cells. Nullbasic was used to further define the complex mechanisms involved in the Rev-dependent nuclear export of the 9 kb and 4 kb viral RNAs. All together, these data indicate that DDX1 can be sequestered by Nullbasic leading to destabilization of the Rev nucleocytoplasmic transport complex and decreased\n\nInsights into the RNA quadruplex binding specificity of DDX21.\n\nPubMed\n\nMcRae, Ewan K S; Davidson, David E; Dupas, Steven J; McKenna, Sean A\n\n2018-06-12\n\nGuanine quadruplexes can form in both DNA and RNA and influence many biological processes through various protein interactions. The DEAD-box RNA helicase protein DDX21 has been shown to bind and remodel RNA quadruplexes but little is known about its specificity for different quadruplex species. Previous reports have suggested DDX21 may interact with telomeric repeat containing RNA quadruplex (TERRA), an integral component of the telomere that contributes to telomeric heterochromatin formation and telomere length regulation. Here we report that the C-terminus of DDX21 specifically binds to TERRA. We use, for the first time, 2D saturation transfer difference NMR to map the protein binding site on a ribonucleic acid species and show that the quadruplex binding domain of DDX21 interacts primarily with the phosphoribose backbone of quadruplexes. Furthermore, by mutating the 2'OH of loop nucleotides we can drastically reduce DDX21's affinity for quadruplex, indicating that the recognition of quadruplex and specificity for TERRA is mediated by interactions with the 2'OH of loop nucleotides.

We identified a RNA helicase, DDX3, which is overexpressed in many cancer types including lung cancer and is associated with lower survival in lung cancer patients. We designed a first-in-class small molecule inhibitor, RK-33, which binds to DDX3 and abrogates its activity. Inhibition of DDX3 by RK-33 caused G1 cell cycle arrest, induced apoptosis, and promoted radiation sensitization in DDX3-overexpressing cells. Importantly, RK-33 in combination with radiation induced tumor regression in multiple mouse models of lung cancer. Mechanistically, loss of DDX3 function either by shRNA or by RK-33 impaired Wnt signaling through disruption of the DDX3âÎ²-catenin axis and inhibited non-homologous end joiningâthe major DNA repair pathway in mammalian somatic cells. Overall, inhibition of DDX3 by RK-33 promotes tumor regression, thus providing a compelling argument to develop DDX3 inhibitors for lung cancer therapy.

In unperturbed cells, Ddx19 localizes in the cytoplasm and at the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore. Here we review recent findings related to an additional Ddx19 function in the nucleus in resolving RNA:DNA hybrids (R-loops) generated during collision between transcription and replication, and upon DNA damage. Activation of a DNA damage response pathway dependent upon the ATR kinase, a major regulator of replication fork progression, stimulates translocation of the Ddx19 protein from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. Only nuclear Ddx19 is competent to resolve R-loops, and down regulation of Ddx19 expression induces DNA double strand breaks only in proliferating cells. Overall these observations put forward Ddx19 as an important novel mediator of the crosstalk between transcription and replication.\n\nTargeting DDX3 with a small molecule inhibitor for lung cancer therapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nBol, Guus M; Vesuna, Farhad; Xie, Min; Zeng, Jing; Aziz, Khaled; Gandhi, Nishant; Levine, Anne; Irving, Ashley; Korz, Dorian; Tantravedi, Saritha; Heerma van Voss, Marise R; Gabrielson, Kathleen; Bordt, Evan A; Polster, Brian M; Cope, Leslie; van der Groep, Petra; Kondaskar, Atul; Rudek, Michelle A; Hosmane, Ramachandra S; van der Wall, Elsken; van Diest, Paul J; Tran, Phuoc T; Raman, Venu\n\n2015-05-01\n\nLung cancer is the most common malignancy worldwide and is a focus for developing targeted therapies due to its refractory nature to current treatment.

YopM enters the nucleus of host cells but neither the mechanisms governing its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling nor its intranuclear activities are known. Here we identify the DEAD-box helicase 3 (DDX3) as a novel interaction partner of Y. enterocolitica YopM and present the three-dimensional structure of a YopM:DDX3 complex. Knockdown of DDX3 or inhibition of the exportin chromosomal maintenance 1 (CRM1) increased the nuclear level of YopM suggesting that YopM exploits DDX3 to exit the nucleus via the CRM1 export pathway. Increased nuclear YopM levels caused enhanced phosphorylation of Ribosomal S6 Kinase 1 (RSK1) in the nucleus. In Y. enterocolitica infected primary human macrophages YopM increased the level of Interleukin-10 (IL-10) mRNA and this effect required interaction of YopM with RSK and was enhanced by blocking YopM's nuclear export. We propose that the DDX3/CRM1 mediated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of YopM determines the extent of phosphorylation of RSK in the nucleus to control transcription of immunosuppressive cytokines.\n\nThe RNA helicase DDX39B and its paralog DDX39A regulate androgen receptor splice variant AR-V7 generation.\n\nPubMed\n\nNakata, Daisuke; Nakao, Shoichi; Nakayama, Kazuhide; Araki, Shinsuke; Nakayama, Yusuke; Aparicio, Samuel; Hara, Takahito; Nakanishi, Atsushi\n\n2017-01-29\n\nMounting evidence suggests that constitutively active androgen receptor (AR) splice variants, typified by AR-V7, are associated with poor prognosis and resistance to androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer patients. However, mechanisms governing the generation of AR splice variants are not fully understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the dynamics of AR splice variant generation using the JDCaP prostate cancer model that expresses AR splice variants under androgen depletion. Microarray analysis of JDCaP xenografts before and after expression of AR splice variants suggested that dysregulation of RNA processing pathways is likely involved in AR splice variant generation. To explore factors contributing to generation of AR-V7 mRNA, we conducted a focused RNA interference screen in AR-V7-positive JDCaP-hr cells using an shRNA library targeting spliceosome-related genes. This screen identified DDX39B as a regulator of AR-V7 mRNA expression. Simultaneous knockdown of DDX39B and its paralog DDX39A drastically and selectively downregulated AR-V7 mRNA expression in multiple AR-V7-positive prostate cancer cell lines. DDX39B was upregulated in relapsed JDCaP xenografts expressing AR splice variants, suggesting its role in expression of AR splice variants. Taken together, our findings offer insight into the mechanisms of AR splice variant generation and identify DDX39 as a potential drug target for the treatment of AR splice variant-positive prostate cancer.

The majority of DDX3 is found in the cytoplasm, but a subset of tumors has distinct nuclear DDX3 localization of yet unknown biological significance. This study aimed to evaluate the significance of and mechanisms behind nuclear DDX3 expression in colorectal and breast cancer. Methods Expression of nuclear DDX3 and the nuclear exporter chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM1) was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 304 colorectal and 292 breast cancer patient samples. Correlations between the subcellular localization of DDX3 and CRM1 and the difference in overall survival between patients with and without nuclear DDX3 were studied. In addition, DDX3 mutants were created for in vitro evaluation of the mechanism behind nuclear retention of DDX3. Results DDX3 was present in the nucleus of 35% of colorectal and 48% of breast cancer patient samples and was particularly strong in the nucleolus. Nuclear DDX3 correlated with worse overall survival in both colorectal (hazard ratio [HR] 2.34, P<0.001) and breast cancer (HR 2.39, P=0.004) patients. Colorectal cancers with nuclear DDX3 expression more often had cytoplasmic expression of the nuclear exporter CRM1 (relative risk 1.67, P=0.04). In vitro analysis of DDX3 deletion mutants demonstrated that CRM1-mediated export was most dependent on the N-terminal nuclear export signal. Conclusion Overall, we conclude that nuclear DDX3 is partially CRM1-mediated and predicts worse survival in colorectal and breast cancer patients, putting it forward as a target for therapeutic intervention with DDX3 inhibitors under development in these cancer types.

Simon C.; Hutvagner, Gyorgy\n\n2016-01-01\n\nmiRNAs are small RNAs that are key regulators of gene expression in eukaryotic organisms. The processing of miRNAs is regulated by structural characteristics of the RNA and is also tightly controlled by auxiliary protein factors. Among them, RNA binding proteins play crucial roles to facilitate or inhibit miRNA maturation and can be controlled in a cell, tissue and species-specific manners or in response to environmental stimuli. In this study we dissect the molecular mechanism that promotes the overexpression of miR-132 in mice over its related, co-transcribed and co-regulated miRNA, miR-212. We have shown that the loop structure of miR-132 is a key determinant for its efficient processing in cells. We have also identified a range of RNA binding proteins that recognize the loop of miR-132 and influence both miR-132 and miR-212 processing. The DEAD box helicase p72/DDX17 was identified as a factor that facilitates the specific processing of miR-132.

Here, the recruitment of a multifunctional complex containing the cyclin dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) triggers the process of transcriptional elongation activating resting RNA polymerase engaged with innate immune response (IIR) genes. To identify additional functional activity of the CDK9 complex, we conducted immunoprecipitation (IP) enrichment-stable isotope labeling LC-MS/MS of the CDK9 complex in unstimulated cells and from cells activated by a synthetic dsRNA, polyinosinic/polycytidylic acid [poly (I:C)]. 245 CDK9 interacting proteins were identified with high confidence in the basal state and 20 proteins in four functional classes were validated by IP-SRM-MS. These data identified that CDK9 interacts with DDX 5/17, a family of ATP-dependent RNA helicases, important in alternative RNA splicing of NFAT5, and mH2A1 mRNA two proteins controlling redox signaling. A direct comparison of the basal versus activated state was performed using stable isotope labeling and validated by IP-SRM-MS. Recruited into the CDK9 interactome in response to poly(I:C) stimulation are HSPB1, DNA dependent kinases, and cytoskeletal myosin proteins that exchange with 60S ribosomal structural proteins. An integrated human CDK9 interactome map was developed containing all known human CDK9- interacting proteins. These data were used to develop a probabilistic global map of CDK9-dependent target genes that predicted two functional states controlling distinct cellular functions, one important in immune and stress responses. The CDK9-DDX5/17 complex was shown to be functionally important by shRNA-mediated knockdown, where differential accumulation of alternatively spliced NFAT5 and mH2A1 transcripts and alterations in downstream redox signaling were seen. The requirement of CDK9 for DDX5 recruitment to NFAT5 and mH2A1\n\nDDX3 binding with CK1Îµ was closely related to motor neuron degeneration of ALS by affecting neurite outgrowth.\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, Yanchun; Wang, Qing; Wang, Qiaozhen; Liu, Huancai; Zhou, Fenghua; Zhang, Yawen; Yuan, Meng; Zhao, Chunyan; Guan, Yingjun; Wang, Xin\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive degeneration of motor neurons. The pathogenesis of ALS remains largely unknown. RNA helicase DDX3 is a multifunctional protein involved in several steps of gene expression. Casein kinase 1Îµ (CK1Îµ) is an important signal molecule of Wnt signaling pathway and is closely related to neurite growth. However, the roles of DDX3 and CK1Îµ in the pathogenesis of ALS remain unclear. In this study, we first investigated the expression of DDX3 and CK1Îµ in the spinal cord of SOD1-G93A ALS transgenic mice using RT-PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemical technique. Results showed that the altered expression of DDX3 and CK1Îµ was found in the spinal cord of ALS mice. DDX3 and CK1Îµ positive cells were mainly distributed in the anterior horn of spinal cord and co-localized with neurons not with glial cells, suggesting that the altered expression of DDX3 and CK1Îµ was closely related to motor neuron degeneration of ALS. Moreover, we selected NSC34 cell line and transfected pEGFP-G93A-SOD1 plasmid to further examine the mechanism. Knockdown of DDX3 that uses small interfering RNA (siRNA) decreased the mRNA and protein levels of CK1Îµ significantly and inhibited neurite outgrowth of SOD1 mutant NSC34 cells in vitro. Co-immunoprecipitation kit confirmed that DDX3 could band with CK1Îµ in vivo. Our data suggested that DDX3 binding with CK1Îµ was closely related to motor neuron degeneration of ALS by affecting neurite outgrowth. Thus, elucidating the underlying mechanisms of ALS is crucial for future development of ALS treatments.\n\nEvolution of the DEAD box helicase family in chicken: chickens have no DHX9 ortholog.\n\nPubMed\n\nSato, Haruko; Oshiumi, Hiroyuki; Takaki, Hiromi; Hikono, Hirokazu; Seya, Tsukasa\n\n2015-10-01\n\nViral RNA represents a pattern molecule that can be recognized by RNA sensors in innate immunity. Humans and mice possess cytoplasmic DNA/RNA sensors for detecting viral replication. There are a number of DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp; DExD/H) box-type helicases in mammals, among which retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA50) are indispensable for RNA sensing; however, they are functionally supported by a number of sensors that directly bind viral RNA or replicative RNA intermediates to convey signals to RIG-I and MDA5. Some DEAD box helicase members recognize DNA irrespective of the origin. These sensors transmit IFN-inducing signals through adaptors, including mitochondrial antiviral signaling. Viral double-stranded RNAs are reportedly sensed by the helicases DDX1, DDX21, DHX36, DHX9, DDX3, DDX41, LGP2 and DDX60, in addition to RIG-I and MDA5, and induce type I IFNs, thereby blocking viral replication. Humans and mice have all nucleic acid sensors listed here. In the RNA sensing system in chicken, it was found in the present study that most DEAD box helicases are conserved; however, DHX9 is genetically deficient in addition to reported RIG-I. Based on the current genome databases, similar DHX9 deficiency was observed in ducks and several other bird species. Because chicken, but not duck, was found to be deficient in RIG-I, the RNA-sensing system of chicken lacks RIG-I and DHX9 and is thus more fragile than that of duck or mammal. DHX9 may generally compensate for the function of RIG-I and deficiency of DHX9 possibly participates in exacerbations of viral infection such as influenza in chickens.

In this report, we found that both EGFR and Ras signaling can upregulate RNA helicase DDX59 in lung cancer cells. DDX59 can be induced through the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway after EGFR or Ras activation. Inhibitors for Ras/Raf/MAP pathway significantly decreased DDX59 expression at both protein and mRNA levels. Through immunohistochemistry, we found that DDX59 protein expression correlated with Ras and EGFR mutation status in human lung adenocarcinoma. Finally, through a xenograft nude mice model, we demonstrated that DDX59 is pivotal for EGFR mutated lung cancer cell growth in vivo. Our study identified a novel protein downstream of Ras and EGFR, which may serve as a potential therapeutic drug target for lung cancer patients. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, we showed that DDX3X specifically recognizes the HCV 3â² untranslated region (UTR), leading to the activation of IKK-Î± and a cascade of lipogenic signaling to facilitate lipid droplet biogenesis and viral assembly (Q. Li, V. Pene, S. Krishnamurthy, H. Cha, and T. J. Liang, Nat Med 19:722â729, 2013, http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nm.3190). The interaction of DDX3X with HCV core protein seems to be dispensable for its proviral role. In this study, through systematic imaging and biochemical and virologic approaches, we identified a dynamic association between DDX3X and various cellular compartments and viral elements mediating multiple functions of DDX3X in productive HCV infection. Upon HCV infection, the HCV 3â²UTR interacts with DDX3X and IKK-Î±, which redistribute to speckle-like cytoplasmic structures shown to be stress granules (SGs). As viral proteins accumulate in infected cells, DDX3X granules together with SG-associated proteins redistribute and colocalize with HCV core protein around lipid droplets (LDs). IKK-Î±, however, does not relocate to the LD but translocates to the nucleus. In HCV-infected cells, various HCV nonstructural proteins also interact or colocalize with DDX3X in close proximity to SGs and LDs, consistent with the tight juxtaposition of the replication complex and the assembly site at the surface of LDs. Short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing of DDX3X and multiple SG components markedly inhibits HCV infection. Our data suggest that DDX3X initiates a multifaceted cellular program involving dynamic associations with HCV RNA and proteins, IKK-Î±, SG, and LD surfaces for its crucial role in the HCV life cycle.

However, the precise roles of individual members are not well understood. Work from our laboratory revealed that the DEAD-box protein Dbp2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an active RNA helicase in vitro that functions in transcription by promoting mRNP assembly, repressing cryptic transcription initiation, and regulating long noncoding RNA activity. Interestingly, Dbp2 is also linked to glucose sensing and hexose transporter gene expression. DDX5 is the mammalian ortholog of Dbp2 that has been implicated in cancer and metabolic syndrome, suggesting that the role of Dbp2 and DDX5 in glucose metabolic regulation is conserved. Herein, we present a refined biochemical and biological comparison of yeast Dbp2 and human DDX5 enzymes. We find that human DDX5 possesses a 10-fold higher unwinding activity than Dbp2, which is partially due to the presence of a mammalian/avian specific C-terminal extension. Interestingly, ectopic expression of DDX5 rescues the cold sensitivity, cryptic initiation defects, and impaired glucose import in dbp2 Î cells, suggesting functional conservation. Consistently, we show that DDX5 promotes glucose uptake and glycolysis in mouse AML12 hepatocyte cells, suggesting that mammalian DDX5 and S. cerevisiae Dbp2 share conserved roles in cellular metabolism.

The small molecule inhibitor RK-33 is designed to fit into the ATP binding cleft of DDX3 and hereby block its activity. RK-33 has shown potent activity in preclinical cancer models. However, the mechanism behind the antineoplastic activity of RK-33 remains largely unknown. In this study we used a dual phosphoproteomic and single cell tracking approach to evaluate the effect of RK-33 on cancer cells. MDA-MB-435 cells were treated for 24â¯hours with RK-33 or vehicle control. Changes in phosphopeptide abundance were analyzed with quantitative mass spectrometry using isobaric mass tags (Tandem Mass Tags). At the proteome level we mainly observed changes in mitochondrial translation, cell division pathways and proteins related to cell cycle progression. Analysis of the phosphoproteome indicated decreased CDK1 activity after RK-33 treatment. To further evaluate the effect of DDX3 inhibition on cell cycle progression over time, we performed timelapse microscopy of Fluorescent Ubiquitin Cell Cycle Indicators labeled cells after RK-33 or siDDX3 exposure. Single cell tracking indicated that DDX3 inhibition resulted in a global delay in cell cycle progression in interphase and mitosis. In addition, we observed an increase in endoreduplication. Overall, we conclude that DDX3 inhibition affects cells in all phases and causes a global cell cycle progression delay. Copyright Â© 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In this study, proteins that associate with Ty3 Gag3 capsid protein during virus-like particle (VLP) assembly were identified by mass spectrometry and screened for roles in mating-stimulated retrotransposition. Components of RNA processing bodies including DEAD box helicases Dhh1/DDX6 and Ded1/DDX3, Sm-like protein Lsm1, decapping protein Dcp2, and 5â to 3â exonuclease Xrn1 were among the proteins identified. These proteins associated with Ty3 proteins and RNA, and were required for formation of Ty3 VLP retrosome assembly factories and for retrotransposition. Specifically, Dhh1/DDX6 was required for normal levels of Ty3 genomic RNA, and Lsm1 and Xrn1 were required for association of Ty3 protein and RNA into retrosomes. This role for components of RNA processing bodies in promoting VLP assembly and retrotransposition during mating in a yeast that lacks RNA interference, contrasts with roles proposed for orthologous components in animal germ cell ribonucleoprotein granules in turnover and epigenetic suppression of retrotransposon RNAs.

The acquired mutation in DDX41 is highly concentrated at c.G1574A (p.R525H) in the conserved motif VI located at the C-terminus of the helicase core domain where ATP interacts and is hydrolyzed. Therefore, it is likely that the p.R525H mutation perturbs ATPase activity in a dominant-negative manner. In this study, we screened for the DDX41 mutation of CD34-positive tumor cells based on mRNA sequencing and identified the p.R525H mutation in three cases among 23 patients. Intriguingly, these patients commonly exhibited acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with peripheral blood cytopenias and low blast counts, suggesting that the mutation inhibits the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. Data from cord blood cells and leukemia cell lines suggest a role for DDX41 in preribosomal RNA processing, in which the expression of the p.R525H mutant causes a certain ribosomopathy phenotype in hematopoietic cells by suppressing MDM2-mediated RB degradation, thus triggering the inhibition of E2F activity. This study uncovered a pathogenic role of p.R525H DDX41 in the slow growth rate of tumor cells. Age-dependent epigenetic alterations or other somatic changes might collaborate with the mutation to causeÂ AML. Copyright Â© 2016 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.

Homozygous Ddx18 mutant embryos exhibit a profound loss of myeloid and erythroid cells along with cardiovascular abnormalities and reduced size. These mutants also display prominent apoptosis and a G1 cell-cycle arrest. Loss of p53, but not Bcl-xl overexpression, rescues myeloid cells to normal levels, suggesting that the hematopoietic defect is because of p53-dependent G1 cell-cycle arrest. We then sequenced primary samples from 262 patients with myeloid malignancies because genes essential for myelopoiesis are often mutated in human leukemias. We identified 4 nonsynonymous sequence variants (NSVs) of DDX18 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient samples. RNA encoding wild-type DDX18 and 3 NSVs rescued the hematopoietic defect, indicating normal DDX18 activity. RNA encoding one mutation, DDX18-E76del, was unable to rescue hematopoiesis, and resulted in reduced myeloid cell numbers in ddx18hi1727/+ embryos, indicating this NSV likely functions as a dominant-negative allele. These studies demonstrate the use of the zebrafish as a robust in vivo system for assessing the function of genes mutated in AML, which will become increasingly important as more sequence variants are identified by next-generation resequencing technologies.

Retrovirus reverse transcription creates numerous potential ligands for cytosolic host sensors that recognize foreign nucleic acids, including single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), RNA/DNA hybrids, and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). We and others recently showed that the sensors cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), DEAD-box helicase 41 (DDX41), and members of the Aim2-like receptor (ALR) family participate in the recognition of retroviral reverse transcripts. However, why multiple sensors might be required and their relative importance in in vivo control of retroviral infection are not known. Here, we show that DDX41 primarily senses the DNA/RNA hybrid generated at the first step of reverse transcription, while cGAS recognizes dsDNA generated at the next step. We also show that both DDX41 and cGAS are needed for the antiretroviral innate immune response to murine leukemia virus (MLV) and HIV in primary mouse macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). Using mice with cell type-specific knockout of the Ddx41 gene, we show that DDX41 sensing in DCs but not macrophages was critical for controlling in vivo MLV infection. This suggests that DCs are essential in vivo targets for infection, as well as for initiating the antiviral response. Our work demonstrates that the innate immune response to retrovirus infection depends on multiple host nucleic acid sensors that recognize different reverse transcription intermediates. IMPORTANCE Viruses are detected by many different host sensors of nucleic acid, which in turn trigger innate immune responses, such as type I interferon (IFN) production, required to control infection. We show here that at least two sensors are needed to initiate a highly effective innate immune response to retroviruses-DDX41, which preferentially senses the RNA/DNA hybrid generated at the first step of retrovirus\n\nperiod -1 encodes an ATP-dependent RNA helicase that influences nutritional compensation of the Neurospora circadian clock\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nEmerson, Jillian M.; Bartholomai, Bradley M.; Ringelberg, Carol S.\n\n2015-12-08\n\nMutants in the period-1 (prd-1) gene, characterized by a recessive allele, display a reduced growth rate and period lengthening of the developmental cycle controlled by the circadian clock.

They share nine conserved sequence motifs that are involved in nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, RNA binding, and helicase activity. Most of these motifs line the cleft between the two helicase domains, and extensive communication between them is required for RNA unwinding. The two helicase domains of the Bacillus subtilis RNA helicase YxiN were produced separately as intein fusions, and a functional RNA helicase was generated by expressed protein ligation. The ligated helicase binds adenine nucleotides with very similar affinities to the wild-type protein. Importantly, its intrinsically low ATPase activity is stimulated by RNA, and the Michaelis-Menten parameters are similar to those of the wild-type. Finally, ligated YxiN unwinds a minimal RNA substrate to an extent comparable to that of the wild-type helicase, confirming authentic interdomain communication.\n\nperiod -1 encodes an ATP-dependent RNA helicase that influences nutritional compensation of the Neurospora circadian clock\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nEmerson, Jillian M.; Bartholomai, Bradley M.; Ringelberg, Carol S.; ...\n\n2015-12-08\n\nMutants in the period-1 ( prdÂ­-1) gene, characterized by a recessive allele, display a reduced growth rate and period lengthening of the developmental cycle controlled by the circadian clock. We refined the genetic location of prdÂ­-1 and used whole genome sequencing to find the mutation defining it, confirming the identity of prdÂ­-1 by rescuing the mutant circadian phenotype via transformation. PRD-1 is an RNA helicase whose orthologs, DDX5 and DDX17 in humans and Dbp2p in yeast, are implicated in various processes including transcriptional regulation, elongation, and termination, 23 ribosome biogenesis, and RNA decay. Although prdÂ­-1smutantssiois an ATP-dependent RNA helicase, membermoreÂ Â» of a sub-family display a long period (~25 hrs) circadian developmental cycle, they interestingly display a wild type period when the core circadian oscillator is tracked using a frq-luciferase transcriptional fusion under conditions of limiting nutritional carbon; the core oscillator runs with a long period under glucose-sufficient conditions. Furthermore PRD-1 clearly impacts the circadian oscillator and is not only part of a metabolic oscillator ancillary to the core clock. PRD-1 is an essential protein and its expression is neither light-regulated nor clock-regulated. However, it is transiently induced by glucose; in the presence of sufficient glucose PRD-1 is in the nucleus until glucose runs out which elicits its disappearance from the nucleus. Because circadian period length is carbon concentration-dependent, prdÂ­-1 may be formally viewed as clock mutant with defective nutritional compensation of circadian period length.Â«Â less\n\nDDX4 (DEAD box polypeptide 4) colocalizes with cancer stem cell marker CD133 in ovarian cancers\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKim, Ki Hyung; Biomedical Research Institute and Pusan Cancer Center, Pusan National University Hospital, Busan; Kang, Yun-Jeong\n\nHighlights: â¢ Germ cell marker DDX4 was significantly increased in ovarian cancer. â¢ Ovarian cancer stem cell marker CD133 was significantly increased in ovarian cancer. â¢ DDX4 and CD133 were mostly colocalized in various types of ovarian cancer tissues. â¢ CD133 positive ovarian cancer cells also express DDX4 whereas CD133-negative cells did not possess DDX4. â¢ Germ cell marker DDX4 has the potential of ovarian cancer stem cell marker. - Abstract: DDX4 (DEAD box polypeptide 4), characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD), is an RNA helicase which is implicated in various cellular processes involving the alteration of RNA secondarymoreÂ Â» structure, such as translation initiation, nuclear and mitochondrial splicing, and ribosome and spliceosome assembly. DDX4 is known to be a germ cell-specific protein and is used as a sorting marker of germline stem cells for the production of oocytes. A recent report about DDX4 in ovarian cancer showed that DDX4 is overexpressed in epithelial ovarian cancer and disrupts a DNA damage-induced G2 checkpoint. We investigated the relationship between DDX4 and ovarian cancer stem cells by analyzing the expression patterns of DDX4 and the cancer stem cell marker CD133 in ovarian cancers via tissue microarray. Both DDX4 and CD133 were significantly increased in ovarian cancer compared to benign tumors, and showed similar patterns of expression. In addition, DDX4 and CD133 were mostly colocalized in various types of ovarian cancer tissues. Furthermore, almost all CD133 positive ovarian cancer cells also express DDX4 whereas CD133-negative cells did not possess DDX4, suggesting a strong possibility that DDX4 plays an important role in cancer stem cells, and/or can be used as an ovarian cancer stem cell marker.Â«Â less\n\nAMP sensing by DEAD-box RNA helicases\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPutnam, Andrea A.; Jankowsky, Eckhard\n\n2013-01-01\n\nIn eukaryotes, cellular levels of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) signal the metabolic state of the cell. AMP concentrations increase significantly upon metabolic stress, such as glucose deprivation in yeast. Here we show that several DEAD-box RNA helicases are sensitive to AMP, which is not produced during ATP hydrolysis by these enzymes. We find that AMP potently inhibits RNA binding and unwinding by the yeast DEAD-box helicases Ded1p, Mss116p, and eIF4A. However, the yeast DEAD-box helicases Sub2p and Dbp5p are not inhibited by AMP. Our observations identify a subset of DEAD-box helicases as enzymes with the capacity to directly link changes in AMP concentrations to RNA metabolism.
