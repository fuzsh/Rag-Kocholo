After years of marginalization by academics in the Western world, Indian cinemas have moved from the periphery to the center of world cinema in a comparatively short space of time. Bringing together contributions from leading scholars in the ï¬eld, this Handbook looks at the complex reasons for this remarkable journey. Combining an historical and thematic approach, the Handbook discusses how Indian cinemas need to be understood in their historical unfolding as well as their complex relationships to social, economic, cultural, political, ideological, aesthetic, technical and institutional discourses. The thematic section provides an up-to-date critical narrative on diverse topics such as audi- ence, censorship, ï¬lm distribution, ï¬lm industry, diaspora, sexuality, ï¬lm music and nationalism. The Handbook provides a comprehensive and cutting-edge survey of Indian cinemas, dis- cussing Popular, Parallel/New Wave and Regional cinemas as well as the spectacular rise of Bollywood. It is an invaluable resource for students and academics of South Asian Studies, Film Studies and Cultural Studies. K. Moti Gokulsing is Senior Visiting Research Fellow at the University of East London, UK. He is the co-founder and co-editor of the journal South Asian Popular Culture published by Routledge.

Moti Gokulsing and Wimal Dissanayake The cinema is still the favorite pastime of most populations across the globe. It is clearly so in India, which is the largest ï¬lm-producing country in the world. Its output now has a formidable global reach. After years of marginalization by academics in the West, as well as by local elite cultural commentators, Indian cinema has moved from the periphery to the center of world cinema in a comparatively short space of time. The reasons for this remarkable journey are many and complex. At one level, we have Amitabh Bachchanâs comment, âIt is not we who have changed, it is the people who are looking at us who haveâ (Bachchan 2004). At another level, we can state, to borrow some remarks from John Fiske (2010) that were made in a diï¬erent context, that beneath the surface of Indian cinema lie a multitude of meanings and ways of interpreting and understanding them, not all of them intended by the ï¬lm producers themselves. The interpretive function and the proactive role of audiences have been justly recognized by modern ï¬lm theorists. In putting together this volume of essays on Indian cinema we were guided by the following important considerations. First, we believe that cinema is a signiï¬cant cultural practice. What we mean by this is that we need to recognize that cinema is art, entertainment, technology, industry and ideology all at the same time. All these aspects intersect so as to constitute a complex unity. We can understand the true nature of Indian cinemaâor for that matter any other cinemaâonly if we pay attention to the complex interlacing of these facets. Most of the essays in this volume have been guided by this conviction. Second, we believe that cinema is a powerful reï¬ector of society. It mirrors the social trans- formations, cultural tensions and new trends that are surfacing in society in interesting ways. At the same time we are also mindful of the fact that cinema is a shaper of those social transfor- mations, cultural tensions and new trends that emerge. It is important that we keep in view this dual function of cinema, and this is most relevant in the case of a country like India. The authors of the chapters in this collection are sensitive to this fact. We believe that cinema is a vital adjunct of the public sphere molding views, attitudes and opinions of the vast movie-going public. Third, as we were planning this volume, the question of the relationship between cinema and the Indian social imaginary was at the back of our minds. The concept of the social ima- ginary is one that culturally oriented ï¬lm scholars and critics can employ usefully. As the emi- nent social philosopher Charles Taylor (2004) remarked, the concept of the social imaginary encompasses something much wider and deeper than analytical schemes and intellectual cate- gories that scholars employ when exploring social reality. He focuses on the âways in which 1\n\nP:19\n\nK. Moti Gokulsing and Wimal Dissanayake they imagine their social existence, how they ï¬t together with others, how things go on between them and their fellows, the expectations which are normally met and the deeper normative notions and images which underlie their expectationsâ (ibid.: 23). Here Taylor is focusing on the experiential dimension of living which we can invoke usefully in our ï¬lm analysis. Fourth, cinema has been examined traditionally in terms of the nation; the trope of national cinema has dominated ï¬lm analysis. This is particularly important in a large country like India in which ï¬lms are made in a number of diï¬erent languages. However, in recent times the inter- actions between the national and the international have increased exponentially, focusing on the international implications of Indian cinema. Bollywood cinema, for instance, which is gaining a global audience and visibility, indexes this fact. Hence in this volume we have chosen also to focus on diasporic ï¬lmmakers and diasporic audiences, as a means of extending the discursive and exegetical boundaries of Indian cinema. Fifth, there has been a strong connection between cinema and the culture of modernity from the very beginning in India. In India cinema has played and continues to play a vital role in disseminating an urban consciousness, and facilitating the transition from feudal and agricultural societies to urban and industrial societies, and from there to consumer and postmodernist societies. The cinema has been a facilitator of social transformation in India in complex ways. Indian ï¬lms reï¬ect these transformations and the authors featured in this volume highlight this facet of Indian experience. How Indian cinema connects with, and is informed by, technology, consumerism, spectacle, the march of modernityâever-changing facets of representation related to an India on the moveâis a theme that many of the chapters in this Handbook have addressed. Sixth, we also wanted our book to be representative of diverse approaches to cinema. This is all the more important since in recent years there has been a tendency for Indian scholarship to rely too heavily on Western theories. To avoid being unduly subservient to Western theories, we decided to clear an analytical space within the covers of this volume where diverse theories, vocabularies and analytical tools could freely intermingle while making the chapters easily accessible to a variety of readers. This Handbook of commissioned chapters in which contributors were asked to provide a survey of their chosen topic analyzes many aspects of Indian cinemas to reveal their explicit and implicit (and often opposite) meanings. In our attempt to be as comprehensive as possible, we have opted to combine an historical and thematic approach. Indian cinemas need to be under- stood in their historical unfolding as well as their complex relationships to social, economic, cultural, political, ideological and institutional discourses. Thus, considering the diverse con- tributions of the regional cinemas of India, often marginalized in much of the literature, we have ï¬agged them as much as space allowed. We are aware of the problems involved in such an approach for, to quote âThe Making of Indiaâ (Social Scientist 2005), we are dealing with a nation that is held together neither by a common language, shared religion nor primordial racial myth. The contributors in the ï¬rst section demonstrate the many facets of the Indian cinemas by discussing Popular, Parallel/New Wave and Regional cinemas. The spectacular rise of Bol- lywood is underlined. The thematic sections provide a framework for some of the leading scholars on Indian cinemas to weave an up-to-date critical narrative on diverse topics such as audiences, censor- ship, corporatization of the ï¬lm industry, diaspora, documentary studies, ï¬lm distribution, ï¬lm music, nationalism, property rights, sexuality and social networking. The Handbook provides a comprehensive and cutting-edge survey of Indian cinemas and an invaluable resource for Indian ï¬lm historians, students, academics and all those with a serious interest in Indian cinemas. 2\n\nP:20\n\nIntroduction Note The translation of titles of Indian ï¬lms into English has always been a problem. Some ï¬lms have no oï¬cially sanctioned translations; others have many. Hence, we have left this problematic issue to the discretion of each individual author. With regard to the changed names of cities, we felt that as this Handbook is meant for academics, scholars and discerning readers familiar with Indian society and history, there was no compelling need to provide both variations.

Madhava Prasad There are a number of ways in which the spectator of a popular ï¬lm might ï¬nd him or herself at the receiving end of cinemaâs pedagogic vocation. Here we need only look at two relevant ones. Thus melodrama is an entertainment form with a pedagogic mission. Its very existence attests to a relation of cultural education between the pioneering missionaries of the bourgeoisie and the expropriated âfree laborâ ï¬ocking to the cities.1 To give another example, it is well known that Hollywood cinema, when it reaches the ends of the world, is more than likely to be regarded by the second- or third-order viewership there as a source of knowledge and values which hold the promise of a better life. This impact of Hollywood overseas is further divisible into two related aspects: ï¬rst, the direct social impact which has been an object of concern and investigation since at least the 1920s, as is clear from the report and proceedings of the Indian Cinematograph Committee (ICC) of 1927â28;2 and second, the formal pressure exercised by Hollywood upon the ï¬lm industry, which is so strong that for some prominent ï¬lmmakers in India today, Hollywood is nothing less than a Platonic realm of ideas which they aspire to reproduce. In the case of melodrama, we are dealing with the intersection of two distinct domains of cultural practice: a bourgeois culture and a popular culture that catered to working-class and peasant audiences (for the moment restricting ourselves to the European social conditions that attended its origins). In the second instance, we routinely encounter discussions of national cinema (and Indian cinema in particular) which regard it as having arisen from the depths of the soil. In some cases, of course, this is true: it can be said of post-revolution Iranian cinema that it is a distinctive national style, although the same could not be said about Iranian cinema from before this time. However, Indian popular cinema long ago entered into a relation of common measure with Hollywood, a relation that is acknowledged, albeit in a playful or mocking tone, in the popularity of the term âBollywood.â The mode of employment of this common measure may diï¬er from case to case. In melodramatic narratives we often ï¬nd popular culture proclaiming its own inferiority faced with the ï¬ner products of a classical culture (Shankarabharanam, Abhiman). Its value system seems imposed from above. In the case of Bollywood, the pressure exercised by Hollywood upon it is strictly a matter of postcolonial desire. It is the Indian ï¬lmmakers who imagine a common measure and aspire to achieve parity with Hollywood under it. 7\n\nP:25\n\nM. Madhava Prasad There are two orders of commensuration, one internal to the Indian social formation, the other external. Both are equally important determinations for the current state of Indian popular cinema, but there is also a third relation that is emerging. This can take the form of a relation between the two orders just described, insofar as these relations themselves are productive and identiï¬able with diï¬erent tendencies in ï¬lm production. Concretely, we ï¬nd in contemporary Bombay products a sustained campaign to reconstitute the narrative and moral coordinates of ï¬lmic narration. The old ï¬lm form is undergoing changes to accommodate the new values and ideals associated with the currently emerging capitalist society. There are many ways in which the cinema has turned into a classroom for the re-education of the Indian spectator for the era of globalization,3 including, to give a quick example, the familiar, if not by now already for- gotten Archie Comics-inspired views of Indian college life. This chapter is divided into three parts. The ï¬rst part analyzes a ï¬lm that uses the cultural backwardness of the Indian spectator as a ruse to overcome a narrative impasse. The second part turns to the ICCâs report in order to trace the historical construction of the culturally backward spectator. The third part returns to the present to describe developments in contemporary Indian cinema as constituting a moment of social and formal imitation as re-education of the Indian subject. Trumping the culturally backward spectator Pyar Tune Kya Kiya (Rajat Mukherjee, 2001; hereafter PTKK) is of interest as an attempt to dramatize the historical predicament of a spectator caught between two logics of narration. It could be described as a ï¬lm about the perils of spectatorship in the new world. The new spectator is one who will have been stripped forcibly of the traditional modes of reading and rendered free, and therefore obliged to work for his or her meaning. PTKK shows the spectator how it is done. From the beginning, PTKK adopts an editing strategy that juxtaposes and runs together two logics of narrationâone with which the average spectator is familiar as a viewer of Hindi ï¬lms, and another which is associated with Hollywood. It combines shots that seem to harbor an enigma instituting suspense and demanding interpretation and transitions that seem to restore the reassuring already-knownness of what is to come. Individual scenes are readable within an anticipated order of unfolding but will later turn out to have had another intention, an intention which the spectator will remember having suspected but brushed aside out of an inherent trust nourished by decades of Hindi cinema. The spectator ï¬nally ends up in a jam for not having read the signs and has to pay the price for it. S/he must fall into line by pretending actually to have read the signs: that is the punishment which, once undergone, can also turn into some- thing of a reward. In the process the spectator will have given up on a moral principle too. To brieï¬y recount the narrative of PTKK: Riya, the spoilt child of a rich widower, is per- suaded by Jai, a fashion photographer, to work as a model. Convinced that Jai is in love with her, Riya ï¬nds out on visiting him at home that he is married. After this discovery, Riyaâs latent psychosis emerges full-blown and the rest of the ï¬lm follows the lead of Hollywood stalker ï¬lms like Play Misty for Me, Fatal Attraction, etc. In what could be seen as a concession to Indian sensibilities, the ï¬lm concludes with an epilogue where Jai and his wife Geeta visit Riya, now conï¬ned to a mental hospital, only to ï¬nd that his presence reactivates her psychosis. They quickly leave, with Riyaâs screams echoing through the hospital corridors. The ï¬rst half of the ï¬lm leading up to Riyaâs shocking discovery is given over to the elaborate staging of the âromance,â in keeping with formula ï¬lm convention. It is here that the editing strategy referred to above is employed. Thus very early in the ï¬lm, Riyaâs father and the housekeeper have a conversation about her, leading up to a suggestion by the housekeeper that she be married oï¬. On his wondering where he will ï¬nd a groom for her, a cut takes us to a scenic landscape where 8\n\nP:26\n\nCultural backwardness to the age of imitation we see Jai with his camera. According to the conventions of Hindi ï¬lm cutting, we are supposed to read this as the answer to the fatherâs question. Interspersed with this and other scenes of âromanceâ between the two, are scenes where we get glimpses into Riyaâs not-so-normal mental state. Endowed with the traditional means of interpretation, the spectator comes knowing what to expect and the ï¬lm delivers it up to him.4 There are some disruptions, some deviations to be sure, but these are also in a way to be expected: they are the thrills that must be constantly renewed to hold interest. The form provides for innovations in all of its component sectors. There are ways in which the moral universe can be opened up provisionally for the enjoyment of illicit pleasures. The communicative content of the ï¬lm is designed to facilitate instant readability, to leave little room for protracted uncertainty. Suspense is often staged with the full knowledge of the spectator, under the supervision of a character who is in the know, who will eventually end the suspense and demonstrate (to the character who was in the dark) that where evil was thought to reside, good was already present and ruling. However, in having to use the visual images already seen as evidence of what is being asserted at a later stage, the spectator is asked to become a legal subject. The subject of classical ï¬lm melodrama is secure in her morality, and the ï¬lm does not disturb this security; she is never kept in the dark for too long. This spectator can observe the moral discomï¬ture of a character with full knowledge of the outcome. In the moment of the legal redeï¬nition of morality, the ï¬lm text acquires evidentiary value. Following the scene at Jaiâs ï¬at where his wife opens the door to Riya and the latter discovers the truth, for a short period the spectator suspects but is not sure if sheâs been had. The ï¬lm does not obstruct the working over of the problem with which the spectator has had to deal. It lets Riya confront Jai again with questions that seem perfectly rational to us. Had he no feelings for her? What about her feelingsâdid he really not see that she was in love? How is that possible? Why didnât he say something? The answer that Jai is unable to convincingly give to Riya is given to us in a scene where he explains his behavior to his wife. It is at this point that the spectator has either to switch sides and enjoy the stalker ï¬lm that follows or continue to abide with Riyaâs question. However, in that case the spectator will be challenged by the evidentiary character of the past as captured in images. Did you not see? Would you like to see it again? It becomes a quarrel between the morality of the melodrama and the legal-moral domain of this new cinema. The legal is diï¬erent from the moral not because it lacks a moral dimension but simply by the fact that the matter at hand is judged only after the fact. You are assumed to be innocent until proven guilty. That means, in terms of ï¬lm melodrama, that the spectator must exercise vigilance against his own proclivity to assign a role and a value to a character before he has had a chance to view the ï¬lm, merely on the basis of one or two indications. It is only after a crime is committed or alleged to have been committed that the examination of evidence can begin, and it is only after all the evidence has been pre- sented that judgment can be proclaimed. The old spectator, however, lacks this discipline. He will not wait until the end of the ï¬lm in order to know the meaning; he knows it at all times. Every new twist in ï¬lm melodrama is inscribed within this known world. Although this new way of reading has been associated with Hollywood, it should be noted that even in Hollywood any successful deployment of suspense will require that the spectatorâs desire be manipulated so that she overlooks the evidence when it is ï¬rst presented. This being the case, we could say that all that PTKK has done is to use the spectatorâs training in ï¬lm- watching to achieve its owns ends, just as many ï¬lms, both here and in Hollywood, sometimes manipulate our knowledge of star personae to produce surprise endings. The spectatorâs desire for repetition is pampered by the editing strategy while inserting, right in front of his nose, evidence that will require him to sit up and confront the unfamiliar at a later stage. However, what complicates matters is the fact that this shift from one mode of reading to another involves a parallel shift from one moral world order to another. When we ï¬nally realize that âit was all in her head,â 9\n\nP:27\n\nM. Madhava Prasad we also have to come to terms with the fact that it was in our heads as well, and this shift involves, for us, accepting the terms of the new moral order in which ï¬irting with people at work is a harmless diversion. Failure to do so means identifying with a psychopath and risking psychosis. All the narratives of romance had not prepared us for this new truth, for those, from more innocent times, were set in paradise. In PTKK, the culturally backward spectator is told to sit up and look to his own safety. While serving as a lesson in the new culture of ï¬lm spectatorship, however, the ï¬lm is unable convincingly to manage the transition from the semiotic obscurities of the ï¬rst part to the moral resolution of the second part. Having represented the hero as a ï¬gure from conventional romances, the ï¬lm is unable to acknowledge his culpability; it shows itself unable to handle the possibility of Jai having knowingly misled Riya or in some other way yielded to temptation. This is what distinguishes this stalker ï¬lm from its Hollywood precursors. The latter do not demand of the spectator a wholly unexpected moral adjustment. PTKK, however, resorts to the idea of a new moral order, a diï¬erent culture of gender relations, to eï¬ect the transition. By intertwining moral with ï¬lmic codes the narrative is able to avoid interrogation by the spectator. Faced with the prospect of being rendered culturally backward, the spectator falls into line, but the repressed element remains active and returns in the epilogue as a symptom. PTKK belongs to an early phase of what I would term Indian cinemaâs âage of imitation.â It is not surprising, therefore, that it ends up being trapped in the very backwardness that it manipulates for its narrative ends. The creative dilemma of the Indian ï¬lmmaker has been repeatedly articulated by many ï¬lmmakers themselves. The classic form of this articulation is that they are forced by the audiences to make the kind of ï¬lms they would prefer not to make. It is in this context that I would now like to turn to a discussion of the historical construction of the culturally backward spectator and the more recent turn to imitation as a way out of this trap of backwardness. Let us ï¬rst take a look at the origins of the culturally backward spectator. The origins of the culturally backward spectator Whatever else it achieved or did not achieve, the ICCâs proceedings and report gave rise to something that was not among its stated goals: the idea of a culturally backward spectator. While scholars5 may debate the success of this undertaking in shaping the future of the ï¬lm industry in India, there is little doubt that for the next sixty years or so (until the publication of the Shivaram Karanth Committee Report in 1980 at least), state-initiated discourse about cinema in India continued to operate within the terms of engagement established by this ï¬rst committee.6 The same mix of cultural panic and enthusiasm for enlightenment, liberal ideas and dirigiste caution continued to be reproduced in report after report and also seeped into ï¬lm journalism and public discourse.7 In the introductory chapter, the committee begins the work of producing the image of a culturally backward spectator by proposing that âthe general eï¬ect of the cinema upon the people must vary in diï¬erent countries according to the class of ï¬lms generally shown and the conditions of the countryâ (ICC Report: 3). So far so good. Coming to India, however, we ï¬nd that âthe pro- blem is one of peculiar complexity owing mainly to the fact that the majority of the ï¬lms exhibited are produced in the West and portray an entirely alien civilizationâ (ibid.). Already a situation common to all but a handful of countries in the world is being described as being peculiar to India. While the report tries on the whole to present a picture of normalcy to combat the extreme moral conservatism that it had to deal with from many interested parties (among the more bizarre of them being the social hygienists), as well as some of its own members, it is also clear that the committee is striving for consensus among its liberal and conservative members, who are drawn from native communities, both Hindu and Muslim, and from European communities. The European members are not as worked up about the censorship issue as they are keen to 10\n\nP:28\n\nCultural backwardness to the age of imitation ensure trade beneï¬ts for England. Among the Indian members, too, the chairman in particular seems unconvinced by the moral arguments, although he does not hesitate to use them to nag his interviewees. The conservatives, however, are more generously represented among the interviewees from both native and European sides, and are keen to protect their respective communities from the evil inï¬uence. The conservative case was on the one hand that the Europeans needed protection against the wrong ideas that natives might get about them from these ï¬lms, and on the other that the natives needed protection against such alien cultural products. On the whole they hoped to protect themselves by protecting the natives.8 Irrespective of all these diï¬erences, however, all were agreed on an essential sociological observation: that disregarding all lower-level distinctions, Indians could be divided into two kinds, educated and uneducated. It is on the question of the impact of cinema on the unedu- cated spectator and the impact of the cinema-impacted uneducated spectator on colonial authority that the members of the committee achieved a measure of consensus.9 Thus the cul- turally backward spectator was a product of the joint eï¬orts of British and Indian members. The committee speaks of âthe danger of Westernization, of denationalizationâ (ICC Report: 3). This is the conservative position, echoing the feelings of one of the members, Sir Ibrahim Haroon Jaï¬er, who had earned his place on the committee by bringing up the matter in the Council of State. On that occasion he had averred: I have come to the conclusion that some such action as is suggested in this resolution should be taken in view of the altogether erroneous impression made on the Indian mind of the social life of England, America and other Western lands by many of the cinema ï¬lms permitted to be shown throughout India, an impression which is decidedly inimical to the interests of the country in general. (ibid.: 5) Having recorded the conservative view, in the same breath the committee proceeds to describe India as âessentially a conservative country, possibly an ultra-conservative country,â where Western ï¬lms may have âeducational value,â as they âtend to open the eyes of the uneducated to other and more advanced conditions of life,â to âbroaden their minds and widen their outlookâ (ibid.: 3). The same population of uneducated Indians is thus both susceptible to the âdenationalizingâ inï¬uence of foreign ï¬lms and likely to beneï¬t from its educative value in a world that is here already being conceived in developmental terms as consisting of advanced and backward regions and populations. Where these beneï¬ts were likely to be accompanied by immoral seductions and wrong impressions about white peopleâs behavior, censorship would have to do its job. While the uneducated were in any case a miniscule portion of the audience for foreign ï¬lms, increased production of ï¬lms based on Indian themes would further wean them away from these and ensure their cultural health. The distinction between educated and uneducated that is adopted here only makes sense if the educated are regarded as having accepted the values of colonial society. Their proï¬le in the proceedings is that of a class that has the discernment and independence of judgment necessary for a proper appreciation of the ways of an alien culture. In other words, they are already considered free agents, culturally speaking. They have internalized the values that (colonial) education has taught them. They âknowâ white people, they are mature enough not to judge them by their own moral yardstick (or, education has ensured that their moral yardstick is no longer all that diï¬erent from that of the colonizer). They can be trusted to keep the faith, not to generalize about the white society around them on the basis of what they see white people doing in American movies. The educated Indians are thus locked into a dual relationship with the colonizer as sahridaya on the one hand and with the uneducated as humwatan on the other. 11\n\nP:29\n\nM. Madhava Prasad In independent India, the educated and the uneducated enter into a new relationship from which the overseeing authority of the colonizer has been eliminated. As Partha Chatterjee has shown in his well-known analysis of the national state, the new situation was handled in such a way as to place the experts of the developmental state in a position that was supreme and insulated from the authority of the legislative process. The educated ruled without being obstructed by the âsquabbles and conï¬icts of politicsâ from performing their historic task of catching up with the modern West, thus instituting âa modality of political power constituted outside the immediate political process itself.â10 Thus (economic) backwardness induced by colonial rule was the primary factor that this new ruling elite cited for its demand for self-rule. It presented its own case for occupying the position of command that was previously occupied by the foreign power so as to initiate the âadministration of developmentâ that the latter had not undertaken. In other words, the subjective desire of a people for freedom and self-government was subordinated to the objective necessity of economic development dictated by universal reason. The âsquabbles and conï¬icts of politicsâ was the medium in which the people would exercise their new found political freedom which was to be tolerated but not allowed to hamper the greater task of development. Thus it comes as no surprise that in independent India the paternalism of cultural policy in general and ï¬lm policy in particular remained unchanged. Like its colonial predecessors, the new ruling elite was enlightened enough to appreciate and enjoy freedom but insecure about the way this freedom would be handled by the masses. In continuation of the colonial gov- ernmentâs policy of not interfering in cultural aï¬airs, the new rulers sustained the censorship rules which were devised to cater to the communitiesâ demand for socio-moral self-governance. For its own ideological sustenance, this class produced, in certain popular forms of postcolonial discourse, an image of the people as a self-absorbed, innocent and essentially conservative (tra- ditional was of course the preferred term) population that needed (even if it did not demand it) to be protected from extreme sensory stimulation and unsupervised expressions of desire. While Chatterjee shows how it was the Gandhians, including Gandhi himself, who baulked at the protection from legislative oversight bestowed on the planning process controlled by the edu- cated class, in the sphere of culture the ruling elite found it expedient to adopt an essentially Gandhian-inspired conception of the Indian masses. Economic backwardness was supplemented by a cultural backwardness that required strict control especially over modern cultural produc- tion. In addition, the new ruling elite had also inherited the colonial governmentâs adjudicatory role between communities. Throughout the colonial period communities complained to the state about other communitiesâ cultural activitiesâamong which ï¬lms were an important itemâwhich oï¬ended their sensibilities. This was evidence of an embarrassing lack of fellow feeling among a population that was soon going to start a new life as one nation. Independence did not change the situation and may have even exacerbated it. Thus the ruling eliteâs adoption of the conservative approach to cultural policy (which went against its own professed love of modernity) may also have been the result of ï¬nding itself in the colonizerâs position in matters relating to inter-communal conï¬icts. That the cinema that catered to this population and served up entertainment laced with eroticism was treated as culturally backward and in need of strict control and prohibitive taxa- tion is thus a natural outcome of the dirigist stateâs thoroughgoing alienation from its own population compounded by the educated classâs own complete subjection to the ideological authority of the departed master who had taught them to love their own traditions. Inevitably, the stateâs own policies were marked by a backwardness that stemmed from its attempts to apply what was considered to be enlightened cultural policy in an imitative fashion, repeatedly failing in its attempts to get it right. Backwardness thus prevailed at all levels, wherever practices were 12\n\nP:30\n\nCultural backwardness to the age of imitation subject to measurement by a standard that was established as the norm. Filmmakers themselves were often caught up in this developmentalist ideologeme, expressing the desire to be done with the song and dance and lamenting the unpreparedness of the audience to move with the times. Critics helped by explaining away the character of Indian cinema by reference to every- thing from ancient Indian aesthetic theory to the Indian massesâ unique cultural tastes, unmindful of the glaring fact that Indian popular cinema was for several decadesâcoinciding with the era of protectionismâstuck in a time warp, repeatedly returning to the same set of plots popularized by European stage melodrama in the nineteenth century and refurbishing the attractions regularly from Hollywood and other sources. In other words, the popular ï¬lm form that dominated production for several decades and that has come to be identiï¬ed as quintes- sentially Indian was a combination of melodramatic plots updated with the latest attractions. Imitation as the way out of backwardness Melodrama is an idealist aesthetic form in the sense that its component elements tend to be ideas given human and social shape. No doubt these ideas are drawn from and have some degree of expressive relation to social reality but this relation is highly mediated. The elements acquire an independent set of relations with each other and constitute a stable structure in which other thrills and attractions can be included. As many commentators have shown, the melodrama externalizes internal moral conï¬icts and produces a repertoire of moral positions turned characters that can be combined in a number of ways to achieve novelty within repetition. Melodrama follows what Jacques RanciÃ¨re has termed a âregime of representation,â in that the performative situation is synchronized with social realities and is not insulated from them. Thus to take a simple example, characters who are socially superior are assigned dialogue in high classical prose while servants speak a rustic or hybrid dialect. The advent of realism disturbs this system of representation and coincides with the rise of capitalism and the emergence of individualism and the individual subject as author. Melodrama is, for all its heroic and celebrated practitioners from Pixerecourt to Manmohan Desai, not an institution that was meant to generate works of art attributable to authors. S.S. Vasan was speaking as an exemplary practitioner of the melodramatic art when he opined that stories were the collective property of humanity, an ocean from which anyone was free to help themselves. Realism and psychologism pose a double challenge to the melodramatic art and it is a well- known fact that after psychoanalysis and World War I, classical melodramatic narratives quickly descended into obsolescence in capitalist countries. What survives as melodrama in Hollywood cinemaâwomenâs melodrama for instanceâis marked by a compromise with realism. Indian cinema did not face the same threat of obsolescence and continued with the classical melodramatic plot right through the century.11 This form was subjected to many variations and indigenizing eï¬orts, resulting in a stable format that was in the end quite unique in spite of its many similarities to nineteenth-century melodrama. However, while it could freely borrow attractionsâsuspense elements, fashions, dance styles, romanceâfrom Hollywood and rejuve- nate itself regularly, it remained unaï¬ected by the realist turn that Hollywood had undergone. Realism in India thus became a state-supported aesthetic venture with the double purpose of culturally grasping the complexities and conï¬icts of the interior and developing a cinema that could represent the nation for other nations. A general culture of realism, however, implied not just a sociological or ethnographic documentation of the interior or a psychological portrayal of middle-class subjectivities but a concrete sense of the contemporary, the here and now, a registration of the reconstitution of social life by clock time. The time of melodrama was the time of generations. It could of course be argued that the Indian masses still lived in generational time and their participation in the daily routines of clock time is non-committal, and there 13\n\nP:31\n\nM. Madhava Prasad would be no denying the truth in that. What is of interest, however, is to observe and track the changes that have come into eï¬ect in the last few decades, breaking down generational time and relo- cating the narrative and the spectator in the time of economic ups and downs. What the analysis of PTKK above showed were the tribulations undergone by narrative form in a time of transition. In what follows I shall try to describe the general logic governing this transition. As I have noted above, the melodramatic plot was capable of ingesting and eï¬ectively disguising a borrowed element. Like a stolen object that is well concealed by the new assortment of objects among which it is placed, the borrowed elements in Indian popular ï¬lms (fragments of narrative borrowed from Hollywood being the most common) blended into the new environment in which they found themselves. Then a new trend started where borrowed elements con- tinued to undergo the same treatment but their size increased until entire ï¬lms were rendered in the âBollywoodâ style. This could no longer be concealed and soon television began to devote special programs to exposing such thefts, thus creating an ancillary entertainment form. However, there were already signs that a new relation between the borrower and the borrowed element was beginning to emerge that could displace the old one from its position of prominence. Today there is an entire segment of the industry that has come up in bits and pieces and is now widely recognized as something of a ânew new cinemaâ with all the makings of a movement. How does this cinema relate to its overseas inspirations? The way towards answering that question goes through the Bollywood phenomenon. To begin with let me point to some of the changes discernible in the big-budget commercial cinema. Over the last ten years or so, this cinema has become what I would call a reï¬exive commodity. In the era of global capital, everything undergoes a reï¬exive reconstitution, as social theorists have pointed out. The reï¬exivity of the commodity popular ï¬lm consists in this, that it is today being produced as an âIndianâ ï¬lm. The textual form is no longer a spontaneous reï¬ection of established cultural conventions but a self-conscious reproduction of its features. Today we no longer merely make song-and-dance ï¬lms; we make song-and-dance ï¬lms because we know that that is what is distinctive about our cinema. Such reï¬exivity is produced by the new visibility of Indian popular cinema in the world as a product distinct from its Hollywood big brotherâs products. In order to mark the diï¬erence while maintaining a ground for comparison, the term âBollywoodâ has come into currency. This reï¬exivity also serves another purpose: it preserves a sense of continuity while at the level of theme and treatment, substantial changes are introduced. There is a speciï¬c logic to these transformations at the level of content. There is, as already indicated, a tendency to treat the Hollywood cinema as a sort of platonic ideal against which the Bollywood product measures itself. This paradoxical structure is integral to the functionality of this cinema in the present. On the one hand, it maintains a formal continuity with the past in a reï¬exive resort to the familiar rhetorical features; on the other hand it displays an anxiety to be rid of the thematic and ideo- logical limitations of that earlier model, using Hollywood as a counter-model. We can see this at the level of characterization, language, the moral and social ideals propagated, and the settings for the drama. A new, more permissive morality is one common feature, but if we look closely, we ï¬nd that this is not proposed as an alternative against the old; it is simply assumed to be already current. Likewise with social mores, with styles of individualization, speech patterns, etc.âeverything takes place as if society had already changed, as if we lived in a new society. There is no doubt, too, that there is a subject being forged here, one that is oriented to a utopian future, the perfect model of which already exists in America and which enjoys the fantasy of pretending to be already located there. Then there is of course the whole remix phenomenon. This story begins with the songs from old ï¬lms, and I propose that even the ï¬lm remakes are better understood by reference to this remix 14\n\nP:32\n\nCultural backwardness to the age of imitation phenomenon, than by treating them as remakes in the old sense. The remix ï¬lms have that quality of being spruced up for a new generation, rather than remaking as a sign of a ï¬lm- makerâs reinterpretation. The fact that everything is referred to a new generation, rather than to the vision of a ï¬lmmaker, proves the point. Taken together, I think these two features point to a cultural problem that goes far deeper: the popular ï¬lm industry is unable to produce credible narratives grounded in the historical present. This is not a new problem, but in the past this inability was less visible because cinema was not under such pressure from social forces. Thus the remix ï¬lm is also an instance of reï¬exive commodiï¬cation, because it functions not as a narrative re-grounded in the present but as a product that attains salability by reference to its previous avatars. Another less prominent trend is towards a conscious re-education of the Indian population into the virtues of the new economy. Older narrative forms are employed but new twists are added to recommend new moral stances. Films of this kind are not always as successful (Baghban was an exception Laga chunari mein daag was not), but they highlight the existence of a missionary passion for the new world among mainstream ï¬lmmakers today. This is the social side of the age of imitation, which is not conï¬ned to the cinema but maybe simply being reï¬ected in it. Reï¬exivity combined with the tireless striving after a platonic ideal and always falling short of it seems to be the current fate of mainstream Indian popular cinema. What this amounts to is a singular failure of referentiality, the absence of any sense of location, of speciï¬city of place, of a recognizable indexing of social reality. There is, of course, a counter-trend within the popular. Seen against the above background, it is not surprising that this counter-trend is so overwhelmingly centered around the underworld. It is as if this sector were trying to make up for the absence of social grounding by going underground, as if the underbelly of the present order is some kind of absolute of social reality. Realism in todayâs commercial cinema is almost entirely equated with the world of gangsters. This has produced some memorable ï¬lms in recent times but I think that it is historically more important as a passageway to the kind of creative fragmentation that I will deal with presently. Notable features of this sector are the assimilation of ï¬lm styles, from Hong Kong and Holly- wood (e.g. Tarantino) and a camera more attentive to local detail, reveling in the representation of dirt and chaos, raw power and beastly behavior, teasing us with the threat of loss of narrative thread, an altogether new experience for Indian viewers. We are now quickly moving into the fragmented space of contemporary Indian (dare I say, non-Bollywood) cinema. A sense of space and an ability to map narrative onto space is one of the features of the new trends. The signiï¬cance of narrative as a measure of cultural identity cannot be overemphasized. Jameson called narrative a âsocially symbolic actâ and the inability to generate narratives from the ground we inhabit is a sign that we are still caught up in a melodramatic, idealist mode of narrative where broad schematic lines of conï¬ictâmoral, allegoricalâtend to dominate. Most âart ï¬lmsâ also tend to fall into this idealist trap. This is not about the need for narrative originalityâsome Italian neo-realist ï¬lms made use of non-Italian storiesâso much as a search for a relation between narrative and social space. Consider the two Shakespearean gangster movies, Maqbool and Omkara, in this context. They are attempting to do precisely this, to give the social material of our present a narrative form. This is not quite the same as the setting up of platonic ideals referred to above. It calls for the use of narrative frames to work on the material the present aï¬ords us. Let us also note the rise of the mixed-language (predominantly English) ï¬lms which seem to ï¬nd ways of narrativizing a limited but signiï¬cant part of our present social life. All in all, it could be said that while individually many of these new kind of ï¬lms are ulti- mately disappointing, collectively they constitute a phenomenon of historic proportions. We need to evaluate this trend in its entirety, against the historical background, rather than as individual works of creation. 15\n\nP:33\n\nM. Madhava Prasad In a recent ï¬lm like No Smoking we witness a virtuoso display of mastery of ï¬lm styles combined with a narrative experimentation that is breathtaking, even if it tends to run away into incoherence towards the end. In Johny Gaddar the retro mode does not yield a âremixâ of the kind mentioned above, but a more robust revisiting of the old with ï¬rmly contemporary motivations. There are instances, in Hindi, but also in other cinemas, of a quiet destitution of ï¬lm form (e.g. Autograph in Tamil) which signals a desire for simplicity and reï¬ection. Then there are the more problematic ï¬lms, e.g. Bheja Fry and Zinda, which seem to be shot-by-shot remakes of foreign originals. I want to dwell on this last instance a bit, because something about them may hold the clue to the operative paradigm here. The story of the Indian ï¬lm industryâs borrowing of plots and story ideas from Hollywood and other sources is an old one. An entire sector of ï¬lm journalism is devoted to exposing such unacknowledged debts. What interests me here is the changing nature of this indebtedness. In the past, the Bombay ï¬lm industry âborrowedâ or âstoleâ plots from other sources and processed them in its own mills, until the ï¬nal product was often unrecognizable. While journalistic lampooning of this phenomenon has little to teach us, there is an important cultural problematic embedded in it that needs to be brought to light. The new ï¬lmmakers no longer borrow or steal in the old sense. They seem rather to imitate. In general it could be said that imitation is the new modality in which Indian ï¬lmmakers are relating to world cinema. Let us now recall the platonic reference I made above. While Bolly- wood seems to be treating American society/Hollywood as its platonic ideal, for these new ï¬lmmakers it is the ï¬lm form that is the original to be copied, for subjective as much as for economic reasons. They are more interested in learning to make a âforeignâ ï¬lm than in making a typically Indian ï¬lm with a borrowed plot. It is necessary to comprehend the historical sig- niï¬cance of this changed picture, above and beyond the consideration of copyright issues. It is a change in subjectivity. This is an imitation that we need to learn to appreciate diï¬erently. It is a striving after a new grounding, parallel to the strivings in society to reground ourselves in the quicksands of the globalized present. Imitation is a step towards autonomy. Language and region today have a new importance in peopleâs lives. This seems contra- dictory, for after all globalization is supposed to uproot us from our social ground, to relocate us in the non-place of a globalized world where regional speciï¬cities are erased. However, look around and you will see that there is today a greater attention to the local. Manorama Six Feet Under is as good an instance of this as any. Here the contours of north Indian small town geo- graphy are salient to the unfolding of the plot. This too is a kind of fragmentation, one that I would evaluate positively. How this cinema will remain âIndianâ in the strictly nationalist sense is a diï¬cult question and one which in fact need not bother us that much. The forging of new subjects may be said to depend upon such fragmentation into communities where a measure of basic intelligibility is the basis for artistic production. This may also lead to the possibility of diï¬erent regions learning from each other and learning to work within their own domains with ideas derived from the work of others. A last point: todayâs Indian cinema is bold, unabashed in its acknowledgement of the integral place of the foreign in our psychic structure. The foreigner, especially the white person, stands in for the gaze of the master (e.g. Rangde Basanti), in a nation state that remains as yet unconstituted. The eï¬ects of the gaze remain long after the fact of colonialism, and denial is not the way to deal with it. For a long time we tried to assert our unique status in the assembly of nation states; we tried to play the role of nation with dignity, but it was never a smooth aï¬air. Popular cinema has always been less ashamed about the structural necessity of the Other to our sense of oneness. The ruling elite, on the other hand, which owes its existence to the colonial master and continues to serve it, is at pains to overstate Indiaâs exceptionality. The cinema, a modern cultural industry, has no 16\n\nP:34\n\nCultural backwardness to the age of imitation constitutive need to do so. Today the cinema continues this trend of acknowledgement of the foreignerâs necessity by imitation and idealization. I would point out that this is possibly the only way to escape from both the platonic bind and the postcolonial illusion. It is a time for the transformation of forms. The political form is the least amenable to change, but we can more readily discern in society, in culture, in the realm of ideology transfor- mations that are creeping steadily on. It is thus an overall formal rehabilitation that we must trace if we are to make sense of the movements underway in cinema. In order to better appreciate what is going on in cinema, we need to grasp the changes that are registered at the level of the diurnal in society. It is not viable to pose an aesthetic entrenchment to protect us against the cultural inroads of globalization. On the one hand, we cannot really be sure that a society like ours, with a resilient caste ideology, is not actually going through a positive phase of social transformation under pressure of the deterritorializing force of capital. Our socialist dreams have been more or less entirely ground into the dust by the pressure of competition for capital. In contemporary cinema, even when it is not dealing directly with the issues of the present, we see signs of a struggle to recover an enunciative position vis-Ã -vis this reality, and one of the modalities of this struggle is all- round imitation. In PTKK, the spectator was liberated from the position of backwardness by a jolt to his habits of reading, although it came at the price of a moral sleight of hand. The practices of social and aesthetic imitation that are everywhere visible in the cinema today constitute a comparable dynamic which participates in the reconstitution of Indian society along capitalist lines. Whether the subjective destitution and reconstitution that it both enables and reï¬ects will lead us out of backwardness or reinstitute another diï¬erent order of backwardness is an open question.

Mahajanâs camera unfolded and ï¬owed past on the screen, and the grave tones of Mallikaâs monologue communicated not only her deep pain and the emptiness of her life, but a weighing down of the self,1 a sense of the excitement that in the 1970s had been associated with a new cinematic practice communicated itself very strongly to some in the auditorium. The occasion was a commemorative retrospective to honor Mani Kaul;2 the four-hundred-seat auditorium was almost full, and there seemed a terrible irony in this reception of his work after his premature death from cancer in July 2011. This screening of Ashad ka ek Din forty years after it was made not only underlined its almost non-existent circulation in the period in between, but also the unavailability of most ï¬lms of the ânew cinemaâ or the New Wave movement3 made during the 1970sâ80s that have remained out of reach despite the present digital revolution. Ashad ka ek Din represents not only the radical, experimental edge of the Indian New Wave, but also the destiny of a number of its ï¬lms that while made successfully were not released. Mani Kaulâs death, the obituaries hailing him as a âpioneerâ of the ânew Indian cinemaâ (Gupta 2011: 10), and the commemorative retrospectives seemed to bring into sharp focus the enthusiastic investment in cinematic experimentation not only by the high priests of an avant-garde experimental cinemaâemblematically represented by Kaul himself and Kumar Shahani, but also by several others of the movement. If cinematic experimentation and new forms of ï¬lm narration deï¬ned one characteristic of this cinema, the other was cinematic realism, both of form and content, evident in a number of the early ï¬lms: Mrinal Senâs Bhuvan Shome, Basu Chatterjiâs Sara Akash, Kantilal Rathodâs Kanku, all from 1969, Pattabhi Rama Reddyâs Samskara (1970), Rajendra Singh Bediâs Dastak (1970), M.S. Sathyuâs Garm Hawa (1973), and Avtar Kaulâs 27 Down (1973), among many others. The ânew Indian cinemaâ that these ï¬lms inaugurated was clearly connected to a con- cern with aesthetics, to a seriousness of intent, and to a representation of social issues with a drive towards an understanding of reality in all its complexities, contradictions and ambiguities, necessary, it was believed, for the transformation of society. A missionary zeal was thus obvious in the work of a lot of the Indian New Wave directors who focused on the ills of Indian society: poverty; social injustice; the inherent violence of social structures evidenced in the modalities of entrenched feudal power; the oppressive stranglehold of the orthodoxies of tradi- tion; and the brutal subjugation and exploitation of lower castes and women. As a critical 19\n\nP:37\n\nIra Bhaskar movement with a âsocial conscienceâ (Das Gupta 1982: 16), the New Wave believed that it had a political role to play at a crucial juncture of national history. What is remarkable about this moment of cinematic history is the tremendous diversity of forms that this new cinema generated. Launched by the investment made by the Film Finance Corporation (FFC), the movement burgeoned into what came to be seen as a wave of oï¬beat, artistic cinema. At the same time, it was not as if the ï¬lms shared political or aesthetic ideologies or positions, marked as they were by an immense variety of concerns and styles. Yet, there were common responses and larger approaches that were evident in the work that was ï¬nanced by the FFC and a few others during this period, which can be seen as constituting an aesthetic and cultural movement. These were a rejection of the values, forms, performance modes and the style of mainstream, commercial cinema that privileged entertainment values, spectacular display and melodrama; a vision of cinema as an expressive art form; an inspiration from and a sense of connectedness to a larger and âserious international artistic enterpriseâ (Binford 1987: 148); and what can be termed in a general sense, a realist projectâone that is motivated by the drive to know and represent the world adequately. At the same time, the realist project in this larger sense is not to be equated only with cinematic realism, for the project of addressing reality in its broadest sense did inspire varied aesthetic forms demonstrating that the impulse to engage reality could undergird diï¬erent aesthetic expressions from cinematic realism to mod- ernism. The New Wave ï¬lms were extremely diverse, and ranged from realist portrayals of contemporary Indian reality, especially the reality of small town and village India to experi- mental and modernist work that foregrounded abstraction and stylization. Focusing on and working with space, depth, volume, color, duration and temporality were as important to some of the ï¬lmmakers, as a concern with themes like in-built oppressive structures of society, the ingrained violence of gender and caste relations, or the struggle with repressive patriarchal norms were to others. At the same time, it was not as if representations of social reality, or auteurist cinematic experimentation had not existed before. From the 1930s there had been a concern with pro- gressive social causes that the diï¬erent ï¬lm studios in Bombay (Ranjit Movietone, Bombay Talkies), Calcutta (New Theatres), Pune (Prabhat) and Madras had demonstrated. There were also several ï¬lmmakers even within the mainstream industries from the 1930s to 1950s like V. Shantaram, Guru Dutt, Raj Kapoor, Mehboob Khan and Bimal Roy, to name just a few from Bombay, whose work reï¬ected a concern with cinematic art. Moreover, most signiï¬cantly, from the 1950s there had been a parallel art cinema represented by the work of Satyajit Ray, Mrinal Sen and Ritwik Ghatak. In fact, it is the work and the international reputation of Satyajit Ray that was held up as an inspiration to be emulated by anyone who aspired towards âgoodâ cinema.4 However, what represented a new impetus in the late 1960s was the scale and volume of oï¬beat ï¬lms that seemed to emerge suddenly as a new kind of cinema that had been made possible by the intervention of a government initiative in the form of the FFC. This brings one to the FFC story. Set up in 1960 on the recommendation of the S.K. Patil Film Enquiry Committee Report of 1951, the FFC was initially meant to aid the ï¬lm industry, and had by 1968 funded over ï¬fty ï¬lms by established and reputed ï¬lmmakers, notably Ray who had three FFC ï¬lms in the 1960s (Rajadhyaksha 2009: 233). However, by 1968 the situation was dire since, as B.K. Karanjia puts it, âalmost the entire paid up capital had been eroded,â and unable to compete with commercial ï¬lmmakers as far as the box oï¬ce was concerned, âthe race was lost before it was runâ (Karanjia 1988: 6). A change in course was desperately needed, and Karanjia as the new Chairman of the FFC, acting on an earlier suggestion made by Mrs Gandhi while she was the Information and Broadcasting Minister in 1964 (Prasad 1998: 122), took certain crucial decisions: 20\n\nP:38\n\nThe Indian New Wave to ï¬nance low-budget ï¬lms, preferably but not necessarily in black and white â¦ to sponsor talented and promising newcomers from the Film Institute or outside and â¦ to ï¬lm the works of our own eminent writers in Hindi and the national languages.5 (Karanjia 1988: 6) It is this âformulaâ that Karanjia believes launched âthe New Wave in Indian Cinema.â Karanjiaâs new policy provided ï¬nance, among others, to newcomer Mani Kaul from the Film Institute, Bengali ï¬lmmaker Mrinal Sen for his ï¬rst ï¬lm in Hindi, and newcomers Basu Chatterji and Kantilal Rathod. It is thus that 1969 saw the birth of the Indian New Wave with the completion of their ï¬lms, Uski Roti, Bhuvan Shome, Sara Akash and Kanku respectively. A look at the early ï¬lms that were radically diï¬erent, both thematically and formally, from contemporary ï¬lmmaking practices will indicate clearly the characteristics of this new cinema, and the reasons for the discourses they generated. Shot on location, with mostly unknown actors and new fresh faces, these ï¬lms were inventive and formally experimental. Based upon a short story by Banaphool, Mrinal Senâs Bhuvan Shome is a playful satirical comedy about the humanizing of a self-righteous, oï¬cious, Westernized, colonial railway bureaucrat who encounters the reality of his postcolonial nation when he decides to take a bird-shooting holi- day away from his oppressive oï¬ce routine. In the process, and through his encounter with a buï¬alo that chases him, and the village girl Gauri, not only does Shome realize that his position and power are completely useless in the alien environment of the village, but he also becomes a diï¬erent man. Senâs comic form is heightened by the use of jump-cuts, freeze frames and an extremely innovative use of animation that hilariously undermines the pomposity of Shome. Shot in Saurashtra, the ï¬lm seemed to reveal completely new visions of social reality to its audiences. Similarly, Chatterjiâs Sara Akash based on Rajendra Yadavâs novella and shot on location in a middle-class neighborhood in Agra brought to the screen an everyday reality that though known was one that had been hardly represented. In a stylized opening credits sequence, as the camera tracks through the streets of the town, the ï¬lm evokes not only the constricting physical contours of the spaces within which the narrative of newlyweds in a joint family is set, but also the claustrophobia that the young bride Prabha will feel in her married home. She encounters the hostility of the women towards her education, but also the awkward and virulent indiï¬er- ence of her young husband who is unable to deal with his feelings of having compromised his education, or understand his own sexuality. In this ï¬rst ï¬lm, Chatterji is extremely experimental in his camerawork, his use of lenses and his spatial imagination. The ï¬attening of space and the distortion of facial contours in the extreme close-ups of the telephoto lens used to foreground Samarâs internal self-conï¬ict, or the shots of the narrow by-lanes of the area in which Samar and Prabhaâs home is located, or the sense of the middle-class neighborhood evoked in long shot vistas of the small town from the terrace of the family home were all new to the cinema of the time. Even though the thematic concerns of this ï¬lm resurfaced later in Chatterjiâs middle- class urban dramas, the look and the form of Sara Akash did not reappear in what followed. The freshness of themes, the adaptation of literary material especially from the Nai Kahani movement, the use of real locations and mostly unknown actors, the evocation of the everyday, and most signiï¬cantly, an experimentation with cinematic form that is evident in Bhuvan Shome and Sara Akash is also fundamental to Kaulâs Uski Roti. Yet while all these elements are common, the austerity of Kaulâs form, the slowness of tempo, the lack of music, the sparse dialogue and non-dramatic dialogue delivery all make for a minimalism that not only seemed very diï¬erent from the other two ï¬lms, but also identiï¬ed Kaul as the emblematic experimental avant-garde ï¬lmmaker to have emerged in 1969. Based on Mohan Rakeshâs short story, Uski 21\n\nP:39\n\nIra Bhaskar Roti is set in rural Punjab and is about Baloâs wait at a bus stop for her husband to collect his meal as he passes by. It is clear that Kaul responds to the dramatization of interior consciousness that Rakeshâs modernist story attempted in the literary form; however, the cinematic rendering of Baloâs interiority led Kaul to a diï¬erent experimentâto explore the meaning of temporality on the one hand and that of space, both external and internal, on the other. Kaul explains his technique in Uski Roti where he conï¬ned the ï¬lm to two lenses, a 28mm wide angle lens and a 135mm telephoto lens, âmaking them represent the actual and mental life of the waiting wife in the beginning of the ï¬lm.â He goes on to say: Having faithfully established this as a norm, the lenses were gradually freed of the strict representationâthey were crossing each other in the middle of the ï¬lm where the distinctions were blurredâuntil in the end the representation was reversed, with the result that the actual return of the husband almost appears as a hallucination â¦ This slight edge of disbelief in the reality of an actual return of her husband gives rise to an ambiguity, almost necessary for a scene to redeem itself of the physical covering and reveal the conceptual meaning. (Kaul 1974: 10) It is clear that for Kaul the discipline of cinema was one that almost resisted the iconic relationship of the camera to the real world, a tension that for him was essential for getting at the kernel of his concept. At the same time, his cinema gave us sheer visual poetry in the images he created; for instance, the image of Balo waiting for Sucha at the bus stop conveys a deep stillness of being, of her commitment and devotion to her relationship, and yet of an abhav (lack) that she isnât quite aware of or knows how to address. The stillness of the image and the tempo of the ï¬lm convey the experience of duration, of time as it seems to stand still. Figure 3.1 Waiting at the bus stop, Balo in Uski Roti.

In this and in all the work that was to follow, Kaul continued to explore visually and aurally how cinematic discipline would enable one to plumb the depths of the inner being, strike the appropriate emotional note and sensitize one to the signiï¬cances of our being in the world. All these three ï¬lms were stunningly shot by K.K. Mahajan, who went on to do a lot of work with the New Wave ï¬lmmakers. Much to the surprise of the industry both Bhuvan Shome, which was released in a morning show where it ran for several months, and Sara Akash, which was released after an initial delay, did well at the box oï¬ce. Uski Roti had a limited morning show release but made an impact on the ï¬lm society and international ï¬lm festival circuits and won the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Movie the following year. The enthusiasm of that moment and the mood of the times can be seen in Mrinal Senâs description of the âremarkableâ performance of the FFC in the three years from 1968, in having ï¬nanced ï¬lms that were âfresh, unconventional, dissenting, icono- clasticâ and which by conventional standards would be considered ânon-marketableâ (Sen 1971: 31). The excitement among the ï¬lmmakers was palpable, for suddenly the dreams of several young people seemed translatable into reality. The signiï¬cance of the FFC was thus literalâin the ï¬lms it made possibleâbut it was also more symbolic in that it generated a certain con- ï¬dence about cinematic possibilities. Moreover, the critical and popular impact of the ï¬lms created an excitement about a new kind of art cinema. As Bikram Singh pointed out then, âthe most heartening thing is that the ânew,â âparallel,â âcounterââcall them what you willâï¬lms are being discussed with the kind of seriousness and enthusiasm which Indian cinema has perhaps never before receivedâ (Singh 1973: 33).6 That this was a moment when the exposure to international cinema through ï¬lm festivals and the circulation of world ï¬lm classics through the ï¬lm society movement had created an audience that valued cinematic art and desired a similar intervention in the Indian cinematic scene is evident from the Manifesto of the New Cinema Movement that was written in 1968 by Mrinal Sen, the chairman, and Arun Kaul, a ï¬lm society enthusiast and the chief pro- moter of this movement. The FFC âlow budget art ï¬lmâ (Nadkarni 1970) thus made pos- sible what t"
