        "text": "Rawal Jaitra Singh 1213 - 1252 CE\n\nHe succeeded Rawal Padam Singh. He is mentioned as the ruler of Mewar in the Shree Eklingnathji stone inscription of Vikram Samvat 1270 and the Charbhuja temple inscription of Nandesama dated Vikram Samvat 1279. He is known to have raised the prestige of the state by his interstate activities. As mentioned in Ghasa (Chittor) inscription dated Vikram Samvat 1317 and Chirwa inscription dated Vikram Samvat 1330, Jaitra Singh safeguarded Mewar from Malwa, Gujarat, Marwar, Sakambari, and Sultans of Delhi and defeated Chauhan Udai Singh of Jalore and Nadol. According to the Chirwa inscription, Jaitra Singh defeated the Chalukya ruler Tribhuvan of Gujarat at Kotada. Also, according to Chirwa inscription when Sultan Illtutmish attacked Mewar, in the battle of Bhutala, the capital city of Nagda was destroyed by the Sultan and he was later defeated by Rawal Jaitra Singh. After this incident, he shifted the capital of Mewar to Chittor permanently. He fortified the City of Chittor, adding new bastions and administration of the city was improved. It also mentions that the Vagad area was controlled by the descendents of Rawal Samant Singh (r. 1172-1179 CE) under the ruler Sihad and captured Arthuna in present Banswara from the Parmar Jai Singh II of Malwa with the help of Rawal Jaitra Singh. The Mewar-Parmar conflict is also confirmed by the manuscript of Paksikavritti written in Vikram Samvat 1309 by Jain Muni Padmashri Jinavijaya. According to Kumbhalgarh inscription dated Vikram Samvat 1517, Rawal Jaitra Singh was the ruler of Chitrakut(Chittor), Medpat, Vagad and Aghatpur (Ahar), which he recaptured from the Chalukyas of Gujarat. The Hamir Mad Mardan of Jaisingh Suri dated Vikram Samvat 1286 mentions the courage of Rawal Jaitra Singh, as he did not wait for the help of Chalukya rulers of Gujarat during the invasion of Iltutmish. A contemporary Jain text of Shresti Ralha accounts a grand Deeksha Mahotsav at Chittor in Vikram Samvat 1288 and the prosperity in Mewar during the time of Rawal Jaitra Singh. Rawal Jaitra Singh is also mentioned in Abu stone inscription dated Vikram Samvat 1342 and Ranpur Stone inscription dated 1496.\n\nRawal Tej Singh 1252 - 1273 CE\n\nHe succeeded his father Rawal Jaitra Singh. As mentioned in Chirwa inscription dated Vikram Samvat 1330 (1273 CE), Rawal Tej Singh came into conflict with the Baghela ruler Visaldev (predecessors of Chalukyas of Gujarat). He also fought with Balban, Sultanate of Delhi. In 1253-54 CE, Balban had been dismissed to his Iqta (Jagir) of Nagore by Delhi Sultanate; he tried to repair his fortunes by attacking the Hindu Kingdom of Chittor, Bundi and Ranthambore but he had no success. Balban again attacked Mewar in 1255-56 CE when Rawal Tej Singh gave shelter to Qutlugh Khan from Delhi Sultanate. A battle was fought outside the Fort of Chittorgah as recorded in the Chirwa inscription of Vikram Samvat 1330. Two Mewar generals were killed in this battle but Rawal Tej Singh remained victorious controlling Chittor. The Jatashankar inscription preserved in Nagpur museum also gives the same reference. According to Ghasa inscription dated Vikram Samvat 1317 and the Gudela Tank inscription dated Vikram Samvat 1317; Rawal Tej Singh refers to the grant for the maintenance of the temple of Tripurushadeva near Chirwa and barley crop grant for the same temple. During his reign Chittor became the center of Jainism, where eminent scholars like Ratnaprbha Suri, Pradyumana Suri practiced their scholastic pursuits. Jayatalladevi, Rawal Tej Singh’s Queen got constructed the temple of Shyam Parshawnath at Chittor. Another queen of Rawal Tej Singh, Chauhan Chachigadeva Sonagara’s daughter Rupadevi of Jalore, after the demise of Rawal Tej Singh in Vikram Samvat 1340 got constructed a step-well at Badhutara in Marwar. According to the Kadmal plates of Vikram Samvat 1316, Rawal Tej Singh gave the grant of Shavilar Bhumi on Solar inscription. Rawal Tej Singh is also mentioned in Abu stone inscription dated Vikram Samvat 1342 and Tejaswi Singh in Ranpur Stone inscription dated 1496 along with Kumbhalgarh Stone Inscription dated Vikram Samvat 1517.\n\nRawal Samar Singh 1273 CE - 1302 CE\n\nHe succeeded his father Rawal Tej Singh. According to Abu stone inscription dated VS 1342 (1285 CE), it is stated that Rawal Samar Singh helped the Gujarat ruler Sarangdev Baghela along with the Rawal Patta Parmar of Abu against a Muslim invasion, this fact is also supported by the Patnarayan inscription found at Girwar (Sirohi district) of Vikram Samvat 1344. Rawal Samar Singh captured Chandravati from the Parmars of Abu as mentioned in the Chittor inscription dated Vikram Samvat 1358, which was later captured by Visaldev of Chandravati. At Abu, Rawal constructed a Jain Math with a gold staff as mentioned in the Abu inscription. As mentioned in ‘ Vividh Tirthkalpa’ by Jinprabha Suri, the next attack on Samar Singh was from Allauddin Khilji. Khilji sent his younger brother Ulugh Khan to attack on Mewar and Rawal Samar Singh saved Chittor diplomatically, by giving Khilji’s army passage to Gujarat but in the journey they destroyed temples at Delwara, Eklingji and Nagda. There are 8 important stone inscriptions of Rawal Samar Singh- one found from Chirwa dated Vikram Samvat 1330 mentions the genealogical information from Bappa Rawal to reign of Rawal Samar Singh along with major geneological information about the Talrakshak (Kotwal) family of Chittor and Nagda. The Chittor inscription found at Mahasatiya ji near Kirti (Vijay) Stambh dated Vikram Samvat 1331, displays the genealogical information from Bappa Rawal to Rawal Narvarma. The Chittor inscription dated 1344 of Rawal Samar Singh is dedicated to the grant of Vaidhyanath Shiv temple near the pond constructed by Chitrang Mori. The Dariba temple grant inscription dated Vikram Samvat 1356 of Rawal Samar Singh states the donation of 16 Drammas. Education and religion prevailed during the time of Rawal Samar Singh in Chittor. A Deeksha Mahotsav was organized by Jinaprabodh Suri during his rule. A Devkula was constructed at Shantinath temple during his reign, as mentioned in the Chittor inscription of Vikram Samvat 1356. The Jain Kirti Stambh constructed by Jija Bagherwal was also completed during the reign of Rawal Samar Singh by his son Punya Singh as mentioned in the stone inscription of the consecration ceremony of Kirti Stambh dated Vikram Samvat 1357. Rawal Samar Singh is also mentioned in Ranpur Stone inscription dated 1496 and Kumbhalgarh Stone Inscription dated Vikram Samvat 1517.\n\nRawal Ratan Singh 1302-1303 CE\n\nRatan Singh was the son of Rawal Samar Singh. When he ascended the throne of Mewar in 1302 CE, Sultan Allauddin Khilji had already decided to subjugate the other states. The main motive for the attack on Mewar must have been political and strategic; though there might have been other reasons, like economic and commercial, as Mewar had abundance of silver and zinc deposits (which were used for making the armoury). Also Banas valley provided a good route to Gujarat. In 1299 CE, the forces of Allauddin while going to Gujarat, passed through Mewar and devastated Delawara, Eklingji and Ahar. For conducting effective incursions in Central India and the Deccan, his possession over Chittor and Malwa would be very helpful. Many historic chronicles like Nainsi ki Khyat, Jayasi’s Padmawat, Tarikh-i-Farishta and Rajaprasasthi, ascribe the attack on Chittor to Allauddin’s infatuation for Queen Padmini. These kinds of brutalities of Allauddin can also be witnessed through the capture of Rani Kamla Devi of Gujarat, who was forced to live in his harem after the defeat of her husband Rai Karan Baghel. According to the records by Amir Khusrav, the Sultan started from Delhi on January 28, 1303 and pitched his imperial pavilion between Bedach and Gambhiri rivers. After failing to carry the fort by assault, he decided to wait. After seven months of patience, the Mewar army came out and fought with valour and the brave women of Mewar including Rani Padmini sacrificed themselves, by carrying herself and jumping into holy flames of Jauhar to protect their dignity. Chittor got into the hands of the Sultan, which was governed by his son Khizra Khan and was named Khizrabad. Allauddin’s name mentioned as the ruler of Chittor found in a fragmentary stone inscription of Jama Masjid at Chittor. According to Nenasi, Allauddin appointed Maldev Sonagara (ruler of Merta) as the governor of Chittor. After the death of Maldev, the governorship of Chittor transferred to his son and successor, but he could not retain it for a long time. Rawal Ratan Singh is mentioned in Kumbhalgarh Stone Inscription dated Vikram Samvat 1517.\n\nMaharana Hameer Singh I 1326 - 1364 CE\n\nWith the fall of Chittor after the battle with Allaudin Khilji in 1303 CE, the elder branch of the Guhil family, i.e. the Rawal branch had no successor left; the junior branch of Guhil family, Ranas of Sisoda village then took over the inheritance. Only, one son of Sisodia line, named Ajay Singh survived with the son of his elder brother Ari Singh and had to taken shelter in the hilly tract of Kelwara. When he died, his nephew Hameer Singh succeeded to his title of Rana, with an intense determination to restore the independence of Mewar.\n\nHe conducted continuous raids on imperial army posted in Mewar and succeeded in desolating its central plains. According to Shree Eklingnath ji temple inscription dated Vikram Samvat 1545, mentioned Hameer Singh captured Jilawara from Raghavadeva and defeated some Bhil chiefs, when he was living at Kelwara. He also defeated Raja Jaitkaran of Idar and secure the Mewar territory from Gujarat. After the consolidated his position Hameer recaptured the Chittor. According to Kareda Jain temple inscription dated Vikram Samvat 1392 and Kot-Solankiyan Godawar stone inscription dated Vikram Samvat 1393 mentions Sonagara Banvir, the son of Maldeva, as the ruler of Chittor, probably the date of Hameer’s occupation of Chittor fort is 1337 CE from the decedents of Maldev Chauhan. Though the major part of Hameer’s history is shrouded in bardic lores, he was the real founder of the glory of Mewar. In order to make his position formidable he made alliances and waged wars to extend the frontiers of his kingdom. His amazing success against the Minas of Bundi and Chauhans made the rulers of Marwar, Amber, Bundi, Gwalior, Raisen, Chanderi and Kalpi recognize his leadership and political influence. During his reign, the temple of Rupanarayan and Eklingji were renovated. Maharana got constructed the temple, probably Shree Annapurna Mata, and pond in the fort of Chittor. Maharana Hameer’s one copper plate was found at Akola Village, dating Vikram Samvat 1420. He is also majorly mentioned in Shree Eklingnath Stone inscription dated Vikram Samvat 1545, Ranpur Stone inscription dated 1496 and Kumbhalgarh Stone Inscription dated Vikram Samvat 1517.\n\nMaharana Kheta Singh 1364 - 1382 CE\n\nAfter the demise of Maharana Hameer Singh I, his elder son Kheta Singh set on the throne of Mewar in 1364 CE. Maharana Kheta Singh continued the traditions and fought many battles. According to Kumbhalgarh stone inscription dated Vikram Samvat 1517 (1460 CE) and Eklingnath Prashsti dated Vikram Samvat 1545 (1489 CE), he annexed Mandalgarh. From there, he went towards the east and defeated and brought into submission the Hadas of Bundi. According to Menal Stone inscription dated Vikram Samvat 1446, Hada’s were maintaining good relations with the Mewar. Hada Mahadev fought with Mewar army against Amin Shah of Malwa. Maharana also undertook an expedition against Ranmal, ruler of Idar and imprisoned him and appointed Punja, son of Ranmal, as the ruler of Idar. According to Shringi-Rishi inscription dated Vikram Samvat 1485, he vanquished Dilawar Khan Ghori, also known by the name of Amin Shah of Malwa. He was the governor of Malwa later on he became an independent ruler. He launched an expedition over Chittor, Maharana’s army defeated and captured Amin Shah at Bakrol (Hamirgarh), nearly 20 miles away from Chittor. The earliest reference to this incident is available in Menal Stone inscription and Kumbhalgarh Stone inscription dated Vikram Samvat 1517. In 1382 CE, Maharana Kheta took last breath. Maharana Kheta was presented the Panwad village to Shree Eklingnathji temple. Maharana’s one stone inscription was found at Shree Sitala Mata temple, Gogunda Village. Another Stone inscription dated Vikram Samvat 1431, found at Jain temple of Dhuleva, mentions that Jain merchant Vija’s son Haradan got that temple repaired in his reign.\n\nMaharana Lakha 1382 - 1421 CE\n\nHe was the eldest son of Maharana Kheta who succeeded to the throne of Mewar in 1382 CE. Maharana Lakha had to face an invasion of Zafar Khan, the subedar of Gujarat. According to Nizamuddin Ahmad and Farishta (Islamic Historian), Zafar Khan’s army marched near to western border of Mewar, instead of Mandalgarh and Mandu. Probably, this invasion was for Matsyendra Durg (the present fort of Kumbhalgarh). However, there was no permanent impact of this invasion and Mewar army soon recaptured the place. Later on Maharana gave more attention to the defence of the territory. According to Nadlai Stone inscription dated Vikram Samvat 1443, Maharana Lakha managed to capture the territory of Godwar. Another, two inscription of his reign has been found in this area. One dated Vikram Samvat 1468 mentions the installation of iron stuff in the temple of Achleshwar at Mount Abu. This staff was prepared at Ghanerao, which formed part of his state. Other inscription dated Vikram Samvat 1475 is incised in a Jain temple at Kot-Solankiyan. According to Kumbhalgarh Stone inscription dated Vikram Samvat 1517, he also paid attention to suppress the rebellion of Medas, living in the hilly region of Badnor. Maharana Lakaha’s Mother, Rajamata went to Dwarika, she had to face a sudden attack of robbers. The Dodia chiefs extended necessary help and escorted the party. On hearing whole incident, Maharana invited the Dodia Dhaval to settle in Mewar and granted him a Jagir of Masuda. During the reign of Maharana Lakha, excavation of silver mines at Zawar added to the prosperity of Mewar. Delwara, situated on the north-west trade route, came into prominence and developed as trade and commerce centre of Mewar. Maharana Lakha took personal interest in inviting merchants to settle Mewar. According to Jain literary sources, Ramdeva, Nimba, Visal, Megh, Kelha, Bhim, Katuk were conducting their business successfully at that place. According to Shringi-Rishi stone inscription dated Vikram Samvat 1485; Maharana Lakha got the religious Hindu centers Benaras, Prayag and Gaya emancipated from the levy of pilgrim-taxes by paying off a lump sum amount in gold. Maharana also gave a patronage of cultural activity. Joting Bhatt and his brother Dhaneshwar were his court poets, who were given villages in jagir. Maharana also got constructed tanks at Chittor, Kelawara and Lakhawali. During his reign, Banjara Chhitar constructed the lake pichola at Girwa valley. Maharana Lakha was worthily upholded the tradition by waging wars against Mers, Bhils and the Turks. Thus, he made the mountainous regions and the frontiers of Mewar free from the rival chiefs. He also took a great interest in economical activity, thus Mewar became financially strong.\n\nMaharana Mokal 1421 - 1433 CE\n\nMokal succeeded his father Maharana Lakha. By a strange incident Lakha’s eldest son Chunda had to forego his right of succession. The Rathore Chief Rao Ranmal of Mandore sent an offer of marriage of his sister Hansabai for Chunda, the heir of Mewar, however there was some miscommunication and Hansabai got married to Maharana Lakha. Chunda selflessly abdicated his birth right for the male issue through the new marriage. After the death of Maharana Lakha, Mokal succeeded in 1421 CE, however as he was a minor Chunda looked after affairs of the state. There were differences between Chunda and Rajmata so she asked Rao Ranmal to interfere in Mewar. In this way, the arrival of Rao Ranmal greatly influenced the royal family of Mewar. Eventually, the influence of Rathores predominated during his reign and circumstances compelled Kanwar Chunda left Mewar for Mandu. The nobles of Mewar were not happy with it.\n\nMaharana Mokal successfully campaigned against Firoz Khan of Nagaur. According to Gorishankar tank inscription dated 1437 CE, found at Narena, Maharana Mokal had invaded the towns namely, Narena, Sambhar, Didwana and captured them. According to Shringi Rishi stone inscription dated Vikram Samvat 1485, mentioned Ahmad Shah of Gujarat invaded Idar, Kelawara and Matsyendra Durg (the present fort of Kumbhalgarh). However, he had remained unsuccessful in dislodging the fort. Maharana Mokal’s daughter Lala Mewari was married to Achaldas Khinchi of Gagron. When Hoshang Shah Gori of Malwa invaded Gagron, he sent his son Dhir for getting reinforcement from Mewar. But unfortunately, before arrival of this help, the fort fell into the hand of the invader. Lala Mewari performed Jouhar with other ladies present in the fort. According to Shree Eklingji Stone inscription dated Vikram Samvat 1545, Maharana Mokal emerged victorious battle fought at Jahazpur against Hada’s of Bundi. In 1432 CE, Ahmad Shah of Gujarat attacked Nagaur and Mewat. His force devastated the important towns Ahar, Eklingji, Delwara and the temples were also destroyed in Mewar. Maharana Mokal encamped at Talahati of Chittor to make preparation for battle against the Gujarat invading forces. At that time Chacha and Mera accompanied with Mahpa Panwar made sudden attack on his camp and assassinated him in 1433 CE. Yogeshwar and Bhatt Vishnu were the scholars who were in the court of Maharana Mokal along with famous sculptors - Manna, Fanna and Visal. He also erected massive forts and ramparts and repaired Samdhishwar temple at Chittor and constructed ramparts at Shree Eklingnath ji temple. Maharana also constructed the Dwarikanath Vishnu temple and tank at Chittor. Maharana Mokal also celebrated Tuladan and constructed several lakes to facilitate irrigation. Maharana’s one stone inscription found at Bijasanmata temple, Singholi dated Vikram Samvat 1477. Another inscription dated Vikram Samvat 1478 is incised in the Shantinath temple of Zawar. According to Shringi-Rishi stone inscription dated Vikram Samvat 1485; Maharana Mokal had weighed himself against the gold and silver more than 25 times. Samiddheshwar temple inscription of the same year mentions the renovation of the temple.\n\nMaharana Kumbha 1433 - 1468 CE\n\nMaharana Kumbhkaran (Kumbha) was an able ruler, erudite scholar, religious person, a great warrior and an architectural expert. He was born to Maharana Mokal and Maharani Sobhagaya Devi in 1417 CE at Deogarh, Madaria. Because of the continuous rivalry between the two groups supporting Kanwar Chunda and Rao Ranmal of Mandore, Maharana Mokal was brutally assassinated. After his death, his son Kumbha sat on the throne in 1433 CE at Chittor.\n\nAfter his coronation, Maharana Kumbha decided to avenge the assassination of his father. With the help of his allies, notable among was Rao Ranmal Rathore who played a vital role in this. With his support, Maharana Kumbha exterminated or banished all the conspirators involved in the brutal act. When Maharana Kumbha was coronated, his rule was limited to Chittorgarh and surrounding villages. Soon due to his military skills, territories of Mewar were extended upto Abu, Gagron, Mandsaur, till Kanthal in the South, Ranthambore, Amber and Chatsu in the East, Sapadlaksh territories, Pokran and Falaudi in the North along with Basantgarh and Pindwara in the West. Nagaur in the North - East, Gujarat in the South-West, and Malwa in the South were continuously engaged in wars for territorial expansions with Mewar, however Maharana Kumbha strongly strengthened Mewar in this adversity and Mewar state was expanded and established as a vast kingdom during his reign.\n\nRao Ranmal was very powerful during the reign of Maharana Mokal. When Kumbha sat on the thrown, Nagaur was ruled by Feroz Khan, Jalore by Pathan Hasan Khan, the area of Hadoti was under the Hada Chauhan Rao Berisal (influenced by Malwa) and Sirohi was under Rao Sahasmal (influenced by Gujarat). All these kingdoms aimed for territorial expansions and continued their campaign against Mewar. Maharana Kumbha's first battle was with Sirohi. He was helped by Rao Ranmal Rathore and the Mewar army was headed by Dodia Nar Singh in 1437 CE. In this campaign, Mewar territory was extended to Pindwara, Basantgarh, Nandiya, all bordering with the boundary of Mewar. (Reference: Copper Plate found at village Nandiya dated year 1437 CE). He defeated Maharawal Gopal of Dungarpur. He also strengthened boundaries of Mewar which were shared with Gujarat by conquering areas around South - Western parts of Mewar. In year 1439 CE, Maharana Kumbha captured Mandalgarh and Amargarh in Bundi (Hadoti). In his next campaign, Kumbha gained suzerainty over Nagaur's ruler and seized Sambhar and Didwana. According to Kirti Stambh and Kumbhalgarh inscriptions, Amber and Ranthambore were attacked by the Sultan of Delhi and Kumbha helped them to regain their kingdoms.He also annexed Narena, Khatu, Chatsu and Toda.\n\nMewar shared its North-Western boundaries with Nagaur, South-Western boundaries with Gujarat and Southern boundaries with Malwa. All three of them tried to attack Mewar because of their territorial ambitions. In addition to that, all these kingdoms kept giving refuge to revolting nobles who made the situations more complicated and bitter. The result was the battle of Sarangpur in 1437 CE between Mewar and Malwa. Mewar won and Maharana Kumbha occupied the territories of Gagron, Mandsaur and Kanthal. When Kumbha was traveling in 1442 CE, Sultan Mahmud Khilji of Malwa attacked Mewar and in his outrage, destroyed temples in and around Kumbhalgarh and tried to capture Chittor but failed. In 1443 CE, he tried to capture Gagron and again in 1446 CE but failed miserably. In 1454 CE, when Maharana Kumbha was busy in his campaigns against Nagaur, Mahmud Khilji again attacked Ajmer and Mandalgarh but could not succeed. Sultan Qutubuddin of Gujarat supported Shams Khan of Nagaur against Maharana Kumbha. In 1456 CE, they attacked Mewar, captured Abu and tried to capture Kumbhalgarh; however Kumbha defeated the Gujarat's armies at Achalgarh. After this defeat, the Sultans of Malwa and Gujarat singed the treaty of Champaner against Maharana Kumbha in 1456 CE. However, all these treaties and alliances did not affect Maharana Kumbha and his vast kingdom of Mewar. At the time of Kumbha's reign in Mewar, the kingdom was continuously in threat of attacks from the neighboring Sultanates but in these struggles Kumbha proved his military strength and leadership qualities.\n\nMaharana Kumbha is well known for his architectural wonders, fortresses and was a patron of arts and crafts. There are almost 82 forts in Mewar out of which 32 were constructed by Maharana Kumbha. The main architects behind these architectural wonders were 'Shilpacharya' Mandan and Jaita. Mandan's brother Natha and his son are also known for their skills. To keep a strong hold on Mewar's boundaries Kumbha built the Achalgarh and Vasantgarh forts at Abu in 1452 CE. For the boundaries near Godwar, the mighty fort of Kumbhalgarh and a 36 k.m. long fort wall was constructed circling the fort in 1458 CE. Kumbhalgarh is an example of Kumbha's military strategy. He also renovated Chittorgarh fort, changed the entrance from the East and constructed 7 gates for the entrance in the fort on the West side. The Architecture in Mewar reached millstones in Kumbha's reign with Kumbh Swami temple and Shringar Chavri in Chittorgarh fort (1448 CE), Kumbh Shyam temple in Achalgarh, renovation at Shree Eklingnathji Temple, Shwetamber Jain Temple and Vishnu Temple in Nagda, Mamadev Temple and Yagyavedi in Kumbhalgarh in 1458 CE and Mahaveer Jain Temple, Shantinath Temple, Khtargach Temple Abu, Choumukha Temple Ranakpur, Vishnu Temple Shree Ekling Ji, Shantinath Temple Bansantpur, Mahaveer Jain Temple Godwar, Rupahedi Jain Temple, Parshwanath Temple and Bawan Jain Temple, Kumbhalgarh, Pitalsha's Jain Temple, Jain Temple and Surya Narayana Temple in Ranakpur. (Ranpur Prashsti). Along with the temple and forts, many ponds and step wells were constructed. Also to commemorate his epic victory over Malwa, Kumbha ordered construction of the unparalleled nine stories Kirti Stambh popularly known as Vijay Stambh, which has some of the finest sculptures of the period.\n\nAccording to Ekling Mahatmya composed by Kanh Vyasa; Maharana Kumbha was well-read in Vedas, Smritis, Upanishads and was a scholar in grammar, meticulous reader, master of music, skilled in drama. He himself wrote many books.\n\nMusic and Dance - Compositions composed by Maharana Kumbha are Sangeetraj, Sood Prabandha, Sangeet Ratnakar, Rasik Priya (Mewar diallect commentary of Geet Govind, originally written in Sanskrit), Vadhya Prabandhak which shows his extraordinary knowledge of music. Maharana Kumbha is also credited for popularizing the new genre of music called \"Kumbh Malhar\". Maharana Kumbha’s book 'Nritya Ratna Kosh' provides a description of the various postures in acting, which validicts his knowledge of dance. During this period, Kathak and various dance styles like Tandava, Lasya etc. were also encouraged in Mewar.\n\nPainting and Sculptures - Under the patronage of Maharana Kumbha, illustrated texts 'Rasikashtak' by Pandit Bhishmchand and 'Gita Govind Akhyika' by Pandit Ramish in Gogunda were written. In this period, the text 'Supaas Nah Chariyan' was illustrated. Detailed information related to painting is also received from 'Rajavallabh Mandan' in which instructions were given to paint beautiful paintings in palaces and temples.In the era of Maharana Kumbha, Delwara was the center of painting. This period was also important for the development of sculptures. Chittorgarh, Kumbhalgarh, Achalgarh, Shree Eklingnathji Temple and Ranakpur were major centers of sculpture in Mewar. Many statues of Vishnu and various forms of Shakti are found at these places. An unequaled example from the constructions of Maharana Kumbha is the 'Kirti (Vijay) pillar' located in Chittorgarh also known as 'Devta Murti Kosh'.\n\nOne can easily determine the economic condition of Mewar by the constructions in Kumbha's period. Delwara, Ahar, Nagda, Jawar, Chittorgarh and Mandalgarh were important trade centers during Kumbha's rule. Maharana Kumbha's coins have been proved original by various numismatic experts and majorly all are copper coins. Shree Eklingnathji has been engraved on these coins along with a motif of 'Kumbhalmeru' (Kumbhalgarh). There are eight types of coins of Maharana Kumbha which are found of different weights. On the obverse 'Shri Kumbhalmeru Maharana Shri Kumbhakaranasya' and on the reverse 'Shri Eklingasya Prasadat 1517' is engraved, on another coin 'Rana Shri Kumbhkaran' on obverse and 'Shri Kumbhalmeru' on reverse is engraved. The state of Mewar had a significant contribution in the development of trade and commerce, many routes and byways connecting Sindh, Gujarat and the western coastline passed through Mewar.\n\nKumbhalgarh Prashasti - dated Magh Krishna Panchami, Vikram Samvat 1517, this Prashasti is engraved on five large stones at Mamadev temple, Kumbhalgarh. On the first stone, there is a description of all the temples, religious centers, water-bodies and on the others, the rule of Bappa Rawal and his descendant's up to Maharana Kumbha has been explained.\n\nKirti Stambh Prashasti - dated Magh Krishna Panchami, Vikram Samvat 1517, situated at Chittor. On most of the slabs of the inscription, the genealogy of Mewar from Bappa Rawal to Maharana Mokal is mentioned. After that, there is description of Maharana Kumbha in 187 shloks. The description of the artist, Mahesh and his ancestors is also mentioned.\n\nRanpur Prashasti - dated Vikram Samvat 1496 is engraved at the Ranakpur Jain temple. In this inscription, along with the description of Mewar genealogy, the description of Maharana Kumbha's military achievements is also mentioned with the construction of Ranakpur Jain Temple and Surya Narayana Temple.\n\nMaharana Kumbha ruled from 1433 CE to 1468 CE for 35 years. For the early 6 years of his rule, he was majorly advised by Rao Ranmal Rathore. After that, he was busy in the wars with Malwa and Gujarat. From 1457 CE to 1468 CE, Maharana Kumbha lived a peaceful life at Kumbhalgarh.\n\nMaharana Ooda (Udai Singh I) 1468 - 1473 CE\n\nIn 1468 CE, Maharana Kumbha was assassinated by his eldest son Ooda. He was also known as Udai Singh I. He occupied the throne of Mewar and ruled for a short period of five years. Khema (Khemkarna), the younger brother of Maharana Kumbha, supported Ooda’s wild ambition. He was also supported by the Deora (Chauhans) chiefs of Sirohi and Marwar. Maharana Kumbha had conquered the territory of Abu and Eastern Sirohi, which was handed over to Deoras in 1468 CE and concluded the settlement with them. However, other notable nobles of Mewar supported the teenager son of Maharana Kumbha, Kanwar Raimal, who was living at Idar that time. The Nobles of Mewar informed their intention to Kanwar Raimal. Kanwar Raimal reached Mewar along with Maharawal of Dungarpur and his army. Ooda was defeated by Raimal at Zawar. According to Shree Eklingnath ji temple inscription dated Vikram Samvat 1545; battle was fought at village Dadimpur in which the main supporter was slain. Ooda could not resist and defeated in the battle of Jawi and Panagarh. After that, he fled off and took refuge at Malwa. The Sultan Gayasuddin of Malwa joined Ooda’s cause and attacked Mewar in 1473 CE. He was defeated and the one who committed patricide was also killed by the fall of sudden lightening.\n\nMaharana Raimal 1473 - 1509 CE\n\nMaharana Kumbha’s younger son Kanwar Raimal after removing Ooda from the throne of Mewar got rid of all other conspirators. He acted wisely in strengthening his authority by entering into matrimonial alliance with the Yadu chief of Girnar and Devra chief of Sirohi. According to the southern gate inscription of Shree Eklingnath ji temple dated Vikram Samvat 1545, Sultan Gayasuddin of Malwa who was seeking advantage of political chaos of Mewar, laid siege on fort of Chittor but he was defeated. According to Dungarpur Rampol gate stone inscription dated Vikram Samvat 1530, He also invaded Dungarpur and destroyed the town. Sultan’s army passed through Ahar, Eklingji, Delwara and besieged Chittor. Maharana’s commander displayed conspicuous gallantry and badly defeated the Malwa force. Maharana also had to face the adverse internal situation. The Meenas disturbed the peace in Godwar territory and the Mers also created the troubles in Badnore. Khema’s son Surajmal aggravated the difficulties. Therefore, he could not pay sufficient attention to Mewar territories. However, he was struggling in this situation to stronghold his position. After the death of Sultan Gayasuddin of Malwa, his son Nasiruddin succeeded at Malwa and marched against Chittor in 1503 CE. Surajmal and his supporter assisted him. Sultan was badly defeated, who was compelled to retreat without any success. According to Ramanath Kund / Mandir Inscription found at Zawar dated 1497, Maharana Kumbha’s daughter Rama Bai married to Mandalik from Saurashtra. When Mahmood Begda defeated Mandalik, Rama Bai came to Mewar. Maharana Raimal gave her the Jagir of Zawar. She constructed the Ramaswami temple and Ramkunda at Zawar during her time. In 1506, Jhala Ajja and Sajja from Kathiawad also came to Mewar and Maharana appointed them as a noble in court of Mewar. Maharana Raimal renovated the Shree Eklingnath ji temple. Maheshwar was court poet in the court of Maharana; he was given village of Ratan Kheda. Narlai (Godwar) inscription dated Vikram Samvat 1557, mentioned about the renovated the Narlai temple by the descendants of Oswal Samada and Siha. According to Ghosundi (Chittor) step-well inscription dated Vikram Samvat 1561, Maharani Shringar Devi, the daughter of Jodha of Marwar got constructed the stepwell for public use.\n\nMaharana Sangram Singh I 1509 - 1528 CE\n\nKanwar Sangram Singh was born to Maharana Raimal and Ratan Kanwar, daughter of Jhala Rajdhar. To gain the throne after Maharana Raimal, his sons namely Kanwar Prithviraj, Kanwar Jaimal, Kanwar Sangram Singh started to fight against each other and their relations became bitter. When the Royal Priest indicated that Kanwar Sangram Singh would be the next Maharana of Mewar, all hell broke loose. Kanwar Prithviraj heard the prophecy and got furious for he was the eldest son of Maharana Raimal. He physically attacked Kanwar Sangram Singh, injuring him in his eye, which eventually lost its vision in one eye. To stem the conflict between the Princes, Maharana Raimal's uncle Sarangdev advised the Princes to seek advice from the Priestess at Charni Devi Temple. The Priestess also indicated and affirmed the same prophecy indicating Kanwar Sangram Singh as the Maharana. Kanwar Prithviraj anger knew no bounds and, with the support of another brother Kanwar Jaimal, he tried to kill Kanwar Sangram Singh. In the family-fights that followed, Kanwar Sangram Singh was forced into exile, reaching Ajmer through Gondwana. In Ajmer, the Prince of Mewar was helped by Karmachand Panwar who helped him recover from the wounds and humiliation he had faced. During the Maharana Raimal reign, Kanwar Jaimal was stabbed to death by Solankies near Badnore, as he compelled Rao Surtan to marry Tara Bai to him. Kanwar Prithviraj succeeded to recapture Toda and handed it over to Surtan. However, he lost his life by a treacherous plot of Rao Jagmal of Sirohi. When Maharana Raimal died, Kanwar Sangram Singh became the Maharana in 1509 CE.\n\nWhen he was crowned as the Maharana of Mewar, Delhi was being ruled by Sultan Sikander Lodhi, Gujarat by Mahmud Shah Begada and Malwa by Nassurudin Khilji. Their alliance had affected the north-eastern, southern and western boundaries of Mewar. Demonstrating his leadership at this early juncture, Maharana Sangram Singh appointed powerful nobles along these borders of Mewar. In the north-east, Karmachand Panwar was appointed 'Rawat' and given the responsibility of Ajmer, Parbatsar, Mandal, Phulia, Banera as Jagirs with revenue of Rs. 15 lakhs. The Maharana then allied with the rulers of Sirohi in the south and Vagad in the west. Mewar and the Rulers of Gujarat were always neighbours at war. When Maharana Sangram Singh attempted to strengthen the boundaries of Mewar by allying with other Rulers, it invariably resulted in conflict with Gujarat. The Maharana was instrumental in influencing the coronation in Idar. The Gujarat-Mewar feud, which had been dormant since the times of Maharana Kumbha, resumed and put enormous economic and political pressure on Mewar. In 1514 CE, Maharana Sangram Singh fought a pitched battle with Sultan Muzaffar Shah at Idar. In 1520 CE, the Maharana defeated him again and captured Ahmednagar. Maharana Sangram Singh soon became involved with the politics of the Malwa region.\n\nMedani Rai, a Rajput General, made strong military and political manoeuvres and forced the Sultan of Malwa to leave Mandu. He then sought the support of Maharana Sangram Singh with a plan to attack Malwa. The plan was later shelved and Medani Rai was bestowed with the jagirs of Gagron and Chanderi. In 1515 CE, the Maharana seized the strategic fort and forest areas of Ranthambhore from the Sultan of Malwa. In 1519 CE, Maharana defeated Sultan Mahmud near Gagron and imprisoned him. Later the Sultan was set free and was given back half of his lands. In 1521 CE, Sultan Mahmud tried to recapture Mandsaur but he was left empty-handed when the armies of Maharana Sangram Singh marched towards him.\n\nIn the reign of Maharana Sangram Singh, the boundaries of Mewar were further strengthened and extended because of the military strategies and his farsightedness. Sultan Sikander Lodhi could not tolerate this expansion strategy of the Maharana as Delhi and Mewar shared long borders. In 1517 CE, Sultan's son Ibrahim Lodhi became the new Sultan and new tensions erupted between the two Kingdoms. In 1517 CE, the Maharana's forces defeated Sultan Ibrahim Lodhi at Khatoli, Bundi. In 1518 CE, the Sultan sent Miya Hussian and Miya Khan to attack Chittorgarh; however they too were defeated and repulsed by the forces of Mewar.\n\nBabur now emerged on the stage of history as he crossed the Khyber Pass into India. When the young Mughal defeated Sultan Ibrahim Lodhi, he annexed Delhi. It marked the beginning of the end of the Lodhi era. There was only one Ruler in the entire north who could challenge Babur and that was Maharana Sangram Singh. The growing military might and influence of the Mughals brought together all the Hindu Rulers under the banner of Mewar. Maharana Sangram Singh became their undisputed leader who had won their respect over the years. When the Maharana analysed the situation, he began enhancing military strategies. He captured the fort at Kandar (near Ranthambore) from Hasan who allied with him. Bayana (or the Bharatpur state) was under the Maharana's rule. Militarily and politically, this was a very strategic location. It was a Jagir given to Niyam Khan. Babur now set about capturing this Jagir of Bayana. He sent Taradi Beg and Quch Beg, two of his nobles, to occupy it. With the help of Niyam Khan's brother Alam Khan, Babur was able to annex Bayana. In retaliation, Maharana Sangram Singh again attacked and captured Kandar. Then the forces of Mewar captured Bayana. When Babur came to know that the Maharana had reached Basavar (10 miles away from Bayana), he sent his commander Abdul Aziz to Khanwa. The Maharana's forces attacked him as well. Babur sent more of his military troops under the charge of Muhib Ali Khalifa and Mulla Hussian to help Abdul Aziz. But they were no match for the brave army of Mewar. The Rajput soldiers and commanders fought bravely and captured Babur's flag, Ran Kankan, musical instruments (like vankiya, a long brass wind instrument, kettle drum, cymbals and 'dhapli' a small drum like instruments), and even his 'red command' tent.\n\nAfter the humiliating defeat of the Mughal army in the Battle of Bayana, Babur had to work very hard to keep up the spirit of his soldiers. He led by example; swearing not to consume liquor and adopting an austere lifestyle. He donated to the poor, the entire gold and silver cutlery in his palatial abode. He cut short his beard and evoked his soldiers through religious sentiments and preaching's. On 13 March 1527 CE, Babur himself led the Mughal army to Khanwa. He supervised the battlefield and began planning for the battle. Maharana Sangram Singh's confederacies of armies were also prepared for battle. They moved ahead under the flag and insignia of Mewar. On 17 March 1527 CE, the battle commenced at Khanwa. In the heat of the battle, the Maharana was struck by an arrow and he fell unconscious. The Mewar commanders and Sardars lowered the injured Maharana into a palanquin and were forced to leave the battlefield. It was the valiant commander Jhala Ajja who assumed charge of the Maharana's elephant with the emblems and insignia of Mewar and continued the battle. His bravery and valour urged the soldiers to keep on fighting the enemy. It was Babur's cannons and artillery which made the difference. The Rajput armies found themselves circled and defeated.\n\nFrom the battlefield of Khanwa, the Rajput commanders and Sardars carried the injured Maharana Sangram Singh to safety in nearby town Baswa. When he regained consciousness, the Maharana was informed about his serious injury and the victory of the Mughal Army led by Babur. Even in the state of pain and semi-consciousness, the Maharana was angry and exhorted his commanders to once again prepare for war. Maharana Sangram Singh was not ready to give up the battle even though everything seemed to have been lost and he was badly injured. Maharana Sangram Singh, as it is recounted in innumerable stories and fables, vowed that he would never return to Chittorgarh till he had avenged this defeat at the hands of Babur and his army. He then left Baswa and moved camp towards Chanderi, finally camping at Kalpi at a village called Irchi. The Maharana succumbed here to his wounds.\n\nHis demise was due to poisoning; whether it was from his innumerable wounds he had suffered or those commanders who were against him, it can never be truly known. On 30th January 1528, 'The Light of Hindus' as the great Maharana Sangram Singh was known, passed into history. He had 80 wounds on his body during the battles. The name of Maharana Sangram Singh I will always be written in letters of gold as long as history books are written and these facts of history are recalled in Mewar, Rajasthan and across India.\n\nThe economic stability of Maharana Sangram Singh can be traced from land grants given during his reign. Inscription at Nilkanth (Mamadev) temple at Kumbhalgarh and Dovani copper plate, describe Maharana’s munificence. Maharana Sangram Singh issued copper coins which are popularly known as Sangram Sahi coins. Six types of these coins have been discovered. On the observe side “Shri Rana Sangram Sha” is engraved in Nagari script with date and on the reverse side “Sultan Bin Sultan” is engraved in Persian.\n\nMaharana Ratan Singh II 1528 - 1531 CE\n\nMaharana Sangram Singh I's elder son, Ratan Singh ascended the throne of Mewar in 1528 CE. Before the death of Maharana Sangram Singh I, he had fragmented his vast kingdom by allotting Ranthambor, along with fifty to sixty lakhs of Jagirdari to his younger sons, Vikramaditya and Udai Singh II. His wife Maharani Karnawati and her brother Surajmal Hada of Bundi were made their guardians. When Maharana Sangram Singh died, Rani Karnawati left Chittor and took possession of Ranthambhor. She also took with her the golden crown and belt studded with precious stones, which the late Maharana had taken from the Sultan of Malwa. After his succession, Maharana Ratan Singh II demanded the golden crown and requested his step - mother to return to Chittor with her other sons. She rejected the Maharana’s proposal and negotiated with Mughal emperor Humanyun. Maharana Ratan Singh began to bear ill-will against Surajmal Hada. Mahmud Khilji II of Malwa was badly defeated by late Maharana Sangram Singh. He was waiting for an opportunity to fight with Mewar since, Silahady Tanwar and Sikandar Khan in concert with Maharana had recently seized some territory belonging to the kingdom of Malwa. The Mewar army succeeded in defeating the Malwa-troops near Ujjain. Maharana Ratan Singh failed in bringing his step mother to Chittor, in order to have his full control over Ranthambhor. He made Surajmal Hada responsible for this. Maharana suddenly visited Bundi; a pig hunt was contrived, where Surajmal was also invited to participate. In the course of pig-sticking in 1531 CE, Ratan Singh attacked Surajmal and in a close scuffle both of them lost their lives. One stone inscription dated Vikram Samvat 1587 found at Shatrunjaya Tirth, Palitana Gujarat belonging in his reign. According to this inscription, Karmashah (Minister) of Chittor renovated the Jain temple at Shatrunjaya with the special permission of Sultan Bahadur Shah of Gujarat. In the beginning of this inscription, it contains a brief detail of the Maharana Ratan Singh. Maharana issued one copper coin. On the observe side “Rana Shri Ratansih” is engraved in Nagari script and the reverse side unreadable.\n\nMaharana Vikramaditya 1531 - 1536 CE\n\nMaharana Vikramaditya succeeded his step brother Maharana Ratna Singh II in 1531 CE. The circumstances under which he came to the throne of Mewar were not very favourable to him. He did not attempt to develop his faith on his chiefs and admonished them. In 1532 CE when the state was facing the situation of disorder, Bahadur Shah of Gujarat sent an army to invade Chittor. Maharani Karnawati sent away Maharana Vikramaditya to Bundi and offered presents to Sultan of Gujarat and Sultan ordered to raise the siege in 1533 CE and returned to Gujarat. In 1535 CE Bahadur Shah Sultan of Gujarat again commenced his operation of the siege of Chittor. Maharani also attempted to get help by sending a Rakhi to Mughal emperor Humayun. On finding that no help is expected from Humayun, whom she had requested, Maharani Karnawati issued stirring appeal to the nobles to save the crimson standard of the Sisodiyas by defending the fort. Her appeal had a desired effect. However, the Rajput resistance proved futile before the artillery barrage of Rumi Khan. Before the gates of the fort were opened Maharani Karnawati performed Johar and the defenders rushed out of the fort and died fighting to the last man. Chittor thus fell to Bahadur Shah. Fortunately, on hearing the arrival of the Mughal Forces, Bahadur Shah left the fort and the Rajputs reoccupied it. Maharana Vikramaditya had an opportunity to reoccupy the fort but he could not make proper use of his restored position. Maharana invited Banveer from exile, the illegitimate son of Maharna Sangaram Singh I's eldest brother late Prithviraj. In 1535 CE, Banveer became too ambitious and murdered Maharana Vikramaditya. The Jhaliya Copper plate dated Vikram Samvat 1589 issued by Maharana Vikramaditya, when he went to Mandalgarh for getting married.\n\nMaharana Udai Singh II 1537 - 1572 CE\n\nMaharana Sangram Singh's youngest son Kanwar Udai Singh was born on Bhadwa Shukla Ekadashi, Vikram Samvat 1578. His mother was Karmawati (Karnawati), who was the daughter of Rao Narbadji Hada of Bundi. Maharana Udai Singh saw division in Mewar since his childhood and was even brought up in Ranthambore. Political upheaval like the death of his father Maharana Sangram Singh I, the rule and murder of Maharana Ratan Singh II and the plight of Mewar during the reign of Maharana Vikramaditya were all witnessed by him. He also observed the atrocities on Bhaktimati Meera Bai and her renunciation of Mewar along with the Jauhar of Rajmata Karnawati. The assassination of Maharana Vikramaditya and the capture of Mewar by Banveer was part of the same political turmoil.\n\nPannadhai, the epitome of valour and devotion, was taking care of Kanwar Udai Singh since he was staying at Ranthambore. She was a very trusted helper of Rajmata Karnavati, thus at the time of Jauhar, the responsibility of protecting Kanwar Udai Singh was also entrusted to Pannadhai. After the assassination of Maharana Vikramaditya, if Banveer wanted to establish his rule on Mewar; he had to kill Kanwar Udai Singh too. Pannadhai was well aware of his activities and possible changes in the court of Mewar, so when Banveer came to the palace to kill Kanwar Udai Singh, Pannadhai put her sleeping son Chandan in the place of Kanwar Udai Singh. Banveer killed her son Chandan in front of Pannadhai. Pannadhai, along with her trusted companions, took Kanwar Udai Singh to a safe palace. This sacrifice of Pannadhai, to protect the descendants of Mewar kingdom became immortal in the history of Mewar. After leaving Chittorgarh with Pannadhai, Kanwar Udai Singh, reached Kumbhalgarh via Devlia and Dungarpur. Maharana Udai Singh established contact with the chieftains of Mewar with the support of Asha Devpura, the in-charge of Kumbhalgarh fort and the chieftains dissatisfied with Banveer came to Kumbhalgarh and handed over the reins of Mewar kingdom to Maharana Udai Singh II.\n\nWith the support of the chieftains of Mewar, Maharana married Jaiwanta Bai, the daughter of Akhairaj Sonegara of Pali. This marriage advanced the relations of Maharana with the nobles. Along with Pali, friendly relations were also established with Maldev, the ruler of Jodhpur. Maharana strengthened his military and planned an attack on Chittorgarh. The army of Maharana and Banveer met at Mavli, in which the Maharana's army was victorious and then reached Chittorgarh via Tana (a Thikana in Mewar). Maharana's army attacked by entering the fort with the cooperation and diplomacy of Asha Devpura and Cheel Mehta; frightened by this unexpected attack, Banveer escaped from Lakhota gate along with his family and trusted soldiers. In 1540 CE, Maharana Udai Singh recovered Chittor. The effect of the political upheaval of North India was also visible in Rajputana. The Afghan ruler, Sher Shah captured Delhi in 1540 CE and defeated Rao Maldev, the ruler of Jodhpur in 1544 CE. At that, time the pargana of Ajmer was under the control of Jodhpur, so that too came under the authority of Sher Shah. Clouds of trouble started looming over Mewar as the next attack was probably on Chittorgarh. Chittorgarh was still facing other problems like economic losses and lack of military training, so any war was not in the interest of Mewar. Sher Shah understanding the competence of the fighters in Mewar just wanted to establish his influence on Mewar. In these circumstances, Maharana Udai Singh due to this farsightedness deftly averted the war by sending the keys of Chittorgarh fort to Shar Shah, who went away from Mewar without attacking Chittor thus Mewar was successfully saved.\n\nThe earlier tradition in Mewar and the concept of the kingdom was that as soon as the capital collapsed, it was believed that the kingdom collapsed with it. In Mewar too, two Jauhars had already taken place to protect the capital - Chittorgarh. The security of Chittorgarh could pose a threat due to its geographical location, as it had always been the centre of ambitions of political powers, being the main trading centre connecting North India with the western coast and Malwa. Situated on a hill, it was easy to besieged from all sides and when logistic and supplies were low, opening the gates of the fort was inevitable and it was a question of Do or Die. It was difficult to defend the fort of Chittor. Apart from this, it was also not possible to form a large army due to the weak economic conditions in Mewar at that time. The war in the open plains was not a good possibility for Mewar but the survival of the ruler was necessary for the future of the kingdom. Due to these circumstances, Maharana Udai Singh propounded the idea of ​​building a new and safer capital. For the new capital, the Maharana chose a mountainous region covered by ranges of hills in the west and south-west of Mewar, which was well protected by nature. According to Chittor Patnama Part II in 1553 CE, on the day of Akshaya Tritiya, Udaipur was established in the midst of the hills of Girwa. Maharana Udai Singh tried to secure the mountainous region and encouraged the people of Mewar to settle in this area. Due to the direct contact of Mewar's ruler, this mountainous region was developed.\n\nAccording to Veer Vinod Volume II part I in 1559 CE, Maharana visited Shree Eklingnath ji Temple to commemorate the birth of his grandson Kanwar Amar Singh I, and on return went for a hunt during which the Maharana met Shri Premgiri ji Maharaj on the banks of Pichola pond. According to the directions given by the hermit, in 1559 CE, Maharana started the construction of the palace in the capital under the direction of a Sutradhar named Raja Bhardwaj, grandson of Mandan Bhardawaj, of Kumbhalgarh fort. At the time of the construction of Udaipur, Maharana established Gogunda, a safe place located inside the mountains, as his temporary capital. Thus, Maharana Udai Singh has the credit of establishing two capitals both Udaipur and Gogunda.\n\nMaharana Udai Singh established relations with neighboring states to protect the borders of Mewar. He ensured the security of Mewar by making decisive interventions during the internal conflicts of the other kingdoms. In 1554 CE, Maharana established the authority of Mewar over Bundi and then Ranthambore by sending an army under the leadership of Surjan Hada, son of his maternal uncle Arjun Hada, in the civil war against Rao Surtan, the ruler of Bundi. The friendly relations between Maharana Udai Singh and the ruler of Jodhpur, Maldev ended when Maharana agreed to marry the younger daughter of Jaitra Singh Jhala, the son of Jhala Ajja, whom Rao Maldev wanted to marry. When the Afghan, Haji Khan had lordship over Ajmer Pargana, Rao Maldev planned to attack Ajmer; with no other option, Haji Khan sought help from the Maharana. To establish friendly relations with Haji Khan, Maharana sent a combined army of Bundi, Dungarpur, Banswara and Idar to defend Ajmer. On hearing the news of Maharana's army, Jodhpur's army returned without fighting and Ajmer remained safe. Rao Rai Singh, the ruler of Sirohi, had cordial relations with Mewar. At the time of Rai Singh's death, Udai Singh, the successor of the kingdom, was of a young age, so the kingdom was handed over to his brother Rao Duda. After the death of Rao Duda, Udai Singh was crowned and Duda's son Man Singh got the jagir of Lohiana. Angered by the behavior of Rao Udai Singh, Man Singh took refuge in Mewar. After the death of Rao Udai Singh from smallpox, the Sirohi chieftains summoned Man Singh to the throne of Sirohi, and surviving under the influence of Maharana, Man Singh accepted the authority of Mewar over Sirohi after his coronation. In this way, Maharana Udai Singh re-established the influence of Mewar in Rajputana through which he improved the military power and economic condition of Mewar.\n\nThe kingdom of the Mughal ruler Akbar was established in North India and the Rajput kingdoms were accepting the Mughal suzerainty and at that time, only Mewar was standing as an independent state with its self-respecting tradition. Irrigated fertile plains and ranges always protected Mewar. The only route to connect North India with Gujarat and the southern territories passed through Mewar, so the independent state of Mewar remained a major obstacle for the Mughal rule. In September 1567 CE, the Mughal ruler Akbar moved to attack Chittorgarh. Maharana had already foreseen this crisis, which is why he had already secured the establishment of Udaipur in the mountainous region and the temporary capital at Gogunda and the protection of southern along with south-west border of Mewar. Maharana's foresight had prepared Mewar for a longer struggle. On receiving the news of the attack on Chittorgarh, Maharana started discussions with his chieftains, and the nobles advised Maharana to hand over the Chittor fort to some notable chieftains and retreat to the hills in the west along with the Mewar family and other chieftains. Everyone was aware of the loss in Mewar at the time of the Gujarat invasion, so wanted the Maharana and the successors of the kingdom to be safe; so that they could regain the lost territory in due course of time. Maharana accepted the advice of the chieftains, handed over the fort of Chittor to Jaimal and Fatta and went to the mountainous region. In October 1567 CE, the Mughal forces reached near the fort and camped. By December 1567, the Mughal army was trying to enter the fort. Due to a long struggle and end of logistics; the third Jauhar took place in Chittor with the opening of gates of the fort. The Mewar army under the leadership of Sardar Jaimal and Fatta sacrificed their lives by wearing saffron. In February 1568 CE, the Mughal army captured the fort.\n\nThe architecture of Maharana Udai Singh's reign reveals a defensive approach rather than an artistic side. The construction was done keeping the future wars in sight. The establishment and development of Udaipur city was an important initiative of Maharana. The construction also comprises of Udai Sagar, Badi Pal, Moti Magri's palace and stepwells are a strong evidence of his architectural approach. In the palace of Udaipur, Navchoki, Panera, Rai Angan, Nika ki Chopad, Pandeyji ki Ori, Sej ki Ori, Zenana Rawala (currently Kothar) were built by Maharana Udai Singh. Apart from this, the construction of Udai Shyam temple on the bank of Udaisagar also took place during the reign of the Maharana. A palace was also built by Maharana in Gogunda, the temporary capital of Mewar. Apart from Maharana, his family was also involved in the development of this area. In 1554 CE, Maharani Sonagari built Badla Wali Sarai and Panghat Baori. Maharani Sahajkunwar Solankini got the Sarai, the stepwell and the Shiva temple built. Maharani Dheer Kunwar built a stepwell, a temple and an Inn outside the village of Debari. The efficient planning and vision of Maharana populated the Girwa region.\n\nIn his childhood, Maharana Udai Singh was religiously inspired by Bhaktimati Meera Bai, from which he got the knowledge and respect for religion. The inspiration for the construction of the Udaiashyam temple on the bank of Udaisagar is the result of this association. According to Shreenathji's Prakya Varta, when Goswami Shri Vitthalnathji reached Mewar during his yatra to Dwarka, he graciously predicted that, after a few years Shreenathji Prabhu would arrive in Mewar, and a temple will be established. Maharana Udai Singh went with the royal family for the darshan of Shri Goswami ji and he presented village Sinhad (present Nathdwara) and a gold Mohar. He received gracious blessings from Goswami ji, that the fame of Maharana’s lineage will always be maintained. In Vikram Samvat 1602 (1545 CE), Maharana had consecrated the Shikhar Kalash of Shree Parameshwaraji Maharaj Shree Eklingnathji Temple.\n\nMaharana spent his maximum time in Kumbhalgarh after leaving Chittorgarh. Maharana went to Gogunda on the occasion of Vijayadashami in Vikram Samvat 1628, and he left the world on Falgun Shukla Poornima because of ill health. The capital Udaipur was not fully developed yet and Gogunda was the temporary capital of Mewar, so he was cremated in Gogunda. A chhatri was constructed at the cremation site.\n\nMaharana Udai Singh II as the ruler of Kumbhalgarh issued the copper plate dated 1593 for granted the land to priest of Bansi. Another copper plate dated Vikram Samvat 1596, Maharana granted the land to Derashri Shiv of village Bijagot. As the ruler of Mewar, Maharana Udai Singh II issued the copper plate in favour of Thakur Ganga and Bagha of Nadol.\n\nMaharana Pratap Singh I 1572 - 1597 CE\n\nMaharana Pratap's personality emerges as a unique warrior and a freedom fighter; he has become a national symbol of struggle, renunciation, sacrifice, generosity and perseverance. Kanwar Pratap was born on Jyeshtha Shukla 3, Vikram Samvat 1597 at Kumbhalgarh. The eldest son of Maharana Udai Singh II (founder of Udaipur) was a brave and capable successor. His mother's name was Jevantabai, who was the daughter of Akharaj Sonagara of Pali. Kanwar Pratap was also addressed in the childhood by the name of ‘Kika’. According to the tradition of Mewar, Kanwar Pratap was taught statecraft, religious issues, horse riding, skillful use of weapons, military operation, war strategy etc. Kanwar Pratap defeated the Chauhans of Wagad and merged the area in Mewar. Then, in 1562 CE, Kanwar Pratap acquired the latter part of 'Chappan' and some parts of ​​Godwad were also re-merged into Mewar. Maharana Udai Singh under the influence of Bhatiyani Rani Dheer Kanwar, declared Kanwar Jagamal as the successor, thus Kanwar Pratap left the fort Chittor and was ordered to live in the foothills. It turned fruitful because Kanwar Pratap's association with the general public and Bhils proved to be a big helpful in future.\n\nIn 1567- 68 CE, due to Mughal invasion of Chittor, Maharana Udai Singh started living with his family in temporary capital at Gogunda. Even today, some ancient remains of Maharana Udai Singh's residence can be seen in the foothills of Golgonda's Dholia mountain range. On 28th February 1572, Maharana Udai Singh died on Holi. Kanwar Pratap's younger brother Kanwar Jagamal sat on the throne and did not join Maharana's cremation. Ram Singh Tanwar of Gwalior and Man Singh Sonargara got to know about Kanwar Jagamal, the objections were raised by them; the Nobles deliberately took Kanwar Jagmal off the throne and accepted the eldest son Kanwar Pratap as worthy successor. Salumbar Rawat Krishnadas and Devgad Rawat Sanga, after returning from the cremation, with consent of all the Nobles, they crowned Pratap on Mahadev Bawdi at Gogunda. On 28th February 1572 CE, Maharana Pratap became the ruler of Mewar. Later, at Kumbhalgarh, the coronation celebration took place. Maharana Pratap made Kumbhalgarh and Gogunda the main centers of the state of Mewar.\n\nMaharana Udai Singh, in terms of security, embarked a plan to make the second capital of Mewar in the Girwa valley. This plan was a proof of his farsightedness, that when the Mughals attacked in 1568 CE and the entire fertile land of Mewar including the historic fort of Chittor was taken over by the Mughals, then the center of the state of Mewar was transferred from Chittor to Girwa (Udaipur). Maharana Pratap had the question before himself when he became the ruler of Mewar, to either \"accept the mandate of the Mughal Empire in the future or adopt a path of struggle.\" Having faith in oneself, Pratap despite the limited land of the mountainous area of ​​Aravali, low means and limited human resources, Pratap adopted the path of resistance.\n\nThe strategy of Maharana was tested when the Mughal dominion was established in all the areas near Mewar through the treaties and proposals and he also had to defend Mewar in family crisis. The Mughals used other Rajput states against Mewar through royal favour and matrimonial alliances. In retaliation front, Maharana Pratap tried to establish friendship in different parts of Rajputana, wherever they opposed Mughals. Among them were Sirohi, Idar, Jodhpur, Dungarpur. Favourable nobles were provided with the jagirs on the border of Mewar. The capitals of Mewar, continued to change in this conflict route of independence, but no irregularities were witnessed because of Pratap's administration and efficient military operations.\n\nBy rejecting the Mughal authority, Akbar sent ambassadors with the proposals of treaty, but Maharana Pratap remained firm on his pre-fulfillment. Therefore, on 18th June, 1576 in Haldighati (Khamanor), the battle with the Mughal army was fought. The Mewar army was divided into three parts; the war was initiated by the army of the Maharana. The front line of Haraval under the leadership of Hakim Khan Sur attacked heavily on the avant-garde of the Mughal army. Badayuni himself, who was present on the battleground, writes that \"This invasion of the army of Maharana was so ferocious that the Mughal army was defeated, which was already frustrated with the rugged rocks and thorny lands there, crossed the river Banas and fled up to 5 miles\". Maharana Pratap got out of the valley and attacked the army of the Gazi Khan and reached the middle of Gazi’s army. This attack led to the escape of Sheikh Mansour, Prince of Sikri and Gazi Khan. At this devastating state, Mehtar Khan jumped out of Chandrawal and propagated that Akbar himself was coming with a new army. The army thus retaliated and the battle was restarted. This battle resulted in high casualties at both ends. Akbar's intention for the battle of 1576 was to completely destroy Pratap and his pride. Akbar's major resentment was Pratap's resolution to stay outside the Mughal Empire. While Akbar wanted Mewar's subjugation under the Mughal Empire, Pratap was ready to perish for independence, liberty and self-respect. Pratap reached the Kolyari village via Gogunda with all his wounded soldiers where they received medical help. On the other end Akbar reached Ajmer to find a dejected army and missing Mughal supremacy. This made him furious and he closed his doors on Man Singh and Asaf Khan. This was the moral and strategic victory of Maharana Pratap.\n\nMaharana Pratap, after the battle of Haldighati, took his place of residence at Kumbhalgarh. With the help of neighbours like Sirohi, Jalore, Idar, they adopted the policy of attacking the Mughal army. From 1576 to 1579 CE, Akbar attacked many times on Mewar in search of Maharana Pratap, but traveling to the mountainous region was a tough challenge for the Mughal army.\n\nIn 1578 to 1580 CE, Mughal Chief Shahbaaz Khan acquired Kumbhalgarh, Zawar, Chappan and Vagad. Maharana Pratap stopped the Mughal proceedings for some time in these woeful circumstances by strong military tactics which resulted in the form of the success turned at Dewair. In 1580 CE, Abdur Rahim Khan-e Khana took the charge of Mewar affairs. Khan-i-Khana proceeded towards Mewar and halted at Sherpura. His wife Maha Bano Begum and other members of the family were also with him. The eldest son of Maharana Pratap, Kanwar Amar Singh attacked Sherpura and captured Khana-i-Khana‟s Begum, and other women of the Harem. When he presented them in front of Maharana Pratap, he was furious and told Kanwar Amar Singh that our fight is with the Mughal soldiers and not with their women. He at once ordered Kanwar Amar Singh to escort the ladies of the harem safely back to the camp of Khan-i-Khana. After this incident, Abdur Rahim Khan-i-Khana was very impressed with Pratap‟s conduct.\n\nIn 1582 CE, Pratap attacked a Mughal out-post in village Dewair situated about 40 Kms northeast of Kumbhalgarh. Sultan Khan, the chief of all Chowkies fought a bloody battle with Pratap. Sultan Khan, riding on an elephant, operated the Mughal army. The soldiers of Amet and the nearby Mughal Chowki also came to the aid of Sultan Khan. When Pratap's men cut the legs of the Elephant on whom Sultan Khan was mounted, he swiftly moved onto a Horse. At that point Pratap's eldest son Kanwar Amar Singh killed both Sultan Khan and his Horse with one skillful blow of his spear. The remaining Mughal soldiers ran away rendering, Pratap victorious. After the success of Dewair battle, Maharana Pratap took control of Kumbhalgarh and Zawar.\n\nAbdur Rahim Khan-i-Khana had failed to subdue Maharana Pratap, Jagannath Khachawaha was appointed to chastise him. Maharana while residing in mountainous areas, with the guerilla warfare system defeated the Mughal power. In the hill area of ​​Chappan, in 1584 CE he defeated Luna Rathore and made Chavand its capital. After strengthening the situation of Mewar, under the leadership of Rawat Bhan Sarangdevot, the army was sent against Maharawal Asakaran of Dungarpur and Maharawal Pratap Singh of Banswar. In this campaign, Mewar was victorious and both the rulers accepted the suzerainty of Maharana Pratap.\n\nWith the generalship of Maharana Pratap, Mewar was strategically prepared for the anti-Mughal conflict, in which the establishment of the administrative system in the mountainous part of the hill and the economy was deployed on the basis of war. An attempt was made to merge all the Mughal opponents with Maharana as well as those who did not accept the Mughal order were welcomed in Mewar. According to his war strategy, Maharana Pratap fortified the entire mountainous region of Mewar and changed the area into a strong, safe fortress with the view of military system. With the appointment of military troops on all the small routes of the entry into the mountainous part of the Mewar, the administrative and military system of Mewar was decentralized, which did not spread chaos simultaneously upon the invasion at one area. Arrangement of intensive surveillance system, intelligence system and safe places for treasury, arsenal, food storage etc. were installed at safer places. He well established the state's treasury, production, trade, industry in the mountainous part through which the general requirements of public life could be met. Maharana Pratap used the guerrilla warfare system to interrupt the Mughal army; the Mughal police stations were never safe in Mewar and feared attacks at the Mughal localities too. By making Chavand the capital, Maharana Pratap maintained close contact with Sirohi, Idar, Dungarpur, Banswara, Gujarat, making it easier to get support for the Mughal resistance. As a result of the diplomatic efforts and successful strategy of Maharana Pratap, the Mughal army could not enact Mewar after 25 years of continuous efforts.\n\nLiterature and the arts have been largely embedded in the tradition of Mewar. After the establishment of the capital at Chavand, during the peaceful period, writers, poets and artists began to gather again in the conjunction of Maharana Pratap. Chavand started developing as a cultural center. Evidence of state promotion by Maharana Pratap is prominent in manuscripts and paintings. Chakrapani Mishra wrote 'Vishavavallabh’, ‘Muhurtmala’ and compiled and edited 'Rajyabhishek Paddhati'. The 'Gora-Badal Charitra' composed by Jain scholar Hemantan Suri was done in the patronization of Maharana Pratap. The ruins of the fort built by Maharana Pratap along with the temple of Chamunda Mata at Chavand can be seen today as well. Here Maharana Pratap spent the last 12 years of his life.\n\nKanwar Amar Singh and all the nobles of Mewar pledged before Maharana Pratap that they will never surrender to the Mughal forces. In 1597, with this satisfaction in his heart, Pratap took his last breath. His cremation took place on the bank of a river near village Badoli situated about 2 kms from Chawand. His wives Rathore Madho Kanwar and Ran Kanwar committed 'sati’. A cenotaph was constructed at the cremation site, by Amar Singh which remains a sacred place of homage for people, in and around that area, till date.Timeline\n\nMaharana Amar Singh I 1597- 1620 CE\n\nThe eldest son of Maharana Pratap Kanwar Amar Singh was born on Chetra Sudi 7 Vikram Samvat 1616 at Chittorgarh. His mother's name was Maharani Ajabde Panwar, who was the daughter of Rao Mamrakh of Bijoliya. He was also the commander of Mewar army in battle of Dewair in 1582 CE. After the demise of Maharana Pratap I his eldest son Kanwar Amar Singh succeeded the throne of Mewar in 1597 CE. He was equally valiant and imaginative like his father.\n\nAfter the demise of Maharana Pratap, Akbar got another chance to fulfil his ambition. In 1600 CE, he sent Mughal army under the command of Prince Salim (later Jahangir). Salim spent much time at Ajmer and sent his commanders to Mewar. Maharana Amar Singh following the policy of his father, he took shelter in the hilly tracts of western Mewar and made a counter attack on Mughal army. Prince Salim arrived at Udaipur and directed his commandants to chase the Mewar contingents more actively. However, Maharana recaptured all the outposts which were seized by the Mughal army. The Mughal army failed to achieve any notable success.\n\nIn 1605, Prince Salim sat on the throne and strictly followed the policy of his father. He sent a large force under the command of his son Prince Parvez. Maharana Amar Singh made necessary preparations to meet Mughal army and closed all important passes of the hills. Mughal army was badly defeated by the Mewar army near Dewair pass. Again in 1608 CE, Jahangir appointed Mahabat Khan for Mewar affairs. Mahabat Khan left for Mewar along with his important chiefs. Mughal army came in Mewar via Mandal, Chittor and made Unthala as the base. This army succeeded in establishing their outposts at various place. Maharana’s army made sudden attack on the Mughal army and defeated it completely. In 1609 CE, Abdullah Khan was made in charge of the Mewar campaign. He succeeded in stabling his outposts at Unthala and Gogunda. Abdullah Khan centralized his forces, in order to save himself from sudden Rajput raids and reached Chawand. The Rajput soldiers staying there displayed memorable resistance in the battle. At last, Abdullah Khan seized the place and destroyed temples. Maharana Amar Singh had to leave Chawand but did not lose his heart and determined to fight again. In 1611 CE, Maharana and Mughal army had fierce fighting at Ranakpur. Several Important chiefs of Mewar, Duda Sangawat, Narayandas Sonagara, Surajmal, Ashakaran, Jhala Deda, Keshavdas Chauhan, and Mukanddas Rathore laid down their lives and the Mewar army emerged victorious.\n\nIn 1613 CE, Prince Khurram (later Shahjahan) was sent to attack Mewar. He reached Udaipur via Chittor and Debari. Maharana left the central tract of Mewar and took shelter to hilly tract. According to Rana Raso, Prince Khurram wrote a letter to the Maharana to settle the matter peacefully. Khurram divided his army into four flanks. The entire hilly tract of Mewar was closely seized by the Mughal army. All Important centers of Mewar were ruined. Mewar was continously struggling against the Mughals from the reign of Maharana Udai Singh II. Maharana Amar Singh was not ready to owe his allegiance to the Mughals. Prince Khurram and Mughal officers had sent some important officers, Pradhans and Purohits to make the Maharana to agree to some permanent settlement. Raja Sursingh and Raja Narasingh Deva also went to Maharana to assure him of honourable settlement.\n\nThus, he renewed the struggles with the Mughals and faced them up to 1615 CE but as advised by his nobles he concluded a treaty with them in a very honorable manner. Kanwar Karan Singh was advised to go to Ajmer to ratify the treaty. In June 1615 CE, after six month Kanwar Karan Singh returned to Mewar, Jahangir conveyed a verbal message to the Maharana for maintaining cordial relation. The entire territory of Mewar was handed over back to Maharana.\n\nAfter the settlement, he did much to improve the administration and paid his attention towards the rehabilitation programme. Due to struggle, those people, who left Mewar, Maharana invited them back to come to Mewar. Maharana Amar Singh also gave patronage to art and architecture in Mewar. He built the Amar Mahal in the Palace of Udaipur. During his reign, Nisaradi was the great painter, who illustrated the famous Ragamala miniature painting series.\n\nHe was the first Maharana who died in Udaipur in 1620 CE. His cenotaph was beautifully built by his son Maharana Karan Singh, is the first such structure at Mahasatyaji, Udaipur.\n\nMaharana Karan Singh 1620 - 1628 CE\n\nKanwar Karan Singh was born on Shravan Shukla Dwadashi, Vikram Samvat 1640. He was the eldest son of Maharana Amar Singh I and his mother name’s was Saheb Kunwar, daughter of Raja Salbhanji Tanwar. In 1620 CE, Kanwar Karan Singh succeeded Maharana Amar Singh. However, he had already started exercising administrative powers during his father’s reign due to Maharana Amar Singh being displeased with the treaty of 1615 CE with the Mughals and stayed in Ahar. He fought many battles with his father Maharana Amar Singh I. However, he was very concerned about the plight of Mewar. He maintained diplomatic relation with Mughals during his reign. Jahangir sent a robe of honour, a horse and an elephant with Raja Kishandas on his coronation. After the treaty with Mughals the situation in Mewar became peaceful. Maharana Karan Singh also utilised his time in attempting administrative, judicial and economic reforms. Due to his efforts, trade centres of Mewar were flourishing again.\n\nAfter the death of Rao Surtan of Sirohi, his son Raj Singh sat on the throne but he was not able to manage the state affairs. In this situation, his brother Sur Singh and his minister Prithviraj Sujawat made him captive. Maharana Karan Singh invited them to Udaipur but Prithviraj assassinated Rao Raj Singh. Maharana sent Mewar army for punishing Prithviraj and in the favour of Akheraj (Son of Rao Raj Singh). He gave refuge to Prince Khurram (later Shahjahan) at Udaipur when he revolted against his father Jahangir in 1622 CE. Maharana Karan Singh received him displaying utmost hospitality. To maintain the good relations Maharana and Khurram exchanged their turbans. He lived in Mewar for about four months after, he went to Deccan. The Mughal commander of Nadol; Gazani Khan destroyed several temples of Godwar including Ranakpur Jain temples. In 1621 CE, Maharana renovated this Jain temple as according to the Jain Monk Vijaydev Suri.\n\nAccording to Rajprashasti Mahakavya, Kanwar Karan Singh did Tula-daan against silver on the banks of River Ganga in his Maharaj Kumar period. Most of the construction in the Rajmahal of Udaipur was done by Maharana Karan Singh namely- Manek Chowk, Paiga Pol, Suraj Pol, Toran Pol, Moti Chowk, Sata Navari Paiga, Ganesh Chowk, Ganesh Deodhi, Chandra Mahal, Lakhu Gokhada, Karan Mahal, Dilkhushal Mahal, Moti Mahal and Bheem Vilas, (Part I), Manek Mahal, Mor Chowk, Surya Chopad, Surya Gokhada, Nav Ghat, Zenana Mahal, Lakshmi Chowk and Zenana Deodhi. He died an untimely death in March 1628 CE.\n\nAccording to Rampol inscription found at Chittorgarh dated Vikram Samvat 1678, Maharana Karan Singh granted the Jagir of three villages to Rohadiya Barhat Lakha.\n\nMaharana Jagat Singh I 1628 - 1652 CE\n\nAfter the demise of Maharana Karan Singh, his eldest son Kanwar Jagat Singh I succeeded the throne of Mewar in 1628 CE. He was born on Bhadwa Shukla Tritiya Vikram Samvat 1664. On his coronation, Mughal emperor Shahjahan sent a robe of honour for him. Maharana Jagat Singh was an ambitious Prince who seemed to have believed in turning favourable opportunities to his advantage. When Shahjahan engaged in the internal affairs of his kingdom, Maharana resolved to assert his authority over the neighbouring states, which were under the suzerainty of Mewar kingdom.\n\nIn 1628 CE, Maharana dispatched the army against the Rawal Punja of Dungarpur, under the command of Akshayraj Kavdia. In the same year, there was a dispute between Mewar and Devaliya. Maharana sent his army against Devaliya. Jasawant Singh, the ruler of Devaliya was killed and Devaliya remained in the possession of the Maharana for a few months. After that Hari Singh, the successor of Jaswant Singh recaptured it. Maharana also sent his army against Akheraj of Sirohi and Rawal Samarsi of Banswara. Shahjahan was displeased with the Maharana due to his aggressive policy but Maharana sent Jhala Kalyan of Delwara to Agra with presents to Mughal court. He also sent Mewar army under the command of Bhopat Ram for the Deccan campaign of Shahjahan. According to the treaty with Mughals the Maharana of Mewar never went to the Mughal court, hence Kanwar Raj Singh was sent to meet Shahjahan at Ajmer in 1643 CE. However, he shrewdly breached the treaty and started the renovation of Fort Chittorgarh.\n\nMaharana maintained a kind of balance between the Mewar pride and the suzerainty of Mughal treaty. Raghunath, the court poet has summarized his policy, 'Maharana Jagat Singh always entered into friendly alliance with a powerful enemy and subdued his weak foes.'\n\nRajmata Jambuvati, Maharana’s mother went for pilgrimage to Mathura, Gokul, Prayag and Kashi along with her grandson Kanwar Raj Singh and maternal grand-daughter Nand Kunwar Bai. At that time, Maharana got constructed the Rana Mahal and Rana Ghat at Kashi. Rajmata along with Nand Kunwar Bai did Tuladan against silver and Kanwar Raj Singh also did Tuladan against gold. Maharana himself went for pilgrimage to Mahakal, Ujjain and Onkareshwar. He also did Tuladan against gold and erected an inscription on Tulastambh at Onkareshwar dated Vikram Samvat 1704 CE.\n\nMunificence of the Maharana is well known. He did several Tuladans against silver and gold. He also got made a gold flagstaff and pinnacle at Shree Eklingnath ji temple. He constructed the Shree Jagnnathrai ji temple in Udaipur. There were lot of constructions during his ruling period including Jagmandir (In lake Pichola) which was started by Maharana Karan Singh and completed by Maharana Jagat Singh I. Mohan Mandir (In Lake Pichola), Jaleb Chowk, 8 Torans at Tripoliya, after each ‘Tula Dan’: the Torans are above Paiga Pol, on the eastern side of Hathion ka Halka and Kanwarpada Mahal in the Rajmahal of Udaipur.\n\nShree Jagannatharai temple inscription dated Vikram Samvat 1709 mentiones the genealogy of the Mewar rulers. It gives valuable information of Maharana Sangram Singh and Maharana Pratap. Maharana Jagat Singh’s Dungarpur campaign is also mentioned in it. The Shantinath Jain temple inscription found at Zawar dated 1694, Ranakpur Stone inscription dated Vikram Samvat 1705, Narlai Sculpture Inscription Dated Vikram Samvat 1686, Nadol Sculpture Inscription Dated Vikram Samvat 1686, mentions about the various activities of the Jains during his reign.\n\nMaharana Raj Singh I 1652 - 1680 CE\n\nKanwar Raj Singh was born to Maharana Jagat Singh I and Jana Devi (daughter of Raj Singh Mertia Rathore), on Kartik Krishna 2 Vikram Samvat 1686. After the demise of Maharana Jagat Singh I, Raj Singh ascended the throne of Mewar in 1652 and went to Shree Eklingnath ji Temple and did 'Tula Dan' of precious gems and stones.\n\nDuring the accession crisis in the Mughal Empire, Prince Aurangzeb had scored decisive victories against Prince Dara Shikoh. Maharana Raj Singh shrewdly refrained from responding to Dara's call for assistance, and wisely kept on strengthening his own kingdom. Maharana Raj Singh's neutrality in the war succession resulted in vast territorial gains for Mewar. During the reign of Maharana Jagat Singh I Some parganas of Mewar including Purmandal, Kherabad, Mandalgarh, Jahajpur, Sawer, Banera, Phuliya, Badnore, Hurda etc. were under Mughal control. He reoccupied them in the turbulent times of Shah Jahan's illness. He empowered Malpura, Toda, Tonk , Sawer, Lalsot and Chatsu. Maharana also established his hegemony over Dungarpur, Banswara Pratapgarh, Gyaspur and Dewalia. Maharana also set peace with local Bhils. He recruited them in his army, solidifying his army and defence thus settling peace in Mewar.\n\nWhen Aurangzeb became the emperor, his anti - Hindu policies grew so harsh that Maharana could not resist opposing him. He also continued to breech the treaty with Mughals by repairing the fort Chittorgarh like his father. However, Maharana kept his relations with the Mughals by sending gifts and his Prince to the Mughal court. In year 1658 CE, Kanwar Sultan Singh went to congratulate Aurangzeb for his success in the war of Mughal succession. Delighted with this meeting, Aurangzeb returned all the provinces captured by the Mughals during the time of Maharana Jagat Singh I. In 1660 CE, Kishangarh's princess Charumati sent marriage proposal to Maharana Raj Singh, as she was being forced to marry Aurangzeb. He abducted her and married her, which outraged Aurangzeb. In 1669 CE, orthodox Aurangzeb gave the order to destroy Hindu temples and educational institutions and re-imposed Jaziya, Maharana opposed it openly. However, when Maharana gave refuge to Maharaja Ajit Singh of Jodhpur, Aurangzeb finally attacked Mewar. He attacked in 1679 CE, the Maharana resisted the attack by using guerrilla tactics. Aurangzeb was camping at Debari, after which he sent some forces to Udaipur. He ordered the destruction of Jagdish temple. It was resisted by 20 warriors of Mewar under the leadership of Naruji and all were killed fighting. Mughal forces destroyed many idols in the temple complex. Aurangzeb ordered his men to find the Maharana in the mountains, however no one succeeded. Disappointed Aurangzeb went to Delwara, destroyed temples and left for Ajmer.\n\nAurangzeb, the Mughal emperor by his policies had abandoned his predecessors' legacy of pluralism and religious tolerance, citing his reintroduction of the Jaziya tax. He ordered the demolition of all-important temples within his empire and schools just to celebrate his 53rd birthday. It resulted in relocation of many idols to safer places because of this order. In this chaos, there was some family dispute in the Goswami brothers of Pushtimarg Haveli's third house belonging to Shree Dwarkadheeshji of Gokul. Thus, Goswami Vrajbhushanlal ji first went to Ahmedabad with the idol of Shree Dwarkadheeshji, but he was not sure about the protection there. Therefore, he sent a letter to Maharana Raj Singh who assured him for complete protection and invited him to Mewar. In 1670 CE the idol of Shree Dwarkadheeshji came from Ahmedabad to village Sadri in Mewar. The consecration of Shree Dwaradheeshji was ritualized in village Asautiya. Later, in the year 1719 CE Maharana Sangram Singh II consecrated the temple at Girdhargarh, Kankroli, on the bank of Lake Rajsamand. Due to the intolerance of Aurangzeb, Goswami Hariray Mahaprabhuji supervised the journey of Shree Vitthalnathji to Kheda Village (Nathdwara) through Khamnor. In the same manner, on 26th October 1669, Goswami Damodarlalji left from Giriraj Goverdhandham near Mathura with the idol of Shreenathji and reached Mewar via Agra, Kota, Bundi, Pushkar, Kishangarh, Chopasani (Jodhpur). From Jodhpur, he sent his uncle Govind ji (Gopinathji) to meet the Maharana. Maharana discussed this issue with his mother and graciously welcomed Shreenathji to Mewar and promised full protection by any means. After that Goswami Damodarlalji along with Shreenathji reached Mewar. In 1672 CE, Maharana went to Ghanerao to welcome Shreenathji in Mewar and granted the Village of Sihad (Nathdwara) for the establishment of Shreenathji's Temple which is about 50 kms from Udaipur. On 2nd April 1679 CE, Jaziya tax was re-imposed on non-Muslims by Aurangzeb and the order to demolish the Hindu temples was an act of absolutism. Maharana Raj Singh opposed the Mughal emperor. He wrote a disapproving letter to the emperor.\n\nMaharana Raj Singh was a farsighted and able ruler. When he decided to oppose the Mughal rule, he maintained good relations with his neighbouring kingdoms. During the peace period in Mewar, the defence forces were highly strategized through which many of the discreet neighbouring kingdoms like Dungarpur, Banswara and Pratapgarh were forced to accept Mewar's suzerainty but through respectful means. He also had matrimonial alliances to strengthen the political situation in Mewar. Maharana Raj Singh married Kunwar Bai of Bundi, daughter of Rao Shatrushal in his princely period. He also had matrimonial alliances with Jaisalmer, Idar, Kishangarh too. Maharana's sister was married to Bikaner Prince Anup Singh and daughter Ajab Kunwar to Prince Bhav Singh of Bandhav. When Aurangzeb tried to conquer Marwar, he also gave refuge to the infant king of Marwar Ajit Singh, son of Maharaja Jaswant Singh in his captivity. In this era of continues struggle, Maharana Raj Singh gave refuge and aid to the brave warrior Durgadas Rathore, who was known for his Mughal resistance. When Sirohi's Prince Udaybhan captivated his own father and sat on the throne, the Maharana heard of this unjust act and he ordered Ram Singh Ranawat to attack Sirohi. Udaybhan lost the battle and fled. King Akheraj was reinstated on the throne. Maharana used all means including marriages and peace treaties to maintain friendly relations with other kingdoms. Maharana shrewdly increased the number of his supporting kingdoms and that is why he was able to oppose Mughal supremacy.\n\nMaharana Raj Singh's political strategies were so strong that in despite of such tough situations, he was able to devote time and money for construction in Mewar. During his heir apparent period Kanwar Raj Singh built a Palace called Sarvaritu Vilas (Sarbat Vilas) and got a step-well made nearby. In 1659 CE, he completed the fort wall and the gate at Debari. He completed half built temples of Lord Shiva, Surya, Ganapati and Shani in Shree Jagdish temple, Udaipur which were half built in his father's time. Raj Singh constructed the largest lake of the time known as Rajsamundra (1662-1676 CE), with Nau Chowki Pal and a palace was constructed on the nearby hill and along with Shree Dwarakdheeshji temple. Near the lake, a town with his name Rajnagar also prospered. In 1664 CE, he built Shree Amba Mata temple in Udaipur. He built Lake Janasagar (Badi), west of Udaipur named after his mother Jana Devi near village Badi. Maharana also got constructed a new bridge near Indrasar (Indrasarover) at Eklingji. His queen Jhali Maharani got constructed a step-well called Ekmukhi Bawdi. In 1675 CE, queen Charumati got a step well built at Rajnagar and Panwar Rani got the Step well named 'Jaya Bawdi' made at Debari, now known as Trimukhi Bawdi. In 1668 CE, his son Kanwar Jai Singh built the Lake Rang Sagar. His minister, Fatehchand also got a step-well built at village Bedwas.\n\nIn Mewar, there is a local custom of worshipping 'Sagas ji' considered as 'Lok Devtas', lesser Gods and both the sons of Maharana Raj Singh, Sultan Singh and Sardar Singh are worshipped as such. The local folklore is that, the mother of Kanwar Sardar Singh wanted her son to be the next Maharana and she brainwashed Raj Singh with the help of a priest against Kanwar Sultan Singh. Thus, Kanwar Sultan Singh was assassinated. Then, the Rani wrote a note to her confident priest saying that she has got rid of Kanwar Sultan Singh, now they should poison the Maharana so that her son Kanwar Sardar Singh could ascend the throne of Mewar. After some time, this treachery planned by the Rani and the Purohit came out in the open and Maharana was very angry, so much so that the Rani and the Purohit were executed immediately. When Kanwar Sardar Singh came to know of this intrigue, he took poison and he died, as he felt deeply grieved because of his elder brother being put in the wrong of whom he was very fond of. Elder brother Kanwar Sultan Singh's cenotaph is at Sarvaritu Vilas and younger Kanwar Sardar Singh's cenotaph is at Kanwarpada Mahal, where they both are worshiped as Sagas ji.\n\nDue to Maharana Raj Singh's love for art, architecture and literature, his period was a time of literary development even in the times of struggle. Where on one hand Maharana was struggling with the Mughals, on the other hand, he himself wrote poems. He gave royalty too many Sanskrit scholars, poets, artists and architects thus continued to contribute in enriching art and literature. During the time of Maharana Raj Singh, important texts such as Ranchod Bhatt's Rajprashasti Mahakavyam, Sadashiv’s Rajratnakar, Mankavi's Rajavilas, Rajprakash by Kishordas were composed and manuscripts of historical texts were also copied under Maharana's guidance. The principal engravers of Rajasamudra were Mukund, Dalapati, Maha Singh, Mokam Singh, Vyagrah who materialised Maharana Raj Singh's speculative imagination. The idols built at Ekmukhi, Sundar and Trimukhi step wells indicate the developed sculpture art.\n\nChawand painting school, which began during the period of Maharana Pratap, was also glorified during his reign. With the arrival of Shreenathji in Mewar, the emergence of a new painting school - Nathdwara style of painting was developed during this period, which is also known as Pichhwai. Maharana Raj Singh gave patronage of manuscript illustration. After his accession, he got completed the Ramayana Series, which was started by his father Maharana Jagat Singh I.
