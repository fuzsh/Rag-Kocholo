        "text": "I am a #compulsiveDoodler who just loves Doodling. The free-flowing unstructured repeating patterns slowly evolve into a meaningful design. Given time, pen and paper, I am bound to Doodle. It is meditation to me.\n\nDoodling, unlike Mandala and other art forms, does not have strict grammar. It does not believe in Perfection. It takes life as free-flowing and is comfortable with an unstructured approach. I experiment with Mandala, ZenTangle, Sacred Geometry and Tantra symbolism from the shamanic world in my doodles.\n\nI am open to commissioned work. It can be a free-flow open structure, objects, heroes, mythology, tantra, projects, services and even signatures. To commission an assignment or buy available artwork original or print, do send an email or connect on Twitter S_kotnala.\n\nWhy black and white?\n\nThat’s a good question. Why Black and White when we live in a world full of colour? Colour is natural to life. However, by wanting to do most of my work in Black and white, I want to look at it differently- away from reality. It is beautiful as it represents the duality of life. It asks you to stand and take a call a decision, a side. Removing colour makes it tough- as limitations and constraints get imposed. There is that much you can do when you limit the playing medium. However, it not only pushes the artist to focus but also makes the audience look at the other elements and composition.\n\nIMPORTANT. If you plan to commission or buy.\n\nDoodles below are offered unframed. Sizes are approximate. Price excludes 12% GST. Free shipping in India for original which comes with a certificate. Additional shipping charges for print apply- Print is serialised and not more than 20 prints will be made of any original artwork. Framing if desired can be done at additional cost but it is best if they get framed later. The sale only gives the original or the print and does not give the buyer a right to use them for the pattern or create any other item of commercial value including items for self-consumption like the mobile cover, wallet, canvas shoe etc.\n\nMYTHOLOGY SERIES 1\n\nAll approx 24 cm X 17 cm ( Variation plus minus 1-2 cm).\n\nORIGINAL: INR 10,000 INR – unless separately indicated\n\nORIGINAL: INR 15,000 INR with permission to print in poster-calendar etc 500 Units\n\nPRINT DIGITAL: INR 1,500\n\nPRINT CANVAS: INR 3,000 8*12 ( Studio Mounts)\n\nSPECIAL -ALL THREE – BRAHMA – VISHNU- MAHESH\n\nORIGINAL: INR 20,000\n\nDIGITAL PRINT: 5,000\n\nCANVAS PRINT: 8000\n\nBRAHMA VISHNU MAHESH\n\nBRAHMA ELEEMSNTS AND REPRESENTATION: Central circle- conscious and subconscious mind.
