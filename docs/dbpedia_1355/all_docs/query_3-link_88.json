        "text": "There is probably no more ridiculous development in the history of and writing about music than the notion of ‘labels’. Taking a piece of music and categorising it into a single ‘genre’ or ‘style’ is an exercise in futility. Oft quoted but eternally ignored, Duke Ellington’s saw that there is only ‘good music and the other kind’ remains all there needs to be said about the problem.\n\nYet, for those of us who think possessing massive music libraries is an important thing, the issue is a practical one. Whether you have walls and walls of LPs, racks of CDs or hard discs full of digital files, having everything labelled simply ‘good’ or ‘other’ is not particularly helpful. And unless you know every album or track in your collection intimately and can find it easily, most of the time you’re going to find labels and tags and categories a necessary, if silly, evil.\n\nIn recent years these labels and genres have proliferated like so many psychedelic rabbits. I’m forever amused by the new labels people come up with for their music: shoegazer, bedwetter, garage punk, bubbletrance, aggrotech, crustpunk, deep psychobilly, fidget house etc. etc. What the delicate idiosyncrasies of each category are, are beyond me and probably to those who listen to them as well, but it is fun that’s for sure. My own practice is to keep it simple. Pop, World, Jazz, Reggae, Country, Blues, R&B, Classical and a few other old fashioned labels I picked up from the record stores I used to haunt suit me just fine.\n\nBut the challenges keep popping up.\n\nTake today’s share for example. The album is called Disco Jazz, which sounds like the producers couldn’t be bothered to think of anything interesting. Slap a couple labels on it and see if it sells. The Indian Canadian production from the early 80s certainly (in some parts) qualifies as disco-esque. But definitely not jazz. Unless by jazz you mean slang for ‘stuff’. On the internet the album is labelled, ‘funk, soul, disco’ and even ‘Bollywood funk’. Not so much misleading as plain irrelevant. There is nothing funky here that James Brown or the boys from Cymande would recognise and, as for soul, well, that’s just another planet. So, how does one label this music?\n\nFor my money this is non-film Indian pop music sung in Bengali. The singer is a mysterious sukhi roti– looking college girl named Rupa Biswas. Not a spectacular voice by Indian standards but given its focus on getting people on the dance floor, adequate to the task. What is really interesting about this record is the music.\n\nIndia was introduced to the concept of disco music in the early 80s through (what else) the movies. Though it wasn’t the first, Firoz Khan’s 1980 blockbuster Qurbani (Sacrifice) used the sound of upbeat, semi-electronic synth and bass, disco lights and scantily clad women instrumentalists (prefiguring Robert Palmer’s Addicted to Love by half a decade) to mesmerise a nation.\n\nAap Jaisa Koi was India’s first massive disco hit and led to the creation of a new sound that infiltrated the movies for the next ten years. The most famous names in Indian disco were larger-than-life musical director Bappi Lahiri and composer/arranger/performer Babla. Though both men produced some interesting work that has found new audiences in recent years, they never ventured too far from the Qurbani sound.\n\nDisco Jazz on the other hand is in an entirely different realm. Biswas is backed by a crack group of Indian and Canadian musicians led by none other than Ustad Aashish Khan, one of India’s outstanding living musicians on sarod. Khan has long collaborated with Western pop and jazz musicians, led so called ‘fusion’ groups [Shringar, Wonderwall, Shanti] promoted Indian classical music through his educational efforts and scored or participated in the soundtracks for films such The Man Who Would Be King, Gandhi and a number of Satyajit Ray’s films.\n\nHe’s supported by the amazing guitarist Don Pope, who with Khansahib creates the energy and drive and excitement of this record.\n\nPopeand Khan trade solos and jugalbandi back and forth throughout this set daring the rest of the band that includes renown jazz drummer Robin Tufts, bassist John Johnston, tablasaaz and accompanist of Ali Akbar Khan and others, Pranesh Khan, keyboardist Geoff Ball, synthesizer Rhonda Padmos, and percussionist Frank Lockwood to keep pace. Pope’s guitar playing is fluid, gliding effortlessly between jazzy textures and hot dancefloor strumming. As for the sarod, Aashish Khan makes it sound as if he’s playing a mandolin or bazouki in a back street rembetika outfit.\n\nThis disco is about as far away from Bappi Lahiriand Qurbani as you can get. It is tough, serious, masterful but still immense fun.\n\nWhatever became of Rupa Biswas? Of all the principals, she is the hardest to track down. One of the tracks from Disco Jazz, Moja Bhari Moja,was included in the 2012 ‘art’ film Miss Lovely but the only other reference I’ve been able to track down to a Rupa Biswas is of a Bengali woman purported to be Rupa, lip syncing and dancing. Not sure if this is THE Rupa or if it is a completely different Ms. Biswas altogether. But it sounds a bit disco-y so my bet is Rupa is still out there somewhere.\n\nDisco Jazz is a rare jewel. I hope you enjoy it.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\nMoja Bhari Moja\n\nEast West Shuffle\n\nAaj Shanibar\n\nAaye Morshume Be-Reham Duniya\n\nDISCO\n\nMumbai’s film industry is so visible and influential that the ugly term ‘Bollywood’ has become shorthand for Indian popular cinema. This is not only inaccurate for northern Indian cinema itself, which uses Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi and Bengali as it’s main languages but it totally misrepresents the films of southern India.\n\nSeveral hundred kilometres south of Mumbai is the city of Chennai, formerly known as Madras. In this city in 1917, just four (or five, depending on how you’re counting) years after the first Indian feature film was released, an importer of American cars, Mr. Nagaraj Mudaliar, was infected by the movie bug too. Being rich enough to damn the torpedos Mr Mudaliar arranged for a few lessons on the film cameras of the day and was so impressed by his own aptitude he set up South India’s first film studio in the quiet suburb of Puruswalkam.\n\nHis first film and indeed, the first South Indian feature was a retelling of a story from the Vedic epic Mahabharata about a military commander who is so besotted by the beautiful Draupadi that he through a series of means, fair and foul, manages a rendezvous. Unfortunately, he is met by the even mightier warrior Bhima who slaughters him and ends the episode. The movie was called Keechaka Vadham (The Extermination of Keechaka) and was a smash hit, netting Mr Mudaliar even more riches.\n\nIn his footsteps over the subsequent years Madrasi film makers became famous around the world for their films, many of which were in the religious costume drama mode of Keechaka Vadham. And while I daren’t even think of getting into the history of South Indian film making here, suffice it to say, that films coming out of Madras and later Trivandrum and Hyderabad have been ground breaking, innovative and completely unreliant upon whatever was happening up in Bombay.\n\nAnd it is especially in the area of music that the Tamil film industry has consistently held its own, and often, superseded ‘Bollywood’. As eclectic in its inspirations as the northern film industry the Madras-based music directors always brought a more urgent, jagged and exploring edge to their music. Using hiphop, jazz, electronic keyboards and other trends before or more vigorously then their counterparts in the north.\n\nJust listen to some of A.R. Rahman‘s music, especially before he became an international phenom, to get a taste. Of even better, go to the music of his guru, Illayraja or the work of Vijay Anand to really wig out.\n\nIt is some of Illayraja’s compositions that we share today. All of the songs are sung by Krishnan Nair Shantakumari Chithra, aka K.S. Chithra South India’s answer to Lata Mangeshkar. Again, that’s an unfair and inaccurate description. Both are women, yes. Both have made hits too numerous to count by singing in the film industry, yes. But the differences are more remarkable.\n\nChithra is a classically trained singer in the South Indian carnatic tradition and has established an equally hailed and glorious career as a singer of classical/light classical music. Lata, for her part has released a number of religious (bhajan) recordings but her reputation is firmly based upon her incredible run as the predominant female popular singer of the last two generations. Hear the name Lata and you know you’re going to get a film song. But if, like me, you hear the name K.S. Chithra you’re probably, like me, going to think first of a ragini or thumri or bhajan.\n\nAt the same time where Lata’s vocal register is in the upper end (to say the least) Chithra has a voice that is to my reckoning more nuanced, supple and well rounded. More like Lata‘s sister Asha Bhosle.\n\nI’m unable to speak Tamil so can’t vouch for the lyrical content of these songs but you don’t need to be a linguist to enjoy them. The endlessly inventive arrangements that see styles and sound elements from any number of genres (from 80s synths to 60s lounge trumpets to slap bass and electronic squelches) popping up in each track, keep things bubbling along and are as interesting as the vocals. That’s why the title of the album has the subtitle “With Illayraja”. This is a joint effort. A great singer interpreting the work of another great artiste and composer.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01 Indha Vennila\n\n02 Yaaro Sonnaangalaam\n\n03 Vandadhe\n\n04 Chitthirai Maasatthu\n\n05 Manjai Ndhi\n\n06 Kaiyodu Ennai\n\n07 Vaa Veliye\n\n08 Oh My Love\n\n09 Sikkunnu\n\n10 Hey Maina\n\n11 Rathiri Thookkam\n\n12 Oru Pooncholai\n\n13 Pon Maaney\n\n14 Poojaikettha\n\n15 Nethu Oruthara\n\n16 Kankaliley\n\n17 Velli Kizhamai\n\nVSC\n\nThe meme that fronts this post sums up the music and the artistic persona of Attaullah Khan Niazi ‘Issakelvi’ beautifully. Khan is shown guiding a motor-rickshaw of the sort found in large numbers in Pakistan’s small to middling towns. He’s looking for fares in the backlanes, known as galiyan in Punjabi, of one of these towns. Could be Okhara, or Jhang, or his own native Mianwali. The narrow brick streets are (unbelieveably) depicted vacant of all other human and animal life. [Its as if the Prime Minister is expected for a local visit the place is so spic and span.] But these are the home neighborhoods of millions of Pakistani workers and urban migrants who exist in the category sociologists like to call ‘working class’ or ‘lower middle class’ or ‘proletariat’. Just ahead of him a beautiful Punjabi housewife lingers a bit longer than necessary with the day’s washing, waiting for the handsome ‘Issakhelvi’ to perhaps chat her up. Maybe he will try to give her a ‘lift’.\n\nAttaullah Khan, more than any other singer of his generation, holds a special place in the heart of working class Pakistani Punjabis. His songs of love (lost, wanted, faithful, ideal and betrayed) have given men courage and women hope for nearly nearly 40 years now. He sings (or did before the likes of the movies, VCDs and Coke Studio got hold of him) with a fully open heart and voice. Why his audience love him is, he is as authentic as hard day’s work and plays no games. What you see is what you get. And as millions of his fans know, there is a helluva a lot of get from this truly unique Pakistani folk singer.\n\nMeri Pasand, the title of this collection originally issued on cassette, means ‘my choice’. And whether indeed it is true that Khan selected these tracks or, whether some narrow-tied junior executive in Karachi did the honours, it does not matter. If you are in the market for the ‘essential’ short collection of Issakhelvi’s magic then this is it. There are many songs that don’t make this edition and there are more comprehensive box sets out there, but if you could have but one single album of his in your library then this is the one to get.\n\nThe sound quality is very high thanks to the boys at EMI Pakistan and the track list captures Khan during his most powerful and influential 1980s phase. He sings in Punjabi, Urdu and his native Seraiki and amply demonstrates his ability to sing in a variety of styles and induce multiple emotions.\n\nThis is pure gold. And definitely worth hanging out in the galiyan waiting for him to pass by.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01 Chan Kithan Guzari\n\n02 Dil Lagaya Tha\n\n03 We Bol Sanun\n\n04 Balo Batyan\n\n05 Donon Ko Aasaki Na\n\n06 Lalai Tun Mundri\n\n07 Bannu Dee Mehndi\n\n08 Ni Uthan Waley\n\n09 Kherey Heer Nun\n\n10 Be Dard Dhola\n\nAKNI"
