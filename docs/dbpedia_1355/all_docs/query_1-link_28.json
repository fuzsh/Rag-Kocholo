        "text": "The experience and the ensuing structuring of time forms a constitutive part of human cultures. There are many ways of coming to terms with time, calendars and historiographies being its most common cultural representations. The contributions to this volume deal with lesser known figurations that result directly from the various perceptions about time and phenomena related to time. Diachronous investigations in various parts of Asia (predominantly South Asia) reveal a broad spectrum of such visual and literary figurative manifestations. While Hinduism recognizes a divine personification of time and allocates the ominous factor time in an ontological proximity to death, other cultures of Asia have developed their own specific concepts and strategies. This collection of essays combines perspectives of various disciplines on figurations in which time congeals, as it were. These figurations result from local time regimes, and beyond demonstrating their diversity of forms this volume offers coordinates for a comparison of cultures. The topics include chronograms as well as early Buddhist topoi of the vastness of time, the Indian Jaina representation of both temporality and non-temporality and the teachings of a Mediaeval Zen master hinting at the more stationary aspects of time.\n\nTowards the close of the first millennium CE, thinkers in India began to reflect upon the nature of time. Coevally, there arose a set of other practices. One of them was recording historical time, which paved way for the appearance of calendars by the second and the third centuries CE. Another practice was the articulation of systems of cosmic time, such as the four yugas described in the Mahābhārata and the scheme of utsarpiṇī and avasarpiṇi in Jaina texts such as the Jaṃbudvīpaprajñapti. Yet another practice was the production of narratives that enabled the imagination of time in novel ways. These developments let to complex understandings concerning the nature of time and its relationship with existence. By the fifth century, it enabled the grammarian Bhartṛhari to evolve a refined theory of time, and by the ninth century, when Jinasēna II wrote his Pūrvapurāṇa, time and the past had come to be seen as sources of knowledge. This paper presents a historical overview of this process.\n\nClock-time differentiates and systematises in a way rarely endorsed by small-scale societies, where the tendency is to reject hierarchy based on the measurement of time. Taking my lead from the Karawari-speaking Ambonwari of the East Sepik Province of Papua New Guinea, I introduce the concept of egalitarian temporality produced by never ending competition between different individuals and groups. The villagers are themselves responsible for creating periods and ways of being in both their environment and society, and they actively participate in dramatic episodes intended to cut into their existent ways of life. These ‘cuts’ then create desired changes. I argue that time in the Sepik and egalitarian small-scale societies in general is very much agentive and thus possessed, held and seen by individuals and groups, with periods defined by and organized around future oriented projects.\n\nVarious attempts have been made to systematize fundamental patterns of temporal organization and to establish links between these patterns and natural and cultural evolution. This paper compares three pertinent theories of time in the light of evidence from Japanese cultural history: the hierarchical theory of time by J.T. Fraser, the fourfold paradigm of time imageries by Y. Maki, and the social learning theory of time by G. Dux. It demonstrates that the \" canonical forms of time \" established by these authors can be brought into meaningful conversation with each other and that they suggest helpful methodologies for the analysis of temporal perspectives in Japanese history. At the same time, comparative analysis reveals reasons for caution against simplified evolutionary accounts of cultural history. From very early on, Japanese literary sources evince an acute consciousness of conflicting temporalities. At the same time, there is no unified \" Japanese concept of time \" – neither trans-historically nor at any given period. Copyrighted material.

In Western cultures time is measured by clocks and calendars using numbers. Calendars and clocks enable us to measure time intervals: years, months, days, hours, minutes and seconds. The past is thought of as located behind our backs, while the future is in front or ahead. Is this the way that everyone, in every culture, thinks and talks about time? This documentary tells the story of how three indigenous cultures of Brazil, think about, talk about and experience time. The Huni Kuĩ, Kamaiurá, and Awetý people talk about time very differently from us. These cultures do not use clocks and calendars. So individuals do not count their birthdays. Instead, they think about their lives in terms of life stages and the process of learning and acquiring skills throughout the life span. For these cultures, time is thought about in terms of events and happenings, in nature and in the social world. The sounds of the crickets, the sun and the sunlight, the stars, the water level in the rivers, the rain, the breeze and the stars indicate time. The relationship between people and the environment is crucial for understanding time. Time, they say, is not behind or in front of me, but it is in my heart, in my eyes or in my mind. Vera da Silva Sinha is a PhD in Linguistics at the University of East Anglia. Her research topic is linguistic and cultural conceptualizations of time in indigenous languages of Brazil. This research investigates the relationship between spatial and temporal language and concepts, and the way in which concepts of time vary between languages and cultures. Through field research she tries to understand the way in which indigenous Amazonian concepts of time are organized and expressed in language structure, cosmologies and myths. Vera obtained her Bachelor's degree in Portuguese language and literature at the Federal University of Rondônia in 1994. She has successfully completed two Master's degrees in Social Sciences (Anthropology, Federal University of Pernambuco, 2000; Comparative Criminal Justice Studies, University of Portsmouth, 2004). She has worked in diverse academic and non-academic professional settings, from the criminal justice system, through heritage and community engagement to anthropological and linguistic research in Brazil, Sweden and the UK. Vera's research interests include indigenous and minority identities, mythic and historical narratives, immaterial heritage, number and quantificational concepts, motion, space and time. https://vimeo.com/261572557"
