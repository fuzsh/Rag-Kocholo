        "text": "The experience and the ensuing structuring of time forms a constitutive part of human cultures. There are many ways of coming to terms with time, calendars and historiographies being its most common cultural representations. The contributions to this volume deal with lesser known figurations that result directly from the various perceptions about time and phenomena related to time. Diachronous investigations in various parts of Asia (predominantly South Asia) reveal a broad spectrum of such visual and literary figurative manifestations. While Hinduism recognizes a divine personification of time and allocates the ominous factor time in an ontological proximity to death, other cultures of Asia have developed their own specific concepts and strategies. This collection of essays combines perspectives of various disciplines on figurations in which time congeals, as it were. These figurations result from local time regimes, and beyond demonstrating their diversity of forms this volume offers coordinates for a comparison of cultures. The topics include chronograms as well as early Buddhist topoi of the vastness of time, the Indian Jaina representation of both temporality and non-temporality and the teachings of a Mediaeval Zen master hinting at the more stationary aspects of time.\n\nThe idea of impermanence (anitya) is known as a critical concept found in Buddhism, regarded as one of the three marks of existence (trilaksana), along with suffering (duhkha) and non-self or self-annihilation (anātman). Buddha propagated the law of dependent arising (pratītyasamutpāda), which presents the idea that any phenomena arise in dependence on outer conditions and because of the natural flow of these conditions. Therefore, no worldly phenomena have a permanent essence or existence. The transience of all things deals with the awareness to ephemera, like ageing, illness, death, and rebirth, admitting that all conditioned things are in a constant state of flux. The notion that time is an illusion has been discussed more recently by physicists such as Julian Barbour, Carlo Rovelli, among others. However, this is a well-known concept in religious thought extant not only in Dharmic religions but also in Abrahamic and Taoic religions. Religious thought demonstrates different perspectives toward the impermanent nature of life, manifested in the sacred scriptures, in the classical spiritual literature, as well as in the religious arts. This paper examines the representation of the doctrines of impermanence and momentariness in Vajrayana Buddhist visual culture as a form of self-expression of the transient nature of the worldly existence. Ancient art treatises deal with the subject of artistic creativity as a form of self-expression and a means by which one could achieve another state of mind, transcending his human temporal condition. Therefore, the act of creating an image is often considered a process of visualisation to pursuit spiritual edification and meditation, leading to a way of living or a form of spiritual liberation. This paper argues that the religious concept of impermanence is represented in Buddhist visual culture in two ways: first, by the mnemonic function of the image as a reminder of our transient condition, through expressions of momentaneous existence, material detachment and emptiness; and second, by the intrinsic tempos involved in the creation of images and ritual implements, which emulates the constant state of flux of all conditioned things. Resumo A ideia de impermanência (anitya) é um conceito fundamental no Budismo, que se define como uma das três evidências de existência (trilaksana), juntamente com sofrimento (duhkha) e o não-ser ou niilismo do eu (anātman). O Buda difundiu a lei da originação dependente (pratītyasamutpāda), que essencialmente apresenta a ideia de que qualquer fenómeno emerge em dependência de condições exteriores e como resultado da dinâmica natural dessas condições. Consequentemente, qualquer fenómeno mundano é inibido de essência ou existência permanente. A natureza transitória de todas as coisas relaciona-se intrinsecamente com o efémero, o envelhecimento, a doença, a morte e o renascimento, admitindo-se que todas as coisas condicionadas se encontram num estado de constante fluxo. A noção de que o tempo é, na verdade, uma ilusão tem sido amplamente discutida por fisicos como Julian Barbour, Carlo Roseli, e outros. Contudo, a ilusão do tempo é conceito central no pensamento religioso não apenas entre as religiões Dármicas, mas também nas religiões Abraâmicas e Taoicas. O pensamento religioso evidencia perspectivas distintas sobre a natureza impermanente da vida, tanto nos textos sagrados como na literatura espiritual e nas artes religiosas. Este texto examina a representação das doutrinas da impermanência e momentaneidade na cultural visual do Budismo Vajrayana como uma forma de auto-expressão e meditação na essência transitória das coisas mundanas. Antigos tratados de arte exploram estas praticas artísticas como uma forma de auto-expressão e como um método ritualístico através do qual o praticante pretende atingir um elevado estado psíquico, transcendendo a sua condição humana temporal. Consequentemente, o acto de criar uma imagem, como resultado de uma performance ritual, é, em si, um processo de visualização no sentido de um estado meditativo e de edificação espiritual, conducente a uma outra forma de existência e liberação. Este texto, propõe que o conceito teológico de impermanência é representado na cultura visual Budista de duas formas: primeiro, através de uma função didática mnemônica da imagem, trazendo à memória a nossa condição transitória, através de expressões de existência momentânea, desapego material e vazio; e, em segundo, através de tempos intrínsecos envolvidos no processo de criação de imagens e implementos rituais que emulam o estado constante de fluxo de todas as coisas condicionadas.\n\nThe widespread inauguration of the talkies during the early thirties, along with an altered environment of 'secular' national polity and feelings (the rise of organized dalit movements, or the proliferation of regional and linguistic impulses) precipitated a significant change in the panorama of Indian cinema. The mythological was gradually replaced by ostensibly 'secular' formats like the reformist social or the stunt film in terms of generic preponderance. This shift from an agrarian twilight to what are apparently urban, juridical, and secular-constitutive themes of the modern spectrum demands attention. It can be argued that despite the vanishing of gods and monsters as formal entities on screen, a primal mythic impelling remains consistent in the dominant 'secular/realistic' dispensation of narrating the national in the subsequent decades. A genealogical understanding of these exchanges between epic, lyrical, and ceremonial ontologies and realist-prosaic forms of representing the world could allow one to see how they have acquired an altogether new dimension in the contemporary age of planetary electronic publicity. Undoubtedly, this relationship between divinations of the old and a plentiful multiplicity of the scientific/social world of now has undergone many complex transmutations since the epochal years of the young republic. A study of that in the light of the contemporary could be instructive, particularly because the field of exchanges is one of perverse contaminations, and no longer amenable to agonistic, dialectical polarities like the traditional and the modern. In popular Indian films of present times, an ideology of Hindutva, or its founding myths can actually enter into assemblages of cinematic spectacle and affect with metropolitan lifestyles, managerial codas of the 'free market', individualism, consumer desire, and neo-liberal imperatives of polity and government. This discussion will essay out from an examination of how a founding imagination of national becoming is 'worlded' in a new geo-televisual universe in Mani Shankar's 2004 film Rudraksh. In the register of space, the film inducts a transnational, multitudinous world that threatens to imperil all ossified notions of selfhood into the sovereign sphere of an emergent Hindu Being. In the dimension of temporality, it seeks to envelop the shocks and welters of historical transformation with a figure of time that is the eternal. The project, however, is to understand a habit of thought rather than investigate, for its own ends, a particular film that, apart from being a box office disaster, is also particularly unsatisfying in terms of aesthetics. Shankar's film can be of critical interest only in so far as it provides a few instantiating diagrams of commerce between an ideology of present day metropolitan Hindutva and the manifold paraphernalia and practices of globalization."
