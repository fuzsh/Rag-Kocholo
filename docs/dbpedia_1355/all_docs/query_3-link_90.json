One can lose count of the number of shops there, and the competition amongst them is strong. But they all do their business, and there seems no dearth of people going there. I am not sure if people just go there because they dont have have preferred places. or they go there with reference. Either way, all one has to do is pass by slowly in the area, and you will have people (from the shops) jumping in front of your car to try sell you stuff. The car can be old, too. But new cars even just passing through have a tough time there. Persuasive lot.\n\nThese days I only go there for Devraj / Nagraj ( seat cover work). I have stopped going there after getting conned on some Sony speakers long back ( even though I went with reference). The only other time I went there was for the crash guard for my Sumo, back in 2005.\n\nSo it happened that I had to go to the area for some accessories. Specifically for a roof-top luggage carrier and crash guard for a Trax Toofan for my cousin. We had a reference, but even as we crossed Lal bagh main gate towards Minerva, the shop guys started rushing one after the other. We were forced to slow for each person, and we had to keep shouting NO NO to each shop guy. Finally made it to Minerva and turned into JC Road for the shop in question. More (other) shops there, and these people started rushing in, as expected. Rather than wait for them to come, each time we spotted one - I stretch my hand out of the window with a thumbs-down sign. They got the message, and passage was easier.\n\n---\n\nAt the shop itself, though the guy had initially ( on phone) said he had the stuff, he did not have what we wanted. Asked around, but no luck.\n\nThe visit itself was not in vain as we got the steering wheel wrapped in leather, by Nagraj."
