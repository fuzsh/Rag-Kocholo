In the contralateral, unaffected breast, HIV RNA quantity did not significantly increase (log(10) 0.15 copies per milliliter, 95% CI: -0.41 to 0.10). Increase was more marked in women with abscess or with a greater number of mastitis symptoms. HIV RNA was not significantly different between affected and unaffected women, except at the time of diagnosis. Breast milk HIV RNA increased modestly in the affected breast with unilateral mastitis or abscess and returned to prepathology levels with symptom resolution. Contralateral HIV RNA was not affected.

Rates of CSF HIV RNA escape vary in the literature. In persons living with HIV (PLWH) undergoing lumbar puncture examination for clinical reasons, we assessed rates of CSF HIV RNA escape. Persons living with HIV attending a designated HIV neurology service undergoing CSF assessment for clinical reasons between January 2015 and April 2017 were included in the study. CSF HIV RNA escape was defined as HIV RNA â¥Â 0.5 log 10 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL higher than plasma HIV RNA or detectable CSF HIV RNA when plasma HIV RNA was <Â 20 copies/mL. Clinical factors associated with CSF HIV RNA were assessed using logistic regression modelling. Of 38 individuals, 35 were receiving antiretroviral therapy, 30 were male and their mean age was 51Â years. Clinical reasons for CSF assessment included investigation for cognitive decline (nÂ =Â 25), early syphilis (nÂ =Â 4) and other central nervous system (CNS) conditions (nÂ =Â 9). HIV RNA was detectable in plasma and CSF in seven and six individuals, respectively, with two individuals (5.3%) meeting the definition of CSF escape. Detectable CSF HIV RNA was associated with a detectable plasma HIV RNA (PÂ <Â 0.001) and a history of known antiretroviral drug resistance mutations (PÂ =Â 0.021). The prevalence of CSF viral escape in PLWH undergoing lumbar puncture examination for clinical reasons is lower than previously reported.

Scott; Peshu, Norbert M.; Sanders, Eduard J.; Krieger, John N.; Coombs, Robert W.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nObjectives Antiretroviral therapy (ART) decreases HIV-1 RNA levels in semen and reduces sexual transmission from HIV-1-infected men. Our objective was to study the time course and magnitude of seminal HIV-1 RNA decay after initiation of efavirenz-based ART among 13 antiretroviral-naÃ¯ve Kenyan men. Methods HIV-1 RNA was quantified (lower limit of detection, 120 copies/mL) in blood and semen at baseline and over the first month of ART. Median log10 HIV-1 RNA was compared at each time-point using Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests. Perelsonâs two-phase viral decay model and nonlinear random effects were used to compare decay rates in blood and semen. Results Median baseline HIV-1 RNA was 4.40 log10 copies/mL in blood (range, 3.20â5.08 log10 copies/mL) and 3.69 log10 copies/mL in semen (range, <2.08â4.90 log10 copies/mL). The median reduction in HIV-1 RNA by day 28 was 1.90 log10 copies/mL in blood (range, 0.56â2.68 log10 copies/mL) and 1.36 log10 copies/mL in semen (range, 0â2.66 log10 copies/mL). ART led to a decrease from baseline by day 7 in blood and day 14 in semen (pâ=â0.005 and pâ=â0.006, respectively). The initial modeled decay rate was slower in semen than in blood (pâ=â0.06). There was no difference in second-phase decay rates between blood and semen. Conclusions Efavirenz-based ART reduced HIV-1 RNA levels more slowly in semen than in blood. Although this difference was of borderline significance in this small study, our observations suggest that there is suboptimal suppression of seminal HIV-1 RNA for some men in the early weeks of treatment.

This study analyzed predictors of CSF HIV RNA and relative degree of CNS viral transmigration expressed as plasma minus CSF HIV log10 RNA (PCratio) during untreated acute HIV infection. CSF immune markers were compared between groups with different PCratio. 117 mostly male (97%) participants in the RV254 cohort in Bangkok, Thailand, had median age 28 years and an estimated median 18 days duration of infection; forty-three (37%) were Fiebig stages I/II. Twenty-seven (23%) had CSF HIV RNA <80 copies/ml. Those with quantifiable levels (n=90) had median CSF HIV RNA and PCratio of 3.76 and 2.36 Log10 copies/mL, respectively. HIV RNA peaked at Fiebig III in plasma and Fiebig IV in CSF. In multivariable analyses, plasma HIV RNA and CD4/CD8 ratio independently correlated with CSF HIV RNA (p<0.001) while CD4/CD8 ratio predicted PCratio (p=0.018). Participants with PCratio<1 had higher CSF neopterin, sCD163, IL-6 and sCD14 levels (all p<0.05). CD4/CD8 ratio independently correlated with CSF HIV RNA and PCratio, suggesting that immune responses modulate CNS viral entry at early infection.\n\nPerformance Characteristics of the QUANTIPLEX HIV-1 RNA 3.0 Assay for Detection and Quantitation of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 RNA in Plasma\n\nPubMed Central\n\nErice, Alejo; Brambilla, Donald; Bremer, James; Jackson, J. Brooks; Kokka, Robert; Yen-Lieberman, Belinda; Coombs, Robert W.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nThe QUANTIPLEX HIV-1 RNA assay, version 3.0 (a branched DNA, version 3.0, assay [bDNA 3.0 assay]), was evaluated by analyzing spiked and clinical plasma samples and was compared with the AMPLICOR HIV-1 MONITOR Ultrasensitive (ultrasensitive reverse transcription-PCR [US-RT-PCR]) method. A panel of spiked plasma samples that contained 0 to 750,000 copies of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA per ml was tested four times in each of four laboratories (1,344 assays). Negative results (<50 copies/ml) were obtained in 30 of 32 (94%) assays with seronegative samples, 66 of 128 (52%) assays with HIV-1 RNA at 50 copies/ml, and 5 of 128 (4%) assays with HIV-1 RNA at 100 copies/ml. The assay was linear from 100 to 500,000 copies/ml. The within-run standard deviation (SD) of the log10 estimated HIV-1 RNA concentration was 0.08 at 1,000 to 500,000 copies/ml, increased below 1,000 copies/ml, and was 0.17 at 100 copies/ml. Between-run reproducibility at 100 to 500 copies/ml was <0.10 log10 in most comparisons. Interlaboratory differences across runs were â¤0.10 log10 at all concentrations examined. A subset of the panel (25 to 500 copies/ml) was also analyzed by the US-RT-PCR assay. The within-run SD varied inversely with the log10 HIV-1 RNA concentration but was higher than the SD for the bDNA 3.0 assay at all concentrations. Log-log regression analysis indicated that the two methods produced very similar estimates at 100 to 500 copies/ml. In parallel testing of clinical specimens with low HIV-1 RNA levels, 80 plasma samples with <50 copies/ml by the US-RT-PCR assay had <50 copies/ml when they were retested by the bDNA 3.0 assay. In contrast, 11 of 78 (14%) plasma samples with <50 copies/ml by the bDNA 3.0 assay had â¥50 copies/ml when they were retested by the US-RT-PCR assay (median, 86 copies/ml; range, 50 to 217 copies/ml). Estimation of bDNA 3.0 values of <50 copies/ml by extending the standard curve of the assay showed that these samples with discrepant\n\nTreatment of Intestinal Helminths Does Not Reduce Plasma Concentrations of HIV-1 RNA in Coinfected Zambian Adults\n\nPubMed Central\n\nModjarrad, Kayvon; Zulu, Isaac; Redden, David T.; Njobvu, Lungowe; Lane, H. Clifford; Bentwich, Zvi; Vermund, Sten H.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nBackground Infection with intestinal helminths may stimulate dysfunctional immune responses in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)âinfected persons. Studies have yielded conflicting results regarding the impact of antihelminthic treatment on plasma concentrations of HIV-1 RNA. Methods We conducted a prospective study of 54 HIV-1â and helminth-coinfected and 57 HIV-1âinfected, helminth-uninfected asymptomatic adults living in Lusaka, Zambia, to assess the impact of antihelminthic treatment on plasma concentrations of HIV-1 RNA. Results Median baseline viral load was 0.33 log10 copies/mL lower in the helminth-infected group than in the uninfected group. Mean viral load between pretreatment and posttreatment visits increased in the helminth-infected (mean, 4.23 vs. 4.29 log10 copies/mL; P = .6) and helminth-uninfected (mean, 4.39 vs. 4.52 log10 copies/mL; P = .2) groups. Helminth-infected participants with high pretreatment viral loads had a mean 0.25-log10 copies/mL decrease after treatment (P = .3), and helminth-uninfected participants had a mean 0.02-log10 copies/mL decrease (P = .8). Conclusions We did not find an overall association between treatment of intestinal helminth infections and reduction in viral load in coinfected adults. Future studies may need to focus on adults with intense helminth infections who live in rural areas or on adults or children who harbor higher helminth burdens and plasma concentrations of HIV-1 RNA.

Our results demonstrate that of the 20 subtype A specimens, 19 were quantifiable by the bDNA assay compared with 15 by the MONITOR-1.0 and 13 by NASBA. Of those quantifiable, the mean log10 difference was 0.93 between bDNA and MONITOR-1.0 and 0.46 between bDNA and NASBA. For subtype B' specimens, the correlation among methods was better with only 2 specimens missed by NASBA and 3 by the bDNA assay. However the missed specimens had viral burden near the lower limit (1000 copies/ml) for these assays. For the 20 subtype E specimens, MONITOR-1.0 and NASBA quantified RNA in 17 and 14 specimens, respectively, as compared with 19 specimens quantified by the bDNA assay. The correlation among different assays, especially between bDNA/NASBA and MONITOR-1.0/NASBA, was poor, although the mean log10 difference for subtype E specimens was 0.4 between bDNA and MONITOR-1.0 and only 0.08 between bDNA and NASBA. The addition of a new primer set, designed for non-B HIV-1 subtypes, to the existing MONITOR assay (MONITOR-1.0+) resulted in RNA detection in all 60 specimens and significantly improved the efficiency of quantitation for subtypes A and E. Our data indicate that HIV-1 subtype variation can have a major influence on viral load quantitation by different methods. Periodic evaluation and modification of these quantitative methods may be necessary to ensure reliable quantification of divergent viruses.\n\nComparative performance of the new Aptima HIV-1 Quant Dx assay with three commercial PCR-based HIV-1 RNA quantitation assays.\n\nPubMed\n\nHopkins, Mark; Hau, Sarah; Tiernan, Caroline; Papadimitropoulos, Athanasios; Chawla, Anu; Beloukas, Apostolos; Geretti, Anna Maria\n\n2015-08-01\n\nQuantitative measurement of HIV-1 RNA levels in plasma ('viral load') plays a central role in clinical management. The choice of assay platform can influence results and treatment decisions. To compare the analytical performance of the new TMA-based Hologic Aptima(Â®) HIV-1 Quant Dx assay with that of three PCR-based assays: Abbott RealTime HIV-1, Qiagen Artus(Â®) HI Virus-1 QS-RGQ, and Roche CAP/CTM HIV-1 Test v2. Assay performance was evaluated using Acrometrix HIV-1 RNA Standard panels; the 3rd WHO HIV-1 RNA International Standard (12-500 copies/ml; 6 dilutions; 9 replicates); and plasma samples from 191 HIV-positive patients. Aptima showed high (>0.99) precision, accuracy and concordance with the Acrometrix Standards across a wide dynamic range (2.0-6.7 log10copies/ml). Variance caused up to 2.1 (Aptima), 1.7 (RealTime), 7.5 (Artus), and 1.9 (CAP/CTM) fold changes in the International Standard quantifications at 50-500 copies/ml. HIV-1 RNA detection rates in plasma samples were 141/191 (74%), 119/191 (62%), 108/191 (57%), and 145/191 (76%) for Aptima, RealTime, Artus and CAP/CTM, respectively. For categorising samples either side of 50 copies/ml, Aptima had excellent agreement with RealTime (kappa 0.92; 95% CI 0.87-0.98); lowest agreement was with Artus (kappa 0.79; 95%CI 0.70-0.88). Aptima quantifications were mean 0.12 and 0.06 log10copies/ml higher compared with RealTime and CAP/CTM, respectively, and 0.05 log10copies/ml lower compared with Artus. Limits of agreement were narrowest when comparing Aptima to RealTime. The new Aptima HIV assay is sensitive, precise, and accurate. HIV assays exhibit discordance at low HIV-1 RNA copy numbers.

We compared HIV RNA levels between MC, endocervical swab (ECS), and ECS-enriched cervicovaginal lavage (eCVL) specimens in 51 HIV-positive, antiretroviral therapy-naive women at enrollment, 3 and 6Â months, with order rotated by visit. Paired comparisons were analyzed with McNemar's exact tests, signed-rank tests, and an extension of Somer's D for pooled analyses across visits. MC specimens had the highest proportion of quantifiable HIV VL at enrollment and month 3, but more MC specimens (n=12.8%) were insufficient for testing, compared with ECS (2%, P=0.006) and eCVL (0%, P<0.001). Among sufficient specimens, median VL was significantly higher for MC (2.62 log 10 copies/mL) compared to ECS (1.30 log 10 copies/mL, P<0.001) and eCVL (1.60 log 10 copies/mL, P<0.001) across visits. MC may be more sensitive than eCVL and CVS, provided insufficient specimens are reduced. Â© 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of the real-time PCR COBAS TaqMan 48 analyser, comparing it to the existing VERSANT 3.0 (bDNA) for HIV-1 RNA quantitation in plasma of individuals infected with different HIV-1 subtypes (104 blood samples). A positive linear correlation between the two tests (r2 = 0.88) was found. Quantitation by the COBAS TaqMan assay was approximately 0.32log10 higher than by bDNA. The relationship between the two assays was similar within all subtypes with a Deming regression of <1 and <0 for the Bland-Altman plots. Overall, no significant differences were found in plasma viral load quantitation in different HIV-1 subtypes between both assays; therefore these assays are suitable for viral load quantitation of highly genetically diverse HIV-1 plasma samples.\n\nDried blood spot HIV-1 RNA quantification: A useful tool for viral load monitoring among HIV-infected individuals in India\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNeogi, Ujjwal; Gupta, Soham; Rodridges, Rashmi; Sahoo, Pravat Nalini; Rao, Shwetha D.; Rewari, Bharat B.; Shastri, Suresh; De Costa, Ayesha; Shet, Anita\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground & objectives: Monitoring of HIV-infected individuals on antiretroviral treatment (ART) ideally requires periodic viral load measurements to ascertain adequate response to treatment. While plasma viral load monitoring is widely available in high-income settings, it is rarely used in resource-limited regions because of high cost and need for sophisticated sample transport. Dried blood spot (DBS) as source specimens for viral load measurement has shown promise as an alternative to plasma specimens and is likely to be a useful tool for Indian settings. The present study was undertaken to investigate the performance of DBS in HIV-1 RNA quantification against the standard plasma viral load assay. Methods: Between April-June 2011, 130 samples were collected from HIV-1-infected (n=125) and non-infected (n=5) individuals in two district clinics in southern India. HIV-1 RNA quantification was performed from DBS and plasma using Abbott m2000rt system after manual RNA extraction. Statistical analysis included correlation, regression and Bland-Altman analysis. Results: The sensitivity of DBS viral load was 97 per cent with viral loads >3.0 log10 copies/ml. Measurable viral load (>3.0 log 10 copies/ml) results obtained for the 74 paired plasma-DBS samples showed positive correlation between both the assays (r=0.96). For clinically acceptable viral load threshold values of >5,000 copies/ml, Bland-Altman plots showed acceptable limits of agreement (â0.21 to +0.8 log10 copies/ml). The mean difference was 0.29 log10 copies/ml. The cost of DBS was $2.67 lower compared to conventional plasma viral load measurement in the setting Interpretation & conclusions: The significant positive correlation with standard plasma-based assay and lower cost of DBS viral load monitoring suggest that DBS sampling can be a feasible and economical means of viral load monitoring in HIV-infected individual in India and in other resource-limited settings globally.

We investigated potential associations between seminal plasma cytokine levels and viral concentration in the seminal plasma of HIV-1-infected men. This was a prospective, observational study of paired blood and semen samples from 18 HIV-1 chronically infected men off antiretroviral therapy. HIV-1 RNA levels and cytokine levels in seminal plasma and blood plasma were measured and analyzed using simple linear regressions to screen for associations between cytokines and seminal plasma HIV-1 levels. Forward stepwise regression was performed to construct the final multivariate model. The median HIV-1 RNA concentrations were 4.42 log10 copies/ml (IQR 2.98, 4.70) and 2.96 log10 copies/ml (IQR 2, 4.18) in blood and seminal plasma, respectively. In stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis, blood HIV-1 RNA level (p<0.0001) was most strongly associated with seminal plasma HIV-1 RNA level. After controlling for blood HIV-1 RNA level, seminal plasma HIV-1 RNA level was positively associated with interferon (IFN)-Î³ (p=0.03) and interleukin (IL)-17 (p=0.03) and negatively associated with IL-5 (p=0.0007) in seminal plasma. In addition to blood HIV-1 RNA level, cytokine profiles in the male genital tract are associated with HIV-1 RNA levels in semen. The Th1 and Th17 cytokines IFN-Î³ and IL-17 are associated with increased seminal plasma HIV-1 RNA, while the Th2 cytokine IL-5 is associated with decreased seminal plasma HIV-1 RNA. These results support the importance of genital tract immunomodulation in HIV-1 transmission.

Here, we used genetically determined ancestry (GDA) across SRR groups and examine associations between GDA and HIV-1 RNA and CD4+ counts in HIV-positive children in the US. Methods 41 AIMs, developed to distinguish 7 continental regions, were detected by real-time-PCR in 994 HIV-positive, antiretroviral naÃ¯ve children. GDA was estimated comparing each individualâs genotypes to allele frequencies found in a large set of reference individuals originating from global populations using STRUCTURE. The means of GDA were calculated for each category of SRR. Linear regression was used to model GDA on CD4+ count and log10 RNA, adjusting for SRR and age. Results Subjects were 61% Black, 25% Hispanic, 13% White and 1.3% Unknown. The mean age was 2.3 years (45% male), mean CD4+ count 981 cells/mm3, and mean log10 RNA 5.11. Marked heterogeneity was found for all SRR groups with high admixture for Hispanics. In adjusted linear regression models, subjects with 100% European ancestry were estimated to have 0.33 higher log10 RNA levels (95% CI: (0.03, 0.62), p=0.028) and 253 CD4+ cells /mm3 lower (95% CI: (â517, 11), p = 0.06) in CD4+ count, compared to subjects with 100% African ancestry. Conclusion Marked continental admixture was found among this cohort of HIV-infected children from the US. GDA contributed to differences in RNA and CD4+ counts beyond SRR, and should be considered when outcomes associated with HIV infection are likely to have a genetic component.

In adjusted linear regression models, subjects with 100% European ancestry were estimated to have 0.33 higher log10 RNA levels (95% CI: 0.03 to 0.62, P = 0.028) and 253 CD4 cells per cubic millimeter lower (95% CI: -517 to 11, P = 0.06) in CD4 count, compared to subjects with 100% African ancestry. Marked continental admixture was found among this cohort of HIV-infected children from the United States. GDA contributed to differences in RNA and CD4 counts beyond SRR and should be considered when outcomes associated with HIV infection are likely to have a genetic component.\n\nDiscordances with HIV-1 RNA quantitative determinations by three commercial assays in Pointe Noire, Republic of Congo.\n\nPubMed\n\nBruzzone, Bianca; Bisio, Francesca; Caligiuri, Patrizia; Mboungou, Franc A Mayinda; Nigro, Nicola; Sticchi, Laura; Ventura, Agostina; Saladini, Francesco; Zazzi, Maurizio; Icardi, Giancarlo; Viscoli, Claudio\n\n2014-07-01\n\nAccurate HIV-1 RNA quantitation is required to support the scale up of antiretroviral therapy in African countries. Extreme HIV-1 genetic variability in Africa may affect the ability of commercially available assays to detect and quantify HIV-1 RNA accurately. The aim of this study was to compare three real-time PCR assays for quantitation of plasma HIV-1 RNA levels in patients from the Republic of Congo, an area with highly diversified HIV-1 subtypes and recombinants. The Abbott RealTime HIV-1, BioMÃ©rieux HIV-1 EasyQ test 1.2 and Cobas AmpliPrep/Cobas TaqMan HIV-1 1.0 were compared for quantitation of HIV-1 RNA in 37 HIV-1 seropositive pregnant women enrolled in the Kento-Mwana project for prevention of mother-to-child transmission in Pointe-Noire, Republic of Congo. The sample panel included a variety of HIV-1 subtypes with as many as 21 (56.8%) putative unique recombinant forms. Qualitative detection of HIV-1 RNA was concordant by all three assays in 33/37 (89.2%) samples. Of the remaining 4 (10.8%) samples, all were positive by Roche, three by Abbott and none by BioMÃ©rieux. Differences exceeding 1Log in positive samples were found in 4/31 (12.9%), 10/31 (32.3%) and 5/31 (16.1%) cases between Abbott and BioMÃ©rieux, Roche and BioMÃ©rieux, and Abbott and Roche, respectively. In this sample panel representative of highly polymorphic HIV-1 in Congo, the agreement among the three assays was moderate in terms of HIV-1 RNA detectability and rather inconsistent in terms of quantitation.

The clinical significance of these viral blips is uncertain. We have determined the incidence of blips and investigated important associations in the Swedish HIV-cohort. HIV-1-infected ART naÃ¯ve adults who commenced ART 2007-2013 were retrospectively included. Viral blips were defined as a transient viral load between 50 and 500 copies/mL Subjects not suppressed after six months on ART were excluded. Viral blips were found in 76/735 included subjects (10.3Â %) and in 90/4449 samples (2.0Â %). Median blip viral load was 76 copies/mL (range 56-138). Median follow-up time was 170Â weeks (range 97-240). Baseline viral load was higher in subjects with viral blips (median log10 4.85 copies/mL) compared with subjects without blips (median log10 4.55 copies/mL) (pâ<â0.01). There was a significant association between viral blips and risk for subsequent virological failure (pâ<â0.001). The Swedish national HIV-cohort has a low incidence of viral blips (10Â %). Blips were associated with high baseline viral load and an increased risk of subsequent virological failure.\n\nUsing RT-PCR and bDNA assays to measure non-clade B HIV-1 subtype RNA.\n\nPubMed\n\nPasquier, C; Sandres, K; Salama, G; Puel, J; Izopet, J\n\n1999-08-01\n\nThe performance of the new version of RT-PCR assay (Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor v1.5) was assessed. The quantification of non-B subtype HIV-1 plasma RNA (30A, 1C, 1D, 3E, 2F, 3G) obtained using Monitor v1.5 was compared to the former version of this assay (Monitor v1.0) and to the Quantiplex v2.0 bDNA assay. The new primers used in Monitor v1.5 were similar to the former version in both specificity and sensitivity. The new primers corrected the detection and quantification defect observed previously for HIV-1 non-B subtypes and gave slightly higher RNA concentrations than those measured using the bDNA assay (+0.39 log copies/ml).\n\nAssociation Between HIV-1 RNA Level and CD4 Cell Count Among Untreated HIV-Infected Individuals\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLima, Viviane D.; Fink, Valeria; Yip, Benita; Hogg, Robert S.; Harrigan, P. Richard\n\n2009-01-01\n\nObjectives. We examined the significance of plasma HIV-1 RNA levels (or viral load alone) in predicting CD4 cell decline in untreated HIV-infected individuals. Methods. Data were obtained from the British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS. Participants included all residents who ever had a viral load determination in the province and who had never taken antiretroviral drugs (N = 890). We analyzed a total of 2074 viral load measurements and 2332 CD4 cell counts. Linear mixed-effects models were used to predict CD4 cell decline over time. Results. Longitudinal viral load was strongly associated with CD4 cell decline over time; an average of 1 log10 increase in viral load was associated with a 55-cell/mm3 decrease in CD4 cell count. Conclusions. Our results support the combined use of CD4 cell count and viral load as prognostic markers in HIV-infected individuals before the introduction of antiretroviral therapy.

Elaine\n\n2001-01-01\n\nNormal assay variation associated with bDNA tests for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA performed at two laboratories with different levels of test experience was investigated. Two 5-ml aliquots of blood in EDTA tubes were collected from each patient for whom the HIV-1 bDNA test was ordered. Blood was stored for no more than 4 h at room temperature prior to plasma separation. Plasma was stored at â70Â°C until transported to the Central Pennsylvania Alliance Laboratory (CPAL; York, Pa.) and to the Hershey Medical Center (Hershey, Pa.) on dry ice. Samples were stored at â¤â70Â°C at both laboratories prior to testing. Pools of negative (donor), low-HIV-1-RNA-positive, and high-HIV-1-RNA-positive plasma samples were also repeatedly tested at CPAL to determine both intra- and interrun variation. From 11 August 1999 until 14 September 2000, 448 patient specimens were analyzed in parallel at CPAL and Hershey. From 206 samples with results of â¥1,000 copies/ml at CPAL, 148 (72%) of the results varied by â¤0.20 log10 when tested at Hershey and none varied by >0.50 log10. However, of 242 specimens with results of <1,000 copies/ml at CPAL, 11 (5%) of the results varied by >0.50 log10 when tested at Hershey. Of 38 aliquots of HIV-1 RNA pool negative samples included in 13 CPAL bDNA runs, 37 (97%) gave results of <50 copies/ml and 1 (3%) gave a result of 114 copies/ml. Low-positive HIV-1 RNA pool intrarun variation ranged from 0.06 to 0.26 log10 while the maximum interrun variation was 0.52 log10. High-positive HIV-1 RNA pool intrarun variation ranged from 0.04 to 0.32 log10, while the maximum interrun variation was 0.55 log10.

This study evaluates the performance of three commercial viral load assays-Versant HIV-1 RNA bDNA v3.0, Cobas AmpliPrep/Cobas TaqMan HIV-1, and NucliSens HIV-1 EasyQ v1.2-in testing 83 plasma specimens from patients carrying HIV-1 non-B subtypes and recombinants previously defined by phylogenetic analysis of the pol gene. All 28 specimens from patients under treatment presented viremia values below the detection limit with the three methods. In the remaining 55 specimens from naive individuals viremia could not be detected in 32.7, 20, and 14.6% using the NucliSens, Versant, or TaqMan tests, respectively, suggesting potential viral load underestimation of some samples by all techniques. Only 32 (58.2%) samples from naive subjects were quantified by the three methods; the NucliSens test provided the highest HIV RNA values (mean, 4.87 log copies/ml), and the Versant test provided the lowest (mean, 4.16 log copies/ml). Viremia differences of greater than 1 log were seen in 8 (14.5%) of 55 specimens, occurring in 10.9, 7.3, and 5.4%, respectively, of the specimens in comparisons of Versant versus NucliSens, Versant versus TaqMan, and TaqMan versus NucliSens. Differences greater than 0.5 log, considered significant for clinicians, occurred in 45.5, 27.3, and 29% when the same assays were compared. Some HIV-1 strains, such as subtype G and CRF02_AG, showed more discrepancies in distinct quantification methods than others. In summary, an adequate design of primers and probes is needed for optimal quantitation of plasma HIV-RNA in non-B subtypes. Our data emphasize the need to use the same method for monitoring patients on therapy and also the convenience of HIV-1 subtyping.\n\nEffects of Anticoagulant, Processing Delay, and Assay Method (Branched DNA versus Reverse Transcriptase PCR) on Measurement of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 RNA Levels in Plasma\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKirstein, Lynn M.; Mellors, John W.; Rinaldo, Charles R.; Margolick, Joseph B.; Giorgi, Janis V.; Phair, John P.; Dietz, Edith; Gupta, Phalguni; Sherlock, Christopher H.; Hogg, Robert; Montaner, J.

G.; MuÃ±oz, Alvaro\n\n1999-01-01\n\nWe conducted two studies to determine the potential influence of delays in blood processing, type of anticoagulant, and assay method on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA levels in plasma. The first was an experimental study in which heparin- and EDTA-anticoagulated blood samples were collected from 101 HIV-positive individuals and processed to plasma after delays of 2, 6, and 18 h. HIV-1 RNA levels in each sample were then measured by both branched-DNA (bDNA) and reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assays. Compared to samples processed within 2 h, the loss (decay) of HIV-1 RNA in heparinized blood was significant (P < 0.05) but small after 6 h (bDNA assay, â0.12 log10 copies/ml; RT-PCR, â0.05 log10 copies/ml) and after 18 h (bDNA assay, â0.27 log10 copies/ml; RT-PCR, â0.15 log10 copies/ml). Decay in EDTA-anticoagulated blood was not significant after 6 h (bDNA assay, â0.002 log10 copies/ml; RT-PCR, â0.02 log10 copies/ml), but it was after 18 h (bDNA assay, â0.09 log10 copies/ml; RT-PCR, â0.09 log10 copies/ml). Only 4% of samples processed after 6 h lost more than 50% (â¥0.3 log10 copies/ml) of the HIV-1 RNA, regardless of the anticoagulant or the assay that was used. The second study compared HIV-1 RNA levels in samples from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS; samples were collected in heparin-containing tubes in 1985, had a 6-h average processing delay, and were assayed by bDNA assay) and the British Columbia Drug Treatment Program (BCDTP) (collected in EDTA- or acid citrate dextrose-containing tubes in 1996 and 1997, had a 2-h maximum processing delay, and were assayed by RT-PCR). HIV-1 RNA levels in samples from the two cohorts were not significantly different after adjusting for CD4+-cell count and converting bDNA assay values to those corresponding to the RT-PCR results. In summary, the decay of HIV-1 RNA measured in heparinized blood after 6 h was small (â0.05 to â0.12 log10 copies/ml), and the minor impact of this decay\n\nEffects of anticoagulant, processing delay, and assay method (branched DNA versus reverse transcriptase PCR) on measurement of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RNA levels in plasma.\n\nPubMed\n\nKirstein, L M; Mellors, J W; Rinaldo, C R; Margolick, J B; Giorgi, J V; Phair, J P; Dietz, E; Gupta, P; Sherlock, C H; Hogg, R; Montaner, J S; MuÃ±oz, A\n\n1999-08-01\n\nWe conducted two studies to determine the potential influence of delays in blood processing, type of anticoagulant, and assay method on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA levels in plasma.

The analytical performance of this new assay was compared to the FDA-approved Abbott RealTime HIV-1 (RealTime). The evaluation was performed using 220 clinical plasma samples, the WHO 3rd HIV-1 International Standard, and the QCMD HIV-1 RNA EQA. Concordance on qualitative results, correlation between quantitative results, accuracy, and reproducibility of viral load data were analyzed. The ability to measure HIV-1 subtypes was assessed on the second WHO International Reference Preparation Panel for HIV-1 Subtypes. With clinical samples, inter-assay agreement for qualitative results was high (91.8%) with Cohen's kappa statistic equal to 0.836. For samples with quantitative results in both assays (nâ=â93), Lin's concordance correlation coefficient was 0.980 (Pâ<â0.0001) and mean differences of measurement, conducted according to Bland-Altman method, was low (0.115âlog10 âcopies/ml). The Aptima HIV quantified the WHO 3rd HIV-1 International Standard diluted from 2000 to 31âcp/ml (5,700-88âIU/ml) at expected values with excellent linearity (R(2) â>â0.970) and showed higher sensitivity compared to RealTime being able to detect HIV-1 RNA in 10 out of 10 replicates containing down to 7âcp/ml (20âIU/ml). Reproducibility was very high, even at low HIV-1 RNA values. The Aptima HIV was able to detect and accurately quantify all the main HIV-1 subtypes in both reference panels and clinical samples. Besides excellent performance, Aptima HIV shows full automation, ease of use, and improved workflow compared to RealTime. J. Med. Virol. 88:1535-1544, 2016. Â© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Among these, individuals presenting with neurologic symptoms during follow-up were assessed for CSF/Plasma HIV-1 RNA discordance by measuring HIV-1 RNA in collected plasma and CSF samples. CSF/plasma HIV-1 RNA discordance was defined as either detectable CSF HIV-1 RNA (VLâ>â20âcopies/mL) with an undetectable plasma RNA (complete viral suppression, VL â¤20âcopies/mL) or CSF HIV-1 RNAââ¥â0.5 log10 higher than plasma RNA when plasma VL was between 20 and 1000âcopies/mL (low-level viremia, LLV).Out of 1584 virologically suppressed patients, 71 (4.4%) presented with incident neurologic symptoms. Twenty out of 71 (28.2%) patients were diagnosed with CSF/Plasma HIV-1 discordance. Median plasma and CSF VL in patients with discordance was 120 [interquartile range (IQR): <20 to 332.5] and 4250 (IQR: 2550.0- 9615.0) copies/mL, respectively. All 9 individuals in which CSF HIV-1 genotypic resistance testing was done showed mutations that would compromise efficacy of prescribed ART regimen. Prevalence of CSF/plasma HIV-1 RNA discordance was higher among neurologically symptomatic patients with plasma LLV as compared with those with complete viral suppression (70% vs 11.8%, Pâ<â.001). The risk of discordance was also greater in patients who received protease inhibitor (PI) containing ART (Pâ<â.001) and those on ART regimens with central nervous system (CNS) penetration effectiveness (CPE) value <6 (Pâ=â.006).CSF/plasma HIV-1 RNA discordance indicates replication of HIV-1 that has adapted to the CNS or has\n\nCerebrospinal fluid interferon-gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP-10, CXCL10) in HIV-1 infection.\n\nPubMed\n\nCinque, Paola; Bestetti, Arabella; Marenzi, Roberta; Sala, Serena; Gisslen, Magnus; Hagberg, Lars; Price, Richard W\n\n2005-11-01\n\nInterferon-gamma-inducible protein (IP-10 or CXCL10) is a potent chemoattractant and has been suggested to enhance retrovirus infection and mediate neuronal injury. In order to assess this chemokine in central nervous system (CNS) HIV infection, we measured the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma concentrations of CXCL10 by immunoassay in samples derived from 97 HIV-infected subjects across a spectrum of immunological progression and CNS complications and from 16 HIV seronegative control subjects studied at three clinical centers between 1994 and 2001. We also examined changes in the CSF and plasma CXCL10 concentrations in 30 subjects starting and three stopping antiretroviral therapy. CSF CXCL10 concentrations: (1) correlated with CSF HIV RNA and white blood cell (WBC) counts, but not with blood CXCL10, HIV RNA, or CD4 counts; (2) were increased in subjects with primary and asymptomatic HIV infections and AIDS dementia complex, but less frequently in those with more advanced infection, with or without CNS opportunistic diseases except cytomegalovirus encephalitis; (3) decreased in subjects starting antiretroviral in association with decreases in CSF and plasma HIV RNA and CSF WBCs; and (4) conversely, increased in subjects stopping treatment in parallel with CSF HIV RNA and WBCs. These results confirm that CSF CXCL10 associates closely with both CSF HIV and WBCs and suggest that this chemokine may be both a response to and contributing determinant of local infection. High CSF levels may be useful in the diagnosis of ADC in subjects with advanced immunosuppression in whom CMV encephalitis has been ruled out, though this issue requires further study.\n\nHIV-1-RNA in seminal plasma correlates with detection of HIV-1-DNA in semen cells, but not with CMV shedding, among MSM on successful antiretroviral regimens.\n\nPubMed\n\nGantner, Pierre; Assoumou, Lambert; Leruez-Ville, Marianne; David, Ludivine; Suzan-Monti, Marie; Costagliola, Dominique; Rouzioux, Christine; Ghosn, Jade\n\n2016-11-01\n\nIntermittent seminal HIV-RNA detection can occur in MSM despite concomitant plasma virological control on combined ART (cART). We undertook the present study to determine if seminal HIV detection was associated with seminal cytomegalovirus (CMV) detection or detection of HIV-infected cells in semen. Longitudinal semen samples from HIV-1-infected MSM on successful cART enrolled in the EVARIST ANRS EP 49 study were analysed. We first conducted a case-control analysis (ratio 1â:â3) to assess HIV-DNA detection in semen cells in the 20 patients with detectable HIV-RNA in seminal plasma (cases) matched with 60 participants with undetectable HIV-RNA (controls) based on total HIV-DNA load in blood cells. Second, we measured CMV-DNA in all seminal plasma samples. HIV-1-DNA in semen cells was detected on at least one sample visit in 12/20 cases and 11/60 controls. Detection of HIV-RNA in seminal plasma was associated significantly with the detection of HIV-DNA in semen cells [OR, 7.6 (95% CI, 2.1-28.4); Pâ=â0.002] when adjusted on total HIV-DNA in blood cells. CMV-DNA was detected in 107/273 seminal plasma samples with a median value of 3.62 log 10 copies/mL (IQR, 2.83-4.38), yielding a prevalence of 39.2%. Seminal CMV-DNA shedding [OR, 1.5 (95% CI, 0.6-3.6); Pâ=â0.343] was not associated with the risk of detection of HIV-RNA in seminal plasma. The presence of HIV-DNA in semen cells was predictive of HIV-RNA detection, suggesting that viral particles arise through local HIV replication by infected semen cells. Despite virological control, compartmentalization of HIV in the genital tract might act in residual replication and transmission. Â© The Author 2016.

The absolute RNA values of tested specimens differed significantly between bDNA 2.0 and bDNA 3.0 or Monitor v1.5 measurements (Wilcoxon signed-rank test P<0.001). Results generated with bDNA 3.0 or with Monitor v1.5 were approximately twofold greater than those generated with bDNA 2.0, with smaller differences at higher HIV-1 RNA levels and greater differences at RNA levels below 1000 copies per ml. Although highly correlated (r=0.92 and 0.86, respectively), viral load data generated with bDNA 2.0 and either bDNA 3.0 or Monitor v1.5 were in poor agreement. Concordant results (difference in log(10) copies per ml <0.5) were found at frequencies of 80% for bDNA 2.0 and bDNA 3.0 and only at 58.5% for bDNA 2.0 and Monitor v1.5. In contrast, bDNA 3.0 and Monitor v1.5 measurements were highly correlated (r=0.96) and in good agreement (92.7%).\n\nIntegrase inhibitors in late pregnancy and rapid HIV viral load reduction.\n\nPubMed\n\nRahangdale, Lisa; Cates, Jordan; Potter, JoNell; Badell, Martina L; Seidman, Dominika; Miller, Emilly S; Coleman, Jenell S; Lazenby, Gweneth B; Levison, Judy; Short, William R; Yawetz, Sigal; Ciaranello, Andrea; Livingston, Elizabeth; Duthely, Lunthita; Rimawi, Bassam H; Anderson, Jean R; Stringer, Elizabeth M\n\n2016-03-01\n\nMinimizing time to HIV viral suppression is critical in pregnancy. Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs), like raltegravir, are known to rapidly suppress plasma HIV RNA in nonpregnant adults. There are limited data in pregnant women. We describe time to clinically relevant reduction in HIV RNA in pregnant women using INSTI-containing and non-INSTI-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART) options. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of pregnant HIV-infected women in the United States from 2009 through 2015. We included women who initiated ART, intensified their regimen, or switched to a new regimen due to detectable viremia (HIV RNA >40 copies/mL) at â¥20 weeks gestation. Among women with a baseline HIV RNA permitting 1-log reduction, we estimated time to 1-log RNA reduction using the Kaplan-Meier estimator comparing women starting/adding an INSTI in their regimen vs other ART. To compare groups with similar follow-up time, we also conducted a subgroup analysis limited to women with â¤14 days between baseline and follow-up RNA data. This study describes 101 HIV-infected pregnant women from 11 US clinics. In all, 75% (76/101) of women were not taking ART at baseline; 24 were taking non-INSTI containing ART, and 1 received zidovudine monotherapy. In all, 39% (39/101) of women started an INSTI-containing regimen or added an INSTI to their ART regimen. Among 90 women with a baseline HIV RNA permitting 1-log reduction, the median time to 1-log RNA reduction was 8 days (interquartile range [IQR], 7-14) in the INSTI group vs 35 days (IQR, 20-53) in the non-INSTI ART group (P < .01). In a subgroup of 39 women with first and last RNA measurements â¤14 days apart, median time to 1-log reduction was 7 days (IQR, 6-10) in the INSTI group vs 11 days (IQR, 10-14) in the non-INSTI group (P < .01). ART that includes INSTIs appears to induce more rapid viral suppression than other ART regimens in pregnancy. Inclusion of an INSTI may play a role in optimal reduction\n\nScreening Yield of HIV Antigen/Antibody Combination and Pooled HIV RNA Testing for Acute HIV Infection in a High-Prevalence Population.\n\nPubMed\n\nPeters, Philip J; Westheimer, Emily; Cohen, Stephanie; Hightow-Weidman, Lisa B; Moss, Nicholas; Tsoi, Benjamin; Hall, Laura; Fann, Charles; Daskalakis, Demetre C; Beagle, Steve; Patel, Pragna; Radix, Asa; Foust, Evelyn; Kohn, Robert P; Marmorino, Jenni; Pandori, Mark; Fu, Jie; Samandari, Taraz; Gay, Cynthia L\n\n2016-02-16\n\nincreased the relative HIV diagnostic yield (both established and acute HIV infections) by 10.4% (95% CI, 8.8%-12.2%) and pooled HIV RNA testing increased the relative HIV diagnostic yield by 12.4% (95% CI, 10.7%-14.3%). In a high-prevalence population, HIV screening using an HIV Ag/Ab combination assay following a negative rapid test detected 82% of acute HIV infections detectable by pooled HIV RNA testing, with a positive predictive value of 59%. Further research is needed to evaluate this strategy in lower-prevalence populations and in persons using preexposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention.\n\nValidation of dilution of plasma samples with phosphate buffered saline to eliminate the problem of small volumes associated with children infected with HIV-1 for viral load testing using Cobas AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 test, version 2.0 (CAP CTM HIV v2.0).\n\nPubMed\n\nMine, Madisa; Nkoane, Tapologo; Sebetso, Gaseene; Sakyi, Bright; Makhaola, Kgomotso; Gaolathe, Tendani\n\n2013-12-01\n\nThe sample requirement of 1 mL for the Roche COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 test, version 2.0 (CAP CTM HIV v2.0) limits its utility in measuring plasma HIV-1 RNA levels for small volume samples from children infected with HIV-1. Viral load monitoring is the standard of care for HIV-1-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy in Botswana. The study aimed to validate the dilution of small volume samples with phosphate buffered saline (1Ã PBS) when quantifying HIV-1 RNA in patient plasma. HIV RNA concentrations were determined in undiluted and diluted pairs of samples comprising panels of quality assessment standards (n=52) as well as patient samples (n=325). There was strong correlation (R(2)) of 0.98 and 0.95 within the dynamic range of the CAP CTM HIV v2.0 test between undiluted and diluted samples from quality assessment standards and patients, respectively. The difference between viral load measurements of diluted and undiluted pairs of quality assessment standards and patient samples using the Altman-Bland test showed that the 95% limits of agreement were between -0.40 Log 10 and 0.49 Log 10. This difference was within the 0.5 Log 10 which is generally considered as normal assay variation of plasma RNA levels. Dilution of samples with 1Ã PBS produced comparable viral load measurements to undiluted samples. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We assessed the frequency, magnitude, and correlates of seminal HIV-1 RNA shedding in HIV-1-infected African men initiating ART. Seminal HIV-1 RNA was detected in 24% (37 of 155), 10% (5 of 49), and 11% (8 of 70) of samples collected 0-3, 4-6, and >6 months after ART initiation. When blood HIV-1 levels were suppressed, seminal HIV-1 RNA was detected in 8% (16 of 195), and 82% (13 of 16) had an HIV-1 RNA load of < 1000 copies/mL. Seminal HIV-1 RNA shedding was infrequent and present at low levels in HIV-1-infected African men with suppressed blood HIV-1 RNA. Â© The Author 2016.

Few studies have reported amounts of HIV RNA and HIV DNA in semen in HIV-infected Chinese patients undergoing antiviral treatment (ART). In this observational study, the amounts of HIV RNA and HIV DNA in semen were assessed after six months of ART in HIV-infected Chinese individuals, when HIV RNA was undetectable in blood . This study included 19 HIV-infected Chinese men undergoing ART for six months. Amounts of HIV in paired semen and blood samples were assessed using real-time PCR. The C2-V5 region of the HIV envelope (env) genes was cloned and sequenced and genotype and co-receptor usage predicted based on the sequence. It was found that HIV RNA was undetectable in the plasma of most patients (17/19), whereas HIV RNA could be detected in the semen of most patients (16/19). HIV DNA could be detected in both semen and blood. Genetic diversity of HIV between the seminal and blood compartments was identified. Thus, amounts of HIV RNA and HIV DNA remain high in semen of HIV-infected Chinese patients after six months of ART treatment, even when HIV RNA was undetectable in blood.

Gregory; Jiang, Min Kang; Shah, Akram S.; Metcalf, Julia A.; Lane, H. Clifford; Dewar, Robin L.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nThis study evaluated correlation and agreement between version 3 of the Quantiplex human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA assay (v3 branched DNA [bDNA]) and a sensitized Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor assay (reverse transcription [RT]-PCR) for the measurement of HIV RNA. Three hundred eighteen samples from 59 randomly selected, HIV-1-seropositive persons on various drug protocols from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases HIV outpatient clinic were studied. The results indicate that v3 bDNA and RT-PCR are highly correlated (r = 0.98) and are in good agreement (mean difference in log10 copies/ml Â± 2 standard deviations = 0.072 Â± 0.371). The relationship between values obtained by both assays is given by the following equation: log10v3 bDNA = â0.0915 + 1.0052 Â· log10RT-PCR. This represents a 1.026-fold difference between log10RT-PCR values and log10v3 bDNA values.

Four groups of HIV seropositive adult female barworkers were identified and examined at three-monthly intervals between October 2000 and March 2003 in Mbeya, Tanzania: (1) 57 women at 70 clinic visits with clinical genital herpes; (2) 39 of the same women at 46 clinic visits when asymptomatic; (3) 55 HSV-2 seropositive women at 60 clinic visits who were never observed with herpetic lesions; (4) 18 HSV-2 seronegative women at 45 clinic visits. Associations of genital HIV shedding with HIV plasma viral load (PVL), herpetic lesions, HSV shedding and other factors were examined. Prevalence of detectable genital HIV RNA varied from 73% in HSV-2 seronegative women to 94% in women with herpetic lesions (geometric means 1634 vs 3339 copies/ml, pâ=â0.03). In paired specimens from HSV-2 positive women, genital HIV viral shedding was similar during symptomatic and asymptomatic visits. On multivariate regression, genital HIV RNA (log10 copies/mL) was closely associated with HIV PVL (Î²â=â0.51 per log10 copies/ml increase, 95%CI:0.41-0.60, p<0.001) and HSV shedding (Î²â=â0.24 per log10 copies/ml increase, 95% CI:0.16-0.32, p<0.001) but not the presence of herpetic lesions (Î²â=â-0.10, 95%CI:-0.28-0.08, pâ=â0.27). HIV PVL and HSV shedding were more important determinants of genital HIV than the presence of herpetic lesions. These data support a role of HSV-2 infection in enhancing HIV transmissibility.\n\nAntiviral activity, safety, and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of dolutegravir as 10-day monotherapy in HIV-1-infected adults.\n\nPubMed\n\nMin, Sherene; Sloan, Louis; DeJesus, Edwin; Hawkins, Trevor; McCurdy, Lewis; Song, Ivy; Stroder, Richard; Chen, Shuguang; Underwood, Mark; Fujiwara, Tamio; Piscitelli, Stephen; Lalezari, Jay\n\n2011-09-10\n\nTo evaluate the antiviral activity, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of dolutegravir (DTG), a next-generation HIV integrase inhibitor (INI), as short-term monotherapy. A phase IIa, randomized, double-blind, dose-ranging study. In this study, INI-naive, HIV-1-infected adults currently off antiretroviral therapy were randomized to receive DTG (2, 10, or 50 mg) or placebo once daily for 10 days in an eight active and two placebo randomization scheme per DTG dose. Placebo patients were pooled for the purpose of analysis. Thirty-five patients (n = 9 for DTG 2 and 10 mg, n = 10 for DTG 50 mg, and n = 7 for placebo) were enrolled. Baseline characteristics were similar across dose groups. Significant reductions in plasma HIV-1 RNA from baseline to day 11 were observed for all DTG dose groups compared with placebo (P < 0.001), with a mean decrease of 1.51-2.46 log(10) copies/ml. In addition, a well characterized dose-response relationship was observed for viral load decrease. Most patients (seven of 10, 70%) receiving DTG 50 mg achieved plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/ml. The pharmacokinetic variability was low (coefficient of variation, range 25-50%). Plasma HIV-1 RNA reduction was best predicted by CÏ using an E(max) model. The most common adverse events were diarrhea, fatigue, and headache; the majority of adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. Dolutegravir demonstrated potent antiviral activity, good short-term tolerability, low pharmacokinetic variability, and a predictable pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics relationship, which support once-daily dosing without a pharmacokinetic booster in integrase-naive patients in future studies.\n\nN6-methyladenosine of HIV-1 RNA regulates viral infection and HIV-1 Gag protein expression\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTirumuru, Nagaraja; Zhao, Boxuan Simen; Lu, Wuxun; Lu, Zhike; He, Chuan; Wu, Li\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe internal N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation of eukaryotic nuclear RNA controls post-transcriptional gene expression, which is regulated by methyltransferases (writers), demethylases (erasers), and m6A-binding proteins (readers) in cells. The YTH domain family proteins (YTHDF1â3) bind to m6A-modified cellular RNAs and affect RNA metabolism and processing. Here, we show that YTHDF1â3 proteins recognize m6A-modified HIV-1 RNA and inhibit HIV-1 infection in cell lines and primary CD4+ T-cells. We further mapped the YTHDF1â3 binding sites in HIV-1 RNA from infected cells. We found that the overexpression of YTHDF proteins in cells inhibited HIV-1 infection mainly by decreasing HIV-1 reverse transcription, while knockdown of YTHDF1â3 in cells had the opposite effects. Moreover, silencing the m6A writers decreased HIV-1 Gag protein expression in virus-producing cells, while silencing the m6A erasers increased Gag expression. Our findings suggest an important role of m6A modification of HIV-1 RNA in viral infection and HIV-1 protein synthesis.

We examined the frequency and magnitude of persistent low-level HIV-1 RNA in CSF and its relation to the central nervous system (CNS) immune activation. Methods CSF and plasma HIV-1 RNA were measured using the single-copy assay with a detection limit of 0.3 copies/ml in 70 CSF and 68 plasma samples from 45 treated HIV-1-infected patients with less than 40 copies/ml of HIV-1 RNA in both fluids by standard clinical assays. We also measured CSF neopterin to assess intrathecal immune activation. Theoretical drug exposure was estimated using the CNS penetration-efficacy score of treatment regimens. Results CSF HIV-1 RNA was detected in 12 of the 70 CSF samples (17%) taken after up to 10 years of suppressive therapy, compared to 39 of the 68 plasma samples (57%) with a median concentration of less than 0.3 copies/ml in CSF compared to 0.3 copies/ml in plasma (P <0.0001). CSF samples with detectable HIV-1 RNA had higher CSF neopterin levels (mean 8.2 compared to 5.7 nmol/l; P =0.0085). Patients with detectable HIV-1 RNA in CSF did not differ in pretreatment plasma HIV-1 RNA levels, nadir CD4+ cell count or CNS penetration-efficacy score. Conclusion Low-level CSF HIV-1 RNA and its association with elevated CSF neopterin highlight the potential for the CNS to serve as a viral reservoir and for persistent infection to cause subclinical CNS injury.

A5353 is a phase 2, single-arm, pilot study of once-daily dolutegravir (50 mg) plus lamivudine (300 mg) in treatment-naive participants with HIV-1 RNA â¥1000 and <500000 copies/mL. Exclusion criteria included active hepatitis B or major protease, reverse transcriptase, or integrase resistance. The primary efficacy measure was the proportion with HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL (FDA [US Food and Drug Administration] Snapshot) at week 24. Virologic failure (VF) was confirmed HIV-1 RNA >400 copies/mL at week 16/20 or >200 copies/mL at or after week 24. Dolutegravir levels and drug resistance testing were performed at VF. One hundred and twenty participants (87% male, median age 30 years, 37 (31%) HIV-1 RNA >100000 copies/mL) initiated study treatment. Median entry HIV-1 RNA and CD4 count were 4.61 log10 copies/mL and 387 cells/mm3. Virologic efficacy at week 24 was 108/120 (90%, confidence interval [83%, 95%]), with comparable results in the >100000 copies/mL and â¤100000 copies/mL strata, that is, 89% (75%, 97%) and 90% (82%, 96%), respectively. Three participants with VF, had undetected plasma dolutegravir at â¥1 time points; the M184V and R263R/K mutations developed in 1 participant. Two participants experienced grade 3 possible/probable treatment-related adverse events; none discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Dolutegravir plus lamivudine demonstrated efficacy in individuals with pretreatment HIV-1 RNA up to 500000 copies/mL in this pilot trial, but a participant developed resistance mutations.

Methods In this study, the Abbott RealTime HIV-1 (Abbott RealTime) assay was compared to the Roche Cobas TaqMan HIV-1 (Cobas TaqMan) and the Siemens Versant HIV-1 RNA 3.0 (bDNA 3.0) assays, using clinical samples of various viral load levels and subtypes from Greece, where the recent epidemiology of HIV-1 infection has been characterized by increasing genetic diversity and a marked increase in subtype A genetic strains among newly diagnosed infections. Results A high correlation was observed between the quantitative results obtained by the Abbott RealTime and the Cobas TaqMan assays. Viral load values quantified by the Abbott RealTime were on average lower than those obtained by the Cobas TaqMan, with a mean (SD) difference of -0.206 (0.298) log10 copies/ml. The mean differences according to HIV-1 subtypes between the two techniques for samples of subtype A, B, and non-A/non-B were 0.089, -0.262, and -0.298 log10 copies/ml, respectively. Overall, differences were less than 0.5 log10 for 85% of the samples, and >1 log10 in only one subtype B sample. Similarly, Abbott RealTime and bDNA 3.0 assays yielded a very good correlation of quantitative results, whereas viral load values assessed by the Abbott RealTime were on average higher (mean (SD) difference: 0.160 (0.287) log10 copies/ml). The mean differences according to HIV-1 subtypes between the two techniques for subtype A, B and non-A/non-B samples were 0.438, 0.105 and 0.191 log10 copies/ml, respectively. Overall, the majority of samples (86%) differed by less than 0.5 log10, while none of the samples showed a deviation of more than 1.0 log10. Conclusions In an area of changing HIV-1 subtype pattern, the Abbott RealTime assay showed a high correlation and good agreement of results when compared both to the Cobas TaqMan and bDNA 3.0 assays, for all\n\nUse of multiple competitors for quantification of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RNA in plasma.\n\nPubMed\n\nVener, T; Nygren, M; Andersson, A; UhlÃ©n, M; Albert, J; Lundeberg, J\n\n1998-07-01\n\nQuantification of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA in plasma has rapidly become an important tool in basic HIV research and in the clinical care of infected individuals. Here, a quantitative HIV assay based on competitive reverse transcription-PCR with multiple competitors was developed. Four RNA competitors containing identical PCR primer binding sequences as the viral HIV-1 RNA target were constructed. One of the PCR primers was fluorescently labeled, which facilitated discrimination between the viral RNA and competitor amplicons by fragment analysis with conventional automated sequencers. The coamplification of known amounts of the RNA competitors provided the means to establish internal calibration curves for the individual reactions resulting in exclusion of tube-to-tube variations. Calibration curves were created from the peak areas, which were proportional to the starting amount of each competitor. The fluorescence detection format was expanded to provide a dynamic range of more than 5 log units. This quantitative assay allowed for reproducible analysis of samples containing as few as 40 viral copies of HIV-1 RNA per reaction. The within- and between-run coefficients of variation were <24% (range, 10 to 24) and <36% (range, 27 to 36), respectively. The high reproducibility (standard deviation, <0.13 log) of the overall procedure for quantification of HIV-1 RNA in plasma, including sample preparation, amplification, and detection variations, allowed reliable detection of a 0.5-log change in RNA viral load. The assay could be a useful tool for monitoring HIV-1 disease progression and antiviral treatment and can easily be adapted to the quantification of other pathogens.\n\nEffect of Genital Herpes on Cervicovaginal HIV Shedding in Women Co-Infected with HIV AND HSV-2 in Tanzania\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTodd, Jim; Riedner, Gabriele; Maboko, Leonard; Hoelscher, Michael; Weiss, Helen A.; Lyamuya, Eligius; Mabey, David; Rusizoka, Mary; Belec, Laurent; Hayes, Richard\n\n2013-01-01\n\nObjectives To compare the presence and quantity of cervicovaginal HIV among HIV seropositive women with clinical herpes, subclinical HSV-2 infection and without HSV-2 infection respectively; to evaluate the association between cervicovaginal HIV and HSV shedding; and identify factors associated with quantity of cervicovaginal HIV.

In this study, we evaluated the concordance between test results obtained for 1,000 plasma specimens collected from HIV-1-infected individuals measured with the VERSANT HIV-1 RNA 3.0 assay (bDNA) and the COBAS AMPLICOR HIV-1 MONITOR 1.5 test (PCR). We compared viral load values obtained by each of these assays throughout their dynamic ranges, with particular focus on samples with low viral load (i.e. 50-250 copies/mL), and calculated the estimated distribution of distinct plasma viral load levels for the entire study population modeled from the data observed in the study. We found that these two assays show excellent agreement, with a correlation (R(2)) of 0.957 and a slope of 1.004. The mean difference in viral load values between the two assays was less than 0.10-log(10) throughout the dynamic range and 98.2% of all samples had bDNA and PCR results within 0.5-log(10) of each other, a difference that is within the range considered to be a minimal change in plasma viremia. Moreover, the two assays show very similar results across all assay ranges tested. The estimated prevalence of samples with results <50 copies/mL, 50-250 copies/mL, and 250-500,000 copies/mL were 41.6%, 7.7%, and 49.7%, respectively, by the bDNA assay, and 42.4%, 6.9%, and 50.7%, respectively, by the PCR assay. Based on our findings from 1,000 clinical specimens, we do not see the need to re-establish a baseline value or apply a conversion factor when switching from one assay to the other. Since the majority of our patient population likely is infected with subtype B virus, it is unclear if our findings will apply to other patient populations with a greater incidence of infection with non-B subtypes.\n\nEvaluation of performance across the dynamic range of the Abbott RealTime HIV-1 assay as compared to VERSANT HIV-1 RNA 3.0 and AMPLICOR HIV-1 MONITOR v1.5 using serial dilutions of 39 group M and O viruses.\n\nPubMed\n\nSwanson, Priscilla; Huang, Shihai; Abravaya, Klara; de Mendoza, Carmen; Soriano, Vincent; Devare, Sushil G; Hackett, John\n\n2007-04-01\n\nPerformance of the Abbott m2000 instrument system and the Abbott RealTime HIV-1 assay was evaluated using a panel of 37 group M (subtypes A-D, F, G, CRF01_AE, CRF02_AG and unique recombinant forms) and 2 group O virus isolates. Testing was performed on 273 sample dilutions and compared to VERSANT HIV-1 RNA 3.0 (bDNA) and AMPLICOR HIV-1 MONITOR v1.5 (Monitor v1.5) test results. RealTime HIV-1, bDNA, and Monitor v1.5 tests quantified 87%, 78%, and 81% of samples, respectively. RealTime HIV-1 detected an additional 31 samples at < 40 copies/mL. For group M, RealTime HIV-1 dilution profiles and viral loads were highly correlated with bDNA and Monitor v1.5 values; 87% and 89% of values were within 0.5 log(10) copies/mL. In contrast, the group O viruses were not detected by Monitor v1.5 and were substantially underquantified by approximately 2 log(10) copies/mL in bDNA relative to the RealTime HIV-1 assay. Sequence analysis revealed that RealTime HIV-1 primer/probe binding sites are highly conserved and exhibit fewer nucleotide mismatches relative to Monitor v1.5. The automated m2000 system and RealTime HIV-1 assay offer the advantages of efficient sample processing and throughput with reduced \"hands-on\" time while providing improved sensitivity, expanded dynamic range and reliable quantification of genetically diverse HIV-1 strains.\n\nDetection of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) RNA in Pools of Sera Negative for Antibodies to HIV-1 and HIV-2\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMorandi, Pierre-Alain; Schockmel, GÃ©rard A.; Yerly, Sabine; Burgisser, Philippe; Erb, Peter; Matter, Lukas; Sitavanc, Radan; Perrin, Luc\n\n1998-01-01\n\nA total of 234 pools were prepared from 10,692 consecutive serum samples negative for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2 collected at five virological laboratories (average pool size, 45 serum samples). Pools were screened for the presence of HIV-1 RNA by a modified commercial assay (Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor test) which included an additional polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation step prior to purification of viral RNA (PEG Amplicor assay). The sensitivity of this assay for HIV-1 RNA detection in individual serum samples within pools matches that of standard commercial assays for individual serum samples, i.e., 500 HIV-1 RNA copies per ml. Five pools were identified as positive, and each one contained one antibody-negative, HIV-1 RNA-positive serum sample, corresponding to an average of 1 infected sample per 2,138 serum samples. Retrospective analysis revealed that the five HIV-1 RNA-positive specimens originated from individuals who had symptomatic primary HIV-1 infection at the time of sample collection and who were also positive for p24 antigenemia. We next assessed the possibility of performing the prepurification step by high-speed centrifugation (50,000 Ã g for 80 min) of 1.5-ml pools containing 25 Î¼l of 60 individual serum samples, of which only 1 contained HIV-1 RNA (centrifugation Amplicor assay). The sensitivity of this assay also matches the sensitivities of standard commercial assays for HIV-1 RNA detection in individual serum samples. The results demonstrate that both assays with pooled sera can be applied to the screening of large numbers of serum samples in a time- and cost-efficient manner.

Here, a quantitative HIV assay based on competitive reverse transcription-PCR with multiple competitors was developed. Four RNA competitors containing identical PCR primer binding sequences as the viral HIV-1 RNA target were constructed. One of the PCR primers was fluorescently labeled, which facilitated discrimination between the viral RNA and competitor amplicons by fragment analysis with conventional automated sequencers. The coamplification of known amounts of the RNA competitors provided the means to establish internal calibration curves for the individual reactions resulting in exclusion of tube-to-tube variations. Calibration curves were created from the peak areas, which were proportional to the starting amount of each competitor. The fluorescence detection format was expanded to provide a dynamic range of more than 5 log units. This quantitative assay allowed for reproducible analysis of samples containing as few as 40 viral copies of HIV-1 RNA per reaction. The within- and between-run coefficients of variation were <24% (range, 10 to 24) and <36% (range, 27 to 36), respectively. The high reproducibility (standard deviation, <0.13 log) of the overall procedure for quantification of HIV-1 RNA in plasma, including sample preparation, amplification, and detection variations, allowed reliable detection of a 0.5-log change in RNA viral load. The assay could be a useful tool for monitoring HIV-1 disease progression and antiviral treatment and can easily be adapted to the quantification of other pathogens.

Previously, we defined a pathway of sequential intracellular HIV-1 capsid assembly intermediates; here we sought to identify the intermediate in which HIV-1 Gag first associates with unspliced HIV-1 RNA. In provirus-expressing cells, unspliced HIV-1 RNA was not found in the soluble fraction of the cytosol, but instead was largely in complexes â¥30S. We did not detect unspliced HIV-1 RNA associated with Gag in the first assembly intermediate, which consists of soluble Gag. Instead, the earliest assembly intermediate in which we detected Gag associated with unspliced HIV-1 RNA was the second assembly intermediate (~80S intermediate), which is derived from a host RNA granule containing two cellular facilitators of assembly, ABCE1 and the RNA granule protein DDX6. At steady-state, this RNA-granule-derived ~80S complex was the smallest assembly intermediate that contained Gag associated with unspliced viral RNA, regardless of whether lysates contained intact or disrupted ribosomes, or expressed WT or assembly-defective Gag. A similar complex was identified in HIV-1-infected T cells. RNA-granule-derived assembly intermediates were detected in situ as sites of Gag colocalization with ABCE1 and DDX6; moreover these granules were far more numerous and smaller than well-studied RNA granules termed P bodies. Finally, we identified two steps that lead to association of assembling Gag with unspliced HIV-1 RNA. Independent of viral-RNA-binding, Gag associates with a broad class of RNA granules that largely lacks unspliced viral RNA (step 1). If a viral-RNA-binding domain is present, Gag further localizes to a subset of these granules that contains unspliced viral RNA (step 2). Thus, our data raise the possibility that HIV-1 packaging is initiated not by soluble Gag, but by Gag targeted to a subset of host RNA granules containing\n\nIdentifying the assembly intermediate in which Gag first associates with unspliced HIV-1 RNA suggests a novel model for HIV-1 RNA packaging\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBarajas, Brook C.; Tanaka, Motoko; Robinson, Bridget A.; Phuong, Daryl J.; Reed, Jonathan C.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nDuring immature capsid assembly, HIV-1 genome packaging is initiated when Gag first associates with unspliced HIV-1 RNA by a poorly understood process.

The REV/RRE-dependent nuclear export of unspliced/partially spliced viral transcripts needs the assistance of host proteins. Recent studies have shown that MOV10 overexpression inhibited HIV-1 replication at various steps. However, the endogenous MOV10 was required in certain step(s) of HIV-1 replication. In this report, we found that MOV10 potently enhances the nuclear export of viral mRNAs and subsequently increases the expression of Gag protein and other late products through affecting the Rev/RRE axis. The co-immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that MOV10 interacts with Rev in an RNA-independent manner. The DEAG-boxmoreÂ Â» of MOV10 was required for the enhancement of Rev/RRE-dependent nuclear export and the DEAG-box mutant showed a dominant-negative activity. Our data propose that HIV-1 utilizes the anti-viral factor MOV10 to function as a co-factor of Rev and demonstrate the complicated effects of MOV10 on HIV-1 life cycle. - Highlights: â¢ MOV10 can function as a co-factor of HIV-1 Rev. â¢ MOV10 facilitates Rev/RRE-dependent transport of viral mRNAs. â¢ MOV10 interacts with Rev in an RNA-independent manner. â¢ The DEAG-box of MOV10 is required for the enhancement of Rev/RRE-dependent export.Â«Â less\n\nDynamics of HIV-1 RNA Near the Plasma Membrane during Virus Assembly.\n\nPubMed\n\nSardo, Luca; Hatch, Steven C; Chen, Jianbo; Nikolaitchik, Olga; Burdick, Ryan C; Chen, De; Westlake, Christopher J; Lockett, Stephen; Pathak, Vinay K; Hu, Wei-Shau\n\n2015-11-01\n\nmost HIV-1 RNAs stayed at the plasma membrane for 15 to 60 min in the presence of Gag. Our results also demonstrated that only a small proportion of the HIV-1 RNAs, approximately 1/10 to 1/3 of the RNAs that reached the plasma membrane, was incorporated into viral protein complexes. These studies determined the dynamics of HIV-1 RNA on the plasma membrane and obtained temporal information on RNA-Gag interactions that lead to RNA encapsidation.

We studied the establishment of HIV reservoirs in semen and blood during PHI, along with systemic immune activation and the impact of early cART. Patients in the ANRS-147-OPTIPRIM trial received two years of early cART. Nineteen patients of the trial were analyzed, out of which 8 had acute PHI (WB â¤1 Ab). We quantified total cell-associated (ca) HIV-DNA in blood and semen and HIV-RNA in blood and semen plasma samples, collected during PHI and at 24 months of treatment. At enrollment, HIV-RNA load was higher in blood than in semen (median 5.66 vs 4.22 log10 cp/mL, p<0.0001). Semen HIV-RNA load correlated strongly with blood HIV-RNA load (r = 0.81, p = 0.02, the CD4 cell count (r = -0.98, p<0.0001), and the CD4/CD8 ratio (r = -0.85, p<0.01) in acute infection but not in later stages of PHI. Median blood and seminal cellular HIV-DNA levels were 3.59 and 0.31 log10cp/106 cells, respectively. HIV-DNA load peaked in semen later than in blood and then correlated with blood IP10 level (r = 0.62, p = 0.04). HIV-RNA was undetectable in blood and semen after two years of effective cART. Semen HIV-DNA load declined similarly, except in one patient who had persistently high IP-10 and IL-6 levels and used recreational drugs. HIV reservoir cells are found in semen during PHI, with gradual compartmentalization. Its size was linked to the plasma IP-10 level. Early treatment purges both the virus and infected cells, reducing the high risk of transmission during PHI.

We analyzed the influence of plasma HIV RNA (pHIV) detectability and of other clinical and viro-immunological variables on liver stiffness (LS) measurement in adult immunocompetent HIV-monoinfected patients and in patients coinfected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Methods Logistic regression analysis was performed using the value of LS>7.1 kPa as the dependent variable. A linear regression model was applied using LS measurement after log10 transformation (lkpa) as the dependent variable and we analyzed the predicted values versus the observed lkpa values; pHIV was classified as detectable or undetectable in the 12- and 36-month study periods before LS measurement. Results We studied 251 patients (178 with HIV monoinfection), most of whom were on antiviral treatment; 36-month study time was available for 154 subjects. The mean CD4+ cell count was 634 cells/mm3 in HIV-monoinfected patients and 606 cells/mm3 in coinfected patients. No difference in LS was found between patients with detectable or undetectable pHIV in either the 12- or the 36-month study period before transient elastography. The mean LS was higher in HIV/HCV coinfected patients (P<0.0001) than in the HIV-monoinfected subjects; lkpa was positively correlated with HCV coinfection (P<0.0001) and aspartate aminotransferase levels (P<0.0001). Detectable pHIV failed to reach significance. Eight HIV-monoinfected patients had a predicted LS measurement lower than the observed one, while eight patie"
