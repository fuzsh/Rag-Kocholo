We used a well-validated siRNA (si510) which targets the poly A/TAR (transactivator of the HIV-1 LTR) site and suppresses viral replication. Nanotechnology holds much potential for impact in the field of HIV-1 therapeutics, and nanoparticles such as quantum rods (QRs) can be easily functionalized to incorporate siRNA forming stable nanoplexes that can be used for gene silencing. We evaluated the efficacy of the QR-si510 HIV-1 siRNA nanoplex in suppressing viral replication in the HIV-1-infected monocytic cell line THP-1 by measuring p24 antigen levels and gene expression levels of HIV-1 LTR. Our results suggest that the QR-si510 HIV-1 siRNA nanoplex is not only effective in delivering siRNA, but also in suppressing HIV-1 viral replication for a longer time period. HIV-1 nanotherapeutics can thus enhance systemic bioavailability and offer multifunctionality.

Previously, we defined a pathway of sequential intracellular HIV-1 capsid assembly intermediates; here we sought to identify the intermediate in which HIV-1 Gag first associates with unspliced HIV-1 RNA. In provirus-expressing cells, unspliced HIV-1 RNA was not found in the soluble fraction of the cytosol, but instead was largely in complexes â¥30S. We did not detect unspliced HIV-1 RNA associated with Gag in the first assembly intermediate, which consists of soluble Gag. Instead, the earliest assembly intermediate in which we detected Gag associated with unspliced HIV-1 RNA was the second assembly intermediate (~80S intermediate), which is derived from a host RNA granule containing two cellular facilitators of assembly, ABCE1 and the RNA granule protein DDX6. At steady-state, this RNA-granule-derived ~80S complex was the smallest assembly intermediate that contained Gag associated with unspliced viral RNA, regardless of whether lysates contained intact or disrupted ribosomes, or expressed WT or assembly-defective Gag. A similar complex was identified in HIV-1-infected T cells. RNA-granule-derived assembly intermediates were detected in situ as sites of Gag colocalization with ABCE1 and DDX6; moreover these granules were far more numerous and smaller than well-studied RNA granules termed P bodies. Finally, we identified two steps that lead to association of assembling Gag with unspliced HIV-1 RNA. Independent of viral-RNA-binding, Gag associates with a broad class of RNA granules that largely lacks unspliced viral RNA (step 1). If a viral-RNA-binding domain is present, Gag further localizes to a subset of these granules that contains unspliced viral RNA (step 2).

Genital infections can increase HIV-1 RNA shedding in semen, but shedding also occurs in the absence of typical pathogens. We hypothesized that higher bacterial concentrations in semen would be associated with higher HIV-1 RNA levels. We analyzed semen samples from 42 HIV-1-seropositive Kenyan men using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to assess bacterial concentrations and real-time PCR to measure HIV-1 RNA levels. Generalized estimation equations were used to evaluate associations between these 2 measures. Broad-range 16S rRNA gene PCR with pyrosequencing was performed on a subset of 13 samples to assess bacterial community composition. Bacteria were detected in 96.6% of 88 samples by quantitative PCR. Semen bacterial concentration and HIV-1 RNA levels were correlated 0.30 (P = 0.01). The association between bacterial concentration and HIV-1 RNA detection was not significant after adjustment for antiretroviral therapy (ART) (adjusted odds ratio: 1.27, 95% CI: 0.84 to 1.91). Factors associated with semen bacterial concentration included insertive anal sex (adjusted beta 0.92, 95% CI: 0.12 to 1.73) and ART use (adjusted beta: -0.77, 95% CI: -1.50 to 0.04). Among 13 samples with pyrosequencing data, Corynebacterium spp., Staphylococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp. were most frequently detected. Most of these HIV-1-infected men had bacteria in their semen. ART use was associated with undetectable semen HIV-1 RNA and lower semen bacterial concentrations, whereas insertive anal sex was associated with higher bacterial concentrations. Additional studies evaluating the relationship between semen bacteria, inflammation, mucosal immunity, and HIV-1 shedding are needed to understand implications for HIV-1 transmission.\n\nHIV-1-encoded antisense RNA suppresses viral replication for a prolonged period\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground Recent evidence proposes a novel concept that mammalian natural antisense RNAs play important roles in cellular homeostasis by regulating the expression of several genes. Identification and characterization of retroviral antisense RNA would provide new insights into mechanisms of replication and pathogenesis. HIV-1 encoded-antisense RNAs have been reported, although their structures and functions remain to be studied. We have tried to identify and characterize antisense RNAs of HIV-1 and their function in viral infection. Results Characterization of transcripts of HEK293T cells that were transiently transfected with an expression plasmid with HIV-1NL4â3 DNA in the antisense orientation showed that various antisense transcripts can be expressed. By screening and characterizing antisense RNAs in HIV-1NL4â3-infected cells, we defined the primary structure of a major form of HIV-1 antisense RNAs, which corresponds to a variant of previously reported ASP mRNA. This 2.6 kb RNA was transcribed from the U3 region of the 3â² LTR and terminated at the env region in acutely or chronically infected cell lines and acutely infected human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Reporter assays clearly demonstrated that the HIV-1 LTR harbours promoter activity in the reverse orientation. Mutation analyses suggested the involvement of NF-ÎºÎ binding sites in the regulation of antisense transcription. The antisense RNA was localized in the nuclei of the infected cells. The expression of this antisense RNA suppressed HIV-1 replication for more than one month. Furthermore, the specific knockdown of this antisense RNA enhanced HIV-1 gene expression and replication. Conclusions The results of the present study identified an accurate structure of the major form of antisense RNAs expressed from the HIV-1NL4â3 provirus and demonstrated its nuclear localization. Functional studies collectively demonstrated a new role of the antisense RNA in viral replication. Thus, we suggest\n\nThe export receptor Crm1 forms a dimer to promote nuclear export of HIV RNA.\n\nPubMed\n\nBooth, David S; Cheng, Yifan; Frankel, Alan D\n\n2014-12-08\n\nThe HIV Rev protein routes viral RNAs containing the Rev Response Element (RRE) through the Crm1 nuclear export pathway to the cytoplasm where viral proteins are expressed and genomic RNA is delivered to assembling virions. The RRE assembles a Rev oligomer that displays nuclear export sequences (NESs) for recognition by the Crm1-Ran(GTP) nuclear receptor complex. Here we provide the first view of an assembled HIV-host nuclear export complex using single-particle electron microscopy. Unexpectedly, Crm1 forms a dimer with an extensive interface that enhances association with Rev-RRE and poises NES binding sites to interact with a Rev oligomer. The interface between Crm1 monomers explains differences between Crm1 orthologs that alter nuclear export and determine cellular tropism for viral replication. The arrangement of the export complex identifies a novel binding surface to possibly target an HIV inhibitor and may point to a broader role for Crm1 dimerization in regulating host gene expression.\n\nThe HIV-1 Rev/RRE system is required for HIV-1 5' UTR cis elements to augment encapsidation of heterologous RNA into HIV-1 viral particles\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBackground The process of HIV-1 genomic RNA (gRNA) encapsidation is governed by a number of viral encoded components, most notably the Gag protein and gRNA cis elements in the canonical packaging signal (Ï). Also implicated in encapsidation are cis determinants in the R, U5, and PBS (primer binding site) from the 5' untranslated region (UTR). Although conventionally associated with nuclear export of HIV-1 RNA, there is a burgeoning role for the Rev/RRE in the encapsidation process. Pleiotropic effects exhibited by these cis and trans viral components may confound the ability to examine their independent, and combined, impact on encapsidation of RNA into HIV-1 viral particles in their innate viral context. We systematically reconstructed the HIV-1 packaging system in the context of a heterologous murine leukemia virus (MLV) vector RNA to elucidate a mechanism in which the Rev/RRE system is central to achieving efficient and specific encapsidation into HIV-1 viral particles. Results We show for the first time that the Rev/RRE system can augment RNA encapsidation independent of all cis elements from the 5' UTR (R, U5, PBS, and Ï). Incorporation of all the 5' UTR cis elements did not enhance RNA encapsidation in the absence of the Rev/RRE system. In fact, we demonstrate that the Rev/RRE system is required for specific and efficient encapsidation commonly associated with the canonical packaging signal. The mechanism of Rev/RRE-mediated encapsidation is not a general phenomenon, since the combination of the Rev/RRE system and 5' UTR cis elements did not enhance encapsidation into MLV-derived viral particles. Lastly, we show that heterologous MLV RNAs conform to transduction properties commonly associated with HIV-1 viral particles, including in vivo transduction of non-dividing cells (i.e. mouse neurons); however, the cDNA forms are episomes predominantly in the 1-LTR circle form. Conclusions Premised on encapsidation of a heterologous RNA into HIV-1 viral particles\n\nSemen Bacterial Concentrations and HIV-1 RNA Shedding Among HIV-1âSeropositive Kenyan Men\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSrinivasan, Sujatha; Huang, Dandi; Ko, Daisy L.; Sanders, Eduard J.; Peshu, Norbert M.; Krieger, John N.; Muller, Charles H.; Coombs, Robert W.; Fredricks, David N.; Graham, Susan M.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIntroduction: HIV-1 is transmitted through semen from men to their sexual partners.

While there is hope that elimination of HIV-1 can be achieved, several approaches to reach a functional cure (control of HIV-1 replication in the absence of drug therapy) are also under investigation. One of these approaches is the transplant of HIV-1 resistant cells expressing anti-HIV-1 RNAs, proteins or peptides. Small RNAs that use RNA interference pathways to target HIV-1 replication have emerged as competitive candidates for cell transplant therapy and have been included in all gene combinations that have so far entered clinical trials. Here, we review RNA interference pathways in mammalian cells and the design of therapeutic small RNAs that use these pathways to target pathogenic RNA sequences. Studies that have been performed to identify anti-HIV-1 RNA interference therapeutics are also reviewed and perspectives on their use in combination gene therapy to functionally cure HIV-1 infection are provided.\n\nDetection of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) RNA in Pools of Sera Negative for Antibodies to HIV-1 and HIV-2\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMorandi, Pierre-Alain; Schockmel, GÃ©rard A.; Yerly, Sabine; Burgisser, Philippe; Erb, Peter; Matter, Lukas; Sitavanc, Radan; Perrin, Luc\n\n1998-01-01\n\nA total of 234 pools were prepared from 10,692 consecutive serum samples negative for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2 collected at five virological laboratories (average pool size, 45 serum samples). Pools were screened for the presence of HIV-1 RNA by a modified commercial assay (Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor test) which included an additional polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation step prior to purification of viral RNA (PEG Amplicor assay). The sensitivity of this assay for HIV-1 RNA detection in individual serum samples within pools matches that of standard commercial assays for individual serum samples, i.e., 500 HIV-1 RNA copies per ml. Five pools were identified as positive, and each one contained one antibody-negative, HIV-1 RNA-positive serum sample, corresponding to an average of 1 infected sample per 2,138 serum samples. Retrospective analysis revealed that the five HIV-1 RNA-positive specimens originated from individuals who had symptomatic primary HIV-1 infection at the time of sample collection and who were also positive for p24 antigenemia. We next assessed the possibility of performing the prepurification step by high-speed centrifugation (50,000 Ã g for 80 min) of 1.5-ml pools containing 25 Î¼l of 60 individual serum samples, of which only 1 contained HIV-1 RNA (centrifugation Amplicor assay). The sensitivity of this assay also matches the sensitivities of standard commercial assays for HIV-1 RNA detection in individual serum samples. The results demonstrate that both assays with pooled sera can be applied to the screening of large numbers of serum samples in a time- and cost-efficient manner.

Reliable methods to detect breast milk viral load are important. To correlate the ability of the VERSANT HIV 3.0 (bDNA) assay to real-time (RT) TaqMan PCR in quantifying breast milk HIV-1 RNA. Forty-six breast milk samples that had been spiked with cell-free HIV-1 and eight samples spiked with cell-associated HIV-1 were assayed for HIV-1 RNA by both VERSANT HIV 3.0 and TaqMan RNA assays. Only assays on the cell-free samples were statistically compared. Both a Deming regression slope and a Bland-Altman slope indicated a linear relationship between the two assays. TaqMan quantitations were on average 2.6 times higher than those of HIV 3.0. A linear relationship was observed between serial dilutions of spiked cell-free HIV-1 and both the VERSANT HIV 3.0 and the TaqMan RNA assays. The two methods correlated well although the VERSANT HIV 3.0 research protocol quantified HIV-1 RNA slightly lower than TaqMan.\n\nN6-methyladenosine of HIV-1 RNA regulates viral infection and HIV-1 Gag protein expression\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTirumuru, Nagaraja; Zhao, Boxuan Simen; Lu, Wuxun; Lu, Zhike; He, Chuan; Wu, Li\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe internal N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation of eukaryotic nuclear RNA controls post-transcriptional gene expression, which is regulated by methyltransferases (writers), demethylases (erasers), and m6A-binding proteins (readers) in cells. The YTH domain family proteins (YTHDF1â3) bind to m6A-modified cellular RNAs and affect RNA metabolism and processing. Here, we show that YTHDF1â3 proteins recognize m6A-modified HIV-1 RNA and inhibit HIV-1 infection in cell lines and primary CD4+ T-cells. We further mapped the YTHDF1â3 binding sites in HIV-1 RNA from infected cells. We found that the overexpression of YTHDF proteins in cells inhibited HIV-1 infection mainly by decreasing HIV-1 reverse transcription, while knockdown of YTHDF1â3 in cells had the opposite effects. Moreover, silencing the m6A writers decreased HIV-1 Gag protein expression in virus-producing cells, while silencing the m6A erasers increased Gag expression. Our findings suggest an important role of m6A modification of HIV-1 RNA in viral infection and HIV-1 protein synthesis.

Given the presence of retained introns and instability AU-rich sequences, this viral transcript is normally retained and degraded in the nucleus of host cells unless the viral protein REV is present. As such, the stability of the HIV-1 unspliced mRNA must be particularly controlled in the nucleus and the cytoplasm in order to ensure proper levels of this viral mRNA for translation and viral particle formation. During its journey, the HIV-1 unspliced mRNA assembles into highly specific messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs) containing many different host proteins, amongst which are well-known regulators of cytoplasmic mRNA decay pathways such as up-frameshift suppressor 1 homolog (UPF1), Staufen double-stranded RNA binding protein 1/2 (STAU1/2), or components of miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) and processing bodies (PBs). More recently, the HIV-1 unspliced mRNA was shown to contain N6-methyladenosine (m6A), allowing the recruitment of YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein 2 (YTHDF2), an m6A reader host protein involved in mRNA decay. Interestingly, these host proteins involved in mRNA decay were shown to play positive roles in viral gene expression and viral particle assembly, suggesting that HIV-1 interacts with mRNA decay components to successfully accomplish viral replication. This review summarizes the state of the art in terms of the interactions between HIV-1 unspliced mRNA and components of different host mRNA decay machineries.

We assessed the frequency, magnitude, and correlates of seminal HIV-1 RNA shedding in HIV-1-infected African men initiating ART. Seminal HIV-1 RNA was detected in 24% (37 of 155), 10% (5 of 49), and 11% (8 of 70) of samples collected 0-3, 4-6, and >6 months after ART initiation. When blood HIV-1 levels were suppressed, seminal HIV-1 RNA was detected in 8% (16 of 195), and 82% (13 of 16) had an HIV-1 RNA load of < 1000 copies/mL. Seminal HIV-1 RNA shedding was infrequent and present at low levels in HIV-1-infected African men with suppressed blood HIV-1 RNA. Â© The Author 2016.

We labeled HIV-1 RNA with a photoconvertible Eos protein via an RNA-binding protein that recognizes stem-loop sequences engineered into the viral genome. Near-UV light exposure causes an irreversible structural change in Eos and alters its emitted fluorescence from green to red. We studied the dynamics of HIV-1 RNA by photoconverting Eos near the plasma membrane, and we monitored the population of photoconverted red-Eos-labeled RNA signals over time. We found that in the absence of Gag, most of the HIV-1 RNAs stayed near the plasma membrane transiently, for a few minutes. The presence of Gag significantly increased the time that RNAs stayed near the plasma membrane: most of the RNAs were still detected after 30 min. We then quantified the proportion of HIV-1 RNAs near the plasma membrane that were packaged into assembling viral complexes. By tagging Gag with blue fluorescent protein, we observed that only a portion, â¼13 to 34%, of the HIV-1 RNAs that reached the membrane were recruited into assembling particles in an hour, and the frequency of HIV-1 RNA packaging varied with the Gag expression level. Our studies reveal the HIV-1 RNA dynamics on the plasma membrane and the efficiency of RNA recruitment and provide insights into the events leading to the generation of infectious HIV-1 virions. Nascent HIV-1 particles assemble on plasma membranes. During the assembly process, HIV-1 RNA genomes must be encapsidated into viral complexes to generate infectious particles. To gain insights into the RNA packaging and virus assembly mechanisms, we labeled and monitored the HIV-1 RNA signals near the plasma membrane. Our results showed that most of the HIV-1 RNAs stayed near the plasma membrane for only a few minutes in the absence of Gag, whereas\n\nEvaluation of the Aptima HIV-1 Quant Dx Assay for HIV-1 RNA Quantitation in Different Biological Specimen Types\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYek, Christina; Massanella, Marta; Peling, Tashi; Lednovich, Kristen; Nair, Sangeetha V.; Worlock, Andrew; Vargas, Milenka; Gianella, Sara; Ellis, Ronald J.; Strain, Matthew C.; Busch, Michael P.; Nugent, C. Thomas\n\n2017-01-01\n\nABSTRACT The search for a cure for HIV infection has highlighted the need for increasingly sensitive and precise assays to measure viral burden in various tissues and body fluids. We describe the application of a standardized assay for HIV-1 RNA in multiple specimen types. The fully automated Aptima HIV-1 Quant Dx assay (Aptima assay) is FDA cleared for blood plasma HIV-1 RNA quantitation. In this study, the Aptima assay was applied for the quantitation of HIV RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs; n = 72), seminal plasma (n = 20), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; n = 36), dried blood spots (DBS; n = 104), and dried plasma spots (DPS; n = 104). The Aptima assay was equivalent to or better than commercial assays or validated in-house assays for the quantitation of HIV RNA in CSF and seminal plasma. For PBMC specimens, the sensitivity of the Aptima assay in the detection of HIV RNA decayed as background uninfected PBMC counts increased; proteinase K treatment demonstrated some benefit in restoring signal at higher levels of background PBMCs. Finally, the Aptima assay yielded 100% detection rates of DBS in participants with plasma HIV RNA levels of â¥35 copies/ml and 100% detection rates of DPS in participants with plasma HIV RNA levels of â¥394 copies/ml. The Aptima assay can be applied to a variety of specimens from HIV-infected subjects to measure HIV RNA for studies of viral persistence and cure strategies. It can also detect HIV in dried blood and plasma specimens, which may be of benefit in resource-limited settings.

It can also detect HIV in dried blood and plasma specimens, which may be of benefit in resource-limited settings.\n\nComparison of the COBAS TAQMAN HIV-1 HPS with VERSANT HIV-1 RNA 3.0 assay (bDNA) for plasma RNA quantitation in different HIV-1 subtypes.\n\nPubMed\n\nGomes, PerpÃ©tua; Palma, Ana Carolina; Cabanas, Joaquim; Abecasis, Ana; Carvalho, Ana PatrÃ­cia; Ziermann, Rainer; Diogo, Isabel; GonÃ§alves, FÃ¡tima; Lobo, CÃ©u Sousa; Camacho, Ricardo\n\n2006-08-01\n\nQuantitation of HIV-1 RNA levels in plasma has an undisputed prognostic value and is extremely important for evaluating response to antiretroviral therapy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of the real-time PCR COBAS TaqMan 48 analyser, comparing it to the existing VERSANT 3.0 (bDNA) for HIV-1 RNA quantitation in plasma of individuals infected with different HIV-1 subtypes (104 blood samples). A positive linear correlation between the two tests (r2 = 0.88) was found. Quantitation by the COBAS TaqMan assay was approximately 0.32log10 higher than by bDNA. The relationship between the two assays was similar within all subtypes with a Deming regression of <1 and <0 for the Bland-Altman plots. Overall, no significant differences were found in plasma viral load quantitation in different HIV-1 subtypes between both assays; therefore these assays are suitable for viral load quantitation of highly genetically diverse HIV-1 plasma samples.\n\nAn RNA-binding compound that stabilizes the HIV-1 gRNA packaging signal structure and specifically blocks HIV-1 RNA encapsidation.\n\nPubMed\n\nIngemarsdotter, Carin K; Zeng, Jingwei; Long, Ziqi; Lever, Andrew M L; Kenyon, Julia C\n\n2018-03-14\n\nNSC260594, a quinolinium derivative from the NCI diversity set II compound library, was previously identified in a target-based assay as an inhibitor of the interaction between the HIV-1 (Ï) stem-loop 3 (SL3) RNA and Gag. This compound was shown to exhibit potent antiviral activity. Here, the effects of this compound on individual stages of the viral lifecycle were examined by qRT-PCR, ELISA and Western blot, to see if its actions were specific to the viral packaging stage. The structural effects of NSC260594 binding to the HIV-1 gRNA were also examined by SHAPE and dimerization assays. Treatment of cells with NSC260594 did not reduce the number of integration events of incoming virus, and treatment of virus producing cells did not affect the level of intracellular Gag protein or viral particle release as determined by immunoblot. However, NSC260594 reduced the incorporation of gRNA into virions by up to 82%, without affecting levels of gRNA inside the cell. This reduction in packaging correlated closely with the reduction in infectivity of the released viral particles. To establish the structural effects of NSC260594 on the HIV-1 gRNA, we performed SHAPE analyses to pinpoint RNA structural changes. NSC260594 had a stabilizing effect on the wild type RNA that was not confined to SL3, but that was propagated across the structure. A packaging mutant lacking SL3 did not show this effect. NSC260594 acts as a specific inhibitor of HIV-1 RNA packaging. No other viral functions are affected. Its action involves preventing the interaction of Gag with SL3 by stabilizing this small RNA stem-loop which then leads to stabilization of theÂ global packaging signal region (psi or Ï). This confirms data, previously only shown in analyses of isolated SL3 oligonucleotides, that SL3 is structurally labile in the presence of Gag and that this is critical for the complete psi region to be able to adopt different conformations. Since replication is otherwise unaffected by NSC260594\n\nDifferent effects of the TAR structure on HIV-1 and HIV-2 genomic RNA translation\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSoto-Rifo, Ricardo; Limousin, Taran; Rubilar, Paulina S.; Ricci, Emiliano P.; DÃ©cimo, Didier; MoncorgÃ©, Olivier; Trabaud, Mary-Anne; AndrÃ©, Patrice; Cimarelli, Andrea; Ohlmann, ThÃ©ophile\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe 5â²-untranslated region (5â²-UTR) of the genomic RNA of human immunodeficiency viruses type-1 (HIV-1) and type-2 (HIV-2) is composed of highly structured RNA motifs essential for viral replication that are expected to interfere with Gag and Gag-Pol translation. Here, we have analyzed and compared the properties by which the viral 5â²-UTR drives translation from the genomic RNA of both human immunodeficiency viruses. Our results showed that translation from the HIV-2 gRNA was very poor compared to that of HIV-1. This was rather due to the intrinsic structural motifs in their respective 5â²-UTR without involvement of any viral protein. Further investigation pointed to a different role of TAR RNA, which was much inhibitory for HIV-2 translation. Altogether, these data highlight important structural and functional differences between these two human pathogens.

It has been described that a member of the ADAR family, ADAR1, can target viruses and affect their replication process. Here we report evidence showing that ADAR1 stimulates human immuno deficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication by using both editing-dependent and editing-independent mechanisms. We show that over-expression of ADAR1 in HIV-1 producer cells increases viral protein accumulation in an editing-independent manner. Moreover, HIV-1 virions generated in the presence of over-expressed ADAR1 but not an editing-inactive ADAR1 mutant are released more efficiently and display enhanced infectivity, as demonstrated by challenge assays performed with T cell lines and primary CD4+ T lymphocytes. Finally, we report that ADAR1 associates with HIV-1 RNAs and edits adenosines in the 5â² untranslated region (UTR) and the Rev and Tat coding sequence. Overall these results suggest that HIV-1 has evolved mechanisms to take advantage of specific RNA editing activity of the host cell and disclose a stimulatory function of ADAR1 in the spread of HIV-1.

Extreme HIV-1 genetic variability in Africa may affect the ability of commercially available assays to detect and quantify HIV-1 RNA accurately. The aim of this study was to compare three real-time PCR assays for quantitation of plasma HIV-1 RNA levels in patients from the Republic of Congo, an area with highly diversified HIV-1 subtypes and recombinants. The Abbott RealTime HIV-1, BioMÃ©rieux HIV-1 EasyQ test 1.2 and Cobas AmpliPrep/Cobas TaqMan HIV-1 1.0 were compared for quantitation of HIV-1 RNA in 37 HIV-1 seropositive pregnant women enrolled in the Kento-Mwana project for prevention of mother-to-child transmission in Pointe-Noire, Republic of Congo. The sample panel included a variety of HIV-1 subtypes with as many as 21 (56.8%) putative unique recombinant forms. Qualitative detection of HIV-1 RNA was concordant by all three assays in 33/37 (89.2%) samples. Of the remaining 4 (10.8%) samples, all were positive by Roche, three by Abbott and none by BioMÃ©rieux. Differences exceeding 1Log in positive samples were found in 4/31 (12.9%), 10/31 (32.3%) and 5/31 (16.1%) cases between Abbott and BioMÃ©rieux, Roche and BioMÃ©rieux, and Abbott and Roche, respectively. In this sample panel representative of highly polymorphic HIV-1 in Congo, the agreement among the three assays was moderate in terms of HIV-1 RNA detectability and rather inconsistent in terms of quantitation.

To study the mechanism of dimerization and the DLS of HIV-1 RNA, large amounts of bona fide HIV-1 RNA and of mutants have been synthesized in vitro. We report that HIV-1 RNA forms dimeric molecules and that viral nucleocapsid (NC) protein NCp15 greatly activates dimerization. Deletion mutagenesis in the RNA 5' 1333 nucleotides indicated that a small domain of 100 nucleotides, located between positions 311 to 415 from the 5' end, is necessary and sufficient to promote HIV-1 RNA dimerization. This dimerization domain encompasses an encapsidation element located between the 5' splice donor site and initiator AUG of gag and shows little sequence variations in different strains of HIV-1. Furthermore, cross-linking analysis of the interactions between NC and HIV-1 RNA (311 to 415) locates a major contact site in the encapsidation element of HIV-1 RNA. The genomic RNA dimer is tightly associated with nucleocapsid protein molecules in avian and murine retroviruses, and this ribonucleoprotein structure is believed to be the template for reverse transcription. Genomic RNA-protein interactions have been analyzed in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) virions and results showed that NC protein molecules are tightly bound to the genomic RNA dimer. Since retroviral RNA dimerization and packaging appear to be under the control of the same cis element, the encapsidation sequences, and trans-acting factor, the NC protein, they are probably related events in the course of virion assembly.\n\nEvaluation of the clinical sensitivity for the quantification of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RNA in plasma: Comparison of the new COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 with three current HIV-RNA assays--LCx HIV RNA quantitative, VERSANT HIV-1 RNA 3.0 (bDNA) and COBAS AMPLICOR HIV-1 Monitor v1.5.\n\nPubMed\n\nKatsoulidou, Antigoni; Petrodaskalaki, Maria; Sypsa, Vana; Papachristou, Eleni; Anastassopoulou, Cleo G; Gargalianos, Panagiotis; Karafoulidou, Anastasia; Lazanas, Marios; Kordossis, Theodoros; Andoniadou, Anastasia; Hatzakis, Angelos\n\n2006-02-01\n\nThe COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 test (Roche Diagnostics) was compared with the LCx HIV RNA quantitative assay (Abbott Laboratories), the Versant HIV-1 RNA 3.0 (bDNA) assay (Bayer) and the COBAS Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor v1.5 test (Roche Diagnostics), using plasma samples of various viral load levels from HIV-1-infected individuals. In the comparison of TaqMan with LCx, TaqMan identified as positive 77.5% of the 240 samples versus 72.1% identified by LCx assay, while their overall agreement was 94.6% and the quantitative results of samples that were positive by both methods were strongly correlated (r=0.91). Similarly, in the comparison of TaqMan with bDNA 3.0, both methods identified 76.3% of the 177 samples as positive, while their overall agreement was 95.5% and the quantitative results of samples that were positive by both methods were strongly correlated (r=0.95). Finally, in the comparison of TaqMan with Monitor v1.5, TaqMan identified 79.5% of the 156 samples as positive versus 80.1% identified by Monitor v1.5, while their overall agreement was 95.5% and the quantitative results of samples that were positive by both methods were strongly correlated (r=0.96). In conclusion, the new COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 test showed excellent agreement with other widely used commercially available tests for the quantitation of HIV-1 viral load.\n\nAnalytical Performances of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 RNA-Based AmplixÂ® Real-Time PCR Platform for HIV-1 RNA Quantification\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMboumba Bouassa, Ralph-Sydney; Jenabian, Mohammad-Ali; Wolyec, Serge Tonen; Robin, Leman; Matta, Mathieu; Longo, Jean de Dieu; GrÃ©senguet, GÃ©rard; Andreoletti, Laurent; BÃ©lec, Laurent\n\n2016-01-01\n\nObjectives. We evaluated the performances of Amplix real-time PCR platform developed by Biosynex (Strasbourg, France), combining automated station extraction (Amplix station 16âDx) and real-time PCR (Amplix NG), for quantifying plasma HIV-1 RNA by lyophilized HIV-1 RNA-based Amplix reagents targeting gag and LTR, using samples from HIV-1-infected adults from Central African Republic. Results. Amplix real-time PCR assay showed low limit of detection (28âcopies/mL), across wide dynamic range (1.4â10âlogâcopies/mL), 100% sensitivity and 99% specificity, high reproducibility, and accuracy with mean bias < 5%. The assay showed excellent correlations and concordance of 95.3% with the reference HIV-1 RNA load assay (Roche), with mean absolute bias of +0.097âlogâcopies/mL by Bland-Altman analysis. The assay was able to detect and quantify the most prevalent HIV-1 subtype strains and the majority of non-B subtypes, CRFs of HIV-1 group M, and HIV-1 groups N and O circulating in Central Africa. The Amplix assay showed 100% sensitivity and 99.6% specificity to diagnose virological failure in clinical samples from antiretroviral drug-experienced patients. Conclusions. The HIV-1 RNA-based Amplix real-time PCR platform constitutes sensitive and reliable system for clinical monitoring of HIV-1 RNA load in HIV-1-infected children and adults, particularly adapted to intermediate laboratory facilities in sub-Saharan Africa.

However, the structural protein Gag is the only component required for the assembly of noninfectious viruslike particles, and the viral RNA is dispensable in this process. The mechanism that allows HIV-1 to achieve such high efficiency of genome packaging when a packageable viral RNA is not required for virus assembly is currently unknown. In this report, we examined the role of HIV-1 RNA in virus assembly and found that packageable HIV-1 RNA enhances particle production when Gag is expressed at levels similar to those in cells containing one provirus. However, such enhancement is diminished when Gag is overexpressed, suggesting that the effects of viral RNA can be replaced by increased Gag concentration in cells. We also showed that the specific interactions between Gag and viral RNA are required for the enhancement of particle production. Taken together, these studies are consistent with our previous hypothesis that specific dimeric viral RNA-Gag interactions are the nucleation event of infectious virion assembly, ensuring that one RNA dimer is packaged into each nascent virion. These studies shed light on the mechanism by which HIV-1 achieves efficient genome packaging during virus assembly. IMPORTANCE Retrovirus assembly is a well-choreographed event, during which many viral and cellular components come together to generate infectious virions. The viral RNA genome carries the genetic information to new host cells, providing instructions to generate new virions, and therefore is essential for virion infectivity. In this report, we show that the specific interaction of the viral RNA genome with the structural protein Gag facilitates virion assembly and particle production. These findings resolve the conundrum that HIV-1 RNA is selectively packaged into virions with high efficiency despite being dispensable for virion assembly\n\nCerebrospinal fluid HIV RNA in persons living with HIV.\n\nPubMed\n\nDi Carlofelice, M; Everitt, A; Muir, D; Winston, A\n\n2018-05-01\n\nDespite adequate suppression of plasma HIV RNA, viral escape in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is widely reported. Rates of CSF HIV RNA escape vary in the literature. In persons living with HIV (PLWH) undergoing lumbar puncture examination for clinical reasons, we assessed rates of CSF HIV RNA escape. Persons living with HIV attending a designated HIV neurology service undergoing CSF assessment for clinical reasons between January 2015 and April 2017 were included in the study. CSF HIV RNA escape was defined as HIV RNA â¥Â 0.5 log 10 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL higher than plasma HIV RNA or detectable CSF HIV RNA when plasma HIV RNA was <Â 20 copies/mL. Clinical factors associated with CSF HIV RNA were assessed using logistic regression modelling. Of 38 individuals, 35 were receiving antiretroviral therapy, 30 were male and their mean age was 51Â years. Clinical reasons for CSF assessment included investigation for cognitive decline (nÂ =Â 25), early syphilis (nÂ =Â 4) and other central nervous system (CNS) conditions (nÂ =Â 9). HIV RNA was detectable in plasma and CSF in seven and six individuals, respectively, with two individuals (5.3%) meeting the definition of CSF escape. Detectable CSF HIV RNA was associated with a detectable plasma HIV RNA (PÂ <Â 0.001) and a history of known antiretroviral drug resistance mutations (PÂ =Â 0.021). The prevalence of CSF viral escape in PLWH undergoing lumbar puncture examination for clinical reasons is lower than previously reported.

Interactions between Gag nucleocapsid (NC) and viral RNA (vRNA) are thought to drive assembly, but the exact roles of these interactions have remained poorly understood. Since previous studies have shown that Gag dimer- or trimer-forming mutants (Gag ZiL ) lacking an NC domain can form immature capsids independent of RNA binding, it is often hypothesized that vRNA drives Gag assembly by inducing Gag to form low-ordered multimers, but is dispensable for subsequent assembly. In this study, we examined the role of vRNA in HIV-1 assembly by characterizing the distribution and mobility of Gag and Gag NC mutants at the PM using photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) and single-particle tracking PALM (spt-PALM). We showed that both Gag and Gag ZiL assembly involve a similar basic assembly unit, as expected. Unexpectedly, the two proteins underwent different subsequent assembly pathways, with Gag cluster density increasing asymptotically, while Gag ZiL cluster density increased linearly. Additionally, the directed movement of Gag, but not Gag ZiL , was maintained at a constant speed, suggesting that the two proteins experience different external driving forces. Assembly was abolished when Gag was rendered monomeric by NC deletion. Collectively, these results suggest that, beyond inducing Gag to form low-ordered multimer basic assembly units, vRNA is essential in scaffolding and maintaining the stability of the subsequent assembly process. This finding should advance the current understanding of HIV-1 and, potentially, other retroviruses. Copyright Â© 2018 the Author(s).

The long form (tRNase ZL) can cleave a target RNA in vitro at the site directed by an appropriate small-guide RNA (sgRNA). Here, we investigated whether this sgRNA/tRNase ZL strategy could be applied to gene therapy for AIDS. We tested the ability of four sgRNA-expression plasmids to inhibit HIV-1 gene expression in COS cells, using a transient-expression assay. The three sgRNAs guide inhibition of HIV-1 gene expression in cultured COS cells. Analysis of the HIV-1 mRNA levels suggested that sgRNA directed the tRNase ZL to mediate the degradation of target RNA. The observation that sgRNA was localized primarily in nuclei suggests that tRNase ZL cleaves the HIV-1 mRNA when complexed with sgRNA in this location. We also examined the ability of two retroviral vectors expressing sgRNA to suppress HIV-1 expression in HIV-1-infected Jurkat T cells. sgRNA-SL4 suppressed HIV-1 expression almost completely in infected cells for up to 18 days. These results suggest that the sgRNA/tRNase ZL approach is effective in downregulating HIV-1 gene expression.

The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) exemplifies a large, multi-component host machinery that is required by HIV-1 for viral budding. ESCRT promotes the inward budding of vesicles from the membranes of late endosomes to generate multi-vesicular bodies. However, HIV-1 co-opts the ESCRT to enable outwards budding of virus particles from the plasma membrane, a phenomenon that is topologically similar to multi-vesicular body biogenesis. A role for ESCRTII in mRNA trafficking has been established in Drosophila in which the ESCRT-II components, Vps22 and Vps36, promote the localisation of the bicoid mRNA in the fertilised egg. This is achieved via specific interactions with the Staufen protein. In this work, we investigated a possible implication of ESCRT-II in the HIV-1 replication cycle. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses and live cell tri-molecular fluorescence complementation assays revealed that interactions between EAP30 and Gag and another between EAP30 and Staufen1 occur in mammalian cells. We then depleted EAP30 (the orthologue for Vps22) by siRNA to target ESCRT-II in HIV-1 expressing cells. This treatment disrupted ESCRT-II function and leads to the degradation of the two other ESCRT-II complex proteins, EAP45 and EAP20, as well as the associated Rab7-interacting lysosomal protein. The depletion of EAP30 led to dramatically reduced viral structural protein Gag and virus production levels, without any effect on viral RNA levels. On the contrary, the overexpression of EAP30 led to a several-fold increase in virus production. Unexpec-tedly, siRNA-mediated depletion of EAP30 led to a block to HIV-1 genomic RNA trafficking and resulted in the accumulation of genomic RNA in the nucleus and juxtanuclear domains. Our data provide the first evidence that the Staufen1-ESCRT-II interaction is evolutionarily conserved from lower to higher eukaryotes and reveal a novel role for\n\nComparative performance of the new Aptima HIV-1 Quant Dx assay with three commercial PCR-based HIV-1 RNA quantitation assays.\n\nPubMed\n\nHopkins, Mark; Hau, Sarah; Tiernan, Caroline; Papadimitropoulos, Athanasios; Chawla, Anu; Beloukas, Apostolos; Geretti, Anna Maria\n\n2015-08-01\n\nQuantitative measurement of HIV-1 RNA levels in plasma ('viral load') plays a central role in clinical management. The choice of assay platform can influence results and treatment decisions. To compare the analytical performance of the new TMA-based Hologic Aptima(Â®) HIV-1 Quant Dx assay with that of three PCR-based assays: Abbott RealTime HIV-1, Qiagen Artus(Â®) HI Virus-1 QS-RGQ, and Roche CAP/CTM HIV-1 Test v2. Assay performance was evaluated using Acrometrix HIV-1 RNA Standard panels; the 3rd WHO HIV-1 RNA International Standard (12-500 copies/ml; 6 dilutions; 9 replicates); and plasma samples from 191 HIV-positive patients. Aptima showed high (>0.99) precision, accuracy and concordance with the Acrometrix Standards across a wide dynamic range (2.0-6.7 log10copies/ml). Variance caused up to 2.1 (Aptima), 1.7 (RealTime), 7.5 (Artus), and 1.9 (CAP/CTM) fold changes in the International Standard quantifications at 50-500 copies/ml. HIV-1 RNA detection rates in plasma samples were 141/191 (74%), 119/191 (62%), 108/191 (57%), and 145/191 (76%) for Aptima, RealTime, Artus and CAP/CTM, respectively. For categorising samples either side of 50 copies/ml, Aptima had excellent agreement with RealTime (kappa 0.92; 95% CI 0.87-0.98); lowest agreement was with Artus (kappa 0.79; 95%CI 0.70-0.88). Aptima quantifications were mean 0.12 and 0.06 log10copies/ml higher compared with RealTime and CAP/CTM, respectively, and 0.05 log10copies/ml lower compared with Artus. Limits of agreement were narrowest when comparing Aptima to RealTime. The new Aptima HIV assay is sensitive, precise, and accurate. HIV assays exhibit discordance at low HIV-1 RNA copy numbers.

Multiple host and viral factors regulate LTR activity and modulate HIV-1 latency. Manipulation of the HIV-1 LTR provides a potential therapeutic strategy for combating HIV-1 persistence. In this study, we identified an RNA-/DNA-binding protein, Scaffold Attachment Factor B (SAFB1) as a host-cell factor that represses HIV-1 transcription. We found that SAFB1 bound to HIV-1 5`-LTR and significantly repressed 5`-LTR-driven-viral transcription and HIV-1 infection of CD4 + T cells. Mechanistically, SAFB1-mediated repression of HIV-1 transcription and infection was independent of its RNA- and DNA-binding capacities, instead, by binding to phosphorylated RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II), SAFB1 blocked its recruitment to the HIV-1 LTR. Of note, the SAFB1-mediated repression of HIV-1 transcription from proviral DNA maintained HIV-1 latency in CD4 + T cells. In summary, our findings reveal that SAFB1 binds to HIV-1-LTR and physically interacts with phosphorylated RNA pol II, repressing HIV-1 transcription initiation and elongation. Our findings improve the understanding of host modulation of HIV-1 transcription and latency and provide a new host-cell target for improved anti-HIV-1 therapies.

Uninterrupted administration of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in HIV-infected patients suppresses viral replication to below the detectable level and partially restores the immune system. However, cART-unresponsive residual HIV-1 infection and elusive transcriptionally silent but reactivatable viral reservoirs maintain a permanent viral DNA blue print. The virus rebounds within a few weeks after interruption of suppressive therapy. Adjunct gene therapy to control viral replication by ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi) is a post-transcriptional gene silencing strategy that could suppress residual HIV-1 burden and overcome viral resistance. Small interfering ribonucleic acids (siRNAs) are efficient transcriptional inhibitors, but need delivery systems to reach inside target cells. We investigated the potential of chimeric peptide (FP-PTD) to deliver specific siRNAs to HIV-1-susceptible and permissive cells. Chimeric FP-PTD peptide was designed with an RNA binding domain (PTD) to bind siRNA and a cell fusion peptide domain (FP) to enter cells. FP-PTD-siRNA complex entered and inhibited HIV-1 replication in susceptible cells, and could be a candidate for in vivo testing.\n\nExosomes Derived from HIV-1-infected Cells Contain Trans-activation Response Element RNA*\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNarayanan, Aarthi; Iordanskiy, Sergey; Das, Ravi; Van Duyne, Rachel; Santos, Steven; Jaworski, Elizabeth; Guendel, Irene; Sampey, Gavin; Dalby, Elizabeth; Iglesias-Ussel, Maria; Popratiloff, Anastas; Hakami, Ramin; Kehn-Hall, Kylene; Young, Mary; Subra, Caroline; Gilbert, Caroline; Bailey, Charles; Romerio, Fabio; Kashanchi, Fatah\n\n2013-01-01\n\nExosomes are nano-sized vesicles produced by healthy and virus-infected cells. Exosomes derived from infected cells have been shown to contain viral microRNAs (miRNAs). HIV-1 encodes its own miRNAs that regulate viral and host gene expression. The most abundant HIV-1-derived miRNA, first reported by us and later by others using deep sequencing, is the trans-activation response element (TAR) miRNA. In this study, we demonstrate the presence of TAR RNA in exosomes from cell culture supernatants of HIV-1-infected cells and patient sera. TAR miRNA was not in Ago2 complexes outside the exosomes but enclosed within the exosomes. We detected the host miRNA machinery proteins Dicer and Drosha in exosomes from infected cells. We report that transport of TAR RNA from the nucleus into exosomes is a CRM1 (chromosome region maintenance 1)-dependent active process. Prior exposure of naive cells to exosomes from infected cells increased susceptibility of the recipient cells to HIV-1 infection. Exosomal TAR RNA down-regulated apoptosis by lowering Bim and Cdk9 proteins in recipient cells. We found 104â106 copies/ml TAR RNA in exosomes derived from infected culture supernatants and 103 copies/ml TAR RNA in the serum exosomes of highly active antiretroviral therapy-treated patients or long term nonprogressors. Taken together, our experiments demonstrated that HIV-1-infected cells produced exosomes that are uniquely characterized by their proteomic and RNA profiles that may contribute to disease pathology in AIDS.

The effects of two precursor forms (cholecalciferol/calciol at 0.01, 1 and 100 nM and calcidiol at 100 and 250 nM) on HIV-1 infection, immune activation, and gene expression were analyzed in vitro in cells of Colombian and Italian healthy donors. We quantified levels of released p24 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, of intracellular p24 and cell-surface expression of CD38 and HLA-DR by flow cytometry, and mRNA expression of antiviral and immunoregulatory genes by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Cholecalciferol decreased the frequency of HIV-1-infected p24CD4 T cells and levels of p24 in supernatants in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the CD4CD38HLA-DR and CD4CD38HLA-DR subpopulations were more susceptible to infection but displayed the greatest cholecalciferol-induced decreases in infection rate by an X4-tropic strain. Likewise, cholecalciferol at its highest concentration decreased the frequency of CD38HLA-DR but not of CD38HLA-DR T-cell subsets. Analyzing the effects of calcidiol, the main VitD source for immune cells and an R5-tropic strain as the most frequently transmitted virus, a reduction in HIV-1 productive infection was also observed. In addition, an increase in mRNA expression of APOBEC3G and PI3 and a reduction of TRIM22 and CCR5 expression, this latter positively correlated with p24 levels, was noted. VitD reduces HIV-1 infection in T cells possibly by inducing antiviral gene expression, reducing the viral co-receptor CCR5 and, at least at the highest cholecalciferol concentration, by promoting an HIV-1-restrictive CD38HLA-DR immunophenotype.\n\nAdenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA-1 (ADAR1) Inhibits HIV-1 Replication in Human Alveolar Macrophages\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLevy, David N.; Li, Yonghua; Kumar, Rajnish; Burke, Sean A.; Dawson, Rodney; Hioe, Catarina E.; Borkowsky, William; Rom, William N.; Hoshino, Yoshihiko\n\n2014-01-01\n\nWhile exploring the effects of aerosol IFN-Î³ treatment in HIV-1/tuberculosis co-infected patients, we observed A to G mutations in HIV-1 envelope sequences derived from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of aerosol IFN-Î³-treated patients and induction of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) in the BAL cells. IFN-Î³ induced ADAR1 expression in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) but not T cells. ADAR1 siRNA knockdown induced HIV-1 expression in BAL cells of four HIV-1 infected patients on antiretroviral therapy. Similar results were obtained in MDM that were HIV-1 infected in vitro. Over-expression of ADAR1 in transformed macrophages inhibited HIV-1 viral replication but not viral transcription measured by nuclear run-on, suggesting that ADAR1 acts post-transcriptionally. The A to G hyper-mutation pattern observed in ADAR1 over-expressing cells in vitro was similar to that found in the lungs of HIV-1 infected patients treated with aerosol IFN-Î³ suggesting the model accurately represented alveolar macrophages. Together, these results indicate that ADAR1 restricts HIV-1 replication post-transcriptionally in macrophages harboring HIV-1 provirus. ADAR1 may therefore contribute to viral latency in macrophages.

The affinity and specificity of aminoglycoside binding to RNA can be increased through chemical modification, such as guanidinylation. Here, we report the binding of guanidinoneomycin B (GNB) to an RNA helix from the HIV-1 frameshift site. The binding of GNB increases the melting temperature (Tm) of the frameshift-site RNA by at least 10Â°8C, to a point at which a melting transition is not even observed in 2m urea. A structure of the complex was obtained by using multidimensional heteronuclear NMR spectroscopic methods. We also used a novel paramagnetic-probe assay to identify the site of GNB binding to the surface of the RNA. GNB makes major-groove contacts to two sets of WatsonâCrick bases and is in van der Waals contact with a highly structured ACAA tetraloop. Rings I and II of GNB fit into the major groove and form the binding interface with the RNA, whereas rings III and IV are exposed to the solvent and disordered. The binding of GNB causes a broadening of the major groove across the binding site.

HIV-1 derived small noncoding RNAs (sncRNAs) have been described in HIV-1 infected cells, but their biological functions still remain to be elucidated. Here, we approached the question whether viral sncRNAs may play a role in the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway or whether viral mRNAs are targeted by cellular miRNAs in human monocyte derived macrophages (MDM). The incorporation of viral sncRNAs and/or their target RNAs into RNA-induced silencing complex was investigated using photoactivatable ribonucleoside-induced cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) as well as high-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated by cross-linking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP), which capture Argonaute2-bound miRNAs and their target RNAs. HIV-1 infected monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) were chosen as target cells, as they have previously been shown to express HIV-1 sncRNAs. In addition, we applied small RNA deep sequencing to study differential cellular miRNA expression in HIV-1 infected versus non-infected MDMs. PAR-CLIP and HITS-CLIP data demonstrated the absence of HIV-1 RNAs in Ago2-RISC, although the presence of a multitude of HIV-1 sncRNAs in HIV-1 infected MDMs was confirmed by small RNA sequencing. Small RNA sequencing revealed that 1.4% of all sncRNAs were of HIV-1 origin. However, neither HIV-1 derived sncRNAs nor putative HIV-1 target sequences incorporated into Ago2-RISC were identified suggesting that HIV-1 sncRNAs are not involved in the canonical RNAi pathway nor is HIV-1 targeted by this pathway in HIV-1 infected macrophages.\n\nImpact of HIV type 1 subtype variation on viral RNA quantitation.\n\nPubMed\n\nParekh, B; Phillips, S; Granade, T C; Baggs, J; Hu, D J; Respess, R\n\n1999-01-20\n\nWe evaluated the performance of three HIV-1 RNA quantitation methods (Amplicor HIV-1 MONITOR-1.0, NASBA, and Quantiplex HIV RNA 2.0 [branched DNA (bDNA)]) using plasma specimens (N = 60) from individuals from Asia and Africa infected with one of three HIV-1 subtypes (A, Thai B [B'] or E; N = 20 each). Our results demonstrate that of the 20 subtype A specimens, 19 were quantifiable by the bDNA assay compared with 15 by the MONITOR-1.0 and 13 by NASBA. Of those quantifiable, the mean log10 difference was 0.93 between bDNA and MONITOR-1.0 and 0.46 between bDNA and NASBA. For subtype B' specimens, the correlation among methods was better with only 2 specimens missed by NASBA and 3 by the bDNA assay. However the missed specimens had viral burden near the lower limit (1000 copies/ml) for these assays. For the 20 subtype E specimens, MONITOR-1.0 and NASBA quantified RNA in 17 and 14 specimens, respectively, as compared with 19 specimens quantified by the bDNA assay. The correlation among different assays, especially between bDNA/NASBA and MONITOR-1.0/NASBA, was poor, although the mean log10 difference for subtype E specimens was 0.4 between bDNA and MONITOR-1.0 and only 0.08 between bDNA and NASBA. The addition of a new primer set, designed for non-B HIV-1 subtypes, to the existing MONITOR assay (MONITOR-1.0+) resulted in RNA detection in all 60 specimens and significantly improved the efficiency of quantitation for subtypes A and E. Our data indicate that HIV-1 subtype variation can have a major influence on viral load quantitation by different methods. Periodic evaluation and modification of these quantitative methods may be necessary to ensure reliable quantification of divergent viruses.\n\nMolecular mimicry of human tRNALys anti-codon domain by HIV-1 RNA genome facilitates tRNA primer annealing.\n\nPubMed\n\nJones, Christopher P; Saadatmand, Jenan; Kleiman, Lawrence; Musier-Forsyth, Karin\n\n2013-02-01\n\nThe primer for initiating reverse transcription in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is tRNA(Lys3). Host cell tRNA(Lys) is selectively packaged into HIV-1 through a specific interaction between the major tRNA(Lys)-binding protein, human lysyl-tRNA synthetase (hLysRS), and the viral proteins Gag and GagPol. Annealing of the tRNA primer onto the complementary primer-binding site (PBS) in viral RNA is mediated by the nucleocapsid domain of Gag. The mechanism by which tRNA(Lys3) is targeted to the PBS and released from hLysRS prior to annealing is unknown. Here, we show that hLysRS specifically binds to a tRNA anti-codon-like element (TLE) in the HIV-1 genome, which mimics the anti-codon loop of tRNA(Lys) and is located proximal to the PBS. Mutation of the U-rich sequence within the TLE attenuates binding of hLysRS in vitro and reduces the amount of annealed tRNA(Lys3) in virions. Thus, LysRS binds specifically to the TLE, which is part of a larger LysRS binding domain in the viral RNA that includes elements of the Psi packaging signal. Our results suggest that HIV-1 uses molecular mimicry of the anti-codon of tRNA(Lys) to increase the efficiency of tRNA(Lys3) annealing to viral RNA.\n\nRNA helicase A modulates translation of HIV-1 and infectivity of progeny virions\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBolinger, Cheryl; Sharma, Amit; Singh, Deepali; Yu, Lianbo; Boris-Lawrie, Kathleen\n\n2010-01-01\n\nRetroviruses rely on host RNA-binding proteins to modulate various steps in their replication. Previously several animal retroviruses were determined to mediate Dhx9/RNA helicase A (RHA) interaction with a 5â² terminal post-transcriptional control element (PCE) for efficient translation. Herein PCE reporter assays determined HTLV-1 and HIV-1 RU5 confer orientation-dependent PCE activity. The effect of Dhx9/RHA down-regulation and rescue with siRNA-resistant RHA on expression of HIV-1NL4â3 provirus determined that RHA is necessary for efficient HIV-1 RNA translation and requires ATPase-dependent helicase function. Quantitative analysis determined HIV-1 RNA steady-state and cytoplasmic accumulation were not reduced; rather the translational activity of viral RNA was reduced. Western blotting determined that RHA-deficient virions assemble with Lys-tRNA synthetase, exhibit processed reverse transcriptase and contain similar level of viral RNA, but they are poorly infectious on primary lymphocytes and HeLa cells. The results demonstrate RHA is an important host factor within the virus-producer cell and within the viral particle. The identification of RHA-dependent PCE activity in cellular junD RNA and in six of seven genera of Retroviridae suggests conservation of this translational control mechanism among vertebrates, and convergent evolution of Retroviridae to utilize this host mechanism.

The updated testing algorithm includes a qualitative HIV-1 RNA assay to resolve discordant immunoassay results and to identify acute HIV-1 infection (AHI). The qualitative HIV-1 RNA assay is not widely available; therefore, we evaluated the performance of a more widely available quantitative HIV-1 RNA assay, viral load, for diagnosing AHI. We determined that quantitative viral loads consistently distinguished AHI from a false-positive immunoassay result. Among 100 study participants with AHI and a viral load result, the estimated geometric mean viral load was 1,377,793copies/mL. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The analytical performance of this new assay was compared to the FDA-approved Abbott RealTime HIV-1 (RealTime). The evaluation was performed using 220 clinical plasma samples, the WHO 3rd HIV-1 International Standard, and the QCMD HIV-1 RNA EQA. Concordance on qualitative results, correlation between quantitative results, accuracy, and reproducibility of viral load data were analyzed. The ability to measure HIV-1 subtypes was assessed on the second WHO International Reference Preparation Panel for HIV-1 Subtypes. With clinical samples, inter-assay agreement for qualitative results was high (91.8%) with Cohen's kappa statistic equal to 0.836. For samples with quantitative results in both assays (nâ=â93), Lin's concordance correlation coefficient was 0.980 (Pâ<â0.0001) and mean differences of measurement, conducted according to Bland-Altman method, was low (0.115âlog10 âcopies/ml). The Aptima HIV quantified the WHO 3rd HIV-1 International Standard diluted from 2000 to 31âcp/ml (5,700-88âIU/ml) at expected values with excellent linearity (R(2) â>â0.970) and showed higher sensitivity compared to RealTime being able to detect HIV-1 RNA in 10 out of 10 replicates containing down to 7âcp/ml (20âIU/ml). Reproducibility was very high, even at low HIV-1 RNA values. The Aptima HIV was able to detect and accurately quantify all the main HIV-1 subtypes in both reference panels and clinical samples. Besides excellent performance, Aptima HIV shows full automation, ease of use, and improved workflow compared to RealTime. J. Med. Virol. 88:1535-1544, 2016. Â© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Quantitation across the assay dynamic ranges was assessed using serial fivefold dilutions of the viruses. In addition, sequences of gag-encoded p24 (gag p24), pol-encoded integrase, and env-encoded gp41 were analyzed to assign group and subtype and to assess nucleotide mismatches at primer and probe binding sites. For group M isolates, quantification was highly correlated among all three assays. In contrast, only the LCx HIV assay reliably quantified group O isolates. The bDNA v3.0 assay detected but consistently underquantified group O viruses, whereas the MONITOR v1.5 test failed to detect group O viruses. Analysis of target regions revealed fewer primer or probe mismatches in the LCx HIV assay than in the MONITOR v1.5 test. Consistent with the high level of nucleotide conservation is the ability of the LCx HIV assay to quantify efficiently human immunodeficiency virus type 1 group M and the genetically diverse group O.

Although PrP is conserved in vertebrates, its function remains to be identified. In vitro PrP binds large nucleic acids causing the formation of nucleoprotein complexes resembling human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) nucleocapsid-RNA complexes and in vivo MuLV replication accelerates the scrapie infectious process, suggesting possible interactions between retroviruses and PrP. Retroviruses, including HIV-1 encode a major nucleic acid binding protein (NC protein) found within the virus where 2000 NC protein molecules coat the dimeric genome. NC is required in virus assembly and infection to chaperone RNA dimerization and packaging and in proviral DNA synthesis by reverse transcriptase (RT). In HIV-1, 5'-leader RNA/NC interactions appear to control these viral processes. This prompted us to compare and contrast the interactions of human and ovine PrP and HIV-1 NCp7 with HIV-1 5'-leader RNA. Results show that PrP has properties characteristic of NCp7 with respect to viral RNA dimerization and proviral DNA synthesis by RT. The NC-like properties of huPrP map to the N-terminal region of huPrP. Interestingly, PrP localizes in the membrane and cytoplasm of PrP-expressing cells. These findings suggest that PrP is a multifunctional protein possibly participating in nucleic acid metabolism.\n\nDiscordant CSF/plasma HIV-1 RNA in individuals on virologically suppressive antiretroviral therapy in Western India.\n\nPubMed\n\nDravid, Ameet N; Natrajan, Kartik; Kulkarni, Milind M; Saraf, Chinmay K; Mahajan, Uma S; Kore, Sachin D; Rathod, Niranjan M; Mahajan, Umakant S; Wadia, Rustom S\n\n2018-02-01\n\nAim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/Plasma HIV-1 RNA discordance in virologically suppressed individuals presenting with incident neurologic symptoms.In this retrospective cohort study conducted between March 1, 2009, and March 1, 2017, HIV-1 infected adults exposed to atleast 12 months of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and having plasma viral load (VL) <1000âcopies/mL (virologically suppressed) were included. Among these, individuals presenting with neurologic symptoms during follow-up were assessed for CSF/Plasma HIV-1 RNA discordance by measuring HIV-1 RNA in collected plasma and CSF samples. CSF/plasma HIV-1 RNA discordance was defined as either detectable CSF HIV-1 RNA (VLâ>â20âcopies/mL) with an undetectable plasma RNA (complete viral suppression, VL â¤20âcopies/mL) or CSF HIV-1 RNAââ¥â0.5 log10 higher than plasma RNA when plasma VL was between 20 and 1000âcopies/mL (low-level viremia, LLV).Out of 1584 virologically suppressed patients, 71 (4.4%) presented with incident neurologic symptoms. Twenty out of 71 (28.2%) patients were diagnosed with CSF/Plasma HIV-1 discordance. Median plasma and CSF VL in patients with discordance was 120 [interquartile range (IQR): <20 to 332.5] and 4250 (IQR: 2550.0- 9615.0) copies/mL, respectively. All 9 individuals in which CSF HIV-1 genotypic resistance testing was done showed mutations that would compromise efficacy of prescribed ART regimen. Prevalence of CSF/plasma HIV-1 RNA discordance was higher among neurologically symptomatic patients with plasma LLV as compared with those with complete viral suppression (70% vs 11.8%, Pâ<â.001). The risk of discordance was also greater in patients who received protease inhibitor (PI) containing ART (Pâ<â.001) and those on ART regimens with central nervous system (CNS) penetration effectiveness (CPE) value <6 (Pâ=â.006).CSF/plasma HIV-1 RNA discordance indicates replication of HIV-1 that has adapted to the CNS or has\n\nPerformance Characteristics of the QUANTIPLEX HIV-1 RNA 3.0 Assay for Detection and Quantitation of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 RNA in Plasma\n\nPubMed Central\n\nErice, Alejo; Brambilla, Donald; Bremer, James; Jackson, J. Brooks; Kokka, Robert; Yen-Lieberman, Belinda; Coombs, Robert W.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nThe QUANTIPLEX HIV-1 RNA assay, version 3.0 (a branched DNA, version 3.0, assay [bDNA 3.0 assay]), was evaluated by analyzing spiked and clinical plasma samples and was compared with the AMPLICOR HIV-1 MONITOR Ultrasensitive (ultrasensitive reverse transcription-PCR [US-RT-PCR]) method. A panel of spiked plasma samples that contained 0 to 750,000 copies of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA per ml was tested four times in each of four laboratories (1,344 assays). Negative results (<50 copies/ml) were obtained in 30 of 32 (94%) assays with seronegative samples, 66 of 128 (52%) assays with HIV-1 RNA at 50 copies/ml, and 5 of 128 (4%) assays with HIV-1 RNA at 100 copies/ml. The assay was linear from 100 to 500,000 copies/ml. The within-run standard deviation (SD) of the log10 estimated HIV-1 RNA concentration was 0.08 at 1,000 to 500,000 copies/ml, increased below 1,000 copies/ml, and was 0.17 at 100 copies/ml. Between-run reproducibility at 100 to 500 copies/ml was <0.10 log10 in most comparisons. Interlaboratory differences across runs were â¤0.10 log10 at all concentrations examined. A subset of the panel (25 to 500 copies/ml) was also analyzed by the US-RT-PCR assay. The within-run SD varied inversely with the log10 HIV-1 RNA concentration but was higher than the SD for the bDNA 3.0 assay at all concentrations. Log-log regression analysis indicated that the two methods produced very similar estimates at 100 to 500 copies/ml. In parallel testing of clinical specimens with low HIV-1 RNA levels, 80 plasma samples with <50 copies/ml by the US-RT-PCR assay had <50 copies/ml when they were retested by the bDNA 3.0 assay. In contrast, 11 of 78 (14%) plasma samples with <50 copies/ml by the bDNA 3.0 assay had â¥50 copies/ml when they were retested by the US-RT-PCR assay (median, 86 copies/ml; range, 50 to 217 copies/ml). Estimation of bDNA 3.0 values of <50 copies/ml by extending the standard curve of the assay showed that these samples with discrepant\n\nComparative evaluation of the Aptima HIV-1 Quant Dx assay and COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 v2.0 assay using the Roche High Pure System for the quantification of HIV-1 RNA in plasma.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchalasta, Gunnar; BÃ¶rner, Anna; Speicher, Andrea; Enders, Martin\n\n2016-03-01\n\nQuantification of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA in plasma has become the standard of care in the management of HIV-infected patients. There are several commercially available assays that have been implemented for the detection of HIV-1 RNA in plasma. Here, the new Hologic AptimaÂ® HIV-1 Quant Dx assay (Aptima HIV) was compared to the Roche COBASÂ® TaqManÂ® HIV-1 Test v2.0 for use with the High Pure System (HPS/CTM). The performance characteristics of the assays were assessed using commercially available HIV reference panels, dilution of the WHO 3rd International HIV-1 RNA International Standard (WHO-IS) and plasma from clinical specimens. Assay performance was determined by linear regression, Deming correlation analysis and Bland-Altman analysis. Testing of HIV-1 reference panels revealed excellent agreement. The 61 clinical specimens quantified in both assays were linearly associated and strongly correlated. The Aptima HIV assay offers performance comparable to that of the HPS/CTM assay and, as it is run on a fully automated platform, a significantly improved workflow.\n\nA HIV-1 Tat mutant protein disrupts HIV-1 Rev function by targeting the DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX1.\n\nPubMed\n\nLin, Min-Hsuan; Sivakumaran, Haran; Jones, Alun; Li, Dongsheng; Harper, Callista; Wei, Ting; Jin, Hongping; Rustanti, Lina; Meunier, Frederic A; Spann, Kirsten; Harrich, David\n\n2014-12-14\n\nPreviously we described a transdominant negative mutant of the HIV-1 Tat protein, termed Nullbasic, that downregulated the steady state levels of unspliced and singly spliced viral mRNA, an activity caused by inhibition of HIV-1 Rev activity. Nullbasic also altered the subcellular localizations of Rev and other cellular proteins, including CRM1, B23 and C23 in a Rev-dependent manner, suggesting that Nullbasic may disrupt Rev function and trafficking by intervening with an unidentified component of the Rev nucleocytoplasmic transport complex. To seek a possible mechanism that could explain how Nullbasic inhibits Rev activity, we used a proteomics approach to identify host cellular proteins that interact with Nullbasic. Forty-six Nullbasic-binding proteins were identified by mass spectrometry including the DEAD-box RNA helicase, DDX1. To determine the effect of DDX1 on Nullbasic-mediated Rev activity, we performed cell-based immunoprecipitation assays, Rev reporter assays and bio-layer interferometry (BLI) assays. Interaction between DDX1 and Nullbasic was observed by co-immunoprecipitation of Nullbasic with endogenous DDX1 from cell lysates. BLI assays showed a direct interaction between Nullbasic and DDX1. Nullbasic affected DDX1 subcellular distribution in a Rev-independent manner. Interestingly overexpression of DDX1 in cells not only restored Rev-dependent mRNA export and gene expression in a Rev reporter assay but also partly reversed Nullbasic-induced Rev subcellular mislocalization. Moreover, HIV-1 wild type Tat co-immunoprecipitated with DDX1 and overexpression of Tat could rescue the unspliced viral mRNA levels inhibited by Nullbasic in HIV-1 expressing cells. Nullbasic was used to further define the complex mechanisms involved in the Rev-dependent nuclear export of the 9 kb and 4 kb viral RNAs. All together, these data indicate that DDX1 can be sequestered by Nullbasic leading to destabilization of the Rev nucleocytoplasmic transport complex and decreased\n\nHIV-1 Exploits a Dynamic Multi-aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetase Complex To Enhance Viral Replication.\n\nPubMed\n\nDuchon, Alice A; St Gelais, Corine; Titkemeier, Nathan; Hatterschide, Joshua; Wu, Li; Musier-Forsyth, Karin\n\n2017-11-01\n\nA hallmark of retroviruses such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is reverse transcription of genomic RNA to DNA, a process that is primed by cellular tRNAs. HIV-1 recruits human tRNA Lys3 to serve as the reverse transcription primer via an interaction between lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS) and the HIV-1 Gag polyprotein. LysRS is normally sequestered in a multi-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex (MSC). Previous studies demonstrated that components of the MSC can be mobilized in response to certain cellular stimuli, but how LysRS is redirected from the MSC to viral particles for packaging is unknown. Here, we show that upon HIV-1 infection, a free pool of non-MSC-associated LysRS is observed and partially relocalized to the nucleus. Heat inactivation of HIV-1 blocks nuclear localization of LysRS, but treatment with a reverse transcriptase inhibitor does not, suggesting that the trigger for relocalization occurs prior to reverse transcription. A reduction in HIV-1 infection is observed upon treatment with an inhibitor to mitogen-activated protein kinase that prevents phosphorylation of LysRS on Ser207, release of LysRS from the MSC, and nuclear localization. A phosphomimetic mutant of LysRS (S207D) that lacked the capability to aminoacylate tRNA Lys3 localized to the nucleus, rescued HIV-1 infectivity, and was packaged into virions. In contrast, a phosphoablative mutant (S207A) remained cytosolic and maintained full aminoacylation activity but failed to rescue infectivity and was not packaged. These findings suggest that HIV-1 takes advantage of the dynamic nature of the MSC to redirect and coopt cellular translation factors to enhance viral replication. IMPORTANCE Human tRNA Lys3 , the primer for reverse transcription, and LysRS are essential host factors packaged into HIV-1 virions. Previous studies found that tRNA Lys3 packaging depends on interactions between LysRS and HIV-1 Gag; however, many details regarding the mechanism of tRNA Lys3 and Lys\n\nDynamics of breast milk HIV-1 RNA with unilateral mastitis or abscess.\n\nPubMed\n\nSemrau, Katherine; Kuhn, Louise; Brooks, Daniel R; Cabral, Howard; Sinkala, Moses; Kankasa, Chipepo; Thea, Donald M; Aldrovandi, Grace M\n\n2013-03-01\n\nMastitis and abscess in HIV-infected women increase the risk of breastfeeding transmission of HIV. Guidelines encourage women to stop breastfeeding on the affected breast and feed on the contralateral breast. However, impact of breast pathology on breast milk HIV dynamics is unknown. HIV RNA was quantified in 211 breast milk samples collected before, during, and after a clinical mastitis or an abscess diagnosis from 38 HIV-infected women participating in a Zambian breastfeeding study. HIV RNA quantity was compared between affected and unaffected breasts over time using generalized estimating equation models. A sample of 115 women without breast pathology was selected as a control group. In the affected breast, breast milk HIV RNA quantity increased from the pre- to during-pathology period by log(10) 0.45 copies per milliliter [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.16 to 0.74], and after symptom resolution, HIV RNA levels were no different from prepathology levels (log10 -0.04 copies per milliliter 95% CI: -0.33 to 0.25). In the contralateral, unaffected breast, HIV RNA quantity did not significantly increase (log(10) 0.15 copies per milliliter, 95% CI: -0.41 to 0.10).

Guidelines encourage women to stop breastfeeding on the affected breast and feed on the contralateral breast. However, impact of breast pathology on breast milk HIV dynamics is unknown. Methods HIV RNA was quantified in 211 breast milk samples collected before, during and after a clinical mastitis or abscess diagnosis from 38 HIV-infected women participating in a Zambian breastfeeding study. HIV RNA quantity was compared between affected and unaffected breasts over time using generalized estimating equation models. A sample of 115 women without breast pathology was selected as a control group. Results In the affected breast, breast milk HIV RNA quantity increased from the pre- to during-pathology period by log10 0.45 copies/mL (95% CI: 0.16, 0.74) and after symptom resolution, HIV RNA levels were no different from pre-pathology levels (log10 -0.04 copies/mL 95%CI: -0.33, 0.25). In the contralateral unaffected breast, HIV RNA quantity did not significantly increase (log10 0.15 copies/mL, 95% CI: -0.41, 0.10). Increase was more marked in women with abscess or with a greater number of mastitis symptoms. HIV RNA was not significantly different between affected and unaffected women, except at the time of diagnosis. Conclusions Breast milk HIV RNA increased modestly in the affected breast with unilateral mastitis or abscess and returned to pre-pathology levels with symptom resolution. Contralateral HIV RNA was not affected. Results support guidelines encouraging feeding from the contralateral breast to minimize risk of HIV transmission associated with unilateral breast pathology.

However, only tropism testing of plasma HIV-1 has been validated as a tool to predict virological response to CCR5 antagonists in clinical trials. The preferable tropism testing strategy in subjects with undetectable HIV-1 viremia, in whom plasma tropism testing is not feasible, remains uncertain. We designed a proof-of-concept study including 30 chronically HIV-1-infected individuals who achieved HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL during at least 2 years after first-line ART initiation. First, we determined the diagnostic accuracy of 454 and population sequencing of gp120 V3-loops in plasma and PBMCs, as well as of MT-2 assays before ART initiation. The Enhanced Sensitivity Trofile Assay (ESTA) was used as the technical reference standard. 454 sequencing of plasma viruses provided the highest agreement with ESTA. The accuracy of 454 sequencing decreased in PBMCs due to reduced specificity. Population sequencing in plasma and PBMCs was slightly less accurate than plasma 454 sequencing, being less sensitive but more specific. MT-2 assays had low sensitivity but 100% specificity. Then, we used optimized 454 sequence data to investigate viral evolution in PBMCs during viremia suppression and only found evolution of R5 viruses in one subject. No de novo CXCR4-using HIV-1 production was observed over time. Finally, Slatkin-Maddison tests suggested that plasma and cell-associated V3 forms were sometimes compartmentalized. The absence of tropism shifts during viremia suppression suggests that, when available, testing of stored plasma samples is generally safe and informative, provided that HIV-1 suppression is maintained. Tropism testing in PBMCs may not necessarily produce equivalent biological results to plasma, because the structure of viral populations and the diagnostic performance of tropism assays may sometimes vary between compartments. Thereby, proviral DNA tropism testing\n\nRRE-dependent HIV-1 Env RNA effects on Gag protein expression, assembly and release\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLÃ³pez, Claudia S., E-mail: lopezcl@ohsu.edu; Sloan, Rachel; Cylinder, Isabel\n\nThe HIV-1 Gag proteins are translated from the full-length HIV-1 viral RNA (vRNA), whereas the envelope (Env) protein is translated from incompletely spliced Env mRNAs. Nuclear export of vRNAs and Env mRNAs is mediated by the Rev accessory protein which binds to the rev-responsive element (RRE) present on these RNAs. Evidence has shown there is a direct or indirect interaction between the Gag protein, and the cytoplasmic tail (CT) of the Env protein. Our current work shows that env gene expression impacts HIV-1 Gag expression and function in two ways. At the protein level, full-length Env expression altered Gag proteinmoreÂ Â» expression, while Env CT-deletion proteins did not. At the RNA level, RRE-containing Env mRNA expression reduced Gag expression, processing, and virus particle release from cells. Our results support models in which Gag is influenced by the Env CT, and Env mRNAs compete with vRNAs for nuclear export. - Highlights: â¢ At the protein level, full-length HIV-1 Env alters Gag protein expression. â¢ HIV-1 Env RNA expression reduces Gag levels and virus release. â¢ Env RNA effects on Gag are dependent on the RRE. â¢ RRE-containing Env RNAs compete with vRNAs for nuclear export.Â«Â less\n\nLong Noncoding RNA uc002yug.2 Activates HIV-1 Latency through Regulation of mRNA Levels of Various RUNX1 Isoforms and Increased Tat Expression.\n\nPubMed\n\nHuan, Chen; Li, Zhaolong; Ning, Shanshan; Wang, Hong; Yu, Xiao-Fang; Zhang, Wenyan\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe HIV-1 reservoir is a major obstacle to complete eradication of the virus. Although many proteins and RNAs have been characterized as regulators in HIV-1/AIDS pathogenesis and latency, only a few long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to be closely associated with HIV-1 replication and latency. In this study, we demonstrated that lncRNA uc002yug.2 plays a key role in HIV-1 replication and latency. uc002yug.2 potentially enhances HIV-1 replication, long terminal repeat (LTR) activity, and the activation of latent HIV-1 in both cell lines and CD4 + T cells from patients. Further investigation revealed that uc002yug.2 activates latent HIV-1 through downregulating RUNX1b and -1c and upregulating Tat protein expression. The accumulated evidence supports our model that the Tat protein has the key role in the uc002yug.2-mediated regulatory effect on HIV-1 reactivation. Moreover, uc002yug.2 showed an ability to activate HIV-1 similar to that of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate using latently infected cell models. These findings improve our understanding of lncRNA regulation of HIV-1 replication and latency, providing new insights into potential targeted therapeutic interventions. IMPORTANCE The latent viral reservoir is the primary obstacle to curing HIV-1 disease. To date, only a few lncRNAs, which play major roles in various biological processes, including viral infection, have been identified as regulators in HIV-1 latency. In this study, we demonstrated that lncRNA uc002yug.2 is important for both HIV-1 replication and activation of latent viruses. Moreover, uc002yug.2 was shown to activate latent HIV-1 through regulating alternative splicing of RUNX1 and increasing the expression of Tat protein. These findings highlight the potential merit of targeting lncRNA uc002yug.2 as an activating agent for latent HIV-1.
