        "text": "Trailokya Mohanaa Kavacha Sanskrit English Mahakala To Devi Solution To Problems\n\nAbout six months back a reader asked me to post the text of Trailokya Mohana Sundari Kavacha.\n\nAs is the case with me I found thecrelevant material but somehow\n\nnever got round posting as I got side tracked into writing on the Sananatana Dharma presence around the world and I have to verify the sloka.\n\nThis Kavacha is the solution for all the problems, emotional,spiritual,health issues, relief from the effects of Black Magic.\n\nThis also ensures the Blessings of Devi and directs one in the process of Self Realization.\n\nMay Lalitha Tripura Sundari Bless us all.\n\nI shall shortly begin on Tripura Sunadari.\n\nMy thanks to the sources listed towards the close of the article .\n\nThere are at least twenty Trailokya Mohana Kavachas,\n\nrelated to various Devatas like Ganesha, Vatukanatha, Tripura\n\nBhairavi, Kali,Tara, Bagalamukhi, Dakshinamurti, Bhuvaneshwari,\n\nVajravarahi and Sri\n\nMahatripurasundari.\n\nThere are three popular versions of Trailokyamohana Kavacha related\n\nto Sri Mahatripurasundari. The first one is from\n\nVamakeshwara Tantra.\n\nThe Phalasruti of this Kavacha mentions that by reciting this\n\nKavacha, one gains mastery over the mind and body and is blessed with\n\nthe state of Samadhi. This is an elaborate Kavacha which discusses\n\nthe ten Avaranas of Srichakra and its devatas.\n\nThe second version is from the Shodashi Khanda of Rudrayamala. This Kavacha is more popular with the Upasakas of Guhya Shodashi. There\n\ndoesn’t seem to be a printed version of this KavachaThis is from a copy of Sri Dattatreyanandantha, the disciple of Sri Karapatri Swamiji. This Kavacha lists 108 Srividya mantras and the\n\nsixteen avaranas of Srichakra. I am told that one edition of the Yati\n\nDanda Vidhana of Karapatri Swamiji carried this Kavacha. This\n\nKavacha, consisting of 532 Shlokas, assures Purashcharana Phala of\n\nall the 108 Srividya mantras to the person who recites the Kavacha.\n\nThe third version Trailokyamohana Kavacha is from the\n\nPanchami Khanda of the Rajarajeshwari Parishishtha of Rudrayamala.\n\nThis is the most popular among the three. This has been published by\n\nBrahmasri Chidanandanatha of Guhananda Mandali. This version\n\nhowever gives a different pAtha for some of the mantras like Panchami,\n\nPurna Shodashi etc., compared to the Sampradayika Pathas. Another version of the same Kavacha has been published with the Sampradayika\n\nPatha by Balamanorama Press which is available with many elderly Upasakas now.\n\nThis copy lists eighteen additional Shlokas. Several Srividya manuals\n\nin Tamil, Kananda, Malayalam and Devanagari have published this\n\nKavacha. This Kavacha again lists different Srividya mantras (32\n\ntypes I think) worshipped by various Upasakas like\n\nManu, Kubera etc.\n\nThe Phalasruti assures similar results as the previous one.\n\nThese three Kavachas also promise the Upasaka, the capability to\n\ninfatuate the three worlds. This could, in a spiritual sense mean mastery over the three Gunas, leading to the state of\n\nNirguna. All the three Kavachas warn the Upasaka of harmful results\n\nif Srividya mantra is recited without reciting these Kavachas. But this seems to be for the sake of conveying the importance of the\n\nKavacha. Whether\n\nthe recitation of these are mandatory or not is simply\n\ndecided based on the Guru’s Adesha. Quoting H H Sri Chandrashekhara\n\nBharati Mahaswamigal’s words, “chakrarAjArchanaM devyAH japo\n\nnAmnAm cha\n\nkIrtanaM.\n\nThese are the only mandatory duties for a Srividya Upasaka.\n\nThe remaining time, if any, should be spent in the study of Vedanta,\n\nso that the desired result of Srividyopasana – Chitta Shuddhi –\n\noccurs steadily. One need not spend time in various Stavas, Tantrik\n\npractices and Kavachas, if the goal is only Moksha.\n\nThe Upasaka should be clear of the fact that the Upasana is simply\n\nfor Chittashuddhi which qualifies one for Jnana and\n\nfurther for Moksha.”\n\nThis same quote may also be seen in Sri Sacchidananda Shivabhinava\n\nNrsimha Bharati Mahaswamigal’s biography by Sri Srikantha Shastrigal.\n\nThe same is also evident from the Uttara Pithika of\n\nSri Lalita Sahasranama Stotra.\n\nNumber of recitations and benefits as prescribed in Mahākālasaṁhitā: single recitation – all sins are destroyed; three times – long life; 100 times – all types of siddhis (superhuman powers); 1000 times – becomes messenger of Śiva; 10,000 times – one becomes Śiva. This mantra is capable of providing everything that is desired. It protects from extreme miseries, cures acute ailments, gives strong body, protects against enemies, protects from premature and unnatural deaths. It destroys all accrued sins. It is also capable of providing kingdom (richness). Mantra part of the kavaca consists of twenty verses, all in couplets, except the last one. There are thirty four Śakti-s (goddesses) mentioned in this mantra and they protect thirty four bodily parts. The mantra becomes extremely powerful because of the usage of multiple bīja-s. It is like Durgāsaptaśatī – pūrvabhāgaḥ (first chapter) – kavacam, but trailokayamohana rahasya kavaca vastly differs from Durgāsaptaśatī mainly because of the multiple and powerful bīja-s. To cap it all, this was told by Mahākālā to Devi.}\n\nTRILOKYAMOHANAKAVACAḤ –त्रिलोक्यमोहनकवचः\n\nअस्य श्री त्रैलोकयमोहन रहस्य कवचस्य ।\n\nasya śrī trailokayamohana rahasya kavacasya ।\n\nत्रिपुरारि

800 BC\n\nIndian History is so distorted and misinformation about Sanatana Dharma is so meticulous, it needs patient search among the Indian Texts to find out the truth.\n\nWell centuries of misinformation takes time to be dispelled away.\n\nPicture Of Eudoxus Of Cyzicus Silk Road\n\nImage credit. http://www.famous explorers .com\n\nI have written about the presence of Krishna ,Balarama, Shiva in ancient Greece much before the arrival of Alexander in India and the worship of these deities were present in ancient Greece.\n\nPlease read my articles on Krishna and Balarma being worshiped in Greece and Dionysus was Shiva.\n\nPillars of Hercules was dedicated to Krishna according to some researchers.\n\nMind you, this is not by an Indian but by a Foreigner.\n\nWe have a tendency to trust he sources from abroad than our own sources.\n\nThere is a fundamental difference in western approach to Knowledge when compared to Indian way of Knowledge.\n\nWhile the western axiom is ‘ex nihilo nihi fit’- out of nothing nothing comes, while Indian Thinkers follow the dictum ‘Out of Fullness comes Full,having the Full from Full, the Full remains Full.\n\n‘Om Poornasya Poornamitham…Vasisyathi’\n\nI shall write on this later.\n\nThe Renaissance as the west have it is from Greece.\n\nAll knowledge flowed from Greece.\n\nIf you read western Philosophy it would start from Socrates followed by Plato And Aristotle.\n\nHistory from Thucydides.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nLet us have a look at Pythagoras Theorem.\n\n,\n\nIn mathematics, the Pythagorean theorem, also known as Pythagoras’ theorem, is a fundamental relation in Euclidean geometry among the three sides of a right triangle. It states that the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. The theorem can be written as an equation relating the lengths of the sides a, b andc, often called the “Pythagorean equation”:[1]\n\nwhere c represents the length of the hypotenuse and a and b the lengths of the triangle’s other two sides.\n\nAlthough it is often argued that knowledge of the theorem predates him,[2] the theorem is named after the ancient Greekmathematician Pythagoras (c. 570 – c. 495 BC) as it is he who, by tradition, is credited with its first recorded proof.[3][4][5] There is some evidence that Babylonian mathematicians understood the formula, although little of it indicates an application within a mathematical framework.[6][7] Mesopotamian, Indian and Chinese mathematicians all discovered the theorem independently and, in some cases, provided proofs for special cases.\n\nThe theorem has been given numerous proofs – possibly the most for any mathematical theorem. They are very diverse, including both geometric proofs and algebraic proofs, with some dating back thousands of years. The theorem can be generalized in various ways, including higher-dimensional spaces, to spaces that are not Euclidean, to objects that are not right triangles, and indeed, to objects that are not triangles at all, but n-dimensional solids. The Pythagorean theorem has attracted interest outside mathematics as a symbol of mathematical abstruseness, mystique, or intellectual power; popular references in literature, plays, musicals, songs, stamps and cartoons abound.,\n\nMesopotamia was a part of Indian Empire and the ancient religion of China was Sanatna Dharma.\n\n,\n\nThe earliest mathematician to whom definite teachings can be ascribed was Lagadha, who apparently lived about 1300 BC and used geometry and elementary trigonometry for his astronomy. Baudhayana lived about 800 BC and also wrote on algebra and geometry; Yajnavalkya lived about the same time and is credited with the then-best approximation to π. Apastambha did work summarized below; other early Vedic mathematicians solved quadratic and simultaneous equations.Other early cultures also developed some mathematics. The ancient Mayans apparently had a place-value system with zero already seen in Vedas before them and later known to the world by great Aryabhatt; Aztec architecture implies practical geometry skills. Ancient China certainly developed mathematics, though little written evidence survives prior to Chang Tshang’s famous book. Chang Tshang before writing book, gained great Vedic wisdom when he arrived in India.\n\nThe Dharmasutra composed by Apastambha (ca 630-560 BC) from India contains mensuration techniques, novel geometric construction techniques, a method of elementary algebra, and what may be the first known proof after 800 BC of Sulbha Sutra which form the basis of plagiarized version better known as Pythagorean Theorem. Apastambha’s work uses the excellent (continued fraction) approximation √2 ≈ 577/408, a result probably derived with a geometric argument.\n\nApastambha built on the work of earlier Vedic scholars, especially Baudhayana, as well as Harappan and (probably) Mesopotamian mathematicians. His notation and proofs were made primitive by westerners, and there is little certainty about his life. However similar comments apply to Thales of Miletus, so it seems fair to mention Apastambha (who was perhaps the most creative Vedic mathematician before Panini) along with Thales as one of the earliest mathematicians whose name is known…\n\nEudoxus of Cyzicus us an ancient Greek explorer and sea navigator that is remembered by historical writings as one of the first sailors who managed to make successful trips between Arabian and Indian ports, explore Arabian Sea under contract from Ptolemy VIII king, the Hellenistic Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt, and for his 2nd century BC attempt to circumnavigate the continent of Africa.\n\n‘Eudoxus was the first great mathematical astronomer; he developed the complicated ancient theory of planetary orbits; and may have invented the astrolabe. (It is sometimes said that he knew that the Earth rotates around the Sun, but that appears to be false; it is instead Aristarchus of Samos, as cited by Archimedes, who may be the first “heliocentrist.”)\n\nEudoxus completely relied on Vedic principles and Hindu meditation practices for his inventions. As it happened with most of the copy cats, some of his papers were mocked by next generation of mathematicians as they found flaws in mis-translations of Vedic texts done by Eudoxus.\n\nFour of Eudoxus’ most famous discoveries were the volume of a cone, extension of arithmetic to the irrationals, summing formula for geometric series, and viewing π as the limit of polygonal perimeters. None of these seems difficult today, but it does seem remarkable that they were all first achieved by the same man, due to his access to Vedas. As seen in most of the sutras in Vedas, where Sun and Moon were quoted as eyes of Lord Krishna. And how important it is for Sun and Moon to exist for the existence of human race is explained in detailed manner. Following the same principle, Eudoxus was too much impressed with the natural gifts of Lord Krishna given to mankind and he has been quoted as saying “Willingly would I burn to death like Phaeton, were this the price for reaching the sun and learning its shape, its size and its substance.”\n\nLong before Eudoxus’ – In the valley of the Indus River of India, the world’s oldest civilization had developed its own system of mathematics. The Vedic Shulba Sutras (fifth to eighth century B.C.E.), meaning “codes of the rope,” show that the earliest geometrical and mathematical investigations among the Indians arose from certain requirements of their religious rituals. When the poetic vision of the Vedic seers was externalized in symbols, rituals requiring altars and precise measurement became manifest, providing a means to the attainment of the unmanifest world of consciousness. “Shulba Sutras” is the name given to those portions or supplements of the Kalpasutras, which deal with the measurement and construction of the different altars or arenas for religious rites. The word Shulba refers to the ropes used to make these measurements’\n\nShulbha Sutra and Pythogoras Theorem.\n\nThe similarity between Shulbha Sutra and Pythogoras\n\nThe diagonal chord of the rectangle makes both the squares that the horizontal and vertical sides make separately.\n\n— Sulba Sutra\n\n(8th century B.C.)\n\nCompare.\n\nThe square of the hypotenuse of a right angle triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\n\n— Pythagorean Theorem\n\n(6th century B.C.)\n\nIt is also referred to as Baudhayana theorem. The most notable of the rules (the Sulbasūtra-s do not contain any proofs for the rules which they describe, since they are sūtra-s, formulae, concise) in the Baudhāyana Sulba Sūtra says:\n\nदीर्घचतुरश्रस्याक्ष्णया रज्जु: पार्श्र्वमानी तिर्यग् मानी च यत् पृथग् भूते कुरूतस्तदुभयं करोति ॥\n\ndīrghachatursrasyākṣaṇayā rajjuḥ pārśvamānī, tiryagmānī,\n\ncha yatpṛthagbhūte kurutastadubhayāṅ karoti.\n\nA rope stretched along the length of the diagonal produces an area which the vertical and horizontal sides make together.\n\nA proof of the theorem by Bodhayana.\n\nCircling the square\n\nAnother problem tackled by Baudhāyana is that of finding a circle whose area is the same as that of a square (the reverse of squaring the circle). His sūtra i.58 gives this construction:\n\nDraw half its diagonal about the centre towards the East-West line; then describe a circle together with a third part of that which lies outside the square.\n\nExplanation:\n\nDraw the half-diagonal of the square, which is larger than the half-side by .\n\nThen draw a circle with radius , or , which equals .\n\nNow , so the area .\n\nSquare root of 2.\n\nBaudhāyana i.61-2 (elaborated in Āpastamba Sulbasūtra i.6) gives the length of the diagonal of a square in terms of its sides, which is equivalent to a formula for the square root of 2:\n\nsamasya dvikaraṇī. pramāṇaṃ tṛtīyena vardhayet\n\ntac caturthenātmacatustriṃśonena saviśeṣaḥ\n\nThe diagonal [lit. “doubler”] of a square. The measure is to be increased by a third and by a fourth decreased by the 34th. That is its diagonal approximately.[citation needed]\n\nThat is,\n\nwhich is correct to five decimals.[8]\n\nOther theorems include: diagonals of rectangle bisect each other, diagonals of rhombus bisect at right angles, area of a square formed by joining the middle points of a square is half of original, the midpoints of a rectangle joined forms a rhombus whose area is half the rectangle, etc.\n\nNote the emphasis on rectangles and squares; this arises from the need to specify yajña bhūmikās—i.e. the altar on which a rituals were conducted, including fire offerings (yajña).\n\nThese Indian texts form Kalpla Sutras.\n\nCitations and references.\n\nhttp://haribhakt.com/modern-inventions-stolen-from-vedas/#Likes_of_Pythogoras_and_Archimedes_Lifted_theories_of_Ancient_Hindu_Scientists_and_Mathematicians\n\nhttp://www.famous-explorers.com/explorers-by-time-period/eudoxus-of-cyzicus/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baudhayana_sutras\n\nFiled under: Hinduism Tagged: Apasthamba Sutra, Bodhayana, Euclidean geometry, Hypotenuse, Indian mathematics, Kalpa Sutras, Mathematics, Pythagoras, Pythagoras' theorem, Theory of Numbers\n\n↧\n\nIndian Script Began in 3012 BC Beginning Of Kali Yuga\n\nApart from wondering about the treasure trove of Hinduism which opens the doors to Wisdom,Knowledge, Information and Spirituality, one thing has been nagging my mind.\n\nThere are thirty million manuscripts 700 poetic meters in Sanskrit.\n\nhttps://ramanan50.wordpress.com/2015/02/04/thirty-million-manuscripts-700-poetic-meters-amazing-sanskrit/\n\nand you have the Vedas.\n\n‘The Vedic literature is composed of many books.\n\nThe oldest texts are the Rig-veda, Yajur-veda, Sama-veda, and the Atharva-veda. It is said in the Muktikopanishad that these four Vedas had 21, 109, 1000, and 50 branches respectively, with over 100,000 verses. Now, however, we can only find around 20,023 (some say 20,379) verses in total from these four Vedas.\n\nIt is the oldest book in any Indo-European language and contains the earliest form of all Sanskrit mantras that date back to 1500 B.C. – 1000 B.C. Some scholars date the Rig Veda as early as 12000 BC – 4000 B.C\n\nhttps://ramanan50.wordpress.com/2013/08/16/rig-veda-date-components-details/\n\nIt is well known that the Hindu Texts were transmitted orally.\n\nTrue.\n\nEven today one can see the Vedas being transmitted orally in India.\n\nI am amazed at the sheer volume being transmitted only by Oral tradition.\n\nIt is enjoined in the Vedas that one has to study the Vedas from a Guru for Twelve Years.\n\nEven this can be one Shaka, a portion of a Specific Veda that is assigned to one by tradition.\n\nHow come all the verses, well most of them, are available today?\n\nOnly by Oral tradition?\n\nWithout recourse to any form of writing?\n\nWell let me leave this for the present.\n\nBut writing must have been in vogue during the Ramayana and Mahabharata Period.\n\nWe have instances of Kings sending emissaries with written Communication ‘Nirupam’\n\nSita’s Swayamwara, Damayanti Swayamvara, Draupadis Swayamvara have been communicated to all the Kings of India, then 56 in number.\n\nAnd these messages traveled from Ayodhya to Madurai and the present Kerala, to Pandyan and Chera kings respectively.\n\nThe messages as Nirupam implies a language, script.\n\nResting aside the controversy about the common language, which I shall address later, the accepted early script is Brahmi.\n\nAgain there is Tamil Brahmi, Sanskrit Brahmi, Kannada Brahmi.\n\nTamil Brahmi is found in the Harappan Civilization.\n\nTwo million year old Rock carving dating to Million years was found in Karnataka.\n\nEarliest Brahmi script is assigned a date of 2600 BC\n\n‘The first Indian script, developed in the Indus Valley around 2600 B.C. is still undeciphered. Thus, it is still not possible to fully understand this civilization, as we have no readable records of their beliefs, history, rulers or literature’\n\n‘The Indus valley findings made Indologists acknowledge that writing existed prior to Mauryan writing. Though it has not been deciphered , it clearly shows writing existed in India before atlest 5-2 milliena before christ. Some Indology scholars have tried to show Indus script is derived from script from another civilization. But all these theories have fallen flat. Hrozny tried to derive Indus script from Hittite, Diringer is convinced that no script existed prior to Indus script from which Indus scirpt can be derived. Hunter and Langdon regard Indus script as prototype of Brahmi. The Vedic Scholars believed that Brahmi is from Brahma. It is mentioned in Narada Smriti that if Brahma has not created the art of writing or given excellant eye in the shape of script, the future would not have been deprived of obtaining bright future.\n\nThe Absence of inscriptions since Indus valley is due to widespread use of Paper and Cloth, which are perishable in nature…\n\n‘Alberuni believes Indian Alphabet originated with the begining of Kali Age (3102BC).\n\nHiuen Tsang speaks of high Antiquity of Indian writing system. Brahmi is stated, in the Chinese Encyclopedia Fa-Wan-Shu-Lin, to be the best of scripts.’\n\n‘\n\nOne of the first great civilizations–with a writing system, urban centers, and a diversified social and economic system–appeared around 3,000 B.C. along the Indus River valley in Punjab and Sindh.\n\nhttp://www.ancient.eu/article/294/\n\nI agree with Alberuni the Chinese ancient .eu ,taking into account the dates of Ramayana and Mahabharata and of course the Vedas.\n\nSources.\n\nA Concise History Of Classical Sanskrit Literature By Gaurinath Shastri, Bhattacharyya Shastri Gaurinath\n\nThe rise, decline and renewals of sramanic religious traditions within indic civilisation with particular reference to the evolution of jain sramanic culture and its impact on the indic civilization by Bal patil\n\nStudents’ Britannica India, Volumes 1-5 By Indu Ramchandani\n\nA Companion to Sanskrit Literature: Spanning a Period of Over Three Thousand … By Sures Chandra Banerji\n\nOn the origin Indian Brahma Alphabet Georg Buhler\n\nWas Writing Know Before Panini by A Chela\n\nAgama Aura Tripitaka, Eka Anusilana: Language and Literature By Nagraj (Muni.)\n\nCitations.\n\nhttp://www.ancientindia.co.uk/writing/home_set.html\n\nhttp://controversialhistory.blogspot.in/search/label/sanskrit\n\nhttp://www.stephen-knapp.com/complete_review_of_vedic_literature.htm\n\nRamani’s Blog\n\nFiled under: Hinduism Tagged: Brahmi, Brahmi script, Hinduism, Indian script beginning, Indian Script date, Language, Mahabharata, Ramayana, Sanatana Dharma, sanskrit, Vedas\n\n↧\n\nLove Letter To Lord Krishna Bhagavatham Guruvayauappan Confirms\n\nThe sheer love of God expressed in Hinduism is amazing .\n\nThe texts of the Hindus, The Vedas do not advocate Idol worship.\n\nBut it is sanctioned as a tool for realizing the Self.\n\nFor more on this please refer my Post on Hinduism Has Many Gods, Yes and No.\n\nGod is treated as a child, Mother, Father, Friend , Lover….\n\nBut in the case of Lord Krishna, whose existence is proved it is different.\n\nHe married Rukmini.\n\nRukmini expressed her Love for Krishna through a Love Letter and this is found in the Bhagavatham.\n\nAuthor of the Text is Vyasa!\n\nThere was a difference of opinion as to whether the letter was in the Bhagavatham.\n\nThis was resolved by Krishna from His Temple in Guruvayur!\n\n‘In Bhagavatham, nowhere there is any indication that Rukmini sent a letter to Krishna..She only sent a brahmin as emissary with the above message.\n\nBut then there is an interesting story behind the theory that there was a letter. It concerns the celebrated devotee of Guruvayurappan, Poonthanam Nambuthiri. It is heard that Poonthanam, though an ardent devotee of Guruvayurappan, was not a scholar in Sankrit by any standards. However in his great devotion to Guruvayurappan, he used to narrate the story of Bhagavatham in the temple precincts at Guruvayur.. As an innocent remark, Poonthanam once stated during his narration that Rukmini sent a letter with the above message to Krishna through the brahmin. An intolerant brahmin scholar, intent on humiliating Poonthanam in pulic, raised the issue as to where it was written in Bhagavatham that there was a letter.Then there came the voice of Guruvayurappan from His Sreekovil..\n\n” Is it said in Bhagavatham that there is no such letter? I know there was a letter because I sent it”\n\nThis episode is narrated vividly in the Aitihyamala of Kottarathil Sankunni.\n\n(chapter 45 –Poonthanathu Namboothiree)\n\nश्रुत्वा गुणान्‌ भुवनसुन्दर शृण्वतां ते\n\nनिर्विश्य कर्णविवरैर्हरतोऽङ्गतापं।\n\nरूपं दृशं दृशिमतां अखिलार्थलाभं\n\nत्वय्यच्युताविशति चित्तमपत्रपं मे॥१\n\nśrutvā guṇān bhuvanasundara śṛṇvatāṁ te\n\nnirviśya karṇavivarairharato’ṅgatāpaṁ|\n\nrūpaṁ dṛśaṁ dṛśimatāṁ akhilārthalābhaṁ\n\ntvayyacyutāviśati cittamapatrapaṁ me||1\n\nका त्वा मुकुन्द महती कुलशीलरूप\n\nविद्यावयोद्रविणदामभिरात्मतुल्यं।\n\nधीरा पतिं कुलवती न वृणीत कन्या\n\nकाले नृसिंह नरलोकमनोऽभिरामं॥२\n\nkā tvā mukunda mahatī kulaśīlarūpa\n\nvidyāvayodraviṇadāmabhirātmatulyaṁ|\n\ndhīrā patiṁ kulavatī na vṛṇīta kanyā\n\nkāle nṛsiṁha naralokamano’bhirāmaṁ||2\n\nतन्मे भवान्‌ खलु वृतः पतिरङ्ग जाया-\n\nमात्मार्पितश्च भवतोऽत्र विभो विधेहि।\n\nमा वीरभागमभिमर्शतु चैद्य आरात्-\n\nगोमायुवद्‌ मृगपतेर्बलिमंबुजाक्ष॥३\n\ntanme bhavān khalu vṛtaḥ patiraṅga jāyā-\n\nmātmārpitaśca bhavato’tra vibho vidhehi|\n\nmā vīrabhāgamabhimarśatu caidya ārat-\n\ngomāyuvad mṛgapaterbalimaṁbujākṣa||3\n\nपूर्तेष्टदत्तनियमव्रतदेवविप्र-\n\nगुर्वर्च्चनादिभिरलं भगवान्‌ परेशः।\n\nआराधितो यदि गदाग्रज एत्य पाणिं\n\nगृह्ण्णातु मे न दमघोषसुतादयोऽन्न्ये॥४\n\npūrteṣṭadattaniyamavratadevavipra-\n\ngurvarccanādibhiralaṁ bhagavān pareśaḥ|\n\nārādhito yadi gadāgraja etya pāṇiṁ\n\ngṛhṇṇātu me na damaghoṣasutādayo’nnye||4\n\nश्वोभाविनि त्वमजितोद्वहने विदर्भान्\n\nगुप्तः समेत्य पृतनपतिभिः परीतः।\n\nनिर्म्मथ्य चैद्यमगधेन्द्रबलं प्रसह्य\n\nमां राक्षसेन विधिनोद्वह वीर्यशुल्कां॥५\n\nśvobhāvini tvamajitodvahane vidarbhān\n\nguptaḥ sametya pṛtanapatibhiḥ parītaḥ|\n\nnirmmathya caidyamagadhendrabalaṁ prasahya\n\nmāṁ rākṣasena vidhinodvaha vīryaśulkāṁ||5\n\nअन्तःपुरान्तरचरीमनिहत्य बन्धुं\n\nस्त्वामुद्वहे कथमिति प्रवदाम्युपायं।\n\nपूर्वेद्युरस्ति महती कुलदेवियात्रा\n\nयस्यां बहिर्न्नवावधूर्ग्गिरिजामुपेयात्॥६\n\nantaḥpurāntaracarīmanihatya bandhuṁ\n\nstvāmudvahe kathamiti pravadāmyupāyaṁ|\n\npūrvedyurasti mahatī kuladeviyātrā\n\nyasyāṁ bahirnnavāvadhūrggirijāmupeyāt||6\n\nयस्याङ्घ्रिपङ्कजरजस्नपनं महान्तो\n\nवाञ्चन्त्युमापतिरिव्वत्मतमोपहत्यै\n\nयर्ह्यम्बुजाक्ष न लभेय भवत्प्रादं\n\nजह्यामसून् व्रतकृशान् शतजन्मभिः स्यात्॥७\n\nyasyāṅghripaṅkajarajasnapanaṁ mahānto\n\nvāñcantyumāpatirivvatmatamopahatyai\n\nyarhyambujākṣa na labheya bhavatprādaṁ\n\njahyāmasūn vratakṛśān śatajanmabhiḥ syāt||7\n\n(Srimad Bhagavatamahapuranam Dashamaskanadm\n\nChapter\n\n52–slokas 37 to 43)\n\n( free translation avoiding technicalities to the extent possible) is given below)\n\nKrishna, you are the most attractive person in the whole\n\nuniverse, and having listened to your glories which enter one’s\n\nthought through the ears and destroys all woes of the body and\n\nmind, and Oh Achyutha, my shameless mind dwells upon you\n\nincapable of being wrenched away from your beautiful form\n\nwhich is the ultimate thing for anyone to set his eyes upon and\n\nthat form bestows on all eternal fortune.\n\nOh Mukunda, which girl , who has some strength of mind, who\n\nis born of high family , and in at least some way comparable to\n\nyou in upbringing, character beauty, education ,age, wealth\n\nand status would not simply woo you by mind, you who looks\n\nlike a lion in human form (you were once Narasaimha) and\n\nwho is simply enchanting to the minds of all the living beings\n\nin this world.\n\nTherefore, you please accept me who has by my own will\n\naccepted you as my husband in mind and has simply placed my\n\nbody and soul at your lotus feet, as you are the granter of all\n\nboons.

Historians that I am a Right Historian!\n\nI am neither.\n\nI am, probably one who writes what is Right.\n\nThere is glorification of Tyrants like Aurangzeb and Tippu Sultan\n\nAurangzeb is portrayed as a Pious Man,\n\nOf what use Piety is if you kill your brothers and torture your Father?\n\nTipu Sultan is being projected ad the savior of Hindus , is being celebrated as the Tiger of Mysore and that he donated Shiva Linga to Sringeri Mutt and saved it from the British.\n\nHe defended his fiefdom, nothing more.\n\nOn his gifting Shiv Linga to Sringeri Mutt.Please refer my post on this.\n\nHe plundered Hindu temples and destroyed them.\n\nI have provided a list of temples destroyed by him.\n\nNot only this.\n\nHe forcibly circumcised Hindus and made Brahmins eat Beef!\n\n‘In the aftermath of the 1780 Battle of Pollilur, 7,000 British soldiers were held imprisoned by Haidar Ali and Tipu Sultan in the fortress of Seringapatnam. Of these, more than 300 were forcibly circumcised. Cromwell Massey, who kept a secret diary during his captivity, wrote: “I lost with the foreskin of my yard all those benefits of a Christian and Englishman which were and ever shall be my greatest glory.” Adolescent captives were, in addition to being circumcised, made to wear female clothes. James Bristow, a teenage artilleryman, revenged himself by circumcising dogs, believing that this would harm the religious feelings of the Muslim warders. The prospect of punishment did not deter him, because “compelling us to undergo an abhorred operation [was] so base and barbarous an act of aggression, that it was impossible to reflect on it with temper.”James Scurry, also a prisoner of war, confirms in his book, The Captivity, Sufferings, and Escape of James Scurry (1824), that English soldiers, Mangalorean Catholics, and other prisoners were forcibly circumcised.[31] In 1784, when Tipu returned fromMangalore, he brought back tens of thousands of Mangalorean Catholics from Kanara and subjected them to forced circumcision. A Hindi idiom ‘Mar-mar ke Musalman bana’ (meaning ‘make Muslim by repeated beating’) can be traced to originate from forcible conversion of Hindus.”\n\nAccording to the official report of Col. Fullarton of the British forces stationed in Mangalore, “(During the siege 1783) Tipu’s soldiers daily exposed the heads of many innocent Brahmins within sight from the fort for Zamorin and his Hindu followers to see. It is asserted that the Zamorin rather than witness such enormities and to avoid further killing of innocent Brahmins, chose to abandon the Palghat Fort” Further he states- “It was not only against the Brahmins who were thus put in a state of terror of forcible circumcision and conversion; but against all sections of Hindus. In August, 1788, a Raja of the Kshatriya family of Parappanad and also Trichera Thiruppad, a chieftain of Nilamboor, and many other Hindu nobles who had been carried away earlier to Coimbatore by Tipu Sultan, were forcibly circumcised and forced to eat beef.” an anti-Vedic practice as Hindus consider Cow as Holy Mother for her selfless contribution to the world and humans.\n\nGenocide of Hindus by Brutal Tipu Sultan\n\nThe world-famous Protuguese traveller, Fr. Barthoelomeo, writes in his book Voyage to East Indies : “Tipu was riding on an elephant behind which another army of 30,000 soldiers followed. Most of the men and women were hanged in Calicut, first mothers were hanged with their children tied to necks of mothers. That barbarian Tipu Sultan tied the naked Christians and Hindus to the legs of elephants and made the elephants to move around till the bodies of the helpless victims were torn to pieces. Temples and churches were ordered to be burned down, desecrated and destroyed. Christian and Hindu women were forced to marry (mlecchas) mohammadans and similarly their men (after converting Hindu men into Islam) were forced to marry mohammadan women. Those Hindus, Christians who refused to be honoured with Islam, were ordered to be killed by hanging immediately.”\n\nCitation and references.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_circumcision#South_Asia\n\nhttp://haribhakt.com/terrorist-tipu-sultan-was-barbarian-cruel-and-brutal-ruler-murderer-of-millions-of-south-indian-hindus/\n\nTipu Sultans persecution of Hindus in his words\n\nTemples destroyed by Tipu Sultan\n\nFiled under: Hinduism Tagged: Battle of Pollilur, Genocide Of Hundus, Mysore King, Srirangapatna, Srnigeri Mutt, Tipu and circumcision, Tipu Sultan\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nCorruption In India Reason Hinduism?Hindu Baiting\n\nI was informed by a friend of mine that he is deluged with a forward quoting an article in tennews that Corruption in India is because of Hindu culture, its religion and worship practices.\n\nThe article bases its conclusions on the practice of people offering to God in Temples for favors received, instances where those closest to Kings betrayed the King for Money and that a Politician, J.Jayalalithaa, the present Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu coming back to power despite corruption charges.\n\nNo doubt Corruption is a serious virus and has to be eradicated in full.\n\nI thought initially that this article in question is a well meaning one.\n\nBut I find that corruption is used as a tool to denigrate Hinduism and Hindu Culture.\n\nI am informed that the article is being forwarded with regularity to young Indians.\n\nThe article seems to be by SHANTONU SEN and it is claimed that it was written 6 days ago.\n\nA comment to the post states that,\n\n‘\n\nthisarticle appeared on some blogs 5 years ago. Now it appears as a New Zealander’s view. Tennews please share the source.\n\nbut since many Indians are taking this seriously… Observations on corruption are, sadly, correct.’\n\nWhich is true?\n\nThe name SHANTONU SEN is Bengali.\n\nIs he a Naturalized New Zealander or a pseudonym for India/Hindubaiter/\n\nAs this article seems to have been written, in the Catherine Mayo style, to denigrate Hindu culture rather than addressing the issue of corruption, let me answer point by point.\n\n‘\n\nCorruption in India is a cultural aspect. Indians seem to think nothing peculiar about corruption. It is everywhere.\n\nIndians tolerate corrupt individuals rather than correct them.\n\nNo race can be congenitally corrupt.\n\nBut can a race be corrupted by its culture?\n\nTo know why Indians are corrupt, look at their patterns and practices.\n\nFirst:\n\nBrian from Godzone\n\nNEW ZEALAND\n\nIndians are Hobbesian\n\n(Culture of self interest)\n\nReligion is transactional in India.\n\nIndians give God cash and anticipate an out-of-turn reward.\n\nSuch a plea acknowledges that favours are needed for the undeserving.\n\nIn the world outside the temple walls, such a transaction is named “bribe”.\n\nA wealthy Indian gives not cash to temples, but gold crowns and such baubles.\n\nHis gifts can not feed the poor. His pay-off is for God. He thinks it will be wasted if it goes to a needy man.\n\nIn June 2009, The Hindu published a report of Karnataka minister G. Janardhan Reddy gifting a crown of gold and diamonds worth Rs 45 crore to Tirupati.\n\nIndia’s temples collect so much that they don’t know what to do with it. Billions are gathering dust in temple vaults.’\n\nUsing high sounding words such as Hobbesian’ which has no relevance to what is being written is a very poor attempt in trying to impress the reader..\n\nThis is what Hobbesian is about.\n\nThe Hobbesian trap (or Schelling’s dilemma) is a theory that explains why preemptive strikes occur between two groups, out of bilateral fear of an imminent attack. Without outside influences this situation will lead to a fear spiral (catch-22, vicious circle, Nash equilibrium) in which fear will lead to an arms race which in turn will lead to increasing fear. The Hobbesian trap can be explained in terms of game theory. Although cooperation would be the better outcome for both sides, mutual distrust leads to the adoption of strategies that have negative outcomes for individual players and all players combined.The theory has been used to explain outbreaks of conflicts and violence, spanning from individuals to states’\n\nThis relates to states and also individuals .\n\nFocus is on self interest.\n\nOne should understand that self interest is the basis for survival .\n\nSelf interest is not sinful.\n\nIt is only when it clashes against the well being o other.\n\nUnlike Corporate Religions, Hinduism understands the limitations and frailty of Human nature and suggests ways to realize Self/Godhood.\n\nSanatana Dharma, mistakenly called Hinduism, does not believe in Idol worship,\n\nThere is no sanction for Idol worship in the scriptures of the Hindus, the Vedas.\n\nThe Reality , Brahman, not to be confused with Brahman is beyond Attributes.\n\nBut Human Mind can not operate in a Vacuum.\n\nThe cessation of thought processes leads to Self Realization and this is Yoga, a part of Indian Philosophy.\n\nThen why many Gods?\n\nHuman beings revere and love things that are dear to them.\n\nSo, later Hindu texts , especially the Yoga Sutra of Patanjali, realized this and brought in the concept of Personal God,Iswara.\n\nOne can worship the form one likes and establish and commune with it in a relationship one is comfortable with.\n\nSo, we have God as Mother, Father,Lover, Friend and even as a servant.\n\nOnce the mind concentrates on the form, thoughts cease and mind becomes one with he Reality.\n\nAt that point of time, one realizes that the Idol worship is not necessary and redundant..\n\nTill one reaches that exalted State Idol worship is necessary just as LKG is necessary even for a Ph.D. After you get a Ph.D, LKG seems non sense, but with out it Doctorate is not possible.\n\nWhen one establishes a relationship with a God/Idol, as a Mother, Father, Child, he/she does things to it as one would do for a Living thing.\n\nMother loves to dress up a child and she gets pleasure out of it.\n\nA child has a right to demand things from its Father.\n\nA child offers a kiss as a gift in return.\n\nThis is not a Bribe, but an expression of one’s sentiment.\n\nSimilarly People offer things to God as a token of affection and some times demands things of Him.\n\nGod has other important business to attend to.\n\nHe never interferes in the results one obtains for the actions he performs.\n\nThe results are totally dependent on one’s efforts(though His Grace is needed even for this)\n\nBut the individual thinks that it is because of the prayer or the offering he has made or the vows he has taken his problem was solved.\n\nIf the results are not to his liking, despite his prayers, a Hindu chides his God, then consoles himself that his his time was not good, common parlance in India for Karma Theory.\n\nWhat this practice offers is mental solace and strength in times of crisis.\n\nIt may be of interest to note that God is called as the Place where Grief resides!\n\n‘Dukka Bukh Dukkah Sadananaha’ Vishnu Sahasranama.\n\nWhat does God do then?\n\nHe provides us the tools to overcome grief and obstacles by strengthening Mind.\n\nAs Hinduism is not an organised Religion, where one does not need some ones permission and Baptism to be initiated into it.\n\nGod does not play favorites in Hinduism..\n\n2. Hinduism is Transactional.\n\n.\n\nYes in the sense that it transacts with the Reality unlike other religions where you need a mediator, like Christ to reach God or the Prophet of Islam.\n\n‘There’s a brand of Christianity I’ve often come across in churches and around the interwebs. I’m going to call it Transactional Christianity.\n\nWhen you enter into a transaction, you pay an agreed amount and receive a predetermined item or service in return. It’s a fixed equation, backed by terms and conditions: if you pay A, you get B. And if what you get isn’t to your satisfaction, you can usually get your money back.\n\nMany people apply this kind of formula-based thinking to God.\n\nIf I pray the sinner’s prayer, I’m home free for all eternity.\n\nIf I read the Bible dutifully and have regular “quiet times”, I can expect God to look after me.\n\nIf I attend church regularly, I’ll feel like I’m right with God.\n\nIf I give my ten percent, I’ll reap a harvest of material blessing.\n\nIf I regularly pray for protection over my family, I can expect perfect health.\n\nNow this is all well and good when everything’s going according to plan and all the transactions are proceeding smoothly. But this kind of thinking has a flip side: when things don’t work out the way they’re supposed to – when something goes wrong with the transaction – we’re forced to look for an explanation. When we pray fervently for a friend to be healed but they still succumb to cancer, we’re left with questions like “Did I pray hard enough?” or “Did I have enough faith?” Or when, in spite of our efforts to spend regular time in prayer and Bible study, we still find ourselves dry and thirsty and unable to hear God, we begin to wonder what we’ve done wrong, what sin or issue in our life is blocking our direct line to heaven.\n\nAnd so it is that this very common breed of Christianity often leads to guilt and an unspoken feeling that we must be missing the mark and somehow need to do better. We know that God can be relied upon to keep his part of the bargain – that’s what it says in the terms and conditions, right? – so the problem must lie with us.\n\nThe basic problem with a transactional approach to Christianity is this: God does not conform to our notions of how He should behave, who He should bless and how, and what He should do to reward us for honouring our end of the deal.’\n\nThe above quote is from the following Link.\n\n( http://www.faithmeetsworld.com/transactional-christianity/ )\n\nThe link is from a Believer in Christ.\n\nWhen Europeans came to India they built schools. When Indians go to Europe & USA, they build temples.\n\nIndians believe that if God accepts money for his favours, then nothing is wrong in doing the same thing. This is why Indians are so easily corruptible.\n\nIndian culture accommodates such transactions morally. There is no real stigma. An utterly corrupt JayaLalita can make a comeback, just unthinkable in the West.\n\nSecond –\n\nIndian moral ambiguity towards corruption is visible in its history. Indian history tells of the capture of cities and kingdoms after guards were paid off to open the gates, and commanders paid off to surrender.\n\nThis is unique to India.\n\nIndians’ corrupt nature has meant limited warfare on the subcontinent.\n\nIt is striking how little Indians have actually fought compared to ancient Greece and modern Europe.\n\nThe Turks’ battles with Nadir Shah were vicious and fought to the finish.\n\nIn India fighting wasn’t needed, bribing was enough to see off armies.\n\nAny invader willing to spend cash could brush aside India’s kings, no matter how many tens of thousands soldiers were in their infantry.\n\nLittle resistance was given by the Indians at the “ Battle ” of Plassey.\n\nClive paid off Mir Jaffar and all of Bengal folded to an army of 3,000.\n\nThere was always a financial exchange to taking Indian forts. Golconda was captured in 1687 after the secret back door was left open.\n\nMughals vanquished Marathas and Rajputs with nothing but bribes.\n\nThe Raja of Srinagar gave up Dara Shikoh’s son Sulaiman to Aurangzeb after receiving a bribe.\n\nThere are many cases where Indians participated on a large scale in treason due to bribery.\n\n3.Europeans Built schools.\n\nYes.\n\nWhy?\n\nOut of love for Indian and Indians?\n\nNo, to spread Christianity in India and alter India History.\n\n4.On Betrayals.\n\nBetrayals is a Man’s nature.\n\nThe article seems to say that there is no corruption and betrayals in the west.\n\nPlease read History.\n\nOne curious fact is that all these betrayals were in evidence after Invasion by outsiders into India.\n\nAs for as Jayalalitha is concerned she has been acquitted by Court and appeal is pending in the Supreme court.\n\nTo those who do not know Tamil Nadu she was defeated immediately after the corruption cases came in.\n\nDo not forget Nixon, Betrolucci,Aldrich Ames,the famed five fingering west to Russia.\n\nDo not forget Profumo, Christine Keeler, Brandt’s PA,Sukarno, Rajapakshe,China’s ex strong man Lin Piao…..\n\n5.Let not people whose religion was organised to protect an Empire, whose Savior’s existence is not proven beyond doubt, whose Papacy was created to control people politically,a religion that broke away because a man could not marry a woman out side his marriage.\n\nHinduism has a detailed code of Ethics.\n\nSample from Manu Smriti.\n\n251. A king who thus duly fulfils his duties in accordance with justice, may seek to gain countries which he has not yet gained, and shall duly protect them when he has gained them.\n\n252. Having duly settled his country, and having built forts in accordance with the Institutes, he shall use his utmost exertions to remove (those men who are nocuous like) thorns.\n\n253.

This yuga comes between Treta Yuga and Kali Yuga.\n\nAccording to thePuranas, this yuga ended at the moment when Krishnareturned to his eternal abode of Vaikuntha. According to theBhagavata Purana, the Dvapara Yuga lasts 864,000 years.\n\nKali Yuga,\n\n‘\n\nAccording to the astronomer and mathematician Aryabhattathe Kali Yuga started in 3102 BC. He finished his book “Aryabhattiya” in 499 AD in which he gives the exact year of the beginning of Kali Yuga. He writes that he wrote the book in the “year 3600 of the Kali Age” at the age of 23. As it was the 3600th year of the Kali Age when he was 23 years old, and given that Aryabhatta was born in 476 AD, the beginning of the Kali Yuga would come to (3600 – (476 + 23) + 1 (As only one year elapses between 1 B.C and 1 C.E) = ) 3102 BC.’\n\nThis means The Demise of Krishna was around 3100 BC, that is 5000 years ago.\n\nHowever published works date even The RIG veda which ,according to Hindu Texts was composed much before,that is before Satya Yuga.\n\nSatya Yuga ,\n\n‘\n\nThe duration of the Satya millennium equals 4,800 years of the demigods; the duration of the Dvāpara millennium equals 2,400 years; and that of the Kali millennium is 1,200 years of the demigods […] As aforementioned, one year of the demigods is equal to 360 years of the human beings. The duration of the Satya-yuga is therefore 4,800 x 360, or 1,728,000 years. The duration of the Tretā-yuga is 3,600 x 360, or 1,296,000 years. The duration of the Dvāpara-yuga is 2,400 x 360, or 864,000 years.

However, thesubmerged megaliths are of designs and uses characteristic of around 2000 B.C.

The town is renowned for being host to the most revered temple of Shri Krishna-the famous Krishna Janma Bhoomi Mandir. The temple is the place where lord is said to have been born thousands of years ago. Along with neighboring towns Govardhan, Nandgaon and Vrindavan, the area is a major pilgrimage site for Hindus.The temple is located in the middle of the city mathura.(wiki Sri Krishna Janmabhoomi)\n\n‘Garbh Griha ( Sanctum sanctorum or Prison Cell ) : The divine ambience of the sanctum sactorum thrills the hearts of the devotees as soon as they enter the auspicious place, and a sense of conviction surges in their minds that this indeed is the place where Lord Krishna manifested Himself. It is true that Mathura is the holiest, and it is the only place in the universe where Brahma and Shakti have been manifested at the same place. It is in Mathura that Leelapurushottam Shri Krishna and Ashthabhuja Ma Yogmaya manifested. A spacious verandah and an artistic marble pavilion, Shikhar Mandap, were constructed exactly on the upper part of theMedhi. A miracle observed here is that innumerable forms of Shri Radha-Krishna have appeared on the Makrana marble slabs of the wall of the Shikhar Mandap. The devotees are overwhelmed by the palpable feeling of His divine grace at this place.’\n\nhttp://mathuravisit.com/mathura/krishna-janambhoomi.html\n\nThe area surrounding the prison cell, hat is the Krishna Janma Bhoomi had a magnificent Temple which was called Katara Keshav Dev Temple.\n\nThis was demolished by, who else,the Muslims and a Mosque, Shah Mosque, and Idgah, burial ground was built.\n\nThe facts.\n\nArchaeological and historical evidences show that birth place of Krishna is given different names by the bhakts of Shri Krishna and devotees. In due course of time, surrounding area of birth place of Krishna is also known as “Katara Keshavdev”. Mr. F.S. Grauja, Archaeologist and the then collector of Mathura opined that Katara Keshavdev and surrounding area is known as Mathura alone. From historical literature, the historian Kaniham, informed that there was a Jungle king named Madhu. The place is named after him as “Madhupur” which is known as “Maholi” today. After the defeat of King Madhu, surrounding area of prison presently called as “Bhuteshwar” was called as Mathura and the same was Katara Keshavdev. The historian Kaniham called this as Keshavpur….\n\nFrom the analysis of Archaeological research and thousands of archaeological fragments of Katara Keshavdev and the different writings of foreign tourists, it is evident that huge temples were built from time to time at this place. The evidence show that Brajanabh the great grand son of Krishna, has built first temple at the prison of Kans where the Bhagwan Krishna was divinely born….\n\nFrom the stones script written in Brahmi script “Mahakshatrap Shodash” (B.D. 80-57) it is evident that a person named Vasu has built a Festonn and yagna kund (यज्ञकुन्ड) at the birth place of Krishna. During the regime of Chandragupta, Vikramaditya, the temple was rebuilt.\n\nDuring this period this temple was not only the place of Vaidik ritual but also the place of faith for Buddhists, Jains. In A.D.1017 this gracious temple was looted by Mohammed of Ghaznavi. In the book, Tarike Yamini written by Mir Munshi Al-Utabi, it is stated that in the very middle of the city there was an elegant temple, it was so beautiful, it appeared to have been built by the angels. It is very difficult to describe the elegance of the surrounding temples too in words and in pictures. Sultan Mohammed has also stated that if anybody tries to built such a gracious temple, the expenses would be 10 crores of Dinar and it will take not less than 200 years. However, Being a follower of koran, Mohammed destroyed this temple in the heat of anger. The history shows that the very sincere devotion towards Krishna and lively Hinduism inspired a person named Jajja to built another Krishna Janma Bhoomi and during the regime of Maharana Vijaypal Dev of Mathura in 1150, the temple was rebuilt.\n\nThe evidence from stones script written in Sanskrit at Katara Keshavdev shows that the temple has become the target of destruction in the evil eyes of Muslim rulers. During the regime of Sikander Lodi, Krishna Janma Bhoomi was once again was destroyed. After about 125 years during the rule of Jahangir King, Vir Sinha Judev Bundela constructed a very huge temple of 250 feet tall at the cost of Rs.33 lakhs. In order to protect the temple from evil eye of Muslim rulers, a tall and strong wall was built around the temple….\n\nThe tourist Taivaniyar from France, Manuchi from Italy described the temple as beautiful master piece. The apex of temple was covered with Gold and it was so tall that one can see from distance of 36 miles away from the Agra. All these praise worthy writings regarding the temple made Aurangzeb angry and he destroyed the temple in 1669. He was so irritated about the elegance of Hindu temples that bricks and other material recovered from the destruction of temple was used by him to make a big chair. The height of destructive islamic mind of Aurangzeb is nothing but the construction of anti-Vedic evil structure of Idgah at the very birth place of Krishna. Brahmins and Sages had forewarned Aurangzeb of dire consequences for his evil act of destructing Hindu temples and now Shri Krishna Janm Bhoomi temple….\n\nThe East India Company later auctioned the place to generate revenue on the emotions of the Hindus. Marathas declared the whole area of Katara Keshavdev including Idgah as unowned property and nobody has taken care of this property. This was grave mistake on the part of erstwhile Marathas, they should have owned the property and constructed a huge Shri Krishna temple over it. Due to fragmentation of strength among Hindu rulers, in 1802 Lord Lake acquired victory over Marathas and Mathura and Agra became territory of East India Company. [The loss of places by Maratha rulers is a lesson for modern Hindus, to remain united and fight aggressively against invaders and mlecchas(anti-Hindus)]. East India Company was managed by cruel, wicked and cunning Britishers, they needed money to take other parts of India in the grip. So they devised several ways to generate income from Hindus which included charging extra money from Hindu pilgrims in their holy places – this evil concept was followed by the precedence set by terrorist mughal rulers. In 1815 East India Company declared auction of Katara Keshavdev area admeasuring 13.37 sq.acres. This area was sold to King Patnimal of Kashi. However, though King wanted to built a gracious temple in the memory of Bhagwan Krishna, to fulfill the demands of millions of Hindus, the Muslims took wrong objection that the auction was only for Katara Keshavdev and not for anti-Vedic structure, Idgah. The dispute was initiated by muslims which instigated further rift among peaceful Hindus and trouble maker muslims. The unfair and illegal demand of muslims took the course of disputes to legal battle.\n\nIn the year 1878, for the first time, Muslims registered the case. They stated that Katara Keshavdev is property of Idgah and Idgah was built by Aurangzeb. In this case evidence was demanded from Mathura jurisdiction. The then collector secretary Mr. Tailor stated that this area was unowned in the regime of Maratha. However, the East India Company has also considered the area as unclaimed. Subsequently, in the year 1815 King Patnimal purchased the area in the auction. He further added that according to the verdict, King Patnimal was the owner of the area including other constructions and Idgah, since he paid for the entire area admeasuring 13.37 sq.acres. So any construction happening within the premise is fully owned by King Patnimal. Muslims became peechless, because they cribbed without any substantial evidence of legal ownership. And since the original temple of Shri Krishna Janam Bhoomi belonged to Hindus and later to Hindu King Patnimal, their false claim was overturned….\n\nSecond time the case was registered as Ahmed Shah V/s. Gopi under section 447/352 I.P.C. Mathura in the court of second class Magistrate, Anthony. In this case, Ahmed Shah alleged that the watchman of Idgah, Gopi, was constructing a road in the western side of Katara Keshavdev. However, that road is the property of Idgah and hence, Ahmed Shah stopped Gopi from improving the road. In this case, the learned judge gave decision that the road was the property of family Patnimal and allegation made by Ahmed Shah was completely untrue. The cunning ploy to establish somehow ownership of Idgah again fell flat.\n\nThe Third case was made by the district judge of Agra in the civil court. Appeal No.236 of 1921 and 276 of 1920. This appeal was made in opposition to the decision given by Judge Hoper of Mathura. In the verdict of this case, it is stated that East India Company had auctioned entire area and sold to King Patnimal at Rs.1140/- and tax was collected by the King. In the court verdict, decision is given as the disputable area is not of Idgah as Idgah is property of King Patnimal. So King and his heirs had every right to collect tax on their own land.\n\nDeclaration of the Hindu Rights on Entire Area of Shri Krishna Janm Bhoomi\n\nMuslims by any which means wanted illegal ownership of anti-Vedic strucure, Idgah. In the year 1928, Muslims installed a mill for maintenance and renovation of Idgah. Again the case was registered in the Court of Law and learned Pandit Bishan Narayan Tankha gave the verdict that Katara Keshavdev is the property of descendants of Raja Patnimal and hence neither renovation of Idgah nor installation of mill is allowed. On 7.2.1944 Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya expressed his desire to build Shri Krishna Temple at that place. From the inspiration of M.M.Malviya, Jugal Kishore Birla purchased the entire area at Rs.13,400/- and a trust was formed by Madan Mohan Malviya, Hanuman Prasad Potdar & Bhikamal Atriya.\n\nImage, reference and Citations.\n\nhttp://haribhakt.com/truth-and-facts-about-shri-krishna-janam-bhoomi-mandir/#Archaeological_and_Historical_Namesof_Katara_Keshavdev_Mathura_as_Birth_Place_of_Shri_Krishna\n\nFiled under: Hinduism, Islam Tagged: Aurangazeb, Islam, Katara Keshav Dev Temple, Krishna Janma Bhoomi, Lord Krishna Birth Place, Mathura, Muslim destroy temples, Temples of India, Vrindavan\n\n↧\n\nNo Ram Mandir In Ayodhya,The Hindu Wendy Doniger\n\nIt takes audacity of the best/worst kind to deny a fact outright.\n\nThe intention to denigrate Hinduism and its culture started from Islamic period and it was carried on in a more subtle and systematic manner by the British firstly by publishing ‘First History of India’ by James Stuart Mill from England who without even visiting during the 12 years it took him to write the ‘History’ where he begins by asserting that the world did not begin before 4000 years ago and Indians were barbarians and steeped in superstitions.\n\nOur Secular Indians of post Independent India did not even flinch.\n\nMany of them carried and are carrying on in the path..\n\nWendy Doniger , author of Alternate History which ridicules Hindus and insults Krishna, faced flak from India, of course, excepting from the Sickularists.\n\nHaving been shown the Book where it deserved to be, in the Dustbin, it looks as though she has taken recourse to denigrate Indians in the web.\n\nThis gem of a piece seems to have been written in http://www.vichaar.com and is quoted by the site https://wondersofpakistan.wordpress.com/2009/03/27/the-battle-over-indian-history/\n\nCheck the site and you will know what I am talking about.\n\nThe vichaar site does not seem to work.!\n\nThe article titled Battle over Indian History quoted by a site extolling Pakistan is, to say the least, is disgusting and speaks of intellectual dishonesty and moral depravity.\n\nWhen one attempts to write a History one is expected to be careful and that too when you write about a country about which you are unfamiliar with its culture and its History.\n\nYou should know the language and study and if you lazy or an illiterate you should get some one who can read and study.\n\nThere is no evidence of Rama Temple and it is a story.\n\nReally!\n\nCheck out the Link\n\nhttps://ramanan50.wordpress.com/2012/04/05/ramayana-lord-ramas-exile-date-and-other-details/\n\nAnd follow the Related posts or\n\nStill better,\n\nGoogle Rama’s date+ramanan50\n\n‘https://ramanan50.wordpress.com/2012/04/05/ramayana-lord-ramas-exile-date-and-other-details/\n\nThere are authentic sites about the Temple of Rama in Ayodhya which give out proof about Ram Mandir , Ayodhya.\n\nPlease check them.\n\nWhat is painful is the similar attitude shown by some Indians and of course The Hindu, Indian Newspaper which has published them,\n\nThough I have been writing on dating the Ramayana, Mahabharata and other Indian texts, I have not written on Ayodhya Temple’s date.\n\nThe Sri Rama Navami, the Birth date of Lord Rama falls on 15 April 2016.\n\nRama Navami Puja Muhurta = 11:05 to 13:33\n\nDuration = 2 Hours 27 Mins\n\nRama Navami Madhyahna Moment = 12:19\n\nI will be writing in detail a series of Articles on Ayodhya Ram Mandir and this shall be my offering to Lord Rama for His Birth Day this year\n\n‘\n\n“It’s not a logical judgement with so many parts going 2-1. One does not accept the logicality of the judgement,” said Irfan Habib, a noted historian and a former Chairman of the Indian Council of Historical Research who earlier taught at the Aligarh Muslim University.\n\nHe noted that the verdict seemed to legitimise the events of 1949, when an idol was placed inside the mosque, by constant references. On the other hand, by minimising any mentions of the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992, the court seemed to be disregarding it, he said.\n\nHe also expressed surprise that two judges questioned the date of construction of the Babri Masjid, as well as the involvement of emperor Babar or his commander Mir Baqi, since there had been clear inscriptions to this effect before the demolition. “Things that are totally clear historically, the court has tried to muddy,” he said.\n\n“The historical evidence has not been taken into account,” said D.N. Jha, history professor at the Delhi University. Noting the judgement’s mention of the “faith and belief of Hindus” in reference to the history of the disputed structure, Dr. Jha asked why the court had requested an excavation of the site.\n\n“If it is a case of ‘belief,’ then it becomes an issue of theology, not archaeology. Should the judiciary be deciding cases on the basis of theology is a question that needs to be asked,” he said.\n\nProfessional archaeologists also noted that the judges did not seem to rely heavily on the Archaeological Survey of India’s court-directed excavation of the site in 2003, at least in the summaries of their verdict available on Thursday evening.\n\n“Somewhere, there is doubt about the credibility of that report,” said Supriya Verma of the Jawaharlal Nehru University, who acted as an observer during the ASI excavation.\n\nShe noted that neither Justice Sudhir Agarwal nor Justice Dharam Veer Sharma even referenced the ASI report to support his conclusion on the existence of a temple on the site before the mosque was built.\n\n“It is almost as though they themselves were not convinced by the evidence. They are clearly conceding that there was no archaeological evidence of a temple or of its demolition…It is a judgement of theology,” she said.\n\nAnother observer of the ASI excavation, Jaya Menon of the Aligarh Muslim University, noted that the ASI report itself did not provide any evidence of a demolition, and only asserted the existence of a temple in its conclusion. “So I don’t know on what basis they made their judgements,” she said. The ASI report had been criticised by many archaeologists for ignoring evidence such as animal bones, which would not have been found in a temple for Ram, and the existence of glazed pottery and graves which indicated Muslim residents.’\n\nSource.http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/historical-evidence-ignored-say-historians/article805087.ece\n\nFor years, some Hindus have argued that the 16th century mosque called the Babri Masjid (after the Mughal emperor Babur) was built over a temple commemorating the birthplace of Rama (an avatar of the god Vishnu) in Ayodhya (the city where, according to the ancient poem called the Ramayana, Rama was born), though there is no evidence whatsoever that there has been ever a temple on that spot or that Rama was born there.\n\nOn December 6, 1992, as the police stood by and watched, leaders of the right-wing Hindu party called the BJP whipped a crowd of 200,000 into frenzy. Shouting “Death to the Muslims!” the mob attacked Babur’s mosque with sledgehammers. In the riots that followed, over a thousand people lost their lives, and many more died in reactive riots that broke out elsewhere in India. On the site today, nothing but vandalized ruins remains, and, in a dark corner of the large, empty space, a small shrine with a couple of oleograph pictures of Rama, where a Hindu priest performs a perfunctory ritual. Whether or not there ever was a Hindu temple there before, there is a temple, however makeshift, there now.\n\nPeople are being killed in India today because of misreadings of the history of the Hindus. In all religions, myths that pass for history–not just casual misinformation, the stock in trade of the internet, but politically-driven, aggressive distortions of the past–can be deadly, and in India they incite violence not only against Muslims but against women, Christians, and the lower castes.\n\nMyth has been called “the smoke of history,” and there is a desperate need for a history of the Hindus that distinguishes between the fire, the documented evidence, and the smoke; for mythic narratives become fires when they drive historical events rather than respond to them. Ideas are facts too; the belief, whether true or false, that the British were greasing cartridges with animal fat, sparked a revolution in India in 1857. We are what we imagine, as much as what we do.\n\nHindus in America, too, care how their history is taught to their children in American schools, and the voices of Hindu action groups ring out on the internet. Some of these groups, justifiably incensed by the disproportionate emphasis on the horrors of the caste system in American textbooks, and by the grotesque misrepresentation of Hindu deities in American commercialism, ricochet to the other extreme and demand that all references to the caste system be expunged from all American textbooks.\n\nAnd so I tried to tell a more balanced story, in “The Hindus: An Alternative History,” to set the narrative of religion within the narrative of history, as a statue of a Hindu god is set in its base, to show how Hindu images, stories, and philosophies were inspired or configured by the events of the times, and how they changed as the times changed. There is no one Hindu view of karma, or of women, or of Muslims; there are so many different opinions (one reason why it’s a rather big book) that anyone who begins a sentence with the phrase, “The Hindus believe. . . ,” is talking nonsense.\n\nMy narrative is alternative both to the histories promulgated by some contemporary Hindus on the political right in India and to those presented in most surveys in English–imperialist histories, all about the kings, ignoring ordinary people. But the texts tell us not just who was the ruler but who got enough to eat and who did not. And so my narrative is alternative in its inclusion of alternative people. How does one include the marginal as well as the mainstream Hindus in the story? The ancient texts, usually dismissed as the work of Brahmin males, in fact reveal a great deal about the lower castes, often very sympathetic to them and sometimes coded as narratives about dogs, standing for the people now generally called Dalits, formerly called Untouchables. The argument, for instance, that Dalits should be allowed to enter temples, an argument still violently disputed in parts of India today, can already be found, masked, in ancient stories about faithful dogs who should be allowed to enter heaven. So too, though Feminists often argue that Hindu women were entirely silenced, women’s voices–their ideas and attitudes and, above all, their stories–were often heard and recorded by the men who wrote down the texts.\n\nForeigners, too, made contributions to Hinduism from the very beginning. Once upon a time–about 50 million years ago –a triangular plate of land, moving fast (for a continent), broke off from Madagascar (a large island lying off the southeastern coast of Africa), and sailed across the Indian Ocean and smashed into the belly of Central Asia with such force that it squeezed the earth five miles up into the skies to form the Himalayan range and fused with Central Asia to become the Indian subcontinent. Or so the people who study plate tectonics nowadays tell us, and who am I to challenge them? Not just land but people came to India from Africa, much later; the winds that bring the monsoon rains to India each year also brought the first humans to peninsular India by sea from East Africa in around 50,000 BCE. And so from the very start India was a place made up of land and people from somewhere else. India itself is an import, or if you prefer, Africa outsourced India (and just about everyone else).\n\nThe magnificent civilization of the Indus Valley (in present-day Pakistan) traded with Sumer, Crete, and Mesopotamian, before it came to a mysterious end in about 2000 BCE. At just about the same time, in the nearby Punjab, a very different culture entered India from the Northwest and created the great corpus of texts called the Vedas, the oldest texts of Hinduism. Other invaders– Greeks, Turks, Arabs, and British–made valuable contributions to the complex fabric of Hinduism.\n\nWe can trace certain important ideas throughout the centuries of this unbroken tradition. For example: A profound psychological understanding of addiction to material objects is evident throughout the history of Hinduism. Addiction was the concern not merely of kings or scholars but of ordinary people, like the proto-hippy and the gambler who are depicted in the Vedas (see excerpt). One reaction to this perceived danger was to control addiction through asceticism or renunciation. And so began an ongoing battle between a great tradition that always celebrated sensuality (think: elephants encrusted with rubies, temples that make rococo look like Danish modern, the Kama-sutra) and another that feared the excesses of the flesh and practiced meditation (think: Gandhi).\n\nSome of the British, especially in the early colonial period, admired and celebrated the sensuality of Hinduism. Others, particularly but not only the later Protestant missionaries, despised what they regarded as Hindu excesses. Unfortunately, many educated Hindus took their cues from the second sort of Brit and became ashamed of the sensuous aspects of their own religion, aping the Victorians (who were, after all, very Victorian), becoming more Protestant than thou. It is not fair to blame the British for the Puritanical strain in Hinduism; it began much earlier. But they certainly made it a lot worse. And cultural influences of this sort, as much as the grand ideas, are part of what makes the history of the Hindus so fascinating.\n\nhttp://www.vichaar.com/\n\nScholarship of\n\n‘\n\nMaps in front pages: Maps titled Indias Geographical Features and India from 600 CE to 1600 CE\n\nCOMMENT: In the first map, the Waziristan Hills area is marked erroneously as Kirthar Range. The Kirthar Range is at least 200 miles further south. In the third map, Janakpur, Nagarkot, Mandu and Haldighati are marked several hundred miles from their correct geographical location.\n\nPg. 67 – It is claimed that the entire Harappan culture had a population of 40,000!\n\nCOMMENT: This is estimated as the population of Mohenjo-Daro alone. The population of the entire culture is estimated around 500,000.\n\nPg 130 – The author claims that there are no Gods in the Vedas who are Shudras.\n\nCOMMENT: It is anachronistic to assign castes to Rigvedic deities, but nevertheless, Pushan, Vesmapati and others have been considered Shudra deities in later times.\n\nPg 450- It is claimed that Emperor Ala-ud-Din Khalji did not sack temples in Devagiri.\n\nCOMMENT: His contemporary Amir Khusro clearly mentions that the Emperor sacked numerous temples and raised mosques instead.\n\nPg 552 – The book claims that the Ramcharitmanas was written at Varanasi.\n\nCOMMENT: Both modern scholarship as well as tradition accept that the work (or at least most of it) was written in Ayodhya.\n\nPg 128 – The book likens the Vedic devotee worshipping different Vedic deities to a lying and a philandering boyfriend cheating on his girlfriend(s).\n\nCOMMENT: This is offensive and ignores that fact that in the Rigveda, the gods are said to be all united, born of one another, and from the same source.(India Today)\n\n5.Why is it that writing on Islam, even a hint of Prophet’s Image.would hurt Religious sentiments ?\n\nSatanic Verses by Rushdie

has been the favorite pastime over the last 50 to 60 years.\n\nPrior to this Brahmins were respected for their contribution to the society.\n\nThe advent of Moguls saw a shift in the approach of other communities in India towards the Brahmins.\n\nThe first act of forcing a Brahmin into circumcision was committed by Mir Qasim, the Invader and he sowed the seeds of mistrust among the other communities about Brahmins\n\nThis was followed by all the subsequent rulers and the mistrust reached its zenith during the British regime in India.\n\nThe Britishers knew ,as well as the Portugese that so long as Brahmins were respected their religion,Christianity could not grow its roots in India.\n\nThe objective was clear to them,\n\nSow the mistrust and reap the rewards.\n\nThis has been paying dividends to such an extent that Brahmins are driven to their back foot, most of them migrating to other states in India where there is relatively less persecution.\n\nBefore I proceed further let me narrate two incidents.\n\nAbout ten years back( I was 55 then), my family went to out maternal grandfathers Naive village, Anaippatti aks Akkaraippatti, Madurai District en route from Madurai to Palani,Tamil Nadu.\n\nMy grandfather was a zamindar of sorts then.\n\nWhen I walked down the fields( we own nothing there in the village now), an elderly man of about 75 years, he was not a Brahmin, looked at me keenly and asked me thus.\n\nSir, Are you related to Ramaiya Sami ( Ramaih is my grandfathers known name and Sami is a term of repspect in Tamil),\n\n‘Yes,I am his grandson.\n\nImmediately he unwound the turban he had on his head and kept it in his armpit.\n\nI asked him why he should do this.\n\nHe replied that it is a form of respect.\n\nI asked him why should he do this and was it because he was scared of my grandfather when he was alive.\n\nHe was greatly agitated and stated that that my grandfather was like the head of his Family and he would always to him for help and advice\n\nAnd the he was what he was because of my grandfather .\n\nand all the families in the village felt the same way.\n\nI again asked him hat may be he was right but where was the necessity for him to do the honor to me.\n\nHe replied if he did not do that even God would not forgive him for his ingratitude!\n\nThis noble man , in modern society is classified as a Dalit\n\nAnother instance.\n\nI was on a pilgrimage tour to and surrounding places.\n\nI stayed in a small village nearby in the Home of elderly man of about 75 years.\n\nWhen we went in , the elderly man( he is no more now), he was deeply engrossed in conversation with a man whom I came know later to be the Chief of the Village.\n\nHe was sitting on the floor while the elderly gentleman was reclining in an Easy chair.\n\nWhen Lunch neared he asked all of us, including the Viilage Chief, to eat.\n\nThe man politely refused and stayed on while we ate.\n\nHe left after talking with the elderly man.\n\nWhen we left for the temple,we saw him near the end of the street.\n\nI wished him and casually asked him as to why he did not eat along with us and whether it has any thing to do with us being Brahmins and being not one.\n\nHe replied that is out of respect for the elderly man’s Family and he felt that eating along with them, despite their invitations, would be a form or disrespect.\n\nI asked him whether he was saying this as I was a guest of the house , he said that he was not bothered about my status and would do what he felt!\n\nThis is the amity among the Brahmins and the other communities including Dalits.\n\nYet people vilify Brahmins of practicing Untouchability.\n\nDespite my vigorous checking, I am yet to find a Brahmin being accused of practicing Untouchability and charged under the Law!\n\nOther Communities have been named.\n\n“Tamil Nadu figures among the top five States where a high number of cases of atrocities against Dalits have been reported in recent years, according to National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) Chairman P L Punia.\n\nStatistics show that since 2011, as many as 213 people belonging to Scheduled Castes have been murdered in Tamil Nadu. This year, 16 Dalits have been killed in the State so far. Punia alleged that in many cases of atrocities, the police registered FIRs only after protests or directions from courts.\n\n“In Tamil Nadu, the highest number of sexual assaults against Dalits was recorded in 2011 when 41 rape cases were registered. It came down to 22 in the next year and 23 in 2013. In 2014, the number of rape cases was 18 and in 2015 till now, 14 sexual assault cases against Dalit women had been recorded,” Punia said.\n\nIn the last five years, 6,074 cases were filed under Prevention of Atrocities against SC/ST Act. In 2011, it was as high as 1,170, while it was 1,372 in the year 2012 and 1,497 in 2013. In 2014, the number of cases registered under the Act was 1,464 and so far this year, 571 cases had been registered under the Act.\n\nA State level vigilance committee and district level vigilance committees had been set up to review the atrocities against Dalits twice in every year. But the panels have not met after June 2013, Punia alleged.\n\n“Nearly 60 to 70 per cent cases were closed without action and the conviction rate in Tamil Nadu is lower than the national average of 30 per cent,” he added.\n\nOn the Dalit engineering graduate Gokulraj’s murder case in Namakkal, Punia said the State DGP had told him that all the accused except one had been arrested and assured that he will be nabbed quickly. The Commission could not interfere in the investigation and it could do so only if it found the enquiry to be unsatisfactory\n\nSource.\n\nhttp://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/Atrocities-Against-Dalits-High-in-Tamil-Nadu-Claims-NCSC/2015/07/10/article2912101.ece\n\n‘Even as Haryana reels from the gruesome murders of two dalit children who were burned alive on Tuesday, allegedly by upper caste men, new statistics show that crimes against dalits, or Scheduled Castes (SCs), rose 19 percent last year, on top of a 17 per cent increase in 2013.\n\nIn addition, as many as 744 dalits were murdered last year, up from 676 in 2013.
