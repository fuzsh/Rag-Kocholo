        "text": "Melissa Lemay lives in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, with her three children, four cats, and a dog. She never graduated college. She has lived an interesting life, and her experiences shape her writing (some might call it an obsession). She writes about God, addiction, trauma, healing, motherhood, and many other things. She enjoys spending time with family, drinking good coffee, and being outdoors. She loves animals. Her poem, Ephemeral, was chosen as \"Poetic Publication of the Year\" for 2023 at Spillwords Press. Find her at Melissa Lemay at WordPress and on dVerse Poets Pub.\n\nI was craving the briny sea scent long before the curb in the road, where the trees open to the blue vista. I rolled down my window, my nostrils quivering in the balmy breeze, greedy for the threshold to holiday. Where the road bends, the sylvan curtain pulls apart revealing an expanse of sunlit air, and the crisp pine aroma yields to the tang of seaweed and fish that rises, like a heat wave, from the sea below.\n\nI pulled over, overcome by nostalgia. Salty memories grabbed me from the car and I stumbled towards the cliff’s edge, hungry for the boundless sight of the sea. I could hear its song. It’s been too long.\n\n“Don’t! Or you’ll scare them!”"
