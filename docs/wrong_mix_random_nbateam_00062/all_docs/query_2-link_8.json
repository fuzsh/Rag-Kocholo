        "text": "Companies mustn’t forget that they are made by its people, as much as people are made by them. But if employees feel underwhelmed by the company culture and / or the extant opportunities, and overwhelmed by the possibility to better their lot even at the expense of the obvious toil and risks inherent in moonlighting - something is awfully wrong with the system. It might seem a good idea to list down a few premises that may explain the phenomenon in question: (1) Is it greed that’s driving people to do this? Is it the case that people simply won’t stop in their bid to amass more wealth? And if so, how different is this phenomenon from the universally known and acknowledged corporate greed? The logic is symmetrical: if companies can do it, why can’t the employees that help make the companies do it? (2) Is it just sheer audacity? As in “I don’t care and I’ll do as I please without regard to consequences?” - sounds less likely because this would be harakiri! (3) Is it the case that the companies actually are the paragons of virtue, true and integral, fully committed to their employees’ well-being, giving salaries and benefits and recognition on time and in due measure? And still employees want to moonlight perhaps driven by premises (1) and / or (2)? Why are people doing this - when anyone can tell it’s not fair to moonlight, backstabbing, as it were, the very hand that feeds you? Why? This is not just a question of #integrity I’m sorry. It’s a question of policies, processes, environment and culture. Social contracts are undergoing massive overhaul as we speak. People are not going to lay themselves low and see their lives rot in the name of #ethics like integrity that unilaterally serve the interests of the powerful alone. Let’s talk about this. Let’s fix this. Lest I seem amiss - I must affirm I am all for #integrity. I’m all for keeping confidences for those that help us feed our families. So what is all this leading us to: is there a case for making the contract more humane, more equitable and inclusive? Is it time companies recognize that employees aren’t resources, but humans with a soul? To be sure, there are many extraordinary organisations I’ve had the privilege of serving that do recognize this and earn the eternal gratitude of those that serve them. Some don’t. And when they don’t - these kinds of things emerge from the woodwork."
