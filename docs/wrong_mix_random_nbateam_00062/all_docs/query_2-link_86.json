        "text": "I complete agree with d abuve post . Premchand ryali n yuvaraj Janakiraman rooined my stay in Wipro n they were d only reason for me 2 quit such a wonderful company. Even I was a developer under Prem for a long time n then wurked under yuvaraj towards d end of my stay in Wipro. I had 2 quit because of these third class ass**les.\n\nLet me talk in detail about premchand ryali as I wurked with him for a longer duration . Prem Is a fatAss EGOISTIC , ARROGANT, RUDE , UNCULTURED , HIGHLY POLITICAL person whose motto is 2 keep his boss happy . If his manager asks him 2 clean his toilet he would do it with his bare hands just 2 impress him .He expects his reportees also 2 do d same . He asks dem 2 bring him food , red bull 2 his desk n treats dem like his slave. He asks his reportees 2 carry his backpack , collect Items for his international travels , order food for him in canteen n expects dem 2 serve it 2 him while he will be sitting . This is an insult 2 people under him. He does not know 2 respect his colleagues . He always steals others ideas n projects it as his own . Always take code from every one n never helps anyone within his practice . Fights with every one in his team. Thinks he is God n expects everyone 2 answer his call irrespective of when he calls . If not answered on weekends or public holidays he taunts dem next time. He openly creates rift within team n targets people who don't tell YES SIR 2 HIM. Shouts on people openly on floor n Abuses dem . He has some of his reportees like P**tha d*s who is his pet dog n who does all his domestic wurk. Because of this guy he expects others 2 also do it . 4 developers including me n one manager under him in his analytics n automation team left ONLY BECAUSE OF PREM. He wnts only credit n does not wnt 2 wurk. He takes others credit also. He called me one day n told not 2 help my junior in d team as their project was doing really well which was not under his direct sight . So even if it's his team since he won't get credit he wnts dem 2 fail . This is sick. He also created rift between one more development team which is directly reporting 2 his boss . He called it kill G project . Kill Gundu project . Means 2 destroy d other development team within d same practice . Such is this disgusting fatAss attitude . He should be fired n red listed so that he can't wurk in any other company. He forcefully made me change my domain n 2 take up other technology which I was not at all interested . None of his projects r doing well . Puts extreme pressure on his team 2 achieve unrealistic goals . 2 scr dem he will use all top mgt names n tel I have committed so we have 2 do. All d team Members hate him except for his pet dogs. He is a disgrace 2 Wipro n automation team. Pls fire him .Prem does not know anything . He will listen 2 someone who will talk some technology n he will come n tell his team as if he know d entire subject . n ask dem 2 learn. He will also claim his team mates ideas 2 be his n project himself . He is an empty drum who will explode because of his stinking attitude . He will never help others with his code . He will only take , never give. n he will shout at others if they refuse any of his request\n\nNow about Yuvaraj - he is dual faced . In d short time I wurked with him it was pure hell n torture. Even on my last day in Wipro he called n tortured me. He is very artificial n talks sweetly in front n then attacks from behind . He is one of PREM S DOGS . A yes man 2 his boss. Does not know how 2 handle n manage his team. Does not know anything technically n talks nonsense. This guy has capacity 2 talk nonsense for hours together . Shouts in closed room 2 protect his image from others . He should be fired from Wipro . Cannot handal pressure n passes it on 2 his team. Can't take decisions. He will only delegate wurk 2 his team n not do anything. He will not preach n not follow . His meetings r a torture . It's like he wnts 2 upgrade his knowledge n calls for useless meetings . If Wipro wnts technical talent in his team 2 stay he needs 2 be fired . Very manipulative n a disgusting attitude .\n\nWould suggest HR 2 HAVE A MEETING WITH BOTH PREM N YUVARAJ TEAM WITHOUT DEM 2 KNOW THEIR HONEST FEEDBACK ABOUT THESE TWO N TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION AGAINSt THEM. If they r fired I would rejoin Wipro.\n\nAfter completing your Engineering if you get opportunity with India’s leading IT company then how will you feel?\n\nI need not to elaborate. I am sure you will be on cloud 9.\n\nWait….!\n\nThis is mirage. It’s a honey trap which you should avoid. If you are willing to boost your carrier as an IT professional then this is the worst thing which can happen to you.\n\nI am elaborating what they actually do with freshers . First they will take you interviewed with multiple screening like:\n\n1. Reasoning, Aptitude, English Test.\n\n2. Coding Test\n\n3. Group Discussion\n\n4. Technical Interview\n\n5. HR Interview\n\nIf you are lucky and eligible enough to pass these stages then they will release offer letters to you.\n\nHere comes the hidden truth.\n\nNow they will ask you to sign a Bond of amount Rs. 75000 as a training cost.\n\nYou have to sign because after all this is the big name and you will also have reputation to make in your friend circle. Now After signing bond they will provide their so called training sessions where you will be trained in different domains.\n\n1. Networking,\n\n2. Java,\n\n3. AD servers, Exchange servers, Backup Server,\n\n4. Automation (Scripting),\n\n5. Operating Systems (Unix, Linux, Windows),\n\n6. Internet Of Things (rarest case),\n\n7. VOIP,\n\n8. ITIL Awareness,\n\n9. Virtualization (VMWare, Hypervisor, Oracle Virtual Box),\n\nAnd so on…………………………..\n\nOne more thing I would like to mention:\n\nThey will also ask you to pass language proficiency test. I guess this is something convincing.\n\nThey mean to say that what we have learn 4 years in our college is totally waste and they are giving training something special.\n\nNow after you complete your training successfully.\n\nMark my words successfully, If you achieve more than 70% overall in their internal exam then you are declared as successfully completed your training and you will be awarded projects. You also have to pass some additional courses which you will never know why these?? These are nowhere applicable. Neither in business or in life.\n\nGuess next what !!!\n\nThey will never ask your preferred location as you already have given before applying to job. They don’t care. They will send you where it is almost impossible to survive with their so called Industry standard salary. You will be provided company provided conveyance from your training location to your new location. They have their policy as if journey is more than 500 KM then you are entitled for Air Tickets** If You are late then they will tell you that due to shortage of fund we regret that you have to travel by bus or train. WTF??\n\nNow Any how you reach to your destination then they are providing you Rs. 1200 per day for accommodation and fooding allowance. For example they have sent you Mumbai from Bangalore. They will provide you Air Ticket if you are early otherwise they will send you via train And the shit don’t end up here they will ask you to book tickets on your own…\n\nNow you arrive at Mumbai, Still you haven’t received any allowance and during training they are providing you a salary of $224.62 per month. This salary is quite less than that what an illetrate sweeper or 12th pass Cab driver is earning. Now the hotels are very expensive in Mumbai. You have to shift in Sub-Urban areas like Kalyan, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Panvel, etc. from these places you will find local train whose condition I need not to explain if you have only a little knowledge of local trains in Mumbai. You have to pay a sum of atleast 1000 Rs. for 24 hours, Now comes your fooding part. I am sure you are from different part of country and your eating habits would be different and you would like to eat your native food so It will cost you around Rs.150 for one time and this doesn’t include your local conveyance cost as you have to bear as you have to search some place to stay.\n\nAt this point of time you haven’t received any allowance and you also don’t have savings. So you ask money from your parents. If you are the elder son of your family and the financial condition of the family is not good then you have to ask money from your friends or parents will arrange this money from anywhere because after all you are their son.\n\nNow what’s the point to stay there and do your job on your parent’s money which they arrange for your survival?\n\nBut you have to stay as you are somehow greedy that you will receive the allowance and salary as well. Today is 31st and you are excited to get your salary. Here comes the surprise:\n\nTomorrow is 1st and you are sure that you will receive salary but there is a holiday and you will receive salary on 2nd. I mean seriously this is the condition of India’s 3rd Largest IT Company.\n\nNow on 2nd you receive your full salary but what is this??\n\nYou were told that you have a package of 3 LPA so you have to receive Rs. 25000 per month but now you will have 20,100 Rs in your hand then you are overwhelmed what’s going on here. You will ask clarification on this and they will tell you explanation:\n\nCTC: Cost to company 25000 /- (per month)\n\nGross: You actual income 23187 /- (per month)\n\nTake away salary. 20100 /- (per month)\n\nNow you are trying to heal up. 10 days gone, you have spent almost 15000 rupees and you are null, you have to pay back your loan which you ask from your well-wishers. Now another blow comes in suddenly, you came to know that you have to apply for that compensation of 12000 rupees. (you are 3000 rupees in negative and still homeless) Now once you apply for that allowance your HR will take almost 1 week to approve it and you will receive amount after 10 days of your application.\n\nNow you are searching homes.\n\nIn Mumbai it is a big task to have home (flat only forget about bungalows) the minimum flat (1 BHK) you will get cost you around 70,000 rupees initially and then 10,000 rupees per month. This is really a big amount.\n\nStill you are in free pool or not billable. You are having almost no work than they a lot you randomly project which seriously is of no concern.\n\nYou heal up with your financial crisis now ready for mental torcher:\n\nYou are sent to your concerned customer team. There you have to follow all the rules and regulations of your customer along with your parent company. Now they will ask you come in shifts (rotational shifts) as you are machine and the worst part is that they will not allow you to enter in production environment, even you will not have your own PC.\n\nYou are not working on any technology and the manager and the team is asking you some reports and some monitoring that’s it. You are Okay with this even if you don’t like. Now suddenly after 2 months they ask you log tickets and take responsibility of service desk. Now this is what you have wasted your 4 years of Engineering, Their so called trainings on different technologies.\n\nNow is it your dream Job??????\n\nASK YOURSELF Honestly!\n\n1)They recruit WASE ains in lakhs, WASEIANS are given highest priority when arises the question of joining date\n\n2)If you are an engineer and you respect your education then please do not attend Wipro interviews\n\n3)If you are an engineer and complete 4 years in wipro, by the time you are in fourth year of your career but you package being and engineer will be less than the so called WASEians(WASE ians are the BSC BCS BCA graduate who qualify BITS PILANI exams by open book tests since they complete 3 years education their age is < than 4 year graduate engineers\n\n4)now the 4 year graduate engineer who does not get any hike for 4 years being loyal to wipro leaves the company there are no promotions for engineers\n\n5)BSC gradutes enrolled to WASE program get immediate promotions in the fifth year they are promoted to B2\n\n6)WASEians get immediate onsite opportunities\n\n7)No project manager can fire them\n\n8)they are safe even if their billable status is non billable\n\n9)now coming to the project in which I worked it was telifonica O2 Juliet Choudhary the project manager the most aggressive lady had sexually harassed me\n\nHow I can claim to be a victim\n\nIn oct 2011 before Diwali there were some games organized in ODC(Offshore Delivery Centre) Wipro Campus\n\n-Juliet was not the ODC manager\n\n-She had not taken any written permission from then manager\n\n-She was B3 associate but had occupied half cabin\n\n-When the then ODC manager was busy in client meeting she started with the games\n\n-What was the game?\n\n-She handed over her used lipstick asked us to apply it on our lips and kiss a blank paper as many times as possible and the one who has more number of kisses is the winner\n\n-I opposed this game as it is non verbal unacceptable conduct which could denigrate me\n\n-Then she said if you are unwilling to do this then pay me a sum of x rupees, although she rejected the payment condition later but then made me dance on sheela ki jawani song\n\nI narrated the incidenct to my wife, sister and mother all three said that this incidence falls under sexual harashment category.\n\nalso my observations says that provoking someone to play such games is as good as spoiling the work environement, cultivating vulnerable atmosphere or situations inside the Wipro campus, also this was against COBC policy I could have raised an Ombuds but I have always forgiven.\n\nWe forgive that does not mean people are alright\n\n10)She literally butchered me slaughtered me tortured me for the sake of performance\n\n11)and when did she realize that I am an under performer it took 2.5 years for her to conclude this just before flying to onshore she with Pallavi Jivtode and Navdeep Thakur started pin pointing my mistakes\n\n12)When I revolted against this then everyone started realizing that I am handpicked by Gummalla Srinivas Rao for onsite opportunity this is what Kiran the former employee at Wipro thought\n\n13)Gummalla Srinivas Rao asked me were your tortured in your college life or is this the first time that in an MNC you are getting tortured, In Germany I had drooped an email to HR about all this happenings then Suresh Kallage pretended that he was not aware what was going on in his account\n\n14)In a hurry Suresh closed this matter the then HR was Pronyt Melvin\n\n15) Wipro targets people by mapping them to UCF bands and I was supposed to write an exam for QTP and QC when I was working in OSS BSS telecom domain I was using IBM rational tools for test management\n\n16)Juliet troubled me to sanction the leaves\n\n17)Our joining was delayed by 18 months due to global slowdown I joined wipro in jan 2010\n\n18) we were 2008 pass outs that is mostly 1986 born, waseians 2008 pass outs 1987 born 2009 pass outs 1988 born 2010 pass outs 1989 born imagine we were brought down to the level of BSC graduates who were 2010 pass outs they succeded in getting promotion on time but I was still struggling to get single digit hike\n\n19)When Azim premji announced 8% average hike I received 0% hike\n\n20)Wipro in itself is big lobby only contacts matter\n\n21)Mostly telgu and kannad speaking employees are managers and south Indians are preferred for onsite opportunities\n\n22)In case of Telifonica O2 the trend is changed Navdeep being north indian now Sharmas kapoors and Singhs are preferred\n\n23)Its a total mess\n\n24)If you are and engineer then never join but yes if you are BSC BCA BCS passout then Wipro is paradise for you\n\n25)One thing forgot to mention Juliet Choudhary called me a DUMBO she used to make pugnacious gestures stamp her feet clap with bump of her hand ask for food every now and then ask for sodexo coupons to sponsor her pizza party check our tiffins on regular basis demanded sweets from us"
