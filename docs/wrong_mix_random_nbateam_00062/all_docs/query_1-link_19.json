        "text": "REDWOOD CITY, Calif., Oct. 8, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Informatica Corporation (Nasdaq:INFA), the world's number one independent provider of data integration software, today announced that Wipro Technologies, the Global Information Technology, Consulting and Outsourcing business of Wipro Ltd. (NYSE: WIT) and an Informatica Global Premier Partner, is the first global information and technology services provider to join the new Informatica Certified Professional (ICP) program. The new certification program focuses on demonstrated performance and outcomes to validate Informatica implementation skills, differentiate Informatica partners in the marketplace and drive customer success.\n\nEarlier this year, the ICP program was launched to great reception at Informatica World 2012. It comprises three levels of certification - Associate, Professional and Expert. Each level builds on the one before ensuring an evolution of product knowledge, field experience and expertise in Informatica's best-practice Velocity implementation methodology.\n\n\"Informatica has been a strategic partner for Wipro since 1998 and today through our commitment to the new Informatica Certified Professional program, our consultants will gain advanced knowledge and skills required to meet today's complex data challenges and to deliver customer success. Wipro plans to train and certify over 200 existing employees to be Informatica Certified Professional consultants by the end of 2012.\" said KR Sanjiv, senior vice president and global head, Analytics and Information Management, Wipro Technologies.\n\nCustomers Want Peace of Mind\n\nAccording to R \"Ray\" Wang, principal analyst and chief executive officer, Constellation Research, in his recent 'The Link Between Certification and Partner Profitability\" survey, \"While the traditional mantra of faster, better and cheaper still holds true, customers and prospects now have higher expectations of success and engagement from both their solution providers and partners.\" In the survey, companies shared what they expect from solution providers and partners to keep satisfaction levels high; the top three expectations include: peace of mind deployments, industry capabilities and integrated solutions.\n\nCustomers are taking steps to ensure that they work with the most skilled and knowledgeable practitioners available since professional certification ensures another layer of security when it comes to the success and maximum return on their Informatica technology investment. With the ICP program, customers can expect to engage with trusted, certified partners who have attained a well-defined standard of proficiency at data integration, data quality and master data management.\n\nSupporting Quotes\n\n\"In the past, finding partners was very much word of mouth; you would ask somebody that you trusted for customer references,\" said Andrew Bartels, director of IT, PSA Insurance & Financial Services. \"I think the ability to know that a partner is certified by Informatica personally gives me a tremendous amount of confidence, because ultimately I'm being asked to make a call on technologies for the organization. If I get it wrongâ€¦it's not good.\"\n\n\"In today's competitive IT environment, companies need to differentiate themselves,\" said Daniel West, vice president, Informatica University. \"With the table stakes high, Wipro is ensuring that its customers have access to the most current and advanced knowledge and skills required to meet challenges in data integration, data quality and master data management. The ICP program focuses on demonstrated performance and outcomes to validate Informatica implementation skills, differentiate Informatica partners in the marketplace and drive customer success.\"\n\nTweet this : News: @Wipro Commits to @InformaticaCorp Certification program & Customer Success http://bit.ly/SvBHsC #certification\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nInformatica Certified Professional program\n\nInformatica University\n\nView the Constellation Research webinar\n\nAbout Wipro Technologies\n\nWipro Technologies, the global IT business of Wipro Limited (NYSE:WIT) is a leading Information Technology, Consulting and Outsourcing company, that delivers solutions to enable its clients do business better.
