        "text": "Synopsis\n\nFormer US President Donald Trump was first nominated in 2020 by Christian Tybring-Gjedde, a member of the Norwegian Parliament, for helping in a deal between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. Why he has been nominated now?\n\nAt a time when former US President Donald Trump is gearing up for the Presidential Election 2024, a Republican lawmaker has nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize citing his role in the Abraham Accords treaty. Abraham Accord was signed in 2020 during his presidency and it normalized relations between Israel, Bahrain and the UAE. He has been nominated for this prestigious prize for the fourth time. Barack Obama is the last US President to get this award. He was chosen for this award when he was still in the office.\n\nGiving details of the nomination, New York representative Claudia Tenney said Trump was \"instrumental\" in facilitating the first new peace agreements in the Middle East in nearly 30 years.\n\nNominated for Middle East peace agreements\n\nIn a release posted on her official website, she said bureaucrats, foreign policy professionals, and international organizations insisted that additional Middle East peace agreements were impossible without a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but Donald Trump proved them wrong and helped sign a treaty.\n\nThe Republican lawmaker said the efforts by President Trump in creating the Abraham Accords were unprecedented and continue to go unrecognized by the Nobel Peace Prize Committee, underscoring the need for his nomination today.\n\nEarlier nominations\n\nEarlier in 2020, far-right Norwegian politician Christian Tybring-Gjedde nominated the former president for the Nobel Peace Prize. He praised his for improving ties between North Korea and South Korea. Trump was also nominated by Swedish lawmaker Magnus Jacobsson for his role in brokering a deal to normalize relations between Serbia and Kosovo.\n\nDonald Trump was also nominated for the coveted prize by Swedish nationalist MP Laura Huhtasaari and a group of Australian lawmakers the following year for his role in the Abraham Accords.\n\nHowever, Donald Trump lost out to Filipino and Russian journalists Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov. They received the prize \"for their efforts to safeguard freedom of expression, which is a precondition for democracy and lasting peace\".\n\nFAQs:\n\nWho has nominated Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize and why?\n\nRepublican lawmaker Claudia Tenney has nominated Donald Trump, citing his 'historic' policy in the Middle East. In a release posted on her official website, Tenney declared she decided to nominate Donald Trump for his role in the Abraham Accords treaty.\n\nWhy was Donald Trump nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 and 2020?\n\nThe former US President was nominated in 2020 by Christian Tybring-Gjedde, a member of the Norwegian Parliament, for helping in a deal between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. He said he also nominated him because of the US troop withdrawal from Iraq. Christian, also nominated Trump for the 2019 award for his diplomatic efforts with North Korea.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nDisclaimer Statement: This content is authored by a 3rd party.
