        "text": "The route of acquisitions has been a key strategy of Indian\n\nsoftware majors to rapidly develop marketing presence and domain knowledge in\n\nkey geographies and underserved verticals. What began tentatively around the\n\nyear 2000 has now become a regular feature for these companies. Majority of\n\nthese acquisitions have been focused on developing the front ending and\n\nconsulting capabilities of Indian companies. Part of this strategy is also to\n\nget the back-end of the target companies to relocate to India so as to reduce\n\ncosts.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nIn the longer term, these acquisitions would further globalize\n\nthe operations of the companies and help them truly become local companies in\n\ntheir geographies where they operate. Investors also welcome such acquisitions\n\nas they make productive use of the large idle cash reserves that most of the\n\ncompanies carry in their books. As the IT services sector mature, investors\n\nwould also look deeper into the transactions to see how the synergies operate,\n\nand also see whether the company is able to integrate not only the legal\n\nentities, but also the people and processes behind them.\n\nFACT\n\nSHEET\n\nWebsite:www.wipro.com\n\nDoddakannelli, Sarjapur Road, Bangalore 560035\n\nTel: +91-80-2844-0011\n\nFax: +91-80-2844-0256\n\nArea\n\nof Specialization:Software services, product sales and\n\nimplementation, BPO consumer care, and lighting\n\nConsolidated\n\nRevenues\n\n(March 2007): Rs 15,000 crore\n\nOffices:\n\nIndia,\n\nUS, Canada, UK, France, Sweden, Germany, Finland, Italy, and Japan\n\nListing\n\n(Stock Exchanges): NSE,\n\nBSE, and NYSE\n\nFace\n\nValue:Rs\n\n2 per share\n\n52-Week\n\nHigh/Low: Rs 681.25/389.5\n\nBSE\n\nCode: 507685\n\nNSE\n\nCode: WIPRO\n\nBangalore-based Wipro has been among the most aggressive\n\nacquirers from India in the recent past, and the last few months have seen a\n\nflurry of activities in this area. We believe that in the medium term, the\n\norganic growth strategy would also help Wipro to develop into a more nimble\n\norganization, and become more competitive in the marketing areas, which was,\n\nsometimes back, considered a weakness for the company.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWipro Tech is an information technology service company\n\nestablished in India in 1980. It is the global IT services arm of Wipro. It is\n\nheadquartered in Bangalore and its employee strength was more than 70,000 till\n\nSeptember 2007.\n\nWipro Technologies has over 300 customers across the US, Europe,\n\nand Japan including fifty of the Fortune 500 companies. Some of its customers\n\nare Boeing, BP, Cisco, Ericsson, IBM, Microsoft, Prudential, Seagate, Sony,\n\nWindriver, and Toshiba. It has dedicated development centers and offices across\n\nIndia, Europe, North America, Latin America, and Asia Pacific.\n\nThe current chairman, managing director, and majority stake\n\nowner is Azim Premji, who has headed the software and hardware divisions since\n\nWipros inception. Premji completed bachelors degree in electrical\n\nengineering. The Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, and the Manipal\n\nAcademy of Higher Education have both conferred honorary doctorates on him,\n\nwhile XLRI, Jamshedpur has conferred the Sir Jehangir Ghandy Medal for\n\nIndustrial and Social Peace. Premji is also a non-executive director on the\n\nboard of RBI. The equity of the company currently stands at Rs 291.8 crore,\n\nwherein promoters hold 81.44%, institutional investors hold 6.23%, Indian public\n\nholds 7.93%, and private corporate bodies and others hold the balance 4.4%.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nFor the financial year ended March 2007, Wipro reported an\n\nimpressive revenue growth of 41% with revenues touching Rs 15,000 crore as\n\ncompared to Rs 10,626 crore in the previous financial year. Each of the companys\n\nbusiness segments reported strong growth with the Indian and the Asia Pacific IT\n\nservices and products segment registering a 46% growth amounting to Rs 2,483\n\ncrore as compared to Rs 1,704 crore in the last year. Revenues from the global\n\nIT services and products segment amounted to Rs 11,094 crore as against Rs 8,066\n\ncrore, up 38%, whereas revenues from the consumer care and lighting segment\n\nregistered a 36% growth, amounting to Rs 818 crore against Rs 600 crore.\n\nRevenues form its US offices amounted to Rs 7,270 crore, up 37% as compared to\n\nRs 5,308 crore, whereas revenues for the same period from India witnessed a 40%\n\nannual growth amounting to Rs 3,137 crore as against Rs 2,243 crore. Rest of the\n\nworld registered a 40% growth in the revenues to Rs 896 crore as compared to Rs\n\n642 crore. The net profit for the same period stood at Rs 2,942 crore as\n\ncompared to Rs 2,067 crore, up 42% on annual basis.\n\nDuring the year, Wipro announced it has signed an agreement to\n\nacquire India, Middle East, and SAARC operations of 3D Networks and Planet PSG\n\nin all cash deal. Wipro entered into a partnership with Apriso to provide\n\nmanufacturing enterprises multi-site implementations. Wipro has formed alliances\n\nwith supply chain solutions provider Manhattan Associates, Mark Logic, and a\n\njoint venture with Motorola (named WMNetServ), which will deliver outsourced\n\ntelecom services to help focus on their core business. Also, Wipro acquired\n\nEurope-based retail solutions provider, Enabler, in an all cash deal. It also\n\nacquired US-based Quantech Global Services, a mechanical design services firm.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nFor the quarter ending June 30, 2007, revenue increased to Rs\n\n4,203 crore compared to 3,143 crore last year, an increase of 34% y-o-y. Profit\n\nafter tax stood at Rs 726 crore compared to Rs 620 crore, an increase of 17%\n\ny-o-y. During the quarter, Wipro added thirty-nine new clients in the global IT\n\nservices and products. The company bagged $130 mn multi-year total outsourcing\n\nengagement from a utility company in Europe. Similarly, Wipro and Cairn India\n\npartnership won the FAO Research Award of Distinction in the finance and\n\naccounting space. The company also bagged SAPs Pinnacle Award for Software\n\nSolution Leadership and Forrester rated Wipro as Leader in global IT\n\noutsourcing. Also, the company has decided to merge some of the subsidiary\n\ncompanies with the company, through two schemes of amalgamations.\n\nFor the quarter ending September 30, 2007, the company has\n\nprojected revenues from Global IT services business to be around $777 mn. Given\n\nthe continued growth in the last few quarters as well as the new acquisitions,\n\nwe believe Wipro will maintain its revenue growth in the medium term, though\n\nmargins may get impacted in the medium term.\n\nThe shares of Wipro trade at Rs 476, discounting its FY 08\n\nearning by twenty-one times. Given its moderate growth of earnings and\n\nincreasing pressure on margins going forward, we believe that the stock is fully\n\npriced. Market Performer.\n\nAdvertisment"
