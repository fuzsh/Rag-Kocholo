Beckett’s effortless writings over the years, created a unique dramatic persona in his plays that won him the Noble Peace prize. After receiving one of the highest awards known to humanity, he kept a low profile. This period alludes to the satisfaction of reaching his peak. Yet, in his later work, the Endgame makes a direct correlation with the satisfaction of making your peak a plateau. He creates a philosophical predicament\n\nCharacters Beckett did not view and express the problem of Absurdity in any form of philosophical theory (he never wrote any philosophical essays, as Camus or Sartre did), his expression is exclusively the artistic language of theatre. In this chapter, I analyse the life situation of Beckett's characters finding and pointing at the parallels between the philosophical background of the Absurdity and Beckett's artistic view. As I have already mentioned in the biography chapter, Beckett read various\n\nThe Human Condition Through the Beckett Lens Samuel Beckett is well known for leaving a lot left unsaid, many of his plays and works of literature often left viewers in states of confusion or outrage as to what had or hadn’t appeared on stage, and in his play “Breath” he did not disappoint. In the play, the sound of vagitus mixed with heavy breathing, and the brash imagery of trash strewn about the stage could be interpreted as many things. For example, it could be a commentary on birth and the state\n\nThe mood and attitude of Samuel Beckett’s 1957 play, Endgame, are reflective of the year of its conception. The history that reflects directly on the play itself is worth sole attention. In that year, the world was a mixed rush of Cold War fear, existential reason, and race to accomplishment (Garraty 307). Countries either held a highlighted concern with present wartime/possibility of war, or involvement with the then sprouting movement of Existentialism. The then “absurdist theater” reflected the\n\nSamuel Beckett: Sound and Silence Patrick Richert FHSU February 15, 2013 Samuel Beckett was a world renown author of poetry, novels, and theatrical plays. He was born in Ireland and spent much of his adult life in Paris. His works were primarily written in French, and then translated, many times by the author himself, into English. He is known for creating works of dark comedy, and absurdism, and later in his career a minimalist. Due to his late start as an author, he is considered one\n\n1429631 17/02/2015 Literature Endgame, Samuel Beckett and Waiting for Godot, Samuel Beckett The vogue for Beckett started with the success of Waiting for Godot which was produced in Paris in 1953. It was his first play apart from one, Eleutheria, written in 1947 which was never published or performed. In 1946, Samuel Beckett wrote Mercier et Camier which according to Ronald Hayman in his critic essay entitled Contempory playrights Samuel Beckett 'show how the dialogue of the male couple\n\nSamuel Beckett was born in Ireland on April 13, 1906. Waiting for Godot was composed between 1948 and 1949 in French. The premiere was on January 5 1953 in Paris. After World War II, he wrote Waiting for Godot. In Samuel Beckett’s play, Waiting for Godot, it is essential that the play is characterized by time and hopelessness. That the purpose of life is unanswerable; there is no apparent meaning to it. When first analyzing the play, there is an uncertainty if anything happens within the play or\n\nGodot: Theatre of the Absurd. Who is Godot and what does he represent? These are two of the questions that Samuel Beckett allows both his characters and the audience to ponder. Many experiences in this stage production expand and narrow how these questions are viewed. The process of waiting reassures the characters in Beckett 's play that they do indeed exist. One of the roles that Beckett has assigned to Godot is to be a savior of sorts. Godot helps to give the two tramps in Waiting for Godot a\n\nSamuel Beckett’s Waiting for Godot is a theater of absurd which pictures the world that has lost its meaning due to the absence of God and features two protagonists who are incapable of acting upon themselves and who are heavily dependent on a mystical figure named Godot. Given that Beckett is profoundly influenced by existentialism -- a philosophical study in which an individual is required to act upon oneself rather than passively relying on religion -- the audience may find a non-existential aspect\n\nIn Samuel Beckett’s play Waiting for Godot, the use of seemingly useless repetition with subtle differences is seen throughout the play in a way that Beckett allows the audience to put their own meaning into the play. The play writer does this through the repetition of his setting, character’s actions and the creation of almost two identical days. In Waiting for Godot, we see a tragic comedy in which nothing happens, not once, but twice. In between the two acts, which are separate days in the play"
