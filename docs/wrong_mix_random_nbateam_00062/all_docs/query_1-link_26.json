        "text": "The Capgemini Nordic Sustainability Tech Award celebrates organizations across the Nordic region creating innovative technology solutions for a sustainable future. The urgency of the global climate crisis demands ground-breaking technology and IT service innovations that scale across industries. The Capgemini Nordic Sustainability Tech Award celebrates the inspirational tech pioneers pushing the boundaries of sustainable IT and its role in limiting the environmental and social impact of climate change. Launched in 2022, the award reflects Capgeminiâ€™s own commitment to achieving carbon neutrality for its operations no later than 2025 and across its supply chain by 2030, as well as to becoming a net zero business by 2040.\n\nWe want to hear from you\n\nYour project will be evaluated by a panel of business leaders and policy makers from the Nordic countries. The finalists from each country will be invited to an exclusive networking dinner and awards ceremony, where the winners will be announced."
