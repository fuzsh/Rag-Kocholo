        "text": "News\n\nNRI News\n\nUS & Canada News\n\nPIO with mastery over Sanskrit and tabla wins 'Math Nobel'\n\nThis story is from August 13, 2014\n\nPIO with mastery over Sanskrit and tabla wins 'Math Nobel'\n\nManjul Bhargava, who became a tenured full professor at Princeton University (and the second youngest in its history) within two years of finishing graduate school, was among four winners of the prestigious prize.\n\nWASHINGTON: A Canadian-American mathematician of Indian-origin who has mastered Sanskrit and plays tabla at concert level has been awarded the Fields Medal, the Nobel Prize equivalent for math.\n\nManjul Bhargava, who became a tenured full professor at Princeton University (and the second youngest in its history) within two years of finishing graduate school, was among four winners of the prestigious prize announced at the International Mathematical Union (IMU) Congress in Seoul on Tuesday.\n\nA surprise and welcome co-winner was Maryam Mirzakhani, a female Iranian mathematician who teaches at Stanford University. It is the first time a female mathematician has won the Fields medal; all 52 previous winners have been men in a field traditionally dominated by the male of the species. Expectedly, it created a ripple in the rarefied math world.\n\nMirzakhaniâs success was ''hugely symbolic and I hope it will encourage more women to get into mathematics because we need more women. I am very happy that now we can put to rest that particular âit has never happened beforeâ,'' Ingrid Daubechies, who is herself the first female president of the International Mathematical Union (IMU), said while announcing the award.\n\nThe two other Fields Medal winners for 2014 are Artur Ãvila from Brazil and Martin Hairer from Austria. Avila is also the first Brazilian and Latin American to win the medal.\n\nThe IMU also presented Princeton alumnus Subhash Khot, a New York University professor of computer, with the Rolf Nevanlinna Prize, which honors ''outstanding contributions in mathematical aspects of information sciences.''\n\nAlthough a Canadian-American who was born in Hamilton, Ontario, Bhargava, 40, is no stranger to India or to Indian mathematicians; indeed, he has deep connections to India. His mother, Mira Bhargava, is herself a rare female mathematician, teaching at Hofstra University (another well-known female Indian-American mathematician is Bhama Srinivasan at the University of Illinois in Chicago).\n\nManjul has also collaborated with many Indian mathematicians, and his work with fellow Princeton scholar Arul Shankar, his PhD student, won them the Fermat Prize in 2011. Manjulâs own PhD advisor was Andrew Wiles, famous for proving Fermatâs last theorem.\n\nBhargava is also an accomplished table player (tutored by Zakir Hussain) and has the number on Sanskrit, which he learned from his grandfather Purushottam Lal Bhargava, who was the head of the Sanskrit department of the University of Rajasthan, during family visits to Jaipur. He sees close links between his three loves â math, music, and Sanskrit â noting how beats of table and rhythms of Sanskrit poetry are highly mathematical.\n\nSuch recognition came to him early. In several past interviews, he has often recounted how in Grade 3, he became curious about how many oranges it takes to make a pyramid. Just as well his mathematician mother and chemist father were well-to-do; they indulged him with oranges till he figured out the answer, which was not long coming. Now heâs at the pinnacle of his calling.\n\nManjul Bhargava\n\nOne to four Fields Medals are awarded once every four years to mathematicians under the age of 40 years at the International Congress of the International Mathematical Union (IMU), which meets every four years. The award presentation will take place in Seoul on Wednesday at the quadrennial IMU Congress (Hyderabad hosted it in 2010).\n\nAlthough the prize money ($ 15,000) is chump change (approximately 1/100th) compared to the Nobel Prize, the award, long dominated by Americans, Russians, French, and Britons (38 medals between them), is the highest recognition in the world of mathematics.\n\nCanadian mathematician John Charles Fields instituted it at a time mathematicians felt short-changed that they had no Nobel recognition. The Nobel Prize is awarded for literature, peace, economics, physiology or medicine, chemistry and physics â but not for mathematics.\n\nLegend â or the apocryphal story â goes that the Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel, who instituted the Nobel Prize, disdained mathematics after someone he loved cheated on him with a mathematician. But there is no historical basis to the story. More likely fact is that Nobel didn't care much for mathematics because it was not considered a practical science from which humanity could benefit (a chief purpose for creating the Nobel Foundation).\n\nAll that has changed, of course. Mathematics offers solutions to everyday issues from airline scheduling to Internet security, even though many practitioners pursue esoteric problems described in dense language incomprehensible to the layman. Bhargavaâs PhD thesis, for instance, is said to have helped in the ''determination of the asymptotic density of discriminants of quartic and quintic number fields.''\n\nBhargava was awarded the 2012 Infosys Prize in mathematics for his ''extraordinarily original work in algebraic number theory, which has revolutionized the way in which number fields and elliptic curves are counted.'' That came on top of almost every other top prize in math, from the SASTRA Ramanujan Prize in 2005 to the American Mathematical Society's Cole Prize in 2008. So the Fields Medal comes as no great surprise to the mathematical community in the U.S or in India.\n\nLast week, as speculation heated up about possible 2014 winners of Fields Medal, an online poll put Bhargava on top with 516 votes, with Avila coming second with 486 votes, and Mirzakhani third with 456 votes. Apparently, his colleagues and peers pretty much expected it.\n\n\"The Fields Medal is probably the most prestigious recognition in pure mathematics,\" said David Gabai, the Hughes-Rogers Professor of Mathematics and department chair at Princeton, noting that ''beyond being a great researcher and adviser to graduate students, Manjul is an extraordinary teacher.\"\n\nHe is particularly known for his popular freshman seminar, \"The Mathematics of Magic Tricks and Games,\" wherein students explore the mathematical principles behind magic tricks and games.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA"
