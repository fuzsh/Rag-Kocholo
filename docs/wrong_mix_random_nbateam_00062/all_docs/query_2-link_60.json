        "text": "Publishing business of the University of Cambridge\n\nFor the football club, see Cambridge University Press F.C.\n\nCambridge University Press is the university press of the University of Cambridge. Granted a letters patent by King Henry VIII in 1534, it is the oldest university press in the world. It is also the King's Printer.[3]\n\nCambridge University Press is a department of the University of Cambridge, and is both an academic and an educational publisher. It became part of Cambridge University Press & Assessment, following a merger with Cambridge Assessment in 2021. With a global sales presence, publishing hubs, and offices in more than 40 countries, it publishes over 50,000 titles by authors from over 100 countries.[4] Its publications include more than 420 academic journals, monographs, reference works, school and university textbooks, and English language teaching and learning publications.[5] It also publishes Bibles, runs a bookshop in Cambridge, sells through Amazon, and has a conference venues business in Cambridge at the Pitt Building and the Sir Geoffrey Cass Sports and Social Centre.\n\nCambridge University Press, as part of the University of Cambridge, is a non-profit organization.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nCambridge University Press is the oldest university press in the world. It originated from letters patent granted to the University of Cambridge by Henry VIII in 1534. Cambridge is one of the two privileged presses (the other being Oxford University Press). Authors published by Cambridge have included John Milton, William Harvey, Isaac Newton, Bertrand Russell, and Stephen Hawking.[6]\n\nUniversity printing began in Cambridge when the first practising University Printer, Thomas Thomas, set up a printing house in 1584.[7] The first publication was a book, Two Treatises of the Lord His Holie Supper.[8][9] In 1591 the first Cambridge Bible was printed by John Legate and in 1629 Cambridge folio edition of the King James Bible was printed by Thomas and John Buck.[8][9]\n\nIn July 1697, the Duke of Somerset made a loan of £200 to the university \"towards the printing house and press\" and James Halman, Registrary of the university, lent £100 for the same purpose.[10]\n\nA new home for the press, The Pitt Building, on Trumpington Street in the centre of Cambridge was completed in 1833, which was designed by Edward Blore. It became a listed building in 1950.[11]\n\nIn the early 1800s, the press pioneers the development of stereotype printing, allowing successive printings from one setting.[12][8] The press began using steam-powered machine presses by the 1850s. It was in this period that the press turned down what later became the Oxford English Dictionary – a proposal for which was brought to Cambridge by James Murray before he turned to Oxford.[6]\n\nThe press journals publishing programme began in 1893 with the Journal of Physiology and then the Journal of Hygiene and Biometrika. By 1910 the press had become a well-established journal publisher with a successful list which includes its first humanities title, Modern Language Review. 1956 saw the first issue of the Journal of Fluid Mechanics.\n\nThe press has published 170+ Nobel Prize winners, the first in 1895.\n\nIn 1913, the Monotype system of hot-metal mechanised typesetting was introduced at the press.\n\nIn 1949, the press opened its first international branch in New York.[7]\n\nThe press moved to its current site in Cambridge in 1963. The mid-century modern building, University Printing House, was constructed in 1961–1963. The building was designed by Beard, Bennett, Wilkins and Partners.[13]\n\nIn 1975, the press launched its English language teaching publishing business.[14]\n\nIn 1981, the press moved to a new site on Shaftsbury Road. The Edinburgh Building was purpose-built with an adjoining warehouse to accommodate the press's expansion. It was built in 1979–80 by International Design and Construction.[13] The site was demolished in 2017 to make way for the construction of Cambridge Assessment's Triangle Building.[15]\n\nIn 1989, the press acquired the long-established Bible and prayer-book publisher Eyre & Spottiswoode, which gave the press the ancient and unique title of The Queen's Printer.[9]\n\nIn 1992, the press opened a bookshop at 1 Trinity Street, Cambridge, which is the oldest-known bookshop site in Britain as books have been sold there since 1581.[16] In 2008 the shop expanded into 27 Market Hill where its specialist Education and English Language Teaching shop opened the following year.[citation needed] The press bookshop sells Press books as well as Cambridge souvenirs such as mugs, diaries, bags, postcards, maps.[17]\n\nIn 1993, the Cass Centre was opened to provide sports and social facilities for employees and their families.[13]\n\nIn 1999, Cambridge Dictionaries Online was launched.[14]\n\nIn 2012, the press sold its printing operation to MPG Books Group[18] and now uses third parties around the world to provide its print publications.\n\nIn 2019, the press released a new concept in scholarly publishing through Cambridge Elements where authors whose works are either too short to be printed as a book or too long to qualify as a journal article could have these published within 12 weeks.[19]\n\nIn 2021, Cambridge University Press merged with Cambridge Assessment. The new organisation is called Cambridge University Press & Assessment.[20][21][22]\n\nIn 2022, Amira Bennison was elected chair of the Cambridge University Press academic committee, replacing Kenneth Armstrong.[23]\n\nNamed Printers at Cambridge University Press[24] Name From To Thomas Thomas 1583 1588 John Legate 1588 before 1593 John Porter before 1593 1606 Cantrell Legge 1606 before 1608 Thomas Brooke before 1608 1622 Thomas Buck 1625 ?

The poem's words and lines are arranged on the page to create a visual image of its subject.\n\n1713: the second edition of Isaac Newton's Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica is published by the press.\n\n1763: John Baskerville's folio Bible, considered a masterpiece, uses his innovations with type, paper, ink, and the printing process.\n\n1895: the first title by a Nobel Laureate is published: J. J. Thomson's Elements of the Mathematical Theory of Electricity and Magnetism.\n\nCurrent publications\n\n[edit]\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of Cambridge University Press book series and List of Cambridge University Press journals.\n\nOpen access\n\n[edit]\n\nCambridge University Press has stated its support for a sustainable transition to open access.[25] It offers a range of open access publishing options under the heading of Cambridge Open, allowing authors to comply with the Gold Open Access and Green Open Access requirements of major research funders. It publishes Gold Open Access journals and books and works with publishing partners such as learned societies to develop Open Access for different communities. It supports Green Open Access (also called Green archiving) across its journals and monographs, allowing authors to deposit content in institutional and subject-specific repositories. It also supports sharing on commercial sharing sites through its Cambridge Core Share service.\n\nIn recent years it has entered into several Read & Publish Open Access agreements with university libraries and consortia in several countries, including a landmark agreement with the University of California.[26][27] In its 2019 Annual Report, Cambridge University Press stated that it saw such agreements \"as an important stepping stone in the transition to Open Access\".[28]\n\nIn 2019, the press joined with the University of Cambridge's research and teaching departments to give a unified response to Plan S, which calls for all publications resulting from publicly funded research to be published in compliant open access journals or platforms from 2020. The response emphasized Cambridge's commitment to an open access goal which works effectively for all academic disciplines, is financially sustainable for institutions and high-quality peer review, and which leads to an orderly transition.[29]\n\nThe press is a member of the Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association and the International Association of STM Publishers.\n\nIn 2023, more than 50 per cent of Cambridge University Press research articles are in open access mode.[30]\n\nNobel prize winners published by Cambridge University Press\n\n[edit]\n\nOrganisational governance and operational structure\n\n[edit]\n\nRelationship with the University of Cambridge\n\n[edit]\n\nCambridge University Press is a non-teaching department of the University of Cambridge. The press has, since 1698, been governed by the press 'Syndics' (originally known as the 'Curators'),[32] 18 senior members of the University of Cambridge who, along with other non-executive directors, bring a range of subject and business expertise.[33] The chair of the syndicate is currently Professor Stephen Toope (Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge). The syndicate has delegated its powers to a Press & Assessment Board; and to an Academic Publishing Committee and an English Language Teaching & Education Publishing Committee.[34]\n\nThe Press & Assessment Board is responsible for setting overarching strategic direction.[34] The Publishing Committees provide quality assurance and formal approval of the publishing strategy.[34]\n\nThe operational responsibility of the press is delegated by the Syndics to the secretary of the syndicate and chief executive.\n\nIn 2020 the university announced its decision to merge Cambridge University Press with Cambridge Assessment.[20]\n\nOperational structure\n\n[edit]\n\nUntil August 2021, Cambridge University Press had three publishing groups:\n\nAcademic Publishing: publishes research books and journals in science, technology, medicine, humanities, and the social sciences.[35] It also publishes advanced learning materials and reference content as well as 380 journals, of which 43 are 'Gold' Open Access. Open Access articles now account for 15 per cent of articles.[citation needed] The group also publishes Bibles, and the press is one of only two publishers entitled to publish the Book of Common Prayer and the King James Version of the Bible in England.[36]\n\nEnglish Language Teaching: publishes English language teaching courses and resources for learners of all ages around the world.[35] It offers a suite of integrated learning and assessment tools underpinned by the Cambridge Curriculum, a systematic approach to learning and evaluating proficiency in English. It works closely with Cambridge Assessment through the joint initiative Cambridge Exams Publishing.\n\nEducation: delivers educational products, services and software for primary, secondary and international schools. It collaborates with Cambridge Assessment and the University of Cambridge Faculty of Education to help countries such as Kazakhstan and Oman to improve their education systems.[citation needed] It also works with Cambridge Assessment to reach more schools and develop new products and services that improve teaching and learning. This area is merging with the schools team at Cambridge Assessment\n\nFrom 1 August 2021 onwards, Cambridge University Press became solely the academic and bible publishing division of Cambridge University Press & Assessment. The English and education arms of the organisation merged with the equivalent departments of Cambridge Assessment to form new, merged divisions.\n\nCambridge University Press partnerships and acquisitions\n\n[edit]\n\n2011, formed a partnership with Cambridge Assessment to publish official Cambridge preparation materials for Cambridge English and IELTS examinations.\n\n2015, formed a strategic content and technology partnership with Edmodo, the world's most extensive e-learning platform for primary and secondary teachers and pupils, to bring premier educational content and technology to schools in the United Kingdom.[37]\n\n2017, the University of Cambridge announced that Cambridge University Press and Cambridge Assessment would work more closely in future under governance by the Press & Assessment Board.\n\n2019, with Cambridge Assessment English acquired the Centre for Evaluation and Monitoring from Durham. CEM provides assessments to measure learner progress and potential, as well as 11 Plus exams for many UK independent and grammar schools.[38]\n\n2020, partnered with EDUCATE Ventures, the University College London edtech accelerator, to better understand the challenges and successes of home education during the lockdown.[39]\n\n2020, partnered with online library Perlego to offer students access to digital textbooks.[40]\n\n2020, the University Cambridge announced it would create a \"new unified organization\" by merging Cambridge University Press and Cambridge Assessment, to launch 1 August 2021.[41]\n\n2021, Cambridge Assessment and Cambridge University Press formally became one organisation under the name Cambridge University Press & Assessment.[21]\n\nDigital developments\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2011, Cambridge University Press adopted SAP software. Cambridge University Press works closely with IT services firm Tech Mahindra on SAP, and with Cognizant and Wipro on other systems.[42][43]\n\nIn 2016, Cambridge Books Online and Cambridge Journals Online were replaced by Cambridge Core – a single platform to access its publishing (\"the home of academic content from Cambridge University Press\"[44]). It provided significantly enhanced interfaces and upgraded navigation capabilities, as well as article-level and chapter-level content selection.[45] A year after Cambridge Core went live, the press launched Cambridge Core Share, functionality to allow users to generate and share links with free access to selected journal articles, an early sign of the press's commitment to open research.[46][unreliable source?]\n\nIn 2020, partnered with online library Perlego to offer students access to digital textbooks.[40]\n\nIn 2021, the press acquired CogBooks. The technology adapts and responds to users, \"recommending course material needed to optimise learning\".[47]\n\nIn 2021, the press began migrating its website onto Drupal.[48]\n\nControversies\n\n[edit]\n\nTax exemption controversy\n\n[edit]\n\nIn May 1940, CUP applied to the Inland Revenue for the exemption of its printing and publishing profits from taxation, equivalent to charitable status. After a November 1940 Inland Revenue hearing, CUP's application was refused \"on the ground that, since the Press was printing and publishing for the outside world and not simply for the internal use of the University, the Press's trade went beyond the purpose and objects of the University and (in terms of the Act) was not exercised in the course of the actual carrying out of a primary purpose of the University\".[49] In November 1975, with CUP facing financial collapse,[50] CUP's chief executive Geoffrey Cass wrote a 60-page \"preliminary letter\" to the Inland Revenue again seeking tax-exemption. A year later Cass's application was granted in a letter from the Inland Revenue, though the decision was not made public.[51][52] After consulting CUP, Cambridge's 'sister' press, the giant Oxford University Press presented their own submission and received similar exemption. In 2003 OUP's tax exemption was publicly attacked by Joel Rickett of The Bookseller in The Guardian.[53] In 2007, with the new 'public benefit' requirement of the revised Charities Act, the issue was re-examined [54] with particular reference to the OUP.[55] In 2008 CUP's and OUP's privilege was attacked by rival publishers.[56][57] In 2009 The Guardian invited author Andrew Malcolm to write an article on the subject.[58]\n\nAlms for Jihad\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Alms for Jihad\n\nIn 2007, controversy arose over the press's decision to destroy all remaining copies of its 2006 book Alms for Jihad: Charity and Terrorism in the Islamic World, by Burr and Collins, as part of the settlement of a lawsuit brought by Saudi billionaire Khalid bin Mahfouz.[59] Within hours, Alms for Jihad became one of the 100 most sought after titles on Amazon.com and eBay in the United States. The press sent a letter to libraries asking them to remove copies from circulation. The press subsequently sent out copies of an \"errata\" sheet for the book.\n\nThe American Library Association issued a recommendation to libraries still holding Alms for Jihad: \"Given the intense interest in the book, and the desire of readers to learn about the controversy first hand, we recommend that U.S. libraries keep the book available for their users.\" The publisher's decision did not have the support of the book's authors and was criticized by some who claimed it was incompatible with freedom of speech and with freedom of the press and that it indicated that English defamation laws were excessively strict.[60][61] In the New York Times Book Review (7 October 2007), United States Congressman Frank R. Wolf described Cambridge's settlement as \"basically a book burning\".[62] The press pointed out that, at that time, it had already sold most of its copies of the book.\n\nThe press defended its actions, saying it had acted responsibly and that it is a global publisher with a duty to observe the laws of many different countries.[63]\n\nCambridge University Press v. Patton\n\n[edit]\n\nIn this case, originally filed in 2008, CUP et al. accused Georgia State University of infringement of copyright.[64] The case closed on 29 September 2020, with GSU as the prevailing party.[65]\n\nThe China Quarterly\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 18 August 2017, following an \"instruction\" from a Chinese import agency, Cambridge University Press used the functionality that had been built into Cambridge Core to temporarily delete politically sensitive articles from The China Quarterly on its Chinese website. The articles focused on topics China regards as taboo, including the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution, the 2014 Hong Kong protests, and ethnic tensions in Xinjiang and Tibet.[66][67][68][self-published source?][69] On 21 August 2017, in the face of growing international protests, Cambridge University Press announced it would immediately repost the articles to uphold the principle of academic freedom on which the university's work is founded.[70][71]\n\nThe Cambridge Handbook of Privatization\n\n[edit]\n\nIn February 2021, the forthcoming Cambridge Handbook of Privatization was found to have included a chapter by J. Mark Ramseyer in which he described Koreans murdered in the Kantō Massacre of 1923 as \"gangs\" that \"torched buildings, planted bombs, [and] poisoned water supplies\". Editors Avihay Dorfman and Alon Harel acknowledged the historical distortions of the chapter, but gave Ramseyer a chance to revise. Harel described the inclusion of the original chapter as an \"innocent and very regrettable\" mistake on the part of the editors.[72][73]\n\nCorporate social responsibility\n\n[edit]\n\nCommunity\n\n[edit]\n\nThe press undertakes community engagement in Cambridge and around the world where there are Press employees. Annually, the press selects a UK Charity of the Year, which has included local charities Centre 33 (2016 and 2017), Rowan Humberstone (2018), and Castle School (2019). In 2016, some of the press's community works included its continued support to Westchester Community College in New York, the installation of hygienic facilities in an Indonesian rural school, raising funds to rehabilitate earthquake-stricken schools in Nepal, and guiding students from Coleridge Community College, Cambridge in a CV workshop. On World Book Day 2016, the press held a digital Shakespeare publishing workshop for students and their teachers. Similarly, their Indian office conducted a workshop for teachers and students in 17 schools in Delhi to learn the whole process of book publishing.
