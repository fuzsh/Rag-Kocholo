Through continual improvements based on user feedback and growing understanding of the domain, EduNxt took on more features like assessments, communities, and different content types. The architecture also evolved from a domain-specific model to more generic structures, allowing new features to be added independently. This iterative or \"whirligig\" approach helped users become stakeholders in the technology.\n\nLecture Notes Unit4 Chapter13 users , roles and privileges\n\nLecture Notes Unit4 Chapter13 users , roles and privilegesMurugan146644\n\nDescription: Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) concepts, tailored for final year B.Sc. Computer Science students affiliated with Alagappa University. This document covers fundamental principles and advanced topics in RDBMS, offering a structured approach to understanding databases in the context of modern computing. PDF content is prepared from the text book Learn Oracle 8I by JOSE A RAMALHO. Key Topics Covered: Main Topic : USERS, Roles and Privileges In Oracle databases, users are individuals or applications that interact with the database. Each user is assigned specific roles, which are collections of privileges that define their access levels and capabilities. Privileges are permissions granted to users or roles, allowing actions like creating tables, executing procedures, or querying data. Properly managing users, roles, and privileges is essential for maintaining security and ensuring that users have appropriate access to database resources, thus supporting effective data management and integrity within the Oracle environment. Sub-Topic : Definition of User, User Creation Commands, Grant Command, Deleting a user, Privileges, System privileges and object privileges, Grant Object Privileges, Viewing a users, Revoke Object Privileges, Creation of Role, Granting privileges and roles to role, View the roles of a user , Deleting a role Target Audience: Final year B.Sc. Computer Science students at Alagappa University seeking a solid foundation in RDBMS principles for academic and practical applications.
