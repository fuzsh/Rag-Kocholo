        "text": "Meet the man from Chennai who built India's first computer company worth 400,000 CR. 1. Born in the coastal village of Moolaipozhi in Tamil Nadu, Shiv Nadar started working at 22 and landed a secure job as an engineer in the Delhi Cloth Mills' calculator division. But he was thinking of something else. 🤔 2. Working 10 hours daily, he realized this was not for him and wanted to start something of his own. He left his job with six other colleagues and started Microcomp to sell tele-digital calculators. Even though the business was profitable, Shiv had other plans. 👇 3. In 1976, India did not have computers, and the top player, IBM, was leaving the country when the government mandated 60% equity in foreign companies to local shareholders. With Rs 187,000 as an investment, Shiv started a computer company. On 11th August 1976, Hindustan Computers Limited (HCL) was born. 🚀 4. In 1978, Shiv created the first HCL 8C computer based on the Rockwell PP 8 microprocessor. It got manufacturing land and an additional 20 lakhs from the UP government for a 26% stake. HCL 8C became the first computer in India after Apple and IBM. 💪 5. Priced Rs 200,000 less than IBM's 1401, HCL 8C focused on solving the IT needs of mid-size firms. Shiv spotted a similar opportunity in Singapore and established Far East computers in 1980. In just the first year, it clocked 10 lakh revenue and was valued at 3 CR .💰 6. By 1983, it had started manufacturing 16 in-house microprocessors and developed its relational database management system and client-server architecture. And an announcement came. 📢 7. In 1984, the government allowed the import of computer parts. In three weeks, HCL developed its personal computer - BusyBee. Built on the high-demand UNIX, BusyBee became a super hit in just two years, making HCL enter the tough US market in 1989. Shiv thought he had it, but things fell apart. 👇 8. BusyBee didn't get environmental clearances. Shiv realised if he could partner with a large player, he could scale globally. In 1991, HCL partnered with American IT giant - Hewlett Packard. And magic happened. 🪄 9. By 2001, HCL had become India's No. 1 desktop company and made history with its IPO, which oversubscribed 27 times and received bids worth 20,000 CR. Shiv did not fire anyone in the 2008 global crisis and scaled to 12,565 CR in revenue and 2072 CR in profits by 2010.📉 10. HCL kept growing and expanded its operations to 44 countries. 69% of its 60,427 CR revenue in 2018 came from software businesses and 92.6% of revenue came from America and Europe, proving that India can build software for the World. 🌍 11. Today, HCL's revenue is 109,913 CR with a profit of 15,702 CR. It has 227,481 employees across 60 countries, making it worth 411,172 CR today. 💪 ➡️ Shiv Nadar continues to work with 15,000 under privileged students through his seven educational institutes. He is a billionaire with a golden heart. 🙏 #startups #india #casestudy\n\nThis commercial is a classic — because it nails a skill that EVERYONE in business needs. It takes something complex and boring, and makes it simple, joyful and memorable… And it does that by telling a story. Imagine if this company data-storage company just made an ad about its data backup capacities. ZZzzzzzzzzzzz. Instant fail. The greatest communicators turn ideas into stories, and then stories into lessons. Why? Because it’s how human brains work. We experience the world as stories — and we retain feelings better than we retain information. You want people to FEEL a problem. You want them to SEE THEMSELVES in it. No matter what your job is, your job is to be a storyteller. And every subject — even something as boring as data storage — can be a great story worth telling.
