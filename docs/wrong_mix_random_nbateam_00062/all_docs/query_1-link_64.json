        "text": "Synopsis\n\nThe purchase covers only the IT business of the firm’s oil and gas vertical which provides consulting, system integration and outsourcing services to oil majors.\n\nBANGALORE: India’s third-largest technology services company Wipro Technologies on Friday announced the purchase of a portion of the IT business of Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) for $150 million.\n\n#Budget' 2024 with ET\n\nBudget Highlights: Your 2-minute guide\n\nTax tweaks, jobs & more: All that FM announced in Budget\n\nFM 's plan for Viksit Bharat: A look at key numbers\n\nThe purchase covers only the IT business of the firm’s oil and gas vertical which provides consulting, system integration and outsourcing services to oil majors.\n\nElevate Your Tech Prowess with High-Value Skill Courses\n\nOffering CollegeCourseWebsiteIndian School of BusinessProfessional Certificate in Product ManagementVisitIIT DelhiCertificate Programme in Data Science & Machine LearningVisitMIT xPROMIT Technology Leadership and InnovationVisit\n\nThe acquisition, new CEO TK Kurien’s first major M&A deal, is expected to help Wipro gain capabilities in areas such as petro-technical data management and petroleum application services and digital oil fields. SAIC primarily supports the upstream operations of oil and gas majors and has 1,450 employees who would move to Wipro across North America, Europe, India and Middle East, as part of the deal.\n\nThe purchase is valued at approximately 0.8 times the revenue and six times the EBITDA on a trailing 12-month basis, Wipro CFO Manish Dugar said. The buy will add $188 million in annual revenue to Wipro. Margins in the business are expected to initially fall but will recover later, he said. Margins for the acquired entity stand at around 13.5% at present. “This will reach or be above Wipro’s margins in the same space in two years,” he said.\n\nThe company will use its own cash to fund the purchase. Industry watchers say this acquisition will help the company shore up revenues at a time when rivals like Cognizant are snapping at its heels and threatening to overtake it.\n\nThe completion of the acquisition is subject to the customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals and Wipro said it would be able to integrate this business in the first quarter of this financial year. The IT opportunity in the upstream business of the oil and gas sector was around $19 billion growing at 10% per annum, the company said.\n\nDiscover the stories of your interest\n\nBlockchain\n\n5 Stories\n\nCyber-safety\n\n7 Stories\n\nFintech\n\n9 Stories\n\nE-comm\n\n9 Stories\n\nML\n\n8 Stories\n\nEdtech\n\n6 Stories\n\nFor Wipro, the energy, natural resources and utility business will be 11% of its total business after this acquisition. “We have presence in this sector in Europe and APAC and they are strong in the US. So, we will be able to take their capabilities global. This acquisition will bring strong domain and consulting capabilities to us as well as large clients with big potential,” Anand Padmanabhan, senior vice president, energy, natural resources and utilities, strategic business unit, Wipro Technologies said.\n\nThe oil and energy vertical has large potential for technology firms as energy firms look to cut costs, even as the price of crude has touched $108 per barrel, after the crisis in Middle East and Libya.\n\n“When we couple this with our IT capabilities we will be able to provide end-to-end services. Upstream is the innovative part of the business and SAIC has been strong in innovation so we will be a value seller and not a commodity seller. This is a highly domain and consulting led business,” Padmanabhan added. The company has at least 10 marquee clients of which six were from the Fortune 500 list, Wipro said.\n\nWipro has made many acquisitions in the past and its much-talked “string of pearls” strategy involves buying small companies that are good strategic fits. The company has made almost a dozen acquisitions in the past decade with the largest being Infoscrossing for $600 million in 2007.\n\nIn the energy space it bought the energy parctice of American Management Systems in 2002. The BSE-listed Wipro’s shares closed at Rs 476, down marginally by 0.5%, on Friday, before announcement of the deal.\n\n#Budget' 2024 with ET\n\nWhat's cheaper and what's costlier?
