        "text": "Wipro's history\n\nWipro Technologies in India is an IT conglomerate operating in 60 countries. It was founded by Azeem Premji, who transformed it from a Vegetable Oil company into the IT Conglomerate it is today. Azim took over the company at the age of 21 in 1966 after his father's death due to which Azim had to drop out of Stanford University and return to India. It was known as Western India Vegetable Products Limited (WIPRO), Azim Premji stuck to the name of WIPRO as it symbolized what his family had started and had the aim to grow the business further and expand it into new domains while retaining its initial brand name and only restructuring it to the shorter initials, so it doesn’t restrict itself into the vegetable oil business.\n\nThe company's transformation from a ghee company to an IT conglomerate\n\nDuring the 1970s Wipro began to investigate new domains of businesses as it did not want to continue what it solely depended on for too long knowing how price-competitive and government-controlled agriculture and farming in India was, thus it wanted to develop itself into a new industrial sphere where it felt India needed direction into and therefore the idea of entering IT and Business consultancy services was drafted. During the 1980s WIPRO became the First company in India to enter IT Services after spending 10 years divesting its business specialities into different domains.\n\nWipro's success factors\n\nWipro had early planning for disruption into IT products and services thus it was able to mend its human resource policy and controls effectively for the transition into different industrial businesses. WIPRO transitioned into one domain as it started as the first Indian company to start manufacturing indigenous personal computers in 1985 as personal computers were the base of all IT services it started with it as a core business component. In 1989 it entered a joint venture with General Electric to develop and distribute ultrasound devices and other medical instruments, after establishing itself as a computer manufacturer it was able to gain leverage with international companies in building advanced solutions and local Indian market competitive pricing. In 1992 Wipro entered the lighting business to manufacture and distribute lighting products thus with that it was able to build full-scale IT Infrastructure as a business domain and add into its existing business product line.\n\nIn 1999 WIPRO Became the first Indian IT company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, creating a revolutionary domino effect for prospective Indian IT companies to explore the US IT market. In 2004 WIPRO managed to become the second Indian IT Company after Info sys to earn $1 Billion and that spoke many words beyond context for investors who want to develop the future of Indian into an IT superpower in the next 10 years. Once WIPRO's IT business became a fully functioning unit with many diversified subunits under the IT umbrella of WIPRO it decided to separate its non-IT Business into another WIPRO Subsidiary called Wipro Enterprises in 2012.\n\nHow Wipro can inspire Pakistani agri-businesses\n\nWipro provides a managerial framework for the execution of business transformation into IT for all Pakistan Agriculture businesses as India and Pakistan share similar cultural contexts of Business practices and Wipro was in no rush to become a newly transformed brand and rather took it step-by-step to become one as a whole with time as its existing customer portfolio needed to develop an interest in its newly transforming business for Wipro to make that transition and if it had done that overnight then its present consumer portfolio would have been lost as the customer would not understand the new business in another conduit entirely after understanding it differently for decades.\n\nThus, the main factors Wipro highlights here are:\n\n1) Patience of transition\n\nTransforming into a new industrial sphere as it took more than two decades to become a company operating worldwide in 60 countries as a different industrial brand than how it was initially established.\n\n2) Customer base transformation\n\nas Wipro did not let its existing customers go to its competitors while it was making its transition in fully supporting its existing business model and divested its teams into managing customers and educating them on how Wipro will change their future lives, so they become part of the business instead of just being the business endpoints of transactions. Its old customers that may have been buying vegetable oil from them in the past today might be one of their IT vendors and startups using Wipro cloud services.\n\nConclusion\n\nExplore your roots first, as Wipro initially only expanded the business to serve its Indian market base and then decided to channel its business outside India and in the process discovered new markets and clientele in International markets which were previously unknown and ended up being one of the catalysts to India being an IT superpower today whose IT exports exceed Kingdom of Saudi Arab's oil exports thus the skill and knowledge of India’s build through learning and development exceed the value of a scarce natural resource on Earth"
