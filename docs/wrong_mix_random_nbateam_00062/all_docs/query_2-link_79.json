        "text": "First and foremost, I want to express my gratitude to the Skyy Rider Institutions for giving me this fantastic chance and helping me to secure a job with the \"TATA Groups,\" a company that has long been a goal of many. When the Skyy Rider Institutions hosted a three-day course on an electric vehicle issue during my third year of engineering, that is how I first heard about them. In 2022 when I decide to change my domain from automation to E-Vehicle, I searched online for an institution that offered this kind of training and came across the Skyy Rider Institution. Without giving it a second thought, I immediately enrolled in their course. One of the nicest aspects of their programme is the on-site training, which really aids me in obtaining technical knowledge and abilities. The instructors and support staff are so well-trained that they won't let you run into any difficulties, and if you do, they'll help you work through them one-on-one. The outcome, or placement in our instance, is what matters most in any course. The institution has assisted me in every way possible, including by instructing us on how to create an engaging, focused CV and how to present ourselves. They have even set up some training interviews so that we won't feel uneasy during the actual one.\n\nNilesh Shivhare\n\nPlaced at - Tata Technologies\n\nHi there! I am Unmesh Mawalkar. Savitribai Phule Pune University is where I received my degree in 2022. I was able to start my career at TATA TECHNOLOGIES because of the Skyy Rider Institutions. I've been a part of Skyy Rider Institutions for more than two year's, participating in various online workshops and webinars related to Automotive Sector. I would like to thanks to Skyy Rider, made me believe anything is possible!\n\nUnmesh Sadashiv Mawalkar\n\nPlaced at - Tata Technologies\n\nThe course was excellent and it really made me start to think about where I'm going and how I am using the time to build my skills! Someone once said Wise is the one who devotes their time to build their future, I was just sad because I missed one and probably the most important class \" IN DIAGNOSIS \" but latter the class Recording helped me to catch up !!! I'm really thankful!!!\n\nSADRAC MIGUEL FIRMINO\n\nMECHANICAL ENGINEERING, DELHI TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY\n\nI believe The big why after doing any courses is to get something out of it and when it's about Technical course no Half knowledge should be shared to avoid any failures in future. I got exactly what I wanted from this course and after completion of this course I can say that I can crack any automobile companies interview just with little personal efforts. Thank you Skyy Rider Institute for bringing this kind of courses.\n\nNAYAK VIKASKUMAR NARESHBHAI\n\nMechanical Engineering, Parul University\n\nThank you for conducting tests on a regular basis to track our progress, and thank you for making this course so enjoyable. I feel that over the duration of the course I gained a lot of knowledge and practical strategies that will be beneficial to me, and those I deal with personally and professionally. Above all these, the Organisers were really cooperative. Thank you to all the trainers for finding out time for us and helping us to the utmost level.\n\nGAYATRI DAS\n\nCOLLEGE OF ENGINEERING & TECHNOLOGY, BHUBANESWAR"
