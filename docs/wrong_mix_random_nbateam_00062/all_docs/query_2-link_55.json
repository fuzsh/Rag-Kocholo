        "text": "Synopsis\n\nMarkowitz was best known as the father of modern portfolio theory, which he introduced in 1952 in an article published by the Journal of Finance. He broke with traditional investment analysis by focusing on combinations of assets, rather than individual securities.\n\nHarry Markowitz, a Nobel Prize-winning economist who redefined money management by showing that diversification could reduce investment risk while maximizing returns, has died. He was 95.\n\nMarkowitz died on June 22 of pneumonia and sepsis at a hospital in San Diego, the New York Times reported, citing Markowitz's assistant, Mary McDonald.\n\nMarkowitz was best known as the father of modern portfolio theory, which he introduced in 1952 in an article published by the Journal of Finance. He broke with traditional investment analysis by focusing on combinations of assets, rather than individual securities.\n\nThe theory \"dramatically changed the way nearly all wealth is managed,\" Michael Litt, a former managing director at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a 2006 paper published by the Washington-based American Enterprise Institute.\n\nMarkowitz also did groundbreaking work in mathematical programming and computer simulations. He developed Simscript, a language used to write simulation software, and co-founded CACI International Inc. of Arlington, Virginia, in 1962 to provide services and training related to Simscript.\n\nThe Operations Research Society of America honored his contributions in these areas, as well as portfolio theory, by presenting him with the 1989 John von Neumann Theory Prize. He shared the Nobel Prize in economics with Merton H. Miller and William F. Sharpe the following year for his ideas on finance.\n\n\"A good portfolio is more than a list of good stocks and bonds,\" he wrote in \"Portfolio Selection,\" a 1959 book that expanded on his theory. \"It is a balanced whole, providing the investor with protections and opportunities with respect to a wide range of contingencies.\"\n\nIn 2009, Markowitz said the previous year's equity-market plunge that accompanied a worldwide financial crisis only reinforced his belief that stocks moved unpredictably, like a \"thundering herd.\" His solution - the diversified portfolio - didn't please everybody.\n\nNassim Nicholas Taleb, author of The Black Swan, said investors who lost money in the financial crisis should blame the Nobel committee for honoring Markowitz and other economists who devised equations that made equities seem less risky than they really are. For his part, Markowitz said in a 2008 paper that the real problem was that \"the layers of financially engineered products of recent years, combined with high levels of leverage, have proved to be too much of a good thing.\"\n\n#Budget 2024 with ET\n\nNew slabs announced in new income tax regime\n\nFM 's plan for Viksit Bharat: A look at key numbers\n\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2024 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.
