My doctoral dissertation focused on experiential learning, or more specifically, the isomorphic mechanisms of transformational leadership skills development and transference through the use of metaphor.\n\nThe past 40 plus years of management/leadership experiences has afforded opportunities to observe business function pertaining to employer/stakeholder interactions, successes, and failures. My agribusiness related professional life strengthens my academic association with student professionals of widely diverse backgrounds. I believe the interpersonal insight into how professionals in other industries think and act is the core of experiential learning, and the foundation of effective classroom learning. Interestingly enough, the thoughts of business and social functions are very similar across industries and this is ever present in the online learning environment where student make-up is industry, ethnically, and racially diverse. The diversity of the adult student base aids in making the online learning experience a valuable life-long learning opportunity in the classroom and at work, that is further enhanced when combined with concepts and theory from the courses.\n\nAs a facilitator, I adhere to the highest personal and professional morals and ethics. I openly embrace new ideas and apply my efforts with the utmost diligence. I maintain a very high work ethic and welcome the viewpoint of others into the conversation. I expect the same from my students.\n\nTeaching/Instruction History\n\nI have taught nearly all manner of classes pertaining to business management and organizational leadership, including many research courses. I began my career as a regional operations manager in the agribusiness industry and later was a territory manager for a national agribusiness company. I had a private management consulting business for 10 years after this. During this time, I felt a calling toward and began teaching at some universities/colleges and quickly went full-time in an EdD in Organizational Leadership program, where I transitioned into also becoming the IRB Chair for the colleges of Psychology, Education, DBA, and Organizational Leadership. I was an Assistant Program Director for a DBA program where I managed 30 plus dissertation faculty, hired, reviewed, taught, and chaired as well. In 2007 I was one of the principal partners in a university start-up that just recently sold. I have chaired over 70 doctoral dissertations in EdD, DBA, and PhD programs. I have also chaired many Masters capstone and theses in various business programs including MSM, MBA, and Communications. I am additionally a strong APA instructor and editor having taught APA to colleagues and administrators and editing many classroom papers, capstone/ theses, doctoral dissertations, and IRB materials. I have experienced APA from the fourth to now the seventh edition. Much of what I have accomplished overlapped with me doing several of these ventures at the same time, with a great many hours spent each day involved with each venture. 😊\n\nPrior to teaching at Ottawa, Mary Alice Grosser was a practicing Social Worker for over 30 years.

The human aspect of learning appeals to me more than the memorization of formulae—although understanding them can help us explain the social and personal behaviors that make up business, management, and economics. While I believe creating an environment with known expectations is important, I also am empathetic to students and their situations since I was also an online student while working full time. I believe that my relationship with students can continue past the end of the term, and I take great pride that many former students continue our discussions on social media to this day.\n\nI engage students in the classroom by asking the second and third question, and encourage them to post answers that are thoughtful. I am very visible in the virtual classroom—I frequently post announcements and responses to discussion threads, in addition to answering emails on a timely basis. I help students teach each other by encouraging dialogue through learner discussions and team assignments. Incorporation of my professional experience as an executive and senior manager in business management, program management, finance, and other disciplines in aerospace brings practicality to the subjects. I believe that teaching is a way to give back and is an important role in society. I believe in life-long learning; it is how I initially started my journey in teaching over 25 years ago. Teaching is a way to continue my education and remain current in business academics.\n\nPersonal Attributes\n\n• Over 25 years of Teaching Experience on Ground and Online\n\n• Course and curricula development experience in Economics, Management, and Financial Analysis\n\n• Experience with Blackboard Learn+ including Ultra and Canvas Learning Management Systems\n\n• Over 10 years in executive and senior management positions in Aerospace\n\n• Diverse professional background including business management, quality, and finance\n\n• Experience as an online adult learner in doctorate program—including foreign learners\n\n• A strong focus on Quality and Customer Service—including student interaction\n\n• Process Improvement and Lean Initiative application in the manufacturing environment\n\nTeaching Experience\n\nColorado Technical University—Colorado Springs, CO 2021-present\n\nLead Faculty—Economics and Management/College of Business Management\n\no Reduced the number letter grade D and F as well as withdrawals in economics classes by over 50% in 2022\n\no Reduced the number letter grade D and F as well as withdrawals in management fundamentals class by 20% in 2022\n\no Responsible to hiring, coaching, and facilitating approximately 45 Adjunct Online economics and management professors\n\no Assist in course development for undergraduate and graduate economics and management courses\n\no Participate in various interdisciplinary boards in the College of Business Management\n\no Teach online economics and management courses at the graduate and undergraduate level\n\nFranklin University—Columbus OH\n\nAdjunct Faculty Online and On Ground 2015-present\n\n• Blended (online and on ground mix) and full online MBA and DBA courses taught in Poland, Saudi Arabia, Oman, and North Macedonia\n\no Organization and Project Management\n\no International Business\n\no Managerial Economics\n\no Business Environment\n\no Strategic Management (MBA Capstone)\n\no Member of dissertation committees\n\nOttawa University—Ottawa, KS 2015-present\n\nAdjunct Faculty\n\n• Executive MBA courses taught—Overland Park, KS and Brookfield, WI\n\no Managerial Economics\n\no Corporate Strategy\n\no Executive Practicum\n\n• Online courses taught at undergraduate and graduate levels\n\no Entrepreneurial Economics\n\no Corporate Strategy\n\no Economics\n\nDr. Debra Logan has been educating nurses for over 30 years and most recently as an Ottawa University faculty adjunct.

Business Expert Press, New York.\n\nEDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY\n\nOne of the greatest benefits of studying the field of business is that important, significant and transformative business decisions are being made every day, all over the world, and these decisions can impact not only the performance of a firm specifically but may sometimes impact global economies as well. As students of business, you are exposed to these events on a daily basis via numerous media outlets, and given the extent to which we are all connected electronically, these newsworthy business events should enhance your understanding and appreciation of business decisions from a practitioner perspective. As an instructor, I try to integrate relevant business news and events of the day/week into the course discussion as appropriate. I have always found that the learning experience is greatly enhanced when theory is explained and evidenced in practice.\n\nMy role is to serve as a mentor and facilitator to encourage students to interact with each other on a professional and collegial level through the exchange of information and ideas in a mutually respectful environment.\n\nMy college education started at a North Carolina Community College just as you are starting your higher educational journey. I completed an A.A.S in Accounting and Business Administration from Mitchell Community College in Statesville, NC.

I received by B.S. in Accounting and began my professional career in banking and finance with First Union Bank.

I made the decision to change careers and become a full-time faculty member at Rowan-Cabarrus Community College. As a life long learner, I went back to Gardner-Webb University to complete by Masters Plus Certificate in Economics. I am currently finishing my Doctor of Business Administration degree at Gardner-Webb.\n\nIn my spare time, I like to travel to different Hard Rock Cafes all over the world. Prior to the COVID-19 Pandemic, I have visited 145 different locations within the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, South America, United Kingdom, Ireland, Sweden, Norway, Holland, and Denmark.\n\nAcademic Teaching Highlights\n\nGlenda Overstreet-Vaughn, DBA, MBA\n\nTopeka, Kansas\n\nEmail:goov6@cox.net\n\nOTTAWA UNIVERSITY, OTTAWA, KANSAS CAMPUS 2015 - present\n\nAdjunct Faculty Professor and Subject Matter Expert (SME)\n\nCreate course syllabus and other material that assist in the teaching and delivery of MBA and undergraduate business strategy leadership, organizational development, entrepreneurial management, and innovation courses using the Blackboard learning management system.\n\nServe as Subject Matter Expert (SME) for business, Entrepreneurship, HR, Training and Strategic Planning.\n\nDeliver online and classroom instruction.\n\nBAKER UNIVERSITY, TOPEKA, KANSAS CAMPUS\n\n2010 - Present\n\nAdjunct Faculty Instructor\n\nCreate course syllabus and other material that assist in the teaching and delivery of MBA, MAOL and undergraduate business management, strategic management, leadership, entrepreneurship, oral communications, and written communications courses to college students using the Moodle Learning System.\n\nDeliver online and classroom instruction.\n\nCORPORATE ENVIRONMENT\n\nCorporate Trainer\n\nInstructed and facilitate courses such as team building, cultural competency, management development, human resource management, financial management quality management, systems training and other programs\n\nCertified leadership instructor\n\nCertified Human Resources\n\nCertified Human Resources\n\nProfessional Positions\n\nAVP/ Quality and compliance Manager\n\nProgram and Project Manager\n\nVP of Business Affairs\n\nBusiness Advisor\n\nPresident and CEO\n\nHuman Resources Consultant\n\nSpecific Instruction/Facilitation Experience (undergraduate and graduate):\n\nKansas City Business and Technology College – Quality Management Instructor\n\nKansas City Community College – Basic Quality Tools Application Instructor\n\nFirst Step FastTrac Business Entrepreneurial Training Administrator, Facilitator, and Business Coach– Kauffman Foundation since 2003\n\nBaker University – Business Management, Oral & Written Communications – Adjunct Faculty Instructor, Topeka Campus\n\nCity Government - Frontline Leadership Training\n\nNon-Profit, City and State Government – Strategic Planning, HR Training, Transitional Leadership Practices, Virtual Team Development/Management, Systems Training, Quality Management, Customized training topics\n\nThe creative Organization - fall 2015 - Ottawa U (online)\n\nThe Leadership Perspective - fall 2015 - Baker MBA 595 (campus)\n\nThe Leadership Perspective - fall 2015 - Baker MBA 595 (online)\n\nPrinciples of Organizational Management - winter 2015/2016 - Baker MBA 524 - campus Dec 9 - Jan 27\n\n2016\n\nEntrepreneurial vision and strategies\n\nOttawa online Jan 11-March 5\n\nLeadership perspective Online - Feb 29-Baker U\n\nExecutive leadership - 3/10 - bakeru\n\nExecutive leadership sub 4/5-4/20\n\nStrategic management August - October 6.

Nursing is a calling to serve and care for others. It is important to integrate Biblical truths within course content in the form of related scriptures and personal experiences. Praying for students is important to usher in the Holy Spirit and help build the faith of students. Working for faith-based Universities sets an expectation for students to grow into Christian leaders. These expectations and standards allow nursing students to learn to practice nursing as a ministry, not just a career.\n\nLisa K.

He has been teaching money at the university level in both graduate and undergraduate programs for 30 years.\n\nOne of the things he is fond of saying is that the more he teaches, the more he learns. His consultancy practice is ongoing and consists of a small number of advisees, individuals and small businesses, to whom he provides investment and retirement program suggestions and ideas primarily in the context of his position as an educator.\n\nThe research which Dr. Syrmopoulos conducts is primarily in the area of Financial Literacy, studied through the prism of Behavioral Finance or as he prefers to put it, why people make the decisions they make about money.

He did, however, attend The Ohio State University (I am a Buckeye) and then ended up in Minneapolis, MN at a start-up e-commerce company in the late 1990s and early 2000s. You will remember this was the time of the Internet boom and social media was just coming onto the scene through Friendster and MySpace. He thought his stock option would make him a millionaire in 24 months but they never did gather enough traction and they stalled out at Your.Net. He learned a lot but soon moved into Mortgage Banking and then over into education in 2004.\n\nThis is my 21st year in public school education after 6 years in business. I currently work as the Superintendent at Aguila Elementary School District in Aguila, AZ. This is a small school District in northwest Maricopa County, not too far out of the Phoenix metro. I was a teacher for 10 years, Director for 2 years, and Principal and Superintendent for 8 years now. Aguila is my legacy at this point in my life; the families, students, staff and facilities are very personal to me and one day when I leave I want it to be prepared for the future and leave it better than I found it. I am on the Advisory Board at the Grand Canyon University School of Education, but I am newer to Ottawa University. I have also served as an advisor and consultant to the Arizona Department of Education.\n\nFrom an academic perspective I have an undergraduate degree in business, an M.Ed. in Elementary Education, Ed.S. in School Administration and an Ed.D. in Educational Leadership.

I grew up in Garden City, Kansas and moved east to attend college at Kansas State University (KSU)--Go Wildcats! I then moved a bit further east to attend the University of Kansas (KU)--Rock Chalk! I hold eight degrees, six of which are advanced, in a variety of disciplines including law, philosophy, ecology, Indigenous studies, philosophy, education, and more! I am presently a doctoral candidate in cultural anthropology at KU with plans to defend my dissertation research this semester!\n\nI love to learn, and I love to teach. I am most intrigued by exploring the \"frontiers\" of knowledge and discovering and exploring interdisciplinary intersections. If you are interested in reading some of my published work, please check out the link to my ResearchGate profile (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Deborah-Williams-16) which will give you open-access to my recent publications. My current doctoral research explores barriers preventing Native American student persistence in STEM. In many respects, it is my life's work as it incorporates much of my own educational training and professional experiences as a career educator.\n\nNative Americans are the most underrepresented population in STEM. I was first inspired to explore why this was (and still is) the case 23 years ago as a graduate student in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at KU. I was also serving as a Program Coordinator for a NIH-funded Grant at Haskell Indian Nations University, a TCU, in Lawrence. I graduated with a masters in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and left the Program Coordinator position to attend law school but never stopped thinking about ways to help remove barriers to Native American student persistence in STEM. In hindsight, I think I needed some \"processing time\" to fully understand and begin to effectuate change in this area! After maturing as a person, a scholar, and accumulating a variety of perspectives that my formal (and informal) educational experiences provided, I was better prepared to investigate the multifaceted nature of these barriers. Importantly, my dissertation also explores possible paths towards overcoming many of these barriers. I am excited and grateful to be able to contribute to the discourse by offering insights that literally took most of my career to develop and refine.\n\nI have approximately 25 years of experience teaching undergraduate, graduate and law school courses in a variety of disciplines including environmental science, ecology, philosophy, ethics, business ethics, bioethics, natural history of Kansas, environmental policy and law, bioethics and law, public health law and more. I always look forward to teaching and learning with my students every semester!"
