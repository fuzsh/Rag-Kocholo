I'm Saravana Kumar Murugan (Sarav) working as a Project Lead at Wipro Limited. In seven years and six months of IT life, I worked at a customer site in London, UK for a year and at a customer site in Hamburg, Germany for three years. I recently moved to Bengaluru to be with my family and also to move up in the career ladder.

My area of work has been primarily focused in the field of Application Re-Packaging and Image Engineering. I have also worked on Application Compatibility Testing, Application Discovery Consultancy, Deployment, Application Virtualization and a bit of development using C#. Wipro Technologies has recognised my work two times: Best Campus Joinee in 2010 and Technology Innovation Wipro Spark Award in 2011.

Apart from being an IT Professional, I am just another soul trying to figure out what life is. I am a creative writer at Few Miles, where I dig in my hands at writing poems and short stories. I write under a pen name "Someone is Special" as my pen name is a sweet dedication to dream angel (in dreams).

Writing is my passion and I am born in this world to express my dreams, I do so as poems and prose. I do prefer poetry as it helps me to rhyme what I love to, and attain peace. I am obsessed with love, romance, creative writing, photography, and I share my life (sometimes) in a meaningful and beautiful way.

I, along with my wife Vidhya, founded indiauthor.in, connecting authors, publishers, readers and reviewers. I love capturing life through the lens, giving life to paper with pencil, and at times, I satisfy my stomach with my own cooking.
