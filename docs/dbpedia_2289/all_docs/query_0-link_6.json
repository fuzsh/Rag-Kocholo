        "text": "Karl Eusebius, Prince of Liechtenstein (April 11, 1611 – April 5, 1684) was the Prince of Liechtenstein for most of the 17th century. He inherited this title in 1627 from his father Karl I. He was 16 and thus considered underage and his uncles Prince Gundakar and Maximillian acted as regents until 1632. From 1639 to 1641 Karl was Chief Captain of High and Low Silesia.\n\nAfter the Thirty Years' War Karl did a meritous job of economically restoring his dominions. Karl was also an extensive patron of architecture of the period.\n\nKarl Eusebius in 1632[]\n\nKarl Eusebius had turned 20 not long before Grantville arrived in Germany. Presumably, he had delayed the \"grand tour\" often taken by wealthy young men, because he found the American town while on his.[1] By 1633, he had relocated there, and was a known figure on the Grantville stock and currency exchange.\n\nAfter Don Fernando's attack on the Netherlands, he began buying Dutch guilders for reasons of his own. This caught the attention of David Bartley, who wanted to keep the guider from collapsing without appearing to be doing so. Bartley's purchases prompted Karl Eusebius to buy even more guiders, many more than he had intended. While he did not intend to keep the Dutch guider from collapsing, his actions helped accomplish that. After that, he became part of the delegation that went to Amsterdam and helped arrange the agreement that allowed the Wisselbank to continue operating.\n\nAfter returning from Amsterdam, he entered into an arrangement with the Barbie Consortium, in which he became both a client and a major backer. This led to them dubbing him the \"Ken Doll\", a label he seemed to accept with good grace."
