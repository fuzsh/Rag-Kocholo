The text of the document was hitherto published only in the works of the Hungarian historian Lajos Thallóczy. However, he did not supply an image of the charter and described it only summarily indicating that it was written on parchment and that the script was in bluish ink. Apart from that, he also remarked that the letter was composed in poor Latin and that the concept was probably created by Ruggiero, the Duke’s scribe.\n\nThe charter is of a rectangular shape and was folded twice vertically and once horizontally (not counting the folded lower margin). On the very bottom of the document a broken dark brown wax lump with a red seal image was attached to the parchment by a red silk braided cord. Even though it is very difficult to speak about the broken seal, it can be concluded that it is in fact the great seal of Duke Stjepan, for which many historians considered was preserved only on one charter of his son Vlatko from the 26th of July 1470. We can now confirm that the seal was indeed used on the official charters of Duke Stjepan, even though the seal image is almost completely destroyed.\n\nThe contents of the charter are connected to the plans of Duke Stjepan to arrange great nuptial festivities in 1455 for the weddings of his two sons, but also for his own marriage since he was a widower from October 1453. It is still an open question how did the Duke get in touch with the court in Nicolsburg, today Mikulov in the Czech Republic, and under which circumstances did the combinations about the marriage relations with the Austrian princely dynasty of Liechtensten emerge. The charter which the Duke issued together with his sons was supposed to regulate the rights of his future spouse, the conditions of their “lasting and indissoluble union”, guarantee her religious rights and allow her to have her own retinue with priests. Apart from that, the Duke also promised to present Barbara a wedding gift in the form of a castle with an income of 2.000 golden florins. In the case of his death, the charter stipulated that Barbara could sell the castle to his heirs for a hefty sum of 14.000 golden ducats. She could then freely dispose with this money in Bosnia, as well as abroad. Despite all the trouble and incurred expenses, the marriage was never realized, and in May of 1455 Duke Stjepan married another woman, also named Barbara.\n\nENGLISH The parliamentary right to investigate the government is often said to be „the sharpest weapon of parliamen-tarianism‟.

This working paper deals with the parliamentary commissions of inquiry. It compares the legal positions in Liechtenstein, Austria and Switzerland. In addition, it lists all the commissions which the Liech-tenstein parliament has ever instituted. It appears that in both Liechtenstein and several Swiss cantons, the parliament has foregone the institution of a commission of inquiry on numerous occasions due to lack of resources. Whilst the right to appoint a parliamentary commission of inquiry is a minority right in Liechten-stein, in Switzerland it requires the approval of a majority in parliament. But Liechtenstein does share with Switzerland the provision that the commission’s proceedings take place behind closed doors. In Austria, on the other hand, such proceedings are open to the media, least at the federal level.\n\nGERMAN\n\nUntersuchungsausschüsse werden oft als „schärfstes Schwert des Parlaments“ bezeichnet. Dieses Arbeitspa-pier führt die parlamentarischen Untersuchungskommissionen einer eingehenden Untersuchung zu. Es ver-gleicht ihre Ausgestaltung und Arbeitsweise in Liechtenstein, Österreich und der Schweiz. Überdies listet es alle parlamentarischen Untersuchungskommissionen (PUK) auf, welche das liechtensteinische Parlament, der Landtag, je errichtet hat. Sowohl in Liechtenstein als auch in mehreren Schweizer Kantonen wurde in mehre-ren Fällen mangels Ressourcen auf die Errichtung einer Untersuchungskommission verzichtet. Während das Recht, eine Untersuchungskommission zu errichten, in Liechtenstein als Minderheitenrecht ausgestaltet ist, wird in der Schweiz die Zustimmung durch die Parlamentsmehrheit verlangt. Demgegenüber teilt Liechten-stein mit der Schweiz die Praxis, dass die Kommissionen geschlossen tagen. Anders ist die Regelung in Öster-reich, zumindest auf Ebene Bund. Dort sind die Verhandlungen der Untersuchungsausschüsse medienöffent-lich.\n\nObject provenance is often approached as a linear chain of ownership.

Recent increasing interest and research in art market studies—the dealers, mediators, advisors, taste makers, etc.—indicate the transaction of art and decorative art is anything but linear. This volume takes as its point of departure two of the most active agents of the late 19C: the German Wilhelm von Bode (1845-1929) and the Florentine Stefano Bardini (1836-1922), whose immensely successful careers depended upon vast and intricate social and professional networks which heavily overlapped. Both men were responsible for placing thousands of objects in public and private collections throughout Europe and America. Although both Bardini and Bode distinguished themselves in terms of sheer quantity of transactions and expertise, they also defined themselves by the high quality of the objects and the sophistication of their mutual global network. On the basis of archival material, the essays in this volume examine the minutiae of the behind-the-scene aspects of object transaction within their broader context. In doing so, they offer alternative areas of inquiry for the mapping of objects as they were exchanged over time and place.\n\nClan coherences and genealogy The clan of Liechtenstein lords first occurred in our territory in 1249.

In that time margrave Premysl Otakar\n\ngave the border’s territory of Mikulov to Jindrich I. from Liechtenstein (+1266) who chose Mikulov as his main\n\nclan residency. Before coming to Moravia the clan from Liechtenstein held territory in lower Austria around\n\nthe river Zaja, and near Petronel on Danube city. It was not before 13th century when this clan gained castle\n\nLiechtenstein at Mödling after which they are named.\n\nMembers of Liechtenstein clan were from 1249 to 1945 strongly related to Moravia because it was right\n\nhere where they held their biggest manor. Apart from Mikulovsko they managed to get manor Drhnolec in the\n\nMiddle Ages. Within the Hussite wars they supported emperor Zikmund and his son in law Albrecht the Austrian\n\nwho tried to compensate huge financial expenses to the clan of Liechtenstein which were connected with war\n\nsufferings. After all, almost all 15th century was embroiled in wars - at first it was margrave wars, then Hussite\n\nwars and in the final stage Czech-Hungarian wars. The clan of Liechtenstein fell into deep economic crisis and\n\ntherefore weren’t able to expend their asset base in Moravia.\n\nFollowing 16th century this clan experienced a period of stagnation of power. It proved right especially in\n\n1504 when the clan was divided into 3 branches where the most interesting is the Valticka branch, sometimes\n\nalso called Austrian. The worst for this clan in Moravia came in 1560 when Krystof IV. from Liechtenstein had to\n\nsell the large Mikulov mansion. Since then, the clan tried to reattach their place in Moravia.\n\nAn upturn came with energetic Hartman II. from Liechtenstein who tried to overturn clan’s stagnation. In\n\n1575 he bought a mansion in Lednice which represented the endurance of the clan’s base. However, his great\n\nplans were thwarted by his death in 1585. He was succeeded by 3 sons; Karel, Maxmilian and Gundakar who\n\nmeant watershed turnover for next development of this clan.\n\nThe so-called Political Testament, written by Charles Eusebius the Prince of Liechtenstein for his son and heir around 1680 includes, among other things, a substantial, detailed passage dedicated to music at the prince’s court.

Music is not just one element of court representation\n\nhere. This key aspect, in the text of the instruction, comes with a detailed insight to possible\n\nproblems with a music ensemble, as well as with the use and character of individual instruments.\n\nThis study focuses primarily on the status of musical ensembles and musicians within\n\nthe structure of the aristocratic court, beginning with Charles I (d. 1627), through a partial\n\nanalysis of the situation at the court of his son Charles Eusebius (d. 1686) and finally brings an\n\noutline of the role of musicians and musical life with the third generation of princes from Liechtenstein.\n\nCertain continuity can be assumed, in particular, in attempting to adapt its own court\n\nto princely habits (for example, as regards the minimum number of trumpeters etc). In general,\n\nhowever, it must be stressed that the trumpeters or the trumpeter ensemble constituted\n\nan essential part of the princely court, whereas the existence of a musical ensemble always\n\ndepended on the actual needs, preferences and economic possibilities of a particular prince.\n\nFurnishings of the Prince Residence and Lifestyle of the Last Teschen Piast Dynasty in the Light of the Estate of Elizabeth Lucretia from 1653.

Five months after the death of Elizabeth Lucretia, Duchess of Teschen († 19 May 1653), the inventory of her estate was completed. A total of 635 items have been recorded in the preserved registers, which are divided into thematic groups – real estate in Teschen, jewellery, cash, luxury and common tableware, church and sacramental equipment used in the duchess’s private chapel, clothing, doyleys, bed sheets and duvets, embroidery material, armoury, harnesses for horses, etc. The total value of the secured property (excluding armoury and older clothing and equipment) amounted to almost 36,000 Reichsthalers. This part of the estate was taken over in 1658 as the property of the Emperor by the Upper Silesian Office (Oberamt) in Wrocław. Thanks to a comparison with other known records regarding estates from that time, it is obvious that the material equipment of the residences of the dukes in Teschen Silesia corresponded to their higher social status. Also, the quality and quantity of the estate was comparable to those of other wealthy aristocratic dynasties, such as other Silesian princes, influential Bohemian-Moravian noble families and some princes of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nThe paper is an attempt to analyse the functioning of the political system of monarchy and microstate in the conditions of modern processes of integration and globalisation with which we are dealing in Europe.

The author attempts to analyse the functioning of the state based on an interview with the main political actor of the Duchy – HSH Alois, who since 2004, under Article 13 bis of the Constitution of the Principality, fulfils the duties of head of state. The author is also tries to draw attention to the specific features of the political system of Liechtenstein. L iechtenstein is a monarchy which is certainly unique on the European scale. The specificity of the structure of the political system of this country manifests itself in the strong political position of the head of state. This State remains, next to Monaco and the Vatican City State, as the last monarchy on the European continent , in which the monarch plays an important role in ongoing political life and does not play only a symbolic function, as with the monarchies of Scandinavia or, as is the case in recent decades, also in the Benelux monarchies (Marxer, 2013, p. 65; Foulkes, 2012). In view of the process of democratisation of the modern monarchy after the constitutional referendum in 2003, the citizens of Liechtenstein consolidated their specific system based on relatively strong princely power and agreed to create unique, specific constitutional institutions such as, among others, the possibility of the monarch receiving a vote of no confidence from the citizens. The paper is an attempt to answer the question of how a modern state-monarchy with a specific structure (both in its territorial and organisational dimensions, i.e. in the structure of the political system) can fulfil the requirements of a democratic state.\n\nThis study presents the life of Prince Moritz Liechtenstein, who had a significant military career during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, on the occasion of 200th anniversary of his death.

In 1793 he became First Lieutenant. In the same year, he istinguished himself at the siege of Valenciennes.\n\nIn 1794 he was promoted to Second Rittmeister (namely second Cavalry Captain).\n\nHe was appointed to Archduke Charles as an aide-de-camp and the same time he was promoted to Major in 1796. In 1798 he was deployed to the Motschlitz’s Uhlan\n\nVolunteer Corps, which was soon reformed to the regular 2nd Uhlan Regiment. In that year, he promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel, and he became Colonel and commander of his regiment in 1800. During the 1799 and 1800 campaigns, he distinguished himself on many occasions, and he was awarded the Knight's Cross of\n\nthe Military Order of Maria Theresa in 1801. Between 1803 and 1805 he was on permanent leave and went on a long tour of France and Italy. He was promoted to Major General in 1805. Prior to the capitulation of Ulm, he participated in negotiations with Napoleon. At the beginning of the 1809 campaign, he distinguished himself in a battle of Teugn–Hausen, but he was also wounded. In May 1809 he was promoted to Lieutenant-General, and in the same year he became the owner of the 6th Cuirassier Regiment. As a division commander he fought in the Battle of Wagram.\n\nDuring the War of Liberation of 1813 – 14 he was the commander of the 1st Light Division, which was participated in the battles of Dresden and Leipzig, as well\n\nas in the 1814 French campaign. This year Frederick William III awarded the First Class of Prussian Order of the Red Eagle to him.\n\nAfter the War of Liberation Prince Moritz von Liechtenstein went to a permanent leave and he did not return to the military service, since he died in Vienna on March 24, 1819 after five months of illness. As for his private life, he was married in 1806 to the wealthy Hungarian magnate Prince Nikolaus Esterházy II's daughter, the beautiful and educated Leopoldine. Three of their five children, Eleonore, Leopoldine and Maria – their\n\nthree daughters – have reached adulthood. Together with his wife, they had a real commitment to the arts. This was also manifested in their personal relationships.\n\nFor example they had a cordial relationship with the poet giant, Goethe or the great sculptor of their time, Antonio Canova."
