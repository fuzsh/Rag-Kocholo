Prince Hans-Adam II entrusts his son H.S.H. Hereditary Prince Alois as his representative with the exercise of all sovereign rights pertaining to him, in accordance with the Liechtenstein Constitution.\n\nPrince Hans Adam II was born on 14 February 1945 as the eldest son of Prince Hanz Joseph II of Liechtenstein and Princess Gina. The name Hans Adam forms an appropriate link between the past and present. Prince Hans-Adam I, who reigned from 1699 to 1712, was the founder of the Principality Liechtenstein, thanks to his purchases of the Lordship of Schellenberg (1699) and the County of Vaduz (1712).\n\nPrince Hans-Adam II and his four brothers and sisters grew up with their parents at Vaduz Castle. He attended primary school in Vaduz and joined the Vaduz scout troop. Like his father before him, Prince Hans Adam II then entered the Schottengymnasium high school in Vienna in 1956.\n\nIn 1960 he transferred to the Gymnasium (high school) in Zuoz, where he graduated with both the Swiss and German high school diplomas in 1965. Afterwards, Prince Hans Adam II worked as a trainee at a bank in London. In addition to his native tongue, German, the Prince speaks English and French.\n\nIn the autumn of 1965, Prince Hans Adam II began his business and economics studies at the University of St. Gallen. He completed his studies in 1969 with a Licentiate.\n\nOn 30 July 1967, Prince Hans Adam II married Countess Marie Kinsky of Wchinitz and Tettau (born 14 April 1940 in Prague). They have four children\n\nHereditary Prince Alois, born 11 June 1968\n\nPrince Maximilian, born 16 May 1969\n\nPrince Constantin, born 15 March 1972\n\nPrincess Tatjana, born 10 April 1973\n\nIn 1970, Reigning Prince Franz Josef II entrusted his son with the reorganization of the administration of the assets of the Princely House. In the course of the reorganization, the private assets of the Reigning Prince were consolidated in the Princely Funds.\n\nIn 1984, the 45th year of his reign, Prince Franz Josef II appointed Prince Hans Adam II as his permanent representative and conferred upon him the mandate to administer the business of the State, in accordance with article 13 of the Constitution. On 13 November 1989, upon the death of his father Prince Franz Josef II, Prince Hans Adam II assumed the regency. Already during his time as the Reigning Prince's representative, Prince Hans Adam II was particularly engaged on behalf of an independent Liechtenstein foreign policy. Under his leadership, Liechtenstein succeeded in joining the UN in 1990 and the EEA in 1995.\n\n© Government Spokesperson’s Office • 9490 Vaduz • office@liechtenstein.li\n\n1.

The family was expelled in 1945 like many others from the former Czechoslovakia and fled to Germany.\n\nAfter the family's escape from Czechoslovakia, Princess Marie attended primary school in Ering am Inn from 1946 to 1950. She then went to the boarding school of the Lioba Sisters in the Wald Cloister in Württemberg for eight years, graduating from the Realgymnasium (high school).\n\nIn 1957, she spent an extended period of time in England in order to study the English language. For six semesters, she attended the Academy of Applied Arts, from where she graduated with a diploma.\n\nAfter a short stay in Paris to improve her knowledge of French, she worked as a commercial artist for a printer in Dachau until her engagement in 1965.\n\nThe interests of the Princess focus mostly on the social institutions of the country.\n\nShe is President of the Liechtenstein Red Cross and President of the Society for Therapeutic-Pedagogical Aid.\n\nShe is also interested in arts and culture and is engaged in matters relating to education and upbringing.\n\nThrough their participation in all sorts of public events, the Prince and the Princess demonstrate their deep bond with Liechtenstein and their interest in the political, economic, cultural and sporting development of the Principality.\n\n© Government Spokesperson’s Office • 9490 Vaduz • office@liechtenstein.li\n\nAttachments\n\nmarie.jpg\n\nmarieb.jpg\n\nOP\n\nOP\n\nMandy\n\nMajesty\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 20, 2003\n\nMessages\n\n6,920\n\nCountry\n\nUnited States\n\nPrince Hans-Adam & Princess Marie\n\nWelcome to Part 1 of the Prince Hans-Adam and Princess Marie thread where you may post news, pictures, comments and articles.

Happy Anniversary!\n\nMarie was a lovely bride! I wonder who is in possession of that tiara? That's not the Kinsky that the more recent brides of Liechtenstein have worn.\n\nThe tiara is the Liechtenstein Fringe Tiara which was frequently worn by Princess Gina. It was not seen for a long time as Princess Marie almost never wears a Tiara on of the only times was the Wedding-Gala of Alois and Sophie at Nymphenburg in 1993. Perhaps Hereditary princess Sophie will wear it at the pre-wedding Gala of her sister Maria Anna in September. At the wedding Gala for her sister Elisabeth in 2004 she wore the Kinsky Tiara.\n\nIt seems that it is also not in the posession of Prince Philipp because his daughter-in-law astrid wore no tiara at her Wedding Day a few years ago.\n\nHRH Kerry\n\nRoyal Highness\n\nJoined\n\nOct 6, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n1,623\n\nCity\n\nUp the street,hang a left,3rd house from the corner\n\nCountry\n\nUnited States\n\nThanks for the info, Stefan.

I absolutely loved the way we're misled by journalistic leads. The purchase happened a couple of years back but refers to how the J&J heiress is still selling off priceless works of art. I'm glad I ran across the article since I had no idea that the family owned any such piece especially for 19 million pounds!"
