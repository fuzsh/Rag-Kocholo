        "text": "by Susan Flantzer\n\n© Unofficial Royalty 2021\n\nBorn on April 11, 1611, Karl Eusebius, Prince of Liechtenstein, was the fourth of the four children and the second but the only surviving son of Karl I, the first Prince of Liechtenstein and Baroness Anna Maria von Boskowitz and Černahora (1575 – 1625).\n\nKarl Eusebius had three older siblings:\n\nPrincess Anna Maria Franziska (1601 – 1640), married Maximilian, 2nd Prince of Dietrichstein, had thirteen children\n\nPrincess Franziska Barbara (1604 – 1655), married Wenzel Werner of T’Serclaes, Count of Tilly, had nine children\n\nPrince Heinrich (died young)\n\nWhen Karl Eusebius was fifteen years old, his father died on February 12, 1627, and he became the second Prince of Liechtenstein. He was considered underage, and his paternal uncles Maxilimilan of Liechtenstein and Gundakar of Liechtenstein acted as regents until he turned twenty-one in 1632.\n\nOn August 6, 1644, Karl Eusebius married his niece Johanna Beatrix of Dietrichstein (circa 1625 – 1676), the daughter of his sister Princess Anna Maria Franziska of Liechtenstein and Maximilian, 2nd Prince of Dietrichstein. Johanna Beatrix predeceased Karl Eusebius, dying on March 26, 1676. She was buried in the Old Crypt at Chuch of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary in Vranov, Moravia, now in the Czech Republic.\n\nKarl Eusebius and Johanna Beatrix had nine children:\n\nPrincess Eleonora Maria of Liechtenstein (1647 – 1704), married Prince Johann Seyfried von Eggenberg, had seven children\n\nPrincess Anna Maria of Liechtenstein (1648 – 1654), died in childhood\n\nPrincess Maria Theresia of Liechtenstein (1649 – 1716), married James Leslie, 2nd Count Leslie of the Holy Roman Empire (his father was a Scottish lord, Alexander Leslie, 14th Baron of Balquhain, 1st Count of the Holy Roman Empire), had one son\n\nPrincess Johanna Beatrix of Liechtenstein (1650 – 1672), married her second cousin Prince Maximilian of Liechtenstein, had two children\n\nPrince Franz Dominik Eusebius of Liechtenstein (born and died 1652), died in infancy\n\nPrince Karl Joseph of Liechtenstein (born and died 1652), died in infancy\n\nPrince Franz Eusebius Wenzel of Liechtenstein (1654 – 1655), died in infancy\n\nPrincess Cäcilie of Liechtenstein (born and died 1655), died in infancy\n\nHans-Adam I, Prince of Liechtenstein (1657–1712), married his first cousin Princess Edmunda Maria Theresia of Dietrichstein, had seven children\n\nThe devastating Thirty Years War (1618 – 1648) was still occurring during Karl Eusebius’ reign. It is considered one of the most destructive wars in European history with death estimates ranging from 4.5 to 8 million. Some areas of Germany had population declines of over 50%. The war was a continuation of the German religious struggle started by the Reformation, but it also involved the struggle for dominance between the Habsburgs in Austria and Spain and the Bourbons in France. Karl Eusebius I successfully consolidated and rebuilt the House of Liechtenstein territories devastated by the Thirty Years’ War.\n\nDescent from the Cross, commissioned by Karl Eusebius, created by Adam Lenckhardt, the official sculptor of Karl Eusebius’ court\n\nKarl Eusebius began to invest in a personal art collection and became one of the preeminent Central European art collectors of his time. He acquired and commissioned paintings, statues, and other artworks, laying the foundation for the Liechtenstein Museum, formerly a private art museum in Vienna, Austria. It has not been run as a museum since 2012 and is now called Palais Liechtenstein. The Palais Liechtenstein remains home to part of the private art collection of the Princely House of Liechtenstein, one of the largest private collections in the world, started by Karl Eusebius, and is available for visit by booked guided tours.\n\nKarl Eusebius was famous all over Europe for his horse breeding. He showed a strong interest in architecture with his influence in the design of the park at Lednice Castle, now in the Czech Republic (link in German), and in his treatise on architectural theory, an important source for the understanding of royal and aristocratic builders of the 17th century.\n\nAfter a reign of 57 years, Karl Eusebius, Prince of Liechtenstein died at the age of 72, on April 5, 1684, at Kostelec Castle in Schwarzkosteletz, now Kostelec nad Černými lesy in the Czech Republic. He was buried in the Old Crypt at Chuch of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary in Vranov, Moravia, now in the Czech Republic. Karl Eusebius left his son and successor Hans-Adam I, Prince of Liechtenstein a rich inheritance and an extensive collection of artworks that were multiplied by his son and other descendants. The current Princely Family of Liechtenstein is the second richest European royal family after the Grand Ducal Family of Luxembourg.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.
