        "text": "The House Law of the Princely House of Liechtenstein regulates, among other things, the hereditary succession to the throne, the age of majority and guardianship.\n\nThe Princely House of Liechtenstein has had house law regulations for centuries. The House Law in force today dates from 1993 and cannot be amended or repealed either by the Constitution of the Principality or by intergovernmental treaties. Modifications require a two-thirds majority of all members of the Princely House with voting rights.\n\nThe Prince as Head of the Family:\n\nThe Reigning Prince is Ruler of the Princely House of Liechtenstein, Head of State and Chairman of the Princely Foundations. As head of the family, the Prince watches over the \"reputation, honour and welfare\" of the Princely House of Liechtenstein according to the House Law.\n\nThe succession to the throne:\n\nThe House Law also regulates the succession to the throne after primogeniture. Accordingly, the heir to the throne is always the first-born from the oldest line. If a line expires, the second closest line of the common closest ancestor follows. This succession rule has existed since 1606. On the death of the head of the family, his eldest son assumes the duties of regent of the Princely House, head of state and chairman of the Princely Foundations.\n\nThe Prince may appoint the next prince of full age entitled to succeed him as his deputy. This may be the case if the Prince is temporarily prevented from attending or may serve to prepare the hereditary Prince for succession to the throne. In the spirit of early succession planning, Prince Hans-Adam II entrusted Hereditary Prince Alois on 15 August 2004 with the exercise of sovereign rights and appointed him as his Deputy.\n\nhttps://fuerstenhaus.li/en/princely-house/house-law/\n\nThe House Law of the Princely House (only available in German)\n\nhttps://www.gesetze.li/konso/199310...ext&lrnr=&lgblid_von=&observe_date=02.09.2021\n\nThe Princely House of Liechtenstein has a broadly diversified international portfolio of companies which form the cornerstone of the Princely Assets.\n\nThe Princely Houseâ€™s enterprises include agricultural and forestry businesses, sustainably committed holdings and an extensive real estate portfolio with castles and palaces of historical significance. Various businesses are united in the Liechtenstein Group, which is active in the business areas of agriculture and food as well as forestry, renewable energies and real estate. In addition, LGT, the world's largest private banking and asset management group, entirely owned and managed by one family, is one of the companies of the Princely House.\n\nhttps://fuerstenhaus.li/en/the-engagements/the-princely-house-as-an-entrepreneur/\n\nLiechtenstein Group\n\nhttps://www.lgroup.com/en/startseite.html\n\nLGT Capital Partners (Asset Management)\n\nhttps://www.lgtcp.com/\n\nLightrock (Impact Investing)\n\nhttps://www.lightrock.com/\n\nLGT Venture Philanthropy\n\nhttps://www.lgtvp.com/en/\n\nAs LGT explains in a press release, consolidated profit increased to CHF 223 million in the first half of 2023. At the end of June, LGT had assets under management worth CHF 305 billion, and the value of assets under management exceeded the CHF 300 billion mark for the first time.\n\nDemand for advice on equity issues at LGT remained high and the private bank was able to expand its business with clients.\n\nLGT Group's gross profit increased to CHF 1,234 million in the first half of 2023. At CHF 741 million, revenue from the commissions and services business was 5% lower than in the same period of the previous year.\n\nhttps://www.vaterland.li/liechtenstein/wirtschaft/lgt-weiter-auf-wachstumskurs-art-540413"
