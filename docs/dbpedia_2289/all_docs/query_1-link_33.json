Your information may be disclosed as follows:\n\nBy Law or to Protect Rights - If we believe the release of information about you is necessary to respond to legal process, to investigate or remedy potential violations of our policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others, we may share your information as permitted or required by any applicable law, rule, or regulation. This includes exchanging information with other entities for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.\n\nThird-Party Service Providers - We may share your information with third parties that perform services for us or on our behalf, including data analysis, email delivery, customer service, and marketing assistance.\n\nMarketing Communications - With your consent, or with an opportunity for you to withdraw consent, we\\ll occasionally contact you with news and updates from the organization, as permitted by law.
