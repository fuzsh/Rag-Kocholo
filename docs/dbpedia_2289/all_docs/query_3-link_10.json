        "text": "Are there any ceremonies when a new Prince (Fürst) is inaugurated? And where takes this inaugurations place?\n\nWhen Fürst Hans Adam succeded there was a ceremony where he and hereditary prince Alois took an oath at the National Day in 1990 (this was the first one after the death of his father in November 1989). But then the National Day bigger celebrated with a Field Mass on the meadow next to the Castle where nowaday the Act of State takes place.\n\nThis is news to me! When did they ever have a semi-Salic succession? Was it was when they officially moved to Liechtenstein in 1938?\n\nSemi-Salic succession was introduced in 1842. (I suppose it was repealed in 1993.) The article below describes some of the history of the Liechtenstein house laws.\n\nhttps://verfassung.li/Art._3\n\nThe usage of semi-Salic succession was widespread in German house laws and constitutions during the 19th century. The house of Nassau, which now reigns over the grand duchy of Luxembourg, also stipulated semi-Salic succession in its house laws until 2012.\n\nWere the house laws about marriage or membership and titles? If it was about membership and titles, that’s one thing. Can you kindly clarify which type of house law?\n\nIf you refer to the house law of 1993, which remains applicable today, you can read a full English translation of it here:\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/2016030...li/en/fuerstenhaus/geschichte/hausgesetz.html\n\nSemi-Salic succession was introduced in 1842.

You mean as in, in the event of no male heirs then female succession? These things happened in a few special cases like with the Sayn and Wittgenstein and others, but these things would typically require permission and wasn’t always guaranteed.\n\nWidespread in the German states and former Holy Roman Empire?
