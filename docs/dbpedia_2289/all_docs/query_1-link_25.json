        "text": "Monthly Archives: November 2021\n\nNieuwe Kerk (New Church) in Delft, the Netherlands\n\nby Susan Flantzer\n\n© Unofficial Royalty 2021\n\nOfficial Website: Nieuwe Kerk Delft (in English)\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Dutch Royal Burial Sites\n\nSince the establishment of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815, all Dutch monarchs and consorts have been buried at the Nieuwe Kerk (The New Church) in Delft, located in South Holland (Zuid-Holland), the Netherlands. In addition to the monarchs of the Netherlands and their consorts, most Princes of Orange after Willem I (the Silent) and their consorts were also buried at the Nieuwe Kerk in Delft.\n\nThe Nieuwe Kerk in Delft was built in the 14th and 15th centuries and was originally a Roman Catholic Church dedicated to the Virgin Mary and Saint Ursula of Cologne. In 1572, during the Reformation, the Nieuwe Kerk in Delft was taken over by the Dutch Reformed Church. Today the Dutch royal family are members of the Protestant Church in the Netherlands. It was formed in 2004 by the merger of the Dutch Reformed Church, the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Netherlands. While the Nieuwe Kerk in Delft is open for visitors, the royal burial vaults of the House of Orange-Nassau are private and not open to the public and there are no photos of the tombs. The church has services every Sunday for members of the Protestant Church of the Netherlands in Delft.\n\nThis church was the second church in Delft after the Oude Kerk (Old Church) and was therefore called the Nieuwe Kerk (New Church). The first Nieuwe Kerk was a temporary wooden church, constructed from 1381 – 1382 and consecrated on July 6, 1382. Two years later, the construction of a Gothic stone basilica around the wooden church started. On August 11, 1384, the foundation stone for the choir of the basilica was laid on the east side of the wooden church. After the completion of the interior, the wooden church was dismantled. The foundation stone of the tower was laid on September 6, 1396, by four city councilors of the city. On September 6, 1496, exactly 100 years after the start of construction, the tower was finished.\n\nOn May 3, 1536, a fire in Delft, probably caused by a lightning strike to the Nieuwe Kerk tower, caused hundreds of buildings to burn including the entire city archives resulting in the loss of recorded information from before 1536. The tower of the church was rebuilt.\n\nOn October 12, 1654, the Delft Thunderclap (link in German) disaster took place. A gunpowder storage facility located in the northeast center of Delft exploded. The exact number of people who died in the disaster has never been established. Nearly every building in the city center was damaged and buildings further away, such as the Nieuwe Kerk, also suffered damage. All the stained glass windows in the Nieuwe Kerk were blown out. In 1872, the Nieuwe Kerk tower was damaged again after a lightning strike. The Dutch architect Pierre Cuypers designed a new tower using the strong Bentheimer sandstone.\n\n********************\n\nBurial Church of the Dutch Royal Family\n\nIn 1584, Willem I (the Silent) Prince of Orange was assassinated at the Prinsenhof in Delft. He had planned to be buried at the Grote Kerk (Great Church) in Breda, where members of the Nassau-Dillenburg family, ancestors to the Dutch Royal Family, the House of Orange-Nassau, were traditionally buried, but Breda was under Spanish control. Instead, his remains were placed in a cloth-covered coffin in the choir of the Nieuwe Kerk in Delft.\n\nIt was not until 1609 that the States-General decided to build a tomb for Willem the Silent, considered the Vader des Vaderlands (Father of the Fatherland). Willem is the founder of the House of Orange-Nassau, the ancestor of the Dutch monarchs, the ancestor of British monarchs from King George I forward, and the ancestor of other European royal families. However, work on the tomb never began and in 1614, Willem the Silent’s fourth wife and widow Louise de Coligny insisted that a suitable tomb be built.\n\nHendrick de Keyser, a Dutch sculptor and architect, was commissioned to build the tomb. After his death, his son Pieter de Keyser, also a sculptor and an architect, completed the tomb in 1623. A crypt was constructed under the tomb with an entrance behind the tomb. The remains of Willem I (the Silent) were moved to the crypt at an unknown date. The crypt is sealed by a large stone cover with four brass rings commissioned by Queen Wilhelmina in 1925. On the stone cover is this inscription in Latin: “Here Willem I, the Father of the Fatherland, expects the resurrection.” The crypt became the burial site for subsequent Princes of Orange and their families and later for the monarchs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and their families. The original crypt, called the Old Crypt, was expanded in 1625 and 1752. In 1822, an additional crypt called the New Crypt was constructed.\n\nMembers of the House of Orange-Nassau visited and probably still visit the crypts but they have never been open to the public out of respect for the privacy of the royal family and because they are not suitable for public visits. The mayor of Delft is the commissioner of the royal vaults. He inspects the crypts once a year and ensures that the royal family can always visit them. The mayor opens the crypts in the presence of two members of the Dutch security service and two military police. Only sworn personnel may carry out work in the crypts. The large stone cover is only removed for burials of members of the Dutch royal family. For all other purposes, a small service entrance next to Willem the Silent’s tomb is used.\n\nThe only information about what the crypts look like comes from two drawings. In 1890, a drawing was made by a French journalist who entered the crypts just before King Willem III was interred. In the same year, Victor Eugène Louis de Stuers, a Dutch art historian, lawyer, civil servant, and politician, made a pencil drawing of the Old Crypt.\n\nOn April 20, 2021, it was announced that the royal vault in the Nieuwe Kerk in Delft would be refurbished and expanded. From Royal House of the Netherlands: Expansion crypt Nieuwe Kerk Delft: “With the burials of Prince Claus (2002) and Princess Juliana and Prince Bernhard (2004), the maximum capacity of the burial vault of the Nieuwe Kerk in Delft has almost been reached. The expansion of the royal vault means that a new cellar will be built in the south ambulatory of the church. The crypt will be connected to the existing vestibule (dating from 1925) of the current royal crypt. In addition, the crypt will have a new secondary entrance on the outside of the church, creating direct access to the crypt. In the extension of the burial vault, space will be created for more than twenty burials.”\n\nIn the diagram below, the Old Crypt is labeled with the years 1623, 1625, and 1752. The New Crypt is labeled with the year 1822 and the newest crypt is labeled with the year 2022. The area labeled with the year 1925 is a vestibule.\n\n********************\n\nBurials at the Nieuwe Kerk, Delft\n\nMost funerals of those buried at the Nieuwe Kerk in Delft had funerals at the church.\n\nBuried in the Old Crypt:\n\nWillem I, Prince of Orange (Willem the Silent) (1533 – 1584)\n\nLouise de Coligny, fourth wife of Willem I, Prince of Orange (1555 – 1620)\n\nMaurits, Prince of Orange (1567 – 1625)\n\nPrincess Henriëtte Amalia, daughter of Frederik Hendrik, Prince of Orange (born and died 1628)\n\nPrincess Elisabeth of Orange-Nassau, daughter of Frederik Hendrik, Prince of Orange born and died 1630)\n\nPrince Hendrik Lodewijk, son of Frederik Hendrik, Prince of Orange (born and died 1639)\n\nFrederik Hendrik, Prince of Orange (1584 – 1647)\n\nPrincess Isabella Charlotte of Orange-Nassau, daughter of Frederik Hendrik, Prince of Orange (1632 – 1642)\n\nPrincess Catharina Belgica of Orange-Nassau, daughter of Willem I, Prince of Orange, wife of the Count of Hanau-Münzenberg (1578 – 1648)\n\nAmalia of Solms-Braunfels, wife of Frederik Hendrik,Prince of Orange (1602 – 1675)\n\nBuried in the New Crypt:\n\nWillem II, Prince of Orange (1626 – 1651)\n\nStillborn daughter of Willem IV, Prince of Orange (1736)\n\nWillem IV, Prince of Orange (1711 – 1751)\n\nAnne, Princess Royal, wife of Willem IV, Prince of Orange (1709 – 1759\n\nPrince Georg Wilhelm of Nassau-Weilburg, son of Prince Carl Christian of Nassau-Weilburg and grandson of Willem IV, Prince of Orange (1760 – 1762)\n\nStillborn daughter of Prince Carl Christian of Nassau-Weilburg (1767)\n\nUnnamed son of Willem V, Prince of Orange (born and died 1769)\n\nPrince Frederik of Orange-Nassau, son of Willem V, Prince of Orange (1774 – 1799)\n\nPrincess Pauline of Orange-Nassau, daughter of King Willem I of the Netherlands (1800 – 1806)\n\nWilliam V, Prince of Orange (1748 – 1806)\n\nPrincess Louise of Orange-Nassau, daughter of Willem V, Prince of Orange and wife of Hereditary Prince Karl of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (1770 – 1819)\n\nWilhelmina of Prussia, wife of Willem V, Prince of Orange (1751-1820)\n\nPrince Ernst Casimir of the Netherlands, son of King Willem II of the Netherlands (born and died 1822)\n\nPrince Willem of the Netherlands, son of Prince Frederik of the Netherlands, grandson of King Willem I of the Netherlands (1833 – 1834)\n\nWilhelmine of Prussia, wife of King Willem I of the Netherlands (1774 – 1837)\n\nKing Willem I of the Netherlands (1772 – 1843)\n\nPrince Frederik of the Netherlands, son of Prince Frederik of the Netherlands, grandson of King Willem I of the Netherlands (1836 – 1846)\n\nPrince Alexander of the Netherlands, son of King Willem II of the Netherlands (1818 – 1848)\n\nKing Willem II of the Netherlands (1792 – 1849)\n\nPrince Maurits of the Netherlands, son of King Willem III of the Netherlands (1843 – 1850)\n\nAnna Pavlovna of Russia, wife of King William II of the Netherlands (1795 – 1865)\n\nLouise of Prussia, wife of Prince Frederik of the Netherlands, son of King Willem I of the Netherlands (1808 – 1870)\n\nAmalia of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, wife of Prince Hendrik of the Netherlands, son of King Willem II of the Netherlands (1830 – 1872)\n\nSophie of Württemberg, first wife of King Willem III of the Netherlands (1818 – 1877)\n\nPrince Hendrik of the Netherlands, son of King Willem II of the Netherlands (1820 – 1879)\n\nPrince Willem of the Netherlands, son of King Willem III of the Netherlands (1840 – 1879)\n\nPrince Frederik of the Netherlands, son of King Willem I of the Netherlands (1797 – 1881)\n\nPrince Alexander of the Netherlands, son of King Willem III of the Netherlands (1851 – 1884)\n\nKing Willem III of the Netherlands (1817 – 1890)\n\nEmma of Waldeck-Pyrmont, second wife of King Willem III of the Netherlands (1858 – 1934)\n\nHeinrich of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Prince Hendrik of the Netherlands, husband of Queen Wilhelmina (1876 – 1934)\n\nQueen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands (1880 – 1962)\n\nClaus von Amberg, Prince Claus of the Netherlands, husband of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands (1926 – 2002)\n\nQueen Juliana of the Netherlands (1909 – 2004)\n\nBernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld, Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, husband of Queen Juliana of the Netherlands (1911 – 2004)\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

He was considered underage, and his paternal uncles Maxilimilan of Liechtenstein and Gundakar of Liechtenstein acted as regents until he turned twenty-one in 1632.\n\nOn August 6, 1644, Karl Eusebius married his niece Johanna Beatrix of Dietrichstein (circa 1625 – 1676), the daughter of his sister Princess Anna Maria Franziska of Liechtenstein and Maximilian, 2nd Prince of Dietrichstein. Johanna Beatrix predeceased Karl Eusebius, dying on March 26, 1676. She was buried in the Old Crypt at Chuch of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary in Vranov, Moravia, now in the Czech Republic.\n\nKarl Eusebius and Johanna Beatrix had nine children:\n\nPrincess Eleonora Maria of Liechtenstein (1647 – 1704), married Prince Johann Seyfried von Eggenberg, had seven children\n\nPrincess Anna Maria of Liechtenstein (1648 – 1654), died in childhood\n\nPrincess Maria Theresia of Liechtenstein (1649 – 1716), married James Leslie, 2nd Count Leslie of the Holy Roman Empire (his father was a Scottish lord, Alexander Leslie, 14th Baron of Balquhain, 1st Count of the Holy Roman Empire), had one son\n\nPrincess Johanna Beatrix of Liechtenstein (1650 – 1672), married her second cousin Prince Maximilian of Liechtenstein, had two children\n\nPrince Franz Dominik Eusebius of Liechtenstein (born and died 1652), died in infancy\n\nPrince Karl Joseph of Liechtenstein (born and died 1652), died in infancy\n\nPrince Franz Eusebius Wenzel of Liechtenstein (1654 – 1655), died in infancy\n\nPrincess Cäcilie of Liechtenstein (born and died 1655), died in infancy\n\nHans-Adam I, Prince of Liechtenstein (1657–1712), married his first cousin Princess Edmunda Maria Theresia of Dietrichstein, had seven children\n\nThe devastating Thirty Years War (1618 – 1648) was still occurring during Karl Eusebius’ reign. It is considered one of the most destructive wars in European history with death estimates ranging from 4.5 to 8 million. Some areas of Germany had population declines of over 50%. The war was a continuation of the German religious struggle started by the Reformation, but it also involved the struggle for dominance between the Habsburgs in Austria and Spain and the Bourbons in France. Karl Eusebius I successfully consolidated and rebuilt the House of Liechtenstein territories devastated by the Thirty Years’ War.\n\nDescent from the Cross, commissioned by Karl Eusebius, created by Adam Lenckhardt, the official sculptor of Karl Eusebius’ court\n\nKarl Eusebius began to invest in a personal art collection and became one of the preeminent Central European art collectors of his time. He acquired and commissioned paintings, statues, and other artworks, laying the foundation for the Liechtenstein Museum, formerly a private art museum in Vienna, Austria. It has not been run as a museum since 2012 and is now called Palais Liechtenstein. The Palais Liechtenstein remains home to part of the private art collection of the Princely House of Liechtenstein, one of the largest private collections in the world, started by Karl Eusebius, and is available for visit by booked guided tours.\n\nKarl Eusebius was famous all over Europe for his horse breeding. He showed a strong interest in architecture with his influence in the design of the park at Lednice Castle, now in the Czech Republic (link in German), and in his treatise on architectural theory, an important source for the understanding of royal and aristocratic builders of the 17th century.\n\nAfter a reign of 57 years, Karl Eusebius, Prince of Liechtenstein died at the age of 72, on April 5, 1684, at Kostelec Castle in Schwarzkosteletz, now Kostelec nad Černými lesy in the Czech Republic. He was buried in the Old Crypt at Chuch of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary in Vranov, Moravia, now in the Czech Republic. Karl Eusebius left his son and successor Hans-Adam I, Prince of Liechtenstein a rich inheritance and an extensive collection of artworks that were multiplied by his son and other descendants. The current Princely Family of Liechtenstein is the second richest European royal family after the Grand Ducal Family of Luxembourg.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

Originally a Roman Catholic Church dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary and later to St. Catherine of Sweden, the church became a Dutch Reformed Church after the Protestant Reformation. The current Dutch royal family belongs to the Protestant Church in the Netherlands. It was formed in 2004 by the merger of the Dutch Reformed Church, the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Netherlands.\n\nThe Nieuwe Kerk is no longer used for church services and has been converted into a cultural center. Since 1980, the Nationale Stichting De Nieuwe Kerk (National Foundation of the Nieuwe Kerk) has organized the exhibtions and concerts held in the church. However, the Nieuwe Kerk is used for the inauguration of the Dutch monarch according to Article 32 of the Constitution of the Kingdom of the Netherlands which states, the Dutch monarch “shall be sworn in and inaugurated as soon as possible in the capital city, Amsterdam, at a public and a joint session of the two Houses of the States-General.” In addition, the religious wedding of the future King Willem-Alexander and Máxima Zorreguieta Cerruti was held at the Nieuwe Kerk in 2002.\n\nThe Oude Kerk (Old Church) was becoming too small for the growing population of Amsterdam. Frederik van Blankenheim, Bishop of Utrecht gave permission for a second church to be constructed. Willem Eggert, a nobleman, banker, and alderman of Amsterdam, donated the orchard near his house for the church site and was the builder and financier of the church. Upon his death in 1417, Willem Eggert was buried in the Eggert Chapel at the Nieuwe Kerk. The Nieuwe Kerk was constructed between 1380 and 1408, and the church was consecrated in 1409.\n\nFires in 1421 and 1452 caused minor damage, however, there was a major fire on January 11, 1645. Due to the carelessness of workers, the roof caught on fire and a strong northeastern wind allowed the fire to quickly spread. The roof came crashing down, burning almost everything in the church. The interior of the church dates for the most part from after the fire of 1645. Although the time of Gothic architecture was over by then, the Gothic style was used for the restoration.\n\nThe church has undergone several restorations since the 1645 fire restoration. From 1892 – 1912, neo-Gothic elements were added to restore the church to its state before the 1645 fire. Between 1959 – 1980, modern conveniences such as lighting and heating were added and/or improved.\n\n********************\n\nThe Inauguration of the Dutch Monarch\n\nThe Nieuwe Kerk during the inauguration of King Willem-Alexander in 2013\n\nAfter the defeat of Napoleon, Willem VI, Prince of Orange, urged on by the powers who met at the Congress of Vienna, proclaimed the Netherlands a monarchy on March 16, 1815. After Napoleon’s defeat at the Battle of Waterloo and his second exile, the Congress of Vienna formally confirmed Willem as the hereditary ruler, King Willem I, of what was known as the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. Today, the title Prince/Princess of Orange is held by the heir apparent of the Dutch monarch and the Dutch Royal Family are members of the House of Orange-Nassau.\n\nUpon his or her accession to the throne, the new Dutch monarch participates in an inauguration ceremony as required by the constitution at a joint session of the two houses of the States-General of the Netherlands at the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam. The inauguration is strictly ceremonial as the successor to the throne instantly becomes the new monarch at the moment the former monarch dies or abdicates. A monarch must be eighteen years old to participate in an inauguration.\n\nThe Regalia of the Netherlands and the Constitution of the Kingdom of the Netherlands\n\nThe Regalia of the Netherlands and the constitution are placed on a table. The crown symbolizes the monarch’s sovereignty and dignity, the royal scepter symbolizes the monarch’s authority, the orb symbolizes the dominions upon which he reigns, and the constitution symbolizes the constitutional monarchy. The regalia are never physically given to or worn by the monarch. The monarch, wearing a royal mantle, sits on a chair of state opposite members of the States-General and the regalia. The monarch gives an address before taking the oath to uphold the constitution and protect the people of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.\n\nKing Willem-Alexander taking the oath\n\nThe oath: I swear (promise) to the people of the Kingdom that I shall constantly preserve and uphold the Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Constitution. I swear (promise) that I shall defend and preserve the independence and the territory of the Kingdom to the best of my ability, that I shall protect the freedom and rights of all Dutch citizens and residents, and that I shall employ all means placed at my disposal by the law to preserve and promote prosperity, as a good king should do. So help me God! (This I promise!)\n\n********************\n\nSeptember 21, 1815 – Inauguration of King Willem I; Credit – Wikipedia\n\nUnofficial Royalty: King Willem I of the Netherlands\n\nNovember 28, 1840 – Inauguration of King Willem II; Credit – Wikipedia\n\nUnofficial Royalty: King Willem II of the Netherlands\n\nMay 12, 1849 – Inauguration of King Willem III; Credit – Wikipedia\n\nUnofficial Royalty: King Willem III of the Netherlands\n\nSeptember 6, 1891 – Inauguration of Queen Wilhelmina; Credit – Wikipedia\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands\n\nSeptember 6, 1948 – Inauguration of Queen Juliana; Credit – Wikipedia\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Queen Juliana of the Netherlands\n\nApril 30, 1980 – Inauguration of Queen Beatrix; Credit – Wikipedia\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands\n\nApril 30, 2013 – Inauguration of King Willem-Alexander; Credit – Wikipedia\n\nUnofficial Royalty: King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands\n\n********************\n\nWedding of the future King Willem-Alexander and Máxima Zorreguieta Cerruti\n\nWillem-Alexander and Maxima leaving the Nieuwe Kerk after their marriage\n\nOn February 2, 2002, King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands, then The Prince of Orange and heir to the Dutch throne, married Máxima Zorreguieta Cerruti in a civil ceremony at the Beurs van Berlage in Amsterdam, followed by a religious ceremony at Amsterdam’s Nieuwe Kerk.

He was the eldest of the four children and the eldest of the three sons of Hartmann II, Baron of Liechtenstein (1544 – 1585) and Countess Anna Maria of Ortenburg (1547 – 1601).\n\nKarl had three siblings:\n\nMaria Judith of Liechtenstein (1575 – 1621), married Johann Joachim von Zinzendorf and Pottendorf, had five children\n\nMaximilian of Liechtenstein (1578 – 1645), married Baroness Katharina von Boskowitz and Černahora, the sister of his brother Karl’s wife, no children\n\nGundakar of Liechtenstein (1580 – 1658), married (1) Agnes von Ostfriesland, had seven children (2) Elizabeth Lucretia, Duchess of Cieszyn, had three children\n\nIn 1590, Karl married Baroness Anna Maria von Boskowitz and Černahora (1575 – 1625), a Moravian noblewoman, the daughter of Baron Johann von Boskowitz and Černahora and Baroness Anna von Kraigk.\n\nKarl and Anna Maria had four children:\n\nPrincess Anna Maria Franziska (1601 – 1640), married Maximilian, 2nd Prince of Dietrichstein, had eight children\n\nPrincess Franziska Barbara (1604 – 1655), married Wenzel Werner of T’Serclaes, Count of Tilly, had nine children\n\nPrince Heinrich (died young)\n\nKarl Eusebius, Prince of Liechtenstein (1611 – 1684), married his niece Princess Johanna Beatrix of Dietrichstein, had nine children\n\nThe House of Liechtenstein, which takes its name from Liechtenstein Castle in Lower Austria, near Vienna, built circa 1140, had ruled in the area since the 12th century. Over the centuries, the family gained land in Moravia, Lower Austria, Silesia, and Styria. Several members of the House of Liechtenstein served as close advisors to the powerful Habsburg family who were the Holy Roman Emperors from 1440 until the end of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 except for a brief period in the 18th century.\n\nIn 1592, Karl became the treasurer of Archduke Matthias of Austria, the brother and successor of the childless Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II. Karl and his younger brothers Maximilian and Gundakar were raised in the Evangelical Lutheran faith but they converted to Catholicism in 1599. That same year Karl became the chief judge in Moravia. In 1600, Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II appointed Karl Chief Steward at the Imperial Court in Vienna, Austria. Four years later, Karl was appointed Governor of Moravia.\n\nBesides being the elected Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolf held the traditional Habsburg territories as King of Bohemia, King of Hungary, King of Croatia, Archduke of Austria, and Margrave of Moravia. A power struggle developed between the childless Rudolf and his heir and brother Matthias. In April 1608, Matthias besieged the city of Prague and forced his brother Rudolf to negotiate and sign a peace treaty. This resulted in the redistribution of power. Rudolf kept Bohemia, Silesia, and Lusatia while Matthias received Hungary, Austria, and Moravia. Karl of Liechtenstein had supported Matthias in the power struggle. On December 20, 1608, Matthias raised Karl from Baron of Liechtenstein to Fürst of Liechtenstein (Prince), a reigning sovereign ruler or monarch. (Non-reigning descendants of a Fürst are referred to in German as Prinz (prince) or Prinzessin (princess.) Matthias was elected Holy Roman Emperor upon Rudolf’s death in 1612 and reigned until he died in 1619. In 1614, Holy Roman Emperor Matthias gave Karl another reward, the Duchy of Troppau in Silesia.\n\nIn November 1620, Karl and his brother Maximilian took lead roles in the imperial victory at the Battle of White Mountain near Prague during the Thirty Years War. In 1622, Karl was appointed governor and then Viceroy of the Kingdom of Bohemia. In the same year, Karl was the first member of the family to receive the Order of the Golden Fleece, a Catholic order of chivalry founded in 1430 by Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, to celebrate his marriage to Isabella of Portugal. The Order of the Golden Fleece still exists today with King Felipe VI of Spain as the Grand Master of the Spanish branch and Karl von Habsburg, the Head of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, as the Grand Master of the Austrian branch. Being Catholic is no longer a requirement to become a member of the Spanish branch. Hans-Adam II, the current Prince of Liechtenstein, is a member of the Austria branch of the Order of the Golden Fleece.\n\nKarl’s younger brother Maximilian of Liechtenstein and his wife founded a Pauline monastery and had the Church of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary built on the monastery grounds in the village of Vranov, then in Moravia, now in the Czech Republic. A crypt in the church served as the burial site for members of the House of Liechtenstein. When more room was needed for burials another crypt was built and the church then had the Old Crypt and the New Crypt.\n\nKarl I, Prince of Liechtenstein died on February 12, 1627, aged 57, at the Liechtenstein Palace (link in German) on Lesser Town Square in Prague, Kingdom of Bohemia, now in the Czech Republic, and was buried in the Old Crypt at Church of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary in Vranov, Moravia, now in the Czech Republic. Karl’s wife Anna Maria had predeceased him, dying at the age of 50, on June 6, 1625, in Plumov, Moravia, now in the Czech Republic. She was also buried in the Old Crypt at Church of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

While Amsterdam is the capital of the Netherlands, The Hague is the administrative and royal capital of the Netherlands and its seat of government. Originally a Roman Catholic Church dedicated to Saint James the Greater, one of the Twelve Apostles, the church became a Dutch Reformed Church after the Protestant Reformation. The current Dutch royal family belongs to the Protestant Church in the Netherlands. It was formed in 2004 by the merger of the Dutch Reformed Church, the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Netherlands. The Grote Kerk has not been used for weekly services since 1982. It is owned by the City of The Hague and is mainly used for cultural events, such as concerts, fairs, and exhibitions. However, the House of Orange-Nassau, the Dutch royal family, has used and still uses the Grote Kerk for christenings and weddings.\n\nThe Grote Kerk was founded in the late 13th century and the very first church was probably a wooden church. The present church was built in stages between the 14th and 16th centuries. Sources from 1337 refer to a “great church” which typically meant a brick structure. From 1420 – 1424, the 304 foot/92.5-meter high tower was built. The original brick church was built as a cruciform church with a nave and two side aisles. From 1434 – 1455, the width of the two side aisles was widened and the height of the aisles was raised to the roof level resulting in the loss of the cross shape. The resulting style was called a hall church.\n\nIn 1539, lightning struck the church tower causing damage to the tower and the church. Lotteries and collections raised money for repairs. The stained glass windows were also destroyed. Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor (also Archduke of Austria, King of Spain, and Lord of the Netherlands), the Bishop of Utrecht, and some city councils donated new stained glass windows. At least fourteen church windows received new stained glass windows in the 16th century but only two have survived: the Annunciation Window (1541) and the Emperor Charles Window (1547). The rest were replaced by unpainted stained glass windows.\n\nSpeech from the Throne 2020 and 2021\n\nKing Willem-Alexander accompanied by Queen Maxima acknowledges the audience after the Speech from the Throne in the Grote Kerk on September 21, 2021\n\nThe third Tuesday of September is called Prinsjesdag (Prince’s Day, also called Budget Day) in the Netherlands. The monarch, as head of state, delivers the Speech from the Throne to a joint session of the legislature, States-General of the Netherlands. In the speech, the government indicates in general terms what government policy will be for the coming year. The Speech from the Throne has been delivered from the Ridderzaal (Knights Hall), a medieval reception hall in the Binnenhof in The Hague, the 13th-century Gothic castle originally used as the residence of the Counts of Holland. Today, the Binnenhof is a complex of buildings in The Hague that houses both houses of the States-General of the Netherlands, the Ministry of General Affairs, and the office of the Prime Minister of the Netherlands.\n\nIn 2020, it was decided that King Willem Alexander would deliver the Speech from the Throne that year in the Grote Kerk. The Ridderzaal could not offer enough space to keep an appropriate distance in accordance with Covid-19 measures. For the same reason, the Speech from the Throne in 2021 was also delivered in the Grote Kerk.\n\nRoyal Christenings\n\nThe christening of Princess Catharina-Amalia, now the Princess of Orange, who is being held by her mother, now Queen Maxima, as her father, now King Willem-Alexander, looks on\n\nJuly 1, 1626 – Willem II, Prince of Orange, son of Frederik Hendrik, Prince of Orange\n\nDecember 16, 1627 – Princess Louise Henriëtte, daughter of Frederik Hendrik, Prince of Orange\n\nNovember 23, 1628 – Princess Henriëtte Amalia of Nassau, daughter of Frederik Hendrik, Prince of Orange\n\nMay 20, 1632 – Princess Isabella Charlotte of Nassau, daughter of Frederik Hendrik, Prince of Orange\n\nJune 8, 1634 – Princess Albertine Agnes of Nassau, daughter of Frederik Hendrik, Prince of Orange\n\nMarch 29, 1637 – Princess Henriëtte Catharina of Nassau, daughter of Frederik Hendrik, Prince of Orange\n\nOctober 26, 1642 – Princess Maria of Nassau, daughter of Frederik Hendrik, Prince of Orange\n\nJanuary 15, 1651 – Willem III, Prince of Orange (later also King William III of England), son of Willem II, Prince of Orange and Mary, Princess Royal (eldest daughter of King Charles I of England)\n\nFebruary 8, 1689 – Princess Maria Amalia of Nassau-Dietz, daughter of Prince Henry Casimir II of Nassau-Dietz, great-granddaughter of Frederik Hendrik, Prince of Orange\n\nApril 11, 1748 – Willem V, Prince of Orange, son of Willem IV, Prince of Orange\n\nJanuary 13, 1761 – Hereditary Prince Georg Wilhelm of Nassau-Weilburg, son of Karl Christian, Prince of Nassau-Weilburg, grandson of Willem IV, Prince of Orange\n\nDecember 20, 1761 – Hereditary Prince Ludwig of Nassau-Weilburg, son of Karl Christian, Prince of Nassau-Weilburg, grandson of Willem IV, Prince of Orange\n\nFebruary 8, 1764 – Princess Maria of Nassau-Weilburg, daughter of Karl Christian, Prince of Nassau-Weilburg, granddaughter of Willem IV, Prince of Orange\n\nOctober 2, 1765 – Princess Luise of Nassau-Weilburg, daughter of Karl Christian, Prince of Nassau-Weilburg, granddaughter of Willem IV, Prince of Orange\n\nOctober 30, 1768 – Friedrich Wilhelm, Prince of Nassau-Weilburg, son of Karl Christian, Prince of Nassau-Weilburg, grandson of Willem IV, Prince of Orange\n\nDecember 19, 1770 – Princess Louise of Orange-Nassau, daughter of Willem V, Prince of Orange\n\nSeptember 17, 1772 – King Willem I of the Netherlands, son of Willem V, Prince of Orange\n\nMarch 3, 1774 – Prince Frederik of Orange-Nassau, son of Willem V, Prince of Orange\n\nDecember 28, 1792 – King Willem II of the Netherlands, son of King Willem I of the\n\nNetherlands\n\nAugust 24, 1818 – Prince Alexander of the Netherlands, son of King Willem II of the Netherlands\n\nMay 4, 1824 – Princess Sophie of the Netherlands, daughter of King Willem II of the Netherlands\n\nAugust 18, 1828 – Princess Louise of the Netherlands, daughter of Prince Frederik of the Netherlands, granddaughter of King Willem I of the Netherlands\n\nAugust 12, 1841 – Princess Marie of the Netherlands, daughter of Prince Frederik of the Netherlands, granddaughter of King Willem I of the Netherlands\n\nMay 12, 1938 – Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, daughter of Queen Juliana of the Netherlands\n\nSeptember 2, 1967 – King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands, son of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands\n\nJune 12, 2004 – Princess Catharina-Amalia of the Netherlands, Princess of Orange, daughter of King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands\n\nRoyal Weddings\n\nMarch 5, 1760 – Princess Carolina of Orange-Nassau, daughter of Willem IV, Prince of Orange, and Prince Karl Christian of Nassau-Weilburg\n\nOctober 14, 1790 – Princess Louise of Orange-Nassau, daughter of Willem V, Prince of Orange, and Duke Karl of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel\n\nFebruary 7, 1901 – Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, daughter of King Willem III of the Netherlands, and Duke Heinrich of Mecklenburg-Schwerin\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Wedding of Queen Wilhelmina and Duke Heinrich of Mecklenburg-Schwerin\n\nJanuary 7, 1937 – Queen Juliana of the Netherlands, daughter of Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, and Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Wedding of Queen Juliana and Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld\n\nJanuary 10, 1967 – Princess Margriet of the Netherlands, daughter Queen Juliana of the Netherlands, and Pieter van Vollenhoven\n\nMay 19, 2001 – Prince Constantijn of the Netherlands, son of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, and Laurentien Brinkhorst\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

However, he was also Prince Consort of Sweden from 1718 to 1720 and Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel from 1730 until his death. He was born Prince Friedrich of Hesse-Kassel on April 28, 1676, in Kassel, Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel, now in the German state of Hesse. Friedrich was the third but the eldest surviving of the twelve sons and the third but the eldest surviving of the seventeen children of Karl I, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel and Maria Amalia of Courland. His paternal grandparents were Wilhelm VI, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel and Hedwig Sophia of Brandenburg. His maternal grandparents were Jacob, Duke of Courland to Luise Charlotte of Brandenburg. Both his grandmothers were sisters and so his parents were first cousins.\n\nFriedrich had sixteen siblings:\n\nWilhelm of Hesse-Kassel (1674 – 1676), died in early childhood\n\nKarl of Hesse-Kassel (1675 – 1677), died in early childhood\n\nChristian of Hesse-Kassel (born and died 1677), died in infancy\n\nSophie Charlotte of Hesse-Kassel (1678 – 1749), married Friedrich Wilhelm, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, no children\n\nUnnamed son (born and died 1679)\n\nKarl of Hesse-Kassel (1680 – 1702), unmarried, served in the army, died from tetanus\n\nWilhelm VIII, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel (1682 – 1760), married Dorothea Wilhelmina of Saxe-Zeitz, had three children including Friedrich II, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel who married Princess Mary of Great Britain, daughter of King George II of Britain\n\nLeopold of Hesse-Kassel (1684 – 1704), unmarried, died of illness while serving in the army\n\nLudwig of Hesse-Kassel (1686 – 1706), unmarried, killed in battle\n\nMarie Luise of Hesse-Kassel (1688 – 1765), married Johan Willem Friso, Prince of Orange, had two children including Willem IV, Prince of Orange who married Anne, Princess Royal, daughter of King George II of Great Britain\n\nMaximilian of Hesse-Kassel (1689 – 1753), married Friederike of Hesse-Darmstadt, had eight children\n\nUnnamed daughter (born and died 1690)\n\nGeorg Karl of Hesse-Kassel (1691 – 1755), unmarried, served in the Prussian and Swedish armies\n\nEleonore Antoine of Hesse-Kassel (born and died 1694)\n\nWilhelmine Charlotte of Hesse-Kassel (1695 – 1722), unmarried\n\nUnnamed son (born and died 1696)\n\nAfter completing his education at the University of Utrecht, Friedrich made the Grand Tour, traveling in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, Denmark, and the German monarchies. He then embarked on a military career, leading the Hessian troops in the War of the Spanish Succession alongside the Dutch and the Holy Roman Empire troops.\n\nOn May 31, 1700, in Berlin, Electorate of Brandenburg, now in the German state of Brandenburg, Friedrich married his first cousin Luise Dorothea of Brandenburg, the only daughter of the future King in Prussia, Friedrich I, and his first wife Elisabeth Henriette of Hesse-Kassel. Luise Dorothea was sickly and died childless on December 23, 1705, aged 25. After the death of his first wife, Friedrich began to look for a second wife from Europe’s great royal houses. He had bigger ambitions than just being the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel. He wanted to have influence in a larger monarchy. Friedrich discovered Ulrika Eleonora of Sweden. Her brother Karl XII, King of Sweden was unmarried and Ulrika Eleonora was regarded as a possible future heir to the Swedish throne. In 1708, Ulrika Eleonora’s elder sister Hedwig Sophia died from smallpox, leaving her only child eight-year-old Karl Friedrich as a possible heir to the Swedish throne. At the age of two, Karl Friedrich had become Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp upon the death of his father in battle.\n\nAs early as 1710, Hereditary Prince Friedrich of Hesse-Kassel requested Ulrika Eleonora’s hand in marriage but their betrothal was not announced until January 23, 1714. The marriage was supported by her grandmother Hedwig Eleonora, who expected Ulrika Eleonora to move with her husband to the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel, thereby increasing the possibility that the young son of the deceased Hedwig Sophia, Karl Friedrich, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp, would become the heir to the Swedish throne. Ulrika Eleonora and Friedrich of Hesse-Kassel were married on March 24, 1715 in Stockholm, Sweden. Friedrich took the Swedish version of his name, Fredrik, and was granted the title Prince of Sweden and the style of His Royal Highness. Instead of moving to the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel, the couple remained in Sweden.\n\nIn 1718, Karl XII, King of Sweden invaded Norway by laying siege to Fredriksten Fortress. On December 11, 1718, while in the trenches close to the perimeter of Fredriksten Fortress, 36-year-old Karl XII was hit in the head by a projectile that entered the left side of his skull and exited on the right side of his skull, instantly killing him. Some historians claim Karl XII was assassinated instead of being hit by enemy fire, and that his brother-in-law Fredrik could have hired an assassin to kill Karl XII.\n\nAfter Karl XII’s death, his only surviving sibling Ulrika Eleonora claimed the Swedish throne even though her nephew Karl Friedrich, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp had the better claim by primogeniture. Ulrika Eleonora asserted that she was the closest surviving relative of her brother and was elected Queen of Sweden by the Riksdag, the Swedish legislature. She was crowned at Uppsala Cathedral on March 17, 1719.\n\nUlrika Eleonora wanted to reign jointly with her husband Prince Fredrik as William III and Mary II had done in England but the Swedish nobility rejected the notion. Frederik increased his influence on his wife and in state affairs and then reached out to the most powerful men in Sweden who soon considered a change. Ulrika Eleonora wrote a letter to the Riksdag on February 29, 1720, informing its members of her desire to abdicate in favor of her husband on the condition that she should succeed him if he should die before her. The Riksdag confirmed the succession of Ulrika Eleonora’s husband and the condition of her abdication which granted her place as the heir to the Swedish throne until her death. On March 24, 1720, Prince Fredrik acceded to the Swedish throne as Fredrik I, King of Sweden and Ulrika Eleonora became Queen Consort. In 1730, Frederik’s father died and he became Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel but immediately appointed his younger brother Wilhelm Regent of Hesse-Kassel. The childless Frederik would be succeeded as Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel by his brother who would reign as Wilhelm VIII, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel.\n\nAt the beginning of his 31-year-reign, Fredrik was an active monarch. However, after the nobility had regained some power during the wars with Russia, Fredrik was not so much powerless as uninterested in the affairs of state. The battle losses in the Great Northern War suffered by Frederik’s brother-in-law Karl XII, King of Sweden ended Sweden’s position as a major European power. Under Frederik’s reign, this had to be accepted. Sweden also had to cede land to Russia in the 1721 Treaty of Nystad. In 1723, Fredrik tried unsuccessfully to strengthen his royal authority but failed and thereafter, he never had much to do with politics. Fredrik did not even sign official documents, instead, a stamp of his signature was used. He devoted most of his time to hunting and his affairs. One lasting accomplishment was the institution of the three principal Swedish orders of chivalry: the Royal Order of the Seraphim, the Royal Order of the Sword, and the Royal Order of the Polar Star.\n\nIn 1734, Swedish noblewoman Hedwig Taube (1714 – 1744) became Fredrik’s official mistress. She was given the title Countess of Hessenstein and bore Fredrik four children. Ulrika Eleonora expressed her disapproval to her close confidant Emerentia von Düben who convinced her never to display any public reaction to the affair because it would be beneath the queen’s dignity. Hedwig Taube died a week after the birth of her daughter Hedwig Amalia. She was originally buried at Vadsbro Church. At a later date, her son Karl Edvard had his mother’s remains transferred to Strängnäs Cathedral where she was interred next to her daughter Hedwig Amalia. After Hedwig Taube’s death, Fredrik took another official mistress, Swedish noblewoman Catharina Ebba Horn, who was given gave the title Countess. Catharina was Fredrik’s mistress for only three years, agreeing to leave her position after having received a great fortune and three estates.\n\nWhile both of his marriages were childless, Fredrik had four children with Hedwig Taube:\n\nFredrika Vilhelmina von Hessenstein (1732 – 1734), died in early childhood\n\nFredrik Vilhelm von Hessenstein (1735 – 1808), unmarried, had a career in the Swedish army\n\nKarl Edvard von Hessenstein (1737 – 1769), unmarried, had a career in the Swedish army\n\nHedwig Amalia von Hessenstein (1744 – 1752), died in childhood\n\nOn November 24, 1741, at Wrangel Palace in Riddarholmen, Stockholm, Sweden, Ulrika Eleonora died from smallpox at the age of 53. She was buried at Riddarholmen Church in Stockholm, Sweden. Because Fredrik and Ulrika Eleonora had no children, Fredrik had no heir. This situation was eventually solved by Elizabeth, Empress of All Russia.\n\nAfter the death of his first cousin Karl Friedrich, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp in 1739, Prince Adolf Friedrich of Holstein-Gottorp became the administrator of the duchy for his cousin’s 11-year-old son Karl Peter Ulrich. Karl Peter Ulrich’s mother was the deceased Grand Duchess Anna Petrovna of Russia, the elder surviving daughter of Peter I (the Great), Emperor of All Russia. When his mother’s sister Elizabeth succeeded as Empress of Russia, she named her nephew Karl Peter Ulrich as her successor. Now called Peter, he married Adolf Friedrich’s niece Princess Sophie Friederike Auguste von Anhalt-Zerbst. Later, he reigned briefly as Peter III, Emperor of All Russia until he was deposed by his wife who reigned as Catherine II (the Great), Empress of All Russia.\n\nIn 1743, after the Russo-Swedish War (1741-1743) which ended in Sweden’s defeat, negotiations were held with Elizabeth, Empress of All Russia. She agreed to restore part of Finland to Sweden if her heir’s uncle, Adolf Friedrich of Holstein-Gottorp, was made heir to the childless King Fredrik I of Sweden. Thereafter, Adolf Friedrich was known by the Swedish version of his name, Adolf Fredrik.\n\nFredrik I, King of Sweden survived his wife by ten years. After suffering several strokes, he died on March 25, 1751, aged 74, at Wrangel Palace in Riddarholmen, Stockholm, Sweden, and Adolf Frederik of Holstein-Gottorp succeeded to the Swedish throne. Fredrik was buried with his wife at Riddarholmen Church.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

Monaco has been ruled by the House of Grimaldi since 1297 when Francesco Grimaldi from the Republic of Genoa, now in Italy, and his men captured the fortress protecting the Rock of Monaco while dressed as Franciscan monks. The modern Grimaldis are not descendants of Francesco. His marriage was childless, and after his death in 1309, he was succeeded by his cousin and stepson Rainier I of Monaco, Lord of Cagnes. The ruler of Monaco was known as Lord of Monaco until 1612 when the Council of Monaco recognized Honoré II as Sovereign Prince of Monaco.\n\nThe first parish church in Monaco was dedicated to St. Nicholas of Myra, the patron saint of sailors. Over the years, the Lords and Sovereign Princes of Monaco along with the people of Monaco generously gave funds to decorate and enlarge the Church of Saint Nicholas.\n\nPrince Charles III (reigned 1856-1889) decided to build a new and larger church on the original site of the Church of Saint Nicholas. The original church was destroyed in 1874 and the first stone of the new church was laid in 1875. The new Cathedral of Monaco was dedicated to Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception with Saint Nicholas of Myra and Saint Benoît (Saint Benedict of Nursia) as secondary patron saints. Sometimes the cathedral is called St. Nicholas Cathedral after the original church. Although the new building was only two-thirds completed, the first services were held in 1886. The cathedral was inaugurated in 1903 and consecrated in 1911.\n\nRoyal Christenings\n\nThe christening of Princess Stéphanie of Monaco\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Monaco Royal Christenings\n\nThis may not be a complete list.\n\nMarch 5, 1957: Princess Caroline of Monaco\n\nApril 20, 1958: Albert II, Prince of Monaco\n\nFebruary 1, 1965: Princess Stéphanie of Monaco\n\nMay 10, 2015: Princess Gabriella of Monaco, Countess of Carladès\n\nMay 10, 2015: Hereditary Prince Jacques of Monaco, Marquis of Baux\n\nRoyal Weddings\n\nThe wedding of Rainier III, Prince of Monaco and Grace Kelly\n\nThis may not be a complete list.\n\nMarch 19, 1920: Wedding of Princess Charlotte of Monaco, Duchess of Valentinois and Count Pierre de Polignac\n\nApril 19, 1956: Wedding of Prince Rainier III of Monaco and Grace Kelly\n\nRoyal Funerals\n\nThe funeral of Rainier III, Prince of Monaco\n\nThis may not be a complete list.\n\nMay 1949: Louis II, Prince of Monaco\n\nSeptember 18, 1982: Grace Patricia Kelly, Princess of Monaco, wife of Rainier III\n\nApril 15, 2005: Rainier III, Prince of Monaco\n\nMarch 24, 2011: Princess Antoinette of Monaco, Baroness de Massy, daughter of Louis II\n\nJune 17, 2020: Elisabeth-Anne de Massy, daughter of Princess Antoinette of Monaco, Baroness de Massy\n\nRoyal Burials\n\nThe current cathedral was built over the areas of the previous church and the old cemetery so that the sovereign princes and consorts originally buried at the Church of Saint Nicholas are now buried in the Cathedral of Monaco.

Born on January 23, 1688, at Tre Kronor Castle, on the site of the current Royal Palace in Stockholm, Sweden, she was the youngest of the seven children and the youngest of the two daughters of Karl XI, King of Sweden and Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark. Her paternal grandparents were Karl X Gustav, King of Sweden and Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp. Frederik III, King of Denmark and Norway and Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-Lüneburg were her maternal grandparents.\n\nUlrika Eleonora had six siblings but only her eldest brother and her only sister survived childhood:\n\nHedwig Sophia of Sweden (1681 – 1708), married her first cousin Friedrich IV, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp and had one son, Hedwig Sophia and her husband were the paternal grandparents of Peter III, Emperor of All Russia\n\nKarl XII, King of Sweden (1682 – 1718), unmarried\n\nGustav of Sweden (1683 – 1685), died in early childhood\n\nUlric of Sweden (1684 – 1685), died in infancy\n\nFredrik of Sweden (born and died 1685), died in infancy\n\nKarl Gustav of Sweden (1686 – 1687)\n\nWhen Ulrika Eleonora was five years old, her mother died. Four years later, her father died and her fifteen-year-old brother succeeded to the throne as Karl XII, King of Sweden. Ulrika Eleonora and her two surviving siblings Hedwig Sophia and Karl were placed in the care of their paternal grandmother Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp. She was quite formidable, was the Dowager Queen of Sweden for 55 years, and would remain visible in Swedish politics and society until she died in 1715.\n\nBeing seven years younger than her sister and six years younger than her brother, Ulrika Eleonora was overshadowed by her elder siblings. As the years went by and her brother Karl XII remained unmarried, Ulrika Eleonora was regarded as a possible future heir to the Swedish throne, and her value in the royal marriage market increased. Suitors for her hand in marriage included Prince Carl of Denmark, son of King Christian V of Denmark, the future King Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia, and the future King George II of Great Britain but no marriage materialized.\n\nIn 1708, Ulrika Eleonora’s sister Hedwig Sophia died from smallpox, leaving her only child eight-year-old Karl Friedrich as a possible heir to the Swedish throne. At the age of two, Karl Friedrich had become Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp upon the death of his father in battle. Ulrika Eleonora’s brother Karl II, King of Sweden suffered a horrendous defeat in 1709 at the Battle of Poltava during the Great Northern War. The Swedish defeat at the Battle of Poltava marked the downfall of the Swedish Empire and the rise of the Russian Empire. After losing the battle, Karl XII fled south to the Ottoman Empire where he remained for five years.\n\nAs early as 1710, Prince Friedrich of Hesse-Kassel, the eldest surviving son and heir of Karl I, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, requested Ulrika Eleonora’s hand in marriage but their betrothal was not announced until January 23, 1714. The marriage was supported by her grandmother Hedwig Eleonora, who expected Ulrika Eleonora to move with her husband to the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel, thereby increasing the possibility that the young son of the deceased Hedwig Sophia, Karl Friedrich, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp, would become the heir to the Swedish throne. Ulrika Eleonora and Friedrich of Hesse-Kassel were married on March 24, 1715. Friedrich took the Swedish version of his name, Fredrik, and was granted the title Prince of Sweden and the style of His Royal Highness. Instead of moving to the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel, the couple remained in Sweden, Their marriage was childless.\n\nIn 1718, Karl XII, King of Sweden once again invaded Norway by laying siege to Fredriksten Fortress. On December 11, 1718, while in the trenches close to the perimeter of Fredriksten Fortress, 36-year-old Karl was hit in the head by a projectile that entered the left side of his skull and exited on the right side of his skull, instantly killing him. The invasion was abandoned and Karl’s body was returned to Sweden where he was buried at Riddarholmen Church in Stockholm.\n\nAfter Karl XII’s death, his only surviving sibling Ulrika Eleonora claimed the Swedish throne even though her nephew Karl Friedrich, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp had the better claim by primogeniture. Ulrika Eleonora asserted that she was the closest surviving relative of her brother and was elected Queen of Sweden by the Riksdag, the Swedish legislature. She was crowned at Uppsala Cathedral on March 17, 1719, and made her formal entrance into Stockholm on April 11, 1719.\n\nUlrika Eleonora wanted to reign jointly with her husband Prince Fredrik as William III and Mary II had done in England but the Swedish nobility rejected the notion. Frederik increased his influence on his wife and in state affairs and then reached out to the most powerful men in Sweden who soon considered a change. Ulrika Eleonora wrote a letter to the Riksdag on February 29, 1720, informing its members of her desire to abdicate in favor of her husband on the condition that she should succeed him if he should die before her. The Riksdag confirmed the succession of Ulrika Eleonora’s husband and the condition of her abdication which granted her place as the heir to the Swedish throne until her death. On March 24, 1720, Prince Fredrik acceded to the Swedish throne as Fredrik I, King of Sweden and Ulrika Eleonora became Queen Consort.\n\nAlthough Ulrika Eleonora had an interest in affairs of state, she withdrew from all visible participation in them, occupying herself with reading, charity, and her many friends. In 1730, Frederik’s father died and he became Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel but immediately appointed his younger brother Wilhelm Regent of Hesse-Kassel. Ulrika Eleonora acted as Regent of Sweden on two occasions: during Fredrik’s trip to Hesse-Kassel from July – November 1731 and during his illness from July – September 1738. In 1734, Swedish noblewoman Hedwig Taube became Fredrik’s official mistress. She was given the title Countess of Hessenstein and bore Fredrik four children. Ulrika Eleonora expressed her disapproval to her close confidant Emerentia von Düben who convinced her never to display any public reaction to the affair because it would be beneath the queen’s dignity.\n\nOn November 24, 1741, at Wrangel Palace in Riddarholmen, Stockholm, Sweden, Ulrika Eleonora died from smallpox at the age of 53. She was buried at Riddarholmen Church in Stockholm, Sweden. Her husband Fredrik I, King of Sweden survived her by ten years, dying on March 25, 1751, aged 74, at Wrangel Palace in Riddarholment, Stockholm, Sweden. He was buried with his wife at Riddarholmen Church.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

Luxembourg was under Habsburg rule from 1444 – 1794 and then under French rule from 1794 -1815. At the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Luxembourg was made a Grand Duchy and united in a personal union with the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The King of the Netherlands was also the Grand Duke of Luxembourg. The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg remained in personal union with the Netherlands until the death of King Willem III of the Netherlands in 1890. His successor was his daughter Wilhelmina who could not inherit the throne of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg due to the Salic Law which prevented female succession. The new Grand Duke of Luxembourg was Adolphe who had been Duke of Nassau until it was annexed to Prussia in 1866. The Grand Ducal Family of Luxembourg was then, and still is, a member of the House of Nassau-Weilburg.\n\nThe late Gothic style church was originally built for the Jesuit College of Luxembourg, (link in French) a Catholic Jesuit secondary school for boys. The church cornerstone was laid in 1613 and the church was consecrated and dedicated to the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary in 1621. In 1773, the Jesuit order was suppressed and the school became the secular Luxembourg Athenaeum which is still in existence. At that time, the Habsburg ruler, Empress Maria Theresa of Austria gave the church to Luxembourg City.\n\nThe church became a parish church in 1778 under the name St. Nicolas and St. Thérèse, In 1801, the church once again changed its name to St. Peter before receiving its final name in 1848, Notre-Dame, French for Our Lady, referring to the Virgin Mary. In 1870, when Luxembourg became a diocese, Notre-Dame Church became Notre-Dame Cathedral and Nikolaus Adames became the first Bishop of Luxembourg. In 1988, the Diocese of Luxembourg was raised to an Archdiocese and Jean Hengen became the first Archbishop of Luxembourg.\n\nFrom 1935 to 1938 the cathedral was enlarged and expanded using the plans of the Luxembourgish architect Hubert Schumacher (link in German) who also supervised the construction. The west tower, the original tower of the Jesuit church which contains the bells, was joined by two new towers, the east tower and the central tower which stands over the transept. A crypt was built under the choir for the tombs of the Bishops and Archbishops of Luxembourg.\n\nAnother crypt was built for the Grand Ducal Family of Luxembourg. The entrance to the Grand Ducal Crypt is marked by a gate with two bronze lions on either side designed by the Luxembourgish sculptor and painter Auguste Trémont (link in French).\n\nBecause the first three Grand Dukes of Luxembourg were also Kings of the Netherlands and Protestant, they were buried at the Nieuwe Kerk (New Church) in Delft, the Netherlands, the traditional burial place of the Dutch Royal Family. Grand Duke Adolphe, his wife Adelheid-Marie of Anhalt-Dessau, and their son Grand Duke Guillaume were also Protestant and were all buried at the Castle Chuch of Schloss Weilburg, the former residence of the Counts and Dukes of Nassau-Weilburg, now in Weilburg, Hesse, Germany. However, because the majority of his subjects were Roman Catholic, Grand Duke Guillaume married the Roman Catholic Infanta Marie Anne of Portugal and their six daughters were raised in the Catholic religion. Since then, the Grand Ducal Family of Luxembourg has been Roman Catholic.\n\nGrand Duchess Marie-Adélaïde of Luxembourg, who reigned 1912 – 1919, was the first family member to be buried in the Grand Ducal Crypt after she died of influenza in 1924 at the age of 29. However, there are royal remains in the Grand Ducal Crypt that are much older. In 1945, the remains of Jean of Bohemia, Count of Luxembourg, King of Bohemia were removed from his burial place and reinterred with military honors in the Grand Ducal Crypt of Notre-Dame Cathedral. Born in Luxembourg in 1296, Jean is famous for having died while fighting in the Battle of Crécy at age 50, after having been blind for a decade. He is considered a Luxembourg national hero.\n\nRoyal Weddings at Notre-Dame Cathedral\n\nNovember 6, 1919: Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg married her first cousin, Prince Felix of Bourbon-Parma\n\nAugust 17, 1950: Princess Alix of Luxembourg married Antoine, 13th Prince de Ligne\n\nApril 9, 1953: Grand Duke Jean of Luxembourg married Princess Joséphine-Charlotte of Belgium – Unofficial Royalty: Wedding of Grand Duke Jean and Princess Joséphine-Charlotte of Belgium\n\nMay 9, 1956: Princess Elisabeth of Luxembourg married Franz, Duke of Hohenberg\n\nApril 10, 1958: Princess Marie-Adélaïde of Luxembourg married Count Karl Josef Henckel von Donnersmarck\n\nFebruary 14, 1981: Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg married Maria Teresa Mestre y Batista Falla – Unofficial Royalty: Wedding of Grand Duke Henri and Maria Teresa Mestre y Batista Falla\n\nFebruary 6, 1982: Princess Marie-Astrid of Luxembourg married her second cousin, Archduke Carl Christian of Austria\n\nMarch 20, 1982: Princess Margaretha of Luxembourg married Prince Nikolaus of Liechtenstein\n\nOctober 20, 2012: Prince Guillaume, Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg married Countess Stéphanie de Lanoy – Unofficial Royalty: Wedding of Hereditary Grand Duke Guillaume and Countess Stéphanie de Lannoy\n\nRoyal Burials at Notre-Dame Cathedral\n\nJean of Bohemia, Count of Luxembourg, King of Bohemia (1296 – 1346)\n\nMarie-Adélaïde, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg, daughter of Grand Duke Guillaume (1894 – 1924) – abdicated in 1919 in favor of her sister Charlotte\n\nMaria Ana of Portugal, wife of Grand Duke Guillaume (1861 – 1942) – Maria Ana fled with her family when the German Army invaded Luxembourg in 1940.
