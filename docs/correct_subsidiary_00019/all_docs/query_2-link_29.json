Austria Microsystems AG.\n\n\"SOC - Technology Perspective, Evolution and Challenges.\"\n\nAbstract: From the perspective of the process technologist, a SOC design is a circuit which merges the diverse functionality of multiple chips found, perhaps on a single PCB, into a single product. The PCB might be considered the system, hence the product would represent a system on a chip. Integrating a digital core (DSP or micro-processor) with precision analog circuits, program code and data storage as well as power handling/management elements can represent such an SOC design. This is often accomplished on silicon through the use of advanced Smart Power or BCD (Bipolar-CMOS-DMOS) technology which allows the integration of CMOS, Bipolar, and power devices as well as non-volatile memory and integrated passives such as capacitors and inductors. These technologies have been published extensively at various conferences and within technical journals and are most often used in the design of Automotive products. While the potential of these technologies and the sited product benefits of reduced cost, size, weight and improved reliability have been highlighted, the actual product usage of these technologies involves many circuit and device trade-offs and strong commercial considerations. Other factors in the potential productization of highly integrated technology are increasing digital content, ever-higher memory density requirements and the consideration between distributed and centralized intelligence in the applicable systems.\n\nBio: Philip Cacharelis has over 20 years experience in a wide range of process technology development areas including CMOS, BiCMOS, embedded non-volatile memory, Smart Power and LCOS microdisplay technology. Currently, he is the Director of Engineering for the Full Service Foundry Business Unit of austriamicrosystems. In this role, he is responsible for the engineering activities within the business unit as well as for the development of corporate ESD/EMC solutions. Prior to this, he served as Technology Manager for Smart Power and Non-volatile Memory Technology at AMI Semiconductor. Here he directed three groups in the technology development of BCD, Embedded Non-volatile Memory and Advanced Device technologies. He was employed by National Semiconductor Corp. (Santa Clara, Ca.) for 14 years in technical management positions for the development of Smart Power and embedded non-volatile memory technology. While at National, he also lead a team in the development of a novel liquid-crystal-on-silicon (LCOS) microdisplay technology used in rear projection televisions systems. His interest in SOC stems from the multi-function circuit design capabilities enabled by so-called fully-loaded, up-integrated Smart Power technologies. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Illinois, has published 16 technical articles and holds 10 patents.\n\nMark Barry, Technology Innovation Manager, Silicon & Software Systems (S3).\n\n\"Advanced Power Management Techniques.\"\n\nAbstract: Green products and government directives are the key driving forces behind the development of power-aware designs across the board, from portable battery power devices to mains powered applications. Advanced power management techniques such as voltage islands and voltage gating can reduce power consumption but present significant challenges to the designer in terms of design methodologies and voltage regulation to the IC. This presentation will discuss the impact of advanced power management on aspects of the design flow such as architecture, verification and physical design and will include references to case studies showing how to avoid the common pitfalls. The talk will also analyze the challenges involved in integrating voltage regulators into deep-submicron SoCs in order to provide the lowest overall bill-of-materials cost for consumer applications.\n\nBio: Mr. Mark Barry, Technology Innovation Manager, Silicon & Software Systems (S3).

Nedwill Ramsey Professor of Electrical and Systems Engineering, and Professor of Bioengineering.\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\n\n\"Circuits with Light at the Nanoscale.\"\n\nAbstract: Imagine circuit elements so small that you could fit many of them in a cell! What could you do with such optical nanocircuits? Would you be able to use them in wireless gadgets at nanoscales, like a nanoradio, that may connect our nanoworlds? Could these tiny optical nanocircuits be coupled with biological entities? The fields of metamaterials and plasmonic optics may provide road maps for such futuristic nanocircuits and wireless nanosystems. We have been developing and investigating some of the fundamental concepts and key features of metaplasmonic structures, devices, and circuits. These components may be envisioned as a tapestry of nanostructures of sizes much smaller than the wavelengths of light. This field, for which we have coined the term metactronics, addresses metamaterial-inspired optical nanocircuits and systems (N. Engheta, Science, 317, 1698-1702, 2007). . In my group, a variety of ideas for nanocircuit functions, optical antennas for beam shaping and photonic wireless at the nanoscale, optical nanoscopy, nanospectrometer for molecular spectroscopy, cloaking of particles, nanotagging and barcodes based on these optical circuits are being studied. In this talk, I will give an overview of these studies, present insights into these findings, and forecast future ideas and road maps in these areas.\n\nBio: Nader Engheta is the H. Nedwill Ramsey Professor of Electrical and Systems Engineering, and Professor of Bioengineering, at the University of Pennsylvania. He received his B.S. degree in EE from the University of Tehran, and his M.S and Ph.D. degrees in EE from Caltech.

He has co-edited the book entitled Metamaterials: Physics and Engineering Explorations by Wiley-IEEE Press, 2006.\n\nDr. Mojy Chian, Vice President of Technology Development\n\nAltera Corporation\n\n\"FPGAs at the 40nm process node and beyond.\"\n\nAbstract: As semiconductor process geometries advance to 45-nanometer and below, we face significant development challenges both from a technical and business perspective. Factors such as power efficiency and cost of development have increased in significance with each new process generation and are now dominant concerns for design teams. When the required R&D costs for each new process generation are at least 50% higher (i.e. mask costs at 45-nm are over $3M), the focus must be on first silicon to production. To keep development costs down, solving these technical issues can be overcome by using the comprehend, model and predict methodology. This in turn will accomplish the goal of realizing a return on R&D investment, meeting time to market requirements, and future-proofing devices, which allows changes to be made later. This forces an ever-increasing number of applications to migrate to from ASIC to FPGA-based designs. Additionally, experiences with 45-nm design shows how techniques such as expanded statistical simulation and methodical testing in silicon throughout the design process are helping developers achieve first-time success in their designs. From a technical perspective new design approaches and techniques are needed to address these design challenges. These key technical challenges include lower voltage headroom, increased process variability, leakage control, ESD, strain induced proximity effect, temperature inversion, and speed to power conversion. How these challenges are being addressed is the key. By closely collaborating with a foundry partner design/process challenges, significant value can be extracted from advanced process technologies. These challenges include sophisticated device modeling that consider all deep sub-micron and proximity effects, statistical simulation and modeling tools to isolate and predict local and global variability, controlling leakage through multiple gate oxide transistors, selective Vt adjustments, and selective channel length adjustments.\n\nBio: Mojy Chian is vice president of technology development at Altera Corporation. Before joining Altera, he was senior vice president of high-performance analog engineering at Mindspeed Technologies. While there, he was responsible for all aspects of IC product development, as well as leading the core technology group from 2000 to 2004. Prior to this, he was vice president of design automation and IP infrastructure for Conexant Systems, worked at Rockwell Semiconductor Systems, and spent ten years at Harris Semiconductor (later Intersil), leaving as the director of design systems. Mr. Chian received his BS, MS, and PhD in Electrical Engineering as well as an MS in Applied Math from Florida Tech. He holds two US patents, has authored or co-authored over 30 technical publications, and has served as adjunct professor at Florida Tech.\n\nGlenn Perry, General Manager - Mentor Graphics ESL and Design Creation Division.\n\n\"A ROI Model for Electronic System Level (ESL) Methodology.\"\n\nAbstract: Electronic System Level (ESL) design has enjoyed a history of success in the area of system analysis and virtual prototyping by SoC architects and software developers who needed early access to hardware. While this resulted in significant design optimization and shorter time-to-market benefits, the investment costs--primarily modeling--are significant and provide limited value to the existing register transfer level (RTL) design community, who struggle to implent and verify their latest designs. Today, models are the currency that dictate ROI on this revolutionary ESL methodology. However, these models, written at a level of abstraction above RTL, are scarce and creating them is not trivial. A collaborative approach to models and ESL methodology need to be deployed to reduce overall costs and design efficiencies. This 30-minute keynote, ideal for engineering management and their staff, will outline key strategies and available technologies, including synthesis and verification, that will enable the design community to drastically improve the ROI for an ESL design methodology.\n\nBio: Glenn Perry has served as the General Manager of the ESL-HDL Design Business Unit at Mentor Graphics since 2004. He joined Mentor in 1999 as the engineering director for system level simulation tools, bringing over 20 years of experience in the electronics industry, focused in the simulation and analysis of Systems and IC Design.

Well-known problems such as graphics and network packet processing exhibit this type of parallelism. However, even embarrassingly parallel problems can require some pretty elegant solutions. Fortunately, theres a lot more parallelism around than is implied in the term embarrassingly parallel. In fact, my colleague Grant Martin, Tensilicas Chief Scientist, coined a new term to describe this situation: conveniently concurrent. Conveniently concurrent problems surround us. Even problems formerly considered embarrassingly parallel are conveniently concurrent. Many SOCs destined for high-volume consumer products exhibit plenty of convenient concurrency. Intel and AMD are both pushing multicore processors in the PC space these days. They must because the clock-rate wars have ended due to excessive power dissipation. The same is happening in the world of SOC design. In the PC space, all of the old rules from supercomputing days are seeping in and people are searching for compilers that will decompose big problems into processor-sized chunks. We are much more fortunate in the embedded world. Abundant concurrency is arranged so that the problem naturally decomposes into several processor-sized chunks. This talk will discuss just how conveniently convenient this situation is and how these factors influence multicore SOC design.\n\nBio: Steve Leibson is an experienced hardware and software design engineer, engineering manager, and design consultant.

Subword-parallel Single-Instruction Multiple-Data (SWP-SIMD) processor provides a low-cost high-performance solution for multimedia applications. But there still exist some critical sequential algorithms that could not be improved by SWP-SIMD. Using VLIW to increase Instruction-Level parallelism (ILP) or simultaneous multi-threading (SMT) to hide memory latency is useful for these algorithms. Our newly designed 64-bit SWP-SIMD core can be partitioned into two 32-bit scalar ALUs, working as a two-issue VLIW core or a dual-core. This multi-mode parallelization capability allows more performance improvement with little hardware cost increase.\n\nBio: Sao-Jie Chen received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC, in 1977 and 1982 respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Southern Methodist University, Dallas, USA, in 1988.

Adding multithreading on top of a coherent multi-core architecture extracts even more performance by optimizing pipeline utilization in each CPU for minimal additional silicon cost. The performance boost comes essentially for free in both hardware and software, since the additional hardware threads are minimal in size relative to a typical SoC design, and multithreading uses the same SMP OS and software programming models as coherent multi-core platforms. In some applications, multithreading can reduce the need for additional processors, or may help achieve an application performance target at lower frequency and/or a smaller synthesized design.

On the other hand other types of NVM applications have been generated in SoC, MCU and all kind of LSI devices by embedded NVM technologies for built-in program storage, security or tuning data. In consequence, many types of memory technologies have been proposed to meet with and to be optimized for individual customer requirements regarding application, cost, density, performance, and so on. It seems to be diverging of NVM technologies in the embedded NVM arena. GENUSION proposes a novel NVM technology B4-Flash for code storage which achieves higher performance and reliability with lower cost in comparison with conventional NOR.

It is an ultra-miniaturized, ultra-functional, and low cost systems technology, enabled by new designs, thin-film materials, large-area low-cost processes, and heterogeneous functional integration leading to lower cost convergent system products. Such a technology is presented as achieving better electrical performance, ultra-miniaturization, greater heterogeneous integration, higher thermal performance and higher thermo-mechanical reliability at lower-than-today's organic-based hybrid packages and systems.\n\nThis technology is proposed as an R&D industry consortium in partnership with Fraunhofer (Germany) and KAIST (Korea) and includes exploratory interdisciplinary fundamental research in design and test, Si package replacing organic package, low cost TSV and stack bonding, thin-film embedded active and passive components, and system interconnections. In addition, the consortium integrates the above fundamental research into useful test vehicles to demonstrate the commercial feasibility of cost effective 3D structures, silicon packages, and all silicon modules with seamless integration of ICs with their FEOL and BEOL, as well as with package wiring. More than 20 projects are proposed in these areas. 3DASSM differs from other 3D industry programs in a variety of ways, such as:\n\n1. 3DASSM starts with the current industry problem, the high cost and low reliability of TSV and stack bonding. Here we propose several fundamental research projects to address cost and reliability, such as new fabrication methods for low cost and high density TSVs, new structures that improve the rmomechanical reliability, novel low cost solder and adhesive stack bonding methods. In addition, this research will culminate in a 3D stack bonding test vehicle and a Si package test vehicle to demonstrate the improved performance, reliability, and manufacturability of the technologies developed.\n\n2. 3DASSM goes beyond current 3D programs to demonstrate a double-sided silicon package replacing the organic package enabled by low cost TSV in a seamless integration. This test vehicle will address shortcomings of the organic package such as wiring and I/Os, thermal performance, warpage and cost.\n\n3. 3DASSM leads to next generation of wafer level packaging. This is referred to as Wafer System module in the 3DASSM. In this approach, ICs with both FEOL and BEOL are integrated with seamless integration of package wiring and cost effective thin embedded components on both sides of wafer enabled by TSV\n\nand 3D interconnections.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to design, demonstrate and commercialize a highly integrated all silicon system module (ASSM). 3DASSM, therefore, is a global Industry-Academia consortium on a global topic with potential to\n\nbecome a disruptive and revolutionary silicon module technology in the near term and a systems technology in the long term.\n\nBio: r.

Whether the DRAM is designed to be on-chip (embedded DRAM), or an off-chip DRAM subsystem, the SoC will very likely require an on-chip memory controller, and many times an IP-based memory controller is used. Understanding how to select the best IP-based memory controller for specific applications can be a complex task. Some of the obvious criteria, such as performance, area, cost, power, and latency all need to be factored in, however, using a data traffic efficiency metric (bandwidth delivery/theoretical maximum bandwidth) has proven to be the most important criteria for a wide range of applications. This paper will describe the efficiency metric and will show measurements for typical efficiency levels that can be achieved for different memory controller architectures. This will make it easier to determine where in the efficiency spectrum a particular memory controller design resides. Additionally, we will use two examples from real systems (a networking router and an image processor for a security application), to demonstrate how efficiency can be used to make system tradeoffs that can result in significant savings, lower system cost, lower power consumption, gain higher system performance, and quicker time-to-market.\n\nBio: Luigi Ternullo serves as Product Marketing Manager for Virage Logics Application Specific IP product solutions such as Double Data Rate (DDR) memory controllers.

The concept sounds simple, compelling and, in particular, one that could be automated by tools working at a high level of abstraction. If this is the case, how comes we are still seeing very little automation of SoC design?

This presentation will elaborate on these and similar unexpected failures and will include clarifications, focusing on the ESD damage created at the communication lines between different functional domains in the SoC. Through the use of IC case studies, the presentation will demonstrate the ESD sensitivity in similar designs. A product proven protection strategy and specific ESD solutions will be presented to the audience.\n\nBio: As Director of Engineering at Sarnoff Europe, Benjamin Van Camp currently leads the entire engineering team at the company.

This talk will focus on helping designers reduce their time to market in two areas: the architecture phase where all the early design decisions are made and the software integration phase which is increasingly more important as the software content of SoCs rises. Architectural exploration for SoCs is one of the most crucial stages in a systems design but its value is often overlooked and relegated to back of the envelope calculations. The design decisions made in the architectural stage however can greatly shorten the amount of work required later in the design cycle. This presentation will cover methods and applications which will enable the architect to make more intelligent design decisions and solve problems early in the design cycle where they have the most impact. Software validation is one of those no introduction is necessary problems. Everyone is looking for ways to accelerate their software validation. This presentation will cover methodologies to pull the software schedule earlier in the cycle by performing the software integration task in a presilicon manner on cycle-accurate virtual prototypes of the system. Techniques for accurate validation of hardware and software in a presilicon environment will be covered.\n\nBio: Bill Neifert is the CTO and founder of Carbon Design Systems.

There are a number of reasons for its dramatic rise in popularity and deployment, including multi-vendor support, availability as open source, and several technical advantages over legacy methodologies. This talk focuses on one specific advantage of the OVM - its ability to scale during the verification process. This scaling occurs from block to chip to system level, from one project to another, and even from one company to another. The OVM also interacts with verification components written in multiple IEEE-standard languages, including SystemVerilog, e, and SystemC. Further, the OVM has features and benefits of interest to logic designers as well as traditional verification engineers writing complex testbenches. All of these aspects will be explored in this talk, with examples of scaling taken from actual user projects. The focus is on the methodology and its application, not on particular vendors or vendor tools that support the OVM. This talk is appropriate for any design or verification engineer already considering the OVM or simply looking for a better, more scalable verification approach.\n\nBio: Tom Anderson is a Product Marketing Director at Cadence, where he leads a group responsible for all digital simulation and formal analysis products.
