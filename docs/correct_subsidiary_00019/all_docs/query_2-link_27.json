        "text": "Recently, IEEE Communications Society has developed a strategic framework based on the principles that embrace Industry's interests and priorities while integrating IEEE and ComSoc's objectives. In order to engage industry members with high value and innovative technologies, IEEE Communications Society plans to hold a series of high impact one day summits in emerging technology areas (e.g., SDN/NFV, 5G, IoT, Big Data, and Cybersecurity).\n\n5G Lab Germany and IEEE are jointly organizing the 3rd IEEE 5G Summit Dresden on September 25, 2018. It will take place at the International Congress Center Dresden located on the scenic banks of the river Elbe. The summit builds on the great success of the 2nd IEEE 5G Summit Dresden in 2017. It will address a holistic approach on 5G system design, ranging from silicon hardware, wireless, networks, edge clouds towards Tactile Internet applications. This one day summit offers a platform for industry leaders, innovators, and researchers from the industry and academic community to collaborate and exchange ideas in this emerging technology that may help in driving the standards and rapid deployment."
