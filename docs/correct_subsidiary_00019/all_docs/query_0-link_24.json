Rather, advances in design - from architecture to circuit - have to contribute substantially to power efficiency increase. For portable devices, where forced cooling of integrated circuits is not viable, the resulting power limit also has an impact on the achievable data rate and communication performance. In particular, for ultra high data rates the power limitations will have to be considered during communication system design. The assumptions of the study and how they affect communication system architectures will be discussed. A power estimation methodology for design space exploration will be presented.\n\nBio:\n\nGerd Ascheid (SM'08) received his Diploma and PhD (Dr.-Ing.) degrees in Electrical Engineering (Communication Eng.) from RWTH Aachen University. In 1988 he started as a co-founder and managing director CADIS GmbH which successfully brought the system simulation tool COSSAP to the market. In 1994 CADIS was acquired by Synopsys Inc., a California-based EDA market leader. From 1994-2003 Gerd Ascheid worked as Director/Senior Director with Synopsys. In 2003 Gerd Ascheid joined RWTH Aachen University as a full professor in the Institute for Communication Technologies and Embedded Systems. His research interest is in wireless communication algorithms, application specific integrated platforms, in particular, for mobile terminals and cyber physical devices. Gerd Ascheid has co-authored three books, published numerous papers in the domain of digital communication algorithms and ASIC implementation and is founder of several successful start-up companies.\n\n* If you wish to modify any information or update your photo, please contact the Publicity Chair at the following address."
