Grady III; Goorley, John T.\n\n2012-08-29\n\nMCNP (Monte Carlo N-Particle) is a general-purpose Monte Carlo code for simulating the transport of neutrons, photons, electrons, positrons, and more recently other fundamental particles and heavy ions. Over many years MCNP has found a wide range of applications in many different fields, including medical radiation physics. In this presentation we will describe and illustrate a number of significant recently-developed features in the current version of the code, MCNP6, having particular utility for medical physics. Among these are major extensions of the ability to simulate large, complex geometries, improvement in memory requirements and speed for large lattices, introduction of mesh-basedmoreÂ Â» isotopic reaction tallies, advances in radiography simulation, expanded variance-reduction capabilities, especially for pulse-height tallies, and a large number of enhancements in photon/electron transport.Â«Â less\n\nDevelopment and Implementation of Photonuclear Cross-Section Data for Mutually Coupled Neutron-Photon Transport Calculations in the Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) Radiation Transport Code\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nWhite, Morgan C.\n\n2000-07-01\n\nThe fundamental motivation for the research presented in this dissertation was the need to development a more accurate prediction method for characterization of mixed radiation fields around medical electron accelerators (MEAs). Specifically, a model is developed for simulation of neutron and other particle production from photonuclear reactions and incorporated in the Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) radiation transport code. This extension of the capability within the MCNP code provides for the more accurate assessment of the mixed radiation fields. The Nuclear Theory and Applications group of the Los Alamos National Laboratory has recently provided first-of-a-kind evaluated photonuclear data for a selectmoreÂ Â» group of isotopes. These data provide the reaction probabilities as functions of incident photon energy with angular and energy distribution information for all reaction products. The availability of these data is the cornerstone of the new methodology for state-of-the-art mutually coupled photon-neutron transport simulations. The dissertation includes details of the model development and implementation necessary to use the new photonuclear data within MCNP simulations. A new data format has been developed to include tabular photonuclear data. Data are processed from the Evaluated Nuclear Data Format (ENDF) to the new class ''u'' A Compact ENDF (ACE) format using a standalone processing code. MCNP modifications have been completed to enable Monte Carlo sampling of photonuclear reactions. Note that both neutron and gamma production are included in the present model. The new capability has been subjected to extensive verification and validation (V&V) testing. Verification testing has established the expected basic functionality. Two validation projects were undertaken. First, comparisons were made to benchmark data from literature. These calculations demonstrate the accuracy of the new data and transport routines to better than 25 percent.

CULBERTSON\n\n2000-01-01\n\nThe weight window variance reduction method in the general-purpose Monte Carlo N-Particle radiation transport code MCNPTM has recently been rewritten. In particular, it is now possible to generate weight window importance functions on a superimposed mesh, eliminating the need to subdivide geometries for variance reduction purposes. Our assessment addresses the following questions: (1) Does the new MCNP4C treatment utilize weight windows as well as the former MCNP4B treatment? (2) Does the new MCNP4C weight window generator generate importance functions as well as MCNP4B? (3) How do superimposed mesh weight windows compare to cell-based weight windows? (4) What are the shortcomingsmoreÂ Â» of the new MCNP4C weight window generator? Our assessment was carried out with five neutron and photon shielding problems chosen for their demanding variance reduction requirements. The problems were an oil well logging problem, the Oak Ridge fusion shielding benchmark problem, a photon skyshine problem, an air-over-ground problem, and a sample problem for variance reduction.Â«Â less\n\nMonte Carlo Modeling of the Initial Radiation Emitted by a Nuclear Device in the National Capital Region\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2013-07-01\n\nalso simulated in the models.

Methods Neutrons are elementary particles that have no charge. They are 20 times more effective than electrons or Î³-rays in killing anthrax spores on surfaces and inside closed containers. Neutrons emitted from a 252Cf neutron source are in the 100 keV to 2 MeV energy range. A 2.5 MeV DâD neutron generator can create neutrons at up to 1013 n sâ1 with current technology. All these enable an effective and low-cost method of killing anthrax spores. Results There is no effect on neutron energy deposition on the anthrax sample when using a reflector that is thicker than its saturation thickness. Among all three reflecting materials tested in the MCNP simulation, paraffin is the best because it has the thinnest saturation thickness and is easy to machine. The MCNP radiation dose and fluence simulation calculation also showed that the MCNP-simulated neutron fluence that is needed to kill the anthrax spores agrees with previous analytical estimations very well. Conclusion The MCNP simulation indicates that a 10 min neutron irradiation from a 0.5 g 252Cf neutron source or a 1 min neutron irradiation from a 2.5 MeV DâD neutron generator may kill all anthrax spores in a sample. This is a promising result because a 2.5 MeV DâD neutron generator output >1013 n sâ1 should be attainable in the near future. This indicates that we could use a DâD neutron generator to sterilise anthrax contamination within several seconds.

Our objective was to model the cellular dosimetry of 64 Cu under different geometries commonly used to study the cytotoxic effects of 64 Cu. Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) was used to simulate the transport of all particles emitted by 64 Cu from the cell surface (CS), cytoplasm (Cy), or nucleus (N) of a single cell; monolayer in a well (radius = 0.32-1.74 cm); or a sphere (radius = 50-6,000 Î¼m) of cells to calculate S values. The radius of the cell and N ranged from 5 to 12 Î¼m and 2 to 11 Î¼m, respectively. S values were obtained by MIRDcell for comparison. MCF7/HER2-18 cells were exposed in vitro to 64 Cu-labeled trastuzumab. The subcellular distribution of 64 Cu was measured by cell fractionation. The surviving fraction was determined in a clonogenic assay. The relative differences of MCNP versus MIRDcell self-dose S values (S self ) for 64 Cu ranged from -0.2% to 3.6% for N to N (S NâN ), 2.3% to 8.6% for Cy to N (S NâCy ), and -12.0% to 7.3% for CS to N (S NâCS ). The relative differences of MCNP versus MIRDcell cross-dose S values were 25.8%-30.6% for a monolayer and 30%-34% for a sphere, respectively. The ratios of S NâN versus S NâCy and S NâCy versus S NâCS decreased with increasing ratio of the N of the cell versus radius of the cell and the size of the monolayer or sphere. The surviving fraction of MCF7 /: HER2-18 cells treated with 64 Cu-labeled trastuzumab (0.016-0.368 MBq/Î¼g, 67 nM) for 18 h versus the absorbed dose followed a linear survival curve with Î± = 0.51 Â± 0.05 Gy -1 and R 2 = 0.8838. This is significantly different from the linear quadratic survival curve of MCF7 /: HER2-18 cells exposed to Î³-rays. MCNP- and MIRDcell-calculated S values agreed well. 64 Cu in the N increases the dose to the N in isolated single cells but has less effect in a cell monolayer or small cluster of cells simulating a micrometastasis\n\nSU-F-T-140: Assessment of the Proton Boron Fusion Reaction for Practical Radiation Therapy Applications Using MCNP6\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nAdam, D; Bednarz, B\n\nPurpose: The proton boron fusion reaction is a reaction that describes the creation of three alpha particles as the result of the interaction of a proton incident upon a 11B target. Theoretically, the proton boron fusion reaction is a desirable reaction for radiation therapy applications in that, with the appropriate boron delivery agent, it could potentially combine the localized dose delivery protons exhibit (Bragg peak) and the local deposition of high LET alpha particles in cancerous sites. Previous efforts have shown significant dose enhancement using the proton boron fusion reaction; the overarching purpose of this work is an attempt tomoreÂ Â» validate previous Monte Carlo results of the proton boron fusion reaction. Methods: The proton boron fusion reaction, 11B(p, 3Î±), is investigated using MCNP6 to assess the viability for potential use in radiation therapy. Simple simulations of a proton pencil beam incident upon both a water phantom and a water phantom with an axial region containing 100ppm boron were modeled using MCNP6 in order to determine the extent of the impact boron had upon the calculated energy deposition. Results: The maximum dose increase calculated was 0.026% for the incident 250 MeV proton beam scenario. The MCNP simulations performed demonstrated that the proton boron fusion reaction rate at clinically relevant boron concentrations was too small in order to have any measurable impact on the absorbed dose. Conclusion: For all MCNP6 simulations conducted, the increase of absorbed dose of a simple water phantom due to the 11B(p, 3Î±) reaction was found to be inconsequential. In addition, it was determined that there are no good evaluations of the 11B(p, 3Î±) reaction for use in MCNPX/6 and further work should be conducted in cross section evaluations in order to definitively evaluate the feasibility of the proton boron fusion reaction for use in radiation therapy applications.Â«Â less\n\nMCNP (Monte Carlo Neutron Photon) capabilities for nuclear well logging calculations\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nForster, R.A.; Little, R.C.; Briesmeister, J.F.\n\nThe Los Alamos Radiation Transport Code System (LARTCS) consists of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo and discrete ordinates transport codes and data libraries.

Areas of ongoing research of interest to the well logging community include angle biasing, adaptive Monte Carlo, improved discrete ordinates capabilities, and discrete ordinates/Monte Carlo hybrid development.

Noble gases and other fission products released to the containment act as sources. The dose rates caused by skyshine have been calculated by MCNP3A for the Loviisa nuclear power plant (two-unit, 445-MW VVER) for the outside area and inside some buildings, taking the attenuation in the roofs of the buildings into account.\n\nSimulation of the GCR spectrum in the Mars curiosity rover's RAD detector using MCNP6\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRatliff, Hunter N.; Smith, Michael B.

This is achieved usually by photons generated by linear accelerator units. However, radiation scattering within the patient's body and the surrounding environment will lead to dose dispersion to healthy tissues which are not targets of the primary radiation. Determination of the dispersed dose would be important for assessing the risk and biological consequences in different organs or tissues. In the present work, the concept of conversion coefficient (F) of the dispersed dose was developed, in which F = (Dd/Dt), where Dd was the dispersed dose in a non-targeted tissue and Dt is the absorbed dose in the targeted tissue. To quantify Dd and Dt, a comprehensive model was developed using the Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) package to simulate the linear accelerator head, the human phantom, the treatment couch and the radiotherapy treatment room.

The approach for computing neutron fluence rate and each dose component relevant in boron neutron capture therapy is described, and calculated values are shown in detail. The differences between the COG and MCNP predictions are qualified and quantified.

The electron's path in the target was followed until its energy was reduced to 10 keV. A user-friendly interface named 'diagnostic X-ray spectra by Monte Carlo simulation (DXRaySMCS)' was developed to facilitate the application of MCNP-4C code for diagnostic radiology spectrum prediction. The program provides a user-friendly interface for: (i) modifying the MCNP input file, (ii) launching the MCNP program to simulate electron and photon transport and (iii) processing the MCNP output file to yield a summary of the results (relative photon number per energy bin). In this article, the development and characteristics of DXRaySMCS are outlined. As part of the validation process, output spectra for 46 diagnostic radiology system settings produced by DXRaySMCS were compared with the corresponding IPEM78. Generally, there is a good agreement between the two sets of spectra. No statistically significant differences have been observed between IPEM78 reported spectra and the simulated spectra generated in this study.\n\nSimulation of the GCR spectrum in the Mars curiosity rover's RAD detector using MCNP6.\n\nPubMed\n\nRatliff, Hunter N; Smith, Michael B R; Heilbronn, Lawrence\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThe paper presents results from MCNP6 simulations of galactic cosmic ray (GCR) propagation down through the Martian atmosphere to the surface and comparison with RAD measurements made there.

MCNP is a general-purpose three-dimensional neutron, photon and electron transport code. Its philosophy is ``Quality, Value and New Features.`` Quality is exemplified by new software quality assurance practices and a program of benchmarking against experiments. Value includes a strong emphasis on documentation and code portability. New features are the third priority. MCNP4A is now available at Los Alamos. New features in MCNP4A include enhanced statistical analysis, distributed processor multitasking, newmoreÂ Â» photon libraries, ENDF/B-VI capabilities, X-Windows graphics, dynamic memory allocation, expanded criticality output, periodic boundaries, plotting of particle tracks via SABRINA, and many other improvements. 23 refs.Â«Â less\n\nGeometry creation for MCNP by Sabrina and XSM\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nVan Riper, K.A.\n\nThe Monte Carlo N-Particle transport code MCNP is based on a surface description of 3-dimensional geometry. Cells are defined in terms of boolean operations on signed quadratic surfaces. MCNP geometry is entered as a card image file containing coefficients of the surface equations and a list of surfaces and operators describing cells. Several programs are available to assist in creation of the geometry specification, among them Sabrina and the new ``Smart Editor`` code XSM. We briefly describe geometry creation in Sabrina and then discuss XSM in detail. XSM is under development; our discussion is based on the state of XSMmoreÂ Â» as of January 1, 1994.Â«Â less\n\nComparison study of photon attenuation characteristics of Lead-Boron Polyethylene by MCNP code, XCOM and experimental data\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, Lei; Jia, Mingchun; Gong, Junjun; Xia, Wenming\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThe linear attenuation coefficient, mass attenuation coefficient and mean free path of various Lead-Boron Polyethylene (PbBPE) samples which can be used as the photon shielding materials in marine reactor have been simulated using the Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP)-5 code.

With this method, the computational efficiency is improved significantly by two to three orders of magnitude compared to the analog Monte Carlo MCNP calculation. This makes the calculation feasible using a single CPU in less than 1 day.

This involves utilization of Monte-Carlo particle transport code MCNP6 and ENDF/B-VII.0 nuclear data libraries, as well as testing the physical electrical systems against Î³ radiation, utilizing JSI TRIGA mk.

A new, aluminum, 20 cm Ã 20 cm Ã 30 cm irradiation facility with electrical power and signal wire guide-tube to the reactor platform, was designed and constructed and used for irradiation of large electronic and optical components assemblies with activated fuel elements. Electronic components to be used in the camera were tested against Î³-radiation in an independent manner, to determine their radiation tolerance. Several camera designs were proposed and simulated using MCNP, to determine incident particle and dose attenuation factors. Data obtained from the measurements and MCNP simulations will be used to finalize the design of 3 surveillance camera models, with different radiation tolerances.\n\nMCNP Output Data Analysis with ROOT (MODAR)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCarasco, C.\n\n2010-06-01\n\nMCNP Output Data Analysis with ROOT (MODAR) is a tool based on CERN's ROOT software.

For the first time we report timing results using MCNP4A and its new test set and libraries. Comparisons are made on platforms not available to us in previous MCNP timing studies. By using MCNP4A and its 325-problem test set, a widely-used and readily-available physics production code is used; the timing comparison is not limited to a single ``typical`` problem, demonstrating the problem dependence of timing results; the results are reproducible at the more than 100 installations around the world using MCNP; comparison ofmoreÂ Â» performance of other computer platforms to the ones tested in this study is possible because we present raw data rather than normalized results; and a measure of the increase in performance of computer hardware and software over the past two years is possible. The computer platforms reported are the Cray-YMP 8/64, IBM RS/6000-560, Sun Sparc10, Sun Sparc2, HP/9000-735, 4 processor 100 MHz Silicon Graphics ONYX, and Gateway 2000 model 4DX2-66V PC. In 1991 a timing study of MCNP4, the predecessor to MCNP4A, was conducted using ENDF/B-V cross-section libraries, which are export protected. The new study is based upon the new MCNP 25-problem test set which utilizes internationally available data. MCNP4A, its test problems and the test data library are available from the Radiation Shielding and Information Center in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, or from the NEA Data Bank in Saclay, France. Anyone with the same workstation and compiler can get the same test problem sets, the same library files, and the same MCNP4A code from RSIC or NEA and replicate our results. And, because we report raw data, comparison of the performance of other compute platforms and compilers can be made.Â«Â less\n\nRapid Acute Dose Assessment Using MCNP6\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOwens, Andrew Steven\n\nAcute radiation doses due to physical contact with a high-activity radioactive source have proven to be an occupational hazard. Multiple radiation injuries have been reported due to manipulating a radioactive source with bare hands or by placing a radioactive source inside a shirt or pants pocket. An effort to reconstruct the radiation dose must be performed to properly assess and medically manage the potential biological effects from such doses. Using the reference computational phantoms defined by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) and the Monte Carlo N-Particle transport code (MCNP6), dose rate coefficients are calculated to assess doses for common acute doses due to beta and photon radiation sources. The research investigates doses due to having a radioactive source in either a breast pocket or pants back pocket. The dose rate coefficients are calculated for discrete energies and can be used to interpolate for any given energy of photon or beta emission. The dose rate coefficients allow for quick calculation of whole-body dose, organ dose, and/or skin dose if the source, activity, and time of exposure are known. Doses are calculated with the dose rate coefficients and compared to results from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reports from accidents that occurred in Gilan, Iran and Yanango, Peru. Skin and organ doses calculated with the dose rate coefficients appear to agree, but there is a large discrepancy when comparing whole-body doses assessed using biodosimetry and whole-body doses assessed using the dose rate coefficients.\n\nProduction of energetic light fragments in extensions of the CEM and LAQGSM event generators of the Monte Carlo transport code MCNP6 [Production of energetic light fragments in CEM, LAQGSM, and MCNP6\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nMashnik, Stepan Georgievich; Kerby, Leslie Marie; Gudima, Konstantin K.; ...\n\n2017-03-23\n\nWe extend the cascade-exciton model (CEM), and the Los Alamos version of the quark-gluon string model (LAQGSM), event generators of the Monte Carlo N-particle transport code version 6 (MCNP6), to describe production of energetic light fragments (LF) heavier than 4He from various nuclear reactions induced by particles and nuclei at energies up to about 1 TeV/nucleon.

While each of these codes has strengths, it is of paramount interest to determine the limitations of each of the respective codes and also to identify the most time efficient means by which to produce computational results, given the large number of parametric cases that are anticipated in performing STR's. These comparisons serve to identify regions of applicabilitymoreÂ Â» for each code and provide estimates of uncertainty that may be anticipated. Furthermore, while performing these comparisons, examination of the sensitivity of the results to modeling assumptions was also examined. These investigations serve to enable the creation of the LANL methodology for performing STRs. Given the wide variety of radiation test sources, scenarios, and detectors, LANL calculated comparisons of the following parameters: decay data, multiplicity, device (n,Î³) leakages, and radiation transport through representative scenes and shielding. This investigation was performed to understand potential limitations utilizing specific codes for different aspects of the STR challenges.Â«Â less\n\nThe MCNP-DSP code for calculations of time and frequency analysis parameters for subcritical systems\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nValentine, T.E.; Mihalczo, J.T.\n\n1995-12-31\n\nThis paper describes a modified version of the MCNP code, the MCNP-DSP.

R.\n\n2015-04-11\n\nThe first MCNP based inline Monte Carlo depletion capability was officially released from the Radiation Safety Information and Computational Center as MCNPX 2.6.0. With the merger of MCNPX and MCNP5, MCNP6 combined the capability of both simulation tools, as well as providing new advanced technology, in a single radiation transport code. The new MCNP6 depletion capability was first showcased at the International Congress for Advancements in Nuclear Power Plants (ICAPP) meeting in 2012. At that conference the new capabilities addressed included the combined distributive and shared memory parallel architecture for the burnup capability, improved memory management, physics enhancements, and newmoreÂ Â» predictability as compared to the H.B Robinson Benchmark. At Los Alamos National Laboratory, a special purpose cluster named âtebow,â was constructed such to maximize available RAM per CPU, as well as leveraging swap space with solid state hard drives, to allow larger scale depletion calculations (allowing for significantly more burnable regions than previously examined). As the MCNP6 burnup capability was scaled to larger numbers of burnable regions, a noticeable slowdown was realized.This paper details two specific computational performance strategies for improving calculation speedup: (1) retrieving cross sections during transport; and (2) tallying mechanisms specific to burnup in MCNP. To combat this slowdown new performance upgrades were developed and integrated into MCNP6 1.2.Â«Â less\n\nMCNP-REN - A Monte Carlo Tool for Neutron Detector Design Without Using the Point Model\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nAbhold, M.E.; Baker, M.C.\n\n1999-07-25\n\nThe development of neutron detectors makes extensive use of the predictions of detector response through the use of Monte Carlo techniques in conjunction with the point reactor model. Unfortunately, the point reactor model fails to accurately predict detector response in common applications. For this reason, the general Monte Carlo N-Particle code (MCNP) was modified to simulate the pulse streams that would be generated by a neutron detector and normally analyzed by a shift register. This modified code, MCNP - Random Exponentially Distributed Neutron Source (MCNP-REN), along with the Time Analysis Program (TAP) predict neutron detector response without using the pointmoreÂ Â» reactor model, making it unnecessary for the user to decide whether or not the assumptions of the point model are met for their application. MCNP-REN is capable of simulating standard neutron coincidence counting as well as neutron multiplicity counting. Measurements of MOX fresh fuel made using the Underwater Coincidence Counter (UWCC) as well as measurements of HEU reactor fuel using the active neutron Research Reactor Fuel Counter (RRFC) are compared with calculations. The method used in MCNP-REN is demonstrated to be fundamentally sound and shown to eliminate the need to use the point model for detector performance predictions.Â«Â less\n\nConsiderations of MCNP Monte Carlo code to be used as a radiotherapy treatment planning tool.\n\nPubMed\n\nJuste, B; Miro, R; Gallardo, S; Verdu, G; Santos, A\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThe present work has simulated the photon and electron transport in a Theratron 780® (MDS Nordion)60Co radiotherapy unit, using the Monte Carlo transport code, MCNP (Monte Carlo N-Particle).

Patched versions of the MCNP and MCNPX codes are developed aimed at transporting radiation both in the standard geometry mode and in the voxel geometry treatment. The patched code reads an unformatted FORTRAN file derived from DICOM format data and uses special subroutines to handle voxel-to-voxel radiation transport.

Applications at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology are primarily whole and partial body counter calibration and calculation of dose conversion coefficients. A new generic data model describing data related to radiation transport, including phantom and detector geometries and their properties, sources, tallies and materials, has been developed. It is modular and generally independent of the targeted Monte Carlo code. The data model has been implemented as an XML-based file format to facilitate data exchange, and integrated with Voxel2MCNP to provide a common interface for modeling, visualization, and evaluation of data. Also, extensions to allow compatibility with several file formats, such as ENSDF for nuclear structure properties and radioactive decay data, SimpleGeo for solid geometry modeling, ImageJ for voxel lattices, and MCNPX's MCTAL for simulation results have been added. The framework is presented and discussed in this paper and example workflows for body counter calibration and calculation of dose conversion coefficients is given to illustrate its application.\n\nAn MCNP-based model of a medical linear accelerator x-ray photon beam.\n\nPubMed\n\nAjaj, F A; Ghassal, N M\n\n2003-09-01\n\nThe major components in the x-ray photon beam path of the treatment head of the VARIAN Clinac 2300 EX medical linear accelerator were modeled and simulated using the Monte Carlo N-Particle radiation transport computer code (MCNP). Simulated components include x-ray target, primary conical collimator, x-ray beam flattening filter and secondary collimators. X-ray photon energy spectra and angular distributions were calculated using the model. The x-ray beam emerging from the secondary collimators were scored by considering the total x-ray spectra from the target as the source of x-rays at the target position. The depth dose distribution and dose profiles at different depths and field sizes have been calculated at a nominal operating potential of 6 MV and found to be within acceptable limits. It is concluded that accurate specification of the component dimensions, composition and nominal accelerating potential gives a good assessment of the x-ray energy spectra.\n\nAn investigation of voxel geometries for MCNP-based radiation dose calculations.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Juying; Bednarz, Bryan; Xu, X George\n\n2006-11-01\n\nVoxelized geometry such as those obtained from medical images is increasingly used in Monte Carlo calculations of absorbed doses. One useful application of calculated absorbed dose is the determination of fluence-to-dose conversion factors for different organs. However, confusion still exists about how such a geometry is defined and how the energy deposition is best computed, especially involving a popular code, MCNP5. This study investigated two different types of geometries in the MCNP5 code, cell and lattice definitions. A 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm test phantom, which contained an embedded 2 cm x 2 cm x 2 cm target at its center, was considered. A planar source emitting parallel photons was also considered in the study. The results revealed that MCNP5 does not calculate total target volume for multi-voxel geometries. Therefore, tallies which involve total target volume must be divided by the user by the total number of voxels to obtain a correct dose result. Also, using planar source areas greater than the phantom size results in the same fluence-to-dose conversion factor.\n\nSimulation of irradiation exposure of electronic devices due to heavy ion therapy with Monte Carlo Code MCNP6\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLapins, Janis; Guilliard, Nicole; Bernnat, Wolfgang; Buck, Arnulf\n\n2017-09-01\n\nDuring heavy ion irradiation therapy the patient has to be located exactly at the right position to make sure that the Bragg peak occurs in the tumour. The patient has to be moved in the range of millimetres to scan the ill tissue. For that reason a special table was developed which allows exact positioning. The electronic control can be located outside the surgery. But that has some disadvantage for the construction. To keep the system compact it would be much more comfortable to put the electronic control inside the surgery. As a lot of high energetic secondary particles are produced during the therapy causing a high dose in the room it is important to find positions with low dose rates. Therefore, investigations are needed where the electronic devices should be located to obtain a minimum of radiation, help to prevent the failure of sensitive devices. The dose rate was calculated for carbon ions with different initial energy and protons over the entire therapy room with Monte Carlo particle tracking using MCNP6. The types of secondary particles were identified and the dose rate for a thin silicon layer and an electronic mixture material was determined. In addition, the shielding effect of several selected material layers was calculated using MCNP6.\n\nFull-Scale Model of Subionospheric VLF Signal Propagation Based on First-Principles Charged Particle Transport Calculations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKouznetsov, A.; Cully, C. M.; Knudsen, D. J.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nChanges in D-Region ionization caused by energetic particle precipitation are monitored by the Array for Broadband Observations of VLF/ELF Emissions (ABOVE) - a network of receivers deployed across Western Canada. The observed amplitudes and phases of subionospheric-propagating VLF signals from distant artificial transmitters depend sensitively on the free electron population created by precipitation of energetic charged particles. Those include both primary (electrons, protons and heavier ions) and secondary (cascades of ionized particles and electromagnetic radiation) components. We have designed and implemented a full-scale model to predict the received VLF signals based on first-principle charged particle transport calculations coupled to the Long Wavelength Propagation Capability (LWPC) software. Calculations of ionization rates and free electron densities are based on MCNP-6 (a general-purpose Monte Carlo N- Particle) software taking advantage of its capability of coupled neutron/photon/electron transport and novel library of cross-sections for low-energetic electron and photon interactions with matter. Cosmic ray calculations of background ionization are based on source spectra obtained both from PAMELA direct Cosmic Rays spectra measurements and based on the recently-implemented MCNP 6 galactic cosmic-ray source, scaled using our (Calgary) neutron monitor measurement results. Conversion from calculated fluxes (MCNP F4 tallies) to ionization rates for low-energy electrons are based on the total ionization cross-sections for oxygen and nitrogen molecules from the National Institute of Standard and Technology. We use our model to explore the complexity of the physical processes affecting VLF propagation.\n\nImproved radial dose function estimation using current version MCNP Monte-Carlo simulation: Model 6711 and ISC3500 125I brachytherapy sources.\n\nPubMed\n\nDuggan, Dennis M\n\n2004-12-01\n\nImproved cross-sections in a new version of the Monte-Carlo N-particle (MCNP) code may eliminate discrepancies between radial dose functions (as defined by American Association of Physicists in Medicine Task Group 43) derived from Monte-Carlo simulations of low-energy photon-emitting brachytherapy sources and those from measurements on the same sources with thermoluminescent dosimeters. This is demonstrated for two 125I brachytherapy seed models, the Implant Sciences Model ISC3500 (I-Plant) and the Amersham Health Model 6711, by simulating their radial dose functions with two versions of MCNP, 4c2 and 5.\n\nOrgan dose conversion coefficients based on a voxel mouse model and MCNP code for external photon irradiation.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Xiaomin; Xie, Xiangdong; Cheng, Jie; Ning, Jing; Yuan, Yong; Pan, Jie; Yang, Guoshan\n\n2012-01-01\n\nA set of conversion coefficients from kerma free-in-air to the organ absorbed dose for external photon beams from 10 keV to 10 MeV are presented based on a newly developed voxel mouse model, for the purpose of radiation effect evaluation. The voxel mouse model was developed from colour images of successive cryosections of a normal nude male mouse, in which 14 organs or tissues were segmented manually and filled with different colours, while each colour was tagged by a specific ID number for implementation of mouse model in Monte Carlo N-particle code (MCNP). Monte Carlo simulation with MCNP was carried out to obtain organ dose conversion coefficients for 22 external monoenergetic photon beams between 10 keV and 10 MeV under five different irradiation geometries conditions (left lateral, right lateral, dorsal-ventral, ventral-dorsal, and isotropic). Organ dose conversion coefficients were presented in tables and compared with the published data based on a rat model to investigate the effect of body size and weight on the organ dose. The calculated and comparison results show that the organ dose conversion coefficients varying the photon energy exhibits similar trend for most organs except for the bone and skin, and the organ dose is sensitive to body size and weight at a photon energy approximately <0.1 MeV.\n\nMonte Carlo simulation of x-ray spectra in diagnostic radiology and mammography using MCNP4C\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAy, M. R.; Shahriari, M.; Sarkar, S.; Adib, M.; Zaidi, H.\n\n2004-11-01\n\nThe general purpose Monte Carlo N-particle radiation transport computer code (MCNP4C) was used for the simulation of x-ray spectra in diagnostic radiology and mammography. The electrons were transported until they slow down and stop in the target. Both bremsstrahlung and characteristic x-ray production were considered in this work. We focus on the simulation of various target/filter combinations to investigate the effect of tube voltage, target material and filter thickness on x-ray spectra in the diagnostic radiology and mammography energy ranges. The simulated x-ray spectra were compared with experimental measurements and spectra calculated by IPEM report number 78. In addition, the anode heel effect and off-axis x-ray spectra were assessed for different anode angles and target materials and the results were compared with EGS4-based Monte Carlo simulations and measured data. Quantitative evaluation of the differences between our Monte Carlo simulated and comparison spectra was performed using student's t-test statistical analysis. Generally, there is a good agreement between the simulated x-ray and comparison spectra, although there are systematic differences between the simulated and reference spectra especially in the K-characteristic x-rays intensity. Nevertheless, no statistically significant differences have been observed between IPEM spectra and the simulated spectra. It has been shown that the difference between MCNP simulated spectra and IPEM spectra in the low energy range is the result of the overestimation of characteristic photons following the normalization procedure. The transmission curves produced by MCNP4C have good agreement with the IPEM report especially for tube voltages of 50 kV and 80 kV. The systematic discrepancy for higher tube voltages is the result of systematic differences between the corresponding spectra.\n\nUsing Machine Learning to Predict MCNP Bias\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nGrechanuk, Pavel Aleksandrovi\n\nFor many real-world applications in radiation transport where simulations are compared to experimental measurements, like in nuclear criticality safety, the bias (simulated - experimental k eff) in the calculation is an extremely important quantity used for code validation. The objective of this project is to accurately predict the bias of MCNP6 [1] criticality calculations using machine learning (ML) algorithms, with the intention of creating a tool that can complement the current nuclear criticality safety methods. In the latest release of MCNP6, the Whisper tool is available for criticality safety analysts and includes a large catalogue of experimental benchmarks, sensitivity profiles,moreÂ Â» and nuclear data covariance matrices. This data, coming from 1100+ benchmark cases, is used in this study of ML algorithms for criticality safety bias predictions.Â«Â less\n\nMCNP6 Simulation of Light and Medium Nuclei Fragmentation at Intermediate Energies\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMashnik, Stepan Georgievich; Kerby, Leslie Marie\n\n2015-05-22\n\nMCNP6, the latest and most advanced LANL Monte Carlo transport code, representing a merger of MCNP5 and MCNPX, is actually much more than the sum of those two computer codes; MCNP6 is available to the public via RSICC at Oak Ridge, TN, USA. In the present work, MCNP6 was validated and verified (V&V) against different experimental data on intermediate-energy fragmentation reactions, and results by several other codes, using mainly the latest modifications of the Cascade-Exciton Model (CEM) and of the Los Alamos version of the Quark-Gluon String Model (LAQGSM) event generators CEM03.03 and LAQGSM03.03. It was found that MCNP6 usingmoreÂ Â» CEM03.03 and LAQGSM03.03 describes well fragmentation reactions induced on light and medium target nuclei by protons and light nuclei of energies around 1 GeV/nucleon and below, and can serve as a reliable simulation tool for different applications, like cosmic-ray-induced single event upsets (SEUâs), radiation protection, and cancer therapy with proton and ion beams, to name just a few. Future improvements of the predicting capabilities of MCNP6 for such reactions are possible, and are discussed in this work.Â«Â less\n\nPath Toward a Unified Geometry for Radiation Transport\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLee, Kerry\n\nto the creation and maintenance of toolkit specific simplistic geometry models.

The composite samples were prepared using the HDPE filled with different weight percentages of Boron carbide powder in the form of micro and nano particles. Micro and nano composite were prepared under the similar mixing and moulding processes. The samples were subjected to thermal neutron radiation. Neutron shielding efficiency in terms of the neutron transmission fractions of the composite samples were investigated and compared with simulation results. According to the simulation results, the particle size of the radiation shielding material has an important role on the shielding efficiency. By decreasing the particle size of shielding material in each weight percentages of the reinforcement phase, better radiation shielding properties were obtained. It seems that, decreasing the particle size and homogeneous distribution of nano forms of B4C particles, cause to increase the collision probability between the incident thermal neutron and the shielding material which consequently improve the radiation shielding properties. So, this result, propose the feasibility of nano composite as shielding material to have a high performance shielding characteristic, low weight and low thick shielding along with economical benefit.\n\nMCNP6 Status\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nGoorley, John T.\n\n2012-06-25\n\nWe, the development teams for MCNP, NJOY, and parts of ENDF, would like to invite you to a proposed 3 day workshop October 30, 31 and November 1 2012, to be held at Los Alamos National Laboratory.

Method: The irradiation geometry consisted of an x-ray source, dose-area-product chamber, and image intensifier as currently used in Interventional Radiology. Water cylinders of diameters ranging between 17 and 30 cm were used to simulate patients weighing between 20 and 90 kg. X-ray spectra data with peak x-ray tube voltages ranging from 60 to 120 kV were generated using XCOMP3R. Radiation dose distributions inside the water cylinder (Dw) were obtained using MCNP5. The depth dose distribution along the x-ray beam central axis was normalized to free-in-air air kerma (AK) that is incident on the phantom. Scattered radiation within the water cylinders but outside the directly irradiated region was normalized to the dose at the edge of the radiation field. The total absorbed energy to the directly irradiated volume (Ep) and indirectly irradiated volume (Es) were also determined and investigated as a function of x-ray tube voltage and phantom size. Results: At 80 kV, the average Dw/AK near the x-ray entrance point was 1.3. The ratio of Dw near the entrance point to Dw near the exit point increased from ~ 26 for the 17 cm water cylinder to ~ 290 for the 30 cm water cylinder. At 80 kV, the relative dose for a 17 cm water cylinder fell to 0.1% at 49 cm away from the central ray of the x-ray beam. For a 30 cm water cylinder, the relative dose fell to 0.1% at 53 cm away from the central ray of the x-ray beam. At a fixed x-ray tube voltage of 80 kV, increasing the water cylinder diameter from 17 to 30 cm increased the Es/(Ep+Es) ratio by about 50%. At a fixed water cylinder diameter of 24 cm, increasing the tube voltage from 60 kV to 120 kV increased the Es/(Ep+Es) ratio by about 12%. The absorbed energy from scattered radiation was between 20-30% of the total energy absorbed by the water cylinder, and was affected more by patient size\n\nIntrinsic Radiation Source Generation with the ISC Package: Data Comparisons and Benchmarking\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSolomon, Clell J. Jr.\n\nThe characterization of radioactive emissions from unstable isotopes (intrinsic radiation) is necessary for shielding and radiological-dose calculations from radioactive materials. While most radiation transport codes, e.g., MCNP [X-5 Monte Carlo Team, 2003], provide the capability to input user prescribed source definitions, such as radioactive emissions, they do not provide the capability to calculate the correct radioactive-source definition given the material compositions. Special modifications to MCNP have been developed in the past to allow the user to specify an intrinsic source, but these modification have not been implemented into the primary source base [Estes et al., 1988]. To facilitate the descriptionmoreÂ Â» of the intrinsic radiation source from a material with a specific composition, the Intrinsic Source Constructor library (LIBISC) and MCNP Intrinsic Source Constructor (MISC) utility have been written. The combination of LIBISC and MISC will be herein referred to as the ISC package. LIBISC is a statically linkable C++ library that provides the necessary functionality to construct the intrinsic-radiation source generated by a material. Furthermore, LIBISC provides the ability use different particle-emission databases, radioactive-decay databases, and natural-abundance databases allowing the user flexibility in the specification of the source, if one database is preferred over others. LIBISC also provides functionality for aging materials and producing a thick-target bremsstrahlung photon source approximation from the electron emissions. The MISC utility links to LIBISC and facilitates the description of intrinsic-radiation sources into a format directly usable with the MCNP transport code. Through a series of input keywords and arguments the MISC user can specify the material, age the material if desired, and produce a source description of the radioactive emissions from the material in an MCNP readable format.

A.; Allahverdi, M.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nElectron dose distributions calculated using the currently available analytical methods can be associated with large uncertainties. The Monte Carlo method is the most accurate method for dose calculation in electron beams. Most of the clinical electron beam simulation studies have been performed using non- MCNP [Monte Carlo N Particle] codes. Given the differences between Monte Carlo codes, this work aims to evaluate the accuracy of MCNP4C-simulated electron dose distributions in a homogenous phantom and around inhomogeneities. Different types of phantoms ranging in complexity were used; namely, a homogeneous water phantom and phantoms made of polymethyl methacrylate slabs containing different-sized, low- and high-density inserts of heterogeneous materials. Electron beams with 8 and 15 MeV nominal energy generated by an Elekta Synergy linear accelerator were investigated. Measurements were performed for a 10 cm Ã 10 cm applicator at a source-to-surface distance of 100 cm. Individual parts of the beam-defining system were introduced into the simulation one at a time in order to show their effect on depth doses. In contrast to the first scattering foil, the secondary scattering foil, X and Y jaws and applicator provide up to 5% of the dose. A 2%/2 mm agreement between MCNP and measurements was found in the homogenous phantom, and in the presence of heterogeneities in the range of 1-3%, being generally within 2% of the measurements for both energies in a \"complex\" phantom. A full-component simulation is necessary in order to obtain a realistic model of the beam. The MCNP4C results agree well with the measured electron dose distributions.

Initially, MCNP and Geant were developed to specialise in neutral particle models and accelerator models, respectively; there is now a greater overlap of the capabilities of both, and it is therefore useful to produce comparative models to evaluate detector characteristics. In a collaboration between Lancaster University, UK, and Innovative Physics Ltd., UK, models have been developed in both MCNP6 and Geant4 of Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CdZnTe) detectors developed by Innovative Physics Ltd. Herein, a comparison is made of the relative strengths of MCNP6 and Geant4 for modelling neutron flux and secondary Î³-ray emission. Given the increasing overlap of the modelling capabilities of MCNP6 and Geant4, it is worthwhile to comment on differences in results for simulations which have similarities in terms of geometries and source configurations.\n\nTesting the Delayed Gamma Capability in MCNP6\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nWeldon, Robert A.; Fensin, Michael L.; McKinney, Gregg W.\n\nThe mission of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office is to quickly and reliably detect unauthorized attempts to import or transport special nuclear material for use against the United States. Developing detection equipment to meet this objective requires accurate simulation of both the detectable signature and detection mechanism. A delayed particle capability was initially added to MCNPX 2.6.A in 2005 to sample the radioactive fission product parents and emit decay particles resulting from the decay chain. To meet the objectives of detection scenario modeling, the capability was designed to sample a particular time for emitting particular multiplicity of a particular energy.moreÂ Â» Because the sampling process of selecting both time and energy is interdependent, to linearize the time and emission sampling, atom densities are computed at several discrete time steps, and the time-integrated production is computed by multiplying the atom density by the decay constant and time step size to produce a cumulative distribution function for sampling the emission time, energy, and multiplicity. The delayed particle capability was initially given a time-bin structure to help reasonably reproduce, from a qualitative sense, a fission benchmark by Beddingfield, which examined the delayed gamma emission. This original benchmark was only qualitative and did not contain the magnitudes of the actual measured data but did contain relative graphical representation of the spectra. A better benchmark with measured data was later provided by Hunt, Mozin, Reedy, Selpel, and Tobin at the Idaho Accelerator Center; however, because of the complexity of the benchmark setup, sizable systematic errors were expected in the modeling, and initial results compared to MCNPX 2.7.0 showed errors outside of statistical fluctuation. Presented in this paper is a more simplified approach to benchmarking, utilizing closed form analytic solutions to the granddaughter equations for particular sets of decay\n\nComparison of scientific computing platforms for MCNP4A Monte Carlo calculations\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHendricks, J.S.; Brockhoff, R.C.\n\n1994-04-01\n\nThe performance of seven computer platforms is evaluated with the widely used and internationally available MCNP4A Monte Carlo radiation transport code.

The layers were so thin that the calculation of energy deposition was on the border of the scope of MCNP. Therefore, in this article application of three different methods of calculation of energy deposition is discussed. This was done by means of two scenarios: in the first one, electrons were emitted from the centre of a sphere of water and also recorded in that sphere; and in the second, an irradiation with the PTB Secondary Standard BSS2 was modelled, where electrons were emitted from an (90)Sr/(90)Y area source and recorded inside a cuboid phantom made of tissue-equivalent material. The speed and accuracy of the different methods were of interest. While a significant difference in accuracy was visible for one method in the first scenario, the difference in accuracy of the three methods was insignificant for the second one. Considerable differences in speed were found for both scenarios. In order to demonstrate the need for calculating the dose in thin small zones, a third scenario was constructed and simulated as well. The third scenario was nearly equal to the second one, but a pike of lead was assumed to be inside the phantom in addition. A dose enhancement (caused by the pike of lead) of â¼113 % was recorded for a thin hollow cylinder at a depth of 0.007 cm, which the basal-skin layer is referred to in particular. Dose enhancements between 68 and 88 % were found for a slab with a radius of 0.09 cm for all depths. All dose enhancements were hardly noticeable for a slab with a cross-sectional area of 1 cm(2), which is usually applied to operational radiation protection.\n\nSABRINA - An interactive geometry modeler for MCNP (Monte Carlo Neutron Photon)\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nWest, J.T.; Murphy, J.\n\nSABRINA is an interactive three-dimensional geometry modeler developed to produce complicated models for the Los Alamos Monte Carlo Neutron Photon program MCNP.
