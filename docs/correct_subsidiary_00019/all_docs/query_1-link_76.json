He spent over 12 years in various research and management positions in industry before accepting a professorship in Electrical Engineering at Aachen University of Technology (RWTH Aachen) in 1977. He has worked extensively in the areas of communication theory, digital signal processing and CAD tools for system level design for the last thirty years. His research has been applied to the design of many industrial products. At RWTH Aachen he is a co-director (together with Prof. Gerd Ascheid) of the Institute for Integrated Signal Processing System (ISS) involved in the analysis and design of complex signal processing systems for communication applications. Prof. Meyr was a co-founder of CADIS GmbH (acquired 1993 by Synopsys, Mountain View, California) a company which commercialized the tool suite COSSAP. In 2001 he has co-founded LISATek Inc., a company with breakthrough technology to design application specific processors. Most recently (February 2003 ) LISATek has been acquired by CoWare, an acknowledged leader in the area of system level design. At Coware Dr.Meyr has accepted the position of Chiefscientist. Prof. Gerd Ascheid, IEEE Fellow Professor of RWTH Aachen, Germany Director of Institute for Integrated Signal Processing Systems, Aachen University of Technology Prof. Gerd Ascheid received the Dipl.-Ing. and Dr.-Ing. (PhD) degrees from the Aachen University in 1977 and 1984. PhD research focused on synchronization algorithms for digital receivers and their implementation using digital signal processing. This work was complemented by measurement and analysis of the non-linear behaviour of phase locked loops in noise. After the PhD he worked as Sr. Researcher at the Aachen University , continuing the research on synchronization and working on various industry consulting projects for European and US based companies. During that time he co-authored (jointly with Dr. Meyr) the book \"Synchronization in Digital Communications\", published by Wiley in 1990. In 1989 he started as a co-founder CADIS GmbH, a company which commercialized the COSSAP tool suite. As Managing Director, he headed the design service activities of CADIS. Since 1994, when Synopsys acquired CADIS, he have held various positions at Synopsys. In his last position as a Sr. Director, he had worldwide responsibility for professional design services in Wireless and Broadband Communications with teams in Germany, France, India and US. Design projects mainly focused on system specification and implementation of the digital baseband section for wireless communication systems. Applications covered include Digital Video Broadcasting via Satellite, a proprietary satellite-based WAN, satellite-based mobile digital audio broadcasting (US), Spacecraft Transponder (for the European Space Agency, ESA), digital microwave (4-256 QAM), and cell phone standards like GSM/GPRS, EDGE, WCDMA(UMTS). Broadband designs were mainly in the areas of ATM and IP sec. 主辦單位：台大系統晶片中心 協辦單位: 台大電子工程學研究所、台大資訊工程學系 聯絡方式：02-3366-9685 康小姐、02-3366-3700 * 370 邱小姐"
