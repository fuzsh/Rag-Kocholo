This definition category includes how and where the data is processed.\n\nEmbedded FPGA (eFPGA)\n\nAn eFPGA is an IP core integrated into an ASIC or SoC that offers the flexibility of programmable logic without the cost of FPGAs.\n\nFan-Outs\n\nA way of including more features that normally would be on a printed circuit board inside a package.\n\nFunctional Verification\n\nFunctional verification is used to determine if a design, or unit of a design, conforms to its specification.\n\nGuard Banding\n\nAdding extra circuits or software into a design to ensure that if one part doesn't work the entire system doesn't fail.\n\n物联网(物联网)\n\nAlso known as the Internet of Everything, or IoE, the Internet of Things is a global application where devices can connect to a host of other devices, each either providing data from sensors, or containing actuators that can control some function. Data can be consolidated and processed on mass in the Cloud.\n\nLaws\n\nTheories have been influential and are often referred to as \"laws\" and are discussed in trade publications, research literature, and conference presentations as \"truisms\" that eventually have limits.\n\nMachine Learning (ML)\n\nAn approach in which machines are trained to favor basic behaviors and outcomes rather than explicitly programmed to do certain tasks. That results in optimization of both hardware and software to achieve a predictable range of results.\n\nMEMS\n\nMicroelectromechanical Systems are a fusion of electrical and mechanical engineering and are typically used for sensors and for advanced microphones and even speakers.\n\nMicrocontroller (MCU)\n\nA type of processor that traditionally was a scaled-down, all-in-one embedded processor, memory and I/O for use in very specific operations.\n\nNodes\n\nNodes in semiconductor manufacturing indicate the features that node production line can create on an integrated circuit, such as interconnect pitch, transistor density, transistor type, and other new technology.\n\n战俘er Gating Retention\n\nSpecial flop or latch used to retain the state of the cell when its main power supply is shut off.\n\n战俘er Management IC (PMIC)\n\nAn integrated circuit that manages the power in an electronic device or module, including any device that has a battery that gets recharged.\n\nQuantum Computing\n\nA different way of processing data using qubits.\n\nRead Only Memory (ROM)\n\nRead Only Memory (ROM) can be read from but cannot be written to.\n\nRecurrent Neural Network (RNN)\n\nAn artificial neural network that finds patterns in data using other data stored in memory.\n\nRedistribution Layers (RDLs)\n\nCopper metal interconnects that electrically connect one part of a package to another.\n\nReliability Verification\n\nDesign verification that helps ensure the robustness of a design and reduce susceptibility to premature or catastrophic electrical failures.\n\nRich Interactive Test Database (RITdb)\n\nA proposed test data standard aimed at reducing the burden for test engineers and test operations.\n\nRTL (Register Transfer Level )\n\nAn abstraction for defining the digital portions of a design\n\nRTL Signoff\n\nA series of requirements that must be met before moving past the RTL phase\n\nScan Test\n\nAdditional logic that connects registers into a shift register or scan chain for increased test efficiency.\n\nSensors\n\nSensors are a bridge between the analog world we live in and the underlying communications infrastructure.\n\nserializer/deserializer (SerDes)\n\nA transmission system that sends signals over a high-speed connection from a transceiver on one chip to a receiver on another. The transceiver converts parallel data into serial stream of data that is re-translated into parallel on the receiving end.\n\nShift Left\n\nIn semiconductor development flow, tasks once performed sequentially must now be done concurrently.\n\nShmooing, Shmoo test, Shmoo plot\n\nSweeping a test condition parameter through a range and obtaining a plot of the results.\n\nShort Channel Effects\n\nWhen channel lengths are the same order of magnitude as depletion-layer widths of the source and drain, they cause a number of issues that affect design.\n\nSide Channel Attacks\n\nA class of attacks on a device and its contents by analyzing information using different access methods.\n\nSilicon Carbide (SiC)\n\nA wide-bandgap technology used for FETs and MOSFETs for power transistors.\n\nSmall Cells\n\nWireless cells that fill in the voids in wireless infrastructure.\n\nSpiking Neural Network (SNN)\n\nA type of neural network that attempts to more closely model the brain.\n\nSpin-Orbit Torque MRAM (SOT-MRAM)\n\nA type of MRAM with separate paths for write and read.\n\nStandard Essential Patent\n\nA patent that has been deemed necessary to implement a standard.\n\nStatic Random Access Memory (SRAM)\n\nSRAM is a volatile memory that does not require refresh\n\nSystem In Package (SiP)\n\nA method for bundling multiple ICs to work together as a single chip.\n\n系统芯片(SoC)\n\nA system on chip (SoC) is the integration of functions necessary to implement an electronic system onto a single substrate and contains at least one processor\n\nSystemC\n\nA class library built on top of the C++ language used for modeling hardware\n\nThrough-Silicon Vias (TSVs)\n\nThrough-Silicon Vias are a technology to connect various die in a stacked die configuration.\n\nTriple Patterning\n\nA multi-patterning technique that will be required at 10nm and below.\n\nTunnel FET\n\nA type of transistor under development that could replace finFETs in future process technologies.\n\nUnified Coverage Interoperability Standard (Verification)\n\n互操作性标准(加州大学统一报道IS) provides an application programming interface (API) that enables the sharing of coverage data across software simulators, hardware accelerators, symbolic simulations, formal tools or custom verification tools.\n\nUser Interfaces\n\nUser interfaces is the conduit a human uses to communicate with an electronics device.\n\nVerification Plan\n\nA document that defines what functional verification is going to be performed\n\nVon Neumann Architecture\n\nThe basic architecture for most computing today, based on the principle that data needs to move back and forth between a processor and memory.\n\nWafer Fab Testing\n\nVerifying and testing the dies on the wafer after the manufacturing.\n\nWired communications\n\nWired communication, which passes data through wires between devices, is still considered the most stable form of communication.\n\nZero-Day Vulnerabilities, Attacks\n\nA vulnerability in a product’s hardware or software discovered by researchers or attackers that the producing company does not know about and therefore does not have a fix for yet."
