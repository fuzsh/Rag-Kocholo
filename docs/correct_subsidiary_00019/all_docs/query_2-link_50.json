But does it mean anything to you? Have you ever though of your city as \"dumb\"? Let's see, do you think there is waste of energy and resources in the city? You want to help, but don't know the best way? Or are you fed up with having to constantly look for information about urban services, and not having the power to improve them?\n\nThis talk is for If answered yes to at least one of those questions.

Therefore is essential to facilitate healthy ageing, with autonomy and independence, allowing seniors, if they desire, to remain active in the labor market for the longest period of time possible. For societies a new challenge raises, on how to think about active ageing and a more proactive attitude for promoting people wellbeing and autonomy.\n\nAAL solutions require multidisciplinary efforts and cooperation and development models centered in the citizen and their living space, ensuring comprehensive and integrative care.\n\nThe project Smart Companion addresses the challenges presented before and in the first place, tries to include the elderly in the information society by simplifying and redesign the communication interfaces of a smartphone (by simplifying the process of making calls, send messages, share photos / videos and emotional state) . The solution creates a social ecosystem that includes senior, family and formal caregivers (social workers, doctors, nurses, etc.), involving all of them actively in the ageing process.\n\nBio\n\nMr. Filipe Sousa received a M.Sc. in 2008 from Electrical and Computer Engineering (University of Porto), Master in Business Information (Catholic University of Porto) and the Certificate Cisco Network Professional (CCNP).
