        "text": "This is a textbook of pure mathematics written to meet the needs of the student studying for the General Certificate of Education at Advanced Level. The book assumes a knowledge of mathematics up to Ordinary Level and covers all the pure mathematics necessary for the Advanced Level examination in mathematics (A26), of the Northern Universities Joint Matriculation Board, together with the great majority of the work required for the Advanced Level examinations of the Southern Universities Joint Board, the Welsh Joint Committee and London University. The teaching method adopted is for the most part that suggested by the various reports of the Mathematical Association. The emphasis throughout has been on technique, although we have tried to indicate where a particular result needs more rigorous justification than is given in this book. In this way, we hope that all students can progress quickly in the understanding and application of these techniques without the hindrance of having to justify everything they do. This latter step comes at a later stage in their mathematical development. For convenience, the book has been prepared in the order algebra (Chapters 1-5), trigonometry (Chapters 6-8), calculus (Chapters 9-16), and co-ordinate geometry (Chapters 17-20), but this is not to imply that the chapters should be read in this order. For the student at school, this will be decided by the teacher; for the student working alone, we would recommend an advance on a broad front through Chapters 1, 3, 6, 9, 10, 12 (the first two sections), 13, 17, 18. This lays the foundations for all the main topics and this broad advance can then be maintained. We would suggest that each of Chapters 7, 11, 14, 15, 16 and 20 be read in at least two stages. Not only will this make for easier digestion of the many ideas and techniques discussed in these chapters, but will also provide for constant revision and extension of this material. The book includes over 350 worked examples and about 1800 examples for the student to solve. The worked examples indicate the main applications of the ideas and techniques discussed. The exercises set at the ends of the sections within the chapters are for the most part fairly straightforward. All our readers should attempt these exercises. The exercises at the ends of the chapters are a 'mixed bag'. Some are of a routine type, others are more testing; many are from past papers set by the various examining boards. Finally, there are some (indicated with an asterisk) which are of a more difficult\n\nCommunication technology has become pervasive in the modern world, and ever more complex. This introductory textbook allows students to understand the principles underlying the reliable transmission of information by focusing on the most basic ideas of digital communications. Carefully paced, logically structured, and packed with insights and illustrative examples, this is an ideal textbook for anyone who wants to learn about modern digital communications. • The simple, logical presentation covers the fundamentals in sufficient detail to allow students to master the basic concepts in digital communications without being overwhelmed. • Step-by-step examples and extensive problem sets, including MATLAB exercises, allow hands on use of the key concepts, to reinforce learning. • Mathematical derivations are complete, but kept clear and simple to ensure a thorough understanding. • Initial chapters provide background material to remind students of the basics. • Advanced topics and applications are also covered to stimulate the reader's interest and appreciation. • Extensive illustrations provide an intuitive understanding of the derivations and concepts. where he has developed and taught undergraduate and graduate courses in signals and systems, digital communications, error control coding, and wireless communications.
