From 1997-2001 he was a senior research engineer at the Embedded Systems group at the University of Dortmund. Between 1999-2001 he was also a project manager at ICD, where he headed industrial compiler and processor simulator tool projects. In 2002, Dr. Leupers joined RWTH Aachen University as a professor for Software for Systems on Silicon. His research and teaching activities revolve around software development tools, processor architectures, and electronic design automation for embedded systems, with emphasis on C compilers for application specific processors in the areas of signal processing and networking. He authored several books and numerous technical papers on design tools for embedded processors, and he served in the program committees of leading EDA and compiler conferences, including DAC, DATE, and ICCAD. Dr. Leupers received several scientific awards, including Best Paper Awards at DATE 2000 and DAC 2002. He has been a co-founder of LISATek, an EDA tool provider for embedded processor design (acquired by CoWare Inc. in 2003).\n\nEnrico Macii\n\nEnrico Macii holds a Dr. Eng. degree in Electrical Engineering from Politecnico di Torino, Italy, a Dr. Sc. degree in Computer Science from Università di Torino, and a Ph.D. degree in Computer Engineering from Politecnico di Torino. From 1991 to 1994 he was an Adjunct Faculty at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Currently, he is a Full Professor of Computer Engineering at Politecnico di Torino. His research interests include several aspects of the computer-aided design of integrated circuits and systems, with particular emphasis on the design of low-power systems.\n\nPeter Marwedel\n\nPeter Marwedel received his Ph.D. in physics from the University of Kiel (Germany) in 1974. He worked at the Computer Science Department of that University from 1974 until 1989. In 1987, he received the Dr. habil. degree in computer science. Since 1989 he is a professor at the Computer Science Department of the University of Dortmund. He served as the Dean of that Department between 1992 and 1995. Dr. Marwedel heads the ICD, a private technology transfer centre at Dortmund and is actively promoting the use of research results in industry. Dr. Marwedel worked on the MIMOLA high-level synthesis system since 1975. Later, he added retargetable compilation to his scope. This led to the current research focus on compilation for embedded systems. The results of his group include advanced compiler optimization algorithms for embedded systems, leading to improvements in run-time and energy efficiency. A recent trend is to connect this work to timing analysis tools. This trend is considered in the ARTIST2 network of excellence on embedded systems in Europe, for which Dr. Marwedel is a core team member. Dr. Marwedel is also active in teaching. The most visible result in this area is the recently published text book “Embedded System Design”. In addition to teaching at Dortmund University, he also teaches at ALARI (Lugano) and EPFL (Lausanne).\n\nHeinrich Meyr\n\nresearch and management positions in industry before accepting a professorship in Electrical Engineering at Aachen University of Technology (RWTH Aachen) in 1977.
