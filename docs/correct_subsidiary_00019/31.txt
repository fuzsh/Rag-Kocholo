EDA’s acquisition era arrived close on the heels of the EDA era. SDA merged with ECAD to form Cadence in 1987, and the new company’s first acquisition was in 1989. The company has made nearly 40 acquisitions to date. Synopsys incorporated in 1986, and its first acquisition was in 1990. The company has made more than 100 acquisitions to date. Mentor Graphics metamorphosed from a dying CAE company into a vibrant EDA company around 1993, and its first post-metamorphosis acquisition was in 1997. The company made at least 15 acquisitions before being acquired itself in 2017 by Siemens. All three of these leading EDA companies entered the acquisition derby in an attempt to outgrow the other two competitors in the EDA arena – growth being measured in total revenue.

The acquisitiveness of these three big EDA companies manifested a microcosmic EDA industry that produced little EDA startups designed for the chief purpose of being acquired. The late Jim Hogan started his EDA journey at Cadence more than 30 years ago. He was both a consultant whose advice was widely sought by the EDA community and a developer of EDA startups, groomed to be acquired by one of the big three EDA companies, first through Cadence’s Telos Venture Partners and later through his own Vista Ventures, founded with his friend Scott Becker. Hogan would find some bright, entrepreneurial engineers with an idea, fund or get funding for them, and then harvest his investment sometime later by finding a buyer for the company. I had the privilege of being one of Jim Hogan’s many friends. Hogan passed away in 2021.

Below is a list of the acquisitions made by the big three EDA companies, listed by date, by the acquired company’s name, and by the purchased technology. These lists are not exhaustive, but show the diversity of the tools and technologies offered by these EDA startup companies. This list boggles the mind.

Some of the acquisition histories listed above intersect with my own career. I worked for several of the companies listed above including Cadence, Denali Software, and Tensilica. In addition, the VeriBest PCB design software acquired by Mentor Graphics in 1999 incorporates the remnants of the PCB tools that were originally developed by Cadnetix, where I worked as a design engineer from 1982 to 1985.

In compiling these acquisition lists, I was struck by the tremendous collective effort people have put into the EDA tools we use today. It gives one pause. For some of the acquisitions listed above, the engineers working for the acquired companies found new positions with one of the big three EDA companies. Other acquisitions were technology acquisitions, which means the people at the acquired company hit the streets to look for new employment. The above lists therefore paint an accurate picture of the roiling, dynamic nature of the EDA industry, akin to the popular novel and TV series “Game of Thrones,” but with slightly less bloodletting.
