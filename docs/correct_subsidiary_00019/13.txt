Automatic rapid prototyping of semi-custom VLSI circuits using Actel FPGAs

GLSVLSI '95: Proceedings of the Fifth Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI (GLSVLSI'95)

We describe a technique for translating semicustom VLSI circuits automatically into field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) for rapid prototyping to develop a system. Using an array multiplier as an example of this translation, the VLSI circuits are ...

Rapid Prototyping for XR

CHI EA '22: Extended Abstracts of the 2022 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems

This course teaches principles of rapid prototyping for augmented, virtual, and mixed reality (XR). Participants will learn about low-fidelity prototyping with paper and other physical materials, and digital prototyping including immersive authoring. ...
