Biography

Joseph Andrews was born about 1597 in England, since he was about 38 years of age when he migrated in 1635 and 83 years at death in late 1679.[1] He was the only child, a son of PGM immigrant Thomas Andrews based on a land record. He immigrated to the New World in 1635 with his father, presumably his wife, and two or three of their older children[1] and lived in Hingham, Plymouth, Massachusetts.

Joseph had married Elizabeth before 1632 when their oldest child was born.[2] He was a planter and a tailor; tools used by a tailor were a part of the inventory following his death.[1]

Joseph had a grant of a house-lot in Hingham on Town (North) St., Sept. 18, 1635. The lot was next to his father's (Thomas Andrews), and contained five acres, including back land. Living in Duxbury in 1657, he sold the five acres along with a meadow for L12. On October 16, 1665 Joseph and Elizabeth "for valuable consideration"sold to Thomas Andrews of Hingham "our naturall Sonne...all that our house Lotts Containeith tenn acres of Land with all the houses Orchards & fences Standing & being upon the sd house lot...salt meadow.. land at Pyne Hill...land called Rocky necke." Again on September 10, 1679 Joseph "for valuable consideration" sold to his son Thomas, "all my Shares of Land in all the four divisions of Connihasset upland and also a right of Commons belonging to the sd two shares...lately given and granted to the sd Joseph Andrews of the town of sdHingham."[1]

At the court on July 8, 1635 he was sworn as constable of Hingham, then called "Barecove" and was the first town clerk. In 1636, 1637, and 1638 he was one of the representatives of the town of Hingham at the General Court. He removed to Duxbury, and in 1654 was surveyor of highways, and constable in 1664.[1]

At a later date he returned to Hingham, and died here 1 Jan 1679-80, about 83 years. His will, which is on file in the S. P. office, and "dated at Hingham 27 Sept. 1679," mentions and provides for wife Elizabeth; gives to son Joseph, among other valuables, "my sword, gold ring, and a bible; "to son Ephraim"; mentions daughter's and grandchildren, and gives "to each of my grandsons that bear my name Joseph " a pewter platter.[3]His widow, Elizabeth, died 12 August 1688 at Hingham.[1]

Children:[1]

Elizabeth Andrews, born in England about 1621 (she was the first child named in her father's will); died after July 12, 1693; probably married in Hingham on May 26, 1648 to Mark Emes/Eames, son of Anthony and Margery (_____) Eames. Mark born about 1617 and died between July 12, 1693 and September 13, 1693.

Hannah Andrews, born in England about 1623 based on death age (listed second in father's will); died at Scituate on July 10, probably 1701 at the age of 78 years. She married Matthew Gannett, son of John Gannet. Matthew baptized at Charlton Mackrell, Sommerset on February 16, 1617/18 and died at Scituate on October 10, probably 1695 at the age of 77 years.

Thomas Andrews, born in England in November of 1632 (date not from original record) and died on an expedition of Canada on November 25 or 26 1690. It is assumed he was the oldest son since he was the residuary heir and executor of his father's will. He married Ruth (_____) who was born about 1636 died after October 23, 1732 in Hingham.

Mary Andrews, born about 1635 and was the third child listed in her father's will. She died after September 27, 1679; married _____ Beard. Some say she was married to Thomas Beard of Boston, however the Boston couple were having children as late as 1685, so the dates don't point to him as her husband.

Joseph Andrews may have been the child baptized in March 1637/8 as "Elizabeth." He is listed fourth in his father's will and was living on September 27, 1679. His fathers will states, "if hee comes to demand it."

Ephraim Andrews was baptized in August 1639 (not from original source). He was listed fifth in his father's will; was living on September 27, 1679; settled in Woodbridge, N. J. by 1673.

Hepzibah Andrews was born about 1641; sixth in father's will; died probably at Piscataway, New Jersey after December 30, 1692. She charged Richard French with fathering her child, did not appear in court, so he was acquitted. She was married about 1661 to Jeffrey Manning, son of John and Elizabeth (Goodye) Manning; baptized at Hawstead, Suffolk England on March 17, 1638/9; died at Piscataway on January 26, 1692/3.[1]He was not the son of John Manning of Boston.[4]

Research Notes

Disputed mother: While the father, Thomas Andrews is correct and sourced, the mother previously attached to this profile, Mary Simon Andrews is not sourced. Additionally a daughter Abigail Andrews is unsourced and was not named in his will. A granddaughter Abigail was named there. They have been detached. Should a reliable source arise in the future, they may certainly be re-attached.

Possible first wife:Joseph Andrews may have possibly been married first in 1621 to an unknown wife; then to Elizabeth in 1632. Under Commentary in "Early New England Families" the authors discuss the birth order of the children, concluding with this statement: "We have to accept that the children's birth order is reflected in the order in which they are named in the will, with the exception that the eldest son is listed last as residuary legatee." Further concluding at the end of the article, "The question about whether Joseph Andrews had two wives, remains open. The nine-year gap between Hannah's birth and that of Thomas, and the 22-year span between the birth of daughter Elizabeth about 1621 and daughter Hepzibah about 1643, although achievable for one mother, lacking marriage and birth records, we have to keep the possibility of two mothers in mind."[1]

Joseph was born in 1597. He was the son of Old Andrews-Andrus and Elizabeth Andrews. He passed away in 1680.
