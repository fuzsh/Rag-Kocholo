        "text": "Donald Malone Andrews, 66, of Arnoldsville, GA passed away on November 10, 2023. He was born on May 31, 1957 in Columbus, Georgia to the late Sybil Smith Andrews and John Joseph Andrews, Sr. Don was a jack of all trades, and master of them, too. He was a licensed electrician, plumber, and general contractor before joining Tweedell and Van Buren Oil Company and later All Phase Environmental, where he worked for over 35 years with his longtime friend Tommy Tweedell. He was an avid collector of memorabilia, loved the river, being outdoors, the Georgia Bulldogs, an evening nip of Jack Daniels, and generally having a good time. Gracious and kind, Don never met a stranger. He made friends at the bank, the courthouse, and the local Kroger. He had a good word to say about every person he met and every meal he ate.\n\nHe is survived by his brother John Andrews (Nancy) and sister Karla Murphy (Jim). He loved their children as though they were his own: nephews Jay Andrews (Jennell) and Christopher Andrews (Cassie), and nieces Lindsey Andrews, Elizabeth Prince (David), and Hannah M. Bugg (Bryan), as well as grandniece Caroline Prince and grandnephews Jackson and Davis Prince. In passing, he joins his life’s companion, the recently-departed Edith Coley—may they care for each other in the next life, as they did in this one.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family kindly requests that memorial donations be made to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, 501 St. Jude Place, Memphis, TN 38105; or another charitable organization.\n\nA memorial service will be held at Lord and Stephens Funeral Home EAST, located at 4355 Lexington Road, Athens, GA 30605, on Monday, November 13 at 11:00 AM. The family will receive friends at the conclusion of the service.\n\nLord and Stephens, East is in charge of arrangements."
