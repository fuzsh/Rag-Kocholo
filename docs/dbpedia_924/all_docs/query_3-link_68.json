        "text": "Born and raised in St. Joseph, Joey Andrews is a fourth-generation small business owner and attorney who is getting results for us as State Representative. Joey knows there’s more work to do, so he’s running for re-election in Michigan's 38th House District to keep putting southwest Michigan first.\n\nAfter graduating from Lake Michigan Catholic Schools, I earned dual Bachelor’s degrees in History and Music, followed by a Juris Doctor degree from Wayne State University. Returning home post-law school, I spearheaded efforts to revitalize his family's business during the Great Recession, gaining firsthand understanding of community challenges.\n\nSince taking office, Joey has shown unwavering commitment to progress and advocacy. He led efforts to repeal damaging “Right to Work” laws and defended reproductive rights, ensuring access to essential healthcare services. His support helped pass the expansions of the Elliott Larsen Civil Rights Act, which has advanced equality statewide.\n\nMoreover, Joey's tenure witnessed significant investments and advancements in the district. Spearheading initiatives on crucial issues like shoreline erosion, he secured funding for vital studies and projects, safeguarding the region's natural resources. Joey's leadership also attracted major economic developments, including the historic Palisades Nuclear Energy Project. Re-electing Joey is essential for the continued progress and prosperity of Michigan's 38th House District."
