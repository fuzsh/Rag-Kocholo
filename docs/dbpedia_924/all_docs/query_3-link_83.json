        "text": "Retired Master Chief, Robert W. Andrews, Jr., went home to be with our Lord and Savior, Jesus on October 28, 2023. He was 70 at the time of his death. Bobby was born on November 13, 1952, in Madisonville, Texas. Bobby was the third child to Ruth \"Honey\" & Dick Andrews, along with his two older siblings.\n\nBobby was preceded in death by his paternal grandparents, William E. \"Brushy Bill\" & Ruth Andrews; maternal grandparents, Lela Ball Lynch & T. Benton Lynch; parents, Dick, Sr. & Ruth Andrews; and his beautiful niece, Traci Andrews Theiss.\n\nBobby is survived by his wife, Vickie L. Andrews; son, Joseph Andrews; bonus daughter, Elizabeth Anne Maklary; son-in-law, Joshua Maklary; grandson, Wyatt Maklary; brother, Tommy Andrews; sister-in-law, Janet Andrews; sister, Donna (Andrews) Nash (Sue Ann Ferguson); nephews, Clay Nash, Cari Andrews, Chris Nash, Kevin \"Dink\" Andrews; and many great nieces and nephews.\n\nBobby was an alumni of Madisonville High School where he enjoyed the football team & FFA. Bobby loved everything about Madisonville and his family but he was destined for a life away from his extremely close & loving family.\n\nShortly after graduating Madisonville High School, Bobby enlisted into the United States Navy where he excelled at his position in Cryptology, and then in his later years his career transitioned into Recruiting. Bobby served his country for over twenty-six years, he met brothers for life, including family members, and many joined just from his enthusiasm.\n\nAfter his service to his country, Bobby went to work at Planet Ford, where he met friends and his future wife, Vickie. Bobby enjoyed several good years relaxing, watching his son play football, mowing, his grandson, Wyatt, and his family.\n\nBobby was taken far too soon from his loving famliy due to cancer. He fought hard and never asked God, \"Why me?\" His wife finally asked him why he had never questioned God and Bobby's answer was so simply put, \"If it IS me then my son, grandson, nephews, great nieces and nephews, and my other family members will hopefully stay healthy.\" Bobby loved his family and would do anything for them, and we were lucky to have him. Now, he will dance across the clouds of heaven with his beautiful mama and niece, Traci, as he patiently waits for more loved ones to join him.\n\nA funeral service for Robert will be held at 10:30 A.M., Saturday, November 4, 2023 at Madisonville Funeral Home, Madisonville, Texas. Bro. Dennis Ivey will officiate the service. Interment will follow at Andrews Cemetery, Madison County, Texas. Friends and family are invited to a visitation at the funeral home on Friday, November 3, 2023 from 6 P.M. to 8 P.M. to offer their condolences and share their memories.\n\nPallbearers: Clay Nash, Dink Andrews, Jeff DiTota, Travis Williams, Andy Wagley, Matthew Johnson.\n\nHonorary Pallbearers: Tommy Andrews, Joel McClain, Dwayne McClain, Salvador Ola, Don LaBarge, Tom Dijon, Larry Campbell, Bill Fick.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the Madisonville High School FFA or football program. Checks can be mailed to P.O. Box 879, Madisonville, Texas 77864, attention Annette Andrews. In the memo section, please write either FFA or Football.
