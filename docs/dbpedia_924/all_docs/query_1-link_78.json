For many of the images, I’ve included the backstory behind the image to provide further context or to share why that image was particularly important to me.\n\nAs always, the editing for this project is both subjective and personal. Yes, there are some historic moments included but mostly I was looking for behind-the-scenes moments that give people a more personal look at the President and First Lady. And I’ve included a few that I thought were just cool photos.\n\nI hope you enjoy this final Year in Photographs of the Obama administration. It’s been the honor of a lifetime to be a witness to history these past eight years.\n\n— Pete Souza, Chief White House Photographer\n\nSee more White House photos:\n\nBehind the Lens: 2015 Year in Photographs\n\nBy Pete Souza, Chief Official White House Photographer\n\nmedium.com\n\nIn Photos: A Look Back at President Obama’s Last Overseas Trip\n\nPresident Obama on Monday concluded what is expected to be his final foreign trip in office, traveling over the course…\n\nmedium\n\nBehind the Lens: Official State Visits Through The Years\n\nTuesday, October 18, marks the 14th and final formal State Arrival Ceremony and State Dinner for a head of state during…\n\nmedium.com"
