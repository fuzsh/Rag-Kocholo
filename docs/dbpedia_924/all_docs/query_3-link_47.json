        "text": "In the comfort of his home on Tuesday, July 23, 2024 at the age of 66 with his loving and dedicated wife Nancy (nee Kruschinske) by his side. Cherished step-father of Anthony Bucci (Meena), Jessica Schizkoske (Brandon) and Nicole Laidlaw (Cameron), Ricky, Robert and the late Joshua Saracino. Proud papa of Emma, Gabriel and Jordan Laidlaw; Brody Schizkoske; Vito and Tilly Bucci. Much loved brother of Chris (Dawn), Charlie (Connie), Kathy (Rick), Patty (the late Rob) and Sharon Andrews. Fondly remembered brother in-law of Eileen McBrien (Glen), Conrad Kruschinske (Lisa), Sharon Glover (George), Joan Chaput, Wendy Chippure (Paul), Sheila Legere (Rodney), Betty Kruschinske, Jimmy Kruschinske, Cheryl (Barry) and the late Marlene Chaput (Ken) and Ronald Kruschinske. Son of the late Desmond and Grace Andrews (nee Beauchamp) and son-in-law of the late Evelyn and Ernest Kruschinske. Survived by many nieces, nephews and friends.\n\nBrian will always be remembered for his unwavering love for the outdoors. He found true happiness in the midst of the forest, gliding through the waters in his canoe, and fishing with a passion that was unmatched. Brian's connection to nature was profound, and his presence in the wilderness brought peace and joy to all who were fortunate enough to share in his experiences. His legacy serves as a timeless reminder to appreciate the beauty and serenity of the natural world."
