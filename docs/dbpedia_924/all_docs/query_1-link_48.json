        "text": "Designed in the Federal style by an unknown architect, the extravagant mansion was built by John Andrew, a Salem merchant specializing in the fur trade with Russia. But within 10 years of its construction, John Andrew was bankrupt and lost ownership of it. The house is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe first thing you might notice is the piazza on the west side of the house. It features four colossal scale doric columns carved from solid timbers.\n\nThe interior woodwork is attributed to Joseph True, a master carpenter who had apprenticed to Samuel McIntire. A three story staircase leads to all floors of the house. Delightful federal details include interior glazed fan lights over double door entryways. John Andrew went to extraordinary expense to build this house and the solid mahogany doors throughout still retain their original mercury glass knobs.\n\nThe opulent home is a reflection of very sudden and extreme gentrification of the neighborhood in the golden years of Salem’s economic boom. But the 1820s in Salem were extremely turbulent from an economic standpoint and many merchants who built houses similar to this one found themselves destitute. The house passed into the Safford family in the 1860s and came to PEM through its parent institution, the Essex Institute, who acquired it in 1947 as the residence for the Executive Director. Today the mansion is used for rentals, internal meetings and private functions."
