Joseph Andrews house

Description:

This dwelling, located on Center Bridge Road, was built for Joseph Andrews around the time of his 1831 marriage to Thomazine Phillips of Boston. Andrews was engaged in copper- and steel-plate engraving for the Carter and Andrews Printing and Publishing Company, which operated in Lancaster from about 1825 to 1835. When Carter and Andrews failed, the house was repossessed by the builder.
