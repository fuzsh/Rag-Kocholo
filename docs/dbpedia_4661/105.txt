A24 has acquired U.S. rights to Alex Garland’s directorial debut Ex Machina and has set a release date of April 10, 2015. Garland, who penned 28 Days Later and Sunshine, also wrote the thriller, which stars Oscar Isaac, Domhnall Gleeson, and Alicia Vikander.

The plot centers on a programmer (Gleeson) at an Internet-search giant who wins a competition to spend a week at the private mountain estate of the company’s brilliant and reclusive CEO (Isaac). Upon his arrival, he learns he has been chose to be the human component in a Turing Test — charging him with evaluating the capabilities, and ultimately the consciousness, of the CEO’s latest experiment in artificial intelligence. That experiment is Ava (Vikander), whose emotional intelligence proves more sophisticated, seductive and deceptive than the two men could have imagined.

DNA’s Andrew Macdonald and Allon Reich produced, and Scott Rudin and Eli Bush executive produced with former Film4 head Tessa Ross.

Universal International Pictures is distributing internationally.
