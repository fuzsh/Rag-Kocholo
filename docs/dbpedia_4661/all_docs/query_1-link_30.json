        "text": "Top Ten Hollywood Movie Studios[]\n\nThe Top Ten\n\n1Warner Bros Studios\n\nWarner Bros. founded in 1923 by four Warner brothers. The best known for perhaps biggest favorites are: Looney Tunes, Merrie Melodies and Warner Bros. characters. Warner Bros. movies like Tenet, Wonder Woman 1984 and more and Tom and Jerry, Looney Tunes and Barney the Purple Dinosaur, Classic movies Like Harry Potter, Gremlins and The Goonies Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight DC Classics like Superman Returns and 300 Scooby-Doo The Matrix 1923-1989 Warner Bros film Library to Sony Pictures.\n\nIt's too bad that Tenet and Wonder Woman 1984 did not perform well at the box office due to the Covid 19 pandemic. The movie theaters never should have been shut down! I don't care about HBO Max at all. I like cinema because it's a massive experience. You can see all the details on a massive screen with all of the details. Television is small. Why pay low for streaming when you can pay for a ticket in a cinema?\n\nBy far the best studio of the big 6. Amazing directors like Stanley Kubrick and Christopher Nolan have made some of the best movies of all time. WB has made some of the best franchises including The Matrix, Mad Max, Batman and Dc as a whole, and Harry Potter. Even their children's movies like the Lego Batman movie and Space Jam are thoroughly entertaining and genuinely funny.\n\nWarner Bros is a out an out undefeated king of studios. Warner Bros not only makes tons of amazing film franchises, but also the only companies that explores through every genre of movies and take risks of different contents. Absolutely amazing. The reason I do not vote for Disney is because Disney has limited content other than buying companies (eg. Marvel, Pixar, Lucasfilm) for content and remaking movies. Don't get me wrong, Disney films are fantastic but we are looking for enough contents, not grosses. Like Warner Bros. 2Walt Disney Studios\n\nDisney founded in 1923 by Walt Disney and Roy O. Disney. The best known for perhaps biggest favorites are: Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Toy Story, Pirates of the Caribbean, Disney characters and Pixar characters.\n\nDisney is pretty much the future of film and overall media. Here's why.\n\nFirst off, as of July 16, 2017, Disney makes up for about 22% of the box office, topping all of the other major studios. Second, they own TWO major animation studios, Disney Animation and Pixar, the latter of which helped produce the first feature-length computer animated film. Third, they own a well-known record label, Hollywood Records, with a vast label of artists, despite not being as large as Universal or Sony. Fourth, they are responsible for a large number of live stageplays based on their films (remember \"The Lion King\"? ). Disney franchises includes Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Cinderella, Mary Poppins, The Lion King, The Little Mermaid, Toy Story, Pirates of the Caribbean, Lilo & Stitch, Star vs. the Forces of Evil, Phineas and Ferb, Lizzie McGuire, Pinocchio, Tarzan and others. Fifth, they own Lucasfilm and Marvel Studios, both of which are responsible for two of the largest film franchises, Star Wars and the Marvel Cinematic Universe, respectively. Sixth, they own ABC, one of the largest television production and distribution companies. Other companies in ABC's portfolio include A&E, History, Lifetime, and ESPN. Finally, they own Maker Studios, a ...more\n\nIt's kind of amazing when you think about it...\n\nA few years ago (like twenty) Disney was primarily known for animated kids movie. They stood out only because of the hardwork they put into their projects, the originality, and the heart.\n\nEverything from box office sucesses like \"Aladdin\" and \"Beauty and the Beast,\" to severely underrrated films like \"Oliver and Company.\"\n\nThey took risks, and maybe all of them didn't pay off... but they got there.\n\nThey bought Pixar, giving that astudio the funds they needed to bring excellent movies like \"Wall-E\" and \"Up.\"\n\nThey stepped up their own animation game as well, with instant classics, like \"Moana,\" and \"Big Hero 6.\"\n\nThey own Marvel, and have fostered its unprecendented success.\n\nThey turned Star Wars into box office gold, after some thought it irredeemable.\n\nThey bring a sense of fun, and heart to their movies, while their quality is unbeatable.\n\nNow, just yesterday they bought twentieth century fox, I could not be more ...more\n\nWalt Disney has to have ever been the most creative movie director to ever have set a foot on earth. He took old stories and classics and fairy tales from generations behind and making them more kid-friendly perfectly. Also, the characters Disney made up himself are just great, Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, blah blah blah. Just everything is done nicely, you just know when you see a fictional character you know it's Disney.\n\nNo doubt, Walt Disney is now the number 1 studio of the world, followed by Universal Pictures for its outstanding film series. Walt Disneyy Studios produces and distributes some worldwide hit movies, such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Pirates of the Caribbean, Toy Story, etc. With the integration of Marvel and Lucasfilm, it finished several more steps behind. 0\n\n320th Century Studio\n\n20th Century Fox founded in 1935 by William Fox, Joseph M. Schenck and Darryl F. Zanuck. The best known for perhaps biggest favorites are: Marilyn Monroe and 20th Century Fox characters.\n\n20th Century Fox ruins Marilyn Monroe, Die Hard, Avatar, The Simpsons and Family Guy and into Japanese Anime and manga series like VeggieTales and other anime shows.\n\nI'm not a fan of this studio because a lot of their movies suck like Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials (the first and third movies were okay), they ruined Murder on the Orient Express, Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Percy Jackson, Alvin and the Chipmunks (all 4), the two latest Ice Age films, and let's not forget the Marvel stuff they ruined like Fantastic Four, X-Men: The Last Stand and Apocalypse, and more.\n\nTheir good movies are as follows: The Martian, Hidden Figures, Die Hard, Deadpool, Logan, The Planet of the Apes new trilogy (the old franchise sucks though), and X-Men: Days of Future Past. I might be forgetting something.\n\nHello. My name is Gordon Richard I a Canadian east coast. Not to much movies out there that I have not seen. But I also travel a lot and listen to people, over the last 5 years the movie industry has stoped leading the role of giving the one thing that the public what's.. Movies that are NEW... Not much left out there really get that part but.. Think of this one space, why space because a movie before this age was a form of the unone you never seen before now we no it all so space.. Not one like fighting or defend earth but a movie about them helping to build our furture ships, travel, longer life's, cleaner water new type of cars, that runs on salt water my idea, P. S I think it would work to.. But just a open the eyes again movie new thank you face book\n\nHi, Paramount!: Dear 20th Century Fox: Blue Sky Studios shutting down Big Idea now folded into the Hollywood film studio 20th Century Fox and the Greenwich Computer animation studio Blue Sky Studios. To My Knowledge, 20th Century Fox's Blue Sky Studios shutdown Big Idea that Folded into Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation for Greenwich, Connecticut inside Blue Sky's office like the titles such as VeggieTales, LarryBoy, Larryboy: The Cartoon Adventures, 3-2-1 Penguins, Ice Age, Rio, Robots, Ferdinand, Nimona, Foster, The Peanuts Movie Horton Hears a Who!, Jonah/The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything, Ice Age/VeggieTales franchise, Ice Age TV series, Ferdinand TV series, The VeggieTales Show (2019), Rio TV series, Epic TV show, Robots TV series, VeggieTales in the House/City, Spies in Disguise TV Cartoon series and more by 2021. 4Marvel Studios\n\nMarvel studios is the most overrated franchise of all time. Thumbs up if you agree with me. As Martin said, marvel movies aren't cinema. They are just watch & Forget movies with below average to average at best. But they are overrated because critics get paid & there are many reasons why critics overrate them which the movies do not deserve. Apart from Captain America movies & Tobey & Andrew Spiderman movies, marvel movies are nothing but immature, filled with plot holes, fart jokes etc. I believe Marvel studios is just a tag & it is nothing without Dizny & their critics. Every single MCU Dizny movie was overrated. I mean seriously, incredible hulk, iron Man 3, Thor movies, homecoming AOU, Captain marvel are better than MOS, Aquaman, Joker? Lol! These critics will have to pay in the hell! I respect opinions not agendas...\n\nReasons why MCU would never get an Oscar... Black panther did but everybody knows why & that they didn't deserve them...\n\nMarvel be like, in order to be ...more\n\nI love marvel studios. Mostly because of spider man and captain america though. But it's awesome.\n\nTheir films are guaranteed successes, pretty much, and everyone's copying them. They're golden.\n\nIt is my favorite movie studio because of it's so many superheroes and supervillains and its best action. 5Universal Studios\n\nI Think Universal buying Happy Tree Friends for $75,000,000 is rated TV-14 content for Kids, Teens, Grown-ups 17+ only with Universal Pictures making Happy Tree Friends movies for bloody theatrical releases adding gruesome Box Office for a buck each with Chips, Candy and Drink, No Popcorn Needed and Silver Big Screen for Film Camera! Cuddles: Let's make Happy Tree Friends movies from Universal - RIP Kurt Cobain 1967-1994\n\nFlippy kills you, or next Universal Pictures buys Happy Tree Friends to kids getting hurt by the grunge singers Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic from the Nirvana members...\n\nUniversal buys Happy Tree Friends for $75,000,000 for the Peacock adding TV-MA rating on the Adult TV series for 21+ or older to Raising Happy Tree Friends for Grunge musicians for 21 and up and is not for kids.\n\nJurassic Park, Despicable Me, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Fast and Furious serie, King Kong, Ted, Meet the Fockers, Bruce Almighty, Jaws, The Bourne serie, Les Misérables, The Mummy serie, Snow White and the Huntsman, Back to the future serie, Apollo 13, The Lorax, The Grinch, Schindler's List, A Beautiful Mind, Bridesmaids, The American Pie serie, American Gangster, Waterworld, 8 Mile, Safe House and on and on... Just one of the greatest, should be at least in the top 3. 0\n\n6Paramount Studios\n\nParamount buys 20th Century Fox to Offer Japanese film companies acquisition of Big Idea shows such as Japanese anime version of VeggieTales, 3-2-1 Penguins! and Larryboy: The Cartoon Adventures from Sprinkle, Fokkusu, FoxNext Kyoto, Fox High and Fox Tokyofilm.\n\nParamount buys 20th Century Fox properties like Big Idea shows VeggieTales, 3-2-1 Penguins!, Larryboy, X-Men/Deadpool, Batman (1966), The Simpsons, Family Guy, Ice Age and more by 2021\n\nDear Paramount: Viacom buys Fox assets for $92 Billion for cash for the film studio 20th Century Fox owns Blue Sky Studios titles with Ice Age, Robots, Ice Age: The Meltdown, Horton Hears a Who! Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs, Rio, Ice Age Continental Drift, Epic, Rio 2, Ice Age: Collision Course, Ferdinand, Spies in Disguise, Foster, VeggieTales, LarryBoy, Larryboy: The Cartoon Adventures, 3-2-1 Penguins!, The VeggieTales Show, Jonah/The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything, Veggietales in the House/City and other Paramount/Fox's Blue Sky releases in 2023/2045.\n\nA Hollywood studio generally doesn't mean much in the context of the quality of a film. However, perhaps the biggest success rate of film is derived from Paramount Pictures. \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" is an American classic, as are \"Psycho\" and \"The Bad News Bears\". In addition, the Paramount logo is easily superior to its competition. 7Columbia Pictures\n\nSony wants to buy WarnerMedia to pick up Warner Music Group for $50 billion for cash on the ownership: Sony Sony Pictures Columbia Pictures Warner Bros. Warner Music Group Sub Pop (now under a label of Warner Bros. Records) and Looney Tunes (WB) and much more by 2023.\n\nHow Sony Purchased WarnerMedia (now Warner Bros. Holdings) for $94 billion to challenge Disney, see Sony's Columbia Pictures and Warner Bros. merged to make Sony's WB movies from Columbia Pictures by 2027.\n\nSony is Evil! Spider-Man movies moving to Disney, Next year by 2027.\n\nNot the best but they've got some great stuff. 8Sony Pictures Studios\n\nSony is Gay, Marvel and Spider-Man rights to Disney on ABC to Disney XD and Spider-Man fights Sony Pictures and Marvel defeats Sony Pictures, Sony raping People, not Spider-Man of course Disney knows about Spider-Man but Marvel is silly and Sony is not and Sony going Bankrupt.\n\nThe Amazing Spiderman 1, The Amazing Spiderman 2, The Social Network, The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo, 22 Jump Street, Skyfall, Hancock, Casino Royale, 2012, Salt, The Karate Kid, Men In Black 3, Looper, District 9, Resident Evil:Retribution, Underworld Awakening, Quantum Of Solace, Zombieland, Captain Phillips, Fury, The Equalizer, Django Unchained, Terminator Salvation, The Tourist, The Smurfs, The Smurfs 2, Arthur Christmas, The Adventures Of Tintin, Elysium, Total Recall, Monsters House, Kung Fu Hustle, House Of Flying Daggers, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, The Patriot, Black Hawk Down, Vertical Limit, Charlie's Angels, Charlie's Angels Full Throttle, Hitch, Ghost Rider, Superbad, Hotel Transylvania, Here Comes The Boom, This Is The End, 21 Jump Street, Evil Dead, Bad Teacher, Stuart Little, Air Force One, Men In Black, Moneyball, Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs, Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs 2, Grown Ups, Grown Ups 2, Zookeeper.\n\nThis studio is not doing the best job with its franchises, it seems. They squandered Spider-Man twice, the 'Total Recall' and 'RoboCop' remakes disappointed, their latest Bond film was a letdown, and the new 'Ghostbusters' is being ridiculed six ways from Sunday. They need to get in gear.\n\nWhat? They suck. They make The Emoji Movie. Even though they make good movies such as Baby Driver, The Social Network, and Sausage Party. 9Dreamworks Studios\n\nI don't like dreamworks. They keep on competing with Disney but they are no match. Disney has been around a whole lot longer.\n\nI like film stories 0\n\n10New Line Cinema\n\nLord of the Rings, Dumb and Dumber, Se7en, The Notebook, Blade, American History X and the more that doesn't take itself too seriously. There's just a lot of variety from this Warner studio that it's highly entertaining\n\nIsn't new line, no more. Final editor is warner?\n\nThe releaser of the unbelievable Lord of the Rings trilogy and many more great movies The Contenders\n\n11Pixar Animation StudiosPixar, also referred to as Pixar Animation Studios, is an American computer animation film studio based in Emeryville, California that is a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company. Pixar began in 1979 as the Graphics Group, part of the Lucasfilm computer division, before its spin-out as a corporation ...read more.\n\nWow, I'm really surprised that Pixar isn't at least in the top ten! Pixar Animation Studios has produced so many influential, deep films that I'm very surprised that only 3% of the people who took this survey thought it was the best. Filled from beginning to end, most Pixar films (I exclude Cars 2, because it didn't have a very strong message) have amazing messages, scores, ideas, and plots. The characters in EVERY single film are well thought out and believable, as well as very entertaining. For example, Woody from Toy Story was wholly original, just as Mike Wazowski was extremely memorable. The movies are all funny, and all have amazing messages. From the delightful yet simple message of Cars, to the originality and uniqueness of Monsters, Inc, Pixar has made a name for itself in history. Let's not mention the fantastic scores that EVERY SINGLE Pixar film has! Randy Newman shines the brightest, in my opinion, with amazing creations such as 'You've Got a Friend in Me', 'I Will Go ...more\n\nToy Story, Toy Story 2, Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, Wall-E, Up, Toy Story 3, Inside Out - I only just listed the best movies that they've put out.\n\nAmazing simple the best\n\nHow is this so far down! 12MGM Studios\n\nJames Bond, Rocky, Creed, Silence of the Lambs, Carrie, Raging Bull, The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly, The Wizard of Oz, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Poltergeist (1982), Child's Play, Singing in the Rain, Robocop, The Terminator, Roadhouse, The Hobbit, Jeepers Creepers, Spaceballs...MGM made so many great films, I can't name them all.\n\nIt's a great studio but that lion scared the crap out of me as a kid and still scared the crap out of me today. I like their movies only if I better watch out with that Leo The Lion. I have a pantheraphobia (fear of big cats) and that's actually no joke about my fears.\n\nMGM dominated Hollywood for decades. They WERE the gold standard for success in the industry. I am doubtful any movie studio will ever replicate the decades of sunshine and roses MGM had.\n\nThe original studios Ben-Hur, Gone With the Wind, Wizard of Oz, Singing in the Rain, Gigi, Showboat, Guys and Doll, Pink Panther, Skyfall, Casino Royale and Rocky. 13Legendary Pictures\n\n14Miramax Films\n\n0\n\n15Lions Gate Entertainment\n\nHunger Games series. My favourite studio!\n\nComing up in January 2018: The Commuter.\n\nThe hunger games series\n\nI don't have one 16Touchstone Pictures\n\n17DC Films\n\nI like dc very much\n\nThey are amazing 18Lucasfilm\n\nStar Wars! My favorite franchise!\n\n19Paramount\n\n20United Artists\n\n21RKO Pictures\n\n22The Weinstein Company\n\nA producer of Mini-major films, this should have been No. 10.\n\n23A24\n\nThey make some great movies but fly under the radar too often. List of good movies are Spring Breakers (I know people are split on this), Bling Ring, The Specacular Now, Room, Green Room, Equals, Ex-Machina, and The Witch."
