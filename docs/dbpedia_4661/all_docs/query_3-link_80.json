        "text": "PARK CITY, Utah — At the Sundance Film Festival here in January, executives at A24, the upstart movie and television studio, stood in the back of a makeshift theater looking as if they were about to be physically ill.\n\nA24’s latest offering, “Eighth Grade,” an intimate coming-of-age dramedy set for release in theaters on July 13, was minutes away from its festival premiere. What if the audience hated it? “This movie is just so personal for me,” Nicolette Aizenberg, an A24 executive, said to someone who had just asked why she was quite literally shaking in her brown snow boots.\n\nThere was zero reason to worry: “Eighth Grade,” directed by the 27-year-old comedian Bo Burnham, received sustained hoots of approval from the hipster attendees and universal raves from critics, likely setting up the film as another art house hit for A24, a little New York company that has — seemingly out of nowhere — established itself as Hollywood’s leading tastemaker brand: Miramax for a new generation.\n\nSince starting five years ago, A24 has delivered one cultural thunderclap after another, peaking with “Moonlight,” last year’s surprise winner (especially to the folks of “La La Land”) of the Oscar for best picture. Other A24 hits over the past few years include “Spring Breakers,” about college girls who get mixed up with a messianic drug and arms dealer; the creepy-cool “Ex Machina,” which introduced the future Oscar-winner Alicia Vikander to most viewers; “The Lobster,” a dystopian cult favorite; and the Oscar-winning “Room” (Brie Larson for best actress). Among the A24 films up for Oscars at this Sunday’s Academy Awards ceremony are “The Disaster Artist” (adapted screenplay) and “The Florida Project” (Willem Dafoe, supporting actor).\n\nBut the studio’s biggest hit so far, both critically and commercially, is the film nominated for five Oscars this year, including best picture: Greta Gerwig’s “Lady Bird,” which has collected about $50 million in North American ticket sales. (Its other Oscar nominations include best director, for Ms. Gerwig, and best actress, for Saoirse Ronan.) Scott Rudin, a producer of both “Lady Bird” and “Eighth Grade,” said in an email that A24 has “the best team I have ever worked with anywhere, and since I am now approaching Methuselah’s age, that is a considerable statement.”"
