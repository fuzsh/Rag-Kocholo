        "text": "There are three main characters in “Ex Machina,” and one of them is Ava (Alicia Vikander). She is not just a pretty face. The rest of her head, too, is very pretty: a dome of fine metallic mesh, atop a delicate stalk of clear neck, through which we see the glow of blue diodes and the play of mechanical muscles. The pattern continues below. Parts of her, like the bust, are politely encased, while others, like the legs and the stomach, are transparent, with luminous coils and loops where her guts should be. When Ava walks or turns, she gives off sounds—tiny whirrs and hisses, as of rods and pistons sighing into place. If necessary, her frame can be robed in strips of flesh, to fashion a complete young woman. In all, she seems absorbingly real, enough to overshadow the non-robotic people she meets. That is both the coup and the pitfall of “Ex Machina”: the humanoid is more human than the humans.\n\nAva’s creator is Nathan (Oscar Isaac), a loner of bottomless wealth. At the age of thirteen, he wrote the code for Bluebook—“the world’s most popular Internet search engine.” Now he is a guru with all the fixings: cropped hair, a thicket of black beard, a burning stare. He resides, with Ava, in a research facility, among meadows and mountains, attended by a silent servant named Kyoko (Sonoya Mizuno). One day, a helicopter brings Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson), “the most talented coder in my company,” according to Nathan. Beware of movies that jack themselves up with superlatives, as if straining not merely to catch but to merit our earnest attention; in “Ex Machina,” the strain increases as Caleb declares, “I’m hot on high-level abstractions,” and as Nathan beguiles him in return. “You’re good with words, you’re quotable,” he says. Sorry, guys, that’s for us to decide.\n\nCaleb’s task is to put Ava through the hoops: to determine, in a series of interviews, whether she can truly think, and even feel, for herself. If so, she will represent—you guessed it—“the greatest scientific event in the history of man,” as Nathan modestly claims. There are seven conversations (titled “Ava: Session 1,” and so forth), and they are the endoskeleton to which the story clings. To begin with, they have the lurch of an unsuccessful speed date. “You like Mozart?” Ava inquires. “I like Depeche Mode,” Caleb replies. During the second session, however, there’s a power cut, and, under blood-red emergency lighting, and with Nathan unable to listen in, she murmurs to Caleb, “You shouldn’t trust anything he says.” The plot is in motion, although who is pulling the strings—Pinocchio or Geppetto, so to speak—becomes ever harder to decide. Ava has no doubt that she exists, but she fears that such existence can be terminated. “What will happen to me if I fail your test?” she asks Caleb. “Do you think I might be switched off?”\n\nThat faint tapping you can hear is scholars already drafting their lectures on the mind-body problem in “Ex Machina,” adding it to the roster of films, from “Metropolis” to last month’s “Chappie,” that make philosophers go soft in the hard drive. But a movie can tackle a host of interesting themes and still be a bad movie, as anyone who saw a befuddled Johnny Depp grope his way through “Transcendence” can attest, and there are times when the gears of “Ex Machina,” which was written and directed by Alex Garland, begin to grind. The third session is particularly glum, proving that the spirit of screwball has yet to descend upon robotics. “How do I look?” Ava says. “You look,” Caleb begins, and there follows a long hunt for the mot juste: “Good.”\n\nAnd yet “Ex Machina,” despite the stutters, slowly finds its grip and starts to squeeze. Garland, whose scripts have often prowled the zones of science fiction (he wrote “28 Days Later,” “Sunshine,” and “Never Let Me Go”), is making his début as a director, and his method feels patient to a fault. There is little excitement, even at the climax, but the creepiness of the setup generates its own hum of suspense, and you hunger for more details of exactly what Nathan has devised. “I had to get away from circuitry,” he tells Caleb, showing him a manufactured brain—a beauteous clump of gel, the size of a conch, its innards writhing with synaptic sparks. Oscar Isaac is someone filmmakers turn to for a cautious intensity, and here he dials it up, leaving us nicely uncertain whether Nathan is a dauntless pioneer or a dangerous loon. Hanging over him—and also over Kyoko and Caleb, who at one point slices his own arm as if to cry, “Do I not bleed?”—is a suspicion, inherited from “Blade Runner,” that anyone can be a replicant, perhaps unwittingly so. Hence the great sequence in which Nathan and Kyoko start to boogie, their rhythms so seamlessly attuned that you wonder if dance can be downloaded, like an app. If perfection is inhuman, though, what should we make of Fred Astaire?\n\nIn the end, “Ex Machina” lives and dies by Alicia Vikander. The film clicks on when she first appears, and it dims every time she goes away. She will be much in evidence this year, with six movies set for release, but Ava may be hard to beat. Her initial “Hello” to Caleb, with half a question mark hovering after it, echoes the “Hello” with which another Ava marked her ominous entrance. Viewers of “The Killers,” in 1946, saw Ava Gardner swivel on a piano stool, greet Burt Lancaster, size up the poor lunk, and let him know with a single smile, to his infinite delight, that he was doomed. You would think that the new Ava, being man-made, would be less of a femme fatale, but she can still unmake a man with her imitation of a femme—putting on clothes, shoes, stockings, and a wig, then removing them, in semi-silhouette, when she is sure that Caleb is watching.\n\nThat is pure calculation, of course, easily arranged by a programmer as dexterous as Nathan, yet Vikander, brimful of an eagerness not so much to engage with the world as to toy with it, does suggest that Ava has slipped the bonds of her inventor. Such is the dream of movies like “Ex Machina,” “I, Robot,” and “A.I.”: an intelligence that sloughs off its own artifice. The components of Spielberg’s movie didn’t quite slot together, but the leading androids—Haley Joel Osment, as the kid, and Jude Law, as the smooth-skinned gigolo—were touching in their aspirations, and Vikander somehow twines them both, the innocent and the decadent, into the figure of Ava. We are reminded (and this is why such films, strong and weak alike, keep coming along) that the goal of robots is not merely to serve us without causing harm, as Isaac Asimov proposed, but to play a part. They are Method humans, reaching deep into their software to beget a replica of truth. Ava doesn’t just need to get out of Nathan’s house, and fast. She needs an agent.\n\nHappiness, in the first half hour of “About Elly,” is passed around like the flu. A bunch of college friends get together for a weekend away, most of them with spouses and small children. The friends are no longer young, yet their spirits seem buoyantly high, and the movie is keen to join in—glancing at face after face, and eavesdropping on the overlapping chat. Characters dance without warning, answer a question with a line of song, and play charades. They have to shift from one rental villa to another, but the move doesn’t faze them, even though the new place has broken windows and no beds. Besides, it’s right on the beach. You can hear the crash of the surf.\n\nAt what point we realize that disaster awaits, and that these contented lives, like all lives, can be caught in a riptide, is hard to specify. Suffice to say that something happens, and that husbands, wives, and old pals who felt inseparable descend into a roiling recrimination. It’s difficult and upsetting to behold, but we shouldn’t be surprised; the director is Asghar Farhadi, who mapped out the pangs of divorce in “A Separation” (2011). “About Elly” was made two years before that, but only now is it being released, and, perhaps because the action is confined to Farhadi’s native Iran, it’s a better movie than “The Past” (2013), which was set, more tentatively, in Paris. Here, by the treacherous sea, Farhadi is at home, and, as is his custom, it is women who emerge from the crowd of characters and come, heavy-laden, to the fore.\n\nOne of them is Elly (Taraneh Alidoosti), the only single woman in the group, described as “warm and calm.” She is also inscrutable, and, when she recedes from the action, whereabouts unknown, the mystery darkens. She was invited by Sepideh (Golshifteh Farahani), who, despite barely knowing her, was hoping to marry her off to one of the guys. As the plot proceeds, we get an unnerving sense that the whole film, whose early stages bore such a modern and liberated ease, is gradually re-rooting itself in old, tenacious beliefs—in a world where honor and shame run deeper than the mere matter of whether a person is alive or dead. “About Elly” both clutches us tight and shuts us out, adding wave upon wave of secrets and lies. Charades were just the beginning. ♦"
