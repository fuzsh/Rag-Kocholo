        "text": "pisher | November 1, 2005 10:08 AM\n\n\"First of, I'd like to say that I despise science fiction as a genre, and find it for the most part cheesy and ridicolous.\"\n\nThat's because you don't know what science fiction is. Star Wars is not science fiction, it's just fantasy with science fiction trappings--just as Serenity is a western with science fiction trappings. Star Wars was top-rate fantasy, at least as far as the first two films are concerned--they're among the finest fantasy films ever made. Serenity hardly qualifies as one of the finest westerns ever made. Whedon doesn't understand science fiction or westerns. He was out of his depth.\n\n\"I hate Star Wars; the only thing more intolerable than that George Lucas crap is the stupidity of Star Trek.\"\n\nYou know, it's that attitude, as much as anything else, that had Star Wars and Star Trek fans staying away from this movie. Obviously neither qualifies as the highest possible cinematic achievement, but they've endured the test of time, and entertained countless millions of people, as well as conveying some messages worth hearing. I'm still trying to figure out Serenity's message--I think it's mainly \"JOSS WHEDON IS NEVER WRONG!!!\"\n\n\" To me, that brand of science fiction is for drippy, odd-looking nerds who have more action figures than they do friends.\"\n\nThat description fits the Firefly/Serenity fans I've seen a lot better, frankly. You might want to check out the article linked below, where a reviewer who liked Serenity (but apparently not enough) talks about how Serenity fans are basically the most fanatical nerds in genreland.\n\nhttp://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/logout?blogid=3&entry_id=1077\n\n\"Firefly/Serenity was different, in my. I was introduced to the series by a friend who adores Joss Whedon/sci-fi, two things I didn't really care for, and only watched it after some severe nudging on her part. I surprisingly loved it, finding it deftly written and the characters round, diverse and rather grounded for a genre usually more focused on its odd aliens and robots than its flatly written characters. \"\n\nWell, we don't agree. I found the Serenity characters to be basically a collection of poorly rendered western stereotypes, enacted by charisma-deficient actors. But again, you're assuming science fiction means Star Wars and Star Trek, and boy are you missing out.\n\n\"That is why it irks me to see someone insult Serenity or Firefly, or to call it badly written.\"\n\nWell, it irks me when somebody calls the work of Gene Coon and Dorothy Fontana \"badly written\", but it's still your right to think so. I think the fact that people are still watching and enjoying their Star Trek episodes, 40 years after they were written, tends to argue against that opinion, but again--subjectivity rules.\n\n\"Jesus Christ, for sci-fi, Serenity was freaking Shakespeare compared to the crap that comprises the bulk of the genre!\"\n\nBtw, does it bother you at all that one character in this distant star system, 500 years in the future, references Revlon Cosmetics, but nobody mentions Shakespeare?\n\n\"I mean, I'm certainly not comparing it to Citizen Kane or anything like that, but it was undoubtedly one of the best damn science fiction movies ever.\"\n\nI'd be interested in seeing your top ten list. Well, luridly curious would probably describe it better. (g)\n\n\"Also, for anyone to claim or imply that Serenity is rightwing is absolutely proposterous and is certainly reaching to come to that conclusion.\"\n\nWell, that may be so, but if you checked out the links I posted, you'll see that the top American rightwing magazines all thought that it was a stirring endorsement of their political beliefs, as well as a cracking good piece of entertainment. I'd have posted reviews from Mother Jones, The Nation, The Progressive, The New Yorker, In These Times, Rolling Stone, etc--except there weren't any reviews of Serenity in those publications.\n\nIt is a simple undeniable fact that rightwing bloggers were courted by a paid PR firm working for Universal, to gain their support for this movie. They were given free tickets to advance screenings, and all kinds of other perks. And so were progressive bloggers, to be sure. And btw, I wasn't saying EVERYTHING about the movie was rightwing, merely that a section of the rightwing really loved the movie, and had good reason to do so.\n\n\"On the utmost surface, Serenity preaches a dislike for big government, something that the good old Southern boys usually stand by (God bless the USA).\"\n\nFeel free to start pointing out where I was wrong, anytime you're ready. (g)\n\n\"Perhaps I wouldn't label Serenity as \"progressive\" in terms of race, but I wouldn't call it counter progressive either.\"\n\nAgain, I never said the movie was actively racist. It just assumes that White People are the center of the universe. Literally. Even in a universe ruled by Chinese People.\n\n\"It simply isn't true that any character who wasn't white was killed off\"\n\nIt simply isn't true that I said that was true. But since there are only three black characters in the movie, killing one is a pretty big deal--and a pretty old cliche. You know--the black guy always gets it first?\n\n\"if that were the case Zoe would be dead instead of white-as-you can-get-Wash.\"\n\nZoe might as well have been dead, for all her relevance to the story. But again, there are three black characters--one is killed off, one is simply not important to the story in any way, and one is the bad guy.\n\n\"And I wouldn't call Zoe marginalized; I think if the character could hear you imply that about her she'd sock you in the face.\"\n\nOooh! I'm so scared the badly written fictional black woman from the future will come and kick my ass!\n\nIn my opinion, however, if Zoe suddenly popped into flesh and blood existence here on our mortal plane, the person she'd want to punch in the face would be Joss Whedon, for making her such an insubstantial and irrelevant presence in the series and the movie. There have been many far more compelling and central black characters in the history of genre film and TV. Gina Torres has been kicking ass throughout much of her acting career. Why give Joss Whedon credit for casting her as the general type of tough-talking ass-kicking character she's played in the past--and then mainly ignoring her?\n\n\"As a person of color, I get so sick and tired of people telling \"us\" how oppressed \"we\" are. It's more insulting than Serenity could ever be.\"\n\nWell, I wasn't aware I was in the presence of somebody empowered to speak for all \"persons of color\". So I guess that completely invalidates the comments from that Asian blogger linked near the top of this thread (which I strongly suspect you didn't even bother to read) who felt the movie basically used Asians as a gimmicky plot device, and had no understanding of Asian culture, even though the world of Serenity is supposedly dominated by Asians? I guess being a person of color, you get to tell other persons of color what to think? Is that how it works?\n\n\"I do think Firefly is progressive in terms of science fiction.\"\n\nAnd you say this from the perspective of somebody who hates science fiction, and obviously knows very little about it. Hmm. Convincing.\n\nIt was very progressive to cast a black woman as a crew member of the Enterprise, back in the 1960's, when black characters on any TV show were rare, however marginal her character usually was. It was progressive to have the Chief Engineer of the Enterprise be a black man, back in the 1980's. It was somewhat progressive to have the Chief Engineer of the Starship Voyager be a half-latino/half-Klingon woman (whose captain was also a woman), back in the 90's. And I still think Voyager sucked, but that's a whole different argument. (g)\n\nIt is not progressive to have one black crew member in a movie released in 2005, who basically has almost no dialogue, and no compelling reason to be in the story at all, other than that she was in the TV series the movie is based upon. There have been many many science fiction movies with black characters far more central to the story, and far more interesting than Zoe. If you don't agree--well, I can't say as I much care, since you obviously haven't seen very many science fiction movies. You probably didn't like Revenge of the Sith very much--frankly, neither did I. But I note in passing that the head of the Jedi Order, and the most powerful Jedi alive is played by Samuel L. Jackson. And The Matrix movies, for all the flaws in the last two parts of that trilogy, put a LOT of black people in center stage, to the point where you could go through whole scenes without SEEING any white people.\n\nBut in a universe supposedly ruled by Chinese people, nearly everyone we see in Serenity is white. It's not racist, I suppose. It's not particularly anti-racist either, now is it?\n\n\"Part of the reason why I liked it is because it had none of the flash of Star Trek, whose Enterprise would probably cruise right over Serenity if they ever came to exist in the same imagined realm.\"\n\nYou sure like imagining what fictional characters would do in highly unlikely situations. You don't by any chance write any fanfic, now do you? (g)\n\n\"The characters in Firefly were certainly more realistic than the ones from Star Trek, all of whom wore sparkling neat suits on a sparkly neat ship and seemed to fit rather tidily into Keirsey temperament categories and display none of the variation one human can possess.\"\n\nThe characters in Serenity were a collection of badly drawn stereotypes drawn from a battery of poorly digested influences. They didn't strike me as real people at all, or as interesting fictional people. So I disagree with your assessment. And judging by the box office, most people disagree with your assessment.\n\n\"I liked how the people from Firefly were poor, and how most planets and moons did not possess the technology that the Alliance planets (in the minority) did, because it's rather close to how it is in real life. \"\n\nI didn't like how that idea was never consistently developed, since they somehow always had the technology they needed when they needed it. And I thought it was kind of odd that the planets on the outer fringes of this supposed \"Mega-System\" were all hot and dry, and the planets closer to the sun were lush and temperate. It was almost like Whedon wasn't thinking about what life in such a system would really be like, but was just looking for a way to justify having a lot of different worlds for his characters to visit, which would roughly correspond to various western movie stereotypes, but which wouldn't require faster than light travel.\n\n\"I don't deny that Serenity did poorly at the box office.\"\n\nAh. So you do acknowledge the validity of basic mathmatics? (g)\n\n\"I expected it would, because for the most part people who are attracted to science fiction are expecting an element (light saber fights, robots running around screaming \"danger, danger\") that Serenity was bold enough to steer clear of.\"\n\nWhat movie were you watching? Serenity used every cliche in the book, other than aliens and robots (actually there was a robot--a sex toy robot--ewww). I mean, this is a movie involving CANNIBAL ZOMBIES.\n\nAnd anyway, who says only science fiction fans go to movies like this? Look at the box office for Return of the Jedi--you telling me there are THAT many fangeeks out there?\n\n\"Serenity was not as good as the series,\"\n\nSpeaking as somebody who digs all kinds of TV shows, and whose favorite show right now is \"Deadwood\", I found it very hard to watch Firefly for more than five minutes. I thought it was just a flat, badly conceived, poorly written, badly acted failure of a show. And again, I was watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer before most Joss Whedon fanatics had even heard of the show.\n\n\"but hey, it was something. If you're not satisfied, perhaps you should go glue vulcan ears to your head and hang out with other overweight, forty year old losers, because obviously you're not looking for something new or of high quality.\"\n\nI've actually never been to a Star Trek convention in my life, nor do I dress up as characters from my favorite shows/films. I have respect for the more intelligent elements within genre fandom, but I appreciate Star Trek and other genre shows for their intelligence, originality and wit, none of which I found in Firefly/Serenity.\n\nHowever, you really ought to know that you just insulted the hell out of Joss Whedon, a major major fanboy, who embodies every single stereotype you just mentioned, except maybe the Spock ears--I think he was more of a Kirk fan. The hubris would have appealed to him. (g)\n\n\"Firefly/Serenity dared to be different, but I guess some people like the same old crap the sci-fi channel spews out 24-7.\"\n\nGee, with rational well-mannered supporters like you, it's hard to see why Firefly/Serenity isn't more popular among genre fans in general. :-|\n\n\"To continue what I was saying, this comment bothered me immensely. It is a rather stark generalization, and I find little parallels between the Browncoats and the Southern Aristocracy, except for the fact that they both sought independence, lost and were forced to reunify.\"\n\nThat's as may be, but Whedon specifically said the Browncoats were inspired by the American Confederacy.\n\n\"The reasons behind their independence movement are completely different,\"\n\nBut see, here's what you don't get. The reasons behind their independence movement are basically the same as what the rightwing revisionist historians of the Civil War say the reasons for the Confederate rebellion were. You've got to understand that there's a lot of people out there saying \"It wasn't about slavery, that was going to wither away over time--it was about the developed industrial North crushing the undeveloped agrarian South, whose people had a different more independent type of culture.\" That's what makes Serenity so attractive to some rightwing people. It basically rewrites history--these Rebs didn't have slaves. That we know about. Hell, there's hardly even any black people at all. And the villians are basically descendents of Communist China.\n\n\"and I doubt you could find specific examples to compare the Browncoats Indepedent [sic] movement with the Confederacy's.\"\n\nAgain, it's not about real history, but how history is repackaged for political purposes. Again, you just don't want to acknowledge how much many dyed in the wool conservatives liked this movie--and why they liked it.\n\n\"I could sight [sic] a million examples of people who have fought to free themselves from what they deemed to be an oppressive ruler, and I bet well over 3/4 will have more in common with the Browncoats than the Southerners did.\"\n\nWell, most Confederates saw themselves as fighting to free themselves from an oppressive ruler. And hey, wasn't that what the rightwing kept saying we were doing in Iraq? Helping Iraqis free themselves from an oppressive ruler?\n\n\"I did not know that Nathan Fillion was descended from a Confederate General, and I doubt 99.9% of others out there do either.\"\n\nI highly doubt 99.9% of others out there could pick Nathan Fillion out of a police lineup. (g)\n\n\"I do not think that is relevant at all to your argument, as that does not support the claim that Serenity is rightwing.\"\n\nI never said it did--merely pointing out why people who ARE conservative might find it one more reason to like the show and the movie.\n\n\"Do you mean to say that if an actor is descended from a Nazi, but in no shape or form today supports any of the beliefs that initially formed the Nazi party, that such a history can affect a role he plays or a film he plays in that has absolutely nothing to do with Nazism to begin with? That seems a little more than ludicrous.\"\n\nWell, ludicrous is what conservatives do best these days--if only some so-called progressives weren't every bit as blinkered and ignorant, we'd have a much better chance of demonstrating that, I think.\n\n\"So is the argument that because Firefly did not have gay characters, it must be rightwing.\"\n\nNo, the argument is that Firefly/Serenity is an easier show for conservatives to tout as 'their' genre franchise, because it avoids having any gay characters, and is heavily centered on white people who seem to share a lot of their core beliefs about government.\n\nWould you like me to repeat that argument again, using smaller words?\n\n\" Oh, christ almighty. I suppose because I have no friends who had abortions, I must strictly support pro-life.\"\n\nI suppose you will run out of the raw materialsa to make all those strawman arguments with eventually, but you do seem to have put in quite a large supply.\n\n\"That, of course, is ridicolous, and so is the assertion that anything without gay characters is conservative.\"\n\nAgreed, and I never made that argument. Anyway, a lot of conservatives liked Buffy the Vampire Slayer too--but understand something. A lot of Whedon fans say \"Whedon is progressive because he has gay characters in his shows.\" Well, leaving aside that he's only ever had three gay characters, all of them attractive lesbians designed to appeal to straight male fantasies, that argument is toast now, isn't it? Thanks. (g)\n\n\"Also as an aside to the poster with whom I am arguing with, I doubt you have a handle on what a \"good\" movie is, as you appear to like Star Wars, a consumer driven, piece of pop trash fueled by fans who would get up and cheer at three hours of Yoda dancing the macarena and then see it eight more times.\"\n\nWhoa! Impressive rant! :-D\n\nI actually only like the first two movies that much, but Star Wars is something most people have enjoyed at one time or another. Sorry you didn't. I certainly agree there are many far superior movies. I don't agree Joss Whedon has made any of them.\n\n\"Serenity was not the best movie ever, far from it, but I cannot stand when someone rather immaturely labels a movie as conservative propaganda simply because they did not care for it.\"\n\nI didn't label it. I merely pointed out that many conservative bloggers and writers and mainstream magazines have raved about how good it is, using language surprisingly similar to your own at points. They hate Star Wars too, you see--because they see it as being an attack on their politics. They see Serenity as being a defense of their politics. Take it up with them, please. ;)\n\n\"You have a right to not like something, but please, don't place it on the same level as \"The Birth of a Nation\".\"\n\nA deeply and unforgivably racist movie--which is also one of the greatest cinematic masterpiece of all time. And there's not a movie out there that isn't influenced by it, including Serenity.\n\nAfter all, isn't a central image of Birth of a Nation the scene where a young white woman is stalked by an evil black man, and avenged by a righteous white man who fought on the losing side of a civil war?\n\nHowever, in this case, the young white woman isn't helpless, and the black man isn't evil so much as misled, but even though the young white woman is the best fighter, it's still the righteous white man who fought on the losing side of a civil war who gets to fight and defeat the black villian who fought on the other side--isn't it?\n\nYou can't make Birth of a Nation today, because black people won't let themselves be victimized like that in the movies anymore.\n\nHowever, since 99.9% of black people will never even SEE Serenity......\n\nHey, you're the one who brought DW Griffith up. I never even thought of that parallel before.\n\nNice catch!\n\n:-D"
