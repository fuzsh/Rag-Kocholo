        "text": "\"The Force Awakens\" reignited the \"Star Wars\" franchise two years ago. (Disney)\n\nTroy L. Smith, cleveland.com\n\nCLEVELAND, Ohio – Science fiction and fantasy films have taken on new life during the 21st Century.\n\nTake, for instance, “Valerian.” The movie, which arrives in theaters this week, is visually dazzling. But it lacks a bit of substance.\n\nIndeed, sci-fi movies have to have as much heart and soul as they do eye-popping visuals these days. It’s a hard formula to master. But these are the movies that have done it best since the year 2000.\n\nA24 Films\n\n20. \"Under the Skin\" (2013)\n\nScarlett Johansson gives the best performance of her career as an alien being that looks like a supermodel but will literally rip your heart out.\n\n20th Century Fox\n\n19. \"Avatar\" (2005)\n\nSome day we’ll get those “Avatar” sequels, right? The reason we’re willing to wait is because James Cameron created an amazing world of stunning visuals with the first film. It wasn’t perfect, but it certainly left us in awe.\n\nParamount\n\n18. \"Interstellar\" (2014)\n\nChristopher Nolan’s “Interstellar” is all over the map with plot details that are hard to wrap your head around. But the emotional and visual weight of “Interstellar” is hard to deny. It’s a movie that grabs you from the very beginning, whether you buy into all the space/time travel rhetoric or not.\n\nDreamWorks\n\n17. \"A.I. Artificial Intelligence\" (2001)\n\n“A.I.” may very well be Steven Spielberg’s most underrated film. It’s visually stunning, yet morally complex. In many ways it’s the futuristic version of “Pinocchio,” where all the main character desires is to become a real boy.\n\nRadius - TWC\n\n16. \"Snowpiercer\" (2013)\n\nBased on a French graphic novel, “Snowpiercer” is full of surprises. And it leads you to each one with amazing visuals and action sequences that are as mind-blowing as they are violent\n\nParamount\n\n15. \"Star Trek\" (2009)\n\nThe first “Star Trek” reboot/remake got it right by giving us the characters fans love in a cool environment while never slowing down the action. Too bad the sequels didn’t live up to the hype.\n\nParamount Pictures\n\n14. \"Arrival\" (2016)\n\nThe arrival of aliens doesn’t have to be about their plans for the destruction of Earth. Sometimes, it’s just about communication, which the movie “Arrival” teaches us with a thrilling plot, awesome visuals and great performances.\n\nTwentieth Century Fox\n\n13. \"War of the Planet of the Apes\" (2017)\n\nThe latest “Planet of the Apes” trilogy hasn’t gotten the attention of other recent blockbuster franchises. But it’s, arguably, better than all of them. “War for the Planet of the Apes” just came out. Yet, it’s already staked its claim as the best “Planet of the Apes” film of them all.\n\n20th Century Fox\n\n12. \"The Martian\" (2015)\n\nMatt Damon delivers the goods in Ridley Scott’s “The Martian,” often giving viewers a one-man show that never leaves you bored. But the most surprising aspect of “The Martian” is just how funny it is, giving you a sense of joy in this Oscar contender.\n\nSony Pictures Entertainment\n\n11. \"Looper\" (2012)\n\n“Looper” has one of the best concepts of any futuristic film. But it also makes you think about life, love and what sacrifice is truly about. In many ways, it’s an old-school western dressed up in sci-fi gloss.\n\nNew Market Films\n\n10. \"Donnie Darko\" (2001)\n\n“Donnie Darko” seems so old compared to the other movies on this list. But for anyone who’s scene it, the impact lasts. Sixteen years later, it’s still a film with a ton of wild ideas that somehow fit together so perfectly.\n\nSony Pictures\n\n9. \"District 9\" (2009)\n\nNeill Blomkamp uses all the technical tricks he can, along with emotional storytelling to give us a sci-fi film that is one of the best examinations of classism we’ve seen put to film.\n\n+'{\n\n8. \"The Force Awakens\" (2015)\n\n“Star Wars: Episode VII” doesn’t reinvent the wheel. In fact, it basically copies the original trilogy. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, as it proved a fun ride that has reignited the greatest movie franchise of all time.\n\n20th Century Fox\n\n7. \"Minority Report (2002)\n\nEven 15 years after it came out, Steven Spielberg’s “Minority Report” still seems so inventive. It’s a movie that moves swiftly through a ton of awesome ideas that are executed in compelling fashion. It’s a sci-fi movie with a great who-done-it twist.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n6. \"Gravity\" (2013)\n\nDirector Alfonso Cuaron works a ton of miracles with his visual storytelling in “Gravity.” But he couldn’t have pulled it off without Sandra Bullock’s emotionally gripping performance that drives everything home.\n\nn\n\n5. \"Ex Machina\" (2014)\n\n“Ex Machina” raised the bar for the subject matter of science-fiction movies. The special effects are pretty amazing. But the story takes center stage, making you question the idea of what it means to be human.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n4. \"Her\" (2013)\n\nFew love stories are as weird and amazing as “Her,” the tale of a guy who falls in love with his operating system. The idea seems crazy, but Spike Jonze pulls it off with stellar performances from Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johansson (using just her voice). It’s the viewer who winds up making the biggest emotional connection.\n\nPixar\n\n3. \"Wall-E\" (2008)\n\nPixar struck visual gold with “Wall-E,” its most impressive feature up until that point. Yet, even while focusing on the film’s amazing look, we get a main character to love and root for.\n\nCourtesy of Warner Bros. Picture\n\n2. \"Inception\" (2010)\n\nSometimes thinking about “Inception” feels like you’re having a dream within a dream. Christopher Nolan’s dazzling picture had it all, from amazing special effects and great characters to a variety of plot twists that keep you guessing. It’s a dazzling display of filmmaking and one of the best things Nolan has ever done.\n\nUniversal Studios\n\n1. \"Children of Men\" (2006)\n\n“Children of Men” was not a box office success. But it’s a true masterpiece about how a futuristic society falls apart when humans lose the ability to reproduce. The story and the film represent pure chaos. But Alfonso Cuaron finds meaning amidst it all. It’s a thought-provoking tour de force that leaves you mesmerized."
