        "text": "The Pac-12 has struck a new partnership with Curastory and Tempus Ex Machina to provide student athletes with resources to create monetised name, image and likeness (NIL) content.\n\nContract:\n\nTempus Ex Machina’s FusionFeed technology will be used to create game highlights for athletes to distribute across their digital and social media channels\n\nThis will be available to college football players from early 2023\n\nCurastory also allows student athletes to seek out potential partner brands and sponsors\n\nContext:\n\nThe deal marks the Pac-12’s latest effort to capitalise on the growing name, image and likeness (NIL) space. Last year it partnered with Twitter and Opendorse last year to allow National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) athletes to monetise their own highlights on social media for the first time.\n\nIn September, content and monetisation specialist Curastory was one of nine startups selected for the Trailblazer Venture Studio’s accelerator programme which is aimed at companies which support gender equity.\n\nComing next:\n\nThe Pac-12 wants to open new revenue streams for student athletes and benefit from greater digital engagement that will allow the conference to expand its audience ahead of its next broadcast rights cycle.\n\nIts existing US$3 billion-a-year media contract with Fox and ESPN is set to expire next year, and the conference is aiming to maximise the value of its next agreement."
