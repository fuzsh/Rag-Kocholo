        "text": "Introduction\n\nWhen I was 15 or so, I bought a physical copy of Alex Garland’s directorial debut film Ex Machina at the Best Buy in San Carlos. That movie was not the beginning of my cinephilia, but it was a big part. The company that distributed it in the US, but did not produce it, was A24. What I would soon learn, and believe for a long time, about A24 is that they are the company that puts out good movies. It is important to note that this reputation that A24 has cultivated makes no distinction between distribution and production.\n\nAfter this, I gravitated toward what are commonly called “indie films.” I later found out this just means they were made without the backing of a major studio, but even that gets a little muddy when you get in the weeds about it. At the time, A24 seemingly had a monopoly on the idea of the independent film studio, so I watched many of its movies. In many circles, knowing A24 and their films gives you a sort of social capital. It made you look like an intellectual, a cinephile, because A24 had acquired this image as the studio that released heady, thought-provoking movies, an aesthetic of prestige. However, this kind of cinephilia is a vulgar kind of cinephilia.\n\nThe most notable cinephilic movement began after World War II, in France, among the future founders and writers of the influential film magazine Cahiers du Cinéma, namely André Bazin, Jacques Doniol-Valcroze, François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Jacques Rivette, Claude Chabrol, and Éric Rohmer. For them, cinephilia was akin to any other kind of art appreciation and did their best to establish cinema as “the seventh art”. The difference between these cinephiles and the cinephilia associated with A24 is that these cinephiles were intellectually omnivorous. Their love for philosophy, literature, painting, and all they could get their hands on is present in their criticism, theoretical writing, and their films. For instance, Truffaut’s feature debut The 400 Blows draws heavily from his own childhood and his love for Balzac. Jean-Luc Godard’s 1963 film Contempt shows not only his love of the German expressionist master Fritz Lang (who also stars) but also Homer’s The Odyssey, in addition to the ever-present influence of the German playwright and theorist Bertolt Brecht in most of Godard’s work post-1960. These cinephiles displayed an intellectual curiosity not present in the more commodified cinephilia associated with A24 which is more focused on brand reputation and status than that of the French cinephiles who sparked modern cinephilia.\n\nSo, with the meteoric rise of A24 to becoming the biggest mini-major studio currently in business in just 11 years of existence, outpacing the likes of Lionsgate, MGM, and Gaumont, and a growing fanbase among filmgoers, a question arises: are there wider implications of A24’s business model and influence on the wider independent film industry, cinephilia, and the arts in general?\n\nAuteur Theory\n\nIn 1962, Andrew Sarris published the first English formulation of “auteur theory” in the film magazine Film Culture. “Notes on the Auteur Theory” would become a seminal essay in the development of American film criticism and has become the standard framework of film criticism and appreciation in American culture. Sarris adapted the idea of auteur theory from a series of Cahiers du Cinéma articles published between 1954 and 1957 but chiefly Francois Truffaut’s influential essay “A Certain Tendency of French Cinema” and the idea of the politique des auteurs, the policy of authors. The crux of auteur theory is that the director is to their film as an author to their book.\n\nWhat is most important to note from Sarris’s essay is his brief summary of auteur theory: “The three premises of the auteur theory may be visualized as three concentric circles; the outer circle as technique; the middle circle, personal style; and an inner circle, interior meaning. The corresponding roles of the director may be designated as those of a technician, a stylist, and an auteur” (43). Sarris’s idea of the auteur director requires them to understand cinema at a technical level, have a style distinct to them, and for their films to be told in a way that is only possible through cinema. The use of the word “auteur” has changed over the years, but these three tenets are still fundamentally there. A general understanding of auteur theory is necessary for this analysis of A24’s appeal and effects on cinephilia and the cinema itself because of A24’s capitalization on the concept of the auteur and promotion of a supposed in-house style, a characteristic of the auteur but on the level of the firm rather than the individual.\n\nThe Creation of the A24 Brand\n\nAlexander Joseph Brannan’s 2021 thesis, Artful Scares: A24 and the Elevated Horror Cycle, seeks to interrogate the ways in which A24’s distribution and marketing tactics of its “elevated horror” films show a broader trend in and a coherent style to the elevated horror genre cycle. Through their marketing and distribution strategy, A24 curates an image of itself that allows its brand name to serve as a sign of quality.\n\nBrannan notes that the critical reception to Ari Aster’s films Hereditary and Midsommar often center on Aster as a technically and tonally skilled director, an auteur. This, as Brannan points out, “was fueled by A24, whose press kit for Midsommar sold the film to critics as a ‘dread-soaked cinematic fairy tale’ from the ‘visionary mind’ of Aster” and that the company “marketed the film to critics through the frame of auteurism” (126). Aster, now an established part of A24’s “house style” (Brannan 1), has been absorbed as a sort of branding tool for A24. Brannan also notes that A24 still pointed to others who worked on the film, like director of photography Pawel Pogorzelski and production designer Henrik Svensson, but that these were only brief mentions and ultimately were subverted to the “championing [of] Aster as one of the company’s star auteurs” (126). But, contrary to what auteur theory and A24 have to say, cinema is collaborative by its nature. The highly influential filmmaker and one of the Hithcocko-Hawksians of Cahiers du Cinéma who established the politique des auteurs Jean-Luc Godard said in a 1984 interview with Gideon Bachmann for Film Quarterly, “I find it useless to keep offering the public the ‘auteur’ […] In general, there is a tendency today to consider the problems of the director without thinking that behind him there are many other figures equally important in the making of the film” (16). Godard has distilled the point! Directors are rarely lone wolves in the making of their films, and thus the auteur is not quite as solitary as auteur theory would have us believe. We cannot say that Hereditary or Midsommar would have been quite as successful had it not been for the respective lead performances of Toni Collette and Florence Pugh or the compositions of Colin Stetson and The Haxan Cloak. As noted above, A24 specifically marketed Aster’s sophomore feature Midsommar as a product of his “visionary mind” (“Midsommar”). Critical attention was almost exclusively lavished upon him as the sole artist behind his two feature films, “tipping the scales in the critical discourse around the films’ authorship to favor the writer-director as an auteur” (Brannan 127). A24’s championing of auteurism comes from the fact that the individual visionary is easier to market than a whole team of individuals with individual talents and tasks.\n\nFundamentally, however, A24 is a capitalist firm in search of profit. As Karl Marx notes in “Profit of Capital,” “The consideration of his own private profit is the sole motive which determines the owner of any capital to employ it” (40). And, as most will know, the basis of capitalism is the profit motive. So, although it may have been a great thing for the world of cinema that Ari Aster was brought to a wider audience, this is a fundamentally profit-driven action. If this were purely about bringing a great auteur to mass audiences, Robert Eggers’s film The Lighthouse, which came out the same year as Midsommar and was also produced by A24, would have been similarly distributed and marketed. Both Robert Eggers and Ari Aster received acclaim for their debut features: 2015’s The Witch and 2018’s Hereditary, respectively, with many calling them both promising new horror auteurs. Here, it becomes necessary to compare the two different strategies that A24 took with Robert Eggers and Ari Aster. (see table 1 for side-by-side comparison)\n\nMidsommar was released on Independence Day weekend in 2019 in 2,707 theaters to a $6,560,030 domestic opening. This is a stark contrast to the distribution strategy that A24 took with The Lighthouse: released on October 18 of that same year in only eight theaters, only expanding to a maximum of 978, to a $427,797 opening weekend. At first glance, this disparity may seem strange: two “prestige horror” films released just three months apart, both directed by promising young horror “auteurs,” and distributed and produced by A24. If we look a little more closely, the reasoning becomes clear. Aster’s debut, Hereditary, came out in the summer of 2018, just one year before Midsommar and The Lighthouse, and was A24’s highest-grossing film worldwide up until the release of Everything Everywhere All At Once in 2022, raking in $81,263,489. On the other hand, Eggers’s debut, The Witch, was released in 2015, four years before Midsommar and The Lighthouse, and only brought in $40,429,635 worldwide (The Numbers, “All Time Worldwide Box Office for A24 Movies”). Hereditary both made more money than The Witch and would have been fresher in many people’s minds. Secondly, Midsommar was more easily advertised as a traditional mainstream film than The Lighthouse (see fig. 1 and fig. 2 below). Midsommar was shot in color on a near-standard 2:1 aspect ratio with a Panavision Millennium DXL2 digital cinema camera using modern lenses (IMDb, “Midsommar”). The Lighthouse, on the other hand, was shot on black and white 35mm filmstock with a modified Panavision Panaflex Millennium XL2 camera using vintage lenses from the 1930s-40s with custom filters to emulate the look of film from the time period the film takes place in, the 1890s, with an aspect ratio of 1.19:1, which was most commonly used in the early sound era at Fox (Blaschke; IMDb, “The Lighthouse”; Kenigsberg). From a purely aesthetic perspective, Midsommar looks much more like a mainstream movie than The Lighthouse. Based on each films’ financial data, it seems A24 understood this, along with Aster’s higher marketability, and decided that it would not take the risk of giving The Lighthouse as wide of a release as Midsommar.\n\nA24 does not curate its image only through its choices in theatrical release. According to Ryan David Briggs, in his “A Singular Fusion of Taste and Edge”: A24 and the Indie Sector in the 2010s, A24’s Public Access series “represented the first attempt by A24 to shape perceptions of its own canon. By choosing Lady Bird, The Bling Ring, The Witch, Good Time, The Spectacular Now, and Moonlight to screen in the series, the company strategically chose six films to represent its history and its house style” (127). In this way, A24 was able to control what films are associated with the studio. However, A24 only produced one of the six films presented in its Public Access series: Moonlight. The other five were only distributed by it, thus, the executives at A24 would have had no say in their content or style. But, because A24 holds American distribution rights for all these films, it is able to absorb them into its “house style” while quietly brushing aside its critical, commercial, or popular failures (for instance, A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III or Barely Lethal, both of which were critical, commercial, and popular failures) (Jones). Even if we are to take the company’s self-selected canon at face value, its own promotional material for its films contradicts its claims to be the company of quality by attributing creative vision and prowess to the auteurs themselves, as mentioned before. In addition to this, if the “house style” is real then A24 must contend with the fact that they cannot promote their auteurs’ individual styles and skills because they defy the very definition of a “house style.” A24 cannot be to film as Bauhaus was to architecture. Further, in its promotion of the Public Access series, A24 attempted to emulate the “sudden and semi-secretive merchandise and apparel drops that have become commonplace throughout the 2010s” and associated with the Supreme fashion brand and hypebeast culture; Supreme and A24 have used these strategies to generate enthusiasm for new merchandise along with the maintenance of low supplies to further fuel demand (Briggs 128). By carefully and consciously curating a company canon and adopting the tactics of a lifestyle and fashion brand known for its manufacturing of demand, A24 has, in effect, built a brand on exclusivity and an idea of prestige cinema. As further evidence of A24’s cultivation of a brand analogous to a lifestyle brand, A24’s merchandise, both for its films and the company itself, can be found resold on Grailed, the luxury streetwear reselling site, for hundreds of dollars. According to a former brand director at Grailed, Lawrence Schlossman, “It all came together and now A24 has a streetwear brand” (Freeman). According to one Reddit user on the subreddit r/A24, they once spent $170 on a Midsommar t-shirt and are “ready to spend 700 bucks on merch” (DrawingCurious4161). A24 deftly grew the cultural capital attached to being a fan of theirs by propagating its brand as the company that releases good movies and partnering with streetwear brands like Online Ceramics to cement an image of exclusivity. If you’re a big enough fan, A24 even has a subscription service called A24 All Access, AAA24 for short. For $5 a month, or $55 a year for an annual subscription, the subscriber receives the company’s in-house magazine, a birthday gift of their choosing, exclusive merchandise for “members only,” an AAA24 membership card and pin, early access to new merchandise, monthly discounts on merchandise, “VIP treatment,” and being added to A24’s Close Friends list on Instagram. (A24, “A24 All Access”). The idea of a subscription service to a production and distribution company would likely seem absurd for almost any company aside from A24. But, its cultivation of a brand built on an aesthetic of quality, exclusivity, and edgy cool has made an A24 brand subscription service completely normal.\n\nA24, through marketing and fine curation of its cinematic canon and public image, has cultivated a brand identity as the company that releases good movies: “A24 movies.” However, this self-selected image of the company only works to obscure its critically and commercially mixed bag of releases and its position as a profit-seeking firm, like any other. But, this mystification of the company’s nature has allowed for a cinephilic fandom to form around it, treating the company itself as if it is the “auteur” that carries its own cinematic style and methods into each film.\n\nA24 as Cultural Hegemon\n\nOne of A24’s primary audiences is so-called cinephiles. It has become a key tenet of the company’s brand identity that it is the cinephile studio. Their merchandising says as much with such products as a 99 Movie Crosswords book with difficulty levels from neophyte to expert and topics ranging from “Stoner Movies” to “Soviet Cinema” and the David Lynch TV show Twin Peaks; screenplay books; and “vintage” merchandise, which mostly amounts to movie-related merchandise from before A24’s existence ranging from Independence Day t-shirts, a Paramount Pictures tote bag, to a Giorgio Armani scarf with Martin Scorsese’s face on it. Cinephilia makes up a significant portion of A24’s public image and brand identity, so much so that journalists and publications refer to cinephilia in passing when discussing A24 as if the two are culturally synonymous.\n\nBecause of A24’s impact on the film industry, it becomes necessary to analyze the implications of its business model and cultural influence. We have already established that A24 is a primarily profit-driven firm, like all companies that exist under capitalism. To maximize profit, the company has, through advertising and marketing, established itself as a creator of quality artistic content. In its curation of a house canon and style, it has given itself the role of the auteur, an iconoclastic artist-figure of cinema. But, as A24 takes over the role of the artist in the creation of good cinema, it is also simultaneously commodifying the very idea of good cinema. As films with the A24 logo emblazoned on them become “A24 films,” the labor value imbued in them is mystified and homogenized and loses the distinct personality of the individual workers whose labor was necessary for the final product, becoming instead interchangeable and equal to every other that is designated as an “A24 film.” As Marx describes:\n\nThe mystical character of the commodity does not arise from its use-value. […] Clearly, it arises from the form itself. The equality of the kinds of human labor takes on a physical form in the equal objectivity of the products of labor as values […] the relationships between the producers, within which the social characteristics of their labor are manifested, take on the form of a social relation between the products of labor (Capital: A Critique of Political Economy 164)\n\nHere, however, some may point to a problem. Individual films, no matter what company they come from, are still judged on their individual and overall qualities and personal taste and enjoyment. These make up the films’ use-values. However, our interpretations of use-values, in this case, the quality and our enjoyment of a film, are influenced by the exchange value of the film. When one homogenizes all films produced or distributed by A24 as “A24 films,” then all that are dubbed “A24 films” become exchangeable for each other, their individual quality and variations sublated to the category of the “A24 film.” So, when someone says they “enjoy A24 films,” they are making a blanket statement about the quality of films put out by A24 while obscuring the fact that there is a great variety in quality, content, and style in the films released by the company; in other words, a great variety in use-value. However, this assumption of the A24 “house style” and quality changes the way in which one views films outside of A24’s filmography. This is why, for instance, many felt the need to point out that A24 did not release the popular and acclaimed 2022 Zach Cregger-directed film Barbarian as many believed it to fit with A24’s non-existent “house style,” the category of the “A24 film” (Schimkowitz). As one writer put it, “A24 straight-up ignored their overture” (Lee). Even the New York Times has been evangelizing for A24: in Nicole Sperling’s article on the 2023 Academy Awards, she writes, “Their commitment to original work has become their calling card. Seeing A24’s name attached to a film has begun to connote a certain standard of quality to a segment of the moviegoing audience and to the film industry” (Sperling). The idea of the quality “A24 film” has permeated throughout American culture and society. As the example of Barbarian shows us, the idea of the A24 “house style” is changing how many view cinema. Instead of recognizing the individual styles and talents of Ari Aster, Robert Eggers, Alex Garland, and Zach Cregger, they are all sublimated from the tangible variations in individual and collective labors and tastes to the mystical vapor of one company’s supposed “house style.”\n\nA24’s impact on American moviegoing and cinephilic culture has been demonstrated well enough. The consequences, however, have not been fully elaborated. The Italian philosopher, Antonio Gramsci, writes, “Every social class, coming into existence on the original basis of an essential function in the world of economic production, creates with itself, organically, one or more groups of intellectuals who give it homogeneity and consciousness of its function not only in the economic field but in the social and political field.” One of the groups of intellectuals that he describes, that arises out of the capitalist class, is that of the “organiser of new culture” (The Modern Prince and Other Writings 118). As A24 has fostered a new way of understanding and assigning film quality and style (studio style over individual style), we can say that they are, in fact, Gramsci’s “organisers of new culture.” As stated before, the “organiser of new culture” is an intellectual organically formed as a defense of the capitalist class and system. Therefore, the “new culture” is a defense of the capitalist class. Gramsci calls the culture in defense of a particular class hegemony, the forging of “class alliances” through “consent” (Gramsci, The Modern Prince and Other Writings 30–31). This “consent” is developed and deployed through “civil society,” of which culture is the critical component (Gramsci, Prison Notebooks: Volume III 108–109). The new culture that A24 is implicit in creating is one of commodification of artistic creation so that an acclaimed film like Midsommar becomes just another luxury product of a luxury movie brand.\n\nThe new culture of cinema that A24 has cultivated affects moviegoers as well. Modern cinephilia has become more vulgar and unsophisticated because of A24’s influence. This vulgar cinephilia, becoming increasingly prevalent now, seems more about championing a commodity rather than judging individual products by personal enjoyment or the skills of those making films. As an intellectual interest, cinephilia is changing; as it becomes more about commodities than individual products of labor, vulgar cinephilia reproduces the necessary conditions for cinema’s further entrenchment into the global capitalist market. With this, editorial control is placed further into the hands of corporations and their executives than artists seeking to make art for art’s sake or the sake of the public."
