        "text": "by Manher Kaur\n\nWhat are A24 Films?\n\nIdeally, something you have never seen before.\n\nPerhaps one of A24’s goals as a studio is to pick some of the most popular faces in Hollywood and place them in roles that one could never have expected of them.\n\nSometimes it’s the cast of Harry Potter, where Daniel Radcliffe plays a half-alive corpse in The Daniels’ Swiss Army Man, or Emma Watson is being imprisoned for robbing celebrities in The Bling Ring. Who would have thought to see Hermione Granger, the best student at Hogwarts, turn up like that?\n\nBut it’s not always big-name actors; as an independent film studio, they have also cast new actors like Anya-Taylor Joy in The Witch, or Saoirse Ronan in Lady Bird. A24 tends to bet on up-and-coming directors like Greta Gerwig or Robert Eggers, mostly resulting in films that share thematic and stylistic elements.\n\nMost importantly, The Daniels, whose latest film, Everything Everywhere All at Once, bagged them seven Oscars. However, few people know about their first film, Swiss Army Man, which was a multi-purpose disaster, to say the least. This clearly indicated how the studio played an important part in nurturing the Daniels to improve their craft.\n\nHow has A24 managed to thrive?\n\nWhen A24 was founded in New York in 2012, it was solely a film distributor, releasing what became ‘cult’ cinematic hits such as Harmony Korine’s Spring Breakers (2012) and Lenny Abrahamson’s Room (2015).\n\nThey entered the market when hundreds of films were being made in Hollywood, but all felt like a variant of each other. Their emergence coincided with a period when people were craving fresh and innovative content in films. Their curation of films like The Witch (2015) and Ex Machina (2015), over the first half of their existence, garnered them a reputation for quality. But unlike established giants like Paramount or Universal, which have been around for a century, A24 showed remarkable growth in only a decade.\n\nLooking at A24’s filmography, each film is unique in its own way, while exhibiting the recognizable A24 stamp. The thought behind it is to not make it look like a typical commercialized film, but more like visual poetry, imbued with meaning and metaphor at every turn. This is the reason why you can tell which film is an A24 film, but no two A24 films look alike.\n\nSomething like Past Lives tends to have a more visual approach and a more restrained color palette, to echo the broader themes of the film. In contrast to Everything Everywhere All at Once, where we saw an experimental use of camera work and surreal visual style, embracing the film’s exploration of multiple dimensions.\n\nThe two films are examples of how A24 films are not only for a niche audience or people with a certain taste for cinema. A lot of their films have been crowd favorites.\n\nA24 even expanded its production of arthouse horror films. Their impressive horror film collection — i.e. Hereditary, Midsommar, Talk to Me, The Lighthouse — follows an approach to exploring complex themes with nuanced storytelling to better connect with its audiences. Midsommar, by Ari Aster, set against the backdrop of a Swedish village during a midsummer festival, effectively conveys a feeling of isolation, making you feel like you too have lived it.\n\nEven Hereditary, for that matter, was one of the hallmarks of “elevated horror” when it came out. At its core, it’s about the grief that a family faces, and the inevitable harm that families can’t help but inflict on themselves. Its powerful message defined the entire studio at the time.\n\nEven more powerful was the brand loyalty the studio had developed from its fanbase, leading to people wearing A24-branded T-shirts and caps. By staying true to its core values of providing authenticity in its content, A24 has built meaningful relationships with its audiences and metamorphosed into a cultural phenomenon."
