        "text": "Introduction:\n\nThe propeller is the means by which an engine transmits horsepower to thrust\n\nFor basic aircraft, a fixed-pitch propeller is fixed to reciprocating engines to produce the desired thrust performance\n\nFor complex aircraft, constant-speed propellers are used, and are in fact their own system\n\nPropeller:\n\nAn aircraft's propeller is a rotating airfoil, held in place by a hub, mounted such that it produces lift in the forward direction relative to the aircraft\n\nIt is just like a wing, facing forward which provides the necessary thrust to \"propel\" the aircraft through the air\n\nAs such, it is subject to the aerodynamic principles that apply to any airfoil\n\nPropellers have two or more blades, depending on desired performance\n\nWhen comparing two similar airframes, upgrading to more propellers (i.e., three to two), generally increases terrain clearance as each blade is usually smaller - beneficial for unimproved surface landings\n\nNormally constructed of fiberglass or aluminum\n\nPropellers are nearly always attached to the powerplant's crank shaft, which then rotates the propeller\n\nPropellers are designed to pull, push, or push-pull:\n\nPull-type: (tractor configuration) (Piper Cherokee)\n\nPush-type: (Rutan Model 61 Long-EZ)\n\nPush-pull type: (Cessna Skymaster)\n\nThe amount of thrust produced depends on:\n\nThe shape of the airfoil\n\nThe Angle of Attack (AoA) of the propeller blade\n\nThe Revolutions Per Minute (RPM) of the engine\n\nPropeller blades are typically painted with stripes so they can be easily seen while spinning\n\nTo reduce power for climb or cruise, manifold pressure is reduced to the desired value with the throttle, and the engine r.p.m. is reduced by moving the propeller control back toward the high pitch/low r.p.m. position until the desired r.p.m. is observed on the tachometer\n\nPulling back on the propeller control causes the propeller blades to move to a higher angle\n\nIncreasing the propeller blade angle (of attack) results in an increase in the resistance of the air putting a load on the engine so it slows down\n\nIn other words, the resistance of the air at the higher blade angle is greater than the torque, or power, delivered to the propeller by the engine, so it slows down to a point where the two forces are in balance\n\nWhen an airplane is nosed up into a climb from level flight, the engine will tend to slow down\n\nSince the governor is sensitive to small changes in engine r.p.m., it will decrease the blade angle just enough to keep the engine speed from falling off\n\nIf the airplane is nosed down into a dive, the governor will increase the blade angle enough to prevent the engine from over-speeding\n\nThis allows the engine to maintain a constant r.p.m., and thus maintain the power output\n\nChanges in airspeed and power can be obtained by changing r.p.m. at a constant manifold pressure; by changing the manifold pressure at a constant r.p.m.; or by changing both r.p.m. and manifold pressure\n\nThus the constant-speed propeller makes it possible to obtain an infinite number of power settings\n\nRotation Mechanics:\n\nAs the blade rotates, there are differences in the actual speed of the various portions of the blade [Figure 1]\n\nThe tip of the blade travels faster than the part near the hub because it travels a greater distance than the hub in the same length of time\n\nTherefore, the propeller itself is aerodynamically twisted so blade angle changes from hub to tip\n\nPropeller Angle of Incidence:\n\nChanging the angle of incidence (pitch) from the hub to the tip to correspond with the speed produces uniform lift throughout the length of the blade [Figure 1]\n\nThe greatest angle of incidence (highest pitch), is at the hub while the smallest angle of incidence (smallest pitch) is at the tip\n\nA propeller blade designed with the same angle of incidence throughout its entire length would be inefficient because as airspeed increases in flight, the portion near the hub would have a negative angle of attack while the blade tip would be stalled\n\nForces Acting on the Propeller:\n\nCentrifugal Force: the outward force experienced when the propeller spins\n\nThrust Bending Force: the forward force experienced by the propeller, causing the propeller to bend forward\n\nTorque Bending Force: the force experienced by the propeller due to rotation, causing the blades to bend opposite direction of rotation\n\nAerodynamic Twisting Moment: twisting moment which attempts to increase blade angle from the center of pressure\n\nCentrifugal Twisting Moment: twisting moment which attempts to decrease the blade angle\n\nVibration: harmonics aerodynamic forces\n\nAircraft are equipped with different types of propellers:\n\nFixed pitch\n\nAdjustable pitch\n\nConstant-Speed\n\nFixed-Pitch Propeller:\n\nA fixed-pitch propeller design with fixed blade angles set by the manufacturer, which cannot be changed\n\nAdvantages:\n\nLow weight\n\nSimplicity\n\nLow cost are needed\n\nThere are two types of fixed-pitch propellers:\n\nClimb:\n\nHas a lower pitch, therefore less drag\n\nLess drag results in higher RPM and more horsepower capability, which increases performance during takeoffs and climbs, but decreases performance during cruising flight\n\nCruise:\n\nThe cruise propeller has a higher pitch, therefore more drag\n\nMore drag results in lower RPM and less horsepower capability, which decreases performance during takeoffs and climbs, but increases efficiency during cruising flight\n\nSince a fixed-pitch propeller achieves the best efficiency only at a given combination of airspeed and RPM, the pitch setting is ideal for neither cruise nor climb and must compromise between the two\n\nThe propeller is usually mounted on a shaft, which may be an extension of the engine crankshaft\n\nIn this case, the RPM of the propeller would be the same as the crankshaft RPM\n\nOn some engines, the propeller is mounted on a shaft geared to the engine crankshaft\n\nIn this type, the RPM of the propeller is different than that of the engine\n\nAdjustable (controllable)-Pitch Propeller:\n\nThe adjustable-pitch propeller was the forerunner of the constant-speed propeller\n\nIt is a propeller with blades whose pitch can be adjusted on the ground with the engine not running, but which cannot be adjusted in flight\n\nIt is also referred to as a ground adjustable propeller\n\nThe first adjustable-pitch propeller systems provided only two pitch settings: low and high\n\nToday, most adjustable-pitch propeller systems are capable of a range of pitch settings\n\nConstant-Speed Propeller:\n\nA constant-speed propeller is a controllable-pitch propeller whose pitch is automatically varied in flight by a governor maintaining constant RPM despite varying air loads\n\nThe most common type of adjustable-pitch propeller\n\nAlso referred to as a variable-pitch or controllable-pitch propeller\n\nUsing oil and nitrogen pressure, the governer controls the pitch angle of the propeller to maintain the desired RPM\n\nAdvantages\n\nIt converts a high percentage of brake horsepower (BHP) into thrust horsepower (THP) over a wide range of RPM and airspeed combinations\n\nMore efficient than other propellers because it allows selection of the most efficient engine RPM for the given conditions\n\nConstant-speed propeller controls:\n\nThrottle Lever:\n\nThe throttle enables the pilot to control engine power output (registered on the manifold pressure gauge)\n\nAdvancing the throttle results in the engine spinning faster\n\nRetarding the throttle results in the engine spinning slower\n\nThe engine crankshaft is attached to and therefore spins the propeller\n\nA governor must then act as the transmission, adjusting the propeller's pitch to maintain engine RPM\n\nIf the engine spins faster, the governor increases propeller pitch\n\nIf the engine spins slower, the governor decreases propeller pitch\n\nFor example, after setting the desired RPM during cruising flight, an increase in airspeed or decrease in propeller load will cause the propeller blade angle to increase as necessary to maintain the selected RPM\n\nPropeller Lever:\n\nPropeller lever provides manual control propeller pitch (registered on the tachometer)\n\nAdvancing the propeller lever results in a lower propeller pitch\n\nRetarding the propeller lever results in a higher propeller pitch\n\nThis change in pitch adjust the desired engine RPM\n\nIf the propeller pitch decreases, the engine RPM increases\n\nIf the propeller pitch increases, the engine RPM decreases\n\nOnce set, the governor automatically adjusts the propeller blade angle as necessary to maintain the selected RPM\n\nThis registers as pressure on the manifold\n\nThe gauge measures the absolute pressure of the fuel/air mixture inside the intake manifold and is more correctly a measure of Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP)\n\nAoA Changes Based On:\n\nBlade Angle\n\nBlade Speed\n\nVelocity of Air\n\nPropeller Governor:\n\nA governor is a mechanical device within a constant-speed propeller that maintains propeller speed\n\nIt does so by sensing the speed of a propeller and through mechanical feedback, adjusting pitch\n\nConstantly works to balance optimum RPM vs. manifold pressure\n\nThe pilot controls the engine r.p.m. indirectly by means of a propeller control in the cockpit, which is connected to the governor\n\nAs conditions change, the governor moves a piston to maintain engine RPM [Figure 4]\n\nWhen a governor is employed, engine oil is used and the oil pressure is usually boosted by a pump, which is integrated with the governor\n\nGenerally, the oil pressure used for pitch change comes directly from the engine lubricating system\n\nCounterweights:\n\nIncreases blade angle\n\nOvercome aerodynamic twisting force (low-pitch)\n\nCompressed N2 charge:\n\nIncreases blade angle\n\nPropeller Governor Operation:\n\nWhen an engine is running at constant speed, the torque (power) exerted by the engine at the propeller shaft must equal the opposing load provided by the resistance of the air\n\nThe r.p.m. is controlled by regulating the torque absorbed by the propeller-in other words by increasing or decreasing the resistance offered by the air to the propeller\n\nIn the case of a fixed-pitch propeller, the torque absorbed by the propeller is a function of speed, or r.p.m.\n\nIf the power output of the engine is changed, the engine will accelerate or decelerate until an r.p.m. is reached at which the power delivered is equal to the power absorbed\n\nIn the case of a constant-speed propeller, the power absorbed is independent of the r.p.m., for by varying the pitch of the blades, the air resistance and hence the torque or load, can be changed without reference to propeller speed\n\nThis is accomplished with a constant-speed propeller by means of a governor\n\nThe governor, in most cases, is geared to the engine crankshaft and thus is sensitive to changes in engine r.p.m.\n\nPropeller Governor Operation:\n\nAs long as the propeller blade angle is within the constant-speed range and not against either pitch stop, a constant engine RPM will be maintained\n\nIf the propeller blades contact a pitch stop, the engine RPM will increase or decrease as appropriate with changes in airspeed and propeller load, as there is no more room to travel\n\nFor example, once a specific RPM has been selected, if aircraft speed decreases enough to rotate the propeller blades until they contact the low pitch stop, any further decrease in airspeed will cause engine RPM to decrease the same way as if a fixed-pitch propeller were installed\n\nRPM changes according to the speed and AoA of the airplane; varying directly\n\nGovernor Mechanics: Propeller Lever Movement:\n\nPropeller Lever Retarded:\n\nFlyweights move out\n\nSpeeder spring tension decreases\n\nPilot valve moves upward\n\nOil flows out of the propeller hub\n\nPropeller pitch increases\n\nPropeller Lever Advanced:\n\nFlyweights move in\n\nSpeeder spring tension increases\n\nPilot valve moves downward\n\nOil flows into the propeller hub\n\nPropeller pitch decreases\n\nAirspeeds:\n\nIncrease in airspeed (pitch down):\n\nThe propeller will speed up\n\nThe flyweights will fly outward\n\nThe pilot valve moves upward\n\nOil flows into the propeller hub\n\nThe propeller pitch increases\n\nDecrease in airspeed (pitch up):\n\nThe propeller will slow down\n\nThe flyweights will fly inward\n\nThe pilot valve moves down\n\nOil flows out of the propeller hub\n\nThe propeller pitch decreases\n\nPropeller System Checks:\n\nThe engine is started with the propeller control in the low pitch/high r.p.m. position to reduce the load or drag of the propeller and the result is easier starting and warm-up of the engine\n\nDuring warm-up, the propeller blade changing mechanism should be operated slowly and smoothly through a full cycle to determine whether the system is operating correctly, and to circulate fresh warm oil through the propeller governor system\n\nThis is done by moving the propeller control to the high pitch/low r.p.m. position (full forward), allowing the r.p.m. to stabilize, and then moving the propeller control back to the low pitch takeoff position\n\nCycling warm oil through the propeller cylinder circulates residual oil that could impede system operation if cold or congealed\n\nConsequently, if the propeller isn't exercised before takeoff, there is a possibility that the engine may over-speed on takeoff\n\nPilots generally look for an RPM drop, an oil pressure change, and a manifold pressure increase, although the POH is the guiding document on when to cycle, how often to cycle, and what to look for\n\nConstant Speed Propeller Operation:\n\nAn airplane equipped with a constant-speed propeller has better takeoff performance than a similarly powered airplane equipped with a fixed-pitch propeller\n\nThis is because with a constant-speed propeller, an airplane can develop its maximum rated horsepower (red line on the tachometer) while motionless\n\nAn airplane with a fixed-pitch propeller, on the other hand, must accelerate down the runway to increase airspeed and aerodynamically unload the propeller so that r.p.m. and horsepower can steadily build up to their maximum\n\nWith a constant-speed propeller, the tachometer reading should come up to within 40 r.p.m. of the red line as soon as full power is applied, and should remain there for the entire takeoff\n\nExcessive manifold pressure raises the cylinder compression pressure and temperatures, resulting in high stresses within the engine\n\nA combination of high manifold pressure and low r.p.m. can induce damaging detonation\n\nTo avoid these situations, the following sequence should be followed when making power changes\n\nWhen increasing power, increase the r.p.m. first, and then the manifold pressure\n\nWhen decreasing power, decrease the manifold pressure first, and then decrease the r.p.m.\n\nIt is a fallacy that (in non-turbocharged engines) the manifold pressure in inches of mercury (inches Hg) should never exceed r.p.m. in hundreds for cruise power settings\n\nWhatever the combinations of r.p.m. and manifold pressure listed in the POH/AFM charts-they have been flight tested and approved by the airframe and powerplant engineers for the respective airframe and engine manufacturer\n\nWith a constant-speed propeller, a power descent can be made without over-speeding the engine\n\nThe system compensates for the increased airspeed of the descent by increasing the propeller blade angles\n\nIf the descent is too rapid, or is being made from a high altitude, the maximum blade angle limit of the blades is not sufficient to hold the r.p.m. constant\n\nWhen this occurs, the r.p.m. is responsive to any change in throttle setting\n\nSome pilots consider it advisable to set the propeller control for maximum r.p.m. during the approach to have full horsepower available in case of emergency\n\nIf the governor is set for this higher r.p.m. early in the approach when the blades have not yet reached their minimum angle stops, the r.p.m. may increase to unsafe limits\n\nHowever, if the propeller control is not readjusted for the takeoff r.p.m. until the approach is almost completed, the blades will be against, or very near their minimum angle stops and there will be little if any change in r.p.m.\n\nIn case of emergency, both throttle and propeller controls should be moved to takeoff positions\n\nMany pilots prefer to feel the airplane respond immediately when they give short bursts of the throttle during approach\n\nBy making the approach under a little power and having the propeller control set at or near cruising r.p.m., this result can be obtained\n\nIf an emergency demanding full power should arise during approach, the sudden advancing of the throttle will cause momentary over-speeding of the engine beyond the r.p.m. for which the governor is adjusted\n\nThis temporary increase in engine speed acts as an emergency power reserve\n\nSome important points to remember concerning constant-speed propeller operation are:\n\nAll power changes should be made smoothly and slowly to avoid over-boosting and/or over-speeding\n\nA momentary propeller over-speed may occur when the throttle is advanced rapidly for takeoff\n\nThis is usually not serious if the rated r.p.m. is not exceeded by 10% for more than 3 seconds\n\nBlade Angle Control:\n\nThe higher pressure provides a quicker blade angle change\n\nThe r.p.m. at which the propeller is to operate is adjusted in the governor head\n\nThe pilot changes this setting by changing the position of the governor rack through the cockpit propeller control\n\nOn some constant-speed propellers, changes in pitch are obtained by the use of an inherent centrifugal twisting moment of the blades that tends to flatten the blades toward low pitch, and oil pressure applied to a hydraulic piston connected to the propeller blades which moves them toward high pitch\n\nAnother type of constant-speed propeller uses counterweights attached to the blade shanks in the hub\n\nGovernor oil pressure and the blade twisting moment move the blades toward the low pitch position, and centrifugal force acting on the counterweights moves them (and the blades) toward the high pitch position\n\nIn the first case above, governor oil pressure moves the blades toward high pitch, and in the second case, governor oil pressure and the blade twisting moment move the blades toward low pitch\n\nA loss of governor oil pressure, therefore, will affect each differently\n\nGoverning Range:\n\nThe range of possible blade angles is termed the propeller's governing range\n\nThe governing range is defined by the limits of the propeller blade's travel between high and low blade angle pitch stops\n\nThe blade angle range for constant-speed propellers varies from about 11.5 to 40°\n\nThe higher the speed of the airplane, the greater the blade angle range [Figure 2]\n\nAs long as the propeller blade angle is within the governing range and not against either pitch stop, a constant engine r.p.m. will be maintained\n\nHowever, once the propeller blade reaches its pitch-stop limit, the engine r.p.m. will increase or decrease with changes in airspeed and propeller load similar to a fixed-pitch propeller\n\nIf it reduces pitch to low pitch stops, then any further reduction in airspeed will cause the engine r.p.m. to decrease\n\nConversely, if the airspeed increases, the propeller blade angle will increase until the high pitch stop is reached then the engine r.p.m. will then begin to increase\n\nPropeller Instrumentation:\n\nTachometer:\n\nIn a fixed-pitch propeller, the tachometer is the indicator of engine power [Figure 2]\n\nCalibrated in hundreds of RPM giving a direct indication of the engine and propeller RPM\n\nThe RPM is regulated by the throttle, which controls the fuel/air flow to the engine\n\nAt a given altitude, the higher the tachometer reading, the higher the power output of the engine\n\nAs altitude changes, the position of the throttle must be changed to maintain the same RPM due to lower engine output caused by a change in air density (higher/lower density altitude)\n\nAs altitude is increased, the throttle must be opened further to indicate the same RPM as at a lower altitude\n\nAs altitude is decreased, the throttle must be closed further to indicate the same RPM as at a higher altitude\n\nThe red line on the tachometer not only indicates maximum allowable r.p.m.; it also indicates the r.p.m. required to obtain the engine's rated horsepower\n\nThe green arc on the tachometer indicates the normal operating range\n\nWhen developing power in this range, the engine drives the propeller\n\nBelow the green arc, however, it is usually the windmilling propeller that powers the engine\n\nProlonged operation below the green arc can be detrimental to the engine\n\nManifold Pressure Gauge:\n\nOn aircraft equipped with a constant-speed propeller, power output is controlled by the throttle and indicated by a manifold pressure gauge [Figure 3]\n\nAt a constant RPM and altitude, the amount of power produced is directly related to the fuel/air flow being delivered to the combustion chamber\n\nAs the throttle setting is increased, more fuel and air flows to the engine and MAP increases\n\nWhen the engine is not running, the manifold pressure gauge indicates ambient air pressure (i.e., 29.92 inches mercury (29.92 \"Hg))\n\nWhen the engine is started, the manifold pressure indication will decrease to a value less than ambient pressure (i.e., idle at 12 \"Hg)\n\nThe face of the manifold pressure gauge contains a green arc to show the normal operating range, and a red radial line to indicate the upper limit of manifold pressure\n\nIf manifold pressure is exceeded too frequently, this stress can weaken the cylinder components and eventually cause engine failure\n\nAs a general rule, manifold pressure (inches) should be less than the RPM\n\nA pilot can avoid conditions that over-stress the cylinders by being constantly aware of the RPM, especially when increasing the manifold pressure\n\nWhen both manifold pressure and RPM need to be changed, avoid engine over-stress by making power adjustments in the proper order:\n\nWhen power settings are being decreased, reduce manifold pressure before reducing RPM\n\nIf RPM is reduced before manifold pressure, manifold pressure will automatically increase, possibly exceeding the manufacturer's tolerances\n\nWhen power settings are being increased, reverse the order-increase RPM first, then manifold pressure\n\nTo prevent damage to radial engines, minimize operating time at maximum RPM and manifold pressure, and avoid operation at maximum RPM and low manifold pressure. The engine and/or airframe manufacturer's recommendations should be followed to prevent severe wear, fatigue, and damage to high-performance reciprocating engines\n\nEngine failure or power loss is indicated on the manifold gauge as an increase in manifold pressure to a value corresponding to the ambient air pressure at the altitude where the failure occurred\n\nOn takeoffs from low elevation airports, the manifold pressure in inches of mercury may exceed the r.p.m. This is normal in most cases. The pilot should consult the AFM/POH for limitations\n\nPropeller Feathering:\n\nConstant-speed propellers can be feathered, meaning the chord line of each blade is rotated so that it nearly parallels the relative wind over the aircraft [Figure 5]\n\nThis is accomplished different ways for different aircraft but the bottom line is pressure holding the propeller in its position is removed and mechanical spring pressure is allowed to feather the propeller\n\nThis action is normally initiated with the (blue) propeller lever\n\nThis decrease in the blade's frontal area exposed will cause parasite drag to decrease\n\nThe propeller rotation slows, then stops windmilling\n\nPropellers are not feathered in flight under normal operations, but instead are a mitigation for when engines must be shut down, improving glide performance and directional control (multi-engine aircraft)\n\nTakeoff, Climb, and Cruise:\n\nFor maximum takeoff power, the propeller control is moved all the way forward to the low pitch/high r.p.m. position, and the throttle is moved forward to the maximum allowable manifold pressure position\n\nDuring takeoff, when the forward motion of the airplane is at low speeds and when maximum power and thrust are required, the constant-speed propeller sets up a low propeller blade angle (pitch)\n\nThe low blade angle keeps the angle of attack, with respect to the relative wind, small and efficient at the low speed [Figure 2]\n\nAt the same time, it allows the propeller to \"slice it thin\" and handle a smaller mass of air per revolution\n\nThis light load allows the engine to turn at maximum r.p.m. and develop maximum power\n\nAlthough the mass of air per revolution is small, the number of revolutions per minute is high\n\nThrust is maximum at the beginning of the takeoff and then decreases as the airplane gains speed and the airplane drag increases\n\nDue to the high slipstream velocity during takeoff, the effective lift of the wing behind the propeller(s) is increased\n\nAs the airspeed increases after lift-off, the load on the engine is lightened because of the small blade angle\n\nThe governor senses this and increases the blade angle slightly\n\nAgain, the higher blade angle, with the higher speeds, keeps the angle of attack with respect to the relative wind small and efficient\n\nFor climb after takeoff, the power output of the engine is reduced to climb power by decreasing the manifold pressure and lowering r.p.m. by increasing the blade angle\n\nAt the higher (climb) airspeed and the higher blade angle, the propeller is handling a greater mass of air per second at a lower slipstream velocity\n\nThis reduction in power is offset by the increase in propeller efficiency\n\nThe angle of attack is again kept small by the increase in the blade angle with an increase in airspeed\n\nAt cruising altitude, when the airplane is in level flight, less power is required to produce a higher airspeed than is used in climb\n\nConsequently, engine power is again reduced by lowering the manifold pressure and increasing the blade angle (to decrease r.p.m.)\n\nThe higher airspeed and higher blade angle enable the propeller to handle a still greater mass of air per second at still smaller slipstream velocity\n\nAt normal cruising speeds, propeller efficiency is at, or near maximum efficiency\n\nDue to the increase in blade angle and airspeed, the angle of attack is still small and efficient\n\nInspection & Overhaul:\n\nPropeller inspection is part of every preflight\n\nThe physical propeller should be checked for any nicks and dents with any found referred to a qualified A&P for a determination of airworthiness\n\nFixed-pitch propeller system inspections are relatively straight forward in that its an inspection of the externals\n\nConstant-speed propeller systems are different, in that many of the function is internal and therefore not possible to routinely inspect\n\nChosing when to overhaul a propeller starts first with the owner manual and local/trusted A&P recommendations\n\nTimely discovery of abnormalities are critical to save money and preserve function\n\nPilots can learn more about overhauls and IRANs (Inspect and Repair As Necessary) here\n\nPropeller System Failures:\n\nLoss of oil pressure:\n\nPropeller will default to pitch setting; usually in multi-engine aircraft they may feather automatically\n\nPropeller synchronizing:\n\nMatches RPM of all engines together using a master and a slave\n\nNot all propellers are meant to rotate at the same phase angle. These systems are referred to as synchro-phasers\n\nPrivate Pilot - Operation of Aircraft Systems Airman Certification Standards:\n\nObjective: To determine the applicant exhibits satisfactory knowledge, risk management, and skills associated with safe operation of systems on the airplane provided for the flight test.\n\nReferences: FAA-H-8083-2, FAA-H-8083-3, FAA-H-8083-23, FAA-H-8083-25; POH/AFM\n\nNote: If K1 is selected, the evaluator must assess the applicant's knowledge of at least three sub-elements\n\nPrivate Pilot Operation of Aircraft Systems Lesson Plan\n\nOperation of Aircraft Systems Knowledge:\n\nThe applicant demonstrates understanding of:\n\nPA.I.G.K1:\n\nAirplane systems, including:\n\nPA.I.G.K1a:\n\nPrimary flight controls\n\nPA.I.G.K1a:\n\nSecondary flight controls\n\nPA.I.G.K1c:\n\nPowerplant and propeller\n\nPA.I.G.K1d:\n\nLanding gear\n\nPA.I.G.K1e:\n\nFuel, oil, and hydraulic\n\nPA.I.G.K1f:\n\nElectrical\n\nPA.I.G.K1g:\n\nAvionics\n\nPA.I.G.K1h:\n\nPitot-static, vacuum/pressure, and associated flight instruments\n\nPA.I.G.K1i:\n\nEnvironmental\n\nPA.I.G.K1j:\n\nDeicing and anti-icing\n\nPA.I.G.K1k:\n\nWater Rudders (ASES, AMES)\n\nPA.I.G.K1l:\n\nOxygen Systems\n\nPA.I.G.K2:\n\nIndications of and procedures for managing system abnormalities or failures\n\nOperation of Aircraft Systems Risk Management:\n\nThe applicant is able to identify, assess, and mitigate risk associated with:\n\nPA.I.G.R1:\n\nDetection of system malfunctions or failures\n\nPA.I.G.R2:\n\nManagement of a system failure\n\nPA.I.G.R3:\n\nMonitoring and management of automated systems\n\nOperation of Aircraft Systems Skills:\n\nThe applicant exhibits the skill to:\n\nPA.I.G.S1:\n\nOperate at least three of the systems listed in K1a through K1l appropriately\n\nPA.I.G.S2:\n\nComplete the appropriate checklist(s)\n\nConclusion:\n\nBe sure to treat the propeller with respect, as its movement when (for example) there is a hot mag may result in the engine attempting a started\n\nEven if the engine does not start, the propeller will turn at a high rate of speed, risking injury or death\n\nStill looking for something?
