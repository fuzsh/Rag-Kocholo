        "text": "https://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=23014\n\nThis is a big friggin' deal -- The FAA has issued an emergency revocation of the repair station certificate for Sensenich's Connecticut maintenance facility. From the press release:\n\nThe FAA alleges Sensenich falsified maintenance records and approved for return to service parts that had been improperly serviced.\n\nThe FAA also issued an Emergency Order of Revocation of the repairman certificate of the company’s accountable manager for the same alleged violations.\n\nThe FAA alleges that between March 2015 and at least February 2017, Sensenich and the accountable manager knowingly and intentionally performed maintenance on 47 propellers for 45 separate aircraft that was contrary to instructions in the manufacturer’s overhaul manuals.\n\nThe FAA further alleges that Sensenich and the accountable manager certified that on 47 separate occasions, the work was performed in accordance with the manufacturer’s overhaul manuals and Federal Aviation Regulations, and approved the propellers for return to service. Sensenich officials knew, however, that the propellers were not properly overhauled, the FAA alleges.\n\nThere are a few CTs with Sensenich props, and a LOT of other LSAs, including most RV-12s. It's unclear how this will affect maintenance on those props going forward.\n\nWell, this is clear as mud...Sensenich posted the following on their website:\n\nIMPORTANT NOTICE – FAA REVOCATION ORDER DOES NOT APPLY TO US\n\nYou may know about an August 21, 2018 Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) press release\n\ndescribing the revocation of a Connecticut repair station certificate of a company named\n\nSensenich Propeller Service, Inc.\n\nPlease be informed that Sensenich Propeller Manufacturing Co., Inc., Sensenich Wood Propeller\n\nCo., Inc., and its subsidiary, Sensenich Composites, Inc. (collectively, “Sensenich Propeller\n\nCompany”) are not affiliated and do not share ownership or management with the Repair\n\nStation Company in any way. In September 1995, the Repair Station Company became\n\nindependent from us and was allowed to continue to use the name “Sensenich.” Other than the\n\nsimilar name, there has been no connection between the two business groups since then.\n\nSensenich Propeller Company remains committed to integrity and quality products and services\n\nthat meet or exceed all industry and governmental standards.\n\nSensenich Propeller Company has no connection whatsoever with the August 21, 2018 FAA\n\nrevocation order or the Repair Station Company, and the FAA order does not apply to us in\n\nany way.\n\nNo affiliation, except they used to be part of the same company. No mention whether that company is currently used as the maintenance facility for the Sensenich factory. Now I'm just left with questions.\n\nThink Flint Michigan and it’s water issues. The leaders and their managers told their customers “TRUST US”\n\nLet’s have faith in their nice Lawyers. Were Sesenich serious they would never have allowed even part of their name to be used after spinning off that station.\n\nIts like a backyard mechanic Calling himself Lycomming.\n\nNote,The CEO of Sensenich did not put his name to the NOTICE.\n\nSorry how do I figure, which is the real Sensenich\n\nIf you overhaul only one manufacturer's prop, calling yourselves \"Sensenich Propeller Service\" isn't exactly out of the realm of possibilities.\n\nIt's like being an engine shop and calling yourself Ford Motor Service and servicing only Ford vehicle engines.\n\nIt's may or may not a good idea to allow a company to use your name, but as said, it's not outside of the realm of possibility.\n\nAs for the whole idea of a facility separating: Employees could decide to buy out a facility. Maybe the manufacturer, Sensenich, didn't wan't to keep that facility open anymore, and the employees wanted it to stay open. Since all they do is service Sensenich Propellers, as part of the buyout, they were to be licensed to continue to use the name (lot easier to keep business using the same name, than to change it).\n\nAnyways, the MANUFACTURER, Sensenich, is called the Sensenich Propeller Company. The OVERHAUL facility, is called Sensenich Propeller Service.\n\nStill confusing as hell unfortunately.\n\nIt is about sales value when the Parent sold off the CT plant. I just sold my aero manufacturing business so I received an expensive lesson in aero mergers and acquisitions. Aero shops when sold are not actually \"sold\", rather, the assets that make up the company are sold. Buyers don't want the liability that equity carries with it (in this case... a gajillion propellers spinning out in the world post-repair)... so, the assets of the company are sold such as machinery, an assigned right to lease the building (or the building itself is sold to the Buyer), the office furniture, the prop designs, the processes for repairing the props, the employees are actually technically fired from the Old Company and rehired by the new one... and tah dah... the name of the business and telephone number.\n\nSo, I would bet that the most likely scenario in this case is what I just wrote... the Sens owners probably made a business decision to assign the Sens name to the new CT shop owners because if they hadn't, they wouldn't have made as much money. Think of it... Sensenich has a greater brand value than \"Bob's Prop Shop\"… the risk the Sellers of the CT shop took was that the value move would come back and bite them in the axx… and viola'... it did. They certainly regret it 20 years after the sale... but back then it probably made $$$ sense(nich). Their statement about having nothing to do with the business is technically correct. They have no ownership interest, they don't operate it and the only thing in common is the common name on the sign out front.\n\nTom, that's not the way it works... meaning, you used the term \"entitled\"... \"Sensenich\" is a business brand name, widely known. It is an \"asset\", similar to \"McDonalds\" or \"Walgreens\", once family names morphed into business brands... less about 12 zeros in value...; )… As such, the buyer paid for the privilege of using the name, as the name has value. The buyer has to license (i.e. achieve permission from the Seller) the name in order to use it...and the counterparty (the Seller) has to approve same. Regarding Entitlement, i.e. a family member staying with the business, no Seller would allow the asset (the brand name) to be sold without Value. no Value (money)?, no license to use the name. Courts would uphold that notion as the two businesses (Parent and CT repair shop) would create confusion with the consumer.\n\nIn sum, the Seller sold the prop shop to a 3rd Party and the Buyer was licensed the name."
