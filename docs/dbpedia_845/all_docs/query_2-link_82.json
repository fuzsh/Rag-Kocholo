        "text": "I think that first response is the only correct one available with the (lack of) info given.\n\nYour question is far to broad with no qualifying details to attain a legitimate answer.\n\nVery much the same as showing up on a Hot Rod board musing 'What is better Ford or Chevrolet?\"\n\nIt is also much like showing up on this board and asking \"What is better, air craft or car motor?\"\n\nIntentional or not, realize that as posed, your question looks like trolling with no intent other than to :stirpot: .\n\nNot to imply that is (or is not) your intent, but rather point out that no matter what the question is, there\n\nwill be a minimum of info required to base an answer on, whenever it does in fact seek a legitimate answer.\n\nThe guys who were here and psychic, left to go start the now infamous \"Psychic Hotline\". We miss them both.\n\nWhat motor? AC or CM?\n\nReduction? DD or what ratio?\n\nWhat RPM window? @ WOT, @cruise?\n\nBoat Size/Weight? light vs loaded?\n\nEtc, etc.\n\nAppreciate that a prop recommendation will not be the same for a 4cyl AC and a Supercharged V8 with a CounterRotator Gearbox.\n\nBefore some wise guy says that wasn't the question, I will point out the above question needs to be answered first, then\n\nthe original question may vary well become self evident. If not, at least there will be solid info on which to base an answer.\n\nFor 4 cyl aircraft engine, my recommendation would be Water Walker Cypress Series.\n\nDepending on the power you're making (ie which one) they could range from 66-70 inch diameter.\n\nAccomplished with different length hubs (as is standard practice, regardless the manufacturer).\n\nunforgiven11B said:\n\nI disagree Deano- Sensenich is a far superior product then Water Walker I read the question as Water walker Vs. Sensenich not which one should I use? Comparing apples to apples here Sensenich is a much better built blade Hands down and you can’t deny it. seen a few WW just fly apart and other issues as I’ve ran both products . Does WW make a great pushing blade? Yes but it’s not made with the same quality\n\n......That is your opinion and that is fine, I understand; but my overall assessment differs from yours, that's all.\n\nOver the years, I to have used both, and had problems with each.\n\nThis is over MANY years and MANY blade sets, mind you.\n\nBlades don't last forever, and some will run them longer than they should.\n\nAt this point in time, either will perform as exactly as you would expect they should.\n\nConsequently, to me the specific application would be my first consideration.\n\nIn this particular case, the Cypress Series work best in my opinion and others.\n\nThe fact they are WW blades is somewhat inconsequential where that is concerned.\n\nGiven a different power-plant/gear my first blade choice would be exactly that, with the manufacturer being the secondary concern.\n\nunforgiven11B said:\n\nI disagree Deano- Sensenich is a far superior product then Water Walker I read the question as Water walker Vs.

Everyone has one, and they all stink.\n\nBoth companies make quality product.

Base your buying decision on customer support if you want to live a happy life.\n\nYou do know your leaving a good amount on the table as scraps by not trying a sensenich prop?\n\nI relate to local but local must also compete and WW shows it does not want too by it's own actions!\n\nRiding the 10 year old wave to the beach crashed many years ago to anything new out of WW, other than test barges and useless designs to hulls, not props!\n\nHonestly, it's not cool to put down others products as inferior when you have no basis for that claim, Prototype.\n\nI have tested props from all major manufacturers actually and the one that consistently performs the best is what stays installed.\n\nI doubt many people that aren't making or selling props have done as much thrust testing as I personally have.\n\nSo, take it as you will. But, for sure, there is no performance left on the table with the Water Walker props I have run and tested.\n\nMy use case doesn't involve racing or trying to run extreme speeds. Even then, the 80 inch 3 blade Maximus has pushed my boat up and over any and all terrain, pulled boats on occasion and has seen speeds legitimately above 85mph and still pulling hard and still allowing me to get fuel economy that is excellent by any standard for boats (5mpg combined). Its also put out the same thrust with 3 blades that took 4 with others of similar airfoil width and exactly the same diameter. I have posted links to my spread sheets in the past documenting all of it. I feel I am significantly above average level of \"informed.\"\n\nWhen you start looking at all of these props on a thrust rig, you realise quickly that the differences between them is not so much in the maximum static thrust (though some exists), it's more in the thrust curve as a function of prop speed. Matching that curve to what your engine is happy to produce nets the best results.\n\nI stand behind my advice, customer service is the #1 thing to look for. All manufacturers have the exact same challenges and issues with props in service."
