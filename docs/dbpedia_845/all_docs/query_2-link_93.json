        "text": "Installed my new four blade short hub today caint wait to try it out. It is a bunch stronger than a standard hub.The leverage point is almost four inches closer to the bearing load. It also pulls eight lbs out of the rotating assembly. It basically does away with the mounting hub on the gear box shaft. It mounts the blades much closer to the shaft bearing area making the mount much stronger. Kind of like digging a hole with a standard shovel then sawing off half the handle and digging again. The leverage advantage is helping the gear box end plus the weight you loose is like putting a light weight fly wheel in a car. A total advantage over the old design. I should have the boat up and running in a few days to give you a progress report. I feel this is the type of innovation that makes this industry great. Like most new Ideas the old tried and true bunch will try to degrade or bad mouth any new idea usually because they did not think of it themselves. That same bunch dismissed carbon fiber props now they are the industry standard. Sensenich put a lot of time and expert engineering into this new hub. I have it on good authority Dan the man came up with this idea. This type of creative thinking is what this industry needs. All new technology is made one step at a time. From a carved wooden block for printing the letter A to the high speed word processors we are working on in this medium. It is all one innovative step at a time. My thanks to Dan and Sensenich for making this available despite all the nay sayers. oh yes one other advantage you can set the prop box and engine back almost four inches in the boat that is a big advantage in the racing crowd.\n\nThat looks pretty cool and I can understand the weight transfer gain and the ability to run a longe rengine setup on a smaller hull and all that .. my only question is who is warranteeing the box with the short hub setup .. cause stinger didn't do it right. Is sensenitch giving the warranty ??? Is Dan the airboatman giving the warranty ?? who is responsible if someone gets hurt when the shaft breaks and the prop goes flying from losing it's temper by having the original hub removed and the new one installed ?? is that sensenitch's hub or is it Dan's hub ?? somebody has to be responsible for it right ?? Was the engineering done by sensenitch ?? to ascertain the safety of it or just to make it fit ??? JUST A THOUGHT\n\nNOT NAYSAYIN JUST WANNA KNOW WHO IS RESPONSIBLE ... it can't be stinger because it s done aftermarket right ??\n\nso who is gonna pay for the damages both to equipment and possibly people ??? Liability is ahuge concern these days and with most folks carrying no liability insurance on their boats .. couple that with an experimental product ..but it is claimed by the title of this thread that it belongs to sensenitch they did the engineering and obviously approved it so looks like they own it ... if anything goes wrong .. could get expensive .. ask powershift .. aint that why they changed names of the company ??? that is what the rumor was .. LAWSUITS\n\nstinger has a great reputation for reliable boxes .. so if abox blows up with this hub on it .. does that vid your stinger warranty ??? I think it would because you have altered their product ... Like I say it is something to think about ... Having dabbled in building a boat or two over the years and having several belt drive / gear box designs I have worked on it is a question that comes to my mind ... everybody wants a guarantee these days and lawyers want someone to sue when stuff happens ... That is part of the reason none of my stuff has been sold .. product liabilty insurance is darned expensive ... evey boat I have sold always needed something done to it to make it operational becaus eI didn't carry product liability insurance .. but when they bought it from me it wouldn't hurt you ... it wasn't operational ...\n\nUnless the removal of one hub and installation of another causes the failure, there is no impact on any warranty. This is nonsense about the shaft losing it's temper. There has never been a failure..so why would making the rotating mass less, and the shaft stronger from a dynamic standpoint do anything but improve the stinger product? Stinger should be grateful that SOMEONE is trying to improve their product since Bruce Kaye's death who is competent. God knows no one there now is a competent designer or engineer. Dan Huebner was the best thing that Stinger ever had. And his new improvements should be welcomed by them. I doubt liability insurance has been looked into at all...by them or others.\n\nMaddog\n\nWell maybe .. maybe not Charles ... but I bet you would play hell gettin stinger to warranty one of them since they didn't sell it that way. I don't know about stinger but I know I looked into liability insurance quite deeply. All of the major boat manufacturers carry it. As for the temper yep it sure can lose it .. also shortening a shaft carrying a load that is subject to shock increases the force of the shock to the shaft ... a longer shaft has more flex .. rather than breaking ... but I am not an ungineer either but I once stayed at a holiday inn express ... LOL I just asked a simple question ,, WHO IS STANDING BEHIND THE MODIFIED GEAR BOX ... sensenitch or Dan ... because stinger didn't modify it however sensenitch made the hubs and Dan installs them ... so who guarantee's them ... who would you sue in case of a failure ...\n\nNot me Bonds LOL I know better ... she has forgot more about gearboxes than dan will ever know .. she learned from the MASTER BRUCE himself ... I like Dan .. but facts are facts and that is the facts. Bruce had given all these things a lot of consideration over the years he built the boxes .. all the way back to the k-way days .. and all of us old timers know the story on that one .. or at least what we want to know about it.\n\nI aint pickin on any one I just had a thought about who is responsible for failures and asked a simple question .. who gets sued ???\n\nAnything after market is always the responsibility of the owner. In this age of whining losers who refuse to be responsible for their own actions there is always a chance of being sued. The courts are full of losers trying to make a buck off of anyone working at a trade or profession . I guess we should all sit home a do nothing creative because we are trying to figure out who we can hold responsible for our own stupidity. The warranty of any company is only as good as the company that stands behind it . Stinger rotator ford or chevy could fold up tomorrow who would be responsible for the problem then. Everything in life is a crap shoot. I am on the side of invention . If Bruce k listened to the who is gone to be responsible if the sky is falling chicken little mentality the gear box for the airboat industry would have never been built. Anyone that thinks sensenich is going to put this much money into a unsafe product should move back in the nursery and get busy on a pacifier. Mommy will make it ok for you. You need R Lee Ermie for a shrink and schuffel off to namby pamby land. Who is responsible if you put more motor in your boat than you are capable of driving. Who is responsible if you are to stupid to tie your special new shoe laces and you trip and fall? The list of chicken little goes on forever. This short hub is a safer hub than the existing one. Who is going to be responsible if it saves some one life.\n\nCountry--I don't know the answer to your question. Obviously anyone involved in a modification that fails is subject to liability. But like i said---there has never been a failure...and I doubt there ever will be either. Anything is possible. The 4140 steel used in these shafts has so much carbon that it does not show any loss of temper after the hub is pressed off and on....I for one will try it and sing the truth from the rafters...good or bad. I think it will be shown to be an excellent upgrade.\n\nMaddog"
