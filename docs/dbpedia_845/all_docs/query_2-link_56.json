        "text": "Home Prices TBO\n\nDominion Propeller Corporation has successfully served Alaska's commercial and general aviation industry since 1977. We have consistently accomplished only the finest quality of work. The professional staff at Dominion Propeller Corporation is committed to maintaining these standards at competitive prices.\n\nA failure in the Alaskan bush, involving down time and shipping costs, can be very costly. Our customers benefit from propeller repairs and overhauls that will perform and hold up under harsh Alaskan conditions. Gerald Allsup, the owner, is fond of saying that Dominion Propeller's work will not return unless the operator has worn it out or broken it!"
