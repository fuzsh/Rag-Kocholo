        "text": "Founded in 1932 by two Pennsylvania farm boys, Sensenich has remained an American powerhouse in the propeller industry for almost 90 years. It manufactures fixed-pitch propellers for light aircraft, and metal-fixed-pitch propellers for general aviation.\n\nWe offer competitive pricing, and we have the most popular models new, in stock, and ready for delivery. In addition, we can adjust your fixed pitch propeller at ground level to make it higher or lower pitch. This adjustment can make your aircraft improve either your altitude or your speed.\n\nNeed help selecting the correct prop for your application?\n\nContact us with the make and model of your aircraft, and we will be glad to assist you. We have in stock Cessna aircraft 152 and 172 STC’d propellers. We stock these because they have a better climb and cruise performance over OEM propellers.\n\nFor your convenience, the Sensenich website provides an application guide to determine which propellers can be used on your aircraft.\n\nIs it time to overhaul your propeller?\n\nThere are a variety of reasons your propeller may need to be inspected. These include, but are not limited to:\n\nBird strikes\n\nLanding on a dirt or grass air strip\n\nHeavy rock damage\n\nHail\n\nMoving from sea level to a higher elevation\n\nObvious corrosion on the blades\n\nTime limit determined by the manufacturers’ recommendations in the owner’s manual\n\nWhen you bring in your propeller, we will first perform a visual inspection to make sure your propeller can safely be overhauled. If it can, then we will strip down your propeller and governor using Non Destructive Testing, or NDT. This process will check for cracks, defects, and stress fractures. After this, we will shot-peen the knobs and blades if necessary. Your safety is our first priority, while still being committed to a quick turn around time.\n\nDo you need a Sensenich Certified Wood Propellers?\n\nWood props are less sensitive to the vibrations in an engine. They are lighter and allow for an increased payload, and they can be more affordable. If you’re interested, these are available by special order only. Please contact us to order today."
