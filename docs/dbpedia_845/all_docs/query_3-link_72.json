        "text": "The emergence of hybrid aircraft\n\n“The question is not ‘will we be seeing propellers on our aircraft in the future?’ but rather ‘when will they be back?’” states Stéphane Viala, Senior Vice-President Engineering, ATR, who is also responsible for innovation.\n\nIt is certainly true that all plans to design new eco-responsible aircraft are now based on the use of propellers, starting with hybrid aircraft. This is a research field which is being closely monitored by ATR, world leader in turboprops and regional aviation, along with all other aircraft manufacturers… But it could well be that ATR is a step ahead of the game, since it is one of the rare manufacturers to have continued to give pride of place to propellers, while the majority pursued other paths. “Of course we’re looking closely into hybrid propulsion, but with a more general approach, exploring the full range of options, which means considering which technologies are available and investigating their operational impacts, right down to their impacts on infrastructure,” Stéphane Viala explains.\n\nThrough the development of hybrids, ATR hopes to cut C02 emissions considerably, depending on the sources of electricity or hydrogen production that are ultimately chosen.\n\n“In any event, this is the way the situation is set to evolve: people are convinced it’s the way forward, and are starting to make themselves heard, in Northern Europe, Australia and New Zealand, in particular. Sooner or later, the voices of these populations will result in evermore tangible actions.”\n\nFor ATR and all other aircraft manufacturers, the crucial issue is therefore to innovate, while keeping operating costs down and minimising C02 emissions.\n\nATR, inherent innovation\n\nSince its creation in 1981, ATR has never ceased to be driven by innovation. On several occasions, it paved the way for disruptive technology which was later adopted by all manufacturers. To cite one example, ATR designed the first civil aircraft with carbon-fibre wings, in the 1980s.\n\nLikewise, ATR was the first to install a system known as Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) on its aircraft, continuing to this day to ensure they fly with the highest-quality components and the most up-to-date technology, often ahead of its time. The latest example to date is ClearVision, an augmented reality system which uses built-in cameras to display an augmented outside view from the cockpit, to give pilots perfect visibility in all external conditions, such as fog, for example. This innovative technology is in the process of being certified by ATR, which will be the first to deploy it on commercial aircraft\n\n* Clean Sky is a public-private research programme launched in 2008 by the European Commission and the European aeronautics industry"
