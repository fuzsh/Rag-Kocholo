        "text": "Aero, Friedrichshafen, Germany\n\nWednesday 18th April 2018\n\nSensenich Propellers now available through Adams Aviation as an official distributor.\n\nAdams Aviation is pleased to announce they are now a stocking distributor for Sensenich Propeller Manufacturing Co. Inc., supporting the full range of their aluminium aircraft propellers.\n\n“Sensenich has long been recognized for its reputation on quality, performance and customer service”, said Adams’ CEO Stephen Gosling, adding “so it perfectly complements our own reputation and is a welcome addition to the major manufacturers we represent.”\n\nEstablished in 1932, Sensenich aluminium propellers for general aviation aircraft such as Cessna and Piper, along with experimental aircraft such as Van’s RV and Glassairs, are well-renowned. Now their full range of metal propellers and accessories is available through Adams Aviation, as an authorised distributor, with many of the most popular models available from our stock.\n\nAll Sensenich aluminium propellers are manufactured from 2025 forged aluminium. The propellers are CNC machined and hand-finished to very tight tolerances. Each propeller then goes through a rigid 56 point inspection to assure you of the highest quality, most problem free propeller available. All aluminium propellers are vibration tested before being approved for use on any engine and come with a warranty period of twenty-four (24) months or two hundred (200) hours whichever occurs first from date of sale.\n\n————————————————————————————————————————————–\n\nAbout Adams Aviation Supply Co Ltd\n\nAdams Aviation Supply is Europe’s largest distributor of parts and accessories for general and business aviation.

During the 1960’s the use of UAV’s became prevalent and Sensenich was right there with propellers for the new industry.
