        "text": "SportairUSA is the United States distributor for DUC Propellers, the industry-leading forged carbon propellers from DUC Helices. There are models of DUC propellers suitable for light sport aircraft, ultralights, powered parachutes and experimental aircraft up to 140 HP. Formed under heat and pressure, then precisely finished in a 5-axis CNC router, DUC propellers exhibit outstanding craftsmanship as well as superior performance.\n\nGuaranteed Satisfaction\n\nIf your TL-2000 Sting or TL-3000 Sirius aircraft does not perform better with the DUC propeller, return it within 30 days for a full refund. Call SportairUSA for details.\n\nThe Swirl\n\nThe Swirl is a simple, ground-adjustable propeller that performs like a complex constant-speed prop. It is the propeller of choice for faster airplanes.\n\nThe blades of the Swirl propeller are designed to adjust the effective angle of attack under differing aerodynamic loads to optimize performance while maintaining engine RPM in the optimal torque range. This is done without movement or twisting of the blades. As a result, the DUC Swirl propeller has a constant speed effect, even though the pitch is set on the ground.\n\nThe prop takes a slimmer bite under load, and a fatter bite when cruising, without the need for complex electro-mechanical adjustments. Thanks to this effect, there is very little variation of RPM engine between static and dynamic loads. DUC propellers perform better through the whole of the flight envelope, exhibiting:\n\nConstant speed effect in a simple, not complex, propeller\n\nBetter effectiveness on takeoff and climb due to higher engine speed\n\nBetter cruise speed for a given RPM\n\nVery smooth operating characteristics\n\nIn the INCONEL version, the Swirl has the same advantages as the standard version. The Inconel Swirl blade has a very hard Inconel stainless steel insert to protect the leading edge. This propeller is well suited to a hostile environment (sand, gravel, etc….)\n\nThe Windspoon\n\nThe Windspoon, with its revolutionary shape, offers unrivalled performance for slower aircraft (speeds up to 80 kts for engines up to 120 hp). It is the ideal solution for trikes and similar aircraft.\n\nWindspoon propellers, in either the tractor or pusher configuration, produce more thrust at lower airspeed than any other propeller.\n\nThe precisely engineered profile of the blade is calculated to control the flow of air over the entire surface of the Windspoon. A contrary twist in the profile reduces stress and results in longer blade life. The revolutionary tip design reduces the tip vortex effect. The results are:\n\nGreater thrust at lower airspeed\n\nMaximum performance\n\nReduced stress for longer blade life\n\nLower fuel consumption\n\nLess noise\n\nThe INCONEL version of the Windspoon adds a very hard Inconel stainless steel insert to proect the leading edge.\n\nForged Carbon\n\nDUC propellers are forged from thermosetting carbon fiber, a process which enables precise reproduction of complex shapes, smooth surfaces and thin trailing edges that result in more power, better efficiency and reduced noise.\n\nExtended Warranty\n\nWarranted for six years, 600 hours against defects in materials and workmanship.\n\nWide Range of Application\n\nThere are DUC propellers for applications ranging from 40 hp ultralights to 180 hp four-seaters in several configurations:\n\n2 blades or 3\n\nTractor or Pusher\n\nClockwise or counter-clockwise rotation\n\nA variety of sizes\n\nSportairUSA Features These DUC Propellers for 900-series Rotax Engines:\n\nPROPELLERS ADJUSTABLE BLADES MATERIAL SWIRL Ground 2 or 3 Forged carbon WINDSPOON Ground 2 or 3 Forged carbon\n\nDUC makes a variety of other propellers, for direct drive and geared applications, that we will special order to meet your requirements.\n\nSportairUSA offers wood, aluminum and composite props from Sensenich Propeller, a leading U.S. manufacturer of props for aircraft, airboats and UAVs since 1932. 2-blade and 3-blade ground adjustable props designed for the ROTAX line of four-cylinder, four-cycle aircraft engines are of particular interest to the light sport aviation community. SportairUSA also represents the full line of Sensenich propellers, designed for a wide range of Continental, Lycoming, Jabiru and Franklin engines.\n\n2-Blade Propeller for ROTAX 912 & 914\n\nThe 2-blade Rotax propeller features the new PowerSweep blade planform. This propeller is manufactured using an internal pressure, closed mold system to produce a hollow, one piece blade. The process yields very repeatable blades with maximum strength, durability, and low weight. Don’t confuse this propeller with other propellers that are manufactured as two pieces and then bonded together afterwards. This propeller has the strength and durability to give you thousands of hours of trouble free flying.\n\nThis propeller features a co-cured bonded stainless steel leading edge for erosion and FOD protection. The two piece hub is manufactured from aerospace grade aluminum and is either alodined or anodized for corrosion protection.\n\nThe Pitch Cylinder Hub System allows its users to set a broad range of pitches, using the system’s index mark as a reference point when making adjustments. They adjust 16 degrees in pitch, affording maximum performance within an efficient aerodynamic envelope. The blade pins lock into the blade pin slot of the pitch cartridge, allowing the blades to move back and forth in tandem for ease of setting pitch.\n\nThe 2 Blade Rotax propeller is suitable for use on the 912 80HP, 912S 100HP and 914 115HP. There are 2 blade lengths available, 75″ and 70″ diameters. Either blade can be trimmed to make propellers from 66″ to 75″ diameter.\n\nComposite spinners are available for these propellers in 8″, 9″, 9.5″ 10″ 11″ and 12″ diameters.\n\n3-Blade Propeller for ROTAX 912 & 914\n\nThe 3 blade Rotax propeller also features the new PowerSweep blade planform. This propeller is manufactured using an internal pressure, closed mold system to produce a hollow, one piece blade. The process yields very repeatable blades with maximum strength, durability, and low weight. This propeller has the strength and durability to give you thousands of hours of trouble free flying.\n\nThis propeller features a co-cured bonded stainless steel leading edge for erosion and FOD protection. The two piece hub is manufactured from aerospace grade aluminum and is either alodined or anodized for corrosion protection.\n\nThe Pitch Pin Indexing System allows its users to set a broad range of pitches, using the system’s Pin Indexing system to make adjustments. The pins that come with each propeller allow 12 inches of pitch adjustment, affording maximum performance within an efficient aerodynamic envelope. The Index Pin locates the blade and then you simply lock the blades in place..\n\nThe 3 Blade Rotax propeller is suitable for use on the 912 80HP, 912S 100HP and 914 115HP. The propeller is available as a 68″ diameter and can be trimmed down to 65″ diameter.\n\nComposite spinners are available for these propellers in 9.5″ diameter.\n\nOther Sensenich Products\n\nSensenich also manufactures beautiful, efficient propellers for Continental, Lycoming, Jabiru and Franklin engines in wood, aluminum and composite materials, together with a variety of accessories. Call for information: (501) 2289-7777 or (888) FLY-SLSA.\n\nPowerMax is a new, 3-blade, in-flight-adjustable, constant-speed propeller from TL-Ultralight, the manufacturer of Sting and Sirius light sport aircraft.\n\nThe PowerMax propeller is designed for direct assembly onto the propeller boss of Rotax 912 to 914 series engines. The characteristics of the propeller are specifically matched to these power units to produce the optimum transfer of power and efficiency.\n\nAdvanced technologies used in design and production of the PowerMax propeller result in high precision and outstanding manufacturing quality. Weight is reduced to an almost unbelievable 7Kg – unheard of in this category of in-flight-adjustable propellers.\n\nThe all composite propeller blade is manufactured from carbon fibre, the hub and pitch control mechanism from the highest quality superdural alloys. The strength and resistance of the Powermax propeller was confirmed during stringent certification tests. Eg.— the strength of the blade corresponds to seven times the maximum permissible operational loading (which means the tensile strength of each blade is more than 10.5 tons).\n\nThe propeller is designed for maximum ease of use, using the constant-speed approach.\n\nA constant-speed control lever is placed just next to the throttle, where the pilot will quickly get used to adjusting the pitch with easy touches. By setting the lever to the marked position in constant-speed mode, the propeller automatically adjusts to the requested position and mode of flight. Control of the propeller is intuitive, similar to aircraft from higher weight categories, allowing maximum time spent with eyes on the sky.\n\nA highly reliable LINAK motor is used to adjust the blade pitch. It guarantees trouble-free operation even after hundreds of thousands of operational cycles.\n\nAn alternative to the manual selector lever is the PR1P speed controller which can also operate in constant-speed mode.\n\nPowerMax is the ideal power partner for the full range of ROTAX 912 and 914 engines."
