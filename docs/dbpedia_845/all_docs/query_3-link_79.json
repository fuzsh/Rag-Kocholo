Sherwin Williams Propeller coating is formulated with the extra adhesion and abrasion resistance needed to protect propellers from corrosion and wear. Compared to standard enamel and lacquer paints, our formula stays on the blade more flying hours. Therefore, with regular use, this formula can extend blade life. Use with P60G2 wash primer for optimal adhesion and wear.\n\nPaint Your Airplane Propeller\n\nPaint helps protect your aircraft propeller. A \"dress and paint\" by you or a professional will add life to your airplane propeller. This procedure can be done more frequently, but the mid-life inspection is a convenient time to get your propeller painted."
