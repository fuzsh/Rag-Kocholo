        "text": "Harry and Martin Sensenich, Lancaster, Pennsylvania farm boys, constructed an air driven farm wagon using an old World War I aircraft engine and propeller. Lacking funds to repair the propeller following an accident, they borrowed tools from their father and built their own. From this experience, the Sensenich Brothers Company was born in 1932.\n\nDuring World War II, with experience from volume production for military trainer aircraft, Sensenich became the largest manufacturer of wooden, fixed-pitch propellers for light aircraft. In 1948 the company also began producing metal-fixed-pitch propellers for general aviation. More recently Sensenich introduced ground adjustable composite propellers. Aircraft manufacturers using Sensenich propellers include Piper, Murphy, Diamond, Cessna, and Beech.\n\nThis propeller powered the Piper L-4B Grasshopper used for various military duties during WW II."
