        "text": "Sensenich Fixed-Pitch Propellers\n\nSonex continually tests new propellers for the various factory-supported engine and aircraft combinations. To date, Sonex has tested roughly 50 different propellers for these combinations. The recommended Propellers below yielded the best performance from this flight testing.\n\nOne propeller company, Sensenich, stands-out in our experience as offering the best performance, price and service. Sensenich uses CNC-Machining technology to ensure all production Propellers are the same as the propellers tested by Sonex. Their Custom-Designed Props fit the Sonex, Waiex, Xenos, and Onex Spinner and Cowl Hub.\n\nSonex also recommends using fixed-pitch wood or wood core with composite coating. These props are a light-weight, reliable, and affordable option for your Sonex Aircraft.\n\nWood props are offered with a Natural Wood Finish with Red Safety Stripes at prop tips, and Matte Black finish on back of propeller.\n\nWood props have a Matte Black finish on back of propeller and are available with three finish options:\n\nNatural Wood Clear Varnish with Red Safety Stripes at prop tips\n\nBlack Finish\n\nBlack Finish with White Safety Stripes at prop tips\n\nComposite Coated, or \"glass\" props have a Matte Black finish on the back of propeller and are available in any combination (body vs. tips) of the following colors:\n\nWhite\n\nRed\n\nBlack\n\nYellow\n\nGray"
