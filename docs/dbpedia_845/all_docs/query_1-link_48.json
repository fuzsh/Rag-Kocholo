This process ensures highly consistent blades that are strong, durable, and lightweight. The Sensenich STOL Prop itself is built to last, providing thousands of hours of trouble-free flying.\n\nThe Sensenich STOL Prop incorporates a co-cured bonded stainless steel leading edge for enhanced erosion and FOD protection. The two-piece hub is crafted from aerospace-grade aluminum for superior durability and is shot-peened and anodized for corrosion resistance.\n\nUsing the system's index pins, Sensenich’s innovative Pitch Pin Hub System empowers users to adjust the pitch across a wide range. The process is simple: loosen the hub clamping bolts, insert the desired pitch pin, position the blades against the pin, torque the mounting bolts, and you’re ready to fly. The entire pitch change can be completed in under five minutes. For PA-18 150 aircraft with O-320 engines, the Sensenich STOL Prop offers four-pitch settings in total.\n\nThis two-blade propeller is specifically approved for installation on Piper PA-18 “150” series Super Cubs equipped with Lycoming O-320 150 HP or 160 HP engines. The blades can also be trimmed from a maximum diameter of 82 inches down to 79 inches."
