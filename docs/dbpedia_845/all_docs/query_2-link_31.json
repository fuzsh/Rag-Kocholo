        "text": "Aircraft Propeller System Market Size & Share\n\nThe aircraft propeller system market size is projected to reach USD 414 million by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 6.1% during the forecast period. The aircraft propeller system industry is going to be driven by the increasing number of special light-sport aircraft (SLSA) deliveries worldwide.\n\nAircraft propellers are devices that are used in different types of aircraft to create relative motion by forcing the environmental air axially backward for the movement of an aircraft. They provide the required thrust to an aircraft to fly by rotating fans/rotor blades. Aircraft propellers transform rotational motion generated by rotating fans/rotor blades into sweeping force with the help of an aircraft engine to ensure the flight of the aircraft. Propeller systems consist of blades, hubs, and digital electronic controls that incorporate advanced aerodynamics, structures, control dynamics, software, and de-icing components into modern aircraft propeller systems industry. Propeller blades are the prime components in aircraft propeller systems and are generally made of aluminum or composites.\n\nTo know about the assumptions considered for the study, Request for Free Sample Report\n\nCOVID-19 impact on the Aircraft propeller system Market\n\nThe COVID-19 and resultant lockdowns have adversely impacted the aviation industry. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), every year, over 2 billion people take aircraft as their mode of transportation. Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, the year 2020 witnessed over 60% loss in global air traffic, which bought the aviation industry to a standstill.\n\nSeveral companies have already implemented policies to restrict non-essential travel to protect their employees. Remote and flexible working arrangements have been considered, and supply chains have become highly sophisticated and vital to the competitiveness of many companies. But their interlinked, global nature also makes them increasingly vulnerable to a range of risks, with more potential points of failure and less margin of error for absorbing delays and disruptions. New supply chain technologies are emerging, which can significantly improve visibility across the end-to-end supply chain and support more supply chain agility and resiliency without the traditional overhead associated with risk management techniques.\n\nThe spread of COVID-19 has also compelled companies to implement remote work solutions and digital technologies for business continuation and fleet optimization. For example, aircraft companies and OEMs are using AI for predictive maintenance, intelligent scheduling, real-time analytics, and improving performance. Currently, companies like C3 AI (Redwood City, California) and Honeywell International Inc. offer software for the fleet of the US Air Force and commercial aircraft carrier companies to provide data for timely maintenance using AI.\n\nAircraft Propeller System Market Dynamics\n\nAircraft Propeller System Market Driver: Increasing number of special light-sport aircraft (SLSA) deliveries worldwide\n\nThere has been an increase in the number of deliveries of Special Light-Sport Aircraft (SLSA) across the globe due to the increasing popularity of aviation sports in the North American and European regions.

The idea is to develop an aircraft that can be used to carry out weather monitoring and patrolling activities, among others at significantly low costs.\n\nThere are several prototype projects that have been undertaken by various key manufacturers of space vehicles and aircraft such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) (US), Airbus (France), and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (Switzerland) to develop aircraft that use solar energy or other renewable energy sources.\n\nFor instance, the NASA Pathfinder and NASA Pathfinder Plus were the first two aircraft developed by AeroVironment, Inc. (US) under the Environmental Research Aircraft and Sensor Technology (ERAST) program at NASA. These long-term, high-altitude aircraft can be used in atmospheric research, communication platforms, and satellites. Airbus Zephyr is an ongoing project being carried out by QinetiQ (UK). This project was initiated in 2003 and aims at developing a lightweight solar-powered Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), which is presently a part of the Airbus High Altitude Pseudo-Satellite (HAPS) program being carried out by Airbus (France.\n\nAircraft Propeller System Market Challenge: High maintenance cost of turboprop\n\nDifferent types of aircraft using turboprop engines have an extra gearbox and various moveable parts as compared to the aircraft using turbojet engines. These turboprop engines are more prone to loss of engine oil pressure causing oil leakages in aircraft than turbojet engines. Oil leakages are a common cause of catastrophic engine failure in an aircraft. As bleed air is sucked from the aircraft engine to pressurize the aircraft cabin, air entering the aircraft cabin is contaminated and can cause safety issues. Several initiatives are being undertaken by the manufacturers of aircraft engines to overcome these problems. For instance, General Electric (US) is developing a new GE93 advanced turboprop engine to overcome problems faced by conventional turboprop engines. Moreover, Hartzell Propellers (US) is developing aircraft propeller systems that do not need any overhauling after its installation in the aircraft.\n\nAircraft Propeller System Market Segmental Analysis\n\nBased on Type\n\nThe aircraft propeller system market is segmented by type into fixed-pitch propellers and variable-pitch propellers.
