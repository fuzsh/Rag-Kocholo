        "text": "Note: This propeller is intended for experimental category aircraft only!\n\nImprove your Aircrafts performance with our 2 blade experimental propeller designed specifically for various Continental and Lycoming O-235 powered aircraft such as Cubs and other similar aircraft. This propeller is manufactured using an internal pressure, closed mold system to produce a hollow, one piece blade. This process yields very repeatable blades with maximum strength, durability, and low weight. This propeller has the strength and durability to give you thousands of hours of trouble free flying.\n\nThis propeller features a co-cured bonded stainless steel leading edge for erosion and FOD protection. The two piece hub is manufactured from aerospace grade aluminum and is shot peened for durability and anodized for corrosion protection.\n\nThe Pitch Pin Hub System allows its users to set a broad range of pitches, using the systems index pins to make adjustments. Simply loosen the hub clamping bolts, insert the desired pitch pin, set the blades against the pin, torque the mounting bolts and go flying! The entire pitch change process takes less than 5 minutes.\n\nThis 2 blade propeller is suitable for use on the Lycoming O-235 and Continental engines ranging from A-65 through O-200. The blades can be trimmed from the maximum 72″ diameter to 68″ diameter."
