Propeller pitch is selected as appropriate to aircraft type, engine rating, and climb/cruise preference. Propeller leading edge protection is provided by an inlaid urethane leading edge, which is cast in place on the blade with no aerodynamic penalties. Wood construction propellers are available with fiberglass covering for added environmental and abrasion protection. This is highly recommended for rough fields and/or pusher aircraft. A clear spar varnish finish is standard on wood propellers, with specific color options available for wood propellers and required for wood/composite propellers.",
