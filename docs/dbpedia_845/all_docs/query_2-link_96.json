I had a high oil pressure indication that drove me nuts for a while. It seems the pervious owner changed out the OPRV spring to the wrong part number. Since the prop is 1800 hours over TBO, I figured it would be a good idea to get it OH. When I pulled the first bolt my heart, and wallet, sank. All of the prop mounting holes have pitting in them.

In Canada the regulations have this to say about fixed-pitch props:\n\nCAR 625 Appendix C\n\n6. Fixed Pitch and Ground Adjustable Propellers\n\n(b) At intervals of not more than 5 years, the propeller shall be removed from the aircraft and inspected for corrosion or other defects over its entire surface, including the hub faces and the mounting hole bores. While the propeller is removed, it shall also be checked for correct dimensions. However, if defects which require repairs beyond those recommended as field repairs by the propeller manufacturer are found, the propeller shall be repaired by an organization approved for the overhaul of propellers.\n\nSteel bolts in aluminum propellers cause corrosion when moisture gets in there. Corrosion pitting can cause cracking and catastrophic prop failure. It would be rare. How much pitting is OK? Don't know. The prop guys have prop manufacturer's manuals to guide them, so that's where the prop goes.\n\nOur five-year inspection mandate tends to catch that stuff early, before it's too late to save it.\n\nNordicDave\n\nEn-Route\n\nJoined\n\nOct 31, 2015\n\nMessages\n\n2,654\n\nLocation\n\nMonterey County\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nNordicDave\n\nApr 15, 2021\n\n#8\n\nGeneral comment NOT directed at OP.\n\nAmazes me how little care some pilots give props.

A screw installed to stop a crack. Tension spring missing from baffling. The list goes on.\n\nFor this annual, all the fuel and oil flex lines are being replace. Gascolator upgraded to Steve's Aircraft version. Either new SureFlys or OH of the Slicks. OH the prop, if I'm lucky, or new. New baffle material. Replace all external rusty hardware. And of course use the $20/gram valve lube on the fuel selector. Check rocker push rods and perform valve clearance. The one upgrade I would like to do but having an issue finding is a four point harness.

A number of years ago hardware mfr’rs quit producing various spec hardware like AN, offering only NAS, MS, etc. The aircraft OEMs updated their IPCs to reflect this change in the supply and it now shows NAS bolts for seatbelts where AN bolts used to be listed. If you look in an older revision IPC you will see the AN hdw listed which are still acceptable for most S/N aircraft.\n\nStrutwipe\n\nPre-takeoff checklist\n\nJoined\n\nMay 8, 2019\n\nMessages\n\n182\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nStrutwipe\n\nApr 16, 2021\n\n#16\n\nNot to get off topic but I am curious about a certain thought process I'm having. While I await the fate of the propeller, I have been stripping paint on some panels to clean up surface corrosion.

It's an overhung load, not a pure tensile or shear load. Like others, I have often found AN4s there while the IPC calls for the NAS bolts.\n\nkgruber\n\nFinal Approach\n\nJoined\n\nJan 3, 2007\n\nMessages\n\n5,109\n\nLocation\n\nWestern Washington\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nSkywag\n\nApr 16, 2021\n\n#19\n\nYou might call the FBO Avion at the Bremerton National Airport (KPWT).

What's to go wrong that won't be noticed on a preflight?\n\nAlso to your point, though, constant-speed props terrify me. If I have a nightmare about flying, it will be a blade being chucked and the rest of the FWF following it, leaving me to pick a crater to tumble self and wreckage into.

Fixed-pitch props are slabs of metal. What's to go wrong that won't be noticed on a preflight?\n\nOn the fixed pitch, the prescribed pitch angle flattens overtime and needs to be re-twisted to specifications. Props having a very long service life, not uncommon to find them dressed below service limit dimensions. I’ve also seen them with stress fractures and other issues revealed with eddy current inspections.\n\nMost prop shops will inspect for no charge, with a fix pitch overhaul typically $1500-$2200. Prop comes back looking like brand new. Very common for pick up and drop off charges included in the price for a shop in the region. It would be easy to speculate an aircraft owner would recoup that in fuel savings overtime with more efficient set of blades.\n\nI suspect some who have a prop service in many years without overhaul, avoid it due to the risk of being told it’s below service limits and requiring to put out $5500-$6500 for something new or newer.\n\nLast edited: Apr 16, 2021\n\narnoha\n\nCleared for Takeoff\n\nJoined\n\nJul 25, 2015\n\nMessages\n\n1,329\n\nLocation\n\nSaratoga, CA\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\narnoha\n\nApr 16, 2021\n\n#22\n\nI'm sort of curious about this. Fixed-pitch props are slabs of metal. What's to go wrong that won't be noticed on a preflight?\n\nAgree with @NordicDave . I recently had my 172's prop overhauled. It was due to corrosion on the rear mounting face. There was no way I was ever going to see that. The only reason we saw it at all was due to a renter of my aircraft scratching the prop on something (and I still don't have the whole story). That necessitated the inspection, which resulted in discovering the unrelated corrosion. And yeah, it was $2000 + R&R. The prop did, indeed, come back looking shiny and new.\n\nStrutwipe\n\nPre-takeoff checklist\n\nJoined\n\nMay 8, 2019\n\nMessages\n\n182\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nStrutwipe\n\nApr 16, 2021\n\n#23\n\nWell, I just got off the phone with the prop shop.
