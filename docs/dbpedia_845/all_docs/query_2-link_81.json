UAV have wide application in industries such as e-commerce and oil & gas. In e-commerce industry, UAVs are used to deliver products to customers and in the oil & gas these are used for inspection of infrastructure and gas pipelines. UAV also have wide application in the military sector. These are used for surveillance and rescue missions. UAV are also used by various government bodies for mapping of the geographical area and surveillance purposes. According to Coherent Market Insights’ analysis, due to COVID-19 pandemic countries such India, China, and the U.S. are using drones for surveillance of towns and cities.\n\nThe Global UAV propellers Market is estimated to account for US$ 1268.7 Mn in terms of value by the end of 2030.\n\nMarket Dynamics\n\nThe global UAV propellers market is expected to grow significantly during the forecast period, owing to increasing demand for UAV from industries such as the oil & gas, mining, and e-commerce. In the mining industry, drones with camera are used for capturing images of the sites and using these images photometry software generates the 3D maps of mines. The photometry software also helps to determine volume of the area to be excavated from specific mine location. For instance, in August 2019, BHP Group plc, one of the giant companies in the coal industry, is using drones in Queensland, Australia coal mines for inspections, surveying, and mapping of mine. This factors will aid in positive growth of UAV propellers market during the forecast period\n\nIn oil & gas industry, there is a significant increase in demand for UAVs, for easy infrastructure and pipeline surveillance and inspection. Drone manufacturers around the globe are collaborating with oil and gas companies to overcome the challenges faced by the UAV in aerial inspection. For instance, in September 2019, Flylogix Limited launched North Sea drone initiative in collaboration with Total S.A., UK air traffic navigation services provider-NATS, and the Oil & Gas Technology Centre (OGTC). This initiative was aimed to overcome the challenges experienced by UAV in the inspection of infrastructure in the North Sea.\n\nKey features of the study: This report provides an in-depth analysis of the global UAV propellers market and provides market size (US$ million) and compound annual growth rate (CAGR %) for the forecast period (2022-2030), considering 2021 as the base year.
