        "text": "Sensenich’s 74DM6 Aluminum Propeller is designed for use on Lycoming O-290 and O-320 engines from 125 to 165 Horsepower. This propeller is used on aircraft such as Beech, Bellanca, and numerous Piper aircraft.\n\nIt is available in a number of different pitches to match your aircraft’s speed profile. This propeller comes without a spacer and is drilled for 3/8″ attaching bolts.\n\nThis blade was designed for medium horsepower Lycoming engines in aircraft with a speed range of 120 – 170 MPH. Check with your aircraft manufacturer for a spinner for your particular aircraft.\n\nAll Sensenich aluminum propellers are manufactured from 2025 forged aluminum. The propellers are CNC machined and hand-finished to very tight tolerances. Each propeller then goes through a rigid 56 point inspection to assure you of the highest quality, most problem free propeller available. All aluminum propellers are vibration tested before being approved for use on any engine."
