        "text": "The world-famous Art Mattson prop tip mod! With this STC and your prop in good condition, you can have your favorite prop shop do the mod.\n\nFor most aircraft, the propeller can be pitched 2″ coarser with no effect on static rpm. That means you can choose to leave the pitch alone and increase climb performance, pitch it 2″ coarser and increase top speed without hurting climb performance, or split the difference at 1″ coarser and improve climb and cruise!\n\nPegasus Innovations is the home of the world-famous Art Mattson propeller tip modification.\n\nThis modification can be applied to several Sensenich props on Cessna 150-150K, Aeronca, Cessna 170, Stinson 108, Piper Tomahawk, and MANY more!\n\nWith this STC and your prop in good condition, you can have your favorite prop shop do the mod. Please enter your propeller shop’s information so we can send them the instructions.\n\n*This same type of propeller tip modification is used by Jon Sharp on his world record setting formula one racer “NEMESIS” (283.75 mph) NEMESIS has also won the formula one division of the Reno Air Race for the past several years using this same type propeller tip modification.\n\nThe reshaping of the tip reduces the tip turbulence that causes drag, making the propeller more efficient. This modification is like getting more horsepower.\n\nTypically after modifying the tips, two inches of pitch can be added without affecting the takeoff or climb performance. The modification itself acts like adding an inch of pitch, therefore when repitching two inches it’s the same as re-pitching three inches for the cruise. This convert to 4 to 6 mph.\n\nThis does not include the labor or an overhaul of your prop, you need to choose your prop shop to do the work. We can refer you to some really good ones.\n\nThe propeller tip mod is applicable to Sensenich propellers used on a variety of aircraft and McCauley props used on 180hp Cherokees. Please select your model from the drop-down menu."
