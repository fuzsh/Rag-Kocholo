        "text": "You MUST change or overhaul your propeller if you have a damaged or unserviceable propeller due to a strike or corrosion. Unseen internal corrosion destroys many propellers. The only way to properly inspect the surfaces of the hub and the blades for corrosion is through a teardown. You should overhaul your propellers if your propeller has reached recommended overhaul intervals based on either calendar time or flight hours. The manufacturer’s recommended TBO (flight time or calendar time) is mandatory for commercial aircraft.\n\nAll propellers have recommended overhaul intervals based on calendar time and flight hours. Depending on the prop model, the amount of time in service could be 1,500 or 2,000 flight hours. It is important that calendar time be carefully considered at about 5 years in service. Too many pilots ignore the calendar limit!\n\nConsider the aircraft that flies fewer than 100 hours per year. At 100 hours per year, a typical propeller might not get checked for 20 years! This is clearly a bad idea! Your propeller should be overhauled at either the time or calendar limit, whichever occurs first. If the engine comes up for overhaul before the prop reaches either limit, we recommend removing the prop and governor and having them overhauled at the same time.\n\nIf a propeller must be shipped (for trade in or repair) never apply tape directly to the blades. Wrap each propeller blade with 3 or 4 layers of corrugated cardboard, applying additional layers to the tips.\n\nIf your propeller is a variable pitch, wrap the hub with several layers of cardboard and then cover the hub with a box padded so as to keep the hub from direct contact during shipping.\n\nIf you are using a wooden box for shipment use caution to insure that the propeller fits snugly and is well padded inside the wooden container as the propeller will sustain damage if room for movement exists inside the crate.\n\nBalancing your aircraft propeller increases the life of your engine, improves performance, reduces vibration and saves maintenance dollars. PropellerMan’s experienced technician will generally reduce your propeller’s vibrations to half the acceptable .14 IPS limit.\n\nReading the FAQs below will help you to better understand the advantages of a dynamically balanced propeller.\n\nHow do I know if my propeller is in need of being dynamically balanced?\n\n•If you have had your propeller overhauled or replaced, you should have the propeller dynamically balanced. (The propeller repair shop will provide a static balance only).\n\n•When your propeller is removed for engine work, you may want to have the balance rechecked.\n\n•If your engine keeps developing oil leaks after repairs have been made.\n\n•If your plane vibrates excessively. (NOTE: Some out of balance propellers do not cause perceivable vibration but still need to be balanced!)\n\nMy aircraft runs fine, why have my propeller balanced?\n\nMost fixed-wing aircraft will benefit from having their propeller dynamically balanced. Most of the aircraft we have balanced had an initial vibration level greater than .45 IPS, three times the acceptable vibration level. Your engine, firewalls, instrumentation and even the structure of your aircraft will benefit from reduced vibration levels following a dynamic balance.\n\nMy aircraft propeller was overhauled recently. Should I have my propeller dynamically balanced?\n\nThe best time to dynamically balance a propeller/crankshaft is immediately following overhaul or propeller replacement. Even new aircraft with zero time engines and propellers need to be dynamically balanced. The shop that overhauled your propeller will statically balance your propeller before returning it to you. It must then be dynamically balanced when bolted to your aircraft.\n\nWhat level of propeller vibration is acceptable?\n\nIn most cases, the vibration level due to mass imbalance can be brought down to under .14 IPS (inches per second) and usually to less than .07 IPS. When propeller vibration levels are this low, the operator will see a significant reduction in component wear and fatigue and the majority of pilots immediately notice a positive effect on the level of vibration in the cabin.\n\nWill having my propeller dynamically balanced disguise other engine problems?\n\nNo! An engine with an internal problem causing unusual vibration will not respond to balancing in the same way that an engine which only vibrates from a propeller imbalance\n\nFor constant-speed propellers during run-up, keep an eye on the oil pressure and temperature. Pressure should be in the normal, green arc range, and the temperature should be rising according to outside conditions. Because the constant-speed propeller needs both good oil pressure to do its job and oil thin enough to be pumped through the smaller passages of the prop, it is important to keep these parameters in mind—particularly for cold weather departures. A takeoff with cold oil will result in a poorly governed prop and a possible over-speed event. In subfreezing conditions, it could take 15 to 30 minutes to get minimum oil temperature. Storing the airplane overnight in a heated hangar or calling for preheat will help greatly."
