        "text": "Classic 1940â€™s wood propeller constructed of laminated Birch using resorcinol glue. Aircraft grade cotton fabric applied to the last 12 inches of the blade. Hand formed stainless leading edge and cap screwed and riveted on for erosion protection. Spar varnish finish.\n\nAll Sensenich wood aircraft propellers are manufactured from aircraft grade Birch and laminated using resorcinol glue. Each propeller is CNC machined and hand-finished to very tight tolerances. Each propeller then goes through a rigid 56 point inspection to assure you of the highest quality, most problem free propeller available."
