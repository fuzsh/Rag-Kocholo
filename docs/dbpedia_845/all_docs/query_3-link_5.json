        "text": "The device or the component of the aircraft that converts the rotational energy from the engine or any other part of the aircraft to propulsion is known as a propeller. A propeller is an integral part of an aircraft as the aircraft cannot fly without it.\n\nAlso Read: Risks To The Safety Of An Aircraft\n\nThrough the years, many different types of aircraft propellers have been made and tried in the aviation industry by aviation welding technicians. Some were more successful than others. The following blog enlists the different types of propellers used on airplanes in the aircraft industry so you can learn the differences between them.\n\nFixed-pitch\n\nPropellers that have the blade angle or blade pitch converted into a propeller are called fixed-pitch propellers. It is called ‘fixed’ because once the propeller has been made, the blade angle cannot be changed. Fixed pitch propellers usually come in one piece and are made up of aluminum alloy or wood.\n\nThese propellers are designed to provide maximum efficiency for the forwarding motion of a plane. They are made to fit the specific needs of both the aircraft engine and speed. Even a slight change in the specified conditions can lower the efficiency of the engine and the propeller. In turn, these inconsistencies in the engine also affect other components like the engine mount.\n\nFixed-pitch propellers are used in aircraft with a slow speed, power, altitude, and range. Many single-engine aircraft have fixed-pitch propellers installed as they are simple in operation and less expensive.\n\nWooden Propellers\n\nWooden fixed propellers are hardly found in modern aircraft. However, they were widely used before metal propellers were invented. These propellers were made using the layer-to-layer approach using specially made wood. Yellow birch wood, black cherry wood, sugar maple wood, and black walnut wood were commonly used to make these vintage wooden propellers.\n\nMetal Propellers\n\nMetal propellers were first used for military purposes in 1940. These were made extra strong by using credible aluminum alloy. The metal material used in the making of the propeller was treated to enhance its properties and make them resistant to immediate warping from heat and cold damage.\n\nMetal propellers have taken over the aviation industry to the extent that now it is almost impossible to find a propeller made of anything else but metal.\n\nGround-Adjustable Propellers\n\nThe operation of ground-adjustable propellers are similar to that of the fixed-pitch propeller. The pitch and the blade angle of the propeller can only be changed when it is not turning. A clamping mechanism is responsible for holding the blades in place. You can move the blades by loosening this mechanism.\n\nHowever, there is no way to move the pitch during the flight to meet the varying requirements. In fact, this is the top reason why ground-adjustable propellers are not used in modern aircraft.\n\nConstant Speed Propeller\n\nThese types of propellers provide high speed when the airplane dives and slows down when it climbs. This is due to the changing pressure and usage of the aircraft engine. To ensure that the propellers provide a smooth and efficient flight, the pilots try to keep the speed as constant as possible.\n\nThe working mechanism of a constant-speed propeller is called a propeller governor. A propeller governor senses the speed of the engine and changes the blade angle accordingly, irrespective of the aircraft's operating condition.\n\nFeathering Propellers\n\nThese types of propellers are used for propulsion in multi-engine aircraft. If one of the engines fails, the propellers lower the propelling drag to the minimum. Feathering propellers are equipped to turn their blades during a flight to a 90 degree angle. Propellers are usually turned to feathering mode when the aircraft engine does not produce the required power to turn the propeller.\n\nTo understand how feathering works, just understand that the blades of the propeller are rotated parallel to the line of the flight to minimize the drag on the plane. When the blades become parallel, they stop turning, and the windmill effect is minimized.\n\nAbout Acorn Welding\n\nAcorn Welding is committed to complete customer satisfaction by being a reliable source of aircraft parts of unsurpassed quality, workmanship, and airworthiness.
