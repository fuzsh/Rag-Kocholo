Sensenich Propeller will be celebrating 80 years in business at the AirVenture Oshkosh 2012 fly-in this year, by giving one of its next 80 customers an 80% discount on his or her new prop.

"I hate gimmicks," says company President Don Rowell, "but hey, this is a birthday celebration; and who wouldn't want 80% off?"

To be eligible, a private customer (not an airframe manufacturer or OEM) must be one of the first 80 to buy and pay for a Sensenich prop between the close of Sun 'n Fun and the opening of Oshkosh. Any new or rebuilt Sensenich prop purchased from the factory -- wood, metal, or composite -- is eligible. The winner will be drawn at Sensenich's Press Conference at Airventure (date to be confirmed soon, and will be seen in the official show schedule); the winner need not be present to win.

Sensenich has manufactured props for the industry since 1932, and its lineup now encompasses propellers for airboats and UAVs, along with traditional aviation, in classic wood, metal, and industry-leading ground-adjustable composite props in two- or three-blade configurations, for engines including many experimental powerplants, plus Rotax, Jabiru, Continental, and Lycoming engines up to 320 cubic inches -- with more on the way.

What does Sensenich plan for its 90th celebration? Rowell says, "We'll have to wait and see."
