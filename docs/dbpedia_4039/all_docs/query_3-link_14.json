        "text": "Rather than hijack Bob's thread, here's a second one for the alternative extreme.\n\nWhat's the hottest temperature you'll fly in?\n\nLast weekend I taunted some friends who fly shark patrol by waving an ice-cold bottle of water at them from the other side of the security fence as they stumbled out of a sweat-soaked Cessna 172 at 40 deg C (about 105 deg F)\n\nI'm not a huge fan of flying when it's hot. I've observed the CHTs nudging 400F on climbout from sea level on a 36 deg C day (about 95 deg F). Easily fixed by dropping the nose a bit to increase the climb speed, or perhaps by levelling out and flying at full rich cruise power for a few minutes to let the temp come back down before resuming the climb. By the time I get above 5000' the combination of manifold pressure and adiabatic cooling basically solves the problem.\n\nBut I don't like having to solve it.\n\nBesides that, being in a bubble canopy when it's that hot is pretty miserable at the best of times. Even when I'm up where it's cool and high, I know you'll have to get hot and low again eventually.\n\nI'm not alone in feeling like this, right?\n\n- mark\n\nI followed Rosie a couple of years ago from Carson City to Las Vegas. We were quite comfortable at 11.5 and when we tuned in the ASOS at Boulder City it reported 115F. I commented that I thought aluminum melted above 100F, I really did not want to go down. After a quick turn we departed Boulder City for southern California and climbed up to 12.5 for cooler air.\n\nI don't remember having cooling problems during the climb. I climb full rich in the heat to help keep things cool.\n\nFrom Rosie: Living in the desert, (full rich) takeoffs above 110F is normal, and I'm starting out at 2500' MSL (density altitude is >6K). My EI temp gauge alerts me at 430F to start leveling out, and I have NO problem letting the hottest cylinder see 450F for a moment in the level flight. When the highest cylinder temp is below 400F, I'll start an easy climb to altitude and also start leaning the mixture on the way up. My first-run cylinders went to 2500 hours with no complaints.\n\nAs for clothing, when it's REALLY hot, I like to wear the Lightweight, Polyester-Tricot Shirts that breath, much more comfortable than cotton\n\nToo hot in climb\n\nI am starting to fly the 7a higher and was surprised yesterday with CHT issues in Michigan in a climb from 5k to 11k. it was not that hot (80F on the ground) but I was only able to get 300fpm or so to keep the CHTs below 425 in the climb! I was leaning all the way up. I noticed this post, do others use full rich mixture in extended climbs? Its a Matituck O360 with CS hartzell, WOT and 2500rpm.\n\nhad no issues at all with oil temps.\n\nI followed Rosie a couple of years ago from Carson City to Las Vegas.

Yes, it was uncomfortable, but I learned a lot about density altitude and flying an underpowered aircraft is such conditions too. I think the hottest I ever flew it in was 118 degrees at the surface. Arrived at my home airport at +6500AGL and circling down over the airport to pattern altitude was like descending into a blast furnace. Nobody else was dumb enough to be out flying that day\n\nThe hottest I've ever flown an RV was 114 at the surface, and that was the OAT here in W.Falls when coming home from Oshkosh a couple years ago. It was miserable, hot and bumpy, but still made a nice smooth wheel landing.\n\nI don't like to intentionally go on a \"pleasure flight\" in an RV if the temps are over 100. Above that, it's just not fun anymore. On hot summer days, we gotta do our pleasure flying early just after sunrise and be back home on the ground by about 10:00am before the thermals get miserable.\n\nI used to fly 9 passengers at a time in a C-402 from Las Vegas to the Grand Canyon, shuttling tour groups back and forth and doing air tours in the very early 1990's. When the day time high said 115f it was closer to 125f on the tarmac. The poor passengers were already overheated before I could get the engines started (and we were all pretty fast at getting going, 5 to 8 planes at a time, all right after each other like a \"Baa Baa Black Sheep\" Squadron scramble). No air conditioning. The tires felt soft and slippery on the hot pavement during taxi and the climb out at 120kts was less than enthusiastic but at least we had ram air at 100 degrees shooting at us (that felt like a cold wind comparatively). Usually before setting takeoff power I could see the sweat soaking through my pant legs and there was just nothing you could do. I remember feeling like it was a good deal when the OAT showed 80 degrees at altitude. No way could I deal with those kinds of physioligical conditions today - no way. At 22 years old I was exhausted after a full day of flying upwards of 6 flights in heat and turbulence with no autopilot or yaw damper - 14 hour duty days, 110 hours of hard flying a month. I grew up playing competitive sports and training hard; double days in football, cross country running, track and field, soccer, working out hard in the gym between practice sessions... I knew heat and exhaustion BUT this was far more than simple fatigue.\n\nBe careful out there on hot days. It's not just the density altitude that our engines and wings feel. It's the heat we endure and the physiology of being uncomfortable enough to subtly miss picking up on threats and not being able to actively manage hazards like we normally can. When we are hot and uncomfortable our minds are not even close to 100 percent!\n\nI am starting to fly the 7a higher and was surprised yesterday with CHT issues in Michigan in a climb from 5k to 11k. it was not that hot (80F on the ground) but I was only able to get 300fpm or so to keep the CHTs below 425 in the climb!

I watch CHT too but it is unusual for me to have to do anything about them. I usually climb at 110 to 120 knots. I am surprised at your higher altitude story because I would have a hard time forcing my CHT out of bounds at that altitude. My only tickle with higher temps is on takeoff and initial climb (but that is only about 395F on hot summer days). My oil temps were too cold. Last winter I taped 1/2 the cooler shut. Could have gone more shut in the winter. Moved to 1/4 shut this summer (admitedly a cool season here but I think 1/4 is still right for me for any summer).\n\nSorry for the thread drift. In regards to hot weather, Diane and I have not really had to push the boundaries yet. I think high 90's may be the worst we have seen so far. Altitude has fixed that."
