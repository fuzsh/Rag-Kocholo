The heat streak matched similar six-day streaks set in September 2023, August 1996 and June 1985.\n\nRedding records all-time high temperature\n\nRedding and Stockton both smashed heat records on Saturday, the weather service said.\n\nRedding reported an all-time high temperature of 119 degrees, beating the previous record by a single degree. The city also demolished the previous daily record of 111 degrees, set in 1984.\n\nStockton set a daily temperature record on Saturday with a high of 111 degrees, compared to 106 degrees in 1905.\n\nWhich other California cities saw record-breaking weather?\n\nFresno, Hanford and Merced all bested records for high temperatures on Saturday, according to the service’s Hanford office.\n\nFresno had a high of 112 degrees on Saturday, just one degree above the temperature record set in 1905. It also reported a record low temperature of 81 degrees, compared to 78 degrees in 2007.\n\nMerced recorded a high of 111 degrees on Saturday, blasting a 108-degree record set in 1931.\n\nMeanwhile, Hanford eclipsed another daily high-temperature record set in 105 — 111 degrees — with a high of 113 degrees.\n\nRecord-breaking heat continued in the Central Valley on Sunday, the weather service said.\n\nFresno had a high of 114 degrees that day, three degrees higher that its 1905 record. The city also beat its daily low temperature record of 76 degrees, set in 2014, with a low of 81.\n\nHanford bested its 1905 heat record of 113 degrees by a single degree, and tied with a low-temperature record of 72 degrees set in 2001.\n\nMerced set a daily heat record with a high of 111 degrees, compared to 109 degrees in 1941.\n\nMadera, which had a high of 110 degrees, topped a heat record set in 1921 by one degree. It also tied with its low-temperature record of 73 degrees from 1936.\n\nAlso on Sunday, Bakersfield tied with its high-temperature record of 114 degrees, set in 1905, and surpassed its low-temperature record from 1968 by a single degree with 82 degrees.\n\nWhat about the Central Coast?\n\nIn San Luis Obispo County, Paso Robles burst a 17-year-old temperature record on Friday.\n\nThe North County city reached 112 degrees, breaking the previous 110-degree record for the same day in 2007."
