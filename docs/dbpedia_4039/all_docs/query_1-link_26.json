It is also known that the brain has high levels of metabolic activity, and all energy used for brain metabolism is finally transformed into heat. However, the issue of brain temperature as a factor reflecting neural activity and affecting various neural functions remains in the shadow and is usually ignored by most physiologists and neuroscientists. Data presented in this review demonstrate that brain temperature is not stable, showing relatively large fluctuations (2-4°C) within the normal physiological and behavioral continuum. I consider the mechanisms underlying these fluctuations and discuss brain thermorecording as an important tool to assess basic changes in neural activity associated with different natural (sexual, drinking, eating) and drug-induced motivated behaviors. I also consider how naturally occurring changes in brain temperature affect neural activity, various homeostatic parameters, and the structural integrity of brain cells as well as the results of neurochemical evaluations conducted in awake animals. While physiological hyperthermia appears to be adaptive, enhancing the efficiency of neural functions, under specific environmental conditions and following exposure to certain psychoactive drugs, brain temperature could exceed its upper limits, resulting in multiple brain abnormalities and life-threatening health complications.\n\nKEYWORDS: Brain metabolism, neural activation, vascular tone, motivated behavior, reward, cocaine, heroin, rats\n\nIntroduction\n\nTemperature is traditionally viewed as one of the basic homeostatic parameters of living organisms and its regulation is an essential topic of physiology, which considers the mechanisms determining relative stability of core body temperature following highly variable changes in environmental temperatures. Aristotle (384–322 BC) was probably the first to define temperature as one of five basic biological processes and provided a logical account to what we now call temperature regulation. Although it is known that temperature affects neural activity and neural functions, we have limited knowledge of normal and pathological fluctuations of brain temperature and the mechanisms underlying brain thermal homeostasis and its alterations. These issues are usually ignored by thermophysiologists, who examine neural mechanisms underlying stability of body temperature and the development of fever, a stable increase in body temperature usually associated with viral and bacterial infections [1–4]. While not clearly stated in most conceptualizations describing body temperature regulation, brain temperature is usually viewed either as a stable, tightly regulated homeostatic parameter or a parameter that passively follows body temperature changes.\n\nIt is well known that the brain plays a crucial role in the regulation of body temperature by detecting changes in environmental temperatures, integrating sensory information, and adjusting, via effector mechanisms, heat production and/or heat loss to the external environment [4,5]. However, the brain itself has high levels of metabolic activity, generating a significant amount of heat. Being only a fraction of the human body’s mass, the brain accounts for ~20% of the organism’s total oxygen consumption in resting conditions [6]. Most energy used for neuronal metabolism is expended during restoration of membrane potentials after electrical discharges [7–10], but significant energy is also used for neural processes not directly related to neuronal electrical activity, particularly for the synthesis of macromolecules as well as for the functioning of glial, endothelial and epithelial cells, which greatly outnumber the amount of neurons. Since all energy used for brain metabolism is finally transformed into heat [6], intense heat production appears to be an essential feature of brain metabolic activity. The brain tissue is also exceptionally well vascularized, receiving 15–20% of total cardiac output [11]. Therefore, intense cerebral blood flow is not only the means to deliver nutrients and oxygen essential for brain metabolic activity but also the means to remove from brain tissue unnecessary products of metabolic degradation, including heat continuously generated through brain metabolism.\n\nThe primary goal of this work is to consider brain temperature as an important physiological parameter, which fluctuates within relatively large limits (3–4°C) within the normal physiological continuum at stable ambient temperatures. I will begin with a short historical overview of brain thermorecording, which was used by early physiologists as a tool to study and understand brain functions. Then, I will present data on changes in brain temperature induced by natural arousing stimuli and discuss the mechanisms underlying these physiological fluctuations, particularly the contribution of intra-brain heat production due to metabolic neural activation and heat loss from brain tissue due to changes in cerebral and peripheral vascular tone. I will provide evidence that physiological brain temperature increases (brain hyperthermia) are triggered by changes in neuronal activity and differ from fever, a tonic temperature increase occurring during viral and bacterial infections [1,12]. Then, I will consider changes in brain temperature occurring during three types of natural motivated behavior (sexual, feeding and drinking) and discuss what we can learn from these data on basic mechanisms underlying goal-directed behavior.\n\nAfter establishing the limits of physiological and pathological brain hyperthermia, I will discuss brain temperature as a factor affecting different measures of neuronal activity, permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), activity of glial cells, brain ionic and water balance, and the structural integrity of different types of brain cells. Here, I will also discuss the role of naturally occurring brain temperature fluctuations as a factor significantly affecting microdialysis and electrochemical evaluations of changes in brain neurochemicals in awake, freely moving animals.\n\nIn contrast to physiological fluctuations that are triggered by neuronal activation, brain temperature also can “passively” increase during excessive bodily heat production and/or insufficiency of heat dissipation. These brain temperature increases may exceed upper physiological limits, resulting in pathological brain hyperthermia that significantly alters neural functions and may induce structural damage to brain cells and lethality.\n\nIn the final chapters of this review, I will consider brain temperature changes induced by neuroactive drugs, focusing on three popular drugs of abuse (e.g. cocaine, heroin, and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine or MDMA). In contrast to physiological increases in brain temperature, which are triggered by either direct activation of somatosensory pathways or by simple sensory stimuli that gained salience due to their previous association with positive or negative reinforcers, neuroactive drugs induce their temperature effects through their direct actions on specific central and peripheral neural substrates as well as cerebral and peripheral blood vessels, thus affecting brain metabolic activity and heat dissipation to the external environment. In contrast to relatively modest, transient and uniform physiological brain temperature fluctuations, the effects of drugs are distinct, dose-dependent, and are strongly modulated by activity state and environmental conditions. Furthermore, these effects can be quite different depending on whether the drug is received passively or is self-administered as a part of motivated drug-seeking behavior. This issue will be considered with respect to cocaine and heroin self-administration, two “unnatural” motivated behaviors, which are associated with robust and distinct changes in brain temperature. Despite different temperature responses induced by passively administered heroin and cocaine, the pattern of brain temperature fluctuations occurring during self-administration of these drugs shares many common features and similarities with other types of natural motivated behaviors.\n\nRobust hyperthermia is a known life-threatening complication of overdose of psychomotor stimulants such as MDMA and methamphetamine (METH). I will demonstrate that the brain temperature effects of these drugs are strongly modulated by high activity states and adverse environmental conditions that limit heat dissipation, thus leading to pathological brain hyperthermia that induce multiple functional and structural brain changes that could lead to lethality.\n\nThis review paper is primarily focused on our own studies conducted during the last 20 years and presented in multiple experimental reports. While my goal is to provide an overview and discuss the results of multiple studies and stress important discoveries related to brain temperature, this work differs from traditional comprehensive reviews, which present a massive amount of data and can often be boring. In contrast, this work is assembled as a personal journey in the very exciting area of brain thermorecording, which has exciting history and important implications for quite different aspects of physiology and medicine. This journey never had a clearly defined goal and it was not a straight and linear one, having multiple appendices, realizations of our own mistakes, and the appearances of new goals and directions. The best reward for the author will be attention to his work and substantive discussion and critiques, which could result in new ideas, new experiments to test these ideas, and an overall better understanding of the brain and its functions.\n\nBrain thermorecordining: Historical backgrounds\n\nThe middle of the XIX century was evidently the birth time of brain physiology as an experimental science. Several important discoveries in physics and chemistry made at that time catalyzed an intense search for objective parameters to characterize neural and psychic functions. Some of these paths failed but others resulted in groundbreaking discoveries that helped build the foundation of modern neuroscience.\n\nAfter the discovery of the first law of thermodynamics by Hermann von Helmholtz [13] and wide popularization of thermodynamic ideas within the scientific community, several groups of scientists in France, Germany, Italy, and the United States became focused on brain temperature as an objective parameter that could characterize brain functions and mental activity. They believed that the brain, somewhat like a muscle, manifests its dynamic power by a local increase in heat production, which could be detected by laboratory instruments. Pierre Paul Broca, French physician and anatomist, was obviously the first to explore this approach by using miniature surface thermometers strapped onto the scalps of human subjects [14]. While he was able to detect certain changes in temperature associated with intellectual and emotional activity, these changes were minor and the question remained whether these changes actually reflected true brain temperature or skin temperature affected by skin blood flow. In an attempt to eliminate the influences of blood vessels, Josiah Lombard used a device called a thermoelectric apparatus, which allowed to conduct local temperature measurements when part of the scalp was compressed, leaving it pale and bloodless [15,16]. However, despite extensive trials, Lombard was unable to obtain any consistent results.\n\nOne important step beyond Broca and Lombard was already done by German physiologist Moritz Schiff, who conducted the first direct brain temperature recordings in awake animals in the late 1860s [17], long before the first recordings of the brain’s electrical activity or even the realization that neural cells have electrical activity. Schiff believed that brain activation induced by various sensory, motor, and “psychic” events should be accompanied by heat production that could be detected by local temperature change. Although the thermocouple needles of Bacquerel and Blanchet (1835; see [18]) utilized by Schiff were a unique tool used to detect the temperature changes, Schiff’s experiments did not hold modern scientific criteria because the thermocouple produced too small currents, recording galvanometers were primitive, most readings were subjective, with no statistical techniques to assert the validity of results. Despite all these shortcomings, the experiments of Schiff resulted in many important discoveries. Particularly, Schiff was able to detect brain temperature increases induced by various sensory (light, sound, smell) and motivational (food) stimuli. He also described the differences in brain temperature responses to the presentation of food to hungry and satiated dogs, showing that brain response depended on the animal’s motivational state (i.e. hunger). Among other pioneering findings was the observation of gradual diminishment of brain temperature responses following repeated presentation of sensory stimuli. He also observed a temperature response to sensory stimuli which was previously associated with food. These findings clearly predated Ivan Pavlov’s conditioning experiments initiated 20–30 years after Schiff’s temperature work. The work of Moritz Schiff was highly valued by Claude Bernard, another great mind of early physiology, who mentioned that “the results of recent experiments (of Schiff) do not leave doubts. “Each time the spinal cord or a nerve exhibit sensitivity or movement, each time the brain performs intellectual work, a corresponding amount of heat is produced” [19]. These findings as well as thermal recordings from the human scalp [15,16,20] allowed William James, the “father of American psychology”, to conclude that “brain-activity seems accompanied by a local disengagement of heat.” He also speculated that cerebral thermometry may be a valuable tool in experimental psychology, allowing one to correlate brain activity with psychic functions [21]. While clearly pioneering, further work in attempting to measure brain temperature non-invasively failed, but the work initiated by Schiff and his pupils can be now viewed as the early roots of functional brain imaging. Hans Berger, through Schiffs’s pupil Angelo Mosso, was able in 1924 to substitute thermocouple needles with electrodes, giving rise to electroencephalography (EEG) that became the leading technique to study brain activity for several decades. While Broca, Lombard, and Schiff strongly believed that changes in brain temperature reflect brain activity, Charles-Emile Francois-Frank was possibly the first to suggest that brain temperature changes observed in response to sensory stimuli are due to changes in cerebral circulation [22]. He also was the first to detect a dorso-ventral brain temperature gradient, with lower basal values in superficially located structures compared to deeply located structures. While these early findings were obviously significantly affected by heat outflow from thermocouple sensors, and the explanation of this gradient by the warming of deep structures by presumably warm arterial blood appears incorrect (see below), these studies underscore the importance of cerebral circulation as a critical contributor to physiological brain temperature fluctuations.\n\nPhysiological brain temperature fluctuations: Causes and mechanisms\n\n… When you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of an eager and unsatisfactory kind; it may be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarcely in your thoughts advanced to the stage of Science, whatever the matter may be William Thompson, 1st Baron Kelvin (1883) [23].\n\nDespite the tight links between temperature and metabolism and temperature dependence of multiple neural processes, the pioneering experiments of Moritz Schiff and the ideas of William James were not reinforced at that time, although important reports utilizing brain thermorecordings sporadically appeared in the literature [24–30]. This is surprising because brain temperature recording in animals is not technically difficult and chronically implanted sensors allow for temperature monitoring with high temporal and spatial resolution in freely moving, behaving animals in multi-session experiments. The lack of interest in brain thermorecording could be related to the complexity in relating temperature as a basic physical parameter with different forms and manifestations of neural activity and conceptual mechanisms used to explain behavior (i.e. motivation, reinforcement, reward, punishment, etc.). The issue of brain temperature and its physiological fluctuations also stands at odds with the traditional ideas of thermoregulation, which view brain temperature as a stable or passively changing parameter. Furthermore, due to heat exchange both within the brain tissue and between the brain and rest of the body, brain temperature changes differ depending on temporal resolution; they show strong correlations when these parameters are determined with low temporal time resolution and important differences when analyzed with high, second-scale resolution.\n\nDespite the general belief that brain temperature is a strictly regulated parameter which is maintained at constant levels, thermorecording studies conducted in rats, cats, dogs, and monkeys revealed relatively large brain temperature fluctuations (±2–3°C) that occur at stable ambient temperatures following exposure to various sensory stimuli, spontaneous changes in activity states, and during different motivated behaviors [25–31]. As shown in these studies, brain temperature fluctuations correlated with modality and biological significance (salience) of the environmental challenges, spontaneous and stimuli-induced changes in EEG and motor activity, and they had some structural specificity. While these findings suggest neural activity as the primary cause of brain temperature fluctuations, these fluctuations correlated in different brain structures and were typically associated with similar changes in core body temperature. Therefore, changes in brain temperature represent a physiological reality, which is dependent on metabolic neural activity but is quite different from other traditional measures of neural activity.\n\nOur initial interest in brain thermorecording was initiated by three reasons. First, we thought that brain temperature could be an unexpected factor affecting the results of our early electrochemical studies, in which we tried to assess changes in extracellular dopamine (DA) levels associated with arousing stimuli [32], operant feeding behavior [33] and self-administration of heroin and cocaine [34,35]. While in these experiments we used highly DA-selective carbon-fiber sensors, changes in DA-dependent electrochemical signals showed relatively large tonic increases, which could not be explained by true increases in extracellular DA levels. Second, we know that psychostimulant drugs such as METH and MDMA induce robust body hyperthermia in both rats and humans. Therefore, we were interested in clarifying how these drugs affect brain temperature and in determining the relationships between changes in brain and body temperatures. Finally, we thought that brain thermorecording could provide a simple, sensitive, and integral index for the characterization of alterations in neural activity during motivated behavior. As an initial step to address these issues, we examined whether and how arousing stimuli of different modalities and salience affect brain temperature, what the differences in temperature responses in different brain structures and body locations are, and we sought to clarify the source of these temperature responses.\n\nNeural activation as a source of physiological brain hyperthermia\n\nSince circulation is the primary means of heat exchange between the brain and the rest of the body, it was important to examine the relationships between temperature changes occurring in the brain and in its arterial blood supply. To accomplish this task, rats were chronically implanted with miniature thermocouple sensors in several brain structures (dorsal and ventral striatum, cerebellum) and in the abdominal aorta accessed via the caudal artery [36]. While the carotid artery seems to be the best measurement location, a catheter in this location significantly or fully blocks blood flow, thus resulting in undervalued measurements due to a cooler neck area. In contrast, the presence of a small-diameter catheter with a thermocouple sensor in the abdominal aorta does not result in an evident decrease in blood flow and the measured temperature could only be overvalued because of heat inflow from warmer surroundings (body core). Temperatures were recorded with high temporal resolutions in freely moving rats exposed to several physiologically relevant arousing stimuli (i.e. placement in the experimental cage, an auditory stimulus, social interaction of the recorded male with either a male or female companion, and tail-pinch). All measurements were conducted at stable ambient temperatures (22–23°C) and they were repeated during 5–6 daily sessions.\n\nAs shown in this study, basal temperatures in all of the brain structures were significantly higher than that in the arterial blood (Figure 1). All stimuli increased temperature in each brain structure and in the arterial blood, and these increases greatly exceeded the duration of stimulation. While the response pattern was similar in all locations, temperature increases in all brain structures occurred significantly faster and were greater than those in arterial blood, resulting in a significant increase. When analyzed with high, 2-s time resolution, changes in brain temperature were surprisingly rapid in each structure and for each stimulus, showing increases within the first 10 s and significant levels within 20–30 s from the stimulus onset (Figure 2). In contrast, increases in arterial blood temperature were more delayed. Despite differences in basal temperatures, the temperature response was virtually identical in both the dorsal and ventral striatal sub-divisions, but temperature increases in the cerebellum were more delayed and prolonged following each stimulus. Environmental change – the transfer of the rat from the animal facility and its connection to the recording instruments–induced the largest temperature elevation, ~1.7°C vs. the lowest point occurring later within the session (Figure 1). When analyzed for five repeated sessions, brain temperature increases induced by tail-pinch, male-male, and male-female interactions were relatively stable, but the responses to a short auditory stimulus gradually weakened and completely disappeared by the fifth recording session (Figure 3(a–b)). Following repeated sessions, basal temperature decreased in each of the four recording locations both within a session and between sessions, reflecting animal habituation to the experimental environment. However, relative temperature increases elicited by salient stimuli (as shown for tail-pinch) remained relatively stable and differences between each brain structure and arterial blood always remained positive and relatively similar (Figure 3(c)).\n\nSince the blood supply to the brain is cooler than the brain itself, and brain temperatures rise more quickly and to a greater extent than do arterial blood temperatures in response to all arousing stimuli, intra-brain heat production appears to be the primary cause of functional brain hyperthermia elicited by these stimuli. Intra-brain heat accumulation also depends on heat exchange with arterial blood. Therefore, the increased cerebral blood flow that occurs during neural activation (see below) not only brings oxygen and nutritive substances to the brain tissue, but also removes heat from it. As shown previously, tail-pinch induces an almost two-fold increase in striatal blood flow [37] and this increase is also rapid and greatly exceeds the duration of stimulation. Similar increases in striatal blood flow also occurred during grooming and eating [38], activities consistently associated with brain temperature increases [27,28,39]. Since arterial blood temperature also increases following arousing stimuli, the efficiency of heat outflow from the brain slowly decreases, resulting in more prolonged changes in brain temperature. Hence, brain circulation plays a significant role in the re-distribution of locally released heat within brain tissue and in its removal from the brain, thereby contributing to brain temperature fluctuations occurring under physiological conditions.\n\nWhen we initiated our work with measurements of arterial blood temperature, we thought that these measurements were never conducted before and it appears that they were never done in rats. Further search of literature, however, revealed that arterial blood temperature using carotid artery access was previously recorded in dogs [24], cats [28,29], monkeys [40,41], and free-ranging ostriches and onyx [42,43].\n\nWhile it seems mechanistic, brain-body temperature exchange could be analogous to an internal combustion engine. Similar to the coolant that continuously circulates and removes heat from a working engine, cooler arterial blood removes heat from the brain and delivers the now warmed venous blood to the heart and lungs to be cooled and oxygenated again in the lungs. Therefore, cerebral blood flow is critical for brain temperature homeostasis, and temperatures in the brain and the rest of the body are interdependent. While metabolism-related intra-brain heat production tends to increase brain temperature, temperature also rises when the brain-generated heat cannot be properly dissipated to the body and then to the external environment. Similarly, a decrease in cerebral metabolism tends to lower brain temperature, and this effect can be enhanced by peripheral vasodilatation that promotes heat dissipation to a cooler environment.\n\nDue to technical complexities of temperature recording in arterial blood, in our later studies, in addition to brain sites, we recorded temperature in the temporal muscle, a non-locomotor head muscle that receives the same arterial blood supply as the brain from the carotid artery and thus is exposed to a similar temperature influence of arterial blood. By calculating the difference between temperature changes in a brain site and temporal muscle (brain-muscle differential), the latter influence from the periphery can be excluded, thus revealing the component related to intra-brain heat production. Figure 4 shows that temperature increases in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a ventrally located brain structure critical for sensorimotor integration and a part of motivation-reinforcement circuit [44–46] induced by tail-pinch, social interaction and intraperitoneal (ip) saline injection were consistently more rapid and stronger than those in the temporal muscle resembling the changes seen in arterial blood (compare with Figure 1). Similarly, the NAc-muscle temperature differential rapidly increased at the start of arousing stimulation, paralleling the ascending portion of the temperature curve.\n\nWhile the rise of temperature differential between the brain site and arterial blood or temporal muscle consistently induced by arousing stimuli could provide a measure of brain metabolic activation, a similar change occurs in the brown fat, another factor contributing to body thermogenesis [47,48]. Under normothermic conditions, temperature in brain fat tissue is slightly lower than in body core, but it is consistently increased during environmental cooling and exposure to pyrogens, becoming up to one degree higher than in body core ([49,50]. While heat production in brown fat tissue is an important factor in body hyperthermia during environmental cooling and inflammation-induced fever, its contribution to physiological brain and body hyperthermia appears limited due to small mass of brown fat tissue (0.1–1% in humans [51,52] and less than 1% in rats [53]).\n\nSince brain temperature also depends on peripheral heat loss, to assess the contribution of this factor, we recorded skin temperature by a sensor chronically implanted in the subcutaneous space in frontal facial area, a densely vascularized area with no or minimal metabolic activity of its own. In contrast to brain and muscle sites, skin temperature during tail-pinch and social interaction showed a biphasic fluctuation, with an initial rapid drop followed by a more prolonged tonic increase (Figure 4). Since skin temperature depends on two factors – the tone of blood vessels and temperature of incoming arterial blood – we calculated skin-muscle temperature differentials that allowed us to exclude the contribution of the latter factor and provide an accurate measure of changes in skin vascular tone. Skin-muscle differentials rapidly decreased after the start of arousing stimulation (Figure 4), reflecting peripheral vasoconstriction – a known adaptive response triggered by various stressful stimuli [54–56] and aimed to retain heat under conditions of potential danger. Skin temperature response resulting from vasoconstriction was the most rapid, typically appearing during the first 10–20 s after the start of stimulation and correlating with locomotor activation (Figure 4). It was also the most transient, and it typically inverted into rebound-like skin warming, suggesting enhanced heat dissipation that follows heat retention induced by arousing stimuli. Therefore, skin vasoconstriction that diminishes heat loss to the external environment is another essential contributor to physiological brain hyperthermia.\n\nAs shown in Figure 4, ip injection of saline conducted in wake, quietly resting rats induced a transient hyperthermic response, which was weaker, but qualitatively similar to those elicited by arousing stimuli such as tail-pinch and social interaction. Similar data were also obtained for subcutaneous (sc) saline injection. These findings suggest that the procedure of injection is an arousing stimulus and these temperature changes should be considered when interpreting temperature responses induced by drugs, which are often administered via ip or sc injection.\n\nSince two factors – an increase in intra-brain heat production and decrease in heat loss – determine brain temperature increases induced by arousing stimuli, we used time-dependent correlation to examine relationships between changes in brain temperature and changes in both brain-muscle and skin-muscle differentials. As shown in Figure 5 (left panel), for all three stimuli analyzed, the NAc-muscle differential positively correlated with brain temperature. A significant but much stronger negative correlation was found for brain temperature and the skin-muscle differential, which rapidly decreased within 2–3 min after stimulus onset. Therefore, decreased heat dissipation due to skin vasoconstriction is a stronger factor for brain temperature increases induced by arousing stimuli.\n\nAn important feature of brain and body temperature responses elicited by arousing stimuli is their dependence on basal temperatures (Figure 5, right panel). In each case, temperature increase was large when basal temperature was low, and the increase became gradually weaker when basal temperature was higher. In each case, correlation was significant and regression lines crossed the line of no effect at 38–39°C, suggesting that the response should disappear at high basal temperatures. However, such high temperatures are within the range of physiological fluctuations, occurring, for example, during the rats’ placement in novel environments [58] or during natural copulatory behavior [59] (see below). Importantly, this correlation appears to be valid for any arousing stimulus, reflecting a basic relationship between basal activity state (basal arousal) and its changes induced by environmental stimuli. However, this correlation is quantitatively weaker for stimuli with low activating potential and smaller temperature responses and stronger for powerful stimuli that induce larger temperature elevations. These observations may be viewed as an example of Joseph Wilder’s “law of initial values” that postulates that the magnitude and even direction of autonomic response to an activating stimulus depend on the pre-stimulus basal values [60,61].\n\nAlthough different brain structures show a generally similar pattern of temperature fluctuations following exposure to arousing stimuli, their basal temperatures differ significantly. Specifically, more dorsally located structures have been found to be consistently cooler than more ventrally located structures. While these findings support a dorso-ventral temperature gradient first described in animal brains [26,28,62] and later demonstrated in humans [63–65], the underlying mechanisms of this gradient are still a matter of discussion. It was suggested that higher temperature in more ventrally located structures reflects their farther location from the colder environment and greater heating by warm blood from the body [12,66,67]. However, this assumption, inferred from rectal or core body measurements, was challenged by direct measurements of arterial blood temperatures [29,36,68], which revealed that the brain is always warmer than the arterial blood supply and thus cannot be warmed by arterial blood. Alternatively, a dorso-ventral temperature gradient could be related to differences in metabolic activity, particularly in structure-specific expression of brain uncoupling proteins that regulate uncoupling in mitochondria and local heat production [62]. This temperature differential could also be related to neuronal activity. The great majority of neural cells in the “colder” cortex (>95–98%) are silent at rest, but they are phasically excited following sensory stimulation [69,70]. The same is true for dorsal striatal cells, most of which (at least 90–95%) are electrically inactive in awake, freely moving rats at rest but show phasic stimuli-induced excitations [71,72]. In contrast, most neurons of the “warm” hypothalamus and ventral tegmental area of midbrain are spontaneously active at rest [73,74]. While these data suggest that structure-specific differences in neuronal activity can be a factor determining structure-specific differences in brain temperature, direct neuronal data from different structures in awake animals are very limited and this link cannot be yet substantiated. Finally, it could not be excluded that dorso-ventral brain temperature differential, especially in small animals, may be partially dependent on technical aspects of thermorecording. When the tip of a temperature-sensitive metal probe is not in tight contact with brain tissue or is implanted superficially, heat dissipation from the probe to the external environment may be greater and measured temperatures will be undervalued. Even greater recording errors could occur when temperatures are measured from an open skull.\n\nNeural activation associated with intra-brain heat production appears to be the primary cause for physiological increases in brain temperature, but neural activation also results in increases in cerebral circulation (see [75,76] for review) that enhance heat dissipation from brain tissue. While temperature is usually either omitted from equations relating to metabolism and blood flow or viewed as a passive parameter [77,78], it can also actively affect cerebral blood flow. Direct correlation between temperature and local blood flow was shown in both multiple peripheral tissues (i.e. skin, muscle, intestine, and liver [79–83]; and in the brains of rats, monkeys, and humans [84–86]. Therefore, increases in local brain temperature can be viewed as a factor that enhances cerebral vasodilation and increases local blood flow. This inter-dependent interaction can explain, at least partially, the well-known but not clearly explained phenomenon of greater blood flow increases that exceed the metabolic activity of brain tissue [75]. Due to this mechanism, more oxygen and nutrients are delivered to areas of potential metabolic demand and more potentially dangerous heat is removed from active brain tissue, thus providing a crucial advantage for successful goal-directed behavior and the organism’s adaptation to energy demands.\n\nBrain temperature fluctuations during motivated behaviors\n\nAfter establishing the general pattern of changes in brain temperature elicited by salient sensory stimuli and clarifying their basic mechanisms, we applied multi-point thermorecording to three types of natural motivated behavior (male-female sexual interaction, feeding and drinking behaviors). While our experimental goal was to examine temperature fluctuations associated with critical events and manifestations of each behavior, our general goal was to use these data to understand basic changes in neural activity underlying motivated behaviors.\n\nBrain hyperthermia and phasic temperature fluctuations during male and female sexual behavior\n\nSexual behavior is perhaps the most important type of social interaction and the most coordinated and energy-consuming form of natural goal-directed behavior. It is also a unique behavior that involves interaction of two subjects of the opposite sex. In our experiments, we used multi-site thermorecording to determine common features and between-sex differences in temperature dynamics in sexually experienced male and female rats during exposure to sexually arousing stimuli (smell of an opposite-sex partner and emitted sounds) and subsequent copulatory behavior [59,87]. Recordings were taken from three brain sites: medial preoptic area of hypothalamus (mPOA), a structure implicated in central regulation of both sexual functions [88,89] and thermoregulation [2,4], the NAc, a structure crucial for any motivated behavior [44,90], and the hippocampus (Hippo), a brain structure usually not implicated in central organization of either sexual behavior or thermoregulation. Deep temporal muscle was the fourth recording location, thus enabling us to determine brain-muscle temperature differentials, a means by which metabolic brain activation can be represented (see above). Since this study was historically our first behavioral work with thermorecording and we were limited to the four recording channels, we did not employ skin recordings in this study. We used an identical protocol, which involved the exposure of the recorded, sexually experienced animal (either male or receptive female) to the sexual partner (either receptive female or male). First, the partner was placed into one compartment of a two-compartment chamber with an opaque barrier separating two animals. Then, the opaque barrier was removed but rats remained physically separated from each other by a transparent barrier with holes in it. This allowed limited interaction with the opposite sex partner. Finally, the last barrier was removed and rats initiated sexual behavior, which consisted of 3–5 relatively uniform copulatory cycles. One hour after full cessation of copulatory behavior, the partner was removed from the cage.\n\nFigure 6 shows representative original examples of temperature changes recorded in male and female rats during the entire experiment (left panel) and mean values of temperatures in each recording location during each experimental event of sexual interaction: placement of the rat in the cage at the start of experimentation, stabilization of temperatures 2 h later, presentation of an opposite-sex rat in the neighboring compartment (arousal A1), removal of the opaque barrier separating the animals (arousal A2), each subsequent male’s ejaculation during sexual interaction (E), and removal of the partner from the cage (right panel).\n\nAs can be seen in these figures, sexual interaction in both males and females was accompanied by robust tonic increases and phasic fluctuations in brain and muscle temperature. Relative to the baseline established 2 h after the recorded animal was placed in the cage (habituation), temperatures rapidly increased (+1.5–2.0°C) when the opposite-sex animal was placed into the neighboring compartment, remained tonically elevated (38–39°C) during subsequent sexual interaction, and decreased after its termination. Temperature changes in males and females were surprisingly similar in each of the four recording sites, but elevations in brain structures were larger than those in the temporal muscle, resulting in significant increases in brain-muscle differentials that persisted during the entire period of sexual interaction (Figure 6(c)). The increases in this parameter were strong and almost identical in the mPOA and NAc and lower in the Hippo, and they were maximal at the moment of the male’s first ejaculation (E1 in Figure 6(c)). Similar to the introduction of an opposite-sex partner (A1), removal of the partner was associated with a new temperature increase and a significant rise in the brain-muscle differential (male and female out in Figure 6). Although males and females showed the same between-site differences in temperatures, females had higher basal temperatures in each location after their placement in the cage of previous sexual interaction, and higher basal values than males at the start of arousing stimulation. Because of these differences, female rats showed a weaker relative temperature increases during arousing stimulation and subsequent copulatory behavior than males. Finally, in animals of both sexes, temperature values established after complete cessation of sexual behavior were the minimal points within a session, obviously representing a true quiet resting baseline (zero in Figure 6(b)). With respect to this baseline, temperatures before the start of arousing stimulation were significantly elevated in both males and females and this elevation was larger in females.\n\nRapid time-course analysis provided a more precise picture of rapid temperature fluctuations (Figure 7). In both males and females, temperature rapidly and strongly rose and brain-muscle differentials significantly increased in each recording location after a partner was placed behind a nontransparent barrier, transiently increased again when the first barrier was removed, and slightly increased again after the rats began to interact freely. The NAc showed the shortest onset latencies (10–20 s) and most rapid acceleration of the initial temperature increase, mPOA was slightly less active, and Hippo showed the smallest change (Figure 7C). The longest latency and a minimal increase were seen in the temporal muscle; this increase was preceded by a transient decrease (presumably because of acute vasoconstriction (see [56,91] immediately after the onset of stimulation. The time-course of arousal-related temperature elevation was similar in both sexes, but the magnitude of elevation was larger in males (~1.4°C) than females (~0.9°C), because of higher baseline temperatures in females (see Figure 6).\n\nSimilar to other sensory stimuli, the magnitude of brain temperature elevation elicited by sexually arousing stimuli in both males and females was strongly dependent on basal temperatures (Figure 7(d)). When the temperatures at the start of arousing stimulation were low, the increase was large (1.6–2.2°C), while it was smaller (0.6–0.8°C) when the rat was more active and basal temperatures were higher. This dependence of the response on pre-stimulus baselines may be responsible for between-sex differences in relative amplitude of arousal response (Figure 6), which was stronger in males and weaker in females, which had higher temperatures than the males at the start of arousing stimulation. In animals of both sex regression lines cross the line of no effect at ~38.4°C (Figure 7(d)), suggesting that arousal-related temperature elevation has its natural limits; these values were virtually identical to the tonic temperature plateau that was maintained during copulatory behavior (see Figure 6). This relationship again is consistent with Wilder’s law of initial values [60,61] and appears to be common for any arousing stimulus.\n\nIn contrast to a similar pattern of temperature increases induced by sexually arousing stimuli in males and females, there were between-sex differences in rapid temperature fluctuations associated with the initiation of copulatory behavior (Figure 8(a-b)). In males, temperature increases and a rise in brain-muscle differentials began about 2 min before the first mount or intromission, peaked at the time of this event, and steadily continued during subsequent copulatory behavior. In contrast, brain temperature in females began to increase only after the first sexual contact, sharply accelerating after this event. Interestingly, in males, there were no differences in absolute temperatures and their relative changes between the first mount and intromission, but in females that allowed intromission as the first sexual contact, brain temperatures were significantly higher and brain-muscle differences were larger than those for cases when the copulatory cycle began with a mount. Although an anticipatory temperature elevation that precedes the initial sexual contact supports the known active role of the male rat in sexual interaction, the female’s activity state appears to be an important “permissive” factor determining the type of sexual contact occurring in the males. When females are at lower activity states they allow males to mount, but when their activity state increases they allow intromission. Importantly, successful sexual interaction in rats is possible only when the female is in a state of sexual receptivity, which is associated with higher behavioral activity, higher brain temperatures, and larger brain-muscle differentials than those in a non-receptive state.\n\nIn contrast to monophasic temperature increases triggered by sexually arousing stimuli and occurring following the initial mount/intromission, subsequent copulatory cycles were associated with biphasic temperature fluctuations. These fluctuations were smaller in magnitude (~0.3–0.6°C), peaked around ejaculations, and were superimposed on a tonic elevation that persisted during the entire period of sexual interaction (Figure 8(c–d)). In both males and females, temperature gradually increased during repeated mounts and intromissions, peaked within 1–3 min after ejaculation (zero time), and abruptly decreased to a lower point during post-ejaculatory inactivity from which temperature increased again during the next copulatory cycle (Figure 8(c–d)). Males and females also showed similar structural differences, with maximal and similar temperature fluctuations in the NAc and mPOA, smaller fluctuations in the Hippo, and minimal changes in the muscle. In males, the moment of ejaculation was associated with a dramatic temperature rise that was followed by a strong temperature fall. A similar biphasic change occurred in females, but the increase was more gradual peaking at 2–3 min following male ejaculation (Figure 8(d)). Between-sex differences were also seen in dynamics of brain-muscle differentials (Figure 8(c)). This parameter in males gradually increased and peaked within the last minute preceding ejaculation, but in females, it peaked during the first minute following the male’s ejaculation. While the post-ejaculatory decrease in brain-muscle differentials suggests an abrupt cessation of previous activation, brain temperature continued to increase for about 1 min after ejaculation, during the period when the male rat was in deep hypoactivity (refractory period). Since muscle temperature, in this case, continued to increase for about one more minute after brain temperature began to decline, the brain-muscle differential offered us a view of the actual peak of neuronal activation, which in male rats occurred immediately prior to ejaculation. The first-in-session ejaculation was the point of maximal temperature increase and maximal brain-muscle difference in both males and females. At this point, mPOA temperature ranged between 38.1 and 39.9°C in males and 37.8 and 39.4°C in females. During subsequent copulatory cycles, these values slightly decreased and the post-ejaculatory temperature decrease became more pronounced until the last ejaculation, after which the animals ceased any further sexual activity and temperature decreased toward baseline. Similar biphasic brain temperature fluctuations associated with male ejaculation were also found in the study of Mark Blumberg and collaborates [92]. In this study, mPOA temperature consistently increased during mounts and intromissions, peaked at the minute of ejaculation (38.5–39.5°C), and rapidly dropped within a minute following ejaculation.\n\nThese dynamics of temperature fluctuations found in rats match the results of human physiological studies, which have revealed the most dramatic increases in cardiovascular activity, breathing, and oxygen consumption as occurring preceding male’s ejaculation and rapid decreases in these parameters during post-ejaculatory inactivity [93–101]. Our findings are also consistent with single-unit data obtained in male rats. In the mPOA, >90% of neurons showed sustained excitation, which began after the introduction of a female rat, persisted during the entire period of sexual behavior, and abruptly terminated immediately after ejaculation [102]. In addition, many mPOA neurons showed phasic activations associated with pursuit of the female and rapid transient activations associated with mounts and intromissions.\n\nDespite different roles attributed to each brain structure, the NAc and mPOA showed very similar temperature changes associated with critical events of sexual behavior. In contrast, the Hippo was less active during copulatory behavior, but showed the strongest activation during the second stage of sexual arousal, when rats were engaged in nose-to-nose interactions via holes in the dividing barrier. While these differences could reflect specific functional roles of each structure, intra-brain heat exchange would significantly contribute to a generally similar pattern of between-structure temperature fluctuations. A basic similarity of brain temperature fluctuations found in male and female rats is also consistent with electrophysiological findings. For example, recordings of mPOA neurons in male rats revealed that many of these cells showed mount- and intromission-related excitations, which were superimposed over a profound tonic activation [103,104]. Similar highly phasic changes in neuronal activity at different events of precopulatory and copulatory behavior were obtained in medium spiny NAc neurons [105]. Importantly, a similar pattern of neuronal activity was found in other brain structures, particularly in the lateral midbrain tegmentum [104] – a distinct area with an unclear role in sexual behavior. Microdialysis assessments of NAc dopamine during sexual behavior in male and female rats also mimicked this pattern [106,107] with robust increases during sexual arousal and decreases following ejaculation.\n\nThe pattern of brain temperature fluctuations during copulatory behavior was generally similar during repeated sessions. However, there were also some day-to-day differences. While in control animals placed repeatedly in the same chamber, NAc temperatures stabilized at relatively low baseline levels with a tendency to slightly decrease across days, these changes were slowed and then inverted in sexually experienced rats placed in the cage of previous sexual interaction. Both in males and especially in females, basal NAc temperature before the start of sexual stimulation was higher, with an almost 1.0°C differences from intact control animals. These changes obviously result from conditioned brain activation developed following association of the specific environment with the previous successful copulatory behavior (learning). While in males the diminished habituation to the environment of previous sexual interaction may be explained exclusively by a result of associative learning [108], in females hormonal stimulation used to induce sexual receptivity may be an important contributor to behavioral hyperactivity and higher temperatures at the start of sexual interaction [109].\n\nFeeding behavior\n\nEarly thermorecording studies revealed that feeding behavior is accompanied by an increase in brain temperature, which is evident in different structures and generally correlates with core body temperature [27,28]. Since feeding behavior involves several prerequisites and multiple components (deprivation state, food availability, food-seeking activity, eating), it remains unclear which components of this behavior are associated with brain temperature increases and decreases, what the mechanisms of these changes are, and what the functional significance of these temperature fluctuations is.\n\nTo answer these questions, we developed a simple paradigm of feeding behavior, in which we conducted repeated high-resolution three-point thermorecordings (NAc, temporal muscle, and skin) in the same rats, which were either food-deprived (for 24 h) or satiated, and which exhibited different behaviors depending on food accessibility [39]. Before sensor implantation, rats were pre-trained to consume food from a presented plastic container (that allowed rats to see and smell the food) and only rats that showed consistent eating behavior were used in thermorecording experiments. During temperature recordings, we presented rats with the same food container, which could be either open, allowing the rats to obtain the food (1.5 g of regular food), or closed, not allowing direct contact with the food despite their continuous food-seeking activity. Our goal was to answer the following questions: (1) Whether and how is food deprivation reflected in basal locomotor activity and basal temperatures and how does it affect an animal’s behavioral response to food-related stimuli? (2) What changes in temperature and general locomotor activity occur during eating?(3) How do these changes differ from those occurring during food-seeking activity when the food is inaccessible? Finally, (4) What clues can brain thermorecording data provide to understand the organization and regulation of motivated behavior?\n\nIf an animal is deprived of food, it may be assumed that it differs from a non-deprived animal by its motivational state, which should be reflected in physiological and behavioral parameters. However, comparison of basal temperature and locomotion data from food-deprived and non-deprived rats did not reveal any significant differences, although all values were lower in food-deprived rats. While this may seem surprising, this finding is consistent with other data suggesting that food deprivation (starvation, fasting) slightly decreases whole-body metabolism, resulting in lower spontaneous locomotion and lower brain and muscle temperatures [110–112]. Under these conditions, peripheral vessels are to some extent constricted, resulting in lower skin temperature, thus retaining heat inside of the body by limiting its dissipation to the external environment.\n\nWhen rats were satiated, they usually did not show any specific interest to the presented food container, but food-deprived rats consistently demonstrated food-seeking activity, manifesting as active interaction with the container. When the container was open, rats removed food from the container and consumed it, but when the container was closed, they continued their food-seeking behavior, trying to obtain food from it.\n\nAlthough satiated rats did not actively interact with the presented container, its placement in the cage moderately increased NAc and muscle temperatures, decreased skin temperature, and induced modest locomotor activation (Figure 9(a)). Both locomotion and temperatures increased again when the container was removed from the cage 10 min after its presentation (second vertical line in Figure 9(a)); these secondary increases were clearly weaker than those associated with the container’s presentation. Temperature increases in the NAc were rapider and larger in amplitude than those in the muscle, resulting in a significant rise in the NAc-muscle temperature differential. In contrast, the skin-muscle differential rapidly decreased and was maintained at lower values for about 20 min after container presentation. Similar to temperatures, both differentials showed a small secondary change when the food container was removed from the cage. Therefore, temperature responses elicited by food presentation in satiated rats mimic the pattern of changes induced by other arousing stimuli.\n\nTemperature responses elicited by the presentation of the food container to hungry rats were quite different and depended on the rat’s ability to retrieve food and consume it. While hungry rats always actively interacted with the food container, they rapidly retrieved food from an open container and began eating when container was open but continued to interact with the closed container when they were unable to retrieve food. Presentation of a food container (first vertical line in Figure 9(b,c) in both cases resulted in similar temperature responses: a gradual increase in brain and muscle temperatures, rapid decrease in skin temperature, and a gradual increase in locomotion. Temperatures further increased when the rat retrieved food from the open container and started eating. In this case, muscle temperature showed the most rapid increase, clearly exceeding that in the NAc and skin. These differential changes resulted in a robust decrease in the NAc-muscle and skin-muscle temperature differentials. After eating was completed, temperatures in all recording locations rapidly decreased and both differentials slowly returned to their baselines. Behaviorally, after eating was completed, rats exhibited intensive grooming, washing, and rearing. These changes were significantly greater than those seen in satiated rats, which showed no interest in the food (compare Figure 9(a,b)).\n\nWhen the rat began to interact with the closed container trying to retrieve food, locomotor activation accelerated, and brain and muscle temperatures continued to increase at the same rate; these increases were maintained for some time after the container was removed from the cage (Figure 9(c)). While qualitatively similar, these increases as well as changes in NAc-muscle and skin-muscle differentials were significantly greater and more prolonged than those seen in satiated rats, which showed no interest in food (see Figure 9(a)).\n\nOur data demonstrate that food-deprived animals show noticeably different behavioral and temperature responses to a presented food container than non-deprived animals. While satiated rats showed no interest toward this container along with a weak temperature response, hungry rats always initiated food-seeking activity and showed much stronger changes in temperature and locomotion. Therefore, the same “appetitive” stimulus presented to rats in deprived and non-deprived states differentially affects behavior and temperatures, suggesting that specific environmental stimulation is essential to reveal (actualize) motivational state and induce food-seeking behavior. Despite a smaller amplitude and duration, the initial phase of the temperature and locomotor response induced by the container’s presentation was similar in hungry and satiated conditions, mimicking the response induced by other salient somatosensory stimuli. Therefore, the same food container (a combination of visual and olfactory stimuli) when presented in non-deprived conditions could be defined as a stimulus inducing an arousal response. Therefore, increased arousal (or nonspecific activation) could be viewed as both a precondition for and a correlate of specific motivated behavior.\n\nWhile the initial temperature responses elicited by the food container were similar in all three situations, distinct differences were seen in food-deprived rats depending on food availability. When the container was closed, rats showed sustained food-seeking activity trying to retrieve a food pellet. In this case, NAc and muscle temperature gradually increased in parallel with locomotion, and these increases slowly disappeared after the container was removed from the cage. When the container was open, food-seeking activity rapidly resulted in food consumption that was associated with the second phase of temperature increases that peaked at the time when eating was finished. The rate of temperature increase rapidly grew after the start of eating, was maintained during its entire duration, and sharply dropped when eating was completed. While the NAc-muscle differential increased after the presentation of the container and during food seeking, it began to decrease during eating. While this change suggests rapid cessation of previous metabolic neural activation, the stronger change in temporal muscle temperature could be explained at least in part by heat inflow from mm. masseter, which is located in a close proximity to the temporal muscle and is heavily implicated in chewing. Therefore, a strong temperature increase in the muscle and an increase in the skin temperature (due to increased arterial blood inflow to the head) could be viewed as a consequence of specific muscular activity associated with chewing. However, despite this increased motor activity associated with eating, temperature increases were not related to general locomotion, which was drastically reduced while increases in temperature were maximal. On the other hand, temperatures began to fall after cessation of eating when the rat became hyperactive again, engaging in extensive washing, grooming, and exploratory behavior.\n\nOverall, motivated food-seeking behavior is accompanied by modest brain hyperthermia that results from sustained metabolic neural activation and retention of body heat due to peripheral vasoconstriction. This metabolic neural activation is triggered via somato-sensory pathways and maintained during seeking behavior until successful interaction with the reinforcer (reward = start of food consumption) and its detection by the CNS. While brain temperature continues to increase during food consumption and strong peripheral vasoconstriction appears to be the primary contributor to this effect, metabolic neural activation as reflected by brain-muscle temperature differentials gradually decreases. The end of consumption is related to a rapid decrease in brain temperature and slow restoration of temperatures to their baseline. In addition to rapid “eating-stopping” neural signals from the stomach during food consumption, the brain needs to receive metabolic signals from consumed food to induce satiety and stop eating behavior. If the rat is engaged in food-seeking activity but food remains unavailable, brain hyperthermia coincides with metabolic brain activation and strong, prolonged peripheral vasoconstriction. Therefore, it appears that successful interaction with the reinforcer (food for hungry animals) eventually results in cessation of metabolic neural activation and disappearance of food-seeking behavior, correlating with satisfaction (reward).\n\nDrinking behavior\n\nAs a logical extension of our previous studies on sexual and feeding behavior, thermorecording was used to examine drinking behavior, established by rat’s interaction with another reinforcer – a sweet caloric solution [113]. In contrast to food that is reinforcing only for hungry animals (state-dependent reinforcer), sweet solution is a state-independent reinforcer, and rats rapidly learn to consume sweet drinks without any food or water deprivation. As a sweet substance, we used caffeine-free Coca-Cola Classic® or Coke® (11% sugar content). Before surgeries, rats were pre-trained to consume a 5-ml portion of this drunk presented in a cup and our temperature recordings were conducted in well-trained rats, which consistently consumed Coke solution. Our primary goal was to examine the pattern of central and peripheral temperature fluctuations and locomotor activity associated with different aspects of motivated Coke-drinking behavior and its variants associated with changes in the animals’ motivational state (hunger vs. satiety) and the nature of the reinforcer (water or Diet Coke vs. regular Coke). Based on these data, our general goal was to learn more about basic mechanisms underlying motivated appetitive behavior.\n\nWhen analyzed with slow (1-min) time-resolution, free-drinking behavior was associated with a typical triad of temperature changes coupled with increased locomotion (Figure 10(a)). Brain and muscle temperatures began to increase after the Coke-containing cup was presented to the rat and the rat initiated seeking behavior, further increased during drinking and showed the largest increase during the post-drinking period. In contrast, skin temperature rapidly decreased after cup presentation, reached its nadir at the end of drinking, and slowly returned to baseline thereafter. Locomotion rapidly increased after cup presentation, relatively decreased during drinking, and more tonically increased during the post-consumption period.\n\nMore complex temperature dynamics were found when data were analyzed with high (5-s) time resolution (Figure 10(b)) with respect to three key events of motivated drinking behavior: cup presentation, initiation of drinking, and its completion. As can be seen, NAc temperature began to increase rapidly following full cup presentation, becoming statistically significant at 10–15 s. This increase continued gradually until the rat initiated drinking, but began to decrease during drinking. In contrast to the NAc, muscle temperature virtually did not change during cup presentation and before the initiation of drinking, slightly increased during drinking, and continued to increase slowly but gradually during the post-drinking behavioral activation. Due to these differences, NAc-muscle differentials rapidly increased during seeking behavior, peaked at the moment when the rat began drinking, and gradually decreased during drinking. Finally, NAc temperatures and NAc-muscle differentials began to increase again after drinking was finished and continued increasing during the post-drinking behavioral activation. In contrast to the NAc and muscle, skin temperature decreased sharply after cup presentation. This rapid decrease weakened during drinking, became stronger again at the end of drinking, but then inverted into a weaker increase from 25 to 30 s after the end of drinking. Due to these differences, skin-muscle differentials decreased rapidly and strongly following cup presentation, continued to decrease at a slower rate during drinking, and remained at relatively stable low levels for some time after the end of drinking.\n\nAfter establishing the basic pattern of temperature changes associated with motivated drinking behavior, we examined how this pattern would change after substitution of the reinforcer (presentation of Diet-Coke and water). When rats with previous experience of Coke drinking were presented with a cup with an equal amount of Diet Coke, a Coke substitute with no caloric value, they first made an attempt to drink it with the same latencies as they did with the Coke in control conditions. While the rats always tasted Diet-Coke and consumed it a little, in no case did rats consumed it entirely. These attempts continued for up to 30–40 min and they were associated with a larger brain temperature elevations and larger increases in locomotor activity than in control conditions with regular Coke. In contrast to relative decreases in NAc and muscle temperatures seen during Coke consumption, this transient effect was absent during Diet-Coke tasting and both temperatures continued to grow rapidly when the rats repeatedly tried to drink it.\n\nSimilar changes in temperature dynamics occurred when the rats with previous experience of Coke consumption were presented with an equal amount of water. While the rats interacted with the cup with similar latencies and made several attempts to drink water, in no case did they consume it to a significant extent. These attempts continued for up to 20–30 min and were associated with larger temperature increases and stronger locomotor activation. In contrast to temperature decreases during Coke consumption, NAc and muscle temperatures continued to increase rapidly when the rats tasted water, and the increase was stronger than the changes in the control conditions.\n\nFinally, we examined how the pattern of temperature changes associated with Coke consumption would change in hungry rats. After a Coke-containing cup was presented to rats after 24-h food deprivation, hungry rats rapidly initiated drinking, with significantly decreased latencies but for equal duration of time. In contrast to the control conditions, Coke presentation in hungry conditions induced stronger drinking-related decrease sin NAc temperature that resulted in its weaker mean increase compared to the control.\n\nMotivated drinking behavior: Appetitive stimulus, arousal, and motivation\n\nPresentation of a Coke-containing cup to an experienced rat results, with a certain variable latency, in initiation of drinking behavior. The same appetitive stimulus also induces locomotor activation and a typical triad of changes in central and peripheral temperatures: increases in brain and muscle temperatures, quicker and stronger temperature acceleration in the brain vs. muscle, and an ultra-fast and profound decrease in skin temperature. However, the same immediate response also occurred when the presented cup contained water or Diet Coke, which resulted in tasting of these beverages with the same range of latencies. Since these changes not only followed a stimulus presentation but also preceded the initiation of drinking (see Figure 10(b)), they could be viewed as a correlate of motivation, a driving force for this seeking behavior. However, as shown above, the same temperature response coupled with locomotor activation occurs in naive rats when exposed to various arousing somatosensory stimuli. Therefore, increased arousal (or a generalized neural activation) could be viewed as both a pre-condition for and a correlate of seeking aspects of motivated behavior (motivated search).\n\nWhen Coke was substituted with Diet Coke or water, rats tasted the presented drink with the same onset latencies, but did not consume it. While NAc temperatures during these tests showed the same rapid increase until the first drinking attempt, there was no subsequent temperature decrease as had occurred during drinking of regular Coke. In contrast, temperatures continue to increase gradually, peaking at ~15–30 min after cup presentation. Therefore, the inability to obtain expected Coke (or to satisfy existing motivation, i.e. no reward) is associated with sustained neural activation, enhanced intra-brain heat production, and heat accumulation in the brain, manifesting at the behavioral level as a continuous searching activity.\n\nSearching activity coupled with strong increases in NAc temperature and NAc-muscle temperature differentials also occurred after the rats finished Coke consumption and made multiple returns to the empty cup, trying to lick out all remaining drops of liquid. Therefore, the second peak of post-consumption neural activation (which is reflected most clearly in the NAc-muscle differentials) could be related to the reappearance of a motivated search that dissipated slowly over time because of the inability to satisfy this motivation. As shown previously [114], trained rats are able to consume much larger volumes of sugary drinks (up to 30 ml of equally caloric 10% glucose), suggesting that the presented 5-ml drink is unable to satisfy them. Although the post-drinking increases in brain and muscle temperatures are larger in amplitude than those occurring before drinking, this difference results from a variation in time intervals. While trained rats began drinking within a relatively short time interval after the presentation of a Coke-filled cup, hyperactivity and search after emptying the cup continued for much longer (5–15 min), resulting in larger absolute temperature increases despite a slower acceleration (see Figure 10(b)). While the rate of NAc temperature increase immediately after emptying the cup was about the same as before the start of drinking, it weakened gradually within the next several minutes until it inverted into a gradual decrease that slowly returned temperatures from their peaks to their baseline levels. At this stage, animals ceased searching and locomotor activity.\n\nMotivated drinking behavior: Consumption and reward\n\nWhile NAc temperatures gradually increased during searching activity preceding the initiation of Coke drinking, temperature dynamics rapidly changed after drinking began. Although absolute temperature still increased during the first 25–30 s of Coke consumption, the rate of increase dropped within the first 5 s and then inverted into a decrease, resulting in an overall decrease in brain temperatures vs. their values at the start of drinking. Taking into account the link between neural activation and intra-brain heat production, these data suggest that Coke consumption is associated with rapid cessation of preceding neural activation. However, if Coke consumption in experienced rats is viewed as a rewarding event, this rapid change could be viewed as its neural correlate. On the other hand, this change could be viewed as a correlate of the consummatory (satisfying) phase of motivated behavior, which follows its activation-related seeking phase. Despite differences in conceptual interpretation, the surprisingly rapid inversion of NAc temperature dynamics following initiation of drinking suggests that sensory stimulation associated with Coke consumption, not the metabolic consequences of consumed sugars, is the primary factor underlying this change. As shown previously through direct monitoring of brain glucose [115], much more time is needed for sugars to be absorbed from the stomach and affect brain activity. Therefore, this change could also be viewed as a correlate of sensory or “hedonic” but not metabolic reward [116].\n\nCommon features of temperature dynamics during different forms of motivated behavior\n\nDespite differences in the nature of the reinforcer (food for food-deprived animals, palatable sugary drink, sexual partner) and experimental protocol, there were some common features of brain temperature fluctuations for all three types of examined motivated behavior. In each case, brain temperature rapidly increased in trained rats following the presentation of the reinforcer (food container, Coke-containing cup, sensory signals from receptive female or male) that triggers searching activity. The rate of temperature increases was similar for each reinforcer, but their amplitudes greatly varied for each reinforcer due to differences in experimental paradigms and elicited behavior. Trained rats began drinking within ~1 min after cup presentation and absolute temperature increases were relatively small, but temperatures increased up to 1.5–2.0°C when sexually experienced males were able to see and perceive the receptive female for 20 min, but were unable to interact directly with her. Therefore, an increase in brain temperature with increased brain-muscle differentials, common for all three types of motivated behavior can be viewed as a correlate of searching behavior that is triggered in trained rats by sensory stimuli emitted by the presented reinforcing object. This searching behavior results in direct interaction with the reinforcer – either drinking, eating, or the sequence of mounts and intromissions culminating in ejaculation. In contrast to intact, untrained rats, which showed progressive habituation following repeated exposure to the same testing environment, delayed and weaker habituation was typical of trained animals, which had higher basal brain temperatures and locomotor activity at the start of the behavioral experiment. These changes were seen with each model of motivated behavior but were especially strong with sexual behavior. Therefore, conditioning appears to be another contributor to the dynamics of brain temperature fluctuations during natural motivated behaviors.\n\nDespite certain differences in each model of motivated behavior, brain temperature and brain-muscle differentials began to decrease during interaction with the reinforcing objects, suggesting the cessation of previous metabolic neural activation. This change was rapid and most evident during consumption of a sugary drink (see Figure 10(b)), suggesting that sensory stimulation associated with Coke consumption appears to be a true rewarding event. While this decrease continued until the end of drinking, it rapidly inverted into an increase when the cup became empty and the rat reinitiated searching behavior. During sexual behavior, brain temperature was gradually increased by sexually arousing stimuli and further increased during repeated mounts and intromissions, sharply peaking at ejaculation. After this event, the male’s motor activity decreased rapidly and brain temperatures dropped sharply, with a profound decrease in brain-muscle differentials. In contrast to Coke-drinking behavior, where sensory stimulation associated with the drinking of a sugary substance appears to be a rewarding event that rapidly changes brain temperature dynamics, neural activation triggered by sexually relevant stimuli persists during the entire copulatory behavior, with ejaculation being an acute rewarding event or a “true” satisfier of this motivated behavior. Importantly, the same biphasic changes in brain temperature and brain-muscle differentials also occurred in female rats. However, peak of neural activation in females occurred within a minute after the rat received the male’s ejaculate and this appears to be a true rewarding event for the female. Although brain temperature increased during food consumption, this increase was also coupled with a gradual decrease in brain-muscle differentials, suggesting consumption per se as also being a true rewarding event for feeding behavior. Importantly, this reward-related change was absent when the food-container was closed and the rat was unable to retrieve the food. Therefore, it appears that different motivated behaviors, despite different manifestations, share some common basic patterns of alterations in metabolic brain activity associated with critical behavioral events.\n\nBrain hypothermia associated with general anesthesia: Underlying mechanisms\n\nIt is well known that general anesthesia is associated with a robust decrease in body temperature and impairment of temperature regulation, making an organism more sensitive to external temperature influences [117,118]. To counteract this impairment and prevent hypothermia, anesthesia is usually supplemented by body warming, thus opposing the temperature-depressing effects of general anesthetics and helping to maintain temperatures within their physiological limits. We found that general anesthesia induced by sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, ip) administered to awake, quietly resting rats in standard ambient temperatures (22°C) causes robust brain hypothermia (>4°C below baseline) as assessed in the mPOA [119] (Figure 11(a)). Temperatures in the body core and skin also decreased, but temperature decreases in the brain were stronger than in the body core, resulting in a significant drop in mPOA-body temperature differentials (Figure 11(b)) – indicative of brain metabolic inhibition. The temperature decrease in the skin was weaker than in the body core, resulting in a robust rise in skin-body differentials (Figure 11(b)), indicating skin vasodilation. Therefore, during general anesthesia, the brain becomes relatively cooler and skin relatively warmer than the body core. While the observed brain temperature decreases reflect the known inhibiting effect of pentobarbital on brain metabolism and intra-brain heat production [120,121], skin temperature increases indicate peripheral vasodilatation that enhances heat loss to the external environment. Therefore, two basic mechanisms–diminished intra-cerebral heat production and increased heat loss to the cooler external environment–are responsible for brain hypothermia induced by pentobarbital.\n\nWe also examined how the basic pattern of central and peripheral temperature responses induced by pentobarbital changes when the drug is administered to rats that have their bodies passively warmed (Figure 11(c)). In this case, decreases in brain, body core and skin temperature were much smaller, but passive body warming was unable to reverse the decreases in brain-body core temperature differentials, which were stronger and more prolonged than in conditions with no body warming (Figure 11(d)). Although body warming effectively counteracts heat loss to the external environment and attenuates pentobarbital-induced brain hypothermia, the brain remains metabolically inhibited under these conditions and its temperature remains relatively lower than in the body core.\n\nSelective brain cooling during general anesthesia could explain the differences in brain and body temperatures reported in different studies. While in awake monkeys and human patients brain temperatures in different locations are similar or slightly higher than body temperature [30,122–124], these relationships become inverted during anesthesia. In cats under halothane and pentobarbital anesthesia with body warming cortical tissue was 1.0 and 1.8°C colder, respectively, than the body core [68]. Similar negative brain-body differentials were found during pentobarbital anesthesia in dogs [125], urethane anesthesia in rats [67], and anesthesia induced by alpha-chloralose and chloral hydrate anesthesia in rats [126]. During urethane anesthesia without body warming, the temperature difference between the Hippo and rectum was about 4.2°C [67], and during chloralose anesthesia with body warming the difference between the cortex and body core reached 4.3°C [126]. In contrast to our study, which employed chronically implanted temperature sensors, these evaluations were assessed in experiments utilizing acutely implanted metal electrodes, which were not properly thermo-insulated and often with an open skull. These experimental conditions result in undervalued brain temperatures, and the measurement mistake could be especially large in smaller animals (i.e. mice and rats) and for superficial recording sites.\n\nAs shown above, the positive brain-arterial blood temperature difference assessed in animals is maintained under different conditions and becomes larger (because of metabolic brain activation) following exposure to various environmental challenges [36]. Temperature of arterial blood is also consistently lower than that in brain venous outflow in human volunteers tested under various conditions, including vigorous exercise in a warm, humid environment [86]. While these data suggest that heat generated in the periphery cannot be delivered to the brain under physiological conditions, the direction of heat exchange between the brain and rest of the body can be altered during general anesthesia, especially when it is combined with passive body warming. Under these conditions, temperatures in brain sites decrease to a greater extent than in the body core due to metabolic brain inhibition, while body core and arterial blood temperatures become warmer than those in brain tissue due to external body warming. As a result of these two opposing influences, during general anesthesia, the metabolically inhibited brain remains cooler than the externally warmed body, and arterial blood becomes the primary means of brain warming.\n\nTo clarify this point, we conducted a similar experiment with pentobarbital, but instead of the body core, we monitored arterial blood temperature by using a miniature sensor chronically implanted into the abdominal aorta via caudal artery. As can be seen in Figure 12, mPOA temperature before the injection of pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, ip) was ~0.5°C higher than that in arterial blood. Consistent with our previous work, this difference phasically increased during tail-pinch and social interaction but strongly decreased during anesthesia. However, even at the lowest point, this difference remained positive. In contrast, the Hippo-arterial blood difference was minimal before pentobarbital injection and became negative during anesthesia. Therefore, we cannot exclude that under these physiologically unusual conditions, heat could be transferred to the brain from the periphery.\n\nTherefore, in addition to the direct action of anesthetic drugs on neural cells and a dramatic change in afferent inputs during general anesthesia, brain hypothermia can significantly confound the results of neuronal and neurochemical studies conducted in anesthetized animal preparations. While body warming during general anesthesia could effectively compensate for drug-induced body hypothermia, it is unable to fully compensate for brain hypothermia. Furthermore, external body warming during anesthesia may invert the normal direction of heat exchange between the brain and arterial blood, thus affecting various metabolic and blood flow parameters. For this reason, work conducted in such preparations as well as in brain slices maintained at room temperatures (23°C) can produce an obscured, distorted view of the active brain.\n\nBrain temperature as a factor affecting neural activity, brain structure, and functions\n\nPhysiological changes in brain temperature can be considered from two different standpoints. From one standpoint, temperature changes can be viewed as transient alterations of brain temperature homeostasis that are triggered by neural activation and result from intra-brain heat production and decreased heat dissipation from brain tissue. According to this view, brain temperature is an important physiological parameter, which can provide information on changes in brain metabolic activity occurring during different motivated behaviors. However, according to another standpoint, changes in brain temperature can be viewed as a factor that directly affects different forms of neuronal activity, multiple neurophysiological and neurochemical evaluations, and structural integrity of brain cells. It is well known that most physical and chemical processes governing neural activity are temperature-dependent, with the averaged Van’t Hoff coefficient Q10 = 2.3 (i.e. doubling with a 10°C change [127]. However, in vitro studies revealed that temperature dependence greatly varies depending on the specific neural parameters, the type of cells being studied, and the nature of afferent inputs involved in mediating neural responses [128–131]. These studies also confirmed the classic view that synaptic transmission is more temperature-dependent than the generation of action potentials [132].\n\nClassic views on regulation of body temperature consider temperature-sensitive neurons located in the preoptic/anterior hypothalamus as primary central temperature sensors [133–135]. However, cells in many other structures also exhibit a high degree of temperature sensitivity, which is often similar or greater than that in hypothalamic neurons. For example, 22% of medial thalamic neurons have a positive thermal coefficient >0.8 imp/s/°C [136], exceeding the number of temperature-sensitive cells in the anterior (8%) and posterior (11.5%) hypothalamus. In the superchiasmatic nucleus, ~18% of neurons are warm-sensitive [137], while >70% decrease their activity rate with cooling below physiological baseline (37–25°C) [138]. Finally, high temperature sensitivity was found in electrophysiologically identified substantia nigra DA neurons in vitro [139]. Within the physiological range (35–39°C), their discharge rate increases with warming (Q10 = 3.7) and dramatically decreases (Q10 = 8.5) with cooling below this range (34–29°C). This latter finding questions the validity of basal electrophysiological properties and responses of DA neurons studied in vitro at low, non-physiological temperatures. When studied in awake, freely moving conditions, this neuronal population is much more heterogeneous with multiple subgroups that are not apparent in assessments made in brain slices and anesthetized animal preparations [73].\n\nThe high temperature dependence of various neural parameters, ranging from the activity of single ionic channels to transmitter release and uptake has important implications. Although in vitro experiments permit individual cells to be studied and individual components of neural activity and synaptic transmission to be separated, neural cells in the living brain are interconnected and their integral changes should be different from those of individual components assessed in vitro. For example, temperature-dependent increases in transmitter uptake should compensate for temperature-dependent increases in transmitter release. By increasing both release and uptake, however, brain hyperthermia makes neurotransmission more efficient (but at higher energetic cost) and neural functions more effective at reaching behavioral goals. Therefore, changes in temperature may play an important integrative role, involving and uniting numerous central neurons within the brain.\n\nHowever, temperature increases or decreases exceeding physiological range (35–39°C) can adversely affect brain cells and neural functions. While brain cells seem to tolerate low temperatures well [140,141], multiple in vitro studies suggest that high temperature (>40.0°C) has destructive effects on various types of brain cells [128,142–147]. Rapid damage to brain cells has been also documented during acute METH intoxication [148,149], which induces robust brain hyperthermia [150]. METH intoxication has also been associated with increased permeability of the BBB, resulting in vasogenic edema [148,151], which can often result in animal death. The integrity of the BBB has also been shown to be compromised during opiate withdrawal [152], intense physical exercise in a warm environment [153], and during restraint and forced-swim stress [154–156] – conditions associated with brain hyperthermia [86,157].\n\nTo clarify the role of brain temperature in modulating BBB permeability and subsequent changes in neural parameters, it is essential to delineate this physical factor from other possible contributors. To achieve this goal, we examined several brain parameters in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats, whose bodies were passively warmed to produce different levels of brain temperature, which was monitored by chronically implanted thermocouple probes. As shown above, sodium pentobarbital administered at a typical anesthetic dose (50 mg/kg, ip) under standard ambient temperatures (23°C) and without body warming induces robust brain and body hypothermia (~31–33°C). Due to the latter effect, anesthetized rats became very sensitive to environmental temperatures, becoming hypothermic at low ambient temperatures and hyperthermic when their bodies were warmed. Therefore, through changing the intensity of body warming, we were able to induce a wide range of brain temperatures (measured in the NAc) from very low, hypothermic (>32°C) to very high, hyperthermic (<42°C). This paradigm was used to evaluate the role of brain temperature as a factor affecting BBB permeability, brain tissue water balance, and development of acute morphological abnormalities of brain cells [158]. The brains were taken at the same time after the start of anesthesia (90 min) and the initiation of body warming, but at different levels of brain temperature (32–42.5°C) and analyzed for several brain parameters.\n\nTo evaluate the integrity of the BBB we utilized immunohistochemistry for endogenous albumin, a relatively large plasma protein that is normally confined to the luminal side of the endothelial cells and is not present in the brain tissue. Thus, the appearance of albumin-positive cells and albumin immunoreactivity in the neuropil indicates a breakdown of the BBB. We also examined expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an index of astrocytic activation [152,159], as well as the changes in tissue water content and the presence of morphologically abnormal cells as assessed through traditional staining techniques.\n\nAs shown in Figure 13(a), the number of albumin-positive cells assessed in four brain structures (hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, cortex) is strongly dependent on brain temperature, being minimal at normothermic values (34.2–38.0°C), slightly higher (2-4-fold) at hypothermic values (34.2–32.2°C), and dramatically higher (~26-fold) at hyperthermic values (38.0–42.5°C). The increase was evident from ~39°C, progressed at higher temperatures, and plateaued at high levels at 41–42°C. Despite a similar trend in each structure, there were some structural differences in albumin immunoreactivity, with maximal values in the thalamus and hippocampus. Certain differences in albumin immunoreactivity were also found in different cortical areas, with the strongest changes in the piriform cortex – a ventrally located cortical area with the highest temperature (Figure 13(b)). In this structure, the number of albumin-positive cells at low brain temperatures was clearly higher than those at a normal temperature range.\n\nThe number of GFAP-positive cells, indicative of acute glial activation, was also directly dependent on brain temperature (Figure 13(c,d)), but changes were less pronounced than those for albumin. Similarly, the largest number of GFAP-positive cells was found in the thalamus. Only sporadic GFAP-positive cells were found in most cortical areas at low and normal temperatures, but their numbers grew at higher temperatures. Similar to albumin, the largest number of GFAP-immunoreactive cells was found in the piriform cortex and these numbers were higher at low vs. normal temperatures. Finally, we assessed the relationship between brain temperature and the incidence of structurally abnormal cells (Figure 13(e, f)). In this case, only a few abnormal cells were found in all brain structures at low and physiological temperatures, but their numbers were clearly larger at high temperatures. Among the structures tested, the largest change was found in the thalamus, and the piriform cortex clearly differed from other cortical areas, showing an unusually high number of abnormal cells at very low temperatures.\n\nIt is well established that leakage of the BBB results in robust alterations in brain ionic balance and increased water accumulation in brain tissue [160,161]. As shown in this study, tissue water content (evaluated in the cortex and thalamus) was also strongly dependent on brain temperature (Figure 14). Water content in cortical tissue was lowest during hypothermia, significantly higher during normothermia, and maximal during hyperthermia. Within the range of recorded temperatures, cortical water differed within ~4%. In the thalamus, water content was highest during hyperthermia, but values at low and normal temperatures were virtually identical. Cortical water content in anesthetized rats passively warmed to “normal” temperatures was similar to that in awake control conditions (see blue and red dotted lines), but significantly higher (edema) in rats warmed to hyperthermia and significantly lower (dehydration) in those with very low temperatures. A similar trend was found in the thalamus, where water content during anesthesia was lower than in awake controls at low and moderate brain temperatures and similar to control at high temperatures. Considering the entire range of brain temperature values, water content was directly and strongly dependent on brain temperature in both the thalamus and cortex; the correlation was equally strong in both locations.\n\nAfter assessing the temperature dependence of several neural parameters, we examined their relationships in two brain structures: the thalamus and cortex (Figure 15). As can be seen, the number of albumin-positive cells directly correlated with the number of GFAP-positive cells, suggesting tight relationships between temperature-dependent leakage of the BBB and acute glial activation (Figure 15(a)). However, the change was quantitatively larger for GFAP-positive cells, as their numbers were higher at low temperatures when only a few albumin-positive cells were found. The numbers of albumin-positive cells and tissue water content were also closely interrelated in both structures (Figure 15(b)), suggesting that leakage of the BBB is associated with water accumulation in brain tissue. This correlation was almost linear in the thalamus, but some divergence was found in the cortex at temperatures that correspond to extreme hypothermia. Despite the presence of a few albumin-positive cells, cortical water was relatively low, suggesting that the tight correlation between brain albumin and water, which exists within the entire range of normal and high temperatures, could be distorted at very low temperatures. Therefore, it appears that not only extreme hyperthermia but also extreme hypothermia result in BBB leakage, but “hypothermic” brains appear to be dehydrated compared to “normothermic” brains taken from both awake and anesthetized animals at normal temperatures. It is unclear, however, whether these disturbances in water homeostasis are related to hypothermia per se or to pentobarbital’s inhibiting effects on metabolism [120,162]. As shown above, temperature in deep brain structures never drops below 34–35°C under any physiological conditions and such extreme hypothermia can only be seen during general anesthesia, near-lethal environmental temperature drops, or overdose with powerful sedative drugs.\n\nStrong temperature dependence was also found with respect to leakage of the BBB and the appearance of morphologically abnormal cells (Figure 15(c)). In both the cortex and thalamus, structural cell abnormalities were absent at low and normal temperature, but their numbers linearly increased during hyperthermia. Finally,"
