        "text": "While Chicago has been dubbed 'The Windy City', it seems there are three Texas cites that are windier, according to The Weather Station Experts who released the latest results for 2023.\n\nHere in Texas, you never know how windy it's going to be and from which direction the wind will be blowing on any given day. Many places in the Lone Star State are flat, which is one of many reasons the wind blows like crazy here.\n\nThe Weather Station Experts put this list together based on the latest wind speed data from NOAA. Check out what three Texas cities made the top 10 and what their average wind speeds are.\n\nWindiest Cities in the United States\n\nAs you can see from this list, three Texas cities cracked the top ten. The Weather Station Experts explain why it's so windy in the Lone Star State:\n\nAs westerly winds flow over the Rocky Mountains, low-pressure forms to the east of the mountains in the high plains. This very persistent low pressure is what leads to the strong average wind speeds from the southwest and west. Lubbock sits on Llano Estacado, a region on the Western High Plains. A combination of its higher elevation and long stretches of flat land where wind can blow unimpeded there. Abilene sits east of these two Texas cities and experiences the same higher winds — although perhaps less intense — as Amarillo and Lubbock. (via The Weather Station Experts)\n\nWith three cities in the top 10, it's safe to say wearing a kilt or a toupee in Texas might be a bit risky. You've been warned."
