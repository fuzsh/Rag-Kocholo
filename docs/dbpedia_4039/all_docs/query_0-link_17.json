In Llano, the chance of a wet day over the course of July is decreasing, starting the month at 21% and ending it at 15%.\n\nFor reference, the year's highest daily chance of a wet day is 35% on May 26, and its lowest chance is 13% on December 31.\n\nRainfall\n\nTo show variation within the month and not just the monthly total, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day.\n\nThe average sliding 31-day rainfall during July in Llano is decreasing, starting the month at 2.2 inches, when it rarely exceeds 4.6 inches or falls below 0.4 inches, and ending the month at 1.2 inches, when it rarely exceeds 2.9 inches or falls below 0.1 inches.\n\nThe lowest average 31-day accumulation is 1.2 inches on July 31.\n\nSun\n\nOver the course of July in Llano, the length of the day is gradually decreasing. From the start to the end of the month, the length of the day decreases by 29 minutes, implying an average daily decrease of 57 seconds, and weekly decrease of 6 minutes, 41 seconds.\n\nThe shortest day of the month is July 31, with 13 hours, 37 minutes of daylight and the longest day is July 1, with 14 hours, 6 minutes of daylight.\n\nThe earliest sunrise of the month in Llano is 6:35 AM on July 1 and the latest sunrise is 17 minutes later at 6:52 AM on July 31.\n\nThe latest sunset is 8:41 PM on July 1 and the earliest sunset is 12 minutes earlier at 8:29 PM on July 31.\n\nDaylight saving time is observed in Llano during 2024, but it neither starts nor ends during July, so the entire month is in standard time.\n\nFor reference, on June 20, the longest day of the year, the Sun rises at 6:32 AM and sets 14 hours, 9 minutes later, at 8:40 PM, while on December 21, the shortest day of the year, it rises at 7:28 AM and sets 10 hours, 9 minutes later, at 5:37 PM.\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of the sun's elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon) and azimuth (its compass bearing) for every hour of every day in the reporting period. The horizontal axis is the day of the year and the vertical axis is the hour of the day. For a given day and hour of that day, the background color indicates the azimuth of the sun at that moment. The black isolines are contours of constant solar elevation.\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in July in Llano\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in July in LlanoJul112233445566778899101011111212131314141515161617171818191920202121222223232424252526262727282829293030313112 AM12 AM2 AM2 AM4 AM4 AM6 AM6 AM8 AM8 AM10 AM10 AM12 PM12 PM2 PM2 PM4 PM4 PM6 PM6 PM8 PM8 PM10 PM10 PM12 AM12 AMJunAug001010202020303040405050506060707080800001010202030303040405050606060707080NowNow\n\nnortheastsouthwest\n\nMoon\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of key lunar data for July 2024. The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the colored areas indicate when the moon is above the horizon. The vertical gray bars (new Moons) and blue bars (full Moons) indicate key Moon phases.

Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Llano is decreasing during July, falling from 78% to 69% over the course of the month.\n\nFor reference, on June 22, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 79% of the time, while on January 24, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 1% of the time.\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in July in Llano\n\ndry 55Â°F comfortable 60Â°F humid 65Â°F muggy 70Â°F oppressive 75Â°F miserable\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Llano is gradually decreasing during July, decreasing from 10.1 miles per hour to 9.3 miles per hour over the course of the month.\n\nFor reference, on April 1, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 11.7 miles per hour, while on September 4, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 8.5 miles per hour.\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in Llano throughout July is predominantly from the south, with a peak proportion of 79% on July 13.\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season in Llano typically lasts for 8.0 months (245 days), from around March 14 to around November 15, rarely starting before February 19 or after April 8, and rarely ending before October 25 or after December 4.\n\nThe month of July in Llano is reliably fully within the growing season.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in July in Llano\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in July in Llanogrowing seasongrowing seasongrowing seasonJul11223344556677889910101111121213131414151516161717181819192020212122222323242425252626272728282929303031310%100%10%90%20%80%30%70%40%60%50%50%60%40%70%30%80%20%90%10%100%0%JunAug100%Jul 16100%Jul 16NowNowcomfortablewarmhotswelteringcool\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Llano are very rapidly increasing during July, increasing by 940Â°F, from 2,887Â°F to 3,827Â°F, over the course of the month.\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Llano is essentially constant during July, remaining within 0.2 kWh of 7.0 kWh throughout.\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Llano are 30.759 deg latitude, -98.675 deg longitude, and 1,030 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Llano contains only modest variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 285 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 1,060 feet. Within 10 miles contains only modest variations in elevation (906 feet). Within 50 miles also contains very significant variations in elevation (1,611 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Llano is covered by grassland (46%) and shrubs (43%), within 10 miles by grassland (48%) and shrubs (45%), and within 50 miles by shrubs (44%) and grassland (41%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Llano, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 3 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Llano.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Llano according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Llano is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Llano and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nLlano Municipal Airport (KAQO, 96%, 1.9 mi, northeast, 69 ft elevation change)\n\nHorseshoe Bay Resort Airport (KDZB, 2.8%, 24 mi, southeast, 62 ft elevation change)\n\nGillespie County Airport (KT82, 1.3%, 38 mi, south, 663 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Llano and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
