        "text": "We spent one night camping at a small oasis in central Texas this week. Despite the temperature reaching 105-degrees in the afternoon, we thoroughly enjoyed our time at Krause (pronounced krau-see) Springs.\n\nLocated in Spicewood, Texas, just outside the Austin metro area, Krause Springs is operated by the Krause family, which has owned the property for more than 50 years, according to their website. This 115-acre property is open for day use and overnight camping. There are 24 RV sites with electricity, water and a picnic table, and an abundant number of tent-only sites in three large sections of the property. All campers have access to two bathhouses with toilets and showers. Visitors can swim in a 68-degree-spring-fed, developed pool, as well as in a natural pool that has formed at the bottom of a waterfall that leads to a creek feeding into Lake Travis. There is also a butterfly garden near the main entrance filled with abundant plants, several sitting / lounging areas, as well as multiple wind chimes and fountains. Other amenities include benches, picnic tables and covered pavilions throughout the property, as well as a volleyball court near the parking area. You can click on any of the images below to view them larger.\n\nMy wife and son first visited Krause Springs in June during the Texas Trail Running Festival organized by Tejas Trails. My son ran a one-mile kid’s race, and the two of them spent some time exploring the property and enjoying the festival’s various booths and kid-friendly activities. They didn’t swim on this first visit but were eager to find a time to return to do so. With only a few days available before a new school year begins, we booked a one-night stay and made the roughly one-hour drive from our home on Wednesday morning. The property has been developed in a well-thought-out manner, and the family / staff have done an excellent job maintaining the natural beauty of the land. The numerous bald cypress trees throughout the property were particularly enjoyable to see. You can click on any of the images below to view them larger.\n\nWhile it was very hot in the afternoon, wading and swimming in the cold, spring-fed pools, as well as sitting in the shade of the abundant and large bald cypress trees throughout the property helped keep us cool. Taking breaks in our AC-cooled Aliner Scout camper helped also. The campground wasn’t very full on a Wednesday, so we chose site 12, which had plenty of shade throughout the day (see images above). I’d recommend sites 12-17 if you camp in one of the RV sites in the warmer months because they seem to have the most shade among the sites with the most level ground. I’m unsure if you can reserve a specific site or if it is first come, first served, but it never hurts to ask if you could select your site in advance when making a reservation. Keep in mind that pets are not allowed, and the property is closed to visitors from November 1 through February 15. Click here for an FAQ with other information you’ll want to review before planning a trip. Also, while the family / staff do a great job keeping the property clean and well-maintained, with as much foot traffic as they see each day / week, patrons need to do their part to take care of this beautiful area that the family has made available to the public. In other words, don’t leave trash on the ground and treat the property the same way you would if you owned it. We didn’t see a lot of trash outside the many trash cans located throughout the property, but I picked up a plastic grocery sack worth of cans, bottles and random food wrappers by the natural pool area on Thursday morning before the property re-opened to the public for day use. It’s the same issue we frequently encounter in visiting state parks, and I always lament how disrespectful and destructive it is not only to the natural world but also to fellow guests who are enjoying the space. As I step off my proverbial soapbox, I’ll note that you can click on any of the images below to view them larger.\n\nKrause Springs is a beautiful location in central Texas, offering a very family-friendly destination and a nice place to stay cool during the increasingly hot summers. We’d highly recommend that you plan a trip to this property if you’re looking for a fun family outing either for the day or for an overnight camping trip."
