        "text": "Austin marked it's 16th triple digit day of the year yesterday with a high of 102, and today's forecast calls for a peak around 103 or 104. Today's record to beat? 105 in metro Austin from 1951. Take extra steps to keep yourself cool & safe out there today! A HEAT ADVISORY is in effect for the CapCity area from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m.\n\nCurrent Conditions | Satellite & Radar | Travel Maps\n\n7 Day Forecast | Allergy\n\nAn EXCESSIVE HEAT WARNING will be in effect for Llano and Burnet Co. in the Hill Country, where wildfires have been rampant the past few days. As our vegetation continues to dry out, the fire risk will grow even higher so be especially careful with flames.\n\nUpper-level high pressure is getting even stronger over Texas from the west, combining with abundant sunshine to make bring the dangerous levels of heat. The normal high this time of year is 96. As temperatures rise a few more degrees over the next couple of days, it'll be more likely that we'll set new records.\n\nRecords to beat on Friday: 104 Mabry (2000) & 103 at the Airport (2000.) On Saturday: Mabry 104 (2017) & Airport 102 (2000.) For Sunday: Mabry 104 (2011) & Airport 102 (2009.)\n\nComputer models show the ridge holding strong through Monday then it could back off to the west by Tuesday, allowing a potential rare July cold front to enter the Lone Star State by Wednesday of next week. For now, it's a long shot but we do have at least a slim 20% rain chance in the forecast.\n\nHistorically, the first two weeks of August are the hottest time of year in Austin.\n\nJoin us for 'Weather on the 1s' every 10 minutes on TV or the live stream for the latest on the African dust situation and a look at the long range outlook.\n\nWEATHER ON THE GO: Download the Spectrum News app and watch our live stream no matter where you are!\n\nGET WEATHER ALERTS: Sign up to receive weather text alerts from the Spectrum News Weather Team"
