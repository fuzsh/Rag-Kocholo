        "text": "Central Texas has completed its full-180 transition from our 4th hottest meteorological summer (June 1 - August 30) on record to record rainfall and below-average temperatures in Austin. Rain totals are still slowly climbing as of the writing of this article midday Friday, September 4th, but the numbers are already very impressive.\n\nThis largely-beneficial rainfall over the last few days came courtesy of a favorable pattern shift in the large-scale weather pattern in the U.S. High pressure, responsible for extreme heat, had shifted to the west and allowed low pressure to move in out of the north. Additionally, a separate area of high pressure on the east coast of the U.S caused that low pressure to hit the brakes and enter a holding pattern over Texas for several days with several rounds of heavy rain.\n\nThe heavy rainfall wasn't evenly distributed across Central Texas with portions of Burnet and Llano counties receiving a tenth of an inch of rain or less. Austin, and most of Travis county, did see that heavy rain, and it set a new record daily rainfall amount for Austin Bergstrom Airport. At least 3.46\" fell there, nearly tripling the previous daily record of 1.31\" set back in 2013. That is nearly double the total rainfall from July and August combined, and it's the single highest daily rainfall total at the airport since May 3rd of 2019. Camp Mabry, Austin's official climate reporting site, also fared well with more than 3\" of rain reported since September 1st.\n\nOther cities and neighborhoods, especially along the I-35 corridor, saw even more than that. Here are 5-day rainfall totals from a handful of LCRA rain gauges in Travis, Williamson, and Hays counties.\n\nThe highest total came from the east side of Buda which was a bulls-eye for heavy rain on Friday morning. 24 hour rainfall total there topped 6.84\" according to the National Weather Service, which was enough to prompt a flash flood warning for a few hours with some low-water crossings flooded. Speaking of which, be sure to visit before you hit the road to avoid flooded/closed low-water crossings."
