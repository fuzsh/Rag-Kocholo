        "text": "The Latest on flooding in Texas (all times local):\n\n10:40 a.m.\n\nRaging floodwaters have destroyed a bridge over a river in Central Texas.\n\nVideo shows the bloated Llano River overrunning a bridge in Kingsland, about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of Austin.\n\nThe National Weather Service says the river at nearby Llano is expected to crest Tuesday morning at near-record levels near 41 feet (12.5 meters), which is 18 feet (5.5 meters) above major flood stage.\n\nA flash flood warning is in effect, and forecasters describe it as a \"very dangerous situation.\"\n\nIt's not expected to drop below major flood stage until Wednesday.\n\nFour people were washed away last week when the South Llano River, which becomes the Llano River downstream, overran an RV park in Junction, Texas. Three bodies have been recovered.\n\n___\n\n10:35 a.m.\n\nHeavy rains have swollen Central Texas rivers, sending water over bridges, threatening riverside structures and prompting recommendations for area residents to evacuate.\n\nThe National Weather Service says \"major flooding\" is occurring along the Llano River and the nearby Colorado River on Tuesday. Evacuations are underway in the cities of Kingsland and Marble Falls, both northwest of Austin.\n\nWater on the Llano is cresting at nearly 40 feet (12 meters), just shy of the record of 41.5 feet.\n\nIn addition to the evacuations, several school districts closed for the day and emergency personnel blocked access to more than 150 low-water crossings.\n\nFast-moving water slammed against bridges, causing at least one to crumble under the flow.\n\nThe rain also was causing problems in other parts of Texas. The Fort Worth Fire Department, for instance, said it had responded Tuesday morning to some 80 traffic accidents relating to slick roads and poor visibility.\n\n___\n\n7:30 a.m.\n\nForecasters are telling people along the Llano River in Central Texas to seek higher ground after more than 10 inches of rain fell in the past day and a half.\n\nThe National Weather Service says the river at Llano, about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of Austin, is expected to crest Tuesday morning at near-record levels. A flash flood warning is in effect, and forecasters describe it as a \"very dangerous situation.\"\n\nThe river was expected to crest at near 41 feet (12.5 meters), which is 18 feet (5.5 meters) above major flood stage. It's not expected to drop below major flood stage until Wednesday.\n\nLast week, four people were swept away in floodwaters along the South Llano River in Junction. The bodies of three were recovered and one person remains missing.\n\n(Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
