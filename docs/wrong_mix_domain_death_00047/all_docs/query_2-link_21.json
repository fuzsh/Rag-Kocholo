        "text": "Samuel George Davis Jr. (December 8, 1925 – May 16, 1990) was an American singer, dancer, actor, comedian, film producer and television director. A Tony-nominated performer, Davis was also associated with popular recordings like \"I've Gotta Be Me\" and the No. 1 hit \"The Candy Man.\" He was often billed as the \"greatest living entertainer in the world\".\n\nHe was born in Harlem, Manhattan, the son of dancer Elvera Davis (née Sanchez) and vaudeville star Sammy Davis Sr.. His father was African-American and his mother was of Cuban and African-American ancestry. Davis Jr. was known as someone who could do it all, sing, dance, play instruments, act, do stand-up and he was known for his self-deprecating humor; he once heard someone complaining about discrimination, and he said, \"You got it easy. I'm a short, ugly, one-eyed, black Jew. What do you think it's like for me?\" (he had converted to Judaism).\n\nA short stint in the army opened his eyes to the evils of racism. A slight man, he was often beaten up by bigger white soldiers and given the dirtiest and most dangerous assignments by white officers simply because he was black. He helped break down racial barriers in show business in the 1950s and 1960s, especially in Las Vegas, where he often performed; when he started there in the early 1950s, he was not allowed to stay in the hotels he played in, as they refused to take blacks as customers. He also stirred up a large amount of controversy in the 1960s by openly dating, and ultimately marrying, blonde, blue-eyed, Swedish-born actress May Britt.\n\nStardom and The Rat Pack[]\n\nHe starred in the Broadway musical \"Golden Boy\" in the 1960s. Initially a success, internal tensions, production problems and bad reviews--many of them directed at Davis for playing a role originally written for a white man resulted in its closing fairly quickly. His film and nightclub career were in full swing, however, and he became even more famous as one of the \"Rat Pack\", a group of free-wheeling entertainers that included Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Joey Bishop and Peter Lawford.\n\nDavis appeared with members of the pack in the films Ocean’s 11 (1960), Sergeants 3 (1962) and Robin and the 7 Hoods (1964). Davis was also a featured player in films outside of the pack, including A Man Called Adam (1966), having the titular role opposite Louis Armstrong. And he was unforgettable in Bob Fosse's Sweet Charity (1969, with Shirley MacLaine), in which Davis appeared as the charismatic, singing and strutting guru Big Daddy.\n\nThe iconic performer also released a steady stream of albums on Decca and Reprise. (Davis was the first artist to be signed on the latter label, which was launched by Sinatra.) Davis was nominated for a Record of the Year Grammy for the song “What Kind of Fool Am I?,” which reached the Top 20 of the Billboard pop charts as well. And Davis's live stage work continued to earn him honors, as seen with his Tony Award–nominated performance in the 1964 musical Golden Boy.\n\nIn 1966, the entertainer hosted his own short-lived variety series, The Sammy Davis Jr. Show. Years later, he played host again on the syndicated talk show Sammy and Company, from 1975-77.\n\nThroughout the 1970s and ’80s, the multitalented Davis continued his prolific output. He maintained his musical career, releasing albums well into the late '70s and getting his first #1 chart hit with 1972’s “Candy Man.” Davis appeared in films such as 1981's The Cannonball Run, with Burt Reynolds and Roger Moore, and 1989’s Tap, with Gregory Hines. He was also a guest on a wide variety of television shows, including the Tonight Show, The Carol Burnett Show, All in the Family and The Jeffersons as well as the soap operas General Hospital and One Life to Live. And Davis made another turn on Broadway during the summer of 1978 in Stop the World - I Want to Get Off, though overall some critics were turned off by what they perceived as hammed up appearances.\n\nPersonal Life[]\n\nDavis was seriously involved with bombshell actress Kim Novak in the 1950s, though their union faced much harassment due to the racial climate of the day. Davis was ultimately married three times, first briefly to singer Loray White, then to Britt in 1960, with the two having a biological daughter and two adopted sons. The couple divorced by the end of the decade and Davis remarried in 1970 to dancer Altovise Gore, who remained with him until his passing. They adopted another son as well.\n\nWith the harshness of his early years not to be underestimated, Davis struggled throughout much of his life with addictions, succumbing to alcohol and drug abuse after his split with Britt and having a major gambling problem that ate up millions of dollars.\n\nThe entertainer published the well-known 1965 autobiography Yes I Can: The Story of Sammy Davis Jr. followed by Why Me? in 1980. Another autobiography, Sammy, was released posthumously in 2000, while the comprehensive Wil Haygood biography In Black and White: The Life of Sammy Davis Jr. was published in 2003.\n\nDavis nearly died in an automobile accident on November 19, 1954, in San Bernardino, California, as he was making a return trip from Las Vegas to Los Angeles. During the previous year, he had started a friendship with comedian and host Eddie Cantor, who had given him a mezuzah. Instead of putting it by his door as a traditional blessing, Davis wore it around his neck for good luck. The only time he forgot it was the night of the accident. The accident occurred at a fork in U.S. Route 66 at Cajon Boulevard and Kendall Drive, when a driver, who missed turning at the fork, backed up her car in Davis's lane and Davis drove into her car. Davis consequently lost his left eye to the bullet-shaped horn button (a standard feature in 1954 and 1955 Cadillacs). His friend, actor Jeff Chandler, said he would give one of his own eyes to keep Davis from total blindness. Davis wore an eye patch for at least six months following the accident. He was featured with the patch on the cover of his debut album and appeared on What's My Line? wearing the patch. Later, he was fitted for a glass eye, which he wore for the rest of his life.\n\nIn the hospital, Eddie Cantor described to Davis the similarities between Jewish and Black cultures. Davis, born to a Catholic mother and Baptist father, began studying Jewish history, converting to Judaism several years later in 1961. One passage from his readings (from the book A History of the Jews by Abram L. Sachar), describing the endurance of the Jewish people, interested him in particular: \"The Jews would not die. Three millennia of prophetic teaching had given them an unwavering spirit of resignation and had created in them a will to live which no disaster could crush.\" The accident marked a turning point in Davis's career, taking him from a well-known entertainer to a national celebrity\n\nFinal Years[]\n\nBut while his career continued, with the performer embarking on a lauded tour with Sinatra and Liza Minnelli during the late '80s, Davis’s health began to fade. Davis was a heavy smoker, and in 1989 doctors discovered a tumor in his throat. The fall of that year he gave what would be his final performance, at the Harrah’s casino in Lake Tahoe. Shortly thereafter, Davis underwent radiation therapy. Though the disease appeared to be in remission, it was later discovered to have returned. On May 16, 1990, Sammy Davis Jr. passed away at his home in Beverly Hills, California, at the age of 64. Before his death, he was honored by an array of his peers at a February television tribute.\n\nThe Real Showmen[]\n\n“When I was young, the people I watched were the real showmen — James Brown, Sammy Davis Jr., Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly.” - Michael Jackson\n\nMichael considers Davis to be one of his major influence and has paid tribute to him many of times. Davis and Jackson were extremely close; when Jackson was just in his twenties, he would often show up at Davis’s house unannounced to immerse himself in the archives, a room downstairs that contained videos of Davis’s performances over the years. Davis would give advice to Jackson even at a very early age. Jackson recalls when Davis told him “Don’t ever do drugs,’ they told us. I never forgot it.”\n\n“Michael Jackson is more than a friend, He’s like a son.\" - Sammy Davis, Jr.\n\nTribute[]\n\nMichael has paid tribute to Davis on many occasions but none as memorable as his moving performance at the Sammy Davis, Jr. 60th Anniversary Celebration in 1990.\n\nVideos[]\n\nHonors and awards[]\n\nShortly before his death in 1990, ABC aired the TV special Sammy Davis, Jr. 60th Anniversary Celebration, produced by George Schlatter. An all-star cast, including Michael Jackson, Eddie Murphy, Diahann Carroll, Clint Eastwood, and Ella Fitzgerald, paid tribute to Davis. The show was nominated for six Primetime Emmy Awards, winning Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy.\n\nGrammy Awards[]\n\nYear Category Song Result Notes 2002 Grammy Hall of Fame Award \"What Kind of Fool Am I?\" Inducted Recorded in 1962 2001 Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award Winner Posthumously 1972 Pop Male Vocalist \"Candy Man\" Nominee 1962 Record of the Year \"What Kind of Fool Am I?\" Nominee 1962 Male Solo Vocal Performance \"What Kind of Fool Am I?\" Nominee\n\nEmmy Awards[]\n\nYear Category Program Result 1990 Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Sammy Davis Jr.'s 60th Anniversary Celebration Winner 1989 Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series The Cosby Show Nominee 1980 Outstanding Cameo Appearance in a Daytime Drama Series One Life to Live Nominee 1966 Outstanding Variety Special The Swinging World of Sammy Davis Jr. Nominee 1956 Best Specialty Act — Single or Group Sammy Davis Jr. Nominee\n\nOther honors[]\n\nYear Category Organization Program Result 2017 Singer National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame Inducted 2008 International Civil Rights Walk of Fame Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site Inducted 2006 Las Vegas Walk of Stars front of Riviera Hotel Inducted 1989 NAACP Image Award NAACP Winner 1987 Kennedy Center Honors John F.
