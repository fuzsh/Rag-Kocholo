        "text": "Adriana Miller of Silver Spring MD passed away peacefully on December 2, 2021, at the age of 85. Adriana was born raised and educated in Boston, MA. After graduating high school, she went on to study various styles of dance and performing arts at the Boston Conservatory of Music and the Stanley Brown Dance Studios. In 1972 she opened “Adriana’s Mecca of Middle Eastern Dance” in Washington D.C. After the Dance studio closed, she stayed in Washington to promote and sponsor many workshops and shows.\n\nAdriana was a woman of many hobbies and talents however her true passion was dance. Her dancing career brought her up and down the east coast setting a standard that many other dancers could not achieve. Adriana shared her vast skill set with as many as four hundred dancers a week through her studio and performed at notable places such as the Kennedy Center, the Smithsonian and the White House and worked in her younger years with other performers such as Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr. Adriana was always trying to lend a hand and share her big heart with the world. She was a charismatic leader, a loving wife, sister, aunt, and in spite of her complex personality she was a friend to all. She will be deeply missed by all who had the privilege to have known, seen, or worked with her.\n\nAdriana was predeceased by her loving husband Charles Miller, her stepson Jon Miller, and her siblings Joseph Menconi and Maria Waldron. She leaves behind many nieces, nephews and great nieces and nephews."
