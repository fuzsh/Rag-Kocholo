He was born in London and educated at University College School and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. The late, great Beatrice Lillie plucked him out of the Footlights Revue at Londonâs Phoenix Theatre and made him her leading man in An Evening with Beatrice Lillie at the Globe Theatre, where he spent the first year of his professional life writing the musical, Boy on the Corner, and the screenplay and score of his first motion picture, Charley Moon, which won his first Ivor Novello Award, Britainâs premiere music award. That year he decided to drop the possibilities of directing and performing, and concentrate his career on becoming a full-time writer-composer-lyricist. His subsequent stage musicals include Stop the WorldâI Want to Get Off, The Roar of the GreasepaintâThe Smell of the Crowd, Pickwick, Harvey, The Good Old Bad Old Days, Goodbye, Mr. Chips, Henryâs Wives, Scrooge, One Shining Moment, Sherlock Holmes, Jekyll and Hyde and Victor/Victoria. He has written songs and/or screenplays for such films as Doctor Dolittle, Scrooge, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Goodbye, Mr. Chips, Superman, Victor/Victoria, Santa Claus â The Movie, Home Alone I & II, Hook, Tom & Jerry â The Movie,; and various Pink Panther films. Bricusse has written more than 40 musical shows and films, and over the years has had the good fortune to enjoy fruitful collaborations with an array of musical talents, including Anthony Newley, Henry Mancini, John Williams, John Barry, Jerry Goldsmith, Jule Styne, Quincy Jones, Andre Previn, Frank Wildhorn and Peter Illyich Tchaikovsky (whose Nutcracker Suite he adapted into a song score). His better-known songs include âWhat Kind of Fool Am I?,âââOnce in a Lifetime,â âGonna Build a Mountain,â âWho Can I Turn To?,â âThe Joker,â âIf I Ruled the World,â âMy Kind of Girl,â âTalk to the Animals,â âYou and I,â âFeeling Good,â âWhen I Look in Your Eyes,â âGoldfinger,â âCan You Read My Mind?â (the Love Theme from Superman), âYou Only Live Twice,â âLe Jazz Hot!,â âOn a Wonderful Day Like Today,â âTwo for the Road,â âThe Candy Man,â âThis Is the Moment,â âCrazy World,â âPure Imaginationâ and âOompa-Loompa-Doompa-Dee-Doo.â He has been nominated for ten Academy Awards, nine Grammys and four Tonys, and has won two Oscars, a Grammy and eight Ivor Novello Awards. Hundreds of Bricusseâs songs have been recorded by major artists, including Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Judy Garland, Aretha Franklin, Barbra Streisand, Sammy Davis, Jr. (who recorded 60 Bricusse songs), Tony Bennett, Shirley Bassey, Tom Jones, Petula Clark, Julie Andrews, Liza Minnelli, Elaine Paige, Anthony Newley, Michael Feinstein, Bette Midler, the Moody Blues, Nancy Sinatra, Lena Horne, Sergio Mendes, Nina Simone, Dionne Warwick, Ray Charles, Ethel Merman, Placido Domingo, Jennifer Holliday, Danny Kaye, Robbie Williams, Mariah Carey, Linda Eder, Maroon 5, Michael BublÃ©, and the Black Eyed Peas. In 1989 he received the Kennedy Award for consistent excellence in British songwriting, bestowed by the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors, and was inducted into the American Songwriters Hall of Fame â only the fourth Englishman to be honored â after NoÃ«l Coward, John Lennon and Paul McCartney.\n\nAnthony Newley (Additional Songs)\n\nï»¿Anthony Newley garnered three Tony Award nominations (Best Actor, Best Musical Author and Best Composer and Lyricist) for Stop the WorldâI Want to Get Off and two Tony Award nominations (Best Director and Best Composer and Lyricist) for The Roar of the GreasepaintâThe Smell of the Crowd, both written with his longtime collaborator, Leslie Bricusse. After the worldwide success of these two hit musicals, Mr. Newley ventured into film with roles in Doctor Dolittle and Sweet November. Other film credits as director, actor or producer include Summertree, It Seemed Like a Good Idea at the Time, Mr. Quilp and Can Hieronymous Merkin Ever Forget Mercy Humppe and Find True Happiness? His collaborations with Mr. Bricusse also produced the score to the television production of Peter Pan which starred Danny Kaye and Mia Farrow, the film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, and the London stage production of the Good Old Bad Old Days. Together they created such standards as âWhat Kind of Fool Am I?,â âWho Can I Turn To?,â âGoldfinger,â âOnce in a Lifetimeâ and Sammy Davis, Jr.âs international hit record âThe Candy Man.â On television he played opposite Joan Collins in the âTonight at Eight Thirtyâ series, âRed Peppersâ and âFumed Oak.â His final television appearances were in âEastendersâ and âThe Lakes.â Mr. Newley devoted his time in later years to personal appearances in nightclubs and cabarets around the world performing his highly acclaimed one man show. During the last five years of his life he achieved enormous success in the musical version of Scrooge culminating in a record breaking season at Londonâs Dominion Theatre.\n\nKeith Glover (Director)\n\nï»¿The multitalented Keith Glover returns to The Old Globe having previously directed his own work, Thunder Knocking on the Door, winner of the American Theatre Critics Associationâs Osborn Award.
