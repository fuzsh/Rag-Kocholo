        "text": "Just hours left to get your turkey hash.\n\nAfter 87 years in business, Charlie's Sandwich Shoppe, a landmark restaurant in Boston's South End, is set to close Saturday. It had announced in May that it would shut down.\n\nThe eatery is famous for serving African-American jazz musicians during an era of segregated hotels. Its notable diners include Sammy Davis Jr., Duke Ellington and chef Julia Child. It was also a stop for politicians; last year, President Obama got a meal there.\n\nIn 2005, it won a James Beard Award, a distinction given for excellence in cuisine.\n\nOn Friday, a line stretched outside Charlie's. Boston resident Steve Dunwell was there.\n\n\"I think it's a loss to the city that it's closing and it's the end of a historical period, in a way,\" Dunwell said. \"This place was very important to African-American history in Boston and I think people should know about that.\"\n\nLongtime patron Cory O'Hayre was also there Friday.\n\n\"It's an institution,\" he said. \"They haven't changed a stick of furniture since what, the '20s, '30s, '40s? Something like that. So it's definitely something that will be missed and it's something â€” you can't replicate it.\""
