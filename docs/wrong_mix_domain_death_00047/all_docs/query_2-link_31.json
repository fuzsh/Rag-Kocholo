        "text": "Transcript\n\nSammy Davis, Jr., is often called the greatest entertainer of all time.\n\nHis act showcased dancing, comedy, music, and vocals.\n\nHis talent and perseverance brought him fame, even as he contended with being a Black performer…\n\nduring the era of segregation, dealing with racism, violence, and substance abuse issues.\n\nSammy Davis, Jr., was born in Harlem, New York, in 1925…\n\nto a Puerto Rican mother who was a tap dancer and a Black father who was a vaudeville actor.\n\nSammy Davis, Sr., took his son on tour with him.\n\nBy the time he was four, Davis was part of the act, now a trio.\n\nDavis toured with the company until he was drafted in 1942.\n\nHe later wrote that the racism he encountered in the army surprised him, because his father had shielded him from it so well during childhood.\n\nDavis was repeatedly assaulted and harassed by fellow soldiers.\n\nHe focused on honing his entertaining craft during this time, performing for camps as part of the Special Services unit.\n\nHe rejoined the Will Mastin Trio after the army, and he began recording songs.\n\nThe trio performed at popular nightclubs in New York, which is where Davis befriended Frank Sinatra.\n\nDavis made his Broadway debut a year later.\n\nSeveral television appearances followed.\n\nIn 1960 he accepted Sinatra’s invitation to join him—along with Dean Martin, Joey Bishop, and Peter Lawford—in Vegas.\n\nBy day they filmed Ocean’s Eleven, and by night they played shows.\n\nThey were a smash success, with 35,000 requests for rooms at the casino in the first month.\n\nThe press dubbed them the Rat Pack.\n\nLawford’s connections to the Kennedy family meant that John F. Kennedy began attending their shows.\n\nThe Rat Pack ardently campaigned for JFK’s presidency…\n\nbut Davis’s interracial marriage to Swedish actress May Britt—then still illegal in 31 states—caused JFK to rescind Davis’s invitation to perform at an inaugural gala.\n\nThis rejection led Davis to embrace Richard Nixon…\n\n—literally, he hugged him onstage and received criticism for it—\n\nand he also marched with Martin Luther King, Jr., and championed civil rights.\n\nA wave of uprisings swept the country after King's assassination in 1968.\n\nDemonstrations in nearly 200 cities turned to riots with varying levels of violence that saw 43 killed and more than 3,500 injured.\n\nDavis condemned the response.\n\nAnd I don't see sad faces mourning the tragic loss of this great American.\n\nI see people laughing and giggling. I somehow want to disown those people.\n\nI don't want to call those people who are laughing—less than 48 hours after our leader died—and stealing…\n\nthose are not really brothers.\n\nThose cannot be the people who are striving for the dignity that we should have at this point.\n\nBefore Davis became a star, he wasn’t allowed to stay in the hotels he performed at.\n\nAfter his fame skyrocketed, however, he could afford to turn down gigs that treated him poorly because of his race…\n\nand in doing so he helped spur the integration of Miami nightclubs and Las Vegas casinos.\n\nBy the time of his death in 1990, Davis had recorded more than 50 albums and starred in three Broadway shows.\n\nHe was posthumously awarded a Lifetime Achievement Grammy."
