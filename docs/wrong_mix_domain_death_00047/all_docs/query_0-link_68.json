        "text": "TOM PUTNAM: Good evening. I'm Tom Putnam, Director of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum. On behalf of Tom McNaught, Executive Director of the Kennedy Library Foundation, and all of my Library and Foundation colleagues, I thank you for coming and acknowledge the generous underwriters of the Kennedy Library Forums: lead sponsor Bank of America, Raytheon, Boston Capital, the Boston Foundation, and the Lowell Institute, represented here tonight by Bill Lowell, and our media partners, The Boston Globe and WBUR.\n\nI thought I might personalize my introductions this evening with a few brief anecdotes. Of all the Forums I've attended during my 12 years working here, there's a portion of one that I've returned to again and again, and I once organized a meeting for the entire Library staff to watch it on video. The remarks were those made by our speaker this evening, Alan Brinkley, at a Forum like this one in October 2003, which began with these sentences:\n\n\"On the morning of November 22, 1963, John Kennedy woke up as a man, as a President, as a political figure with admirers and detractors, a man with a record, some of it good, some of it not. By the evening of that day, he had become a legend and shrouded in a fog of grief and posthumous adulation from which he never fully emerged.\"\n\nAs a staff, we grapple with disentangling the man and the myth and Professor Brinkley's remarks about our 35th President, both on that day and now in his new book, are among the most edifying on how to deal with that challenge.\n\nOn a wholly different note, I should disclose that Professor Brinkley resides in my home, at least in print form, as his textbook is used in the high school my son attends. With a father who is such a devotee of history, my son, who's here tonight with his teachers and classmates, has learned that in our normal parent/child negotiations, he strengthens his hand when it is holding Alan Brinkley's textbook. [laughter] What's a dad to do?\n\nMy wife is often bewildered by my enthusiasm when I bring home yet another Kennedy biography. So when I described this new volume as the most comprehensive, balanced and nuanced in recent memory, I was surprised when she remarked that she would read it when her spring semester ends. So, again in print form, Alan will soon be moving across the hall and into my bedroom. [laughter]\n\nThe Allan Nevins Professor of History and Provost Emeritus at Columbia University, Alan Brinkley is one of our country's finest historians and a renowned expert on the New Deal. He last spoke here about his most recent book, The Publisher: Henry Luce and His American Century, and we are delighted to have him back again on our stage.\n\nOur moderator this evening is Ellen Fitzpatrick, the Carpenter Professor of History at the University of New Hampshire, frequent analyst on the NewsHour, and author and editor of six books, including Letters to Jackie: Condolences from a Grieving Nation, which Doris Kearns Goodwin described as a stunningly fresh look at the impact of President Kennedy's assassination on the American people.\n\nI should note that both Professor Brinkley's and Professor Fitzpatrick's books are on sale in our bookstore. That volume helped to highlight a wonderful, yet previously unharvested collection of materials from our archives and endeared Ellen to our staff with her generous manner and the appreciation she extended to the archivists who helped her in her work. Budding historians in the audience, take note.\n\nAllow me to end with a word about the original editor of The American President Series, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., who served as a member of the Kennedy Administration and was one of its most famous chroniclers. Professor Schlesinger recounted the tale that when he first arrived at the White House his portfolio was unclear, so he remarked to JFK, \"I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing here.\" At which point the President said, \"Well, neither am I.\"\n\nArthur Schlesinger often animated this hall and his gifts to this Library and to our nation's history are immeasurable. And we can now count among them his inspired decision, as the editor of The American President Series, to ask his friend and colleague, Alan Brinkley, to write this exceptional new volume on John F. Kennedy.\n\nPlease join me now in welcoming Alan Brinkley and Ellen Fitzpatrick to the Kennedy Library. [applause]\n\nELLEN FITZPATRICK: Well, Alan, we've had so many conversations about this subject that I very much look forward to having a more official version of the same. It's usually over coffee or something stronger that we have discussed these things, but tonight we have put on our best to talk to you as historians about this very wonderful short biography that Alan has done of John F. Kennedy.\n\nYou begin the book talking about your earliest impressions of JFK and you mention that as a boy, growing up in Washington, DC, you stood on Capitol Hill in 1961 and watched President Kennedy being inaugurated, and then on Pennsylvania Avenue in November of 1963 watching the funeral cortege go by. Tell us a little bit about your early impressions and your memories of John F. Kennedy.\n\nALAN BRINKLEY: Well, I was a tremendous admirer of John Kennedy and I still am, although in a different way from when I was, what, 12 years old. I, like many people, found Kennedy to be an extraordinary person with so much charisma. My family was friends with the Kennedys so I just felt as though, living in Washington, my father, being a journalist, I was just suffused with Kennedys [laughter] and admired them all.\n\nWhen he died, I was, I guess in 8th grade, and I remember sitting in my school in Bethesda, Maryland, and I was working on the middle school newspaper. One of my friends came into the room where I was working and said the President's been shot. I thought it was a joke. I walked out of the room and into the hallway, and there was this big claque of people standing in front of an office where there was one little transistor radio. That's what communications were [laughter] in 1963. And it was just such a shock to me. I mean, I'd never seen such an important figure die. Of course, we've seen many important people die since then, but it was really a shock in my life when he died.\n\nMy father was on television talking about it, and it is just embedded in my memory. I don't think there's any experience I've had, except maybe 9/11, that is more embedded in my memory than the assassination of John Kennedy and its aftermath. I think most people of our age probably feel much the same way, just as many more younger people feel the same way about 9/11.\n\nSo I grew up as a great admirer of Kennedy. I had a picture of him in my room when I was an undergraduate at Princeton. Then, over time there were periods when I became disillusioned with Kennedy, but never for very long. But I've had all sorts of different views of Kennedy over the years and even things that I've written as an historian, some of them are very different from what I did in earlier and later times. I think many people who are interested in Kennedy find themselves thinking about Kennedy in different ways as time changes and as events change.\n\nELLEN FITZPATRICK: It's hard to disaggregate, I think, Kennedy's Presidency and our experience as young people, of his election, the idealism, the sense of hopefulness, and then the terrible end to it from the '60s themselves and, for that matter, the rest of the later 20th century. So this period, I wondered if you could talk a little bit about what you alluded to just then – becoming a professional historian, even going to graduate school in the '70s. You probably didn't have a picture of John F. Kennedy on your wall for very long. [laughter]\n\nALAN BRINKLEY: No, I didn't. [laughter]\n\nELLEN FITZPATRICK: The rise of the new left, the antiwar movement. It's so interconnected.\n\nALAN BRINKLEY: I've always been a liberal, I would guess, but I think I was drawn more to the left in the '60s, as many people were. I didn't stay there for that long, but, yes, there were times when I felt that Kennedy was a cold warrior, who was too aggressive, too much engaged with the Cold War, wasn't realizing how things were changing, how things did change. Of course, there still are people, there still are historians who think that Kennedy was a terrible President, that the Cuban Missile Crisis was, in fact, Kennedy's own doing after the Bay of Pigs. Lots of things that Kennedy did were failures and those things are still barbs in the life of Kennedy.\n\nBut when I think now about Kennedy, I think about him as someone who gave Americans a feeling of how life in America could change, how life could be better, how the world could be better, and I think that was true of people around the world. I think Kennedy had such charisma and he was such a great orator, and his rhetoric was such a powerful thing in American and, as I said before, global life. His death was a shock to the world, not just to Americans. I think Kennedy's legacy, in a way, is the hope that he gave to so many people. His death seemed, for many people for a while, to be the end of a kind of hope that they had believed in, and still believe in, many people do.\n\nELLEN FITZPATRICK: You articulate very well, I think, in your book this sense of possibility, of idealism, the great expectations of his Presidency. But when you describe the Washington of 1960, the Congress that he was dealing with and even the Democratic Party itself and what it took John F. Kennedy to rise in that Party, one wonders why was anyone optimistic that anything would ever happen?\n\nALAN BRINKLEY: Well, I've been reading Robert Caro's new book, which covers the period of – this is his book about Lyndon Johnson but the book that has just come out includes the Kennedy years and his time as Vice President, which was not a happy time for Lyndon Johnson. Kennedy had great strengths and many weaknesses. His great strengths, I think, were the way he eventually – not from the beginning, but by the time he finished with the Cuban Missile Crisis – he became a very important figure in global issues. His American University speech and other things made him a great hero across much of the world, especially the non-Communist world.\n\nOn the other hand, his charisma, his great speeches, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the American University speech, many other things are things that we can remember as a very important part of what made America such a hopeful place, at least for a while. On the other hand, he had many failures. He got almost nothing through Congress or very little through Congress, and the most important things he tried to get through Congress got nowhere.\n\nHe made tremendous mistakes – the Bay of Pigs, for example, which was a terrible mistake. Anyone who thought about it, maybe afterwards, but I think at the time even, you could have understood that this was not going to be a good thing to do. But because Eisenhower said it had to be done and this was a young President and not very experienced, this is not something I think he would have done, even as early as 1962. But you can imagine at least that the Bay of Pigs was the beginning of the worst part of the Kennedy years, starting with the Bay of Pigs, then Operation Mongoose. The Cuban Missile Crisis, I think, was in part a result of Bay of Pigs and the fear that the United States was going to invade Cuba, and possibly … I mean, there are so many ways of thinking about why Kennedy died, but one possibility is that Cuba, from the very beginning, from Bay of Pigs to the assassination, you could draw a line all the way through. We have no idea whether that's the case, but I think that's one of the great failures of Kennedy, even though the Cuban Missile Crisis he handled so beautifully.\n\nELLEN FITZPATRICK: It's interesting to think about, as I referenced, when we were in graduate school, he was recast as a cold warrior. And the roots of American intervention in Vietnam were laid at his doorstep, among other doorsteps, and the unfolding of more information about Operation Mongoose and the attempts to overthrow Castro, all of these views of Kennedy have more recently competed with another view of him as reticent to engage directly United States military power. I wondered, as you went through the biography, whether you were more struck by the latter than the former; that is, his hesitancy, both at the Bay of Pigs to provide the American air cover which he was very much criticized for; there's, of course, the debate about whether he would have escalated the war in Vietnam, as his successor did; his response to the Cuban Missile Crisis, which was less aggressive than some had recommended. So where does the balance lie in your view?\n\nALAN BRINKLEY: Well, I think some of the worst things that happened in Kennedy's Presidency were in the beginning. It began with the Bay of Pigs, which was very early in his Presidency. I think that is something he probably wouldn't have done if he had had a little more time and had not been pressured by Eisenhower and Allen Dulles and the CIA. You could tell, I think, in the Bay of Pigs that he was uneasy with this and wasn't sure that it was the right thing to do, but everybody was telling him he had to do it. The fiasco that it turned into I think changed him so that when it came to the Cuban Missile Crisis, which was only a year later or a little more than a year, he was much more cautious and that's what made his work in the Cuban Missile Crisis so successful. I think he grew in the short time that he was President, especially in the way he dealt with foreign affairs in the Cold War. I think he would have been a much better President, had he lived, because of going through these different problems that he had in the early time.\n\nHis relationship with Khrushchev is a really interesting thing. He met him, of course, in the summit in Vienna, and it was a humiliating experience for Kennedy, who didn't really know how to deal with somebody like him. He was sort of bombarded by Khrushchev. He felt – correctly, I think – that he hadn't known how to deal with him. And yet, over time, Kennedy began to respect him and he began to respect Khrushchev to a degree. By the end of the Cuban Missile Crisis, there was this opening, that both Kennedy and Khrushchev believed that there was a possibility of peace in the Cold War.\n\nAfter Kennedy's death, and it wasn't long after that that Khrushchev was deposed, the Cold War grew again. But there was that moment in Kennedy's life and in the life of America that he gave a sense of hope and a sense of optimism that has been hard to find in recent times.\n\nELLEN FITZPATRICK: You make the point in the book, actually, that the declassifying and greater availability of documents since the fall of the Soviet Union enhances the picture in terms of Kennedy's leadership during the Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\nALAN BRINKLEY: Yes. When I started this book, most of the books – this is a book that is in a series called The Presidential Series that Arthur Schlesinger launched and Sean Wilentz is now the editor – almost all of the Presidents' books are done; I'm one of the last.\n\nBut I felt uncomfortable writing this book without having archival material. I'm really grateful to the Kennedy Library for creating the digital archive that was opened just a year or two ago, when I started working on this book. This was at a time when the archives here were closed because of work, and it made a tremendous difference in the way I thought about doing this book and made a big difference in the way I thought about Kennedy after a while. So it's really a great thing for scholars that this digital archive has been created.\n\nELLEN FITZPATRICK: How about the Vietnam question, the perennial \"Would he or wouldn't he have\"?\n\nALAN BRINKLEY: Yes, I always get that one. [laughter]\n\nELLEN FITZPATRICK: Where do you come down on it? Have your views changed at all?\n\nALAN BRINKLEY: Well, I don't have an answer to what would have happened. I change my mind all the time about what Kennedy might have done if he'd lived. It's not at all surprising to me how the Vietnam War went forward when Johnson was President. I think as much as I admired Johnson in many ways, he was a much more Cold War person than Kennedy was.\n\nKennedy was uneasy about Vietnam in some of the same ways that he was about the Bay of Pigs. But I think he had a stronger view of the importance of Vietnam than he would have about the Bay of Pigs. He talked about getting out, and a few things that he said have become sort of written in stone among many of his friends, that he would definitely have gotten out of Vietnam and it was Johnson who had escalated the war and not Kennedy.\n\nThe only thing we really know is that Kennedy thought the war was important and he did send advisors, who were actually soldiers, into Vietnam. There were about 80,000 by the time he died. Still, a relatively small number of people and they weren't really combat soldiers, and he said at the time that by the end of '64/'65, they were going to get out of Vietnam and leave it all to Vietnam. That's where it stood when he died.\n\nSo what would have happened? We don't know. He talked about ending the American part of the war by 1965. But that assumed, I think, that the war would be over by then or at least that the Vietnamese would take over the war by then. But that isn't what happened and probably wouldn't have happened, whether it was Kennedy or Johnson. So what would he have done in 1965 if the war was getting worse and it had been escalating? Of course, that is what happened. Would he have gotten out of a war that was still in progress and in which he had made his own? I think it would have been very hard for him to get out of the Vietnamese War. It may be that he would have gotten out earlier than Johnson got out; Johnson never got out. It wasn't until Nixon finished it. So I don't know. I think the view of many people who seem certain that Kennedy would have gotten out well before 1965, I don't see any evidence that that's the case. I think Kennedy just didn't know what he was going to do as the war escalated. Of course, it didn't escalate a lot until about 1965, so we just don't know how he would have acted.\n\nMy guess is that it would be just very hard to get out. It took four Presidents, or even five Presidents, to get out of Vietnam. None of them ever really succeeded. A lot of smart people were working an the Vietnam War and none of them worked. So I just have this sense that anybody who got into this quagmire was going to have a really hard time getting out. I think that would have been true of Kennedy if he had lived.\n\nELLEN FITZPATRICK: You made the point in your book that it was really in part a question of whether any President would have been able to permit the fall of South Vietnam and no more likely to think Kennedy would have in 1963.\n\nALAN BRINKLEY: Yeah. Even up to 1965 or 1966 or even 1967, most Americans believed in the Vietnam War. Kennedy, I think, would have found it incredibly difficult to get out in a war that he had actually escalated himself, but we'll never know.\n\nELLEN FITZPATRICK: What about the relationship of JFK and LBJ, the vexed relationship? Robert Caro tells us that Bobby Kennedy did go to LBJ's hotel room and attempted to pressure him into backing out of the offer that had been made, to decline the Vice Presidency. How do you think JFK viewed him, versus how we know Bobby Kennedy viewed him?\n\nALAN BRINKLEY: Well, of course, I've just been reading Bob Caro's book on this very issue, and I'm sort of drawn into what he's been saying. It's a wonderful book. His view is that … What Schlesinger, for example, wrote about Kennedy and Johnson was that Kennedy was very kind to Johnson, admired him, and that Johnson claimed that he was happy to be working with John Kennedy and that Robert Kennedy, according to Schlesinger and to many other Kennedy people, never really wanted Johnson to be Vice President. It was only because Johnson insisted that he actually made him Vice President.\n\nAccording to Caro -- and Arthur Schlesinger was my very close friend, but I think he was wrong about this, and Robert Caro is also a very good friend of mine. I think Caro is more right. I don't think Kennedy would have been elected if Johnson had not been his Vice President. He would have lost Texas, he would have lost other Southern states. Johnson was probably the only Southern politician who could do this; no one campaigned like Johnson could. Kennedy himself admitted that he wouldn't have gotten elected without Lyndon Johnson. I think Kennedy always wanted Johnson to be on the ticket. Robert Kennedy probably felt differently, but John Kennedy, I think, wanted Johnson as Vice President from the beginning.\n\nI think Kennedy was mostly generous to Johnson, but he didn't give him very much to do. He didn't really respect his views very much. He was left out of most of the important issues. Lyndon Johnson was miserable but he did his job, and he never criticized the President. Robert Kennedy hated him and made it clear that he hated him; they hated each other.\n\nWhat his private view of John Kennedy is, I don't know. But I think John Kennedy, as I said, treated Lyndon Johnson with respect but I think his respect was limited, and he thought of him as a kind of … He was so different from Kennedy. I don't think he felt that Lyndon Johnson had it in him to be a President. Apparently, he told various people at various times about what it would be like if he got killed and Johnson became President and how terrible that would have been. So I don't think it was a great relationship but it worked, at least for a while.\n\nELLEN FITZPATRICK: It's ironic when you think about it because it's hard to imagine another possible vice presidential pick in 1960, of someone who would have been as successful as Johnson turned out to be in realizing Kennedy's ideals. That is, would anyone else have been able to get the Civil Rights Act through?\n\nALAN BRINKLEY: I don't think Kennedy or many other people really understood what a genius he was as a politician. If you read Bob Caro's book, Master of the Senate, you'll understand how he knew how to use power. All through his life, he knew how to use power as very few people were able to do. The greatness of Lyndon Johnson is the greatness of his political skills. But he wasn't great at everything and unfortunately for him, the great thing that he couldn't do was handle the war.\n\nI think Kennedy was wrong in thinking that Johnson was, as Caro says in his book, the Kennedy people in the White House ridiculed him and called him Rufus Cornpone. That was so wrong; I mean, he was a great figure in American politics. There would have been no civil rights bill in the '60s without Johnson. The Voting Rights Act would not have happened without Lyndon Johnson, at least not for a long time later. Kennedy couldn't get anything through Congress; Lyndon Johnson got almost everything through Congress.\n\nThese two men each have strengths and each have weaknesses. Kennedy's great weakness was his inability to get legislation through Congress. This was one of the things that everybody worried about Kennedy. He just didn't have it in him to go out and grab people by the lapels and tell them to vote the way he wanted them to. Kennedy was too reticent to do that.\n\nOn the other hand, Kennedy was great as an orator, as a foreign policy person, as a charismatic figure, as someone who could help people believe that better things could happen. He had tremendous talents, and it's why we're talking about John Kennedy today because his memory is so powerful, even though it's 50 years later – almost 50 years since his death – his legacy is so powerful, still. How many times has this room been filled with people who want to talk about John Kennedy? I'm just one of many, many people.\n\nThat gives you a sense of how powerful the memory of John Kennedy has been in American life and not just in American life. Lyndon Johnson? No, even though he was a great man for a time. He's a very important President and Robert Caro certainly thinks so, and I do, too. But his legacy is nothing like what Kennedy's is. He's just a different kind of man.\n\nELLEN FITZPATRICK: The point that you were making about Kennedy's powers as a leader and his ability to tap into this sense of hopefulness on the part of the American people and a sense of unifying around a series of objectives and goals – whether it was going to the moon or the speech that he did give on civil rights, which may have been the finest moment of his Presidency in June of 1963 – how much of all of that piece of it would have been possible or would have happened without television?\n\nALAN BRINKLEY: I think that's a very good question, because television is what made the civil rights demonstrations. They did it because of television, to a large degree. There had been demonstrations much earlier that were similar but never got as much attention, because there was no television. But people across the United States and across the world watched these demonstrations and watched in Alabama and in Georgia and in other places, and they were horrified. It made it almost impossible not for a President, at least not for a President like Kennedy, to respond. And he responded.\n\nHe was very worried about getting into civil rights because he thought, correctly, that he'd lose so many votes in the South and he had to get reelected. He tried his best to get away from the civil rights movement. When the March on Washington happened, Kennedy was terrified in some ways and he made all sorts of efforts to make sure that the March on Washington wouldn't be a march against the President. All sorts of efforts were made to make sure that nobody would say anything to criticize the President and that's, in fact, what happened; it worked. But it was very difficult for him to become a great person in the civil rights movement.\n\nThe civil rights leaders were very disappointed in him for quite some time. Iit wasn't until these terrible demonstrations began that he began to realize that he had to change, and he had to make himself be a leader of the civil rights movement. That's part of the growth that he had. Remember, he was a 43-year-old person when he became President and had not been much of a Senator or a Congressman. He started from nothing, almost, except a reputation. You could say the same thing about Obama, I guess.\n\nHe grew a lot. And that great speech he made, which he wrote in about an hour before he went on television, and about half of it he just ad libbed because he didn't have time to write, because it was so important to get this speech out so fast, that was a great moment in American history, I think. It made it possible for what happened afterwards and after his death. Without that, I think it would have been much harder for Johnson, or for anyone, to get the civil rights bill through. So that's one of the great achievements. Of course, Johnson should get a lot of the credit for this, too. He's the one who got it through.\n\nELLEN FITZPATRICK: It's hard to imagine, it's hard to disaggregate Kennedy's Presidency from the age of television.\n\nALAN BRINKLEY: Yeah, it really is.\n\nELLEN FITZPATRICK: He was catapulted into even seriousness as a contender when he was attempting to get the Vice Presidential nod in '56, and then the Kennedy/Nixon debates, as President the access that so many had to him as President. He was able to exert more leadership through his use of his press conferences, the speeches. He had a brilliant speechwriter as well. All of these things were critical. But it was a particular moment in the history of television where you also now have television as a pervasive force in American political life. How would he have fared in our current political culture?\n\nALAN BRINKLEY: Boy, I can't imagine what any politician would … It's hard to know why anyone would go into politics today.\n\nELLEN FITZPATRICK: It is.\n\nALAN BRINKLEY: Television was very powerful in the early '60s and '50s even but it was a fairly homogeneous television world, especially in the news. All of the nightly news was more or less the same. I shouldn't say that since my father was one of them, but [laughter] everybody got the same news.\n\nELLEN FITZPATRICK: It was different then.\n\nALAN BRINKLEY: Yeah, it was different.\n\nELLEN FITZPATRICK: Better.\n\nALAN BRINKLEY: Yes, there were the debates and all of the televised parts of the campaign, and so forth. Today, television is only a small part of the media that manages politics, the Internet, especially. Even the tiniest criticisms move across the world within minutes or seconds, and you think of these candidates and what they go through, and all the digging there is in these people, and the true things and made-up things. And it takes years to get through a campaign.\n\nJohn Kennedy announced his Presidential candidacy on the second day of 1960. Mitt Romney has been working on becoming President for almost eight years now, almost without stops. I think a lot of people feel as though the quality of the Presidents have declined. Every President has talents and wouldn't get there if they didn’t but I don't think any President, with the possible exception of Reagan for at least some part of the country, I don't think anybody but Kennedy, and maybe Reagan, I don't think anybody has left the kind of legacy that Kennedy has.\n\nThat's because people are so beat up in the Presidency; no matter what you do you're going to get beat up. A lot of people who might be great Presidents probably have decided not to try because of how difficult it is. So I do think that media has been a great boon in many ways, but it's also been a terror for politicians and for many other people.\n\nELLEN FITZPATRICK: The war with the press and the oppositional nature of it, vis-à-vis the President, also seems to be a variable. What is painstakingly constructed in the morning is torn down at night through the 24-hour news cycle and the nonstop analysis on CNN and Fox, and so forth. It's very hard to imagine a moment when you could have the positives and not have all of the negatives, the muckraking.\n\nALAN BRINKLEY: When I said the nightly news programs in the '60s, and actually even still today, are pretty much the same and they're not highly opinionated, but that's not what people watch so much anymore. If you took the three nightly news shows – ABC, NBC and CBS – and you put them all together, you put all of the audience together, that would be fewer viewers than any one of those three nightly news shows were in the '60s. That's how dispersed the audience for politics and news; it's spread out through Fox News and MSNBC. I could go on and on and on. People find their news wherever they want it, and they look for the news that they want. Places like Fox News give it to them, as do people on the left. It's a very tough world at this point to make a point without having to fight back against all sorts of things that get thrown at you if you're working in politics. Almost every level of politics has become much more difficult.\n\nELLEN FITZPATRICK: It seems that the fact that we knew there was the public face that we felt so familiar with about Kennedy and that was so attractive and appealing, and much of the private, more complicated elements of his life has been revealed after his death, that it seems always hard to put these pieces of the man together. I wondered, as you were doing this biography, how did you square this? You referred to him in your first chapter as the Irish Prince, which struck me as an oxymoron; I didn't know there were princes in Ireland.\n\nALAN BRINKLEY: [laughter]\n\nELLEN FITZPATRICK: I guess in a way you captured it perfectly. So what do you make of the man? On the one hand, our public image of him was as the devoted father and husband, and we had this sense of his family life. Then, later to find out that his private life was much more complicated than anyone would have imagined. He looked to be the picture of vitality and health, the youngest man elected to the Presidency and then we have an entire biography by Bob Dallek that explodes that idea by showing the struggle that he had throughout his life, which you talk at length about in your book as well, with his health. So how do we put it all together?\n\nALAN BRINKLEY: Well, it's true. When I teach in this period, I give a lecture on Kennedy and Johnson both. But when I write about Kennedy, I talk about the two Kennedys, the two John Kennedys – this graceful, charismatic person who is intelligent and interesting and hopeful, all the things that we admire about Kennedy; or at least what many people admire about Kennedy. Then, there's this dark part of Kennedy's life. I don't think there's any President who doesn't have a dark side. Lyndon Johnson certainly had one, and had the same sexual interests and he didn't get punished either. But everybody gets punished now.\n\nI think most Presidents have a lot of hidden things in their lives, John Kennedy maybe more than some, but you can understand it. This young man who grew up sick from birth, and he fought and fought and fought through his life as a child, as an adolescent, as a young man, being sick all the time, in hospitals all the time, terrible pain. Yet, he kept going, he kept fighting. He went to war. He was a hero. The heroism was perhaps exaggerated, but he was a hero. His PT boat was smashed and he carried this man for five hours to get to shore, to save his life.\n\nYou have to feel for this young man, who didn't know that he had Addison's disease; he just thought he had bad luck, he kept getting sick. Only when he was well into adulthood did they realize that cortisone could not stop Addison's disease, but make it possible to work. Then, even after that, after all the treatments he'd gotten and all the steroids he'd taken, his spine was weakened and he had this terrible back pain throughout his life. He wore these trusses that held his back up. I feel as though Kennedy should get the …His sexual life is nobody's business, really, although it's obviously part of history as well. Lots of Presidents have similar weaknesses, I think.\n\nELLEN FITZPATRICK: You mentioned at the end of your book that Kennedy remains a very powerful figure in our national imagination. I was watching just the other day, with my mother who's 90 years old, some footage of Kennedy's Presidency and she was looking at the computer screen and she said, \"It makes you wonder what might have been, what would have happened.\" Is it the incompleteness, the glass half-full/glass half-empty nature, his death, violent death in office that brings us back continually?\n\nALAN BRINKLEY: Well, it's hard to know how important his death was because we don't know how important a President he would have been had he lived. What most Presidents want to do is pass bills and make change. Kennedy may have done that if he lived, but he didn't live long enough to do very much of that.\n\nI don't think, however, that any one person could have stopped what happened in the '60s. The civil rights movement is one example, the emergence of the antiwar movement, and many other movements. I don't want to go into great depth about this, but I've always believed that the postwar era made it impossible for the world that came out of World War II. It couldn't survive that sort of staid world, that people didn't complain so much. I think no matter who was President, it was going to be a rocky time in the '60s and '70s.\n\nPresidents are very important, but they can't change the world, or it's very hard for a President to change the world. The world was changing a lot, even while Kennedy was alive. Had he lived through his second term by 1968, he would have gone through a lot by then. Presidents can't do everything; you hope that they do something.\n\nI think Kennedy was a good President. The thing I find most extraordinary about Kennedy is how important he seemed to so many people. When polls were taken in the early '60s, when Kennedy was still alive and people were asked, \"Did you vote for Kennedy or not?,\" well, the actual percentage of people who voted for Kennedy in 1960 was about 49%. The polls showed, while he was still alive, about 65% of the people said they had voted for him. After he died, over 70% of people said they had voted for him.\n\nELLEN FITZPATRICK: He won in a landslide!\n\nALAN BRINKLEY: [laughter] Yeah, a posthumous landslide. There was something about Kennedy that made him important. A lot of it was what Kennedy did, but it was also what people did for him, in a way, things that they assumed he would do or did do. And it helped him, actually, while he was alive, this enormous popularity. Even when he supported the civil rights bill and the civil rights movement and lost a lot of support in the South, he still had a 60% approval rating. That was one of his lowest. Very few Presidents get that kind of attention, that kind of popularity.\n\nELLEN FITZPATRICK: In a way, his Presidency may have been a foreshadowing of what was coming later in the '60s and the kind of divisions that he confronted and tenuously attempted to heal.\n\nThis seems like a good point to ask our audience if you have questions for Alan Brinkley. We've got a microphone here.\n\nALAN BRINKLEY: For either of us.\n\nELLEN FITZPATRICK: Feel free to come forward and ask.\n\nQUESTION: I have not read your book, so I'm at somewhat of a disadvantage. I would like to know: Kennedy and Nixon came to Congress as two veterans of World War II. Certainly, you could not have created two more different candidates if you had written a novel about them. In your research, what did you think Kennedy's perception of Nixon was? I mean, not just the political opponent, but I mean on a personal, one-to-one basis. Did he like him? Did he feel neutral to him? Was he antagonized by him? And the other question … Should it be only one question per person?\n\nELLEN FITZPATRICK: Go ahead.\n\nQUESTION: Okay, the other question: One of the things that got Kennedy to national prominence was a labor investigation that was started in part by reporters like Clark Mollenhoff, which brought him into the controversy with Jimmy Hoffa and the teamsters' union, which was not a popular thing for a Democrat. I'd like you to comment on how that brought him to national attention and the effect that it had on the long term.\n\nELLEN FITZPATRICK: The first one was Nixon and Kennedy.\n\nALAN BRINKLEY: Well, I don't really know how Kennedy felt about Nixon. Of course, when they were both running for President, they probably had a certain amount of hatred of each other, as I suspect candidates usually do. Kennedy and Nixon were on reasonably good terms in the Congress and in the Senate. Kennedy was somewhat more conservative than when we now think about him. They weren't good friends, but I think, except during campaigns, I think they got along reasonably well. After the election, he went to Nixon a number of times to ask for advice, especially when he was in trouble. I think he thought that Nixon was an intelligent person who could help him. And of course, he was an intelligent person who could help. So I think there was a pretty decent relationship between the two, but I don't know a lot about that relationship.\n\nAnd the second is the labor issues. That was mostly Robert Kennedy who was trying to get Hoffa. This was probably his most important effort, putting aside his relationship with his brother. This was a kind of ugly effort, I think, to get this guy who certainly could easily have been doing lots of illegal things, but lots of people in the unions have problems. Somehow he focused on Hoffa.\n\nThere's something about it that I've always felt uncomfortable, and maybe other people don't feel that way, but I felt at the time – not at the time, I was too young -- but when I think about Hoffa and the way in which Robert Kennedy went after him and eventually destroyed him, you find somebody you want to get like that, you can always do it. In a democracy, it just doesn't feel comfortable to me, that a powerful figure like the Attorney General would put all of his efforts into getting one person. So I find that a dark part of the Kennedy efforts, although, as I say, this is more Robert Kennedy than Jack Kennedy.\n\nQUESTION: Alan, you mentioned the American University speech, which I think was June\n\n10th, '63.\n\nALAN BRINKLEY: I'll take your word for it.\n\nQUESTION: Because I think it's the day before the June 11th civil rights speech, which always struck me as one hell of a week for Kennedy. When I think about the hopefulness, it seems to me that a lot of the hopefulness of Kennedy's legacy comes from those two back-to-back speeches. I was wondering a little bit about where that June 10th speech came from, that American University speech.\n\nALAN BRINKLEY: I don't think that they were that close together. The American University speech and then shortly after that was the Berlin speech, and then I think it was a little later.\n\nELLEN FITZPATRICK: I don't remember.\n\nALAN BRINKLEY: I can't remember. But anyway, that's not the important thing. Those three speeches are probably the most remembered speeches of his life, not including his inaugural address. For me, the great speech of his Presidency was the civil rights speech which is strange, because it was cobbled together so fast and almost ad libbed. But it was a great speech and it made the civil rights movement something that it hadn't been before.\n\nI don't really want to move into the present too much, but think about Obama talking about gay marriage. It wasn't even a speech, it was an interview. But think about the ripples that came out of that. So much more ripples came out of the civil rights movement and had so much more, at least so far, had so much more impact on the nation.\n\nI think the American University speech was a great speech, too. It didn't get much attention at the time. The person who liked it the most was Khrushchev. People here, well, they thought it was good, but they didn't really understand the importance of it. Except for a lot of conservative, militaristic people, who thought this was a terrible speech. I thought it was a great speech.\n\nThe Berlin speech, which is probably his most famous speech – and it was a great speech, with hundreds of thousands of people listening to him. You can't get a kind of response like that anywhere, almost. But I don't really like that speech. It's a kind of belligerent speech, and it comes after a speech in which he tried to smooth the Cold War. And there he was, standing by the Berlin Wall as a cold warrior to the death. All of these are great speeches, but I think the ones that I find important are the civil rights speech especially and also the American University speech.\n\nQUESTION: Just to follow up quickly, is there any particular event or discussion that leads to that American University speech? Because it seems so different than so many of the cold warrior kinds of speeches to me.\n\nALAN BRINKLEY: Well, I think in the aftermath of the Cuban Missile Crisis, I think that had a tremendous impact on him and he realized what could happen if you can't work for peace.\n\nThat's, I think, what made him do that speech.\n\nQUESTION: That's my guess, too. Okay, thanks.\n\nELLEN FITZPATRICK: The civil rights speech, it seems to me that Kennedy had to have been the first American President to condemn segregation as a moral wrong. I don't think that Truman ever did.\n\nALAN BRINKLEY: Well, certainly the first President to do it, the first President to do it on television, yeah.\n\nQUESTION: Earlier in the discussion, I believe you made a comment that there were a number of people who would have made great Presidents who chose not to run because they would have been gobbled up by the media. I wonder if you could name three or four of those. [laughter] I just think it's easy to say that statement; I'd like to hear you back it up.\n\nALAN BRINKLEY: [laughter] I don't want to answer that.\n\nQUESTION: Okay, that's fine.\n\nALAN BRINKLEY: You never know who's going to be a great President before you see him trying to be President.\n\nQUESTION: Well, you made the comment; I just was following up. Secondly, do you believe there's enough circumstantial evidence out there to debunk the single assassin theory? Do you think that there were people within our government who did not want John Kennedy to do what some of us believe he was about to do?\n\nALAN BRINKLEY: I'm an agnostic on conspiracy theories of the assassination. I don't think that the Warren Commission was done in a way that would have made the world feel that this was a single person. That doesn't mean it wasn't a single person. Most of the conspiracy theories don't really have the evidence that I would think at least would prove a conspiracy. I don't know.\n\nAs I say, I'm sort of an agnostic on this.\n\nA lot of the conspiracy theories, I think, are just ridiculous. But there are some possible ones and I don't want to talk about them too much. But I'll tell you, as I said earlier, I think there's a line running from Cuba to Dallas. Whether that had anything to do with the assassination, I don't know. But you start with the Bay of Pigs, which was at the very beginning of his Presidency, and then there's Operation Mongoose that keeps interfering with Cuba over the years. Then, there's the Cuban Missile Crisis, and then there's Lee Harvey Oswald, who lives in Russia for a while, then moves to Cuba, and then moves to Dallas.\n\nSo is that a conspiracy? I don't know. If it's only Lee Harvey Oswald, why did he do it? Well, I don't think the Warren Commission really made an effort to decide why he did it. Of course, he died within days, so we'll never know. But my guess is that it's very possible that he chose to kill John Kennedy because of Cuba, because he believed in it. So that's one way you could think of a conspiracy that might hold up, although there's no evidence to back it up. But I don't have an answer, except that I think this is going to be an issue that people are going to worry about for many years; already have thought about for many years.\n\nQUESTION: While you were writing and researching the book, did your opinion about any fact or any aspect of Kennedy's life or Presidency change from when you started to write it and to research it, to when you had completed it? Did you discover anything new or did any of your opinions or perceptions change as a result of your extensive research?\n\nALAN BRINKLEY: Well, a lot of people have done a lot more intensive research than I have.\n\nBut I did do quite a bit of research. I'll tell you what I found most interesting that I wouldn't have thought about and that was the process by which John Kennedy, who started out wanting nothing to do with race and civil rights and who ended up being a great champion of civil rights, and that's a part of Kennedy that … I'm certainly not the first person to say this, but the way in which he avoided civil rights was something that I hadn't really understood, that he was so frightened of what too much effort to promote civil rights would, I think, damage his reelection.\n\nI'll just give you an example. This is not something that's new. People who read about Kennedy a lot know all of these things more clearly than I do. But there was a big event at the White House, I can't remember what year, when it was. It was 1963, I think, or early '62. And it was the centennial of what?\n\nELLEN FITZPATRICK: The Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nALAN BRINKLEY: The Emancipation Proclamation, yeah. There was a big event in the White House for African Americans to come into the White House to celebrate this great event. They were required to go around the back of the White House and go into the White House there so that people looking at the White House from the front wouldn't see all these African Americans going into the White House. They didn't take any pictures that could be printed.\n\nWhen Sammy Davis, Jr. came with his Swedish wife, he told Jacqueline Kennedy to get her out of there because it was a mixed couple, something that nobody I think would really understand today. But in the early '60s, the idea of black and white people living together was a scandal. He told his wife, \"Get them out of here.\" She burst into tears and left. I don't think they left, but it gives you a sense of how sensitive that issue was for politicians and particularly for Kennedy, I guess.\n\nThat gave me a different feeling about how important it was for the civil rights movement to put pressure on people to get the civil rights movement to move. Kennedy eventually got on board, but it wasn't easy. Many people think of him as a great champion of civil rights -- and he became such a person -- but it was the becoming that was so difficult.\n\nQUESTION: Sir, you were talking earlier about the what-ifs of the Kennedy Presidency, and I guess I think a lot about that -- if it poured rain that day in Dallas and he served a second term. I guess in your research what were some of the things he had hoped to accomplish in a second term? What do you think his post-Presidential years perhaps would have been like?\n\nALAN BRINKLEY: Most of what Lyndon Johnson did in 1963 and '64 were the things that John Kennedy wanted to do. John Kennedy, as I said earlier, had very little success in legislation, and no reason to think that in 1964 or even 1965, if he had been reelected, there was no reason to feel that it would be easy to get the civil rights bills passed.\n\nSo we know what Kennedy wanted to do. Whether he could have gotten it done, I don't know. I've always thought that Kennedy was the person who created – or maybe didn't create necessarily -- but the person who created the agenda; Johnson made it happen. Now, if Kennedy had lived, maybe he would have become a better person in getting things through Congress. But you have to admit that nobody was a better legislator than Lyndon Johnson; probably the most powerful legislator of our time.\n\nELLEN FITZPATRICK: I think that Caro's book shows the extent to which Kennedy's death itself became a lever …\n\nALAN BRINKLEY: Absolutely.\n\nELLEN FITZPATRICK: … empowering Johnson. Whether Johnson would have been able to\n\nget a civil rights bill passed in 1964 without the death of Kennedy seems highly doubtful. I think we have time for one more question. Sir?\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. Professor, I should preface this question by saying I was fortunate enough to take a couple of your classes one time in Cambridge, and it remains a highlight of my academic life.\n\nALAN BRINKLEY: Thank you.\n\nQUESTION: This is not meant to sound anti-Harvard, but given our setting here this evening in Boston, I have to think of the remark, apocryphal or not, that Robert Frost made, or the advice he offered, \"always stay more Irish than Harvard.\" In your research, did you get any sense of how important or unimportant the President's heritage was to him. There was the trip to Ireland, of course, but beyond those sort of public gestures, were you able to get a sense of how important he considered that history in his family to be?\n\nALAN BRINKLEY: Of course, there are lots of things about John Kennedy that remind you of his Irishness – the big family, the close family; the places where they lived, at least for a short time; his mother, who was very Irish and very Catholic. But when you think about people that you identify as Irish, I think for the most part John Kennedy's not one of them, at least in my view. He lived not in the way most Irish people lived, even in the '60s, even when so many Irish people were rising up. The Kennedy family was different from almost any other Irish family in that era.\n\nJack Kennedy, he didn't talk about being Irish very much. He didn't seem very Irish, particularly. Of course, he knew he was Irish, and he was, I'm sure, proud of it, but I don't think it was a big part of his life.\n\nThe 1960 campaign is a good example of this. The Irish part of Kennedy also includes the Catholic part of Kennedy, and it was the Catholic part of Kennedy that was the problem that he had when he was running for President. When he fought back against that, he fought back, and indirectly he was fighting back not just against the sense that Catholicism was going to control him, but it also meant that his Irishness was sort of less than what many other Irish people would think. So I think his Irishness is certainly a part of him, but I think he was a cosmopolitan figure. Even though I called him the Irish Prince [laughter] in one of my chapters, I don't think of him as being primarily Irish, but that's just my view.\n\nELLEN FITZPATRICK: Perhaps if people had known more about his private life, they would have been less worried about his Catholicism in 1960 [laughter] than they turned out to be. But these are the inevitable observations. Thank you, Alan. Your book is really wonderful, and we're grateful to have had a chance to talk to you.\n\nALAN BRINKLEY: Well, thank you, Ellen, and thank you for joining us, and thank all of you for coming. [applause]\n\nTHE END"
