        "text": "TRANSCRIPT\n\n('The Lonesome Road' song) - Sammy was driving down the road and two women coming in the other direction rammed into him and he fell and hit the post and knocked his eye out.\n\n- You know, Sammy's in this horrible car accident and he gets out of the car and his hand, he has his eye in his hand and he wakes up in a hospital.\n\nAnd his eyes are both covered.\n\n- Well, I got a call at three in the morning, and I hired a plane and flew there fast.\n\nAnd all I did was sit with him for seven days.\n\nNever left his room.\n\n- Sammy, as he relates in his autobiography, had a number of conversations with various rabbis, one was serendipitous, was a rabbi visiting in the hospital after his accident.\n\n- After I had the accident, I came out and I needed something desperately to hold onto, right?\n\nFound myself being more and more convinced that Judaism was it for me.\n\nI know that there is sort of a kinship between the plight of the Negro and the plight of the Jew.\n\nThe oppression, the segregation, the constant trying to survive and the trying to achieve dignity.\n\nMy mother was a Catholic, my father was a Baptist.\n\nAnd then I became, sort of, nothing for a while.\n\nAnd I looked around, I was really shopping for something to believe in because I, see, when you're a performer, you deal in such intangibles, that you need a religion to hold on to.\n\nYou really do.\n\n- [Female] He lost an eye in the accident and I think it was very traumatic.\n\n- It was tough, period. Tough.\n\nYou have to learn to rebalance your whole life, no less, what's happening here in your brain.\n\n- [Male] How do you recalibrate the way you see, the way you move?"
