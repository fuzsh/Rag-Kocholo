Early Life[]

Sammy was born in New York City as an only child to African-American entertainer Sammy Davis, Sr. and tap dancer Elvera Sanchez,[1]. During his lifetime, Davis, Jr. stated that his mother was Puerto Rican and born in San Juan, Puerto Rico; however, in the 2003 biography In Black and White, author Wil Haygood writes that Davis, Jr.'s mother was born in New York City to Cuban American parents, and that Davis, Jr. claimed he was Puerto Rican because he feared anti-Cuban backlash would hurt his record sales.[2][3][4]

Sammy started as a child vaudevillian who became known for his performances on Broadway and Las Vegas. He went on to become a world famous recording artist, television and film star. Davis was also a member of Frank Sinatra's "Rat Pack". At the age of three Davis began his career in vaudeville with his father and Will Mastin as the Will Mastin Trio, toured nationally, and after military service, returned to the trio.

Davis' career slowed in the late sixties, but he had a hit record with "The Candy Man", in 1972, and became a star in Las Vegas earning him the nickname Mister Show Business.[5][6][7]

Political Views and Philanthropy[]

As an African American, Davis was the victim of racism throughout his life, and was a large financial supporter of civil rights causes. Davis had a complex relationship with the African-American community, and attracted criticism after physically embracing Richard Nixon in 1972. One day on a golf course with Jack Benny, he was asked what his handicap was. "Handicap?" he asked. "Talk about handicap—I'm a one-eyed Negro Jew."[8][9] This was to become a signature comment, recounted in his autobiography, and in countless articles.[10] This was to become a signature comment, recounted in his autobiography, and in countless articles.[10] After reuniting with Sinatra and Dean Martin in 1987, Davis toured with them and Liza Minnelli internationally, before dying of throat cancer in 1990.
