        "text": "Singapore: The Vatican has revealed it disciplined and placed restrictions on the Nobel Prize-winning former head of the Roman Catholic church in East Timor after receiving allegations that he sexually abused boys during the country’s independence struggle in the 1990s.\n\nSouth-east Asia’s newest nation has been rocked by the claims against Bishop Carlos Felipe Ximenes Belo, which were made in a report this week by Dutch news magazine De Groene Amsterdammer.\n\nReacting to the publication of the allegations, the Vatican said in a statement it had taken action against Belo, who is now 74 and living in Portugal, when it became aware of the claims two years ago.\n\nReuters reported Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said in his statement that the Vatican’s doctrinal office, which handles sex abuse cases, first became involved in the matter in 2019 in “light of the accusations it received concerning the bishop’s behaviour”.\n\nThe Vatican imposed disciplinary restrictions the following year, it said, including “limitations to his movements and to the exercise of his ministry”, a ban on voluntary contact with minors and in having any contact with East Timor.\n\nThe sanctions were “modified and reinforced,” Bruni said, but did not provide details. Belo “formally accepted” the restrictions, the Vatican spokesman said.\n\nThe Dutch magazine quoted two men who alleged that as teenagers, between the ages of 14 and 16, they were sexually abused by Belo at his residence in Dili and then paid money by the bishop.\n\n“He knows that the boys have no money. So when he invited you, you came over and gave you some money,” the report quoted one of the alleged victims as saying. “But meanwhile you are a victim. That’s the way he did.”\n\nBelo, 74, a revered figure in deeply Catholic East Timor who shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 1996 with current Timorese President Jose Ramos-Horta, hung up the phone immediately when approached by the magazine for comment.\n\nBut the allegations contained in the report would be investigated by the Vatican, said Marco Sprizzi, its representative in East Timor.\n\n“Pope Francis is so much engaged in zero tolerance so no doubt after an article like that, they are investigating and they will investigate deeply,” he told The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age. “I’m sure 100 per cent of that.”\n\nBelo became a Timorese hero during the Indonesian occupation and was awarded the Nobel Prize for his non-violent resistance.\n\nIn September 1999, he was evacuated on an RAAF plane to Darwin as pro-Indonesia militia attacked his home, where 5000 people had sought refuge from violence in the aftermath of the East Timor independence vote.\n\nHe returned to Dili before resigning from his post with the church, citing health reasons, in 2002, and leaving to work as an assistant priest in Mozambique.\n\nLast December, East Timor was shaken by the trial of defrocked American priest Richard Daschbach, who was found guilty of child sex abuse and sentenced to 12 years in jail.\n\nDaschbach, who was believed by his followers to have special powers, abused children at the shelter he ran for girls and boys in the western Timorese enclave of Oecusse for more than two decades.\n\nThe controversy surrounding his case was heightened by support shown to him from former East Timor president and prime minister Xanana Gusmao.\n\nSprizzi, the Vatican envoy in Dili, said on Thursday the church in East Timor had not been approached by victims alleging abuse by Belo but took such claims very seriously.\n\n“I can say that no victim ever appeared here, otherwise I would have known more,” he said.\n\nLoading\n\n“The church in Timor-Leste in the last six months approved the guidelines for the protection of minors after a deep study of other guidelines in other countries including Australia and the United States.\n\n“The church is very much engaged now in the protection of minors and if any victims would have appeared, they are obliged, bishops and everybody, to receive, to protect to encourage them, also to denounce [the abuse]. This is the present attitude of the church in Timor-Leste.”\n\nOf East Timor’s population of 1.3 million people, 97 per cent are Catholic."
