In this capacity he has had the opportunity to consult on various occasions with Bishop Belo, whose wisdom and commitment to peace and human rights has won him the respect of his people and of the international community. Both Bishop Belo and Mr. Ramos-Horta have participated actively in the All-Inclusive Intra-East Timorese Dialogue facilitated by the Secretary-General.\n\nThe Secretary-General hopes that this award will positively affect the continuing negotiations in the search for a lasting settlement.\n\n* *** *"
