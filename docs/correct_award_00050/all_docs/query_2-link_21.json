        "text": "LONDON -- A remote regions bloody but often forgotten struggle against a harsh\n\nregime received international recognition Friday when two champions of East\n\nTimors resistance to Indonesian rule won the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nCarlos Filipe Ximenes Belo, East Timors Roman Catholic bishop, and Jose\n\nRamos-Horta, who had ties to the islands guerrilla movement and is now an\n\nexiled publicist for the cause, joined a long list of dissidents whose naming\n\nas laureates dramatically magnified world awareness of their efforts and put\n\npressure on governments.\n\nIndonesia invaded East Timor -- at the eastern tip of the vast Malay\n\narchipelago -- in 1975, shortly after Portugal abandoned its colonial rule\n\nthere. Despite fervent opposition by East Timors residents, Indonesia annexed\n\nthe territory a year later, an action never recognized by the United Nations\n\nor by any nation other than Australia.\n\nHuman rights groups said as many as 200,000 people were killed during the\n\noccupation and the fighting and famine that followed, and Indonesia has beaten\n\ndown most resistance since in clashes ranging from a civil war to sporadic\n\nstreet demonstrations. Elements of the resistance have relied on violence as\n\nwell, but with little effect on the Indonesian forces.\n\nThe award by the Nobel Committee in Oslo, Norway, confers greater legitimacy\n\non a movement that Indonesia has labeled as illegitimate, insignificant,\n\nunrepresentative of the East Timorese population and prone to wild\n\nexaggeration of human rights abuses.\n\n(End of published text\n\nThe award citation said Belo has been the foremost representative of the\n\npeople of East Timor. At the risk of his own life, he has tried to protect his\n\npeople from infringement by those in power. In his efforts to create a just\n\nsettlement based on his peoples right to self-determination, he has been a\n\nconstant spokesman for nonviolence and dialogue with the Indonesian\n\nauthorities.\n\nThe committee cited Ramos-Horta for having been the leading international\n\nspokesman for East Timors cause since 1975, who recently has made a\n\nsignificant contribution by striving for reconciliation talks and a peace\n\nplan for the area.\n\nOfficial Indonesian reaction reflected the governments displeasure. Foreign\n\nMinister Ali Alatas, on a visit to Hamburg, Germany, said he was\n\nastounded, particularly by the choice of Ramos-Horta, whom he described as\n\na political adventurist. Recalling previous Nobel laureates Nelson Mandela\n\nof South Africa and Yasser Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization,\n\nAlatas said, I wonder what effect it will have on the value of earlier Nobel\n\nPeace Prizes given to such illustrious people like Mr. Mandela and Mr. Arafat\n\nwho have brought peace to real conflicts.\n\nThe military deputy governor of East Timor said he does not take Nobel\n\nprizes seriously... . This is just a conscience massage for the liberal West.\n\nIt is just one of those things. The Nobel prizes are like the Oscars, and, as\n\nwith Hollywood, they are partly removed from reality.\n\nBut Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio-whose country has provided refuge for\n\nmany East Timorese dissidents-called the award a wonderful surprise that\n\nreflects the pairs indefatigable work in the service of human rights and\n\npeace in the territory.\n\nOver the years, the East Timorese resistance has become divided between those\n\nseeking complete independence and those willing to settle for a degree of\n\npolitical and cultural autonomy.\n\nBishop Belo, 48, advocates nonviolent self-determination and has a large\n\nfollowing among ordinary East Timorese, in part because of his church\n\nleadership, in part because of his courage in continuing to speak out in Dili\n\n-- the territorys principal city -- in the face of Indonesian repression. He\n\ntold the Reuter news agency today that it would have been better that I had\n\nnot won. It makes my responsibilities heavier.\n\nHis influence in advocating a peaceful resolution, according to analysts of\n\nthe region, has limited the sway of more militant East Timorese, though he has\n\nnot minced words about the situation there. Belo also has prevented violence\n\nby inserting himself between security forces and demonstrators, according to\n\nArnold Kohen, a U.S. consultant who is completing a biography of the bishop.\n\nIn a 1994 interview with Britains New Statesman and Society, Belo described\n\nlife in the territory as a nightmare of oppression, and cited the 1991 attack\n\non a gathering at Dilis Santa Cruz cemetery in which critics said 200 people\n\ndied.\n\nI would say we live as if under the old Soviet Union regime, he said,\n\naccusing President Suhartos government of brutally suppressing Catholicism as\n\npart of its effort to integrate largely Roman Catholic East Timor with\n\nIndonesia, the worlds largest Islamic nation.\n\nRamos-Horta, 51, has been traveling the world from his base in Sydney\n\nadvocating East Timorese independence, although recently he has called for\n\nfive to 10 years of self-rule, followed by a plebiscite on the independence\n\nquestion. He served as foreign minister for a short-lived East Timor\n\ngovernment.\n\nFriday, while expressing gratitude for the prize, he told the Portuguese news\n\nagency Lusa that the Nobel should have gone to our true leader, Xanana\n\nGusmao, the jailed chief of a still active band of guerrilla fighters. He was\n\ncaptured in 1992 by Indonesian security forces.\n\nRamos-Horta has been criticized by some in his own movement for what they\n\nconsider an excessively rich international lifestyle.\n\nAmong the previous dissidents who have received the Nobel Peace Prize are\n\nAndrei Sakharov, Soviet physicist and human rights campaigner (1975; Lech\n\nWalesa, leader of Polands Solidarity Union and later president of the country\n\n(1983; Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa (1984; and Burmese\n\nopposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi (1991. Last year, the recipient was Joseph\n\nRotblat and the Pugwash Conference on Science and World Affairs.\n\nPHOTOS: BELO: Catholic bishop. RAMOS-HORTA: Activist."
