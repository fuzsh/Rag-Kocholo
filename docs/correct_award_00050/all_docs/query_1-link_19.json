        "text": "On 29 December 1996, the government of Guatemala and the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca signed a comprehensive peace accord ending the country’s 36-year-old civil war (see the essay by Rachel M. McCleary on pp. 129–43 above). On the occasion of the signing of the accord, Guatemalan president Alvaro Arzú spoke at the National Palace in Guatemala City. Excerpts from his speech appear below:\n\nNow is the time for peace, now is the time for peace for Guatemala. Part of our mission and our promises materialized today, and our commitment to the future of our people and our region was consolidated. Today we came to say: Mission accomplished! And at the same time, to point out with responsibility and realism and with joy and enthusiasm how much more we still must do.\n\nToday a chapter of our history ended and we started to write another—perhaps a more difficult one, but a more encouraging and promising one. We have reached the formal moment of a transition, of a change, of a new phase. The heart of each Guatemalan harbors today many intense emotions, including feelings of the most diverse kinds…. There is the consoling relief of the definitive banishment of barbarism, and there is also the the hope for a future of prosperity and harmony. [End Page 186] Hopes for what is ahead are infused with the joy of having at last made official the definitive end of the internal armed struggle that for 36 years ripped open the very heart of our nation. . . .\n\nToday, the widow, the crippled, the orphan are pursing their lips with mixed emotions while recalling the images of the pain suffered and the window of hope that is now opening up to them. . . . Although these personal, family, or community wounds will take very long to heal, we must all, as a society, take this time to forgive in order to move forward. . . . It is also clear that forgiveness does not mean that we will forget. It is one thing to forgive, in order to move forward with a positive and fraternal spirit along a path to rebuild our damaged society, and it is another thing to forget. We cannot forget, we must not forget. Besides being inhumane, this would also constitute an abuse of a people’s identity. As a people who are seeking reconciliation, we need to maintain memory of our full history intact. . . . We cannot ask an entire people to be born again . . . without a past or history. We must overcome our pain, our sufferings, and our fratricidal tragedy to move on and to redirect our energies to what is coming. And perhaps it is worth recalling that our cultural traditions—both Mayan and Judaeo-Christian—are based on the memory of good and evil.\n\nWe also recognize that this exercise of granting forgiveness without forgetting does not overlook or avoid justice. This fact was reflected in . . . the recently approved Reconciliation Law. As far as we know, this is the first time in Latin America that the causes of an internal conflict are not resolved through a full amnesty that closes the doors to complaints of abuses that may have been committed. . . .\n\nWe have officially signed peace today before all Guatemalans. This peace is, above all, our peace. It was not imposed on us by anyone. Contributions may be made from outside to complement the internal efforts of a people to develop their own ability to understand one another. . . . No one, however, absolutely no one, may impose on any people from outside a true and stable peace if that people do not want it, and if that people do not manage to consolidate from within, and on their own, their own internal reconciliation.\n\nFirm and lasting peace is not an instantaneous change that is achieved as if by magic; it is not a photographic moment that is captured when the camera button is pressed. It is not an automatic change of realities obtained by decree. The peace agreements represent a set of complex and comprehensive commitments that contain a formidable national program. That is true, but in order to turn this into reality we need the active participation of the entire Guatemalan society, as well as their courageous and permanent work. The agreements are a promise and a commitment, and thus we must be prepared for a long process in which there will be no miracles, but only modest and progressive achievement based on work shared by everyone. . . ."
