        "text": "Congressional Press Releases\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:\n\nOctober 11, 1996\n\nCONTACT: Jennifer Francis (202) 224-5323\n\nFEINGOLD PRAISES WINNERS OF NOBEL PEACE PRIZE Says Award to East Timor Human Rights Advocates Will Advance Cause\n\nU.S. Senator Russ Feingold, who has long championed the cause of East Timor in its struggles against Indonesia, hailed the award of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize to Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo and another East Timor activist, Jose Ramos-Horta.\n\nFeingold said, \"I have long admired Bishop Belo for his courage, fortitude and wisdom. For more than 20 years, East Timor has endured a brutal occupation by the Indonesian military. To the people who have suffered from violence and oppression, Bishop Belo has been a leader, a mentor and a voice for those who have been silenced. Today's award of the Nobel Peace Prize will give Bishop Belo and the people of East Timor, the attention they deserve and will hopefully amplify their voices in their struggle against Indonesia.\"\n\nFeingold has repeatedly urged the Clinton Administration to take a stronger stance with regard to the Indonesian oppression against the people of East Timor and has authored legislation to restrict the sale of U.S-military equipment to Indonesian until improvements are made in human rights conditions on East Timor. \"I hope that the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize award will help motivate our own government to begin to recognize that the situation in East Timor is intolerable and that we can not continue to look the other way while this oppression continues,\" Feingold said.\n\nReturn to Congressional Action on East Timor: Statements, etc."
