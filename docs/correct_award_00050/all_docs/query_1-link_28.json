If he lives long, his name will be more glorious than a thousand others, and if he dies, that will satisfy him just as well” (Wisdom 39, 10-11)\n\n“… it expresses with deep significance the memory of the man we remember this day whose esteemed Peace Prize bears his name. Today, 10th December, we celebrate the centennial anniversary of the death of a wise benefactor of humanity, a peace worker, Alfred Nobel.” - Nobel Lecture, Nobel foundation.\n\nNobel Prize Cash & Philanthropy\n\nCarlos Filipe Ximenes Belo stated that the Nobel Prize awarded to him was not only for him but for all his people, the East Timorese.
