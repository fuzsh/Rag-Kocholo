        "text": "(born 1948). Carlos Belo, a Roman Catholic bishop of Dili, shared the 1996 Nobel Prize for Peace with José Ramos-Horta for their efforts to bring peace to East Timor (Timor Timur) during the period that it was under Indonesian control (1975–99).\n\nCarlos Filipe Ximenes Belo was born on February 3, 1948, in Wailacama, East Timor. He attended secondary school at a Roman Catholic seminary. When he was 23 Belo left East Timor to continue his studies in Portugal. He entered the School of Theological Studies in Lisbon and began to prepare for the priesthood. In 1973, he became a novice. The next year he returned home to East Timor for a year of practical training.\n\nIn 1974 the Portuguese began to withdraw from East Timor because of a revolution in their own country. Many Timorese rejoiced, believing this to be their long-awaited chance to create an independent nation. However, in December 1975 Indonesian forces landed in Dili. Just a few months later, Indonesia proclaimed East Timor to be its 27th province.\n\nBelo left for Macau in 1975 to obtain more religious education. He studied theology from 1976 to 1979 at a university in Lisbon and was ordained into the priesthood in July 1980. He received a bachelor’s degree in theology in 1981 from Salesian Pontifical University in Rome. He returned to live in East Timor in July of that year.\n\nHe found the country much altered since he had left it. War, disease, and war-induced famine had left between 100,000 and 200,000 people dead since the Indonesian invasion. Soldiers randomly raped, beat, tortured, and murdered the East Timorese. People could not travel or speak or gather freely, and dismembered corpses were displayed after government massacres to remind people to stay in line.\n\nBelo was a soft-spoken man with no intention of becoming a political figure, but he identified strongly with the people of his native land and was horrified by the way their human rights were trampled upon. He began his work in East Timor at Fatumaca College and was named its director in 1983. That same year, he was appointed apostolic administrator of Dili. Five years later, he was consecrated as a bishop and began reporting directly to the Vatican.\n\nIn February 1989 he wrote to the secretary-general of the United Nations (UN) explaining the situation in East Timor and asking for attention and support from the international community. He continued to write pastoral letters describing life in East Timor and calling for recognition of the human rights of the East Timorese by the Indonesian authorities. His work led to several proclamations issued by the UN that criticized Indonesia and embarrassed its leaders.\n\nIndonesia responded to Belo with death threats and an assassination attempt in 1989. Belo’s life was constantly in danger. Despite the threats, Belo advocated strict nonviolence among his large following. He sought ways to compromise with the Indonesian government and tried to position himself as a mediator rather than a rebel leader. Belo asked for humane treatment and some degree of autonomy for the people of East Timor, which was more than 90 percent Roman Catholic within predominantly Muslim Indonesia.\n\nIn 1991 Indonesian security forces opened fire on a group that had gathered at a cemetery to mourn the death of a student who had been killed by the police. The unprovoked slaughter of hundreds of peacefully congregating people pushed Belo into the spotlight again. He called loudly for an inquiry into the massacre and succeeded in getting two military generals fired. As a result, another assassination attempt was made against him. Belo’s home was generally surrounded by intelligence agents, and he was followed wherever he went.\n\nIn 1996 the Indonesian government criticized the choice of Belo and Ramos-Horta for the Nobel Peace Prize, and some feared Belo would not be allowed back into the country if he traveled to Norway to accept the award. However, Belo accepted the prize in Oslo and returned home without incident.\n\nBelo was the first Roman Catholic bishop to receive a Nobel Peace Prize. The Vatican, Portugal, and the UN praised the Nobel committee’s decision and expressed hope that it would help bring an end to Indonesian authoritarian rule in East Timor. Belo had proposed in 1994 that the Indonesian government allow East Timor to conduct a democratic referendum on self-determination; that referendum, held in 1999, paved the way for East Timor’s independence in 2002."
