Born in 1948, Bishop Belo became the Bishop of Dili, the capital of East Timor, in 1983.\n\nDuring Indonesia's occupation of East Timor, which lasted from 1975 to 1999, Bishop Belo emerged as a courageous voice for the Timorese people. He spoke out against human rights abuses, provided sanctuary to those seeking refuge, and tirelessly campaigned for East Timor's right to self-determination.\n\nIn 1996, Bishop Belo was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, along with José Ramos-Horta, for their efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution to the conflict in East Timor. The award recognized his unwavering commitment to promoting dialogue, reconciliation, and non-violence in the face of oppression.\n\nAfter East Timor gained independence in 2002, Bishop Belo continued to advocate for reconciliation and healing among the Timorese people. He emphasized forgiveness and unity as essential for rebuilding the nation and fostering a peaceful future.\n\nBishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo's life and work exemplify the principles of love, forgiveness, and reconciliation found in Christian teachings, including the commandment from Leviticus 19:18 to love your neighbor as yourself. His legacy continues to inspire individuals and communities around the world to work towards peace and justice, even in the most challenging circumstances.\".",
