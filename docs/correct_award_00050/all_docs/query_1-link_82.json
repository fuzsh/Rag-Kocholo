        "text": "Britannica School. - East Timor\n\n\"East Timor, island country in the eastern Lesser Sunda Islands, at the southern extreme of the Malay Archipelago. It occupies the eastern half of the island of Timor, the small nearby islands of Atauro (Kambing) and Jaco, and the enclave of Ambeno, including the town of Pante Makasar, on the northwestern coast of Timor. Dili is the capital and largest city.\"\n\nSpeaking Out About Genocide: The Voices of Survivors, Upstanders, and Experts - East Timor\n\n\"The USF Libraries Holocaust and Genocide Studies Center’s mission is to cross international boundaries to engage information specialists, scholars, educators, students, analysts, and activists in a centralized, interdisciplinary, collaborative, and synergistic approach to genocide education, mental health and public policy, and prevention. Since it's inception, the Center has collaborated in the creation and collection of narratives by genocide survivors, scholars, witnesses, and other experts. This exhibit brings together several of these projects to thematically explore the causes and effects of genocide through the voices of people with first-hand experience.\"\n\nJosé Ramos-Horta, President of East Timor\n\n\"José Ramos-Horta, (born December 26, 1949, Dili, East Timor), East Timorese political activist who, along with Bishop Carlos F.X. Belo, received the 1996 Nobel Prize for Peace for their efforts to bring peace and independence to East Timor, a former Portuguese possession that was under Indonesian control from 1975 to 1999. \"\n\nSPECIAL SESSION OF COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS HEARS FROM NGOs ON SITUATION IN EAST TIMOR; ADJOURNS UNTIL MONDAY\n\n\"Members of the Commission on Human Rights listened this afternoon to emotional testimony from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) about alleged atrocities in East Timor, with the Indonesian military repeatedly blamed for allowing and even participating in a calculated campaign of violence against civilians who had voted in favour of independence for the island territory.\"\n\nJoao Franca da Silva alias Johni Franca\n\n\"The Accused, Joao Franca da Silva, was the Commander of the Kaer Metin Merah Putih militia (KMP) in Lolotoe. In May 1999, he participated in a number of attacks directed at independence supporters including the detention of numerous individuals at the KORAMIL military centre who were kept in small rooms without proper sanitation, and many of whom were beaten and interrogated about their connections. He also ordered the beating of a number of independence supporters, and in one vicious incident, he forced the victim to eat his own ear.\"\n\nFlorencio Tacaqui\n\n\"The Accused, Florencio Tacaqui, was an advisor and member of the Sakunar militia group, which operated in Passabe. In 1999, both prior to and after s referendum in August in which the Timorese people voted overwhelmingly in favour of independence, it carried out a number of attacks. In particular, the Tacaqui was involved in the abduction, detention and beating of approximately 40 independence supporters at the home of a Sakunar chief. He was also involved in the attack on a village in which numerous individuals died, homes were burnt down and livestock stolen. He was convicted for 4 counts of crimes against humanity and sentenced to 12 years’ imprisonment.\"\n\nGeneral Wiranto\n\n\"General Wiranto is one of Indonesia's most controversial military and political figures. Even as human rights advocates denounced him as a war criminal in connection with atrocities committed in East Timor, he was running for the presidency of his country. Specifically, he has been charged with the killings of more than 1,000 civilians in 1999 in East Timor while the province was in the process of obtaining its independence under UN supervision.\""
