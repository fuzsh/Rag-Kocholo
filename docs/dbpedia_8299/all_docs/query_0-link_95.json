        "text": "Many Scheme implementations are written in Scheme and although many of those are compilers or interpreters, some of those are VMs,\n\nsome CommonLisp implementations are written in CommonLisp and although many of those are compilers or interpreters, some of those are VMs,\n\nthe PyPy VM is written in RPython, which is a subset of Python with \"syntax and semantics of Python, speed of C, restrictions of Java and compiler error messages as penetrable as MUMPS\",\n\nthe Squeak Smalltalk VM is written in Slang (a subset of Squeak Smalltalk) and\n\nthe Klein Metacircular VM is written entirely in Self.\n\nOf those, the most interesting are Klein and Maxine (whose design is actually based on Klein). Metacircular Lisp and Scheme implementations usually assume the existence of some basic primitive special forms, which then have to be implemented in assembler, C or a limited subset of the language in a low-level style. Squeak and PyPy use a limited subset of the language. Jikes uses \"magic\" methods and low-level style.\n\nThe idea of Klein and Maxine is that everything is written in high-level, object-oriented, expressive, idiomatic style. In the current version of Klein, there are only two tiny places where the style is hampered by some restriction: in the implementation of message sending, you cannot send any messages and in the implementation of object cloning you cannot clone any objects. However, the current compiler can actually inline or even completely optimize away object cloning and message sending, so those two places could be rewritten in normal OO Self styleÂ â it's just that nobody has done it yet.\n\nAll of that was just metacircular VMs. There's also other VMs written in high-level languages:"
