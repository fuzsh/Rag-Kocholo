All of our advanced classes (18 weeks) include an individual final project and are followed by an 8-10 week Practicum group project.\n\nTopics covered in this course include:\n\nSQL basics\n\nRuby collections, loops, conditionals, methods, classes, blocks, testing\n\nRails basics, active record associations, testing\n\nBootstrap specifically in relation to its use within Rails\n\nAPIs and Swagger\n\nCalling API using AJAX\n\nWhat you should know before starting this course:\n\nNote: The Intro to Programming course is a prerequisite for this class unless you have tested out of Intro to Programming by successfully completing the Advanced class pre-work assignment when applying to our program.\n\nStandard HTML tag set (ex. DOCTYPE, html, head, body, h1-h4, p, a, etc.)\n\nHTML forms (how they work and the various parts that make up a form)\n\nCreating and applying CSS styles (including layouts such as Flexbox and Grid)\n\nJavaScript basics (arrays, objects, methods, functions, loops, conditional statements, etc.)\n\nAPI fetch and how to parse the data returned\n\nJavaScript DOM Manipulation (how to use JavaScript to alter the DOM)\n\ngit/GitHub (how to use git commands in your terminal, how to use a GitHub repository for version control including how to fork, clone, push, making a pull request) NOTE: experience in source control with another version control system like gitlab or bitbucket is also acceptable\n\nSupplies you need before starting this course:\n\nLaptop or Desktop computer of any variety listed below. Chromebooks or similar two-in-one machines are not suitable for this course. 100GB hard disk space should be available regardless of what type of machine you have.\n\nMac: Catalina OS version or later with:\n\n8GB memory minimum, 16GB memory recommended\n\nAdministrative access\n\nPC / Windows: Windows 10 64-bit version or later with:\n\n8GB memory minimum, 16GB memory recommended\n\nAdministrative access\n\nPC / Linux: Linux with a recent version of Ubuntu:\n\n8GB memory minimum, 16GB memory recommended\n\nAdministrative access\n\nWebcam is preferred for attending mentor sessions\n\nReliable Internet Connection\n\nGitHub account. If you do not have one, you can sign up for a free account here\n\nAn Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio Code, Atom, or similar.\n\nWhat Ruby on Rails Students Have to Say\n\n“\n\nStudying at CTD gave me not only a solid knowledge of Ruby On Rails and JavaScript, but also practical experience building and supporting web applications, working in a supportive and friendly environment, the opportunity to meet and work with many experts in the industry and just beautiful people.\n\n– Konstantin, Ruby on Rails Student\n\n“\n\nCTD has changed my life. I still remember the first class I took, I knew very basic things when it came to software development. But with time and training I felt confident from the things I was learning to start applying for jobs. Now after 2 years of working at my company, I’m still applying the things I learned from CTD\n\n– Kwasi, Ruby on Rails Developer"
