        "text": "Noun sense 13 reads: \"(vulgar, slang, countable) Orgasm (male), ejaculation, release of semen\". Megan Thee Stallion, \"Girls in the Hood\" has the line: \"I ain't lyin' 'bout my nut just to make a nigga happy\". (The artist is female.) Is this a one-off, or is it just usually male and the definition should be changed? grendel|khan\n\nI'd be open to further evidence, but those lyrics are explicitly playing with gendered language, as a woman's response to the 1987 song \"Boyz-n-the-Hood\". Ideally, you'd want use (even use that doesn't meet CFI) in a natural conversational context, rather than a song with gender as a theme. —Μετάknowledgediscuss/deeds\n\nRap lyrics are pretty good for slang use, aren't they? (Hard to decipher sometimes, but I can point to these: [1] [2]) I can point to sources that don't meet criteria ([3] [4] [5]); are you thinking maybe more lyrics, or transcripts of TV shows or movies? This probably also broadens verb sense 3, \"(slang, mildly vulgar) To ejaculate.\"; see [6] [7] [8]. grendel|khan\n\nRap lyrics are excellent for slang. --Daleusher (talk)\n\nMore broadly, I think this is analogous to come noun senses 2 and 3, verb sense 7 (\"(intransitive, vulgar, slang) To achieve orgasm; to cum; to ejaculate.\"), or cum etymology 2. It seems synonymous--maybe it was historically gendered, but it's not now. grendel|khan\n\nIt may have historically been male-specific, it may even be chiefly male-specific now, but both the noun and the verb are also used of women (with vaginas): Citations:nut. I note that although my search terms were not (otherwise) dialect-specific (just \"she nutted\" / \"her nut\" + orgasm / pussy), a lot of the results were AAVE / black speech; I would want to poke around some more to determine whether it's limited to AAVE or not. - -sche (discuss)\n\nHow best to add this info?\n\n(postpositive) followed by to: found in connection (with); related (to) (postpositive) followed by upon: caused (by) Collins Concise English Dictionary © HarperCollins Publisher\n\n--Backinstadiums (talk)\n\nWhy does this entry have a translation table that is separate from while? Couldn't they just be merged seeing whilst is little more than an alternative form for while? — surjection ⟨??⟩\n\nProbably, yes. You could create a trans-see if you want, and migrate any leftover translates to while. ---> Tooironic (talk)\n\nDid so. — surjection ⟨??⟩\n\nThank you. ---> Tooironic (talk)\n\nWhat do people feel about the SoP-ness of phrases such as scalding hot, scorching hot, searing hot, baking hot, burning hot? I mean, why not also smouldering hot, singeing hot, roasting hot, flaming hot, broiling hot and so forth. Where does it end? Mihia (talk)\n\nWe include terms that are actually used. The terms in the second list seem rather rare - but could be included if they meet our CfI. SemperBlotto (talk)\n\nErm, yes, but very hot and extremely hot are also \"actually used\". The question is whether these phrases such as \"scalding hot\" or \"scorching hot\" are idiomatic or are just produced by a sum-of-parts formula, not whether they are used, which is beyond doubt. Mihia (talk)\n\nI'd say bring 'em on. freezing cold, piping hot, ruby red, bone-dry, wringing wet are all decent. We have Category:English compound adjectives to contain all of these. --Daleusher (talk)\n\nI'd agree that combinations such as piping hot and bone dry are idiomatic (and hence should be included), being of an unpredictable nature. Mihia (talk)\n\n@Mihia: I broached the topic (twice) before creating those. I was hesitant, but ultimately decided in favour of including them. But if you feel they don't belong, feel free to RFD them. 2A02:2788:A6:935:61F4:2E51:4E97:64E5\n\n6. (transitive) To cause to become; to bring about.\n\n7. (transitive) To cause to do.\n\n8. (transitive) To cause to come or go or move.\n\n9. (transitive) To cause to be in a certain status or position.\n\n(For existing usage examples and citations, which I have not copied here, please see the article.)\n\nTo me, #9 seems only weakly different from #6. The present usexes for #9 illustrate the \"position\" aspect, but I am struggling to come up with any other examples of \"cause to be in a certain status\" which would not equally fit #6. Any ideas? Alternatively, it may make sense to merge #6 and #9?\n\nAlso seeking examples that demonstrate how #8 is anything more than just a case of #7 or possibly #9.\n\nMihia (talk)\n\nAt least merge 9 into 6, and probably 8 into 7 too. Ultimateria (talk)\n\nFor 8 I have added \"I got him to his room.\" which doesn't seem to fit other definitions, based on substitution.\n\nConsider also: \"I got the team headed/heading for the stadium.\" Is that motion (\"for the stadium\") or status (\"heading\"/\"headed\")? There is overlap between 8 and 9, but movement and position seem different enough. DCDuring (talk)\n\nMWOnline has:\n\n5 a: to cause to come or go quickly\n\ngot his luggage through customs\n\nb: to cause to move\n\nget it out of the house\n\nc: to cause to be in a certain position or condition\n\ngot his feet wet\n\nd: to make ready, prepare\n\nget breakfast\n\nI hoped in vain that I didn't do that, but I did c. July 2013. DCDuring (talk)\n\nThank you, yes, I agree that \"I got him to his room\" illustrates a distinction for #8, just about. To me, \"I got the team heading ...\" seems to be #7, while \"I got the team headed ...\" is probably #6. Still seeking convincing examples to show how #9 is distinct from all the others. Mihia (talk)\n\nRe \"I hoped in vain that I didn't do that, but I did\": heh, I had a similar thought when I saw this section (\"oh, I hope I didn't do that as one of my \"basic\" overhauls\"), and was actually surprised to find I hadn't made major edits to the entry. Maybe I will, later! (At the moment, I've been prepping to see if of is missing anything.) - -sche (discuss)\n\nI listed #9 at RFV so that it can be duly deleted if necessary. Mihia (talk)\n\nFor FWOTD I'm looking for non-English entries that are relevant to the coronavirus pandemic and that are in some way different from the usual internationalisms (unusual additional meanings, considerably different/non-analogous morphology). It's even better if they are also (almost) ready to be featured. I'm particularly interested in terms for \"social distancing\", \"intensive care/ICU\", \"elbow sneeze/Dracula sneeze\", \"pandemic\", \"triage\", alternatives for handshakes, nicknames for coronavirus that are not inane; but I don't really mind if there are some words with the same meaning. Hot words don't seem like a good idea to feature right now, but it is okay to suggest them anyway because they might be usable later. You can either suggest words here or on the FWOTD nomination page. ←₰-→ Lingo Bingo Dingo (talk)\n\nPerhaps words like German Maskenträger that were often used to mean \"masquerader\" in pre-pandemic times? —Μετάknowledgediscuss/deeds\n\nThere aren't too many in Chinese just yet. All I can think of right now is 懂王 (Dǒngwáng, “the King of Understanding Things, i.e. President Trump”), 援鄂 (yuán'è, “to aid in the fight against COVID-19 in Hubei province”), 戰疫／战疫 (zhànyì, “to fight against an epidemic (pun)”), and 健康碼／健康码 (jiànkāngmǎ, “health code”). ---> Tooironic (talk)\n\nThanks for the suggestions. The one about Donald Trump won't be featured of course; but the others look interesting. I'll look into the German word. ←₰-→ Lingo Bingo Dingo (talk)\n\n@Lingo Bingo Dingo Maybe Hindi तन दूरी (tan dūrī, “social distancing”, literally “body distance”), whose etymology says \"Humorously contrived to be similar to तंदूरी (tandūrī, “tandoori”)\". Another word for the same thing (apparently not a pun) is शारीरिक दूरी (śārīrik dūrī, literally “bodily distance”). Benwing2 (talk)\n\nYes, that's a great one. Ironically the first one was already suggested elsewhere by AryamanA. ←₰-→ Lingo Bingo Dingo (talk) :\n\nFor anyone who can read Swedish, quite a few in that language are described here by the state Institute for Language and Folklore. I doubt most of them will ever meet the CFI, though. Glades12 (talk)\n\nJenifer and Jennifer have similar but distinct etymologies (possibly once identical according to comments in history). To me they seem the same word. Is there a reason to keep Jenifer as anything other then Alternative spelling of Jennifer? The etymology and alternative or related forms should be on the most popular spelling. Vox Sciurorum (talk)\n\nYeah, I've moved the ety and related terms (which are really derived terms, aren't they?) to Jennifer. No real objection to changing {{given name|en|female|from=Welsh}}, {{n-g|a less common form of [[Jennifer]]}} to something like {{given name|en|female|from=Welsh}}, {{alternative spelling of|en|Jennifer|nocap=1}}, but I would keep that initial {{given name}}, both for the categorization and because (as others have said in other discussions of this kind of thing) I don't suppose people normally think of their names as simply alternative forms of other names, but as distinct names. (See also: the difficulty with defining e.g. Mike as a mere pet name of Michael, when there are people whose birth name is Mike.) - -sche (discuss)\n\nA Swedish dictionary translates en: binge as sv: gille, which might mean feast/party or guild (guilds organized feasts). Is this the original English sense that later turned into meaning a drinking binge? --LA2 (talk)\n\nApparently, the connection here is that one sense of gille is \"drykesslag\" (literally: drinking battle, meaning: drinking feast), which is a drinking binge as a group activity. Gille, just like guild, is derived from words for payment (yield, yeld), as in a feast that is paid together by the participants (not by a single host). In Swedish, this is the older sense, which then was applied to the medieval professional guilds, that paid each other's pensions, widows, or healthcare. --LA2 (talk)\n\nI'm pretty sure the correct spelling is dryckesslag. Glades12 (talk)\n\nIs a Latin textbook giving \"māter matris\" just a typo? Dngweh2s (talk)\n\nAre you asking about the lack of a macron on \"matris\"? The vowel was certainly long here in Classical Latin. The consonant cluster \"tr\" could cause a preceding syllable to be heavy (or the vowel \"long by position\"); the presence of this consonant cluster might be why whatever book you're looking at did not put a macron here. Wiktionary's practice of (in theory) reserving unmarked vowel letters exclusively for short vowel sounds in Latin is not followed by all sources; many sources explicitly mark short vowels with a breve, and unmarked vowels in these sources are to be interpreted not as necessarily short but as having indeterminate length or length that can be contextually inferred.--Urszag (talk)\n\nIndeed, many (especially older) Latin textbooks and dictionary mark vowel length only in open syllables since they assume that the only reason people are interested in long and short vowels in Latin is scansion of poetry, and closed syllables are always heavy. —Mahāgaja · talk\n\n13. (intransitive) To go, to leave.\n\n2012, Paul Zindel, Ladies at the Alamo, Graymalkin Media (→ISBN):\n\nNow go on, get! Get! Get! (she chases Joanne out the door with the hammer.)\n\n2016, April Daniels, Dreadnought, Diversion Books (→ISBN):\n\n\"[…] and then I'll switch over to the police band to know when the bacon's getting ready to stick its nose in. When I tell you to get, you get, understand?\" Calamity asks as she retapes the earbud into her ear.\n\nIs this sense imperative or \"reported/indirect imperative\" only (if so I'll label it as such), or can one use forms such as \"she got\" or \"he gets\" (other than, I suppose, humorously as in e.g. \"I told her to 'get' and she 'got'!\")? Also, do people perceive this as an intrinsic sense of \"get\", or just as an abbreviation of \"get out\"? Mihia (talk)\n\nI've just noticed we have this sense twice (I added the variant above; whoops — maybe I was thinking I'd soon overhaul the rest of the entry and then got distracted). The other incarnation of the definition has a citation of \"I got\". Something like \"chiefly imperative\" or \"usually imperative\" may be best. - -sche (discuss)\n\nOops yes, thanks, I didn't notice that. Anyway, I see you've merged them now, so thanks for doing that. Mihia (talk)\n\nWhat would the descriptor be for adding [mɛlk] as an alternative American pronunciation? Dngweh2s (talk)\n\nThis has been discussed on Talk:milk, and there was at one time (and should perhaps be again, given that it was referenced) a mention of that as a [phonetic] Canadian pronunciation, but we'd need references documenting it as American. - -sche (discuss)\n\nLooking around, I see Arden R. Thorum, Phonetics: A Contemporary Approach (2013), page 107, says \"\"in the Great Lakes region the [ɛ] sound sppears in words such as pillow [pɛloʊ] and milk [mɛlk].\" which would be consistent with it also being used on the other side of the border in Canada. (Standard Canadian English says it's even a phonemic pronunciation for some speakers in Canada.) Language Log suggests its even more widespread (Pittsburgh, Utah, Washington state, Colorado...), although I'd prefer more documentation before labelling it something like just \"regional\". - -sche (discuss)\n\nThis is labelled \"dated\", but as a BrE speaker I do not in any way perceive it to be dated, and at Google News Search for e.g. \"living rough\" I see numerous recent instances. Perhaps it is dated in another English-speaking region? Also pinging @Sgconlaw who added the label. Mihia (talk)\n\nFWIW, searching tweets made in the last week for \"living rough\", I see lots of use of this, but curiously all the tweeters whose nationality I can infer are indeed from the UK. I can find a handful of tweets (from 2019 and 2018) for \"living rough\" + \"color\" (not counting chaff like \"live rough lives\"), vs several times as many for \"living rough\" + \"colour\". Maybe it is dated in the US, or maybe it's just less common in the US. (Fascinating.) - -sche (discuss)\n\nSee also sleep rough. Equinox ◑\n\nI am only familiar with this from UK-originated TV shows. MW has an adverb sense: \"British: without usual conveniences, especially: without proper shelter\n\nbecome homeless and have to sleep rough — London Times\n\nIOW, isn't this both British and NISoP? DCDuring (talk)\n\nIn an entry updated in 2011, the OED used the term “formerly” to refer to live rough, indicating that sleep rough is the more current term. — SGconlaw (talk)\n\nrough sleeper as noun also. Equinox ◑\n\nOK, thanks, I have changed the label from \"dated\" to \"chiefly British\". If anyone knows for sure that it was formerly used elsewhere but is no longer used, they could change this to \"now chiefly British\". I respectfully disagree with the OED if they mean to imply that \"live rough\" is no longer in common use in BrE, and I think there is plenty of evidence to show that this is not true. Btw, I also don't think that \"live rough\" and \"sleep rough\" have identical meanings/connotations in all circumstances. Mihia (talk)\n\nAdditional data points: Tony Thorne's 2009 Dictionary of Contemporary Slang, page 213, uses this while defining a hedger, British homeless slang for \"a crustie who prefers to live rough in the countryside\", and Collins uses this in defining go bush, \"abandon city amenities and live rough\". Given that and the ample ongoing use up to the present day on e.g. Twitter, I think we're on solid ground in not calling it dated. I would not have perceived it as distinctly British, just uncommon, but since it seems to be fairly common in Britain, it seems that\"chiefly British\" is indeed the right label. To me, it seems like a transparent derivation of a sense of rough (and live) that can be found in other phrases like \"rough camping\", which I would also not have perceived as dialect-specific and which Dictionary.com does not mark as dialect-specific (as an adjective), though Merriam-Webster does mark it \"British\" (as an adverb). We don't have this sense at rough at all, neither as an adjective nor an adverb, BTW. - -sche (discuss)\n\nFor me, the specific meaning of \"live rough\" is far from easy to confidently understand from the parts, and I would not question its entry-worthiness. Mihia (talk)\n\nWhat constitutes a \"proper home or abode\"? A tent? A motor home? A lean to? A working car? An abandoned car? A room in a boarding house with shared bathroom and no kitchen? Do nomads sleep/live rough?\n\nThe MW definition of rough#Adverb has similar problems \"proper shelter\" and \"without usual conveniences\". Clearly social norms are involved. Do UK speakers use it about people in non-European cultures? DCDuring (talk)\n\nwas: use of sexuality to mean \"sex/gender\"\n\nWe have this (as \"sexual identity, gender\") and I'm familiar with it and am not RFVing it. However, neither cite contains enough info to make clear whether they're using this sense, and if you look at more of the page, the first book seems to be using the \"(interest in) sexual activity\" sense, and the second also seems to be referring more to the kinds of sexual activity a person is into than to their gender as male or female. Is that also how you would interpret the cites? (I'll move them if so.) Also: it's not clear to me how the sense \"Sexual receptivity\" or its citation is not just the same basic sense as the \"interest in sexual activity\" sense; is there a reason I shouldn't merge them? Merriam-Webster, Lexico and Dictionary.com don't have the \"sex/gender\" sense (suggesting it is, as I feel, a sub-standard / inept usage, although fairly common), and they also do not split \"interest in sexual activity\" and \"sexual receptiveness\" into separate senses. - -sche (discuss)\n\nI agree with your interpretation of which senses the cites refer to, and that \"sexual receptivity\" is a restatement of \"concern with, or interest in, sexual activity\". Ultimateria (talk)\n\nI notice other dictionaries (and our own translations tables) separate \"sexual activity\" and ~\"interest in sexual activity\" as different senses. I don't know whether that's better or not. Even if we leave them combined, I wonder if we could word the latter better. Likewise, \"sexual potency\" seems to be getting at a real sense (other dictionaries don't have it, but we're doing one better than them), but I wonder if we could expand on that wording (maybe add \"; sexualness\"? and more?). But I'm not sure how to word either sense better. Many of these senses are closely related (some other dictionaries have them all as subsenses of one broad sense corresponding two our sense 1), and in many citations teasing out the precise sense is hard. - -sche (discuss)\n\nI think there's enough overlap between those two aspects to include them in the same sense, especially in practice of how the term is used. \"sexual potency\" is a perfectly fine definition, IMO.\n\nI question \"asexuality\" as an antonym for any of these senses. Maybe I just don't get sense 1 of \"sexuality\"; it's a little abstract. Couldn't it be (based on \"asexuality\" 1.1) \"The state of experiencing sexual attraction\"? Ultimateria (talk)\n\nI took our sense 1 (which MW and Dictionary.com also have, but not Lexico), as worded, as a counterpart to all of asexuality sense 1 (not just 1.1), like \"the sexuality of this species, as contrasted with the asexuality of that one\", meaning \"quality of being sexual, that is, reproducing sexually\" (like this). The way it's written, and the way the other dictionaries word their senses, suggests that a species (etc?) which simply has distinct sexes is also \"sexual\" (we do not have this sense of \"sexual\"), and this quality of being sexual = distinguished by sex is \"sexuality\"; we should check whether cites support this. However, the citations under our sense 1, prior to my latest edit, use a meaning more in line with our sense 2-4...\n\nI would also expect a sense corresponding to asexuality 1.1, in line with the sexual#Noun being \"a person who experiences sexual attraction [...] as contrasted with an asexual\", but finding citations (amid the other more common senses) is likely to be tricky. I did find one or two. - -sche (discuss)\n\nThe work is apparently form Hardy, \"Hist. Bwk. Nat. Club\", V. 386. WTF is that supposed to be? Should we have entries hist., bwk., nat.? --Daleusher (talk)\n\n@Daleusher: According to [9], it's the History of the Berwickshire Naturalists' Club (14 vols., Alnwick, 1831–9). —Mahāgaja · talk\n\nThe Berwickshire Naturalists' Club still exists, and the History is still published every year. —Mahāgaja · talk\n\nSo it's an ISO 4 journal abbreviation then, @Mahagaja? — Ceso femmuin mbolgaig mbung, mellohi! (投稿)\n\nIt's an abbreviation the EDD (which Mahagaja links to) uses; the citation was taken over from an out-of-copyright edition of the EDD. As to whether we should have the abbreviations (Bwk. only if it's attested elsewhere; the others surely are), I'm inclined to say yes, but I realize it's kind of a grey area and some people would argue no. (I recall discussion of y. and/or ylw as abbreviations of yellow.) - -sche (discuss)\n\nI was doing research on the origin of Grim Reaper a while back, and I encountered a claim that \"the Grim\" was a nickname for Death dating back to the thirteenth century. The website that I found this on doesn't look particularly credible, though, and I wasn't able to verify this information anywhere else. Can anyone find any attestations of it? —Globins (yo)\n\nAll I can say is that it appears unlikely to me; the obsolete noun grim meant a haunting spirit. Here, in a 19th-century poem entitled “The Flood of the Conemaugh” (referring to the Johnstown Flood of 1889 killed that more than 2000 people), Death is referred to five times as “Death, the grim”, but that use seems to me to be short for “the grim one” and occasioned by the restrictions imposed by the iambic tetrameter. But this here is a modern use. --Lambiam\n\nIs the given audio file correct? I hear /ˈʃɛ.dər/, not /ˈʃɹɛ.dər/ or /ˈʃrɛ.dər/.\n\nIs it ?[ˈʃɾɛ.dər]? that is being said in that audio file? If not, then I'm not sure how the audio file could be accurate. Is /ˈʃɛ.dər/ an alternate pronunciation of shredder in Dutch? I could understand /ʃɹ/ being difficult for some Dutch speakers to produce, given the phonemic inventory of their native language. 70.188.165.229\n\nI clearly hear a tap and the file sounds accurate to me. It should always be a cluster, but the type of r is variable in Dutch; it's just that the [ɹ] is particularly common in some words borrowed from English. ←₰-→ Lingo Bingo Dingo (talk)\n\nThe word shredder is recognized by Dutch speakers as being an English word. They will attempt to reproduce the English pronunciation, generally with limited success. Perhaps it is the IPA that is not entirely accurate, being insufficiently representative of a variety of pronunciations. --Lambiam\n\nPerhaps [ˈʃɾɛ.dər] (as suggested), or /ˈʃɾɛ.dər/ ought to be listed as a secondary pronunciation. Tharthan (talk)\n\n/r/ can be realised in a ton of ways in Dutch; it is hardly helpful to list them all in a random entry. But noting that [ɹ] is not required is helpful. ←₰-→ Lingo Bingo Dingo (talk)\n\nIs this phrase really always hyperbolic?\n\nI'm pretty sure that there have been some instances when the phrase has been uttered and hasn't been hyperbolic in the slightest.\n\nMight \"(usually hyperbolic)\" be a better descriptor to tag on, as opposed to simply \"(hyperbolic)\"? Tharthan (talk)\n\nAgreed. I have definitely heard/seen it used in (fictional) instances where it was meant very literally. Andrew Sheedy (talk)\n\nOf course, the phrase itself could be meant literally, and an \"&lit\" line could be added I suppose, though this may seem a little superfluous, but are you sure the phrase is ever (also) meant literally when used in the relevant sense, i.e. \"Under no circumstances; absolutely not\"? I find this quite hard to imagine. I suppose one could just about contrive a situation where such an intention was possible, but to me it seems too far-fetched for us to really trouble ourselves with. Mihia (talk)\n\nThe reason why I brought this to the Tea Room is because I am 100% certain that I have, like Mr. Sheedy, seen this used in many (fictional) instances where it was meant in an extremely literal manner (with regard to the relevant sense given in the entry. Sorry for the confusion, I wasn't referring to \"over my dead body\" being used in some other way), somewhat akin to \"You'll take this dear, important thing from me only after prying it out of my cold, dead hands.\", which I am sure you would agree you could picture being used literally in, say, a work of literature.\n\nOK, well maybe I'm missing something. If it is as common as you suggest, I think an example illustrating this phenomenon may be useful in the article, as right now I can only barely imagine a literal sense incorporated in the expression meaning \"Under no circumstances\". I would have thought if the literal sense was meant then it would be just that -- literal -- and the \"Under no circumstances\" definition would not really apply. By the way, the existing citation, \"No, monster! First over my dead body thou shalt tread\", seems faulty, as \"over my dead body\" does not in that instance mean \"Under no circumstances\". Mihia (talk)\n\nI don't think \"over my dead body\" is SOP, whether or not it is literal. If someone says, \"Give me that [insert important item here],\" and the person with the thing replies, \"Over my dead body,\" the latter person might well mean that the former will have to kill them before they'd hand over the item in question, but it doesn't make it non-SOP; it's an idiom for \"you'll have to kill me if you want that, because I'll never you do/have it while I'm alive.\" Andrew Sheedy (talk)\n\nI think it really is physically impossible for a person to give someone something over their own dead body, so I think your example would have to be changed to e.g. \"I'll make X give me that\" / \"Over my dead body\", where X is a third person. But even if the sense of \"you'll have to kill me first\" is meant for real, I still think it is far-fetched that the speaker has in mind that the object is passed from one person to another literally over his own dead body, which is how I understand a literal interpretation. However, I have also just realised that originally in this thread I addressed a question of whether the phrase could be literal in the sense \"Under no circumstances\", which was not the original question of whether it could be non-hyperbolic. If the idea of \"you'll have to kill me first\" being meant for real makes the phrase non-hyperbolic then, yes, I agree with the original point that it can be, even though to my mind it is still unlikely to be literal. Mihia (talk)\n\nI always pictured a literal scenario taken to its conclusion as something more like someone stepping over the person's dead body to go and get whatever the object is. Thus, the speaker would literally be saying \"You'll only get that stepping over my dead body.\"\n\nThat doesn't really make sense, though, if the object in question is on the person of the speaker. That is, unless the sense would then be \"You'll only get that if you're standing over my dead body\".\n\nIn any case, is \"(usually hyperbolic)\" alright with you, Mihia? Tharthan (talk)\n\nThat seems like the right idea.\n\nImplausibility, even physical/biological impossibility, of the \"literal\" case is fundamentally irrelevant. The expression could be used in fantasy or sci-fi in a \"literal\" sense in the fictional universe. We could look for such cites if we really wanted to settle the matter definitively, though I'd be happy to just let it slide. DCDuring (talk)\n\n@Tharthan: Yes, I wouldn't notice any problem with \"usually hyperbolic\". It's only the idea that it would be used literally that I find scarcely plausible. Mihia (talk)\n\nI was looking at the latest Wiktionary dump and notice that there are three reconstructed terms that are not prefixed by their language (e.g. Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/ḱwṓ). These terms are: Reconstruction:ālas, Reconstruction:*menoᐧtayi and Reconstruction:menoᐧtayi.\n\nShouldn't the first one be renamed to Reconstruction:Tocharian B/ālas (no redirection)? Also I noticed that there is a redirection to this term from the main namespace (ālas) but, according to WT:RECONS, Redirects from the main namespace to these entries are not permitted.\n\nAs for the last two terms, they are redirections to Reconstruction:Proto-Algonquian/menoᐧtayi. Although redirection within the namespace seems to be allowed, they are the only redirections which are not prefixed by the language. So I believe they should be deleted.\n\nI'm not very familiar with reconstructed terms, what do you think? Thanks — nyg gh (talk)\n\nYes, thanks. I've moved the Tocharian entry and deleted the Algonquian redirects. —Mahāgaja · talk\n\nThe Longman Pronunciation Dictionary accepts a secondary /ˈdæmnɪŋ/ for the form damning (unlike for say condemn.

Daniel Jones' famous dictionary of English pronunciation shows no sign of it either. It is just about possible that the occasional person thinks it necessary to make an audible distinction between damming (damming a river) and damning. To claim that one pronunciation is used for the verbal noun and another for the participle is odd, as it is unlikely that even 1 in a million native speakers use this pronunciation ever in any context. — This unsigned comment was added by 81.141.8.102 (talk) at .\n\nI've never heard it either.

I usually say that word in 3 syllables, not 4. —Mahāgaja · talk\n\nThe Oxford Dictionary of Original Shakespearean Pronunciation gives /rɪˈmembrɪn/, /rɪˈmembrɪŋ/ for -ing and /rɪˈmembəɹd/, /rɪˈmembəˌred/ for -ed. Neither rememb'red nor rememb'ring occur in the First Folio, but the normal spelling of these two verb forms at the time seems to have been remembred and remembring, respectively. So distinguishing ‘rememb'ring’ from ‘remembering’ is a relatively recent thing, I guess to specify to modern readers who might pronounce it with four syllables that the word has to have only three for metrical reasons. For Early Modern English speakers and others like you whose dialects still have the 3-syllable pronunciation as normal, it should make no difference. — Vorziblix (talk · contribs)\n\n@Vorziblix: So what are the pronunciations of both rememb'r and remembre?--Backinstadiums (talk)\n\nrememb'r does not exist. The apostrophe elision is not applied to entire verbs but to certain forms only, to preserve poetic meter. Equinox ◑\n\nYes, and remembre is just a spelling variation of remember, with the same pronunciation (RP /ɹɪˈmɛmbə(ɹ)/ < Early Modern /rɪˈmembəɹ/). — Vorziblix (talk · contribs)\n\nIn the given line, I see no reason to prefer one possible three-syllable pronunciation over another, but it's conceivable that in some other case a poet might intend this spelling to convey a three-syllable pronunciation with the final syllable enunciated as (for example) /-bɹɪd/, like in -èd, or even something along the lines of what you suggested above ('/ri.ˈmEm.brəd/\"). This would be distinguishable from the usual three-syllable pronunciation if it was rhymed with something. (As for whether it's a productive \"pattern\" in other contexts: well, poets have been known to remove pesky syllables from wherever they need to. I would not expect rememb'r to exist except as some kind of eye dialect (which is what it seems to exist as), because you can't really reduce /-mbɚ/ to fewer syllables, can you?) - -sche (discuss)\n\nOughtn't sense 4 (which ought to itself be split into two senses [1. a false deity or idol 2.

Not to mention, given that baal is not inherently referring to Baal or the Baalim (though they would certainly be baals, of course), having it at Baal doesn't really make much sense.\n\nDoes anyone else support the idea of splitting off sense 4 of Baal from the Baal entry, and moving it to baal under an English section?

But it seems to be only sometimes definitional. What about this?

That's not unheard of. As for kop vs. Kop, we do distinguish capitalized entries from lowercase entries here, so if it's true that the sense “terrace at a football ground” is always capitalized in English, while the sense “hill” usually isn't, then yes, we do need both entries. (And in any case we need to keep [[Kop]] for the Saterland Frisian word.) —Mahāgaja · talk\n\nI am not fully sure about the regular form kop outside compounds, but the diminutive koppie can definitely mean \"hill\" in Afrikaans. ←₰-→ Lingo Bingo Dingo (talk)\n\nIn that case, do you feel confident enough to add it as a second meaning under kop#Afrikaans?

Of course, a term should only be said to be controversial on here if there is indeed controversy/criticism directed at the term itself; there might well be, considering that conversion therapy is pseudomedicine. Perhaps the usage note could be adequately replaced by a label \"(potentially) offensive\" or it could actually describe published criticisms.\n\nI also see that there is no entry ex-lesbian yet. ←₰-→ Lingo Bingo Dingo (talk)\n\nThe term itself is definitely controversial, as it implies that it is possible for someone who was once gay to stop being gay. —Mahāgaja · talk\n\nThe term is only controversial because the Cultural Marxists have declared it to be so, and it is not the role of a dictionary to adjudicate such things. If someone says he was gay and is now ex-gay, then that is his right-- and there are such people who make this claim. To determine the truth of the claim is beyond the remit of a dictionary. — This unsigned comment was added by 81.141.8.102 (talk) at .\n\nCultural Marxist, being a Red Scare tactic that blurs a complex set of beliefs and theories into something dismissably as Commie, is itself pretty controversial. There is virtually no one who says they're a Cultural Marxist. Whether or not you like a group of people, a word is controversial if enough people find it controversial.--Prosfilaes (talk)\n\nNo. Cultural Marxism has a specific meaning. It refers to the Frankfurt School's decision in the 1960s to abandon the working class in favour of a fixation on race and sex. What you mean, although you don't dare to say so openly, is that something is controversial only when a self-appointed group in the media declare it to be so. What is controversial for the Right would not be included. — This unsigned comment was added by 81.141.8.102 (talk) at .\n\nCf. w:Cultural Marxism, which redirects to w:Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory. (As if the Frankfurt School in the 1960s could possible define the left in the 2020s.) As I said, it is what nobody describes themselves as. There's not much point in actually responding to you if you're going to just make up what you think, instead of responding to what I said. Note that e.g. God botherer is listed as derogatory. It seems that a lot of people on the Right seem to spend more time complaining about being persecuted than actually working on any problem.--Prosfilaes (talk)\n\nI think I made a mistake, in that the Frankfurt School may have been active in the 1930s, not the 1960s. I could spend time researching this, but I'll leave that to you. Even if the left (and the right nowadays) reject the label Cultural Marxist, the provenance of their views do come from that, via the university campus channel. Of course, it has developed. I don't think the original Cultural Marxists had transgender on their list. The thing has taken on a life of its own. You could argue the right was more immediately influenced by Karl Popper and his theories of the Open Society, and that the right and left were engaged in a kind of evolution of both sets of ideas throughout the 20th century. But the fact that the university scene is so far to the extremes of left-wing thought suggests it plays the larger and more decisive role. Odd that I'm getting Cultural Marxist replies from someone who .... claims not to be one.

If ten minutes ago you'd told me Seth was ex-gay I would have assumed he used to be gay and now he wasn't (or was judged to be gay and now wasn't). I'm sure I heard it that way before the culture wars heated up. Is a {{&lit}} sense called for? And definitely tone down the usage note. We only need to note that it is sometimes offensive in one sense. Vox Sciurorum (talk)\n\nIs it the word that is a problem, or the concept? Meaning, if I say something like \"cured of homosexuality\" instead of \"ex-gay\" does it solve the problem the same way as calling somebody Black instead of a coon? If it's the concept, we don't have an essay on atheist explaining that a survey of 27 Baptist preachers concluded they will all burn in hell. Being judgmental about concepts is Wikipedia's job. Vox Sciurorum (talk)\n\nYeah, that usage note should go. I don't see any problem with the definition...it allows for interpretation according to your beliefs on the subject. I wonder, however, if there might be an additional sense of the word used in some religious contexts: Someone who has homosexual attractions but has chosen to stop having sex with same-sex partners. Andrew Sheedy (talk)\n\nI agree that the usage note doesn't contribute enough to keep it. Ultimateria (talk)\n\nAgree the usenote should go. Equinox ◑\n\n(e/c) Since the definition already makes clear that the term is connected to a specific movement and not just anyone whose understanding of or way of referring to their orientation has changed (which might be an attestable {{&lit}} sense), I don't know that the current usage note adds much. Perhaps it could be revised to explain why the term is controversial, or trimmed to something like \"The concept of 'ex-gay' is controversial, see [Wikipedia link]\", but as Vox suggests, the issue seems to be as much with the concept as with the word, so I'm not opposed to just dropping the notes. - -sche (discuss)\n\nBased on the above discussion, I removed the usage note. I added \"pseudoscientific\" as a description of conversion therapy. - -sche (discuss)\n\nI think pseudoscientific is too judgmental for a dictionary. There are better ways of expressing doubt. Vox Sciurorum (talk)\n\nAgreed. I don't think it helps anyone understand the word better anyway. If anything, it makes it more confusing, because no one claims to be part of a movement promoting pseudoscience. I think \"claims it can be cured by conversion therapy\" is enough. Anyone who knows anything about anything can make the relevant judgement based on that information. Andrew Sheedy (talk)\n\nAdverb sense:\n\n(hospitality, US) Without additional ice.\n\nWould you like that drink up or on ice?\n\nI don't know this sense. Is it likely to be an adverb, or is it actually an adjective? Mihia (talk)\n\nGreen's Dictionary of Jargon (Routledge Revivals) (2013, →ISBN), has it as an adverb (in \"US bars\"), abbreviation of \"straight up\" (\"without ice\"). He does not seem to have an entry for \"straight up\". The Cassell's Dictionary of Slang also attributed to him (2005, Sterling, →ISBN), has \"straight up\" as an adjective, from the 1970s (onward), derived from \"straight\" (\"undiluted\". I see a few uses in books and on the web of \"straight up\" in this sense (which we lack), by searching for \"(one|a) (coffee|coke) straight up\". The only use of \"up\" I spotted (on the web, not somewhere durable) is from Jeffrey Morgenthaler saying \"I've had many a bartender misunderstand what I mean when I say I'd like a drink 'up'\", lol. - -sche (discuss)\n\nThanks for finding that. Since that evidence is mixed, I think I'll leave it alone for now. Mihia (talk)\n\nI'm tempted to RFV it, but I know it'd be tedious to search for. OTOH, without citations it's hard to make any judgement about what POS it is. I notice we have straight up as an adverb, not an adjective like Cassell, but the existence of \"a straight up whiskey\" means this is (also?) an adjective. Would you interpret \"straight up\" in \"a margarita, straight up\" as also being an adjective? Because I suspect that \"up\" and \"straight up\", when referring to drinks, have the same part of speech. - -sche (discuss)\n\nI guess one cannot say \"an up whiskey\"? For me, \"straight up\" in, \"a margarita, straight up\" is probably adjectival, describing the type of margarita, but I think it is also possible for it to be construed as adverbial, describing the way in which a mentioned verb (such as preparing, pouring, mixing etc.) is performed. Mihia (talk)\n\nIn fact, while I found no hits for \"an up whiskey\", actually there are some for \"an up Margarita\", albeit many have the word \"up\" in quotes. Mihia (talk)\n\nGood find. Clearly, both up and straight up (in these drink-related senses) are adjectives at least some of the time (if not all of the time). - -sche (discuss)\n\nJust noticed (obviously I should have checked earlier!) that we do also have adj. sense of \"up\": \"(bar tending) Chilled and strained into a stemmed glass\" A Cosmopolitan is typically served up. I suppose this is essentially the same kind of thing. Mihia (talk)\n\nDo you think we need an adverb section or can it be merged into the adjective? I guess we could RFV it and see what kinds of citations can be found. - -sche (discuss)\n\nI'm really not sure. If completely unambiguous examples can't be found, I am more than happy to defer to anyone who is personally familiar with this sense and has a \"feel\" for whether it can be adverbial. What I would say is that the present adjective usex, A Cosmopolitan is typically served up, though potentially ambiguous wrt PoS, to me seems a more plausible candidate for adverbial use than does the alleged adverb usex Would you like that drink up or on ice?. Also noting that the definitions of the adverbial and adjectival senses are not consistent. One talks about a drink being \"strained\" into a \"stemmed glass\", while the other mentions neither of those things. Mihia (talk)\n\nMy impression, based on the use of \"up\" or \"straight up\" to refer to non-alcoholic beverages, is that \"stemmed glass\" is mistaken, probably based on thinking the only thing that could be served \"[straight] up\" is a margarita, when apparently so can e.g. whiskey (and coffee). Whether something has to have been chilled on ice which is then strained out, or can sometimes simply be chilled and served without ice ever having been involved, I don't know, but again, I tend to suspect the latter (that the narrower definition is too narrow). - -sche (discuss)\n\nAdj. sense:\n\nOn a higher level.\n\nThe new ground is up.\n\n1925, Walter Anthony and Tom Reed (titles), Rupert Julian (director), The Phantom of the Opera, silent movie\n\n‘The Phantom!

Does anyone else get what it means?\n\nMihia (talk)\n\nThe use of \"new\" makes me think this is short for the past participles \"set up\" or \"put up\" in the sense of \"install\" or \"assemble\". But no, I don't get it. I say replace it. Ultimateria (talk)\n\nMy guess would be that it means: ‘The new football ground is at a higher level than the old one‘ but it’s a clunky construction, so I say replace too.

In response to Talk:problematic I added one (alongside the other two subsenses) in 2015, worded as \"Contributing (usually implicitly or subtly) to systemic discrimination (such as racism, sexism, homophobia, or transphobia)\", but I'm on the fence now and I see the point of the new user who removed it today that it could be viewed as just the regular meaning of the word. I did cite a WaPo story on the talk page where the original (and the URL) used \"racist\" and the editors changed it to \"problematic\", showing the extent to which some people equate the two words, but the citations I just put at Citations:problematic show how it's on a continuum with the \"regular\"/\"broad\" meaning. - -sche (discuss)\n\nI think we should have it (as subsense) because this is specifically a social justice buzzword. Its synonyms (difficult, awkward etc.) are not. Equinox ◑\n\nI have put it back for procedural reasons, but I think this use is sufficiently specific and distinct/consolidated to keep it so I would not applaud a RFD.

Thanks -sche for bringing this into the tea-room. It's pleasant in here. -- So a question I have, which is kind of general: I'm familiar with the idea that (i) the meanings of words can become narrower (or broader) through use, so conceivably that could be happening here. But I'm not sure I understand the process very well. At least, there's also this other phenomenon (if something so fundamental can be called that), that (ii) general words get applied to particular things. And presumably not every case of this is also a case of the general term changing its sense, or acquiring a new sense. What criteria might there be, I wonder, for deciding whether we're witnessing a case of (i) rather than (ii)? Aingotno (talk)\n\nA hypothesis: the perception that the examples in question represent a new, distinct sense of the word have their basis not so much in a narrowing of the sense of \"problematic\" (as if people had started saying \"a piece of fruit\" when they mean \"a banana\") but in a shift at a different level. People who say problematic in the seemingly new way use the word to *condemn* something. So they're not saying that whatever they're talking about is \"not settled; yet to be determined; uncertain\" (Collins, linked above by Lingo Bingo Dingo), on the contrary, they want to assert that the matter is settled, has been determined: the thing (behavior, or whatever) that they're talking about is bad.\n\nIf that's right, then perhaps there's a further discussion to be had about whether or not this usage is covered by existing definitions like \"questionable\" (Collins again), or whether we do indeed need a new formulation because this is in fact a distinct usage. Aingotno (talk)\n\nCan someone check the pronunciation of the Swedish sense \"order\" or \"decoration\"? According to all three dictionaries at svenska.se, it's actually something closer to /ˈoːrdɛn/. Glades12 (talk)\n\nOur definition of wassup refers the reader to phrasebook entry what's up. The relevant sense of up also could do with a link to \"what's up\" somehow, which I intend to add. I've never really had anything to do with the phrasebook -- is linking to phrasebook entries for explanation something that we normally do or should be doing? Or should there be a separate dictionary entry for \"what's up\" (or conversion of existing phrasebook entry to dictionary entry)? Mihia (talk)\n\nWhat to lemmings think? “what's up”, in OneLook Dictionary Search.. Ie, mainstream dictionaries have it. DCDuring (talk)\n\nDo you (or anyone) know whether we would/should delete the phrasebook entry if we created a dictionary entry for what's up? I mean, is it possible or desirable to have both? (And, if both exist, I wonder which gets displayed by default when you search for the term?) Mihia (talk)\n\nI think we could remove {{phrasebook}} from what's up, based on lemmings and the expressions discourse-control function. I am not sure that all of the definitions are warranted, eg, those that don't have a discourse-control function. DCDuring (talk)\n\nLooking at this again, I think I may have misunderstood the architecture of these phrasebook entries. I assumed that the phrasebook was a different \"space\" altogether -- but is it just a question of including or not including a {{phrasebook}} template, but otherwise it is treated or processed exactly the same as any other entry? Thus, it would not even be possible to have a phrasebook entry and a regular entry for exactly the same expression? Mihia (talk)\n\nI believe it is just a template. Inspection of {{Phrasebook}} shows me that it doesn't do anything except insert the banner and categorize. It is an readily reversed experiment to remove the template and assess the consequences. DCDuring (talk)\n\nUS English, meaning 1. \"To ensure that one continues to tell the truth\" or 2. \"To cause one to behave in a virtuous or appropriate manner.\" (see here). Worth an entry? 2A02:2788:A6:935:351D:18F4:E607:A40\n\nIn my opinion, no. I think this is a SOP cliché. Telling the truth or virtuous or appropirate behaviour are just more specific interpretations of what honesty should entail. Personally, I'm only familiar with the phrase in the context of political concern trolling (e.g. someone pandering to the antivac movement suggests to stack some organisation linked to vaccines with antivaxers \"just to keep the variolaters honest\".) ←₰-→ Lingo Bingo Dingo (talk)\n\nIf someone points out errors, the person who made those errors may tell them \"thanks for keeping me honest\". It's more complex than concern trolling. Chuck Entz (talk)\n\nIn the UK (don't know if it is UK only), this expression is used in sporting contexts, whereby if player A is leading player B, or is generally stronger than player B, but player B puts on a good performance so that player A doesn't have a completely free ride, then player B is said to be \"keeping player A honest\". I think this meaning, at least, is worth an entry. I think it may extend in a similar way outside sports too, but I would need to check for actual examples. Mihia (talk)\n\nI think I've heard it used that way in American sports, and if not it feels consistent with the way the phrase is used in general. Vox Sciurorum (talk)\n\nIt would be a bit of a stretch to say this is NISoP, though only one idiom dictionary has it at “keep honest”, in OneLook Dictionary Search.. DCDuring (talk)\n\nFYI, I have added the sporting sense at keep someone honest. I am agnostic about whether it should be there or at keep honest -- in fact, I don't know what our policy is here. Mihia (talk)\n\nThis seems to be a topic of considerable debate among users on this site and in French 19th century naturalist books. There seem to be two schools of thought: those who believe the vernacular genre name should be capitalized and those who believe the entire term should be spelled in lowercase letter, e.g. Porcelaine de Madagascar or porcelaine de Madagascar. What should the standard on Wiktionary be? Languageseeker (talk)\n\nIt's not just French. English nature-related books tend to capitalize unique names of organisms. This is systematic, and has little resemblance to capitalization in other contexts- it's perfectly correct to write \"I saw a house finch on my balcony\" rather than \"I saw a House Finch on my balcony\". English Wikipedia, for instance, has a rule that addresses this. I would avoid overriding the normal capitalization rules of a language based only on such usage. Chuck Entz (talk)\n\nExactly. And in the past any important Noun or even Important Word could be capitalized for emphasis (and conversely, especially earlier in English history, many words which would now be capitalized were not, \"i saw john today\", etc). I don't think there's anywhere near the \"considerable debate\" here that there was on Wikipedia (where the rule was bitterly fought by folks who wanted to favour the \"specialists' style\"), though: like Chuck says, follow the usual capitalization rules, which in this case means things will normally be lowercase unless there's a proper name involved, etc. - -sche (discuss)\n\nWe once had a really boring discussion like this about dog breeds, IIRC. In case anyone wants to dig that up...Daleusher (talk)\n\n\"(slang, New Zealand) A failure or unfortunate event. The concert was stink.\" That looks like an adjective to me, not a noun, or else it would be \"the stink\" or \"a stink\". (Or else we need to mark the sense and the noun as uncountable.) Who can confirm? Equinox ◑\n\nKiwi here, it's definitely an adjective. – Nixinova [‌T|C]\n\n@Nixinova: Thanks. Is it only predicative (\"the concert was stink\") or can it be used attributively also (\"that was a really stink concert\")? Equinox ◑\n\nBoth: [11] [12] – Nixinova [‌T|C]\n\nDone Cool. I'm moving it. Thanks. Equinox ◑\n\nI'm wondering whether anyone has any thoughts about how to treat what's up with. It seems desirable that people should somehow be able to look up this common combination, as the meaning is not transparent, yet this is by no means a fixed or immutable phrase. As well as the obvious tense change of \"what was up with ~\", we can make insertions such as \"what the hell is up with ~\" or \"what did you say is up with ~\", alterations such as \"what seems to be up with ~\", \"I don't know what could be up with ~\", and, perhaps most problematically, we can say e.g. \"something is up with ~\". Strictly speaking, all these are explicable by combining appropriate senses of \"up\" and \"with\", but I feel it is unreasonable to expect people who don't know the expression to put these together in the right way. I don't feel very enthusiastic about making an entry for up with as it feels fragmentary, and \"to be up with\" does not seem natural English to me in the relevant sense. Any ideas? Mihia (talk)\n\nThe third sense is NISoP, IMO. As you point out, the entry is often used literally with a sense of up#Adjective, from which the greeting etc are derived. If we link to the specific sense of up from {{&lit|en}}, I think we will not only tell users what the expression means, but also lead them to appreciate up, which has so many uses. DCDuring (talk)\n\nWe should probably go further and merge what's up with into what's up. DCDuring (talk)\n\nBTW, what's up with is not a constituent and is, therefore, not a proper phrase. DCDuring (talk)\n\nI have used {{l|en|up|id=happening}} to link to the appropriate sense of up from {{&lit|en|what|'s|up}} at [[what's up]].\n\nWe could go further and add {{lb|en|usually with with}} to the definitions at what's up and make [[what's up with]] a redirect to that entry. DCDuring (talk)\n\nThanks for your thoughts on this. The slight issue I have with the \"&lit\" line at what's up is that some, perhaps all, of the other (non-lit) entries can be explained as \"what\" + \"is\" + \"up\". For example, the &lit \"up\" links to the definition \"Happening; new; of concern\", yet \"what's happening\" and \"what's new\" are given as synonyms of non-lit sense #2. Mihia (talk)\n\nSemantically none of the definition are really idiomatic. I think it is its use as a common greeting that makes it entryworthy. DCDuring (talk)\n\nWhen you say entryworthy, you mean at the main dictionary as opposed to the phrasebook, right? Mihia (talk)\n\nIMHO, yes. I could see the logic of only including it in the Phrasebook or as a translation target, but I think expressions that have a standard discourse function that is separate from (though derived from) their semantics are entryworthy. DCDuring (talk)\n\nListed at Wiktionary:Requests_for_deletion/English#what's_up_with. Mihia (talk)\n\nI was incredibly surprised that we have no definition for erect to describe penis. Really, we're an online dictionary with 1000s of sex terms, and not a single one for erect. Shame on us. --Daleusher (talk)\n\nOK, there should be two more definitions - for an erect penis and an erect man. And perhaps a nice photo/diagram. --Daleusher (talk)\n\nWe have the erect man sense (maybe you just added it?); the penis sense is not distinct, that's just normal erectness, i.e. standing out straight. Equinox ◑\n\nYeah, I added a couple of senses. The penis sense is definitely distinct though - it needs to have a sexual meaning, like \"having blood flow through it, especially as a result of sexual arousal\" --Daleusher (talk)\n\nHmm, I don't think that's so. Someone who can't get their penis hard \"naturally\" for some reason might use an implanted pump. And a dead body might develop a death erection, which does not necessarily involve blood \"flow\" so much as one-time pooling. Meanwhile, other body parts can flush with the flow of blood as a result of sexual arousal, yet not be \"erect\". (Other dictionaries seem to cover erect penises under the same sense as erect hairs or erect ears on a dog.) - -sche (discuss)\n\nThe lemmings lump the meanings together? That seems oversimplifying things. To me, an erect hair and an erect penis are lexically different - firstly because the synonyms aren't the same. One can have a stiff/hard/erect penis, but saying a stiff/hard/erect hair or stiff/hard/erect ears is not right. --Daleusher (talk)\n\nI did some research regarding collocations of the aforementioned word with various body parts, collating the results against some images and some *ahem* educational videos (sometimes being a lexicographer one has to make sacrifices, you know). It turns out one could also talk about nipples being erect, hard, or stiff. So maybe we could lump together nipples and penises in one definition, and have erect hairs and ears under another sense, or subsense if you really want. Meanwhile, I'm gonna do some more lexi-research into erect body parts. I'll let you know my findings. --Daleusher (talk)\n\nErect modifying penis is sum of parts. Erect modifying man usually is not. You're likely talking about his penis instead of his posture. According to gamer lore, Squad Leader had an example in the rules about an erect man exposing himself in an aperture. That made sense in context but there was lots of giggling because of the double entendre.

Vox Sciurorum (talk)\n\nI'm a little confused here, shouldn't the English IPA pronunciation of words like trip be /t͡ʃɹɪp/, instead of the listed /tɹɪp/? As a native English speaker in America, I've only ever heard words like \"trip\" be pronounced with a hard plosive on the t in heavy (usually foreign) accents. Although, I'm seeing the /tɹ.../ pronunciation listed on the entries for train, travel, trade, and all other \"tr-\" entries I'm looking up too, so maybe I'm missing something here? – Guitarmankev1 (talk)\n\nHey, @Guitarmankev1. I'm sure someone else can give a better explanation. I once looked up the same question a long time ago. The answer went something like this: for that particular sound cluster, there's no other possible sound between /t/ and /ɹ/, so they don't waste space in dictionaries writing /ʃ/. There are, however, native English speakers who really do pronounce the /t/ and the /ɹ/ separately. -- Dentonius (my politics | talk)\n\nI don't understand; /t͡ʃɹɪp/ would be *chrip, not trip. Maybe in quick speech, they would be indistinguishable, but in reasonably calm speech the two are clearly distinguishable.--Prosfilaes (talk)\n\nIt’s between slashes, as a phonemic (not phonetic) representation. There’s no phonemic distinction between /t/ and /t͡ʃ/ before /ɹ/ when they’re in a syllable-initial cluster together, so [t͡ʃ] in American English can be analyzed as an allophone of /t/ in this position. (I’m not convinced it’s necessarily phonetically [t͡ʃ] either, at least in my idiolect; I’d give it as [ʈ(ʂ)], with the /t/ assimilating to the following retroflex [ɻʷ].) — Vorziblix (talk · contribs)\n\nAs the others have said, many people in the U.S. (and maybe other countries as well) render /tɹ/ as something similar to [t͡ʃɹ̥], but (1) it's not phonemic, and (2) not everyone does it. When I was about 5 years old, my mother was astonished that I had spelled train as \"chrain\" on something I had written. She said, \"Why would you spell it [t͡ʃɹeɪn]? You don't pronounce it [t͡ʃɹeɪn]!\" and I said, \"Daddy does.\" Sure enough, my father did pronounce /tɹ/ as [t͡ʃɹ], and my mother didn't – even though they grew up in the same city. (I don't pronounce it [t͡ʃɹ] as an adult myself.) In principle, we could include it as an alternative phonetic realization, though actually I'm opposed to including minor phonetic details in pronunciation sections. I think users are helped much more by \"/tɹeɪn/\" than they are by \"[ʈ͡ʂʷẽɪ̃n]\" or the like, which makes it difficult to see the forest for the chrees. —Mahāgaja · talk\n\nAt you know, there's a link to an audio file from VOA Learning English, but that audio file can't be played by clicking, and it doesn't bring up an error message either.

Is this a regular thing? —Globins (yo)\n\nYes, it's regular. The exact development is uncertain but can be guessed at: /pl/ → /pj/ (as in Italian piano) → /tj/ (the change of palatalized labials to palatalized coronals is rare but not unprecedented; for example, there are dialects of Czech in which pivo is pronounced /ˈtʲɪvo/) → /t͡ʃ/ (compare colloquial British English /t͡ʃuːn/ for tune). It's possible there was an intermediate stage /ptj/ between /pj/ and /tj/, which has a parallel in French, e.g. sache from Old French sapche /sapt͡ʃə/ < */saptja/ < */sapja/ < Latin sapiat. Another possible intermediate stage is /pʎ/ between /pl/ and /pj/, which would also serve as the source of Spanish ll /ʎ/ in llano. Note that /kl/ developed exactly the same as /pl/ in West Iberian, thus Portuguese chave and Spanish llave from Latin clavis. So if someone were to reconstruct proto-West Iberian, maybe it would have a sound change where /kl/ and /pl/ merged as /tʎ/ or the like, giving /t͡ʃ/ in Portuguese and /ʎ/ in Spanish. —Mahāgaja · talk\n\n@Globins, Mahagaja Also fl- (Portuguese chama / Spanish llama < Latin flamma; Portuguese achar / Spanish hallar < Latin afflāre; Portuguese cheirar < Vulgar Latin *flagrāre < Latin fragrāre; Portuguese chor < Latin flōrem).

Vox Sciurorum (talk)\n\nFrom what I can tell, it can be either derogatory or endearing. I added a usage note rather than a long label. Ultimateria (talk)\n\nThe Spanish Wikipedia labels it “derogatory, vulgar”. --Lambiam\n\nHello Wiktionary Community,\n\nThis could be futile, but I think the world is overdue for a commonly used root word as described in the following short web pages and I would greatly appreciate any advice or assistance with filling this void:\n\nhttp://riar.depuzzler.com\n\nhttp://ryr.depuzzler.com\n\nIf words with a similar meaning already exist (perhaps in other languages?), then please let me know and the challenge becomes how to get them into common use.\n\nThank you,\n\n--Overdue Word (talk)\n\nWe don't invent new words here, we just document real ones that are already in use. Equinox ◑\n\nOK, but I would still like to invite others seeing this to help outside of Wiktionary then (thru the web pages above). My teetering faith in our culture is still holding out hope that someone here might know of some \"real ones that are already in use\" (from any language) with similar definitions that could help humanity's sanity. Thank you, --Overdue Word (talk)\n\nWhich animal's young is an anagram of the animal itself? --Daleusher (talk)\n\n@Daleusher. Sorry, it was driving me crazy. I cheated. The answer is flyblow. ;-) -- Dentonius (my politics | talk)\n\n10 points. Your prize is a classic joke. A) My wife has gone to the Caribbean? B) Jamaica? A) No, she went on her own free will. Daleusher (talk)\n\nYay. :-) Good one. For a second, I thought you were going to tell me a dirty joke I heard as a kid about a Jamaican and a tourist. -- Dentonius (my politics | talk)\n\nWendy? Daleusher (talk)\n\nYeah, Wendy :-) - Dentonius (my politics | talk)\n\nAs in “Welcome to Jamaica, have a nice day”. --Lambiam\n\nI guess everybody and their grandma knows it. :-) -- Dentonius (my politics | talk)\n\nI found another baby animal that's an anagram of the animal itself. A little more tricky, as I didn't just edit its Wiktionary entry. This one's worth 20 points. Daleusher (talk)\n\nMy crappy attempt: \"ling (fish)\" and \"fishling\". Equinox ◑\n\nNope Daleusher (talk)\n\nMy guess: burg (“hamburger”) and grub (“larva, maggot”). ←₰-→ Lingo Bingo Dingo (talk)\n\nYes, that's right, LBD, because a hamburger is obviously an animal, and a grub is clearly a baby hamburger. Daleusher (talk)\n\nBah, mere carnist minutiae! ←₰-→ Lingo Bingo Dingo (talk)\n\nFor the sake of transparency, Daleusher (talk • contribs) was trolling you with the comment \"I found another baby animal that's an anagram of the animal itself\". Candle-holding servant (talk)\n\nHere's one for you: which pair of synonyms for an animal are anagrams? ←₰-→ Lingo Bingo Dingo (talk)\n\naalscholver and schollevaar ←₰-→ Lingo Bingo Dingo (talk)\n\nThis is defined specifically in relation to COVID-19, but it is clearly used in relation to other diseases as well. Also, is the relevant sense of fever \"increased body temperature\" as a symptom or \"state of anxiety\"? ←₰-→ Lingo Bingo Dingo (talk)\n\nWhy not get some cites into the entry? Both pre- and post-COVID. DCDuring (talk)\n\nPre-COVID: [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22]\n\nPost-COVID: [23] [24] [25]\n\nIn the mid-20th century a type of rheumatic fever clinic was in use, so a search for \"fever clinic*\" will include those as false positives. It still seems to be a distinct type of institution in rheumatology. ←₰-→ Lingo Bingo Dingo (talk)\n\n@DCDuring What's your view on the linked hits? I can put some on the citation page if you want. ←₰-→ Lingo Bingo Dingo (talk)\n\nThe cites seem to support a generalized definition, showing that a fever clinic seems to make sense in the real world only in cases where there is a need to distinguish causes of the fevers in relative isolation, because at least one cause is highly contagious and dangerous. DCDuring (talk)\n\nWorth entries? PUC –\n\nFairlex idioms has for all to see. DCDuring (talk)\n\nHow about the synonymous in front of God and everybody/everyone? DCDuring (talk)\n\n“For all the world to behold”[26]; “for all the world to hear”;[27] “for all the world to enjoy”;[28] ...; something tells me the collocation “for all the world to see” is not a fixed idiomatic expression. Perhaps “for all (the world) to” is. --Lambiam\n\nI hereby nominate see to be a placeholder for any kind of perception, just as someone is a placeholder for any noun referring to a person (or sentient organism). DCDuring (talk)\n\nI wouldn't say so. To me there seems precious little meaning in \"for all to see\" beyond just what the words say, or obvious figurative extensions thereto that also exist in numerous other contexts. The only additional idiomaticity in \"for all the world to see\" might reside in \"the world\" not literally meaning the entirety of the planet or its inhabitants, but this is an obvious hyperbole or, if you like, an extended sense of \"world\", that commonly exists outside of that one phrase, e.g. \"Don't tell the whole world!\" when someone is speaking too loudly, or whatever. Mihia (talk)\n\nCoincidentally, I was already thinking about and wanting to revisit the 2015 discussion of the 'feces' sense, and wondering if we had any Australian contributors who could confirm or deny that it's used there, when I saw a user indeed say it's used there. (At the time, the unfamiliarity of an Australian with the sense, and the fact that it appears to be more common in the US and UK, led to the impression it was little-used in Australia.) Any of our other Aussie editors have input? The \"US, UK\" label should be dropped if the term is not regionally restricted. - -sche (discuss)\n\nAussies may use the spelling diarrhoea, which is the spelling in New Zealand. DonnanZ (talk)\n\nI suspect Britain has been included in the label because diarrhoea has been treated as the poor relation and diarrhea as the main entry. Maybe (as diarrhoea) should be added after the label somehow. DonnanZ (talk)\n\nI may have missed your point: I am sure sense 2 is used in NZ (and probably in Oz), so the label could be removed I think. DonnanZ (talk)\n\nThe simple past wir/sie forms for speien and schreien (spieen and schrieen) seem to contradict both de.wiktionary and Duden (spien and schrien) I tried fixing this within the de-conj-strong template, but it appears this template will always generate spieen and schrieen. Does anyone know a workaround, or do I need to put the forms in manually using the de-conj template? 1998alexkane (talk)\n\n@1998alexkane: Both are correct. According to § 19 of the pseudo-official rules from 1996, 2006: »Folgen auf -ee oder -ie die Flexionsendungen oder Ableitungssuffixe -e, -en, -er, -es, -ell, so lässt man ein e weg.\n\nDas betrifft Wörter wie: die Feen; die Ideen; die Mondseer, des Sees; die Knie, knien; die Fantasien; sie schrien, geschrien; ideell; industriell.« The Duden website of course follows these pseudo-official rules (which they changed to sell more dictionaries), and German Wiktionary always was obsequious in following these alleged ”current” “rules” (conspired by some pedagogues) as was German Wikipedia. Fay Freak (talk)\n\n@Fay Freak: Thanks, I'll add the both correct forms to the subjunctive forms (to put schreien in line with speien) as this is easily done, but if spieen and schrieen are considered correct, I'll leave them, since adding both would require entering in the whole conjugation in manually, it appears.1998alexkane (talk)\n\nAs far as I can tell, spieen/gespieen and schrieen/geschrieen were not considered correct before 1996, nor are they considered correct today, but there seems to have been a time between 1996 and 2006 when they were optional alternatives to spien/gespien and schrien/geschrien. I don't know how much actual use they saw in that time, though. They probably shouldn't be included in headword lines or inflection tables, but can have entries indicating their nonstandard status. —Mahāgaja · talk\n\n@Fay Freak, Mahāgaja: At least according to a quick search I did through through the Google N-gram viewer, both forms appear to have frequent use in published writing, even today.1998alexkane (talk)\n\n@Lambiam, Fay Freak, Leasnam, et al.:\n\nWe do not really include this that much in our definition, but can't entzwei function as the equivalent of English \"in twain\"? It appears to be used that way in, for instance, Rumpelstiltskin. Tharthan (talk)\n\nThat would be a usable translation if it was not archaic. A more modern translation is “in two”, with the understanding that this means “divided into two parts” (which before formed a whole). Like most German adjectives, it can also be used as an adverb. The declension table should be removed; you cannot say *ein entzweies Männchen. A good usex and usage note may be in order. --Lambiam\n\nWell, if you search “ein entzweier”, “ein entzweies” and the like, you see the colloquial and some dialects have often tried to use it attributively. Where one also uses zu, aus, durch, an etc. attributively. Eine zue Tür, ein durcher Käse etc., which is bare subliterary and sounds childisch but this is like the situation with adverbs in -weise, especially teilweise, a pattern which one now, though controversial hundred years ago, cannot but use particularly in formal writing: »Die klageweise Durchsetzung …«. Fay Freak (talk)\n\nLambiam complains about \"in twain\" being archaic, and yet Fay Freak used the Middle English word childisch above! :O Tharthan (talk)\n\nI saw that, which was caused by my writing German in between rather than being exposed to Middle English, but I reckoned it was not even worth a minor edit to drop that letter. Otherwise I of course embrace archaic, rare, and provincial words, we are in a dictionary. Fay Freak (talk)\n\nI was studying German via the German version of Cat Quest (logical, no?) and was greeted with \"Nutzen den linker Stick um zu rennen!\", or \"use the left analog stick in order to run!\" Except that Stick doesn't have any meaning besides USB-Stick. Is this a mistranslation or something missing from Wiktionary? stick offers Schaltknüppel (a schalt (to scold) Knüppel (cudgel)?) as a translation for the airplane control stick sense.--Prosfilaes (talk)\n\nIt is bad German anyway; it should be either “Nutzen Sie den linken Stick(?) um zu rennen!” or “Den linken Stick(?) nutzen um zu rennen!”. German Stick is a loanword from English; as far as I know it is not usual to use it in this sense, but a Schaltknüppel (literally “shift club”) is specifically the stick of a stick shift while for an airplane one has a Steuerknüppel (literally “steer club”). Neither is quite appropriate for a multi-functional analog stick, so I can imagine the translator loaning another sense from English. German Stick has many other uses already: [29], [30], [31]; all directly or indirectly borrowed. --Lambiam\n\n@Lambiam: Agreeing with your grammar here, but the word choice is also right; Stick is of utmost pervasion in this sense. Other computing senses also apply for this loanword, RAM-Stick and whatever. Steuerknüppel is also used for the stick on a gaming controller. Schaltknüppel – from schalten, @Prosfilaes – I consider strange in the sense of the stick on a gaming controller and do not find in such use, correspondingly. Fay Freak (talk)\n\nCool, thanks. It does feel like German isn't covered as well as it should be for a major world language, but I'm not really the person to handle it.--Prosfilaes (talk)\n\nI wrote at the talk page, but it seems nobody has noticed, so I'll copy it here:\n\nThe template fails to show the correct definite plural form of words like \"liten\". If we look at the table here, we will draw the conclusion that the definite plural form of \"liten\" is \"lilla\" because that is what's put under \"Definite\" \"All\".\n\nShould there be a separate row for the definite plural form? Otherwise if the definite plural form and the indefinite plural form are always the same, the \"Plural\" row should be moved out of the \"Indefinite\" group and the title of that row should be changed to \"Plural Both\" or something else that shows it is both for the definite and the indefinite.\n\nAnother question is the doc just says \"write liten|litet|lille|lilla|små|mindre|minste|minsta|minsta|minst\" without stating the order in which the forms"
