Associated with Chrome is V8, a new open source JavaScript engine that's designed to execute JavaScript code at never-seen-before speeds.\n\nAll this reminded Marc-Andr√© Cournoyer (of Thin fame) of HotRuby (see previously on Ruby Inside), an experimental JavaScript-based virtual machine that can run YARV-compiled Ruby code, and he set out to test the performance of Ruby code running on HotRuby on top of V8. The results are far from scientific and many commenters have pointed out flaws, but Marc's observations are a great first step toward seriously considering the possibility of using JavaScript as an execution route for Ruby. It also appears that Hongli Lai and Ninh Bui of Phusion (of mod_rails / Passenger fame) are considering the possibilities."
