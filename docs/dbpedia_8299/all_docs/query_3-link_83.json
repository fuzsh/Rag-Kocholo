        "text": "A month ago, I was awarded a fellowship at the Eyebeam Art + Technology Center in New York. The broad theme of my fellowship is programming language design, but the primary project will be Zajal! Here are some notes about what I hope my time here will bring.\n\nBetter Blogging\n\nI’m making it a goal to document the process of developing the language better through this blog. So, for those of you curious how these things get built, stay tuned!\n\nNext Steps\n\nTo take the project forward, two things have to happen:\n\nIn the short term, the current branch needs to be made generally usable by stabilizing it, rounding it off, and improving documentation. This will culminate in Zajal 0.3.4.\n\nIn the long term, Zajal needs to be rewritten from the ground up for it to fulfill it potential. This will culminate in Zajal 0.4.\n\nFinishing the current branch is important, because a rewrite will take time and I want to start user testing as soon as possible. Rewriting is important because the current codebase, has become very difficult to build on, and exciting features like iOS support and true Ruby Gems integration will only be possible by starting over. All the lessons learned from previous Zajal versions will direct the implementation of the new codebase.\n\nWork on both fronts will start immediately and progress in parallel, with more emphasis placed on the current branch initially.\n\nBetter Instruction\n\nZajal’s biggest problem, in my opinion, is that not enough effort has been made to make it easy to get into. Efforts to correct this will include better, more consistent documentation, and tons more built in examples that are specific to topics of functionality.\n\nHack Sessions and Workshops\n\nI plan to use the space at Eyebeam to hold hack sessions, game jams, workshops, and other coding events. I’ll be posting dates on this blog. If you’re in New York, stop by!\n\nCrazy Ideas\n\nNo promises, but this is what’s been on my mind\n\nMobile Support\n\nThe architecture I have in mind for iOS/Android support is really exciting. I’m imagining a Zajal app you would get off the App store for your device. When launched, this app would make itself visible on the local wifi network. The Zajal interpreter running on your computer will check for any devices on the network, and push any code changes it picks up to them. So, you’ll be able to code as normal, and Zajal will push your changes over the network to any listening devices! The app will store any sketch it receives, so it can relaunch them later without need for a computer. So, you’ll be building a portable sketchbook as you go! Awesome!\n\nBrowser Support\n\nThis is a long way off, but through godless unholy trickery, it is technically possible to compile Ruby code into JavaScript and run it in a browser. Precedents include HotRuby and Emscripten. Seriously, though, here be dragons. A lot of people have asked for this, so I’m looking for the most efficient way to pull it off. My main concern is having to reimplement large portions of openFrameworks in HTML 5.\n\nGems and Bundles"
