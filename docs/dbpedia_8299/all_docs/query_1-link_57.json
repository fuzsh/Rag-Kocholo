        "text": "No matter how many times I declare that I am going to start being healthier, make better food choices, be a bit more conscious of what I am fueling my body with, if anyone comes round with the hint, smell or offer of fried chicken, I am right there like a Hoover. Here’s a deliciously moist, tender, lightly spiced fried chicken recipe for you to chuck straight into a brioche bun and top with coleslaw, jalapeños, cheese and lettuce. I’m not drooling. You are...\n\nFried chicken\n\nIngredients\n\nFor the marinade (leave the chicken in it overnight)\n\n700ml buttermilk\n\n750g chicken fillet (sliced)\n\n2.5tsp sea salt flakes\n\n2tsp creole spice\n\n1.5tsp garlic powder\n\n1.5tsp black pepper\n\n1.5tsp oregano\n\nFor the coating\n\n400g plain flour\n\n1.5tsp sea salt flakes\n\n1.5tsp creole spice\n\n1.25tsp black pepper\n\n1.25tsp garlic powder\n\n1tsp oregano\n\nTo fry\n\nVegetable oil, enough to shallow fry\n\nMethod\n\nInto a large bowl, add the chicken and all the marinade ingredients and mix well.

Grab the marinated chicken fillets and roll each piece separately in the seasoned flour, shaking off all excess.\n\nInto a large saucepan, pour in the vegetable oil and bring to a medium/high heat. Fry a few of the mini fillets at a time to ensure the temperature of the oil remains constant – do not be tempted to chuck them all in at once!\n\nFry on each side for a few mins, until a nice golden brown colour. Place on a rack.\n\nPop the rack of fried chicken into the oven at 180C for around 15-20 mins to continue to cook and crisp out.\n\nGrab all your burger essentials, place them all into a bun and... well, you know the rest.\n\nNow read:\n\nThe ultimate summer BBQ recipe by Ruby Bhogal\n\nDishoom: three recipes you have to make\n\nThe best fried chicken in London\n\nWatches\n\nHenry Cavill's iconic military watches are the real star of The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare\n\nIn Guy Ritchie's latest masterpiece, the wristwear could not be more on point – with Cavill wearing the Jaeger-LeCoultre and Cyma from the Dirty Dozen, a legendary collection of military watches actually worn by soldiers in WW2\n\nFashion\n\nA non-sneakerhead's guide to Nike Snkrs Day 2023\n\nEverything you need to know about the biggest trainer event of the year\n\nFashion\n\nOK, so Tom Hardy is into some real niche sneakers\n\nOn the set of Venom, the actor outed himself as a serious grail hunter\n\nCulture\n\nHow Snoop Dogg became the unofficial mascot of Paris 2024\n\nThe rapper is popping up everywhere at the games – and being his inimitable self throughout\n\nFashion\n\nStone cold Kim Yeji is already the fashion star of the Olympics 2024\n\nWith sci-fi shades and the glare of a Ridley Scott action hero, the South Korean athlete medalled in her Olympic debut – and sent the internet on fire\n\nCulture\n\nThe 15 best summer films for after the sun goes down\n\nCall Me By Your Name, American Graffiti and thirteen other films that bottle the sensations of teenage summers, holiday flings and 12 hours in a beer garden\n\nWatches\n\nOf course Cole Palmer has the iciest, coldest Rolex there is\n\nEngland's best performer at Euro 2024 has a grail watch worthy of his burgeoning reputation\n\nLifestyle\n\nThe ten weirdest events in Olympic Games history: from pistol duelling to poodle clipping\n\nThe Olympic motto is ‘Citius, altius, fortius’ (faster, higher, stronger).
