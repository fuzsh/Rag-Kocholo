        "text": "Webfonts allow you to embed the font into a webpage using the @font-face rule, so paragraphs and headings of text can be styled as the webfont. You will be serving the webfont kit for your own site and linking it in the CSS.\n\nWebfonts can be used on a single domain. Agencies responsible for multiple websites, for example web design agencies or hosting providers, may not share a single webfont license across multiple websites.\n\nIf the font file itself won't be embedded in the website (for example, when the font is used in a static graphic image such as a logo) you should purchase a Desktop license instead.\n\nMost foundries on MyFonts offer their webfonts with the Annual license model. Click here to Learn more.\n\nFor the most common uses, both personal and professional, for use in desktop applications with a font menu.\n\nFor example:\n\nInstall the font on your Mac OS X or Windows system\n\nUse the font within desktop applications such as Microsoft Word, Mac Pages, Adobe InDesign, Adobe Photoshop, etc.\n\nCreate and print documents, as well as static images (.jpeg, .tiff, .png)\n\nDesktop licenses are based on the number of users of the fonts. You can change the number of users by clicking the quantity dropdown option on Buying Choices or Cart pages.\n\nPlease be sure to review the listing foundry's as some restrictions may applyâ€”such as use in logos/trademarks, geographic restrictions (number of locations), and products that will be sold.\n\nYou can use an Electronic Doc license to embed the font in an electronic publication such as an eBook, eMagazine, eNewspaper, or interactive PDF.\n\nAn Electronic Doc license is based on the number of publications in which the font is used. Each issue counts as a separate publication. Regional or format variations don't count as separate publications.\n\nUpdated versions of publications that are free to previous customers do not need a new license; otherwise, each new version that is released counts as a separate publication.\n\nFor font usage in graphic images shown as the ePub cover, consider a Desktop license instead as most allow for it.\n\nYou can use this type of license to embed fonts into digital ads, such as ads built using HTML5.\n\nWe'll supply a kit containing webfonts that can be used within digital ads, such as banner ads. This kit may be shared with third parties who are working on your behalf to produce the ad creatives, however you are wholly responsible for it.\n\nHTML5 ads use webfonts, so why purchase a Digital Ads license rather than a Webfont license?\n\nThere are a few reasons, such as the Digital Ads EULA having terms that enable usage in digital ads and on advertising networks.\n\nDigital advertisements also have different usage patterns compared to websites. Most websites generally have consistent pageviews month-to-month whereas advertising impressions can vary wildly month-to-month. Prices reflect this, making it much less expensive to use a Digital Ad license.\n\nIf you know the number of impressions the campaign requires, that amount can be ordered before the campaign begins. For campaigns where number impressions is unknown until the end of the campaign, you can true up at the end of each calendar month."
