        "text": "Book sales by and large provide a fair picture of what’s buzzing in\n\ntechnology and what might be the technology to watch out for in the\n\nnear future. There’s certainly an assumption in this that all\n\nbooks are well written and well marketed and they are being bought\n\nbased solely on reader interest in the technology.\n\nTim\n\nO’Reilly in a recent\n\npost has noted which books and technologies are hitting\n\nthe mark for O’Reilly. Here are some of the highlights –\n\n“A lot of people have missed just how\n\nmuch Flash is on a roll. Ajax\n\nbooks have slowed down considerably, while books on Macromedia’s\n\nAdobe’s web technologies are really moving.”\n\n“I noted that the AJAX meme seems to\n\nbe waning, but that doesn’t mean\n\nthat the underlying technologies of AJAX are suffering. Javascript: The\n\nDefinitive Guide continues to be one of our all time bestsellers. “\n\n“C# continues to gain significantly\n\non Java in terms of book\n\nsales…”\n\n“What’s notably missing from the\n\nbestseller lists: books on programming\n\nlanguages (besides Javascript). The top programming language books in\n\nlast week’s bookscan report were Learning Python, followed closely by\n\nthe just-released Head First C#. Books on Java, Perl, PHP, and yes,\n\neven Ruby, are well down the list. Books on Linux, MySQL, and security\n\nditto. In the professional computer area, networking, software\n\nengineering, and database books that weren’t specific to any particular\n\ndatabase product were the overall winners.”\n\nDo you think these facts depict a true picture of what’s happening in technology? Which technologies do you think are hot and buzzing?\n\nReference – A Year in O’Reilly Books (2007)\n\nRelated\n\n* Pirates\n\nof the IT world: The Curse of the Black Bazaar\n\n* Eric\n\nSink On The Business Of Software – Book Review\n\n* Python Programming Resource"
