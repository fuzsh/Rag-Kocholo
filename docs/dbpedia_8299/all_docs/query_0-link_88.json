        "text": "1. Facebook\n\nTechnical Background:\n\n–Facebook is an online social networking service headquartered in Menlo Park, California. Its name comes from a colloquialism for the directory given to students at some American universities. Facebook was founded on February 4, 2004, by Mark Zuckerbergwith his college roommates and fellow Harvard University students Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes. The founders had initially limited the website’s membership to Harvard students, but later expanded it to colleges in the Boston area, the Ivy League, and Stanford University. It gradually added support for students at various other universities and later to their high-school students. Facebook now allows anyone who claims to be at least 13 years old worldwide to become a registered user of the website, although proof is not required.\n\nAfter registering to use the site, users may create a personal profile, add other users as friends, exchange messages, post status updates and photos, and receive notifications when others update their profiles. Additionally, users may join common-interest user groups, organized by workplace, school or college, or other characteristics, and categorize their friends into lists such as “People From Work” or “Close Friends”. Facebook had over one billion active users as of September 2012, of which approximately 9% were fake. By that point, Facebook was adding about half a petabyte of data every 24 hours, amounting to about 180 petabytes per year. Due to the large volume of data collected about users, the service’s privacy policies have faced scrutiny, among other criticisms. Facebook, Inc. held its initial public offering in February 2012 and began selling stock to the public three months later, reaching a peak market capitalization of $104 billion.\n\nCompany Profile:\n\nZuckerberg wrote a program called Facemash on October 28, 2003 while attending Harvard as a sophomore. According to The Harvard Crimson, the site was comparable to Hot or Not and “used photos compiled from the online facebooks of nine houses, placing two next to each other at a time and asking users to choose the ‘hotter’ person”\n\nTo accomplish this, Zuckerberg hacked into protected areas of Harvard’s computer network and copied private dormitory ID images. Harvard did not have a student “Facebook” (a directory with photos and basic information) at the time, although individual houses had been issuing their own paper facebooks since the mid-1980s. Facemash attracted 450 visitors and 22,000 photo-views in its first four hours online.\n\nThe site was quickly forwarded to several campus group list-servers, but was shut down a few days later by the Harvard administration. Zuckerberg faced expulsion and was charged by the administration with breach of security, violating copyrights, and violating individual privacy. Ultimately, the charges were dropped. Zuckerberg expanded on this initial project that semester by creating a social study tool ahead of an art history final. He uploaded 500 Augustan images to a website, and each image was featured with a corresponding comments section. He shared the site with his classmates and people started sharing notes.\n\nThe following semester, Zuckerberg began writing code for a new website in January 2004. He said he was inspired by an editorial about the Facemash incident in The Harvard Crimson. On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched “Thefacebook”, originally located at thefacebook.com.\n\nSix days after the site launched, three Harvard seniors (Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra) accused Zuckerberg of intentionally misleading them into believing he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com. They claimed he was instead using their ideas to build a competing product. The three complained to The Harvard Crimson and the newspaper began an investigation. They later filed a lawsuit against Zuckerberg, subsequently settling in 2008 for 1.2 millionshares (worth $300 million at Facebook’s IPO).\n\nSignificance and Purpose:\n\nMost of Facebook’s revenue comes from advertising. Facebook generally has a lower clickthrough rate (CTR) for advertisements than most major Web sites. According to BusinessWeek.com, banner advertisements on Facebook have generally received one-fifth the number of clicks compared to those on the Web as a whole, although specific comparisons can reveal a much larger disparity. For example, while Google users click on the first advertisement for search results an average of 8% of the time (80,000 clicks for every one million searches), Facebook’s users click on advertisements an average of 0.04% of the time (400 clicks for every one million pages).\n\nSarah Smith, who was Facebook’s Online Sales Operations Manager until 2012, reported that successful advertising campaigns on the site can have clickthrough rates as low as 0.05% to 0.04%, and that CTR for ads tend to fall within two weeks. By comparison, the CTR for competing social network MySpace is about 0.1%, about 2.5 times better than Facebook’s rate, but still low compared to many other sites.[citation needed]\n\nThe cause of Facebook’s low CTR has been attributed to younger users enabling ad blocking software and their adeptness at ignoring advertising messages, as well as the site’s primary purpose being social communication rather than content viewing. According to digital consultancy iStrategy Labs in mid-January 2014, three million fewer users aged between 13 and 17 years were present on Facebook’s Social Advertising platform compared to 2011. However, Time Writer and Reporter Christopher Matthews stated in the wake of the iStrategy Labs results:\n\nA big part of Facebook’s pitch is that it has so much information about its users that it can more effectively target ads to those who will be responsive to the content. If Facebook can prove that theory to be true, then it may not worry so much about losing its cool cachet.\n\nZuckerberg, alongside other Facebook executives, have questioned the data in such reports; although, a former Facebook senior employee has commented: “Mark [Zuckerberg] is very willing to recognize the strengths in other products and the flaws in Facebook.”\n\nOn pages for brands and products, however, some companies have reported CTR as high as 6.49% for Wall posts. A study found that, for video advertisements on Facebook, over 40% of users who viewed the videos viewed the entire video, while the industry average was 25% for in-banner video ads.\n\nThe company released its own set of revenue data at the end of January 2014 and claimed: Revenues of US$2.59 billion were generated for the three months ending December 31, 2013; earnings per share were 31 cents; revenues of US$7.87 billion were made for the entirety of 2013; and Facebook’s annual profit for 2013 was US$1.5 billion. During the same time, independent market research firm eMarketer released data in which Facebook accounted for 5.7 per cent of all global digital ad revenues in 2013 (Google’s share was 32.4 per cent). Revenue for the June 2014 quarter rose to $2.68 billion, an increase of 67 per cent over the second quarter of 2013. Mobile advertising revenue accounted for around 62 per cent of advertising revenue, an increase of approximately 41 per cent over the comparable quarter of the previous year.\n\nConceptual Development and Implementation:\n\nFacebook is developed as one monolithic application. According to an interview in 2012 with Chuck Rossi, a build engineer at Facebook, Facebook compiles into a 1.5 GB binary blob which is then distributed to the servers using a custom BitTorrent-based release system. Rossi stated that it takes approximately 15 minutes to build and 15 minutes to release to the servers. The build and release process is zero downtime and new changes to Facebook are rolled out daily.\n\nFacebook used a combination platform based on HBase to store data across distributed machines. Using a tailing architecture, new events are stored in log files, and the logs are tailed. The system rolls these events up and writes them into storage. The User Interface then pulls the data out and displays it to users. Facebook handles requests as AJAXbehavior. These requests are written to a log file using Scribe (developed by Facebook).\n\nQuality Attributes:\n\nOn October 24, 2007, Microsoft announced that it had purchased a 1.6% share of Facebook for $240 million, giving Facebook a total implied value of around $15 billion. Microsoft’s purchase included rights to place international adverts on the social networking site.In October 2008, Facebook announced that it would set up its international headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. In September 2009, Facebook said that it had turned cash-flow positive for the first time. In November 2010, based on SecondMarket Inc. (an exchange for privately held companies’ shares), Facebook’s value was $41 billion; it slightly surpassed eBay‘s to become the third largest American web company after Google and Amazon.com.\n\nTraffic to Facebook increased steadily after 2009. More people visited Facebook than Google for the week ending March 13, 2010.\n\nIn March 2011, it was reported that Facebook takes approximately 20,000 profiles offline every day for infractions including spam, inappropriate content and underage use, as part of its efforts to boost cyber security\n\nTo allay concerns about privacy, Facebook enables users to choose their own privacy settings and choose who can see specific parts of their profile. The website is free to users, and generates revenue from advertising, such as banner ads.]Facebook requires a user’s name and profile picture (if applicable) to be accessible by everyone. Users can control who sees other information they have shared, as well as who can find them in searches, through their privacy settings.[205]\n\nAccording to comScore, an internet marketing research company, Facebook collects as much data from its visitors as Google and Microsoft, but considerably less thanYahoo!. In 2010, the security team began expanding its efforts to reduce the risks to users’ privacy, but privacy concerns remain. On November 6, 2007, Facebook launched Facebook Beacon, which was an ultimately failed attempt advertise to friends of users using the knowledge of what purchases friends made. As of March 2012, Facebook’s usage of its user data is under close scrutiny.\n\nSince 2010 the National Security Agency has been taking Facebook profile information from users to discover who their allies, friends, and colleagues are.\n\nIn August 2013 High-Tech Bridge published a study showing that links included in Facebook messaging service messages were being accessed by Facebook for its own purposes. In January 2014 two users filed a lawsuit against Facebook alleging that their privacy had been violated by this practice.\n\nPossible Problems:\n\nReferences:\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook\n\n2. KiK Messenger\n\nTechnical Background:\n\nKik Messenger is an instant messaging application for mobile devices. The app is available on most iOS, Android, and Windows Phone operating systems free of charge. Kik Messenger is modeled after BlackBerry’s Messenger. Kik uses a smartphone’s data plan or Wi-Fi to transmit and receive messages. Kik also allows users to share photos, sketches, mobile webpages, and other content. Kik Messenger requires users to register a username.\n\nCompany Profile:\n\nKik was founded in 2009, when a small but incredibly passionate group of University of Waterloo students decided to build a company that would shift the center of computing from the PC to the phone.\n\nFast forward to today, and Kik Messenger has become the simplest, fastest, most life-like chat experience you can get on a smartphone. And unlike other messengers, Kik usernames – not phone numbers – are the basis for Kik user accounts, so our users are in complete control of who they talk to on Kik.\n\nBut Kik isn’t just about instant messaging. Kik fans are already exchanging videos, sketches, stickers and more, with mobile web pages optimized for Kik using Kik’s Developer Tools that help developers optimize, distribute and monetize their web content. And with our new built-in browser, users can search for and send any web site – all without leaving Kik, and all without downloading anything new.\n\nTo top it all off, we’re backed by major brand-name VC’s – the same firms that first helped Twitter, Foursquare, Zynga and others rise to world domination.\n\nWith over 150 million users and an incredible team, our plans are well underway.\n\nSignificance and Purpose:\n\nWe believe the smartphone era will be a transformation as big as the rise of the PC or the creation of the Internet. Your smartphone is actually part of you: always on, always connected, and always with you. And your smartphone puts the world in your pocket, wherever and whenever you want it.\n\nAs the first smartphone messenger with a built-in browser, Kik Messenger lets you talk to your friends and browse and share any web site with your friends on Kik. For developers, we’ve built amazing tools to help optimize their web sites for mobile and for Kik. By doing this, we believe we have the chance to usher in the next era – the era of the mobile web.\n\nConceptual Development and Implementation:\n\nDeveloped by KIK INTERACTIVE INC.\n\nKik is the first smartphone messenger with a built-in browser. You can talk, browse and share with your friends.\n\nQuality Attributes:\n\nThis Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) describes how Kik Interactive, Inc. and its subsidiaries with authorized links to this Policy, (collectively, “Kik Group”, “us”, “our” or “we”) collect, store, use and disclose Personal Information (defined below) from individuals (a) who use any of the websites located at www.kik.com, the Kik Optimized Pages (defined below) provided by us and/or all other websites of Kik Group with authorized links to this Policy (the “Sites”), (b) who use our products or services with authorized links to this Policy, including but not limited to our Kik Messenger product, products or services provided by us that you purchase and use within our Kik Messenger product, and the Apps that Kik (defined below) provided by us (the “Products”), or (c) otherwise.

The service was created by three formerPayPal employees in February 2005 and has been owned by Google since late 2006. The site allows users to upload, view, and share videos, and it makes use of Adobe Flash Video and HTML5 technology to display a wide variety of user-generated and corporate media video. Available content includes video clips, TV clips, music videos, and other content such as video blogging, short original videos, and educational videos.\n\nMost of the content on YouTube has been uploaded by individuals, but media corporations including CBS, the BBC,Vevo, Hulu, and other organizations offer some of their material via YouTube, as part of the YouTube partnership program. Unregistered users can watch videos, and registered users can upload an unlimited number of videos. Videos considered to contain potentially offensive content are available only to registered users affirming themselves to be at least 18 years old. YouTube, LLC was bought by Google for US$1.65 billion in November 2006 and now operates as a Google subsidiary.\n\nCompany Profile:\n\nYouTube was founded by Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim, who were all early employees of PayPal. Hurley had studied design at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, and Chen and Karim studied computer science together at theUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\n\nAccording to a story that has often been repeated in the media, Hurley and Chen developed the idea for YouTube during the early months of 2005, after they had experienced difficulty sharing videos that had been shot at a dinner party at Chen’s apartment in San Francisco. Karim did not attend the party and denied that it had occurred, but Chen commented that the idea that YouTube was founded after a dinner party “was probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around creating a story that was very digestible”.\n\nKarim said the inspiration for YouTube first came from Janet Jackson‘s role in the 2004 Super Bowl incident, when her breast was exposed during her performance, and later from the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Karim could not easily find video clips of either event online, which led to the idea of a video sharing site. Hurley and Chen said that the original idea for YouTube was a video version of an online dating service, and had been influenced by the website Hot or Not.[11][12]\n\nYouTube began as a venture-funded technology startup, primarily from a $11.5 million investment by Sequoia Capital between November 2005 and April 2006.YouTube’s early headquarters were situated above a pizzeria and Japanese restaurant in San Mateo, California. The domain name www.youtube.com was activated on February 14, 2005, and the website was developed over the subsequent months.\n\nThe first YouTube video was entitled Me at the zoo, and shows co-founder Jawed Karim at the San Diego Zoo. The video was uploaded on April 23, 2005, and can still be viewed on the site.\n\nSignificance and Purpose:\n\nYouTube has also allowed government to more easily engage with citizens, the White House‘s official YouTube channel being the seventh top news organization producer on YouTube in 2012 and in 2013 a healthcare exchange commissioned Obama impersonator Iman Crosson‘s YouTube music video spoof to encourage young Americans to enroll in the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare)-compliant health insurance. In February 2014, U.S. President Obama held a meeting at the White House with leading YouTube content creators to not only promote awareness of Obamacare but more generally to develop ways for government to better connect with the “YouTube Generation”. Whereas YouTube’s inherent ability to allow presidents to directly connect with average citizens was noted, the YouTube content creators’ new media savvy was perceived necessary to better cope with the website’s distracting content and fickle audience.\n\nSome YouTube videos have themselves had a direct effect on world events, such as Innocence of Muslims (2012) which spurred protests and related anti-American violence internationally.\n\nTED curator Chris Anderson described a phenomenon by which geographically distributed individuals in a certain field share their independently developed skills in YouTube videos, thus challenging others to improve their own skills, and spurring invention and evolution in that field. Journalist Virginia Heffernan asserted in The New York Times that such videos have “surprising implications” for the dissemination of culture and even the future of classical music.[193]\n\nThe Legion of Extraordinary Dancers and the YouTube Symphony Orchestra selected their membership based on individual video performances.Further, the cybercollaboration charity video “We Are the World 25 for Haiti (YouTube edition)” was formed by mixing performances of 57 globally distributed singers into a single musical work, with The Tokyo Times noting the “We Pray for You” YouTube cyber-collaboration video as an example of a trend to use crowdsourcing for charitable purposes.\n\nConceptual Development and Implementation:\n\nA Pew Research Center study reported the development of “visual journalism”, in which citizen eyewitnesses and established news organizations share in content creation. The study also concluded that YouTube was becoming an important platform by which people acquire news.\n\nYouTube has enabled people to more directly engage with government, such as in the CNN/YouTube presidential debates (2007) in which ordinary people submitted questions to U.S. presidential candidates via YouTube video, with a techPresident co-founder saying that Internet video was changing the political landscape.Describing the Arab Spring (2010- ), sociologist Philip N. Howard quoted an activist’s succinct description that organizing the political unrest involved using “Facebook to schedule the protests, Twitter to coordinate, and YouTube to tell the world.”[185] In 2012, more than a third of the U.S. Senate introduced a resolution condemningJoseph Kony 16 days after the “Kony 2012” video was posted to YouTube, with resolution co-sponsor Senator Lindsey Graham remarking that the video “will do more to lead to (Kony’s) demise than all other action combined.\n\nQuality Attributes:\n\nIn April 2012, a court in Hamburg ruled that YouTube could be held responsible for copyrighted material posted by its users. The performance rights organization GEMAargued that YouTube had not done enough to prevent the uploading of German copyrighted music. YouTube responded by stating:\n\n“ We remain committed to finding a solution to the music licensing issue in Germany that will benefit artists, composers, authors, publishers and record labels, as well as the wider YouTube community.[222] ”\n\nAs of 2013, YouTube and GEMA have still not reached a licensing agreement. As a result, most videos containing copyrighted music have been blocked in Germany since 2009.\n\nIn April 2013, it was reported that Universal Music Group and YouTube have a contractual agreement that prevents content blocked on YouTube by a request from UMG from being restored, even if the uploader of the video files a DMCA counter-notice. When a dispute occurs, the uploader of the video has to contact UMG.\n\nDesign Specification:\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube\n\n4.Twitter\n\nTechnical Background:\n\nTwitter is an online social networking and microblogging service that enables users to send and read short 140-charactertext messages, called “tweets”.\n\nRegistered users can read and post tweets, but unregistered users can only read them. Users access Twitter through the website interface, SMS, or mobile device app. Twitter Inc. is based in San Francisco and has offices in New York City,Boston, Austin and Detroit.\n\nTwitter was created in March 2006 by Jack Dorsey, Evan Williams, Biz Stone and Noah Glass and by July 2006 the site was launched. The service rapidly gained worldwide popularity, with 500 million registered users in 2012, who posted 340 million tweets per day. The service also handled 1.6 billion search queries per day. In 2013 Twitter was one of the tenmost-visited websites, and has been described as “the SMS of the Internet.”\n\nCompany Profile:\n\nTwitter’s origins lie in a “daylong brainstorming session” held by board members of the podcasting company Odeo. Dorsey, then an undergraduate student at New York University, introduced the idea of an individual using an SMS service to communicate with a small group. The original project code name for the service was twttr, an idea that Williams later ascribed to Noah Glass, inspired byFlickr and the five-character length of American SMS short codes. The developers initially considered “10958” as a short code, but later changed it to “40404” for “ease of use and memorability.” Work on the project started on March 21, 2006, when Dorsey published the first Twitter message at 9:50 PM Pacific Standard Time (PST): “just setting up my twttr”. Dorsey has explained the origin of the “Twitter” title:\n\n…we came across the word ‘twitter’, and it was just perfect. The definition was ‘a short burst of inconsequential information,’ and ‘chirps from birds’. And that’s exactly what the product was.\n\nThe first Twitter prototype, developed by Dorsey and contractor Florian Weber, was used as an internal service for Odeo employees and the full version was introduced publicly on July 15, 2006.\n\nIn October 2006, Biz Stone, Evan Williams, Dorsey, and other members of Odeo, formed Obvious Corporation and acquired Odeo, together with its assets—including Odeo.com and Twitter.com—from the investors and shareholders. Williams fired Glass, who was silent about his part in Twitter’s startup until 2011. Twitter spun off into its own company in April 2007. Williams provided insight into the ambiguity that defined this early period in a 2013 interview:\n\nWith Twitter, it wasn’t clear what it was. They called it a social network, they called it microblogging, but it was hard to define, because it didn’t replace anything. There was this path of discovery with something like that, where over time you figure out what it is. Twitter actually changed from what we thought it was in the beginning, which we described as status updates and a social utility. It is that, in part, but the insight we eventually came to was Twitter was really more of an information network than it is a social network.\n\nThe tipping point for Twitter’s popularity was the 2007 South by Southwest Interactive (SXSWi) conference. During the event, Twitter usage increased from 20,000 tweets per day to 60,000.”The Twitter people cleverly placed two 60-inch plasma screens in the conference hallways, exclusively streaming Twitter messages,” remarkedNewsweek‘s Steven Levy. “Hundreds of conference-goers kept tabs on each other via constant twitters. Panelists and speakers mentioned the service, and the bloggers in attendance touted it.”\n\nReaction at the conference was highly positive. Blogger Scott Beale said that Twitter “absolutely rul[ed]” SXSWi. Social software researcher danah boyd said Twitter “own[ed]” the conference. Twitter staff received the festival’s Web Award prize with the remark “we’d like to thank you in 140 characters or less. And we just did!”\n\nThe first unassisted off-Earth Twitter message was posted from the International Space Station by NASA astronaut T. J. Creamer on January 22, 2010. By late November 2010, an average of a dozen updates per day were posted on the astronauts’ communal account, @NASA_Astronauts. NASA has also hosted over 25“tweetups”, events that provide guests with VIP access to NASA facilities and speakers with the goal of leveraging participants’ social networks to further the outreach goals of NASA.\n\nIn August 2010, the company appointed Adam Bain from News Corp.‘s Fox Audience Network as president of revenue.\n\nSignificance and Purpose:\n\nOn April 17, 2012, Twitter announced it would implement an “Innovators Patent Agreement” which would obligate Twitter to only use its patents for defensive purposes. The agreement went into effect in 2012.\n\nConceptual Development and Implementation:\n\nTwitter places great reliance on open-source software. The Twitter Web interface uses the Ruby on Rails framework, deployed on a performance enhancedRuby Enterprise Edition implementation of Ruby.\n\nIn the early days of Twitter, tweets were stored in MySQL databases that were temporally sharded, that is the databases were split by time of posting. MySQL was causing problems with both reading and writing to Twitter and the company decided that the system needed re-engineering.\n\nAs of April 6, 2011, Twitter engineers confirmed they had switched away from their Ruby on Rails search stack, to a Java server they call Blender.\n\nFrom Spring 2007 to 2008 the messages were handled by a Ruby persistent queue server called Starling, but since 2009 implementation has been gradually replaced with software written in Scala. The switch from Ruby to Scala and the JVM has given Twitter a performance boost from 200—300 requests per second per host to around 10,000–20,000 requests per second per host. This boost was greater than the 10x improvement that Twitter’s engineers envisioned when starting the switch. The continued development of Twitter has also involved a switch from monolithic development of a single app to an architecture where different services are built independently and joined through remote procedure calls.\n\nThe service’s application programming interface (API) allows other web services and applications to integrate with Twitter.[174][175]\n\nIndividual tweets are registered under unique IDs using software called snowflake and geolocation data is added using ‘Rockdove’. The URL shortner t.co then checks for a spam link and shortens the URL. The tweets are stored in a MySQL database using Gizzard and acknowledged to users as having been sent. They are then sent to search engines via the Firehose API. The process itself is managed by FlockDB and takes an average of 350 ms.[168]\n\nOn August 16, 2013, Twitter’s Vice President of Platform Engineering Raffi Krikorian shared in a blog post that the company’s infrastructure handled almost 143,000 tweets per second during that week, setting a new record. Krikorian explained that Twitter achieved this record by blending its homegrown and open source technologies.\n\nQuality Attributes:\n\nThe service is also used as a form of civil disobedience: in 2010, users expressed outrage over the Twitter Joke Trial by making obvious jokes about terrorism; and in the British privacy injunction debate in the same country a year later, where several celebrities who had taken out anonymised injunctions, most notably theManchester United player Ryan Giggs, were identified by thousands of users in protest to traditional journalism being censored.\n\nAnother, more real time and practical use for Twitter exists as an effective de facto emergency communication system for breaking news. It was neither intended nor designed for high performance communication, but the idea that it could be used for emergency communication certainly was not lost on the originators, who knew that the service could have wide-reaching effects early on when the San Francisco, California company used it to communicate during earthquakes. The Boston Policetweeted news of the arrest of the 2013 Boston Marathon Bombing suspect. Another practical use that is being studied is Twitter’s ability to track epidemics and how they spread. In addition, Twitter has acted as a sensor for automatic response to natural disasters such as bush fires.\n\nTwitter has been used by Somalia‘s al-Shabaab rebels, who had their accounts suspended after they used the site to claim responsibility for an attack on the Westgate Shopping Mall in Nairobi in September 2013.\n\nTwitter messages are public but users can also send private messages.[199] Twitter collects personally identifiable information about its users and shares it with third parties. The service reserves the right to sell this information as an asset if the company changes hands.While Twitter displays no advertising, advertisers cantarget users based on their history of tweets and may quote tweets in ads directed specifically to the user.\n\nA security vulnerability was reported on April 7, 2007, by Nitesh Dhanjani and Rujith. Since Twitter used the phone number of the sender of an SMS message as authentication, malicious users could update someone else’s status page by using SMS spoofing. The vulnerability could be used if the spoofer knew the phone number registered to their victim’s account. Within a few weeks of this discovery Twitter introduced an optional personal identification number (PIN) that its users could use to authenticate their SMS-originating messages.\n\nOn January 5, 2009, 33 high-profile Twitter accounts were compromised after a Twitter administrator’s password was guessed by a dictionary attack. Falsified tweets — including sexually explicit and drug-related messages — were sent from these accounts.\n\nTwitter launched the beta version of their “Verified Accounts” service on June 11, 2009, allowing famous or notable people to announce their Twitter account name. The home pages of these accounts display a badge indicating their status.\n\nIn May 2010, a bug was discovered by İnci Sözlük, involving users that allowed Twitter users to force others to follow them without the other users’ consent or knowledge. For example, comedian Conan O’Brien‘s account, which had been set to follow only one person, was changed to receive nearly 200 malicious subscriptions.\n\nIn response to Twitter’s security breaches, the US Federal Trade Commission brought charges against the service which were settled on June 24, 2010. This was the first time the FTC had taken action against a social network for security lapses. The settlement requires Twitter to take a number of steps to secure users’ private information, including maintenance of a “comprehensive information security program” to be independently audited biannually.\n\nOn December 14, 2010, the United States Department of Justice issued a subpoena directing Twitter to provide information for accounts registered to or associated withWikiLeaks. Twitter decided to notify its users and said in a statement, “…it’s our policy to notify users about law enforcement and governmental requests for their information, unless we are prevented by law from doing so”.\n\nA “MouseOver” exploit occurred on September 21, 2010, when an XSS Worm became active on Twitter. When an account user held the mouse cursor over blacked-out parts of a tweet, the worm within the script would automatically open links and re-post itself on the reader’s account. The exploit was then re-used to post pop-up adsand links to pornographic sites. The origin is unclear but Pearce H. Delphin (known on Twitter as @zzap) and a Scandinavian developer, Magnus Holm, both claim to have modified the exploit of a user, possibly Masato Kinugawa, who was using it to create coloured Tweets. Kinugawa, a Japanese developer, reported the XSS vulnerability to Twitter on August 14. Later, when he found it was exploitable again, he created the account ‘RainbowTwtr’ and used it to post coloured messages.Delphin says he exposed the security flaw by tweeting a JavaScript function for “onMouseOver”, and Holm later created and posted the XSS Worm that automatically re-tweeted itself.Security firm Sophos reported that the virus was spread by people doing it for “fun and games”, but noted it could be exploited by cybercriminals. Twitter issued a statement on their status blog at 13:50 UTC that “The exploit is fully patched“. Twitter representative Carolyn Penner said no charges would be pressed.\n\nIn May 2011, a claimant known as “CTB” (subsequently identified as Ryan Giggs) in the case of CTB v Twitter Inc., Persons Unknown took legal action at the High Court of Justice in London against Twitter, requesting that Twitter release details of account holders. This followed gossip posted on Twitter about Giggs’ private life, causing conflict relating to privacy injunctions. Tony Wang, the head of Twitter in Europe, said that people who do “bad things” on the site would need to defend themselves under the laws of their own jurisdiction in the event of controversy, and that the site would hand over information about users to the authorities when it was legally required to do so. He also suggested that Twitter would accede to a UK court order to divulge names of users responsible for “illegal activity” on the site.\n\nOn May 29, 2011, it was reported that South Tyneside council in England had successfully taken legal action against Twitter in a court in California, which forced Twitter to reveal the details of five user accounts. The council was trying to discover the identity of a blogger called “Mr Monkey” who allegedly posted libellous statements about three local councillors.\n\nOn January 23, 2012, it was reported that Twitter would be acquiring Dasient, a startup that offers malware protection for businesses. Twitter hopes that Dasient will help remove hateful advertisers on the website.[221]\n\nOn January 26, 2012, Twitter began offering a feature which would allow tweets to be removed selectively by country. Twitter cited France and Germany as examples, where pro-Nazi content is illegal. Previously, deleted tweets were removed in all countries. The first use of the policy was to block the account of German neo-Nazi group Besseres Hannover on October 18, 2012. The policy was used again the following day to remove anti-Semitic French tweets with the hashtag #unbonjuif (“a good Jew”).\n\nOn February 20, 2012, a third-party public-key encryption app (written in Python and partially funded by a grant from the Shuttleworth Foundation) for private messaging in Twitter, CrypTweet, was released.\n\nOn May 17, 2012, Twitter announced it would implement the “Do Not Track” privacy option, a cookie-blocking feature found in Mozilla‘s Firefox browser. The “Do Not Track” feature works only on sites that have agreed to the service.\n\nIn August 2012 it was reported that there is a market in fake Twitter followers that are used to increase politicians’ and celebrities’ apparent popularity. The black market for the fake followers, known as “bots”, has been linked to “nearly every poltically linked account from the White House to Congress to the 2016 campaign trail.” In June 2014, POLITICO analyzed Twitter handles with the highest rates of fake followers: US President Barack Obama with 46.8 percent, Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz with 35.1 percent, and Senator John McCain with 23.6 percent. The culprits working to generate the fake followers, or “bots”, include campaign workers or friends of political candidates. One site offers 1,000 fake followers for $20. The people creating the “bots” are often from Eastern Europe and Asia. In 2013, two Italian researchers calculated 10 percent of total accounts on Twitter are “bots” however, other estimates have placed the figure even higher.\n\nIn April 2013 Twitter warned news organizations around the world to secure their Twitter accounts after a number of high profile hacks of official accounts including those of the Associated Press and The Guardian. In May 2013, Twitter announced a two-factor login verification as an added measure against hacking.\n\nIn August 2013, Twitter announced plans to introduce a “report abuse” button for all versions of the site. A petition for making the process of complaining about harassment easier had collected over 100,000 signatures. The move followed the posting of abusive tweets, including rape and death threats to historian Mary Beard, British feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez and the British MP Stella Creasy. Three men were arrested under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 in connection with the incidents.\n\nPossible Problems:\n\nDesign Specification:\n\nReferences:\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter\n\n5.Instagram\n\nTechnical Background:\n\nInstagram is an online mobile photo-sharing, video-sharing and social networking service that enables its users to take pictures and videos, and share them on a variety of social networking platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr andFlickr. A distinctive feature is that it confines photos to a square shape, similar to Kodak Instamatic and Polaroid images, in contrast to the 4:3 aspect ratio typically used by mobile device cameras. Users can also apply digital filters to their images. The maximum duration for Instagram videos is 15 seconds.\n\nInstagram was created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, and launched in October 2010. The service rapidly gained popularity, with over 100 million active users as of April 2012.[9][10] Instagram is distributed through the Apple App Store,Google Play, and Windows Phone Store.[11] Support for the app is available for iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, and Androidhandsets, while third-party Instagram apps are available for Blackberry 10 and Nokia-Symbian Devices.\n\nThe service was acquired by Facebook in April 2012 for approximately US$1 billion in cash and stock. In 2013, Instagram grew by 23%, while Facebook, as the parent company, only grew by 3%.\n\nCompany Profile:\n\nInstagram began development in San Francisco, United States (U.S.), when Systrom and Brazilian Krieger chose to focus their multi-featured HTML5 check-in project,Burbn, on mobile photography.The name “Instagram” is a portmanteau of “instant camera” and “telegram“.\n\nOn March 5, 2010, Systrom closed a US$500,000 seed funding round with Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz while working on Burbn. Josh Riedel then joined the company as Community Manager. Shayne Sweeney joined in November 2010 as an engineer and Jessica Zollman was hired as a Community Evangelist in August 2011.\n\nIn January 2011, Instagram added hashtags to help users discover both photographs and each other.Instagram encourages users to make tags both specific and relevant, rather than tagging generic words like “photo,” to make photographs stand out and to attract like-minded Instagram users. In September, version 2.0 went live in the App Store (iOS) and included new and live filters, instant tilt–shift, high resolution photographs, optional borders, one click rotation, and an updated icon.On February 2, 2011, an announcement revealed that Instagram had raised US$7 million in Series A funding from a variety of investors, including Benchmark Capital,Jack Dorsey, Chris Sacca (through Capital fund), and Adam D’Angelo. The deal valued Instagram at around $25 million.\n\nOn April 3, 2012, Instagram was released for Android phones running the 2.2 Froyo version of the OS, and it was downloaded more than one million times in less than one day. That same week, Instagram raised US$50 million from venture capitalists for a share of the company; the process valued Instagram at US$500 million.Over the next three months, Instagram was rated more than one million times on Google Play and was the fifth app to ever reach one million ratings on Google Play—as of April 2013, it had been rated nearly four million times.\n\nAs part of its second largest acquisition deal to date, Facebook made an offer to purchase Instagram, along with its 13 employees, for approximately US$1 billion in cash and stock in April 2012,with a plan to keep the company independently managed. Britain’s Office of Fair Trading approved the deal on August 14, 2012,and on August 22, 2012, the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S. closed its investigation, allowing the deal to proceed.On September 6, 2012, the deal between Instagram and Facebook was officially closed.\n\nOn April 12, 2012, Facebook acquired Instagram for approximately US$1 billion in cash and stock. The deal, which was made just prior to Facebook’s scheduled IPO, cost about a quarter of Facebook’s cash-on-hand, according to figures documented at the end of 2011. The deal was for a company characterized as having “lots of buzz but no business model“, and the price was contrasted with the US$35 million Yahoo! paid for Flickr in 2005, a website that has since become among the 50 most popular in the world.\n\nSignificance and Purpose:\n\nInstagram is apparently worth a billion dollars to Facebook, so it has to be good for something. For most of its life, it was an iPhone exclusive. But itrecently launched on Android, and it made front-page headlines around the world when it sold to Facebook this month. Its user numbers are skyrocketing.Instagram is a photo-sharing app. Those are a-dime-a-thousand, but Instagram was the first, best one. It’s known for its square image format, its virtual lack of a website and, of course, those nostalgic filters. Instagram is for taking pictures, yes. But that’s not the whole point. Sharing is the fun part.\n\nConceptual Development and Implementation:\n\nOn December 17, 2012, Instagram updated its Terms of Service, granting itself the right—starting on January 16, 2013—to sell users’ photos to third parties without notification or compensation.The criticism from privacy advocates, consumers, the National Geographic Society, and celebrities like Kim Kardashian prompted Instagram to issue a statement retracting the controversial terms; regardless, the issue resulted in the loss of a portion of Instagram’s user-base, as former users switched to other Instagram-like services, such as Pheed, a multi-media social sharing platform launched in November 2012 that gained more new users than any other app in the U.S. the week that Instagram changed its terms of service. Flickr was another service that gained many new users following the announcement—prior to the changes, Yahoo released a new Flickr mobile app for iOS, with built-in vintage filters, to rival Instagram. Instagram subsequently began work on the development of a new language to replace the disputed terms of use.\n\nIn January 2013, it was confirmed that Instagram has asked for photo identification as a form of verification due to unspecified violations.\n\nFollowing the appointment of Emily White to the position of chief operating officer in March 2013, White stated in September 2013 that the company should be ready to begin selling advertising by September 2014 as a way to generate business from a popular entity that had not yet created profit for its parent company. In September 2013, Instagram reaffirmed its commitment to free and open access to its smart-phone app for users. During an interview with Women’s Wear Daily (WWD), White cited “the sophistication of cameras on smartphones as one reason for ushering in the transformative change,” and she used her observation of the replacement of large cameras with mobile smartphones during a fashion show as an example. On October 3, 2013, Instagram announced that it would be adding advertising to its platform.\n\nOn October 22, 2013, during the Nokia World event, held at Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Systrom confirmed the impending release of the official Instagram app for the Windows Phone. On November 21, 2013, the official Instagram Beta for Windows Phone was released to Windows Phone 8 to allow Windows Phone users faster access to Instagram services; although, at the time of release, the app was still under development.\n\nOn December 12, 2013, Instagram added Direct, a feature that allows users to send photos to specific people directly from the app. Instagram’s primary intention with the Direct feature is to compete against messaging services, including Snapchat.\n\nOn March 11, 2014, Instagram released an updated Android app with performance improvements and a flatter interface. The update was primarily intended to reduce the app’s file size and resource usage, and it was optimized for and tested on low-end smartphones sold in emerging markets, such as the Samsung Galaxy Y, which was popular in Brazil at the time.\n\nThe company’s Global Head of Business and Brand Development—a new position for Instagram—was announced in mid-August 2014. Facebook’s former Regional Director James Quarles was assigned the role, which manages Instagram’s revenue strategy, in addition to both the marketing and sales teams. Quarles will report directly to Systrom during a tenure in which he will develop new “monetization products,” as explained by a company representative to the media.\n\nQuality Attributes:\n\nDespite countless new services coming out, Instagram remains popular and widely used. I myself have gone back to using Instagram. It’s a strangely compelling service. However, with the latest update, it has gotten significantly better. Though this update doesn’t add any new features, it’s still awesome.\n\nThis update redesigns the user interface. Instead of the old and ugly interface, you’ll see flat design everywhere. It’s actually quite appealing, though not as much as a Holo redesign would be. Along with the pretty new user interface comes a performance boost, according to Instagram.\n\nPossible Problems:\n\nDesign Specification:\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram\n\nhttp://androidandme.com/2014/03/applications/instagram-gets-updated-with-performance-boost-and-flat-redesigned-ui/\n\nhttp://readwrite.com/2012/04/18/what_is_the_point_of_instagram\n\n6. Viber\n\nTechnical Background:\n\nViber is a proprietary cross-platform instant messaging voice-over-Internet Protocol application for smartphones developed by Viber Media. In addition to text messaging, users can exchange images, video and audio media messages. The client software is available for Mac OS, Android, BlackBerry OS, iOS, Series 40, Symbian, Bada, Windows Phone, and Microsoft Windows. A Linux version is available for Ubuntu 64-bit. Viber works on both 3G/4G and Wi-Fi networks. It first requires installation on a phone in order to work on a desktop operating system environment. Viber has over 100 million monthly active users from its 280 million global registered users.\n\nIt was founded and co-owned by four Israeli partners: Talmon Marco, Igor Megzinik, Sani Maroli and Ofer Smocha.Talmon Marco serves as its CEO. On 14 February 2014, the startup was acquired by Japanese Rakuten for $900 million.\n\nCompany Profile:\n\nViber was initially launched for iPhone on December 2, 2010, in direct competition with Skype. A pre-release version forAndroid appeared in May 2011 but was restricted to 50,000 users; an unrestricted version was released on July 19, 2012. Viber for BlackBerry and Windows Phone devices was launched on May 8, 2012.On reaching 90 million users on July 24, 2012, group messaging service and HD Voice engine were added to both Android and iPhone applications. Applications for Nokia’s Series 40, Symbian and Samsung’s Bada platform were also announced on the same day. Initially, the voice calling feature was only available for iPhone and Android applications, with a promise that voice would be added in upcoming versions for Bada, Symbian and Windows Phone applications, with no mention of either Series 40 orBlackberry OS. The limitation seems to lie in core of Blackberry OS and Series 40 which does not have easy support forVoIP apps. As promised, on September 22, 2012, HD quality phone calls and hold group-messaging sessions were made available for Windows phone but only for Nokia users, as part of exclusive partnership with Nokia. Viber with voice was officially released for all Windows Phone 8 devices on April 2, 2013. In August 2013, Viber for Linux was released as a public beta and in August 2014 a final version. Initially, only 64-bit binaries were made available for download.\n\nOn February 13, 2014, Rakuten announced they had acquired Viber for $900 million.\n\nSignificance and Purpose:\n\nViber may interact with your phone’s SMS inbox or call history for the sole purpose of service activation, placing incoming messages in your inbox, reading the contents of the activation SMS sent to you by Viber. WE WILL NOT ACCESS THE CONTENTS OF ANY OTHER SMS.\n\nViber allows you to attach your location information to messages you send to other users or send a specific location message. If you choose to share your location with a specific user or group of users your location will be retrieved from your device and sent to Viber. Viber will only use this location for this particular purpose and delete it from its servers once the message is delivered. For the avoidance of doubt, Viber will not share your location information and will not use it for any purpose except the one specifically requested by you.Viber uses Google Analytics to help us anonymously track and report user/visitor behavior information and users’ standard log information to the Site and the Viber App. This information (including but not limited to: IP address, data storage, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and information processing) helps us analyze and evaluate how the Viber App and Site are used as part of our ongoing efforts to improve the Site and Viber App’s features and services. No personally identifying data is included in this type of reporting. Google Analytics may have access to your information only for the purposes of performing these tasks and on behalf of Viber and under obligation similar in those in this Privacy Policy. For more information about the terms that govern Google Analytics, please visit the Google Analytics terms of service.\n\nConceptual Development and Implementation:\n\nViber Media is a Las Vegas and Cyprus-registered company with its development centers in Belarus and Israel. The company was founded by Talmon Marco and Igor Megzinik, who are friends from the Israel Defense Forces. The company is run from Israel, with much of its development outsourced to Belarus in order to lower labour-costs.\n\nFounded in 2010, the company is co-owned by its four Israeli founders: Talman Marco, Igor Megzinik, Sani Maroli and Ofer Smocha, who have each increased their investment by over 30 times on the startup’s $900 million sale to Rakuten.\n\nMarco and Megzinik are also co-founders of the P2P media and file-sharing client iMesh.\n\nThe company originally didn’t generate revenues, but announced it would start generating revenues in 2013 via a “sticker store”. The company is funded by individual investors, who Marco has described as “friends and family”. As of May 2013, $20M had been invested in the company.\n\nQuality Attributes:\n\nSending your messages online means trusting the application you send them through and it’s important you know exactly what kind of security measures are taken to keep your information private. With Viber, your messages are secure.these widely used apps are considerably slow. sad to c still whatsapp is struggling to get the confidence of WP users as compared to androide and IOS.\n\nThese both the apps takes long time to launch and to refresh themselves in real-time. Hoping to see improvements at least at this time where WP has moved up to 8.1.\n\nPossible Problems:\n\nDesign Specification:\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viber\n\nhttp://www.viber.com/privacypolicy_m.html\n\nhttp://forums.wpcentral.com/\n\n7.Amazon\n\nTechnical Background:\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. // is an American international electronic commerce company with headquarters in Seattle,Washington, United States. It is the world’s largest online retailer. Amazon.com started as an online bookstore, but soon diversified, selling DVDs, VHSs, CDs, video and MP3 downloads/streaming, software, video games, electronics, apparel, furniture, food, toys, and jewelry. The company also produces consumer electronics—notably, Amazon Kindle e-book readers, Kindle Fire tablets, Fire TV and Fire Phone — and is a major provider of cloud computing services.\n\nJeff Bezos incorporated the company (as Cadabra) on July 5, 1994 and the site went online as Amazon.com in 1995.Bezos changed the name cadabra.com to amazon.com because it sounded too much like cadaver. Additionally, a name beginning with “A” was preferential due to the probability it would occur at the top of any list that was alphabetized.\n\nAmazon has separate retail websites for United States, United Kingdom, France, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, Australia, Brazil, Japan, China, India and Mexico, with sites for Sri Lanka and South East Asian countries coming soon. Amazon also offers international shipping to certain other countries for some of its products. In 2011, it had professed an intention to launch its websites in Poland,Netherlands, and Sweden, as well. An Austrian website operates as part of the German website.\n\nCompany Profile:\n\nThe company was founded in 1994, spurred by what Bezos called his “regret minimization framework”, which described his efforts to fend off any regrets for not participating sooner in the Internet business boom during that time. In 1994, Bezos left his employment as vice-president of D. E. Shaw & Co., a Wall Street firm, and moved to Seattle. He began to work on a business plan for what would eventually become Amazon.com.\n\nAfter reading a report about the future of the Internet which projected annual Web commerce growth at 2,300%, Bezos created a list of 20 products which could be marketed online. He narrowed the list to what he felt were the five most promising products which included: compact discs, computer hardware, computer software, videos, and books. Bezos finally decided that his new business would sell books online, due to the large world-wide demand for literature, the low price points for books, along with the huge number of titles available in print. Amazon was originally founded in Bezos’ garage in Bellevue, Washington.\n\nThe company began as an online bookstore, an idea spurred off with discussion with John Ingram of Ingram Book (now called Ingram Content Group), along with Keyur Patel who still holds a stake in Amazon. In the first two months of business, Amazon sold to all 50 states and over 45 countries. Within two months, Amazon’s sales were up to $20,000/week. While the largest brick and mortar bookstores and mail order catalogs might offer 200,000 titles, an online bookstore could “carry” several times more, since they had an almost unlimited virtual (not actual) warehouse: those of the actual product makers/suppliers.\n\nBezos wanted a name for his company that began with “A” so that it would appear early in alphabetic order. He began looking through the dictionary and settled on “Amazon” because it was a place that was “exotic and different” just as he planned for his store to be, a river he noted was by far the “biggest” river in the world (according to drainage, not length), and he planned to make his store the biggest in the world. Bezos placed a premium on his head start in building a brand, telling a reporter, “There’s nothing about our model that can’t be copied over time. But you know, McDonald’s got copied. And it still built a huge, multibillion-dollar company. A lot of it comes down to the brand name. Brand names are more important online than they are in the physical world.”\n\nSince 2000, Amazon’s logotype has featured a curved arrow leading from A to Z, representing that they carry every product from A to Z, with the arrow shaped like a smile.\n\nAmazon was incorporated in 1994, in the state of Washington. In July 1995, the company began service and sold its first book on Amazon.com: Douglas Hofstadter‘sFluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought. In October 1995, the company announced itself to the public. In 1996, it was reincorporated in Delaware. Amazon issued its initial public offering of stock on May 15, 1997, trading under the NASDAQ stock exchange symbol AMZN, at a price of US$18.00 per share ($1.50 after three stock splits in the late 1990s).\n\nSignificance and Purpose:\n\nAmazon is kind of like a regular shopping site, but has great deals on almost everything! For example, I found a phone case on another site that guaranteed “great deals”. It was $9.99. Instead, I found it on Amazon for only $2.30!\n\nConceptual Development and Implementation:\n\nFulfillment centers are located in the following cities, often near airports. These centers also provide warehousing and order-fulfillment for third-party sellers:\n\nWarehouses are large and each has hundreds of employees. Employees are responsible for four basic tasks: unpacking and inspecting incoming goods; placing goods in storage and recording their location; picking goods from their computer recorded locations to make up an individual shipment; and shipping. A central computer which records the location of goods and maps out routes for pickers plays a central role; employees carry hand-held computers which communicate with the central computer and monitor their rate of progress. A picker with their cart may walk 10 or more miles a day. In the United Kingdom initial staffing was provided by Randstad Holding and other temporary employment agencies. Some workers are accepted as Amazon employees and granted pension and shares of stock; others are dismissed. “When we have permanent positions available, we look to the top performing temporary associates to fill them.”Amazon Webstore allows businesses to create custom e-commerce websites using Amazon technology. Sellers pay a commission of 1-2%, plus credit-card processing fees and fraud protection, and a subscription fee which ranges from $0 to $39.99 per month depending on the bundle option for an unlimited number of listings.Amazon has chosen very few companies to become their implementation solution provider, and they are 4C Media, Absolute Webstores, atmosol, eCatalog, Explore Consulting, GoWebBaby, Kaushalam, KLoc Technologies, Luxor Design, SynapseIndia, and V Group. These companies encourage traders to have their own webstore with easy guidance and solutions. Development of a high level of automation is anticipated in the future following Amazon’s 2012 acquisition of Kiva Systems, a warehouse automation company.\n\nQuality Attributes:\n\nAlso in 2006, Amazon introduced Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), a virtual site farm, allowing users to use the Amazon infrastructure to run applications ranging from running simulations to web hosting. In 2008, Amazon improved the service by adding Elastic Block Store (EBS), offering persistent storage for Amazon EC2 instances and Elastic IP addresses, and offering static IP addresses designed for dynamic cloud computing. Amazon introduced SimpleDB, a database system, allowing users of its other infrastructure to utilize a high-reliability, high-performance database system. In 2008, Amazon graduated EC2 from beta to “Generally Available” and added support for the Microsoft Windows platform.\n\nAmazon continues to refine and add services to AWS, adding such services as Scalable DNS service (Amazon Route 53), payment handling, and AWS specific APIs for their Mechanical Turk service.\n\nIn August 2012, Amazon announced Amazon Glacier, a low-cost online file storage web service that provides reliable data archiving, storage, and backup.\n\nIn November 2012 at AWS’ web developer conference in Las Vegas it announced it was targeting large companies as cloud storage clients. It will further cut its S3 prices to customers with long-term contracts in its “Redshift” storage service launching in 2013.\n\nIn March 2013 Amazon announced its Mobile Ads API for developers. The new Ads API can be used on apps distributed on any Android platform as long as the app is also available on Amazon’s Appstore.\n\nCustomer Relationship Management (CRM) and Information Management (IM) support Amazon’s business strategy. The core technology that keeps Amazon running is Linux-based. As of 2005, Amazon had the world’s three largest Linux databases, with capacities of 7.8 TB, 18.5 TB, and 24.7 TB. The central data warehouse of Amazon is made of 28 Hewlett Packard servers with four CPUs per node running Oracle database software. Amazon’s technology architecture handles millions of back-end operations every day, as well as queries from more than half a million third-party sellers. With hundreds of thousands of people sending their credit card numbers to Amazon’s servers everyday, security becomes a major concern. Amazon employs Netscape Secure Commerce Server using the Secure Socket Layer protocol which stores all credit card details in a separate database. The company also records data on customer buyer behavior which enables them to offer or recommend to an individual specific item, or bundles of items based upon preferences demonstrated through purchases or items visited.\n\nOn January 31, 2013 Amazon experienced an outage that lasted approximately 49 minutes, leaving its site inaccessible to some customers.\n\nOn May 5, 2014 Amazon unveiled a partnership with Twitter. Twitter users can link their accounts to an Amazon account, and automatically add items to the shopping cart by responding to any tweet with an Amazon product link bearing the hashtag #AmazonCart. Customers never leave the Twitter feed, and the product is waiting for them when they head over to Amazon.\n\nPossible Problems:\n\nDesign Specification:\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon.com\n\nhttp://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_purpose_of_Amazon\n\n8. WeChat\n\nTechnical Background:\n\nWeChat (Chinese: 微信; pinyin: Wēixìn; literally: “micro message”) is a mobile text and voice messaging communication service developed by Tencent in China, first released in January 2011. It is the largest standalone messaging app by monthly active users.\n\nThe app is available on Android, iPhone, BlackBerry, Windows Phone and Symbian phones, and there are also Web-based and OS X clients but these require the user to have the app installed on a supported mobile phone for authentication.As of 2013, WeChat has 300 million users; with 70 million outside of China.\n\nWeChat provides text messaging, hold-to-talk voice messaging, broadcast (one-to-many) messaging, sharing of photographs and videos, and location sharing. It can exchange contacts with people nearby via Bluetooth, as well as providing various features for contacting people at random if desired (if these are open to it) and integration with social networking services such as those run by Facebook and Tencent QQ. Photographs may also be embellished with filtersand captions, and a machine translation service is available.\n\nRegistration is completed through Facebook Connect, email, mobile phone SMS/VM, or Tencent QQ.\n\nWeChat is being promoted in India via gaming site Ibibo, in which Tencent holds a stake.\n\nCompany Profile:\n\nWeChat began as a project at Tencent Guangzhou Research and Project center in October 2010. The original name of the app, “Weixin”, was invented by Xiaolong Zhang, and named by Ma Huateng, Tencent CEO.\n\nIn May 2011, WeChat had 4-5 million users, and by the end of 2011, it had 50 million users. WeChat had more than 100 million users by March 2012.\n\nIn April 2012, Weixin re-branded as WeChat for the international market.\n\nIn September 2012, WeChat had more than 200 million users according to Tencent CEO, Ma Huateng. As of January 2013, it had 300 million.\n\nIn April 2013, rumors online speculated that WeChat would charge a fee for the app. A poll showed that 90% of users strongly opposed this move. WeChat currently is free to download and use.\n\nIn May 2013, it was revealed that Rainie Yang would be a product endorser for WeChat. To promote the app in India, WeChat recruited Bollywood actors Varun Dhawan and Parineeti Chopra as brand ambassadors\n\nIn July 2013, Tencent announced WeChat has 70 million users outside China and Lionel Messi became the latest product ambassador of WeChat.\n\nIn July 2013, Tencent announced to test Games within WeChat.\n\nOn 5 July 2013, Tencent announced WeChat 5.0 for iOS. The new version came with many new features.\n\nOn 5 August 2013, WeChat 5.0 was launched with new features and functions including payment center, games center and sticker shop.\n\nIn June 2014, Wechat closed 20 million accounts because they offered prostitution services.\n\nAccording to GlobalWebIndex, WeChat is the fifth most used smartphone app worldwide and in August 2013 WeChat claimed it had 100 million registered international users which it is achieved in only 3 months from 50 million registered international users. It also claimed 300 million registered Chinese users.\n\nAccording to Xinhua, WeChat total users reached 600 millions users worldwide in October 2013. In addition,approximately 30 per cent of the total WeChat are users abroad.\n\nSignificance and Purpose:\n\nConceptual Development and Implementation:\n\nQuality Attributes:\n\nThe rise in the app’s popularity throughout the World has given politicians and dissidents concerns on the matter of security and privacy outside the realms of China. Voice messaging, a feature on WeChat, has caused users to fear that the service will allow the monitoring of users’ movements in real time by security officials.WeChat as well contains the ability to access the text messages, contact books of its users and users’ location through the GPS feature.Countries such as Taiwan, India, the United States, and China all fear that the app poses a threat to national security for various reasons.\n\nPossible Problems:\n\nWechat logging problem\n\nWeChat application on android has become the most downloaded app on the market. With over 10 million user this application has given a tough competition to other social apps like whatsapp, viber etc.\n\nWeChat features the crystal clear voice messages that has outcast the written chat. Moreover via this app the user is liable to send images and video and send instant chat messages to user and friend. WeChat is really becoming the user loving application.User from different countries are facing the logging problem in WeChat. After creating the proper account and getting it verfied by their cell phone number, the users are unable to acces their own account. Most of the time the users are getting this message (unable 4,-1).\n\nDesign Specification:\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeChat\n\nhttp://techwhatsapp.com/wechat-logging-problem/\n\n9. WATTPAD\n\nTechnical Background:\n\nWattpad is a writing community in which users are able to post articles, stories, and poems about anything either online or through the Wattpad app. The content includes work by undiscovered and published writers. Users are able to comment and like stories or join groups associated with the website. Around half of the users are U.S. based; most users also come from the U.K., Canada, the Philippines, Australia, United Arab Emirates and more.\n\nCompany Profile:\n\nWattpad originated in 2006, as the result of a collaboration between Allen Lau and Ivan Yuen.\n\nIn February 2007, Wattpad announced the addition of over 17,000 eBooks from Project Gutenberg making them available to mobile users. According to a June 2009 Wattpad press release, the mobile application had been downloaded over 5 million times. In March 2009, an iPhone version was released. This was followed by the launch on BlackBerry App World in April 2009, Google Android in June 2009 and Apple iPad in April 2010.\n\nSignificance and Purpose:\n\nConceptual Development and Implementation:\n\nQuality Attributes:\n\nAccount safety is a high priority for us here at Wattpad. Here are some things you can do to keep your account safe:\n\n1) Use a strong password and mix it up\n\n2) If it sounds suspicious, it likely is\n\n3) Only login through www.wattpad.com\n\nNote: Any emails you receive in regards to product giveaways are not affiliated with Wattpad. Be sure to immediately change your password if you have seen or interacted with these suspicious links.\n\nPossible Problems:\n\nDesign Specification:\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://support.wattpad.com/hc/en-us/articles/200774294-Account-Security\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wattpad\n\n10.Google Drive\n\nTechnical Background:\n\nGoogle Drive is a file storage and synchronization service provided by Google, released on April 24, 2012,which enables user cloud storage, file sharing and collaborative editing. Rumors about Google Drive began circulating as early as March 2006. Files shared publicly on Google Drive can be searched with web search engines. As of June 2014, Google Drive had 190 million monthly active users.\n\nGoogle Drive is the home of Google Docs, Sheets and Slides, an office suite of productivity applications, that offer collaborative editing on documents, spreadsheets, presentations, drawings, forms, and more.\n\nCompany Profile:\n\nGoogle // is an American multinational corporation specializing in Internet-related services and products. These include online advertising technologies, search, cloud computing, and softwar Most of its profits are derived from AdWords.\n\nGoogle was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University. Together they own about 14 percent of its shares but control 56 of the stockholder voting power through supervoting stock. They incorporated Google as a privately held company on September 4, 1998. An initial public offering followed on August 19, 2004. Its mission statement from the outset was “to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful,” and its unofficial slogan was “Don’t be evil.” In 2004, Google moved to headquarters in Mountain View, California, nicknamed the Googleplex.\n\nSignificance and Purpose:\n\nDocuments created through Google Docs can be saved to a user’s local computer in a variety of formats such as ODF, HTML, PDF, RTF, Text, and Microsoft Office. Documents are automatically saved to Google’s servers to prevent data loss, and a revision history is automatically kept so past edits may be viewed (although this only works for adjacent revisions, and there is currently no way to find and isolate changes in long documents). Documents can be tagged and archived for organizational purposes.\n\nGoogle Docs serves as a collaborative tool for editing documents in real time. Documents can be shared, opened, and edited by multiple users simultaneously and users are able to see character-by-character changes as other collaborators make edits. Users cannot be notified of changes, but the application can notify users when a comment or discussion is made or replied to, facilitating collaboration. There is no way to highlight changes made by a particular editor in real time during a writing session, nor a way to jump to the changes made. However, an editor’s current position is represented with an editor-specific color/cursor, so if another editor happens to be viewing that part of the document they can see edits as they occur. A sidebar chat functionality allows editors to discuss edits. Also, the revision history included in the service allows users to see the additions made to a document, with each author distinguished by color, but the entire document must be manually searched to find these changes. The revision history feature only displays one edit at a time, i.e. only adjacent revisions can be compared, and users cannot control how frequently revisions are saved. A new collaborative feature introduced in June 2014 allows any user with commenting access to make edit suggestions. However, this feature is currently available only for documents.\n\nConceptual Development and Implementation:\n\nQuality Attributes:\n\nGoogle provides optional free two-factor authentication for greater account security. To log in, users must provide a short random code sequence sent to their phones via SMS or generated by the Google Authenticator app for Android or iOS. Google has also switched to using secure sockets layer communication (HTTPS) by default, preventing common man-in-the-middle attacks. In addition, third party Google Drive plugins exist which enable at rest encryption of data stored on drive, adding a further layer of security.\n\nPossible Problems:\n\nDesign Specification:\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Drive\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google\n\nIntroduction\n\nBy gadgets we mean devices that incorporate buttons, switches, levers and the like, but also other odd gadgetry of the game author’s devising. In the present chapter we shall explore some of the library classes that can be used in gadgets, and then go on to construct a couple of gadgets (or gadget-like puzzles) out of other elements. Electronic devicesare a complex mixture of several hundred materials. A mobile phone, for example, contains 500 to 1000 components. Many of these contain toxic heavy metals such as lead, mercury, cadmium and beryllium and hazardous chemicals, such as brominated flame retardants.A gadgetis a small tool such as a machine that has a particular function, but is often thought of as a novelty. Gadgetsare sometimes referred to as gizmos.I/O devices are used by a person (or other system) to communicate with a computer. For instance, a keyboard or a mouse may be an input devicefor a computer, while monitors and printers are considered output devices for a computer.\n\n1.Joystick\n\nTechnical Background:\n\nAjoystickis aninput deviceconsisting of a stick that pivots on a base and reports its angle or direction to the device it is controlling. A joystick, also known as thecontrol column, is the principal control device in thecockpitof many civilian and military aircraft, either as acenter stickorside-stick. It often has supplementary switches to control various aspects of the aircraft’s flight.\n\nJoysticks are often used to control video games, and usually have one or more push-buttons whose state can also be read by the computer. A popular variation of the joystick used on modernvideo game consolesis theanalog stick. Joysticks are also used for controlling machines such as cranes, trucks, underwater unmanned vehicles, wheelchairs, surveillance cameras, and zero turning radius lawn mowers. Miniature finger-operated joysticks have been adopted as input devices for smaller electronic equipment such asmobile phones.\n\nCompany Profile:\n\nThe electrical two-axis joystick was invented by C. B. Mirick at theUnited States Naval Research Laboratory(NRL) and patented in 1926 (U.S. Patent no. 1,597,416)”.NRL was actively developing remote controlled aircraft at the time and the joystick was possibly used to support this effort. In the awarded patent, Mirick writes: “My control system is particularly applicable in maneuvering aircraft without a pilot.”\n\nThe Germans developed an electrical two-axis joystick around 1944 . The device was used as part of the Germans’FunkgerätFuG 203Kehlradio control transmitter system used in certain German bomber aircraft, used to guide both the rocket-boosted anti-ship missileHenschel Hs 293, and the unpowered pioneering precision-guided munitionFritz-X,against maritime and other targets. Here, the joystick of theKehltransmitter was used by an operator to steer the missile towards its target. This joystick had on-off switches rather than analogue sensors. Both the Hs 293 and Fritz-X used FuG 230Straßburgradio receivers in them to send theKehl’scontrol signals to the ordnance’s control surfaces. A comparable joystick unit was used for the contemporary AmericanAzonsteerable munition, strictly to laterally steer the munition in the yaw axis only.\n\nSignificance and Purpose:\n\nOne (of many) reasons why there were no new Wing Commander games in the early part of the current decade has to do with the decline of the joystick as a PC peripheral. UK MSN’s Teh & Gadgets column recently addressed the issue in anarticleby Patrick Gross. Games like Freelancer were sold on their ability to play without the input device. That’s a big change from a dozen years earlier when Wing Commander’s on-screen joystick hand was a hyped up feature. Some of the coolest, most elaborate and most advanced sticks are still around today, but they are nowhere near as ubiquitous and available as they once were.\n\nJoystick: Joystick is the hardware device which is used for providing the input to central processing unit. This device is most famous for gaming application.\n\nConceptual Development and Implementation:\n\nTHIS INVENTION relates to improvements to joystick assemblies and in particular to joystick assemblies for use with computers, video games or other similar apparatus. Background Art\n\nJoysticks for use with computers, video games or the like normally are in two forms to suit the type of computer with which the joystick is associated. In one form the joystick includes a plurality of switches which may be depressed upon pivotal movement of a control arm in a swivelling type manner. Such joysticks provide through the switches an on/off control mechanism for controlling the computer or video game. A second form of joystick employs a similar type of control arm. however, in this instance the joystick includes a variable resistor normally in the form of a straight line potentiometer which is operated through a lever mechanism to provide a variable output resistance upon pivotal movement of the control shaft. Alternatively other forms of variable resistors or potentiometers are mechanically controlled by movement of the control shaft to provide a varying output resistance. A disadvantage of the latter types of joystick is that considerable wear occurs because of the mechanical contact between the sliding terminal of the potentiometer and the potentiometer resistance member so that breakages often occur resulting in machine down time. This is undesirable both in household situations and in situations where the joystick is used in a video machine for the purposes of earning income.\n\nU.S. Patent No. 4748323 in the name of Holiday discloses a joystick device of the first type wherein a light emitter and light detector are employed and a blocking member is moved by the joystick control arm to a position to either block the light between the emitter and detector or allow the passage of light. This device is only suited to providing an on/off type output and not a variable output and accordingly its application is limited. Summary of the Invention\n\nThe present invention aims to overcome or alleviate the above disadvantages by providing a joystick assembly which may provide a variable output upon actuation but which substantially eliminates or reduces the wear associated with conventional joystick assemblies and which therefore enables an increased working life for such joysticks assemblies. Other objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description. With the above and other objects in view the present invention provides a joystick assembly including a moveable control arm, light emitting means, light sensing means for receiving light from said light emitting means and providing an output dependant upon the amount of light received from said light emitting means, and shutter means disposed adjacent said light emitting means and said light sensing means, said shutter means being coupled to said control arm and being moveable across the path of light between said l ght emitting means and said light sensing means upon movement of said control arm whereby to vary the amount of light received by said sensing means and thereby the output thereof.\n\nPreferably said shutter means comprises a shutter member having a tapered shutter portion. Suitably said tapered shutter portion comprises a tapered slot. Preferably said shutter member includes a planar tongue-like member and said tapered slot is formed in said tongue like member.\n\nSuitably said light emitting means comprises a light emitting diode and said light sensing means comprises a light dependent resistor. The joystick assembly also most preferably includes a substantially closed housing in which said shutter means are located and said control arm is supported on said housing for pivotal movement, preferably universal pivotal movement. The joystick assembly also- most preferably includes further shutter means within said housing coupled to said control arm so as to be movable thereby, and further light emitting means and light sensing means associated with said further shutter means, said further shutter means varying the amount of light received by said further light sensing means when moved by said control arm.\n\nQuality Attributes:\n\noth routines are very similar. Each checks for up, down, left, and right. Accounting for diagonal directions would require longer and more complex programming. The keyboard version will look for the depressing of four keys, which I have defined as I (up), M (down), J (left), and K (right).\n\nI designed the routines for controlling the movement of an object on the screen, and I suggest the following format:\n\n10 POKE A, B : SYS 7168 : POKE A, 32 : A = A + PEEK(1)-PEEK(2) : GOTO 10\n\nIn the above line, A is the memory location of a character’s position on the screen, and B is the character code of the desired character. First the character is POKEd onto the screen, and then the subroutine is called with SYS 7168. The subroutine checks for any movement of the joystick (or for keys being pressed). If it detects the joystick being pushed in any direction, it places an appropriate numerical value into location 1 or 2. These values will be used to update the position of the character being moved. First, the old character must be erased. This is accomplished by the command POKE A, 32. The character is erased by POKEing a space onto the same screen position (A). After it has been erased, its position can be updated by adding the contents of memory location 1 and subtracting the contents of memory location 2. Do this as shown above, with the command A = A + PEEK(1)-PEEK(2).\n\nIf the routine does not detect the joystick or keyboard being depressed, the values in these two memory locations will be set to zero, and the variable A (character’s position) will remain the same.\n\nPossible Problems:\n\nThe Penny & Giles / Traxsys Joystick moves on its own in one direction\n\nI think that this is a calibration issue caused by someone leaning on the joystick when it is plugged in or when the computer is turned on – but it seems rather random.\n\nTo fix this problem simply unplug the device from the back of the computer, wait about three seconds, and then plug it back in again. Make sure that nobody’s trying to use the joystick while you are doing this.\n\nThe computer feezes and the mouse pointer won’t move\n\nThis is to do with Windows XP trying to save some power by turning off the USB port.\n\nTo fix this problem try following these steps:\n\nOpen your Start Menu and choose the Run… command (If you have no Run option then you’ll have to speak to your school’s techie).\n\nIn the box that appears type “devmgmt.msc” without the quotes.\n\nIn the window that appears, click on the little [+] sign next to “Universal Serial Bus Controllers”.\n\nRight-click on the USB Root Hub entry and select Properties from the list that appears.\n\nChoose the Power Management tab and uncheck the box next the “Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power” label.\n\nIf you have more than one entry for USB Root Hub then repeat for each one.\n\nDesign Specifications:\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joystick\n\nhttp://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue29/403_1_VIC_Joystick_And_Keyboard_Routine.php\n\nhttp://www.bltt.org/quicktips/fao_joystickprobs.html\n\n2. Dynamic random-access memory(DRAM)\n\nTechnical Background:\n\nis a type ofrandom-access memorythat stores eachbitof data in a separatecapacitorwithin anintegrated circuit. The capacitor can be either charged or discharged; these two states are taken to represent the two values of a bit, conventionally called 0 and 1. Since even “nonconducting” transistors always leak a small amount, the capacitors will slowly discharge, and the information eventually fades unless the capacitor charge isrefreshedperiodically. Because of this refresh requirement, it is adynamicmemory as opposed toSRAMand otherstaticmemory.\n\nThe main memory (the “RAM”) in personal computers is dynamic RAM (DRAM). It is the RAM indesktops,laptopsandworkstationcomputers as well as some of the RAM ofvideo gameconsoles.\n\nDRAM is a type ofRAMthat stores each bit of data on a separate capacitor. This is an efficient way to store data in memory, because it requires less physical space to store the same amount of data than if it was stored statically. Therefore, a DRAM chip can hold more data than anSRAM(static RAM) chip of the same size can. However, the capacitors in DRAM need to constantly be refreshed to keep their charge, so DRAM requires more power than SRAM.\n\nCompany Profile:\n\nThecryptanalyticmachine code-named“Aquarius”used atBletchley ParkduringWorld War IIincorporated a hard-wired dynamic memory. Paper tape was read and the characters on it “were remembered in a dynamic store. … The store used a large bank of capacitors, which were either charged or not, a charged capacitor representing cross (1) and an uncharged capacitor dot (0). Since the charge gradually leaked away, a periodic pulse was applied to top up those still charged (hence the term ‘dynamic’)”.\n\nIn 1964 Arnold Farber and Eugene Schlig, working for IBM, created a hard-wired memory cell, using a transistor gate and tunnel diode latch. They replaced the latch with two transistors and two resistors, a configuration that became known as the Farber-Schlig cell. In 1965 Benjamin Agusta and his team at IBM created a 16-bit silicon memory chip based on the Farber-Schlig cell, with 80 transistors, 64 resistors, and four diodes. In 1966 DRAM was invented by Dr.Robert Dennardat theIBMThomas J. Watson Research Center. He was granted U.S. patent number3,387,286in 1968. Capacitors had been used for earlier memory schemes such as the drum of theAtanasoff–Berry Computer, theWilliams tubeand theSelectron tube.\n\nThe Toshiba“Toscal” BC-1411electronic calculator, which was introduced in November 1966,used a form of dynamic RAM built from discrete components.\n\nIn 1969HoneywellaskedIntelto make a DRAM using a 3-transistorcell that they had developed. This became the Intel 1102 (512×1) in early 1970. However, the 1102 had many problems, prompting Intel to begin work on their own improved design, in secrecy to avoid conflict with Honeywell. This became the first commercially available DRAM memory, theIntel 1103(1024×1), in October 1970, despite initial problems with low yield until the fifth revision of themasks. The 1103 was designed by Joel Karp and laid out by Pat Earhart. The masks were cut by Barbara Maness and Judy Garcia.\n\nThe first DRAM with multiplexed row and columnaddress lineswas theMostekMK4096 (4096×1) designed byRobert Proebstingand introduced in 1973. This addressing scheme uses the same address pins to receive the low half and the high half of the address of the memory cell being referenced, switching between the two halves on alternating bus cycles. This was a radical advance, effectively halving the number of address lines required, which enabled it to fit into packages with fewer pins, a cost advantage that grew with every jump in memory size. The MK4096 proved to be a very robust design for customer applications. At the 16K density, the cost advantage increased; the Mostek MK4116 16K DRAM, introduced in 1976, achieved greater than 75% worldwide DRAM market share. However, as density increased to 64K in the early 80s, Mostek was overtaken by Japanese DRAM manufacturers selling higher quality DRAMs using the same multiplexing scheme at below-cost prices\n\nSignificance and Purpose:\n\nTypically, manufacturers specify that each row must have its storage cell capacitors refreshed every 64 ms or less, as defined by the JEDEC(Foundation for developing Semiconductor Standards) standard.Refresh logicis provided in a DRAM controller which automates the periodic refresh, stated differently, no software or other hardware has to perform it. This makes the controller’s logic circuit more complicated, but this drawback is outweighed by the fact that DRAM is much cheaper per storage cell and because each storage cell is very simple, DRAM has much greater capacity per unit of surface than SRAM.\n\nSome systems refresh every row in a burst of activity involving all rows every 64 ms. other systems refresh one row at a time staggered throughout the 64 ms interval. For example, a system with 213 = 8192 rows would require a staggeredrefresh rateof one row every 7.8 µs which is 64 ms divided by 8192 rows. A few real-time systems refresh a portion of memory at a time determined by an external timer function that governs the operation of the rest of a system, such as thevertical blanking intervalthat occurs every 10–20 ms in video equipment. All methods require some sort of counter to keep track of which row is the next to be refreshed. Most DRAM chips include that counter. Older types require external refresh logic to hold the counter.\n\nConceptual Development and Implementation:\n\nDRAM is usually arranged in a rectangular array of charge storage cells consisting of one capacitor and transistor per data bit. The figure to the right shows a simple example with a 4 by 4 cell matrix. Modern DRAM matrices are many thousands of cells in height and width.\n\nThe long horizontal lines connecting each row are known as word-lines. Each column of cells is composed of two bit-lines, each connected to every other storage cell in the column (the illustration to the right does not include this important detail). They are generally known as the + and − bit-lines.\n\nOperations to read a data bit from a DRAM storage cell[edit]\n\nThe sense amplifiers are disconnected.\n\nThe bit-lines are precharged to exactly equal voltages that are in between high and low logic levels (e.g., 0.5 V if the two levels are 0 and 1 V). The bit-lines are physically symmetrical to keep the capacitance equal, and therefore at this time their voltages are equal.\n\nThe precharge circuit is switched off. Because the bit-lines are relatively long, they have enoughcapacitanceto maintain the precharged voltage for a brief time. This is an example ofdynamic logic.\n\nThe desired row’s word-line is then driven high to connect a cell’s storage capacitor to its bit-line. This causes the transistor to conduct, transferringchargefrom the storage cell to the connected bit-line (if the stored value is 1) or from the connected bit-line to the storage cell (if the stored value is 0). Since the capacitance of the bit-line is typically much higher than the capacitance of the storage cell, the voltage on the bit-line increases very slightly if the storage cell’s capacitor is discharged and decreases very slightly if the storage cell is charged (e.g., 0.54 V and 0.45 V in the two cases). As the other bit-line holds 0.50 V there is a small voltage difference between the two twisted bit-lines.\n\nThe sense amplifiers are now connected to the bit-lines pairs. Positive feedback then occurs from the cross-connected inverters, thereby amplifying the small voltage difference between the odd and even row bit-lines of a particular column until one bit line is fully at the lowest voltage and the other is at the maximum high voltage. Once this has happened, the row is “open” (the desired cell data is available).\n\nAll storage cells in the open row are sensed simultaneously, and the sense amplifier outputs latched. A column address then selects which latch bit to connect to the external data bus. Reads of different columns in the same row can be performed without a row opening delay because, for the open row, all data has already been sensed and latched.\n\nWhile reading of columns in an open row is occurring, current is flowing back up the bit-lines from the output of the sense amplifiers and recharging the storage cells. This reinforces (i.e. “refreshes”) the charge in the storage cell by increasing the voltage in the storage capacitor if it was charged to begin with, or by keeping it discharged if it was empty. Note that due to the length of the bit-lines there is a fairly long propagation delay for the charge to be transferred back to the cell’s capacitor. This takes significant time past the end of sense amplification, and thus overlaps with one or more column reads.\n\nWhen done with reading all the columns in the current open row, the word-line is switched off to disconnect the storage cell capacitors (the row is “closed”) from the bit-lines. The sense amplifier is switched off, and the bit-lines are precharged again.\n\nQuality Attributes:\n\nThe advantage of DRAM is its structural simplicity: only onetransistorand a capacitor are required per bit, compared to four or six transistors in SRAM. This allows DRAM to reach very highdensities. Unlikeflash memory, DRAM isvolatile memory(vs.non-volatile memory), since it loses its data quickly when power is removed. The transistors and capacitors used are extremely small; billions can fit on a single memory chip.\n\nPossible Problems:\n\nElectrical or magnetic interference inside a computer system can cause a single bit of DRAM to spontaneously flip to the opposite state. The majority of one-off (“soft“) errors in DRAM chips occur as a result ofbackground radiation, chieflyneutronsfromcosmic raysecondaries, which may change the contents of one or more memory cells or interfere with the circuitry used to read/write them. Recent studies give widely varying error rates forsingle event upsetswith over 7 orders of magnitude difference, ranging from roughly one bit error, per hour, per gigabyte of memory to one bit error, per century, per gigabyte of memory.[9][10][11]\n\nThis problem can be mitigated by usingredundantmemory bits and memory controllers that exploit these bits, usually implemented within DRAM modules. These extra bits are used to recordparityand to enable missing data to be reconstructed byerror-correcting code(ECC). Parity allows the detection of all single-bit errors (actually, any odd number of wrong bits). The most common error-correcting code, aSECDED Hamming code, allows a single-bit error to be corrected and, in the usual configuration, with an extra parity bit, double-bit errors to be detected.\n\nAn ECC-capable memory controller as used in many modern PCs can typically detect and correct errors of a single bit per 64-bit “word” (the unit ofbustransfer), and detect (but not correct) errors of two bits per 64-bit word. Some systems also ‘scrub‘ the errors, by writing the corrected version back to memory. TheBIOSin some computers, and operating systems such asLinux, allow counting of detected and corrected memory errors; this allows identification and replacement of failing memory modules.\n\nRecent studies give widely varying error rates with over 7 orders of magnitude difference, ranging from10−10−10−17error/bit·h, roughly one bit error, per hour, per gigabyte of memory to one bit error, per century, per gigabyte of memory.The Schroeder et al. 2009 study reported a 32% chance that a given computer in their study would suffer from at least one correctable error per year, and provided evidence that most such errors are intermittent hard rather than soft errors. A 2010 study at the University of Rochester also gave evidence that a substantial fraction of memory errors are intermittent hard errors. Large scale studies on non-ECC RAM in PCs and laptops suggest that undetected memory errors account for a substantial number of system failures: the study reported a 1 in 1700 chance per 1.5% of memory tested (extrapolating to an approximately 26% chance for total memory) that a computer would have a memory error per 8 months.\n\nDesign Specification:\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_random-access_memory\n\nhttp://www.techterms.com/definition/dram\n\n3.
