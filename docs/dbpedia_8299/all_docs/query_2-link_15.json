First appeared 1995 Stable release 2.3.1 / April 26, 2016; 8 years ago ( ) Typing discipline duck, dynamic Scope lexical, sometimes dynamic OS Cross-platform License Ruby License or BSD License Filename extensions .rb, .rbw Major implementations Ruby MRI, YARV, Rubinius, MagLev, JRuby, MacRuby, RubyMotion, HotRuby, IronRuby, mruby Influenced by Ada, C++, CLU, Dylan, Eiffel, Lisp, Perl, Python, Smalltalk Influenced D, Elixir, Falcon, Fancy, Groovy, Ioke, Mirah, Nu, Reia\n\nRuby is a language in text used to tell machines what to do - a programming language. Ruby was created in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro \"Matz\" Matsumoto in Japan.\n\nIt looks like the English language, like the language you are reading now. It has more qualities:\n\nTerse. Short, but still easy to understand.\n\nDynamic. Easy to change, any time and any where.\n\nDuck typing. If you think you understand it, you probably understand it.\n\nMany programmers like it because the creator tried to make it easy and nice to use.\n\nExample\n\nAn example Hello World program in Ruby:\n\nputs \"Hello World!\"\n\nImages for kids\n\nYukihiro Matsumoto, the creator of Ruby\n\nSee also"
