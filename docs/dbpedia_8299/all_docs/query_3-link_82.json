Programmers often feel joy when they can concentrate on the creative side of programming, so Ruby is designed to make programmers happy. - Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto\n\n8 Actually, I'm trying to make Ruby natural, not simple. - Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto\n\n9\n\n10 If Python was the result of Lisp and C++ having a baby, Ruby is the result of Perl and Smalltalk having a baby. --MeowMeow Jones, 11/8/2001 on slashdot.\n\n11\n\n12 If it looks like a duck and acts like a duck it might as well be a duck\n\n13\n\n14 The computer should be doing the hard work. That's what it's paid to do, after all. -- Larry Wall\n\n15 I don’t think the idea here is to save memory or speed. The idea behind metaprogramming is to teach Ruby your conventions and let it do some guessing, in order to save you some code. – Why, author of why’s poignant guide to Ruby\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19 I invented the term Object-Oriented, and I can tell you I did not have C++ in mind. -- Alan Kay\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23 Isn't this dangerous? What if someone changes the logic of + for math expressions? No, because if one of your programmers overrides methods that break things – you take them out in the parking lot and beat them with a rubber hose!
