Everything you'll find on this page is designed to output code for use on the web or with JavaScript-enabled servers and devices. This site is a handy guide to what's new in the altJS universe, as well as a place to connect.\n\nMissing the conversation? Create a new Github issue at https://github.com/smurfpandey/altjs/issues/new\n\nTop-Ranking Languages on GitHub\n\n(JavaScript #1, ActionScript #18)\n\nCoffeeScript #10, HaXe #46, Objective-J #50\n\nNew Languages Based on JavaScript\n\nThese languages employ a combination of syntactic sugar and replacement syntax. They're new in the sense that they aren't ports, but don't necessarily reflect JavaScript's look-and-feel or default behavior. Some are backward-compatible supersets of JavaScript, others are not.\n\nCoffeeScript JavaScript alternative inspired by Ruby, Python and others.\n\nCoco A CoffeeScript variant with cutting-edge experimental features.\n\nContracts.coffee CoffeeScript dialect with runtime contracts.\n\nJack A language that emphasizes simplicity, fun and productivity.\n\nJS11 A code expander that inserts omitted elements and debugs line-for-line.\n\nSibilant An expandable JavaScript-like language inspired by Lisp.\n\nKaffeine Progressive enhancement of JavaScript, aimed at professionals.\n\nMove A simplified language intended for new programmers.\n\nParsec CoffeeScript An extensible fork of the CoffeeScript project.\n\nZedscript Pseudocode-ish syntax alternative to the ECMAScript syntax.\n\nLiveScript Coco but much more compatible with CoffeeScript, more functional, and more feature rich.\n\nJavaScript Enhancements\n\nSecurity Enforcement\n\nADsafe Client-side static verifier and API, making third party scripts safe.\n\nCaja Compiles ES5/strict to ES3 and supports object-capabilities.\n\nDojo Secure Framework for building secure mashups.\n\nFBJS Facebook JavaScript, used for scripting Facebook gadgets.\n\nJacaranda Static verifier supporting object-capabilities.\n\nGatekeeper Microsoft Research project.\n\nMicrosoft Web Sandbox Technology preview, security through isolation.\n\nuses Web Workers to sandbox applications and a RESTful messaging protocol called HTTPL (HTTP Local) to communicate between them\n\nStatic Typing\n\nSome of the others listed are statically typed, such as mobl, GWT, NS Basic, and Haxe.\n\nSafeJS Typed JS with optional syntactic sugar.\n\nScript# [commercial] Compiles C# to JS.\n\nMileScript [commercial] A strongly-typed language similar to C# and Java, but which compiles to JS. free for non-profit, educational use.\n\nMascara [commercial] Enhances JavaScript with powerful features like classes, namespaces and type-checking.\n\nRoy Functional language with type inference, structural typing, sum types, pattern matching - tries to stay close to JavaScript semantics\n\nPrefix C# like language with readable output.\n\nElm type-safe functional language that compiles to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript\n\nPit F# to Javascript compiler\n\nJSX a faster, safer, easier alternative to JavaScript\n\nPurescript small strongly typed programming language that compiles to JavaScript\n\nSynchronous to Asynchronous (CPS)\n\nStreamline.js Uses underscore (_) to stand for callbacks. This fork preserves line numbers for debugging.\n\nTameJS From OkCupid, a cleaner way to write async JavaScript.\n\nmobl Screen-driven language and toolset for building mobile web apps.\n\nStratifiedJS JavaScript plus structured concurrency.\n\nNarrativeJS JavaScript extension with asynchronous futures and promises.\n\njwacs JavaScript With Advanced Continuation Support.\n\nJscex Write simple JavaScript code, execute it asynchronously by compiling to monadic form. Works in any ECMAScript 3 engines directly.\n\nLanguage Extensions\n\nContextJS is an implementation of Context-oriented Programming for JavaScript.\n\nCycript An Objective-C / JavaScript bridge that can also be used to compile and compress standard or hybrid JavaScript syntax.\n\nObjective-J Shares with JavaScript the same relationship that Objective-C has with the C programming language: that of being a strict, but small, superset.\n\nJS2 Object-oriented JavaScript with syntactic sugar (curry, foreach, property). Released as a Ruby gem.\n\nJangaroo AS3 (ActionScript) to JavaScript.\n\nFlapjax Event-driven, reactive evaluation.\n\nRestrict Mode Tightens up the behavior of several JavaScript operators, including ==.\n\nJavaScript++ Superset of JS that includes features such as classes, block scoping and a pluggable type system.\n\nNext-Generation JavaScript\n\nThese are implementations intended to test next-generation proposals for the ECMAScript standard. They represent semi-official efforts to improve the JavaScript platform.\n\nNarcissus Mozilla's experimental JavaScript engine by Brendan Eich and others.\n\nJasy: Python port of Narcissus with some enhancements\n\nTraceur Google's testbed platform for next-generation syntax ideas.\n\nRuby Ports\n\nHotRuby Runs opcode, compiled by YARV on Ruby inside a web browser or in Flash.\n\nrb2js Converts Ruby to JavaScript.\n\nRed Writes like Ruby and runs like JavaScript.\n\nQuby Used for game coding site, not open source (requires HTML5).\n\nPython Ports\n\nPYXC-PJ Python to JS.
