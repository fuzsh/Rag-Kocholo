HotRuby is a JavaScript and Flash powered virtual machine that can run Ruby code compiled to opcode by YARV.

You can write Ruby script within a Web page within <script type="text/ruby"> .. </script> tags, and HotRuby will then extract it, send it to be compiled by a remote script, and then return it for the JavaScript and Flash powered virtual machine to display within the page. There are lots of demos, including a physics Flash application (as seen in the screenshot above), a very curious pinball game, and a benchmarking script (which shows HotRuby as being 78% faster than Ruby 1.9 on my machine?)
