        "text": "One of the earliest genres of music, the Qawwali, has survived for over 7 centuries and continues to flourish to this day. Intertwined in spiritual mysticism, it is a fascinating and thought provoking brand of music with a realm that is diametrically opposite to many of the more technologically driven sounds making waves in recent times.\n\nSufi music and the qawwali:\n\nThe Chisti school of thought gave way to the birth of qawwali music as we know it today. Qawwali music began as the face of Sufi philosophies. It was meant to be a deeply spiritual process towards attainment of sublimation of the soul in prayer. The development of modern qawwali music is greatly indebted to Amir Khusrau, who made it a multi-cultural phenomenon. Through the ages, qawwali has grown along lines parallel to those of Hindustani Classical music. Hence, the structure of songs and the mannerisms in which we find it sung today closely resemble those of Hindustani sangeet. The messages however, remain distinct and qawwalis retain their original Sufi flavor.\n\nQawwali: What and how\n\nThe qawwali may be like any other piece of music in terms of classical structure, but the vast range of sentiments covered makes it an introspective fool’s delight. The qawwali generally begins with a couplet or verse in praise of ‘Ali’ or ‘Maula’, moving on to the central theme of the song. Topics range from love and intoxication to deep spiritual elevation and enlightenment. The qawwali gathers speed and builds a platform for delivering its message as the verses repeat themselves; in parallel run the guile of the vocalist and his involvement in the entire process. Generally, qawwalis culminate in a trance like crescendo of rapturous song and energetic accompaniment.\n\nQawwali troupes consist of eight to ten artists, many of them vocalists. The tabla, harmonium and perfectly timed claps of hand provide accompaniment to the troupe. The flavor of the qawwali is seen in the many attempts within the troupe at musical one-upmanship while staying true to the essence of the qawwali, providing an ever changing mosaic to the listener.\n\nUrdu is the primary language in which most qawwalis have been written; much can be accredited to its patronage in Mughal royal courts and performances in Darghas alike. While artists have added folk flavor to qawwalis with hints of Punjabi and Sindhi, it is the Urdu in a qawwali that makes it more satisfying than an ordinary Ghazal. So characteristic is mellowness of Urdu that the underlying emotions cannot be satisfactorily conveyed, captured or translated in any other language.\n\n[It is a good idea to sit with some kind of Hindi-English-Urdu dictionary when listening to Sufi music. Painful as the process may sound, it is worth every bit of effort when you unravel the deeper meaning nestled in the qawwali. ]\n\nThe Begum and the Ustad:\n\nA puritan will appreciate the voice and style of Begum Abida Parveen, whose Sufi ghazals are very popular. She is one of very few female qawwals to have made it big. Her typical affectations during a performance and the heavy timbre in her voice make the experience special.\n\nThrough the eighties and nineties, one man single handedly revolutionized the way the world looked towards Sufi music. Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, with his powerful, raspy voice captivated the world in a shower of brilliant qawwali renditions released in many albums spanning 20 years. Numerous international collaborations with high-profile artists put him on the global map earning him the sobriquet “Shehenshah-e-Qawwali”. Check these three links for a quick but reasonably enlightening take on NFAK’s life and career.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inWKTCcsczQ\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjNFxIGErP0&feature=related\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqFHFNhM1m8&feature=related\n\nNFAK’s legacy is carried forward by his student and nephew Rahat Fateh Ali Khan who has been reasonably successful as a playback singer for Bollywood songs.\n\n‘Qawwal bachcho.n ka gharana’ is the line of musicians tracing back to Amir Khusrau’s disciples. Fareed Ayaz is a descendant of this musical line and is well known internationally as one of the current flagbearers for qawwali music.\n\nBollywood and Pop-Rock qawwalis:\n\nClassics like Purdah hai Purdah (Amar Akbar Anthony) in the golden days of Hindi cinema closely resembled the original forms of qawwali but Bollywood, in recent years has a had very few memorable pseudo-qawwali songs; Shankar Ehsaan Loy played around with the original format developing the pop treat that was Kajra Re (Bunty aur Babli) and Rehman tried it with Arziyan (Delhi-6) and Khwaja (Jodha-Akbar).\n\nJunoon, one of Pakistan’s most popular bands burst onto the scene in the mid-nineties, following the success of their first album (also titled Junoon), pioneering the form of music that could only be classified as Sufi rock. Rabbi Shergil enjoyed the limelight with his Sufi crooning “Bulla ki jana main kaun” some years ago. While both these are not examples of qawwalis per se, they seem to have been heavily influenced by the thinkers who found their voice in qawaals over the years.\n\n[If you haven’t heard Junoon, you’re really missing something. Junoon, the 1991 album specifically is the pinnacle of Pakistani rock music. Newspaper reports have dubbed Junoon as “A Rock and Roll Jihad for the Soul of Pakistan”. Maybe you could hear the Junoon version of Dum-a-dum mast kalander and the Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan version of the same immediately after and then appreciate the shift in musical paradigm.\n\nQawwali music takes a little time getting used to. A good place to start would probably be an album called Sangam, co-produced by NFAK and Javed Akhtar. The songs will give you a feel of qawwali music and its many moods. Graduating ahead from this, there is a fabulous torrent (read illegal but scintillating) of around 160 select qawwalis recorded by NFAK and other artists that will allow you to explore the more serious ghazals, the arduous aalaps, the sheer mastery of these singers over the interjected sargams and mystic headbanging so synonymous with this brand of music if you can sink into the soul of the qawwali.]\n\nMust Hears:\n\n1. Mazaa aa gaya\n\n2. Likh diya apne dar pe kisi ne\n\n3. Allah Hoo\n\n4. Mast Aankhon. ki kasam\n\n5. Tum agar yuu.nhi nazre.n milate rahe\n\n6. Ali Maula\n\n7. Dum-a-dum mast kalandar\n\nWishlist: While Qawwali music has a very small fan following, the optimist in me hopes for some kind of collaborations betwwen qawwali artists of the day and an integrator like Rehman to generate mass interest in this niche of music.\n\nWe conclude this post with a part of NFAK’s famous qawwalis Mast Aankhon ki Kasam:\n\nआज तौबा को घटाओं के हवाले कर दूँ\n\nतौबा तो कर चुका था मगर फिर भी ऐय जलील\n\nकाली घटा को देख के नियत बदल गयी\n\nलुत्फ़ – ए -मै तुझ से क्या कहूँ जाहिद\n\nहाय कमबख्त तू ने पी ही नहीं\n\nए वएज़ा तू शराब पी ले\n\nन कर तू कुछ, इज्तानाब पी ले\n\nमैं तेरी मानून नमाज़ पढ़ लूँ\n\nतू मेरी मान अब शराब पी ले"
