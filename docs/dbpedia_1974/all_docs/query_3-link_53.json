        "text": "Monitoring Desk\n\nISLAMABAD: An American magazine Rolling Stone recently made a list of 200 Best Singers of all time in which Pakistani legendary singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan was also featured.\n\nRolling Stone published the final list of all the best singers on Sunday.\n\nPakistani Qawwali maestro Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan is an icon of Pakistani music industry.\n\nHe made her identity with his magical voice which won the hearts of many.\n\nNusrat Fateh Ali Khan is a versatile Pakistani singer whose family’s musical legacy stretched back hundreds of years.\n\nRolling Stone wrote for Nusrat: “Khan’s music easily reached global audiences in the eighties when he began performing abroad and recording for Peter Gabriel’s Real World label”.\n\nOn the other hand, Indian legendary singer Lata Mangeshkar whose melodious voice is being listened not only in India but in Pakistan too, was also in the list of Rolling Stone’s 200 best singers of all time.\n\nMagazine wrote for Lata: “The crystalline, eternally girlish voice of ‘the Melody Queen’ is a cornerstone of Indian pop music, with a global influence spread via Bollywood films, whose golden era she defined. Lata was the empress of playback singers, the vocal magicians who perform songs for actors to lip-sync in lavish movie musicals, recording over 7,000 such songs, by some estimates.”\n\nShe claimed the 84th spot on the list.\n\nWhereas, Bruce Springsteen, Elton John, Bob Marley, Usher, Chuck Berry, Stevie Nicks, Taylor Swift, Bono, Michael Jackson, Amy Winehouse, Joao Gilberto, Billie Eilish, Rosalia, Burna Boy among others were also on the list.\n\nThe 91st singers were also in the list such as, K-pop boy band BTS Jungkook, South Korean singer-songwriter IU, and Canadian singer The Weeknd."
