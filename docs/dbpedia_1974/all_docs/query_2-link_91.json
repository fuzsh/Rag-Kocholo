        "text": "Twenty years ago today, one of Pakistan's most influential singers died of a heart attack. Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan sang a form of Sufi devotional music known as Qawwali. He has collaborated with western musicians like Peter Gabriel and Canadian composer Michael Brook. Many people will tell you that he single-handedly brough Qawwali to international audiences.\n\nPakistani-Canadian musician Haniya Aslam grew up listening to Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Today, she will give us the ultimate gateway to the legendary singer.\n\nâ€” Produced by Aparita Bhandari"
