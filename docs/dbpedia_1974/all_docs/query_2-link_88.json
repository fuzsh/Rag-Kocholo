        "text": "Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan is popularly known as 'The King of Kings' of Qawwali. His impact has led to him being honoured in 2017 with a BBC Music Day Blue Plaque in Birmingham.\n\nAs a singer he gave sensational performances with an other-worldy voice and could perform for long periods of time maintaining intensity, and emotion. He's widely credited with introducing Qawwali music to international audiences, and has been dubbed the 'Elvis of the East'.\n\nNitin Sawhney paid tribute to his vocal hero in 'Guru of Peace: An Introduction to Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan' for BBC Radio 6 Music.\n\nTo commemorate his legendary status, and to mark 20 years since his death, we present 11 facts you may have missed from his long and storied career.\n\nIn 1964, when Nusrat was just 16 years old his father tragically died. Just 10 days after his passing, Nusrat had a dream in which his father appeared and instructed him to sing.\n\n\"I had a dream that my father took me to a place and asked me to sing with him\" Nusrat revealed in the documentary film 'Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, the Last Prophet'.\n\nThe 16 year old Nusrat gave his first performance at his father's funeral a few weeks later.\n\nNusrat’s stardom made him one of the brightest Pakistani musical stars of his era and he went on to enter the world’s biggest film industry; Bollywood. He composed music for three Bollywood films before his death, including the notable tracks 'Koi Jaane Koi Na Jaane' and 'Zindagi Jhoom Kar'.\n\nFor the movie 'Kachche Dhaage', he sang 'Iss Shaan-E-Karam Ka Kya Kehna'. The movie was released two years after his death in 1999. A moment of note in his film career was when singing sisters Asha Bhosle and Lata Mangeshkar gave their vocals to songs he composed for Hindi cinema.\n\nThe Oriental Star Agencies label is associated with some of the most prolific and memorable hits produced in the UK. The label is particularly responsible for exposing talent from abroad to UK audiences.\n\nIn the early 1980s Nusrat was signed by OSA in Birmingham and released several albums and music scores all around the world. The agency recorded some of the biggest stars of the time and introduced the likes of Bally Sagoo, Malkit Singh and Bhujhangy Group to the world.\n\nNusrat had a newphew: Rahat Fateh Ali khan. Rahat was selected by his uncle for training and educating in the grand tradition of Qawwali music. Once he'd begun formal training Rahat was part of his uncles performance by the age of nine.\n\nOnce he'd reached the age of fifteen Rahat was cemented as part of his uncles renowned Qawwali performance group, from there he began to venture into solo work and is now a prolific Qawwali artist in his own right."
