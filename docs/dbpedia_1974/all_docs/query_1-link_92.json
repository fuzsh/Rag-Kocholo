        "text": "According to Nida, Indians who are plagiarising Nusrat's work will be served with a legal notice\n\nShaherbano Naqvi June 01, 2018\n\nLAHORE: There is no doubt that Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan is one of the greatest musicians the world has seen. The qawwal has not only managed to make his mark in Pakistan but also reached global heights with his soulful music.\n\nNusrat Fateh Ali Khan: The void remains\n\nIn a press conference held at the Lahore Press Club, his daughter Nida Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan stated that she plans to take action against people who have used her father's song without asking for permission. \"After my father's death, I possess the rights to his music. I will be taking strict action against the people who are using them and will also be taking them to the court,\" said Nida.\n\nShe added that a local music firm by the name of Khokhar Productions has forged her signatures and falsely taken the rights of Nusrat's music. She has issued them with a legal notice and also asked them to pay a compensation.\n\nMany of the yesteryear singer's songs have been used in various Bollywood films which have been crooned by the maestro's nephew, Rahat Fateh Ali Khan. When asked if Nida was also taking action against Rahat with her allegations, she explained, \"I am not going against Rahat. He is a brother to me. Many people have spread rumours on social media that the two of us are married but we are not and he is happy with his married life. I am only taking action against the people who have misused by father's music and claim it as their own.\"\n\nShe continued, \"There are many other songs that my father aimed to introduce to the world but never got the chance to. I will be launching those songs now.\"\n\nAccording to Nida, Indians who are plagiarising Nusrat's work will also be held accountable and served with a legal notice.\n\nOn providing details of the notices sent to production houses in both Pakistan and India, Nida revealed she will be holding a separate conference in the near future to address all such concerns.\n\nNusrat Fateh Ali Khan was born on October 13, 1948.

Nida confirmed that she is the only daughter of Nusrat, even though many have come forth impersonating her.\n\nHave something to add to the story? Share in the comments below."
