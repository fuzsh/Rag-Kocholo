        "text": "This work addresses the politics of globalisation through an examination of neo-liberalism, the third way, and anti-capitalist responses and alternatives. It utilises a Marxist approach, not only to challenge the claims made by apologists for 'actually existing globalisation', but to explain, contextualise and problematise the rise of anti-globalisation politics. Central to the work is a critique of globalisation theory, neo-liberalism and the third way; an examination of the role of the state as an agent of globalisation, particularly the hegemonic US state; a theorisation of the nature of uneven development in the global order; and an examination of the political implications of these issues for progressive alternatives to neo-liberal globalisation.\n\nRay Kiely, Ph.D. (1991) in Sociology, University of Warwick, is Senior Lecturer in Development Studies, SOAS, University of London. He has published widely in the fields of globalisation and development, including Sociology and Development (UCL Press, 1995) and The Ends of Globalisation: US Hegemony and the Globalist Project (forthcoming, 2005).\n\nThe Capitalist Cycle is a translation of a previously unknown work in Marxist economic theory. Originally published in 1928, this rediscovered work is one of the most creative essays witten by a Soviet economist during the first two decades after the Russian Revolution. Following the dialectic of Hegel and Marx, Maksakovsky aims to provide a 'concluding chapter' for Marx's Capital. The book examines economic methodology and logically reconstructs Marx's analysis into a comprehensive and dynamic theory of cyclical economic crises. The introductory essay by Richard B. Day situates Maksakovsky's work within the Hegelian and Marxist philosophical traditions by emphasizing the book's dialectical logic as well as its contribution to economic science.\n\nRichard B. Day, Ph.D. (1970), University of London, is Professor of Political Economy at the University of Toronto. He has written extensively on early Soviet debates and translated several books, including works by N.I. Bukharin and E.A. Preobrazhensky."
