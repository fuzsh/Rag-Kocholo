Some schools honor the top 10% of students enrolled, some establish a minimum grade-point average, and others raise the minimum GPA for each year students are in school. Students must complete a minimum number of credit hours to be considered for the honor roll.\n\nFall 2022 honorees are below and include students whose honor roll status was conferred before Jan. 31, 2023. Students who believe their names were mistakenly omitted should directly contact their academic advisers. Not all students opt to have their names published.
