The first suggestion which history gives of the presence of a white man upon the site of Savannah, is found in the tradition that in this year, 1584, Sir Walter Raleigh landed here, and held conference with an Indian chief at a point near or upon what is now known as Gas Works Hill. This spot also marks the burial place of the chief, who chose it in memory of his compact with the \"great white man with a red beard.\"\n\n1670. American Treaty entered into between England and Spain, the latter power occupying St. Augustine, but no precise line being defined between Carolina and Florida. Hence a small military post was established at south end of Cumberland Island.\n\n1717 Sir Eobert Mountgomery secured from the Palati nate and Lords Proprietor of the Province of Carolina, a grant and release of all lands between the Altamaha and Savannah rivers. This territory was to be named the \"Margravate of Azilia,\" Sir Robert's attempt to colonize the lands failed, and in 1720, they reverted back to the Lords' Pro prietor of Carolina.\n\n1720. King George I. ordered General Nicholson, then Governor of South Carolina, to erect a fort at some suitable point, to hold possession of the Altamaha from either Span ish or French invasion, and Fort King George was erected near the confluence of the Oconee and Ocnrulgee Rivers.\n\n1732. Charter granted June 9th by King George II. to John, Lord Viscount Percival, James Oglethorpe, and their associates, to the lands lying between the Altamaha and Savannah Rivers, and they were incorporated as the \"Trii*, tees for establishing the Colony of Georgia in America.\" with Lord Percival as president of the corporation.\n\n42\n\nCHRONOLOGICAL HISTORY\n\nNovember 17th, the Anne, galley of 200 tons burden, sail ed from Gravesend, with 130 persons, representing thirtyfive families on board, including Hon.

He writes, \"On Governor Ellis' departure from hence, November 2d, 17(50, from the returns of the militia officers, and the best information I could get, the whole number of white people throughout the Province amounted\n\nonly to 6,000, and I had afterward reason to think there were not so many; of which number there was about sixty men\n\nbelonging to His Majesty's Independent Companies, t\\yo troops of rangers, consisting of five officers and seventy pri\n\nvate men, and the foot militia amounted to 1,025; and now, by a very careful inquiry from every part of the Province, the white people amount to 9,900, or say 10,000, of which 1,800 are effective militia.\"\n\n\"When I came, the return made me of negroes amounted to 3,578, but which I soon found greatly exceeded the real number then in the Province, and now, My Lord, we have at least 7,800.\"\n\n\"In 1760, they reported as appears by the Custom House books, only 3,400 pounds of rice, and in 1765, though a. short crop, 10,235 pounds. In 1761, we loaded only forty-two sail of sea vessels, and the last year we loaded 153, and on an average of much greater burden.\"\n\n1767. Although the Stamp Act had been repealed, the \"Quartering Act\" for quartering troops on the Americans, was still in force, and when on January 16th, Captain Phil\n\nips, commanding the Eoyal Americans, made requisition for barrack necessaries for his troops, the assembly promptly refused to comply. In punishment, General Gage withdrew all troops from the Province.\n\n1768. Much discontent prevailed on account of \"taxa\n\ntion without representation,\" encouraged by letters receiv ed from Northern Colonies, notably Massachusetts and Vir ginia.

On a second ballot he was again elected, to be again rejected. A third ballot gave the same result, but upon his declining- to serve, Archibald Bulloch was chosen, and accepted by Mr. Habersham. It was only upon inspect ing the journal of the House the next day that the Governor learned that Dr. Jones had been the third time elected, and that the choice of Mr. Bulloch had only been in consequence of Jones declining to serve.

The passage by Parliament on March 31st, of the \"Boston Port Bill,\" precluding all commerce with that city, aroused a spirit of indignation throughout all the Colonies, and on July 20th, a notice appeared in the \"Georgia Ga zette,\" stating that \"the critical situation to which the Brit-\n\nOF SAVANNAH.\n\n53\n\nish Provinces in America are likely to be reduced from the alarming and arbitrary imposition of the late act of Parlia ment respecting the town of Boston, as well as the acts that at present exist, tending to the raising of a perpetual rev enue, without the consent of the people or their representa tives,\" was extremely important, and \"calculated to deprive American subjects of their constitutional rights and liber ties.\" Hence, it was requested, \"that all persons within the limits of this Province, do attend at the liberty pole at Tondee's Tavern (Broughton Street, northwest corner Whitaker) in Savannah, on Wednesday, the 27th inst., in order that the said matter may be taken under considera tion, and such other constitutional measures pursued as may then appear most eligible.\"\n\nThis was signed by Noble Wimberly Jones, Archibald Bulloch, John Houstoun and George Walton, and was promptly responded to by those within reach, but as many of the out parishes might not have had sufficient notice of the meeting, it was resolved, \"that all further business be postponed un til August 10th.\"\n\nThe aspect of affairs was so threatening that the Govern or issued a proclamation, \"notifying that all such summons and calls by private persons, and all assemblings and meet ings of the people, which may tend to raise fears and jeal ousies in the minds of His Majesty's subjects, under pre tence of consulting together for redress of public grievances, are unconstitutional, illegal, and punishable by law.\"\n\nAugust 10th, the patriots, undaunted, met at the appoint ed time, and place, and passed unanimously a series of reso lutions, denouncing the offensive acts of Parliament, and claiming the same \"rights, privileges and immunities as their fellow subjects in Great Britain.\"\n\nGovernor Wright's influence prevented Georgia from be ing represented in the First Continental Congress.\n\n1775. January 18, upon invitation of Committee of Cit izens of Christ Church Parish, a Provincial Congress met in Savannah, its purpose being to elect delegates to the Conti nental Congress, meeting at Philadelphia, May 10th, follow ing. Through efforts of Governor Wright, but five of the twelve parishes sent deputies, and some of these under spe cial instructions, which embarrassed action. Under these circumstances, the expedient was adopted of laying papers, resolutions, etc., before the Lower Assembly, which had been convened simultaneously with the Congress, but action on their part was thwarted by the Governor's adjournment of the body. The Congress then formed articles of associa tion, differing in some important respects from the model\n\n54_________CHRONOLOGICAL HISTORY\n\nproposed by the Continental Congress, and elected Noble Wimberly Jones, Archibald Bulloch and John Houstoun, delegates. They, however, declined to attend, but wrote the President of the Continental Congress on April 8th, saying they \"could not consider themselves as representing the Province, since but five of the twelve parishes were repre sented,\" and they added, \"with what face could we have ap peared for a Province, whose inhabitants had refused to sac rifice the most trifling advantages to the public cause, and in whose behalf we did not think we co>uld safely pledge our selves for the execution of any one measure whatsoever.\"\n\nMay 9th, meeting of General Assembly fixed for this date, but members refused to respond, and the Governor pro rogued the Assembly untl November 7th.\n\nMay 10th, news of Battle of Lexington received.

Tradition asserts that part of this powder was sent to Boston, and used in the Bat tle of Bunker Hill. June 5. Various histories state that \"on Monday, June 5th, 1775, the first liberty pole was erected in Georgia,\" yet the \"Georgia Gazette\" of July 20th, 1774, has a notice, \"that all persons within the limits of this Province, do attend at the liberty pole in Savannah, on Wednesday, the 27th.\" A lib erty pole was however undoubtedly raised on this day, and ait the dinner immediately after, the first toast was -\"the King,\" the second \"American Liberty.\" June 22d, another meeting was held, and a Council of safety appointed, composed of William Ewen, President; Seth John Cuthbert, Secretary; Joseph Habersham, Edward Telfair, William LeConte, Basil Cowper, Joseph Clay, George Walton, John Glen, Samuel Elbert, William Young, Elisha Butler, George Houstouu, John Smith, Francis H.

Lieutenant Daniel Roberts and Mr. Raymond Demere were sent under flag of truce, to demand release of Rice, and were themselves arrested. Demand being then made from shore for the release of the prisoners, and insult ing replies returned, two shots from the four-pounders were fired at the vessels, when it was aonounced that if two other trustworthy men were sent, the British would treat with them. Captains James Screven and John Baker were then sent, who, upon arriving near the vessels, made their de mand, and upon receiving an insulting response, Baker fired at the man making it. This brought a fusilade in return, under which Screven and Baker hastily retired, fortunately with only one man slightly wounded. The battery now opened fire, continuing it for four hours.

Smith's Carolina company, who held this point. Overwhelming numbers soon com\n\npelled Smith's retreat to main line, which Howe had formed, running diagonally across Thunderbolt Road about where Dixon, Mitchell & Go's, lumber yard now is. Here 800 men,\n\nforming two brigades, were posted, Colonel Huger command ing the right and Colonel Elbert the left. The bridge across Lamar Creek (now Bilbo Canal) had been destroyed, and three hundred feet west, a trench had been dug, which soon filled with water from the marshes. Through the aid of a negro named Quanimo or Quash Dolly, a portion of the Brit ish force, following a path through the densely wooded\n\nswamp attained the American right rear, while the main body of their army manoeuvered in front. Sir James Baird, who commanded the flank movement, presently coming out\n\nupon the White Bluff Road, advanced northward, over whelming Colonel Walton, who with 100 militia, was sta tioned at junction of White Bluff and Ogeechee Roads, about\n\nOF SAVANNAH.\n\n59\n\nwhere Jasper Monument now stands. Turning, lie fell upon the American right, while Colonel Campbell, with the main body, brought forward his artillery, which had been con cealed behind the hill, opened a rapid fire upon the Ameri cans, and advanced. Between two fires, the Americans could only retreat. Colonel Roberts, with the artillery, se cured the causeway across Musgrove Creek on the Augusta Road, and covered the retreat of the right, which escaped in comparative safety. Colonel Elbert's command, the left, continued the fight until this avenue was closed to them, and then rushed through the town and rice fields near the river.\n\nMany were shot and bayonetted in the town. The tide was up, and the creek full, and thirty men were drowned in the attempt to swim across it.

September 29th, General Lachlan Melntosh sent flag of\n\ntruce to General Prevost, with a request that Mrs. Mcln\n\ntosh and family, and such other women and children as might choose, be permitted to leave the town, but the re\n\nquest was denied. October 2d, the French frigate La.

Excellent plans of attack are arranged, but\n\nunfortunately, they are overheard, or by some means obtain\n\ned by James Curry, sergeant major of the Charleston Grena\n\ndiers, who deserts at night, and conveys them to the enemy. It is pleasant to read that this scoundrel was afterward cap tured, and hung for his treachery.\n\n62\n\nCHRONOLOGICAL HISTORY\n\nOctober 9th, the Battle of Savannah was opened by Col onel Huger, upon the left. The exposure of the plan of bat tle enabled the British to concentrate their principal force at the real point of attack, the Spring Hill redoubt, situated near the site'of the present Central Railroad Depot. D'Estaing advanced here, supported by Count Dillon and Colonel Laurens of South Carolina, and followed by Pulaski, with his cavalry. Grape, chain and canister, together with the\n\nTHE KENT HOUSE, 35 W.

The colors of the Second South Carolina were planted on the top of the redoubt by Lieutenants Hume and Bush, but in an instant, both were killed. Lieutenant Grey, advancing to their support, was wounded, when Sergeant Jasper rushed forward, seized the colors, and though mortally wounded, bore them back to the Hue. D'Estaing, twice wounded, was borne from the field, and Pulaski, succeeding to the com mand, dashed forward to cheer the wavering troops.

Dr. James Lynah of the Charleston troops, removed the ball, and he was conveyed on board the United States Brig Wasp, where gangrene set in, and \"a few days later, he died, just as the brig got out of the river,\" and his body was consigned to the ocean. Further effort meaning but useless sacrifice, a retreat was ordered, which General Lincoln, with the re serve, covered. So closed one of the most sanguinary contests of the Revolution. The forces of the allies engaged number\n\ned only about 4,000, yet their loss in killed and wounded, was more than 1,100. The British loss was about 100.\n\nOctober 10th, D'Estaing gave order to raise the siege.
