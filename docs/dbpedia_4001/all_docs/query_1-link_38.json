        "text": "Thank You, John Paul II\n\nby Thomas A. Droleskey\n\n.\n\nThe appointment of one bad bishop after another during the pontificate of John Paul II was one of the areas that prompted me to publicly criticize the late prelate long, long before I returned to the Tradition of my childhood. It was evident to me in the 1980s that the former Karol Wojtyla was not serious about governing what I now understand to be the counterfeit conciliar church but thought at the time to be the Catholic Church.\n\n.\n\nMind you, the appointment of bad bishops is not a novelty of the conciliarism. By no means. The great Pope Leo XIII made some real blunders in his episcopal appointments, doing nothing to remove those appointees, including the Modernist Secretary of State, Mariano Cardinal Rampolla del Tidaro, who came very close to being elected as Leo's successor in the conclave of 1903 had it not been for the veto cast by the cardinal-elector from Krakow, Jan Maurycy Pawel Cardinal Puzyna de Kosieksko in behalf of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Cardinal Puzyna's veto, which was not recognized by chuch law and was abolished by the cardinal who emerged victorious from that conclave, permitted the election of the great anti-Modernist Archbishop of Venice to be the successor of Pope Leo XIII, Giuseppe Melchiorre Cardinal Sarto. That Pope Leo elevated both Rampolla and Archbishop Sarto to the College of Cardinals in separate conclaves demonstrates that the appointment of a Modernist and an anti-Modernist by a reigning pontiff is not a peculiarity of the conciliar church.\n\n.\n\nPope Leo XIII's great encyclical letters notwithstanding, however, one of the reasons that there was no movement to canonize him after his death was the fact that he did make mistakes in the governance of the Church, including his effort to use James Cardinal Gibbons, the longtime Americanist Archbishop of Baltimore, to convince French Catholics to accept the Third Republic (which was the basis of Pope Leo's Au Milieu Des Sollicitudes). Even this pragmatic decision to accept what appeared to Pope Leo XIII to be the best course of action to inculcate Catholicism into the Third Republic, however, came replete with a reminder of his oft-repeated condemnation of the separation of Church and State:\n\nWe shall not hold to the same language on another point, concerning the principle of the separation of the State and Church, which is equivalent to the separation of human legislation from Christian and divine legislation. We do not care to interrupt Ourselves here in order to demonstrate the absurdity of such a separation; each one will understand for himself. As soon as the State refuses to give to God what belongs to God, by a necessary consequence it refuses to give to citizens that to which, as men, they have a right; as, whether agreeable or not to accept, it cannot be denied that man's rights spring from his duty toward God. Whence if follows that the State, by missing in this connection the principal object of its institution, finally becomes false to itself by denying that which is the reason of its own existence. These superior truths are so clearly proclaimed by the voice of even natural reason, that they force themselves upon all who are not blinded by the violence of passion; therefore Catholics cannot be too careful in defending themselves against such a separation. In fact, to wish that the State would separate itself from the Church would be to wish, by a logical sequence, that the Church be reduced to the liberty of living according to the law common to all citizens....It is true that in certain countries this state of affairs exists. It is a condition which, if it have numerous and serious inconveniences, also offers some advantages -- above all when, by a fortunate inconsistency, the legislator is inspired by Christian principles -- and, though these advantages cannot justify the false principle of separation nor authorize its defense, they nevertheless render worthy of toleration a situation which, practically, might be worse.\n\n.\n\nThere has always been, therefore, a mysterious element at work in the appointment, retention and promotion of men to the hierarchy. It has been the case frequently that men perceived to be liberal-leaning responded to their grace-of-state and rose to the occasion to be firm defenders of the Faith, as was the case with Giovanni Maria Cardinal Mastai-Ferretti upon his election to succeed Pop Gregory XVI on June 16, 1846. The aforementioned Cardinal Rampolla fell out of favor during the pontificate of Pope Saint Pius X, rising again to exercise a bit of influence on his protege, Giacomo Cardinal della Chiesa, the Archbishop of Bologna, succeeded Pope Saint Saint Pius X on September 3, 1914. Ambrogio Damiano Achille Ratti, Pope Pius XI, who reigned from February 6, 1922, to February 10, 1939, was a wonderful defender of the rights of Christ the King, noting that all aspects of human life must be permeated by the truths of the Catholic Faith. It was Pius XI, nevertheless, who condemned Action Française and who urged the Cristeros in Mexico to put down their arms at a time in 1929 when they appeared to be winning, things that mystified some Catholics at the time. And it was Pope Pius XI who could have prevented World War II had he obeyed Our Lady's request to consecrated Russia to her Sorrowful and Immaculate Heart with all of the world's bishops. Pope Pius XII appointed Fathers Ferdinando Antonelli, O.F.M., Cap., and Annibale Bugnini, C.M., to work on the \"reform of the liturgy,\" effecting disastrous results over the course of the long term.\n\nThus, granted, the appointment of bishops and other subordinates by popes has been characterized frequently by the triumph of human error of judgment over divine inspiration. What has happened during the era of conciliarism, however, is different both in degree and in kind. Paul VI sought to permeate the diocesan structures with men committed to his doctrinal and liturgical revolutions. So committed was Giovanni Battista Montini to these twin, inter-related revolutions that he instituted the novelty of a mandatory retirement age (seventy-five) for diocesan ordinaries and curial prefects, disqualifying cardinals participating in a papal conclave after they had reached the age of eighty. Paul VI wanted to put into place his fellow Bolsheviks, men who dealt ruthlessly with priests and the laity who held fast to the Deposit of Faith as it has been handed down us from the time of the Apostles under the infallible protection of the Third Person of the Blessed Trinity, the Holy Ghost. The preconciliar \"past\" had to be wiped down the Orwellian memory hole as an artificial \"memory\" of that past was created and propagandized in \"homilies\" and in every manner of Catholic \"educational\" institutional imaginable as anyone who resisted was stigmatized as a veritable \"reactionary.\" Some of the more cut-throat Bolsheviks in the first generation of the Pauline episcopal appointees went so far as to send fully sane priests to psychiatric hospitals for \"reprogramming\" because they refused to accept the errors and novelties and sacrileges that they were being fomented in the \"name\" of the Catholic Church.\n\nPaul VI was also not adverse to appointing men who shared his own proclivities in the direction of perversity against the Sixth and Ninth Commandments, thereby helping to set the stage for the blossoming into full public view of the scandals that have rocked the Faith of the weak and helped to prevent non-Catholics from even considering a conversion to the Catholic Church. The appointment of Montini's fellow perverts, documented in Mrs. Randy Engel's The Rite of Sodomy helped to institutionalize a network of quisling infiltrators into chancery offices and seminaries and colleges and the massive bureaucracy of the then named National Conference of Catholic Bishops/United States Catholic Conference, now called the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, many of whom worked very closely with the Homosexual Collective and the left-wing of the Democrat Party to help draft \"policy statements\" in the name of the entire episcopal conference. The bishops appointed by Montini also signed off on the hiring of lay revolutionaries, men and women at war with doctrinal, liturgical and moral truths, to staff the International Commission on English in the Liturgy as it did its job of using the basic Bolshevik program, the Novus Ordo Missae, as the stage for breaking down a Catholic's supernatural resistance to liturgical novelties and to the inclusion of the worship of false gods in the context of what purported to be the offering of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass.\n\nPaul VI knew that a Catholic is taught to follow his shepherds, that it is an act out of the ordinary a Catholic to resist what is being taught to him in the \"name\" of the \"church.\" This is important to keep in mind as we assess the wreckage wrought by the conciliarist revolution. The sheep who remain in the conciliar structures are, for the most part, without blame in what has happened in the past four decades. Most of these people are busy leading their ordinary lives, oblivious to the fact that they are being led by false shepherds, men who are, with few exceptions, wolves in shepherds' clothing. Thy do not pay attention to ecclesiastical matters. And the little they do learn about the affairs of the conciliar church comes through the filter of outright apologists for conciliarism, such as the Eternally Wishful Television Network (EWTN), or from secular sources hostile to the Faith, thus either confusing them or affirming them in their resolve to \"defend\" the \"church.\" Most of the Catholics who bother to attend their local parish churches do not know anything about The Wanderer or The Remnant or Catholic Family News, no less the various internet websites discussing the doctrinal points proving that the heresies and errors of the given moment cannot possibly come from the Catholic Church. The small percentage of baptized Catholics who practice the Faith in the conciliar structures are content to follow their shepherds. Only a handful will respond now and again to the graces sent to them through the loving hands of Our Lady, the Mediatrix of All Graces, to investigate the true nature of the problems and how they must flee from the ravenous wolves in the diocesan structures.\n\nThe situation became a little more complex during the reign of John Paul II, who appeared to be more Catholic than Paul VI, especially as he, within a week of his election, discussed the importance of priests wearing their clerical garb and nuns wearing their habits. He also apologized in Dominicae Cenae, his “Holy Thursday” letter to priests, prompting the then named Sacred Congregation for the Sacraments and Divine Worship to issue Inaestimabile Donum as a means of correcting liturgical abuses, which gave such great hope to those of us yet in the “conservative” Novus Ordo camp. I was simply one of many who did not realize that the Novus Ordo Missae was the liturgical abuse par excellence. No amount of “repairs” could fix the “plumbing” in the haunted house of horrors that is the Novus Ordo Missae.\n\nThe initial hope that many of us placed in John Paul II was mistaken. He was a complete revolutionary, only more capable of seeming Catholic than Paul VI. Indeed, a review of some issues of The Angelus in 1980 and 1981 indicates that some members of the Society of Saint Pius X had taken heart from John Paul II’s “crackdown” on dissidents such as Father Hans Kung (who was able to remain at Tubingen University in a different capacity after the then-named Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith declared him no longer to be qualified to hold a Catholic chair in theology). John Paul II not only did not remove the Pauline Bolsheviks. He promoted them, including his friend from the Second Vatican Council, Joseph Bernardin, then the Archbishop of Cincinnati, to become the Archbishop of Chicago. Other auxiliary revolutionaries appointed during by Paul VI, including John Raymond McGann of the Diocese of Rockville Centre, New York, were permitted to wreak havoc with souls until they retired–and/or died–in full canonical good standing.\n\nAs time wore on, though, it became more and more evident that initial hopes in John Paul II were misplaced. His view of the nature of the Church, of ecumenism, of religious liberty, of the liturgy, of his belief that the Mosaic Covenant had never been superseded, of novel Scripture interpretations and his participation in some of the most scandalous “liturgies” since those offered to Baal or by the Druids or the Aztecs were part of his own personal commitment to a revolution he had helped to inaugurate at the Second Vatican Council. His episcopal appointments were meant to further institutionalize the revolution as they attempted to “restructure” some of its “aberrations” now and again with men who were, humanly speaking, more appealing than the Bolsheviks appointed by Paul VI but no less committed to the conciliar program. In other words, John Paul II’s episcopal appointments were meant to effect a Catholic “perestroika” in order to “correct” some of the “zeal” of the earlier revolutionaries as the conciliarist agenda was advanced by men deemed to be more “trustworthy” and “faithful” than the hard-core Bolsheviks who wielded episcopal machetes at anyone who dared to breathe a word favorable about the “ancien regime” of Tradition.\n\nAs one can see from the list below, John Paul II appointed 306 of the 423 of the American bishops alive at this moment. Noting that there are seven dioceses without a conciliar bishop at present, eleven of the 170 Roman Rite incumbent diocesan ordinaries (Daniel Pilarczyk, Raymundo Pena, John D’Arcy, Roger Mahony, Thomas Kelly, Howard Hubbard, Eusebius Beltran, Elden Curtiss, Victor Balke, John Kinney and William Syklstad) were appointed as bishops first by Paul VI. Nine of these eleven were then promoted within their own sees or appointed to other sees by John Paul II. Two of the eleven, Balke and Hubbard, remain where Paul VI put them, that is, Crookston, Minnesota, and Albany, New York, respectively, in 1976 and 1977. Another six diocesan ordinaries of the Roman Rite were “created” in the conciliar rite by Benedict XVI, who also transferred John Paul II’s George Niederauer from Salt Lake City to San Francisco to fill the vacancy created when William Levada became head of the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith in order to handle the weighty matters of the fate of unbaptized infants and the possible conditions justifying the use of a certain type of contraceptive device.\n\nThus, you see, 151 of the 170 diocesan ordinaries were created by John Paul II. Only six active (that is, non-retired) auxiliary bishops were appointed by Paul VI, another seven were appointed by Benedict XVI, meaning that John Paul appointed 66 of this number. A total of 218 of the 249 active conciliar bishops were thus created by John Paul II. (The numbers here may not add up at times; I might be off by a few here and there. This has all been done with pen and paper, not with any software program.) It is he who bears responsibility, ultimately, for what it is they do in their own dioceses and when gathered together in that putative “Catholic” semiannual gatherings of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n\nThis is very important to remember. All of the efforts to get the conciliar bishops to stop doing what they are supposed to be doing as a result of their being part and parcel of the conciliar revolution are bound to fail. These men are doing what the men (Paul VI, John Paul II, Benedict XVI) have wanted them to do. The conciliar bishops have been given carte blanche to supervise the ongoing revolution as they see fit, knowing that the novelty of episcopal collegiality will leave them in power, if not actually get them a nice promotion, over the course of time no matter what they say or do that might offend pious ears and actually be, shall we say, in overt conflict with the Deposit of Faith.\n\nOnly rarely have there been Vatican efforts to rein in some of the more egregious offenders, such as occurred when Father Donald Wuerl of Pittsburgh was appointed an auxiliary bishop of Seattle and sent by the Vatican to ride herd on the wild man known as Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen, a real honest-to-goodness, pre-1968 bishop, mind you, appointed by John XXIII in 1962, an effort that was an unmitigated disaster. And few were the interventions by a curial official to come to the assistance of a pastor being bludgeoned by a diocesan ordinary for his “conservatism,” as happened when the late Silvio Cardinal Oddi, then the Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, stepped in to prevent then-Rockville Centre Bishop John Raymond McGann to effect the removal of Father Robert Mason, who had been ordained in 1956, as pastor of Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Massapequa Park, New York, in March of 1983. The conciliar bishops have had their way as they, with only a few exceptions here and there, have acted as though they believe that the Catholic Church sprung up from nothing in 1962, a veritable ecclesiogenesis, if you will.\n\nMost of the men who serve as the conciliar bishops, especially those who are active, have had little, if any, exposure to the authentic patrimony of the Catholic Church. Their intellects, therefore, have been formed by the ethos of conciliarism. It is the documents of the Second Vatican Council and the postconciliar era, especially the Catechism of the Catholic Church and the 1983 Code of Canon Law that form their own catechesis of the Faith.\n\nOnce again noting a few exceptions here and there, most of these men are imbued with an uncritical acceptance of , if not an actual enthusiasm for, Modernist Biblical exegesis, particularly that of the historical-critical school and the rules outlined in Dei Verbum. Their understanding of Catholic Social Teaching is formed almost exclusively from Gaudium et Spes, Dignitatis Humanae and the encyclical letters of Paul VI and, of course, John Paul II. Their ecclesiology is based upon Lumen Gentium and Unitatis Redintegratio. Any real understanding of authentic liturgical development? Perish the thought? Even Sacroscanctum Concilium is more or less obsolete for the conciliarists, ever eager to chart new liturgical paths as they claim gratuitously that they are continuing “tradition” as they introduce one new sacrilegious novelty after another? Christology? A mass of confusion? Sacramental theology beyond the liturgy? In the twilight zone beyond the outer limits, which is why there has been so much criticism of the 1968 rite of episcopal consecration and the 1969 rite of priestly ordination. Moral theology? Just check to see the conciliar bishops’ support for the Homosexual Collective, their relative silence and inaction on contraception (despite their recent statement on the matter), their refusal to pronounce solemnly what pro-abortion Catholic politicians have done to themselves, that is, excommunication. There is not one field of the Faith where you will find a single bishop has not accepted at least one, if not all, of the precepts of the conciliarism, thereby tainting his view of the Catholic Faith.\n\nIndeed, it is likely the case that most of the conciliar bishops in this country and around the world have never heard of Pope Leo XIII’s Satis Cognitum, December 8, 1896, no less realize that it describes how they have poisoned the well of the Faith and have excommunicated themselves from the Church in the process. Again admitting a few exceptions, most of the conciliar bishops are content to act as bureaucrats who serve as a clearinghouse for what their administrative apparatchiks present to them for their pro-forma signatures. And there is not one conciliar bishop who is willing to state publicly that the Novus Ordo Missae offends God and is thus harmful to souls, not one conciliar bishop who does not violate Pope Pius XI's ban on the classroom teaching on matters pertaining to the Sixth and Ninth Commandments. The bureaucrats run the show. Their decisions on these matters stand as most of the conciliar bishops act like Howdy Doody to Buffalo Bob Smith.\n\nTo wit, a major controversy arose eleven years ago when I reported on the fact that the Saint John’s University School of Law had hired a professor, Tanya Hernandez, who had worked for the Center for Reproductive Law and Public Policy in Puerto Rico, participating in a lawsuit against Fathers Norman Weslin and Richard Welch to claim that their pro-life activism was based upon a bias against women. Professor Hernandez has moved on to Rutgers University in the past few years. She was, however, still teaching at Saint John’s University School of Law as late as the 1999-2000 academic year, prompting me to approach Brooklyn Bishop Thomas Daily during the March for Life on January 22, 2000, to ask him what he was going to do about the matter. Daily, who gained notoriety two years later for how he helped to enable the perverted priests in the Archdiocese of Boston, mumbled that he did not know she was still there, doing a sort of Art Carney as Ed Norton impression, walking pretty hurriedly to get away from his interrogator.\n\nYes, you see, the bottom line is this: the conciliar bishops have been taught by the false ethos of ecumenism and the new ecclesiology that souls are not really at risk any longer. There is no need to evangelize those outside of the Faith, especially the Jews. The late John Cardinal O’Connor told a B’Nai Brith meeting in Florida in early 1998 that Judaism was “meant to coexist side by side with Catholicism until the end of time,” noting that he was only teaching what his “boss,” John Paul II, had taught. There was no need for him, therefore, to evangelize Talmudic Jews at a meeting of one of their Masonic organizations. There is no need for any conciliar bishop to evangelize anyone outside of the Catholic Church, Jew or Protestant or Mohammedan. There is also no need to supervise the teaching of doctrine to Catholics as almost everything is open “for discussion,” especially as regards the American notion of “academic freedom.” Souls can be exposed to any amount of poison imaginable and survive well because, after all, a “loving”God does not want to “inhibit” people from hearing a diversity of “ideas.”\n\nEven those conciliar bishops who have more of the sensus Catholicus than others find it very hard to accept that the problems they face in their own pastoral circumstances are the result of something other than the bad interpretation or application of the “norms: of the Second Vatican Council. Lincoln Bishop Fabian Bruskewitz said as much recently during a talk he gave to a group of conservative Catholics. Men such as Bishop Bruskewitz continue to believe that the problem is not with conciliarism itself but with the “hijacking” of the Second Vatican Council so that its “true” precepts have never been understood adequately or applied properly. Those of us who adhere to the perennial teaching of the Catholic Church are thus talking Swahili when we point out the doctrinal errors of the Second Vatican Council and explain the long history of the antecedent roots of conciliarism that are to be found in the infiltration of Modernism into many of the precincts of the Catholic Church, especially from the time of the pontificate of Pope Benedict XV, 1914-1922, to “election” of John XXIII in 1958.\n\nNevertheless, however, the faithful who find themselves in the conciliar structures and who know little, if anything, of the authentic patrimony of the Catholic Church must be evangelized by authentic bishops who are indeed faithful to the entire Deposit of the Faith and who reject conciliarism en toto. The sheep in the conciliar structures are merely following their shepherds. They are not, for the most part, to blame. Thus it is that true bishops in the catacombs who understand that none of what we are experiencing at present can come from the hand of true popes or from the Catholic Church must find a way to help these sheep to realize the full truth of our situation at present.\n\nHow is this to be done? A good question. Let me propose a most non-infallible answer.\n\nSaint Patrick converted Ireland by reaching the Druid chieftains, who were hostile to the Catholic Faith. He converted the chieftains in order to convert the people, knowing that the people would follow the religion of their leaders. It was an inspired approach to take. Saint Patrick was equipped with nothing other than the graces won for us on the wood of the Holy Cross by the shedding of every single drop of the Most Precious Blood of Our Blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. That is all he had.\n\nI arise today\n\nThrough a mighty strength, the invocation of the Trinity,\n\nThrough a belief in the Threeness,\n\nThrough confession of the Oneness\n\nOf the Creator of creation.\n\nI arise today\n\nThrough the strength of Christ's birth and His baptism,\n\nThrough the strength of His crucifixion and His burial,\n\nThrough the strength of His resurrection and His ascension,\n\nThrough the strength of His descent for the judgment of doom.\n\nI arise today\n\nThrough the strength of the love of cherubim,\n\nIn obedience of angels,\n\nIn service of archangels,\n\nIn the hope of resurrection to meet with reward,\n\nIn the prayers of patriarchs,\n\nIn preachings of the apostles,\n\nIn faiths of confessors,\n\nIn innocence of virgins,\n\nIn deeds of righteous men.\n\nI arise today\n\nThrough the strength of heaven;\n\nLight of the sun,\n\nSplendor of fire,\n\nSpeed of lightning,\n\nSwiftness of the wind,\n\nDepth of the sea,\n\nStability of the earth,\n\nFirmness of the rock.\n\nI arise today\n\nThrough God's strength to pilot me;\n\nGod's might to uphold me,\n\nGod's wisdom to guide me,\n\nGod's eye to look before me,\n\nGod's ear to hear me,\n\nGod's word to speak for me,\n\nGod's hand to guard me,\n\nGod's way to lie before me,\n\nGod's shield to protect me,\n\nGod's hosts to save me\n\nFrom snares of the devil,\n\nFrom temptations of vices,\n\nFrom every one who desires me ill,\n\nAfar and anear,\n\nAlone or in a mulitude.\n\nI summon today all these powers between me and evil,\n\nAgainst every cruel merciless power that opposes my body and soul,\n\nAgainst incantations of false prophets,\n\nAgainst black laws of pagandom,\n\nAgainst false laws of heretics,\n\nAgainst craft of idolatry,\n\nAgainst spells of women and smiths and wizards,\n\nAgainst every knowledge that corrupts man's body and soul.\n\nChrist shield me today\n\nAgainst poison, against burning,\n\nAgainst drowning, against wounding,\n\nSo that reward may come to me in abundance.\n\nChrist with me, Christ before me, Christ behind me,\n\nChrist in me, Christ beneath me, Christ above me,\n\nChrist on my right, Christ on my left,\n\nChrist when I lie down, Christ when I sit down,\n\nChrist in the heart of every man who thinks of me,\n\nChrist in the mouth of every man who speaks of me,\n\nChrist in the eye that sees me,\n\nChrist in the ear that hears me.\n\nI arise today\n\nThrough a mighty strength, the invocation of the Trinity,\n\nThrough a belief in the Threeness,\n\nThrough a confession of the Oneness\n\nOf the Creator of creation\n\nFortified with Total Consecration to Our Lady's Sorrowful and Immaculate Heart, my friends, can, say, a Bishop Mark Pivarunas or a Bishop Daniel Dolan or a Bishop Robert Neville or a Bishop Clarence Kelly or a Bishop Robert McKenna, among others, do any worse? That is, the conciliar church refuses to evangelize others. Those who of us who have come to accept the fact that the conciliar church is counterfeit cannot refuse to evangelize at least a few of those who are recognized by the vast majority of Catholics as possessing episcopal authority in their dioceses. Yes, the work of tending to the sheep already in the flock is vast. Our Lord did tell us, however, that there would be times we might have to leave the ninety-nine in search of the one lost sheep:\n\nNow the publicans and sinners drew near unto him to hear him. And the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying: This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them. And he spoke to them this parable, saying: What man of you that hath an hundred sheep: and if he shall lose one of them, doth he not leave the ninety-nine in the desert, and go after that which was lost, until he find it? And when he hath found it, lay it upon his shoulders, rejoicing:\n\nAnd coming home, call together his friends and neighbours, saying to them: Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost? I say to you, that even so there shall be joy in heaven upon one sinner that doth penance, more than upon ninety-nine just who need not penance. (Lk. 15: 1-8)\n\nThat is, the conciliar church refuses to evangelize others. Those who of us who have come to accept the fact that the conciliar church is counterfeit cannot refuse to evangelize at least a few of those who are recognized by the vast majority of Catholics as possessing episcopal authority in their dioceses. Yes, the work of tending to the sheep already in the flock is vast. Our Lord did tell us, however, that there would be times we might have to leave the ninety-nine in search of the one lost sheep.\n\nYes, I know. We are talking about the lost \"shepherds\" in this case, most of whom have at least the grace of their Baptism and, in most, although not all, cases the gifts and the fruits of the Holy Ghost received in the Sacrament of Confirmation Such an effort is fraught with difficulties and seems, humanly speaking, to be utter madness. Did not Saint Peter Canisius seek to evangelize those who had fallen into Protestantism? Did not Saint Francis de Sales do so? Did not Saint Josaphat seek to convert the Orthodox? Who is any one of us to say that God’s graces and Our Lady’s prayers are not powerful enough to win back to the fullness of the Catholic Faith those men who believe that they are indeed true shepherds with a divine mandate to teach according to the precepts of conciliarism? The Apostles should have stayed in the Upper Room in Jerusalem following the descent of the Holy Ghost upon them on Pentecost Sunday if they had acted according to human reason and to “common sense.” They acted in accord with the divine mandate they had been converted by Our Lord Himself before He Ascended to the Father’s right hand in glory on Ascension Thursday. They did not reckon on being successful. They desired only to be faithful.\n\nThis work is, as we know, ultimately that of Our Lady’s Sorrowful and Immaculate Heart. God will restore the Church in a flash following the Triumph of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. In the meantime, however, we are required to make an effort to reach as many souls as possible. While people must be open to God’s graces to respond favorably to the truth, we must try to plant some seeds and then to water what we plant with fervent prayers and sacrifices offered to God through the Sorrowful and Immaculate Heart of Mary. Imagine what our situation would like if just one conciliar bishop decided, perhaps after years of reflection and prayer following contact made with him by a true bishop, to announce publicly that Benedict–or whoever his successor may be–had defected from the Faith and could not thus hold any ecclesiastical office.\n\nAbout fifteen families followed Father Stephen Zigrang , who is not a sedevacantist, out of the Diocese of Galveston-Houston three years ago when he left to offer the Immemorial Mass of Tradition at Queen of Angels in Dickinson, Texas. There are many other examples of this. Some of the sheep will indeed follow their shepherds if the latter are willing to take the steps necessary to correct their own personal situations, both doctrinally and sacramentally, and make a break from the hold that conciliarism and its novelties, especially that of episcopal collegiality, has on them. Most of the sheep are not going to follow any bishop, sedevacantist or non-sedevacantist, outside of the \"official structures,\" which is why it is important to reach a few of the ostensible bishops in order to help reach the sheep who look to them as they become further and further immersed in the world of the Novus Ordo and the novelties of conciliarism.\n\nThere is not one of the active (or even retired) conciliar bishops listed below who can be pointed to by non-sedevacantist traditional Catholics as possessing the totality of the Catholic Faith. An understanding of the Social Reign of Christ the King? A familiarity with and acceptance of the work of Father Denis Fahey? An understanding and an rejection of the heresy of Americanism? An acceptance of Pope Pius XI's Mortalium Animos? Take a good, hard look at that list below. While there are some who might be receptive to entering into a \"dialogue\" with bishops they consider to be \"irregular\" (when the reverse is true), and it is best not to name them here, most of th men below are oblivious to the authentic patrimony of the Catholic Church. Worse yet, many others countenance open dissent from the Deposit of Faith (as we learned today when told that a catechism in use in the Diocese of San Diego states categorically that one day there will be women priests in the \"Catholic\" Church).\n\nThe situation is similar universally. Which of the 114 voting cardinals, each of whom has been appointed by either John Paul II or Benedict XVI, does not suffer from the same embrace of conciliarism as the American conciliar bishops? If there is one, just one, who happens to get \"elected,\" how is he going to turn around the conciliar bishops of the world? A non-sedevacantist traditional Catholic must believe, as I did when I was one, that something miraculous is going to happen. Those of us who have come to accept the doctrinal and canonical premises underlying sedevacantism, which even the late Mario Francesco Cardinal Pompedda conceded on February 8, 2005, were valid, and have relevancy to our current situation are not, therefore, by themselves or out of their minds when trusting in the Providence of God as made manifest through the Triumph of the Immaculate Heart of Mary will restore the Church and bury the nightmare of the counterfeit conciliar church forever.\n\nConsider this assessment of the situation in Elizabethan England, provided in Father Harold Gardiner's Edmund Campion: Hero of God's Underground (Vision Books, Farrar, Straus and Cudahy, 1957):\n\n\"But George,\" asked Father Campion, \"doesn't that mean that the people, too, are confused? Are they all for the decrees of Elizabeth, by which they are not allowed to hear Mass and must reveal their knowledge of the whereabouts of priests? Or dot they rebel against those decrees? What is it like in England now?\n\n\"Father,\" answered George, \"things are in a terrible state of confusion. Catholics are bewildered. Some will go to the services that Elizabeth has commanded must be the general rule. Others think they must in conscience stay away, though they have to pay enormous fines if they do not appear at their parish church every Sunday.\n\n\"Most of the older priests who were restored to their parishes under Queen Mary--bless her--have not taken a firm stand against the new laws, and so, the body of the Catholics do not know where to turn. Thanks be to God, we hope that men like you and Father Persons will draw up some plans of definite action for us. We are ready, all the Catholics I know, to do what we must for the cause of Christ and His Church, but we must have leadership.\" (p. 57).\n\nThis is a perfect description of the confusion under the \"new laws\" promulgated by the conciliar church. As was the case at the end of the Sixteenth Century in England, the confused priests and faithful need leadership in our own day today.\n\nWe must, as I have been repeating in recent months, bear with each other charitably in these difficult times. Such forbearance is not an indifference to the objective truth of our situation. Not at all. It is, though, a recognition that not everyone is going to see the truth at once. It is a recognition that God’s graces work over the course of time. Denouncing people for things that they do not know and have no basis to accept (as their understanding of the Catholic Faith is from conciliarism, not from the authentic patrimony of the Church) will not help open eyes that have been blinded by the toxic poisons spread by the counterfeit conciliar church. Efforts must be made to reach these people through their “chieftains,” if you will, just as Saint Patrick confronted the Druid chieftains in his own day.\n\nContinuing to pledge ourselves every day as the consecrated slaves of Our Lady’s Sorrowful and Immaculate Heart, may we pray for the shepherds who understand the doctrinal principles that prove the conciliar church to be counterfeit so that they might, even if they do not speak to each other (not an unusual phenomenon as Fathers Dominic and Francisco Radecki point out in Tumultuous Times), attempt what seems to be complete madness in human terms, that is, to convert a conciliar shepherd or two to the Faith of our fathers without any concession to conciliarism whatsoever. Yes, this will require a lot of work and prayer and sacrifice. As Pope Leo XIII said to Saint Frances Xavier Cabrini at the end of one of their meetings, \"Work, Cabrini, work! We must work until we die!\"\n\nOur Lady of Good Success, pray for us.\n\nAppendix of the conciliar bishops of the United States of America\n\nBishops and their Dates of Consecration, arranged according to Metropolitan Provinces (data derived from www.catholic-hierarchy.org).\n\nDates of consecration provided below. Hyperlinks will take you to www.catholic-hierarchy.org, the site from which this data was derived and at which you may find additional information about each of the conciliar bishops below. The number in parentheses following the name of the conciliar pope represents the aggregate number of his appointees in this compilation. There might be some repetition here and there. Hey, what do you want? This is a free site. A lot of time went into compiling and entering the data, which is designed to provide readers with a general idea as to the lack of understanding of the Faith possessed by the conciliar bishops. No one of the men listed below assents to everything contained in the Deposit of Faith as it has been entrusted by Our Lord to Holy Mother Church and as the latter has taught it perennially. Each is tainted by an acceptance of one or more of the precepts of conciliarism, if not tainted by the entirety conciliarism altogether. One can discern from a conciliar bishop's place origin the line of \"descent\" (Bernardin-Pliarczyk, Mahony, Dearden, Roach, Quinn of San Francisco, Law, Krol, Wuerl, et al.), which is especially pertinent in the case of hard core revolutionary conciliarists.\n\nHere is an overview of the appointments:\n\nAggregate Number of Bishops Appointed by the Conciliar Popes in the Conciliar Structures (note: 1, Archbishop Philip Hannan, the retired Archbishop of New Orleans, Louisiana, was appointed by Pope Pius XII in 1956), Roman Rite and Eastern Rite:\n\nJohn Paul II (308)\n\nPaul VI (91)\n\nBenedict XVI (21)\n\nJohn XXIII (3)\n\nPope Pius XII (1)\n\nTotal Bishops: 424 (four of whom are in Rome)\n\nRoman Rite Bishops (Ordinaries, Auxiliaries, Retired Bishops, Roman Curia):\n\nJohn Paul II: (280)\n\nPaul VI: (89)\n\nBenedict XVI (20)\n\nJohn XXIII (3)\n\nPius XII (1)\n\nTotal Bishops : 294 (four of whom are in Rome)\n\nEastern Rite Bishops:\n\nJohn Paul II: (26)\n\nPaul VI: (2)\n\nBenedict XVI (1)\n\nJohn XXIII (1)\n\nTotal Bishops: 30\n\n.\n\nProvince of the Archdiocese of Anchorage:\n\n.\n\nArchdiocese of Anchorage:\n\n.\n\nRoger Lawrence Schwietz, O.M.I., appointed originally by John Paul II (1), consecrated in 1990 (former Bishop of Duluth);\n\n.\n\nFrancis Thomas Hurley, emeritus, appointed a bishop originally by Paul VI (1), consecrated in 1970 (priest and former Auxiliary Bishop of San Francisco)\n\n.\n\nDiocese of Fairbanks:\n\n.\n\nDonald Joseph Kettler, appointed a bishop originally by John Paul II (2) (2 ordinaries), consecrated in 2002 (priest of Diocese of Sioux Falls, South Dakota).\n\n.\n\nDiocese of Juneau:\n\n.\n\nMichael William Warfel, appointed originally by John Paul II (3) , consecrated in 1996 (priest of Archdiocese of Cincinnati).\n\n.\n\nProvince of the Archdiocese of Atlanta:\n\n.\n\nArchdiocese of Atlanta:\n\n.\n\nWilton Daniel Gregory, appointed originally by John II (4), consecrated in 1983 (former Auxiliary Bishop of Chicago, Bishop of Belleville, Illinois).\n\n.\n\nJohn Francis Donoghue, emeritus, appointed originally by John Paul II (5), consecrated in 1984 (former Bishop of Charlotte, North Carolina).\n\n.\n\nDiocese of Charleston (South Carolina):\n\n.\n\nRobert Joseph Baker, appointed originally by John Paul II (6), consecrated in 1999 (unclear as to where he had been ordained a priest).\n\n.\n\nDavid Bernard Thompson, emeritus, appointed originally by John Paul II (7), consecrated in 1989 (priest of Archdiocese of Philadelphia and Allentown, Pennsylvania, which was created out of the boundaries of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia).\n\n.\n\nDiocese of Charlotte:\n\n.\n\nPeter Joseph Jugis appointed originally by John Paul II (8), consecrated in 2003 (priest of Diocese of Charlotte).\n\n.\n\nWilliam George Curlin, , emeritus, appointed originally by John Paul II (9), consecrated in 1988 (priest of Archdiocese of Washington).\n\n.\n\nDiocese of Raleigh (North Carolina):\n\n.\n\nMichael Francis Burbidge, appointed originally by John Paul II (10), consecrated in 2002 (priest of Archdiocese of Philadelphia).\n\n.\n\nFrancis Joseph Gossman, emeritus, appointed originally by Paul VI (2), consecrated in 1968 (priest and former Auxiliary Bishop of Baltimore).\n\n.\n\nDiocese of Savannah (Georgia):\n\n.\n\nJohn Kevin Boland, appointed originally by John Paul II (11), consecrated in 1995 (priest of Diocese of Savannah).\n\n.\n\nRaymond William Lessard, emeritus, appointed originally by Paul VI (3), consecrated in 1983 (priest of Diocese of Fargo).\n\n.\n\nProvince of the Archdiocese of Baltimore:\n\n.\n\nArchdiocese of Baltimore:\n\n.\n\nWilliam Henry Keeler, appointed originally by John Paul II (12), consecrated in 1979 (priest and former Bishop of Harrisburg)\n\n.\n\nDenis James Madden, Auxiliary Bishop, appointed originally by Benedict XVI (1), consecrated in 2005 (ordained for the Order of Saint Benedict;
