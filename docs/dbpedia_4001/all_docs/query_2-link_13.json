A2 ******** SAFETY DEVICE SAVES LIFE A month or so ago a young man was killed at the plant of the local Portland Cement Company by accidentally getting into the hopper from which the limestone rock is automatically fed into big grinding machines. Men now work about the hoppers are required by the employer to each wear a life belt and line. To this circumstance alone, Charles Kostechka, a young man employed at the plant, owes his life, owing to wet stone not moving at the hopper, when he fell in. He was buried to the neck in stone but the life line held and the prompt arrival of aid effected his rescue without his suffering serious injuries. He was hurried to the hospital where it was shortly given out that he will be about again in a few days. Kostechka is twenty- two years of age and came here lately from the Town of Cato.
