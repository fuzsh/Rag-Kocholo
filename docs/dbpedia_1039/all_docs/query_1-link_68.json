Once a person releases them into the world, they travel far and wide and can change form depending upon the person interpreting them. This is why you should be careful with what you say and what you write. This something that a writer neglects to remember much to her cost in Mrs. Noisy, a domestic comedy that turns into heart-breaking drama by way of literary struggle.\n\nInspired by real-life events from 2005, the film follows a conflict between two neighbours in a danchi (housing complex).\n\nOur protagonist is Maki Yoshioka (Yukiko Shinohara), a once successful novelist who is struggling through a prolonged slump. The reason? According to her editor, her characters are two-dimensional. With each work he turns down the more desperate she becomes. With a deadline looming, moving to a new home with her daughter Nanako (Chise Niitsu) and husband Yuichi (Takuma Nagao) promises a fresh start but things go awry soon after Maki finishes unpacking as her neighbour, Miwako Wakata (Yoko Ootaka), starts infringing on her life.\n\nMiwako is a flinty middle-aged lady who lives with her reclusive husband and has a habit of thwacking her futons while also singing loudly on her balcony at different hours of the day. This noise often disrupts Maki’s work just as she’s about to hit a moment of genius. Maki really takes offense over perceived social slights that come when Nanako slips out and disappears all day while she is too busy writing to notice. Nanako returns to find Maki in a panic only to inform her mother that she was either at the park or at Miwako’s apartment. When the older woman scolds Maki over her poor parenting, the police get involved and neighbours start to gossip. This is when Maki becomes really hostile and quarrels begin.\n\nThe film gets into gear once the domestic war starts. It is one where the weapons of choice in the Battle of the Balconies are barbs, brooms, and boomboxes. The dust-ups between the women devolve into slapstick comedy for onlookers in the surrounding community and, eventually, the internet after Maki listens to her irresponsible social media savvy cousin Naoya (Raiki Yonemoto) and turns her conflict into a series of online blog posts where she creates a caricature of a nutty neighbour who kidnaps little Nanako. Soon a book deal with a sleazy publisher enticed by the notoriety is in the offing and it looks like Maki has found her authorial mojo again but once the media get a hold of her words they turn it into a cause célèbre and it soon spirals out of control as Miwako is made into a monster. When the true nature of Miwako and her husband emerges, it gets a lot more complicated than expected.\n\nThe build up is gradual but it benefits from all of the everyday details in routines and behaviour that writer/director Chihiro Amano draws upon. Audiences will find a universal story of the fundamental difficulties in trying to balance career and family, Amano intertwining the quotidian aspects of Maki’s life with scenes of editorial meetings and writing to create her underlying sense of anxiety that leads to the conflict. While Miwako’s absurd behaviour and admonishment may be the spark that lights the fire of conflict it is mostly Maki’s self-doubt that is the kindling since it is clear that their dispute is merely where she channels her guilt and frustration over failing as a mother and writer.\n\nBoth Maki’s desperation to make it and her weaknesses as a writer – her inability to add depth to characters – play into why she cannot see more to Miwako other than a nuisance neighbour and this organically leads into a situation ripe for media sensationalism. Maki’s words set the parameters of the conflict between the two women and the media take it into a particularly nasty phase. The details of how things go viral online and on variety shows hit notes of believability and Amano takes advantage of the various formats to show how a recording of a particularly laugh-out-loud funny fight is parasitically used for ratings with little room for humanity which leads audiences into the final third of the movie where the roles are surprisingly reversed.\n\nStage actress Yoko Ootaka gives a fine comic performance as Miwako who comes off as a fierce ogress who bellows and rages and bashes down walls but when there is a radical shift in perspective to give us more background, her performance softens remarkably so that there is a new view of her character. It’s foreshadowed via props she hands to Nanako and how she treats the little girl, but Amano’s choice to frame things from Maki’s perspective prevents all but the most observant and objective viewer from piecing the clues together so it is easy to become prejudiced against Miwako.\n\nIt isn’t until the full picture is unfurled, effectively after many in the audience have probably taken Maki’s side, that we discover how little we knew of this human being whose life and behaviour the writer had turned into a parody. Indeed, the final scenes are a devastating reversal and I was in tears over how the older woman was treated by the media. Maki is put through similar treatment and loses her capacity with words to explain her actions in front of the media. While this is offered as a chance of redemption at the end, it felt a little too easy for her to get off the hook, so believable and heartrending was the humiliation that Miwako had been put through.\n\nWhatever the case, the film makes the case of how thoughtless words can severely damage people. It is something I struggle with myself so I appreciated that the film made me think about it. I highly recommend this drama, a surprising and very moving depiction of the power of words over everyday lives.\n\nHappy Weekend!\n\nI hope you are all doing well.\n\nI only published one film review this week, Mrs. Noisy, which I highly recommend watching. There were two films released at the start of the week which I posted about. On Sunday last week I took part in a Heroic Purgatory podcast recording of a Stephen Chow film from the 90s.\n\nWhat are the next batch of films released this weekend?\n\ncolorless\n\n猿楽町で会いましょう 「Sarugakuchou de aimashou」\n\nRelease Date: June 04th, 2021\n\nDuration: 122 mins.\n\nDirector: Takashi Koyama\n\nWriter: Takashi Koyama, Yu Shibuya (Screenplay),\n\nStarring: Daichi Kaneko, Ruka Ishikawa, Shuntaro Yanagi, Sakurako Konishi, Ikuma Nagatomo, Hitoe Ookubo,\n\nWebsite IMDB\n\nThe winner of 2018’s Unfinished Movie Trailer Grand Prix MI-CAN where filmmaker’s can win a cash prize based on a trailer around 3 minutes, this takes place in Sarugakuchou in Shibuya and looks at the lives of two young people drawn to that area of Tokyo who meet there and embark upon a stormy relationship.

When the head of the Kurokawa family is assassinated by someone, his three children are immediately suspected since they were fighting to take his place. Ryu Haibara, a servant of the family, begins to investigate the children at the request of a detective and uncovers secrets…\n\nThere were two films by actor/writer/director Yutaro Nakamura at the Osaka Asian Film Festival 2021. They shared actors such as An Ogawa (For Rei) but wildly diverged stylistically. The first, Sweet Bitter Candy, was a standard-issue drama of bad romance and schoolgirls while A New Wind Blows featured a storyline that was wayward and dreamy and clearly shot guerrilla style in the suburbs. It was punctuated with scenes that offer visceral emotions, surprising twists, and a eccentric-cum-humanistic bent that made it stand out.\n\nThe film introduces us to a set of characters – Yujiro (Yujiro Hara), Hikari (Hikaru Saiki), Takaya (Takaya Shibata), Anzu (An Ogawa), and Kotaro (Yutaro Nakamura, the director himself) – who are cycled through in a number of stories where they get together and alternately torment and fall in love with each other, first as high schoolers and then as young adults later, before returning to them as high schoolers. Mental illness, prejudice, and literal bed hopping take place and there are extremes of emotions that go from normality to very dark. However, as scenes and sequences slip by, there is a sense of care and comfort and possibility. You can read my review here and also a playfulness as music video sequences and cute on-screen text and images are used.\n\nYutaro Nakamura took time out of his schedule to answer questions relating to A New Wind Blows.\n\nThis interview was done with the help of Takako Pocklington, who translated between English and Japanese to help bring director Nakamura’s answers to this blog.\n\nThe Japanese transcript is first and it is followed by English.

It was chaotic and fun but also a little shocking. It mixed realism with a little fantasy and absurd humour – Takaya Shibata dressing as a fairy on a cold day must have been tough! – but I found it optimistic in the end and felt I could watch it again and again.\n\nHow did you get your start in filmmaking?\n\nI entered university where I could study video production and theatre. The academic politics were oppressive, so I started making films to express my opposition to it.\n\nAre you influenced by any directors?\n\nThere aren’t any directors whom I was particularly influenced by, but I like director Yoji Yamada, Kazuo Kuroki and Yoichi Higashi.\n\nWhere did the idea for the film come from?\n\nI was working at a production company and I started to write a rough storyline based on my frustration with daily life.\n\nThere are big tonal shifts in the film, from death to sweet confessions of love but I found it optimistic despite the darkness. What do you want the audience to take away from the story?\n\nI want the audience to enjoy it since I made it with ease.\n\nYou have worked with some of the actors before – Ann Ogawa in “Sweet Bitter Candy” and Takaya Shibata in “Wakasa and Bakasa” – could you talk about your reason for casting them as well as Hikaru Saiki and Yujiro Hara?\n\nI just cast them because they are good friends in my private life at the time.\n\nHow did you and the actors get into the roles?\n\nI constantly told them what I wanted to do at both rehearsals and at the shoot.\n\nWas this a case of guerilla filmmaking？ If so, what was it like shooting the chaos in the second half of the film in public?\n\nYes, the scenes outside were guerilla filmmaking. We shot under the tense circumstance of being stopped or being complained about.\n\nCould you explain about the use of music in the film, particularly the lyrics of the Akari Machi song?\n\nI had an image of the song earlier. I wrote the lyrics as an extension of the script. I have worked with Machi-san several times, so we had a similar idea for the song.\n\nYou work both in front of and behind the camera. Do you have a preference for one or the other?\n\nI prefer to be behind the camera.\n\nDo you have another project in the works?\n\nYes, I have some projects I’m trying to shoot.\n\nThanks for taking the time to answer the questions.\n\nThanks to you too.\n\nDespite knowing that low-budget films are often shot very quickly, when I saw that Shinji Imaoka was going to be at Osaka Asian Film Festival 2021, I was surprised at how quick his return was since he was at the 2020 edition with the drama Reiko and the Dolphin for which I had interviewed him. Of course, since he has a background in making pink films he knows how to do a quick turnaround on a production but an even bigger surprise lay in the subject of his film: a divorce as seen through the eyes of a child done by way of the musical genre. That and it was one of at least four(???) films he made in 2020!\n\nThe film is a star vehicle for starlet Yuune Sakurai who takes on the role of Haruka, an 11-year-old girl who is navigating experiencing the sensation of love for the first time while her parents Nobutaka (Ryujyu Kobayashi) and Kumiko (Yuri Ogino) are about to divorce. The sweetness and bitterness come together over one weekend spent with the fractured family at a campsite. The emotions come out when people burst into song and dance. A musical about divorce? I don’t think I’ve seen anything like it before but it works. However, it is a title that may prove divisive as Sakurai gives the sort of beyond-her-years performance that some people will be bowled over by while others may find too artificial to take seriously. Also, girls that age don’t act like that. It depends upon your perspective, ultimately. You can read my review here and also a playfulness as music video sequences and cute on-screen text and images are used.\n\nWhile working on the review and interview, three other films by director Imaoka were discovered and two were released: Yome wa, Toriatsukai chuui! Part 1 & 2 and Aoi-chan wa yarasete kurenai. It’s all very impressive and so I wanted to find out more about the background of A Rainbow-colored Trip and how director Imaoka worked with his talented cast, getting some great performances from newbie actress Yuune Sakurai and veteran Yuri Ogino (East of Jefferson and Human Comedy in Tokyo) and also get some insight.\n\nThis interview was done with the help of Takako Pocklington, the talented interpreter who worked on the Reiko and the Dolphin interview and most of my other interviews.\n\nThe Japanese transcript is first and it is followed by English. Click on a link below to be taken to one or the other.\n\nJapanese | English\n\nJapanese\n\nこの映画を作ってくださってありがとうございます。そしてインタビューを受けて下さりありがとうございます。\n\n離婚について描いたミュージカル、というのを今回初めて観たような気がします。監督は、この映画をどういう風に説明されますか？また、映画のアイデアはどこから生まれたのでしょうか？\n\n大人の都合で振り回される子供の無力さを描きたいと思ったのですが、ストレートにやると深刻になりすぎてしまうと思い、ミュージカルの要素を入れて、誰もが楽しめる映画にしたいと思いました。\n\n脚本についてですが、小さいお嬢さんを持つお父さんとしての、ご自身の経験を元にされたりしたのでしょうか？\n\nそうですね。子供は自分の考えていることや感じていることをうまく言葉にできなくて、もどかしい思いをしていると思います。私も子供の考えなど無視して、勝手にことを進めていることがよくあります。\n\nこの映画が大阪アジアン映画祭で上映された1ヵ月後には、『農家の嫁は、取り扱い注意！ Part1 天使降臨篇』と『農家の嫁は、取り扱い注意！ Part 2 有機ある大作戦篇』が、そして2ヵ月後には『葵ちゃんはやらせてくれない』が封切りされました。この映画の撮影期間はどれくらいだったのですか？どのようにこの３本の映画の合間を縫って、撮影されたのでしょうか？\n\n撮影は、2020年の４月１日から４日間ほど、静岡県の富士山麓のキャンプ場で合宿体制で行われました。日本がコロナで最初の緊急事態宣言が発令される直前の撮影でした。自主制作だったので、仕上げ作業に長い時間がかかりました。「農家の嫁」「葵ちゃん」は、この仕上げ作業の間に撮影されました。\n\n劇中の音楽と歌詞をどのように思いついたのか、お話し頂けますか？\n\n歌詞はシナリオライターの宍戸英紀さんに書いてもらいました。主人公の晴花の心情を歌詞にしてほしいと頼みました。音楽は出来上がった歌詞を基にして、音楽の宇波拓さんに作ってもらいました。ジャズの要素を盛り込んでほしいと頼みました。子供の中の大人の部分を表現したかったのです。\n\nキャストについてですが、何故この俳優さんたちを選ばれたのでしょうか？また、ミュージカル部分とドラマ部分での、それぞれの役柄作りを、役者さん達にどのように行われたのでしょう？\n\nまず最初に、晴花役の櫻井佑音さんが決まりました。個人出資の自主制作映画なので、出資された方が、櫻井さんのファンだったということもあり、まず櫻井さん主演の映画ということが決まりました。あとのキャストは、気心の知れた俳優さんに声をかけ出てもらったいう感じです。ミュージカル部分については、曲が出来上がった後、歌や振り付けのレッスンを行いました。ドラマ部分はみんなと話し合って、方向性を決めました。\n\n櫻井佑音さんは、人を惹きつけるオーラのようなものをたくさん持ち合わせ、存在感があります。この個性によって、彼女は主役に抜擢されたと思うのですが、どうやって彼女を発掘されたのですか？\n\n出資された方が櫻井さんのファンだったので、是非とも彼女を主演にしたいという申し出がありました。一度、櫻井さんのコンサートのリハーサルを見に行ったのですが、子供とは思えない、豊かな歌声に魅了されました。櫻井さんが劇中で歌うというのも、そこからの発想でした。\n\n大人の俳優さんと仕事するのに対し、子役さんと仕事をするのはどんな感じでしたか？\n\nなるべく子供扱いしないようにと思いました。大人の俳優さんと同じように演出したつもりです。ただ子供は集中力がないので、芝居に飽きないうちに、なるべく早く撮るように心がけました。\n\nお母さんと娘が話をするシーンにジーンときました。荻野友里さんと櫻井佑音さんによるあのシーンは、晴花が、大人の悲しさ(悲しい事情)を何となく理解するという、映画の中で重要な場面となっています。あのシーンの撮影について、また荻野友里と櫻井佑音さんのリアクションはどんな感じだったのか、聞かせて頂けますか？\n\nテストを繰り返しているうちに、荻野さんは母親に、櫻井さんは娘になりきっていったと思います。何度テストを繰り返しても、お互い涙がボロボロ出てくるのには驚きました。撮影を通じて、櫻井さんも少し大人に近づいていたのかも知れません。\n\n滝の伝説は本当ですか、それともただ単に晴花の気持ちを表すためのものだったのでしょうか？\n\nフィクションです。滝の前に佇んで手を合わすというビジュアルが最初に浮かびました。\n\n『にじいろトリップ』というタイトルの意味を説明して頂けますか？\n\n少女が滝を探すという小さな冒険を通じて、少し大人になるという話です。滝の水しぶきの向こうに虹がかかっているというイメージで「にじいろトリップ」というタイトルにしました。虹は実際撮影では撮れませんでしたが。\n\n観る人に、この映画をどのように感じとって欲しいと思われますか？\n\n誰もが必ず子供だった時期があります。その頃の悔しかった気持ちや楽しかった気持ちを少し思い出してもらえたらと思います。歌あり、踊りあり、涙あり。櫻井さんの魅力がたくさん詰まったこの映画を楽しんでもらえたら嬉しいです。\n\nEnglish\n\nThank you for making the film and for taking part in the interview.\n\nI think this is the first musical about divorce I have ever seen. How would you describe the film and where did they idea come from?\n\nI wanted to portray the powerlessness of children who are wrapped around their parents’ fingers. However, I thought that it would have been too serious if I performed it directly. That is why I used a musical style and made it as entertainment that everyone would enjoy.\n\nIn terms of the script, did you use some of your own experience as the father of a young daughter?\n\nWell…I think children sometimes feel frustrated with not being able to explain their feelings or thoughts well. I do often carry out things while ignoring my children’s thoughts.\n\nThis was screened at OAFF just a month before the release of Nouka no Yome wa, Toriatsukai chuui! Part 1 & 2 and Aoi-chan wa yarasete kurenai. How long was the shoot and how did you fit A Rainbow Coloured-trip in?\n\nWe lodged together for the shoot in a camping site at the foot of Mt. Fuji for four days from 1st April 2020. It was just before the declaration of the first Covid-19 state of emergency. It took quite a while to finish the work because it is an independent film. Nouka no Yome wa, Toriatsukai chuui! Part 2 and Aoi-chan wa yarasete kurenai were shot during this time.\n\nCould you talk more about coming up with the music and lyrics?\n\nThe script-writer Hideki Shishido wrote the lyrics. I asked him to describe the main character Haruka’s feelings. The music was composed by Taku Unami to accompany the lyrics. I asked him to incorporate some essence of Jazz into it as I wanted to express emotional maturity in childhood.\n\nIn terms of the cast, why did you select them and how did you get them into their roles, both for the musical parts and dramatic parts?\n\nYuune Sakurai who played Haruka was cast first. As this film is funded by an individual party, who is a fan of her, it was decided to make a film starring her in a leading role. Then, I asked some actors who I feel familiar with to play other roles in the film. As for the musical parts, they had singing and choreography lessons after the music was composed. For the drama parts, I decided on the acting direction whilst discussing with the staff and actors.\n\nYuune Sakurai has a lot of charisma and a good presence. These qualities make her an engaging lead actress. How did you discover her?\n\nThere was a proposal from a person who funded the film and wanted to cast her as the main character since he is a fan of her. Then, I went to see her at her concert rehearsal. I was fascinated by her mature singing voice which I couldn’t believe because she is still a young child. That is why I had the idea of her singing in the film.\n\nWhat was it like to work with children as opposed to the adults?\n\nI tried not to treat them as children as much as I could. I think I directed them the same way as the adults, but I tried to shoot the scenes as quickly as possible, before they got bored, because children tend to lack concentration.\n\nThe scene where mother and daughter talk to each other was moving. It takes place between Yuri Ogino and Yuune Sakurai and is an important passage in the film where it felt like Haruka could glimpse the sadness of the adults. Could you describe shooting that scene and the reaction of Yuri Ogino and Yuune Sakurai?\n\nWhile we were rehearsing the scene, Ogino-san gradually became a mother while Sakurai-san became a daughter as if they are an actual mother and daughter. I was amazed to see them both keep shedding tears even though we repeated camera tests. Sakurai-san might have moved a little bit into adolescence through the shoot.\n\nWas the legend of the waterfall real or simply a way of displaying Haruka’s mindset？\n\nIt was fictional. I initially got a picture in my head of her putting her hands together in front of the waterfall.\n\nCould you explain the meaning of the title, A Rainbow-Coloured Trip?\n\nIt is a story that a young girl who grows up through her little adventure of finding the waterfall. I made this title from the image of a rainbow behind splashes of the waterfall. Unfortunately, we couldn’t capture any rainbow though.\n\nHow would you like audiences to engage with the film?\n\nEveryone used to be a child once. I hope the film will remind you of the feelings of frustration or happiness when you were young. It contains songs, dances and tears. I would be happy if you can enjoy the film full of the charms of Sakurai-san.\n\nHappy weekend!\n\nHere is the first batch of trailers for films released this weekend.

Alas, Ito refuses to practice and stays silent due to her embarrassment over her country roots and also her melancholy over never having known her mother.

They met when Hara had his first photographic exhibition in Ginza in 1969 with the subject being the pupils at the school he worked at. Their relationship grew quickly from being acquaintances to becoming artistic collaborators with the founding of Shisso production and the making of their first film – with Hara as director and Kobayasi as producer – before culminating in their marriage in 1973.\n\nInfluenced by the social unrest at the time and inspired by New Wave figures such as Shohei Imamura and Nagisa Oshima, Hara and Kobayashi began to explore the lives of the underprivileged and iconoclasts through deeply humanist and challenging documentaries done in cinema vérité style. Their films are a realm where the camera not only documents what is going on but also acts as a tool to render their subject more open to intimate involvement with the filmmakers. The end result is that the “protagonists” expose their private lives in moments that move the film away from any sense of objectivity and moral judgements. Boundaries of various kinds disappear and viewers are left with a document that is quite revealing on both a personal and societal level but also challenging in how we regard the subjects and their position in society.\n\nThe film of Hara and Kobayashi have gone on to be highly regarded around the world with many documentary filmmakers citing them as inspirations. To understand the impact of their works, Japan Society has put together a career-spanning online retrospective that celebrates the 50th Anniversary of the founding of Shisso Productions. This retrospective series includes nearly all of the pair’s films, starting with their first production, Goodbye CP (1972) and culminating in their latest, MINAMATA Mandala (2020).\n\nHighlights include The Emperor’s Naked Army Marches On, which follows a veteran named Kenzo Okuzaki who enlists his wife and some others to join him in a crusade to expose war crimes that took place in World War II; Extreme Private Eros: Love Song 1974 sees Hara turn the camera on his own life and document the fallout of his marriage/divorce with radical feminist, Miyuki Takeda; and the rarely-seen The Many Faces of Chika—the pair’s only narrative feature. Also featured are their most recent works such as Reiwa Uprising, which charts the political fortunes of candidates in a newly established leftist political party, and MINAMATA Mandala, which was shot over 15 years and documents the legal and medical battles endured by the residents of Minamata, a city where some of the populace suffered the infamous neurological disease due to industrial wastewater from a chemical factory causing severe mercury poisoning.\n\nIn order to get a better sense of the season, the curator, K. F. Watanabe, gave an interview.\n\nI first encountered Kazuo Hara’s films via a BBC broadcast of The Emperor’s Naked Army Marches On in the early 2000s. What was your first encounter with the works of Kazuo Hara?\n\nIt was much later than you, in 2014, my first year working at Japan Society. The Emperor’s Naked Army Marches On was included as part of a two-part film series in tribute to the critic Donald Richie, who had just passed away, guest curated by Kyoko Hirano, the former director of the film department at Japan Society for many years. We screened a 16mm print. I was blown away.\n\nDocumentary filmmakers have so many approaches, from observational to participatory. Kazuo Hara and Sachiko Kobayashi’s approach is called “action documentaries.” Can you give an overview of what this is and how its approach?\n\nPat Noonan—who translated Kazuo Hara’s excellent book Camera Obtrusa (2009, Kaya Press) with Takuo Yasuda—describes the approach this way: “[Hara] uses his camera to create a type of ‘action’ that entertains while forcing his subjects to expose societal and historical truths they would rather ignore.” So, it is a type of boundary crossing enabled by the apparatus of the camera that Hara describes as “invading the realm of privacy.” Hara goes on to use the term to distinguish his approach from observational documentary filmmaking as it was practiced by Shinsuke Ogawa: “I try to forcibly generate action with the camera,” he writes, “I try to wrench it into existence. With deliberate force.”\n\nKazuo Hara and Sachiko Kobayashi are given equal billing in this season.\n\nYes, this is important. Kobayashi is integral to all but one of the films as a collaborator and producer—essential and influential roles that are often easy to overlook. The series is also marked by the 50th anniversary of the establishment of their independent production company Shisso Productions, so it is only appropriate to give recognition to its two founders and filmmakers. I must mention that this was especially encouraged to me by my JAPAN CUTS programming colleague Joel Neville Anderson, a PhD who has written about and interviewed Hara and Kobayashi a few times. We had the pleasure of welcoming Hara and Kobayashi to Japan Society to screen their film Sennan Asbestos Disaster at JAPAN CUTS in 2017. Her importance to the production of these films become more apparent to me then, especially during the Q&A. Looking back on the early films such as Goodbye CP and Extreme Private Eros, this becomes very clear.\n\nIn recent years there have been an increasing number of screenings of Hara’s works but this seems like the most comprehensive thus far. Is that the case?\n\nI haven’t looked into it, but I believe so. Many smaller retrospectives and screenings focus on the early films, but this series includes the recent documentaries and even their newest one MINAMATA Mandala, which is just making festival rounds now.\n\nCan you explain Hara and Kobayashi’s impact on documentary filmmaking and their place in the Japanese film world?\n\nI’m not qualified to say with much authority, but they are among the most significant and singular Japanese documentarians in the history the practice, standing among greats such as Noriaki Tsuchimoto and Shunsuke Ogawa in terms of importance while carving out their own unique approach and methodology that has doubtlessly influenced generations of filmmakers. The Emperor’s Naked Army alone is enough to include them in world documentary history books. Today, their documentaries continue to show us parts of Japan we don’t get to see anywhere else.\n\nIn terms of selecting the works, what were your criteria and were there any limitations?\n\nWe were lucky in that nearly all the films were licensed and sourced from only two companies, Janus Films and Shisso Productions, so that made things easier. We wanted to be as complete as possible and I believe this is nearly complete except for My Mishima from 1999, a film they made with Cinema Juku workshop participants, and TV work.\n\nFrom Goodbye CP (1972) to Extreme Private Eros: Love Song (1974) to Reiwa Uprising (2019), this season offers different perspectives on Japanese society.\n\nYes, their career stretches 50 years, so you get to see very different eras of Japan and its politics, society, and counterculture.\n\nWhat do you hope viewers will take away from this season?\n\nAs with everything we organize, I hope viewers can discover something new to them, something that inspires them, something that opens new perspectives and sparks interest in watching more—more Hara/Kobayashi films, more Japanese documentaries, more Japanese films. With this particular retrospective, I hope it brings greater appreciation and understanding of Hara and Kobayashi’s work, especially in what it reveals about and how it relates to our current social and political climate.\n\nHere are links to where you can rent the films:\n\nGoodbye CP Extreme Private Eros: Love Song 1974 The Emperor’s Naked Army Marches On A Dedicated Life The Many Faces of Chika Sennan Asbestos Disaster Reiwa Uprising MINAMATA Mandala\n\nHere are the prices:\n\nRentals: $10 / 20% off members\n\nBundle 1: $30 / 20% off members\n\nIncludes: Goodbye CP, Extreme Private Eros: Love Song 1974, The Emperor’s Naked Army\n\nMarches On, A Dedicated Life and Sennan Asbestos Disaster – Available in the US and\n\nCanada.\n\nBundle 2: $20 / 20% off members\n\nIncludes: The Many Faces of Chika, Reiwa Uprising and Minamata Mandala\n\nHappy Weekend, everyone.\n\nI hope that you are all safe and well.\n\nI’m careening from one thing to another. I started the week writing aboutthe Udine and Cannes film festivals before posting a news article and interview with the curator of a season of documentary films made by Kazuo Hara/Sachiko Kobayashi which are available to stream in North America via Japan Society. I’ll be reviewing these films over the next week. I also posted trailers yesterday.\n\nThis week I watched Assault on Precinct 13, Ronin, and the first half of Psycho-Pass Season 3. I also watched the Hara/Kobayashi films Goodbye CP and Extreme Private Eros: Love Song 1984.\n\nWhat else was released this weekend?\n\nAbout the Pink Sky (Colour Version)\n\nももいろそらを カラー版 「Momoiro Sora Wo Kara- ban」\n\nRelease Date: January 12th 2013 (Japan)\n\nRunning Time: 113 mins.\n\nDirector: Keiichi Kobayashi\n\nWriter: Keiichi Kobayashi\n\nStarring: Ai Ikeda, Ena Koshino, Reiko Fujiwara, Tsubasa Takayama, Hakusyu Togetsuan\n\nWebsite IMDB\n\nKeiichi Kobayashi’s film premiered at the 2011 Tokyo International Film Festival, where it won a major award, and it also screened at last 2012’s Sundance Film Festival and Rotterdam Film Festival.

Through recording those who live differently, their works have shone a light onto points of conflicts based on identity, history, and class, and they reveal the social fault lines that the establishment chooses to ignore. With Goodbye CP, the conflict is between the able-bodied and the disabled.\n\nShot at a tumultuous time of student protests and when disability rights campaigns were taking on long-standing prejudices, and also when public awareness of Minamata disease was high, Goodbye CP was made to be different. While other documentaries might try to curry audience sympathy through depicting their subjects with sentimentality or lionising their struggle to live while disabled, Hara and Kobayashi’s film addresses audiences in a confrontational way in order to shake up views.\n\nShot with a 16mm handheld camera on black-and-white film, Goodbye CP was a collaborative work created with its subjects, an activist group made up of cerebral palsy sufferers led by a poet named Hiroshi Yokota. We watch as he and other members of his group, The Green Lawn Association, battle against public apathy through fundraising, street demonstrations, and poetry readings. There is a sense of rawness and exhibitionism given to proceedings as we follow this fearless group out onto the streets of Tokyo and meet with all of the difficulties that entails. We are also jump cut into interviews with individual members where they explain with directness how they feel shame and discomfort when out in public and also how they are unable to participate in society.\n\nYokota, a particular focus of the film, allows his body to be emblematic of their ostracization. This is seen as he tries to traverse urban terrain while forgoing using a wheelchair despite suffering from severe CP. He allows himself to be filmed dragging himself around Shinjuku amidst huge crowds of people who avoid him, past cars that roar by at close proximity, and off trains that won’t wait for his frail frame to exit. During these sequences the camera is positioned at his height and the soundtrack is full of the din of urban noise so it all feels overwhelming. These techniques translate moments of physical stress. Behind the sensation is an overwhelming awareness of how impractical and limiting urban spaces are for the disabled. As for the public, they are shown through interviews to be, at best, pitying. This may also be the response of viewers watching from the comfort of a cinema or their home but pity alone can be insulting, especially in a society that dehumanises the disabled as we soon learn from the group.\n\nThe interviews with Yokota and others, sometimes done direct to camera, sometimes overlaid on scenes of public gatherings, complicate the subjects and also make them understood on a universal level. We get an insight into their private lives and see them as they go on group trips to the countryside or when one, Koichi Yokozuka, welcomes the birth of his child. We also get testimonies of their first experience with sex. This is a basic human desire that many viewers will relate to in some way, only then to get examples of how the subjects found themselves restricted by society’s boundaries. Some recollections are plaintive, others are amusing, one is disturbing in that a rape took place. They remind us that the people on display are human and this should short-circuit the performative empathy that we may resort to, the thing that allows us to conveniently avoid any deep engagement with others. This convenient escape is stripped away gradually as the images and testimonies make us reflect on how our own behaviour relates to the disabled.\n\nAlso caught on film are moments of defiance from individuals who argue about direction of the project, revealing that the group have some co-authorship of what is happening. While it shows they have agency, it also leads to a particularly moving and rather poignant aspect of the film as we become aware of the deleterious effects that the project is having on Yokota’s family. His wife is fully understanding of his campaign and yet she feels a sense of profound shame over being recorded like exhibits for others to leer at. It is a deeply uncomfortable moment to reckon with as a viewer but one that the filmmakers should be respected for keeping in, even if we feel that some moral boundary has been crossed, for it intensifies the sense that this group are desperate and a film might be their way to push the conversation surrounding disabilities forward.\n\nBy allowing these moments to be filmed, by collapsing the walls between the private and the public and by dragging these issues into the public consciousness and allowing the subjects the chance to express their own opinions, the film creates public ownership over this confrontation between the able-bodied and the disabled and a new way to discuss disability. Hara and Kobayashi capture a multi-faceted picture of their subjects without patronising or oversentamentalising them, by focussing on them and by forcing us to look (subjects are often looking directly at the camera) and by forcing us to listen (the original Japanese screenings didn’t have subtitles). Yokota imparts a sense of despair in an emotionally devastating ending but his efforts and the filmmaking choices of Hara and Kobayashi have the force to make people think.\n\nGoodbye CP plays as part of a season of films made by Kazuo Hara and Sachiko Kobayashi that is available to stream in North America until July 02nd.\n\nExtreme Private Eros: Love Song 1974\n\n極私的エロス 恋歌１９７４ 「Gokushiteki erosu renka 1974」\n\nRelease Date: June 18th 1972\n\nDuration: 98 mins.\n\nDirector: Kazuo Hara\n\nProducer: Sachiko Kobayashi\n\nWriter: N/A\n\nStarring: Miyuki Takeda, Sachiko Kobayashi, Kazuo Hara\n\nIMDB\n\nReleased two years after Goodbye CP, Extreme Private Eros: Love Song 1974 finds Kazuo Hara turning the camera on his own life by filming Miyuki Takeda, a radical feminist, the mother of his son, and his ex-wife. Hara narrates this documentary, which he describes as an attempt to stay connected to Takeda, and films her in intimate situations to work through his unresolved feelings, going so far as to invite his collaborator/girlfriend Sachiko Kobayashi as an actor used to stimulate drama.\n\nOnce again using a handheld camera and black-and-white film, Hara spent periods from 1972 to 1974 documenting Takeda’s life as she moves from Tokyo to Okinawa with their infant son, embarks upon relationships with a woman named Sugako and then a Black American G.I. with whom she gets pregnant, then returns to Tokyo to give birth in Hara’s apartment completely unassisted.\n\nShot chronologically with jump cuts and intertitles to facilitate time/geographical shifts, the camera lingers obsessively on Takeda who describes herself as too tough to elicit much sympathy from others. She is right in that she doesn’t inspire sympathy but, rather, a lot of awe as she strides forth from a background of the student movement and women’s liberation with a tremendous degree of self-confidence and a fierce intelligence. She shows possession of her body and mind as she allows her personal/sexual life to be recorded – indeed, at one point we get a grainy first-person shot of Hara perspective as he is making love to Takeda – and a fearlessness that carries her into different places and situations that across class and regions. Through her exploration, she shows ways of living and femininity that disrupt traditional gender roles as well as giving a taste of the sexual liberation of the time.\n\nHara documents the different environments with enough skill to make each time and place evocative and finds topical focal points via the evolving mindset that Takeda displays with her conversations that expose us to ideas of women’s liberation, communitarianism, and anti-colonialism. The people she converses with, such as hard-bitten go-go dancers, are lively, their personalities and intelligence coming through via impromptu interviews with Takeda and friends. Hara’s camera even acts as a catalyst for tension and revelation rather than just a tool for observation. People respond to it, playing up a persona or awkwardly avoiding being recorded. When his presence exacerbates tensions in Takeda’s relationships, it spurs on drama.\n\nAn interesting section of the film comes in the love triangle that turns into a quadrangle as Hara, jealous of Takeda’s sexual exploration, brings Kobayashi, his then pregnant girlfriend, into the situation. While his jealousy initiates this twist (and Hara has the balls to show himself a crying wreck), the women eventually build bridges and this leads to is an amusing scene where compare notes on Hara and Takeda ruthlessly critiques her ex. Their relationship develops on film leading to Takeda supporting Kobayashi in her own pregnancy via a women’s commune which is a recurring theme in the film, one of reducing male influence and pointing to a female-led future.\n\nThe biggest talking point of the film might be the birthing sequence (shown in full but captured out of focus by a nervous Hara), what is returned to and what the film culminates with is the sense of female unity in environments free from men. Whether it is a lesbian relationship, the support group set up for bar girls in Okinawa, or the women’s commune in Tokyo, Takeda continually tries to establish a positive way of living that defies the way traditional society is set up. It is often positive and it stands in stark opposition to the men who are shown as jealous and manipulative (Hara), exploitative (the G.I.s looking for an easy lay and gangsters who harass Takeda and Hara) and, ultimately, the patriarchal power structures that exploit women.\n\nOnce the film was over it was easy to see why this “self-documentary” was created because Takeda is an inspiration. From the first moments when still photographs show her as an artist, wife, mother, and in the nude, to seeing her in motion and in argumentative form, she is a larger than life presence who is the centre of gravitational pull whenever she is on screen. She demonstrates a set of personal politics that evolves over the course of the film that offer an alternative vision to Japan’s conservatism, something directly challenging social mores and restrictions faced by women, revealing it through the universal lens of sex and the libertarian attitudes to it at the time. It culminates with Takeda giving birth on screen as she takes control of her own body and brings another life into the world with all the hope of change that must have been felt at the time by herself and others. The confidence with which she does it all is infectious and makes her a notable character in cinema.\n\nExtreme Private Eros: Love Song 1974 plays as part of a season of films made by Kazuo Hara and Sachiko Kobayashi that is available to stream in North America until July 02nd.\n\nThis is the first in a three-part trailer post because 18 films have been released this weekend.\n\nIto\n\nいとみち 「Itomichi」\n\nRelease Date: June 25th, 2021\n\nDuration: 92 mins.\n\nDirector: Satoko Yokohama\n\nWriter: Satoko Yokohama (Script), Osamu Koshigaya (Original Novel)\n\nStarring: Ren Komai, Etsushi Toyokawa, Mei Kurokawa, Yoko Nishikawa, Mayuu Yokota, Ayumu Nakajima, Daimaou Kosaka, Shohei Uno,\n\nWebsite IMDB OAFF\n\nWinner of the Grand Prix and Audience Award at the Osaka Asian Film Festival 2021, Ito is the first solo feature film from director Satoko Yokohama since her 2015 drama The Actor. Her cinematic return is set in Aomori Prefecture, the birthplace of Yokohama and also of the film’s lead actress Ren Komai.\n\nI saw this as part of the Osaka Asian Film Festival earlier this year. I found it a charming film. You can read my review here and my interview with the director, Satoko Yokohama, here.\n\nSynopsis: High schooler Ito Soma (Ren Komai) is a gangly girl who hails from Itayanagi, a small town outside Hirosaki city. She has a timid nature and a thick Tsugaru accent which makes her sound a bit like a hick. However, far from being a hayseed, Ito is very knowledgeable about her local culture and dialect and she can also play the shamisen, a three-stringed instrument that is particularly popular in Aomori. This skill is something she picked up from her grandmother (Yoko Nishikawa) and a massive part of the few memories she holds of her late mother, a talented shamisen player in her own right. Alas, Ito refuses to practice and stays silent due to her embarrassment over her country roots and also her melancholy over never having known her mother. However, it is through fully embracing these factors that Ito can eventually unlock her ability to express herself.

It derives its power from its subject, a World War II veteran and political agitator named Kenzo Okuzaki who is on a quest to expose war crime as well as hold Emperor Hirohito, the military, and the establishment to account. The idea of a documentary about him was first envisaged by Shohei Imamura but due to the refusal of television companies to touch the subject, it fell to Kazuo Hara and Sachiko Kobayashi to film it.\n\nOkuzaki is quite a character to follow. Within the opening five minutes we learn he is an anti-authoritarian who served jail time for murder, for hurling pachinko balls at the Emperor, and for distributing flyers featuring pornographic images of the Emperor around Tokyo. While he has always been an anti-authoritarian (he’d rumble with his officers while in the army), that jail time (including 10 years in solitary!) led to a mean moralistic streak that has enhanced his fighting capabilities. He shows no signs of slowing down at the age of 62, which is when we join him, as he sidelines his plot to assassinate an ex-prime minister to search for the truth of a dark chapter in his past.\n\nDuring World War II, he was in the 36th Regiment of Independent Engineers which was stationed in New Guinea. Towards the end of the war, good fortune saw him captured by Allied forces while the rest of his fellow soldiers who continued to fight were forced to retreat into a small area and were almost completely cut off from food and water. At a time when soldiers were suffering from starvation there were dubious “executions” including those of privates Tetsunosuke Yoshizawa and Jinpei Nomura. Indeed, they were shot 23 days after the Emperor gave his radio address announcing that the war was over.\n\nOkuzaki wants to find out the truth behind the murders and so with Kazuo Hara and a documentary film crew in tow he shuttles from his home in Kobe to various places the length of Honshuu. From Hyogo Prefecture to Hiroshima, Tokyo to Saitama, he tracks down and interviews all who were involved in the killings. What he gets are excuses, equivocations and elusiveness as the former soldiers lie and demonstrate a convenient collective amnesia that allows them to dodge responsibility. Lines like, “it was a military order. Orders always came first”, and, “for the sake of these souls, we shouldn’t dig up the past”, are uttered which infuriates Okuzaki who, through dogged unearths evidence of cannibalism.\n\nOkuzaki’s rebelliousness and violence hovers over each interview and with the truth just out of grasp he resorts to bizarre tactics such as hiring actors and inflicting violence on the interviewees, meanwhile the camera crew continues recording everything. Watching men in their sixties fight each other in bursts of violence is alarming and Hara emphasises the sense of shock with moments of slow motion as Okuzaki moves to judo his targets. It seems immoral and yet, as the awful details of the crimes committed come to light, audience members may find themselves willing Okuzaki getting confessions out of men bound to the more socially acceptable action of forgetting and parroting a sanitised version of events.\n\nMoral quandaries emerge over how the filmmakers become part of the action as the tension mounts, Hara being forced to step in front of the camera to caution Okuzaki who shows the degree of his mania and need for control by trying to direct the crew. Okuzaki clearly uses the camera crew to get into people’s lives and the camera crew use him for material but it is fascinating watching how the presence of the camera goads people on to more extremes or inhibits them from confessing scenes.\n\nWhat stands out more is how Okuzaki’s irreverent attitude to authority allows things descend into slapstick, bouts of wrestling coming amid formal Japanese greetings and reticence. The camera records everything without bias and so the absurdity comes out naturally. Seeing the reactions of families and nonplussed police officers standing around scuffles equally comes off as amusing as they ask for Okuzaki to stop. In truth, as funny as Okuzaki is to watch, his domineering behaviour points to a disturbing level of violence.\n\nShizumi, Okuzaki’s wife, soon emerges as a hero by demonstrating how she puts up with her husband’s actions with the patience of a saint. More importantly Hara, through Okuzaki, shows that the Japanese character is not the quiet and calm stereotype and he has exposed some uncomfortable truths that the Japanese state would rather forget with regards to the way the military brutalised and cannibalised its own people and others. It’s a really compelling mixture of contradictory elements that makes the film an absolutely gripping watch!\n\nThe Emperor’s Naked Army Marches On is a powerful film about violence and obsession. Although the film was recorded over a number of years, the filmmakers chart Okuzaki’s behaviour with intelligent editing to create a focused narrative full of smart staging and interactions to make it as visceral as possible. Both the filmmakers and Okuzaki root out the truth from a horrific episode in Japan’s past and pose difficult questions for the audience watching their work, forcing people to fully confront the horrors of war. Their work will always be relevant because armed conflicts, unthinking obedience, and blind nationalism are ever present threats for humanity.\n\nThe Emperor’s Naked Army plays as part of a season of films made by Kazuo Hara and Sachiko Kobayashi that is available to stream in North America until July 02nd.\n\nThis is a rewrite of a review from a couple of years ago.\n\nThis is the second of this weekend’s trailer posts. One went up yesterday and the other will go up tomorrow.\n\nWhat was released this weekend???\n\nKAWASAKI BRAVE THUNDERS 2020-21 SEASON OFFICIAL DOCUMENTARY “OVER TIME” Conflict, Joy, and Gratitude.\n\nKAWASAKI BRAVE THUNDERS 2020-21 SEASON OFFICIAL DOCUMENTARY “OVER TIME” 葛藤と、歓喜と、感謝と 「KAWASAKI BRAVE THUNDERS 2020-21 SEASON OFFICIAL DOCUMENTARY “OVER TIME” kattou to, kanki to, kansha to.。」\n\nRelease Date: July 25th, 2021\n\nDuration: 87 mins.\n\nDirector: Shusuke Fukada\n\nWriter: N/A\n\nStarring: N/A\n\nWebsite\n\nSynopsis: The Kawasaki Brave Thunder basketball team get another documentary, this one culled from 400 hours of footage that shows them in action in the B.League professional basketball league.
