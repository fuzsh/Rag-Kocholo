        "text": "With the future lying in the hands of our children, we teachers must revolutionize the way we think.\n\nKyomeikan Private High School has been deemed an “unprofitable business” by the company that runs it. Students score on the lower end of the national average range and are not particularly known to be strong in sports. With barely enough students to meet the minimum requirement to continue operating, Kyomeikan is a safety school for kids who didn’t get in to their first and second choices.\n\nOne man is tasked with revitalizing the school’s operations. Thirty-five-year-old Narumi Ryosuke (Sakurai Sho) is an elite corporate employee at Kashimatsu Bussan Co., Ltd., a large general trading company. He is suddenly assigned to the role of high school principal despite not having any experience as an educator. The realities of the academic world are so different from the rules in business that his days are filled with confusion.\n\nListen up, housewives! The cutest yet most dangerous heroine the world has ever seen comes to your rescue!\n\nThose who dream of becoming a fabulous yet low-key housewife would envy thirty-year-old Isayama Nami (Ayase Haruka). After a tainted past, she decides to reinvent herself and live a quiet life. She marries Yuki (Nishijima Hidetoshi), a man she met at a dating party and moves to an upscale neighborhood. Things are smooth-sailing and she has everything she needs. Or so it seems.\n\nOnly six months into her marriage and Nami is already full of struggles. She’s a terrible cook–the mere act of slicing a cabbage ends up in failure and the dressing she makes from scratch turns out horribly. These days, her husband prefers to eat out. But what gets to her the most is how simple and boring her days are. She supposedly dreamed of a “normal family life,” but it doesn’t take long to realize that it’s not enough for her.\n\nOne day, she suddenly realizes that all the seemingly-happy housewives around her are actually carrying their own burdens.\n\nNami makes a vow: “I’ll rescue them!”\n\nNami is a disaster when it comes to cooking, cleaning, and housework in general, but she is a champion of justice who becomes incredibly dangerous when angry. She despises bad behavior and can’t turn a blind eye to evil people! Why does she suddenly have a need for thrill? The reason lies in her past, which she keeps hidden even to her husband.\n\nBorn and raised an orphan, Nami has had to toughen up to make it through a life devoid of love. Her first taste of kindness and warmth comes from her husband and her housewife friends. After growing up so unique that she doesn’t know what “normal” is, just how will she solve the many problems of the other ladies?! Packed with laughter and action, this drama sends love and encouragement to all the women out there who live life to the fullest!\n\nBased on the popular novel by Ikeido Jun and starring Yakusho Koji, Rikuou tells the dramatic story of a long-established tabi (Japanese rubber-soled socks) manufacturer taking a big gamble and making running shoes, in a desperate bid to survive.\n\nMiyazawa Koichi (Yakusho Koji) is the fourth-generation president of tabi manufacturing company “Kohazeya,” located in Gyoda in Saitama Prefecture. He is increasingly distressed by worsening cash-flow problems, caused by decreasing demand for tabi. His son Daichi (Yamazaki Kento) is applying for jobs while helping out with the family business, but the search hasn’t been going well. One day, with the advice from their bank’s loan officer, Sakamoto (Kazama Shunsuke), Miyazawa comes up with the idea of using tabi-making technology to develop super-light, almost-like-being-barefoot running shoes. His tiny, regional company with only about 20 employees has limited funds, human resources, and development capabilities, much less a shot at beating the world-famous sports brand “Atlantis.” But Miyazawa is determined, and goes to see the Toyohashi International Marathon tournament with Daichi to learn more about running.\n\nKoizumi Kyoko stars in a TBS drama for the first time in 16 years, since “How Long Since You’ve Loved?”. A group of middle-aged women attempted to abduct a handsome CEO. The show tackles deep themes such as the meaning of life and the source of happiness, at times with a comedic touch and at others with a more serious tone.\n\nThe story begins with five women – Kayo (Koizumi Kyoko), Futaba (Mitsushima Hikari), Yoko (Sakai Maki), Akemi (Morishita Aiko) and Chinatsu (Kanno Miho) – plotting to abduct Itabashi (Iseya Yusuke), the handsome CEO of a major company. Although their motive is unknown at first, it is eventually revealed that Itabashi had killed his mistress. The women wanted to kidnap Itabashi, expose him, and clear the false charges against Shinobu (Kaho), the imprisoned daughter of the former CEO. The women first met 6 years ago, at a women’s prison. Kayo, Yoko, Akemi, Shinobu, and Chinatsu were all serving time for various crimes, and Futaba was the strict prison officer and instructor who watched over them."
