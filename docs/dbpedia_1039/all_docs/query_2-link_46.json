        "text": "Hello dear readers!\n\nI hope everyone had a great Halloween. This week, I watched a few horror/supernatural films. I saw Ghostbusters at my local cinema and had a blast. Seeing Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and the gang on the big screen was awesome an it lived up to my expectations. I think I’ll review it. I also watched The Beast Must Die, an old Amicus production from the ‘70s.\n\nI started the week with a post about the guests who will appear at the East Winds Film Festival and then I posted my annual Halloween review for POV: A Cursed Film which I found to be a lot of fun and worth watching.\n\nOkay, so we’re going into the next couple of months with reviews aplenty. Big reviews. I’m going to continue with the trend of one a week.\n\n“Just look at her and tell me the world isn’t going to change.”\n\nWhat’s released in Tokyo cinemas this weekend?\n\nSofuten!\n\nJapanese: ソフテン!\n\nRomaji: Sofuten\n\nRelease Date: October 31st, 2014 (Japan)\n\nRunning Time: 84 mins.\n\nDirector: Yasunari Izuma\n\nWriter: Yusei Naruse (Screenplay), Mina Itaba (Original Manga)\n\nStarring: KANON (Kanon Tsuyama), Aika Oota, Mirei Tanaka, MIINA, Rio Sugawara, Mai Okamoto, Yui Masaki, Karin, Nanami Koyama, Saki Shishima, Dankan,\n\nGirls from HKT48, SUPER ☆ GiRLS star in an adaptation of a manga from 2010 about a bunch of girls ranging from Yankees and fujoshi to more “gluttonous” ones who join the school softball team which is run by a janitor.\n\nDankan, I don’t really know all that much about him but I enjoyed watching him in Getting Any? and Eyes of the Spider. He was also in Noroi: The Curse.\n\nWebsite\n\nBay Blues: 25 Years and 364 Days\n\nJapanese: ベイブルース 25歳と364日\n\nRomaji: Bei Buru-su 25-sai to 364-nichi\n\nRelease Date: October 31st, 2014 (Japan)\n\nRunning Time: 120 mins.\n\nDirector: Tomohiro Takayama\n\nWriter: Takeshi Kaneda (Screenplay), Tomohiro Takayama (Original Story)\n\nStarring: Tamiyasu Cho, Shozo Endo, Natsumi Ogawa, Shigeru Minmide, Iihwa, Eri Ishida, Yuta Kajiwara,\n\nEitoku Kawamoto was a rising-star of the comedy world before he died at the age of twenty-five.

I’ve read nothing but good things so I’m looking forward to watching it at some point. Here’s the UK trailer and the Japanese trailer.\n\nNami’s childhood was brutal: her mother ran away to Sri Lanka to help poor kids, her sister skipped town with her boyfriend and her father descended into despair and got himself a gothic mistress who played on this. Now that she’s grown up she takes pleasure in spying on people, watching loners in society and enjoying seeing their pain. Seeing one old man’s misery gives her more pleasure than most other but when Christian missionaries offer him happiness, well, Nami has to step in.\n\nWebsite\n\nClover\n\nJapanese Title: クローバー\n\nRomaji: Kuro-ba-\n\nRelease Date: November 01st, 2014 (Japan)\n\nRunning Time: 120 mins.\n\nDirector: Takeshi Furusawa\n\nWriter: Taeko Asano (Screenplay), Toriko Chiya (Original Manga),\n\nStarring: Emi Takei, Tadayoshi Okura, Kento Nagayama, Natsuna Watanabe, Yusuke Kamiji Kai Shishido, Rie Shibata, Yasuko Mitsuura, Erena Mizusawa,\n\nTakeshi Furusawa… That’s the director. I know I’ve written about him before but what was it about… THAT AWFUL J-horror, Ghost Train (2006)! He was Kiyoshi Kurosawa’s AD on the far superior Kairo (2000). So he’s stuck in the land of manga and novel adaptations and he’s doing shoujo… What’s it about?\n\nShy girl Saya Suzuki (Takei) works at a hotel as an OL and has a crush on her boss Susumu (Okura). As romance blossoms, Saya becomes a stronger person.\n\nWebsite\n\nAkane Kurarinetto\n\nJapanese Title: 茜色クラリネット\n\nRomaji: Akane Kurarinetto\n\nRelease Date: November 01st, 2014 (Japan)\n\nRunning Time: 81 mins.\n\nDirector: Yuno Sakamoto\n\nWriter: Yuki Shimazaki (Screenplay),\n\nStarring: Sato Kaedeko, Rina Sato, Yuki Morita, Chie Ohashi, Risa Kumaki, Ayumu Saito, Tsuyoshi Sato,\n\nThis film is just like my life! I used to be in my high school orchestra and I played the clarinet. I never had any near death experiences, though. And no scary looking bear appeared either. This was made as part of a workshop involving unior high school students in Sapporo. Yuko Sakamoto is actually a high schooler but was tutored in the art of directing by Masato Sakai and Wataru Hayakawa.\n\nAkane (Kaedeko Sato) is a junior high school student who has a friend in a coma. She discovers a book that allows her to enter another plane of existence… She enters a dream world and sees the unconscious world of her friend but as she starts doing this, a strange disease hits her town and begins to affect the children…\n\nWebsite\n\nTori no Michi wo Koete\n\nJapanese Title: 鳥の道を越えて\n\nRomaji: Tori no Michi wo Koete\n\nRelease Date: November 01st, 2014 (Japan)\n\nRunning Time: 93 mins.\n\nDirector: Yuki Imai\n\nWriter: N/A\n\nStarring: N/A\n\nYuki Imai travels to the Tono region of Gifu prefecture to track a man and his grandson who keep track of migratory birds in the area and what the nature of their situation is.\n\nWebsite\n\nNatsu zen Owari\n\nJapanese Title: 夏前。 おわり\n\nRomaji: Natsu zen Owari\n\nRelease Date: November 01st, 2014 (Japan)\n\nRunning Time: 81 mins.\n\nDirector: Yuki Sasaki\n\nWriter: Yuki Sasaki (Screenplay),\n\nStarring: Yuko Kageyama, Takuma Watanabe, Atsushi Hijiri, Marie Ono, Susume Katayama, Ayaka Komatsu, Natsuki Seki,\n\nThis is another Enbu Seminar films, a series of titles that allow young filmmakers to get experience in making professional productions.

It has a bunch of extras from the country. It looks like it is about an old man who wants to bury his wife, the love of his life. Apparently, the music of The Back Horn.is appropriate. I’ll stick to Tricot and shoe gazey stuff like The Florist. And Touhou vocals.\n\nWebsite\n\nIgnorance of Knowledge\n\nJapanese Title: 無知の知\n\nRomaji: Muchi no Chi\n\nRelease Date: November 01st, 2014 (Japan)\n\nRunning Time: 107 mins.\n\nDirector: Choya Ishida\n\nWriter: N/A (Screenplay),\n\nStarring: Yukio Edano Tetsuro Fukuyama, Naoto Kan, Kenichi Shimomura, Tetsuo Sawada, Kaoru Yosano,\n\nIn this 3/11 documentary we see former government ministers interviewed about their response to the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Fukushima Daiichi disaster.

What’s this about? A series of environmental disasters strike the Earth in the not too distant future and a few pockets of humanity hold out. One such community founded a town at a hot spring in Japan and managed to survive but the discovery of a mobile phone from the ancient past heralds the start of chaos.\n\nWebsite\n\nAnd that’s it. No more dodgy translations for this week."
