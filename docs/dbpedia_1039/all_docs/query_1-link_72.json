        "text": "Japanese Movie 2019\n\n4-gatsu no Kimi, Spica (Japanese Drama Review & Summary)\n\nGenre: Romance, Love Triangle, Misunderstanding, Live-Action Manga\n\nRelease Date: 2019\n\nOrigin: Japan, Adapted from a Manga\n\nFilm: 1 hr 39 minutes\n\nCast\n\nFukuhara Haruka as Sei Saotome\n\nSato Taiki as Udagawa Taiyo\n\nSuzuki Jin as Otaka Mizuki\n\nOtani Ryohei as [Kobaiâ€™s uncle]\n\nOhana Yuno as Tachibana Kaede\n\nThis is a very interesting story about a shy girl who transferred to another school.\n\nShe felt so embarrassed when she got the lowest score in their math test at 15/100.\n\nWhile she was looking at her test paper, it got blown away and landed on the feet of Taiyo, who picked it up and laughed at it.\n\nHer schoolmates sniggered that she made the average of the class go down in ranking among other sections of their year.\n\nTaiyo raised his hand and said that he will study for the next exam and their ranking should go up.\n\nShe was in the school corridor looking at the sky. She was talking to the white star in the sky, asking it what she should call it.\n\nA boy behind her asked if she was interested in astronomy. Then before she could answer, he was unzipping his telescope (is it me this sounded rather rude? ðŸ™‚ lol) and showing her stars.\n\nHe pointed to the star that she was looking at and told her the name of it was Spica. He added that it was the star that he loved the most. This boy was Mizuki, best friend of Taiyo.\n\nAt seventeen, Sei fell in love with the gorgeous Mizuki.\n\nMizuki asked her to join the astronomy club, though there is only other one member which was Taiyo.\n\nBy coincidence, their names correspond to heavenly bodies. Mizuki is moon, Taiyo is sun and Sei is star.\n\nTaiyo was very gregarious and made Mizuki their gopher and cleaner to punish her for her impure thoughts about Mizuki.\n\nSei complained that she does not have impure thoughts but she does like Mizuki.\n\nMizuki and Taiyo were considered a heavenly pair at school. Sei being with the boys made her the target of jealous girls.\n\nMizuki and Taiyo, however, protected her.\n\nOne day, Sei found Mizuki alone in the school roof. She canâ€™t help herself and confess to him.\n\nMizuki was surprised and did not know what to say and became rather aloof.\n\nSei ran off in embarrassment straight to the arms of Taiyo who was so annoyed with Mizuki.\n\nTaiyo had developed feelings for Sei so to comfort her, he kissed her.\n\nSei was shocked because she had just confessed her feelings to Mizuki.\n\nAnyway, Sei suddenly saw Taiyo in a different light and he really started pursuing her.\n\nHe talked about Spica and its darling star the Arcturus. He said that Arcturus and Spica were sky lovers and would meet every 60,000.\n\nSei asked what if Spica or even Arcturus met someone else before they get to one another.\n\nTaiyo said it can happen but Spica and Arcturus are fated.\n\nThey were getting on like a house on fire and started dating when a girl from both Taiyo and Mizukiâ€™s past appeared.\n\nShe was Amakawi Saki.\n\nSaki was Taiyoâ€™s girlfriend. He adored her but one day he found her and Mizuki sharing a kiss.\n\nTaiyo was so upset.\n\nMizuki said that Saki kissed him and not the other way around.\n\nTaiyo canâ€™t forgive Saki for cheating on him and while they were arguing Saki collapsed.\n\nSaki had heart problem.\n\nNow she was back and Taiyo had to be tender with her as she might have another attack.\n\nSei was now being told by the girls who were initially bullying her to get her man. They said that they might not like Sei but she was more tolerable than the stunning Saki.\n\nAnyway, Mizuki was so annoyed with Taiyo for ignoring Sei. He told Taiyo that he had always wanted Sei, it was just he canâ€™t express his feelings.\n\nTaiyo finally realised that he canâ€™t afford to lose Sei to Mizuki.\n\nSo between him and Mizuki, they arranged to have a swimming contest. The one who wins will get Sei.\n\nThe boys had their contest. Sei went to the pool to find Sei but it was Mizuki who was there.\n\nMizuki said that he knew she would come and she would say that it was Sei she wanted. He said he likes her but Taiyo was his best friend so he will support them both. Mizuki told Sei that Taiyo left a message for her to meet him at the observatory.\n\nShe ran there as fast as she could.\n\nAnd then he found her,\n\nThey made up and lie there on the ground trying to watch falling meteors."
