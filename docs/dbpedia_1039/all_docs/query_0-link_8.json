We are working toward that goal through the development of SrI 2 (Eu) scintillator detectors, which routinely provide ;10 cm 3 . In this study, we have tested pure, undoped SrI 2 to gain a better understanding of the scintillation properties and spectroscopic performance achievable without activation. An undoped crystal grown from 99.999% pure SrI 2 pellets was tested for its spectroscopic performance, its light yield, and uniformity of scintillation light collection as a function of gamma-ray interaction position relative to the crystal growth direction. Undoped SrI 2 was found to provide energy resolution of 5.3% at 662 keV, and the light collection nonuniformity varied by only 0.72% over the length of the crystal. Measurements of both a 3% Eu-doped and the undoped SrI 2 crystal were carried out in the SLYNCI facility and indicate differences in their light yield non-proportionality. The surprisingly good scintillation properties of the pure SrI 2 crystal suggests that with high-purity feedstock, further reduction of the Eu concentration can be made to grow larger crystals while not adversely impacting the spectroscopic performance.\n\nCrystal Growth and Scintillation Properties of Eu2+ doped Cs4CaI6 and Cs4SrI6\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nStand, L.; Zhuravleva, M.; Chakoumakos, B.; Johnson, J.; Loyd, M.; Wu, Y.; Koschan, M.; Melcher, C. L.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nIn this work we present the crystal growth and scintillation properties of two new ternarymetal halide scintillators activated with divalent europium, Cs4CaI6 and Cs4SrI6. Single crystals of each compound were grown in evacuated quartz ampoules via the vertical Bridgman technique using a two-zone transparent furnace. Single crystal X-ray diffraction experiments showed that both crystals have a trigonal (R-3c) structure, with a density of 3.99 g/cm3 and 4.03 g/cm3. The radioluminescence and photoluminescence measurements showed typical luminescence properties due to the 5d-4f radiative transitions in Eu2+. At this early stage of development Cs4SrI6:Eu and Cs4CaI6:Eu have shown very promising scintillation properties, with light yields and energy resolutions of 62,300 ph/MeV and 3.3%, and 51,800 photons/MeV and 3.6% at 662 keV, respectively.\n\nEffects of packaging SrI{sub 2}(Eu) scintillator crystals\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nSturm, Benjamin W., E-mail: sturm1@llnl.gov [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA 94550 (United States); Cherepy, Nerine J.; Drury, Owen B.; Thelin, Peter A.; Fisher, Scott E.; Payne, Stephen A.

[Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 (United States); Shah, Kanai S.; Hawrami, Rastgo [Radiation Monitoring Devices, Watertown, MA 02472 (United States)\n\n2011-10-01\n\nRecent renewed emphasis placed on gamma-ray detectors for national security purposes has motivated researchers to identify and develop new scintillator materials capable of high energy resolution and growable to large sizes. We have discovered that SrI{sub 2}(Eu) has many desirable properties for gamma-ray detection and spectroscopy, including high light yield of {approx}90,000 photons/MeV and excellent light yield proportionality. We have measured <2.7% FWHM at 662 keV with small detectors (<1 cm{sup 3}) in direct contact with a photomultiplier tube, and {approx}3% resolution at 662 keV is obtained for 1 in.{sup 3} crystals. Due to the hygroscopic nature of SrI{sub 2}(Eu), similar to NaI(Tl), proper packaging is required for field use. This work describes a systematic study performed to determine the key factors in the packaging process to optimize performance. These factors include proper polishing of the surface, the geometry of the crystal, reflector materials and windows. A technique based on use of a collimated {sup 137}Cs source was developed to examine light collection uniformity. Employing this technique, we found that when the crystal is packaged properly, the variation in the pulse height at 662 keV from events near the bottom of the crystal compared to those near the top of the crystal could be reduced to <1%. This paper describes the design and engineering of our detector package in order to improve energy resolution of 1 in.{sup 3}-scale SrI{sub 2}(Eu) crystals.\n\nCrystal growth and scintillation properties of Pr-doped SrI2 single crystals\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nYokota, Yuui; Ito, Tomoki; Yoshino, Masao; Yamaji, Akihiro; Ohashi, Yuji; Kurosawa, Shunsuke; Kamada, Kei; Yoshikawa, Akira\n\n2018-04-01\n\nPr-doped SrI2 (Pr:SrI2) single crystals with various Pr concentrations were grown by the halide-micro-pulling-down (H-Î¼-PD) method, and the scintillation properties were investigated. Pr1%:SrI2 single crystal with high transparency could be grown by the H-Î¼-PD method while Pr2, 3 and 5%:SrI2 single crystals included some cracks and opaque parts. In the photoluminescence spectrum of the Pr1%:SrI2 single crystal, an emission peak originated from the Pr3+ ion was observed around 435 nm while the radioluminescence spectra showed an emission peak around 535 nm for the undoped SrI2 and Pr:SrI2 single crystals. Light yields of Pr1, 2, 3 and 5%:SrI2 single crystals under Î³-ray irradiation were 7700, 8700, 7200 and 6700 photons/MeV, respectively. Decay times of Pr1 and 2%:SrI2 single crystals under Î³-ray irradiation were 55.9 and 35.0 ns of the fast decay component, and 435 and 408 ns of the slow decay component, respectively.\n\nDefect Engineering by Codoping in KCaI3 :Eu2 + Single-Crystalline Scintillators\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWu, Yuntao; Li, Qi; Jones, Steven; Dun, Chaochao; Hu, Sheng; Zhuravleva, Mariya; Lindsey, Adam C.; Stand, Luis; Loyd, Matthew; Koschan, Merry; Auxier, John; Hall, Howard L.; Melcher, Charles L.\n\n2017-09-01\n\nEu2 + -doped alkali or alkali earth iodide scintillators with energy resolutions â¤3 % at 662 keV promise the excellent discrimination ability for radioactive isotopes required for homeland-security and nuclear-nonproliferation applications. To extend their applications to x-ray imaging, such as computed tomography scans, the intense afterglow which delays the response time of such materials is an obstacle that needs to be overcome. However, a clear understanding of the origin of the afterglow and feasible solutions is still lacking. In this work, we present a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of the physical insights of codoping-based defect engineering which can reduce the afterglow effectively in KCaI3:Eu2 + single-crystal scintillators. We illustrate that Sc3 + codoping greatly suppresses the afterglow, whereas Y3 + , Gd3 + , or La3 + codoping enhances the afterglow. Meanwhile, a light yield of 57 000 photons / MeV and an energy resolution of 3.4% at 662 keV can be maintained with the appropriate concentration of Sc3 + codoping, which makes the material promising for medical-imaging applications. Through our thermoluminescence techniques and density-functional-theory calculations, we are able to identify the defect structures and understand the mechanism by which codoping affects the scintillation performance of KCaI3:Eu2 + crystals. The proposed defect-engineering strategy is further validated by achieving afterglow suppression in Mg2 + codoped KCaI3:Eu2 + single crystals.\n\nLiquid scintillation spectrometer survey 155Eu liquid activity\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nZhang Zuhua\n\n2002-01-01\n\nIn the countrywide contrasting survey of 155 Eu activity, 155 Eu liquid activity was determined for the first time through using liquid scintillation spectrometer survey 155 Eu Î² ray.

A proof-of-principle detector was designed for flowing tritium-spiked nitrogen gas across the surface of a thin scintillator, which was optically coupled between two low-noise photomultiplier tubes. Electronics for operating the two photomultiplier tubes in coincidence eliminated most of the tube noise pulses and allowed detection of the small pulses from the low-energy tritium beta particles\n\nPlastic scintillators with Î²-diketone Eu complexes for high ionizing radiation detection\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAdadurov, A.F.; Zhmurin, P.N.; Lebedev, V.N.; Kovalenko, V.N.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nLuminescent and scintillation properties of polystyrene-based plastic scintillators with Î²-diketone Eu complexes are investigated.

The tile/fiber system uses a wavelength shifting fiber to read out the signal of a scintillating plate (tile) and a clear fiber to transmit the signal to a phototube. In the SDC calorimeter design, four of tile/fiber systems are grouped as a 2 x 2 tile package so that the gap width between and the location of the tiles in the absorber slot can be controlled. Optical properties of the tile package such as the light yield, its uniformity, and cross talk were measured in a test bench with a Î²-ray source and in a 2-GeV/c Ï + test beam. The performance as an electromagnetic calorimeter was evaluated by a GEANT simulation using the measured response map. We discuss a method of correction for the calorimeter non-uniformity.

For current scintillators on the market, there is an inverse relationship between scintillator energy resolution and cost of production. A new promising scintillator, KSr 2 I 5 :Eu 2+ , under development at the University of Tennessee, has achieved an energy resolution of 2.4% at 662 keV at room temperature, with potential growth rates exceeding several millimeters per hour. However, the internal background due to the 40 K content could present a hurdle for effective source detection/identification in nuclear security applications. As a first step in addressing this question, this paper reports on a computational investigation of the intrinsic differential pulse height spectrum (DPHS) generated by 40 K within the KSr 2 I 5 :Eu 2+ scintillator as a function of crystal geometry. It was found that the DPHS remains relatively equal to a constant multiplicative factor of the negatron emission spectrum with a direct increase of the 1.46 MeV photopeak relative height to the negatron spectrum with volume. Further, peak pileup does not readily manifest itself for practical KSr 2 I 5 :Eu 2+ volumes.\n\nStudy of formation of deep trapping mechanism by UV, beta and gamma irradiated Eu(3+) activated SrY2O4 and Y4Al2O9 phosphors.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDubey, Vikas; Kaur, Jagjeet; Parganiha, Yogita; Suryanarayana, N S; Murthy, K V R\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThis paper reports the thermoluminescence properties of Eu(3+) doped different host matrix phosphors (SrY2O4 and Y4Al2O9). The phosphor is prepared by high temperature solid state reaction method. The method is suitable for large scale production and fixed concentration of boric acid using as a flux. The prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction technique and the crystallite size calculated by Scherer's formula. The prepared phosphor characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopic (SEM), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), thermoluminescence (TL) and Transmission Electron Microscopic (TEM) techniques. The prepared phosphors for different concentration of Eu(3+) ions were examined by TL glow curve for UV, beta and gamma irradiation. The UV 254nm source used for UV irradiation, Sr(90) source was used for beta irradiation and Co(60) source used for gamma irradiation. SrY2O4:Eu(3+)and Y4Al2O9:Eu(3+) phosphors which shows both higher temperature peaks and lower temperature peaks for UV, beta and gamma irradiation. Here UV irradiated sample shows the formation of shallow trap (surface trapping) and the gamma irradiated sample shows the formation of deep trapping. The estimation of trap formation was evaluated by knowledge of trapping parameters. The trapping parameters such as activation energy, order of kinetics and frequency factor were calculated by peak shape method. Here most of the peak shows second order of kinetics. The effect of gamma, beta and UV exposure on TL studies was also examined and it shows linear response with dose which indicate that the samples may be useful for TL dosimetry. Formation of deep trapping mechanism by UV, beta and gamma irradiated Eu(3+) activated SrY2O4 and Y4Al2O9 phosphors is discussed in this paper. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Their transmittance spectra showed strong absorption bands at 200â220 and 290â350 nm, and under 241 Am alpha-ray excitation, their radioluminescence spectra exhibited an intense emission peak at 373 nm that was attributed to the Eu 2+ 5dâ4f transition. These results were consistent with those for the Rb-free Eu:LiCAF. The highest light yield among the grown crystals was 36,000 ph/n, which was 20% greater than that of the Rb-free crystal. In addition, the neutron-excited scintillation decay times were 650â750 ns slower than that of the Rb-free Eu:LiCAF. -- Highlights: â¢Eu and Rb co-doped LiCaAlF 6 crystals were grown by the micro-pulling down method. â¢Transmittance, photoluminescence and radioluminescence spectra were measured. â¢The light yields and scintillation decays were evaluated under 252 Cf neutron irradiation\n\nEffects of Na and K co-doping on growth and scintillation properties of Eu:SrI_2 crystals\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nIto, Tomoki; Yokota, Yuui; Kurosawa, Shunsuke; Kral, Robert; Pejchal, Jan; Ohashi, Yuji; Kamada, Kei; Nikl, Martin; Yoshikawa, Akira\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWe grew Na and K co-doped Eu:SrI_2 [Na,Eu:SrI_2 and K,Eu:SrI_2] crystals by a modified micro-pulling-down method to reveal the co-doping effects on the crystal growth and scintillation properties. The non-codoped, Na0.5%, Na1.0%, K0.5% and K1.0%,Eu:SrI_2 crystals indicated high transparency while the milky parts were generated in the Na5.0% and K5.0%,Eu:SrI_2 crystals. The light yields of Na,Eu:SrI_2 and K,Eu:SrI_2 crystals under Î³-ray irradiation were decreased by the Na and K co-doping. On the other hand, there was a small change within 940â1020Â ns in the decay times by the Na and K co-doping. In the light yield proportionality under Î³-ray irradiation, the non-proportionality in the low energy region was improved by Na and K co-doping. - Highlights: â¢ Na or K co-doped Eu:SrI_2crystals were grown by the modified Î¼-PD method. â¢ The milky parts were generated in the Na5.0% and K5.0%,Eu:SrI_2crystals. â¢ The light yield of Eu:SrI_2was decreased by the Na or K co-doping. â¢ The decay times of Eu:SrI_2were almost constant by the Na or K co-doping. â¢ The non-proportionalitywas improved in the low energy region by the K co-doping.\n\nMonte-Carlo Modelling and Verification of Photoluminescence of Gd{sub 2}O{sub 3}:Eu Scintillator by Using the GEANT4 Simulation Code\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nCho, Gyu-Seok; Kim, Kum-Bae; Choi, Sang-Hyoun [Korea Institute of Radiological and Medical Science, Seoul (Korea, Republic of); Song, Yong-Keun [Inje University, Gimhae (Korea, Republic of); Lee, Soon-Sung [University of Science and Technology, Daejeon (Korea, Republic of)\n\n2017-01-15\n\nRecently, Monte Carlo methods have been used to optimize the design and modeling of radiation detectors. However, most Monte Carlo codes have a fixed and simple optical physics, and the effect of the signal readout devices is not considered because of the limitations of the geometry function. Therefore, the disadvantages of the codes prevent the modeling of the scintillator detector. The modeling of a comprehensive and extensive detector system has been reported to be feasible when the optical physics model of the GEomerty ANd Tracking 4 (GEANT 4) simulation code is used. In this study, we performed a Gd{sub 2}O{sub 3}:Eu scintillator modelling by using the GEANT4 simulation code and compared the results with the measurement data. To obtain the measurement data for the scintillator, we synthesized the Gd{sub 2}O{sub 3}:Eu scintillator by using solution combustion method and we evaluated the characteristics of the scintillator by using X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence. We imported the measured data into the GEANT4 code because GEANT4 cannot simulate a fluorescence phenomenon. The imported data were used as an energy distribution for optical photon generation based on the energy deposited in the scintillator. As a result of the simulation, a strong emission peak consistent with the measured data was observed at 611 nm, and the overall trends of the spectrum agreed with the measured data. This result is significant because the characteristics of the scintillator are equally implemented in the simulation, indicating a valuable improvement in the modeling of scintillator-based radiation detectors.\n\nEffect of Gd substitution on structure and spectroscopic properties of (Lu,Gd)2O3:Eu ceramic scintillator\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCao, Maoqing; Hu, Zewang; Ivanov, Maxim; Dai, Jiawei; Li, Chaoyu; Kou, Huamin; Shi, Yun; Chen, Haohong; Xu, Jiayue; Pan, Yubai; Li, Jiang\n\n2018-02-01\n\nIn this paper, (Lu1-xGdx)2O3:Eu (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9) ceramics were consolidated by the solid-state reaction method combined with vacuum sintering without sintering aids. We investigated the effect of the varying contents of Gd2O3 on the structure and spectroscopic properties of (Lu1-xGdx)2O3:Eu ceramics. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns indicate that proper amount of Gd2O3 can incorporate well with Lu2O3 and form Lu2O3-Gd2O3 solid solution. However, excessive Gd3+-doping in Lu2O3 will lead to the cubic phase transforming into monoclinic even hexagonal phase. The Gd3+ substitution no more than 50% of Lu2O3 enhances the radioluminescence, and reduces the fluorescence lifetime. Transmittance, photoluminescence, and radiation damage of the (Lu1-xGdx)2O3:Eu scintillation ceramics were also studied.\n\nIntrinsic radioactivity of KSr{sub 2}I{sub 5}:Eu{sup 2+}\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nRust, M.; Melcher, C.; Lukosi, E., E-mail: elukosi@utk.edu\n\n2016-10-11\n\nA current need in nuclear security is an economical, yet high energy resolution (near 2%), scintillation detector suitable for gamma-ray spectroscopy.

The crystals were transparent, 2.0 mm in diameter and 20â40 mm in length. Neither visible inclusions nor cracks were observed. Their transmittance spectra were measured. The strong absorption lines were observed at 200, 240, and 300 nm for Ce:LiSAF due to Ce 3+ 4fâ5d transition. In Eu:LiSAF, 200 (4fâ5d) and 300 (4fâ4f) nm absorption lines were detected.

Polystyrene has been used since it is a flexible and stable binder matrix, resistant to thermal and light deterioration and with suitable optical properties. Gd 2 O 3 :Eu 3+ has been selected as scintillator material due to its wide band gap, high density and visible light yield. The optical, thermal and electrical characteristics of the composites were studied as a function of filler content, together with their performance as scintillator material. Additionally 1 wt.% of 2,5-diphenyloxazole (PPO) and 0.01 wt.% of 1,4 di[2-(5phenyloxazolyl)]benzene (POPOP) were introduced in the polymer matrix in order to strongly improve light yield, i.e., the measured intensity of the output visible radiation, under X-ray irradiation. Increasing scintillator filler concentration (from 0.25 to 7.5 wt.%) increases scintillator light yield and decreases the optical transparency of the composite. The addition of PPO and POPOP strongly increased the overall transduction performance of the composite due to specific absorption and re-emission processes. It is thus shown that Gd 2 O 3 :Eu 3+ /PPO/POPOP/PS composites with 0.25 wt.% of scintillator content with fluorescence molecules are suitable for the development of innovative large-area X-ray radiation detectors with huge demand from the industries.

Differential thermal analysis (DTA and infrared spectroscopy (IR were used to study the chemical changes during the xerogel annealing. After the sol evaporation at 100 Â°C, the formed gel was annealed from 300 to 900 Â°C for 30 min under a rich O2 atmosphere, and the yielded product was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD to characterize the microstructural behavior and confirm the crystalline structure. The results showed that Lu2O3 nanopowders start to crystallize at 400 Â°C and that the crystallite size increases along with the annealing temperature. A transmission electron microscopy (TEM study of samples annealed at 700 and 900 Â°C was carried out in order to analyze the microstructure, as well as the size, of crystallites.

The main item of the package is the separation of generation and supply from the transmission grids and transport networks in the electricity and gas sectors (ownership unbundling), an approach favored by the Commission. On the other hand, the Commission wants to advance protection of the European market in case firms from third countries, to the extent in which they do not comply with the EU unbundling requirements, would want to assume control over an EU grid or network. The key points of the package are presented. The legal and entrepreneurial ramifications are discussed, for instance, under the aspect of protection of ownership, and concrete as well as potential concerns about ownership unbundling are voiced.

These calculations are based on determining the 4f ground state level of the Ce and Eu relative to the valence band of the host as well as the position of the Ce and Eu 5d excited state relative to the conduction band of the host. Host hole and electron traps as well as STEs (self trapped excitons) can also limit the transfer of energy from the host to the Ce or Eu site and therefore limit the light output. We also present calculations for host hole traps and STEs to compare the energies to the Ce and Eu excited states.

The scintillator is composed of CaF 2 :Eu or of NaI grains within a silicone rubber or polystyrene matrix, respectively. Neutrons colliding with the plastic matrix provide knockon protons, which in turn deposit energy within the grains of phosphor to produce pulses of light. Neutron interactions are discriminated from gamma-ray events on the basis of pulse height. Unlike NE-213 liquid scintillators, this solid scintillator requires no pulseshape discrimination and therefore requires less hardware. Neutron events are anywhere from two to three times larger than the gamma-ray exposures are compared to 0.7 MeV gamma-ray exposures. The CaF 2 :Eu/silicone rubber scintillator is nearly optically transparent, and can be made into a very sizable detector (4 cm x 1.5 cm) without degrading pulse height. This CaF 2 :Eu scintillator has been observed to have an absolute efficiency of 0.1% when exposed to 5-MeV accelerator-generated neutrons (where the absolute efficiency is the ratio of observed neutron events divided by the number of fast neutrons striking the detector)\n\nEu-activated fluorochlorozirconate glass-ceramic scintillators\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nJohnson, J.

Images obtained with the FCZ glass-ceramic scintillator and with cadmium tungstate are also presented. Comparison shows that the image quality obtained using the glass ceramic is close to that from cadmium tungstate. Therefore, the glass-ceramic scintillator could be used as an alternative material for image formation resulting from scintillation.

In addition to Ce{sup 3+}, a widely used dopant ion in oxide scintillators, divalent Europium (Eu{sup 2+}) has shown promise as a high-luminescence, fast-response luminescence center useful in the detection of ionizing radiation. In this research, aluminum oxide (Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}) was studied as a host material for the divalent europium ion. Polycrystalline samples of Eu{sup 2+}-doped translucent Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} were fabricated, and room temperature luminescence behavior was observed. Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} ceramics doped with 0.1 at% Eu{sup 2+} were fabricated with a relative density of 99.75% theoretical density and in-line transmittance of 22% at a wavelength of 800 nm. The ceramics were processed by a gel-casting method, followed by sintering under high vacuum. The gelling agent, a copolymer of isobutylene and maleic anhydride, is marketed under the commercial name ISOBAM, and has the advantage of simultaneously acting as both a gelling agent and as a dispersant. The microstructure and composition of the vacuum-sintered Eu{sup 2+}:Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} were characterized by Scanning Electric Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS).

We present a study using high temperature powder X-ray diffraction experiments to examine a deleterious high temperature phase transition. High temperature phases were identified through sequential diffraction pattern Rietveld refinement in GSAS II. We report the linear coefficients of thermal expansion for both high and low temperature phases of each compound. Thermal expansion for both compositions is greatest in the [0 0 1] direction. As a result, Bridgman growth utilizing a seed oriented with the [0 0 1] along the growth direction should be used to mitigate thermal stress.\n\nImplementing the EU climate and energy package with the economic crisis\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKerebel, C.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nIn March 2007, the European heads of state and government agreed at their European Council upon a 20% greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction target compared to 1990-levels and a 20% share of renewable energies in EU's final energy consumption by 2020.

Scintillation gamma-ray detectors are eld-tested, relatively inexpensive, and have good detection eciency. Semi-conductor detectors are gaining popularity because of their superior capability to resolve gamma-ray energies. However, they are relatively hard to manufacture and therefore, at this time, not available in as large formats and much more expensive than scintillation gamma-ray detectors. Scintillation gamma-ray detectors consist of: a scintillator, a material that emits optical (scintillation) photons when it interacts with ionization radiation, and an optical detector that detects the emitted scintillation photons and converts them into an electrical signal. Compared to semiconductor gamma-ray detectors, scintillation gamma-ray detectors have relatively poor capability to resolve gamma-ray energies. This is in large part attributed to the \"statistical limit\" on the number of scintillation photons. The origin of this statistical limit is the assumption that scintillation photons are either Poisson distributed or super-Poisson distributed. This statistical limit is often dened by the Fano factor. The Fano factor of an integer-valued random process is dened as the ratio of its variance to its mean. Therefore, a Poisson process has a Fano factor of one. The classical theory of light limits the Fano factor of the number of photons to a value greater than or equal to one (Poisson case). However, the quantum theory of light allows for Fano factors to be less than one. We used two methods to look at the correlations between two detectors looking at same scintillation pulse to estimate the Fano factor of the scintillation photons. The relationship between the Fano factor and the correlation between the integral of the two signals detected was analytically derived, and the Fano factor was estimated using the measurements for SrI2:Eu, YAP\n\nScintillators\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nCusano, D.A.; Holub, F.F.; Prochazka, S.\n\n1979-01-01\n\nScintillator bodies comprising phosphor materials and having high optical translucency with low light absorption, and methods of making the scintillator bodies, are described.

The propagation and focus of photons by the microscope are modeled by convolution with a depth-varying point spread function generated by the Gibson-Lanni model. Photons focused on the detector plane are then captured and converted into electronic signals by an electron multiplication (EM) CCD camera, which is described by a photosensor model considering various noises and charge amplification. Results: The performance metrics of radioluminescence imaging with a thin-film Lu{sub 2}O{sub 3} and conventional CdWO{sub 4} scintillator are compared, including spatial resolution, sensitivity, positron track area and intensity. The spatial resolution of Lu{sub 2}O{sub 3} system can achieve 10 Âµm maximally, a 12 Âµm enhancement from that obtained from CdWO{sub 4} system. Meanwhile, the system with Lu{sub 2}O{sub 3} scintillator can provide a higher mean sensitivity: 40% compared with that (21.5%) obtained from CdWO{sub 4} system. Moreover, the simulation results are in good agreement with previous experimental measurements\n\nSurvey meter using novel inorganic scintillators\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nYoshikawa, Akira; Fukuda, Kentaro; Kawaguchi, Noriaki; Kamada, Kei; Fujimoto, Yutaka; Yokota, Yuui; Kurosawa, Shunsuke; Yanagida, Takayuki\n\n2012-01-01\n\nSingle crystal scintillator materials are widely used for detection of high-energy photons and particles. There is continuous demand for new scintillator materials with higher performance because of increasing number of medical, industrial, security and other applications. This article presents the recent development of three novel inorganic scintillators; Pr-doped Lu 3 Al 5 O 12 (Pr:LuAG), Ce doped Gd 3 (Al, Ga) 5 O 12 (Ce:GAGG) and Ce or Eu-doped 6 LiCaAlF 6 (Ce:LiCAF, Eu:LiCAF). Pr:LuAG shows very interesting scintillation properties including very fast decay time, high light yield and excellent energy resolution. Taking the advantage of these properties, positron emission mammography (PEM) equipped with Pr:LuAG were developed. Ce:GAGG shows very high light yield, which is much higher than that of Ce:LYSO. Survey meter using Ce:GAGG is developed using this scintillator. Ce:LiCAF and Eu:LiCAF were developed for neutron detection. The advantage and disadvantage are discussed comparing with halide scintillators. Eu-doped LiCAF indicated five times higher light yield than that of existing Li-glass. It is expected to be used as the alternative of 3 He.

It has been proved that the energy transfer from the lattice to Eu 2+ ions in CsI:Eu occurs through the re-absorption of STE emission. The proposed model rests on the following experimental facts: (1) the activator emission at 2.68 eV rises gradually after the decay of the excitation pulse even at temperature lower than 90 K when V k centers are immobile; (2) the rise time of 2.68 eV emission and the decay time of STE emission have the same temperature dependences at T=78â300 K; (3) the excitation spectrum of 2.68 eV emission overlaps the emission spectrum of STE. -- Highlights: â¢ The scintillation process in CsI:Eu was studied under pulsed electron irradiation. â¢ A model of the energy transfer from the lattice to Eu 2+ ions in CsI:Eu was proposed. â¢ Eu 2+ ions in CsI:Eu reabsorb the Ï-emission of self-trapped excitons\n\nEstimation of Fano factor in inorganic scintillators\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nBora, Vaibhav, E-mail: bora.vaibhav@gmail.com [Center for Gamma-Ray Imaging, Department of Medical Imaging, University of Arizona and College of Optical Sciences, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85724 (United States); Barrett, Harrison H., E-mail: barrett@radiology.arizona.edu [Center for Gamma-Ray Imaging, Department of Medical Imaging, University of Arizona and College of Optical Sciences, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85724 (United States); Fastje, David, E-mail: dfastje@gmail.com [Center for Gamma-Ray Imaging, Department of Medical Imaging, University of Arizona and College of Optical Sciences, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85724 (United States); Clarkson, Eric, E-mail: clarkson@radiology.arizona.edu [Center for Gamma-Ray Imaging, Department of Medical Imaging, University of Arizona and College of Optical Sciences, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85724 (United States); Furenlid, Lars, E-mail: furen@radiology.arizona.edu [Center for Gamma-Ray Imaging, Department of Medical Imaging, University of Arizona and College of Optical Sciences, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85724 (United States); Bousselham, Abdelkader, E-mail: abousselham@qf.org.qa [Qatar Foundation, QEERI, P.O.

Correlation between the outputs of two photomultiplier tubes on opposite faces of a scintillation crystal was used to estimate the Fano factor of photoelectrons and scintillation photons. Correlations between the integrals of the detector outputs were used to estimate the photoelectron and photon Fano factor for YAP:Ce, SrI{sub 2}:Eu and CsI:Na scintillator crystals. At 662 keV, SrI{sub 2}:Eu was found to be sub-Poisson, while CsI:Na and YAP:Ce were found to be super-Poisson. An experiment setup inspired from the Hanbury Brown and Twiss experiment was used to measure the correlations as a function of time between the outputs of two photomultiplier tubes looking at the same scintillation event. A model of the scintillation and the detection processes was used to generate simulated detector outputs as a function of time for different values of Fano factor. The simulated outputs from the model for different Fano factors was compared to the experimentally measured detector outputs to estimate the Fano factor of the scintillation photons for YAP:Ce, LaBr{sub 3}:Ce scintillator crystals.

The regulation of CO within meat packaging varies worldwide and remains a topical and controversial issue. CO is prohibited in the EU for use in meat packaging mainly due to fears it may mask spoilage therefore misleading consumers. The issue of consumer acceptance of CO was not considered. This article reviews the most pertinent literature to assess if the problems associated with the prohibition have been addressed. Applying CO pretreatments prior to vacuum packaging enhances colour while allowing discolouration to occur by the use-by-date, thereby addressing concerns about safety. Recent work showing European consumer acceptance of CO in meat packaging demonstrates its future potential within the EU. The information provided may support framing future policies intended to assure consumer protection, safety, choice and interest. Re-evaluation of permitting CO as a packaging gas within the EU may be warranted. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, Europe still has fundamental challenges to face in this regard. The IPCC's 5. assessment report underscored again the urgency of action on climate change. Europe will need to prepare its position for the crucial 2015 climate change negotiations hosted by France. Moreover, Europe's energy sector is in dire need of long-term orientations. Europe's fuel bill is a significant weight on its economy; the weight of evidence suggests that Europe will not replicate the US shale gas revolution. It is also important not to exaggerate the importance of the US shale revolution for competitiveness and economic performance. Europe will need to develop its own collective, competitive solutions. In comparison with 2008, there is significant divergence in Member States' vision for the 2030 climate and energy package. Some want renewables targets, others don't. Neither the Commission nor Member States are yet ready to address energy efficiency in the new package. And so on. This article conducts three thought experiments, thinking through three radically different designs for the 2030 package. These are a CO 2 only package, an innovation package, or a subsidiarity package. These reflections lead to the conclusion that a combination of elements is needed. Firstly, carbon pricing via the EU ETS should remain a central pillar, and be reinforced. Secondly, technology deployment objectives remain necessary: the key question should be what kind of targets and how to negotiate them, not whether. Finally, there is a need to build flexibility into the new package, in order to take into account the diversity of Member States' circumstances and preferences.

The luminescence properties were studied before and after thermal anneal. It was shown by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) that annealing produces Eu{sup 2+} monomer centres, probably starting from Eu clusters in the needle crystalline layers. These centres seem structurally very similar to the Eu{sup 2+} monomer centres in annealed CsBr:Eu{sup 2+} needle layers. They give rise to a narrow luminescence band peaking at about 450 nm (2.76 eV) at room temperature, both under X-ray and UV excitation. The luminescence intensity of as-deposited layers is low. Annealing enhances photo- and radioluminescence on average by a factor of 1.5â3. Surprisingly, further sensitization of radioluminescence with a factor of up to 7 is possible by exposing the annealed needle layers to X-rays or UV, while in contrast, UV excited luminescence is slightly reduced. X-ray enhancement thus leads to a structured scintillator with a conversion efficiency of about 42,000 photons/MeV upon X-ray excitation. A similar radioluminescence enhancement is observed for annealed CsI:Eu{sup 2+} fine powder, but not for large single crystals or conglomerated polycrystals. The measurements and observations are consistent with Eu{sup 2+} monomer centres stabilized by water molecules. These molecules are incorporated via annealing, and that this happens when the morphology is such that water can diffuse throughout the volume of the crystals. The presence of stabilized Eu{sup 2+} monomers is necessary to enhance radioluminescence by X-ray exposure. A mechanism is proposed for the phenomenon.\n\nWavelength-shifting fiber signal readout from Transparent RUbber SheeT (TRUST) type LiCaAlF{sub 6} neutron scintillator\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nWatanabe, Kenichi, E-mail: k-watanabe@nucl.nagoya-u.ac.jp [Graduate School of Engineering, Nagoya University, Nagoya 464-8603 (Japan); Yamazaki, Takuya; Sugimoto, Dai; Yamazaki, Atsushi; Uritani, Akira; Iguchi, Tetsuo [Graduate School of Engineering, Nagoya University, Nagoya 464-8603 (Japan); Fukuda, Kentaro; Ishidu, Sumito [Tokuyama Corporation, Shunan 745-8648 (Japan); Yanagida, Takayuki; Fujimoto, Yutaka [Kyushu Institute of Technology, Kita-kyushu 808-0196 (Japan)\n\n2015-06-01\n\nAs an alternative to the standard {sup 3}He neutron detector, we are developing the Transparent RUbber SheeT type (TRUST) Eu doped LiCaAlF{sub 6} (Eu:LiCAF) scintillator.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the imaging and efficiency properties of a 33.3 mg/cm{sup 2} Lu{sub 2}O{sub 3}:Eu scintillating screen coupled to a high resolution RadEye HR CMOS photodetector under radiographic imaging conditions. Since Lu{sub 2}O{sub 3}:Eu emits light in the red wavelength range, the light emission efficiency and the imaging performance were compared with results for a Gd{sub 2}O{sub 2}S:Eu phosphor screen.

The detection efficiency is generally determined using a quenching curve, describing, for a specific radionuclide, the relationship between a quenching index given by the counter and the detection efficiency. A quenched set of LS standard sources are prepared by adding a quenching agent and the quenching index and detection efficiency are determined for each source. Then a simple formula is fitted to the experimental points to define the quenching curve function. The paper describes a software package specifically devoted to the determination of quenching curves with uncertainties. The experimental measurements are described by their quenching index and detection efficiency with uncertainties on both quantities. Random Gaussian fluctuations of these experimental measurements are sampled and a polynomial or logarithmic function is fitted on each fluctuation by Ï(2) minimization. This Monte Carlo procedure is repeated many times and eventually the arithmetic mean and the experimental standard deviation of each parameter are calculated, together with the covariances between these parameters. Using these parameters, the detection efficiency, corresponding to an arbitrary quenching index within the measured range, can be calculated. The associated uncertainty is calculated with the law of propagation of variances, including the covariance terms. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The structure and luminescence properties of Ca 2 + /Zn 2 + partially substituted Sr 2 SiO 4 :Eu 2 + phosphors were investigated in detail. With Ca 2 + or Zn 2 + added to the silicate host, the crystal phase could be transformed between the Î±-form and the Î²-form of the Sr 2 SiO 4 structure. Under UV excitation at 367Â nm, all samples exhibit a broad band emission from 420 to 680Â nm due to the 4f 6 5d 1 Â âÂ 4f 7 transition of Eu 2 + ions. The broad emission band consists of two peaks at 482 and 547Â nm, which correspond to Eu 2 + ions occupying the ten-fold oxygen-coordinated Sr.(I) site and the nine-fold oxygen-coordinated Sr.(II) site, respectively. The luminescence properties, including the intensity and lifetime of Sr 2 SiO 4 :Eu 2 + phosphors, improved remarkably on Ca 2 + /Zn 2 + addition, and promote its application in white light-emitting diodes.

New material discovery has been limited due to the difficulties of large crystal growth to completely absorb Î³-energies; whereas high-quality thin films or small crystals of candidate materials can be readily produced by various modern growth techniques. In this work, an ion-scintillator technique is demonstrated that can be applied to study scintillation properties of thin films and small crystals. The scintillation response of a benchmark scintillator, europium-doped calcium fluoride (CaF2:Eu), to energetic proton and helium ions is studied using the ion-scintillator approach based on a time of flight (TOF) telescope. Excellent energy resolution and fast response of the TOF telescope allow quantitative measurement of light yield, nonlinearity and energy resolution over an energy range from a few tens to a few thousands of keV\n\nNovel green-emitting Na2CaPO4F:Eu2+ phosphors for near-ultraviolet white light-emitting diodes\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHuang, Chien-Hao; Chen, Yen-Chi; Kuo, Te-Wen; Chen, Teng-Ming\n\n2011-01-01\n\nIn this study, green-emitting Na 2 CaPO 4 F:Eu 2+ phosphors were synthesized by solid-state reactions. The excitation spectra of the phosphors showed a broad hump between 250 and 450 nm; the spectra match well with the near-ultraviolet (NUV) emission spectra of light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The emission spectrum showed an intense broad emission band centered at 506 nm. White LEDs were fabricated by integrating a 390 nm NUV chip comprising blue-emitting BaMgAl 10 O 17 :Eu 2+ , green-emitting Na 2 CaPO 4 F:0.02 Eu 2+ , and red-emitting CaAlSiN 3 :Eu 2+ phosphors into a single package; the white LEDs exhibited white light with a correlated color temperature of 5540 K, a color-rendering index of 90.75, and color coordinates (0.332, 0.365) close to those of ideal white light. - Highlights: â Novel green-emitting Na 2 CaPO 4 F:Eu 2+ phosphors were synthesized by solid-state reactions in this research. â White LEDs were fabricated by integrating a 390 nm NUV chip comprising blue-emitting BaMgAl 10 O 17 :Eu 2+ , green-emitting Na 2 CaPO 4 F:0.02Eu 2+ , and red-emitting CaAlSiN 3 :Eu 2+ phosphors into a single package. â The white LEDs exhibited white light with a correlated color temperature of 5540 K, a color-rendering index of 90.75, and color coordinates (0.332, 0.365) close to those of ideal white light.\n\nTesting of AWE (A) package design AWG 446Eu4 to IAEA (1985) Regulations Standard\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nCohen, L.R.\n\n1990-10-01\n\nThis report gives details of the tests for normal transport (Type A tests) and accident conditions (Type B tests) carried out on the AWE(A) packaging assembly AWG 446Eu4 and demonstrates the ability of the packaging to remain leaktight after the tests with no damage to the contents.

Design Within-subject experimental cross-sectional survey of a representative sample of secondary school students. School-based pen and paper survey. Setting 27 secondary schools across Ireland, randomly stratified for size, geographic location, gender, religious affiliation and school-level socioeconomic status. Data were collected between March and May 2014. Participants 1378 fifth year secondary school students aged 16â17 in Ireland. Main outcome measures Young people's perceptions of attractiveness, health risk and smoker characteristics of packs according to EU and Irish branding and packaging guidelines. Results Packs with more branding elements were thought to be healthier than standardised packs for Silk Cut (Ï2=158.58, p<0.001), Marlboro (Ï2=113.65, p<0.001), and Benson and Hedges (Ï2=137.95, p<0.001) brands. Generalized estimating equation binary regressions found that gender was a significant predictor of pack attractiveness for Silk Cut, with females being more likely to find the EU packs attractive (Î²=â0.45, p=0.007). Gender was a significant predictor for females with regards to the perceived popularity of the Silk Cut brand (Î²=â0.37, p=0.03). Conclusions The removal of brand identifiers, including colour, font and embossing, reduces the perceived appeal of cigarette packs for young people across all three tested brands. Packs standardised according to Irish legislation are perceived as less attractive, less healthy and smoked by less popular people than packs which conform to the EU TPD 2014 guidelines.

In transmittance, absorption was proportional to dopant concentrations and typical optical quantum yield of Ce and Eu-doped LiCaAlF 6 were 40 and 100%, respectively. Scintillation wavelength and decay time profiles were investigated under X-ray irradiation. Ce 3+ and Eu 2+ 5d-4f luminescence appeared around 300Â nm and 370Â nm with typical decay time of 40Â ns and 1.5Â Î¼s, respectively. Optically stimulated luminescence of Ce-doped ones appeared under 405Â nm stimulation with detectable intensity while those of Eu doped ones were quite weak. Thermally stimulated luminescence of Ce- and Eu-doped LiCaAlF 6 were enough strong and they exhibited good response function from 1 to 1000Â mGy exposure. - Highlights: â¢ Optical, scintillation, OSL, and TSL properties of Ce or Eu differently doped LiCaAlF6 were studied. â¢ PL quantum yield of Ce and Eu doped LiCaAlF6 showed 40% and 100%, respectively. â¢ OSL was observed in Ce-doped LiCaAlF6. â¢ TSL was observed in both material systems and exhibited a good dose response from 1 to 1000Â mGy\n\nChloride, bromide and iodide scintillators with europium doping\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZhuravleva, Mariya; Yang, Kan\n\n2014-08-26\n\nA halide scintillator material is disclosed where the halide may comprise chloride, bromide or iodide.

This paper fills that gap, comparing the marginal costs and benefits of greenhouse gas emission reduction. The uncertainty about the marginal costs of climate change is large and skewed, and estimates partly reflect ethical choices (e.g., the discount rate). The 2010 carbon price in the EU Emissions Trading System can readily be justified by a costâbenefit analysis. Emission reduction is not expensive provided that policy is well-designed, a condition not met by planned EU policy. It is probably twice as expensive as needed, costing one in ten years of economic growth. The EU targets for 2020 are unlikely to meet the benefitâcost test. For a standard discount rate (3% pure rate of time preference), the benefitâcost ratio is rather poor (1/30)âso that benefits need to be very much higher, or costs very much lower than typically assumed to justify the 2020 targets. Only a very low discount rate (0% PRTP) would justify the 20% emission reduction target for 2020. - Highlights: âº First costâbenefit analysis of EU climate policy for 2020. âº Current carbon price in ETS can readily be justified by CBA. âº Emission targets for 2020 cannot be supported unless a low discount rate is chosen.\n\nA position-sensitive scintillation detector for two-dimensional angular correlation of annihilation radiation using metal-package position-sensitive photomultiplier tubes\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nInoue, Koji; Nagai, Yasuyoshi; Saito, Haruo; Nagashima, Yasuyuki; Hyodo, Toshio; Muramatsu, Shinichi; Nagai, Shota\n\n1999-01-01\n\nWe have constructed and tested a prototype of a new position sensitive Î³-ray detector which consists of an array of 2.6x2.6x18 mm 3 BGO scintillator blocks, a light guide, and four metal-package position-sensitive photomultiplier tubes (R5900-00-C8) recently developed by Hamamatsu Photonics Co.
