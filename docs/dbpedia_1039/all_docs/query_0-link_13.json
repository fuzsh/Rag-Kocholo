Погибает семья. Погибает 3-х месячный ребёнок.\n\nКак это всё бьётся? Как это, объясните мне!\n\nНачнём с того, что крылатые ракеты не должны прилетать в жилые дома и в будние дни, а не только в праздники! Но, вы одновременно молитесь с патриархом иерусалимским о мире, вы — официальные лица, вы приезжаете, вы везёте благодатный огонь в Москву, и при этом эта же власть посылает ракеты!\n\nИли это опять не мы? Ну, то есть, я уже слышал объяснение, что эти высокоточные ракеты потому попали в жилой дом, что украинское ПВО сбило эти ракеты. То есть, типа, не должно работать ПВО? И тогда всё будет хорошо?\n\nВ таком количестве страшных вещей виновата России, и при этом она говорит, что она не виновата! Зверства в Буче — это не мы! Малазийский боинг — это не мы! Мариуполь сравняли с землёй — это не мы! В Одессу летит ракета — это мы, но не совсем мы! Всё — не мы! А мы чего там делаем? Глубокие соболезнования всем погибшим и светлая память!

Киркоров также напомнил о совместной работе с Владимиром Зеленским, до того как он стал главой Украины. В те времена тот еще не помышлял ни о каком президентстве и занимался исключительно творчеством.\n\n«С Владимиром Зеленским мы вместе снимались в кино, — рассказывает Филипп Киркоров Daily Storm. — Это была трилогия «Любовь в большом городе». Замечательный фильм про любовь, который полюбился очень многим людям и в котором я играл святого Валентина. После этого мы общались на проекте «Фактор А», где председателем жюри была Алла Пугачева. Однако когда он\n\n[Зеленский] занялся политической карьерой, мы потеряли с ним связь и больше не встречались. Нет, отношения мы не портили, но с 2014 года от него ни слуху ни духу!»\n\n«Но я понимаю, что это президент страны и на нем лежит большая ответственность! — продолжает артист. — Это самое главное — сохранить мир! Для всех! И сделать, чтобы не гибли люди. Поэтому, естественно, как любой человек, я желаю всем только мира и добра!»\n\nОбострение ситуации в Донбассе идет с начала февраля 2022 года. 17 февраля Народная милиция ДНР и украинские военные обвинили друг друга в обстрелах на линии соприкосновения.\n\nЧитайте там, где удобно: добавьте Daily Storm в избранное в «Яндекс.Новостях», подписывайтесь в Дзен или Telegram.\n\n…\n\nЯвление Сатурна @ Народу Украины\n\nПослание Мира & Любви\n\nPacem # Terris\n\nAmor Hominum\n\nOdium Homo Sapiens\n\n…\n\nСизиф\n\nАвтор Сергей Полищук\n\nКак Сизиф в гору долго шёл, толкал тяжёлый камень,\n\nИзбил все ноги и поранил руки...\n\nНо камень удержать не смог, своими я руками,\n\nУпал он, мне слышны паденья звуки...\n\nКак Симон рыбу я ловил, забрасывая сети,\n\nТо на мели сидел, то бился с бурей...\n\nВернулся я пустым назад, смотрю идёт Спаситель,\n\nНе тем ты занят, говорит, в натуре...\n\nК Нему пошёл я по воде, но испугался очень,\n\nЯ стал тонуть и крикнул, помоги...\n\nСпаситель руку протянул, взглянул мне в мои очи,\n\nСказал, больше по кругу не беги...\n\nЯ больше в гору не иду, в моря не уплываю,\n\nСижу теперь всегда на одном месте...\n\nСвоих последних жизни дней, спокойно ожидаю,\n\nТам со Спасителем мы будем вместе!\n\n…\n\nSisyphus\n\nKing of Ephyra in Greek mythology\n\nFor other uses, see Sisyphus (disambiguation).\n\nIn Greek mythology, Sisyphus or Sisyphos (/;s;s;f;s/; Ancient Greek: ;;;;;;; S;syphos) was the founder and king of Ephyra (now known as Corinth). Zeus punished him for cheating death twice by being forced to roll an immense boulder up a hill only for it to roll down every time it neared the top, repeating this action for eternity. Through the classical influence on modern culture, tasks that are both laborious and futile are therefore described as Sisyphean (/s;s;;fi;;n/).\n\nSisyphus depicted on a black-figure amphora vase\n\nPersephone supervising Sisyphus in the Underworld, Attic black-figure amphora, c.;530 BC, Staatliche Antikensammlungen\n\nEtymology\n\nR. S. P. Beekes has suggested a pre-Greek origin and a connection with the root of the word sophos (;;;;;, \"wise\"). German mythographer Otto Gruppe thought that the name derived from sisys (;;;;;, \"a goat's skin\"), in reference to a rain-charm in which goats' skins were used.\n\nFamily\n\nSisyphus was the son of King Aeolus of Thessaly and Enarete and the brother of Salmoneus. He married the Pleiad Merope by whom he became the father of Glaucus, Ornytion, Thersander, Almus, Sinon and Porphyrion. Sisyphus was the grandfather of Bellerophon through Glaucus, and Minyas, founder of Orchomenus, through Almus.\n\nMythology\n\nReign\n\nSisyphus was the founder and first king of Ephyra (supposedly the original name of Corinth). King Sisyphus promoted navigation and commerce but was avaricious and deceitful. He killed guests and travelers in his palace, a violation of guest-obligations, which fell under Zeus' domain, thus angering the god. He took pleasure in these killings because they allowed him to maintain his iron-fisted rule.\n\nConflict with Salmoneus\n\nSisyphus and his brother Salmoneus were known to hate each other, and Sisyphus consulted the oracle of Delphi on just how to kill Salmoneus without incurring any severe consequences for himself. From Homer onward, Sisyphus was famed as the craftiest of men. He seduced Salmoneus' daughter Tyro in one of his plots to kill Salmoneus, only for Tyro to slay the children she bore him when she discovered that Sisyphus was planning on using them eventually to dethrone her father.\n\nCheating death\n\nSisyphus betrayed one of Zeus' secrets by revealing the whereabouts of the Asopid Aegina to her father, the river god Asopus, in return for causing a spring to flow on the Corinthian acropolis.\n\nZeus then ordered Thanatos to chain Sisyphus in Tartarus. Sisyphus was curious as to why Charon, whose job it was to guide souls to the underworld, had not appeared on this occasion. Sisyphus slyly asked Thanatos to demonstrate how the chains worked. As Thanatos was granting him his wish, Sisyphus seized the opportunity and trapped Thanatos in the chains instead. Once Thanatos was bound by the strong chains, no one died on Earth. This caused an uproar and Ares, annoyed that his battles had lost their fun because his opponents would not die, intervened. The exasperated Ares freed Thanatos and turned Sisyphus over to him.\n\nIn some versions, Hades was sent to chain Sisyphus and was chained himself. As long as Hades was tied up, nobody could die. Because of this, sacrifices could not be made to the gods, and those that were old and sick were suffering. The gods finally threatened to make life so miserable for Sisyphus that he would wish he were dead. He then had no choice but to release Hades.\n\nBefore Sisyphus died, he had told his wife to throw his naked body into the middle of the public square (purportedly as a test of his wife's love for him). This caused Sisyphus to end up on the shores of the river Styx. Then, complaining to Persephone, goddess of the underworld, that this was a sign of his wife's disrespect for him, Sisyphus persuaded her to allow him to return to the upper world. Once back in Ephyra, the spirit of Sisyphus scolded his wife for not burying his body and giving it a proper funeral as a loving wife should. When Sisyphus refused to return to the underworld, he was forcibly dragged back there by Hermes. In another version of the myth, Persephone was tricked by Sisyphus that he had been conducted to Tartarus by mistake, and so she ordered that he be released.\n\nIn Philoctetes by Sophocles, there is a reference to the father of Odysseus (rumoured to have been Sisyphus, and not La;rtes, whom we know as the father in the Odyssey) upon having returned from the dead [clarification needed]. Euripides, in Cyclops, also identifies Sisyphus as Odysseus' father.\n\nPunishment in the underworld\n\nAs a punishment for his trickery, Hades made Sisyphus roll a huge boulder endlessly up a steep hill. The maddening nature of the punishment was reserved for Sisyphus due to his hubristic belief that his cleverness surpassed that of Zeus himself. Hades accordingly displayed his own cleverness by enchanting the boulder into rolling away from Sisyphus before he reached the top, which ended up consigning Sisyphus to an eternity of useless efforts and unending frustration. Thus it came to pass that pointless or interminable activities are sometimes described as \"Sisyphean\". Sisyphus was a common subject for ancient writers and was depicted by the painter Polygnotus on the walls of the Lesche at Delphi.\n\nInterpretations\n\nBlack and white etching of Sisyphus by Johann Vogel\n\nSisyphus as a symbol for continuing a senseless war. Johann Vogel: Meditationes emblematicae de restaurata pace Germaniae, 1649\n\nAccording to the solar theory, King Sisyphus is the disk of the sun that rises every day in the east and then sinks into the west. Other scholars regard him as a personification of waves rising and falling, or of the treacherous sea. The 1st-century BC Epicurean philosopher Lucretius interprets the myth of Sisyphus as personifying politicians aspiring for political office who are constantly defeated, with the quest for power, in itself an \"empty thing\", being likened to rolling the boulder up the hill. Friedrich Welcker suggested that he symbolises the vain struggle of man in the pursuit of knowledge, and Salomon Reinach that his punishment is based on a picture in which Sisyphus was represented rolling a huge stone Acrocorinthus, symbolic of the labour and skill involved in the building of the Sisypheum. Albert Camus, in his 1942 essay The Myth of Sisyphus, saw Sisyphus as personifying the absurdity of human life, but Camus concludes \"one must imagine Sisyphus happy\" as \"The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man's heart.\" More recently, J. Nigro Sansonese, building on the work of Georges Dum;zil, speculates that the origin of the name \"Sisyphus\" is onomatopoetic of the continual back-and-forth, susurrant sound (\"siss phuss\") made by the breath in the nasal passages, situating the mythology of Sisyphus in a far larger context of archaic (see Proto-Indo-European religion) trance-inducing techniques related to breath control. The repetitive inhalation–exhalation cycle is described esoterically in the myth as an up–down motion of Sisyphus and his boulder on a hill.\n\nIn experiments that test how workers respond when the meaning of their task is diminished, the test condition is referred to as the Sisyphusian condition. The two main conclusions of the experiment are that people work harder when their work seems more meaningful, and that people underestimate the relationship between meaning and motivation.\n\nIn his book The Philosophy of Recursive Thinking, German author Manfred Kopfer suggested a viable solution for Sisyphus' punishment. Every time Sisyphus reaches the top of the mountain, he breaks off a stone from the mountain and carries it down to the lowest point. This way, the mountain will eventually be levelled and the stone cannot roll down anymore. In Kopfers' interpretation, the solution turns the punishment by the gods into a test for Sisyphus to prove his worthiness for godlike deeds. If Sisyphus is able \"to move a mountain\", he shall be allowed to do what, otherwise, only gods are entitled to do.\n\nLiterary interpretations\n\nPainting of Sisyphus by Titian\n\nSisyphus (1548–49) by Titian, Prado Museum, Madrid, Spain\n\nHomer describes Sisyphus in both Book VI of the Iliad and Book XI of the Odyssey.\n\nOvid, the Roman poet, makes reference to Sisyphus in the story of Orpheus and Eurydice. When Orpheus descends and confronts Hades and Persephone, he sings a song so that they will grant his wish to bring Eurydice back from the dead. After this song is sung, Ovid shows how moving it was by noting that Sisyphus, emotionally affected, for just a moment, stops his eternal task and sits on his rock, the Latin wording being inque tuo sedisti, Sisyphe, saxo (\"and you sat, Sisyphus, on your rock\").\n\nIn Plato's Apology, Socrates looks forward to the after-life where he can meet figures such as Sisyphus, who think themselves wise, so that he can question them and find who is wise and who \"thinks he is when he is not\"\n\nAlbert Camus, the French absurdist, wrote an essay entitled The Myth of Sisyphus, in which he elevates Sisyphus to the status of absurd hero. Franz Kafka repeatedly referred to Sisyphus as a bachelor; Kafkaesque for him were those qualities that brought out the Sisyphus-like qualities in himself. According to Frederick Karl: \"The man who struggled to reach the heights only to be thrown down to the depths embodied all of Kafka's aspirations; and he remained himself, alone, solitary.\" The philosopher Richard Taylor uses the myth of Sisyphus as a representation of a life made meaningless because it consists of bare repetition.\n\nWolfgang Mieder has collected cartoons that build on the image of Sisyphus, many of them editorial cartoons.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nSisyphus is a character in Hades, a 2020 indie rogue-like game developed by Supergiant Games, voiced by Andrew Marks. The player character, Zagreus, is given the option to lessen Sisyphus' sentence in Tartarus.\n\nSee also\n\nThe Myth of Sisyphus, a 1942 philosophical essay by Albert Camus which uses Sisyphus' punishment as a metaphor for the absurd\n\nSisyphus cooling, a cooling technique named after the Sisyphus myth\n\nSyzyfowe prace, a novel by Stefan ;eromski\n\nComparable characters:\n\nNaranath Bhranthan, a willing boulder pusher in Indian folklore\n\nTantalus, who was similarly punished with a neverending toil\n\nWu Gang – also tasked with the impossible: to fell a self-regenerating tree\n\n…\n\nSaturn (mythology)\n\nGod in Roman mythology\n\nSaturn (Latin: S;turnus [sa;;t;rn;s]) was a god in ancient Roman religion, and a character in Roman mythology. He was described as a god of time, generation, dissolution, abundance, wealth, agriculture, periodic renewal and liberation. Saturn's mythological reign was depicted as a Golden Age of abundance and peace. After the Roman conquest of Greece, he was conflated with the Greek Titan Cronus. Saturn's consort was his sister Ops, with whom he fathered Jupiter, Neptune, Pluto, Juno, Ceres and Vesta.\n\nQuick Facts Major cult center, Abode ...\n\nSaturn was especially celebrated during the festival of Saturnalia each December, perhaps the most famous of the Roman festivals, a time of feasting, role reversals, free speech, gift-giving and revelry. The Temple of Saturn in the Roman Forum housed the state treasury and archives (aerarium) of the Roman Republic and the early Roman Empire. The planet Saturn and the day of the week Saturday are both named after and were associated with him.\n\nMythology\n\nThe Roman land preserved the remembrance of a very remote time during which Saturn and Janus reigned on the site of the city before its foundation: the Capitol was called mons Saturnius. and Ovid. </ref> The Romans identified Saturn with the Greek Cronus, whose myths were adapted for Latin literature and Roman art. In particular, Cronus's role in the genealogy of the Greek gods was transferred to Saturn. As early as Andronicus (3rd century BCE), Jupiter was called the son of Saturn.\n\nSaturn had two mistresses who represented different aspects of the god. The name of his wife, Ops, the Roman equivalent of Greek Rhea, means \"wealth, abundance, resources.\" The association with Ops is considered a later development, however, as this goddess was originally paired with Consus.(p;244) Earlier was Saturn's association with Lua (\"destruction, dissolution, loosening\"), a goddess who received the bloodied weapons of enemies destroyed in war.\n\nUnder Saturn's rule, humans enjoyed the spontaneous bounty of the earth without labour in the \"Golden Age\" described by Hesiod and Ovid. He became known as the god of time.\n\nEtymology and epithets\n\nBy Saturn they seek to represent that power which maintains the cyclic course of times and seasons. This is the sense that the Greek name of that god bears, for he is called Cronus, which is the same as Chronos or Time. Saturn for his part got his name because he was \"sated\" with years; the story that he regularly devoured his own children is explained by the fact that time devours the courses of the seasons, and gorges itself \"insatiably\" on the years that are past. Saturn was enchained by Jupiter to ensure that his circuits did not get out of control, and to constrain him with the bonds of the stars.\n\n— Quintus Lucilius Balbus,\n\nas quoted by Cicero\n\nAccording to Varro, Saturn's name was derived from satus, meaning \"sowing\". Even though this etymology is problematic from the viewpoint of modern linguistics (for, while historically-motivated vowel length alternations do occur in Latin roots, the long ; in S;turnus in particular remains unexplained with this etymology, and also because of the epigraphically attested form Saeturnus), nevertheless it does reflect an original feature of the god.(p;144) Perhaps a more probable etymology connects the name with the Etruscan god Satre and placenames such as Satria, an ancient town of Latium, and Saturae palus, a marsh also in Latium. This root may be related to Latin phytonym satureia. (Like satus, however, satureia, Saturae palus, and probably also Satria, as indeed the apparently closely related Satricum, all also have a short a in the first syllable vs. the long ; of S;turnus.)\n\nAnother epithet, variably Sterculius, Stercutus, and Sterces, referred to his agricultural functions;(1.7.25) this derives from stercus, \"dung\" or \"manure\", referring to re;emergence from death to life. Farming was important to Roman identity, and Saturn was a part of archaic Roman religion and ethnic identity. His name appears in the ancient hymn of the Salian priests, and his temple was the oldest known in the records of the pontiffs.\n\nQuintus Lucilius Balbus gives a separate etymology in Cicero's De Natura Deorum. In this interpretation, the agricultural aspect of Saturn would be secondary to his primary relation with time and seasons. Since 'Time consumes all things', Balbus asserts that the name Saturn comes from the Latin word satis; Saturn being an anthropomorphic representation of Time, which is filled, or satiated, by all things or all generations. Since farming is so closely linked to seasons and therefore an understanding of the cyclical passage of time, it follows that agriculture would then be associated with the deity Saturn.\n\nTemple\n\nThe temple of Saturn was located at the base of the Capitoline Hill, according to a tradition recorded by Varro formerly known as Saturnius Mons, and a row of columns from the last rebuilding of the temple still stands. The temple was consecrated in 497 BC but the area Saturni was built by king Tullus Hostilius as confirmed by archaeological studies conducted by E. Gjerstad. It housed the state treasury (aerarium) throughout Roman history.\n\nFestival's time\n\nThe position of Saturn's festival in the Roman calendar led to his association with concepts of time, especially the temporal transition of the New Year. In the Greek tradition, Cronus was sometimes conflated with Chronus, \"Time,\" and his devouring of his children taken as an allegory for the passing of generations. The sickle or scythe of Father Time is a remnant of the agricultural implement of Cronus-Saturn, and his aged appearance represents the waning of the old year with the birth of the new, in antiquity sometimes embodied by Aion. In late antiquity, Saturn is syncretized with a number of deities, and begins to be depicted as winged, as is Kairos, \"Timing, Right Time\".\n\nIn Roman religion\n\nTheology and worship\n\nRuins of the Temple of Saturn (eight columns to the far right) in February 2010, with three columns from the Temple of Vespasian and Titus (left) and the Arch of Septimius Severus (center)\n\nThe figure of Saturn is one of the most complex in Roman religion. Dum;zil refrained from discussing Saturn in his work on Roman religion on the grounds of insufficient knowledge. Conversely, however, his follower Dominique Briquel has attempted a thorough interpretation of Saturn utilising Dum;zil's three-functional theory of Indo-European religion, taking the ancient testimonies and the works of A. Brelich and G. Piccaluga as his basis.\n\nThe main difficulty scholars find in studying Saturn is in assessing what is original of his figure and what is due to later hellenising influences. Moreover, some features of the god may be common to Cronus but are nonetheless very ancient and can be considered proper to the Roman god, whereas others are certainly later and arrived after 217 BCE, the year in which the Greek customs of the Kronia were introduced into the Saturnalia.(p;142 ff)\n\nBriquel's analysis\n\nAmong the features which are definitely authentic of the Roman god, Briquel identifies:\n\nthe time of his festival in the calendar, which corresponds to the date of the consecration of his temple (the Greek Cronia on the other hand took place in June–July);\n\nhis association with Lua Mater, and\n\nthe location of his cult on the Capitol, which goes back to remote times.\n\nThese three elements in Briquel's view indicate that Saturn is a sovereign god. The god's strict relationship with the cults of the Capitoline Hill and in particular with Jupiter are highlighted by the legends concerning the refusal of gods Iuventas and Terminus to leave their abode in the shrines on the Capitol when the temple of Jupiter was to be built. These two deities correspond to the helper gods of the sovereign in Vedic religion (Briquel refers to Dhritarashtra and Vidura, the figures of the Mahabharata) and to the Cyclopes and Hecatoncheires in Hesiod. Whereas the helper gods belong to the second divine generation they become active only at the level of the third in each of the three instances of India, Greece and Rome, where they become a sort of continuation of Jupiter.)\n\nDum;zil postulated a split of the figure of the sovereign god in Indoeuropean religion, which is embodied by Vedic gods Varuna and Mitra. Of the two, the first one shows the aspect of the magic, uncanny, awe inspiring power of creation and destruction, while the second shows the reassuring aspect of guarantor of the legal order in organised social life. Whereas in Jupiter these double features have coalesced, Briquel sees Saturn as showing the characters of a sovereign god of the Varunian type. His nature becomes evident in his mastership over the annual time of crisis around the winter solstice, epitomised in the power of subverting normal codified social order and its rules, which is apparent in the festival of the Saturnalia, in the mastership of annual fertility and renewal, in the power of annihilation present in his paredra Lua, in the fact that he is the god of a timeless era of abundance and bounty before time, which he reinstates at the time of the yearly crisis of the winter solstice.\n\nIn Roman and Etruscan reckoning Saturn is a wielder of lightning; no other agricultural god (in the sense of specialized human activity) is one. Hence the mastership he has on agriculture and wealth cannot be that of a god of the third function, i.e. of production, wealth, and pleasure, but it stems from his magical lordship over creation and destruction. Although these features are to be found in Greek god Cronus as well, it appears that those features were proper to Roman Saturn's most ancient aspects, such as his presence on the Capitol and his association with Jupiter, who in the stories of the arrival of the Pelasgians in the land of the Sicels(1.7.27–31) and that of the Argei orders human sacrifices to him.\n\nBriquel concludes that Saturn was a sovereign god of a time that the Romans perceived as no longer actual, that of the legendary origins of the world, before civilization.(p;155)\n\nRoman cult practices\n\nSacrifices to Saturn were performed according to \"Greek rite\" (ritus graecus), with the head uncovered, in contrast to those of other major Roman deities, which were performed capite velato, \"with the head covered.\" Saturn himself, however, was represented as veiled (involutus), as for example in a wall painting from Pompeii that shows him holding a sickle and covered with a white veil. This feature is in complete accord with the character of a sovereign god of the Varunian type and is common with German god Odin. Briquel remarks Servius had already seen that the choice of the Greek rite was due to the fact that the god himself is imagined and represented as veiled, thence his sacrifice cannot be carried out by a veiled man: This is an instance of the reversal of the current order of things typical of the nature of the deity as appears in its festival. Plutarch writes his figure is veiled because he is the father of truth.\n\nPliny notes that the cult statue of Saturn was filled with oil; the exact meaning of this is unclear. Its feet were bound with wool, which was removed only during the Saturnalia.(1.8.5) The fact that the statue was filled with oil and the feet were bound with wool may relate back to the myth of \"The Castration of Uranus\". In this myth Rhea gives Cronus a rock to eat in Zeus's stead, thus tricking Cronus. Although mastership of knots is a feature of Greek origin it is also typical of the Varunian sovereign figure, as apparent e.g. in Odin. Once Zeus was victorious over Cronus, he sets this stone up at Delphi and constantly it is anointed with oil and strands of unwoven wool are placed on it. The stone wore a red cloak, and was brought out of the temple to take part in ritual processions and lectisternia, banquets at which images of the gods were arranged as guests on couches. All these ceremonial details identify a sovereign figure.\n\nCult outside Rome\n\nLittle evidence exists in Italy for the cult of Saturn outside Rome, but his name resembles that of the Etruscan god Satres. The potential cruelty of Saturn was enhanced by his identification with Cronus, known for devouring his own children. He was thus used in translation when referring to gods from other cultures the Romans perceived as severe; he was equated with the Carthaginian god Baal Hammon, to whom children were sacrificed, and to Yahweh, whose Sabbath was referred to as Saturni dies, \"Saturn's day,\" in a poem by Tibullus, who wrote during the reign of Augustus; eventually this gave rise to the word \"Saturday\" in English. The identification with Ba'al Hammon later gave rise to the African Saturn, a cult that enjoyed great popularity until the 4th century. Besides being a popular cult it also had the character of a mystery religion and required child sacrifices. It is also considered as inclining to monotheism. In the ceremony of initiation the myste (initiate) \"intrat sub iugum\" (\"enters beneath the yoke\"), a ritual that Leglay compares to the Roman tigillum sororium.(pp;385–386) Even though their origin and theology are completely different the Italic and the African god are both sovereign and master over time and death, a fact that has permitted their association. However, the African Saturn is not directly derived from the Italic god, but rather from his Greek counterpart, Cronus.\n\nSaturnalia\n\nMain article: Saturnalia\n\nSaturn is associated with a major religious festival in the Roman calendar, Saturnalia. Saturnalia celebrated the harvest and sowing, and ran from December 17–23. During Saturnalia, the social restrictions of Rome were relaxed. The figure of Saturn, kept during the year with its legs bound in wool, was released from its bindings for the period of the festival.(1.8.5) The revelries of Saturnalia were supposed to reflect the conditions of the lost \"Golden Age\" before the rule of Saturn was overthrown, not all of them desirable, except as a temporary relief from civilized constraint. The Greek equivalent was the Kronia.\n\nMacrobius (5th century CE) presents an interpretation of the Saturnalia as a festival of light leading to the winter solstice.(1.1.8–9) The renewal of light and the coming of the new year was celebrated in the later Roman Empire at the Dies Natalis of Sol Invictus, the \"Birthday of the Unconquerable Sun,\" on December 25.\n\nRoman legend\n\nRelief held by the Louvre thought to depict the veiled throne of Saturn, either a Roman work of the 1st century CE or a Renaissance copy\n\nIt was customary for the Romans to represent divine figures as kings of Latium at the time of their legendary origins. Macrobius states explicitly that the Roman legend of Janus and Saturn is an affabulation, as the true meaning of religious beliefs cannot be openly expressed.(1.7.18) In the myth(1.9.-) Saturn was the original and autochthonous ruler of the Capitolium, which had thus been called the Mons Saturnius in older times and on which once stood the town of Saturnia.(1.7.27, 1.10.4); He was sometimes regarded as the first king of Latium or even the whole of Italy.(p;138–139) At the same time, there was a tradition that Saturn had been an immigrant god, received by Janus after he was usurped by his son Jupiter and expelled from Greece. In Versnel's view his contradictions – a foreigner with one of Rome's oldest sanctuaries, and a god of liberation who is kept in fetters most of the year – indicate Saturn's capacity for confounding social distinctions.(pp;139,;142–143)\n\nThe Golden Age of Saturn's reign in Roman mythology differed from the Greek tradition. He arrived in Italy \"dethroned and fugitive,\"(p;143) but brought agriculture and civilization for which he was rewarded by Janus with a share of the kingdom, becoming himself king. As the Augustan poet Virgil described it, \"He gathered together the unruly race\" of fauns and nymphs \"scattered over mountain heights, and gave them laws ... . Under his reign were the golden ages men tell of: in such perfect peace he ruled the nations.\" He was considered the ancestor of the Latin nation as he fathered Picus, the first king of Latium, who married Janus's daughter Canens and in his turn fathered Faunus.\n\nAlatri's main gate of the cyclopean walls\n\nSaturn was also said to have founded the five Saturnian towns of Latium: Aletrium (today Alatri), Anagnia (Anagni), Arpinum (Arpino), Atina and Ferentinum (Ferentino, also known as Antinum) all located in the Latin Valley, province of Frosinone. All these towns are surrounded by cyclopean walls; their foundation is traditionally ascribed to the Pelasgians.\n\nBut Saturn also had a less benevolent aspect, as indicated by the blood shed in his honor during gladiatorial munera. His consort in archaic Roman tradition was Lua, sometimes called Lua Saturni (\"Saturn's Lua\") and identified with Lua Mater, \"Mother Destruction,\" a goddess in whose honor the weapons of enemies killed in war were burned, perhaps as expiation. Versnel, however, proposed that Lua Saturni should not be identified with Lua Mater, but rather refers to \"loosening\"; she thus represents the liberating function of Saturn.(p;144)\n\nGladiatorial munera\n\nSaturn's chthonic nature connected him to the underworld and its ruler Dis Pater, the Roman equivalent of Greek Plouton (Pluto in Latin) who was also a god of hidden wealth. In 3rd-century AD sources and later, Saturn is recorded as receiving gladiatorial offerings (munera) during or near the Saturnalia.(p;144–145) These gladiator combats, ten days in all throughout December, were presented by the quaestors and sponsored with funds from the treasury of Saturn.\n\nThe practice of gladiatorial munera was criticized by Christian apologists as a form of human sacrifice.(p;146) Although there is no evidence of this practice during the Republican era, the offering of gladiators led to later theorizing that the primeval Saturn had demanded human victims. Macrobius says that Dis Pater was placated with human heads and Saturn with sacrificial victims consisting of men (;virorum victimis;).(1.7.31)(p;146) The figurines that were exchanged as gifts (sigillaria) during the Saturnalia may have represented token substitutes.(1.10.24)\n\nOn coins\n\nSaturn driving a quadriga on the reverse of a denarius issued by Saturninus\n\nIn 104 BCE, the plebeian tribune Lucius Appuleius Saturninus issued a denarius depicting Saturn driving a four-horse chariot (quadriga), a vehicle associated with rulers, triumphing generals, and sun gods. Saturninus was a popularist politician who had proposed reduced-price grain distribution to the poor of Rome. The head of the goddess Roma appears on the obverse. The Saturnian imagery played on the tribune's name and his intent to alter the social hierarchy to his advantage, by basing his political support on the common people (plebs) rather than the senatorial elite.(p;162)\n\nSee also\n\nPlanets in astrology#Saturn\n\nSatre (Etruscan god)\n\nSaturnalia\n\nFootnotes\n\nSaturnia Italia, et mons, qui nunc est Capitolinus, Saturnius appellabatur, quod in tutela Saturni esse existimantur.

His family were refugees from Asia Minor. He wrote his first song in 1960. quickly becoming a prolific writer, whose work was covered by many of the leading Greek singers. In the late 1960s, he began working with the then 19-year-old George Dalaras. He wrote Dalaras' first songs and helped establish Dalaras as one of the most important and successful Greek singers of all time.\n\nKouyioumtzis' songs have been covered by many important Greek singers, inclouding; Anna Vissi, Haris Alexiou, Yiannis Parios, Eleftheria Arvanitaki and Giannis Kalatzis. Aside from his solo compositions, Kouyioumtzis co-operated frequently with the poet-lyricist Manos Eleftheriou.\n\nKouyioumtzis' songs are regarded as top-quality music in Greece. Both his solo writing as well as his co writes with Manos Eleftheriou. His songs resonated deeply with Greeks in the sixties, exploring themes of; love, poverty and the agonies faced by the poor in living with dignity. According to lyricist Lefteris Papadopoulos, Kouyioumtzis \"followed the music spirit which was dominant in Greece during the last 25 years (from 1965 to 1990) through the music of Mikis Theodorakis and Manos Hadjidakis\".\n\nKouyioumtzis is remembered as a character of calm disposition, widely respected and held in the highest esteem by many, both in the field of Greek music as well as Greeks in general. A bashful character, it is characteristic that Kouyioumtzis preferred privacy over celebrity. Media appearances were infrequent, except on special occasions. His last appearance on television was in the entertainment music show of Spyros Papadopoulos on NET TV. During his last few years he left his Athens home and returned to his birthplace, Thessaloniki, where he continued working on music and songs until he died suddenly on 12 March 2005. His funeral took place at the Cathedral in the Municipality of Kalamaria and he was buried at the cemetery of Kalamaria, in East Thessaloniki.\n\nSome of Kouyioumtzis' most famous songs are:\n\nPou 'ne ta chronia (Where are the years gone by)\n\nMi mu thymonis matia mou (Don't be angry with me, my love)\n\nEnas kompos i chara mou (One drop is all my joy)\n\nNatane to 21 (If it was 1821)\n\nTo kokkino foustani (The red dress)\n\nKapou nichtoni (Somewhere the night is falling)\n\nSta chronia tis ypomonis (In the times of patience)\n\nKapios chtypise tin porta (Someone knocked on the door)\n\nChronia san vrochi (Years like rain)\n\nI eleftheri ke orei (Those free and beautiful)\n\nKapion allon filises (You kissed someone else)\n\nMatia mou, matia mou (Oh thou dear as my eyes)\n\nTa chrei tis kardias sou (Your heart's debts)\n\nOla kala (Everything is all right)\n\n…\n\n;;; ;;;; - Ola Kala\n\nOne theory: it came from the Greek phrase \"ola kala,\" which means all good. And then there's the Choctaw word \"okeh,\" which sounds like and means okay. President Woodrow Wilson reportedly thought it was the \"correct\" spelling of the word, and would OK documents with \"okeh.\"\n\n…\n\nWhich Is Correct: Hola or Ola?\n\nBy: Author Rozita Bron\n\nPosted on Published: March 8, 2021\n\nWhen learning a new language, we first learn how to greet people since our interactions with others usually start with a greeting. In texts, emails, on the phone, and in-person, we start with “hello,” which is common across all languages, including Spanish.\n\nIn Spanish, the correct way to greet people is with the word hola, whether it be in a formal or informal setting, Hola means hello, but the “h” is silent, so we say /ola/. In fact, the word ola in Spanish actually means wave. But that’s not all — if you are learning Portuguese, the correct expression for hello is ol;.\n\nSo, to answer which is correct: hola or ola, really depends on the language you are speaking and the context in which you want to use these words. This article will take a closer look at the expressions hola and ola and their uses.\n\nWhat Is the Difference between Hola and Ola?\n\nLet’s get back to our question and understand the difference between hola and ola.\n\nThe Meaning of Hola in Spanish\n\nSome scholars maintain that hola came to the shores of Spain with the Arabic Moors, who occupied Spain in 711 and stayed there until about 1609. The idea is that it’s a form of the Arab word Allah.\n\nThis occupation of Spain is why there are so many Arabic influences not only in the Spanish language but in the religion, farming methods, and architecture that are still evident today.\n\nOthers believe the Visigothic warriors brought the word hola when they invaded Spain. They say that it was a command for troops to stop.\n\nSo, a chieftain would raise his hand and shout hola! Locals probably took this as a greeting instead, and that’s where they derived the word.\n\nStill, these theories remain mostly unproven, so the origin of the Spanish word hola is still a mystery.\n\nSome linguists believe it is related to the Germanic expressions “hello” in English and “hallo” in German. It seems that there are also links to other European greetings, such as the Old High German hal;, hol;, or French hol; (source).\n\nOne thing we are sure of is that hola means “hello” in Spanish with a few other languages that have also borrowed this word for a greeting — this includes English. You can actually use hola to greet people in Asturian, Catalan, Dutch, Esperanto, and Ido.\n\nAs for spelling, in Spanish, you spell the word H-O-L-A without any accent marks.\n\nThe confusion between hola and ola comes in the pronunciation of these words because you say them exactly the same!\n\nYes, in Spanish, the “h” is always silent. But just because we don’t pronounce the “h” in Spanish words doesn’t mean that this silent letter does not have a role to play in the words in which it appears.\n\nThe Handy H\n\nNow the question is why there is an “h” in Spanish if we never actually pronounce it. Well, the reason is word history or etymology. Language is as old as the human race and has evolved a lot over time.\n\nThe ways we pronounce and write words have changed so much that you wouldn’t recognize them from a hundred years ago, nevermind a thousand.\n\nIn a nutshell, the Latin /f/ sound in the Romance languages changed to an /h/ sound as time went on. Then, at some point in late Roman history, they lost this use of the /h/ since none of the Romance languages use it that way today (source).\n\nBut even with the loss of the sound, the symbol or letter is still present, and there are specific reasons for that. Let’s take a closer look at the handy “h” in Spanish.\n\nWhen “h” appears next to “c,” it creates a new sound, “ch,” which is the same as in English, like chocolate, chair, or change.\n\n…\n\nOla\n\nOla (Arabic: ;;;) is an Arabic feminine given name that means \"surmount\", \"high\", and \"arise\". It is also a common Nigerian, Norwegian or Swedish masculine given name and another form of Olaf (Norwegian and Swedish). It is also a feminine given name and a nickname for Aleksandra in Polish.\n\n…\n\nOLA\n\nName Ola\n\nMeaning Wealth, Ancestor, Precious, Worth\n\nCategory/Origin Sanskrit\n\nGender Girl\n\nNumerology 1\n\nAccording to the numerology value 1, Ola is Self dependent, Action oriented, pioneer, natural leader, independent, strong willed, keen to learn stuffs, positive, energetic, enterprising, enthusiastic, brave and innovative.\n\nName Ola Name Ola happen to be independent, highly ambitious, creative and a bit self-centered. As Ola is so independent, Ola often tends to neglect others feelings and can ignore the negative people. Ola doesn't like to be guided or helped in any task, Ola loves to do things on own. That is why Ola has leadership qualities. Ola is self centric and in slef love.\n\nOla can be a good leader and manage groups. Aadamya also happens to be wise, decisive, optimistic and generous.\n\nOla can be self dependent and can handle the mess like a leader, can evolve as a great leader. Aadamya is a self learner.\n\n…\n\nThe name Kala is primarily a female name of Indian origin that means Art. Pronounced \"KAH-la.\" Also Hawaiian form of the name Sarah.\n\n…\n\nK;la\n\nHindu deity and concept\n\nFor other uses, see K;la (disambiguation).\n\n\"Kaal\" redirects here. For other uses, see Kaal (disambiguation).\n\nK;la (Sanskrit: ;;;, translit. k;l;, [ka;l;]) is a word used in Sanskrit to mean \"time\". It is also the name of a deity, in which sense it is not always distinguishable from k;la. Adi Kala or Adikala, is the omniscient formless yet with attribute Purusha, which basically is Ishvara. Author Soifer says, Narasimha is explicitly linked with Pralaya or Yuganta itself in Bhagavata Purana, Linga Purana, and Kurma Purana versions; he is said to appear like Kala or the fire of destruction. both agents of Pralaya. Author Pinchman says, \"It is said that at the time of primordial creation, three forms arise from Vishnu: time (kala), purusa, and prakrti\".\n\n10th century carving of Kala's head in Banteay Srei style, Siem Reap, Cambodia.\n\nAs Time personified, destroying all things, Kala is a god of death sometimes identified with Yama. In Shaivism, Kala is known as the fiery avatar of Shiva Kala Bhairava\n\nEtymology\n\nMonier-Williams's widely used Sanskrit-English dictionary lists two distinct words with the form k;la.\n\nk;la 1 means \"black, of a dark colour, dark-blue ...\" and has a feminine form ending in ; – k;l; – as mentioned in P;;ini 4–1, 42.\n\nk;l; 2 means \"a fixed or right point of time, a space of time, time ... destiny, fate ... death\" and has a feminine form (found at the end of compounds) ending in ;, as mentioned in the ;gveda Pr;ti;;khya. As a traditional Hindu unit of time, one k;l; corresponds to 144 seconds.\n\nAccording to Monier-Williams, k;la 2 is from the verbal root kal \"to calculate\", while the root of k;la 1 is uncertain, though possibly the same.\n\nAs applied to gods and goddesses in works such as the Dev; M;h;tmya and the Skanda Pur;;a, k;la 1 and k;la 2 are not readily distinguishable. Thus Wendy Doniger, translating a conversation between ;iva and P;rvat; from the Skanda Pur;;a, says Mah;k;la may mean \" 'the Great Death' ... or 'the Great Black One' \". And Sw;m; Jagad;;var;nanda, a Hindu translator of the Dev; M;h;tmya, renders the feminine compound k;la-r;tri (where r;tri means \"night\") as \"dark night of periodic dissolution\".\n\nAs a deity\n\nHead of Kala carved on top of Jabung temple niche, East Java, Indonesia.\n\nIn the epics and the Puranas\n\nKala appears as an impersonal deity within the Mahabharata, the Ramayana, and the Bhagavata Purana. In the Mahabharata, Krishna, one of the main characters, reveals his identity as Time personified. He states to Arjuna that both sides on the battlefield of the Kurukshetra War have already been annihilated. At the end of the epic, the entire Yadu dynasty (Krishna's family) is similarly annihilated.\n\nKala appears in the Uttara Kanda of the Ramayana, as the messenger of Death (Yama). At the end of the story, Time, in the form of inevitability or necessity, informs Rama that his reign on Earth is now over. By a trick or dilemma, he forces the death of Lakshmana, and informs Rama that he must return to the realm of the gods. Lakshmana willingly passes away with Rama's blessing and Rama returns to Heaven.\n\nTime appears in the Bhagavata Purana as the force that is responsible for the imperceptible and inevitable change in the entire creation. According to the Purana, all created things are illusory, and thereby subject to creation and annihilation, this imperceptible and inconceivable impermanence is said to be due to the march of Time. Similarly, Time is considered to be the unmanifest aspect of God that remains after the destruction of the entire world at the end of a lifespan of Brahma.\n\nIn the Chaitanya Bhagavata, a Gaudiya Vaishnavist text and biography of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, it is said that the fire that emerges from the mouth of Sankarshana at the End of Time is the K;l;nala, or \"fire of Time\". One of the names of Sankarshana is k;l;gni, also \"fire of Time\".\n\nThe Vishnu Purana also states that Time (kala) is one of the four primary forms of Vishnu, the others being matter (Pradhana), visible substance (vyakta), and Spirit (Purusha).\n\nIn the Bhagavad Gita\n\nAt Bhagavad Gita 11.32, Krishna takes on the form of k;la, the destroyer, announcing to Arjuna that all the warriors on both sides will be killed, apart from the Pandavas:\n\n;;;; ;;;;; ;;;;;;;;;;; ;;;;;;;;; ;;;;;; ;;;;;;;;;; ;; ;;;;;;;;; ;\n\nThis verse means: \"Time (k;la) I am, the great destroyer of the worlds, and I have come here to destroy all people.\" This phrase is famous for being quoted by J. Robert Oppenheimer as he reflected on the Manhattan Project's explosion of the first nuclear bomb in 1945.\n\nIn other cultures\n\nIn Javanese mythology, Batara Kala is the god of destruction. It is a very huge mighty and powerful god depicted as giant, born of the sperm of Shiva, the kings of gods.\n\nIn Borobudur, the gate to the stairs is adorned with a giant head, making the gate look like the open mouth of the giant. Many other gates in Javanese traditional buildings have this kind of ornament. Perhaps the most detailed Kala Face in Java is on the south side of Candi Kalasan.\n\nAs a Substance\n\nMain article: Ajiva\n\nLogarithmic scale of time used in Jain texts.\n\nIn Jainism, K;la (Time) is infinite and is explained in two different ways:\n\nThe measure of duration, known in the form of hours, days, like that.\n\nThe cause of the continuity of function of things.\n\nkalachakras in Jainism\n\nHowever Jainism recognizes a very small measurement of time known as samaya which is an infinitely small part of a second. There are cycles (kalachakras) in it. Each cycle having two eras of equal duration described as the avasarpini and the utsarpini.\n\n…\n\nTODA\n\nBy Uzi Hitman\n\nТода аль коль ма ше барата Спасибо за всё, что Ты создал\n\nТода аль ма ше ли натата Спасибо за всё, что Ты мне дал.\n\nАль ор эйнаим За свет очей\n\nХавер о шнаим За друга или двух друзей\n\nАль ма ше еш ли ба олям За всё, что у меня есть в мире.\n\nАль шир колеах За песню, что струится из души\n\nВе лев солеах И всепрощающее сердце\n\nШе бе схутам ани каям.\n\nТода аль коль ма ше барата Спасибо за всё, что Ты создал\n\nТода аль ма ше ли натата Спасибо за всё, что Ты мне дал\n\nАль цхок шель елед За смех ребёнка\n\nУ шми хатхелет И голубое небо\n\nАль адама и баит хам.

Prior to the late eighteenth century, the Toda coexisted locally with other communities, including the Badaga, Kota, and Kurumba, in a loose caste-like community organization. The Toda held the top ranking among those communities. The Toda population has hovered in the range 700 to 900 during the last century. Although an insignificant fraction of the large population of India, the Toda have attracted (since the late eighteenth century), \"a most disproportionate amount of attention because of their ethnological aberrancy\" and \"their unlikeness to their neighbours in appearance, manners, and customs.\"[1] The study of their culture by anthropologists and linguists would prove important in the creation of the fields of social anthropology and ethnomusicology.\n\nContents\n\n1 Description\n\n2 Population\n\n3 History\n\n4 Culture and society\n\n5 Religion\n\n6 Language\n\n7 Toda dwellings and lifestyle\n\n8 See Also\n\n9 Notes\n\n10 References\n\n11 External links\n\n12 Credits\n\nfreestar\n\nThe revered place of the buffalo in Toda society represents a remarkable feature of their life. Over the centuries, the Toda came to rely heavily upon the buffalo for their livelihood. They created religious and social values around the buffalo, including their origin myth. The first sacred buffalo had been created by the gods before the first Toda man and woman. Kona Shastra, the annual sacrifice of a male buffalo constitutes their central religious ceremony. The person who tends the holy sacred buffalo, the divine milkman, has the highest position in Toda society. The Toda way of life has been threatened by contact with modern India, a shift from herding to agriculture, and a loss of grazing land as a result of the government of Tamil Nadu conducting a reforestation program. UNESCO has declared the Toda peoples home land, Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, and International Biosphere Reserve a World Heritage Site. The initiatives by UNESCO may help the Toda people preserve their traditional way of life. Yet, the conveniences of modern life, such has more comfortable housing and clothing, as well as the benefits of the Information Age, may hasten the demise of the Toda people's traditional religious beliefs and social practices.\n\nDescription\n\nThe Toda traditionally live in settlements consisting of three to seven small thatched houses, constructed in the shape of half-barrels and spread across the slopes of the pasture.[2] They traditionally trade dairy products with their Nilgiri neighbors.[2] Toda religion centers on the buffalo; consequently, they perform rituals for all dairy activities as well as for the ordination of dairymen-priests. The religious and funerary rites provide the social context in which the Toda compose and chant complex poetic songs about the cult of the buffalo.[2] Fraternal polyandry, fairly common in traditional Toda society, has now largely been abandoned.\n\nDuring the last quarter of the twentieth century, agriculture by people moving into the area depleted some Toda pasture land.[2] Afforestation by the State Government of Tamil Nadu has also taken a toll on their grazing land. That has threatened to undermine Toda culture by greatly diminishing the buffalo herds. During the last decade, both Toda society and culture have also become the focus of an international effort at culturally sensitive environmental restoration.[3] The Toda lands now belong to the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, a UNESCO-designated International Biosphere Reserve. UNESCO has the area under consideration for selection as a World Heritage Site.[4]\n\nPopulation\n\nToda woman with her child, The National Geographic Magazine, April 1907\n\nAccording to M.B. Emeneau, the successive decennial Census of India figures for the Toda are: 1871 (693), 1881 (675), 1891 (739), 1901 (807), 1911 (676) (corrected from 748), 1951 (879), 1961 (759), 1971 (812). These in his judgment:\n\nJustifies concluding that a figure between 700 and 800 is likely to be near the norm, and that variation in either direction is due on the one hand to epidemic disaster and slow recovery thereafter (1921 (640), 1931 (597), 1941 (630)) or on the other hand to an excess of double enumeration (suggested already by census officers for 1901 and 1911, and possibly for 1951). Another factor in the uncertainty in the figures is the declared or undeclared inclusion or exclusion of Christian Todas by the various enumerators … Giving a figure between 700 and 800 is highly impressionistic, and may for the immediate present and future be pessimistic, since public health efforts applied to the community seem to be resulting in an increased birth rate and consequently, one would expect, in an increased population figure. However, earlier predictions that the community was declining were overly pessimistic and probably never well-founded.[1]\n\nHistory\n\nThe origin of the Todas remains unclear. One of the original tribes, they have been inhabiting the highest regions of the Nilgiris mountain range and have remained secluded for a very long time. Around 1823, the Collector of Coimbatore, John Sullivan, took a fancy to their land and bought it from them for a mere one rupee. He established a town at the place named Udagamandalam on the land. The interaction with western civilization caused many changes in the lifestyle of the Todas.\n\nCulture and society\n\nPhotograph of two Toda men and a woman. Nilgiri Hills, 1871.\n\nThe Toda dress consists of a single piece of cloth, worn like the plaid of a Scottish highlander. Cattle-herding and dairy-work constitute their sole occupation. They once practiced fraternal polyandry, a practice in which a woman marries all the brothers of a family, but no longer do so.[5] The ratio of females to males stands at about three to five. The Kota represent the most closely related people to the Toda, both ethnically and linguistically.\n\nThe Todas worship their dairy-buffaloes, but they have a whole pantheon of other gods. Kona Shastra, the annual sacrifice of a male buffalo calf, constitutes their only purely religious ceremony. Toda villages, called munds, usually consist of five buildings or huts, of which they use three as dwellings, one as a dairy and the other as a shelter for the calves at night. The inhabitants of a mund, generally related, consider themselves one family. The Todas numbered 807 in 1901, and their current population stands at around 1,100.[6]\n\nReligion\n\nA Toda mund, 1869, Samuel Bourne\n\nPhotograph (1871-72) of a Toda green funeral.\n\nAccording to the Todas, the goddess Teikirshy and her brother first created the sacred buffalo and then the first Toda man. They created the first Toda woman from the right rib of the first Toda man. The Toda religion also forbids them from walking across bridges, rivers must be crossed on foot, or swimming.\n\nThe Todas especially revere the Pandavas, although little evidence exists that the believe in the rest of the Hindu mythology. Toda temples, constructed in a circular pit lined with stones, look quite similar in appearance and construction to Toda huts.\n\nFrom Frazer's Golden Bough, 1922:\n\nAmong the Todas of Southern India the holy milkman, who acts as priest of the sacred dairy, is subject to a variety of irksome and burdensome restrictions during the whole time of his incumbency, which may last many years. Thus he must live at the sacred dairy and may never visit his home or any ordinary village. He must be celibate; if he is married he must leave his wife. On no account may any ordinary person touch the holy milkman or the holy dairy; such a touch would so defile his holiness that he would forfeit his office. It is only on two days a week, namely Mondays and Thursdays, that a mere layman may even approach the milkman; on other days if he has any business with him, he must stand at a distance (some say a quarter of a mile) and shout his message across the intervening space. Further, the holy milkman never cuts his hair or pares his nails so long as he holds office; he never crosses a river by a bridge, but wades through a ford and only certain fords; if a death occurs in his clan, he may not attend any of the funeral ceremonies, unless he first resigns his office and descends from the exalted rank of milkman to that of a mere common mortal. Indeed it appears that in old days he had to resign the seals, or rather the pails, of office whenever any member of his clan departed this life. However, these heavy restraints are laid in their entirety only on milkmen of the very highest class\n\nLanguage\n\nThe Toda language belongs to the Dravidian family. Like their ethnology, they have aberrant language and difficult phonologically. Toda (along with their neighbors, the Kota) belongs to the the southern subgroup of the historical family proto-South-Dravidian, splitting off from South Dravidian after Kannada and Telegu, but before Malayam. In modern linguistic terms, the aberrancy of Toda results from disproportionately numerous rules, both early and recent in their ordering, not shared by the other South Dravidian languages (and shared only to a small extent by Kota).[1]\n\nToda dwellings and lifestyle\n\nThe hut of a Toda Tribe of Nilgiris, India.\n\nThe Todas live in small hamlets called munds. The Toda huts, of an oval, pent-shaped construction, usually stand ten feet (3 m) high, eighteen feet (5.5 m) long and nine feet (2.7 m) wide. Built of bamboo fastened with rattan and thatched, a wall of loose stones encloses each hut. Dressed stones (mostly granite) usually make up the front and back of the hut. Each hut has only a tiny entrance at the front—about 3 feet (90 cm) wide, 3 feet (90 cm) tall. That unusually small entrance serves as a means of protection from wild animals. The Toda art forms, a kind of rock mural painting, decorates the front portion of the hut. Thicker bamboo canes arch to give the hut its basic tent shape. Tied close and parallel to each other, thinner bamboo canes lay over that frame. Dried grass stacks were laid over thatas thatch.\n\nThe forced interaction with civilization has caused a lot of changes in the lifestyle of the Todas. The Todas used to be a pastoral people but now increasingly venture into agriculture and other occupations. They used to be strict vegetarians but some can be now be seen eating non-vegetarian food. Although many Toda have abandoned their traditional distinctive huts for concrete houses,[5] a movement has gained momentum to build tradition barrel-vaulted huts. During the last decade, forty new huts have been built and many Toda sacred dairies have been renovated.[7]\n\nSee Also\n\nNilgiris district\n\nKarnataka\n\nPolyandry\n\nIndian vernacular architecture\n\nNotes\n\n; Jump up to: 1.0 1.1 1.2 (Emeneau 1984, pp. 1-2)\n\n; Jump up to: 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 Encyclop;dia Britannica, Toda.

She ruled the kingdom as regent during the minority of her son Garc;a S;nchez I from 931. She was herself descended from the previous royal dynasty, Aritza.\n\nQuick Facts Queen consort of Pamplona, Tenure ...\n\nFamily\n\nToda was the daughter of Aznar S;nchez, lord of Larraun, paternal grandson of King Garc;a ;;iguez of Pamplona, while her mother Onneca Fort;nez was a daughter of King Fort;n Garc;s. Thus, Toda was a descendant of the Aritza dynasty of Navarrese monarchs. Toda was an aunt or cousin of Caliph Abd-al-Rahman III. Toda was married to King Sancho I of Pamplona, with whom she had the following children:\n\nUrraca, queen of Le;n from 931 until 951 as the wife of Ramiro II\n\nOneca, queen of Le;n from 926 until 931 as the wife of Alfonso IV\n\nSancha, countess of Castile as the wife of Fern;n Gonz;lez\n\nVelasquita, married first to Count Munio V;laz of ;lava, then to Galindo of Ribagorza, and finally to Fort;n Galindez.\n\nOrbita\n\nGarc;a I, king of Pamplona from 925 until 970\n\nHaving died while their son was still underage, Toda's husband was succeeded by his brother Jimeno Garc;s, who was married to Toda's sister Sancha.\n\nRegency\n\nWith the death of her brother-in-law King Jimeno in 931, Queen Toda became regent and guardian for her young son, Garc;a S;nchez I. In 934 Toda signed a treaty pledging allegiance to her nephew Abd-ar-Rahman III, and released hostages of the Banu Di n-Nun clan, the caliph confirming the rule of her son Garc;a (this has sometimes been interpreted as an act of the Caliph to liberate Garc;a from his mother's direct control). This led to the rebellion in Falces by a count Fort;n Garc;s, an \"irascible man who hated Muslims\", the uprising being suppressed with Cordoban arms. Toda violated her treaty in 937, forcing a punitive campaign.\n\nDuring several stretches she appears in the royal charters of the kingdom to the exclusion of her daughter-in-law, the queen, from 947 to 955, and again in 959. In 958 she was ruling her own subkingdom, in the area of Degio and Lizarra, towns not otherwise identified.\n\nThe same year, she took an interest in the health of her Leonese grandson Sancho I, whose obesity was largely responsible for his dethronement. Toda requested the assistance of Abd-ar-Rahman III, the Caliphate of C;rdoba being renowned for its physicians. The caliph sent her his Jewish physician Hasdai ibn Shaprut, who promised to cure Sancho on condition that Toda visit the city of C;rdoba. Therefore, Toda, her son Garc;a S;nchez I of Pamplona and grandson Sancho I of Le;n, nobles and clergymen arrived in C;rdoba, where they were received with full honors and amid much pomp. The arrival of this Christian queen in the capital of an Islamic caliphate enhanced Abd-ar-Rahman III's prestige among his subjects, and is considered a landmark in the history of medieval diplomacy. Sancho's medical treatment was successful, and he was \"relieved from his excessive corpulence.\"\n\nToda was an energetic diplomat, arranging political marriages for her daughters among the competing royalty and nobility of Christian Iberia. She died in 958\n\nNotes\n\nThe relationship of Toda and her siblings to Abd al-Rahman III is based on the genealogy of the rulers of Pamplona found in the C;dice de Roda, which reports that Sancho, Toda and Sancha were born to Onneca's first marriage to Aznar S;nchez, and Abd-al-Rahman III was grandson of a second marriage to Emir ‘Abdullah ibn Muhammad. However, the resulting timeline has been dismissed as it would necessitate Toda being improbably old at the time of her son Garc;a's birth. Most historians have concluded that the C;dice reversed the order of Onneca's marriages, though this alternative timeline is not without its own difficulties. Arturo Ca;ada Juste has recently proposed that a different error underlies the problem, that the C;dice partially confused Onneca Fortu;ez, wife of Aznar S;nchez, with her aunt Onneca Garc;s, wife of Aznar Gal;ndez II of Aragon. Were it the latter Onneca who was also wife ‘Abdullah, it would resolve chronological concerns, while making Abd-al-Rahman III the first cousin, rather than nephew, of Toda and her siblings.\n\n…\n\nToda language\n\nToda is a Dravidian language noted for its many fricatives and trills. It is spoken by the Toda people, a population of about one thousand who live in the Nilgiri Hills of southern India. The Toda language originated from Toda-Kota subgroup of South Dravidian.\n\nQuick Facts Pronunciation, Native to ...\n\nPhonemic inventory\n\nVowels\n\nFor a Dravidian language, Toda's sixteen vowels is an unusually large number. There are eight vowel qualities, each of which may occur long or short. There is little difference in quality between the long and short vowels, except for /e/, which occurs as [e] when short and as [;;] when long.\n\nMore information Front, Central ...\n\nConsonants\n\nToda has an unusually large number of fricatives and trills. Its seven places of articulation are the most for any Dravidian language. The voiceless laterals are true fricatives, not voiceless approximants; the retroflex lateral is highly unusual among the world's languages.\n\nVoiceless fricatives are allophonically voiced intervocalically in Toda. There are also the invariably voiced fricatives /;, ;, ;/, though the latter is marginal. The nasals and /r;, ;r, j/ are allophonically devoiced or partially devoiced in final position or next to voiceless consonants.\n\nMore information Labial, Denti-alveolar ...\n\nAll of these consonants may occur in word-medial and word-final positions. However, only a restricted set occur word-initially. These are /p, t;, k, f, s;, m, n;, r;, l;, j, w/, in boldface above.\n\nUnlike the other dental consonants, /;/ is interdental. Similarly, /f/ is labiodental whereas the other labials are bilabial.[citation needed]\n\nApical consonants are either alveolar or postalveolar. The actual feature that distinguishes /r;/ and /r;/ is uncertain. They have the same primary place of articulation. Spaji; and colleagues have found that the rhotic that may occur word initially (erroneously called \"dental\" in previous literature, perhaps because Dravidian coronals tend to be dental by default) has a secondary articulation, which they have tentatively identified as advanced tongue root until further measurements can be made. This analysis is assumed in the transcription /r;/.[citation needed]\n\nAnother difference between them is that /r;/ is the least strongly trilled, most often occurring with a single contact. However, unlike a flap, multiple contacts are normal, if less common, and /r;/ is easily distinguishable from the other trills when they are all produced with the same number of contacts.[citation needed]\n\nThe retroflex consonants are subapical. Retroflex /;r/ is more strongly trilled than the other rhotics. However, it is not purely retroflex. Although the tongue starts out in a sub-apical retroflex position, trilling involves the tip of the tongue, and this causes it to move forward toward the alveolar ridge. This means that the retroflex trill gives a preceding vowel retroflex coloration the way other retroflex consonants do, but that the vibration itself is not much different from the other trills.[citation needed]\n\nGrammar\n\nVerbal Morphology\n\nAs described by Murray B. Emeneau, in his \"Toda Grammar and Texts,\" the entire Toda verbal system is based on the addition of many suffixes to the two base verb stems, stem 1 (henceforth, S1) and stem 2 (henceforth, S2). There are fifteen classes of verbs in Toda, each of which uses one of four suffixes to form its S2 from its S1. A short summary is given below:\n\nMore information Class, Example ...\n\n1Emeneau lists the rule \"S1 -;/-;/-;/-;/-;/-x + -t- = S2 -;/-;/-;/-;/-;/-k; S1 -r/-l/-n/-s;/-;/-; + -t- = S1 -d/-;/-;/-;/-;/-;\" for this class.\n\nTo each of these stems, further suffixes may be added to create verb forms indicating different tenses and moods.

The embroidery, which has a fine finish, appears like a woven cloth but is made with use of red and black threads with a white cotton cloth background. Both sides of the embroidered fabric are usable and the Toda people are proud of this heritage. Both men and women adorn themselves with the embroidered cloaks and shawls.\n\nQuick Facts Alternative names, Type ...\n\nThis handicraft product is listed as a geographically tagged product and is protected under the Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration & Protection) Act (GI Act) 1999 of the Government of India. It was registered by the Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks under the title \"Toda Embroidery\" and recorded at GI Application number 135 under Class 24, Class 25, and Class 26 as Textiles and Textile Goods, clothing, and Embroidery, respectively, in March 2013. A certificate of the GI registration was formally presented to the community leaders in June 2013. This was first initiated in 2008 and the agencies who supported this registration are the Toda Nalavaazhvu Sangam, Keystone Foundation, and Poompuhar.\n\nLocation\n\nThis art heritage is practiced by the Toda tribals based in the Nilgiris (literally meaning 'neelam', the \"Blue Hills\") located in an elevation range of 900 to 2,636 metres (2,953 to 8,648 ft).\n\nHistory\n\nThe Todas (also known by names such as Tudas, Tudavans, and Todar) who make this embroidery live as one small community, population of 1,600 spread over 69 settlements, and about 400 of them are stated to be engaged in the embroidery work) in the Nilgiri Hills in the higher elevations of the Niligiri plateau, in Tamil Nadu. Apart from their vocation as herdsmen of buffaloes and cultivation in the grass lands, they are also involved in the tradition of making many handicrafts items which includes traditional black and red embroidery practiced by the women of the community; the embroidery is usually made on their cloaks called \"pootkhul(zh)y\" which is draped by both their men and women.\n\nMurray Emeneau, a well known linguist of the Toda language, had referred to nine Toda embroidery designs in his paper published in 1937. There are earlier mention in the ancient ethnographic documents of the Toda women working on this art form in the western region of the Nilgiri plateau.\n\nProduction process\n\nThe local terms used to describe the embroidery work are 'kuty' or 'awtty' meaning \"stitching\" and 'kutyvoy' meaning the embroidered piece. The materials used in this work are roughly woven white cloth, woolen black and red threads with use occasionally of blue threads and manufactured needles. The designs developed relate to nature and the daily cycle of life.\n\nThe fabric used is coarse bleached half white cotton cloth with bands; the woven bands on the fabric consist of two bands, one in red and one band in black, spaced at six inches. Embroidery is limited to the space within the bands and is done by using a single stitch darning needle. It is not done within an embroidery frame but is done by counting the warp and weft on the fabric which has uniform structure by the reverse stitch method. To bring out a rich texture in the embroidered fabric, during the process of needle stitching, a small amount of tuft is deliberately allowed to bulge. Geometric pattern is achieved by counting the warp and weft in the cloth used for embroidery.\n\nThough their favorite study is related floral landscape, the patterns used in Toda embroidery do not cover many floral motifs but generally cover celestial bodies (like Sun and Moon), reptiles, animals, and horns of buffaloes, made in crimson and black colours. Rabbit ears are a constant depiction on the boundary of the embroidered cloth. Another common design in the form of black triangles in a box design is done in honour of their first priest. Women who do embroidery consider their work as a \"tribute to Nature\". A dead body is always wrapped in an embroidered fabric with traditional designs and then buried. However, coloured stripes are used in fabrics of daily use. As a traditional garment, it is worn by both men and women at all ceremonial occasions and also at funerals. Elderly people of the community wear this cloth daily.\n\nThe inspecting agency to oversee the quality of embroidery is the Textile Committee of the Ministry of Textiles of the Government of India.\n\n…\n\nToda, Saitama\n\nCity in Kant;, Japan\n\nToda (;;;, Toda-shi) is a city located in Saitama Prefecture, Japan.
