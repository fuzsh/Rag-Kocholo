        "text": "Welcome to another trailer post. We’re almost midway through September and that means closer to the Raindance Film Festival (here’s my preview). I’ll be attending that and, hopefully, interviewing some directors. I’ll have to see how my schedule shapes up. It will be tight because I’ll also be going to see the Tate’s exhibition about JMW Turner’s painting towards the end of his career. After Raindance, I’ll be going to the BFI London Film Festival (here’s my preview). Fewer films to see there but there is The World of Kanako, my most anticipated title of 2014. I hope to get the preview of the Vancouver Film Festival completed next week.\n\nThe week has been very busy with lots of extra hours at work, Japanese class and yet I still found time to write up my autumn anime season picks for the blog and start on a massive backlog of reviews including one from last year’s Raindance and this year’s Japan Foundation Touring Film Programme. I also completed Tales of the World: Radiant Mythology on the PSP. Truthfully, I was ready to complete it long ago but I stopped playing it because it was not that much fun. Time to start playing Star Ocean: First Departure. No movies watched this week. As far as anime goes, I watched all of the latest episodes from my summer picks – the Space Dandy episode Lovers Are Trendy, Baby, was fun and heart-breaking. Scarlet and Dandy made such a good couple. Tokyo Ghoul is getting even more exciting and over the top and Barakamon is maintaining its high quality brilliance but the biggest investment in time, attention and effort for me happened when I started watching the anime adaptation of Monster again, a mature and dark anime I rate highly. 70+ episodes and it is worth it!\n\nThis week I posted about the London Film Festival and Takashi Miike’s latest horror title, As the God’s Will which is released next month.\n\nWhat’s released this weekend in Japan? Lots of excellent films, much like last year’s September!\n\nRurouni Kenshin The Legend Ends\n\nJapanese: るろうに剣心 伝説の最期編\n\nRomaji: Rurouni Kenshin: Densetsu no Saigo-hen\n\nRelease Date: September 13th, 2014 (Japan)\n\nRunning Time: 135 mins.\n\nDirector: Keishi Otomo\n\nWriter: Kiyomi Fujii, Keishi Otomo, (Screenplay), Nobuhiro Watsuki (Original Manga)\n\nStarring: Takeru Satoh, Emi Takei, Yu Aoi, Munetaka Aoki, Ryunosuke Kamiki, Yusuke Iseya, Tatsuya Fujiwara, Kaito Oyagi, Tao Tsuchiya, Maryjun Takahashi, Kazufuki Miyazawa,\n\nThe Kyoto arc of the original manga comes to an explosive end as Kenshin must face off against another elite assassin, Shishio Makoto, a man who wants to overthrow the newly formed government.\n\nWebsite\n\nHoney Flappers\n\nJapanese: ハニー フラッパーズ\n\nRomaji: Hani- Furappa-zu\n\nRelease Date: September 13th, 2014 (Japan)\n\nRunning Time: 80 mins.\n\nDirector: Megumi Sasaki\n\nWriter: Hiroyuki Machino, Kenji Hirayama, Megumi Sasaki (Screenplay),\n\nStarring: Anri Sakaguchi, Yukie Kawamura, Saaya, isaki Nitou, Yukiko Kawabe, Haruna Yabuki, Yuuri Morishita, Asuka Kishi, Sayuri Anzu, Ayumi Orii, Ruri Shinato\n\nMika (Sakaguchi) struggles at university but all of that changes when she gets a job as a hostess at Club Honey, a cabaret club and battles to be the best hostess in town!\n\nWebsite\n\nMaiko wa Lady\n\nJapanese: 舞妓はレデイ\n\nRomaji: Maiko wa Redei\n\nRelease Date: September 13th, 2014 (Japan)\n\nRunning Time: 135 mins.\n\nDirector: Masayuki Suo\n\nWriter: Masayuki Suo (Screenplay),\n\nStarring: Mone Kamishiraishi, Hiroki Hasegawa, Jurina Matsui, Sumiko Fuji, Eri Watanabe, Tamiyo Kusakari, Tomoko Tabata, Naoto Takenaka, Sakurako Ohara, Gaku Hamada, Tou Muto,\n\nHaruko Saigo (Kmshiraishi) is a Kagoshima girl with dreams of becoming a geisha.

When writing about film festivals you get to know a lot of the titles that are on tour around the world and, of course, you pick up one or two that you really want to see. The Pinkie is one of those films. I first encountered it when writing the Rotterdam International Film Festival post and I had hoped that I would see it at Raindance or the London Film Festival. Alas, no. It’s getting released in Japan this weekend and I still think it looks like a heap of fun. It also has the best poster that I have seen this year (apart from Snow White Murder Case)! Here’s my original blurb from Rotterdam:\n\nWow, this looks like a lot of fun which is why I put it first. It comes from Lisa Takeba who was at last year’s festival with a short film about an alien private detective who is wandering around earth. If that sounds a little random, this one reads a lot more interesting as it looks like a mash-up of anime, film and Japanese pop culture and fashion where a female stalker has her way with the guy of her dreams. Lisa Takeba has a background in advertising and writing videogames so she’s got a lot of experience with different styles to work with! It stars Miwako Wagatsuma who is an actress worth tracking because she is taking on interesting roles as can be seen from her filmography which includes Guilty of Romance, The End of Puberty, Sentimental Yasuko, Kuro and Shing Shing Shing.\n\nSince they were both five, Ryosuke has been stalked by Momoko – the ugliest girl in the village. Momoko’s love for Ryosuke is so boundless that she has her face surgically altered to suit his taste – but still, he wants nothing to do with her. Ryosuke is more interested in the girlfriend of a yakuza boss. But when the boss finds out about their affair, he has Ryosuke’s little finger hacked off. Magically, the finger falls into Momoko’s hands, and she uses it to clone Ryosuke, so she can finally have him (or almost him) for herself – and that’s the first five minutes.\n\nWebsite\n\nCanada is awesome. Two film festivals and both featuring lots of excellent films! The first Canadian film festival I’m thinking about is the Toronto International Film Festival which had a plethora of great titles and that one finished yesterday. The second film festival I’m thinking about is The Vancouver International Film Festival which kicks off on September 25th and finishes on October 10th. It features a lot of Japanese films and Tony Rayns has written up about them.\n\nAs ever, the titles link to the festival pages which have more information such as times and prices and fuller descriptions.\n\nThe Features:\n\nSharing\n\nJapanese: Sharing\n\nRomaji: Sharing\n\nRunning Time: 94 mins.\n\nDirector: Makoto Shinozaki\n\nWriter: Makoto Shinozaki, Zenzo Sakai (Screenplay),\n\nStarring: Asuka Hinoi, Kinuo Yamada, Ryudai Takahashi, Tomoki Kimura, Kumi Hyodo, Takuji Suzuki,\n\nIt’s easy to dismiss Japanese entertainment as production committee driven adaptations on novels. This is original and it looks like it could be a great psychological piece what with the festival sites description of being Cronenberg-like. Kinuwo Yamada is an interesting actress who has appeared in Villain (2010), Confessions (2010) and There’s Nothing to Be Afraid of (2013).\n\nEiko (Kinuo) is a psychology teacher in a university. She lost her husband in the 2011 earthquake and tsunami and this pushes her to research cases of individuals who claim to have had precognitive dreams about the disaster. One of her students, Kaoru (Asuka), is a member of the drama club, and is writing a stage a play about the disaster. The two become so engaged in their projects that it pushes friends and colleagues away from them as they become more extreme n their work…\n\nDisconcerto (English Title) / Rhapsody in front of Mahoro Station (literal title)\n\nJapanese: まほろ 駅前 狂騒曲\n\nRomaji: Mahoro Ekimae Kyousoukyoku\n\nRunning Time: 124 mins.\n\nDirector: Tatsushi Omori\n\nWriter: Tatsushi Omori, Hikaru Kurozumi (Screenplay), Shion Miura (Original Novel),\n\nStarring: Eita, Ryuhei Matsuda, Yoko Maki, Masatoshi Nagase, Kengo Kora, Maro Akaji, Nao Omori, Miku Iwasaki, Shohei Uno, Hirofumi Arai, Masaki Miura, Tomoko Naraoka,\n\nDirector Tatsushi Omori had a strong year in 2013 with his film, The Ravine of Goodbye, and switches tones with this laid back title. He reunites with his leading lady from that film, Yoko Maki, and teams her up with two of Japan’s most talented young actors, Eita and Ryuhei Matsuda. This is the sequel film which was the sequel of a television series which was based on the novel of Shion Miura. Tony Rayns calls this, “a package of unsinkable charm!,” and he knows his stuff.\n\nTada (Eita) runs a “benriya” – a do-it-all service – in front of the fictional Mahoro Station n Tokyo. He is optimistic unlike his friend Gyoten (Matsuda) who is cynical. The two blunder through various assignments but when people and events from Gyoten’s past show up their friendship is pushed to breaking point…\n\nOw\n\nJapanese: 丸\n\nRomaji: Maru\n\nRunning Time: 89 mins.\n\nDirector: Yohei Suzuki\n\nWriter: Yohei Suzuki, Yukiko Koyama (Screenplay),\n\nStarring: Kaoru Iida, Masatoshi Kihara, Shu Ikeda, Sari Kaneko, Hitomi Karube, Rock Murakai, Shoji Omiya, Shigeko Tanaka\n\nVancouver usually has at least one strong indie title and this is it, a scii mystery with politics mixed in.\n\nTetsuo is unemployed and stuck in his famiy home with his girlfriend Yuriko. Things seem bad when he finds out that his father lost his job a month ago but they get weirder and even tragic when a mysterious orb descends from the sky, infiltrates the house and starts scrambling the brains of anyone near it. A police investigation ends in chaos and it is left to a reporter named Deguchi to discover just what is going on!\n\nThe Furthest End Awaits\n\nJapanese: さいはてにて−かけがえのない場所−\n\nRomaji: Saihate nite – Kakegae no Nai Basho\n\nRunning Time: 118 mins.\n\nDirector: Chiang Hsiu-Chiung\n\nWriter: Nako Kakinoki (Screenplay),\n\nStarring: Hiromi Nagasaku, Nozomi Sasaki, Hiyori Sakurada, Masatoshi Nagase, Sakurada Hiyori, Kaisei Hotamori, Asami Usuda, Issei Ogata, Jun Murakami, Masatoshi Nagase, Miyoko Asada\n\nThe Furthest End Awaits is set in Japan yet and directed by Taiwanese director Chiang Hsiu Chiung, Tony Rayns describes it as “a high benchmark for films about female solidarity.” Chiang has acted in films and worked as an assistant to Hou Hsia- Hsien. This is her first fiction feature. It’s not released in Japan yet and I’m going to see it at the London Film Festival!\n\nMisaki Yoshida (Nagasaku) runs a coffee shop in Tokyo. When she finds out that her father has disappeared, she heads back to her family’s hometown in the Nodo Peninsula, on the Sea of Japan. She finds that he has left an old family boathouse and a lot of debts. In order to clear the debts Misaki decides to turn the boathouse into a café and it attracts many locals such as Eriko Yamazaki (Sasaki), a single mother with two children and a caberet singer. The two women forge a friendship with each other.\n\nThe Vancouver Asahi\n\nJapanese: バンクーバーの朝日\n\nRomaji: Vancouver no Asahi\n\nRunning Time: 130 mins.\n\nDirector: Yuya Ishii\n\nWriter: Satoko Okudera (Screenplay),\n\nStarring: Satoshi Tsumabuki, Kazuya Kamenashi, Mitsuki Takahata, Aoi Miyazaki, Ryo Katsuji, Yusuke Kamiji, Sosuke Ikematsu, Shihori Kanjiya, Eri Ishida, Koichi Sato,\n\nVancouver scoop the film world again with another film not yet released in Japan and it’s thanks to the fact that they have supported the director, Yuya Ishii since his earliest films. Regular followers of this blog will know that I have reviewed his films Sawako Decides, Mitsuko Delivers, and The Great Passage and found all but one to be wonderful, full of dry comedy based on observational humour. This looks like a mix of that with more serious drama based on the immigrant experience. The screenplay is by Satoko Okudera, scribe for the wonderful The Wolf Children. I bet another reason Vancouver got the film s because it’s set in the city! The lead actor is Satoshi Tsumabuki, a great talent who can completely change his performances with the roles he is given as seen in For Love’s Sake, Villain, Judge! and more. No trailer but here’s a new report with clips:\n\nVancouver in the 1930’s had a Japantown, a place near the docks where sailors and immigrants lived. The children of these immigrants form a baseball team named Asahi. Despite being beaten by their Caucasian rivals they keep playing and get better. They endure racism and prejudice but things get worse when Japan goes to war with the US…\n\nThe Tale of Princess Kaguya\n\nJapanese: かぐや 姫 の 物語\n\nRomaji: Kaguya Hime no Monogatari\n\nRunning Time: 137 mins.\n\nDirector: Isao Takahata\n\nWriter: Isao Takahata, Riko Sakaguchi (Screenplay)\n\nStarring: Aki Asakura (Kaguya), Kengo Kora (Sutemaru), Nobuko Miyamoto (Ouno), Takeo Chii (Okina)\n\nThe Tale of Princess Kaguya has been touring film festivals since last year. It is by Studio Ghibli co-founder Isao Takahata, writer and director of Only Yesterday, Pom Poko, Grave of the Fireflies and Little Norse Prince Valiant. It’s based on a traditional Japanese story where a newborn girl is discovered in a luminous stalk of bamboo and she brings joy to an elderly woodcutter and his wife. She quickly grows into a beautiful and talented young woman but finds the demands of the world too much…\n\nThe Horses of Fukushima\n\nJapanese: 祭の馬\n\nRomaji: Matsuri no Uma\n\nRunning Time: 74 mins.\n\nDirector: Yoju Matsubayashi\n\nWriter: N/A\n\nStarring: N/A\n\nWhile filming a documentary, Memories of the Lost Landscape, director Yoju Matsubayashi came across a stable of injured horses in the exclusion zone of Fukushima, this after the Great East Japan Earthquake and reactor meltdown at the power plant. He became fascinated with a failed steeplechaser named Miller’s Quest and charted the horse’s recovery. Tony Rayn’s states: “Of all the many Fukushima documentaries of the last three years, this is the most unexpected, and probably the most moving.”\n\nThe Short Films and Anime:\n\nThe one short film is the 28 minute, Niagara, a film written and directed by Chie Hayakawa and starring Saki Itami Keita Hoshino, Masako Kawachi and Junji Sanechika. The film is “excellent,” according to Tony Rayns, who goes on to state that, “film centres on the moment that a young woman (who has grown up thinking she’s an orphan) learns for the first time to see… and to start living.” It screens with The Horses of Fukushima.\n\nAmazing Anime\n\nAs is usually the case with Vancouver there are a lot of animated short films that show indie anime in Japan is alive and well even if the commercial industry is struggling to create new content that can hook more sophisticated and demanding audiences. There is also a lot of female talent on offer, a trend that IS slowly happening in mainstream anime!\n\nTitles range from an analysis on the state of old media in Newspaper (dir: Yoshinao Satoh, 7 mins), a documentary which takes a look at The Japan Times, a fantastic resource for news on Japan, to the icky sounding Anal Juice (dir: Sawako Kabuki, 3 mins), is about the dreams the director had when her lover left her – apparently he liked enemas…\n\nFear not, with the other shorts we are coming back into more normal territory with Rappa (Yuki Nakajima, 5 mins) which promises ninja action during a prison break (not nessarily featuring ninjas), White, Heat, Lights (dir: Takashi Nakajima, 11 mins), a series of vignettes about sunrises and sunsets, Soliton (dir: Isamu Hirabayashi), which featured at this year’s Berlin Film Festival and is a mediatation on the 2011 earthquake and tsunami as told by one man’s journey across varying terrain. There is Waiter (dir: Hajime Takahashi), which is described as A seriously weird animation which plays on two meanings of “wait”: “wait on (someone)” and “to wait (for something).” Yamada himself says “it might be a criticism of nuclear power.”\n\nOther shorts include the impressive looking and sounding Gyrø (dir: Yuki Kobayashi), a feminist protest against lazy men with a reggae score. De_Riria_Subasutaimu (dir: Shinsaku Hidaka, 13 mins), which, with its hospital location and a husband visiting his sick wife and going on a mental journey, reminds me of Silent Hill 2. The Small Garden (dir: Shunsuke Saito, 12 mins) is a good-looking sci-fi mystery about the origins of EVERYTHING! Awesome. Flower Bud (dir: Saki Nakano, 5 mins), is a short about touching and feeling and dreaming. Budding, Swelling (dir: Ryoya Usuha, 7 mins) is a CG short about the fine matter of material beings. Snow Hut (dir: Yoriko Mizushiri, 6 mins) is described as a sensual meditation on the snow in Kamakura and snowing.\n\nThat’s a strong line-up!\n\nGreetings from the still United Kingdom! I hope everyone is having a good weekend!\n\nThis week I posted about the Japanese films playing at the Vancouver International Film Festival and the release of Lesson of Evil from Third Window Films. I hope to tackle the films playing at the East Winds Film Festival and Tokyo International Film Festival. Maybe the London Korean Film Festival will get a mention.\n\nWith the onset of Autumn comes festival season. Plotting my trips to London for Raindance and the LFF involves visiting art galleries to see exhibitions. I’m hoping to catch The Wallace Collection. Autumn also means new anime and I announce my anime picks next week and you can read two previews here and here.\n\nIt’s a busy weekend with a few diamonds like Bon Lin!\n\nBon Lin\n\nJapanese: ぼんとリンちゃん\n\nRomaji: Bon to Lin chan\n\nRelease Date: September 20th, 2014 (Japan)\n\nRunning Time: 91 mins.\n\nDirector: Keiichi Kobayashi\n\nWriter: Keiichi Kobayashi (Screenplay),\n\nStarring: Ema Sakura, Mahiro Takasugi, Hakushu Togetsuan, Rino Higa, Kaho Tsukioka, Takayuki Suzuki,\n\nThe writer/director of About a Pink Sky (2012) is back with another youth picture which will play at this year’s Tokyo International Film Festival. I should get around to watching About a Pink Sky!\n\nNatsuko Yotsuya (Sakura) is a teenage girl who is also known as Bon and she has a friend named Miyu. Bon is from a small town but Miyu lives in Tokyo with her boyfriend. When Natsuko finds out that Miyu is being abused by her partner, she heads to the big city to bring her homes. Tagging along is her childhood friend Rintaro Tomoda (Takasugi) who is also known as Lin. They meet a series of Otaku who help guide them through the streets of Tokyo to find Miyu.\n\nWebsite\n\nGajimaru Shokudo no Koi\n\nJapanese: がじまる 食堂の恋\n\nRomaji: Gajimaru Shokudo no Koi\n\nRelease Date: September 20th, 2014 (Japan)\n\nRunning Time: 98 mins.\n\nDirector: Keiichi Kobayashi\n\nWriter: Keiichi Kobayashi (Screenplay),\n\nStarring: Haru, Yu Koyanagi, Seika Taketomi, Dori Sakurada,\n\nFour men and women in Nago, Okinawa Prefecture, fall in love.

It has been a while.” Shiori looks up Reiko on the internet and discovers she was the victim of a stalker/murderer and she may be targeted next…\n\nWebsite\n\nZakurozaka no Adauchi\n\nJapanese: 柘榴坂の仇討\n\nRomaji: Zakurozaka no Adauchi\n\nRelease Date: September 20th, 2014 (Japan)\n\nRunning Time: 119 mins.\n\nDirector: Setsuro Wakamatsu\n\nWriter: Yasuo Hasegawa, Kenzaburo Iida, Hironobu Takamatsu (Screenplay), Jiro Asada (Original Novel),\n\nStarring: Hiroshi Abe, Kiichi Nakai, Ryoko Hirosue, Kichiemon Nakamura, Masahiro Takashima, Sei Matobu, Eisaku Yoshida, Tatsuya Fuji,\n\nIt is 1860 and the end of the Edo period.

Japanese fried chicken is better than American fried chicken? Why is there a black person involved? Does this add fried chicken authenticity? The poster and tagline could be interpreted as pretty racist! Dave Chapelle has something to say about this stereotype:\n\nA great excuse to show Dave Chapelle! Back to the film:\n\nAyane (Takahashi) works at a karaage store where food is fried in hot oil. She hates karaage and leaves home. When she comes back five years later she brings a girl named Shirley (Apuraku) who is the step-daughter of an ex-husband. Her family are furious but all that changes when Ayane takes part in a fried food festival called “Karaage Carnival” and proves to be a hit who can save her family’s store…\n\nWebsite\n\nYoju Mameshiba Bokyo hen\n\nJapanese: 幼獣マメシバ 望郷篇\n\nRomaji: Yoju Mameshiba Bokyo hen\n\nRelease Date: September 20th, 2014 (Japan)\n\nRunning Time: 95 mins.\n\nDirector: Toru Kamei\n\nWriter: Yuji Nagamori (Screenplay),\n\nStarring: Jiro Sato, Kai Shishido, You Takahashi, Seika Taketomi, Dakichi Sugawara,\n\nJiro (Sato) leaves home to escape his mother’s control and, with his pet dog Mameshiba Ichiro, moves to a seaside village.\n\nWebsite\n\nInagawa Ghost Story\n\nJapanese: 柘榴坂の仇討\n\nRomaji: Gekijouban Inagawa Kaidan Katari be\n\nRelease Date: September 20th, 2014 (Japan)\n\nRunning Time: 79 mins.\n\nDirector: Hajme Ohata,\n\nWriter: N/A\n\nStarring: Junji Inagawa, Mahiru Kurumizawa, Nobu Morioto, Takashi Omoto,\n\nThis looks a lot like POV: A Cursed Film (2012)… Takashi Shimizu is one of the proucers.\n\nJunji Inagawa is famous for telling ghost stories and so he is paired up with group of young ladies to re-enact a ghost story but weird things start happening on set…\n\nWebsite\n\nMister Home\n\nJapanese: ミスターホーム\n\nRomaji: Misuta- Ho-mu\n\nRelease Date: September 20th, 2014 (Japan)\n\nRunning Time: 70 mins.\n\nDirectors: Chihiro Ikeda, Takakazu Nagatomo, Ayumu Hasegawa, Wataru Kudo, Konpon Muneko,\n\nWriter: Chihiro Ikeda, Takakazu Nagatomo, Ayumu Hasegawa, Wataru Kudo, Konpon Muneko,\n\nStarring: Akane Higo, Shirori Sugioka, Gen Ogawa, Hideki Tasaa, Satoshi Kasajia Kumi Funakoshi, Yasuku Mori,\n\nThis is an ENBU cinema gig where new actors/staff work/train with directors already in the industry.\n\nIn this omnibus film, the inhabitants of a house in a small town are focussed on.

New anime!\n\nWe are almost at the end of the year and 2014 has had a summer season to die for what with awesome titles like Space Dandy, JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders, and Barakamon providing an excellent stream of entertainment, humour and great animation. Tokyo Ghoul was another standout as it compressed the manga to create an excellent action title. Expect series reviews for those titles!\n\nWith the help of Anime News Network and My Anime List, I got my autumn anime season previews published by Anime UK News at the beginning of the month (part one and two are up) and I found the experience to be an interesting mixture of comfort derived from doing something familiar and relief that the season doesn’t look too bad.\n\nAt first glance, the autumn season doesn’t look too stellar but I prefer to try avoid being negative because there are a few shows that have the right combination of staff and source material to make things work. There’s a strong fantasy element in this season and I’m willing to take a chance on quite a few titles.\n\nHere are the shows I am most excited by (this is a provisional list which will probably change as I drop and add shows):\n\nPsycho-Pass Season 2\n\nStaff\n\nChief Director: Katsuyuki Motohiro, Director: Naoyoshi Shiotani, Series Composition: Tow Ubukata Character Designer/ Chief Animation Director: Kyoji Asano, Original Character Design: Akira Amano Story Concept: Gen Urobuchi,\n\nVoice Actors and Characters\n\nKana Hanazawa as Akane Tsunemori, Kenji Nojima as Nobuchika Ginoza, Shizuka Itou as Yayoi Kunizuka, Keiji Fujiwara as Sakuya Tougane, Ayane Sakura as Mika Shimotsuki, Masumi Asano as Risa Aoyanagi,\n\nStudio: Tatsunoko Production\n\nWebsite\n\nSynopsis\n\nAt the end of the last season, detective Akane Tsunemori discovered the true nature of the Sybil System and due to her belief in legal order chooses to obey the system. She now takes the head of her department and takes command of a new set of enforcers. As she transitions into her role a new criminal looks set to challenge society.\n\nI really enjoyed the first Psycho-Pass and even went as far as to rewatch it quite recently. It had big ideas and themes and a dystopian setting all of which were thought-provoking and that was mostly thanks to the series’ antagonist, Makishima Shogo (I cannot remember the last time I was so charmed by a serial killer!) and the ending was so cynical and open that it invited another season. Well we’re getting it (plus a movie).\n\nPsycho-Pass Season 2 lacks the presence of original creator Gen Urobuchi which may be a good thing. I have watched most of the new shows which he has created and/or written and I have been underwhelmed by them. The man replacing him is Tow Ubukata, an experienced writer who was behind Le Chevalier d’Eon and Mardock Scramble. He is also in charge of the writing for Ghost in the Shell: Arise. The rest of the staff are familiar names who have worked on a lot of Production I.G titles I like. Speaking of I.G, they have been replaced as the animation studio for this title. Perhaps Production I.G is focussing on the Psycho-Pass film that is currently being made. I’m eagerly waiting for the second season plus I want to see if Akane Tsunemori can take down Sibyl.\n\nDonten ni Warau (Laughing Under the Clouds)\n\nStaff\n\nDirector: Hiroshi Haraguchi, Series Composition: Yuuya Takahashi, Character Designer: Takao Maki, Original Creator: Kemuri Karakara, Music: Shuichiro Fukuhiro,\n\nVoice Actors and Characters\n\nTsubasa Yonaga as Chutaro Kumo, Yuichi Nakamura as Tenka Kumo, Yuuki Kaji as Soramaru Kumo, Mamiko Noto as Nishiki,\n\nStudio: Dogakobo\n\nWebsite\n\nSynopsis\n\nThe story takes place during the Meiji era. As Japan modernises those known as samurai are slowly fading away into the pages of history. However, there are those who will not go without a fight and because of them the crime rates are increasing. The government decides to create an inescapable prison on a lake which is only accessible by water. Three boys of the Kumo family are assigned to transport the criminals to their new “home”.\n\nDonten ni Warau is based on a popular shoujo manga and features a lot of ikemen and what seems to be a heavy fantasy element. I’m willing to give this a go despite knowing nothing about it and the premise being hardly unique. The animation studio is Dogakobo, a group responsible for some awful harem anime and the lovely Natsuyuki Rendezvous.\n\nGugure! Kokkuri-san\n\nStaff\n\nDirector: Yoshimasa Hiraike, Original Creator: Midori Endo, Character Designer: Miwa Oshima,\n\nVoice Actors and Characters\n\nRyou Hirohashi as Kohina Ichimatsu, Daisuke Ono as Kokkuri-san, Jouji Nakata as Shigaraki, Takahiro Sakurai as Inugami,\n\nStudio: TMS Entertainment\n\nWebsite\n\nSynopsis\n\nA little girl named Kohina accidentally summons a Kokkuri-san, a low-ranking ghost in Japanese folklore. The Kokkuri-san just happens to be a handsome, young man with white hair. When he sees her terrible eating habit of consuming cup ramen for every meal he decides he wants to protect her.\n\nI’m looking for a simple comedy to enjoy. I do not expect this to be as memorable as Barakamon but I do expect to get a few laughs from it much in the way that I did with Kill Me Baby.\n\nAmagi Brilliant Park\n\nStaff\n\nDirector: Yasuhiro Takemoto, Series Composition: Fumihiko Shimo, Character Designer: Miku Kadowaki, Original Creator: Shoji Gatoh, Music: Shinkichi Mitsumune,\n\nVoice Actors and Characters\n\nKouki Uchiyama as Seiya Kanie, Ai Kakuma as Isuzu Sento, Kana Hanazawa as Satomi Murano, Tomoyo Kurosawa as Sylphy,\n\nStudio: Kyoto Animation\n\nWebsite\n\nSynopsis\n\nSeiya Kanie is a high school student blessed with good looks, athletic abilities and a massive intellect. This is probably why he’s kidnapped by a mysterious transfer student who carries a musket. He is taken to a deserted amusement park, Amagi Brilliant Park, which will close unless it can attract 100,000 visitors in two weeks. Seiya is in a battle to bring his brains to the business world and make Amagi Brilliant Park a success!\n\nThe PV won me over. Kyoto Animation are bringing back the team who adapted Full Metal Panic to create a new comedy anime. Alas, that was a show which was popular back when I was in high school and totally passed me by. The premise sounds silly enough to visit for a few laughs and since this is Kyoto Animation, it’ll look great.\n\nShingeki no Bahamut: Genesis\n\nStaff\n\nDirector: Keiichi Satou, Series Composition: Keiichi Hasegawa, Character Designer: Naoyuki Onda, Original Creator: Cygames, Music: Yoshhiro Ike,\n\nVoice Actors and Characters\n\nShuuichi Ikeda as Walfrid, Ayako Kawasumi as Reesha, Yoko Hikasa as Anne Murano, Mamoru Miyano as Roux,\n\nStudio: MAPPA\n\nWebsite\n\nOne look at that promotional video and I was sold. In a season with strong fantasy titles, this looks absolutely top notch in terms of visuals. MAPPA are currently dazzling people with their animation on Zankyou no Terror and it looks like they are continuing to put the money on the screen with some sparkly and fluid looking visuals, distinctive characters and settings that mark this as THE fantasy show of the season. It is based on a card game which may be something to make one cautious but the director is Keiichi Satou, and he did sterling work on Tiger & Bunny.\n\nSave the best until last!\n\nKiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu\n\nStaff\n\nDirector: Kenichi Shimizu, Series Composition: Shoji Yonemura, Character Designer: Tadashi Hiramatsu, Original Creator: Hitoshi Iwaaki, Music: Ken Arai,\n\nVoice Actors and Characters\n\nNobunaga Shimazak as Shinichi Izumi, Aya Hirano as Migi, Kana Hanazawa as Satomi Murano, Miyuki Sawashiro as Kana Kimishima,\n\nStudio: Madhouse\n\nWebsite\n\nSynopsis\n\nHigh school student Izumi Shinichi lives a normal life with his mother and father in Tokyo but that all stops when worm-like aliens called Parasytes invade Earth. They plunge from the sky and take over the brains of humans by entering through the ears and nose. Shinichi was targeted while he slept but since he was wearing headphones, the Parasyte was forced to burrow into his arm and occupy his right hand and settled there.\n\nShinichi wakes up horrified and finds that the alien has its own intellect and personality and it is named Migi. The two join forces when they become targeted by other Parasytes who want to destroy Shinichi because he can still think for himself. The two battle other Parasytes and try to save humans from being snacks for aliens!\n\nEvery season has at least one show which is a heavy hitter for committed anime fans from the old school who remember a time before the poisonous mixture (to me, objectively it might be good) of moe and slice-of-life dominated everything and this is it for me. It’s based on a manga by Hitoshi Iwaaki which is held in high regard (I haven’t read it but I keep hearing great things).\n\nOne note of caution is that the director is new to the game although he has worked on titles like Monster and Roujin Z so I’m willing to believe he can do the job. The character designs come from Tadashi Hiramatsu who will forever be remembered by me for his work on Dennou Coil and Moldiver. The writing looks to be in good hands because Shoji Yonemura has written on great series like Berserk, an adaptation of a long-running scary manga.\n\nThe promotional art and videos released so far look fantastic and it’s animated by Madhouse, the guys behind great titles like Paranoia Agent and Black Lagoon. Their recent batch of shows haven’t really grabbed me (the premise of Photo Kano made it a non-starter and Sunday Without God was too uneven) but I’m reassured by what I am seeing here. With 24 episodes already guaranteed, we could see something of real quality with this one.\n\nAaaaand that’s about it for the anime I’ll be watching. Below is a gallery full of the key images from most of the shows airing this season:\n\nClick to view slideshow.\n\nThe Raindance Film Festival has launched and I’ll be heading there next week – commitments at work mean that I cannot take a holiday sooner (not that I’m complaining because I’m thankful that I have a job!) and I’ll miss out on some of the Japanese films that are screening between now and when I get to London. I’ll be able to see the titles I miss when I get my signed copy of the New Directors From Japan DVD! Enough bragging.\n\nI didn’t watch any films this week – I’m still trying to review about a dozen or more… I have watched lots of anime. Zankyou no Terror, Space Dandy, Barakamon, Shirogane no Ishi Argovellon. Great stuff. The only thing I posted about this week is the anime I’ll be watching in the autumn season.\n\nWhat is released in Japan this weekend?\n\nZero\n\nJapanese Title: 劇場版 零 ゼロ\n\nRomaji: Gekijouban Rei Zero\n\nRelease Date: September 26th, 2014 (Japan)\n\nRunning Time: N/A\n\nDirector: Mari Asato\n\nWriter: Mari Asato (Screenplay), Eiji Ohtsuka (Original Novel)\n\nStarring: Ayumi Nakajo, Aoi Morikawa, Fujiko Kojima, Jun Miho, Karen Miyama, Noriko Nakagoshi, Kasumi Yamaya, Minori Hagiwara, Yuri Nakamura, Kodai Asaka,\n\nI previewed this film last month and I’m looking forward to it because it adapts a favourite video game of mine, Fatal Frame. The next Fatal Frame game is released today. The film which was released yesterday, has been directed by Mari Asato, a female director who has been mentioned here on this blog thanks to films like Bilocation (2014) and Ju-on: Black Ghost (2009) and she looks to have captured the horror atmosphere here!\n\nAt an old girl’s school located in the heart of the countryside, student Aya Tsukimori (Ayami Nakajo) becomes part of an ancient “cursed incantation” and is trapped in her school dormitory. At the same time, students begin to report ghost sighting around the school while others disappear and are later discovered to have drowned in mysterious circumstances. Aya attempts to contact fellow pupil Michi Kazato (Aoi Morikawa) who begins investigating the disappearances of her classmates and the two become wrapped up in a deadly mystery…\n\nWebsite\n\nMother\n\nJapanese: マザー\n\nRomaji: Maza\n\nRelease Date: September 27th, 2014 (Japan)\n\nRunning Time: 83 mins.\n\nDirector: Kazuo Umezu\n\nWriter: Kazuo Umezu (Screenplay),\n\nStarring: Ainosuke Kataoka, Mimi Maihane, Shoko Nakagawa, Kimie Shingyuji,\n\nNothing to do with the Korean film which reviewed ages ago. This is an autobiographical title by Kazuo Umezu. Horror manga fans will know him as the guy behind Drifting Classroom (heart-breaking) and Orochi (intriguing) among others.\n\nSakura Wakakusa (Maihane) is editing the autobiography of Kazuo Umezu (Kataoka) and heads to the mountain village to research more about his past knowing that his mother, Ichie (Shingyoji) had a huge influence on Umezu. Whilst looking around, she finds herself attacked by strange phenomenon and it seems to come from Ichie who should be dead and in the ground!\n\nWebsite\n\nDanger Dolls\n\nJapanese: 少女は異世界で戦った\n\nRomaji: Shojo wa Isekai de Tatakatta\n\nRelease Date: September 27th, 2014 (Japan)\n\nRunning Time: 97 mins.\n\nDirectors: Shusuke Kaneko\n\nWriter: Hirotoshi Kobayashi (Screenplay)\n\nStarring: Rumi Hanai, Rina Takeda, Kayano Masuyama, Nana Seino, Mao mita, Kazuki Namioka, Mana Sakura, Noburo Kaneko, Kohki Okada,\n\nDanger Dolls is a sci-fi tale about a bunch of girls who work by day as defenders of our reality by fighting with aliens from a parallel world with swords and by going undercover as idols!

It’s a short about three sisters who battle some evil organisation named “Black Inc.” I think…\n\nWebsite\n\nFinal Fantasy XV was shown at the recent Tokyo Game Show and I think it looks great buuuut… it has been in development for nearly TEN YEARS in which time is has had a reboot and new director in the shape of Hajime Tabata (director of the excellent Crisis Core). These delays and makes me think of the troubled development and reception of Final Fantasy XIII.\n\nWhat I remember about the launch of Final Fantasy XIII back in February 2011 was the critical reception of the game with websites and publications such as Edge magazine giving it 5 out of 10. This for a major entry in the main franchise! Could the poor scores have been justified? I was curious and bought the game.\n\nMy overall experience was mixed. Final Fantasy XIII starts off disastrously as it gracelessly explains gameplay mechanics and a bloated and clichéd narrative full of crystals, authoritarian governments, destinies being fought and gods to be challenged, cackling bad guys and heroes full of self-doubt.\n\nFor what seems like too long and for the sake of a badly written chase narrative, the game sends players scurrying around a long series of tutorials and cutscenes that are never fun to endure. The player is forced down a series of palette-swapped corridors and made to battle identikit enemies as the game sluggishly hands out combat techniques and plot developments. Interaction with the world and exploration take a back seat to dull battles interspersed with watching dull films. The grand narrative and combat system don’t kick in soon enough to save events and the game comes too close to being about as interactive as viewing a landscape painting in an art gallery. The feeling hangs over events because there are few shops and mini-games, no villages to explore or communities to interact with and fewer people to talk to. When you do talk to non-player characters they utter bland short lines. It’s easy to see removing RPG ephemera and mechanics like item management and pointless quests/conversations as a deconstruction of the genre as some claim but it makes the game less interesting to venture into.\n\nAt times it feels like the developers do not trust the player enough to let them explore the gameplay and the world and resorts to lecturing them slowly. Indeed it feels like it takes nearly half the game before you can fully exploit the intricate combat system and you can actually start levelling up characters the way you want to.\n\nThis only happens in chapter 11 of 13!\n\nIt is here, on a world called Pulse, where you do get to fully exploit your summons and your character’s classes and can start tailoring your combat teams. The game opens up not least because Pulse is more of an open world. Players can explore wherever they want and battle whatever they see.\n\nIt is here that the boredom is shed and a sense of wonder starts to grow along with the freedom granted to the player in pushing the story and characters forward at the speed they want. All of those dull hours training were for this moment when you are let loose and a sense of the grand adventure finally comes to life. It is also here the feeling that training could have been cut short comes to life showing up just how bad the game’s design is in the early stages. It’s hard not to escape the feeling that you have wasted tens of hours of your life… When you do get to this point, the sense of an epic narrative, a traditional element of Final Fantasy, is fully realised by the scenery and freedom to explore.\n\nWorld building has always been a key strength of Square Enix and it works here for the most part. The Final Fantasy series usually provides a sense that players control a person travelling through unique places with unique cultures and histories all intermingling to make a rich and compelling story and it is hard to deny that the world of FFXIII is well-realised and stunning to look at.\n\nThe graphics, music, UI, on-screen menus and are sexy and slick and beautifully realised – probably the only menu in an RPG I would keep accessing just to see the character animations. The physical world is beautiful and varied, made up of grasslands, forests, high-tech cities in the sky.\n\nI love the look and music for certain areas like Gapra Whitewoods, Sunleth Waterscape.\n\nThe locations are gorgeous to look at, colourful and evocative with rich and varied colour palettes. The soundtrack for both is an ambient electronic onee held down by a gentle percussion, with an insistent piano melody and ghostly female vocals provided by Mina, which weave in and out. Take a listen.\n\nPulse is a vast and intriguing area to explore, a huge rolling glass plain with caves and streams, cliffs that hang into an abyssal drops, jungle mazes and frosty mist-covered hillsides and the entire place teems with life as multitudes of creatures co-exist and wander around. With the narrative disappearing, players can engage in hunting quests, clamber over the ruins of an ancient civilisation thick with packs of Borbear who dance around in rhythm, battle Feral Behemoths that stalk the plains, and gape at the herds of Adamantoise, creatures the size of mountains that can wipe out the player and their party with two stamps of a foot.\n\nThe graphics and music provide a brilliant skin for these locations and the combat which is fast, flexible, and fun flourishes. It is here that the game provides a lot of depth thanks to the interlinking of classes and skills and battle formations.\n\nOnce I was able to get to Pulse and experience the full flow of combat, get over my problems with the world and story and build the characters I wanted I enjoyed the game a lot.\n\nThe player effectively trains their team of six and manages their tactics in battle and through canny timing and playing with formations and the stagger and active time battle gauges. The battles became fascinating matches full of jabs, looking for an opening to exploit in the opponents defence so the stagger gauge hits max allowing the player to then pummel away at the enemy and do massive with glee and watch their health disappear quickly.\n\nThe main character is supported by two others and they can be switched in and out of teams with ease. As a result there are a lot of roles and attendant skills that provide great depth. It was exciting to tailor different formations and tactics both before battle and during it, quickly switching between options as the flow of battle alters. It became a battle of wits to master situations and it became faster and faster the better the payer became. One could tackle humongous enemies by rolling into battle with the main character’s class set a Commando (damage dealing) or Ravager (offensive magic) with support from a Saboteur (debuffs) and Synergist (buffs) and switch formations to something like Evened Odds (Saboteur, Synergist, Medic) if things go badly and to Relentless Assault (Commando, Ravager, Ravager) when you want to press on the offensive and fling spells at the poor monsters.\n\nThe last paragraph was boring and confusing to read so let me show you some combat.\n\nAnd this is a reminder that as good as Bioware and Bethesda are at making RPGs, they don’t have the style of Square Enix. The UI flows in and out smoothly, character fly around the screen and it is so so satisfying seeing the fireworks happening as demonstrated by the acrobatics of Lightning’s Army Of One.\n\nAs much as I dislike the script this feeling was exacerbated by the poor opening. By the end of the game I enjoyed the different characters and their relationships building up. As badly written as a lot of it was, I enjoyed guiding Sahz and Vanille in slogging through the gorgeous Sunleth Waterscape, scrambling their way through forests and skirting gorgeous lake shores, all the while, blasting Flans with magic before allowing themselves to relax in the pleasure town of Nautilus. I enjoyed playing as Lightning, dragging Hope through the Gapra Whitewoods, a sparkling crystalline forest shrouded in eternal twilight. Lightning toughens Hope up (mostly through my relentless grinding which saw me wallop the boss easily) in the chilly confines of their location, and she opens up as a character, changing from a completely unforgiving and harsh soldier to tough older sister as they fought against monsters and evaded hostile government forces.\n\nLightning became my favourite FF protagonist not named Zack Fair because of her no-nonsense attitude. She speaks as much with her fists and has little patience for most of the characters who fulfil the rote role of troubled male who lost his mother, hyper young girl, mouthy braggart types and grumpy old men.\n\nShe is cold and disciplined she just wants to get her job done and isn’t afraid of anything or anyone. She has the smarts, confidence, and the guts to do whatever it takes and it made a change to play her, a grown woman, rather than a bland male lead with amnesia or a little girl. She is so brilliant she starred in her own game.\n\nShe would have been great in a world as complex as Final Fantasy XII which still remains my favourite entry in the series, a game with a rich world and racial diversity. I’m a fan of the games that take place in the world of Ivalice (Final Fantasy XII and Tactics Advance and Vagrant Story). Here’s an interesting podcast from Retronauts discussing the work of Yasumi Matsuno and his Final Fantasy games.\n\nOnce you get past the initial opening and get to the combat system FFXIII becomes a lot more fun.\n\nThis is a Final Fantasy title but feels so different from previous entries in the main series. The worlds and lore of different Final Fantasy games are usually beautiful and complicated and it is no different here but the opening 10 – 20 hours are truly awful – really game breaking for those who have no patience. Slog past it and get to test out the full battle system in the open world setting of Pulse, and the game opens up, the art and animation come to life and the music soars. The poor scores and vitriol it received were a little much when you lose the first part, perhaps 5 wasn’t the wrong score to give. My score would be 7.\n\nAll images are from the Final Fantasy Wiki.\n\nI’m back from London and the Raindance Film Festival and I am in the process of writing lots of reviews for the blog and other websites like Anime UK News and so there is a lot for me to write about like Fuku-chan of Fukufuku Flats, How Selfish I Am!, The Light Shines Only There, and… the final film I saw at Raindance, And the Mud Ship Sails Away. I talked to the director of that film and also got to interview the director Yosuke Fujita, the genius behind Fuku-chan, a segment in Quirky Guys and Gals, and Fine, Totally Fine, one of my favourite comedies of the last few years and tell him how much I liked it!\n\nWhilst in London, I went to the Courtauld Gallery to see their collection and to see my favourite Impressionist painting, A Bar at the Folies-Bergere. I also went the Japan Centre (something that has become a routine).\n\nBut I had to go to work the next day so all of those reviews are on the back-burner for now. The only thing I posted about this week was Final Fantasy XIII, a post that is long overdue and I have written lots of notes for months ago.\n\nWhat’s released this weekend in Japan?\n\nA Samurai Chronicle\n\nJapanese: 蜩の記\n\nRomaji: Higurashi no Ki\n\nRelease Date: October 04th, 2014 (Japan)\n\nRunning Time: 129 mins.\n\nDirector: Takashi Koizumi\n\nWriter: Takashi Koizumi, Motomu Furuta (Screenplay), Rin Hamuro (Original Novel)\n\nStarring: Koji Yakusho, Junichi Okada, Maki Horikita, Mieko Harada,\n\nBased on Rin Hamurao’s Naoki award winning prize.\n\nToda Shuukoku was arrested for having an affair with one of his feudal lord’s concubines and murdering a person who exposed the scandal.

Anyway, this is about a bunch of ikemen high school boys who play a game called Kabaddi and that originates in India, apparently. It’s a contact sport halfway between British Bulldog and wrestling.

It felt soulless despite the few good bits, an example of a film pillaging from other titles and adhering to standard tropes to make a passable title.\n\nThe handsome Hyeong-Do (So Ji-Sub) is the titular company man. He is a dedicated worker and a rising star at his metal trading company. Except that metal trading is a front for the organisation. What Heyong-Do’s company provides is assassins. The men and women who work in the office are highly trained killers and Heyong-Do is being groomed by the chief to be a manager.\n\nThings go awry when he works with a temporary hire, a young man named Hyun-Yi who will act as an assassin and then be disposed of when the mission is completed. Hyun-Yi is shocked by the betrayal and his innocence shines through as his end at the hands of Hyeong-Do approaches. Hyun-Yi asks for a final favour from Heyong-Do which is to give money to his family. Heyong-Yi is moved by the plea and this leads him to come into contact with Su-Yeon (Lee Mi-Yeon), the mother of Hyun-Yi, a woman who affects Hyeong-Do on a deep level…\n\nShe’s a former singer who had two kids while still young and had to take up work in a garment factory after quitting her music career. It turns out that she was Hyeong-Do’s favourite singer while he was in school. He feels an attraction to her and this, mixed in with guilt over Hyun-Yi’s fate, leads him to start a relationship with Su-Yeoni. This means trips with her to the countryside and this opens up his world and he sees that there is more to life than the brutality peddled by his bosses and this brings him into conflict with his old job…\n\nA Company Man does some things rather well. It quickly establishes the office culture with ease as we see neatly dressed men and women sat in their cubicles working behind cluttered desks which house automatic weapons. Everyday office stationary has some deadly function such as piano wire and knives hidden in watches and suit jackets, folders concealing automatic weapons and a trolley stacked with papers and ammunition for weapons that goes from cubicle to cubicle. In the filing room are the numerous shelves containing contracts for hits, a shooting range and knife-fighting arena. Each of these areas has a secretary and a boss in a glass cubicle who can watch over everything. It’s a triumph of production design which makes an evocative environment that describes a world where function and form are united to pursue the art of killing. It is the anonymous glass and steel and grey carpets we associate with such workplaces but with a deadly twist. The team spirit seems high, people chat at water coolers and some laze around when the boss is absent, but the few characters we get to know are actually competing fiercely with each other for a promotion which Heyong-Do wins.\n\nIt has been a hard-fought thing for Hyeong-Do and behind the ice cold façade we see that this is something that is wearing him out. He goes out on the most horrific and risky missions, coldly murders people and arrives back at the office to slump behind his desk, write a report for an ungrateful boss who is less capable than him and then clock off at the end of the day and return to an apartment exhausted and bored since there is little to his personal life.\n\nIt is all familiar territory but that allows the viewer to acclimatise quickly. The problem is that once these elements are done, there’s nothing else original and novel that is left that defines the film.\n\nPeople who watch Korean films will find the film has a well-worn plot and narrative because it is derivative of a lot of other films. Indeed, it can be accused of being a clone of the far superior A Bittersweet Life(2005) but transposing the action to the world of office workers from that of gangsters. The protagonists from this film and A Bittersweet Life have the same lifestyle, apartment and fashion sense (there’s even a scene involving them ironing their suits in a bland room to get across the empty lifestyle!!!) and both go on the same journey for the same reasons and the same results happen only A Company Man lacks the humour and the outrageousness of the action scenes that A Bittersweet Life had. It lacks the tight scripting that provided an exploration of the revenge-thriller/neo-noir genres while plying the old tropes present for the viewer to engage with. It also lacks the emotional development for characters that hook a viewer.\n\nThe cast are given little to work with. Archetypes like a fatherly boss, a strong and upright single mother and surly teenage daughter abound and these are thinly sketched so while the actors are may be strong in their individual roles there is nothing that makes the characters memorable or unique and when they interact they say and do nothing totally exciting unless it is in the fights. Fatally, the film spaces the few fights out between long stretches of conversations which, while character specific and takng place in scenic locations, aren’t really that interesting and only serve to move the plot forward. When the dull characters speak dialogue which is rote stuff the film slows down tremendously and the tension seeps out.\n\nIf the characters suffer in the talking stakes, then the film comes to life in the fast-paced but few all-too brief action scenes. The film features some striking physical fights in tight environments where two men may grapple in nervy encounters that consist of short, sharp punches, grappling and submission holds. There is an outstanding close-quarters battle in a car where bullets zip through the interior as characters wrestle for a gun and this quickly turns into a knife fight where the flashing blade slashes the upholstery before the fighters take it outside for a high-stakes battle on a busy motorway. It is at moments like these when the film truly comes to life as the camera zips around with extremely quick movement and editing and fast paced pans that are familiar from other well-executed Korean action films.\n\nThe script’s failure to make any of the characters remotely emotionally engaging is a major disappointment that other Korean films typically avoid and this hamstrings the use of brutal violence. Why should we care about cardboard cutouts blasting each other?\n\nAlas, it is hard to care about the outcome when the characters are so two dimensional. Curiously I found the big-bang finale of the extended gunfight in the office rather distasteful due to the rather flat nature of the scene and the realistic nature of the violence. Perhaps endless news reports of shootings in America have had some impact on me but I suspect it’s because the fight lacks the spark and gratuitousness of other films to raise it above the familiar and the characters are dull, a complaint I have kept making.\n\nI love action films as other reviews like The Man From Nowhere shows but this was a disappointment. When watching A Company Man you will recognise that beneath the surface it is a film that lacks originality and the characters are dull so when they are not in fights the film struggles to be entertaining. It is a pretty film. The detailed, sleek and graceful cinematography makes the locations pleasing to look at for the most part but it is derivative of many other titles such as the neo-noir tales in the mould of Le Samurai (1967) and countless revenge thrillers that Korea excels at. There is no adventurous side to it, this is a precision piece of filmmaking that adheres to rules and conventions, takes from other films and has had the life sucked out of it to create a safe title.\n\n3/5\n\nHello, dear audience. I hope you are all well. The autumn anime season is in full swing and I have watched a lot of premieres for a lot of shows. I was very impressed with Parasyte, fun a blackly comic body horror, and Gugure! Kokuri-san a comedy that made me laugh more than I hoped for. It also had a really, really dark tone surrounding the loneliness of the characters. Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis was as action-packed as hoped. The biggest disappointment was Amagi Brilliant Park which didn’t make me laugh at all, plus a needless nude shot.\n\nIn terms of films, I had unexpected fun at work when I struck up a conversation with a lady from Hong Kong and we talked Wong Kar-Wai for quite a while. Moments like that make life fun. On the blog, I posted about the Korean action-thriller A Company Man and the UK release of Black Butler.\n\nNext week, I’ll be back in London for the BFI London Film Festival. The following day, I’ll be watching Black Butler!\n\nWhat is released this weekend?\n\nA Drop of the Grapevine\n\nJapanese: ぶどうのなみだ\n\nRomaji: Budou no Namida\n\nRelease Date: October 11th, 2014 (Japan)\n\nRunning Time: 117 mins.\n\nDirector: Yukiko Mishima\n\nWriter: Yukiko Mishima (Screenplay),\n\nStarring: Yo Oizumi, Yuko Ando, Shota Sometani, Kyoko Enami, Tomorowo Taguchi, Kitaro, Ren Osugi, Lily,\n\nAo (Oizumi) returns to back home to Sorachi, Hokkaido, to take over his father’s vineyard after many years away.

A glib comparison might be Short Cuts by Raymond Carver/Robert Altman on a smaller scale with a post-rock soundtrack but just as much darkness and more visual and aural dazzle.\n\nThe film is the culmination of a long collaboration between filmmaker Daigo Matsui and the band CreepHyp, this is the final result of a series music videos made over the last few years¹ based on a story originally conceived by CreepHyp’s frontman, Sekaikan Ozaki. The episodic nature of the original music videos is carried over to a feature film format and expanded upon as it draws everything together into a final product which acts a musical showcase for the band, a creative director, and a strong ensemble cast.\n\nThe film is told over the course of a few years and from multiple perspectives split between two girls and two guys, all of whom are scudding along the bottom of the Tokyo social scene.\n\nWe start off with Kumiko (Ando), a lonely girl working at a cosplay bar/brothel who pines after her ex-boyfriend (Onoue).\n\nKumiko is followed by Mie (Yamada), a mousy, introverted and put-upon office lady who adores CreeHyp, and has a Twitter addiction (@mieephyp0819 – yes, I write down Twitter handles in films) and a ticket to CreepHyp’s concert which she may miss because of problems at work.\n\nTsuda (Daito), the guy collecting tickets at the concert, is undergoing something of a meltdown as his beloved pop idol is about to retire.\n\nThe final, and longest sequence, involves a young homeless man named Rikuo (Ikematsu) who lives in two vans with a young woman (Kurokawa) who, due to a trauma in her past that has damaged her, refuses to speak.\n\nThe four stories weave together to create a sometimes funny but mostly tragic tales demonstrating the bleaker side of the Tokyo dream, all loneliness, frustration and desperation.\n\nThe theme of the film is desperation although it is not a word that the characters ever utter. Instead, Daigo Matsui takes the original series of stories, conventional when written on paper, and makes them unique by visually telling us everything about the character’s frustrations and problems while using CreepHyp’s music and physical presence to counterpoint and emphasise the emotions felt by the characters and the bleakness of their situations. This is most prominent in the earlier sections of the film which are the most visually and aurally compelling and fun.\n\nMatsui shoots Kumiko’s section (the most upbeat of the four) almost entirely in monochrome, an interesting technique which helps show her lonely routine of returning home to a cold, empty and cluttered apartment to prepare meals for herself and her absent ex-boyfriend. We see Kumiko struggling through a series of unfortunate, though blackly comic events which make her consider returning to her hometown. Upon hearing the music of CreepHyp, she reminisces over the good times she experienced after her arrival in Tokyo and meeting her boyfriend. At this point colour bursts onto the screen, as does the band, and through a montage we see a flashback happier times all scored to an exciting rock track that pulses with such energy it captures you and makes the heart race! It is impossible not to be caught up in her emotions and reminiscences and we hope she can pick herself up and get together with her ex!\n\nFor Mie’s section, Daigo expertly uses cross-cutting between CreepHyp’s preparation for a concert with the office drudgery Mie endures. Through Twitter messages flashed up as on-screen text we see her interior voice. She is totally psyched about going to their upcoming concert but her colleagues abuse her good-nature and meekness by piling work on her on the day of the concert. With her iPod charged and earphones in she goes about mind-numbing work and using Twitter to relay increasingly bitter complaints about colleagues who continually take advantage of her. Enduring criticisms over behaviour from colleagues she takes to eating her lunch in the staff toilet, something that seems not too unfamiliar to her. She addresses her work and colleagues in an increasingly passive-aggressive manner.\n\nMatsui cleverly contrasts the behind the scenes documentary feel of the section of CreepHyp’s rehearsals and colourful concert and with the deadening grey and artificial office world Mie inhabits. Both sections are shot with a languid pace at first but this pace picks up as the concert approaches and it is hard not to feel an insistent urge to root for Mie build, to tell her to just drop work and go see her favourite band. She shouldn’t be at work if it causes her as much heart-ache as we see and we desperately want her to get to the concert, a feeling fuelled by her increasingly hopeless Tweets like, “I lose followers the more I write,” which flash up on screen.\n\nIt builds to an emotionally powerful ending where Maho Yamada’s convincing acting and the lyrics of the band convey just how burnt out Mie is. Dissolves of the concert and close-ups of Yamada, who has been a picture of placidity in public in the office and rage in private, culminate in a moment when the emotional dam bursts. Throughout this section she has shown skill in modulating her emotions and it is heart-wrenching stuff to see her end!\n\nTsuda’s section is the shortest and yet arguably one of the bleakest. He has the look of an unabashed otaku who rarely interacts with others and when he does it is very awkwardly, a sort of hesitant nervousness which soon gives way to a hopeful smile before he reveals an uncouthness and anger that seems to be bred from a lack of human contact. He is an outsider and even seems bipolar in his behaviour since he is prone to sudden bursts of anger which sees him smash portable CD players up. His anger and frustration come from not being able to socialise with those around him and his only source of release is a pop idol he adores and who offers a source of happiness away from his loneliness. Following Mie, this is another example of how important music can be for people, especially those who struggle to communicate with others. Daigo shoots Tsuda’s section with flashbacks, flashforward, fest editing, sweeping pans and rapid cuts which heighten just how frantic Tsuda’s mindset is.\n\nWhere the film comes unstuck is with Rikuo’s story. It is presented in a fragmented way that combines monologues delivered straight to camera that are intercut with the wider story which is being told in flashback. Rikuo and the silent girl dance what becomes a dark and potentially dangerous game as he struggles to contain his anger and engages in physical and verbal acts of violence with her and other characters. Their connection with each other is complicated. He is impulsive, driven by his meagre circumstances to acts of spontaneous violence and affection. She refuses to open up to him and the two struggle to live in harmony despite their feelings for one another. Questions are raised such as why does the girl stay with him and while her story is teased out, viewers are left to wonder and guess at just what is happening. When the big reveal comes it is not totally unexpected but getting to it is not as thrilling. In the final segment, the film becomes far more mundane in terms of editing, shot composition and most, importantly of all, because all of the absence of the band. There is little music from them and the only appearance they make is a CD cover.\n\nCreatively, it is a brave decision to go against the tide of rest of the film but for this reviewer, well, I wanted more of the energy from the earlier parts of the film which were so enjoyable, the rush and excitement of fast cuts and excellent music, rather than a re-tread of another film which did the narrative better (clicking on this link would result in a massive spoiler) which I couldn’t help but think of. That written, the performances are still sympathetic in this part, with both Ikematsu and Kurokawa playing out a highly nuanced relationship full of violent affections and Daito impressively building upon his earlier nervous outsider role to become even scarier and desperate and lonely. Again, this one has another open ending which refuses to provide closure but assures us that life does go on.\n\nDesperate is probably the best way to sum up the lives of the characters. Without having to tell the audience or milk the script for melodrama, Matsui skilfully shows people desperate for love and better lives and it hurts to watch (especially Mie’s section!). The brave performances, the episodic narrative structure of the script and CreepHyp’s music transforms what could have been a conventional misery narrative into an urgent and, at times, oddly upbeat, film that crackles with creativity and passion for much of its running time. Even in the final section which didn’t hold me attention, there is a lot to think about and recommend it. Daigo Matsui shows that even in the darkness, there is some release whether it is through CreepHyp’s music or other people. Although the final segment is a comedown in terms of pace it demonstrates a pretty brave attitude from the director to his material, music and the actors. I want to watch the film again just to reassess certain things in the stories and I recommend it.\n\n4/5\n\nGosh, this review has gone on a bit.\n\nThe title of the film is a mouthful to say in Japanese and my teacher got a laugh out of my efforts!\n\nDaigo Matsui’s filmography mostly consists of adaptations of the gag manga Afro Tanaka (2012), Daily Lives of High School Boys (2013), and Sweet Poolside (2014). I guess those pay for films like this!\n\nCreepHyp are good but there are others I like more. I should do a post about my favourite Japanese rock groups – the ones I listen to when I write reviews.\n\n¹ For a taste of the film, you can watch the individual music videos here and others which feature the same actors but there are spoilers:\n\nBack from the BFI London Film Festival and two more films go on my huge backlog of reviews to write… Wednesday was all about The World of Kanako and The Furthest End Awaits, two massively different films and both awesome. I got to meet Tetsuya Nakashima and have my picture taken with him as well as ask some questions! On top of those two films, I also watched Black Butler on Friday and enjoyed a lot – Ayame Gouriki and Hiro Mizushima were both fantastic in bringing the characters to life. Next week I have to watch Annabelle and the week after I watch Ghostbusters. Is this review list going to ever be whittled down?\n\nI’ll get to it. I hope to have The World of Kanako, Fuku-chan the The Light Only Shines There done and posted in the next two weeks.\n\nAnyway, not much else this week except television like Shingeki no Bahamut, Parasyte (WHAT AN AWESOME SECOND EPISODE!), Gugure! Kokkuri-san (still very funny), and The Walking Dead which had an awesome episode to open up series five with.\n\nThis week I posted a review of the film How Selfish I Am! Which I saw at the Raindance Film Festival.\n\nWhat’s released in Japan this weekend?\n\nGod Tongue: Kiss Pressure Game The Movie 2 Psychic Love\n\nJapanese: ゴッドタン キス我慢選手権 THE MOVIE2 サイキック・ラブ\n\nRomaji: Goddotan Kisu Gaman Senshuken The Movie2 Saikikku Rabu\n\nRelease Date: October 17th, 2014 (Japan)\n\nRunning Time: 117 mins.\n\nDirector: Nobuyuki Sakuma\n\nWriter: Nobuyuki Sakuma (Screenplay),\n\nStarring: Hitori Gekidan, Hiroaki Ogi, Yuki Himura, Osamu Shitara, Ken Yahagi, Ai Uehara, Minami K"
