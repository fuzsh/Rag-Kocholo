After graduating at the top of his cohort at Tokyo University’s law faculty, he could have got a job at any company or government office. But he chose to work at the Fair Trade Commission. Koshobu seemed to have a fixation about working for the Fair Trade Commission and he was fired up with a sense of mission that is somewhat crazed – “I’ve to fight even if I’m weak”. While he has a unique perspective and insights unlike other officers, he is considered an oddball by the people around him because he works quite differently from them. One day, a former detective Shirokuma Kaede (Anne) joins the team. Kaede failed to capture a criminal who was right in front of her. Because this incident was viewed as a problem, she was ordered to transfer to the Fair Trade Commission. Much to her surprise, the Fair Trade Commission is described as a weak agency and looked down on by other government agencies. As it does not have the police’s enforcement power of search warrants or right to make arrests, there are all sorts of hurdles in investigations. Kaede is disappointed by the actual state of affairs. Although Koshobu and Kaede have totally different personalities and ways of thinking, she gradually begins to understand his mentality of boldly taking on big enemies as they team up to tackle difficult cases.\n\nWebsite: www.fujitv.co.jp/kyosonobannin\n\nTwitter: twitter.com/kyoso_fujitv\n\nPreview: Kyoso no Bannin CM\n\nMaho no Rinobe\n\nDate: From 10.00 p.m., Mondays, 18 July – 19 September 2022\n\nEpisodes: 10\n\nStation: Fuji TV\n\nOriginal Work: Maho no Rinobe by Hoshizaki Maki\n\nScriptwriter: Ueda Makoto (Grappler Baki wa BL dewa nai ka to Kangaetsuzuketa Otome no Kiroku, Urayasu Tekkin Kazoku, Streetwise in Wonderland Series)\n\nDirectors: Ruto Toichiro, Honda Ryuichi\n\nTheme Song: Chi no Kate by Yorushika\n\nCast: Haru, Mamiya Shotaro, Kaneko Daichi, Yoshino Hokuto, Sumire, Honda Chikara, Yamashita Kohei, YOU, Kondo Yoshimasa, Harada Taizo, Endo Kenichi, Nakayama Miho (guest star), Terawaki Yasufumi (guest star), Mizuno Miki (guest star), Nomaguchi Toru (guest star), Triendl Reina (guest star), Sakoda Takaya (guest star), Terajima Susumu (guest star), Asano Yuko (guest star), Watanabe Makiko (guest star), Saeki Daichi (guest star), Iwamatsu Ryo (guest star), Murakawa Eri (guest star)\n\nSynopsis: Shingyoji Kome (Haru) joins Marufuku Builders.
