        "text": "Watanabe (渡辺, \"ferryside\") is the fifth most common Japanese surname.[1]\n\nThe first to be named Watanabe were the samurai clan founded by Watanabe no Tsuna (953-1025). He was a Minamoto and a Saga Genji warrior.[2] He was the son of Minamoto no Mitsuru, a great-grandson of Minamoto no Tōru (822-895), son of the Emperor Saga (786-842), the 52nd Emperor of Japan. Tsuna established the Watanabe branch of the Minamoto Saga Genji clan, taking the name from his stronghold at Watanabe, a port on the Yodo river, in Settsu Province. He was famous for his military exploits in a number of tales and legends, and was companion in arms to his cousin Minamoto no Yorimitsu (944–1021), whose mother was a daughter of the Saga Genji Minamoto no Suguru.\n\nDuring the Hōgen rebellion (1156), and the Genpei War (1180-1185), the Watanabe sided with Minamoto no Yorimasa (1106-1180), until his death at the Battle of Uji, then with Minamoto no Yoritomo (1147-1199).\n\nIn 1180, at the Battle of Uji, the first battle of the Genpei War,[3] the Watanabe clan formed with the warrior monks of Miidera most of the Minamoto army.\n\nThe Heike Monogatari describes some of the Watanabe samurai present at this battle :\n\nWatanabe Choshichi Tonau : \"He was attired that day in a samurai clothing of light green, and body armour ornamented with cherry blossoms on a yellow ground, and wore a sword with mounts of red copper; in his quiver he carried twenty four arrows feathered with white and under his arm was a bow lacquered in black and bound with red bands\".\n\nWatanabe no Kiou : \"clad in a brocaded hunting suit profusely embroidered with chrysanthemums, and wearing a general's armour of scarlet; its name was Kisenaga, and it had been a treasured heirloom for many generations. On his head was a helmet shining with silver stars, and a splendid sword hung at his side. In his quiver were twenty four arrows barred with black on their white feathers, not to speak of the special arrow, feathered with a hawk's wing, always carried by the Imperial Guard of the Takiguchi. His bow was a 'shigeto' of black lacquer with red binding. He rode on (the horse named) Nanryo, while one of his retainers followed with a remount and another bore his shield under his arm\".\n\nIn 1185, the Watanabe sent ships to support the Minamoto cause and their mounted warriors proved to be decisive at the Battle of Yashima.\n\nAt the Battle of Dan-no-ura, when the Dowager Empress Kenrei-mon-In, daughter of Taira no Kiyomori, tried to drown herself, she was pulled out by the samurai Watanabe no Mutsuru.\n\nThe priest Mongaku Shōnin who urged Minamoto no Yoritomo to start a war against the Taira clan, and who managed to get a letter from the Emperor Go-Shirakawa (1127-1192) to Yoritomo, requesting that he set up an army and liberate the country from the tyranny of the Taira, which enabled Yoritomo to take up arms,[4] was the son of Watanabe no Endo Mochito.\n\nIn 1235, the Watanabe clan received from the Kamakura shogunate the responsibility of overseeing large shipments of tax and tributes due the shogunate from the provinces of western and central Japan [5]\n\nDuring the 16th century wars, the following Watanabe samurai distinguished themselves:\n\nWatanabe Hajime of the Mori clan at the battles of Gassan-Toda (1540), Miyajima (1555) and Moji (1561).[citation needed]\n\nWatanabe Moritsuna (1542–1620) who joined Tokugawa Ieyasu in 1557, at the battles of Anegawa (1570), Mikatagahara (1573) and Nagashino (1575).\n\nDominating Settsu Province as a focal area of maritime transportation in medieval Japan, the Watanabe family spread its influence widely. Their descendants settled in other areas, including Kyushu. Besides the mainstream of Watanabe, the Matsuura branch, daimyō of Hirado Domain (in Hizen Province) until 1868, were the most famous and flourished branch.\n\nSeveral samurai clans claimed a genealogical relation to the above Watanabe family. They included the Watanabe of Hakata, the Watanabe of Ōmura, and the Watanabe of Suwa.\n\nThe Watanabe of Hakata were daimyō of Hakata Domain (Izumi Province) until the Meiji Restoration (1868). The Watanabe of Ōmura (Hizen Province) and the Watanabe of Suwa (Shinano Province) were also ranked among the Peers after 1868.\n\nIn the context of the Japanese economy, Mrs. Watanabe is a generic name for housewives who deal in foreign exchange.[6]\n\nGallery[]\n\nPeople with the surname[]\n\nA[]\n\nAkane Watanabe (渡邉 あかね?, born 1994), Japanese badminton player\n\nAkeno Watanabe (渡辺 明乃?, born
