        "text": "Watanabe no TsunaWP (渡辺 綱WP?), Class Name Saber (セイバー, Seibā?), is a Saber-class Servant summoned by Ritsuka Fujimaru in the Grand Orders of Fate/Grand Order. He is the Master of Medea Lily in the Imperial Holy Grail War of the Heian-kyō Singularity.\n\nProfile[]\n\nIdentity[]\n\nOne of the Four Heavenly Kings serving under Minamoto-no-Raikou, who participated in \"Mount Ooe's Oni extermination\", slaughtering the Oni after having them ingest poisoned alcohol. He fought Ibaraki-douji during the incident, and she was the only survivor. Ibaraki later assaulted Watanabe, either at Rashoumon or the bridge of Ichijo Modoribashi depending on the account, and he severed her right hand. Although he took the hand as a trophy after she withdrew from the fight, she later recovered it and disappeared.\n\nWatanabe no Tsuna was a samurai who was active during the mid-Heian period.[2]\n\nAs one of Minamoto no Raikou's retainers, he, along with Sakata Kintoki, Usui Sadamitsu and Urabe-no-Suetake were known as the Four Heavenly Kings of Yorimitsu.[2]\n\nEven amongst the group, Tsuna was the one Raikou held in the highest regard, and the other three members admired him as they would a brother.[2]\n\nBackground[]\n\nIbaraki mentions that she hates Watanabe and wants to kill him, but she also has some interest in conversing with him as well. She is confused by the conflicting emotions.\n\nLegends change. They twist and turn. Even the order of events might change. That's just how it is. For Watanabe no Tsuna, head of the Four Heavenly Kings, Oni Kind were things to cut slaughter, and he harbored neither compassion nor mercy for them. They assaulted people, abducted them, even ate them. And so, as a samurai devoted to protecting people, Tsuna wielded his blade with extraordinary skill.[1]\n\n───I guess you could call it an act of justice.[1]\n\nHe was given patronage by Raikou and was proclaimed head of the Four Heavenly Kings. As time passed, more and more people came to idolize him, as one would an elder brother.[1]\n\n───The heart thirsts like the desert. The body sharpens like the blade.[1]\n\nKyoto was most assuredly the capital of madness, a world of the latter days of law where monsters of land and sea alike ran rampant amidst anarchy. Tsuna never hesitated in wielding his blade. He never hesitated in slaughtering Oni. He simply made it his one and only duty to kill the demonic. Detached. Dispassionate. When was it that hatred began to cloud his slash? When was it his end began? Was it when the woman for whom he yearned since time immemorial, and with whom he was supposed to live happily ever after, was found mercilessly murdered?[1]\n\n───Ibaraki.[1]\n\nTheir confrontation was inevitable. An Oni who had proclaimed themselves chieftain, assembling the Oni. Their name was Ibaraki Douji. Abe-no-Seimei had prophesized that Ibaraki, who had her arm cut off at Ichijou Modori-bashi, would come after Tsuna. And just as expected, Ibaraki Douji came for Tsuna. Imitating the form of that woman, she wished for her arm back.[1]\n\n───That face...[1]\n\nTaking advantage of that momentary surprise, Ibaraki Douji managed to take her arm back. The delighted girl then locked eyes with Tsuna. The yearning for days past, the hatred for Oni Kind, and all the he had ever seen or heard rumored about that peculiar figure, came together in a single phrase: \"Take it, Ibaraki.\"[1]\n\n───Did that person...raise an Oni?[1]\n\n\"Next time, I will slay you.\" However, even as he pledged this, Tsuna's blade unconsciously grew dull. Although Raikou reprimanded him, restoring his previous skill with the blade, his heart was forever left behind.[1]\n\n───Whence does an Oni's wickedness spur?[1]\n\nOni are evil, she was evil, and Ibaraki Douji, who walks the boundary between human and Oni, is evil. Shuten Douji is evil for turning her back into an Oni. And perhaps, Tsuna too is evil for allowing it.[1]\n\nHowever───life could not have been any other way.[1]\n\nThey are the way they are because they are meant to be so, and for that reason, he had no choice but to slay them. At the final battle at Mount Ooe, Tsuna brandished the Onikiri Yasutsuna as he cut down Ibaraki Douji's subordinates—her companions—one after another; cutting and cutting and cutting. In the distant future, those referred to as \"Sword Demons\" would appear throughout history, but it is said that Watanabe no Tsuna, when he appeared on the mountain that day, was no demon; he was an Asura.[1]\n\nAnd so, in the end───[1]\n\nIbaraki Douji and Watanabe no Tsuna came eye to eye. Was Tsuna able to cut down Ibaraki? Was he able to kill her? Or was it, as later generations have told, that there was simply a strife and rioting in order to retrieve the arm? (In the \"Zentaiheiki\" and \"Tale of the Heike\" it is written that it was after the battle at Mount Ooe that Ibaraki Douji started riots to regain her arm.) Tsuna will not speak of it under any circumstance.[1]\n\n\"Ah───I always feel sick in this very moment\"[1]\n\nAppearance[]\n\nPersonality[]\n\nA prim, straight-laced person. Though somewhat reserved, he can be sociable, and has become renowned as a cool and collected Oni slayer. His private life is so utterly boring that no one outside his circle can believe it, and on top of that his job performance is impeccable. It's said that the people around him place absolute trust in him not because of his words, but because of his demeanor and attitude. He kills Oni due to his sense of obligation, rather than hatred. ― Except for a certain Oni, that is.[2]\n\nFor Tsuna, Oni were neither beings to be detested nor to be protected, but rather beings to slay. He holds no sympathy or pity for the act, nor hatred or delight. It is merely his job, so to speak; he reports for work every morning to patrol Kyoto, and if he happens to come across an Oni he slays it, then goes home. Rinse and repeat. If he were born in modern times, he would be the equivalent of a businessman who does his job perfectly (and always leaves work on time). He is a monstrous human who never ceases to neglect training no matter what and continues to advance his skills. Although he understands human nature, he doesn't think to associate himself with it. Although he understands people's emotions, he isn't sure if these emotions exist within himself. Troublesome it may be, it doesn't mean that he is emotionless. There are times where he has risked his life to save his friends and innocent bystanders, but Tsuna does not help them as an indication of expressing intense emotions. In other words, he is more like a robot that was programmed to aid people.[2]\n\n\"I do this because it's something that must be done,\" the person in question puts it simply. Perhaps it's because he doesn't place himself amongst humans that he finds it more difficult to kill people than Oni. He has admitted it to Kintoki and the others in the past, but of course they became lost for words.[2]\n\nA stray who lacked something from a young age. He realizes that being one of Raikou's Four Heavenly Kings, a samurai, and an Oni slayer has just barely made him look like a human being.[2]\n\nThe only exception to that however, is the resplendent and cruel Oni with golden hair Now, she is the only one who can stir up the emotions deep within Tsuna.[2]\n\nPerhaps as some sort of remnant of being part of the Four Heavenly Kings, he basically just treats his Master like their a younger sibling. He might be untalkative, but he behaves in an affectionate manner nonetheless.[1] On the other hand, should the Master have a contract with an Oni like Ibaraki, Tsuna's respect for them will skyrocket. This is because it's something Tsuna himself could never have done during the Heian period.[1]\n\nThe type of singing he likes are nursery rhymes.\n\nRelationships[]\n\nRole[]\n\nFate/Grand Order[]\n\nHeian-kyō: Naraka Mandala[]\n\nBefore Chaldea's arrival, Tsuna and his Servant Medea Lily defeated Urabe-no-Suetake and his servant Count Cagliostro. He also defeated Usui Sadamitsu and his servant Helena Blavatsky.[4]\n\nAt the Main Street Ichijou Modori-bashi Bridge, Tsuna speaks with Ibaraki-douji while she is disguised as human girl until he points she forgot to change her shadow to match.[5]\n\nIn a rage, Ibaraki attacks Tsuna, but he dodges every one of her attacks, all the while keeping his eyes closed. He then swiftly cut off her right arm. But instead of finishing her off, he sheathes his sword as he has determined that she isn’t a Master, so he has no further quarrel with her. Ibaraki doesn’t understand what he’s talking about and unleashes flames to mask her retreat. She swears to Tsuna that she will take back her arm and kill him when they next meet.[5]\n\nTsuna calls for Medea, and decides to hold on to Ibaraki’s arm for the time being. He thanks Medea for enhancing his senses with her magecraft. Medea finds it incredible, though, that he avoided Ibaraki’s attacks all through his own power. Tsuna believes any of the Four Heavenly Kings should be capable of such a feat. He and Medea then set off in search of more quarry.[5]\n\nLater, he saves Ritsuka Fujimaru and Katou Danzou from a tsuchigumo by effortlessly slaying it. He then identifies Ritsuka and Danzou as Master and Servant and introduces himself.[5]\n\nMedea appears and confirms Tsuna’s suspicions. Tsuna, in accordance with the rules of the Imperial Holy Grail War as decreed by Fujiwara-no-Michinaga, then challenges Ritsuka, calling them Caster to their confusion. Danzou fights Tsuna to protect Ritsuka, confused to why one of the Four Heavenly Kings is attacking them and why he has a Servant.[6]\n\nStruggling against Tsuna despite him being human, Danzou tells him they have no reason to fight. Tsuna thinks Danzou is a Master like him and asserts fighting is the only path for them, as Fujiwara has decreed Kyo is now their battleground. Danzou realizes Tsuna truly intends to kill them, so she produces a smokescreen to cover her and Ritsuka’s escape.[6]\n\nTsuna eventually catches up, seeing Ritsuka and Kintoki have run into Sakata Kintoki. He confesses to Kintoki he is responsible for Danzou's injuries and demands he stand aside as the Imperial Holy Grail War requires he kill Ritsuka and Danzou. But Kintoki vehemently refuses, leaving Tsuna no choice but to fight his sworn brother. Medea tries lending her aid with her Dragon Tooth Warriors.[6]\n\nNot wanting to spend all night fighting Kintoki, especially since he isn’t a Master, Tsuna decides to just kill Ritsuka. But he stops and realizes his mistake when Danzou goes into spirit form on Ritsuka’s orders.[6]\n\nMedea apologizes for not specifying that the Servant signal came from Danzou, not Ritsuka. She also identifies Danzou as Assassin. Tsuna is surprised that there are Servants other than Casters.[6]\n\nAdmitting to his mistake, Tsuna allows Kintoki to have Ritsuka. However, he warns Kintoki that he will kill him if he sees he has Command Spells on his left hand when they next meet. Kintoki looks forward to fighting Tsuna. With that, Tsuna and Medea take their leave.[6]\n\nHe later visits the Imperial Palace, surprised he and Kintoki scheduled a visit at the same time. He overheard the heroes' conversation with Michinaga about proving the Grail War is an evil plot, but he refuses to abandon the ritual. He reminds Kintoki of his threat from two nights ago, but as they’re in the palace, he cannot make good on it for the moment. The heroes leave following a tense moment between Tsuna and Kintoki.[7]\n\nOn a later night, Tsuna enters the cave Charles Babbage, Servant to Fujiwara-no-Kaoruko, stays during the day, having already known about both it and his nightly walks. Babbage activates Dimension of Steam in response to Tsuna’s presence, forcing the head of the Four Heavenly Kings to fight an innumerable number of Helter Skelters. The Noble Phantasm stops, though, when Kintoki shatters Babbage's Spirit Core at the conclusion of their deathmatch. Tsuna realizes Babbage challenged Kintoki to protect his Master. He recognizes he lacks restraint, so a non-warrior like Kaoruko would never survive against him. He accepts Kintoki won and leaves with Medea.[8]\n\nHe later sneaks into Minamoto-no-Raikou's manor while she and the heroes are having dinner, using one of Medea's spells to mask his presence. Yet despite it being a foreign spell, Raikou still senses him and demands he show himself. He complies, impressed by Raikou's senses. He apologizes to her for the condition he left Urabe and Usui in. Raikou forgives him, though, honored three of her Genji warriors were chosen for such an important ritual.[9]\n\nTurning his attention towards Kintoki, Tsuna chastises him for leniency toward Oni and questions if he knows what a Genji warrior should be. Kintoki turns the question on him. Tsuna seems like is going to answer when Shuten-douji, her Servant Paracelsus von Hohenheim, Ibaraki, and Torakuma invade the manor.[9]\n\nTsuna fights Ibaraki while bringing up a particularly bloody episode from her past, which only serves to enrage her. She attacks again under the pretense of getting her arm back. But it is a feint and her true target is Raikou, who she immediately tries to decapitate from behind. Raikou's Servant, Nursery Rhyme, takes the blow for Raikou, damaging her Spirit Origin. Paracelsus teleports a confused and distraught Ibaraki back to Mt. Ooe. Raikou becomes distraught by the sight of Nursery Rhyme dying and starts to become Ushi-Gozen, which was Shuten's plan.[9]\n\nOn presumably Tsuna's orders, Medea tries healing Nursery Rhyme but to no avail. But for some inexplicable reason, Ritsuka's Mystic Code healing spell works and Nursery Rhyme recovers enough that she can stand. She then calms Raikou down, thwarting Shuten's plan. Shuten is a bit disappointed and decides to kill Medea and Nursery Rhyme.[9]\n\nTsuna and Medea get ready to fight, but Kintoki demands he fight instead so he may rectify his failings. Tsuna, feeling Kintoki’s resolve, allows it. Paracelsus then transports himself, Shuten, Ritsuka, and Kintoki to the Imperial Deathmatch Stage for their battle. Kintoki defeats Paracelsus, who teleports Shuten presumably back to Mt. Ooe before he disappears.[9]\n\nThe next day, the Genji hold a meeting regarding the Grail War. Raikou determines they require conclusive evidence to prove the veracity of Ritsuka’s claims. Kintoki recommends they halt the deathmatches until they can determine the truth. Tsuna, however, thinks they should continue until Michinaga orders otherwise. Raikou finds both Kintoki and Tsuna’s points valid, so she suggests the two settle their differences through battle as it has always been with the Genji. Neither Kintoki nor Tsuna object. Medea thus transports herself, Tsuna, Kintoki, and RItsuka to the Imperial Deathmatch Stage.[10]\n\nKintoki defeats Tsuna. Medea tries to fight, but Tsuna refuses to let her because she reminds him of a girl he had failed to protect. He had hoped to use the Grail to bring her back to life. She was a noble’s daughter he had known since childhood and he was assigned to protect the district she lived. But one day she and her entire house were killed by a small Oni. It was only upon seeing her dead that Tsuna understood he had loved her.[10]\n\nTsuna accepts resurrecting the dead is wrong and concedes to Kintoki. Raikou declares Kintoki to be winner, thus she will tell Michinaga that the Genji suspect the Grail War is an evil plot.[10]\n\nTsuna helps Chaldea the rest of the arc.[11]\n\nHoly Grail Phantom Thief Amakusa Shirou and the Slapstick Museum[]\n\nClaiming to be an employee from the Imperial Household Agency, he approached the museum director on the day of the theft of the Holy Grail. He asked the director if anyone tried to steal and trade the national treasure, but when the director looked around, he said he would wait inside the museum. Then, when the self-proclaimed phantom thief Amakusa Shirou Tokisada appears to steal the Holy Grail, he breaks into the private room where the Holy Grail is stored in a tumultuous gap and attacks the phantom thief with a heartfelt blow.\n\nIn fact, having received an enchantment from Shakespeare in advanced, he was able to slash \"even if he cuts living things, he will not be cut, but he can cut inanimate objects.\" The glass case containing the Holy Grail is hard enough to break only with a strong blow, and the moment you have an intention to steal the Holy Grail, you will lose your fighting ability due to the Holy Grail, so it is powerful enough to break only the case without aiming for the Holy Grail. struck a blow he said was dubious about whether things would work out properly, and he trembled with humility, saying that the praise should be given to a great writer in Europe.\n\nEvent: Akihabara Explosion[]\n\nShop 20th interlude. Golden and Iro Toy Store. Tsuna wondered if there was anything like a stilts or a top, but after seeing Kintoki playing with a shiny sword or transformation belt, he sternly commented that it would be okay for children to protect themselves. While Kintoki goes to look at other items, he tries to touch the transformation belt himself, but he is disappointed when the aura doesn't change.\n\nHalloween Rising! ~The Queen of Sandstorm and the Apostle of Darkness[]\n\nHe gives Medea lily a pumpkin so that she can share with Jason. Tsuna and Mordred are fighting enemies Zenobia and her group helps them out. She asks them if they will join their group but they said they belong to one group already. His group helps Zenobia, Elizabeth Báthory and the master the rest of the arc.\n\nAbilities[]\n\nDuring 1008 AD, Tsuna was regarded by Sakata Kintoki as the undisputed strongest of the Heian period.[6] Even Minamoto-no-Raikou said he was the single most powerful warrior in the Human world. However, Kintoki points out that things would get more complicated if nonhumans were also taken into account.[12] Nevertheless, Tsuna was Raikou's most trusted warrior among the Four Heavenly Kings. Saitou Hajime says that Tsuna was the greatest monster slayer but then later corrects himself and says that he was the greatest Oni slayer in Japanese history.[13]\n\nCombat[]\n\nHeian-kyo Alive Version[]\n\nDuring the Heian-kyō Singularity, Tsuna was Medea Lily's Master. Despite not being a Servant himself, Tsuna had no problem fighting Oni or other Servants thanks to his extraordinary power level. Although Medea could easily block all manner of non-Mystic physical attacks, he only relied on her for support.[6] During his fight with Ibaraki-douji, Medea temporarily enhanced his senses with a \"simple\" Spell, allowing Tsuna to fight with his eyes closed. Even with this limitation, Tsuna was able to evade all of Ibaraki's claw and flame attacks and cut off her arm without difficulty. Although Tsuna thanks Medea for this, she attributes the feat to Tsuna's own skill as a warrior.[5]\n\nPrior to the arrival of Ritsuka Fujimaru to the Heian-kyō Singularity, Tsuna defeated two Servants and left their Masters, Urabe-no-Suetake and Usui Sadamitsu, seriously wounded with Higekiri.[8] Tsuna claims he was unable to hold back against Usui and Urabe when they fought. Minamoto-no-Raikou states that their loss goes to show that they still have ways to improve.[9]\n\nTsuna was able to cut a Tsuchigumo in two so fast Katou Danzou's sensors didn't even see him move.[5] Not only are his strikes too fast for Danzou to follow, but they are incredibly strong, as shown when Danzou's limbs groaned from the strain of blocking his attacks. She states that even as a Servant, she is no match for his mastery of the blade and that she can't see a way to defeat him. However, she still manages to exchange blows with him for a while until she eventually decides to retreat.[6] During Tsuna's encounter with Charles Babbage, the close proximity to a Ley Line allowed Babbage to increase his Steam pressure to its maximum and release his Noble Phantasm. The dozens of Helter Skelters produced by Dimension of Steam were able to hold off Tsuna while Babbage battled Kintoki.[8]\n\nDuring his first fight with Sakata Kintoki, Tsuna orders Medea Lily to disable her Dragon Tooth Warriors, as they aren't of any help against Kintoki and they only get in his way. Kintoki was able to take a direct blow from Tsuna's Higekiri without a scratch. It is later stated by Kintoki that Tsuna was holding back during their fight, as he just considered it a sparring match.[6] During their second fight, Kintoki asks Ritsuka Fujimaru for his support since he is \"down a Caster\". Otherwise, Kintoki doesn't think he could muster anything more than a tie, at best. Rather than killing his opponents, Kintoki decides to fight them only as long as Tsuna's knee doesn't touch the ground. While Tsuna questions if Kintoki will be holding back, Kintoki claims he will be giving it everything he's got. As the two Genji warriors fought in close range combat, Fujimaru took care of many skeletal warriors Medea conjured with his own Shadow Servants. Tsuna is eventually defeated by Kintoki's Golden Lightning. Tsuna regrets misjudging the moment to go in for the kill and states that he should have known better than to challenge Kintoki to a contest of brute strength.[10]\n\nTsuna was forced to fight Shikigami made artificially immortal by keeping their Spiritual Cores separate from their bodies just like the Heroic Spirit Swordmasters. Although during the Shimosa Subcategory Singularity they needed Miyamoto Musashi's extraordinary technique and Myoujingiri Muramasa to defeat them, Watanabe-no-Tsuna is able to kill these Shikigami thanks to Abe-no-Seimei's talismans and Medea Lily's enhancement Spells. However, Medea Lily states that seeing how he fights, he might have been fine without her spells.[11]\n\nAbe-no-Seimei stated that Watanabe-no-Tsuna, Minamoto-no-Raikou, and Sakata Kintoki wouldn't be able to stop the powerful Hasshoujin Heroic Spirits while holding back. This is confirmed to be true during their fight against Saisetsu Tawara Touta‎ and Hyoubi Suzuka Gozen. The two Servants are able to overwhelm them with Hachiman Prayer and Heavenly Demon Rain while holding back themselves. After Medea Lily heals them and casts enhancement Spells on everyone, they fight them a second time. After fighting for a while, Tsuna and Raikou take advantage of their openings right before releasing their Noble Phantasms' True Names to deal a fatal blow. Raikou explains that since they have no lead-up to their final attacks by virtue of being alive, that was their only chance of victory. She claims that had they not been Heroic Spirits, empty shadows of their former selves, the battle would have ended very differently. It also means that the key to their victory lay in them having experienced their Noble Phantasms once already.[11]\n\nSkills[]\n\nClass Skills[]\n\nMagic Resistance (A Rank) Tsuna, a warrior from the Heian period, can cut anything demonic. Magecraft, curse arts, black magic, and more are all fair game.[1]\n\nRiding (B Rank) Can handle most vehicles and mounts. Unable to handle Phantasmal Species.[1]\n\nPersonal Skills[]\n\nEternal Arms Mastery (Anti-Demon) (A- Rank): So long as his opponent is demonic, his swordsmanship will not waver in the slightest. He is an expert against Oni and demons... but due to certain circumstances, this skill has been slightly downgraded.[1]\n\nFoot Soldier of Suiten (B Rank): There is a rumor that Tsuna, the ancestor of the Watanabe political clan, was a shaman who was involved in laying the souls of water spirits to rest and preventing floods. It protects the user from water hazards while pacifying the water at the same time.[1]\n\nSevered Arm of Ichijou Modoribashi (EX Rank): The imperial capital of Kyoto sublimated as a Skill based off the tale that took place at Ichijou Modoribashi. This is one of his ultimate achievements demonstrating his abilities as a swordsman, facing against an Oni with physical abilities exceeding that of humans and severing its arm without so much as a reaction. The origin point of the attack becomes imperceptible, making evasion all but impossible. Note that the story of how Ibaraki-douji's arm was cut off differs between that of Proper Human History and the Imperial Holy Grail War (Singularity). In Proper History as Ibaraki observed, Tsuna devised a plan and sliced off her arm.[1]\n\nNoble Phantasms[]\n\nWatanabe's wields the sword Onikiri Yasutsuna, formerly known as Higekiri. The Minamoto clan's most treasured blade once gifted to him by Minamoto-no-Raikou. One of the most famous swords to exist, known for severing the arm of Ibaraki-douji.[1][5]\n\nHis second Noble Phantasm is Mount Ooe - Enlightened Oni Slayer.\n\nOther Capabilities[]\n\nDuring the Heian-kyō Singularity, alive Tsuna was shown concealing his presence with the help of one of Medea Lily's Spells on two separate ocassions.[8][9] Even with all of Katou Danzou's sensors tuned for maximum sensitivity to help make their way through a dark cave, she still didn't notice Tsuna's presence.[8] On the other hand, alive Minamoto-no-Raikou was able to see through Medea's spell and detect Tsuna.[9]\n\nDevelopment[]\n\nCreation and Conception[]\n\nWatanabe-no-Tsuna was designed by Hidari in Fate/Grand Order.[1] His scenario writer is Yuuichirou Higashide in Fate/Grand Order.[1]\n\nTsuna was first mentioned to qualify for Saber in Chaldea Ace.[14]\n\n[]\n\n\"Watanabe no Tsuna. Although he's a justifiably well-known person in Japan, when I got the request, I really wanted to draw him with a two-block bowl cut, in part because of his character, and also because of my personal brainworm at the time. With that in mind, I started with his hairdo, and the rest of the design grew from there. For the clothing, I used traditional Heian-period articles as reference, so the mismatch between the hairstyle and the clothes worked as a sort of contrast accent, I think.\" (Hidari)[1]\n\nReferences[]"
