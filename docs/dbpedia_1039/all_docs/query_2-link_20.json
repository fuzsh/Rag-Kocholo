        "text": "Official profile photo via Aoni Productions The official website for voice talent agency Aoni Production announced today that voice actor Keiko Yamamoto passed away on April 18 at the age of 83 due to sepsis. The agency apologized for the delay in reporting the news, stating it was the “wishes of the bereaved family.” A funeral has been held with close friends and family. Keiko Yamamoto was born on August 7, 1940, in Osaka Prefecture. Yamamoto made her debut in 1963 with the role of Wally Wolf Boy Ken . Her break-out mainstream role as a voice actor came in 1965 where she voiced Osper in Tatakae! Osper . From there, she joined Aoni Production as a founding member in 1969. In 1972, Yamamoto started her role as Hanako Hanazawa in the Sazae-san anime. She also voiced Shouta Yamada in the Chibi Maruko-chan anime. In late 2023, Yamamoto retired from her long-running roles in Sazae-san and Chibi Maruko-chan , both of which spanned 30 and 50 years respectively.\n\nJapanese manga series “Tiger Mask” is being adapted into a live-action feature for the international market by Italy’s Fabula Pictures and Brandon Box and Japan’s Kodansha.\n\nThe popular manga, which follows a ruthless professional Japanese wrestler named Naoto Date who after making it big in the U.S. returns to his country and fights against evil forces, previously inspired an anime TV series made by Japan’s Toei Animation.\n\n“Tiger Mask’ is a long-beloved figure both in Japan and Italy, where he’s been [considered] a strong, cool and timeless hero since the series’ first release in 1969,” Yohei Takami, head of Kodansha’s media business rights division, said in a statement.\n\n“We are excited to be able to bring a new ‘Tiger Mask’ to global audiences, partnering with respected Italian filmmakers sharing the love and passion for ‘Tiger Mask’ with us, like Fabula Pictures and Brandon Box,” he added.\n\nHere's the full trailer for the live-action adaptation of the 1960s anime and manga classic, Tiger Mask. The character was created by Ikki Kajiwara, and the story centers on a wrestling hero who fights evil to protect the children of an orphanage.\n\nThe film stars Eiji Wentz (Brave Story) as the hero, Natsuna Watanabe (Gantz, Kimi ni Todoke) as the heroine, Ruriko and Show Aikawa (Zebraman) as Mister X. Here's a little more information on the film and its story, thanks to Anime News Network:\n\n\"Tiger Mask\" is the alter ego of the character Naoto Date, a pro wrestler who goes against an evil wrestling organization and fights for children in an orphanage. In the new setup for the film, Date dons a special suit and \"transforms\" into Tiger Mask with enhanced mobility and muscle strength. His mask has also been redesigned with a nod to American comic action heroes such as Spider-Man and Batman.\n\nWe're not overly familiar with this one but we soon will be. Here comes a teaser for the new movie directed by Ken Ochiai, based upon the manga series \"Tiger Mask\" by Ikki Kajiwara. The film has attracted a lively cast however, including the likes of Eiji Wentz (Kitaro and the Millennium Curse), Natsuna (Gantz), and Shô Aikawa (Dead or Alive). The Tiger Mask persona is instantly recognisable by its trademark mask, designed to look like a tiger's head, as well as the combination of high flying attacks and martial arts in the wrestling ring. This will be the third movie based on the manga, the first two arriving in the 1970s, though the Tiger Mask persona has continued to appear in wrestling arenas since that time. The Tiger Mask opens its cape and its doors sometime in November 2013. The teaser trailer doesn't give much away but it will certainly do for now.\n\nThe Tiger Mask is a classic 1960s anime and manga created by Ikki Kajiwara.
