        "text": "Geography\n\nToda is located in far southeastern Saitama Prefecture, separated from Tokyo by the Arakawa River. The Sasame River also flows through the city before joining the Arakawa.\n\nSurrounding municipalities\n\nSaitama Prefecture\n\nSaitama\n\nKawaguchi\n\nAsaki\n\nWakō\n\nWarabi\n\nTokyo Metropolis\n\nItabashi-ku\n\nKita-ku\n\nHistory\n\nThe villages of Niizo, Kamitoda and Shimotoda were created within Kitaadachi District, Saitama with the establishment of the municipalities system on April 1, 1889. The villages merged on June 1, 1941 to form the town of Toda. The town annexed the village of Misasa on July 20, 1957. The rowing competition of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics took place in Toda near to where the present day Toda-Koen Station is located. The rowing area which is adjacent to the Arakawa River is still in use today. Toda was elevated to city status on October 1, 1966.\n\nEconomy\n\nMuch of the residential and commercial development in Toda is due to its proximity to the city of Tokyo and the efficient commuter rail links available. This has enabled Toda to act as a bedroom community of Tokyo and is thus an apt location of residence for those who wish to work in the Tokyo Metropolis. There has been a continuous increase in population since the construction of the three Saikyo Line stations in the 1980s and this has had a positive effect on the economy and development of the city.\n\nThere are a significant number of transportation/logistics and printing-based enterprises in Toda. Large companies that have their headquarters in Toda-shi include Okazen Transportation (Haulage/Logistics), Khobho (IT services), Chiyoda (Food Manufacturing). Other large companies that have significant operations in Toda are Yamato Transportation, Meiji Dairy, Jomo, Mainichi Newspaper, Chunichi Newspaper, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma, Sanyo Electric, Japan Restaurant Enterprise, and Hayakawa Publishing.\n\nEducation\n\nToda has 12 elementary schools, six middle schools and two high schools.\n\nRailway\n\nAn arrangement of the Toda City song has been used as the departure melody for trains departing from the up platform (platform 1) of the three Saikyo Line stations in Toda since 1 August 2007.\n\nJR East - Saikyo Line\n\nToda-Kōen - Toda - Kita-Toda\n\nHighway\n\nTokyo Gaikan Expressway\n\nShuto Expressway – No.5 Ikebukuro Line\n\nShuto Expressway – Saitama-Omiya Line\n\nJapan National Route 17\n\nJapan National Route 298\n\nBus services\n\nThere are various bus services in the city. Most of the routes are run by Kokosai Kogyo bus company. In addition there is a distinctive low cost mini-bus service known as Toco. This stands for Toda Community bus. The Toco service serves routes within the city limits unlike the regular Kokosai Kogyo bus routes which usually bring commuters to and from train stations on the Saikyo and Keihin-Tohoku train lines.\n\nSister city relations\n\nLiverpool, New South Wales, Australia, since October 1, 1992\n\nKaifeng, Henan, China, friendship city since August 21, 1984\n\nLocal attractions\n\nToda Rowing Course\n\nNoted people from Toda\n\nTomoya Ugajin, professional soccer player\n\nNatsuna Watanabe, actress"
