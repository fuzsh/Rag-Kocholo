The enterprising folks at Pink Eiga have released the first two titles in a series of rare English-subtitled pinku releases: Shuji Kataoka's S&M Hunter (1986) and Osamu Sato's New Tokyo Decadence: The Slave (2007). The titles officially launch on January 14, 2009 but are available for purchase directly from Pink Eiga's site right now. S&M Hunter (depicted at left) was reviewed earlier in the year on Twitch; a review of New Tokyo Decadence is forthcoming. Needless to say, both films are offensive, weird and most importantly, very entertaining.
