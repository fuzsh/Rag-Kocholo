        "text": "Queen Charlotte has been successful in her relentless pursuit of securing the royal line for her husband, but now her days are back to being empty. A loneliness has begun to seep deeper into her soul that not even Whistledown can distract her from and she has begun to even lose interest in their game.\n\nLady Danbury fell out of sorts with her oldest friend after the debacle with the Sharmas and Bridgertons. While her friendship was repaired, tragedy had struck. Now that the royal line was secure, she watched as Charlotte succumbed to her grief for namesake. What was worse: she had lost the confidence of Violet Bridgerton. She was lost, lonely, and, most of all, sad.\n\nPenelope Featherington was in torment. She had used her grief and loneliness to write her papers during the royal baby race. The nation needed Queen Charlotte, so she used her pen to spur Her Majesty onwards. It had worked, but the grief and emptiness returned. Then, she learned of her Mama's betrayal: filing a false will with the Queen's solicitor. Now grief, anger, and sorrow mix together leaving her empty.\n\nThree women from opposing spectrums feeling the same types of loneliness. What kind of friendships can they forge together?\n\nJake and Sunghoon are arranged to be mates by their parents. The news are more than well received by them, glad to be able to mate a friend instead of a stranger. It all seems to go smoothly for them, until Sunghoon meets Heeseung, a human, when trying to find out what Jay's been hiding.\n\nSunghoon just wanted to find out why Jay was suddenly so protective of humans, and he'll get his very own reason to share his opinion. Now he just has to convince Jake of the same.\n\nIn nigh on every universe, the milky way galaxy is home to nightmares incarnate. Men die pointless deaths, alien abominations howl in the dark recesses of space, and evil gods from beyond the mortal realm laugh in amusement at the carnage arrayed before them.\n\nThis is one of the few timelines where things ended up panning out differently. A single choice made changed the fates of all. A new paradigm shift, and with it, an entirely new playing field was set.\n\nHow will things turn out when passion lights up the darkness of the far future?\n\nOnly time will tell.\n\n\"Allie had found her father after years of searching. He wasn't an easy man to find. Made sense. If one were to look in the grizzled hunter's home they would probably run‚Äî and keep running.\n\nYet she stayed there.\n\nFrankly, where else would she go? Other people were too busy chasing silver in hopes of finding gold. Gold to her was being right there with someone who hadn't been around for a long time. A figure that represented hope and renovation. Something desperately needed. Deserved. The loss of her mother had bred a sort of‚Ä¶ delay in cognisance. The world proved vapid and although it inched and wormed around her, she felt void. The lust of desiring open landscapes and anything other than a fucking grey hospital room consumed her. Wires sat eerily behind her eyelids - the vision of incoming death. Those moments were a plague that often became pushed down behind a winning smile, pearly teeth on full display from her youthful stint in braces.\"\n\n‚ö†Ô∏èBDSM-ish story.‚ö†Ô∏è\n\nüîûNON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTüîû\n\nFLUFF\n\nSMUT\n\nANGST\n\nHyunjin- New to the position of CEO of his parent's company - is terrified of letting his father down after signing a marriage agreement with a female, which he hates... It was the only condition his father asked of him before even considering retiring from his position and letting him take over the company- which was the only thing Hyunjin wanted more than anything else in the world- AT THE TIME...\n\nBut Hyunjin has a secret that only he knows... A secret that eats him alive after he finds who he called to be his one and only SOULMATE.\n\nIn this story, one of them is going to fall first, but the other will fall harder.\n\nWOULD THEY HAVE A HAPPY ENDING? MAYBE.\n\nWOULD THEY SUFFER?\n\nTHAT IS A POSSIBILITY.\n\nHyunlix centric... with some mentions of Bhang Chan, Lee Minho, Kim Seungmin, Yang Jeongin, Han Jisung, and Seo Changbin.\n\nThe rest is a surprise... the timeliness for this book is somewhat ü•¥üòµüòµüí´ü•∫üëøüò°üò§üò´ I mean... it's gonna be one heck of a roller-coaster.\n\nDO WANT TO JOIN ME FOR THE RIDE?\n\n‚ô°‚ô°WEEKLY UPDATES‚ô°‚ô°\n\nTUESDAYS."
