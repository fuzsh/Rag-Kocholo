        "text": "Every Hero Deserves A Good Origin Story\n\nS&M Hunter: Begins is a prequel to S&M Hunter but was released the year before so I'm assuming that it originally wasn't a prequel and was later billed as a prequel after the success of S&M Hunter. The film definitely feels like it was made before S&M Hunter because the titular S&M Hunter doesn't have his cool costume which I could definitely see them using... dude doesn't even have the eyepatch.\n\nThe Origin story is pretty good and starts with the S&M Hunter being a dweep who gets his ass kicked by some high school girls and you would expect the way he lost his eye to be epic but it really wasn't,…\n\nThe S&M Hunter is back and so too is his infectious disco-funk theme tune! Despite this being billed as a prequel the year listed on most sites seems to date it a year before the ‘original’ film, so I’m a little uncertain in terms of which came first.\n\nWhat’s clear is that S&M Hunter : Begins tells the origin story of our one-eyed, rope-toting, sadist avenger.\n\nOnce a mild mannered, tight-fisted salary man, an encounter with a gang of evil chain wielding schoolgirls results in the S&M Hunter receiving a nasty chain-whipping and losing an eye.\n\nThis trauma has a seismic effect on the once meek wimp and his transformation into the iconic sadist begins.\n\nWe get a fantastic S&M…\n\nWhere To Watch: available January 9, 2024; pre-order here ww.kinolorber.com, or amzn.to/47k60co\n\nRAVING REVIEW: S&M HUNTER BEGINS sets itself apart in superhero cinema by transforming an ordinary office worker into an extraordinary character. Be warned, this is unlike any superhero film or comedy film that you’ve seen before! A film that is very unique and polarizing for a specific audience. As the precursor to S&M HUNTER, it delves into a rich backstory (I won’t lie, I need to see S&M HUNTER now,) blending physical and psychological transformation with an unconventional narrative. The film's departure from typical superhero conventions offers a fresh perspective on heroism that incorporates elements of sadism and masochism into its core. Yep, you read that all right;…\n\nThe prequel is sadly not a ( eye ) patch on the fantastic S&M Hunter.\n\nThere are some moments but it lacks the pace and sheer madness. Now i know how the eye was taken out I can become more of an adjusted person in society there is no disputing this but to be honest just watch Hunter.\n\nRemember there are only 3 people in this world - sadists and masochists and those who cant decide.\n\nIf you like this type of goodness seek out Groper Train - Search for the black Pearl."
