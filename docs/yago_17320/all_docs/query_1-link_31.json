Far too outrageous to be offensive, S&M HUNTER revels in political incorrectness.\n\nAbout Shuji KATAOKA\n\nShuji KATAOKA, born in 1950, is a veteran of the genre as a director and writer. He made his first pink film in 1983 and has since directed dozens of films for Kan MUKAI's production company Shishi Pro. He has also directed straight-to-video yakuza films since 1993."
