        "text": "Competition\n\nThe Competition brings together a group of films with highly unique qualities, primarily works from around the world that are being released this autumn. Though the main focus is on mid-career filmmakers who are striving to head up the next generation, there are many different types of works, including some by both first-time and veteran directors.\n\nIn selecting the films, we placed a strong emphasis on the individual vision of each filmmaker, but we also made a conscious effort to include works from a wide range of countries and genres. Cinema provides us with a window on the world, and the joy of watching films is closely linked to the joy of learning about other places and people. In this year's event, we present works from many different regions, including Western, Northern, and Eastern Europe; North, Central, and South America; the Middle East; and West, Southeast, and East Asia which includes Japan. This veritable globe of cinema should provide us with a good idea about what is going on in the world today.\n\nViewers can also experience the diverse pleasures of cinema through the rich variety of genres represented in the event, such as comedy-drama, suspense, love story, horror, art, and human drama.\n\nAnother special feature of this year's competition is the inclusion of three Japanese films. Made by three distinctly different directors - seasoned master, hit-maker, and young hopeful - the films are sure to convey the great range of contemporary Japanese cinema.\n\nIs there some underlying theme in this extremely diverse selection? Though they might seem to have superficially different forms, on closer examination you will find parallels between the dramas, created by talented filmmakers offering profound insight into the current era. Films are a reflection of our times. These works make use of many different styles to depict various issues that the world is currently facing: impending conflicts, wars, migrants, political instability, poverty, discrimination, and the sense that we might be living in end times. They suggest that what we need to survive is toughness and tolerance - and in order to combine these two qualities, we also need love. This year's competition is defined by a quest to understand what people need to make it through this troubled age.\n\nYoshi Yatabe\n\nProgramming Director\n\nAll Films\n\nAsian Future\n\n\"Asian Future\" section, started at TIFF 2013, is for the up-and-coming directors from the Asian region (including Japan and Middle East) to compete with each other in this young cinema competition. Applicant eligibility is now up to three feature films, and as a result, even more varied films are gathered. The biggest feature this year is definitely that five films out of 10 in total (China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Thailand and Japan) are made by female directors. In addition, five films are world premieres (first screening worldwide) and five are international premieres (first screening outside the producing country). Meet the talents that will shoulder the future of Asian film industry at TIFF!\n\nKenji Ishizaka\n\nPrograming Director\n\nAll Films\n\nJapanese Cinema Splash\n\nJapanese Cinema Splash continues to showcase Japan's independent movie scene which has been growing steadily. Rikiya Imaizumi delivers another ensemble romantic comedy. Kenji Yamauchi details an eccentric love affair. Eiji Uchida's black comedy follows a down-and-out director. Ryohei Yoshino warms hearts with an offbeat duo. Those four comedies would definitely make you laugh! We have an exellent line-up of dramas. Ryutaro Nakagawa returns with an autobiographical drama. Hiroshi Shoji's yakuza tale highlights two amazing young actors. Michio Koshikawa debuts with a unique literary thriller. Hirobumi Watanabe resurfaces with a stripped-down, highly affecting work. Together, they represent the future of Japanese cinema.\n\nAll of the films are world premiere.\n\nAll Films\n\nSpecial Screenings\n\nSpecial screenings section presents epic films and topical films before release in Japan. Stars and directors from both Japan and abroad make appearances to glam-up the festival. The main film is the opening The Walk, based on a true story about Philippe Petit who crossed the World Trade Center on a high wire without safety tether when the construction was almost complete. In addition to being excellent as a drama, 3D and CG pioneer Robert Zemeckis has added a sense of depth to tight-rope crossing in a way only achievable in films. This will surely become Joseph Gordon-Levitt's major work. The closing terminal is an adaptation of Naoki award winner Shino Sakuragi's novel of the same title. Moving drama portrays an attorney with lasting emotional scars slowly recover through encounters with various people. Koichi Sato's performance is excellent. All other films are also topical, and watching these at the film festival will be an unforgettable experience. Be sure not to miss them.\n\nAll Films\n\nPanorama\n\nPanorama section showcases various types of topical films and highly-anticipated films which have not been released in Japan. Different guests will make an appearance every day to glam-up the festival.

He is the first Filipino to compete and won in three major international film festivals (Cannes, Venice and Berlin).\n\nAll Films\n\nJapan Now\n\nIt is said that you can understand the culture of the county, if you watch three films of the country.\n\nSixty years ago, Yasujiro Ozu observed the rapid development of Japan after the war and depicted the transformation and collapse of Japanese families and the abandonment of parents by their children over time in Tokyo Story. Filmmakers weave the present of the era into various stories to talk about it, and the viewers find themselves in the stories.\n\nThe current time is a critical one for Japan. We kept referring to it as the post-war era, but 70 years have already passed. Economic struggles, issues with neighboring countries, atitudes toward security, anxiety for future, the senses of happiness, pleasure, and sadness, all these are expressed and presented from various angles by filmmakers in films.\n\n\"Now is the time to let people know Japan 'as of now', and let people feel Japan's aesthetics that still exists clearly, Japanese culture and its appeal\", that is why the \"Japan Now\" section has been created this time.\n\nThis is not exclusively for people from abroad. There is truth here which Japanese people should take a hard look at once again.\n\nKohei Ando\n\nProgramming Advisor\n\nAll Films\n\nJapanese Cinema Classics\n\nOne of the biggest benefits of the digital era in films is improved repair and restoration technology.
