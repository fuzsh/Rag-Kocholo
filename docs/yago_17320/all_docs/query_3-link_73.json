The author describes a fundamental problem in the derivation of the method in spherical coordinates proposed by a pioneer study, which might be unrealized for a quarter century.\n\nA one-dimensional temperature and age modeling study for selecting the drill site of the oldest ice core near Dome Fuji, Antarctica\n\nTakashi Obase, Ayako Abe-Ouchi, Fuyuki Saito, Shun Tsutaki, Shuji Fujita, Kenji Kawamura, and Hideaki Motoyama\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 2543–2562, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2543-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2543-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use a one-dimensional ice-flow model to examine the most suitable core location near Dome Fuji (DF), Antarctica. This model computes the temporal evolution of age and temperature from past to present. We investigate the influence of different parameters of climate and ice sheet on the ice's basal age and compare the results with ground radar surveys. We find that the local ice thickness primarily controls the age because it is critical to the basal melting, which can eliminate the old ice.\n\nTemporal variations of surface mass balance over the last 5000Â years around Dome Fuji, Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica\n\nIkumi Oyabu, Kenji Kawamura, Shuji Fujita, Ryo Inoue, Hideaki Motoyama, Kotaro Fukui, Motohiro Hirabayashi, Yu Hoshina, Naoyuki Kurita, Fumio Nakazawa, Hiroshi Ohno, Konosuke Sugiura, Toshitaka Suzuki, Shun Tsutaki, Ayako Abe-Ouchi, Masashi Niwano, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Parrenin, Fuyuki Saito, and Masakazu Yoshimori\n\nClim.

We found a long-term decreasing trend in the preindustrial period, which may be associated with secular surface cooling and sea ice expansion. Centennial-scale variations were also found, which may partly be related to combinations of volcanic, solar and greenhouse gas forcings. The most rapid and intense increases of accumulation rate occurred since 1850 CE.\n\nHigh-resolution subglacial topography around Dome Fuji, Antarctica, based on ground-based radar surveys over 30 years\n\nShun Tsutaki, Shuji Fujita, Kenji Kawamura, Ayako Abe-Ouchi, Kotaro Fukui, Hideaki Motoyama, Yu Hoshina, Fumio Nakazawa, Takashi Obase, Hiroshi Ohno, Ikumi Oyabu, Fuyuki Saito, Konosuke Sugiura, and Toshitaka Suzuki\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 2967–2983, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-2967-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-2967-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe constructed an ice thickness map across the Dome Fuji region, East Antarctica, from improved radar data and previous data that had been collected since the late 1980s. The data acquired using the improved radar systems allowed basal topography to be identified with higher accuracy. The new ice thickness data show the bedrock topography, particularly the complex terrain of subglacial valleys and highlands south of Dome Fuji, with substantially high detail.\n\nDoes a difference in ice sheets between Marine Isotope Stages 3 and 5a affect the duration of stadials?

Frequency of these climate shifts varied along time: it was shorter during mid-glacial period compared to early glacial period. Here, from climate simulations of early and mid-glacial periods with a comprehensive climate model, we show that the larger ice sheet in the mid-glacial compared to early glacial periods could contribute to the frequent climate shifts during the mid-glacial period.\n\nImplementation of the RCIP scheme and its performance for 1-D age computations in ice-sheet models\n\nFuyuki Saito, Takashi Obase, and Ayako Abe-Ouchi\n\nGeosci.

Comparisons are examined among the RCIP schemes and the first- and second-order upwind schemes. The results show that, in particular, the RCIP scheme preserves the pattern of input histories, in terms of the profile of internal annual layer thickness, better than the other schemes.\n\nProjecting Antarctica's contribution to future sea level rise from basal ice shelf melt using linear response functions of 16 ice sheet models (LARMIP-2)\n\nAnders Levermann, Ricarda Winkelmann, Torsten Albrecht, Heiko Goelzer, Nicholas R.

The full uncertainty range in the warming-related forcing of basal melt is estimated and applied to 16 state-of-the-art ice sheet models using a linear response theory approach. The sea level contribution we obtain is very likely below 61 cm under unmitigated climate change until 2100 (RCP8.5) and very likely below 40 cm if the Paris Climate Agreement is kept.\n\nDescription and basic evaluation of simulated mean state, internal variability, and climate sensitivity in MIROC6\n\nHiroaki Tatebe, Tomoo Ogura, Tomoko Nitta, Yoshiki Komuro, Koji Ogochi, Toshihiko Takemura, Kengo Sudo, Miho Sekiguchi, Manabu Abe, Fuyuki Saito, Minoru Chikira, Shingo Watanabe, Masato Mori, Nagio Hirota, Yoshio Kawatani, Takashi Mochizuki, Kei Yoshimura, Kumiko Takata, Ryouta O'ishi, Dai Yamazaki, Tatsuo Suzuki, Masao Kurogi, Takahito Kataoka, Masahiro Watanabe, and Masahide Kimoto\n\nGeosci.

The climate model represents observed mean climate and climate variations well, for example tropical precipitation, the midlatitude westerlies, and the East Asian monsoon, which influence human activity all over the world. The improved climate simulations could add reliability to climate predictions under global warming.\n\nIce-sheet configuration in the CMIP5/PMIP3 Last Glacial Maximum experiments\n\nA. Abe-Ouchi, F.

The difference in the ice sheet boundary conditions as well as the climate response to them are discussed.\n\nSimulating the Antarctic ice sheet in the late-Pliocene warm period: PLISMIP-ANT, an ice-sheet model intercomparison project\n\nB. de Boer, A.

Our results demonstrate the difficulty of all models used here to simulate a significant retreat or re-advance of the East Antarctic ice grounding line. Improved grounding-line physics could be essential for a correct representation of the migration of the grounding line of the Antarctic ice sheet during the Pliocene.\n\nIce sheet model dependency of the simulated Greenland Ice Sheet in the mid-Pliocene\n\nS.

We quantify ice sheet volume and locations in Greenland and find that the ice sheets are less sensitive to differences in ice sheet model configurations than to changes in imposed climate forcing. We conclude that Pliocene ice was most likely to be limited to highest elevations in eastern and southern Greenland.\n\nClimate dependent contrast in surface mass balance in East Antarctica over the past 216 kyr\n\nF.

The CO2 concentration and the smaller Antarctic Ice Sheet both have a similar and approximately equal impact on the Southern Ocean. The conditions of the Southern Ocean in the mid-Pliocene could therefore be analogous to those in a future climate with smaller ice sheets.\n\nCentroids in second-order conservative remapping schemes on spherical coordinates\n\nFuyuki Saito\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1101,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1101, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA second-order conservative remapping is a common and standard method for transformation of data from one grid system to another in climate studies.

The drivers of these changes are still misunderstood but are often attributed to shifts in the Atlantic Ocean circulation from meltwater input. A cumulative effort to understand these processes prompted numerous simulations of this period. We use these to explain the chain of events and our collective ability to simulate them. The results demonstrate the importance of the meltwater amount used in the simulation.\n\nAssessing transient changes in the ocean carbon cycle during the last deglaciation through carbon isotope modeling\n\nHidetaka Kobayashi, Akira Oka, Takashi Obase, and Ayako Abe-Ouchi\n\nClim.

Our carbon cycle model calculates atmospheric pCO2 changes that are consistent with ice core records but whose magnitude is underestimated. Our analysis of carbon isotopes suggests that improving the expression of activated ocean ventilation and suppressing biological productivity are critical in simulating atmospheric pCO2 changes.\n\nInsights into the vulnerability of Antarctic glaciers from the ISMIP6 ice sheet model ensemble and associated uncertainty\n\nHÃ©lÃ¨ne Seroussi, Vincent Verjans, Sophie Nowicki, Antony J.

We highlight here the Antarctic glaciers showing the largest changes and quantify the main sources of uncertainty in their future evolution using an ensemble of ice flow models. We show that on top of Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers, Totten and Moscow University glaciers show rapid changes and a strong sensitivity to warmer ocean conditions.\n\nMulti-model assessment of the deglacial climatic evolution at high southern latitudes\n\nTakashi Obase, Laurie Menviel, Ayako Abe-Ouchi, Tristan Vadsaria, Ruza Ivanovic, Brooke Snoll, Sam Sherriff-Tadano, Paul Valdes, Lauren Gregoire, Marie-Luise Kapsch, Uwe Mikolajewicz, Nathaelle Bouttes, Didier Roche, Fanny Lhardy, Chengfei He, Bette Otto-Bliesner, Zhengyu Liu, and Wing-Le Chan\n\nClim.

We find that atmospheric CO2 changes and AMOC changes are the primary drivers of the major warming and cooling during the middle stage of the deglaciation. The multi-model analysis highlights the model’s sensitivity of CO2, AMOC to meltwater, and the meltwater history on temperature changes in southern high latitudes.\n\nThe hydrological cycle and ocean circulation of the Maritime Continent in the Pliocene: results from PlioMIP2\n\nXin Ren, Daniel J.

Besides, the fresh and warm water transfer through the Maritime Continent was stronger. In order to avoid undue influence from closely related models in the multimodel results, we introduce a new metric, the multi-cluster mean, which could reveal spatial signals that are not captured by the multimodel mean.\n\nA one-dimensional temperature and age modeling study for selecting the drill site of the oldest ice core near Dome Fuji, Antarctica\n\nTakashi Obase, Ayako Abe-Ouchi, Fuyuki Saito, Shun Tsutaki, Shuji Fujita, Kenji Kawamura, and Hideaki Motoyama\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 2543–2562, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2543-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2543-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use a one-dimensional ice-flow model to examine the most suitable core location near Dome Fuji (DF), Antarctica.

They are widely used to reconstruct the past variations of polar temperature before the instrumental era thanks to their measurements in ice cores. However, the relationship between measured isotopes and temperature has large uncertainties.

We find elevated concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide to be the most important forcing for driving changes in Pliocene surface air temperature, sea surface temperature, and precipitation. However, changes caused by the nature of Pliocene ice sheets and orography are also important, affecting the extent to which we can use the Pliocene as an analogue for our warmer future.\n\nTemporal variations of surface mass balance over the last 5000Â years around Dome Fuji, Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica\n\nIkumi Oyabu, Kenji Kawamura, Shuji Fujita, Ryo Inoue, Hideaki Motoyama, Kotaro Fukui, Motohiro Hirabayashi, Yu Hoshina, Naoyuki Kurita, Fumio Nakazawa, Hiroshi Ohno, Konosuke Sugiura, Toshitaka Suzuki, Shun Tsutaki, Ayako Abe-Ouchi, Masashi Niwano, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Parrenin, Fuyuki Saito, and Masakazu Yoshimori\n\nClim.

The new ice thickness data show the bedrock topography, particularly the complex terrain of subglacial valleys and highlands south of Dome Fuji, with substantially high detail.\n\nReduced El NiÃ±o variability in the mid-Pliocene according to the PlioMIP2 ensemble\n\nArthur M.

It is an interesting period to study, as it saw similar atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to the present day. We find that the El NiÃ±o events were less strong in the mid-Pliocene simulations, when compared to pre-industrial climate. Our results could help to interpret El NiÃ±o behaviour in future climate projections.\n\nDoes a difference in ice sheets between Marine Isotope Stages 3 and 5a affect the duration of stadials?

Frequency of these climate shifts varied along time: it was shorter during mid-glacial period compared to early glacial period. Here, from climate simulations of early and mid-glacial periods with a comprehensive climate model, we show that the larger ice sheet in the mid-glacial compared to early glacial periods could contribute to the frequent climate shifts during the mid-glacial period.\n\nMid-Pliocene West African Monsoon rainfall as simulated in the PlioMIP2 ensemble\n\nEllen Berntell, Qiong Zhang, Qiang Li, Alan M.

Though previous studies of future projections show a west–east drying–wetting contrast over the Sahel, these results indicate a uniform rainfall increase over the Sahel in warm climates characterized by increased greenhouse gas forcing.\n\nThe PMIP4 Last Glacial Maximum experiments: preliminary results and comparison with the PMIP3 simulations\n\nMasa Kageyama, Sandy P.

Here, we compare the latest climate model (CMIP6-PMIP4) to the previous one (CMIP5-PMIP3) and to reconstructions. Large-scale climate features (e.g. land–sea contrast, polar amplification) are well captured by all models, while regional changes (e.g. winter extratropical cooling, precipitations) are still poorly represented.\n\nPMIP4 experiments using MIROC-ES2L Earth system model\n\nRumi Ohgaito, Akitomo Yamamoto, Tomohiro Hajima, Ryouta O'ishi, Manabu Abe, Hiroaki Tatebe, Ayako Abe-Ouchi, and Michio Kawamiya\n\nGeosci.

The ability to simulate the past is also an evaluation of the performance of the model in projecting global warming.

The results showed that the model can generally describe past climate change.\n\nMid-Pliocene Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation simulated in PlioMIP2\n\nZhongshi Zhang, Xiangyu Li, Chuncheng Guo, Odd Helge OtterÃ¥, Kerim H.

Previous studies have suggested a much stronger AMOC during the Pliocene than today. However, our current multi-model intercomparison shows large model spreads and model–data discrepancies, which can not support the previous hypothesis. Our study shows good consistency with future projections of the AMOC.\n\nDeepMIP: model intercomparison of early Eocene climatic optimum (EECO) large-scale climate features and comparison with proxy data\n\nDaniel J.

We show that, in contrast to previous work, at least three models (CESM, GFDL, and NorESM) produce climate states that are consistent with proxy indicators of global mean temperature and polar amplification, and they achieve this at a CO2 concentration that is consistent with the CO2 proxy record.\n\nImpact of mid-glacial ice sheets on deep ocean circulation and global climate\n\nSam Sherriff-Tadano, Ayako Abe-Ouchi, and Akira Oka\n\nClim.

We find that the southward expansion of the mid-glacial ice sheet causes a surface cooling over the North Atlantic and Southern Ocean, but it exerts a small impact on the AMOC due to the competing effects of surface wind and surface cooling.\n\nA multi-model CMIP6-PMIP4 study of Arctic sea ice at 127 ka: sea ice data compilation and model differences\n\nMasa Kageyama, Louise C.

The latest PMIP4-CMIP6 models all simulate this decrease, consistent with reconstructions. However, neither the models nor the reconstructions agree on the possibility of a seasonally ice-free Arctic. Work to clarify the reasons for this model divergence and the conflicting interpretations of the records will thus be needed.\n\nLarge-scale features of Last Interglacial climate: results from evaluating the lig127k simulations for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6)âPaleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project (PMIP4)\n\nBette L.

We present a multi-model ensemble of 17 climate models, most of which have also completed the CMIP6 DECK experiments and are thus important for assessing future projections. The lig127ksimulations show strong summer warming over the NH continents. More than half of the models simulate a retreat of the Arctic minimum summer ice edge similar to the average for 2000–2018.\n\nPMIP4/CMIP6 last interglacial simulations using three different versions of MIROC: importance of vegetation\n\nRyouta O'ishi, Wing-Le Chan, Ayako Abe-Ouchi, Sam Sherriff-Tadano, Rumi Ohgaito, and Masakazu Yoshimori\n\nClim.

We carry out a last interglacial experiment using three versions of general circulation models to reproduce the warm climate indicated by geological evidence. Our result clearly shows that vegetation change in the last interglacial is a necessary factor to predict a strong warming in northern high latitudes, which is indicated by geological evidence.\n\nImplementation of the RCIP scheme and its performance for 1-D age computations in ice-sheet models\n\nFuyuki Saito, Takashi Obase, and Ayako Abe-Ouchi\n\nGeosci.

The full uncertainty range in the warming-related forcing of basal melt is estimated and applied to 16 state-of-the-art ice sheet models using a linear response theory approach. The sea level contribution we obtain is very likely below 61 cm under unmitigated climate change until 2100 (RCP8.5) and very likely below 40 cm if the Paris Climate Agreement is kept.\n\nThe penultimate deglaciation: protocol for Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project (PMIP) phase 4 transient numerical simulations between 140 and 127 ka, version 1.0\n\nLaurie Menviel, Emilie Capron, Aline Govin, Andrea Dutton, Lev Tarasov, Ayako Abe-Ouchi, Russell N.

The climate model represents observed mean climate and climate variations well, for example tropical precipitation, the midlatitude westerlies, and the East Asian monsoon, which influence human activity all over the world. The improved climate simulations could add reliability to climate predictions under global warming.\n\nGlacial CO2 decrease and deep-water deoxygenation by iron fertilization from glaciogenic dust\n\nAkitomo Yamamoto, Ayako Abe-Ouchi, Rumi Ohgaito, Akinori Ito, and Akira Oka\n\nClim.

Here, we report our numerical simulation which successfully reproduces records of glacial oxygen changes and shows the significance of iron supply from glaciogenic dust. Our model simulations clarify that the enhanced efficiency of the biological pump is responsible for glacial CO2 decline of more than 30 ppm and approximately half of deep-ocean deoxygenation.\n\ninitMIP-Antarctica: an ice sheet model initialization experiment of ISMIP6\n\nHÃ©lÃ¨ne Seroussi, Sophie Nowicki, Erika Simon, Ayako Abe-Ouchi, Torsten Albrecht, Julien Brondex, Stephen Cornford, Christophe Dumas, Fabien Gillet-Chaulet, Heiko Goelzer, Nicholas R.

Results are improved compared to previous assessments and show that continued improvements in the representation of the floating ice around Antarctica are critical to reduce the uncertainty in the future ice sheet contribution to sea level rise.\n\nEffect of high dust amount on surface temperature during the Last Glacial Maximum: a modelling study using MIROC-ESM\n\nRumi Ohgaito, Ayako Abe-Ouchi, Ryouta O'ishi, Toshihiko Takemura, Akinori Ito, Tomohiro Hajima, Shingo Watanabe, and Michio Kawamiya\n\nClim.

The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 21000 years before present) is known to be dustier. We investigated the impact of plausible dust distribution on the climate of the LGM using an Earth system model and found that the higher dust load results in less cooling over the polar regions. The main finding is that radiative perturbation by the high dust loading does not necessarily cool the surface surrounding Antarctica.\n\nThe penultimate deglaciation: protocol for PMIP4 transient numerical simulations between 140 and 127 ka\n\nLaurie Menviel, Emilie Capron, Aline Govin, Andrea Dutton, Lev Tarasov, Ayako Abe-Ouchi, Russell Drysdale, Philip Gibbard, Lauren Gregoire, Feng He, Ruza Ivanovic, Masa Kageyama, Kenji Kawamura, Amaelle Landais, Bette L.

Here, as part of the PAGES-PMIP working group on Quaternary Interglacials, we propose a protocol to perform transient simulations of the penultimate deglaciation as well as a selection of paleo records for upcoming model-data comparisons.\n\nLong-term response of oceanic carbon uptake to global warming via physical and biological pumps\n\nAkitomo Yamamoto, Ayako Abe-Ouchi, and Yasuhiro Yamanaka\n\nBiogeosciences, 15, 4163–4180, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-4163-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-4163-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMillennial-scale changes in oceanic CO2 uptake due to global warming are simulated by a GCM and offline biogeochemical model. Sensitivity studies show that decreases in oceanic CO2 uptake are mainly caused by a weaker biological pump and seawater warming. Enhanced CO2 uptake due to weaker equatorial upwelling cancels out reduced CO2 uptake due to weaker AMOC and AABW formation. Thus, circulation change plays only a small direct role in reduction of CO2 uptake due to global warming.\n\nDesign and results of the ice sheet model initialisation experiments initMIP-Greenland: an ISMIP6 intercomparison\n\nHeiko Goelzer, Sophie Nowicki, Tamsin Edwards, Matthew Beckley, Ayako Abe-Ouchi, Andy Aschwanden, Reinhard Calov, Olivier Gagliardini, Fabien Gillet-Chaulet, Nicholas R.

Kalita, Christiaan R. Diemont, Stephen J. Livingstone, Chris D. Clark, and Martin Margold\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 2407–2428, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2407-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2407-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA Baltic-wide glacial landform-based map is presented, filling in a geographical gap in the record that has been speculated about by palaeoglaciologists for over a century. Here we used newly available bathymetric data and provide landform evidence of corridors of fast ice flow that we interpret as ice streams. Where previous ice-sheet-scale investigations inferred a single ice source, our mapping identifies flow and ice margin geometries from both Swedish and Bothnian sources.\n\nAssessing the potential for ice flow piracy between the Totten and Vanderford glaciers, East Antarctica\n\nFelicity S. McCormack, Jason L. Roberts, Bernd Kulessa, Alan Aitken, Christine F. Dow, Lawrence Bird, Benjamin K. Galton-Fenzi, Katharina Hochmuth, Richard S. Jones, Andrew N. Mackintosh, and Koi McArthur\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4549–4569, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4549-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4549-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nChanges in Antarctic surface elevation can cause changes in ice and basal water flow, impacting how much ice enters the ocean. We find that ice and basal water flow could divert from the Totten to the Vanderford Glacier, East Antarctica, under only small changes in the surface elevation, with implications for estimates of ice loss from this region. Further studies are needed to determine when this could occur and if similar diversions could occur elsewhere in Antarctica due to climate change.\n\nStagnant ice and age modelling in the Dome C region, Antarctica\n\nAilsa Chung, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Parrenin, Daniel Steinhage, Robert Mulvaney, Carlos MartÃ­n, Marie G. P. Cavitte, David A. Lilien, Veit Helm, Drew Taylor, Prasad Gogineni, Catherine Ritz, Massimo Frezzotti, Charles O'Neill, Heinrich Miller, Dorthe Dahl-Jensen, and Olaf Eisen\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 3461–3483, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-3461-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-3461-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe combined a numerical model with radar measurements in order to determine the age of ice in the Dome C region of Antarctica. Our results show that at the current ice core drilling sites on Little Dome C, the maximum age of the ice is almost 1.5 Ma. We also highlight a new potential drill site called North Patch with ice up to 2 Ma. Finally, we explore the nature of a stagnant ice layer at the base of the ice sheet which has been independently observed and modelled but is not well understood.\n\nPolar firn properties in Greenland and Antarctica and related effects on microwave brightness temperatures\n\nHaokui Xu, Brooke Medley, Leung Tsang, Joel T. Johnson, Kenneth C. Jezek, Macro Brogioni, and Lars Kaleschke\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 2793–2809, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2793-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2793-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe density profile of polar ice sheets is a major unknown in estimating the mass loss using lidar tomography methods. In this paper, we show that combing the active radar data and passive radiometer data can provide an estimation of density properties using the new model we implemented in this paper. The new model includes the short and long timescale variations in the firn and also the refrozen layers which are not included in the previous modeling work.\n\nA model of the weathering crust and microbial activity on an ice-sheet surface\n\nTilly Woods and Ian J. Hewitt\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 1967–1987, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-1967-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-1967-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSolar radiation causes melting at and just below the surface of the Greenland ice sheet, forming a porous surface layer known as the weathering crust. The weathering crust is home to many microbes, and the growth of these microbes is linked to the melting of the weathering crust and vice versa. We use a mathematical model to investigate what controls the size and structure of the weathering crust, the number of microbes within it, and its sensitivity to climate change.\n\nPISM-LakeCC: Implementing an adaptive proglacial lake boundary in an ice sheet model\n\nSebastian Hinck, Evan J. Gowan, Xu Zhang, and Gerrit Lohmann\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 941–965, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-941-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-941-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nProglacial lakes were pervasive along the retreating continental ice margins after the Last Glacial Maximum. Similarly to the marine ice boundary, interactions at the ice-lake interface impact ice sheet dynamics and mass balance. Previous numerical ice sheet modeling studies did not include a dynamical lake boundary. We describe the implementation of an adaptive lake boundary condition in PISM and apply the model to the glacial retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet.\n\nRemapping of Greenland ice sheet surface mass balance anomalies for large ensemble sea-level change projections\n\nHeiko Goelzer, Brice P. Y. NoÃ«l, Tamsin L. Edwards, Xavier Fettweis, Jonathan M. Gregory, William H. Lipscomb, Roderik S. W. van de Wal, and Michiel R. van den Broeke\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 1747–1762, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-1747-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-1747-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFuture sea-level change projections with process-based ice sheet models are typically driven with surface mass balance forcing derived from climate models. In this work we address the problems arising from a mismatch of the modelled ice sheet geometry with the one used by the climate model. The proposed remapping method reproduces the original forcing data closely when applied to the original geometry and produces a physically meaningful forcing when applied to different modelled geometries.\n\nBrief communication: On calculating the sea-level contribution in marine ice-sheet models\n\nHeiko Goelzer, Violaine Coulon, Frank Pattyn, Bas de Boer, and Roderik van de Wal\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 833–840, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-833-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-833-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn our ice-sheet modelling experience and from exchange with colleagues in different groups, we found that it is not always clear how to calculate the sea-level contribution from a marine ice-sheet model. This goes hand in hand with a lack of documentation and transparency in the published literature on how the sea-level contribution is estimated in different models. With this brief communication, we hope to stimulate awareness and discussion in the community to improve on this situation.\n\nA simple stress-based cliff-calving law\n\nTanja Schlemm and Anders Levermann\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 2475–2488, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-2475-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-2475-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe provide a simple stress-based parameterization for cliff calving of ice sheets. According to the resulting increasing dependence of the calving rate on ice thickness, the parameterization might lead to a runaway ice loss in large parts of Greenland and Antarctica.\n\nScaling of instability timescales of Antarctic outlet glaciers based on one-dimensional similitude analysis\n\nAnders Levermann and Johannes Feldmann\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 1621–1633, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-1621-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-1621-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUsing scaling analysis we propose that the currently observed marine ice-sheet instability in the Amundsen Sea sector might be faster than all other potential instabilities in Antarctica.\n\nA statistical fracture model for Antarctic ice shelves and glaciers\n\nVeronika Emetc, Paul Tregoning, Mathieu Morlighem, Chris Borstad, and Malcolm Sambridge\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 3187–3213, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3187-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3187-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe paper includes a model that can be used to predict zones of fracture formation in both floating and grounded ice in Antarctica. We used observations and a statistics-based model to predict fractures in most ice shelves in Antarctica as an alternative to the damage-based approach. We can predict the location of observed fractures with an average success rate of 84% for grounded ice and 61% for floating ice and mean overestimation error of 26% and 20%, respectively.\n\nModelled fracture and calving on the Totten Ice Shelf\n\nSue Cook, Jan Ã strÃ¶m, Thomas Zwinger, Benjamin Keith Galton-Fenzi, Jamin Stevens Greenbaum, and Richard Coleman\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 2401–2411, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-2401-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-2401-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe growth of fractures on Antarctic ice shelves is important because it controls the amount of ice lost as icebergs. We use a model constructed of multiple interconnected blocks to predict the locations where fractures will form on the Totten Ice Shelf in East Antarctica. The results show that iceberg calving is controlled not only by fractures forming near the front of the ice shelf but also by fractures which formed many kilometres upstream.\n\nDesign and results of the ice sheet model initialisation experiments initMIP-Greenland: an ISMIP6 intercomparison\n\nHeiko Goelzer, Sophie Nowicki, Tamsin Edwards, Matthew Beckley, Ayako Abe-Ouchi, Andy Aschwanden, Reinhard Calov, Olivier Gagliardini, Fabien Gillet-Chaulet, Nicholas R.

Compared to earlier community-wide comparisons, we find better agreement across different models, which implies overall improvement of our understanding of what is needed to produce such initial states.\n\nIncreased West Antarctic and unchanged East Antarctic ice discharge over the last 7 years\n\nAlex S. Gardner, Geir Moholdt, Ted Scambos, Mark Fahnstock, Stefan Ligtenberg, Michiel van den Broeke, and Johan Nilsson\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 521–547, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-521-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-521-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe map present-day Antarctic surface velocities from Landsat imagery and compare to earlier estimates from radar. Flow accelerations across the grounding lines of West Antarctica's Amundsen Sea Embayment, Getz Ice Shelf and the western Antarctic Peninsula, account for 89â¯% of the observed increase in ice discharge. In contrast, glaciers draining the East Antarctic have been remarkably stable. Our work suggests that patterns of mass loss are part of a longer-term phase of enhanced flow.\n\nInfluence of temperature fluctuations on equilibrium\n\nice sheet volume\n\nTroels BÃ¸geholm Mikkelsen, Aslak Grinsted, and Peter Ditlevsen\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 39–47, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-39-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-39-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe atmospheric temperature increase poses a real risk of ice sheets collapsing. We show that this risk might have been underestimated since variations in temperature will move the ice sheets to the tipping point of destabilization. We show this by using a simple computer model of a large ice sheet and investigate what happens if the temperature varies from year to year. The total volume of the ice sheet decreases because a cold year followed by an equally warm year do not cancel out.\n\nGPS-derived estimates of surface mass balance and ocean-induced basal melt for Pine Island Glacier ice shelf, Antarctica\n\nDavid E. Shean, Knut Christianson, Kristine M. Larson, Stefan R. M. Ligtenberg, Ian R. Joughin, Ben E. Smith, C. Max Stevens, Mitchell Bushuk, and David M. Holland\n\nThe Cryosphere, 11, 2655–2674, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-2655-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-2655-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe used long-term GPS data and interferometric reflectometry (GPS-IR) to measure velocity, strain rate and surface elevation for the PIG ice shelf – a site of significant mass loss in recent decades. We combined these observations with high-res DEMs and firn model output to constrain surface mass balance and basal melt rates. We document notable spatial variability in basal melt rates but limited temporal variability from 2012 to 2014 despite significant changes in sub-shelf ocean heat content.\n\nAnalysis of ice shelf flexure and its InSAR representation in the grounding zone of the southern McMurdo Ice Shelf\n\nWolfgang Rack, Matt A. King, Oliver J. Marsh, Christian T. Wild, and Dana Floricioiu\n\nThe Cryosphere, 11, 2481–2490, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-2481-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-2481-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPredicting changes of the Antarctic Ice Sheet involves fully understanding ice dynamics at the transition between grounded and floating ice. We map tidal bending of ice by satellite using InSAR, and we use precise GPS measurements with assumptions of tidal elastic bending to better interpret the satellite signal. It allows us to better define the grounding-line position and to refine the shape of tidal flexure profiles.\n\nBoundary layer models for calving marine outlet glaciers\n\nChristian Schoof, Andrew D. Davis, and Tiberiu V. Popa\n\nThe Cryosphere, 11, 2283–2303, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-2283-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-2283-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe show mathematically and computationally how discharge of ice from ocean-terminating glaciers is controlled by a combination of different forces acting on ice near the grounding line of a glacier and how that combination of forces is affected by the process of iceberg formation, which limits the length of floating ice tongues extending in front of the glacier. We show that a deeper fjord may lead to a longer ice tongue providing greater drag on the glacier, slowing the rate of ice discharge.\n\nLiquid water content in ice estimated through a full-depth ground radar profile and borehole measurements in western Greenland\n\nJoel Brown, Joel Harper, and Neil Humphrey\n\nThe Cryosphere, 11, 669–679, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-669-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-669-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use ground-penetrating radar surveys in conjunction with borehole depth and temperature data to estimate the liquid water content (wetness) of glacial ice in the ablation zone of an outlet glacier on the western side of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Our results show that the wetness of a warm basal ice layer is approximately 2.9 % to 4.6 % in our study region. This high level of wetness requires special attention when modelling ice dynamics or estimating ice thickness in the region.\n\nDynamic influence of pinning points on marine ice-sheet stability: a numerical study in Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica\n\nLionel Favier, Frank Pattyn, Sophie Berger, and Reinhard Drews\n\nThe Cryosphere, 10, 2623–2635, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-2623-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-2623-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe demonstrate the short-term unstable retreat of an East Antarctic outlet glacier triggered by imposed sub-ice-shelf melt, compliant with current values, using a state-of-the-art ice-sheet model. We show that pinning points – topographic highs in contact with the ice-shelf base – have a major impact on ice-sheet stability and timing of grounding-line retreat. The study therefore calls for improving our knowledge of sub-ice-shelf bathymetry in order to reduce uncertainties in future ice loss.\n\nPersistence and variability of ice-stream grounding lines on retrograde bed slopes\n\nAlexander A. Robel, Christian Schoof, and Eli Tziperman\n\nThe Cryosphere, 10, 1883–1896, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-1883-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-1883-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPortions of the Antarctic Ice Sheet edge that rest on upward-sloping beds have the potential to collapse irreversibly and raise global sea level. Using a numerical model, we show that changes in the slipperiness of sediments beneath fast-flowing ice streams can cause them to persist on upward-sloping beds for hundreds to thousands of years before reversing direction. This type of behavior is important to consider as a possibility when interpreting observations of ongoing ice sheet change.\n\nSimilitude of ice dynamics against scaling of geometry and physical parameters\n\nJohannes Feldmann and Anders Levermann\n\nThe Cryosphere, 10, 1753–1769, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-1753-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-1753-2016, 2016\n\nAn ice-sheet-wide framework for englacial attenuation from ice-penetrating radar data\n\nT. M. Jordan, J. L. Bamber, C. N. Williams, J. D. Paden, M. J. Siegert, P. Huybrechts, O. Gagliardini, and F. Gillet-Chaulet\n\nThe Cryosphere, 10, 1547–1570, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-1547-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-1547-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce penetrating radar enables determination of the basal properties of ice sheets. Existing algorithms assume stationarity in the attenuation rate, which is not justifiable at an ice sheet scale. We introduce the first ice-sheet-wide algorithm for radar attenuation that incorporates spatial variability, using the temperature field from a numerical model as an initial guess. The study is a step toward ice-sheet-wide data products for basal properties and evaluation of model temperature fields.\n\nInversion of geothermal heat flux in a thermomechanically coupled nonlinear Stokes ice sheet model\n\nHongyu Zhu, Noemi Petra, Georg Stadler, Tobin Isaac, Thomas J. R. Hughes, and Omar Ghattas\n\nThe Cryosphere, 10, 1477–1494, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-1477-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-1477-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe study how well the basal geothermal heat flux can be inferred from surface velocity observations using a thermomechanically coupled nonlinear Stokes ice sheet model. The prospects and limitations of this inversion is studied in two and three dimensional model problems. We also argue that a one-way coupled approach for the adjoint equations motivated by staggered solvers for forward multiphysics problems can lead to an incorrect gradient and premature termination of the optimization iteration.\n\nThe influence of a model subglacial lake on ice dynamics and internal layering\n\nEythor Gudlaugsson, Angelika Humbert, Thomas Kleiner, Jack Kohler, and Karin Andreassen\n\nThe Cryosphere, 10, 751–760, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-751-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-751-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper explores the influence of a subglacial lake on ice dynamics and internal layers by means of numerical modelling as well as simulating the effect of a subglacial drainage event on isochrones. We provide an explanation for characteristic dip and ridge features found at the edges of many subglacial lakes and conclude that draining lakes can result in travelling waves at depth within isochrones, thus indicating the possibility of detecting past drainage events with ice penetrating radar.\n\nSheet, stream, and shelf flow as progressive ice-bed uncoupling: Byrd Glacier, Antarctica and Jakobshavn Isbrae, Greenland\n\nT. Hughes, A. Sargent, J. Fastook, K. Purdon, J. Li, J.-B. Yan, and S. Gogineni\n\nThe Cryosphere, 10, 193–225, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-193-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-193-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets are drained primarily by fast ice streams that end as ice shelves if they become afloat. Smooth transitions from slow sheet flow to fast stream flow to confined shelf flow are obtained and applied to Byrd Glacier in Antarctica after two upstream subglacial lakes suddenly drained in 2006, and to Jakobshavn Isbrae in Greenland after a confined ice shelf suddenly disintegrated in 2002. Byrd Glacier quickly stabilized, but Jakobshavn Isbrae remains unstable.\n\nElevation change of the Greenland Ice Sheet due to surface mass balance and firn processes, 1960â2014\n\nP. Kuipers Munneke, S. R. M. Ligtenberg, B. P. Y. NoÃ«l, I. M. Howat, J. E. Box, E. Mosley-Thompson, J. R. McConnell, K. Steffen, J. T. Harper, S. B. Das, and M.

The marginal thinning is caused by compaction, and by more melt. This knowledge is important: there are satellites that measure volume change of the ice sheet. It can be caused by increased ice discharge, or by compaction of the snow layer. Here, we quantify the latter, so that we can translate volume to mass change.\n\nIce sheet mass loss caused by dust and black carbon accumulation\n\nT. Goelles, C. E. BÃ¸ggild, and R. Greve\n\nThe Cryosphere, 9, 1845–1856, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-1845-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-1845-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSoot (black carbon) and dust particles darken the surface of ice sheets and glaciers as they accumulate. This causes more ice to melt, which releases more particles from within the ice. This positive feedback mechanism is studied with a new two-dimensional model, mimicking the conditions of Greenland, under different climate warming scenarios. In the warmest scenario, the additional ice sheet mass loss until the year 3000 is up to 7%.\n\nTemporal variations in the flow of a large Antarctic ice stream controlled by tidally induced changes in the subglacial water system\n\nS.

Green\n\nThe Cryosphere, 9, 1649–1661, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-1649-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-1649-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use a full-Stokes model to investigate the long period modulation of Rutford Ice Stream flow by the ocean tide. We find that using a nonlinear sliding law cannot fully explain the measurements and an additional mechanism, whereby tidally induced subglacial pressure variations are transmitted upstream from the grounding line, is also required to match the large amplitude and decay length scale of the observations.\n\nEvolution of ice-shelf channels in Antarctic ice shelves\n\nR. Drews\n\nThe Cryosphere, 9, 1169–1181, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-1169-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-1169-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFloating ice shelves extend the continental ice of Antarctica seawards and mediate ice-ocean interactions. Many ice shelves are incised with channels where basal melting is enhanced. With data and modeling it is shown how the channel geometry depends on basal melting and along-flow advection (also for channels which are not freely floating), and how channel formation imprints the general flow pattern. This opens up the opportunity to map the channel formation from surface velocities only.\n\nOceanic and atmospheric forcing of Larsen C Ice-Shelf thinning\n\nP. R. Holland, A. Brisbourne, H. F. J. Corr, D. McGrath, K. Purdon, J. Paden, H. A. Fricker, F. S. Paolo, and A. H. Fleming\n\nThe Cryosphere, 9, 1005–1024, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-1005-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-1005-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAntarctic Peninsula ice shelves have collapsed in recent decades. The surface of Larsen C Ice Shelf is lowering, but the cause of this has not been understood. This study uses eight radar surveys to show that the lowering is caused by both ice loss and a loss of air from the ice shelf's snowpack. At least two different processes are causing the lowering. The stability of Larsen C may be at risk from an ungrounding of Bawden Ice Rise or ice-front retreat past a 'compressive"
