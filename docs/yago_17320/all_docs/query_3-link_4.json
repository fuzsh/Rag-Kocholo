As a child, he paid frequent visits to the Shimbashi Enbujō as well as movie theaters, Kabuki-za, and other theaters under the influence of his mother who was a former dancer of the Shochiku Revue Company. In kindergarten, he began to study (Nihon Buyō) at Fujima School of Japanese Dance where Nakamura Kanzaburō XVIII was one of his peers. Around that time, he became absorbed in Hollywood films and began to learn about musicals. When he was in elementary school, he began practicing Tea ceremony. He was brought up right in the middle of Hanamachi, a Japanese courtesan and geisha district.\n\nWhile in high school, he was cast as the leading role in the school's theater club production of Godspell in which he made his acting debut. This musical received positive reviews and was featured in the Kinema Shunpo magazine. He proceeded to attend Tamagawa University, where he majored in Theater in the College of Arts. In the middle of his senior year, he was cast as a dancer in the musical Pippin.\n\nEarly career\n\n[edit]\n\nHe debuted as a dancer in 1980. He performed in musicals such as Hair, Annie Get Your Gun, and Chicago, and devoted his time to dance and choreography. He visited New York repeatedly, and studied in London for two years beginning in 1985.\n\nHe made his directing debut with his original musical I Got Merman in 1987. The following year, he received the Agency for Cultural Affairs' Performing Arts Festival Award.\n\nInternational career highlights\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm “BEAT”\n\nIn 1998, Miyamoto made his film-directing debut with BEAT which was officially invited to the 55th Venice International Film Festival's International Film Critics' Week.\n\nMusical “Pacific Overtures”\n\nIn 2000, Miyamoto directed the musical Pacific Overtures at The New National Theater, Tokyo. During the run of the production, Stephen Sondheim, the composer of the musical, was in Tokyo participating in an award ceremony of the Praemium Imperiale (\"World Culture Prize in Memory of His Imperial Highness Prince Takamatsu\"), and John Weidman, the lyricist of the musical, was also in Tokyo for a musical produced by Shiki Company. Both of them came to see Miyamoto's production of Pacific Overtures. Sondheim, whom Miyamoto worships, spoke very highly of the production and Miyamoto’s direction during his speech at the ceremony of the Praemium Imperiale, instead of taking about his own achievements. In 2002, Miyamoto’s Pacific Overtures was presented at the Lincoln Center Festival, and then at The Kennedy Center in Washington D.C. In 2004, Miyamoto made his Broadway debut with Pacific Overtures as the first Asian director on Broadway. In 2005, the production was nominated for Tony Awards under four categories.\n\nMusical “I Got Merman”\n\nIn 2001, Amon was in New York City to direct I Got Merman at the Rich Forum Theater, Stamford Center in Connecticut. The production opened only a few days after the September 11 attacks. On the morning of the terrorist attacks, Miyamoto was at the Grand Central Terminal, heading to the rehearsal. Even though the show did open, Miyamoto felt extremely stressed and left for Bangkok, Thailand two weeks later to escape from the chaos. On his first day in Bangkok, he was severely injured in a car accident but miraculously escaped death.\n\nContemporary Opera “TEA: A Mirror of Soul”\n\nIn 2007, upon composer Tan Dun’s recommendation, Miyamoto directed the first opera style production of TEA: A Mirror of Soul, premiered at the Santa Fe Opera in the U.S. The revival production was presented at Opera Company of Philadelphia (conducted by Tan Dun himself) in the U.S. in 2010 and at the Vancouver Opera in Canada in 2013.\n\nMusical “Up in the Air”\n\nUp in the Air is a musical based on “Boonah, the Tree-Climbing Frog,” a book by Tsutomu Minakami. Henry Krieger, the composer of Dreamgirls wrote the music, and the production had its world premiere at The Kennedy Center in Washington D.C. in 2008.\n\nMusical “The Fantasticks”\n\nHe made his West End debut with The Fantasticks in June 2010.\n\nPlay “The Temple of the Golden Pavilion”\n\nInaugurated as the Artistic Director of Kanagawa Arts Theatre in April 2010, he directed The Temple of the Golden Pavilion, a play based on the novel by Yukio Mishima, as the venue's inaugural production in January 2011. In July, it was presented at the Lincoln Center Festival as Miyamoto's second production at the festival (following Pacific Overtures). Following the successful run in the U.S., the production was revived in Japan (Tokyo and Osaka) in January 2012.\n\nOpera “DIE ZAUBERFLÖTE” (The Magic Flute)\n\nIn 2013, he directed Mozart's opera DIE ZAUBERFLÖTE (The Magic Flute) at the Landestheater Linz in Austria.\n\nJapanese Noh Theatre x 3D Live Theatre “YUGEN The Hidden Beauty of Japan”\n\nIn 2016, he created and directed YUGEN: The Hidden Beauty of Japan, the world's first 3D live theater featuring Japanese Noh theater at the Singapore River Nights Festival.\n\nOpera “The Temple of The Golden Pavilion”\n\nIn 2018, he directed the opera The Temple of The Golden Pavilion, based on the novel by Yukio Mishima, at Opéra national du Rhin in Strasbourg and Mulhouse, France.\n\nJapanese Noh Theatre x 3D Live Theatre “YUGEN The Hidden Beauty of Japan”\n\nIn 2018, he directed YUGEN: The Hidden Beauty of Japan at the Royal Opera of Versailles. The special one night performance was attended by President Emmanuel Macron of France and Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan.\n\nSelected works\n\n[edit]\n\nOpera / Operetta\n\n[edit]\n\nTITLE STAFF/
