        "text": "These credits have been adapted from the end credits of the Japanese original, International, North American, European PlayStation, and PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows 10 and Nintendo Switch versions of Final Fantasy VII.\n\nThe Japanese credits are in two sections. The first section has a screen of credits fade on and off the screen at a time, while the second section has the credits scroll up. During the first section, staff are credited with their Japanese name and a romanization. During the second section only the Japanese name is credited, except for the final few credits. All staff positions are written in English and are singular, with exception going to company names which use their official company name.\n\nThe International credits differ from the original slightly, adding people involved in the additional FMVs, crediting a different soprano on the \"The Creation\" excerpt, and making a correction from \"Sephiros Choir\" to \"Sephiroth Choir\".\n\nThe North American version (released before the International version) re-designed the entire thing is scrolling. There is no Japanese text in the North American credits, and some English names differ from the romanizations making them more phonetically accurate (e.g. \"Hirokatu Sasaki\" > \"Hirokatsu Sasaki\", but \"Kenzi Nagashima\" remains), and switches the order of some names that were in the wrong order (\"Yasui Kentarow\" (surname, first name) > \"Kentarow Yasui\") although . In the portion of the credits that were not originally in English, there are various newly introduced examples of these things (\"Sigeko Sogame\", \"Okayama Yousuke\" (surname, first name)). The North American staff roles always use plural, and some (but not all) typos in staff names were corrected. The North American also rearranged some of the credits, and erroneously moved some names to different sections. The credited \"The Creation\" Soprano is the same as in the Japanese original. Additional credits are added for Square Soft USA (the localization), and SCEA (the publishing).\n\nThe European version (released after the International version) also re-designed the credits to be entirely scrolling, although it leaves longer gaps between sections, usually allowing a credit to leave the screen before another comes on. This means the credits scroll faster than the other version but are technically longer. The romanizations of the names are the same as in the North American version. The staff positions haphazardly use a mixture of singular and plural. The erroneous moving of names was not copied from the North American version, but some of the reorganizations were. The credited \"The Creation\" Soprano is the same as the Japanese International. The Square Soft USA credits are the same as in the North American version, and SCEE credits for publishing are added.\n\nThe North American credits removed Takaharu Matsuo from the Battle Stage Designers credits, meanwhile introducing Masahide Tanaka. The European credits kept Masahide Tanaka as a Battle Stage Designer and re-added Takaharu Matsuo, however Takaharu Matsuo was removed as a Background Designer.\n\nThe European credits adds \"Aiko Ito\" to the Special Thanks section.\n\nThe PC 1998 credits were manually recreated based on the North American version and therefore all of the preexisting typos were fixed. At the same time, many more errors were introduced on staff names including some being missed entirely. The PC version has its own extended credits for Square Soft USA, and adds credits for Eidos, Intermetrics, Yamaha, and a list of other companies.\n\nAll other PC versions and those based on it (the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch versions) do not change the credits. Instead the PC 2012 version adds a separate credits section to its launcher, and the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch versions adds a separate option for additional credits to the title screen.\n\nIn all versions there are also credits listed if one does waits on the title screen without inputs. Some of these credits use different romanizations. Only the main credits are here, but it is notable for using different romanizations and them not being corrected in the English versions.\n\nNames and positions are credited in capital letters in the credits, but have been made lowercase for this article. Names are as written in the English versions, for the Japanese names see Final Fantasy VII translations#Credits. The order of the credits are based on the Japanese versions. PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows 10 and Nintendo Switch are included in \"PC versions\" mentioned below, unless specifically referring to its \"additional credits\".\n\nCredits[]\n\nSquare Product Development, Dept.#1[]\n\nProducer\n\nHironobu Sakaguchi\n\nDirector\n\nYoshinori Kitase\n\nMusic Composer\n\nNobuo Uematsu\n\nMain Programmer\n\nKen Narita\n\nCharacter Design & Battle Visual Director\n\nTetsuya Nomura\n\nArt Director\n\nYusuke Naora\n\nImage Illustrator\n\nYoshitaka Amano\n\nCG Supervisor\n\nKazuyuki Hashimoto\n\nCG Movie Director\n\nMotonori Sakakibara\n\nCharacter Modeling Director\n\nTomohiro Kayano\n\nMain Character Modeler[nb 1]\n\nHiroshi Arai\n\nMagic Effect Director\n\nHirokatsu Sasaki[nb 2]\n\nSpecial Magic Effect Director\n\nShintaroh Takai[nb 3]\n\nBattle Stage Director\n\nAkira Fujii\n\nGraphic Outside Contractor Art Director\n\nHitoshi Sasaki\n\nOutside Contractor Coordinator\n\nHiroyoshi Hamada[nb 4]\n\nAnimation Director\n\nHidetoshi Omori[nb 5]\n\nBattle Plan Director\n\nYasushi Matsumura[nb 6][nb 7]\n\nMap Plan Director\n\nHidetoshi Kezuka\n\nMap Plan Co-directors\n\nBattle Programmer\n\nHiroshi Harata\n\nCharacter Programmer\n\nHiroshi Kawai\n\nCD & Movie Programmer\n\nShun Moriya\n\nSound Programmer\n\nMinoru Akao\n\nSound Engineer\n\nEiji Nakamura\n\nMA & Recording Engineer\n\nKenzi Nagashima[nb 8]\n\nStory By\n\nBased on the Story By\n\nField Section[]\n\nProgrammer\n\nKeizo Kokubo\n\nEvent Planners\n\nSpecial Thanks\n\nMap Planners\n\nConcept Art By\n\nBackground Designers\n\nSub-character & Character Texture Designer\n\nKazuhiro Okawa\n\nAssistant Character Designer\n\nFumi Nakashima\n\nBattle Section[]\n\nProgammers\n\nCG Progammer\n\nMasaharu Inoue\n\nPlanners\n\nSpecial Thanks\n\nToshiaki Suzuki\n\nBattle Stage Designers\n\nMasahide Tanaka[nb 11]\n\nMonster Designers[nb 12]\n\n2D Animators\n\nMagic Effects Section[]\n\nWorld Map Section[]\n\n[nb 15]\n\nChocobo Race Section[]\n\nProgammer\n\nKeitaro Adachi\n\nCondor War Section[]\n\nProgammer\n\nRyu Moto\n\nSubmarine Chase Section[]\n\nProgammer\n\nShin-ichi Tanaka\n\nGraphic Designers\n\nPlanner\n\nMotomu Toriyama\n\nHighway & Roller Coaster Section[]\n\nProgammer\n\nTatsuya Yoshinari\n\nSnowboard Section[]\n\nProgammer\n\nTadamichi Obinata\n\nCG Movie Section[]\n\nField CG & Movie Designers\n\nMovie Engineers\n\nBanpresto Co, Ltd.[nb 16]\n\nBattle CG Support[]\n\nMonster Animators\n\nMonster Modeling[nb 19]\n\nSound Effect\n\nSephiroth Choir[]\n\nSoprano\n\nAlto\n\nTenor\n\nBass\n\nExcerpts from \"The Creation\"[]\n\nComposed by Joseph Haydn\n\nSoprano (JORG, NA, PC)[nb 20]\n\nMatsue Fukushima\n\nSoprano (JINT, EU)[nb 20]\n\nMinae Fujisaki\n\nTenor\n\nDaisuke Hara[nb 21]\n\nSynthesizer\n\nMasashi Hamauzu\n\nSquare USA Staff[]\n\nTool Programmers - LA\n\nCG Designers - LA\n\nLA Unit-Coordinators\n\nCG Outside Contractors[]\n\nField & Movie Section[]\n\nLinks Corporation\n\nLinks became Links DigiWorks in 2000 before merging into Imagica in 2010.
