        "text": "I am rarely affected by celebrity deaths, but when it was revealed that Wes Craven had passed away on August 30, 2015, weeks after his 76th birthday, I was devastated. Never before had I been so moved by the loss of a person I’d never met. I’ve written several tributes to horror icons over the past few years and have generally approached them from a bit of a distance, keeping my own experience out of them, but with Craven, I’m going to take a different approach.\n\nWith icons of the past, their biographies are not so well known and so I presented their lives as an unfolding story as best I could. It seems to me, however, that most fans of Wes Craven have a basic idea of his biography—born August 2, 1939 in Cleveland, Ohio; abandoned by his father who died soon after at a very young age; raised in a fundamentalist Baptist church that forbade the watching of movies; went off to college and discovered a world away from his traditional faith, became a college professor, then quit to become a filmmaker first in New York, then Hollywood.\n\nHis career was marked by genre-defining innovation and creativity-crushing studio interference. As a filmmaker he changed the face of horror three times with The Last House on the Left (1972), A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), and Scream (1996) and, though he longed to make films in other arenas, was rarely given the opportunity. Still, there are few filmmakers that have had a more profound impact on a given milieu or the people who love it than Craven. And so I chose this more personal approach for several reasons, the greatest being the profound impact that Wes Craven has had on me as a film-lover and horror fan. I have a feeling I’m not alone in that.\n\nOver the years I have discovered several things that Wes and I have in common—religious upbringing, starting careers in different fields than we eventually landed, teaching, playing guitar, and a gnawing need to express ourselves creatively. My religious youth was far less strict than Wes’s, but my parents were cautious about the kinds of movies I could see, especially when it came to horror. For the most part PG-rated movies were fine with them, unless of course they involved the scary stuff. The Universal Monsters were alright, but Poltergeist, Jaws, Ghostbusters, and Gremlins were all no-gos when I was young, and I had to rely on my friends for all the creepy details. This was probably for the best as I was a very nervous child and susceptible to nightmares, but that didn’t stop me from haunting the horror aisle at the video store, which is where I had my first encounter with Wes Craven.\n\nI found several VHS covers to be creepy but the one that really freaked me out featured a wide-eyed girl in bed with gleaming knives hovering over her face and a hint of a skull with a rictus grin in the upper left. It didn’t even take seeing the movie for A Nightmare on Elm Street to give me bad dreams, that image was enough.\n\nI distinctly remember finding out from a friend’s older relative (maybe a brother or cousin) that it was a really scary one, and the consensus among my friends, though few had actually seen it, was that it was the scariest movie ever made. I became obsessed. Before long, Freddy fever rose in the public and I found a book at the library called The Nightmare on Elm Street Companion by Jeffrey Cooper. It was in these pages that I first encountered the name Wes Craven. Not only was his name in the book but his picture—and he kinda looked like my dad.\n\nLike many people, I expected the Prince of Darkness, but instead discovered the mild-mannered, professorial man who gave the nation Nightmares.\n\nDuring Wes’s formative years, he received the smallest beginnings of his filmic education from family friend Eddie Bilton who had an 8mm camera and taught Wes some of the basics of shooting and editing while he stayed at the Bilton home while his mother was at work. When I was about the age Wes was experiencing all this, both my parents worked full time, and my brother and I stayed with a family that lived a short drive away. We spent our weekdays there before and after school and then all day during a summer or two. This family was quite different from my own in many ways, but I also received the beginnings of my own education in film. They had cable, we did not, so I was exposed to several movies I otherwise didn’t have access to, including my first Wes Craven movie—Swamp Thing (1982), which received the stamp of approval because it was PG rated.\n\nIt was the perfect entrée into Craven’s work for a kid of my age and disposition. It is more of a superhero movie but with just enough creature elements to be considered a gateway horror film. Later I would learn about the misery involved in the making of this film. It was supposed to be a launching pad to greater things for the director. If it had been a hit, it could have even led to Craven writing and directing a Batman film, but its failure made it almost impossible to get hired for anything. Instead, he focused on his script about a dream demon, shopping it to studio after studio where it was endlessly rejected until Bob Shaye and New Line Cinema took a chance—and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nSoon after discovering Cooper’s book (I bought a copy of my own that I still have on my shelf) I found my way to Fangoria and its companion magazine GoreZone. The first issues I bought featured articles on movies like Friday the 13th VII-The New Blood, Phantasm II, the new Nightmare on Elm Street movie (part 5-The Dream Child), and something new and interesting. It was called Shocker (1989), and once again my friends dubbed it “the scariest movie ever made,” though none had seen it. But to my mind it had to be worthy of such a label because there was his name again—Wes Craven.\n\nIt was during these years that several important things happened in my own life as a horror obsessive. First, I discovered Stephen King and was allowed to watch the film adaptations of the books I read. We even rented Carrie and The Shining at Christmas and watched them as a family. That same Christmas I also saw A Nightmare on Elm Street for the first time. My uncle was a huge horror fan, and I begged my mom to let me buy him Nightmare as a Christmas present. At the family gathering on Christmas Day someone suggested that we watch a movie. I had gotten 4 or 5 from my grandma that were mentioned but I jokingly suggested we watch Nightmare. To my shock, everyone agreed. Though I had read the novelizations (again by Jeffrey Cooper) and knew what would be happening in the movie, it did not disappoint. To this day it is my favorite horror movie. Eventually I bought my own copy which played on rotation with The Exorcist, The Omen, Halloween, and Friday the 13th until I practically wore them all out.\n\nAfter watching Elm Street on Christmas, my parents pretty much surrendered and let my brother and I watch whatever we wanted. Again, I asked my friends to tell me what the really scary ones were. I remember one saying the scariest movie he knew of was The Serpent and the Rainbow (1988) while his older brother made it clear that the scariest, most intense, and gory movie ever made was called The Last House on the Left. I knew I saw Serpent sometime in my high school or college years but Last House, along with its companion film The Hills Have Eyes (1977), by reputation alone kept me away for a long time. I finally saw both in my mid-twenties while my exposure to the extreme side of cinema was still very limited. I was so nervous about Last House that I chose to watch the DVD special features first and found Craven’s interviews comforting somehow. He was able to articulate the message that he intended behind all the violence and depravity, one of the ugliness of violence which he believed had been fetishized in movies for too long. The Hills Have Eyes only underscored the themes of Last House but in a much more cinematically refined way.\n\nWhen Craven changed the face of horror for the third time, I had just graduated from high school and found myself estranged from the horror genre. I had become deeply involved in my church during that time and had been convinced by some that horror and faith did not mix. So unfortunately, I missed Scream in the theater. A few months later something interesting happened. The bass player in the worship band and I had a conversation about the faith-affirming aspects of horror, specifically in the film The Exorcist. Soon after, another friend, also a believer, encouraged me to embrace my love of horror, showing me anew the value of the films I’d loved for so long. I caught up with several films I missed, including Scream. I remember taking my college girlfriend to see Scream 2 (1997) in the theater; I’m not sure she’s ever forgiven me for that, but I loved it.\n\nIn the final year of my music education program in college, everyone in the program received some promotional materials for a movie that championed the value of music in schools called Music of the Heart (1999). Most noticed the stars—Meryl Streep, Gloria Estefan—I saw the director’s name and my jaw hit the floor. Once again Wes Craven had found his way into my life, and he had made a movie I could watch and enjoy with my mom. Music of the Heart didn’t have a huge effect on me or the box office upon its release, but when I returned to teaching music after ten years in another field, I discovered a beautiful film about the value of my work that is in my opinion the most accurate depiction of a music teacher ever captured on film.\n\nAfter a very dark time in my life, it was horror and Craven that helped bring me back to reality, ironically through his profound ability to depict worlds of fantasy, dreams, and hallucination. During the pandemic, I watched through his entire filmography in order, including television episodes and movies, and found great solace in that experience during a very challenging time. Though I have read and written about him and his movies extensively over the past few years, I still find things about Wes Craven that surprise me. A few years ago, while researching a piece on the role of religion in his films, I discovered his alter ego Abe Snake and the adult film he made under that pseudonym The Fireworks Woman (1974). Recently, in reading Joseph Maddrey’s excellent book The Soul of Wes Craven, I discovered his wild streak and impish sense of humor as when he tried to jump a wide ditch in a station wagon carrying his young family and how he would make prank calls to friends using disguised voices, sometimes getting those friends in serious trouble.\n\nBut the more I discover, the more questions come to mind that I wish I could ask him. I’d love to hear his thoughts on Buñuel, Bergman, Fellini, and even his contemporary David Lynch and ask what kind of influence their films had on his work. I want to bring up some examples of the religious themes, symbols, and iconography that crop up throughout his filmography and discuss if those were conscious or unconscious inclusions. But then maybe he would just think I’m full of shit—I’d be okay with that. I’d ask him to elaborate on him and Sam Raimi hiding Easter Eggs from each other’s movies in their own. I’d ask why he thinks people are continually drawn to his films and re-evaluating many of those that were overlooked in the past.\n\nI have my own opinion about that last point and again it has been crystalized by reading The Soul of Wes Craven. It all comes down to stories. Craven was interested in a great many things, often the political, socio-economic, religious, and familial undercurrents that constantly flow beneath societal ills. He constantly dealt with these elements in his films—Last House and Hills deal with the myths of American Exceptionalism and Manifest Destiny in light of the Vietnam War and its aftermath, Nightmare with the ways the older generation passes its problems on to the next, The People Under the Stairs (1991) with economic inequality, race, and gentrification, and so forth. You can watch his films and mine them for the rich themes that underly all of them. Or you can simply enjoy them as good scary movies with engaging stories. In his college years Craven learned the value of metaphor in literature and storytelling and this is very apparent in his best films.\n\nWes would have been 85 this August 2nd. Even if he had not made any more movies in the past nine years, I would think that he would be gratified to see the reappraisal of some of the films that were not appreciated in their day. As time goes by, films like New Nightmare (1994) and Scream 4 (2011) have been reevaluated as among the best metanarrative horror films ever made, some preferring New Nightmare to the original and others naming Scream 4 as their favorite sequel in the franchise. Calls to #ReleasetheCravenCut of Cursed (2005) would likely amuse and gratify him greatly considering the studio interference and other difficulties he encountered in the making of that film. He may have found a sense of pride in the small, but growing, cult around his very personal penultimate film My Soul to Take (2010).\n\nBut these are only speculations. The man may no longer be with us, but his work still speaks to us and has the power to entertain, provoke, and maybe even change us for the better. His legacy as an artist speaks to our souls but so does his legacy as a human being. Like any man, he was imperfect, but he was also a man who sought to learn and grow and improve. Both the creative and human aspects of Wes Craven have been a great source of inspiration for me over the years. And I’m sure I’m not alone.\n\nBemoaning how Hollywood treats its franchises these days is quite the cliche. So much so that it’s become a favorite pastime for movie geeks all over the world. It’s even more “basic” to spill ink about the nostalgia treadmill that no studio exec can resist jumping on with a glee usually reserved for kids in candy stores. Specifically, they seem to have an aversion towards moving forward and sowing new ideas on grounds fans deem oh-so sacred. And yet, here we are on the precipice of yet another vaunted horror franchise reaching into the past to chart its creative future.\n\nNeve Campbell’s recent comments about Scream’s seventh installment compared it to Halloween’s 2018 recipe. The irony is David Gordon Green’s film owes a debt to Halloween H2O. To say nothing of Scream 4, which already riffed on the idea of an older Sidney Prescott facing off with not only another deranged teenager in a Ghostface mask but also her survivor’s guilt and complicated feelings about her hometown. Notice a theme?\n\nHorror is overflowing with original ideas and stories; this isn’t about the genre. But there’s something to say about the fact legacy films can’t quit examining, well, their legacies. A longing for the “good old” days and fears of upsetting even moderately vocal fanbases created a cul-de-sac for franchise horror with no way out in sight.\n\nBefore going any further, this isn’t some new creatively bankrupt phenomenon. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Halloween famously tried that whole evolution thing in the 1980s. While connoisseurs appreciate those deviations now, those wild swings didn’t generate the necessary box office or fan response at the time. The Halloween franchise felt the sting so hard that they ensured everyone knew the fourth installment featured Michael Myers. Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers was comfort food for those who found Halloween III: Season of the Witch a little hard to digest. But only to a point. While Halloween 4 looked like a series going back to basics for most of its runtime, it did something very different in its final minutes that telegraphed a unique direction going forward. And yet, that moment gets explained away and rendered moot by the time Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers arrives one year later.\n\nThe creative urge for something new constantly clashes with the business need for something that prints money. The dollars and cents worshipers at the top of the industry often believe that taking the most minor creative risks makes the most sense because it leads to more dollars.\n\nThat’s why Nancy and her dad couldn’t escape Elm St. Or why Michael rarely stopped chasing his relatives. Or even the improbability that the Brody’s couldn’t escape Great White Sharks even while vacationing in the Bahamas. As the calendar turned and fandoms grew more significant, the demand for that type of thing only got louder. To quote one of the great fictional philosophers of our imaginary time, Philip J. Fry, “Clever things make people feel stupid and unexpected things make them feel scared!” Futurama’s insight is a bit harsh, but there’s still some truth buried in the satire.\n\nIn some cases, shifting to tried and true formulas is somewhat understandable. While they’re tacit admissions that sometimes the best idea is the first one, they’re also, at times, necessary business decisions. John Carpenter never envisioned Halloween as more than one movie. The same goes for Wes Craven and A Nightmare on Elm Street. Dollars to donuts, that’s probably the same story for most films that morph into the two words familiar to most people reading this website: intellectual property. That distinction comes with responsibilities to shareholders and CEOs and, no pun intended, the lifeblood of some companies. Ghostface is no longer just a person in a Spirit Halloween robe and a cheap dime store mask; Scream’s chief killer is a brand.\n\nWhat was once taboo is now a t-shirt at almost any department store. There are Ghostface Funko Pops, ceramic mugs, backpacks, and even a hockey jersey for the little ones. Let’s keep it real: Scream and other franchises of its ilk have more in common today with McDonald’s or Burger King than the original horror flicks studios produce. That’s not an inherently bad thing, but it is a thing; viewing these properties through that prism makes the math add up. That’s why Jamie Lee Curtis found herself at the center of not one, but two Halloween “reboots” twenty years apart from one another. The movies about the psycho wearing the William Shatner mask established their formula in ’78, so no matter what, they always revert to something from that time period. Even the proposed Halloween TV series is a “creative reset” returning to… ’78.\n\nStaying trapped in the familiar is on the con side of the ledger when horror becomes more significant than just a simple movie. Easily discernible why? Sure. But can it also mean preaching to the same choir from one installment to the next? Also yeah.\n\nFede Alvarez embraced yesteryear with Alien: Romulus, but he believes he did so without alienating (pun very much intended) a new audience. “You never want an audience to go see a movie and furrow their brow thinking, ‘Who is this person?’ Why is half the cinema so excited about this man and I don’t know who he is?” said Alvarez in a recent interview. “It becomes an excess I’m not interested in.”\n\nHow one feels about the excesses of which he showed great interest in Romulus aside, his overall point rings true. Rooting franchises in their glory days means not making them relevant for today. Everyone involved becomes so focused on paying homage to the past or dealing with older characters that they don’t justify the present or chart a future. That’s precisely where Scream finds itself right now. There’s a lot to how the seventh entry arrived at this point. So much so that there isn’t enough ink to cover it all here. What matters now is the beloved series moving away from a story that attracted old fans and created new ones in favor of playing the hits. Given the circumstances, the creative team behind the next Scream didn’t simply break glass in case of emergency so much as they shattered it by throwing a 100 mph fastball in the form of the Sidney Prescott solution.\n\nFor several reasons, some that look incredibly cynical, Scream can’t escape the vicious cycle even though it charted new waters.\n\nWe had a new core cast. The Grim Reaper finally collected on Dewey Riley’s long-term debt. Sidney was out of the picture, and who knows how many more attempts on her life Gale Weathers could weather. Scream and Scream VI reflected on their legacy without bathing in it. The movies looked fresh through the eyes of new characters rather than being slavish to Generation X and Millennials. Scream 4’s original ending almost pulled off this same high-wire act in 2011 until it didn’t. Some people behind the scenes got cold feet in the 9th inning for whatever reason. Writer Kevin Williamson’s bold move went bye-bye in favor of the status quo. Almost 15 years later, the Scream franchise still suffers from chili digits. Sadly, it’s not the only one.\n\nFor a genre built on punk rock sensibilities, there’s far too much conformity and timidness at the top of the food chain. Cul-de-sacs keep us in comfortable places by design, but horror isn’t about comfort. It never was. The second these prominent properties remember that is the reason Target happily sells t-shirts to children with masked killers etched on the front, we might finally get off this road to nowhere."
