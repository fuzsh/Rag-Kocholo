        "text": "Office S&M Features Pink Tiles to the Beacon House Extension\n\nAmy Duong — August 9, 2024 — Art & Design\n\nDesign firm Office S&M completes a London house extension project that adds new components to the Beacon House. The renovation process features a ceramic facade that is complete with the same pink glaze that is used at the Tube station tiles on the Hammersmith and City Line. The single-story extension is at the rear of the home located in North London's Tottenham area.\n\nThe co-founder of Office S&M Catrina Stewart along with Hugh McEwen speak about the design project, explaining \"Alex and Ella showed us examples of public buildings they grew up with and ones they visited on their travels, which included sun-bleached climbing frames, tiled swimming pools, leisure centres and stations. Just like with these buildings, they wanted their home to be both robust and joyful.\"\n\nImage Credit: French + Tye\n\nTrend Themes\n\n1.
