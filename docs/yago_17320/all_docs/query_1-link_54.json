        "text": "The author of a new book about the Jane Bashara slaying says Bob Bashara demanded conditions for his cooperation, and that the book delves into the S&M community in Detroit.\n\n‘The Sadist, the Hitman and the Murder of Jane Bashara,’ a paperback by Detroit News reporter George Hunter and his wife, freelancer Lynn Rosenthal, was released earlier this month by McFarland Books.\n\nHunter, in an interview on clickondetroit.com, says he and Rosenthal contacted Bashara for his possible participation. Bashara complained about unfair media coverage and demanded that the authors provide him with copies of all the news stories about the case and to send money ‘to a preacher,’ Hunter says in the video interview. They refused his conditions.\n\n‘He was still trying to be Master Bob and control things,’ Hunter says.\n\nHunter says he believes the media may have been over the top in covering the case but treated him fairly.\n\n‘You don’t need to skew the truth to make Bob look bad,’ Hunter says. ‘Bob did that all by himself, with things that came out in the trial.’\n\nBashara, now 60, was convicted of first-degree murder for the January 2012 slaying of his long-time wife, Jane, 56, a Mount Clemens native, in the garage of the couple’s Grosse Pointe home. The conviction followed a long series of proceedings in Wayne County Circuit Court in Detroit. He is serving life in prison without parole.\n\nBashara threatened and paid Joseph Gentz, now 54, formerly of St. Clair Shores, to beat and strangle Jane on the evening of Jan. 24, 2012. Her body was found the next morning in her Mercedes SUV parked in an alley on Detroit’s east side. Gentz pleaded to second-degree murder and is serving 17 years in prison.\n\nBashara had her killed so he could continue an affair and activities in the BDSM (bondage, domination, sadomasochism) community. Hunter says the book delves deeply into that community in metro-Detroit. The authors talked to people who attended S&M parties with him and visited his ‘sex dungeon’ under a Grosse Pointe bar.\n\n‘That (S&M) was a big part of this case,’ he says. ‘It’s not just being salacious by bringing it in. It was central to the reason why Jane was murdered.’\n\nSome of those involved in S&M were hesitant about talking and worried about the image of the community.\n\n‘They were concerned that a lot of this was going to reflect on them,’ he says. ‘That’s not the case at all.’\n\nThe community contains all types of people, he says, adding, ‘There’ just normal folks who are expressing that lifestyle.’\n\nHunter says he didn’t find a motive for Bashara that was different from the one prosecutors presented at trial — ‘greed and selfishness,’ he said.\n\nIn the years before the murder, Bashara maintained an image of a businessman but in fact earned little money. He says Bashara was known as, ”Big Bob’ who tooled around Grosse Pointe in the Navigator with a license plate, ‘Big Bob.’ He had this coffee mug, ‘You’re the man, Bob.’ That was his image, but Jane had all the money. He was broke.’\n\n‘This image of an entrepreneur, wheeler-dealer was all false.’\n\nBashara had a good life but wanted more, he says.\n\n‘His goal was to set himself up in this house as ‘Master Bob’ with concubines, this harem of slave girls serving him. But how is he going to do that if he doesn’t have any money?’\n\nBob Bashara wanted the $800,000 in his wife’s 401K plan she built up as a marketing executive in the energy industry.\n\nLost in the hoopla of the case was the quality of woman that was Jane Bashara, Hunter says.\n\n‘Nobody said a bad thing about Jane,’ he says. ‘She was a wonderful woman, from all accounts.’\n\nHunter, along with Melissa Preddy, also wrote the book, ‘Limb from Limb,’ about the slaying of Tara Grant, 34, by her husband, Stephen. Stephen Grant, now 48, was convicted of second-degree murder for killing Tara in their Washington Township home in 2007. He is serving a 50-year prison term.\n\nThis is at least the third book published about the case. ‘Master Betrayal: The Conspiracy to Kill Jane Bashara Paperback,’ by Andrew Morlan, was released in February 2017. ‘Murder in Grosse Pointe Park. Privilege, Adultery, and the Killing of Jane Bashara,’ by Steve Miller, was released in fall 2015 by Berkley Books.\n\nThe book can be purchased for $19.99 at mcfarlandbooks.com/product/the-sadist-the-hitman-and-the-murder-of-jane-bashara.\n\n— Jameson Cook, The Macomb Daily\n\nSTEPHEN GRANT CONVICTED\n\nAPPEALS COURT AFFIRMS BASHARA’S CONVICTION\n\nBASHARA’S FORMER SEX DUNGEON BURNS\n\nGENTZ HELPS SEAL BASHARA’S FATE"
