        "text": "\"The woman we woman we've just saw right?\" Brock nodded to Misty's question, as the girl could now imagine what kind of enemy she is.\n\n\"At first her team was powerful enough to make short work for us, even enough to get her claws on Pokémon easily, but when the time came and Team Galaxy managed to get the legendary Pokémon from the lake, time in which Gary supported us, Azelf, Mesprit and Uxie managed to make a move on her before being caught, getting her and her aircraft to sink down in the lake and later came a explosion... that day J was considered dead\" ... this confused the girl completely.\n\n\"Hold on a minute!, If what you say it's true then that woman shouldn't even be alive by now!\"\n\n\"Yeah... but it seems we were wrong\" Brock said now with a bit of dread, as he had his fists clenched in frustration, knowing that now the situation wasn't one to be happy about... even Misty could agree... how in the world a feared huntress came back to life after death?... that was a mystery.\n\nBut as the two were flying towards the Paradise, now they noticed something coming their way.\n\n\"Hey... isn't that-?\" Misty said while noticing the silhouette, both Staraptor and Noivern stopping mid air as the silhouette also stopped in front of them... a certain Flygon with a certain friend of them, who had a shocked expression in his face.\n\n\"Gary, What are you doing here?!\" Misty asked now in complete doubt, as the now mentioned was now mentioned.\n\n\"That's my question to make! Shouldn't you be at Cerulean City working as Gym Leader right now?! And what about you Brock?!\" Gary asked in clear curiosity, as he didn't expect his native friends here in Alola.\n\n\"I was!... but the moment Delia called us about Ash's condition we came ASAP here!... only to be assaulted by a presumably dead huntress that wants me now!\" Misty explained with a bit of a loud tone, as Gary caught the last part.\n\n\"Wait, presumptively dead huntress? What are you talking about!?\"\n\n\"I have a similar doubt Gary, but for now it's best if we get somewhere safe, because we have an injured girl with us\" Brock said now getting the attention of Gary, as then Misty pointed at the girl besides her... Gary getting shocked of who she was.\n\n'Iris?!... [tick mark] Alder must've sent her to investigate Ashy-boy after their talk. Not to say that I'm still curious of how in the hell Ashy-boy has contacts with the regional champs!' Gary thought with a bit of frustration as he still had that great question for our trainer... but he decided to shrugged it off for now.\n\n\"Tch! you can go back to Aether Paradise and rest, I have to get Ashy-boy out of danger now!\" Gary said with a bit of frustration, as Flygon started to fly a bit slow towards where Ash went to.\n\n\"Wai- what do you mean!?\" but his words worried Misty, as she didn't have enough time to pay attention to Ash's condition, even if she had seen him back with J.\n\n\"The guy almost lost his life with a battle against an unknown Pokémon the Creation Trio calls 'Shatternus', not to say that he's already tired and maybe he could faint in any second, but no!! mr. Pokémon Master it's to selfless to even care to rest and came to save your butts of whatever attacked you, and now I have to bring him back before it's late, okay?\" Gary explained with a bit of stress in his words, as then he didn't asked anything else and flew towards our trainer, leaving now the two in great worry.\n\n'He had a fight before coming here?!! [Tick marks] That's it!!, once Gary gets him back I'm seriously going to hit him in the nogging so hard that he would be sorry of making us pass through this!!' Misty hmphed out in her mind, as Noivern and Staraptor sensed her anger, sweat dropping a bit as they just decided to continue their flight towards Aether Paradise, ignoring Brock's worry, as he could easily understand the condition of Ash, getting worried as he knew his friend was taking his body at a bit too stress, especially if he was already out of steam from that fight Gary talked about."
