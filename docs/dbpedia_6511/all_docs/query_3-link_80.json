        "text": "Tehran, July 3, IRNA - An earthquake measuring 4 on the Richter scale shook the town of Bileh Savar near Ardabil province in the northwest of Iran on Sunday.\n\nAccording to Geophysics Institute of Tehran University, the tremor occurred at 03:28:29 hours local time in an area located at 39.72 degrees longitude and 48.51 degrees latitude.\n\nThe earthquake happened at a depth of 9 km.\n\nThere is no report on any damage caused by the earthquake.\n\nIran sits astride several major faults in the earth's crust, and is prone to frequent earthquakes, many of which have been devastating.\n\nThe worst in recent times hit Bam in Kerman province in December 2003, killing 31,000 people - about a quarter of its population - and destroying the city's ancient mud-built citadel.\n\nThe deadliest quake in the country was in June 1990 and measured 7.7 on the Richter scale. About 37,000 people were killed and more than 100,000 injured in the northwestern provinces of Gilan and Zanjan. It caused major damage to 27 towns and about 1,870 villages.\n\nIn August 2012, two quakes in Northwestern Iran also claimed the lives of 306 people and injured more than 4,500 others.\n\n9376**1771"
