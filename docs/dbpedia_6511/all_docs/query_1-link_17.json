        "text": "AA research on standardization of method of packaging to extend shelf life of Jasminum sambac CV. Gundumalli was conducted in College of Agriculture, Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology, Bhubaneswar during 2015- 16.The experiment was laid out in FCRD with two factors in three replications, with 16treatment combinations..Observations were recorded on the visual quality in terms of freshness index, flowers opening index, colour retention index, and shelf life of flowers and the physiological parameters associated with the postharvest quality of flowers, namely, moisture content, relative water content, physiological loss in weight. The flowers treated with 4% boric acid, packed in 60 micron polyethylene bags without ventilation and stored under70C significantly extend the shelf life to 168.33 hours with highest freshness index (87.74%), maximum colour retention index of (93.75 %), and lowest flower opening index (11.25%), highest moisture content of (76.20%) andlowest physiological weight loss percent (0.48%)48 hours after packing Original Research Article Packaging Technology for Extending Shelf Life of Jasmine (Jasminum sambac CV. Gundumalli) Flowers\n\nThe cut flowers are living organs, with intense metabolic activity, subjected to a rapid aging process compared to the undetached flowers from the mother plant. Improving the life of cut flowers is one of the most important factors for customer satisfaction. The effect of silver thiosulphate (STS) and commercial mixtures was studied in carnation cut flowers and kept in randomized vases according to experimental factors. Three commercial mixtures were used (Chrysal, Flower Food, FleurÌ› Rose) and for thiosulphate four levels (0 or control, 0.03, 0.06 and 0.9 mM). The interaction of the two factors studied was insignificant for most traits, including wilting percentage and vase lifespan, which may involve the application of both substances alone is sufficient to improve post-harvest quality and is not necessary to use simultaneously in the preservative solution. The results also showed that following the interaction of the two factors, treatment with 0.06 mM silver thiosulphate can be ..."
