        "text": "The study examines the privatization process and change in growth of privatized firms during different forms of government. Pakistan has been experiencing unusual and divergent political scenarios. Sometimes so-called political system starts running the affairs of country and most of times military rulers have been in power. The study analyses the privatization and efficiency of firms during the era of 1990 to 2007. The time span from 1990 to 1998 is considered one era that is the era of democratic rulers and from 2000 to 2007 second era where there was military rule. Under this scenario, seven variables like profitability, efficiency, employment, leverage, capital investment, operating efficiency and output are taken for analysis. Wilcoxan rank test is used to compare the two eras. All the variables showed significant relationship using z-stat. Overall ten firms are analyzed in the study. All the firms are privatized through IPO.\n\nThis study is aimed at finding the impact of organizational environment, job satisfaction of employees and career growth opportunities upon the employee’s intent to leave the organization in the public sector of Pakistan. We have used standardized scales to collect data from a random sample of 100 employees of different public sector organizations of Pakistan. Inferential statistical tests were conducted to analyze the data for exploration of the extent of relevance among the variables taken into the consideration in this study. The results of this study indicate significant negative correlations among three independent variables and turnover intentions. The study contributes for understanding of the factors other than compensation on the employee’s decision of retention with current employer in a developing country like Pakistan\n\nAbstract This study was planned to examine the before and after micro credit effect provided by Khushhali bank limited on economic condition of the entrepreneurs in Peshawar city by employing paired t-test. Both primary and secondary data was used. Primary data was collected through a questionnaire in three union councils out of ninety two union councils namely Gung, Dari Baghban and Karim Pura. Overall average monthly income of the educated entrepreneurs was improved from Rs.10553 to 14457 with 37 percent positive change (t-value 23.03 with significant value 0.000) while income of the uneducated entrepreneurs augmented from Rs.10660 to Rs.11970 with 12.4 percent increased (t-value 23.16 with significant value 0.000). . Hence, income of the educated entrepreneurs was three times more from uneducated entrepreneurs in the study area. All of the t-value for income is highly significant. The saving of educated borrowers was increased from 1793 to 2878 with 61 percent positive change (t-value 21.31 with significant value 0.000). The saving of uneducated entrepreneurs was improved from Rs.1447 to Rs.1887 with 31 percent positive change (t-value 20.57 with significant value 0.000). The major reason of educated borrowers more income and saving were that they utilized micro credit properly. Therefore, it is supposed that educated entrepreneurs utilized micro credit more effectively than uneducated entrepreneurs. All of the t-value for saving is highly significant. Hence, micro credit had a strong positive effect on the economic condition of the entrepreneurs in the study area."
