        "text": "Steppe is among the most endangered biomes of the world, especially in Eastern Europe, where more than 90 % of original steppes have been destroyed due to conversion into croplands, afforestation and other human activities. Currently, steppe vegetation is often restricted to places unsuitable for ploughing, such as ancient burial mounds called kurgans. The aim of our study was to collect and synthesise existing knowledge on kurgans by a review of research papers and grey literature. The proportion of kurgans covered by steppe vegetation increases from west to east and from lowlands to uplands. Despite their small size, kurgans act as biodiversity hotspots and harbour many red-listed species. High overall species richness and a high proportion of grassland specialists are maintained by a pronounced fine-scale environmental heterogeneity. The main\n\nVast agricultural fields, kurgans (ancient burial mounds) and protective forest belts are very charac-teristic, anthropogenic components of the Ukrainian landscape. Windbreaks were planted widely in the 1950s and 60s. Kurgans were built from the Neolithic period to the Middle Ages. Their original number in Ukraine is estimated at 500,000. Today, however only 50,000-100,000 of these barrows remain. Polish-Ukrainian research of the flora of barrows has been conducted since 2004 through the project &quot;The kurgans as refugia of steppe flora and micro-centers of biodiversity in the anthro-pogenic landscape&quot;. The study involved 106 selected mounds from among nearly 450 visited. They were located in the forest steppe zone and three steppe zones (southern Ukraine). The study demon-strated that about 25% of Ukraine&#39;s barrows had a valuable flora (more than 700 species, including 69 red listed species). It was also found that the flora of these kurgans reflected the climate vegeta...\n\nWe introduce recently discovered large kurgans of the Saka period in the Suusamyr valley, northern Kyrgyzstan. There are two cemeteries with large mounds, each of which is surrounded by ditches, stone enclosures, and ramparts. Apparently, each kurgan and the constructions around it form a whole burial complex. The kurgans are rounded in plan view, 30-73 m in diameter. Some were possibly square in plan view. West of them, there is a line of enclosures, most of which consist of eight boulders. In terms of nature and form of the constructions around kurgans, the burial complexes fall into six types, each of which is described in detail. Parallels are found among Early Iron Age cemeteries in the Tian Shan, Semirechye, central and eastern Kazakhstan. Common and distinctive features of the Suusamyr group are listed. On the basis of the comparative analysis, the group dates to 800/700-200 BC. We conclude that the kurgans were destined for the Saka elite, and were constructed over several generations. The materials of the study allow us to state that the alpine Suusamyr valley, which is hard to access, was a key political and/or cult center of the Tian Shan in the Saka period.\n\nRecent studies on the Kurgans of Turkic Period in Central Asia have revealed new remarkable results. On the other hand, still much more excavations and research are needed to reach outstanding findings and knowledge. In short, the kurgans of Turkic Period at Eastern Kazakhstan have examined in two groups: “Berel type” kurgans (Samashev, 2011: 103-114) and the Kurgans with beard or mustache (Aitkali, 2021a: 38-45). In comparison, the kurgans of Turkic period at Eleke Sazy can be defined as “Berel type” because of the similarities in architectural features, findings, and funeral rites. In addition to that the kurgans of Turkic period at Eleke Sazy, reflect the main characteristics of Turkic period from the aspects of burial customs including architectural features, material culture, practice of horse burial and the orientation of bodies. For instance, the kurgans of Turkic period at Eleke Sazy have many similarities with the kurgans of Turkic period kurgans at Berel burial ground. Like as Berel Kurgans, having burials between Iron Age to Medieval Age, the kurgans of Eleke Sazy also prove that “cultural continuity” have been evident in funeral rites from Iron Age to Medieval Periods (Kutlu & Kutlu, 2021: 772-798). In last three years, eight kurgans of Turkic period at Eleke Sazy are excavated but most of them are robbed completely and the archaeological findings are very limited to make comprehensive statements. We hope to uncover much more findings from the excavations of the coming years at Eleke Sazy Valley. I have special thanks to Prof. Zainolla Samashev, Leila Kutlu and the Team of East Kazakhstan Archaeological Expedition.\n\nTumuli (Kurgans) over Bronze Age, Early Iron Age, and Middle Age burials are a common attribute of the landscape across the entire steppe zone of Eurasia. For many years, the kurgan embankment was believed to be created from loose soil and underlying sediments. However, in recent years, during the excavation of kurgans, archaeologists began to understand that the mounds contain large blocks of undisturbed soil. These blocks are a type of brick, carved from the upper sodded layer of soil held together in blocks by plant roots. We suggest the term “sod blocks” for such soil blocks. The earliest kurgan mounds made from sod blocks date to the Early Bronze Age. Sod blocks are found in burials from the Middle Bronze Age, but after that, the tradition of sod brick architecture begins to fade. During the Scythian era, from the 7th to 4th centuries BC, sod blocks are widely used for making huge “King's” kurgans. During the Early Sarmatian culture, in the 3rd to 1st centuries BC, the sod blocks technique disappears, arising again in the Middle Sarmatian of the 1st century AD. We found that sod blocks are well distinguished in tumuli if the kurgan is built from Solonetz, a soil with a light grey upper AE horizon and a reddish-brown underlying Bt horizon. Due to sharp differences between the upper two soil horizons, we can distinguish the sod blocks in kurgan mounds. The growing number of kurgans with traces of sod blocks in the mounds allows one to suppose that this method of kurgan construction was much more widely used than previously thought. Taking into consideration that most of the mounds have not been made from soilforming rock, but from the upper soil horizons, from which one can easily cut sod blocks, we assume that most of the kurgans were made from sod blocks. The use of sod blocks can significantly expand the range of possible architectural proposals for the creation of the kurgan mound and provide an opportunity for building vertical elements. The purpose of this article is to consider the emergence and development of this kurgan building tradition and to show the most interesting examples of burial mounds built from sod blocks. Another task is to establish, in terms of soil science, why in some burial mounds soil blocks are clearly visible but in other cases are not."
