In any exchange, information streams back and forth in numerous channels. This truism is worth recalling when the exchange in question is between scholars, where the temptation, reenforced by tradition, is to focus on the obvious intellectual content and ignore the rest. But no matter how strictly the writers seem to discuss only ‘objective’ matters, there is always a nonintellectual component present, and if the social and psychological context is available or can be reconstructed, then the biographer or historian finds much besides the issues discussed. In this exchange of letters between the Cambridge scholar, Sir James George Frazer (1854-1941) and Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff (1848-1931), the latter makes some keen observations about the limited value of the comparative method so far as classical studies are concerned. But beneath the text of these letters exists a personal ‘subtext’, which permits us to read the letters in a fresh or unexpected light.

2. No adequate biography exists. Two memoirs by R. Angus Downie, a journalist who became Frazer's amanuensis in the 1930's when he had gone blind, are: James George Frazer: the portrait of a scholar (London 1940)Google Scholar and Frazer and the Golden bough (London 1970)Google Scholar. Of importance is Marett, R.R., ‘James George Frazer 1854-1941’, PBA 27 (1941) 377–91Google Scholar. Besterman, Theodore, A bibliography of Sir James George Frazer O.M. (London 1934)Google Scholar is invaluable. See also Ackerman, R., ‘J.G. Frazer revisited’, The American Scholar 47 (1978) 232–6Google Scholar.

5. Frazer was a lifetime Fellow of Trinity College and never held a university teaching post at Cambridge. He did hold the chair of social anthropology at Liverpool for only one year (1907-08), but never lectured there. His shyness is attested by Jane Harrison (letter to Lady Mary Murray, February 1901) apud Stewart, Jessie, Jane Ellen Harrison: A portrait from letters (London 1959) 37Google Scholar and Malinowski, Bronislaw, ‘Sir James George Frazer: A biographical appreciation’, A scientific theory of culture and other essays (Chapel Hill 1944) 181–2Google Scholar.

6. For a representative modern assessment of Frazer by a leading anthropologist see Evans-Pritchard, E.E., Theories of primitive religion (Oxford 1965) 27ffGoogle Scholar. Frazer has probably had more lasting effects on literary criticism than on anthropology: see Hyman, S.E., The tangled bank (New York 1962)Google Scholar and Ackerman, R., ‘Mythbegotten’, Denver Quarterly 8 (1974) 91–9Google Scholar.

20. Despite Frazer's protestations of his debt to German learning, it is difficult to specify its dimensions above and beyond the obvious fact that anyone trained in classical philology, as was Frazer (second classic, tripos 1878), was necessarily conversant with both general and specific developments in German scholarship. Certainly at the end of the century anthropology was an English, not a German, science. The cause for Frazer's move from classics to anthropology was the advent of and his friendship with William Robertson Smith at Trinity College in 1884. (R.A.)

23. Frazer wrote to Dr Solomon Schechter on 22 December 1902: ‘We heard lectures by Pfliederer, Paulsen, Diels, and Wilamowitz, and we were introduced to all these eminent men’: see GRBS loc. cit. In winter semester 1902/3 Wilamowitz offered Ausgewählte hellenistische Gedichte and Antike Lyrik, a meeting of either or both of which Frazer would have attended.
