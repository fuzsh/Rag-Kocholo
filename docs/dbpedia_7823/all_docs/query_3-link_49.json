        "text": "Page 211 →Appendix 1 Whither the Ionian League?\n\nPerhaps the single most intractable challenge to understanding Ionia in the Archaic and Classical periods is the nature of the Ionian koinon, usually referred to as the Ionian League. The early history of the koinon is almost entirely speculative and inferred from later sources.743 Meetings took place at the Panionion on the Mycale Peninsula, which housed the sanctuary of Poseidon Heliconius (Hdt. 1.148).744 The sanctuary was established on the site of Melie, which was either an Ionian or Carian community against which the Ionians waged a common war (Vitr. De arch. 4.1.3–5).745\n\nPage 212 →The two traditional lines of scholarship about the organization represent a chicken-and-egg problem. One treats the Ionian League anachronistically by envisioning it as a political organization along the lines of Hellenistic federal leagues that served to resolve debates and organize collective action against encroachment from foreign powers. Despite the irrepressible myth of the Ionian Migration, Ionian identity developed in situ in Anatolia.746 Although Wilamowitz-Moellendorff followed Vitruvius in seeing the original purpose of the league being a common war against Melie, the more commonly accepted position on this side of the ledger is the one proposed by M. O. B. Caspari, which suggests that the league formed for common defense against Lydian aggression.747 However, since they established the sanctuary on the site of Melie and held the common festival there as a commemoration of victory, the festival had to have followed from some sense of unity.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, some scholars hold that the league began as a religious network that had little or no political activity.748 While some adherents of this theory, such as Naoíse Mac Sweeney, suggest that the koinon bound its members only to a loose sense of communal identity,749 others, including Barbara Kowalzig and Nicholas Cross, have recently revived the argument that the Panionion laid the groundwork for a common Ionian identity and therefore that the koinon of the Ionians took on an incipiently political function by the end of the Archaic period.750\n\nPage 213 →Indeed, the textual evidence for the early Ionian League appears to support the second interpretation. Herodotus records at least four assemblies of the Ionian koinon that took place between c.550 and 494 (1.141.4, 1.170, 5.108, 6.7). Each meeting had a distinctly political flavor. In c.550, they met to discuss their options for collective action. Several years later, they met for a second meeting in which Bias of Priene, one of the legendary sages of ancient Greece, proposed that the Ionians sail away to form a common city in Sardo (perhaps Sardinia), while Thales, the Phoenician sage living in Miletus, proposed that the Ionians establish a single political seat (1.170, βουλευτήριον) located at Teos on the grounds that it was the center of the region.751 Although neither plan came to fruition, the Panionion remained an important locus for collective action such that leaders gathered there again decades later in order to coordinate the Ionian revolt. Thus, despite the “Ionian revolt” itself being a misnomer,752 scholars have nevertheless suggested that the revolt took place because of this developing sense of common identity.753\n\nProponents of a political Ionian league in the Archaic period explain the absence of political institutions in the Classical period by arguing that the Persians dissolved the organization in 492.754 After the “liberation” of Ionia, they continue, Athens had little interest in reviving a rival koinon to the new Athenian League. While this argument follows in part from the undeniable geopolitical reality of the relative positions of the Ionian poleis and the succession of hegemons, it is based in part on a circular logic: the koinon’s political function in the Archaic period is confirmed because imperial powers saw fit to suppress it, while the suppression in the Classical period was made necessary because of its political function.\n\nReexamining the textual evidence for the political function also introduces serious issues for this interpretation. First, as we have seen, pressure from the Page 214 →Delian League was anything but even. Not only did the Athenians tolerate regional hegemonies throughout their space, so too did its imperial institutions grow with time, and even in the mid-470s there is no evidence for a move to revive a political organization that was the Ionian League. Second, and even more telling, are the notable absences from the assemblies of the Ionian koinon. In c.550, Herodotus says, the Milesians did not attend because they had already agreed to a treaty with Cyrus (1.41.4). Likewise, in 499, the Ephesians appear to have stood apart from the revolt. The raid on Sardis employed Ephesian guides (5.100), but when the Persian counterattack caught up with the rebels in the Ephesian chora, the polis suffered no reprisals, and the Ephesians even attacked some of the survivors of the battle of Lade (6.16). In each of these cases the assembly of the Ionian koinon takes on a much more fluid composition, and thus it is more accurate to describe these meetings as taking place at the Panionion as a common space rather than being meetings of an inherently political Ionian League.\n\nHowever, common identity is not easily unmade. The scant evidence for the Panionia in the Classical period introduces additional complications for understanding both the Ionian League and the Ionians during this period.755 Thucydides introduces an annual pan-Ionian festival at Ephesus, comparing it to a common Ionian festival on Delos (3.104.3–4). Simon Hornblower correctly distinguished this Ephesia from the Artemisia but proceeded to identify this festival as the Panionia on the grounds that Diodorus Siculus claims that at some point the festival had moved there because of war in the vicinity of Mycale (15.49.1).756 P. J. Stylianou responded to Hornblower, vehemently rejecting this interpretation and more plausibly dating the change in location to around 400, during the period of the Spartan expeditions to Ionia based at Ephesus (see Chapter 5).757 He therefore connects this reference in Diodorus to a decision to move the festival back to Mycale in c.373.758 While Stylianou’s Page 215 →argument for the date and length of time of the Panionian festivities at Ephesus is sound, he regards it as a revival of the koinon,759 even though Diodorus indicated a transfer. This sort of error is not beyond Diodorus given his propensity to project his contemporary context into his history, but the positive evidence for the interpretation is lacking.\n\nThere is only one datable inscription that suggests a revival of the Ionian koinon around 400, the record of an arbitration between Myus and Miletus. In either 392 or 388, the Persian satrap, Struthas, ordered jurors of the Ionians (οἱ τῶν Ἰώνων δικασταὶ) to resolve this dispute, and the surviving fragments include lists of jurors from Erythrae, Chios, Clazomenae, Lebedus, and Ephesus (RO 16 = I.Priene 458; see Chapter 5). The specification of Ionian jurors has led scholars to argue that he delegated the arbitration to the Ionian koinon, but nothing in the text of the inscription supports this conclusion.760 Struthas likely used membership in the koinon to choose the arbitrators, but this followed Persian practice in the region going back to the sixth century (Hdt. 6.42).761\n\nOther evidence is no more illuminating. The remaining inscriptions are only tenuously dated to this period,762 and surviving ancient histories offer no evidence for collective action. However, the absence of evidence for the existence of the Panionion in this period need not be evidence of absence if the koinon remained as it had been for much of its existence: a loose organization with limited substance—that is, if it lacked a political function.\n\nThe dearth of solid evidence for the Ionia in this period frustratingly makes any hypothesis little more than speculation, but treating the Panionion as a loose, largely symbolic organization rather than one that fostered strong ties in the region offers intriguing possibilities. In discussing the temporary relocationPage 216 → of the Panionia to Ephesus, Diodorus says, “Nine cities in Ionia were accustomed to making a common assembly of all of the Ionians” (κατὰ τὴν Ἰωνίαν ἐννέα πόλεις εἰώθεισαν κοινὴν ποιεῖσθαι σύνοδον τὴν τῶν Πανιωνίων, 15.49.1). The confident declaration that nine poleis did this has caused no small amount of consternation on the grounds that twelve is the more common number associated with the sanctuary (e.g., Hdt. 1.145; Strabo 14.1.4). Scholars have offered various explanations for the discrepancy, whether as an error introduced by either Diodorus or his source (probably Ephorus) or looking for explanations for why some of the members would not have been included. The most common explanation is to strike Chios and Samos from the list on the grounds that they were formally independent of Persia and to suggest that Priene did not exist at the time of the transition, leaving nine poleis. Stylianou goes a step further, plausibly suggesting that the revival of the festival on Mycale corresponded with the refoundation of Priene with the support of Mausolus. However, while he is correct to suggest that Diodorus’ implication that the Panionion always had twelve members was an “injudicious epitome of Ephorus,” bringing Priene back into the picture for the restoration ticks the number back up to ten viable members outside of Chios and Samos. If Stylianou is right in identifying the return to Mycale as the result of Hecatomnid influence in the region, then Ephesus would be the more likely exclusion. This proposal is, admittedly, speculative, but it fits the geopolitical context of a showdown between Ephesus and Mausolus over their respective positions in the region in the late 370s and early 360s (see Chapter 6).\n\nThe relationship between the Ionians and Alexander in the 330s further supports the interpretation of a largely symbolic league. Much as Struthas and Agesilaus both treated the Ionian poleis individually rather than collectively, Alexander continued in the same vein.763 Further, while he made a procession at the Artemisium at Ephesus and contributed to the building of the Temple of Athena at Priene (see Chapter 7), he made no comparable offer to the common Ionian sanctuary at any point during his reign. Once again, the absence of evidence does not positively confirm the nonexistence of a political league, but the preponderance of evidence points to the koinon of the Ionians remaining a religious network that created a loose sense of common identity among disparate poleis.764\n\nPage 217 →The changed political landscape of the early Hellenistic period breathed new relevance into the old cultic network. The earliest evidence for this change comes from an inscription dated to 289/8 that reads (SIG3 368):\n\nResolved by the koinon of the Ionians. Whereas Hippostratos,\n\nson of Hippodamos of Miletus, a friend of King Lysimachus\n\nand strategos over the poleis of Ionia, continues to\n\ntreat the cities generously, both each individually and the Ionians\n\nas a whole, with good fortune, [he receives] from the koinon of the Ionians\n\npraise for Hippostratos son of Hippodamus on account of his virtue and eunoia\n\nthat he continues to have toward the koinon of the Ionians, and\n\na tax exemption among all of the Ionian poleis and that these provisions\n\napply to him and his descendants. And [it is resolved] to erect a bronze eikon\n\nof this man on horseback in the Panionion . . .\n\nἔδοξε Ἰώνων τῶι κοινῶι· ἐπειδὴ Ἱππόστρατος Ἱππο-\n\nδήμου Μιλήσιος φίλος ὤν τοῦ βασιλέως Λυσι-\n\nμάχου καὶ στρατηγὸς ἐπὶ τῶν πόλεων τῶν Ἰώνων\n\nκατασταθεὶς οἰκείως καὶ φιλανθρώπως καὶ ἰδίαι ἐ-\n\nκάστηι τῶμ πόλεων καὶ κοινῆι Ἴωσι χρωμενος δια-\n\nτελεῖ, ἀγαθῆι τύχηι, δεδὀχθαι τῶι κοινῶι τῶι Ἰώ-\n\nνων, ἐπαινέσαι Ἱππόσταρτον Ἱπποδἠμου ἀρε-\n\nτῆς ἕνεκε καὶ εὐνοἰας ἣν ἔχων διατελεῖ πρὸς\n\nτὸ κοινὸν τὸ Ἰώνων, καὶ εἶναι αὐτὸν ἀτελῆ πάντων ἐν <ταῖς>\n\nπόλεσι ταῖς Ἰώνων· τὰ αὐτὰ δὲ ὑπάρχειν Ἱπποστρά-\n\nτωι αὐτῶι καὶ ἐκγόνοις· στῆσαι δὲ αὐτοῦ καὶ εἰκόνα\n\nχαλκῆν ἐφ᾽ ἵππου ἐμ Πανιωνίωι·\n\nThe decree concludes with instructions that each city inscribe and publicize it, as well as for a copy to appear beside the equestrian statue in the Panionion. The extant copy from Miletus also included two additional decrees related to Hippostratos and his honors, both of which speak to the ratification in the Panionion.Page 218 → Unlike the earlier evidence for a political function at the koinon, this inscription suggests that decisions made at the Panionion, at least in the case of certain exceptional honors, were binding for league members."
