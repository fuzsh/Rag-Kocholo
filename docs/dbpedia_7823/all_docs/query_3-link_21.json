        "text": "Introduction\n\n1First of all, my paper is written for the Japanese general public rather than for an academic audience. At the same time, my agenda is not to present my interpretation of Plato. The basic goal of my lecture is to describe, from the perspective of intellectual history, how people have mobilized/misunderstood/criticized Plato on the basis of certain social/political interests.\n\nThe discovery of a new Plato and its consequences. From Nietzsche to Fascism\n\n5The consensus until the end of the 19th century was that Plato’s thinking and the Politeia did not have any specific real-political implications. His argument in Politeia was characterized above all as a utopian, fanciful vision. At the same time, Plato was discussed mainly with regard to his relationship to Christianity as well as to philosophical systems. The dominant image of the ‘philosopher Plato’ was illustrated indirectly by the fact that the Nomoi and the Seventh Letter, which seemed to describe his political standpoint, were often treated as spurious writings. Of course, in the history of political thought there are some criticisms of Plato’s political argument among liberal thinkers such as Benjamin Constant etc., but we cannot find any criticism as heated and systematic as that of Popper.\n\n6Since the second half of the 19th century, Western society has faced waves of industrialization and democratization, while feudal hierarchical society was gradually fading. The age of the masses arrived, with its strong flavor of materialism and egalitarianism. This trend stimulated the socialist movement on the one hand, but on the other hand it encouraged critical arguments against industrialization and democratization. While steady progress was expected and predicted among liberals and socialists, others warned strongly against the anarchic consequences of the pursuit of unlimited desire.\n\n7At the time, the ancient Greek classics were still considered as providing the elite with a paradigm of humanity, and the experience of democracy in ancient Greece and its arguments seemed to supply a good example of how to cope with the realities of the 19th and 20th century. In this sense, Greek thinkers became as it were contemporary figures, and the natural consequence of this was mutual influence extending beyond the past and the present. Did the image of Plato change or not ?\n\n12Among the ‘legitimate’ group, George’s circle produced a number of characteristic interpretations of Plato. They were deeply committed to aristocracy and romanticism. Their main interest lay in using biographical research to discover a ‘hero’ who embodied the ideal human being, and in pursuing/rebuilding the ideal of our life (Leben) in this world. While they despised professionalized, positivistic academic discipline (originating from Aristotle) because of its irrelevance to the reemergence of ideal life, they adopted Plato as their ‘hero’, who could provide a total understanding of our life. Plato was named ‘king of the spiritual kingdom (Reich)’. According to their understanding, Wilamowitz’s Plato was still dominated by the spirit of positivism, which should be overcome, and it was their obligation to disclose Plato as ‘a presenter and ruler of the spiritual kingdom’.\n\n15For Salin, Plato recognized the eternal principle, namely the idea of the good that penetrated the cosmos, the ‘spiritual kingdom’, and human beings in concentric circles. Naturally, therefore, Plato is not only a sage, but also a ruler of a ‘spiritual kingdom’ destined to organize every aspect of life. The main factor characterizing this kingdom is the harmony that results from the driving force of the holy center (the idea of the good). This community had a kind of caste system consisting of clergy, warrior and worker, but this caste system depended upon the difference of contribution to the community rather than upon birth. The ‘spiritual kingdom’ can be described as a community worshipping the idea of the good. Salin describes the Politeia as a political program for building the ‘spiritual kingdom’. The ‘spiritual kingdom’ appears at first in the form of voluntary association, but eventually political power will rise above it.\n\n19In the Nazi era it is quite easy to see that Plato was understood as a saviour of the Volk, and the Politeia was read as a text to legitimize racism. This meant a concord between Plato and Hitler. In particular, the education system of the leader group in the Politeia was often interpreted as a good symbol of ‘aristocracy of spirit, character, blood and race’. Racists such as Hans Friedrich Karl Guenther referred to Plato quite often in order to justify their own arguments. In this way, the concept of romantic community of George’s circle was replaced by cold-blooded racism under the Nazi regime. The furious discussions in the Journal of Education I referred to in the introduction resulted from this kind of understanding of Plato in Germany.\n\nCriticisms of Plato\n\n20Here I discuss three examples of famous criticism of Plato. It is characteristic that these criticisms were not carried out by specialists in Plato. They rely on more general intellectual interest in reconsidering the status of Plato in the whole context of Western tradition.\n\n22Fite affirms that Politeia should be understood not from the viewpoint of abstract philosophical interest, but from the standpoint of class interest as well as party interest, because Plato continued to be a friend of his distant relatives such as Critias and Charmides who played a key role in destroying Athenian democracy and in replacing it by oligarchy. According to Fite, Plato’s ultimate interest was to reestablish the rule of gentlemen in Athens, but he correctly recognized that it was impossible simply to reintroduce the old aristocracy. Thus, the basic idea of the Politeia was to establish a ‘new aristocracy based on scientific arguments’ and to create a new ruling class. In this sense, the Politeia was fundamentally an anti-democratic treatise, and Plato’s continuous criticisms of democracy and pro-Spartan stance illustrated his basic orientation.\n\n23Fite also pays attention to the concept of the rule of knowledge and of experts. Political art is considered as an art based on true knowledge, and the true politician should be sharply differentiated from the amateur politician. For Fite, the fundamental idea of the Politeia lies in the realization of true experts and their rule in society, which is eventually reduced to utilitarian efficiency. In the contemporary situation, Fite finds that the Soviet Union seems to follow this basic idea. He affirms that Lenin and Stalin belong among the great leaders of scientific rule. This means that Plato’s idea has only peripheral relevance, lacking all relevance to civilized societies such as ancient Athens. According to Fite, Plato’s ideal city consists only of children, so Plato’s idea was not very effective in relation to political realities. In fact Plato belongs among the peripheral, reactive political figures. In this way Fite has demoted Plato from a godlike status to a peripheral one.\n\n25Crossman’s image of Plato is not very much different from Fite’s, insofar as Plato was seen as a defender of aristocracy who tried to rebuild aristocracy on a new intellectual foundation. The new foundation was supplied by the philosophy of Socrates, for whom truth derives only from reason. By this new foundation, aristocracy was legitimized by an eternal and universal order. Plato sympathized with the Spartan constitution, but he clearly recognized it was necessary to provide a ‘civilized Sparta’ in order to be accepted by the masses. The philosopher king thesis was presented to make leaders more self-regulating, based on their own spiritual capability as well as on their knowledge. While class-politics was eradicated by the separation of political power and property, Plato appealed to propaganda or the ‘noble lie’ to rob the masses of their liberty. According to Plato, every man can be happy under the dictatorship of the true aristocracy and the rule of the best, so Crossman says. His Academy can be seen as the headquarters of an open conspiracy to establish aristocratic dictatorship in Greek world, and the Politeia is no more than its Manifesto. The commander-in-chief is Plato himself.\n\n26For Crossman Platonic philosophy is “the most savage and the most profound attack upon liberal ideas”. It denies every basic axiom of ‘progressive’ thought and challenges its ideals. Equality, freedom, and self-government are condemned as illusions. Plato claims that man should be more realistic, and be free from such illusions. The perfect state is not a democracy of rational equals, but an aristocracy of inequalities among men. Crossman admits repeatedly that liberal ideas are losing their effectiveness, and a kind of spiritual revitalization is necessary. In this situation, a growing number of people are showing a more serious interest in the ‘dictatorship by the best’. In this context, the battle of Plato has gained a real political meaning.\n\n27Half of his book is allocated to a fictional account of how Plato would view the contemporary European political regime. Plato begins his visit with Great Britain. He is troubled by the different meaning of the concept of democracy, but soon he recognizes that British regime is in fact an aristocracy depending upon the natural submissiveness of the poor, and that good government is preferred to self-government there. The British system can enjoy its stability by mobilizing a ‘noble lie’ such as self-government, individual freedom, parliamentary system, and change of power. Plato does not think the British have the best political system, but recognizes that they have a ‘less vicious’ one. Plato consistently criticizes the attempt to introduce true democracy (popular government) in Great Britain because his experience of democracy was so terrible. He found eventually that “the safest defence against real democracy is the ‘noble lie’ of Representative Government”.\n\n28Next Plato visits the Soviet Union, with its communistic system. Was Plato a communist ? Crossman says no in various respects. Plato would not be in sympathy with modern socialism, which is based on economic justice and workers’ control, even though he would be ready to recognize the failure of capitalism. He would say that the problem of economic justice is not the real problem, and control by the workers could not improve the situation very much. Insofar as socialism is a product of class warfare, it cannot overcome it. The basic objective of the government is to change the heart of men, so that Plato would feel only disgust for the Communist glorification of material and technological advance. Plato would consider that the United States and Russia shared a common aim (acquisitive instinct), in spite of difference of political system, a difference in method alone.\n\n29According to Crossman, Plato would be interested in the Russian experiment even though the doctrine of communism is the fiercest enemy of true philosophy. Above all, he would be strongly impressed with “a self-conscious attempt to plan human society in accordance with a clear philosophy of life”. He would recognize that “the rulers of Russia are indeed philosopher-kings who have organized their State on clear-cut philosophical principles”. So there would be a good possibility that Plato would praise the socio-political system of the USSR. Moreover the educational program of the Politeia could be accepted by the Russian government, and Plato would admire the Communist Party organization, whose members were “subjected to military discipline, and schooled to accept without question the philosophy and the policy of its leaders”. Then Crossman discusses the similarity between Plato and Lenin. Both of them agree that philosophy and science should be mobilized to change social reality, and believe that such changes are feasible. At the same time, neither is reluctant to use power ruthlessly in order to abolish vested interests. “Plato believed the philosopher must become king : Lenin achieved it.” Plato would not pay much attention to the theory that supported a more genuine democracy in communism. Rather he would praise Stalin’s very skillful use of a ‘noble lie’ such as democracy and proletarian freedom at a proper time, on the basis of a profound contempt for the stupidity of the common people. His praise of Stalin seems to be more impressive when we consider the series of great purges in 1930s Russia. In describing Plato’s visit to Russia, Crossman suggests that the communistic regime is the real embodiment of the idea of philosopher king in the 1930s, and that Plato’s observation of Russia is more realistic than the official doctrine of communism such as the proletarian dictatorship and the death of the state.\n\n30Third, Plato visits Germany to analyze this new regime. During his visit, Plato is supposed to write to Aristotle, because Aristotle would be helpful to classifying this regime. First of all, Plato recognizes that the message of National Socialism is full of such ‘noble lies’ as that every evil results from Jews. Then Plato happens to face the reality that he himself is mobilized in National Socialism, for a professor confesses in public that he studied Plato according to liberal prejudices, but has recently published a new book titled Platon und der Ursprung des Nationalsozialistischen Staatsgedankens for the consolidation of National Socialism. The professor went on to say that Plato advised the revolution which Hitler achieved, and rejecting democratic Athens he praised Sparta in terms of its military training and its educational system.\n\n31He continues tediously, affirming that “Sparta was Plato’s ideal, and it is our Nazi ideal, too” and so on. Eventually the audience expresses its dissatisfaction with this long speech, and he is ordered to leave the platform. Later Plato interviews him and corrects his misunderstandings of Plato’s doctrine one by one. At the same time Plato utters a harsh critique of German philosophers, insofar as in Germany the ‘noble lie’ was assumed to be superior to philosophical truth, and philosophers were flattering politicians rather than being leading politicians. If this tendency were to continue, Plato predicts, the ‘noble lie’ would dominate without limits, and Germany would be thrown into tyranny rather than regenerate. The basic motives of the new rulers are ambition and power, so that Plato tells Aristotle that the National Socialist State seems to be ‘a mixed constitution containing elements of both timocracy and oligarchy.’\n\n32Plato’s fictional visits to communist and fascist regimes displays how Crossman tries to answer the problem of the coincidence, or lack of coincidence, between Plato and both these political systems. It is characteristic that Plato has no sympathy with fascism. In any case, the report of the visits illustrates the impact of realist Plato very clearly. Crossman finally discusses the problem of the relationship between Plato and liberal democracy. First of all, he examines Plato’s so-called realism. Plato starts out from the recognition of the irrational nature of the common man on the one hand, while on the other he designs the new regime presupposing the presence of exceptionally gifted statesmen. But Crossman stresses that this presupposition is extremely unrealistic and far from realities of human life. In fact, Plato overlooks the basic reality that politics is necessary because no extraordinarily gifted personality exists in this world. Plato, basing himself on wrong presuppositions, makes the highest demands of the rulers and requires absolute submission of the governed, who are to abdicate their own self-realization. Owing to his bias, in fact, Plato puts supremely wise statesman and ‘real’ gentleman in the same category. So “Platonism, because it is at once too ideal and not ideal enough, becomes the rational apologia for reaction”. At the same time the basic problem of Platonic political thinking is that Plato cannot realize that the main issue is not replacing one dictatorship by another, but replacing dictatorship by a constitutional system and rule of law, because the ancient Greek situation was too dominated by harsh power battles to allow Plato to realize this basic change of perspective. In connection with this argument, Crossman criticizes the thesis of the philosopher king, in which absolute truth should be imposed upon the masses. The dictatorship by philosophers violates the nature of philosophical research, because human reason cannot reach infallible and absolute truth. Crossman recognizes it is time to review the democratic regime free from the prejudices of old liberal axioms and to consolidate its intellectual position anew in a turbulent situation. In spite of these criticisms, Plato’s arguments can contribute to this consolidation through their realistic, shrewd observations. In other words, liberal democracy has no good prospect unless it can survive Plato’s intellectual challenge.\n\n33Finally, I come to a brief discussion of Popper’s arguments. His book picks out Plato as one of the key intellectual enemies to “our civilization” which is “aiming at humaneness and reasonableness, at equality and freedom”. While our civilization aims at an “open society” which would liberate the critical powers of human beings, its enemies try to defend a “closed society”. At the same time, Popper thinks we live in a critical stage of historical transition from a ‘closed society’ to an ‘open society’, so that he criticizes some forms of social science and philosophy which claim to prophesy the course of historical events by discovering laws of history. This way of thinking, namely historicism, implies the historical inevitability of totalitarianism. So historicism is also a main target of his attack in this work. Yet it seems difficult to incorporate Plato into the category of historicism, which originates in 18th or 19th century. Popper tries to solve this difficult problem by providing the interpretation that Plato did not write his Politeia as a design for the future, but simply tried to identify his ideal state in the beginning of the history. In other words, Plato was an absolute defender of the past and an antagonist of historical change itself. According to Popper, Plato’s ideal state at the beginning of the history is a kind of tribal society as well as a Spartan state and caste state, which consists of a ruling class having absolute power and of the group of livestock simply subjected to the ruling class. The main aim of the ideal state was to prevent the danger both of change and of decay. This aim could be realized by a strongly unified ruling class, whose members are not only racially superior but also are educated and trained so thoroughly that they can remain as a unified group of warriors without being disturbed by internal conflict. Thus, the ideal state for Plato was Sparta, not Athens.\n\n34Popper recognizes that Plato was thinking in the stage of dissolution of tribal society, and he came to Socrates’ philosophy in order to grasp the norm of human nature. In this sense the Politeia was originally intended as the recovery of the natural order, but Plato conceptualizes an organic community in which only a tiny number of elite can realize the nature of human beings. This basic design should be contrasted with the principle of universalism and equalitarianism supported by Christianity and humanism, according to Popper. Popper displays no interest in how Socrates’ philosophy is realized in the Politeia. His main interest is to stress how strongly this community is dominated by Plato’s longing for tribal society. According to Popper, the reality of Plato’s community is the rule of the strong over the weak, so that there is only biological naturalism. In other words, Socrates’ philosophy has almost nothing to do with it.\n\n35Popper characterizes Plato’s programme as consisting of five elements : namely strict division of class, identification of the fate of the state with that of the ruling class, monopoly of military virtue and training by the ruling class, censorship of all intellectual activities of the ruling class and self-sufficiency of the state. Criticizing Crossman’s argument, Popper says that “Plato’s political programme, far from being morally superior to totalitarianism, is fundamentally identical with it”. The objections against this view are “based upon an ancient and deep-rooted prejudice in favour of idealizing Plato”. Giving a typical example, the translation of Politeia by Republic in the English speaking countries has helped to cultivate the image that Plato must be a liberal. Plato’s doctrine supports a radical statism which can be characterized as an intentional attack against egalitarianism and individualism. The main problem is the spell of Plato as “a teacher of morals” so that “his ethics is the nearest approach to Christianity before Christ”. He claims that the spell of Plato is one of the causes that help spread totalitarian mentality.\n\n36Popper also pays attention to Plato’s inclination to utopian social engineering. This social engineering is designed as a tool to reverse the basic historical trend of Greek society from ‘closed society’ to ‘open society’. His doctrine is part of a counter-revolutionary attempt against the egalitarianism, humanism and universalism realized in Athenian democracy. The great spirit of Athenian democracy was embodied by Pericles as well as his mentor Socrates, while Plato continued to belong to the group of the Oligarchy. Plato in fact betrayed his mentor Socrates. For Popper, the Politeia is a political document for reform instigated by strong personal ambition and self-love. Behind Plato’s theory of the philosopher-king, Popper tries to identify a strong longing for power, which reminds us of the Nietzsche’s stress on ‘will to power’ in philosophical thinking.\n\nAn ending\n\n37The controversy about Plato is a historical product of the era in which people could no longer understand the tradition of Western intellectual history as a harmonious and seamless development. In fact, this kind of controversy was repeated many times in Western intellectual history. Friedrich Nietzsche, a symbol of the rejection of harmonious development, set the basic standard by mobilizing Plato against liberalism and democracy (egalitarianism) as the glorious achievement of the modern era. The clash between tradition and modernity is revealed. It can encourage a doubt about the universal authority of liberalism and democracy and an interest in the possibility of a new revolutionary regime. The 19th century was characterized as the century of liberalism, but in reality its liberalism consisted of various heterogeneous intellectual trends. At the beginning of the 20th century its status quo position was challenged in different aspects and its crisis intensified very rapidly. The decline of economic liberalism definitely accelerated its crisis. The criticisms of Plato I refer to here reflect the crisis of liberalism in the first part of the 20th century. In other words, liberalism is forced to reconsider its real standpoint and to change. The impeachment of Plato is seen as a symbol of the self-purification of liberalism.\n\n39Even in the postwar era, the model of Plato’s philosopher-king, namely the intimate relations between philosophical truth and political power, continued to be a relevant problem. As Crossman’s fiction indicates, the problem was still a real issue under the Cold War.\n\n42Political thinking of the second half of the 20th century can be definitely characterized as a flight from the spell of Plato. The main players are such concepts as spontaneous order, the market, plurality of the subject, pluralism (from interest-group pluralism to identity pluralism) which replace the fabrication of a political system according to a specific model. These concepts shared the common agenda, either in the name of freedom or in the name of efficiency, of decreasing the power of government that had been increased in the first half of the 20th century. Their pressure was strong enough to destroy and to dissolve the most powerful political regime originating in the first half of the 20th century, namely the communist regime. Globalization gave these concepts visible reality, and the idea of freedom and equality seemed to be absolutely dominant.\n\n43Yet the orientation of historical dynamism is highly changeable. Might not the weakening or dissolving of the political/economic system constructed under the influence of the spell of Plato( ?) increase instability and unpredictability ? If Plato’s intellectual stance of understanding politics through the model of work originates from a deep irritation with the instability and unpredictability of politics, are we preparing for the way to the next round of the spell of Plato ? As the sudden collapse of financial markets shows us, the historical pendulum required a more powerful commitment on the part of the government. As far as the industrialized countries are concerned, most people are facing more instability and unpredictability than before. On this occasion, the controversy over Plato in the 20th century asks us what we could learn from the experiences of the 20th century and how we can make a wiser decision than our predecessors."
