[...] He is the object of admiration and the leader (without wanting to be) of the entire philological world of Leipzig, who can hardly await the time when they will hear him as their docent. You will say that I am describing a kind of ‘phenomenon’; well, he is that” (Friedrich Ritschl). “Your investigations on the sources of Diogenes are certainly of the highest value; and the conclusion, which had already been recommended to me in your earlier essay—that Diocles had been the main source—has now been further confirmed” (Eduard Zeller). “Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche [...] has made splendid achievements” (Conrad Bursian). The Birth of Tragedy is “a work of profound imaginative insight, which left the scholarship of a generation toiling in the rear” (F. M. Cornford). Here, in essence, stands the ambivalent status of Nietzsche as a scholar of antiquity. On the one hand we have exuberant praise of his insight and potential, and on the other, equally exuberant revulsion at his dilettantism and failure to have actualized that potential. For their divergence, what they all have in common is that their judgment is not of a philosopher, but of a young scholar. It is this Nietzsche whom we wish to consider here: Nietzsche, the scholar of antiquity, whom no one doubts was brilliant, but about whose scholarly reputation deep ambivalence remains. Indeed, before Friedrich Nietzsche became one of the preeminent philosophers of the nineteenth century, before the thunder of Zarathustra and the Antichrist, before the Overman and the Eternal Recurrence, he was a professional scholar of antiquity. As a philology student at Bonn (1864–5) and then Leipzig (1865–9), he studied under the distinguished classicists Otto Jahn and Friedrich Ritschl. On the merit of his philological publications concerning the text of the poet Theognis and that of the biographer Diogenes Laertius he was famously granted a doctorate from the University of Leipzig without examination and at age 24 was appointed Extraordinarius professor of philology at Basel University in the spring of 1869. He was promoted to Ordinarius Professor just a year later. He lectured for a decade with mixed success at both the university and the local Pädagogium on themes ranging from early Greek philosophy, the Platonic Dialogue, and Aristotle’s Rhetoric, to Greek music drama, religious\n\n9781472511522_txt_print.indd 17\n\n25/11/2013 13:30\n\nxviii Introduction institutions, lyric poetry, Latin grammar, literary history, Aeschylus, Homer, and Hesiod. And while his lecture notes and correspondence fill out many thick volumes, his published philological corpus amounts to eight articles—half in Latin and half in German—and eight short reviews dating from 1867 to 1873. He requested, and was rejected, to transfer to the philosophy department in January, 1871. Having taken a year-long curative leave from the university in 1876, he resigned due to poor health in May 1879. Although there has been no shortage of voices praising or denouncing Nietzsche, few researchers of Nietzsche and fewer classicists have taken the time to understand him on his own terms as a scholar of antiquity. Nietzsche’s articles have gathered little but dust over the past century. His copious volumes of lecture notes were left out of the Kritische Studienausgabe entirely, and some did not even merit inclusion in the allegedly comprehensive Kritische Gesamtausgabe. And while of course there have been collections published on Nietzsche’s scholarly activity before, even these only scrape the surface of Nietzsche’s activity. The main reason for this neglect, said briefly, is that his work is widely considered “immature” by philosophers and “non-classical” by classicists. Philosophically minded Nietzsche scholarship, on the one hand, values his philological work mainly as a preparatory stage for his more mature thought. Such presentations are intrinsically interesting for those who wish to understand the origins and development of Nietzsche’s most famous mature theories. But by measuring Nietzsche’s scholarship in the light of his later philosophy, these scholars persistently overlook the value of his early ancient studies in-themselves. Nietzsche’s lectures on Greek religion, his reflections on lyric poetry, and his insights about the function of rhythm were intended to inform and convince his readers and students about those subjects, not to reveal immature traces of future genius. Unlike those approaches, our primary aim is to show not how Nietzsche’s earlier works on antiquity help us to understand Nietzsche, but how they may improve our understanding of antiquity. Classical scholars, on the other hand, have consistently overlooked the value of Nietzsche’s scholarly efforts insofar as they, too, tended to value him through the lens of his later philosophical works. And a fair part of that philosophical work involves criticizing, and indeed mocking, academics generally and scholars of antiquity particularly. Nietzsche’s scholarly resumé is marred insofar as he was unfairly disdainful towards the views of his colleagues; insofar as his work stands unsupported by the critical apparati of rigorous academic scholarship; and insofar as his interpretations are said to be “Nietzschean” rather than “scholarly.” These judgments, which have persisted among philologists from the time of Hermann Usener and Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, may to some extent be an accurate condemnation of The Birth of Tragedy. But they are plainly false with respect to Nietzsche’s scholarly articles, professional reviews, and philological lectures, each of which reveals their author to be a remarkably careful and insightful scholar. Our collection will hopefully go some way towards dispelling the long-held image of Nietzsche as a scholarly dilettante. Even if we consider the work strictly on its own merits, the question as to how we might assess Nietzsche as a scholar remains. Should we count up the number of\n\n9781472511522_txt_print.indd 18\n\n25/11/2013 13:30\n\nIntroduction\n\nxix\n\narticles and the impact rating of the journals in which he published? Nietzsche would probably have earned tenure but not a professorship in today’s university. Should we consider the scope of influence of his theory of tragedy? If so, then his name would rank above Winckelmann and Mommsen. Should we measure Nietzsche’s work against some standard of universally accepted interpretation? Nietzsche admittedly fails here, as few would accept his theories without qualification; but then again, so do Wolf and Schliemann. Should we judge whether Nietzsche successfully applied the accepted methods and produced work in keeping with his scholarly climate? Such would be to ignore Nietzsche’s criticisms of those same methods and climates, criticisms which did, in fact, make a major contribution to the transformation of classical studies today. There is, one may argue, no single universal measure by which to assess Nietzsche’s value as a scholar of antiquity. So, to address the question of value without forcing it into one standard or another, the editors of this volume held a workshop at the Technical University in Berlin in November 2011. Gathering experts in both Nietzsche-studies and philology, we sought to critically examine Nietzsche’s positions on Ancient themes themselves in order to let the experts decide what Nietzsche’s value has been and will continue to be. Covered were topics ranging from Nietzsche’s knowledge and use of philology, his lectures on Greek literature, his contribution to Homeric studies, the interpretive contours of his work on early Greek philosophers, and his appreciation of Ancient science. The workshop participants—Babette Babich, Joachim Latacz, Matthew Meyer, Glenn Most, Carlotta Santini, Alexey Zhavoronkov, and ourselves—have published revised versions of our papers here. We are joined by the new research of our colleagues Douglas Burnham, Hubert Cancik and Hildegard Cancik-Lindemaier, James I. Porter, and Vivetta Vivarelli. To round out this selection, we have been given generous permission from Walter de Gruyter Press to publish a new translation of “Die Quellen von Nietzsches Rhetorik-Vorlesung” by Glenn Most and Thomas Fries, as well as the seminal “Nietzsche and Diogenes Laertius” by Jonathan Barnes. We believe that such an interdisciplinary and international dialogue will be of significant benefit to both Nietzsche studies, in uncovering what has been so long neglected, and classical studies, in reexamining the reputation of one of its own greatest prodigies. The hope is that, having weighed these 13 papers on their own terms, the reader will form their own opinion on Nietzsche’s value as a scholar of antiquity. The two opening chapters can be read as complementary approaches to the question of how we consider Nietzsche as a scholar. Both are convinced of his importance for classical studies, though for quite different reasons. Joachim Latacz shows how Nietzsche’s meteoric rise in the field must be contextualized within the social, political, and academic conditions of classical studies in the nineteenth century. Drawing especially on Nietzsche’s 1871 publication “Certamen Homeri et Hesiodi,” Latacz situates Nietzsche’s achievement as an ingenious but not unassailable contribution to meat-and-potatoes classical scholarship. James I. Porter also esteems Nietzsche’s scholarship highly; but it is on account of his iconoclasm, his critique of then current methods and ideals, and his undermining of\n\n9781472511522_txt_print.indd 19\n\n25/11/2013 13:30\n\nxx Introduction what had long been uncritically accepted under the name philology that Porter locates Nietzsche’s value. Porter turns to Nietzsche’s notebooks and lectures—especially to his fascinating but unheralded lectures on Aeschylus’ Choephori, his work on metrics, and his “Encyclopedia of Classical Philology”—to reconstruct the radicalism of his thinking, and points to overlooked connections between Nietzsche and J. G. Droysen’s History of Hellenism. The co-authored piece by Glenn W. Most and Thomas Fries forms a thematic unit with Douglas Burnham’s chapter as well. Both papers are concerned with the process by which Nietzsche produced aspects of his work—two unique glimpses into the artist’s studio, as it were. But, as before, Nietzsche can present two different faces to the philological and philosophical sides of his thinking. Most’s and Fries’ examination of how Nietzsche constructed his Basel lectures on rhetoric reveals Nietzsche in situ as a workaday philologist, critically examining sources, parsing the arguments of earlier scholars, and arranging a welter of historical material for the sake of his students. Most and Fries are able to show that the specific ways Nietzsche drew on his sources were in fact grounded in what he himself understood about the ancient tendencies of borrowing, epitomizing, etc. What Douglas Burnham reveals, by contrast, is a portrait of a genius who has already done the philological leg work, and who proceeds from there to intuit the wider scope of antiquity. That scope, as is well known, was only fully explicated in Nietzsche’s first book, The Birth of Tragedy. But never before have the various stages, the twisting developments that led to Nietzsche’s eventual pronouncement about the duality of the Dionysian and Apollonian, been elucidated. Burnham particularly emphasizes the significance of Apollo and of Apollonian cheerfulness as a conscious necessity of illusion. His chapter makes a substantial contribution to the question of how the philological Nietzsche became the philosophical Nietzsche. The three papers arranged in the cluster “Scholarly Achievement” each investigate Nietzsche’s earliest publications and their impact on the field. Anthony K. Jensen elucidates Nietzsche’s innovations with respect to manuscript analysis and critico-linguistic philology in his Schulpforta valediction and first article, on Theognis of Megara. He shows how Nietzsche attempted to reconstruct the authentic text of Theognis out of a maze of corruptions, emendations, and editorial falsifications. Nietzsche’s article was relatively well received by colleagues in the field, and retains a certain currency today. A reprint of Jonathan Barnes’ paper on Nietzsche’s source criticism of Diogenes Laertius’ Lives of the Philosophers will remind readers of the painstaking and meticulous nature of Nietzsche’s research. Despite his status as the “night watchman” of our knowledge of antiquity, Nietzsche demonstrates that large portions of Diogenes’ biographies are taken over—often entirely and often uncritically—from other sources, especially from Diocles of Magnesia. Nietzsche identified a major problem in philology, and offered solutions that to this day still receive some support. On the “Homer Question,” which seemingly left little room for innovation in Nietzsche’s day, Alexey Zhavoronkov is able to prove that Nietzsche’s insights still carry weight for a wide swathe of scholars. Even though relatively few contemporary Homer scholars cite Nietzsche as an authority, his particular variant on the “singleauthor” mode of interpretation receives frequent echoes throughout European and\n\n9781472511522_txt_print.indd 20\n\n25/11/2013 13:30\n\nIntroduction\n\nxxi\n\nAnglophone Homer studies. Nietzsche’s focus on the non-literary background of the Homeric poems connects him with the strong movement of oral poetry studies. Turning to Nietzsche’s massive collection of notes for his lecture series On the History of Greek Literature, Carlotta Santini’s contribution is one of three papers that address Nietzsche’s fascinating ideas about Greek literature, language, and culture. Santini reconstructs Nietzsche’s lectures from the perspective of a singular question: what does it mean for our historical reconstruction of Greek literature that it grew out of an oral—and what’s more, a mostly illiterate—culture? The twentieth century’s preoccupation with orality in history and literature is prefigured in Nietzsche’s consideration of literacy as a somewhat unwelcomed cultural byproduct. Vivetta Vivarelli’s paper also investigates Greek literary culture, but this time from the perspective of Nietzsche’s focus on the receiver rather than the producer of literary affect: namely, the audience. Especially in his “On Greek Music Drama,” Nietzsche incorporated his developing philosophical theory of linguistic affectivity into his scholarly discoveries about Greek music drama, poetry, tragedy, and rhythmic versification. He was able to illuminate the holistic dynamic of affectation between authors and audience, and thereby discern the wide gap between early Greek high culture and what became “learned” Western culture. That relationship between what counts as proper philosophy and what counts as affective poetry is also considered by Matthew Meyer, through the lens of Nietzsche’s Birth of Tragedy. Nietzsche understood Plato’s noted quarrel between poetry and philosophy not simply as two means of expressing ideas, but as the changing of a cultural epoch. The scholarly-philosophical turn inculcated by Plato meant not only the end of that kind of literary activity indicated by Santini and Vivarelli—it meant the death of the entire “tragic age” that gave rise to it. This insight bears on Nietzsche’s own vision of learned scholarship, and by implicit extension, on our conception of Nietzsche as a scholar. The last group of papers proves how wide Nietzsche’s interests were: covering core questions about philosophy, science, and religion. Helmut Heit examines Nietzsche’s engagement with early Greek philosophy in his lectures on the pre-Platonic philosophers and in “Philosophy in the Tragic Age of Greece.” A comparison with contemporary studies like those of Eduard Zeller or Friedrich Ueberweg indicates timely as well as untimely features. Nietzsche’s genealogy of Greek philosophy, Heit argues, is particularly original due to his focus on the personality of philosophers, his revision of the order between archaic and classic Greece, and his uncovering of artistic and metaphysical aspects within the alleged rise from myth to reason. Babette Babich focuses on the gap between early Greek and later Hellenic culture, too; but through the lens of Nietzsche’s attention to the phenomena of Greek science. Babich’s question is Nietzsche’s: given that the early Greeks already possessed the theoretical, mathematical, and technical prerequisites to develop what we today call “science,” why didn’t they do so? While there is, of course, no simple answer, to even address the problem—as Nietzsche was the first to do—requires a similarly wide range of investigations into the nature of truth, value, and life itself. Hubert Cancik and Hildegard Cancik-Lindemaier exemplify our volume’s goal to read Nietzsche’s early work carefully and in a contextualized way. Drawing from\n\n9781472511522_txt_print.indd 21\n\n25/11/2013 13:30\n\nxxii Introduction two sets of notes recorded in a single notebook, the Canciks are able to show the fascinating interconnection between Nietzsche’s Basel lectures on early Greek religion and his thoughts about the shortcomings of his contemporary philology, which were to have been published as the fourth Untimely Meditation, called “We Philologists.” Doing so allows the Canciks to trace the substantial development in Nietzsche’s thinking about early culture, religion, and civil society immediately after his publication of The Birth of Tragedy. Taken individually, the reader will, we hope, find that Nietzsche almost always has something insightful to say on each of these topics, a fresh and penetrating insight that contributes genuinely to the enduring and interdisciplinary conversation about Greek antiquity. Taking this book as a collection, and in its intrinsic interdisciplinarity and international tenor, our hope is that the reader will have a more exact and more comprehensive portrait of Nietzsche’s activities as a scholar of antiquity.

Since I happened to be the seventh successor of Nietzsche on the chair for Greek Philology in Basel, I have been confronted with the issue for 21 years—from 1981 until my retirement in 2002. Therefore I gratefully accept the opportunity to answer this question, to a hopefully somewhat satisfying extent, which apparently continues to gnaw on the self-confidence of many students and also colleagues. To clarify at the start: there was neither ignorance nor fraud involved in Nietzsche’s appointment. At the time, it was both justified and reasonable, as I will establish in the following. Therefore let us go for a moment to the “low-lying areas of philology”—to speak with the later Nietzsche—those areas which—as Nietzsche also emphasized in his later work—were one way or another the preconditions for his later intellectual flight. In Gay Science, 102, it says, under the heading “A Word for the Philologists”: “That there are books so precious and royal, that good use has been made of whole races of scholars, when through their labor these books are preserved purely and intelligibly – to assure this belief is the purpose of philology” (KSA 3, 458f.). So we may hope that Nietzsche will gaily accompany us on the way hereafter. First, a brief sketch of biographical circumstances: The dates and facts are of course known. They shall nevertheless be brought to mind, to ensure that the young Nietzsche and indeed the young Nietzsche as a philologist will be at the center of my presentation.\n\n9781472511522_txt_print.indd 3\n\n25/11/2013 13:30\n\n4\n\nNietzsche as a Scholar of Antiquity\n\nYear\n\nAge\n\n*1844, Oct. 15 1850–1858\n\n6–13\n\n1858, Oct. 1864, Oct. 1865, Oct. 1869, Feb. 10 Summer Term 1869 1870, Mar. 1870, Mar.–Aug. 1879, June 14\n\n14 20 21 24 24 25 25 34\n\nLocation Röcken near Leipzig Private school and Dom-Gymnasium in Naumburg/Saale Schulpforta near Naumburg/Saale University of Bonn University of Leipzig Call for the University of Basel Basel University, extraordinary Professor Basel University, ordinary Professor German-French War (corpsman) Retirement (pension: 3000 CHF p.a.)\n\nAfter childhood at the parsonage of the village Röcken (between Naumburg and Merseburg near Halle/Saale) and having enjoyed private tutoring and thereafter attendance at the cathedral school in Naumburg, the 14-year-old Nietzsche received a free-of-charge place at the then elite boarding gymnasium Schulpforta near Naumburg in October 1858. In September 1864, at the age of 19, he completed his high school education. (Two years earlier, Ulrich v. Wilamowitz-Moellendorff joined Schulpforta; so the 17-year-old Nietzsche and the 14-year-old Wilamowitz were indeed acquainted.) Only one month after graduation from Schulpforta, Nietzsche enrolled for theology and philosophy at the University of Bonn for the 1864/65 winter term, but as soon as the following spring term, 1865, he changed his studies to philology—which then meant Classical philology. When his revered teacher Friedrich Ritschl, after the well-known 1865 Bonner Gelehrtenstreit [Scholar’s Fight at Bonn] with Otto Jahn, went to the University of Leipzig, Nietzsche followed him for the 1865/66 winter term. From October 1865 until February 1969, i.e. nearly nine semesters, Nietzsche stayed in Leipzig. On February 10, 1869, the 24-year-old received an offer of appointment at Basel, which he immediately accepted. Just three and a half months later, on the 28th of May, Nietzsche gave his inaugural lecture in Basel on “Homer and Classical Philology” (BAW 5, 283–305). A year later he was made a full professor. So much for the chronological frame. How was such a speedy career possible? The answer will be given in the form of three partial elaborations and an outlook: (1) The social preconditions for acquiring a high philological competence at a young age at Nietzsche’s time, (2) the attitude of the young Nietzsche towards philology, (3) Nietzsche’s philological achievements from Schulpforta until Basel (exemplarily exhibited through the “Certamen Homeri et Hesiodi”), and (4) outlook: The impact of Nietzsche’s youthful achievements on Classical Philology in his time, and until the present.\n\n9781472511522_txt_print.indd 4\n\n25/11/2013 13:30\n\nOn Nietzsche’s Philological Beginnings\n\n5\n\n1. The social preconditions of higher education Nietzsche’s attitude towards philology as a youth must be viewed in light of the ordinary course of education in middle- and high-class German-speaking societies. Children in families of teachers, pastors, physicians, attorneys etc.—naturally mostly boys—were already made familiar with literature and art at a preschool age. They were indeed to be trained for similar professions and lives as their fathers. At the time that Nietzsche grew up—a time without modern media!—literature, history, and music stood at the forefront. Literature mostly meant the classics, thus Shakespeare, Lessing, Goethe, Schiller, Kleist, but also Jean Paul, Rousseau etc., and additionally the philosophy of the Enlightenment and German Idealism. History meant national history—beginning with Germanic heroic legends—and, on the other hand, antiquity. Stories and discussions on matters and topics from these areas belonged to a domestic preschool education. Antiquity formed the basis for poetry and philosophy. It was omnipresent in Nietzsche’s childhood and teenage years. Four years prior to Nietzsche’s birth Gustav Schwab’s Schönste Sagen des klassischen Alterthums was published in three volumes. These might well have had a place on the bookshelves of every middle-class house. One can imagine the acquaintance with books of this sort in the description of the 22-years-older Heinrich Schliemann, also the son of a pastor. In his autobiographical account of his childhood, he writes: Although my father was neither a philologist nor an archaeologist, he had a passionate interest in the history of antiquity; with warm enthusiasm [!] he often told me about the tragic decline of Herculaneum and Pompeii [...] He often told me admiringly about the deeds of the Homeric heroes and the Trojan War, too [...] (Schliemann 1892, 4)\n\nThe nostalgic and romantic, and at times involuntarily comical tone of these reminiscences should not delude anyone. This was only common during the period, which they were recalling, namely: Romanticism. Admittedly, Schliemann is known to have mythified his childhood, but we possess enough autobiographical material by intellectuals who grew up during the mid-nineteenth century to be able to achieve a general sense of the atmosphere at the time. In those days, education, education and again education was at the center of the aspiring bourgeoisie. It is not for nothing that we speak of “Bildungsbürgertum.” In the process, antiquity played the main role. The foundations for the later development of young people were thus laid here. Those foundations were fostered and strengthened further in school. The gymnasium in those years quite naturally was that of the classical type. In the last third of the eighteenth century the Second Humanism or Neo-Humanism had begun to flourish, which among other things meant a revival in the fascination with antiquity not only for the sciences. At the end of the century Christian Gottlob Heyne in Göttingen and his student Friedrich August Wolf in Halle had freed philology from the bonds of theology and established it as a proper discipline (cf. Latacz 2002). In 1787 Wolf had instituted the first “Philologisches Seminar” in Halle. Greek and Latin teachers, who were educated here and in similar seminars, brought the movement as “Gymnasialprofessoren” into the then rather ailing landscape of secondary education,\n\n9781472511522_txt_print.indd 5\n\n25/11/2013 13:30\n\nNietzsche as a Scholar of Antiquity\n\n6\n\ntoo. That landscape, on the other hand, was already quite well prepared for this tempest, fortunately: In 1809/10 Heyne’s student Wilhelm v. Humboldt and his friend Friedrich Schleiermacher had replaced the old Fürstenschulen and Latin-schools with the “humanistic” Gymnasium through the Prussian university- and school-reforms. They were chosen to implement Humboldt’s “core formula in the history of education of the 19th century” (Landfester 1988, 208). In the original, this formula read: “The true end of man [...] is the highest and most proportional formation of his powers into a whole” (Humboldt [1792] 1960–81, 64)—and as ideal objects for this formation were briefly destined the “products of the Greek minds,” because, per Humboldt, “only the character of the nation of the Greeks [...] comes closest to that human character, which in every situation, without regard to individual differences, can exist and should be existent” (Humboldt [1793] 1960–81, 9; cf. Landfester 1988, 36–43, for a concise analysis). Afterwards Friedrich August Wolf gave this formula, which in his opinion was too narrowly aesthetic and emotional, a realistic, pragmatic determination of aims. In the lecture “Encyclopaedia philologica” (Pfeiffer 1982, 217), which he repeated 18 times and later published, Wolf described “classical scholarship”1 as the knowledge of antiquity in all its forms of appearance (language, literature, art, science, religion, customs, etc.), and that knowledge was reconstructed from all available types of sources (texts, artworks, and everyday phenomena such as inscriptions, coins, etc.). Therewith he defined philology—for this is what he meant by “classical scholarship”— as a historical science, which must always view and understand its objects of inquiry as far as possible in their original historical context. This universal requirement—based on a historical foundation and connected to the demands for methodological rigor in the acquisition and connection of particular phenomena—became, thanks to the reforms of 1810, the basis for classes in gymnasia for nearly one hundred years. Soon the gymnasia were flooded with new grammars of Greek and Latin, dictionaries, volumes on stylistics, editions, commentaries, etc. Manfred Landfester has illustrated how this new cultural beginning affected everyday school life on the grounds of diverse documents from the actual school practice, especially time tables (Landfester 1988): Latin and Greek classes held primacy, even before German, with a remarkable number of lessons per week by today’s standards: Latin up to 16 lessons, Greek up to 12 or 14. In elite gymnasia, such as Nietzsche’s Schulpforta, not only the extent but also the intensity of teaching was even considerably higher. Nietzsche’s diary entries from August 9 and 18, 1859 provide us with what he calls an “image of the quite ordinary life in Pforta”: Get up at 5 a.m., then—after the morning wash, the common prayer and a quick breakfast—class starts at 6 a.m. with two repetition-periods, lunch at 12 p.m., afterwards recreational time in the school yard, at 2 p.m. again class, reading and writing classes, after a short break, at 5 p.m., another two repetition-periods until 7 p.m. Then dinner and some spare time in the yard until 8:30 p.m., the evening prayer after and bedtime at 9 p.m. (BAW 1, 119f., 123, 131)\n\nSo the pupils are “in motion,” so to speak, from five in the morning until nine in the evening.2 Basically we have here a miniature version of the Republic of Letters of the Alexandrian Mouseion. Since pupils were taught Latin from the fifth grade on, i.e. at\n\n9781472511522_txt_print.indd 6\n\n25/11/2013 13:30\n\nOn Nietzsche’s Philological Beginnings\n\n7\n\nthe age of ten, it is not surprising that the best students of higher grades could almost write better in Latin than in German, and could often enough speak3 the language better too (in his graduation diploma, Nietzsche is also credited with good skills in speaking Latin),4 and accordingly they generally were more familiar with classical mythology, history, and literature by the time of high-school graduation than many contemporary students of our discipline by the time of their final university exams. This training persisted into most students’ later professional lives as a sort of conditioned routine, though it nevertheless formed a quite useful basis for communicating within the leading elite. The best students, however (and Friedrich Nietzsche belonged among them),5 students who were enchanted by the topics offered and who sought to penetrate into their depths with an inherited and then cultivated thirst for knowledge, almost always inevitably developed into experts of antiquity at an early age.\n\n2. The young Nietzsche’s attitude towards philology Nietzsche’s early attitude towards philology needs to be understood in front of this roughly sketched background. For with a person of such character and talents, his attitude is no exception to the contemporary societal context, but rather a consequence. Some comments by Nietzsche and others on this matter: (1) Already in September 1863, thus almost a year before graduation from Schulpforta, he writes to his mother: “One now lives a lot in the future and is making plans for the time at university; I am even starting to adapt my studies to it,” and for his upcoming nineteenth birthday two weeks later, Nietzsche requests “only scholarly works,” i.e. philological ones (to Elisabeth Nietzsche, September 25, 1863; KSB 1, 257).6 By “studies” he undoubtedly means his Pforta valediction, which dealt with the early Greek poet Theognis of Megara, in Latin of course: “De Theognide Megarensi” (BAW 3, 21–64; completed September 7, 1864). (2) Shortly before transferring to Bonn in 1864, Nietzsche writes in retrospect about Schulpforta in one of his characteristic self-assurances under the typical title “My Life”: [After the] transition from the Naumburg Gymnasium to Pforta, which falls on my fourteenth year, [...] my affinity for classical studies grew increasingly; with the most pleasant memories I think of the first impressions of Sophocles, of Aeschylus, of Plato, chiefly of my favorite piece of poetry, the Symposium, then of the Greek poets. I still stand in this striving, to further deepen my knowledge. (BAW 3, 66, 68)\n\n(3) Five years later in Leipzig, with his intended graduation in sight, he writes another “My Life”-retrospective: Some external contingencies were lacking; otherwise I would at the time [at the beginning of the Pforta time] have dared to become a musician, because it was to music that I felt the strongest drive from my ninth year on [...]. Only in the last part of my Pforta time, in full self-awareness, I abandoned all artistic plans for my life;\n\n9781472511522_txt_print.indd 7\n\n25/11/2013 13:30\n\nNietzsche as a Scholar of Antiquity\n\n8\n\nthe resulting gap was thereafter filled with philology. For I demanded a counterbalance against these till then varying and unsettled inclinations, for a science, which could be promoted with a cool sobriety, with logical coldness, with uniform labor, without having one’s heart be immediately touched by the results. All this I believed at that time to find in philology. The preconditions for this field are literally put in the hands of a Pforta student. Sometimes specifically philological tasks are set in this institution, e.g. critical commentaries on specific Sophoclean or Aeschylean choruses. It is furthermore a specific merit of Schulpforta, to the advantage of a future philologist, that an intense and wide-ranging reading of Greek and Roman authors is common habit amongst students, too. The luckiest thing, however, was that I encountered excellent philological teachers, through whom I developed my judgment on their science. If I would have happened to have teachers at that time, like the ones sometimes found at gymnasia, petty frog-blooded micrologists [Mikrologen], who know of science nothing but bookish dust: I would have tossed the thought of ever belonging to a science, to which such poor wretches belong, far afield. But like this, such philologists as Steinhart, Keil, Corssen, Peter lived before my eyes, men with a free view and a fresh drive, who sometimes even gave me their closer penchants. That is how it came about that in the last years at Pforta, I already dealt independently with two philological works. (BAW 5, 253f.— he is referring to the “Ermanarich” and the “Theognis”; my emphasis)\n\n(4) So far we have seen a few of Nietzsche’s own testimonies. From them we can infer not only sympathy for philology, but also a strong will and intention to definitely take on a philological career—hence, neither the theological one naturally desired by his mother, nor the philosophical one often suggested in Nietzsche-literature. Without a doubt Nietzsche read philosophical works already in Schulpforta—Schopenhauer,7 Hegel, Kant and others (that was de rigueur)—but neither in contemporaneous letters nor in later retrospectives does there appear such a decisive devotion, such a clear identification with philosophy, as it does with philology. Nevertheless, one should pay close attention: Already back then, Nietzsche distinguished between philology as technicistic dust-devourer’s work and philology as an encompassing field of the humanities. As of yet he does not express these alternatives with his later pointedness and maturity—most likely is not yet able to do so—but it is already implied in the strongly negative tone of rejection: the “petty frog-blooded micrologists, who know of science nothing but bookish dust” on the one hand, and the philologists “with a free view and a fresh drive” on the other, the latter of which he wishes to “serve.”8 (5) And these “men with a free view and a fresh drive” had for their part already found an intellectual kin in the young man. On September 7, 1864, the abovementioned Steinhart writes in a letter of recommendation to the Bonn philosophy professor Carl Schaarschmidt: “Nietzsche is of a deep, ruminative nature, gushy about philosophy, namely Platonic philosophy, about which he has already been rather well introduced. He is still oscillating between theology and philology; however, the latter will probably win.”9 One should notice the phrase “gushy about philosophy.” Already the adjective “gushy” [“schwärmerisch”] accurately reveals the contrast between philosophy and philology in Nietzsche’s early decisions. Having Nietzsche’s own\n\n9781472511522_txt_print.indd 8\n\n25/11/2013 13:30\n\nOn Nietzsche’s Philological Beginnings\n\n9\n\nretrospective on Schulpforta in mind, we recall: “I demanded [...] for a science, which could be promoted with a cool sobriety, with logical coldness, with uniform labor [...]. All this I believed to find in philology” (BAW 5, 253). (6) So it is absolutely logical that Nietzsche writes about his final decision in 1869: After I gratefully said farewell to a strict but beneficial teacher after a six years-stay at Schulpforta, I went to Bonn. Here my studies were for a while directed at the philological side of gospel critique and the basic research of the New Testament [neutestamentliche Quellenforschung]. Beyond this theological foray, I was an auditor in the philological and archaeological seminars. [So there is no mentioning of philosophy.—JL] I admired the personality of Friedrich Ritschl from afar. That is why I thought it quite natural to leave Bonn at the same time he did and to choose Leipzig as my new academic home. (BAW 5, 255)\n\n(7) So the decision is reached: in the fall term of 1865 Nietzsche begins determined studies in Classical Philology in Leipzig with a distinct emphasis on Greek. Just one year later, he becomes co-founder of the “Philologischer Verein zu Leipzig” and Ritschl’s favorite student. He pursues his studies with such success (soon producing papers ready for publication) and such certainty for the career future that he can write to his friend Erwin Rohde three years after, in May 1868, the words recorded in my prelusion: “By the way, dear friend, I am asking you sincerely, to firmly set your eyes on an academic carrière, which is to be pursued someday...” (to Rohde, May 3 or 4, 1868; KSB 2, 275). I have omitted how it continues. It reads—doggedly, but also with a clearly perceivable connotation of self-irony (one could almost say with a suggestion of fatalistic self-denial), which already points to the future: [...] a fearful self-examination is not at place (here): we simply need to, because we cannot otherwise, because we do not have a more appropriate career for our lives in front of us, because we have obstructed the way to more useful [!] positions, because we have no other means to make our constellation of vigor and view useful for our fellow human beings, than by precisely the indicated path. (To Rohde, May 3 or 4, 1868; KSB 2, 275)\n\nA few lines further: [...] as future university-knights we must do a lot ὥσθε γνωρίζεσθαι [“to become known”], thus bring up our names into journals from time to time, setting Anekdota into the world from Paris etc. After 1½ – 2 years we will habilitate in Berlin or somewhere and survive the time of “distilled hopelessness,” the time as lecturers [das Privatdozententhum], σùν ἐρχομένω [“marching together,” “in lockstep”] [...]. At any rate we will both meet this academic career without exaggerated hopes. But I think it is possible, that in the position of professor first of all a decent amount of leisure for own studies, second a useful sphere of influence, and lastly a passably independent political and social situation can be acquired and maintained. The latter, which I hinted at, we will have to our advantage before any public carrière, be it as lawyers or as schoolmasters. (To Rohde, May 3 or 4, 1868; KSB 2, 275f.)\n\n9781472511522_txt_print.indd 9\n\n25/11/2013 13:30\n\nNietzsche as a Scholar of Antiquity\n\n10\n\nSo a love for philosophy is surely not at the forefront, but rather the wish for a secure middle-class existence with some reputation (indeed, a primarily philological one). The strategic, business-like manner with which Nietzsche plans the steps for this goal is remarkable for a 23-year-old.10 In plain words, Nietzsche wanted to become professor of Classical Philology. Not even a year later, he would be one. His aim seemed achieved. Yet we will see why this aim would very soon afterwards become a heavy burden. Before that, however, a glance at Nietzsche’s philological achievements, which had made the unforeseen early attainment of his aim possible.\n\n3.

He starts with themes from Roman history and literature (Mithridates, Livy); then come themes exclusively concerned with Greek literature, except for the Ermanarich piece:11 two on Greek tragedy (Sophocles’ Ajax and Oedipus the King), two from early Greek poetry (from Callinus to Anacreon, and eventually the work on Theognis). Notably, there are no works on philosophy. In Leipzig he then works out around twenty papers, some drafted for presentation in the “Philologischer Verein,” some prepared for publication. The first of the latter was for the Rheinisches Museum für Philologie of 1867, composed at the age of 22; the last of this group appeared in the Rheinisches Museum für Philologie of 1871 when he was 26 years old (this publication of the “Certamen Homeri et Hesiodi” was of course already prepared in Leipzig, thus will be counted among the Leipzig works). The thematic range is extraordinarily broad for such a young man. It covers the early Greek poets, from Theognis to the “Certamen”—thus from the sixth century bc to the second century ad—and even up to the empress and writer Eudokía in the fifth century ad. Here we again see the same picture as from the works in Schulpforta: from the twenty works only one (at least half of it) is devoted to a theme from Roman literature, namely the one on Varro’s “Saturae” from 1868; the other nineteen are on Greek poets and prose authors. And here too not a single work on philosophy is found. What sounds like studies on Aristotle or Heraclitus is source research [Quellenstudien], and the works on Diogenes Laertius also have the disclosure of the sources for this third-century history of philosophy as their principal aim. So here too it is not a prospective philosopher speaking, but a philologist. And this philologist speaks in exclusively philological terms: Nietzsche practices ordinary philology in the old ways and according to the state of the art: in terms of its conventional diction, with its meticulous detail-analysis of texts, its examination of traditions, and with exemplary method. To reveal this with all of his works is of course not possible. Accordingly, Nietzsche’s procedure, his argumentative acuity and, foremost, his resultant ways of problem-solving (which have often been acknowledged as secured even today), will be revealed by means of one especially fruitful example: his work on the “Certamen Homeri et Hesiodi.” That we will have to descend then deeply down to the last philological detail and therefore frustrate and bore some “philosophical” readers who lack philological training is inevitable. Whoever can nevertheless convince himself to stay with the matter will notice how profound, encompassing, and detailed the scholarly\n\n9781472511522_txt_print.indd 11\n\n25/11/2013 13:30\n\n12\n\nNietzsche as a Scholar of Antiquity\n\nand methodological basis on which Nietzsche erected his later buildings of thought really is.\n\n3.1 The “Certamen Homeri et Hesiodi”12 First, in brief, the facts: During the early period of the Roman Empire, in the context of a renewed flourishing return to the great classical Greek past, a development of extensive biographical literature took place. Especially popular were biographies of poets, so called βίοι, i.e. vitae. Homer-vitae made up the majority of these. Nine of these have come down to us. All of them were composed during the Roman Empire, separated from the life and times of the creator of the Iliad by 800 to 1,700 years (like the Suda). Seven of these nine texts are by anonymous authors, the remaining two from a companion on literature (Proclus) and from the massive tenth-century encyclopedia, The Suda, respectively (Latacz 2011, 13ff.). All are compilations from various earlier writings, indeed some are probably at least partly the result of a subterranean stream of oral tradition attributable to the “collective memory”: the richer the respective source-material was, the more random the subsequent compilations. Their core consisted of a reporting string of numerous conflicting opinions by “Homerexperts” and anonymous remarks along the lines of “some say ... whereas others say.” This core was furthermore enriched with the respective author’s own ideas, inventions, and misunderstandings. In his large volume on the history of Greek literature from 1971, Albin Lesky speaks of the “hopeless state of ancient biography” (Lesky 1971, 778). The common formula of these vitae consists in, at most, six thematic points: (1) parentage, (2) place of birth, (3) name-giving, (4) (possibly) profession and travels, (5) death, (6) and maybe a catalogue of works. The value of insights from these “βίοι” is equal to nothing. In the words of Geoffrey Kirk: “Antiquity knew nothing definite about the life and personality of Homer” (Kirk 1985, 1).13 One of the longer texts in this pseudo-biographical type is the “Certamen” (Contest). The extent of it is roughly eight pages. It was recovered from a mixed codex of various essays on different themes in the Laurentiana (the Laurentianus 56, written in the fourteenth century) in Florence by Henricus Stephanus. The first thing to note is that the manuscript does not have an author’s name; Stephanus edited it in 1573 as Ὁμήρου καì Ἡσιόδου ἀγών. Homeri et Hesiodi certamen. Nunc primum luce donatum. Matronis et aliorum parodiae. Genavae anno MDLXXIII. The edition was reprinted repeatedly in volumes throughout the nineteenth century (e.g. in A. Westermann’s 1845 Βιογράφοι); the underlying manuscript was then no longer known, though. Westermann believed, for example, that a lost early Codex Parisinus served as its source. But in 1863 Valentin Rose rediscovered the original manuscript in Florence, and his reports thereon in 1863/64 created a minor sensation. Rose’s rediscovery must have incited Nietzsche to give a paper on “Der Sängerkrieg auf Euboea” in the Leipzig “Philologischer Verein” in July 1867. It has been suspected that Nietzsche modeled the title of his paper after Wagner’s opera “Tannhäuser und der Sängerkrieg auf Wartburg”, which premièred at Dresden in 1845 (Vogt 1962, 105). This is indeed possible; however, it is not substantial for determining Nietzsche’s intention, namely to evidence the authorship of the till-then-anonymous Greek text.\n\n9781472511522_txt_print.indd 12\n\n25/11/2013 13:30\n\nOn Nietzsche’s Philological Beginnings\n\n13\n\nIn his lecture, Nietzsche pays special attention to the text’s tripartite structure.14 Of its 18 sections (following Wilamowitz’s division of 1916 here), only eight (6–13) deal with the sort of “contest of Homer with Hesiod” (“Certamen”) after which Stephanus had named the entire text. Before and after this contest (Greek ἀγών), sections 1–5 and 14–18, respectively, contain the usual information of that six-point formula. Hence, the title is inaccurate. Nietzsche will later discover that this is due to Stephanus’ delight in abbreviations. The more accurate and justified title of the transmissing manuscript of the fourteenth century is: On Homer and Hesiod and their Ancestry and Competition. This agrees much better with the content, and in that tripartite structure the text really forms a—though incongruous—whole: Part I (sections 1–5): [pseudo-] biography (place of birth, ancestry, name, priority; transition to the actual “Certamen”) Part II (sections 6–13): “Certamen” Part III (sections 14–18): the fate of the two protagonists after the “Certamen,” their deaths.\n\nIn section 3, which treats Homer’s parentage and presents a variety of fantastical genealogies, the anonymous composer (better “compiler”) discloses triumphantly that he had heard “the godliest αὐτοκράτωρ [i.e. emperor] Hadrian” had come to learn a definitive answer to the question of Homer’s lineage from the Delphic oracle: namely, that Homer was the son of Telemachus and Nestor’s daughter, Epicaste.15 Hadrian ruled from ad 117–138, so the text was composed in or after this time. In the beginning of section 5 the compiler passes over to the actual “agōn”: But some say both [Homer and Hesiod] lived during the same time and actually met at Aulis in Boeotia. Because Ganyktor, son of Amphidamas the king of Euboea, offering enormous awards, had at this time summoned the most illustrious men not only in the disciplines of ‘strength’ and ‘speed’, but also in the area of ‘wisdom’ (‘sophía’) to the burial ceremony of his father, who had just died, both had sailed from Aulis to Chalcis.\n\nThis tale is spun from Hesiod’s Erga kai Hemerai (“Works and Days”), wherein Hesiod humorously remarks at one point that he had gone to sea only once in his life, to travel from Aulis to Chalcis (a passage which is today spanned by a little bridge about 213 feet wide), where he had won a tripod in a hymn-agōn.16 One notices the fiction immediately, since Hesiod does not mention one word about an “agōn” in “sophia,” let alone an “agōn” with Homer. The author continues: the referees were respected people from Chalcis chaired by the deceased’s brother, Pan-edes (Nietzsche en passant correctly translated the name to “All-Know” [All-Weiß]). Then Hesiod stepped into the middle and queried Homer— and Homer answered. This distribution of roles will then remain like this almost throughout the entire “agōn” (note that we do not have a competition here exactly, but rather a sort of viva). That examination begins in section 6: question and answer appropriate for two epic poets, i.e. in hexameters. There are three “courses” or “rounds.”\n\n9781472511522_txt_print.indd 13\n\n25/11/2013 13:30\n\nNietzsche as a Scholar of Antiquity\n\n14\n\nAt first Hesiod asks what the best would be for mortals and what people desire the most. After Homer answers this to Hesiod’s annoyance, Hesiod challenges him in the second round with a seemingly unsolvable riddle, an ἄπορον (“aporia”), and, after Homer solved this elegantly too, he moves on to a new sort of question, which Martin West has called a “party game” (West 1967, 440): Hesiod presents a completely absurd hexameter and Homer offhandedly turns it into something comprehensible, thus spontaneously improvising (σχεδιάζειν in §14: this term is crucial for the intention of the whole): “So they feasted now all day long without having anything,” and Homer complemented this paradox to a meaningful: “[...] in their own homes: it was given to them by the prince of men Agamemnon.” After Homer brilliantly solved 14 such paradoxes, Hesiod turns to more radical means: How many Achaeans came with the Atrides to Ilios? Homer solves this “adynaton” impressively, too, with the help of a complicated calculation. Hesiod becomes envious and, in the third round, asks ethical questions, seven in total; the final one reads: “To fortune now—what do people consider it?” Homer replies: “To die after having suffered the least, and having been happy the most instead.” Then the Héllēnes, so the text continues, cannot take it any longer and demand victory for Homer. But the referee “All-Know” demands both to recite that passage from their works, over and above, which each of them considers most beautiful. Thereupon Hesiod recites a praise of field-work from his Erga. Homer, however, offers a shining depiction of the fighting from the thirteenth book of the Iliad, in which he speaks of manliness, courage, and the glory of arms. Again the Hellenes demand victory for Homer. But Pan-edes, the “All-Know,” declares victory instead for Hesiod, since it is just to honor the representative of field-work and peace rather than the representative of war and slaughter. Hence the “agōn,” i.e. the actual “certamen,” is concluded. In the paragraphs following, a depiction is given of how each agonist died—Hesiod shamefully and disgracefully, Homer highly honored by all the Greeks. One could say much about the paradoxical awarding of the prize, but that has to be omitted here. After Nietzsche presents this text in a (for a 22-year-old student) remarkably precise, clear, and systematic form, he comes to his actual task: the source-analysis. Regardless of the many content-questions the text poses, Nietzsche indeed focuses narrowly only on the analysis of its sources, as he did with his works on Theognis and Diogenes Laertius. This analysis he did using traditional measures, as they were appropriate for contemporary philologists. Nietzsche is conducting pure text-philology—we must keep this in mind. Yet in this way, he does make a wholly new and impactful discovery: He takes a till-then often-overlooked source reference in §14 more carefully into focus for the first time. There the imperial-age compiler speaks of the murder of Hesiod by two young men in Lokris, who then decide to flee to Crete in a fishing vessel, only to be struck by Zeus’ lightning along the way and drown in the sea. In the following it says: “ὥς φησιν Ἀλκιδάμας ἐν Μουσείωι” [“as Alcidamas says in the Mouseion”] (“Certamen” §14). Nietzsche combines this with another observation: the first question Hesiod addresses to Homer in the “Certamen” itself reads: What is the best (ἄριστον) for men? And Homer answers: ἀρχὴν μὲν μὴ φῦναι ἐπιχθονίοισιν ἄριστον, φύντα δ᾽ ὅπως ὤκιστα πύλας Ἀΐδαο περῆσαι.\n\n9781472511522_txt_print.indd 14\n\n25/11/2013 13:30\n\nOn Nietzsche’s Philological Beginnings\n\n15\n\nTo not be born is the best for earth-dweller; having been born, however, to step through Hades’ gate as soon as possible. (“Certamen,” §7)\n\nHere Nietzsche remembers having read these two verses somewhere else before: in Stobaeus, the fifth-century composer of a four-volume collection of excerpts intended for the improvement of his son’s knowledge of literature and philosophy. In Volume 4, chapter 52.22, Stobaeus quotes the exact same two verses verbatim under the heading Περì τοῦ θανάτου [“On Death”]—however with additional information: Ἐκ τοῦ Ἀλκιδάμαντος Μουσείου [“From the Mouseion of Alcidamas”]. Nobody before Nietzsche had brought this in connection with the “Certamen.” Now Nietzsche has two corresponding source references—one at the end of the imperial text, the other with Stobaeus, but in reference to the central part of the imperial text, i.e. to the actual “agōn.” Nietzsche concludes that the imperial compiler’s main source at least had to be the Mouseion by the rhetorician Alkidamas, who is, from being mentioned and cited numerously, among others in Plato and Aristotle (Nietzsche lists the material), known as the pupil of the sophist Gorgias, and by whom one text has survived: “On the Authors of Written Speeches or on Sophists.” So much for the 1867 lecture as it concerns us here. (We can disregard further conclusions Nietzsche draws in the lecture; he later rejected them.) The paper was offered in July 1867, in Nietzsche’s fourth semester, and must have been received enthusiastically; for Nietzsche followed up the theme during the next months. During his sixth semester, on November 9, 1868, he suggests a book-collaboration to Rohde in Bonn, which was to contain also a text by him on the “Certamen.”17 It never came to fruition. However, just a month later, on December 9, 1868, he tells Rohde that he is planning on newly editing “the short text περì Ὁμήρου καì Ἡσιόδου καì γένους καì ἀγῶνος αὐτῶν” (so by now he knows the original title), which is to include a thesis on “questions on the transmission of Homer” (to Rohde, December 9, 1868; KSB 2, 349). By now he has also received (from Leiden) the handwritten transcription of the time by Stephanus from the Florentine Codex Laurentianus. So he is very much working towards an edition of the text. His philological precision is then also revealed by the fact that he wants also to have a collation of the text in the Stephanus edition and the handwritten original codex from Florence. Several attempts fail, but he does not give up. Lastly, Rohde, who is in Italy at the time, sends him the collation from Florence on September 24, 1869 (KSB 2, 49). Now, in his second semester at Basel, Nietzsche can conclude the planned critical edition. It is eventually published in 1871 as the first issue of the Acta Societatis Philologae Lipsiensis, edited by Ritschl. Whoever goes through this edition—mostly composed in Leipzig but concluded in Basel—thoroughly, will encounter a highly professional and acute 26-year-old editor. Nietzsche corrects Stephanus at various points, elucidates hard-to-read or unreadable passages, rearranges, makes conjectures, etc. The editing of a text is regarded as the supreme discipline within Classical Philology. It requires not only outstanding paleographic, linguistic, stylistic, and even (as we have here) metric understanding, but also profound knowledge of the environment of the author, his diction, his sources and his use of them, not to mention of the historical development of the literary genus\n\n9781472511522_txt_print.indd 15\n\n25/11/2013 13:30\n\n16\n\nNietzsche as a Scholar of Antiquity\n\nFigure 1.1 From Nietzsche’s “Certamen” edition, 1871.

Nietzsche fulfills all these preconditions remarkably, as a sample from his edition proves. We see a critical apparatus below the text, in the kind of form one can only wish for in editions today: Nietzsche does not only note the original manuscript (F for “Florentinus”), the manual transcription by Stephanus (S) and finally the printed “editio princeps” by Stephanus (E, for “Editio”), but also includes the corrections and conjectures by earlier scholars—often even noting down the place where they are made. He further notes his own corrections and conjectures, and, even as a 26-year-old, is not afraid to rebuke preceding opinions of established scholars: “Goettling inconsiderately [temere] conjectured either ‘Callimachus in the Mouseion’ or ‘Alkidamas in [his speech] Messeniakós’” (so to line 232); or: “the conjecture by Bernhardy ‘ἀστῶν,’ which Westermann has adopted, must be discarded completely [prorsus est reicienda]”; so to line 239 (Bernhardy, professor in Halle, was a distinguished 71-year-old great authority in the field at that time, especially with his “Grundriss der griechischen Litteratur” of 1836, 5th edn. 1875). Best of all: Nietzsche was right! We could list several more advantages of this edition. Two years later in the Rheinisches Museum (1873) Nietzsche judges his work self-confidently, but quite correctly: “In the new edition [...] I did not only aim at presenting the henceforth decisive critical apparatus, but also at the same time the history of the text” [my emphasis]. And he succeeded at that. At this point I briefly return to the initial question of this contribution: “How was Nietzsche’s early appointment to Basel at the age of 24 possible?” I think we see now what an outstanding philological mind had been formed there in Leipzig. In his letter of recommendation Ritschl wrote to Adolph Kiessling, at the time Latin professor in Basel, who had requested his resignation in Basel due to his appointment to the Johanneum in Hamburg and had asked Ritschl to recommend a successor, on December 9, 1868: [...] never before had I known a young man, who so early, at such a young age was so mature as Nietzsche. He wrote his Museum-essays in the second and third year of his academic triennium! [...] So I predict that he will one day be at the forefront of German philology [...]\n\nAt about the same time, also the Basel Greek Professor Wilhelm Vischer-Bilfinger, simultaneously Director of Education at the time, requested names of candidates for Kiessling’s succession from the very same Ritschl. Ritschl simply includes that letter to Kiessling he just had finished in his answer to Vischer, and requests of him to forward it to Kiessling subsequently. Vischer then copied the passage on Nietzsche by hand and used it in the following for his recommendations to the administration at Basel.18 Vischer also inquired for recommendations from Ritschl’s successor in Bonn, Hermann Usener, who on December 19, 1868 wrote: “Among the youngest generation F. Nietzsche stands out, whose works in the Rhein. Museum (vol. 22 and 23) astonish through their juvenile freshness and penetrating view” (Stroux 1925, 33f.). Let these remarks on the process of Nietzsche’s appointment suffice to show that Basel indeed made a fortunate choice.\n\n9781472511522_txt_print.indd 17\n\n25/11/2013 13:30\n\nNietzsche as a Scholar of Antiquity\n\n18\n\nA few closing words on the conclusion of Nietzsche’s “Certamen-research” before we come to the impact of Nietzsche in philology: In two essays in the Rheinisches Museum of 1870 and 1873 Nietzsche wrote what he had earlier called in a letter to Rohde the “subsequent elaborations on questions of the transmission of Homer.” In the first of these essays he presents with most precise arguments his discovery from the “Sängerkrieg auf Euboea” lecture of that time: the main source is Alkidamas.19 In the second essay, however, two highly consequential thoughts are added: First, that Alkidamas’ authorship of the “Certamen” comes as a result from Alkidamas’ general theory of rhetoric, as we know it from his text “On Sophists”: a pupil of Gorgias, Alkidamas always admired his teacher whenever he shouted to the public “Προβάλλετε” (“throw it to me!”, i.e. a topic), whereupon Gorgias would improvise freely but cleverly on that topic. As a student of such a speech-improviser, Alkidamas’ preference for improvised “free” speech over the memorized recitation of the written is only logical. (From today’s point of view, one should add that Alkidamas, and probably also Gorgias, must almost inevitably have placed themselves in the tradition of Homer in this respect, who in the Odyssey depicts himself as the character of the Phaeacian singer Demodocus, who was able the same way to sing about a topic upon receiving a shouted challenge [Odyssey 8, 487–98]; this would then explain the role of Homer as a master-improviser with Alkidamas.) Nietzsche’s second new thought is related to the title of Alkidamas’ work, in which the “Certamen” stood among other things: “Museion” (literally “place of the muses”). Calling on different parallels, Nietzsche explains the title as “school-” or “text-book,” namely of rhetoric. Most likely this is also correct: the museum as a place of gathering and teaching, just as later on the μουσεῖον of Alexandria.20 The final touch is added by the fact that Nietzsche’s thesis on Alkidamas was verified by two papyrus discoveries after his death. The 1891 discovery and publication of a third-century-bc papyrus from Egypt bears clear reference to the “Certamen”: The editor Mahaffy ends his edition with the following words: The text here recovered proves to demonstration that the Contest was not an invention of Hadrian’s age, but existed in much the same form four hundred years earlier. Its occurrence among the Fayyum papyri, where classical fragments are not very numerous, points to a widespread popularity. So far, then, the theory of Nietzsche has received the most brilliant confirmation. (Mahaffy 1891; my emphasis)\n\nThis first papyrus discovery then proved that the “Agōn” ran with very similar wording in the third century bc as with our imperial compiler. Thus the compiler must have drawn his “Certamen” from at least one Hellenistic source. In 1925 a second papyrus came to light;21 here the editor concludes: The first to discuss the relation of the Certamen to its source was F. Nietzsche, who advanced the theory that the Certamen was compiled in the age of Hadrian by a writer whose source was the Μουσεῖον of the rhetorician Alkidamas, the pupil of Gorgias and rival of Isocrates [... Now] we are warranted in asserting that Alkidiamas wrote an account, entitled Περì Ὁμήρου, which was the immediate\n\n9781472511522_txt_print.indd 18\n\n25/11/2013 13:30\n\nOn Nietzsche’s Philological Beginnings\n\n19\n\nsource of the end of the Certamen. So much is now fact, no longer theory. (Winter 1925)\n\nWith this, Nietzsche’s discovery was finally secured.\n\n4. The impact of Nietzsche’s youthful achievements on Classical Philology In conclusion, I offer a few words on the impact of the philological works from young Nietzsche’s work on Classical Philology. I start with a claim raised by the long-term editor of the “Gnomon,” Ernst Vogt, in his meritorious essay from 1962, “Nietzsche und der Wettkampf Homers.” It reads: [...] an insurmountable suspicion relentlessly accompanies also, and especially, his most brilliant insights and dazzling formulations. On the other hand, philology [...] gladly refers to Nietzsche as one of her great representatives, which she, with a sort of naive pride [...], regards as one of her own. (Vogt 1962, 103)\n\nSubsequently Vogt says that between the figure of Nietzsche and philology as a scientific discipline, two irreconcilable worlds meet. And this shall not hide the fact that Nietzsche had believed in the possibility of bringing his gradually forming thoughts and understandings to bear in the realm of professional philology for years—as was to be proven soon, a complete misapprehension of the actual situation. (Vogt 1962, 103)\n\nI do not want to join this view. First, on the supposed “insurmountable suspicion,” this view does not hold in this way. Let us stay with the example of the “Certamen.” During Nietzsche’s own time his relating research was only sporadically disputed; and Nietzsche refuted the few criticisms in the Rheinisches Museum of 1873 with patient philological meticulousness. Since then, both his method and his conclusions on the whole have been recognized. For one example: In his still-useful work “Geschichte der classischen Philologie in Deutschland von den Anfängen bis zur Gegenwart,” the expert philologist and archeologist Conrad Bursian claims: “In research on the sources used by Diogenes for the compilation of his work, a young philologist, [...] Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche, has made splendid achievements” (Bursian 1883, 929). He then adds in a note that the same scholar had produced “remarkable studies,” i.e. the 1870 and 1873 “Florentine tract on Homer and Hesiod, their ancestry and competition.” Bursian not only claims this, but within the same sentence expressly regrets (with the word “sadly”) that Nietzsche had to cease his university service at Basel in 1879 due to health reasons. Such praise, in an encompassing manual on the history of the discipline from a respected scholar, was weighty. Basically, only one classical philologist of rank expressed himself unfavorably concerning Nietzsche’s work on the “Certamen”: Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff. In his great “Die Ilias und Homer” (1916) he tried to portray the “Certamen” itself as an “old book of folk tales” and, as was to be expected, did not overlook the opportunity\n\n9781472511522_txt_print.indd 19\n\n25/11/2013 13:30\n\n20\n\nNietzsche as a Scholar of Antiquity\n\nof kicking afterwards against the already 16-years-dead Nietzsche—with the special but just therefore revealing insidiousness of not even mentioning Nietzsche by name. He claims that the Alkidamas discovery (by Nietzsche) is a “windy hypothesis,” and: “it is not worth wasting more words on such a figment” (Wilamowitz-Moellendorff 1916, 401). How objective we should take this judgment to be must be weighed against the fact that in his own “Certamen” edition (also published in 1916) Wilamowitz adopted at least four of Nietzsche’s conjectures, and here with the addition of mentioning him by name. These and further acuities of Nietzsche live on, even in the most recent “Certamen”-edition by Martin West (2003). And as for the words “not permitted” by Wilamowitz: other scholars did “waste” them on Nietzsche’s philological “figments.” Indeed, since the debate on the “Certamen,” with all its twists and turns, reaches into the present day, references to Nietzsche are in no way rare. Research on oral poetry and the question of improvisation has grown greatly, and hence we find in the “Reallexikon für Antike und Christentum,” for example, a reference to Nietzsche’s discovery (p. 1246) and in the entry on “Alcidamas d’ Élée” in the “Dictionnaire des Philosophes antiques” of 1989, where the entire history of research is summarized: “M.L. West 1967 [...] a confirmé [...] la thèse de Nietzsche, à la suite de E. Vogt 1959” (Goulet 1989, 105f.). And Johan Schloemann (today an editor of the Süddeutsche Zeitung), in his dissertation on improvisation-theory, claims, “this compiled text is rightly viewed as going back to Alkidamas since Nietzsche” (Schloemann 2001, 150). The appreciation of Nietzsche as a professional philologist has thus remained until today (cf. Latacz 2011, 17f.). So much for Nietzsche’s impact on particular areas of Classical Philology, in which his status is secure. We turn at last to address a much more important question: How did Nietzsche, as a philologist, affect Classical Philology tout court? Did The Birth of Tragedy really cause a complete rejection of Nietzsche in the discipline, as is usually claimed? I can only see the opposite. Wilamowitz is certainly not the whole of Classical Philology. In my Basel university speech of 1998, I did point out that, as long as Wilamowitz was alive (†1931), Nietzsche was ostracized from the field—not seldom with a sense of embarrassment—but that he afterwards (and not only incidentally after the tremors of the First World War) caused more and more thoughtfulness and eventually even enthusiasm with Wilamowitz’s own pupils (cf. Latacz 1998). People were sick and tired of the idolization of Wilamowitz’s micrological research; one no longer wanted to be the kind of “philological youth of Germany” invoked by Wilamowitz in his thunderbolt against Nietzsche in 1872, “which should learn by an asceticism of self-denying labor, to everywhere only seek the truth” (WilamowitzMoellendorff 1969 [1872], 55). Thus does Wilamowitz’s student Max Pohlenz write the outrageous sentence, clearly directed against Wilamowitz’s “house maid”-definition (following Stefan George) of Greek tragedy: “In contrast, Nietzsche’s indication of the Dionysian trait of Hellenism leads us to the character of tragedy. Because tragedy is in essence, not incidentally, connected to the cult of Dionysus and Dionysian ecstasy” (Pohlenz 1930, 8; my emphasis). And with another Wilamowitz student of the highest scholarly rank, Karl Reinhardt, Nietzsche becomes almost the exemplar of a new study of Hellenism, which wants to transcend the positivism of textual criticism, source study, etc. to a new “humanistic self-determination” which wants to penetrate to the\n\n9781472511522_txt_print.indd 20\n\n25/11/2013 13:30\n\nOn Nietzsche’s Philological Beginnings\n\n21\n\ndepths. Philology, according to Reinhardt in a lecture of 1942, became “toilsome” around 1900, like an “over-organized, idly running machine”—asceticism, performance of duties, enduring heroism. Reinhardt claims that Nietzsche ended this. He was the first to diagnose the rigor mortis of Classical Philology. And he ultimately got everything started, breathing a new life that now finds its way into Hellenistic studies.22 At this point we might remind ourselves of young Nietzsche’s distinction between “petty frog-blooded micrologists, who know of science nothing but bookish dust,” on the one hand—and the “philologist [...] with a free view and a fresh drive” on the other (BAW 5, 254). The rediscovery of Nietzsche continued after Reinhardt, the details of which I address elsewhere.23 Today, anyway, Classical Philology cannot be said to have forgotten Nietzsche, although the field no longer speaks of him in the high tone of the time of Stefan George, as Reinhardt does. She has turned into a science, which unites within herself methodological strictness, detailed exactness, and systematics on the one side, and, on the other, lively empathy with the essence of the classical works and an attempt to enliven one’s life thereby. Wilamowitz and Nietzsche are united in this.24 This was only possible because Nietzsche was not able to follow the planned path in Basel. He could not become a “frog-blooded micrologist” in Basel any more after the publication of The Birth of Tragedy, even if he had wanted to. For that book brought him existential disappointment. In a draft for a letter to the publisher Engelmann, Nietzsche claims to seek “to explain Greek tragedy in a totally new way,” in that he “for the time being [!] wants to refrain from any philological approach on the question and only wants to focus on the aesthetic problem” (to Engelmann, April 20, 1871; KSB 3, 193f.). He apparently wanted to provide the philological foundations, which he knew remarkably well, only afterwards.25 But it seemed more urgent to him back then—being under the pressure to justify himself professionally—to quickly publish a larger work which would cause a sensation (i.e. “in a completely new manner”).26 He believed also in achieving this through an entirely new form of presentation. Nietzsche let a new kind of mythical-vitalistic manner of speech take the place of the common scientific diction. But no one could understand this; it was all too fast. As far as one did not take the book seriously from the start, one felt overwhelmed, probably also besieged, downright disavowed. The 23-year-old Wilamowitz, with his almost brutal Junker-style attack,27 was not even decisive for this fact; he was not actually taken seriously either.28 It was far worse that a man like Ritschl, whom Nietzsche admired so much, proved to be so much disconcerted.29 And the experts generally—they cloaked themselves in silence.30 At this point Nietzsche’s old suspicion of not actually belonging in academic philology was all but certain. In Zarathustra it says “Of Scholars”: And when I lived with them, I did live above them. Thus they bore me ill will. They did not want to hear someone walking above their heads; and so they put wood and earth and dirt between me and their heads. Thus they deafened the sounds of my steps: and I have hitherto been heard least by the most learned. (Z scholars; KSA 4, 162)\n\nThe break had to happen. And so Basel became the place where Nietzsche experienced his crucial turn. The city had appointed a great philologist, and saw a great philologist\n\n9781472511522_txt_print.indd 21\n\n25/11/2013 13:30\n\n22\n\nNietzsche as a Scholar of Antiquity\n\nfail. But from this failure emerged a great thinker; a thinker who thought deeply about philology. Thus Basel in the end did become a fortunate case in philology. Translated by Philip Roth\n\nNotes 1\n\nWolf ’s student August Boeckh became the most important representative of this current; see Pfeiffer 1982, 222. 2 Even Sundays were no great exception, save for that there were no classes and the pupils only had to get up at 6 a.m. “Working hours” were, however, also required then, and these were only interrupted by prayers and morning church attendance. See BAW 1, 125f. 3 As an example, Landfester quotes from the biography of the then quite famous Leipzig classicist Gottfried Hermann. He indeed had a “freely creative” and “complete” command of Latin; however, of German only a “clear, simple and pithy” one. Landfester 1988, 97. Landfester is relying on Koechly 1874, 15. 4 “Latin. He has an excellent skillfulness in translating the classics and his written expression is also correct, clear and in good Latin, so that he, although the oral examination brought less opportune results, can nevertheless receive the grade ‘excellent’. He also shows quite good skills in speaking Latin” KGB I/4, 261; my emphasis. Nietzsche’s diploma is stored at the Goethe- and Schiller-Archive in Weimar. 5 Nietzsche was almost always at the top of his class. See letter to Franziska and Elisabeth Nietzsche, September 25, 1862; KGB I/4, 207f. 6 Here he wishes for Lachman 1851, Dronke 1861, and also for Schubert’s composition “Grand Duo à quatre mains.” 7 That he especially adored him is sufficiently known; these readings were nevertheless more a hobby. They never caused him to turn away from philology. 8 Nietzsche’s “discontent with philology” (which indeed is a discontent with the wrong philology of his time) reveals itself repeatedly and emphatically during his time as a student at university and will literally become a trauma after the “scandal” over GT. Nietzsche cannot free himself from traditional philology, but neither can he establish the “new and correct” philology he has in mind. Cf. now the more extensive Schwinge 2011, 246. 9 Quoted according to Hoppe and Schlechta 1938–42, I, 409. Montinari’s projected fourth KGB volume of “letters on Nietzsche (with life documents and occasional notes from Nietzsche’s manuscripts)” was a project sadly abandoned in 1993. See KGB I/1, v; KGB I/4, vi. 10 Nietzsche will later underline his “cleverness” more often; for example, in his application for the professorship of philosophy in Basel 1871, when he requests a change of chairs and recommends Erwin Rohde as his successor: “one should say about me, that I had the cleverest ideas to the benefit of friendship.” To Rohde, February 8, 1871; KSB 3, 183. 11 Ermanarich was a Germanic (Gothic) king (4th century). He plays a part also in Beowulf. 12 In the following I gratefully acknowledge the work of Ernst Vogt (1959; 1962), as well as his contribution to my Zweihundert Jahre Homer-Forschung, Rückblick\n\n9781472511522_txt_print.indd 22\n\n25/11/2013 13:30\n\nOn Nietzsche’s Philological Beginnings\n\n23\n\nund Ausblick (1991). Vogt’s earlier studies are now more than half a century old, though they still have not been acknowledged properly by philosophers or philologists working towards an understanding of Nietzsche’s intellectual development. An exception is Cancik [1995] 2000, 1–25. See also the hints in Latacz 2011, 1–25. 13 Differentiating, but not negating the “definite” is Latacz 2011, 18f. 14 “Der Sängerkrieg auf Euboea: Vortrag von Friedrich Nietzsche.” Found at BAW 3, 230–44. This work is not included in the KGW. The first specific mentioning of the planned lecture appears in spring 1868 under the heading “Themata meiner nächsten Arbeiten.” BAW 4, 123. Preliminary work on the planned “text with collation and commentary” as well as on the later “Certamen”-essays developed in the winter of 1868/1869. See BAW 4, 133–62, BAW 5, 168–71, 190–202, 212–17, 220–33. See also Karl Schlechta’s “Nachbericht” in his 1940, 439f. Already at that time Nietzsche gained the crucial insights for his understanding of the “Certamen.” See BAW 5, 170f., at right. 15 Nietzsche accurately corrected the name to “Polycaste” to reflect the name of Nestor’s daughter per Odyssey 3. 464f. 16 Hesiod, Ἔργα καì ἡμέραι, 646–60. 17 “[W]e will make a book together called Beiträge zur griechischen Litteraturgeschichte in which we will collect a couple of longer essays (e.g. the ones by me on Democritus’ authorship, on the Homeric-Hesiodic ἀγών, on the Cynic Menippus) and also include some miscellanea. What do you think of that?” To Rohde, November 9, 1868; KSB 2, 342. 18 See Stroux 1925, 29ff. The dates of some letters are not always accurate with Stroux; however, the time of December 1868/January 1869 is relevant here. 19 Thus, Nietzsche had already concluded that “the entire story in the ἀγών was from Alcidamas’ Museion.” BAW 5, 170f. 20 And like the periodical “Rheinisches Museum,” in which Nietzsche presents these insights—a nice little punchline, most likely not even noticed by Nietzsche. 21 For a discussion of this papyrus, see West 1967, 434–8. 22 Thus Reinhardt certifies the late success of Nietzsche’s life-long effort for a “new” philology. Reinhardt’s appraisal, and even admiration, of Nietzsche is contextualized in Latacz 1995, 50–3; see also Schwinge 2011, 287. 23 I have called some points to mind in Latacz 1998, 29–31. On Nietzsche’s impact (and on the Nietzsche cult) in and outside of Classical Studies, see Cancik 1995, 381–402. 24 Laid out extensively by Hölscher 1995, esp. 85. 25 See my 1998, 16–21. The concrete evidence developed on those pages (even for the development of the only seemingly external aspects “title of the book” and “titlepage-vignette” on the side) has apparently not made it into Nietzsche-research as of yet. Barbara von Reibnitz has repeatedly pointed out that Nietzsche already in his preliminary work on the final book “named references to other authors [...] or marked them as quotations – also here with significant exceptions from scientific works of predecessors”: Reibnitz 1992, 38; my emphasis. Reibnitz’s example is Müller 1857, as a text Nietzsche demonstrably used permanently. One would have to first consult the extensive list of scholarly literature which Nietzsche checked-out from libraries, especially the Basel University Library, prior to The Birth of Tragedy. Cf. Reibnitz 1992, 353–7. If one considers the noted draft of a letter to the publisher Engelmann, it becomes obvious that Nietzsche purposely suppressed his sources in the secondary literature of contemporary Classical Philology (a practice familiar\n\n9781472511522_txt_print.indd 23\n\n25/11/2013 13:30\n\nNietzsche as a Scholar of Antiquity\n\n24\n\n26\n\n27 28\n\n29\n\nto him from the preparation of his lectures in his first Basel years): “I wish that the text may be treated as a belles-lettres brochure [...] for this regard I favor a German typeface [he means the “Fraktur.”—JL] and namely a big German type, a big octavo format, with no more than 28–32 lines and above all—pretty paper.” To Engelmann, April 20, 1871; KSB 3, 194; only the italics are my emphasis. Something “completely new” (as he says to Engelmann), as it is symbolized in the “Prometheus bursting his chains” of the title-page vignette, was not allowed to have predecessors, of course (cf. Reinhardt 1942, 435). Research may forgive Nietzsche’s “cleverness,” of which he was himself so proud (see above), but it should not ignore it. In a long letter from January 1871 to Vischer-Bilfinger, Nietzsche applied for the vacant philosophy chair in Basel. It is therefore understandable strategically that he emphasizes his “philosophical tendencies” as a central interest in all of his works so far. “As long as I studied philology, I never grew tired of remaining closely attached to philosophy; indeed my main concerns were always with the philosophical questions.” To Vischer-Bilfinger, January, 1871; KSB 3, 176. This, however, is not reconcilable with the facts, as revealed in the “certificate of proficiency” contained in the letter: “I will soon be able to publicly show myself as sufficiently fit for the position as a philosophy teacher: my printed works on Laert. Diog. are to be asserted for my philosophic-historic ambitions [!] at any rate.” To Vischer-Bilfinger, January, 1871; KSB 3, 177. We showed above that just these works on Diogenes Laertius are purely philological source criticism. And as for “publicly showing himself as sufficiently fit” (he is referring to The Birth of Tragedy) a sentence from a letter to Rohde gives the enlightening commentary: “I also have to reveal and legitimate myself as somewhat philosophical in addition; a small work on the ‘Origin and Aim of Tragedy’ has been finished for that, except for a few strokes of the brush.” To Rohde, March 29, 1871; KSB 3, 189. So BT is foremost revealed as a piece of career writing, with a philological core and “philosophical” “brushstrokes.” Cancik’s carefully assessing judgment points in the same direction; see Cancik 2000, esp. 20f., 15, and 33. That the book would later—aside from its cult-book status outside of the discipline—contribute to a principal t"
