Wilamowitz-Möllendorf wrote a critique of Nietzsche's The Birth of Tragedy shortly after its publication in 1872. In the critique, Wilamowitz argues that Nietzsche's insights into Greek culture were not based on scholarly research but were influenced by Richard Wagner. Wilamowitz also criticizes Nietzsche's interpretations of Apollo and Dionysus as gods, as well as Nietzsche's view of Greek tragedy and Socrates. The critique aims to expose inconsistencies in Nietzsche's arguments and accusations of a lack of understanding of Greek literature, mythology, and culture.",
