        "text": "“During my time as the CEO of the start-up company Veramaris where we grew our team from two to fifty colleagues, Alexander was successful in supporting Veramaris human resource team to identify global talents, conduct initial pre-screening interviews, recommend a shortlist of candidates, and then support with final interviews and renumeration packages. Alexander supports the entire process diligently and is persistent in his follow-up with all parties to move towards completion of the job task with the best possible candidate. I recommend Alexander to support you in your recruitment of talented individuals for various functional roles throughout a dynamic organisation.”\n\n“As a company, we embarked on a very critical search that was pivotal to the transformation of our organisation. Alexander took the time to really listen, work with us on specific role detail, and also provided us some early one-on-one screening interviews to determine the type of candidate profile we were looking for. This approach allowed us to move quickly and gave us the exact candidate for the role. The experience was 5-star and I will definitely use AKP Resources for future hiring needs.”\n\n\"Alexander is an excellent collaboration partner. He has an in-depth knowledge of the aquaculture industry and has invested in understanding our business and talent strategy. We have built a long-term business relationship, where Alexander proactively searches for top talent across the world. His network enables us to get in contact with many very interesting prospects, ranging from talented graduates to senior management. At the same time, he is dedicated to facilitating a candidate experience which aligns with our company brand and purpose.\"\n\n\"As Director of Product Development & Innovation at a global feed additive producer, I have worked closely with Alexander Kennedy for a few years when we were recruiting additional technical staff. I especially appreciated Alexander's approach: He takes plenty of time understanding the expectations of the company for a potential new employee and the team this employee should fit in. Only when being fully informed does he start the search, with a clear focus on proposing suitable candidates to match. In our situation, Alexander succeeded doing so in all cases.\"\n\n“Alexander is a rare find. His approach to sourcing talent is handled with thoughtfulness, collaboration, and a high degree of professionalism. Compared to many others in his field, the candidate pool he identifies is not only on target regarding the job function but they also have a strong motivational fit. I look forward to the next project with him.”\n\n\"Alexander demonstrated a high level of professionalism during the entire recruitment process and demonstrates a clear understanding of the sectors he works across. He is mindful to find the right fit for the role - ensuring subject matter expertise, values, and purpose are aligned. Throughout the recruitment process he provided clear, timely communication and follow-up. I would highly recommend Alexander to those recruiting and those seeking their next professional move.\"\n\n“Alexander has a great intuition in matching the employer’s search for capable candidates and the employee’s search for great career opportunities. From our first contact on, he was very hands-on arranging online and offline interviews with Alltech, following-up the conversations and at the same time being very discrete and confidential. These are all great trademarks for a capable head-hunter. The fact that he’s specialized in the agricultural industry is naturally a big plus. Anyone who’s looking for new career opportunities or suitable candidates should definitely contact Alexander. Thank you again, Alexander, for the great introduction to the next chapter in my career.”\n\n“Alexander guided me through the hiring process with a high degree of professionalism and managed the role of being a facilitator between the company and myself very well. Alexander has knowledge about the sector and understands well what is required to get all involved over the goal line. I can strongly recommend Alexander.”\n\n“Alexander stood out from the very beginning of my hiring process. He is very familiar with the business environment and therefore asks the right questions. He has the ability to identify and extract the candidate’s values and find a match with the position requirements and company culture. His professionalism was present during the entire process, which was conducted in a transparent, ethical, and structured way.”\n\n“Alexander Kennedy has been super efficient when I was looking for a new job. The job opportunities, communication, and follow ups were very timely and precise. I would definitely consider and recommend to friends Alexander’s services when looking for a job or repositioning.”\n\n“Alexander brought me more than one opportunity that was relevant to my skill set. He was very helpful in helping me weigh the pros and cons of each opportunity. When I decided which job was the best fit for me he really helped me with the process over and beyond what other recruiters have done in the past. I would definitely recommend Alexander in your next career move.”"
