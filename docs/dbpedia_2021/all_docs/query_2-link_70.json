        "text": "CAMP HILL — Whether you were a close friend or casual acquaintance, those who met and came to know Grace Milliman Pollock recognized her vibrancy and passion for life.\n\nThese traits shone through as she lit up Broadway and famous venues worldwide.\n\nPaired with her penchant for caring and giving to others, Pollock had the makings of a remarkable woman, her friends and family said Wednesday during her funeral service.\n\n“She cared for and was fascinated by people,” said David McLane, a close friend and next door neighbor of Pollock for more than 30 years. “Everyone in our neighborhood was very fond of Gracie. In a sense, she brought us together as a unique and caring community.\"\n\nPollock died Friday at the age of 94. About 100 people attended her memorial service Wednesday and it was aptly held in the theater at the Grace Milliman Pollock Performing Arts Center on North 21st Street.\n\nPollock’s $15 million donation in 2006 paid for the arts center and its endowment. In a past video interview that played before the memorial, Pollock said creating the center was a way to “help broaden the minds and horizons of the community.”\n\nHer own life was full of experiences that did just that for her. Born as a twin in Seattle, she was the daughter of Loren and Grace Holcombe Milliman. Her father was a professor at the University of Washington.\n\nHer mother wrote musical comedies for the local church, where her father ministered and Pollock revealed that she would mimic the dances from the productions. That led to her start in ballet when she was 5.\n\nAt 16, Pollock left for New York and worked as a ballerina, performing in several Broadway shows. She later traveled to Europe, sharing meals and encounters with royalty and other famous people.\n\nShe also worked as a model and one photograph displayed at her memorial showed her in an advertisement for Chesterfield Cigarettes.\n\nPollock’s three granddaughters, Lauren Cacciamani, Courtney Gordon and Lindsay Burk, sat in the front row with other family at the memorial service and shared their memories of their grandmother.\n\nCacciamani recalled that her grandmother’s life experiences were so unique they could be mistaken for “fairy tales.”\n\nBurk said her grandmother preferred to correspond with letters and started the “Pollock Circulator” among herself and her grandchildren. Proper grammar was a must.\n\n“You were subject to a reprimand no matter who you were,” Burk said of Pollock.\n\nIn a tribute to her father, Pollock and her husband, the late S. Wilson Pollock, also gave $15 million to the University of Washington’s creative writing program. The donation was made so the school could support graduate students and attract award-winning writers as faculty.\n\nMolly Purrington, the university official tasked with keeping in touch with Pollock, came to be her good friend and flew in to attend Wednesday’s service. She recalled that whenever she introduced Pollock to others, she inevitably would have a series of questions for them. That included a meeting with former university president Mark Emmert, now the president of the NCAA.\n\nPollock’s casket was placed on the theater stage next to a portrait of her. Beautiful flowers filled the theater, and musical performances were featured in the memorial.\n\nThe Camp Hill High School/Middle School Ensemble sang “Amazing Grace” and a brass quartet played “When the Saints Go Marching In.” McLane sang a solo of “I’ll Walk With God.”\n\nRead Pollock's full obituary\n\n."
