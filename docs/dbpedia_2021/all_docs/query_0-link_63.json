        "text": "LINDSAY BARRETT: 1959 - 2023\n\nLindsay Barrett had a unique voice. It was one of the first things you noticed about him when you met, a gravelly voice, but warm: a rich accent with just a hint of Strine, subtly placing him in the St George country around Kogarah and Rockdale from whence he hailed. That voice was carried into his writing, and again, it was unique, adding something rich and new to Australian cultural history.\n\nWilliam Faulkner famously wrote: “The past is never dead. It’s not even past.” It needs to be understood and reintegrated into the present, and this was Lindsay’s life’s work. When you look at that work you understand how far the past, not just his own, but that of his father’s generation, entered his soul and made him write.\n\nWhile First Nations Australians are profoundly situated within layers of meaning carried by ancestors and Country, non-Indigenous Australians often struggle with an idea of place, or what it means to be in Australia. Because that meaning is complex, we are often sold, and indeed buy, overly simplified myths or stereotypes that reduce real people to caricature. Barrett understood the importance of linking imaginative understandings with scholarly analysis to allow us to feel the complexity of elements of Australian culture as they have unfolded and been transformed.\n\nLindsay Arthur Barrett was born in Sydney on September 22, 1959, the son of Arthur, a potter, and June Barrett (née Lindsay).\n\nHis best-known work is The Prime Minister’s Christmas Card, published in 2001 but still in print and selling well, particularly in the bookshop of the National Gallery of Australia where it allows patrons to inhabit the contexts of the Whitlam government’s controversial 1973 purchase of Jackson Pollock’s Blue poles. Lindsay takes us back to that moment and the competing ideas of identity and national potential that characterised it, helping us to understand that who we are is not fixed in place, but something we are continuously bringing into being.\n\nHis approach to cultural history can be summed up in his own words from his 2019 book New Year’s Day at the Hotel Australia. Here he examines one of the great periods of transformation in contemporary Australian history, the post-war period of economic boom and suburban expansion through to the 1960s. The framing device is a pledge his father, Arthur, made along with other apprentices working in Fowler’s Pottery in Marrickville in 1937: that they would all meet at the Long Bar of the Hotel Australia in the year 2000. As time passes, that famous hotel is demolished to make way for the MLC building and with it a particular cultural mode of being is extinguished, along with the potential for meaningful reunion.\n\nAt the beginning of his book Barrett writes: “I do not want to examine this period of our history in broad terms – the wide sweep of global economic transformation, and the international political realignments that both underpinned and resulted from these transformations – but from the point of view of the actual experience of such change: from ground level, from the point of view of these events that, schooner of Reschs in hand, one had from the Long Bar of the Hotel Australia.”\n\nSuch an idea, he shows us, requires imagination. The themes of New Year’s Day, which focus on a nuanced examination of the emergence of a certain kind of specifically male Australian identity within a suburban landscape, are further echoed in a work that will be published posthumously.\n\nA novel, called North, which draws upon Lindsay’s own story to follow a group of young men from the St George area in the early 1980s making car trips that take them further and further North. While it is a road novel, being in Lindsay’s voice (and you can hear it achingly present on every page) it leads us to profound and troubling questions about what the country we live in might be or become.\n\nLindsay was what Orson Welles called a “star turn”, meaning his reputation preceded him. When I went for a job back in the late 1990s at the University of Western Sydney my old friend, the novelist Tony Macris, told me I had no chance because one of the stars of UTS, Lindsay Barrett, was going to apply (as it turned out three of us were employed at the same time, so I sneaked in despite this).\n\nLindsay was part of a generation nurtured by Stephen Muecke, Amanda Lohrey and Noel Sanders at UTS that applied literary techniques to scholarly social analysis. But Lindsay was very much his own man. I still hear his voice when the highly distinguished leader of New Humanities team at UWS, Bob Hodge, asked Lindsay what slogan we should use to promote the new communications school we were now a part of. Perhaps interpreting this question as an appeal to dubious marketing, Lindsay looked his senior colleague in the eye and drawled, “Get Connected!” and Bob recoiled at the spicy pun.\n\nIn 2002 Lindsay was diagnosed with a rare heart condition, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C), which required an implanted defibrillator. His condition was unusual and often perplexed his cardiologist and head of cardiology at St Vincent’s Hospital, Dr Dennis Kuchar. Lindsay and Dennis developed a close friendship that transcended the conventional interactions between medical specialist and patient. Dennis was a doctor and an artist and known as an all-round ‘mensch’; Lindsay purchased one of Dennis’s paintings – an abstract depiction of a heart, of course. When Dennis died from motor neurone disease in 2022, Lindsay was devastated.\n\nIn the early years of his condition, Lindsay’s defibrillator frequently ‘misfired’, delivering a painful electrical charge that shocked the heart into a normal rhythm. One of these misfirings took place in Berlin, a city Lindsay loved and lived in for regular periods of time. It was in Berlin that he developed his research on the German explorer Ludwig Leichhardt, which in turn became the foundation for a large collaborative research network between Germany and Australia. Again, Lindsay’s research set out to uncover the story behind this most familiar of suburban names.\n\nLindsay was made to take early medical retirement from his academic position at Western Sydney University, but unbowed he continued to produce research and to write essays and books. He also lived fully, travelling widely with his beloved partner of many years, Fiona Allon, also a cultural critic of high standing.\n\nTheir son, Arthur, was born eight years ago after a long period of reproductive difficulties and use of assisted reproductive technology due to Lindsay and Fiona’s determination to ensure that he did not inherit his father’s genetic heart condition. Lindsay died of heart failure on October 27, 2023.\n\nOne image of his mischievous joy stays with me. He was a passionate supporter of his home club St George, and wrote about them. I was also a Dragons fan, and we went together to the 2010 Preliminary Final with the Dragons playing Wests Tigers. I brought my 10-year-old son Liam, who had adopted the West Tigers as his team, despite my urgings to the contrary. As St George scraped to victory, I remember Lindsay and I exchanging high-fives over Liam’s bowed and mournful head. I guess you had to be there … or had someone like Lindsay here to retell the story, to make you feel how it was cruel and sad and funny all at the same time.\n\nAnthony Uhlmann"
