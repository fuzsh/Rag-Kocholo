        "text": "A small town in Spain is finally embracing its Jewish history — but is any of that history true?\n\nIn Hervás, a rural hamlet of 4,000, an invented Jewish heritage has become a point of pride and a marketing tool\n\nOnce Suppressed, Composers Enjoy Revival\n\nJames Conlon, music director of Los Angeles Opera, and Marilyn Ziering, a Beverly Hills philanthropist, met for the first time only a year ago, but they have become fast friends. A common interest unites them: making sure that music suppressed by the Nazis and then largely forgotten — much of it by Jewish composers —…\n\nA Documentary Wrings Poetry From Politics\n\nAlmost as inevitable as the endless feature stories about the recent increase in political documentaries is the limpness of the films themselves. A strong documentary demands both surprising characters and a rich ethical imagination; make subjects’ impulses too obvious, as many of these films do, and you wind up with pamphleteering, pandering or Michael Moore….\n\nMarch 2, 2007\n\n100 Years Ago in the Forward Poor Annie Grossman, a young aguna, sits in her tiny room on Rivington Street on Manhattan’s Lower East Side, wondering what she’s going to do. One of the many bandits and charlatans that roam the Jewish quarter, preying on lonely young women, managed to swindle Annie out of $600…\n\n‘West Bank’ Musical Comedy Wins Oscar\n\n“West Bank Story,” a musical comedy about the eruption of love between an Israeli soldier and a Palestinian falafel-stand worker, won this year’s Academy Award for best live short. “To be able to get this award just goes to show that there are so many people out there that support that notion that when it…\n\nWarhol’s Tribe\n\nThis week marks the 20th anniversary of the death of Andy Warhol — as good a time as any to reminisce, in these pages, about the famed artist’s place in Jewish history. Although Warhol is best known for his portraits of such pop icons as Elvis Presley and Jackie Kennedy, in 1980 he also completed…\n\nKissing and Telling\n\nThe Great Kisser By David Evanier Rager Media, Inc. 179 pages, $24.95 Though David Evanier should best be known as a writer of stories that feign to punch and kick in the upstart manner of their Chosen People, he also traffics in the ethnicities of others, having authored nonfiction volumes on singers Bobby Darin and…\n\nOur Dueling Playwright\n\nThis month, Theater for a New Audience, a New York City-based theater that is committed to the canon of world dramatic literature, offers a series of free staged readings of four plays concerned with the issue of Jewish otherness in western society. Three of the plays are by well-known English-language writers: Arnold Wesker (“Shylock”), A.R….\n\nTwo Soldiers, Lonely Together\n\nFor some young Israelis, the idea of army service still holds romantic possibility: serving one’s country with the promise of adventure, and the opportunity to discover one’s self far from home. The reality is often quite different, with drudgery and endless repetition of dull tasks the markers of another day in the Israel Defense Forces….\n\nBeing a Jew Among the Genteel and Gentile\n\nMatters of Honor By Louis Begley Knopf, 320 pages, $24.95. The ordeal of civility, as defined by sociologist John Murray Cuddihy in his 1974 book, is “the ritually unconsummated courtship of Gentile and Jew.” This phenomenon is a recurrent theme throughout the fiction of Louis Begley. Even more than in his first novel — “Wartime…\n\nGerman Book Redefines ‘Victimhood,’ Problematically\n\nThe Fire: The Bombing of Germany, 1940-1945 By Jörg Friedrich Columbia University Press, 552 pages, $34.95. In the aftermath of World War II, Germany attempted to come to terms with the Holocaust. But ultranationalists were not contrite about the recent past, and contended that the killing of hundreds of thousands of German civilians during the…\n\nFebruary 23, 2007\n\n100 Years Ago In the Forward With threats by a Russian antisemitic group, the Black Hundreds, to drown the Duma in Jewish blood, the situation for Jews in Russia is steadily worsening. In Odessa, for example, it has never been more dangerous for Jews to be seen in the street by themselves. Nearly all the…"
