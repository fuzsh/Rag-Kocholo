        "text": "I read Lindsay Pollock’s biography on Edith Halpert, The Girl with the Gallery, about 10 years ago. I was interning at the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the Brooklyn Museum at the time and was specifically on the hunt for stories about women in the art world. Then I started working at the Jewish Museum, and filed it away for later. Before long, I found myself working alongside Mason Klein on an exhibition about the visionary cosmetics entrepreneur and art collector Helena Rubinstein. “Beauty Is Power” opened in 2014, and it explored the “Madame’s” world, and her early interest in European modernism and African art.\n\nThat’s when I began to think back to Edith Halpert. Like Rubinstein, she had an incredible eye, and saw beauty where others hadn’t thought to look. In Halpert’s case, that meant American Modernism, African American art, and folk art. Both were Jewish emigres who had an extraordinary cultural impact here in America, but then—like so many women—were forgotten over time."
