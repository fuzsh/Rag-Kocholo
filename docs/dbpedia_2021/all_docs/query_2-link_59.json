        "text": "By Lindsay Pollock, artist at PositiveNegatives\n\nAt PositiveNegatives, we create comics and animations about contemporary human rights issues, based on the testimonies of real individuals.\n\nWe are constantly inspired by their stories of courage and resilience from Almaz, a young Ethiopian woman who suffered horrific abuse as a maid in Saudi Arabia to activist Julius who grew up as in intersex person in Uganda.\n\nBut there are many comic book artists and illustrators who we look for inspiration and whose work has helped us tell the stories of these individuals better, so we wanted to share some of those with you.\n\nThese were picked by our artist Lindsay Pollock and we will leave him to tell you more.\n\nJoe Sacco, The Great War.\n\n“It’s a huge long tableaux laid out like the Bayeux tapestry showing the progress of soldiers from home-front through the horrific grind of a World War One battlefield. It’s a magnificent single picture, which depicts literally thousands of little figures all engaged in mounting this collective act of grotesque and futile destruction. By drawing an unbroken image, Sacco makes a wonderful, complete statement about the war. You can’t isolate any part of it from the whole. You might be able to find examples of heroism, courage or pride in the image, but they cannot be divorced from the dreary gory drudge which dominates the picture.\n\n“So, the form of the picture has a lot to say, a lot to make you think. But to achieve that, Sacco had to make an amazing technical achievement of drawing, so much and so precisely, and so well-researched, finding source images for every uniform, field, vehicle, farm house, weapon. All of this takes time, and Joe Sacco managed to make the drawing beautiful too, in the tidy detailed way he has. I’ve definitely been trying to emulate some of these qualities in my work on Sri Lanka and other projects.”\n\n2. Chris Ware, the Rusty Brown stories, in particular the Dogs of Mars story\n\n“Chris Ware’s books tend to work a different way; lots and lots of panels. Lots of juxtapositions. Almost a diagrammatic approach to comics, trying to express observations and ideas and truths and emotions all through juxtaposition and arrangement on a page. His comics are dense and complicated and by trying to describe what makes them special, you can really kill it dead. It’s hard to do justice.\n\n“But I like the way his pages have the quality of someone thinking about a subject from many angles. Sometimes he takes small, short moments and breaks them down — in minute detail — into several panels. Just to get at the subtlety of a moment. Other times he’ll bring together two pictures on a page showing perhaps, one single place but at points 50 years apart.\n\n“I definitely was inspired by him when I did the Almaz strip. The two pages where she’s doing her chores as a domestic worker in Saudi Arabia, and it’s juxtaposed with her mother, far away home and thinking of her — those were certainly under his influence.”\n\n3. Raymond Briggs, When the Wind Blows\n\n“The other artist who inspires my work is Raymond Briggs. He wrote the Snowman; perhaps more pertinent to PositiveNegatives, he wrote When the Wind Blows, about an old English couple trying to keep their spirits up as they are slowly dying from radiation poisoning after a nuclear bomb.\n\n“Raymond Brigg’s work is perhaps closest to what PositiveNegatives generally aspires to. In that book, he took a huge, politically charged and complex subject and homed right in on a human story as the prism to examine it. His work cut through the subject and confronted the reader with a stark dose of pure, moral, empathetic reality.\n\n“By having the protagonists be aged and remembering how they managed to ‘keep smiling through’ the Second World War, he subtly frames the full horror of a nuclear war; there’s no heroics, or camaraderie — or survivors — in the nuclear winter. Whatever nobility or dignity we might have managed to invest in the WW2 story, there’s nothing comparable coming, to redeem the story of this sweet old couple. It’s just tawdry and upsetting, simultaneously getting to know these characters; getting to like them; and watching them slowly die. It feels like witnessing a murder, because that’s exactly what it’s about.\n\n“That book is devastating, and like all Brigg’s work, it’s superficially very straightforward. No flashy page layouts, understated and calm drawing. But it’s careful drawing too, full of detail and specificity and crucially, warm. I try to draw like Briggs does because his people are squashy and relatable and feel real. And with all the work at Positive Negatives, we’re trying to convey to the reader that there are real people behind every story, who we have sat with and interviewed, and who have entrusted us with delivering their story to an audience.”"
