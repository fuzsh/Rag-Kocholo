        "text": "Written by Emma S, Business Admin ’22\n\nCollege is tough. Students over the span of these couple years are trying to figure out what they are passionate about and what they are good at. On top of trying to graduate, students are reminded of the burning question: what do I want to do with my major or even what can I do with my major? As an undergraduate soon to be Accounting or Operations of Technology Management, I am often worried about what will happen if I choose to do one major over the other. How will this affect my career? If I get a degree in accounting does that mean I have to be an accountant for the rest of my life? I know many of my fellow classmates and friends often feel this type of limitation when it comes to career exploration because of the misconception that your career must directly relate to your major. Getting from College to Career by Lindsey Pollak explains why it is okay to fear those questions. Students are primarily focused on trying to get a good GPA, not what they can use it for. Whether you are trying to figure out if your major is right for you or, what you want to do after you graduate, this book lays out tips and tricks to make this transition from college to career a bit easier.\n\nThere is a big misconception about majors in college – your major does not limit your career search. This should be a sigh of relief. As I’ve learned through the business school, it may be harder to pass your CPA exam for the first time with an Economics degree but with the right resources and mentors, anything is possible. In the book, Lindsey Pollack lays down 90 tips for success. She includes check in points and goal markers along the way to help guide her readers through the job searching process. Pollak covers big topics including how to interview, how to network, to even smaller topics including how to write a professional email to future employers. Pollak understands that maybe your major isn’t exactly what you see yourself doing and, reminds her reader that there are options that can help you explore new opportunities even after you graduate.\n\nThis book helps you feel not alone in the career search process, and that it is okay to not know what you want to do right away. Getting from College to Career by Lindsay Pollak lists outside resources at the end of the book to give her readers outside connections and resources while they embark on this journey to work towards their career. As online community continues to rapidly grow, I think a great take away from this book is the reminder to always be conscious about what comes up when you google search your name. As Pollak reminded her readers that around 70% of employers say they do look up future employees online, it is always smart to keep your name as professional as you can online!"
