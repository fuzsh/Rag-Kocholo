        "text": "Logo Design\n\nThere’s no better feeling than helping someone bring their brand to life with a logo and identity system that is beautiful in both function and form- something that provides emotional connection, excitement, and a joy for the eyes. Since 2007, I’ve been working with clients and companies of all sizes with varying backgrounds. Below are several examples of identity design in ecommerce, cannabis, real estate, tech, and science.\n\nSENNé\n\nA boutique real estate company based out of Cambridge MA looking to take over the industry. They wanted an identity that was upscale yet understated and approachable. The logo mark uses negative space and lines to create a building. The typeface has a classic appeal in its serif form.\n\nPOInt Plus rentals\n\nThe sister brand to Senné, (which has been absorbed by it’s family memeber—RIP!). But before that happened, we had the more modern, youthful, and fun brand oriented toward the successful rental market in Cambridge. A piece of the Senné mark was taken and used to create the roofline shape.\n\nHENDO HOVER\n\nHendo hover created real life hoverboards (hand to god). I wanted to show an element of hover movement and the “e” lent itself nicely to that.\n\nDigital transformers\n\nThis mark is for Salsify’s education brand. The desire was to create something akin to a superhero mark. Salsify helps their customers learn how to succeed and feel on top of the world when it comes to selling their products on retailer sites.\n\nFIELD App\n\nAn app that safely connects growers and cutters in the Cannabis industry. The mark is a combo of “F’s\" as well as a woven texture, symbolizing working together to create a whole."
