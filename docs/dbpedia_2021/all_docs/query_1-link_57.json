        "text": "I’m very interested in human rights and advocating for immigrant justice. I went to law school in DC and since then I moved to Chicago. I was an asylum officer for the government so I adjudicated asylum applications. I love the intellectual side of learning about a client’s work. I focus on learning the industry and the background of my client’s career. I do a lot of biomedical research cases, so I actually learn about the science so I can explain why my client is great at their job.\n\nI also work with educators, community activists, priests, and artists in all types of industries. So I get to learn about topics that I didn’t study in school. I also love the moment when we get an approval from the government and I get to tell my clients that we’ve won.\n\nMy name is Lindsay Fullerton and I’m a senior immigration attorney at Scott D. Pollock & Associates, P.C.\n\nView Similar Articles"
