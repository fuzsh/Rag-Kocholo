        "text": "The Pollack Family Foundation was founded by former University of Georgia and Cincinnati Bengals football player, David Pollack and wife Lindsey, together with their children.\n\nThe Pollack Family Foundation was initially founded with the desire to educate and encourage individuals, families and communities on the benefits of nutrition and exercise with a focus of raising awareness about childhood obesity.\n\nOver the last couple of years the Pollacks, through prayer and discernment, felt led to shift directions as a foundation with a desire to make an eternal impact.\n\nCurrently, The Pollack Family Foundation is completing a re-branding season as we transition from a focus of 'raising awareness about childhood obesity' to an expanded reach of 'empowering families’ by providing for basic needs and fundamental care as we invest in opportunities to encourage 'Faith. Family. Community.' throughout the Athens, Georgia community and the Greater Atlanta area.\n\nThe Pollack Family Foundation’s prominent fundraising event, our Annual Celebrity Golf Classic benefiting Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, will continue to fund our long standing partnership with CHOA and their Strong4Life program.\n\nAs part of the foundation's new direction, we recently held our Inaugural Couples for a Cause fundraising event, and we continue to explore additional fundraising ideas to support our vision of ‘thriving communities and strong families’ through our family and community initiatives in the Athens, Georgia community and Greater Atlanta area including Hope 139, Extra Special People and The Salvation Army.\n\nA follower of Christ, husband and dad of two.\n\nDavid, who was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey, and raised in Snellville, Georgia, now resides in the Greater Athens area with his wife Lindsey and their kids, Nicholas and Leah.\n\nAs a defensive end at the University of Georgia, David was just the second Bulldog to be named a three-time All-American (Herschel Walker). David’s collegiate accolades include the 2002 SEC Player of the Year honors, the 2003 and 2004 Ted Hendricks Award, and, in 2004, the Chuck Bednarik Award, Lombardi Award, Lott Trophy and SEC Defensive Player of the Year. David’s 36 sacks for the Bulldogs remain a school record.\n\nIn the 2005 NFL Draft, David was a first-round pick of the Cincinnati Bengals selected 17th overall. David's NFL career was cut short after he broke a cervical vertebra versus the Cleveland Browns in the second game of his second season. Prior to the 2008 season the Cincinnati Bengals announced Pollack’s retirement.\n\nIn 2008, David transitioned to the field of sports broadcasting, where he co-hosted a sports talk radio show on 790 The Zone in Atlanta. In 2009, David joined ESPN contributing his college football knowledge to several of the network’s programs, including ESPN's College GameDay starting in 2011, as well as College Football Live, SportsCenter and ESPN's Bowl and College Football Playoffs and National Championship coverage.\n\nDavid and his wife along with their two children launched The Pollack Family Foundation in 2016, with a current focus on Faith. Family. Community.\n\nIn 2020, David was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.\n\nDavid along with his pastor, launched the Family Goals Podcast in 2021 with a focus on Faith. Family. Sports. & More.\n\nIn 2022, David was inducted into the Georgia High School Football Hall of Fame’s inaugural class."
