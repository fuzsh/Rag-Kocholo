        "text": "Journalist Pollock's sound, informative first book pursues the success story of a Russian émigré who translated her failure to become a painter into a lively business making American art worthy of view and sale.\n\nEdith Halpert née Fivoosiovitch (1900–70) was in her mid-20s when she opened the first “modern-era art gallery in Greenwich Village,” at 113 West 13th Street, in 1926. The daughter of Russian immigrants who fled Odessa after pogroms in 1906, Halpert aimed to become a painter, but found more success with her business sense, working her way up at Bloomingdale's, Macy's and S.W. Straus. Married to the older painter Sam Halpert, whom she largely supported, Edith hit on the idea that she could use her business skills as well as immerse herself in the artistic milieu by starting up a much-needed gallery space in the bohemian area where all the artists lived—Greenwich Village—rather than uptown with the other galleries. Operating on a consignment basis, she eschewed the popular Europeans and gathered around her a coterie of American modernists such as Stuart Davis, William and Marguerite Zorach, Leon Kroll, Max Weber, Charles Sheeler, Bernard Karfiol, George Ault and her husband. Her Downtown Gallery, situated both down- and uptown over the following three decades, enhanced art reputations and attracted the wealthy ally and munificent buyer Abby Aldrich Rockefeller. Halpert’s work lining up artists for the new Rockefeller Center is little acknowledged, as are her early shows for African-American artists like Jacob Lawrence. In this polished work, Pollock emphasizes Halpert's steely business mind and her unflagging commitment to bringing art to “Mr. and Mrs. America.”\n\nA significant contribution to American beaux arts.\n\nThe authors have created a sort of anti-Book of Virtues in this encyclopedic compendium of the ways and means of power.\n\nEveryone wants power and everyone is in a constant duplicitous game to gain more power at the expense of others, according to Greene, a screenwriter and former editor at Esquire (Elffers, a book packager, designed the volume, with its attractive marginalia). We live today as courtiers once did in royal courts: we must appear civil while attempting to crush all those around us. This power game can be played well or poorly, and in these 48 laws culled from the history and wisdom of the world’s greatest power players are the rules that must be followed to win. These laws boil down to being as ruthless, selfish, manipulative, and deceitful as possible. Each law, however, gets its own chapter: “Conceal Your Intentions,” “Always Say Less Than Necessary,” “Pose as a Friend, Work as a Spy,” and so on. Each chapter is conveniently broken down into sections on what happened to those who transgressed or observed the particular law, the key elements in this law, and ways to defensively reverse this law when it’s used against you. Quotations in the margins amplify the lesson being taught. While compelling in the way an auto accident might be, the book is simply nonsense. Rules often contradict each other. We are told, for instance, to “be conspicuous at all cost,” then told to “behave like others.” More seriously, Greene never really defines “power,” and he merely asserts, rather than offers evidence for, the Hobbesian world of all against all in which he insists we live. The world may be like this at times, but often it isn’t. To ask why this is so would be a far more useful project.\n\nIf the authors are serious, this is a silly, distasteful book. If they are not, it’s a brilliant satire.\n\nThe excruciating story of a young man on a quest for knowledge and experience, a search that eventually cooked his goose, told with the flair of a seasoned investigative reporter by Outside magazine contributing editor Krakauer (Eiger Dreams, 1990).\n\nChris McCandless loved the road, the unadorned life, the Tolstoyan call to asceticism. After graduating college, he took off on another of his long destinationless journeys, this time cutting all contact with his family and changing his name to Alex Supertramp. He was a gent of strong opinions, and he shared them with those he met: \"You must lose your inclination for monotonous security and adopt a helter-skelter style of life''; \"be nomadic.'' Ultimately, in 1992, his terms got him into mortal trouble when he ran up against something—the Alaskan wild—that didn't give a hoot about Supertramp's worldview; his decomposed corpse was found 16 weeks after he entered the bush. Many people felt McCandless was just a hubris-laden jerk with a death wish (he had discarded his map before going into the wild and brought no food but a bag of rice). Krakauer thought not. Admitting an interest that bordered on obsession, he dug deep into McCandless's life. He found a willful, reckless, moody boyhood; an ugly little secret that sundered the relationship between father and son; a moral absolutism that agitated the young man's soul and drove him to extremes; but he was no more a nutcase than other pilgrims. Writing in supple, electric prose, Krakauer tries to make sense of McCandless (while scrupulously avoiding off-the-rack psychoanalysis): his risky behavior and the rites associated with it, his asceticism, his love of wide open spaces, the flights of his soul.\n\nA wonderful page-turner written with humility, immediacy, and great style. Nothing came cheap and easy to McCandless, nor will it to readers of Krakauer's narrative. (4 maps) (First printing of 35,000; author tour)"
