She begins her new role on May 7, after which she will be in charge of the museum’s strategies related to digital media, communications, and graphic design.\n\nPollock was the editor-in-chief of Art in America from 2011 to 2017. Prior to that, she had written for Bloomberg, the Art Newspaper, and the New York Sun, and had held marketing positions at Sotheby’s and the Central Park Conservancy. She is the author of The Girl with the Gallery, a biography of the dealer Edith Halpert.\n\nAdam Weinberg, the Whitney’s director, said in a statement, “Lindsay has long standing relationships and expertise in the art world as well as a deep appreciation for the Whitney’s mission and ethos. She will bring a creative spirit and fresh perspective to the areas she’ll be overseeing.”"
