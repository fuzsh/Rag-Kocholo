        "text": "Lindsay Jayne Pollock (Guy) I was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland in 1990. Mother to three young children who keep me busy most days but when I'm not with them, I am a customer advisor at my part-time job in Three UK. I enjoy writing children's stories and poetry. Zilly Zebra was my first self published book which I worked on with my brother Gareth. I hope to release many more and currently have a few in the pipeline.\n\nRead full bio"
