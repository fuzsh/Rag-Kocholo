        "text": "The Trump administration’s Department of Justice immigration policy of separating children from their families is an assault on the rights of asylum-seekers. It’s not illegal to come to the U.S. to seek asylum, but although they come to the U.S. and expect to follow a lawful procedure, they have instead been incarcerated or turned away. Attorney Scott Pollock speaks more about this policy and its ramifications with WCPT-820.\n\nView Similar Articles"
