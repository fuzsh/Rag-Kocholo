Brant Publications has named art journalist and author Lindsay Pollock as editor-in-chief of Art in America. Pollock succeeds Marcia E. Vetrocq, who served as editor from 2008 to 2011 and Elizabeth C. Baker, who was editor from 1974 to 2008.

“Lindsay is among the most respected art journalists in New York, and we look forward to having her build on our strong foundation,” said Peter Brant, chairman of Brant Publications. “She brings a dynamic news sense and experience with web-based arts coverage that will enhance our publications and platforms.”

Pollock has covered the arts at Bloomberg since 2005, breaking news and focusing on the art market and the business of art. She has also contributed to the Art Newspaper since 2004, writing in-depth analysis on art auctions, international art fairs, U.S. art news as well as a monthly column. In 2009, she founded Art Market Views, a blog covering art industry news and trends. In 2006 she published The Girl with the Gallery, the only biography of pioneer art dealer Edith Halpert, who founded the Downtown Gallery in 1926 in Greenwich Village. Pollock has also previously written for such other publications as Bloomberg BusinessWeek, ARTnews, Art & Auction, and the New York Sun.
