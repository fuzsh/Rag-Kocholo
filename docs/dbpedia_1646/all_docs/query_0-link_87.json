        "text": "FRANCES JOAN SINGLETON\n\nPIANIST AND ACCOMPANIST: A PERFECT WONDER\n\nThis account is based on Joan Singleton’s personal papers and from what is currently available on the internet about her and her contemporaries. Her personal papers cover the period from 1905 to 1940 in detail and consist of letters, reviews of concerts, and programmes. Thereafter there are occasional newspaper articles about her. Unfortunately, many of the reviews of her concerts are undated and there is no way of knowing how completely they represent her career.\n\nThe title, Pianist and Accompanist: A Perfect Wonder comes from an undated description of Joan Singleton’s playing at a Glasgow Music Festival by Harry Plunket Greene:\n\nMiss Singleton yesterday was a perfect wonder. A whole heap of baritones were bad musicians and kept coming in where they liked, and skipping half bars and putting in others. She covered up their tracks and kept the whole thing alive in a way that was just genius besides playing the music quite brilliantly. She was wonderful. H. P. G.\n\nMichael Slaytor\n\nGreenwich\n\nJuly 2012\n\nJoan Singleton in 1935 at the peak of her career (photograph from her passport).\n\nFrances Joan Singleton was the second of four daughters of the Rev. James Sydenham Fowke Singleton and his wife Mary Norman. She was born at The Vicarage[1] in Theale in Somerset in 1886 and, with her sisters, educated at the High School in Wells. To her nieces, the daughters of her sister Marion Routh Clarke, she was known as AJ (Aunt Joan).[2] Joan Singleton was a professional pianist and an accomplished organist. She was a tiny lady who had gone into black at the age of 30 (because she thought it slimming) and wore no other colour thereafter.\n\nMarion and Joan Singleton photographed in Wells, Somerset, and Joan Singleton (photographed by the Eastern Daily Press, Norwich) as she was in about 1960.\n\nShe was godmother to her niece Prue Routh Clarke and her great niece Petrina Neal. She was warm and generous and alarmingly eccentric. In 1961, when I first met her, she would either turn up at Wattlefield Hall, Wymondham in Norfolk (the home of her sister Marion Routh Clarke) unannounced, or not arrive when expected. Similarly, it was never known if she would play the organ or engage in whatever musical activities her sister had arranged and expected her sister’s cooperation. This made planning rather difficult and her sister very cross. There is a description of her at this time which captures her in old age:[3]\n\n[The] accompanist was Mrs [sic] Joan Singleton, a little lady dressed all in black with a black hat, she didn’t look the part but she was a professional accompanist in the London Musical World and could make the piano talk and, because of connections, was prepared to come to Norfolk to play for us for many years.\n\nShe returned to Somerset after leaving Leipzig in 1908 and went to Scotland in about 1910 where she lived and worked until she moved back to London, as an established accompanist, in 1924.\n\nThroughout her career she used her professional expertise as pianist, organist and festival accompanist to help her sister, Marion Routh Clarke, run Norfolk Women’s Institute choirs in Spooner Row, Wymondham, and Hethersett. These choirs competed in the Norwich Musical Competition Festivals where they were invariably successful throughout the 1930s and 1940s.[4]\n\nMarion Routh Clarke (front row with baton) and Joan Singleton (on her left) with one of Marion Routh Clarke’s Women’s Institute choirs in 1937. They had been competing in the Norfolk Musical Competition Festival (photograph from the Eastern Daily Press, Norwich).\n\nFor much of the war she lived at Wattlefield Hall. Her niece, Prue Neal (née Routh Clarke), who was also then living at Wattlefield Hall with her children, remembers her aunt as always wearing a hat and cooking non-stop for the farm workers. Among Joan Singleton’s papers is a grim reminder of the war years,[5] a Memorandum (No. 38) from the Board of Education entitled Catering for Harvest Camps. The menu from Day 13 gives a flavour:\n\nBreakfast: Porridge, Fried Fish and Potatoes; Marmalade, Bread, Tea\n\n11 A. M. (packed): Bread and Cheese\n\nLuncheon (packed): Egg Pasties, Carrot and Cabbage Sandwiches\n\nTea (packed): Flapjack\n\nDinner: Fish and Cheese Pie, Cauliflower or Greens, Jam Sponge Pudding.\n\nSupper: Only if required\n\nA drawing by Prue Neal, Joan Singleton’s niece and goddaughter, entertaining curates from Wymondham Abbey at Wattlefield Hall during the Second World War. In the 1960s, one curate from the Abbey was called Mr Pagan and another Mr Bliss.\n\nShe also played for the Wymondham, Hethersett and Spooner Row W. I. Choirs with the cellist Muriel Taylor from the Robert Masters Piano Quartet;[6] she gave a solo recital at Wymondham Abbey to celebrate the 850th anniversary of the founding of the Abbey.[7]\n\nA souvenir from Germany.\n\nThere is a short diary outlining three visits to the Continent in 1925 and 1927. In August and September 1925, apart from normal sightseeing, there were operas and concerts. She went with Anna[8] to Prague, Munich where she saw (21 August) Cosi fan tutte with Richard Strauss conducting (‘an outstanding and wholly satisfying performance’), Don Juan, with Richard Tauber, Richard Mayr and Maria Nemeth, the next night (‘under Böhm, first rate cast. Lovely performance’), then (24 August) Il Seraglio (no comments) and finally (25 August) Parsifal at the Prinz Regenten Theater. In Salzburg (27 August) she went to Le Nozze di Figaro at the Stadt Theater (‘good little performance but judged by Cosi, only 3rd rate. Audience disappointing, both in size and behaviour’); the next night there was a concert with the Vienna Philharmonic under Bruno Walter and Rudolf Serkin with Haydn, a Mozart piano concerto and Brahms Op. 73 (‘Oh, what a programme and what a performance! Simply great, outstanding performance. Big audience and a big damp hall’). On August 29 there was Don Pasquale with Bruno Walter as Dirigent (‘such a bright and amusing performance with a better behaved audience tho’ still too anxious to clap and fidget’). The next night there was another orchestral concert, this time at the Riding School with Karl Muck[9] conducting. The programme was Mozart G moll [symphony], and the Beethoven Eroica symphony (‘tremendous audience and reception for Carl Muck, [who] looked quite unmoved by it all.’). The last concert was on 31 August under [Franz] Schalk;[10] with the Schubert Unfinished and Bruckner VIII. There were then a few days sightseeing in Innsbruck and then Paris where they saw Manon at l’Opéra Comique (6 September) (‘glad to be there but oh!… well music and manners don’t begin to compare with Mozart’).\n\nIn March 1927 Joan Singleton went to Vienna and Berlin for the Beethoven centenary celebrations. In Vienna these were held 26-31 March. Among her papers are programmes for: the Missa Solemnis (27 March; 12 noon) with the Vienna Philharmonic conducted by Franz Schalk with Elisabeth Schumann and Richard Mayr among the soloists; in the evening (7 p.m.) there was an ‘evening of historical opera’ (Dido and Aeneas, La Serva Padrona and a Rameau Ballet); a chamber music concert (28 March); the Vienna Philharmonic conducted by Felix Weingartner[11] and Pablo Casals with Paul Weingarten[12] playing the piano concerto in G minor, the Eroica and the 8th symphony (30 March), Fidelio with Lotte Lehmann, Alfred Piccaver, Elisabeth Schumann and Richard Mayr conducted by Lothar Wallerstein (31 March at the Odeon-Musikhaus); Turandot (1 April). From Vienna she went to Berlin for the end of the Beethoven celebrations: the 6 (letztes) Konzert (5 April) with the Berlin Philharmonic conducted by Julius Prüwer[13] with Bronislaw Huberman (violin), Gregor Piatigorsky (cello) and Siegfried Schultze (piano); the Letzter Beethoven Abend (7 April) Edwin Fischer playing four sonatas. After the Beethoven concerts she went to a recital (10 April) by the Violinist Stefi Meyer[14] (accompanied by her husband Walter Schulthess) and finally to Fidelio again on 22 April conducted by Bruno Walter.[15]\n\nIn September 1927 she went to Austria and Germany with Nora Forman.[16] In Munich (14 September) they saw Paganini with Richard Tauber (‘absolutely great’) and (18 September) they saw Die Gräfin Maritza (‘ever so pleasing’).\n\nAfter the war she lived at Ware in Hertfordshire possibly to be near her great friend, the violinist Aline Hay who lived in Hertfordshire. Her musical activities there are described in her obituary.\n\nHer professional career covered more than 60 years starting in 1910 and she continued to be active musically until her death in 1975. The peak of her career was from the 1920s until the Second World War in both Scotland and in London.\n\nHer early training was in Somerset where she took the local examination in musical knowledge from Trinity College, London on 23rd June 1900 and obtained 100%. The next year she got 131/150 in the examinations of the Associated Board of the Royal Academy of Music and the Royal College of Music but three years later she received a letter from the Royal College of Music regretting to inform her that she had:\n\nnot obtained the requisite number of marks to entitle you to a Certificate of Proficiency in Pianoforte Teaching.\n\nHer great uncle, the Rev. Henry Mallet[17] wrote to her expressing his and his sister-in-law, Caroline Singleton’s, understanding of her disappointment, and continued:\n\nwith the taste and power for musical performance which you have, there is often more good to be got out of a first failure than out of a first success. You will have learned more what is needed, and will not I trust be at all discouraged but will set to work with more determination to supply what is wanting and secure success.\n\nLeft, Otto Goldschmidt, a foundation piano student of the Leipzig Conservatorium which was founded by Felix Mendelssohn (right) in 1843 (images from the internet).\n\nIn May 1905, Henry Mallet again wrote to her, this time congratulating her on obtaining a Certificate with Honours for a performance. On 8 September her father wrote to Otto Goldschmidt,[18] sending him a copy of the current prospectus of the Royal Conservatorium of Music of Leipzig, and requesting his help in getting his daughter admitted as a pupil of Professor Teichmüller at the Leipzig Conservatory.[19] Whether or not Otto Goldschmidt helped, Joan Singleton was accepted as a pupil of Professor Teichmüller at the Leipzig Conservatorium in 1905.\n\nOne of the star students from this time at Leipzig was the mezzo-soprano, Elena Gerhardt, a protogée of Arthur Nikisch, the Director of the Conservatorium.[20] She gives a vivid picture of the privilege of being a student there in her autobiography.[21]\n\nStudents were allowed to go to rehearsals of the Gewandhaus Orchestra which was conducted by Arthur Nikisch. They could pick up the small Eulenberg scores of which there were dozens piled up outside the hall and so follow the music and learn from the way Nikisch interpreted or explained points to his orchestra.\n\nStudents also had free entry to the public rehearsals on Wednesday mornings when the Conservatorium was closed so that every student might have the opportunity to attend. At these concerts we would also hear the world’s greatest artists: Paderewski, Carreño, d’Albert, Siloti, Suggia, Ysaye, Joachim, Lilli Lehmann, Schumann-Heink, Edith Walker, Alice Barbi, Raimund von zur Mühlen, Nordica, and dozens more.\n\nTwo students at the Leipzig Conservatorium who were contemporaries of Joan Singleton and who went on to international careers. Left, Elena Gerhardt, aged 20, after her first concert with Arthur Nikisch in 1903. She was a student from 1900; right, the portrait of the Portuguese cellist, Guilhermina Suggia (1885-1950) painted by Augustus John between 1920 and 1923. She enrolled as a student in 1901 and within a year was playing as a soloist with the Gewandhaus orchestra under Nikisch. She completed the 3 years study in 18 months.\n\nThe Leipzig Conservatorium, the oldest university school of music in Germany, had strong connections with Great Britain: Sir Arthur Sullivan, Dame Ethyl Smyth and Frederick Delius were amongst the British students and, from Australia, Alfred Hill. In 1905, there were more than 900 students:[22]\n\nThe Conservatorium aims at giving its pupils an opportunity of acquiring practically and theoretically musical efficiency and knowledge in all branches, indispensable to the modern musician, offers great advantages over private tuition. Through participation of several students in the same lesson industry and emulation is promoted. True musical feeling is engendered and kept alive, the best preventive of one-sidedness in education and taste against which every musician should be on his guard.\n\nAfter acceptance as a student, accommodation had to be found. The Pension Harris at Arndtstrasse 4 in Leipzig looked suitable and a prospectus was obtained. Carry S. Harris wrote of the rules and conditions:[23]\n\nSince we inhabit a villa, contrary to the usual German habit of flats, there is no difficulty about practising beyond: no practising with open windows, and not later than 10 p.m. The young ladies here each [have] their own instruments – which they hire for 9 to 18 sh. a month – one to 9 sh. is good enough for practice, 12 sh. certainly. There is then 10 sh. carriage to pay extra.\n\nIn the case of two young ladies having the room between them, the one has her instrument in the dining or the sitting room.\n\nAs you will see in the Prospectus German lessons are included in the price of the Pension. There are German, French and English young ladies in the house. The conversation at table and when we are together in the evening is always in German. I allow no English talking in the house.\n\nCarry S. Harris from the Pension Harris wrote to the Rev. Singleton:[24]\n\nI duly received your letter this morning and am very glad you should have decided to trust your daughter to my care. I shall do my best to make her stay with us profitable and pleasant for her. Everything shall be ready for the young lady’s reception on 23rd of September.\n\nIt would be well for her to bring a passport. It is required here and if she has not got it we would have to apply to the British Consul for one.\n\nA passport was duly obtained on 16 September 1905 for Frances Joan Singleton to travel to Germany accompanied by the Reverend James Sydenham Fowke Singleton. The fees of 360 marks per term, paid in three instalments of 120 marks at Michaelmas, Christmas and Easter, plus an entrance fee of 10 marks were paid between 26 September 1905 and 8 Jan 1908.[25]\n\nJoan Singleton’s sister Marion had acquired a passport to go to Germany on 4 January 1907. She learnt to swim and acquired a Schwimm-Zeugnis as a Frei-Schwimmer under the Schwimm-Meister Gustav Meissner on 10 August 1907 and had herself photographed in Magdeburg and returned to Somerset by Christmas.[26]\n\nProfessor Robert Teichmüller, her teacher at the Leipzig Conservatory (photograph from a postcard owned by Joan Singleton) and Marion Singleton, Joan Singleton’s elder sister, photographed in Magdeburg in 1907.\n\nJoan Singleton’s passport issued by the Foreign Office on 16 September 1905.\n\nOn 20 March 1908 as Fräulein Joan Singleton aus Theale she played in her graduation concert four Solostücke by Scarlatti, Schumann and Brahms.\n\nWhile in Leipzig she played the organ at the British and American Episcopal Church. The Rev. Ernest F. Scofield, the British Chaplain, wrote to her on 13 April 1908 enclosing a small token of the esteem and gratitude of the congregation on hearing that they might be losing her. When she went to Edinburgh in 1911 she hoped to get a job as a church organist. She was an excellent organist and received testimonials in 1911 from the Rev. E. F. Scofield, the former British Chaplain at Leipzig.[27] From her return from Leipzig she had been organist in Wookey, a village near her parents’ home in Theale in Somerset. Another testimonial from the same time was from Edward B. Cook, the Vicar of St Martin’s in Leeds:\n\nIt is a pleasure to me to write commending Miss Singleton’s ability and enthusiasm as a church organist. For some three years she played for us at Wookey near Wells, and I have great reason to thank her for what she then did for us. She is not only a well trained and experienced musician, but she has had a long experience in playing church services, and is full of enthusiasm for this work.\n\nShe possesses a rare gift of accompaniment and can be trusted not only to use the organ fully, but to assist the choir and not to let the organ assert itself unduly. Any church would be glad it had secured Miss Singleton’s services, and it will be a pleasure to me to reply to any questions which may be sent to me on her behalf.\n\nHer real interest was getting established as a pianist. On her return to England she wrote to the Rev. Canon Thomas Henry Davis for advice regarding her future career teaching private pupils.[28] He replied on 16 June 1908 saying that:\n\nThe best and only thing I can suggest your doing is that to get started was to have a friend, if you have such a one, to give an ‘At Home’ in her drawing-room in London to which she will invite heaps of people and then she can give out that you are anxious to teach and one pupil may turn up and may lead to others. Of course there are heaps of girls doing this sort of thing in London but there is always room, I think, if you can get a few introductions such as would come from playing at ‘At Home’, you may have to wait before you get many but you might get a few engagements to accompany at swell ‘At Home’ or necessarily to play a few solos. As regards playing in the school-room at Wells, you must not think of it. It would be madness to do it, of course if you thought of settling down to teach in these parts, you might then give a recital in the Town Hall and get an audience of all the people round in the county who are interested in music. We might of course keep you in this way, still the teaching in the county is not good. I mean as regards fees obtainable and would become hard work if you depended on it entirely. I hope you will understand all this, but if I am not clear, please let me know, as I will certainly do anything I can for you. I am so glad the English congregation appreciated your services.\n\nOn 22 June 1908 he sent a testimonial as to her excellence as a musician, both practical and theoretical (including harmony). Further advice as to how to proceed came from Muriel Little, a former pupil of Robert Teichmüller, in response to a letter from Joan Singleton.[29] Muriel Little’s long letter written to Joan Singleton in Leipzig on 2 July 1908 is full of good advice learnt by hard experience. It is worth quoting in full as it gives a vivid picture of the musical jungle in Edwardian England facing Joan Singleton:\n\nDear Miss Singleton,\n\nI was very pleased you wrote to me and can assure you I will do all I can to help you.\n\nYou must not think me disparaging when I tell you that there is very little scope for musicians in London – especially performers – everything being highly competed for. Altho’ again, if one is only determined and, of course, gifted enough to get on in spite of long waiting there is work to be had. Have nothing to do with agents unless you have money to back you up. They are a “set of thieves” (please forgive the ausdrück) and impose terribly on one’s pocket unless one has already made a name, or has someone influential behind pushing.\n\nThe great thing seems to me, is to get a private influential ‘clientele’ of one’s own and until that is obtained it is impossible to give a recital in London to bring one’s name before the public unless as I said before, one has means.\n\nThe Bechstein Hall, or any of the others if hired or filled for you by an agent would cost £40 to £50 and even then (unless you were pushed or brought out by someone like Richter, Nikisch or Wood) would be of practically no use to you with the exception of obtaining press notices. The latter you are always asked for (if you have no money) by the agents before they even suggest helping you or becoming your agent. Of course my chief clientele at present is in Norwich where I have 15 pupils and visit each weekend. This I started by giving a big invitation concert in Norwich, getting two London artistes (friends) to help me and giving my professional cards of terms away at the door afterwards. I also saw that the Press had invitations. This was of course directly I left Leipzig.\n\nMy native town is only 12 miles away from Norwich. So of course I had a few friends who pushed and helped me and mentioned my name, until I had one or two pupils and as one or two of them have turned out successes, I have now several. The next thing I intend giving there is a pupils’ concert. I tell you all this as you asked and for this reason I would suggest that you make your start in the nearest large town to your home. It is no use whatever relying on promiscuous engagements if you want to begin earning at once. You must bide your time to become known (unless you have money). But never let an opportunity slip by, either of becoming known or of accepting an introduction to anyone. One never knows what it may lead to, perhaps a pupil or something. I also found it a great thing never to refuse to sing or play whenever or wherever asked even if not in the mood or bei Stimme.\n\nI am afraid all this everlasting push, and ‘grasping’ (almost) does not tend to further one’s musical instinct or intuition but it has to be done in England unless you are already a Mischa Elman[30] or Godowsky[31] and can afford to employ an agent.\n\nOf course so much depends on one’s self as you of course can already surmise and if you are to reach the top of the tree, and are an artiste to the core nothing can keep you back. Then only you can be your own mistress and hold the agents in your hands. (I expect you will laugh at me giving you the latter advice not having arrived anywhere near that myself yet).\n\nI find, of course, living in London adds a trademark to my profession, and London is the only place where one can keep in touch with the musical world [her letter was sent from 56, Holmdale Road, West Hampstead]. You must also be prepared to find the average listener in England totally ignorant of music as regards classical and technical knowledge (except in the London real musical sets) and must not expect to be understood, and admired as much as you were abroad (I mean from a musician’s standpoint). It is hard to tell you this – but I can assure you I have been through it. You must be prepared for disappointments.\n\nBut now to the brighter side. I found after this first year of drudgery (and many tears) I could pay my own expenses. (Father had to help me until that time had elapsed). This, of course, by teaching (private pupils) which is the only reliable way of earning at first. Of course during the concert season one gets several odd jobs – “At Homes,” “Charity Concerts,” Provincial Concerts also. The latter are helpful and I would suggest if you have a local musician to call on him and let him hear you and give you a chance of performing with him (this perhaps for expenses only). I must also confess I had a very dear and influential friend who has helped me in both London and Norwich, whom I met and sung for shortly after my return from abroad. It seems to me Miss Singleton that you must be on the spot to do any good. I mean it would not be any use me putting your name down on any school agents’ books if you were not here to be interviewed. I would strongly recommend a visiting school appointment which are generally very remunerative but also vey highly sought after. For this purpose you must have your teachers testimonials (both English and foreign) and credentials done, printed or typewritten in proper form. I strongly advise you to get yours from all your masters in Leipzig recommending you as a competent teacher (your performers you have on your prüfungs zeugnis). I had to write for mine afterwards, but felt rather sorry to bother them all so late in the day although they were ripping. You must also expect many people over here to know nothing of the Leipzig masters or even what a Leipzig diploma entails and more than often one finds it is these people that one has to do with; they wanting their children to be musically instructed. I think this is all I need tell you. I cannot enforce too strongly that it depends entirely on yourself and your powers as a performer and teacher. Another great thing is to be able to convince patrons that your method and ideas are the right ones. Self-confidence in one’s method, I mean. This I am sure you have! Of course it will be a good thing for you to put your name on several educational school agents booksby paying the entry fee of 1/.\n\nYou do not tell me when you are coming home, but it would be a good thing to do it soon because of the summer vacation coming on and I know the schools fix up their new mistresses early for the Autumn Semester. A very good medium is the Educational Journal (6d every month) if you could get it. At any rate Miss Singleton, I shall be only too pleased to help you in any way if you care to come and see me or write to me. I know only too well what a struggle it is to become known for the first year. I had to find out everything for myself. What I have told you is the gist of it but all good comes to him who waits long enough.\n\nYes, I have seen a great deal of Elena Gerhardt. She has scored a huge success over here, and has been in grand form. She has been kind in recommending me. Of course she is so often asked here if she teaches. I expect you would smile to see me posing as a conductor but I have a Ladies Choral at Sandringham. We are giving a concert next month.\n\nHow sorry you must be to leave Leipzig. I suppose you don’t earn enough to keep yourself there. I should recommend you to stay if you don’t like the idea of waiting to become known here which has to be, if one means to do it alone. Every one tells me I have been lucky to get on so well. So it can be done Miss Singleton in two years. I gave a recital last month at Princes Skating Rink and managed to fill the Hall to standing room. I am giving an invitation concert kindly lent me the hall by a friend in London on June 19. Next year if all goes well I shall hope to take one of the larger halls and perhaps give a recital with someone else. I was fortunate in getting some good press notices last month.\n\nWell do write if you want to know anything further. I hope this letter does not dampen your zeal because I imagine that you will be one who takes things seriously and will succeed.\n\nPlease give my love to Bertha when you see her. I hope to go to Leipzig again this summer. And please give my heartiest greetings to dear old “Teichy” and tell him the Chopin Scherzo got a good press notice the other day.\n\nWith kindest remembrances,\n\nVery sincerely yours, Muriel S. Little.\n\nGetting established in London, Joan wrote to Maude Valerie White,[32] who replied:\n\nI am so touched by your dear kind little card and the lovely flowers – dear Miss Joan, believe me it’s a real joy to do even such a trifle as I have been privileged to do for you – Mr Theodore who was sitting just behind you when you played Miss Ealons (?) first solos turned to me and said “How beautifully that girl accompanies” and I certainly agreed with him con amore. I do wish you the greatest of luck for you deserve it. Do keep up with dear Harry Greene.[33] He loves your playing and likes you very much, and I’m sure he’d be a real true friend to you as he has been to many another young artist. I am sure to see you again so I’ll only say au revoir and bless you.\n\nYrs affectly, Maude Valerie White\n\nAn early, but undated, letter from the violinist Lilian Foulis[34] asks her to accompany her at the Aeolian Hall.[35] She wrote:\n\nI heard you last meeting and liked your playing very much. I am playing two violin solos, Ave Maria (Schubert-Wilhelming) and Souvenir de Moscow Wieniawski. Of course I am getting no fee, but I should be pleased to give you 7/6.\n\nThe Royal Conservatorium of Music, Leipzig from Joan Singleton’s copy of the 1905 prospectus.\n\nJoan Singleton moved to Edinburgh about 1910: it had been recommended to her by an Edinburgh student in Germany as a teaching centre.[36] She had clearly been to Edinburgh as she sent a postcard of Edinburgh (of Colinton, a suburb) from Leipzig to her sister Marion on 27 June 1909. Joan Singleton’s Aunt Pussie[37] had enlisted the help of a Mrs Thomson:\n\nMrs Thomson wrote off at once to a musical cousin in Edinburgh and to her Italian singing master of what she should say! Mrs T. says she will be glad to do anything to help you and if any use you could play at her house and she would ask people who might be useful to hear you.\n\nIn an undated brochure she offers lessons (in Edinburgh) for £4.4.0 a term of 12 lessons, (‘specialising in teaching small children from 4 to 6 years’: references are kindly permitted from the Lady Dunedin of 7, Rothesay Terrace, among others).\n\nAn early friend in Edinburgh was Marcus Dods, a judge, who collected antique furniture and used to knit on the train going ‘through to Edinburgh’ during the First World War.[38] He was also an accomplished musician who played a prominent part in the development of vocal music in the West End of Edinburgh and for his work on the Executive Committee of the Edinburgh Musical Festival.[39] Had he wished, he might have won fame as a musician, for he had not only a glorious voice, but he had also in singular degree an emotional and intellectual knowledge and appreciation of music.[40]\n\nOn Easter Monday 1912 Marcus Dods wrote to Joan Singleton asking if she would accompany him. He had heard her play and had greatly enjoyed her playing. He also wanted her help with a girls’ choir he ran. He particularly wanted to improve his acquaintance with Hugo Wolf and he wanted her to accompany him in at a Browning Centenary recital in May. He also wanted her to play a toccata by Gallupi in that concert. Browning had written a poem entitled A toccata of Galuppi’s but no such composition was available in print so Joan Singleton had to play Galuppi’s Sonata in C minor. He had been asked to play the toccata but he felt it needed her Bach touch not his. He hoped she would approve of a Steinway on which to play. The concert duly took place and on 8 May Marcus Dods received a letter from a Mr Marshall thanking him for his help and adding\n\nWill you also convey our gratitude to Miss Singleton I can’t tell you how much her playing enchanted us. Her accompaniments were superb and her playing of the Galuppi music was the very perfection of art and good taste. You had not told me half about her. What a joy it must be to hear her play Bach.\n\nMarcus Dods (1876-1935) from a photograph by Lafayette owned by Joan Singleton and Jean Marcel, cellist (photograph from programme).\n\nJoan Singleton became, and remained, a close friend of the Dods family. After her death in 1975, Marcus Dods daughter, Marcia wrote:[41]\n\nShe was a dear friend to our family making much music with my father and we always enjoyed her annual visits. I always looked forward to seeing her when she came to Edinburgh for the Competitive Festival. I was always sorry that she seemed so busy that she could never stay for long! She did once pay me a very fleeting visit here but it was lovely to see her and I feel privileged to think she thought it worth her while to come so far for such a short visit.\n\nFrom 1918 Joan Singleton collected reviews of her concerts though as these became more frequent they were not as carefully entered and many are undated; there are no reviews after 1938. Based on concert reviews there were three strands to Joan Singleton’s musical life, as a soloist and in chamber music, accompanying singers and instrumentalists in recitals, and, as official accompanist at competitions.\n\nOne of the few reviews mentioning her solo playing was a concert in the Playhouse Galashiels in Scotland[42] featuring the cellist Beatrice Harrison (‘The lady who set nightingales singing’), the soprano Dora Labette, the contralto Miss Olga Haley,[43] the baritone Mr Robert Parker and Miss Joan Singleton, pianist and accompanist.\n\nThe programme opened with a very fine performance by Miss Singleton of Bach’s Fantasia in C minor and Bach-Busoni Choral Prelude. The distinctive features in these numbers were delightfully brought out by this accomplished lady, who in response to the applause gave another charming piece, which emphasised her fine tone and excellent technique.\n\nThe (anonymous) reviewer goes on:\n\nThe accompaniments for the vocalists were exquisitely played by Miss Joan Singleton with whom patrons of these concerts were glad to renew acquaintance, and to whom much of the evening’s enjoyment was due. She has, we are sure, by her gracious personality and artistry, made a host of friends, amongst the music-loving people of the Borders, who will accord her a hearty welcome on any future occasion.\n\nAn earlier concert in the Gymnasium of the Madras School at St Andrews[44] with the Scottish cellist David Millar Craig received this review:\n\nMiss Singleton is a veritable virtuoso at the piano, and she charmed the audience with her solos – Intermezzo, Op. 118 No. 1 (Brahms), Clair de Lune (Debussy) and Fireflies (Frank Bridge). The Intermezzo was brilliantly executed: in the second piece the sad stillness of moonlight was beautifully expressed, and fluttering movements were cleverly suggested in Fireflies. In response to an encore that would not be denied, she played a theme by Schumann.\n\nA review from 1930[45] of a concert of ‘two artistes of the first rank – Miss Eileen Bingham (soprano), and Miss Joan Singleton (pianist)’ gives full detail of Joan Singleton’s playing:\n\nMiss Joan Singleton, the solo pianist, was only down to play one group of pieces, and the audience, realising this, clapped so persistently at the end of the series of pieces, that Miss Singleton had to oblige twice more. To begin with, everyone had a foretaste of her qualities, for she played Miss Bingham’s accompaniments superbly. And when she alone held the stage, her power over the audience was magnetic. She could achieve a pianissimo which literally made you hold your breath, and, conversely, she could produce tonal volume which was sheer magnificence. Her pieces included Minuet and Variations in D Major, Allegro (from a harpsichord suite by Maurice Greene), Gavotte (Gluck-Brahms), Beethoven number, and the very descriptive and fast-moving Fireflies. It may truly be said that Miss Singleton added another to her long list of successes and secured a warm place in the musical hearts of West Kirby.\n\nOne of the striking features of reviews of chamber music concerts featuring Joan Singleton is how unimportant the pianist’s role appears. For example, when she was playing a work such as the Kreutzer sonata, her contribution was noted, not as a partner, but as ‘ably supporting the violinist’. In an undated review[46] of a performance at the Grotrian Hall of the Schumann E flat major piano quintet by the Beredin String Quartet,[47] the reviewer (F. B.[48]) says:\n\nthat the pianist, Miss Joan Singleton proved so invaluable an ally to the string players.[49]\n\nThis diminishing of the importance of the role of the pianist in chamber music is reflected in the paucity of chamber music in the record catalogues of this time. For example, the HMV wartime catalogue of 1914-18 lists Marjorie Hayward and Una Bourne playing the Kreutzer Sonata; this appears to be the only chamber music in a substantial catalogue.[50]\n\nJoan Singleton’s career as a pianist was as an accompanist. Before Gerald Moore (1899-1987), accompanists, though obviously valued by singers and instrumentalists and essential for the success of a concert, were not given more than a throw away line at the end of the review. Ivor Newton (1892-1981) and Harold Craxton (1885-1971) are the only British pianists who were contemporaries of Joan Singleton whose names are remembered as accompanists. From her first concerts in London, her talent as an accompanist was recognised by her fellow musicians but reviewers usually recognised the accompanist in the last line of a review such as:\n\nThe accompaniments were ably played by Miss Joan Singleton.[51]\n\nAt this time the idea in England of a singer or instrumentalist and pianist as partners, such as Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Gerald Moore, would appear to be unknown. More positive is this review from The Times of a recital by Mark Raphael at the Grotrian Hall in London:\n\nMiss Joan Singleton contributed very considerably to the success of the recital by her admirable performance of the accompaniments.[52]\n\nMore typical reviews are the following from London concerts. The first, from The Observer,[53] was Joan Singleton accompanying Mark Raphael in a group of songs by E. J. Moeran to poems of James Joyce:\n\nThe songs were sensitively sung by Mr Mark Raphael to the excellent accompaniment of Miss Joan Singleton their true stature becomes even more impressive.\n\nA third review is from The Sunday Times[54] and was the debut of the soprano Eileen Bingham at the Wigmore Hall:\n\nMiss Bingham was exceptionally fortunate in her accompanist, Miss Joan Singleton, whose technique was unimpeachable, including the rare faculty of faultless judgment both of song and of singer; clearly she has a special vocation for this difficult art.\n\nAn undated review of a concert in Ayr with Mark Raphael and Seymour Whinyates comments on the accompanist:\n\nMiss Singleton contributed compositions by Bach, Couperin, and Schumann, and also assisted in Brahms’ Sonata in D minor, Op. 108. She is a pianist of outstanding qualities, all her work displaying technique of the best kind.\n\nAn appreciation of her accompanying came from the cellist Miss Jean Marcel[55] whom she accompanied in a concert at the Freemasons’ Hall in Edinburgh in aid of the Scottish Women’s Hospitals in France and Serbia on 30 October 1915 and the next day received a thank you note:\n\nI cannot thank you enough for your delightful accompanying yesterday; very very few accompanists have played as well for me as you did; and I hope we shall often play together. I enclose two guineas. Hoping you are none the worse,\n\nYours very sincerely, Jean Marcel\n\nThe cellist Beatrice Harrison and the soprano Dora Labette (images from the internet).\n\nPerhaps the best review of her accompanying is from a review of a mixed concert she played in 1928 in Galashiels in the Scottish Borders. The main attractions were the cellist Beatrice Harrison, and Dora Labette, the soprano. Beatrice Harrison was accompanied by her sister but Joan Singleton accompanied Dora Labette.[56] The reviewer wrote of the accompanist:\n\nThe accompaniments for the vocalists were exquisitely played by Miss Joan Singleton, with whom patrons of these concerts were glad to renew acquaintance, and to whom much of the evening’s enjoyment was due. She has, we are sure, by her gracious personality and artistry, made a host of friends amongst the music-loving people of the borders, who will accord her a hearty welcome on any future occasion.[57]\n\nIn the programme notes for this concert, it is recorded that:\n\nHer headquarters are now in London,[58] where she is doing good work in collaboration with most of the leading singers and instrumentalists of the present day. She holds an unrivalled position as a most sympathetic accompanist, as well as a brilliant pianist, a rather unusual combination.\n\nA year later an even grander concert (‘there were very, very few empty seats’) was held at The Playhouse in Galashiels.[59] ‘It was given before a distinctly music-loving audience, because there was no breaking in with applause before a song and its accompaniment were finished.’ The star of this concert was the young violin virtuoso Milan Bratza[60] but:\n\nThere were some beautiful accompaniments, which were presented in all their glory by that accomplished lady, Miss Joan Singleton.\n\nAs well as Milan Bratza the artists were the bass Robert Easton,[61] the tenor Heddle Nash[62] and the soprano Miss Megan Foster.[63]\n\nUndoubtedly his [Bratza’s] best number, in collaboration with Miss Singleton at the pianoforte, was “The Devil’s Trill” (Tartini), his interpretation of which was greeted with enthusiastic and prolonged applause. In acknowledging the appreciation of the audience, Bratza was not unmindful of Miss Singleton, whose accompaniment had not a little to do with the success of the piece.\n\nMilan Bratza in 1929, Heddle Nash in 1945 and Robert Easton in 1933 (images from the internet).\n\nOver her long career, Joan Singleton was associated with many musicians. There are reviews for concerts with singers and instrumentalists both famous and now forgotten. Among the musicians who are unknown to me are:\n\nEileen Bingham (soprano),[64] Cecilia Brenner (‘a Dutch mezzo-soprano with a magnificent voice’), Charles Bruce (violinist), Dorothy Chalmers (violinist), Gladys Clark (violin),[65] Elsie Cochrane (soprano), David Millar Craig (cellist),[66] Douglas Dickson (violinist), Marjorie Greenfield (soprano), Helen Henschel (soprano),[67] Jeanne Hommedieu (‘American soprano’), Walter Johnstone-Douglas (bass baritone),[68] Miss Hope MacDiarmid (‘a young Scottish singer unknown to me’), Sheila Macdonald (‘a New Zealand soprano of Scottish parents’), Beatrice Parker (soprano; ‘comes from Edinburgh where she has won immense popularity as a teacher and a singer’), Denne Parker (contralto),[69] Hilda Saxe (‘a clever pianist’ who played with Jean Marcel, cellist),[70] Gregory Stroud,[71] Marie Thomson (soprano),[72] Marcus Thomson (baritone).\n\nOne of her earliest concerts with a famous singer was in 1920 when she accompanied Mignon Nevada in a concert she had given in the Usher Hall, Edinburgh. Of the concert, The Evening Dispatch wrote:\n\nA most enjoyable feature of the evening was the very beautiful singing of Miss Mignon Nevada, an operatic soprano of exceptional musical quality, who is not unknown to Edinburgh music-lovers. Nothing finer has been heard here for many a day than her touching rendering of the famous “Willow” song from Verdi’s Otello, in which she was accompanied most sympathetically by the orchestra. Later she gave, with perfect charm, tender air from Mozart’s Zaide, and Purcell’s wholly delightful “Hark! Hark! The echoing air.” She had a great reception from the audience, and was induced to give two encores, one being a pretty trifle entitled “Daybreak,” from the pen of Mr Julius Harrison [the conductor of the orchestra]. The later songs were accompanied most tastefully by Miss Joan Singleton.\n\nEmma Nevada (left) and her daughter Mignon Nevada (right). Mignon is photographed as Ophelia in Thomas’s Hamlet. Sir Thomas Beecham thought her the finest Ophelia he had ever heard.\n\nJoan Singleton wrote to Mignon’s mother, the famous soprano Emma Nevada,[73] about the concert and, in reply, received a letter of thanks:[74]\n\nMignon is indeed a great singer – among the most perfect singers before the public today – and what is more her art like her voice grows every day. She does not sit still content with what she has – but looks always for more and more perfection.\n\nMignon told me how beautifully you accompanied her. I remember the recital of Laddie how splendid you were,\n\nMy husband is in London for a few days but will be back I hope tomorrow. He has gone to arrange the contract of Mignon’s engagement in London which is a very interesting one. Sir Thomas Beecham’s fifteen year old son[75] has written an opera for Mignon which is nothing less than “The Merchant of Venice” and Mignon is to create the role of Portia in the first days of February so we are leaving Paris on the 3rd of January to go back to London. John Coates is to conduct the opera and there is great excitement about it.\n\nThe most important singer Joan Singleton regularly collaborated with was the baritone Mark Raphael. The following is adapted from the notes accompanying a record of Mark Raphael singing songs by Roger Quilter and Samuel Alman:\n\nBorn in London’s East End on April 7, 1900, Mark Raphael received his initial musical experience as a child chorister in the Great Synagogue, where he sang under the direction of Samuel Alman. Shortly thereafter he appeared as a soprano soloist in Alman’s King Abaz, the first Yiddish opera. Mark was also featured in numerous appearances with the then visiting Cantor of Warsaw, Gerson Serota.\n\nAs a young adult Mark studied voice and repertoire in Italy, Germany and France.[76] Returning to England he began to appear widely throughout the area of Greater London, coming to public notice particularly for his singing on programs dedicated to the memory of the recently deceased Fauré. Shortly thereafter he gave a recital at London’s Wigmore Hall,[77] programming several songs by Roger Quilter which attracted the attention of the composer himself.\n\nQuilter regularly accompanied Mark Raphael in recitals. In the Autumn of 1924 they gave concerts in Vienna and Frankfurt. Quilter and Mark Raphael preformed three of Fauré’s songs in a memorial concert at the Wigmore Hall on 9 June 1925. In 1934/5 Mark Raphael and Roger Quilter recorded a set of seventeen Quilter songs.[78]\n\nIn the years from 1927 to 1938 Mark Raphael and Joan Singleton gave recitals all over England and Scotland. The first dated programme of Mark Raphael and Joan Singleton is from 1927 and was at the Masonic Hall, Cambridge on 21 October. It was a replacement concert for Mark Raphael and Roger Quilter.[79] In February, and again in October, 1928 they went to Scotland accompanied by the violinist Seymour Whinyates playing in Perth, Edinburgh (at the Freemasons’ Hall), Ayr and Glasgow. Mark Raphael sang Old French songs, lieder and songs by Roger Quilter; Seymour Whinyates and Joan Singleton played the Beethoven and violin sonata Op. 30, a Chaconne by Vitali and violin pieces by Martini-Corti and de Falla and Joan Singleton played piano soli by Bach, Schubert and Brahms. The Edinburgh Evening News gave first mention of Joan Singleton:[80]\n\nFor a number of years Miss Singleton took a prominent place in musical circles in Edinburgh, but she is now resident in London. She amply manifested the high qualities of her art in her renderings of Bach’s Fantasia in C minor and the Bach-Busoni Choral prelude In dir ist freude; the latter being brilliantly played.\n\n‘\n\nMark Raphael (left) and the flier for Marian Anderson’s debut concert at the Wigmore Hall in 1928.\n\nThe Evening Dispatch was equally complimentary and said of the singer:\n\nMr Raphael’s contributions as a lieder-singer were perfect cameos of their kind. His singing displayed a delightful lyric quality that found its happiest expression in a group of five Schubert songs. In each number Mr Raphael brought a sympathy of expression and deep understanding of the spirit of the songs which could not fail to impress.\n\nIn June 1928 they gave their first London recital. On 7 June they gave recital of Schubert songs at the Wigmore Hall. It was briefly reviewed in all the papers:[81]\n\nHe used a smallish baritone voice with so much skill and intelligence as to be more pleasing than many a more imposing singer. It was a musician’s concert.\n\nA more complimentary review of his singing was from a concert they gave at The Royal Pavilion in Brighton in 1929:[82]\n\nSince Mr Plunket Greene was last here, Brighton has heard no singer of such distinction and versatile accomplishment as Mr Mark Raphael. He is charged with a colourful emotion in voice that springs from his own temperament. Equipped with a mellow, sensitive baritone, responsive to all shades of his mood, and technically excellent, Mr Raphael is something greater than a good singer. He is a creative artist.\n\nThere are two programmes for concerts in the Grotrian Hall; one is dated 20 May 1931 and was a recital of songs by Schumann, Wolf and E. J. Moeran (to poems by James Joyce). The back of the programme advertises that he teaches singing in the Blüthner Studios in Wigmore Street.[83] In this concert he sang, to excellent reviews, some Schubert songs and Fauré’s, La Bonne Chanson cycle. There are other undated programmes for concerts at the Aeolian Hall, Wigmore Hall and another at the Grotrian Hall (9 November 1937) and finally a performance of Winterreise at the Wigmore Hall on 15 November 1938.\n\nIt was through Mark Raphael and Roger Quilter that Joan Singleton accompanied Marian Anderson at her Wigmore Hall debut on 15 June 1928. In England, Marian Anderson had been taken under the wing of Roger Quilter after writing to him in 1922 asking him to coach her on singing his songs. She had a few lessons from Mark Raphael’s teacher, Raimund von zur Mühlen, and then some from Mark Raphael. Marian Anderson was a regular visitor to Quilter’s home and sang frequently for the gatherings in his music room. Her recital at the Wigmore Hall took place on 15 June. For most of the songs she was accompanied by Joan Singleton, but Quilter accompanied her in a group of his own songs.[84]\n\nThere is a signed photograph of Rosina Buckman[85] inscribed to ‘My love dear Joan Singleton’ but there is neither programme nor review of any concert they gave together among Joan Singleton’s papers.\n\nRosina Buckman (from a photograph in Joan Singleton’s papers).\n\nJoan Hammond (image from the internet).\n\nSimilarly, there is neither a programme nor a review of a concert which Joan Hammond and Joan Singleton gave at the National Gallery in London on 18 July 1940.[86] During the Second World War, Joan Hammond lived with Joan Singleton’s sister, Patience Singleton. Joan Singleton was “Flutterby,” an appropriate name,[87] to Joan Hammond.\n\nAmong the better known instrumentalists she played with, not already mentioned, were the violinists Jelly d’Aranyi[88] and Marjorie Hayward.[89]\n\nAmong Joan Singleton’s papers is a postcard with Christmas greetings from Marjory Kennedy-Fraser and several programmes of recitals of Marjory Kennedy-Fraser’s Hebridean songs. Marjory Kennedy-Fraser (1857-1930) was a Scottish singer (she was a pupil of Mathilde Marchesi), composer and arranger of Scottish folk songs. Joan Singleton accompanied Rachel Neill Fraser[90] in a recital of these songs in Berlin in 1928 at the Bechstein Saal.\n\nJoan Singleton attended a memorial concert for Marjory Kennedy-Fraser in the Wigmore Hall on 12 March 1931 with Marjory’s sister, Margaret Kennedy, her daughter Patuffa Kennedy-Fraser, and Ruth Waddell (cellist).[91] The first group of songs were sung by Margaret Kennedy with Patuffa playing the piano. Joan Singleton’s comments, written in the margin of the programme, reveal another side of her nature: The whole of this group rather missed fire with the exception of the last. Patuffa’s piano touch is certainly matured in the wood, or was it the Chappell piano. Anyhow she hit a record number of wrong notes. The next group sung by Patuffa fared no better: An attractive group but what a rasping voice when it is let out. On The Lull-Song to the Heir of the Macleods: I felt sorry for the heir of the Macleods if he was lulled as Patuffa lulled him! Of a piano piece, Coronation Processional: Another pet of mine, but Patuffa hit the piano as though she hated it. Finally, a comment on Margaret Kennedy singing The Leaping Galley: Painful.\n\nChristmas card (undated) from Marjory Kennedy-Fraser (from Joan Singleton’s papers).\n\nLater she was associated with the Robert Masters Piano Quartet and the London Mozart Players.[92] Presumably the association was through the Beredin Quartet, two members of whom came from Edinburgh, Nannie Jamieson[93] and her sister Hilda Jamieson. Joan Singleton had played the Schumann piano quintet in E flat major with them. Nannie Jamieson later played the viola in the Robert Masters Piano Quartet. The cellist of the quartet, Muriel Taylor gave a concert with Joan Singleton in 1958.\n\nThe Robert Masters piano quartet photographed in Australia by Max Dupain in 1950; from the left: Kimlock Anderson (piano), Robert Masters (violin), Nannie Jamieson (viola) and Muriel Taylor (cello) (image from NLA website).\n\n“I like this piece taken slowly,” Fred Blacklaws discusses his piece with the accompanist (undated newspaper photograph).\n\nOne of Joan Singleton’s major roles as an accompanist was at festivals both vocal and choral. She was the official accompanist to the Perth Musical Festival, to the Edinburgh Competition Festival for 50 years from 1920[94] and, for a time, the Glasgow Festival. Judging by the interviews she gave she clearly enjoyed this work. Joan Singleton made an impression on Hugh Roberton. As the most important person in the choral world in Scotland (and in Britain), I assume he was instrumental in getting Joan Singleton associated with the Scottish Music Festivals. He was the founder and conductor of the Glasgow Orpheus Choir the foremost a cappella choir in Britain. He was also one of founders of the Glasgow Music Festival in 1911, a festival Joan Singleton was associated with for several years. He wrote an apologetic letter to her on 25 May 1920 from Glasgow in which he is hoping to work with her in Glasgow.[95] He was successful as shown by the review by Harry Plunket Greene quoted above. Hugh Roberton wrote:\n\nDear Miss Singleton,\n\nAlthough I have come home to a mess of correspondence I feel I must write to you. It may not have occurred to you that to find encouragement and sympathy at the outset of my Edinburgh job meant so much to me as it did. And you were the first to make me feel that the work was worth doing. I think that appreciation of yours after my first innings on the Monday night coloured the whole week and helped to make it what it was. If I was cheeky and presuming you will, I know, forgive me. I had come straight from an exacting week at Birmingham and one cannot ride on the crests of musical waves and remain, at the same time, normal in every respect. I enjoyed being associated with you because of your reliable musicianship and your very quick sympathy and if I expressed myself crudely either in word or action you will know that it was really an emotional reaction from the judicial (and necessarily somewhat cold and analytical) work of adjudicating as such.\n\nIsn’t a Festival a real living thing? Compared with the exotic kind of music dabbling that passes current for musical interest it is as red riotous life to a kind of polite stupor. By the way Bisset[96] is sure he can get you a choir composed of girls who will look up to you and to whom you will be able to impose your personality. So you must see him. I enclose a few copies of The Lute[97] including a reprint of an old one containing essays by members on “the spirit of the choir”. When I get time I shall look out some music for you. I would greatly like to see you at Moray House Training College, High St Edinburgh when I am lecturing on Saturday 5 June at 10 a.m. Not to hear my lecture but to hear Cathie Woods Choir which was the feature of the Edinburgh Festival and which you missed. I am due at Galashiels on Friday morning for the Border Festival. This ends my Festivals for the year. Pardon the long screed. Best wishes and a thousand thanks.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nHugh S. Roberton\n\nPS My purpose in sending you the Lutes is to let you know what kind of folk we are. Some day you will come to Glasgow and see us all.\n\nJoan Singleton met Harry Plunket Greene early in her London career and he remained a friend and supporter to the end of his life. As well as being a fine recitalist – he was the first to sing Schumann’s Dichterliebe cycle in London in 1903 – he was a noted adjudicator at festivals.[98] A handwritten undated review by him of her playing at a Music Festival in Glasgow indicates his enthusiasm for Joan Singleton’s accompanying:\n\nMiss Singleton yesterday was a perfect wonder. A whole heap of baritones were bad musicians and kept coming in where they liked, and skipping half bars and putting in others. She covered up their tracks and kept the whole thing alive in a way that was just genius besides playing the music quite brilliantly. She was wonderful. H. P. G.\n\nHarry Plunket Greene and Sir Hugh Roberton (images from the internet).\n\nIn a concert at the Usher Hall in Edinburgh featuring the Glasgow Orpheus Choir under Hugh Roberton, Joan Singleton accompanied Miss Gladys Clark ‘a violinist of considerable power and executive skill’. As usual, Miss Joan Singleton was ‘an excellent accompanist’. [99]\n\nSir Richard Terry,[100] one of the adjudicators at the Festival:\n\nWarmly complimented Miss Joan Singleton, the accompanist in this class (of ‘raw-toned sopranos’). If the audience had been wearing hats, he should have asked everyone to take their hats off to Miss Joan Singleton.\n\nOne dear one young lady had missed two and a half lines through lapse of memory, yet no one had turned a hair; this accompanist had not given them away. They should approach en bloc and thank her for saving their lives.\n\n50 years when a tactful letter came from the Association:[101]\n\nWe think that now perhaps is the time to suggest a change. We feel that the day must come when you would rather be working nearer home and when the thought of a strenuous week up here will become something of a burden to you.\n\nJoan Singleton had written on the envelope: Final word from above (Edinburgh Competition Festival).\n\nNewspaper photographs of (left) Joan Singleton at the Perth Musical Festival in 1937 and (right) at the Edinburgh (Competition) Festival in 1960. The caption under the photograph from the Perth Musical Festival reads: Miss F. Joan Singleton who has been playing accompaniments day and night since Perth Musical Festival started on Monday. For example, in one competition there were 20 soloists, who sang a song of six verses – making 120 times in which she repeated the tune. In another class she had to repeat a song 77 times. That was one afternoon’s work. The article accompanying this photograph is attached as Appendix II. This caption under the photograph on the right from the Edinburgh Evening News, 23 May 1960 reads: Miss Joan Singleton, who has been an accompanist at the Edinburgh (Competition) Festival since its inception 40 years ago, was presented with a purse and cheque to mark the occasion at Saturday evening’s session in the Music Hall. Dr T. M. McCourt, this year’s chairman, is shown making the presentation to Miss Singleton. The article accompanying this photograph is attached as Appendix III.\n\nJoan Singleton’s views on accompanying are in a lecture she gave a lecture called The Art of Accompanying to the Women’s Institute at Denman College in 1952 (Appendix I), but there are also newspaper interviews with her on the subject: one from the Perthshire Festival in 1937 (Appendix II) and another from Edinburgh in 1960 celebrating her 40 years association with the Edinburgh Competition Festival (Appendix III). From her papers, it is clear that Joan Singleton gave other lectures including one on Parry’s song Jerusalem which traditionally opened Women’s Institute meetings (see Appendix IV).\n\nJoan Singleton’s last years are best described in her obituary in the Thundridge and High Cross Church Monthly Magazine. After the war Joan Singleton lived at 32 Ermine Street, Thundridge, Ware in Hertfordshire:\n\nEarly in October Joan Singleton aged 88 years, died.[102] She was a much loved member of Thundridge Parish. Joan was an accomplished musician – her professional life had been filled with travel and much interest. We shall always remember Joan for her joy in living – her sense of artistry and delight in all that is beautiful coloured everything for Joan and we miss now a dear friend. Joan was well known in musical circles throughout the country, having accompanied many famous singers and instrumentalists and taken part in choral festivals.\n\nBefore, and during, World War 2 she accompanied Aline Hay’s Trio.[103] In 1947, encouraged by Miss Hay, and at the suggestion of Molly and Charles Sweet (then of Pine End) and their friends, she helped to re-form Ware Choral Society which she saw grow from forty to about a hundred voices before she retired as accompanist a few years ago and became the Society’s President.\n\nAlways wanting to make music, in about 1950, Joan Singleton gathered together a group of friends, known as Thundridge Madrigal Singers who met on Sunday evenings to enjoy music together under her inspiration. This group sang to W.I.’s and churches, including Thundridge for several years.\n\nHarvest Thanksgiving for the Blind at Little Berkhampstead organised by the Rev. Garth Bawtree-Williams and broadcast annually were a great delight to her as she accompanied her friends in the choir on the piano, with Dr. George Thalban Ball on the organ.\n\nWhen Betty Hvistendahl formed the present Thundridge Singers it was Joan Singleton who was their first accompanist, later becoming President.\n\nJoan’s Funeral Service at Thundridge on October 8th was fittingly joyous – the congregation nearly raised the roof with ‘For all the Saints.’ We are having a Memorial Service at Thundridge for Miss Singleton on the evening of Sunday, November 23rd at 6.30 p.m.\n\nA photograph of Joan Singleton aged 86 from the Eastern Daily Press in 1973. The caption reads: Still playing the organ in St. Andrew’s Hall, Norwich, for the W.I. 55th annual meeting was Miss Joan Singleton who made a special trip from Hertfordshire to start the meeting off with the traditional bars of Jerusalem.[104]\n\nAPPENDIX I\n\nThe Art of Accompanying\n\n(A lecture given at Denman College 5 March 1952)[105]\n\nWhat a task I have accepted for myself and no mistake!…..but it’s a great pleasure being here and to try and give you some idea of the Art of Accompanying. But I may as well confess as hobby or career to some fear and trepidation to embarking on such a difficult subject — And WHY? Is it because it covers such a vast field? That its requirements are untold? That it asks for a whole-hearted surrender to the ART?…No, surely because it’s so elusive, so difficult to put into words.\n\nOne has but to scan over the shelves of a music (library) to see how few have written anything more than the merest scraps on the subject altho’ our stalwart Gerald Moore has made a success of his The Unashamed Accompanist and is now following it up with Request Lectures (and one can well imagine that H.M.V. Records will not be far distant. He urges people to take up the ART as a profession – even in preference to being a solo pianist and surely he’s right. It’s so many-sided…\n\nSome say solo playing and accompanying are one and the same thing – some utterly deny this.\n\nBut speaking for myself I can’t help feeling that the one who begins with a comprehensive background of pianoforte works has a tremendous pull over the student who starts from scratch. Apart from the enormous literature for the piano there is the added advantage of forms and styles – to mention but few of its assets. The solo pianist may draw huge audiences, perhaps enormous fees – while in contrast the struggling accompanist may have to be content with a few shillings for an hour’s work with a singer, a few more with strings or other instruments in Sonata works – More still if you achieve the high order of being a coach accompanist and for concerts and recitals programmes the fees a movable and varying scale of fees…But putting aside this tiresome question of pence (tho’ the labourer should always be worthy of his hire, of course) hasn’t the accompanist all the “Fun of the Fair,” so to speak? There is all the fun of team-work, the immense amount of matching to be done together – Practices with all and sundry from Village Hall to Albert Hall, in Church, in Cathedrals, in the Home, in Recitals, in Festivals – the making of friends if only in passing, tho’ many one can keep for life – the experience shared together (as here, in these helpful surroundings) in the counties and countries visited (I well remember a 1st class return sleeper to Rome to cover some vocal recitals there and Genoa – Florence thrown in) and languages learnt for foreign songs. Not forgetting our own lovely poems…… Then it need not be restricted to soloists – there can be opera – perhaps filling in parts for orchestras when you can easily imagine you are doing something much grander than you are – a concerto at least !!\n\nAnd let no one belittle or under-estimate the experience and valuable help that can be gained from playing for a Choral Society – working under a good conductor can be an education in itself. So much for the fun of it and opportunities offered…..and now for the requirements.\n\nText-books tell us some of the essentials.\n\n1 To be a fair and accurate pianist.\n\n2 To be a good sight-reader.\n\n3 To do transposition in all its phases\n\n4 Even Memory tests\n\n5 Even filling in missing bars, or vamping as best one can, to save awkward situations\n\nand to these surely one should add:-\n\n6 To be a good pedaller (not pedlar)\n\n7 To be ALERT – ALIVE ENTHUSIASTIC and SUPPORTING\n\n8 And what of Touch…….?\n\n9 The one touch mortal always fills me with sadness – a singing master said t’other day – “what on earth do you mean by a ‘one-touch’” It’s when Notes are Notes, technique good but a deadly monotonous level throughout – a “p” mark can be coloured or un-coloured in so many different ways. Equally so with “f” or “ff” marks.\n\n10 Whatever the Touch, the nearer you can get to making your own fingers ‘sing’ – the better accompanist you will be.\n\nThis matching of tones and colours can be such an entrancing study and more than repays one for all the time and thought and terrific listening put into it.\n\nFor the finished artist you must be able to put your keyboard behind you – your keys and fingerings well established and devote yourself heart and soul to the picture you are helping to present — and when you have had the music long enough beforehand, be sure and memorise all you can – at any rate the vital spots and especially the turn of the pages – both sides – for even if you have the most skilled turn-over-er at your side, he or she can have an accident or turn bars too soon or too late…… Why even worse can befall – the whole copy may fall – then what? (Saw it happen at the Festival of Britain in London last summer – hot day windows opened everywhere – charming young accompanist started off 1st choir entrant – wind blew down from top windows, the music flapped away – a nasty scruffle to patch it up, but the performance was shattered). Then memorising is important when you find yourself in such a poor position on the platform that you simply can’t see the music and the conductor at the same time! (one could go on at length about the extraordinary positions one can find the pianos in halls – in the furthest and most awkward corners – in fact you may not be on the platform at all.). This question of memory is all the more important now that we have such works of art woven for voice and piano. Look at the incomparable Schubert for a moment – what equality of musical partnership, what a school for one’s apprenticeship – or for any aspiring student.\n\nTaking at random:-\n\nWOHIN Whither? With its vocal line telling the story – the right hand the brook, the left hand the march rhythm – together thus – (Anyone who can burst into the vocal line anywhere please do) and going backwards in this same song-cycle called the “Maid of the Mill” – to\n\nDas Wandern – a strophic song with 5 verses to the same tune, when it’s so important that the accompanist should make all the subtle difference in them\n\n1) – 2) – 3) – 4) – 5) –\n\nThen that huge “Dramatic Religious Rhapsody” the Young Nun – with its background of raging storm, thunder and lightening, the convent bell heard whether in storm or calm throughout – the young nun saying her life has been such a battle to win through to.\n\nAnd for sheer joy of Rhythm why not “Mein” ? one of the same cycle –\n\nAnd for fascination of figure work, why not the Trout and the bubbles it makes in the water?\n\nAnd so from Schubert through Schumann, Brahms and Wolf, right on to our present day writers – and now with many of the modern choral accompanists – one never ceases to be grateful for the interest brought into these little works, these miniatures, for the pianist. So many spring to one’s mind by A. Gibbs, Bridge, Dyson, Gardiner, Howells, Ireland, Thiman and all the others – shame to start singling out but the duet – “See how the morning smiles” by Ireland is such a particularly grateful bit of writing from a practice point of view. (Let it be confessed, though, I always hope choral works won’t be too difficult because of having to read them at sight – without rehearsal – and often in the semi-dark.\n\nWhen re-working and practising the Lady of Shalott it occurred to me you might like it if we took it through as a ‘practical’ experience and did some “spotting” together as if in quick study class?\n\nConclusion\n\nIn olden days one was expected to “keep under” – self-effacement before all else – for fear of spoiling or [being] accused of stealing the soloist’s limelight – but now with all these lovely works which can only be given in ‘double harness’, with the piano part in real duet form, one dare not be less than supporting. And oh! What a delight it is to hear this support and balance when justright – It can be quite different in rehearsal at home – and then in public. Conditions have so much to do with it. This applies just as much to singers and strings – they can sound quite different.\n\nThe piano part is often now so elaborate. Far more like Chamber Music in which all players are on equal terms, with their give and take, balance of tone and Good Ensemble.\n\nA good piano accompanist STIMULATES singing – it can even make singers do more than they thought they could – Then again it amplifies and can give completeness to effect. Then it can help to maintain pitch and prevent flatness or other faults of intonation. (Quote own fears here) And think how important it is to ‘launch’ a song or work in the right mood – perhaps not more than a few chords (like the Lark?) – the utmost musicianship and insight are required to make a real ARTIST. Several ordinary things may be required of you – play from impossible MSS or incomplete copies – play on all kinds of pianos, cope with varying artistic temperaments – show tact, be loyal, be ready to direct or advise if asked – yes, and in whatever conditions to appear cheerful and helpful.\n\nA bad dreary accompanist can have a deplorable effect on the spontaneity of the singing – and many a choral society has been brought to disaster by the unimaginative efforts of an indifferent player…. but we know only too well how true they are.\n\nIf asked how to draw up an ABC for accompanying with but little time to spend on it, I know I should be defeated – But of the bass: advocate these bass notes only – I seem to remember many occasions at Festivals when it would have been a relief if some kind-hearted person at the piano would stop struggling with chords and their insides and just play a good bass – remember the 4th as the bus to take you home.\n\nAPPENDIX II[106]\n\nThe perfect accompanist – the competitor’s friend – the nice lady at the piano. At one time or another all these titles have been conferred on Miss F. Joan Singleton, official accompanist at [the] Perthshire Musical Festival. These descriptions have been applied by adjudicators, by festival officials, by competitors. Miss Singleton must now be known to thousands of people in the district. This is the seventeenth Musical Festival and the sixteenth at which she has officiated.\n\nEncouraging Smile\n\nBut she never obtrudes. Her manner and actions are those of the perfect accompanist – quiet, competent and understanding. It is thus that competitors know and appreciate her – her ready, encouraging smile, her comforting presence and her sympathetic support in the ordeal of competitive singing or playing. Miss Singleton has played for thousands of singers at musical festivals. Normally her work is in London concert hall accompaniment. She also acts as accompanist at Edinburgh and for a time was at the Glasgow Festival. She plays at similar events in England. This week alone she has been at the piano in Perth City Halls morning, afternoon and evening for five days – playing for kiddies’ action songs and singing games, junior choirs and young soloists, and in the medal and classical vocal competitions.\n\n“I Like It All”\n\nWhich class does she enjoy best? “I like it all,” she says. “It does not get monotonous. One gets a personal interest in the competitors. Some of these singers I have seen grow up from the time I played for them in the children’s classes. It is good to feel how some of them have improved, and it can all be so interesting.”\n\nAPPENDIX III\n\nA clipping from an Edinburgh paper from 1960 is headed:\n\nDedicated\n\nWhen I looked into the Assembly Rooms yesterday to see what was happening at the Edinburgh Musical Festival, I found Joan Singleton playing passages of “The Messiah” on the piano. Miss Singleton, one of the Festival’s great personalities, has a remarkable record of service at this and other Scottish Festivals over the last 40 years. If ever there was a woman dedicated to music it is Miss Singleton, who told me it was the late Dr Hugh Roberton, the founder and conductor of the famous Glasgow Orpheus Choir who played a very important part in inaugurating Music Festivals in Scotland.\n\nI asked her if she ever found it monotonous playing the same tune over and over again at festivals and she replied “Never.”\n\nShe was born in Somerset, and her parents sent her to Germany to study. There she met an Edinburgh student who recommended Edinburgh as a teaching centre. “Joan is really quite a remarkable personality and is known at festivals throughout the country,” commented one of the adjudicators, Jan Van Der Gucht from the Royal College of Music in London.\n\nAPPENDIX IV\n\nThe Story of “Jerusalem”\n\nThere is no record of when and where this talk was delivered. It was presumably presented at a W.I. meeting, probably in Norfolk.\n\nWords by William Blake (1757-1827); Music by Sir Hubert Parry (1848-1918).\n\nThe poem, Jerusalem, which with its setting by Sir H. Parry has been adopted by many W.I’s as their special song, is of such a mystic character as frequently to demand some sort of explanation.\n\nW. Blake, painter, engraver, and poet, was born in London in the reign of George II. His unusual imaginative powers found expression, not only in poetry, but in illustrations for many books, both in water colours and engraving.\n\nThe poem, Jerusalem, is taken from one of his “Prophetic Books” all of which are highly symbolical and now very obscure. The title Jerusalem, the dwelling place of Peace, embodies his vision of the ideal city of God, where Christ’s law of Love prevails, and where men live in brotherhood with one another. The first 8 lines, which have been puzzling to many, refer to the widely accepted tradition that the living Christ actually visited England in parts of Cornwall and Somerset. It is a historical fact that a trade in tin and lead existed in very early times between England and the Country of the Phoenicians. There is a persistent tradition that Joseph of Arimathea was engaged in this trade: the idea occurs in a quaint song used by the tin-miners. If, as many commentators have surmised, Joseph of Arimathea was related to the Mother of our Lord, it is not unlikely that Christ, as a youth, may have accompanied him in some of his journeyings. During the period when the Gospels are silent as to his life, between the ages of 12 and 30. The tradition survives in Cornwall, at Glastonbury in Somerset, and at Priddy on the Mendip Hills where the trade in lead is known to have existed in the time of Christ. It was to this story Blake referred, probably hearing it when on a visit to Priddy, a small village, lying in the very centre of the ancient lead and copper mining district. The entrances to these disused mines still show, dark and terrible, against the green hillsides. Probably in Blake’s time, gaunt machinery rose black against the sky line, causing his reference to “dark Satanic Mills.” Yet beyond them still rise the green hills of Somerset, peaceful and unsullied, and the beautiful belief that these hills are always green because they were once trodden by holy feet. Possibly also Blake had in his mind the great increase of mechanical power all over England, and the cruel use of child labour in the mills.\n\nThis vision of England sanctified and claimed for Christ himself leads Blake on to the prayer and resolve of the 2nd stanzas. He prays for the bow and arrow of burning enthusiasm, for the spear for closer battle, and above all, for the spiritual forces of Heaven the “Chariot of Fire” to carry him onwards, till his vision of peace shall find fulfilment in the fertile and smiling English land.\n\nSir Hubert Parry. For many years the President of the Royal College of Music, composed the music. The accompaniment is difficult but it is possible to procure a simpler setting, and the marked increase of force and fervour, in the ‘2’ verses, tho’ the air remains the same, should be clearly defined.\n\n“Jerusalem” formed part of the Jubilee celebrations in 1935 when it was included by special command of King George V in the programme of the great National Concert in the Albert Hall.\n\nOther thoughts on ”Jerusalem.” The 1st verse has as its theme the legend that Christ came to Britain as a child, but it really throws out a challenge. Blake is asking us what we think about our country, what does it mean to us with all its beauty and traditions? Do the right spiritual and physical conditions prevail in it for its people to develop what is best in themselves? In the 2nd verse he answers the challenge and as we sing it we answer it too, for it is a challenge to the individual. “Bring me my bow of burning gold, I will not cease from mental fight.” We shall all interpret this challenge according to our lights: the bow, the chariot and the spear will mean something different for each of us, but the essence of Blake’s message in this and all his other poems is his belief that it is only by men using their knowledge and their imagination and by their working together in love, that a solution to the world’s problems can be found.\n\nLet every Christian, as much as in him lies, engage himself openly and publicly before all the world in some mental pursuit for the building of Jerusalem."
